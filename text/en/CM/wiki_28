<doc id="1201724" wikidata="Q1652744" url="?curid=1201724" title="Hōjicha">
<text>is a Japanese green tea. It is distinctive from other Japanese green teas because it is roasted in a porcelain pot over charcoal. It is roasted at to prevent oxidation and produce a light golden colour, as opposed to other Japanese teas which are steamed. In general, the base of a hōjicha consists of leaves from the second harvest or after.

== Description ==

=== Visual appearance ===
Dry hōjicha tea leaves are brown wedge-shaped needles. The tea is fired at a high temperature, altering the leaf colour tints from green to reddish-brown.

Infusions have a distinctive clear red appearance and nutty fragrance. Hojicha is sometimes sold in a powdered form and used to make steamed milk drinks. 

=== Taste ===
Once infused, hōjicha has a nutty, toasty, sweet flavor. The tea has little to no bitterness.

== History ==

The process of making hōjicha was discovered in 1920 by accident when a Kyoto merchant had unsaleable bancha. By roasting the bancha, the merchant created a new flavor; hōjicha.

Hōjicha is often made from bancha ( &#x27;common tea&#x27;), tea from the last harvest of the season. However, other varieties of hōjicha also exist, including a variety made from sencha and kukicha. Kukicha (also known as or &#x27;twig tea&#x27;) is made primarily from the twigs and stems of the tea plant rather than the leaves alone.

Hōjicha infusions have a light- to reddish-brown appearance and are less astringent. The lower levels of astringency in hōjicha are due to the tea losing catechins during the high-temperature roasting process.

The roasted flavours are extracted and dominate this tea: the roasting replaces the vegetative tones of other varieties of Japanese green tea with a toasty, slightly caramel-like flavour.

The roasting process used to make hōjicha also lowers the amount of caffeine in the tea. Because of its mildness, hōjicha is a popular tea to serve during the evening meal, before sleep, and preferred for children and the elderly.

<text>Miranda Jane Seymour (born 8 August 1948) is an English literary critic, novelist and biographer of Robert Graves, Mary Shelley and Jean Rhys among others. Seymour is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. She elected to resign from the Royal Society of Literature in December 2023. She was formerly married to Andrew Sinclair, and Anthony Gottlieb and is now married to Ted Lynch.

==Early life and education==
Miranda Seymour was two years old when her parents moved into Thrumpton Hall, the family ancestral home. She detailed her unconventional upbringing in her 2008 memoir &quot;In My Father&#x27;s House: Elegy for an Obsessive Love&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster, UK), which appeared in the US as &quot;Thrumpton Hall&quot; (HarperCollins) and won the 2008 Pen Ackerley Prize for Memoir of the Year.

She studied at Bedford College, London, now part of Royal Holloway, University of London, earning a BA in English in 1981.

==Career==
Seymour began her literary career in 1975 with an historical novel, &quot;The Stones of Maggiare&quot;. This was followed by six others concerned with Italy and Greece, including &quot;Daughter of Darkness&quot;, about Lucrezia Borgia, and &quot;Medea&quot; (1982).

In 1982, Seymour turned to biography, beginning with a group portrait of Henry James in his later years, entitled &quot;A Ring of Conspirators&quot;. This was followed by biographies of Lady Ottoline Morrell,(updated in 2024) Mary Shelley and Robert Graves, upon whom she also based a novel, &quot;The Telling&quot;, and a radio play, &quot;Sea Music&quot;. 

In 2001, she came across material on Hellé Nice, a forgotten French Grand Prix racing driver of the 1930s and in 2004 published a book, &quot;The Bugatti Queen&quot;, about Nice&#x27;s ultimately tragic life. The book provided the material for an exhibition about Helle Nice on show until October 2025 at the Mac Museum at Singen, Germany. &quot;The Bugatti Queen&quot; was followed by another life of an unconventional woman, that of 1930s film star, Virginia Cherrill. This was also based on a substantial archive in private ownership, and published as &quot;Chaplin&#x27;s Girl: The Lives and Loves of Virginia Cherrill&quot; in 2009. 

In 2002, Seymour published a book about herbs: &quot;A Brief History of Thyme&quot;. &quot;Noble Endeavours: Stories from England; Stories from Germany&quot; appeared in September 2013 from Simon &amp; Schuster and was described as being a magnificent and scholarly work of &#x27;unfazed optimism&#x27;.

Seymour returned to biography with &quot;In Byron&#x27;s Wake&quot; (2018) which covered the lives of Lord Byron&#x27;s wife and daughter, Annabella Milbanke and Ada Lovelace. &quot;I Used to Live Here Once: The Haunted Life of Jean Rhys&quot; was published by Harper Collins in 2022.

Seymour reviews and has written articles for newspapers and literary journals, including &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;[the Financial Times, the Literary Review&quot;, and the &quot;New York Review of Books&quot;.

Formerly a Visiting Professor of English Studies at the University of Nottingham Trent, Seymour is currently the Royal Literary Fund Fellow at King&#x27;s College London.

<doc id="1201738" wikidata="Q7277858" url="?curid=1201738" title="RTMC Astronomy Expo">
<text>The RTMC Astronomy Expo was one of the major gatherings of amateur astronomers in the United States for five decades, from 1969 to 2019.

== History ==

Founded by Clifford W. Holmes and the Riverside Astronomical Society, the RTMC Astronomy Expo began in 1969 as the Riverside Telescope Makers Conference at Riverside City College in Riverside, California. It consisted of a series of lectures about astronomy and telescope making with a competition for quality and innovative telescopes. In 1973 it was moved to a dark-sky site near Idyllwild and in 1975 it was moved to its last home near Big Bear City. It was held on the three-day Memorial Day weekend. In 2010, it was held in May on the weekend that corresponded with new moon to allow amateur astronomers the best viewing conditions. Due to low attendance the date was moved back to the Memorial Day weekend in 2011

The organization annually presented the Clifford W. Holmes Award for &quot;Major Contribution to Popularizing Astronomy, the Warren Estes Memorial Award for &quot;Best Use of Simple Materials and Technique&quot; in making telescopes, and the Clyde Tombaugh Award &quot;Creative Innovation in Telescope Design&quot;.

To better reflect the evolution of amateur astronomy, the Riverside Telescope Makers Conference was renamed the RTMC Astronomy Expo in 2003. Each year the scope of activities continued to grow and evolve and had lectures, workshops, extensive beginners activities, a swap meet, astronomy clubs and other organizations, and vendors demonstrating and selling astronomical products. The Expo promoted family activities with swimming, canoeing, horseback riding, archery, wall climbing. Extensive hiking and mountain biking trails were also available.

On 12 October 2019, the Board of the RTMC announced that 2019 was the last year that the Astronomy Expo will be held.

== Nightfall ==

The RTMC also produced an early autumn star party called Nightfall in Borrego Springs, CA. Nightfall is still held by the Riverside Astronomical Society on the weekend in October that corresponds with the new moon.

== Pacific Astronomy and Telescope Show (PATS) ==

In 2007, the Riverside Telescope Makers Conference, Inc. announced a fall event to be held in Pasadena named the Pacific Astronomy and Telescope Show (PATS). This annual event was held annually 2008 thru 2012 at the Pasadena Convention Center and focused displays by commercial vendors, astronomy clubs and other organizations as well as talks and workshops. The first PATS was held September 13–14, 2008. The 2013 event was cancelled. PATS was designed to complement the ongoing RTMC Astronomy Expo.

<doc id="1201745" wikidata="Q239818" url="?curid=1201745" title="Tuesday Weld">
<text>Tuesday Weld (born Susan Ker Weld; August 27, 1943) is a retired American actress. She began acting as a child and progressed to mature roles in the late 1950s. She won a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Female Newcomer in 1960. Over the following decade, she established a career playing dramatic roles in films.

Weld often portrayed impulsive and reckless women and was nominated for a Golden Globe for &quot;Play It as It Lays&quot; (1972), an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot; (1977), an Emmy Award for &quot;The Winter of Our Discontent&quot; (1983), and a BAFTA for &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; (1984). After 1984 her acting appearances became infrequent, and her last appearance was in 2001&#x27;s &quot;Chelsea Walls&quot;.

== Background and family ==

Weld was born Susan Ker Weld in Manhattan on Friday, August 27, 1943. Her father was Lathrop Motley Weld, of the Weld family of Massachusetts. Her father died in 1947 at the age of 49, shortly before his daughter&#x27;s fourth birthday. Her mother, Yosene Balfour Ker, daughter of the artist and &quot;Life&quot; illustrator William Balfour Ker, was born in Ealing, Middlesex, England. She was Lathrop Weld&#x27;s fourth and last wife. Canadian-born William Balfour Ker had Scottish ancestry. His mother, Lily Florence Bell Ker, was first cousin of the inventor Alexander Graham Bell, and his father, William Ker, was a Scottish businessman and banker.

Weld had two siblings, Sarah King Weld and David Balfour Weld. Her name became Tuesday, an extension of her childhood nickname, &quot;Tu-Tu&quot;, so named by her young cousin, Mary Ker, who could not pronounce &quot;Susan&quot;. She legally changed her name to Tuesday Weld on October 9, 1959, a Friday; her birthdate of August 27, 1943 was also a Friday.

==Career==

===Early career===
Left in financial difficulty by her husband&#x27;s death, Weld&#x27;s mother put Weld to work as a model to support the family. As the young actress told &quot;Life&quot; in 1971:
My father&#x27;s family came from Tuxedo Park, and they offered to take us kids and pay for our education, on the condition that Mama never see us again. Mama was an orphan who had come here from London but so far as my father&#x27;s family was concerned, she was strictly from the gutter. I have to give Mama credit—she refused to give us up… So I became the supporter of the family, and I had to take my father&#x27;s place in many, many ways. I was expected to make up for everything that had ever gone wrong in Mama&#x27;s life. She became obsessed with me, pouring out her pent-up love—her alleged love—on me, and it&#x27;s been heavy on my shoulders ever since. Mama still thinks I owe everything to her.

Weld&#x27;s mother secured her an agent using her résumé from modeling. She made her acting debut on television at the age of 12, and her feature film debut that year in a bit role in the 1956 Alfred Hitchcock crime drama &quot;The Wrong Man&quot;.

In 1956 Weld played the lead in &quot;Rock, Rock, Rock&quot;, which featured record promoter Alan Freed and singers Chuck Berry, Frankie Lymon, and Johnny Burnette. In the film Connie Francis performed the vocals for Weld&#x27;s singing parts.

On TV she appeared in an episode of &quot;Goodyear Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Backwoods Cinderella&quot;. She understudied on Broadway in &quot;The Dark at the Top of the Stairs&quot;.

Weld was cast in a supporting role in the Paul Newman–Joanne Woodward comedy &quot;Rally Round the Flag, Boys!&quot; (1958), made by 20th Century Fox. At Paramount Pictures, Weld was in &quot;The Five Pennies&quot; (1959), playing the daughter of Danny Kaye, who called Weld &quot;15 going on 27&quot;. She guest-starred a number of times on &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot; (1958–59). She appeared in &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; with Efrem Zimbalist Jr., in the 1959 episode, &quot;Secret Island&quot;.

===20th Century Fox===
Weld&#x27;s performance in &quot;Rally &#x27;Round the Flag, Boys!&quot; impressed executives at Fox, who signed her to a long-term contract. They cast her in the CBS television series &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, with a salary of $35,000 for one year. Weld played Thalia Menninger, the love interest of Dobie Gillis (played by Dwayne Hickman), whose rivals for Thalia&#x27;s affection included Milton Armitage (played by Warren Beatty). Although Weld was a cast member for only one season, the show created considerable national publicity for her, and she was named a co-winner of a &quot;Most Promising Newcomer&quot; award at the Golden Globe Awards.

At Columbia, she had a leading role in a teen film, &quot;Because They&#x27;re Young&quot; (1960), starring Dick Clark. She was second billed in &quot;Sex Kittens Go to College&quot; (1960) made by Albert Zugsmith at Allied Artists. She made a second film for Zugsmith, &quot;The Private Lives of Adam and Eve&quot;, made in 1959 but not released for two years.

She guest starred on &quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot; in &quot;Appleby: The Big Producer&quot; (1959) and on &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; (1959) and &quot;The Millionaire&quot; (1960).

At Fox, she played Joy, a free-spirited university student in &quot;High Time&quot;, starring Bing Crosby and Fabian Forte. She sang a love song to Fabian in the season opener of NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot; on October 9, 1960. Four weeks later, on November 13, Weld returned to the network as a guest star in NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tab Hunter Show&quot;. She guested in &quot;The Mormons&quot; for &quot;Zane Grey Theatre&quot; (1960).

For Fox, Weld had a supporting role in the sequel &quot;Return to Peyton Place&quot; (1961), in the part played by Hope Lange in the original. Her portrayal of an incest victim was well received, but the film was less successful than its predecessor. She supported Elvis Presley in &quot;Wild in the Country&quot; (1962), along with Lange. Weld had an off-screen romance with Presley.

Fox also used her as a guest star on &quot;Follow the Sun&quot; (&quot;The Highest Wall&quot;) and &quot;Adventures in Paradise&quot; (&quot;The Velvet Trap&quot;). On November 12, 1961, she played a singer, Cherie, in the seventh episode of ABC&#x27;s television series &quot;Bus Stop&quot;, produced by Fox, with Marilyn Maxwell and Gary Lockwood. It was an adaptation of the play by William Inge, with Weld in the role originated on screen by Marilyn Monroe.

Weld supported Terry-Thomas in the Frank Tashlin comedy &quot;Bachelor Flat&quot; (1962), for Fox. Following the film&#x27;s release, she appeared on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; as the celebrity mystery guest.
Weld&#x27;s mother was scandalized by her teen daughter&#x27;s love affairs with older men, such as actor John Ireland, but Weld resisted, saying, If you don&#x27;t leave me alone, I&#x27;ll quit being an actress—which means there ain&#x27;t gonna be no more money for you, Mama&#x27;. Finally, when I was sixteen, I left home. I just went out the door and bought my own house&quot;.

She was Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s first choice to play the role of Lolita in his 1962 film, but she turned the offer down, saying: &quot;I didn&#x27;t have to play it. I was Lolita&quot;.

Weld took three months off to go to Greenwich Village in New York and &quot;study myself&quot;. Then she starred along with Jackie Gleason and Steve McQueen in &quot;Soldier in the Rain&quot;, written by Blake Edwards from a novel by William Goldman, but the film was only a minor success.

She won excellent reviews for a February 7, 1962, episode in the &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;A Case Study of Two Savages&quot;, adapted from the real-life case of backwood killers Charles Starkweather (played by Rip Torn) and Caril Ann Fugate, (depicted as the character Ora Mae Youngham, played by Weld), Starkweather&#x27;s young bride, on a homicidal spree ending in New York City. She guest starred on &quot;Route 66&quot; in &quot;Love Is a Skinny Kid&quot; (1962), &quot;Ben Casey&quot; in &quot;When You See an Evil Man&quot; (1962), and &quot;The Dick Powell Theatre&quot; in &quot;A Time to Die&quot; (1962) and &quot;Run Till It&#x27;s Dark&quot; with Fabian (1962).

In 1963 Weld guest-starred as Denise Dunlear in &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, in the episode &quot;Something Crazy&#x27;s Going on in the Back Room&quot; alongside Angela Lansbury. She was in &quot;The Legend of Lylah Clare&quot; for &quot;The DuPont Show of the Week&quot; (1963), directed by Franklin J. Schaffner.
In 1964 she appeared in the title role of the episode &quot;Keep an Eye on Emily&quot; on Craig Stevens&#x27;s CBS drama, &quot;Mr. Broadway&quot;. In the same year, she appeared as a troubled blind woman in &quot;Dark Corner&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Fugitive&quot;.

She appeared with her former co-star Dwayne Hickman in Jack Palance&#x27;s circus drama &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; on ABC, in separate episodes.

Weld supported Bob Hope in the comedy &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Sweden&quot; (1965).

===Stardom===
Weld appeared in 1965 in the Norman Jewison film &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot;, opposite Steve McQueen. There was some controversy when she refused to meet the local governor at a fund-raiser for hurricane victims, jumping out of a car in view of 70,000 people. The film was a big hit.

Weld got a star role in &quot;Lord Love a Duck&quot; (1966), with Roddy McDowall, Ruth Gordon, and Harvey Korman. Weld received excellent reviews, but the film was a box office disappointment.

She followed it playing Abigail in a TV adaptation of &quot;The Crucible&quot; (1967), opposite George C. Scott and Colleen Dewhurst. After guest starring on &quot;Cimarron Strip&quot; (1967), Weld had the starring role in &quot;Pretty Poison&quot; (1968), co-starring Anthony Perkins. The film became a cult success, but she disliked the film and did not get on with director Noel Black.

Around this time, Weld became famous for turning down roles in films that succeeded at the box office, such as &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, &quot;True Grit&quot;, &quot;Cactus Flower&quot;, and &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot;. In a 1971 interview with the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Weld explained that she had chosen to reject these roles precisely because she believed they would be commercial successes: &quot;Do you think I want a success? I refused &#x27;Bonnie and Clyde&#x27; because I was nursing at the time, but also because deep down I knew it was going to be a huge success. The same was true of &#x27;Bob and Carol and Fred and Sue&#x27; or whatever it was called. It reeked of success&quot;.

The films Weld did make included &quot;I Walk the Line&quot; (1970), opposite Gregory Peck; &quot;A Safe Place&quot; (1971), co-starring Jack Nicholson and Orson Welles and directed by Henry Jaglom, and &quot;Play It as It Lays&quot; (1972), again with Perkins, for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award.

===Peak years of success===
Weld began to work again in television, starring in &quot;Reflections of Murder&quot; (1974) and &quot;F. Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood&quot; (1975) in which she played Zelda Fitzgerald.

Weld attracted attention as the favored, out-of-control Katherine in &quot;Looking for Mr. Goodbar&quot; (1977)packing into her short screen time an orgy, a divorce, a lot of alcohol, and two abortionsand was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress; later she appeared in &quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain&quot; (1978) opposite Nick Nolte; and the ensemble satire &quot;Serial&quot; (1980).

She said she preferred television. &quot;What I dig about TV is the pace&quot;, she said. &quot;Two weeks for even a heavy part – great. Too much thinking about a role is a disaster for me. I mean, let&#x27;s do it, let&#x27;s get it done.&quot;

She played the lead in the TV films: &quot;A Question of Guilt&quot; (1978), in which she plays a woman accused of murdering her children; &quot;Mother and Daughter: The Loving War&quot; (1980), a remake of &quot;Madame X&quot; (1981); a new version of &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (1982); and co-starred with Donald Sutherland in the TV film &quot;The Winter of Our Discontent&quot; (1983), for which she received an Emmy nomination.

In feature films, Weld had a supporting role in Michael Mann&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;Thief&quot;, opposite James Caan. She played Al Pacino&#x27;s wife in &quot;Author! Author!&quot; (1982), and had a supporting role in &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; (1988).

In 1984, she appeared in Sergio Leone&#x27;s gangster film &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;, playing a jeweler&#x27;s secretary, who is in on a plan to steal a shipment of diamonds. During the robbery, her character goads Robert De Niro&#x27;s character, David &quot;Noodles&quot; Aaronson, into &quot;raping&quot; her with her complicity. She later meets up with the gang from the robbery, and becomes the moll of James Woods&#x27; character Max Bercovicz. The performance earned Weld a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actress of 1984.

On TV, Weld was in &quot;Scorned and Swindled&quot; (1984), &quot;Circle of Violence&quot; (1986) and &quot;Something in Common&quot; (1986).

===Later career===
Weld was reunited with Anthony Perkins in an episode of &quot;Mistress of Suspense&quot; (1990).

In 1993, she played a police officer&#x27;s neurotic wife in &quot;Falling Down&quot;, starring Michael Douglas and Robert Duvall. She had small supporting roles in &quot;Feeling Minnesota&quot; (1996), &quot;Investigating Sex&quot; (2001), and &quot;Chelsea Walls&quot; (2001).

==Personal life==
Weld has been married three times. She was married to screenwriter Claude Harz from October 23, 1965, until their divorce on February 18, 1971. They had a daughter, Natasha, born on August 26, 1966. Weld was awarded custody of Natasha in the divorce and $100 a month in child support payments.

She married British actor, musician and comedian Dudley Moore on September 20, 1975. On February 26, 1976, they had a son, Patrick. The couple divorced in 1980, with Weld receiving a $200,000 settlement plus $3,000 monthly alimony for the next 4 years and an additional $2,500 a month in child support.

On October 18, 1985, she married Israeli concert violinist and conductor Pinchas Zukerman, becoming stepmother to his daughters Arianna and Natalia. The couple divorced in 2001. In court papers, Zukerman quoted Weld as saying, &quot;Why do I need to go to another concert when I&#x27;ve heard the piece before?&quot; and &quot;I can&#x27;t stand the backstage scene. I don&#x27;t want to hear another note.&quot;

Between marriages, Weld dated Al Pacino, David Steinberg, Mikhail Baryshnikov (whose previous girlfriend, Jessica Lange, had been Weld&#x27;s best friend), Omar Sharif, Richard Gere and Ryan O&#x27;Neal.

Weld sold her beach house in Montauk, New York, in the late 2000s and moved to Carbondale, Colorado. In 2018, she left Colorado and bought a $1.8 million home in the Hollywood Hills.

===Montauk house===
Weld and then-husband Zukerman purchased 74 Surfside Ave in 1990 from the estate of Norman Kean, who produced the long-running Broadway show &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot; and who killed himself and his actress wife Gwyda Donhowe in their Manhattan apartment in 1988. Although the Montauk residence was not a crime scene, Weld later struggled to find a buyer for the property due to its murder-suicide connection. Listed in 2006, it sat on the market for three years before selling at a reduced price of $6.75 million in 2009 and, , is a rental property. Weld bought a &quot;tiny condo&quot; there in 2021 for $335,000.

==In popular culture==
The cover of Matthew Sweet&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Girlfriend&quot; features a photo of Weld. Originally called &quot;Nothing Lasts&quot;, the album was retitled after Weld objected. Weld is mentioned in the Donald Fagen song &quot;New Frontier&quot; on his album &quot;The Nightfly&quot;. Sweet&#x27;s greatest hits compilation &quot;Time Capsule&quot; features photos of Weld on the front and back covers. British band The Real Tuesday Weld is named after a dream the vocalist had which involved the actress.
Weld is also mentioned in Tiny Tim&#x27;s version of &quot;Then I&#x27;d Be Satisfied With Life&quot; on the album &quot;God Bless Tiny Tim&quot;.

<doc id="1201750" wikidata="Q171541" url="?curid=1201750" title="Pierluigi Martini">
<text>Pierluigi Martini (born 23 April 1961) is an Italian former racing driver. He won the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans and participated in 124 Formula One Grands Prix (with 119 starts) between 1984 and 1995.

==Early life==
Martini&#x27;s uncle, Giancarlo Martini, raced during the 1970s, including some non-championship races in a Ferrari 312T entered by Scuderia Everest, a team owned by Giancarlo Minardi. Pierluigi&#x27;s younger brother, Oliver, is also a racing driver.

==Formula One==

Martini participated in 124 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 9 September 1984, driving for Toleman in place of suspended Ayrton Senna at the 1984 Italian Grand Prix. He scored a total of 18 championship points and was synonymous with the Minardi team (run by the same Giancarlo Minardi who had previously owned Scuderia Everest).
Indeed, aside from a single outing with Toleman and a one-season dalliance with Scuderia Italia in 1992, Martini&#x27;s entire Formula One career was spent with the Italian outfit. He raced with the minnow team in three different stints, drove for them on their debut in 1985, scored their first point in the 1988 Detroit Grand Prix, and their only front-row start at the 1990 United States Grand Prix (where unexpected rain on Saturday meant that the grid was decided entirely by times from Friday&#x27;s session. Pirelli&#x27;s soft qualifying tyres caught Goodyear off guard, and the Italian manufacturer put five of its teams in the top ten positions). Both Martini and Minardi led a race for a single lap at the 1989 Portuguese Grand Prix, and their joint-best finish was 4th at the 1991 San Marino Grand Prix and 1991 Portuguese Grand Prix, the latter being Martini&#x27;s single finish on the lead lap. Initially out of a drive for 1993, he was recalled back to the little Italian team midway through the season in place of Fabrizio Barbazza, Martini impressed by outpacing his young teammate Christian Fittipaldi.

Martini was also one of the drivers with a reputation for ignoring blue flags. Examples given are the 1991 Monaco Grand Prix when he held up Emanuele Pirro in the Dallara, Stefano Modena in the Tyrrell, and Riccardo Patrese in the Williams for several laps despite running towards the back of the field, and the 1995 Canadian Grand Prix where he blocked Gerhard Berger in the Ferrari when the Austrian tried to lap him. On both occasions Martini was called in for a 10-second stop and go penalty for ignoring blue flags. Quizzed about this attitude on the occasion of the 1995 San Marino Grand Prix, where he held up winner Damon Hill, Martini replied: &#x27;What should I exactly apologise for? My trajectories are always clean. Should I just park the car on the grass? I&#x27;m here to do my race like anybody else. I&#x27;ve always been correct. Those who complain about my conduct should explain why they cannot overtake me when their car has at least 150 hp more than mine&#x27;.

==Sportscars==
Prior to commencing his Formula One career, Martini drove a Lancia LC2 in the 1984 24 Hours of Le Mans. After leaving Formula One, he began a successful career in sportscar racing. He contested the 1996 24 Hours of Le Mans in a Porsche run by Joest Racing. 1997 brought a fourth-place finish in a Porsche 911 GT1 which he also raced in the FIA GT Championship that year. In 1998, he joined the brand new Le Mans program of BMW Motorsports.

In 1999, Martini, Yannick Dalmas and Joachim Winkelhock won the Le Mans 24 Hours. The trio drove for BMW. The team had to fight both Toyota and Mercedes works cars and won the race by a lap from the runner-up Toyota.

Martini returned to motorsports in 2006, competing in the Grand Prix Masters series for retired Formula One drivers.

<doc id="1201763" wikidata="Q461423" url="?curid=1201763" title="Rudolf Brandt">
<text>Rudolf Hermann Brandt (2 June 1909 – 2 June 1948) was a German SS officer from 1933–45 and a civil servant. A lawyer by profession, Brandt was the Personal Administrative Officer to &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; (&quot;Persönlicher Referent vom Reichsführer SS&quot;) Heinrich Himmler and a defendant at the Doctors&#x27; Trial at Nuremberg for his part in securing the 86 victims of the Jewish skull collection, an attempt to create an anthropological display of plaster body casts and skeletal remains of Jews. He was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity and executed in 1948. Felix Kersten, a Finnish doctor who reportedly saved thousands of Jews by influencing Himmler during the massage therapy he gave him throughout the war, tried to save Brandt from execution, as Brandt helped him by adding names on the lists intended to save camp prisoners.

==Early life and education==
Rudolf Brandt, the son of a railway worker, was born on 2 June 1909, and raised in modest circumstances in the town of Frankfurt an der Oder. Brandt was a member of the student&#x27;s stenography (shorthand) club at the Realgymnasium, and in 1927, at the age of 18, won a competition with a transcription speed of 360 syllables per minute. He attended the University of Berlin and the University of Jena (1928–1932), simultaneously working from 1928 to 1930 as a court reporter at the Provisional National Economic Council. Brandt would continue to practice stenography in the evenings with his colleague and former Frankfurt schoolmate Gerhard Herrgesell. Brandt was awarded a doctorate of law from the University of Jena in July 1933.

== Nazi Party membership ==
He joined the Nazi Party in January 1932 (membership number 1,331,536) and the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) in October 1933 (membership number 129,771). Brandt and his skills in transcription were noticed by Heinrich Himmler, who had him transferred to his staff. On 11 December 1933, he joined the Staff of &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Himmler in the capacity of clerk. In November 1935, he was commissioned an &quot;Untersturmführer&quot; (second lieutenant) and ultimately rose to the rank of &quot;Standartenführer&quot; (colonel). In 1936, Brandt was named Chief of the Personal Staff of the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; (&quot;Leiter des Persönlichen Stabes RFSS&quot;), and in 1937, &quot;Persönlicher Referent des RFSS&quot;, a position he held until the end of the war in May 1945. In this position Brandt handled Himmler&#x27;s entire correspondence with the exception of matters pertaining to the Waffen-SS or the Police.

Walter Schellenberg, the Ausland-SD department chief who reported directly to Himmler, said of Brandt:

In 1938 or 1939, Brandt became Himmler&#x27;s liaison officer to the Reich Ministry of the Interior and particularly to the Office Secretary of the Interior. In 1943, when Himmler became Minister of the Interior, Brandt was Ministerial Councilor and Head of the Minister&#x27;s Office in the Reich Ministry of the Interior. Brandt was also a member of the &quot;Ahnenerbe&quot; society, of which Himmler was President. On account of his position, Brandt was also the liaison officer to the Reich Secretary of the &quot;Ahnenerbe&quot; Society, Wolfram Sievers. Brandt was briefly absent from Himmler&#x27;s office, from 30 March 1941 to 11 May 1941. During this time he fought with the Artillery Regiment of the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler in the campaign against Greece.

==War crimes: Jewish skull collection==
Originally the &quot;specimens&quot; to be used in the collection were to be Jewish commisars in the Red Army captured on the Eastern front by the Wehrmacht. The individuals ultimately chosen for the collection were obtained from among a pool of 115 Jewish inmates at Auschwitz concentration camp in Occupied Poland. They were chosen for their perceived stereotypical racial characteristics. The initial selections were carried out by SS-&quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; Dr. Bruno Beger and Dr. Hans Fleischhacker, who arrived in Auschwitz in the first half of 1943 and finished the preliminary work by 15 June 1943.

Due to a typhus epidemic at Auschwitz, the candidates chosen for the skull collection were quarantined in order to prevent them from becoming ill and ruining their value as anatomical specimens. In February 1942, Sievers submitted to Himmler, through Rudolf Brandt, a report from which the following is an extract read at the Nuremberg Doctors Trial by General Telford Taylor, Chief Counsel for the prosecution at Nuremberg:

==End of the war==
In August 1944, Brandt informed &quot;Standartenführer&quot; , whom Himmler had appointed head of pest control, of Himmler&#x27;s desire to create a &quot;Fly and Gnat Room&quot;, where &quot;all SS leaders and police who are either uninterested in the nuisance created by flies or even dismiss it with a superior smile will find they will be taken into care there for some considerable time, during which they will have the opportunity to study the question of flies and gnats from a theoretical angle as well as to enjoy the attentions of the hundreds and thousands of flies and gnats in the room itself.&quot;

Brandt was a member of the entourage which accompanied Himmler into hiding, leaving Flensberg on 10 May 1945, with the goal of reaching Bavaria. He became separated from Himmler and surrendered along with half of the six-man group to British troops on 21 May.

==Trial and execution==
Rudolf Brandt was indicted in October, 1946 by the US Military Tribunal, on charges of:
# Conspiracy to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity;
# War crimes, to wit performing medical experiments without the subjects&#x27; consent on prisoners of war and civilians of occupied countries, as well as participation in the mass-murder of concentration camp inmates;
# Crimes against humanity: committing crimes described under count 2 also on German nationals; and
# Membership in a criminal organization, the SS.

Brandt, in common with most of the defendants at the Doctor&#x27;s Trial, was acquitted on the first count as the Tribunal felt that it fell outside their jurisdiction.

He was found guilty on the other three counts, as he had been responsible for the administration and coordination of the experiments at the camps. He was hanged on 2 June 1948, his 39th birthday.

<text>Hermann Albert Lang (6 April 1909 – 19 October 1987) was a German racing driver who raced motorcycles, Grand Prix cars, and sports cars.

==Prewar racing==
Born in Cannstatt near Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, Hermann Lang had to go to work at age fourteen to help support his family following the death of his father. Young Lang found a job as a motorcycle mechanic, eventually buying his own used bike with which he began amateur racing. He won the first race he entered and before long decided to compete in the sidecar class. At age twenty-two, he won the German sidecar mountain race championship.
Lang&#x27;s big break came when he landed a job at the Mercedes factory where he became part of their Grand Prix motor racing team. He was made head mechanic for the Mercedes-Benz W25A model to be driven by the Italian star Luigi Fagioli who had left Alfa Romeo to create a powerhouse Mercedes factory team that also included Rudolf Caracciola. Following a very successful season in which Fagioli won both the Italian and Spanish Grand Prix, Hermann Lang was given a chance to drive for the Mercedes team. He proved to be most capable on high-speed racetracks, capturing his first win in the 1937 Tripoli Grand Prix at the Mellaha Lake course in Libya which was then the fastest racetrack in the world. Lang dominated the event, winning it for three straight years. That year he won his second major race at the AVUS extravaganza.

In 1938, he won two more races for Mercedes including the prestigious Coppa Ciano at Livorno, Italy. Nevertheless, in spite of Hermann Lang&#x27;s skills and racing success and his popularity with racing fans, being a part of the Mercedes Silver Arrows team was not easy. Made up of wealthy and aristocratic drivers who looked down on the uneducated, working-class Lang, he was always treated as an outsider. However, in 1939 he earned their grudging respect when he won five of the eight Grand Prix races he started, including victories at the Belgian Grand Prix, the Pau Grand Prix in France, the Swiss Grand Prix and his third consecutive Tripoli Grand Prix. In addition to being a quick driver, Lang was also advantaged in that being a former mechanic, he had a lot of mechanical knowledge of cars and was able to give good technical feedback during testing and races to chief designer Rudolf Uhlenhaut, who was able to develop the Mercedes cars to a greater degree, and Lang&#x27;s natural feel for the machinery meant that he was able to get set-ups on his cars that made them faster than his rivals&#x27; cars. He clocked the fastest lap at the French Grand Prix and was leading the field but engine trouble knocked him out of the race. In 1939, Lang also competed in, and won, the Kahlenberg hillclimbing race in Austria.

==1939 championship controversy==

In 1939, Lang was declared the champion of the European Championship, but this is unofficial. The season was cut short by World War II and Lang received this title from the German motor racing authority, instead of the official authority AIACR, based in Paris. 
By way of the points at the last attempted race of the season, competitor Hermann Paul Müller was considered the points leader, not Lang.

==Postwar racing==
 The onset of World War II robbed Lang of his best years but after the war ended, he returned to racing in 1946 without a team, driving a six-year-old BMW to victory in the first post-war race in Germany held at Ruhestein. In 1949 he began sports car racing and then competed in Formula Two racing before joining the Mercedes Grand Prix racing team in Argentina, at the Buenos Aires Grand Prix in 1951. In 1952, at age 43, he teamed up with Fritz Riess to capture the 24 hours of Le Mans. The following year, he published his autobiography titled &quot;Grand Prix Driver,&quot; with the Foreword written by the Mercedes team manager, Alfred Neubauer. Published in Germany, it was translated into English by Charles Meisl and brought out in England.

In 1953, Hermann Lang was given a chance to participate in Formula One racing driving for Maserati after one of their team drivers was injured. He raced in two F1 events that year with his best result a fifth-place finish at the Swiss Grand Prix. The following year Mercedes rejoined Grand Prix racing and Lang came back for another F1 season behind the wheel of a Mercedes W196. But at age 45, he had a less than successful campaign that saw him replaced in several races by one of the team&#x27;s younger drivers. His season and career ended at the 1954 German Grand Prix at Nürburgring when he spun out after ten laps, even though he was running as high as 2nd in front of his teammate Karl Kling. Lang recognized the time had come to retire from racing and he returned to his job at the Mercedes factory.

<doc id="1201769" wikidata="Q7550628" url="?curid=1201769" title="Social Development Canada">
<text>The Department of Social Development, also referred to as Social Development Canada, was from Dec. 2003 to Feb. 2006 the department of the government of Canada with responsibility for developing and implementing social policies involving families with children, disabled people, senior citizens and others through a series of programmes and services. The department was also responsible for the Canada Pension Plan.

==Overview==
The Department of Social Development was created in December, 1997 when Human Resources Development Canada was reorganized into two separate departments. In January 1999, Bill C-23, an Act to establish the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development and Bill C-22, an Act to establish the Department of Social Development and repeal the Department of Human Resources Development was given Royal Assent in Canadian Parliament.

On February 6, 2006, through a series of Orders in Councils, the department was merged with Human Resources and Skills Development Canada. The combined department was initially referred to as Human Resources and Social Development Canada, but in late 2008 reverted to its previous name. While the new department has not yet been sanctioned by specific legislation, its predecessor components have in fact ceased to exist.

<text>NBQX (2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline) is an antagonist of the AMPA receptor.

NBQX blocks AMPA receptors in micromolar concentrations (~10–20 μM) and also blocks kainate receptors. In experiments, it is used to counter glutamate excitotoxicity. NBQX was found to have anticonvulsant activity in rodent seizure models.

As the disodium salt, NBQX is soluble in water at high concentrations (at least up to 100 mM).

<doc id="1201790" wikidata="Q3129924" url="?curid=1201790" title="Hellé Nice">
<text>Mariette Hélène Delangle (1900–1984), better known by her stage name Hellé Nice, was a French dancer and motor racing driver. She danced in Paris at the Hôtel Ritz, Olympia Hall and Casino de Paris, before her career was ended by a skiing accident. She then became a racing driver, using roadster cars built by companies such as Alfa Romeo, Bugatti, DKW, Ford, Hispano-Suiza, Renault and Rosengart. She competed in various Grand Prix motor racing, hillclimbing and rally events at a time when it was rare for a woman to do so. She won the Grand Prix Féminin and the Actor&#x27;s Championship in 1929. Already famous in Paris, she became a household name in France in the early 1930s and raced as an exhibition dirt track driver for a season in the United States. 

Nice won the Rallye Paris – Saint-Raphaël Féminin in 1932 with Odette Siko. Racing was a dangerous profession in which some of her friends and lovers died. In 1949, the well-known racing driver Louis Chiron accused Nice without evidence of being a Gestapo agent in World War II. The allegation ruined her planned comeback and her partner eventually left her. She lived her last years in poverty and estranged from her family, supported by the charity . She died in Nice in 1984. A 2005 biography &quot;The Bugatti Queen: In search of a motor-racing legend&quot; by Miranda Seymour rehabilitated her reputation and her grave was marked by a plaque in 2010.

==Early life==
Mariette Hélène Delangle was born on 15 December 1901, to Alexandrine Estelle and Léon Aristide Delangle. Her father worked as the postman in Aunay-sous-Auneau, a village 40 miles from Paris. At three years old, she witnessed the 1903 Paris–Madrid race passing near to Aunay at Bourdinière. In 1915, she moved to Sainte-Mesme with her mother and three years later, she moved to Paris, living in rented apartments near Avenue des Ternes in the 17th arrondissement for the next decade. She worked as a nude model for artist René Carrère and also performed as a dancer.

==Stage==
Through Carrère, Delangle met Henri de Courcelles and who ran a car accessory business together and raced sportscars. She passed her driving test in 1920 and decided to drive her Citroën car on a road trip around France. She travelled to England with the two men in 1921; they were planning to race Grégoire cars at the Brooklands circuit but the cars were not delivered. Delangle was disappointed that the race was for men only. Delangle moved to rue Saint-Senoch, still in the 17th arrondissement and became a dance partner of Celéstin Eugène Vandevelde, taking the stage name Hellé Nice. Their dance act became famous as they performed together at the Hôtel Ritz and the Olympia Hall. By 1927 she was well-known enough to accept a billing at the Casino de Paris, where she danced in a show headlined by Maurice Chevalier called &quot;Wings over Paris&quot; (). Two years later, whilst skiing offpiste at Megève, she injured the cartilage in her knee. Whilst she did perform again after taking a year to recover, she decided to switch to motor racing, taking morphine for the pain.

==Racing==

Nice entered her first Women&#x27;s Grand Prix motor racing event in June 1929 (the Grand Prix Féminin), racing against Aniela d&#x27;Elern, Dominique Ferrand, Violette Morris and Lucy O&#x27;Reilly Schell. She was mentored by Mongin and trained hard, driving ten laps a day of the Autodrome de Linas-Montlhéry; at the wheel of an Oméga-Six car, she came first. The next day, she was invited to the Bugatti showroom on Avenue Montaigne in order to discuss driving a Type 43A roadster in the Actor&#x27;s Championship. She met drivers Guy Bouriat and Albert Divo, and won the championship. She also won the race at Le Touquet in a 1928 Rosengart. She signed a sponsorship deal with Lucky Strike cigarettes and bought herself a yacht and a black Hispano-Suiza car.

Ettore Bugatti invited her to drive a Type 35 in speed trials at the Montlhéry circuit, advised by Bouriat and Divo. In December, she recorded a speed of 196.871 km/h over 5 km (with a best lap at 197.7 km/h (123.56 mph)). At the time she was having an affair with Bruno, Count of Harcourt who was married to Princess Isabelle of Orléans. She bought one of the cars she had used in the time trials for 40,000 francs and travelled to the Moroccan Grand Prix in Casablanca where she hoped to spend time with the count. He died after crashing in practice and she withdrew from the race. She then raced in the Grand Prix Bugatti on the Le Mans Bugatti Circuit, coming third out of three behind Max Fourny and Juan Zanelli. At the Stade Buffalo in Montrouge, Paris, she fell off a motorcycle then jumped up and took a bow.
Nice had become a household name in France and capitalising on her fame, she toured the United States in 1930. She practiced dirt track racing at Harrington Park, New Jersey and was paid $200 per event as an exhibition driver. Her first appearance was in Woodbridge and she was immediately nicknamed the &quot;Speedbowl Queen&quot;, gaining a sponsorship deal with Esso. Whilst promoters told her she was the first woman to race cars in the US, Joan la Costa and Elfreida Mais had done it previously, although no woman had raced on dirt tracks. Nice drove at dangerous circuits such as Langhorne Speedway where deaths frequently occurred: Bill Albertson shared tips with her and then died on the Orange County Fair Speedway in 1930; her friend Herman Schurch died on a practice run at the Legion Ascot Speedway the following year. After eight weeks, she was offered a contract extension. She drove cars borrowed from other drivers, such as an American-made Miller. In Winston-Salem, North Carolina she hit a pothole and crashed; her last ride was at Spartanburg, South Carolina and she holidayed in Florida before returning to Europe.

Nice appeared at the 1931 Mi-Carême carnival in Nantes and continued to race cars. She broke time records in a hillclimb on Mont Ventoux in Provence and competed in the Women&#x27;s Championship at Montlhéry. In July 1931, she came second to Anne Itier in the Coupe des Dames at Reims and in the 2-litre race she came fourth, competing against male drivers such as Louis Chiron, Stanisław Czaykowski, René Dreyfus, Philippe Etancelin and the eventual winner Marcel Lehoux. The following month she came ninth in her blue Bugatti at the Grand Prix du Comminges, was the only female entrant at the Monza Grand Prix in Milan and competed in the Grand Prix on the beach at La Baule-Escoublac. She earned significant amounts from racing, receiving entry fees of 5,000 to 6,000 francs per race. Nice&#x27;s biographer Miranda Seymour reports that she took many lovers in the early 1930s, including Georges d&#x27;Arnoux, Roger Bonnet, René Carrière, Marcel Lehoux and Philippe de Rothschild.

Nice started 1932 by winning the Rallye Paris – Saint-Raphaël Féminin with Odette Siko in an Alfa Romeo 6C. For the 1932 Grand Prix season, she travelled south with Lehoux for the Algerian Grand Prix at Oran, coming second in the 2-litre category. At the Moroccan Grand Prix in Casablanca, she failed to qualify and Lehoux came first. During the 1933 Grand Prix season, she participated in fewer events because of a burst appendix. She was flagged off ninth at the Monza Grand Prix on the Autodromo Nazionale Monza which was held the same day as the Italian Grand Prix, on a different circuit. Three drivers died, namely Giuseppe Campari, Baconin Borzacchini and Stanislas Czaikowski. Guy Bouriat, who had helped her in 1929, died at the Picardy Grand Prix. Nice won the Woman&#x27;s Grand Prix again at Montlhéry and in the Coupe des Alpes came third with Roger Bonnet. The following year, at the Grand Prix de Dieppe, Nice saw her friend Jean Gaupillat crash into a tree in qualifying (he later died). She raced in the final despite women not normally being permitted to do so, coming seventh whilst competing against drivers such as Chiron, Lehoux, Etancelin and Francis Curzon, 5th Earl Howe. She also placed seventh in the Algerian Grand Prix.
Nice travelled to Brazil in 1936 with her future partner Arnaldo Binelli, intending to compete in two Grand Prix races. During the São Paulo Grand Prix, she was in third place behind Brazilian champion Manuel de Teffé when her Alfa Romeo hit a hay bale and crashed into the grandstand, killing six people and injuring more than thirty others. Nice was thrown from the car, landing on a soldier who died; because she was unconscious, she was also thought to be dead. She was hospitalised and in a coma for three days, until she woke up. Whilst in hospital she was visited by President Getúlio Vargas and her lover Henri Thouvenet wrote from France to ensure she was not held responsible for the crash and received compensation. On her return to France, Nice became embroiled in a scandal over the importation of cars without paying duty and alongside other racing drivers such as Robert Brunet, Philippe Etancelin, and Raymond Sommer was convicted and ordered to pay a fine.

In 1937, she participated in the Yacco oil endurance trials with Claire Descollas, Simone des Forest and Odette Siko at the Montlhéry circuit. Alternating with the three other women, Nice drove a Matford car with a V8 engine for ten days and ten nights, the team breaking ten world records. The following year, the German Fritz Huschke von Hanstein asked her to accompany him in the Chamonix rally in a DKW car. She won her last race in 1939 just before war broke out, driving a Renault 4CV in the Comminges.

During World War II, Nice lived with Binelli in Paris then in 1943 they moved to Villa des Pins on avenue Jean de la
Fontaine, in the hills above Nice in the south of France. In 1949, the noted racing driver Louis Chiron accused her of being a Gestapo agent in the war, at a party in Monaco to celebrate the first postwar Monte Carlo Rally. She was too shocked to reply at the time and she was later ostracised. Her biographer Miranda Seymour considers what the evidence could have been: a connection to Fritz Huschke von Hanstein did not prove problematic for fellow driver Anne Itier, who was known to have had an affair with him; in Nice&#x27;s archives, Seymour found a picture of German General of the Cavalry Manfred von Richthofen, who had written to Nice in 1936 after her accident in Brazil, but no further link could be found; enquiries at the German Federal Archives in Berlin yielded no record of Nice having been a collaborator. Despite the allegations not being backed by facts, they were enough to deter sponsors and thus ended her racing career. She attempted to participate in the 1951 Nice Grand Prix but was replaced at the last minute by a young Jean Behra.

== Final years and death ==

Nice lived in poverty in her later years. She moved from Nice to Magagnosc in 1957 and three years later Binelli left her. She asked for help from the charity and lived above their offices in Paris, acting as a chauffeur. After she returned to Nice, she went to hospital in September 1984 for an operation on her legs, then fell into a coma from which she never recovered. La Roue Tourne organised a memorial service for her and her ashes were sent to Sainte-Mesme, where her estranged sister refused to engrave her name upon the family gravestone.

After Nice&#x27;s name had fallen into obscurity, the 2005 biography &quot;The Bugatti Queen: In search of a motor-racing legend&quot; by Miranda Seymour rehabilitated her reputation, although Seymour admits part of her writing is creative reconstruction rather than based on facts. In 2010, the Helle Nice Foundation installed a plaque commemorating Nice in the graveyard. The 1927 Bugatti Type 35B she had owned was sold in 2014 by auction at the Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance in the US for $2,970,000. It was previously owned and raced as a vintage car by Brian Brunkhorst.

<text>&quot;Two turntables and a microphone&quot; is the basic concept of a DJ&#x27;s equipment. This phrase describes turntables (phonographs) and a microphone connected to a mixer. The DJ uses the mixer&#x27;s crossfader to fade between two songs playing on the turntables. Fading often includes beatmatching. Live hip hop music also often has an MC rapping into the microphone. In nightclubs the microphone is usually used only for announcements.

In his autobiography, Jimmy Savile claimed to be the first person to use two turntables and a microphone, at the Grand Records Ball at the Guardbridge Hotel in 1947. Savile is acknowledged as one of the pioneers of twin turntables for continuous play of music, though his claim has been disputed. Twin turntables were illustrated in the BBC Handbook in 1929, and were advertised for sale in &quot;Gramophone&quot; magazine in 1931. There was an obvious need for such a setup when the normal music format was 78rpm records that played for five minutes at most and a classical symphony came in a box which might contain ten discs or more. Using a pair of turntables was a way to keep the music playing without a break, as can be seen in the 1948 movie &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, where two stage hands do a poor job of changing records during a ballet performance in the church hall that housed the Mercury Theatre. 

&quot;Two turntables and a microphone&quot; is the title of a 2008 documentary of the life of hip-hop DJ Jam Master Jay (Jason Mizell). The phrase is also featured in the chorus of the song &quot;Where It&#x27;s At&quot; by Beck.

<doc id="1201799" wikidata="Q7528079" url="?curid=1201799" title="Sir John Smyth, 1st Baronet">
<text>Brigadier Sir John George Smyth, 1st Baronet, (24 October 1893 – 26 April 1983), often known as Jackie Smyth, was a British Indian Army officer and a Conservative Member of Parliament. During WWII, he led a unit in France and during the evacuation of Dunkirk, and in the Burma campaign. Although a recipient of the Victoria Cross, his military career ended in controversy.

==Early life and education==
Smyth was born in 1893 in Teignmouth, Devon, the son of William John Smyth (1869–1893), a member of the Indian Civil Service, and Lilian May Clifford. His grandfather was Army officer Henry Smyth, who was the second son of John Henry Smyth (1780–1822), of Heath Hall, Wakefield, Yorkshire, a Whig MP for Cambridge University (1812–1822) and Lady Elizabeth Anne FitzRoy, daughter of George FitzRoy, 4th Duke of Grafton. His great-uncle John George Smyth was an MP for the City of York.

Smyth was educated at Dragon School, Repton, and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

==Military career==

After passing out from Sandhurst, Smyth was commissioned as a second lieutenant on the unattached list for the British Indian Army on 24 August 1912, and was commissioned into the 15th Ludhiana Sikhs on 5 November 1913. He was promoted to lieutenant on 24 November 1914, three months after the outbreak of the First World War.

He was 21 years old, and a lieutenant in the 15th Ludhiana Sikhs, 3rd (Lahore) Division, Indian Army during the First World War, when his actions earned him the Victoria Cross (VC). In June 1915, Smyth was awarded the VC, the United Kingdom&#x27;s highest award for bravery in combat. The citation for this award, published in the London Gazette read:

As well as Smyth&#x27;s VC, the Indian Distinguished Service Medal was posthumously awarded to the men killed during this incident. Smyth was also awarded the Russian Order of St. George, Fourth Class, in 1915, and was promoted to captain on 24 August 1916.

Smyth continued his war service in Egypt and on the North-West Frontier.

==Between the wars==
In September 1920, when brigade major of the 43rd Indian Brigade, Smyth was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for distinguished service in the field in Waziristan. The citation for this award, published in the London Gazette, read:

In 1923, while serving in India, Smyth played two first-class cricket matches for the Europeans team.

Returning to England, he attended the Staff College, Camberley from 1923 to 1924, and his fellow students included numerous men who would later achieve high command, including Arthur Percival, Dudley Johnson (a fellow VC recipient), Arthur Wakely, Colville Wemyss, Montagu Stopford, John Halsted, Frederick Pile, Gordon Macready, Roderic Petre, Alastair MacDougall, Edmond Schreiber, Michael Gambier-Parry, Richard Dewing, Leslie Hill, Kenneth Loch, Douglas Pratt, Balfour Hutchison, Robert Pargiter, Robert Stone and Henry Verschoyle-Campbell along with Horace Robertson of the Australian Army and Harry Crerar and Georges Vanier of the Canadian Army. Smyth received a brevet promotion to major on 1 January 1928, receiving the substantive promotion to major on 24 August 1929. By this time, he was a General Staff Officer Grade 3 (GSO3) with the 3rd Battalion, 11th Sikh Regiment, an appointment he vacated on 22 November 1929. An early appointment as the Indian Army instructor at the Staff College, Camberley in 1930 further indicated that Smyth&#x27;s career was on the fast track, borne out by his appointment as a GSO2 at the Staff College on 16 January 1931, with the local rank of lieutenant colonel. He received a brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1933, and relinquished his appointment at the Staff College on 16 January 1934.

On 16 July 1936, Smyth was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel, an illustration of how rapidly his career had thus far progressed. He managed to persuade General Lord Gort, then the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) and a former instructor at the Staff College in the mid-1920s, as well as being another fellow VC recipient, to give him an undertaking that he would be given a brigade to command in the United Kingdom should hostilities break out.

==Second World War==
Having managed to engineer leave from India to the United Kingdom in the summer of 1939, shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, he called in his debt but was disappointed to be seconded to a United Kingdom-based staff job, as GSO1 of the 2nd London Division, a second-line Territorial Army (TA) formation, then commanded by Major General Harry Willans, which had only recently been formed.

In February 1940, after further lobbying, Smyth was appointed to command the 127th Infantry Brigade. His brigade major was Charles Phibbs Jones, later to become a full general. The brigade was one of three which formed part of the 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division, another TA formation, then commanded by Major General William Holmes, which from April he led in France as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). After the evacuation from Dunkirk in late May, he continued to command the brigade in Britain until he was summoned to return to India in March 1941. He was promoted to colonel on 23 December 1940.

After briefly commanding 36th Indian Infantry Brigade in Quetta and a period of sick leave, Smyth took command of 19th Indian Infantry Division as an acting major general in October, but was reassigned to command 17th Indian Infantry Division in December. Controversy surrounds his handling of the 17th Indian Division in February 1942, during its retreat across the Sittang River in Burma. It was said that he failed to expedite a strong bridgehead on the enemy&#x27;s side of the river and was forced, when it came under threat from the Japanese, to order the blowing of the bridge while two-thirds of his division were still on the far side with no other means of crossing the river and therefore dooming them. Seventeen Division were the only formation standing between the Japanese and Rangoon, and this loss, therefore, led directly to the loss of Rangoon and Lower Burma. The Commander-in-Chief, India, General Sir Archibald Wavell was furious and sacked Smyth on the spot.

There is also a degree of controversy about Smyth&#x27;s behaviour as regards his health in this period. He had not recovered from surgery for an anal fistula, which must have caused him significant, and possibly distracting, discomfort, yet managed to be recommended as fit to stay in command by a medical board presided over by the senior doctor in his own division.

Smyth received no further posts and returned to the United Kingdom to retire with the substantive rank of colonel and the honorary rank of brigadier. It took 16 years and revision of the official history before his version of the affair versus that of General Hutton, his corps commander, was clarified. Smyth&#x27;s book, &quot;Milestones&quot;, 1979, gives his version in which he relates that he had made representations to General Hutton 10 days previously recommending a withdrawal to the west bank of the Sittang River, thus permitting a strong defence line to be established. His recommendation was refused.

==Postwar career==
Smyth went into politics and stood unsuccessfully against Ernest Bevin in Wandsworth Central at the 1945 general election. At the 1950 election, he defeated the sitting Labour MP for Norwood, Ronald Chamberlain. He was made a baronet on 23 January 1956 with the style Sir John George Smyth, VC, MC, 1st Baronet Smyth of Teignmouth in the County of Devon and a privy counsellor in 1962. He retired from Parliament at the 1966 general election; as of 2015, he was the last VC recipient to sit in the Commons.

Smyth was also an author, a playwright, a journalist and a broadcaster. His two brothers were distinguished soldiers, one of whom also became a brigadier. He married twice: firstly Margaret Dundas on 22 July 1920, later dissolved, with whom he had three sons and a daughter; and then Frances Chambers on 12 April 1940. One of his sons, Captain John Lawrence Smyth of the 1st Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment (West Surrey), was killed on 7 May 1944, during the first attack on Jail Hill at the Battle of Kohima.

Smyth was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Imperial War Museum.

One of Brigadier Smyth&#x27;s uniforms is on display at the armoury of the Artillery Company of Newport in Newport, Rhode Island, USA.

Smyth was a cat lover and wrote three books on cats, &quot;Beloved Cats&quot; (Frederick Muller, 1963), &quot;Blue Magnolia&quot; (Frederick Muller, 1964) and &quot;Ming: The Story of a Cat Family&quot; (Frederick Muller, 1966).

<text>Dolores &quot;Dee Dee&quot; Kenniebrew (born July 9, 1945) is an American singer, best known for her work with the trio The Crystals.
She was born as Dolores Kenniebrew and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. In 1960, at age 15, she was invited to sing in the girl group the Crystals. The group was formed by a band musician named Benny Wells who would soon become the group&#x27;s manager. Wells was the uncle of Kenniebrew&#x27;s bandmate Barbara Alston. Although she rarely sang lead on their songs (her voice was, according to her bandmate, Barbara Alston, &quot;too high and soft&quot;), she was the only member who stayed in the group from their formation to their disbanding. With the Crystals, she enjoyed a successful (but not very long) career in music. Their hits began to dry up after 1964 and they disbanded two years later.

In 1971, Kenniebrew and her former bandmates (Dolores &quot;LaLa&quot; Brooks, Mary Thomas, and Barbara Alston) reunited to tour and perform on the oldies circuit. However, in 1973, they disbanded again to devote their times to their families. According to Kenniebrew&#x27;s Facebook page, in 2005 she and original Crystals Alston and Brooks performed together at the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, where girl-group postage stamps were unveiled.

Since the 1980s, she has kept the Crystals active in performing, but as a trio with two non-original members.

<text>Walt Disney Imagineering Research &amp; Development, Inc., commonly referred to as Imagineering, is the research and development arm of The Walt Disney Company, responsible for the creation, design, and construction of Disney theme parks and attractions worldwide. The company also operates Disney Live Entertainment and The Muppets Studio and manages Disney&#x27;s properties, from Walt Disney Studios in Burbank to New Amsterdam Theatre and Times Square Studios Ltd. in New York City. Founded by Walt Disney to oversee the production of Disneyland, it was originally known as Walt Disney, Inc., then WED Enterprises, from the initials meaning &quot;Walter Elias Disney&quot;, the company co-founder&#x27;s full name. Headquartered in Glendale, California, Imagineering is composed of &quot;Imagineers&quot;, who are illustrators, architects, engineers, lighting designers, show writers and graphic designers.

The term &quot;Imagineering&quot;, a portmanteau, was introduced in the 1940s by Alcoa to describe its blending of imagination and engineering, and used by Union Carbide in an in-house magazine in 1957, with an article by Richard F. Sailer called &quot;BRAINSTORMING IS IMAGination engINEERING&quot;. Disney filed for a trademark for the term in 1989, claiming first use of the term in 1962. Imagineering is a registered trademark of Disney Enterprises, Inc.

==History==
===WED Enterprises===
Walt Disney, Inc. (WDI) was formed by Walt Disney on December 16, 1952, with an engineering division tasked with designing Disneyland. In light of objections from his brother Roy as well as those of potential stockholders, WDI was renamed &quot;WED Enterprises&quot; in 1953 based on Disney&#x27;s initials. In 1961, WED moved into the Grand Central Business Park. WED Enterprises&#x27;s theme park design and architectural group became so integral to the Disney studio&#x27;s operations that Walt Disney Productions bought it on February 5, 1965, along with the WED Enterprises name.

===Imagineering===
The unit was renamed as of January 1986 to Walt Disney Imagineering. In 1996, Disney Development Company, the Disney conglomerate&#x27;s real estate development subsidiary, merged into Imagineering.

Imagineering created Disney Fair, a U.S. traveling attraction, which premiered in September 1996. With poor attendance, the fair was pulled after a few stops. Disney Entertainment Projects (Asia Pacific), Inc., a new Disney Asian Pacific subsidiary, selected a renamed fair called DisneyFest as its first project, taking it to Singapore to open there on October 30, 1997.

By 1997, Imagineers were in several buildings in Grand Central Business Park when Disney purchased the park. In September 1999, Disney Imagineering announced the Grand Central Creative Campus redesign of the industrial park with a new office-studio complex anchored by Disney Imagineering. Some of the buildings were demolished to make way for new buildings. The additional space would be for sound stages, production facilities and offices.

As part of The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s March 2018 strategic reorganization, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts merged with Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media segments into Disney Parks, Experiences and Products (DPEP), giving Disney Imagineering oversight of merchandise, games and publishing development.

In July 2021, DPEP chairman Josh D&#x27;Amaro announced that approximately 2,000 DPEP positions would be transferred over the next couple of years to the Lake Nona area of Orlando, Florida. In November 2021, it was reported that as many as 90% of the positions to be transferred are Walt Disney Imagineering positions, as DPEP relocates Imagineering&#x27;s headquarters from Glendale to a new 60-acre corporate campus in Lake Nona. The only Imagineering positions reportedly exempt from relocation were those dedicated to Disneyland or certain international parks. The relocation was reportedly motivated in part by $570 million in tax breaks from the state of Florida, as well as Florida&#x27;s business-friendly climate, lower cost of living, and lack of a state income tax. This relocation was cancelled in May 2023 amidst a feud with Florida governor Ron DeSantis.

==Principles==

New concepts and improvements are often created to fulfill specific needs. For instance, the Soarin&#x27; Over California ride system was designed to help guests experience the sensation of flight. During development, Imagineer Mark Sumner found an erector set in his attic, which quickly inspired the solution to create this experience. The ride effectively simulates hang gliding. One of Imagineering&#x27;s techniques, &quot;blue sky speculation&quot;, is a process in which ideas are generated without limitations. Imagineers may develop a bold idea in extreme detail, initially disregarding budgetary or physical constraints. It can take up to five years for an idea to turn into a finished attraction. The company considers this the beginning of a design process, believing, &quot;if it can be dreamt, it can be built&quot;.

WDI partnered with the Khan Academy to create a series of online video classes called Imagineering in a Box, to allow students to &quot;explore different aspects of theme park design, from characters to ride development...&quot; The classes, which are organized into three main categories (&quot;Creating Worlds&quot;, &quot;Designing Attractions&quot;, and &quot;Bringing Characters to Life&quot;), are presented by WDI employees using multimedia lessons and exercises.

===The Imagineering Pyramid===
Past Disney Imagineers have shared 15 principles of Disney Imagineering, divided into five tiers. These are:

Tier 1: Foundations of Imagineering
 1. It All Begins with a Story
 2. Creative Intent
 3. Attention to Detail
 4. Theming
 5. Long, Medium, and Close Shots

Tier 2: Wayfinding
 6. Wienies
 7. Transitions
 8. Storyboards
 9. Pre-Shows and Post-Shows

Tier 3: Visual Communication
 10. Forced Perspective
 11. &quot;Read&quot;-ability
 12. Kinetics

Tier 4: Making It Memorable
 13. The &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot; Effect
 14. Hidden Mickeys

Tier 5: Walt’s Cardinal Rule
 15. Plussing

Walt Disney coined the term &quot;plussing&quot; for the process of constantly striving to perfect Imagineering work. Disney believed that there is always room for innovation and improvement, stating, &quot;Disneyland will never be completed as long as there&#x27;s imagination left in the world.&quot; This sometimes takes the form of returning to previously abandoned ideas, such as the rework of the Museum of the Weird wax museum concept into the present The Haunted Mansion.

===The Art of the Show===
Disney theme parks are storytelling and visual experiences, also known as “The Art of the Show.” The use of theming, atmosphere, and attention to detail are essential in the Disney experience. Creative director John Hench noted the similarities between theme park design and film making, such as the use of techniques, including forced perspective. One notable example of forced perspective is Cinderella Castle in Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World. The scale of architectural elements is much smaller in the upper reaches of the castle compared to the foundation, making it seem significantly taller than its actual height of 189 feet.

The attraction, Pirates of the Caribbean, evokes a “rollicking buccaneer adventure,” according to Hench. In contrast, the Disney Cruise Line ships create an elegant seafaring atmosphere. Minor details in theme park shops and restaurants are crucial; these include the menus, names of the dishes and the Cast Members’ costumes. When guests walk down the area of Main Street, U.S.A., they are likely to notice a bakery fragrance, reminiscent of suburban America in the 1900s. In addition to theme parks, Imagineering has devised retail stores, galleries, and hotels which have &quot;stories&quot; and create a specific mood. For instance, the Disney&#x27;s Contemporary Resort features an A-frame structure, modern décor and futuristic features including a quiet monorail in the lobby. These details reinforce the hotel&#x27;s contemporary nature.

In 2010, Disney Educational Products produced a series of videos called &quot;The Science of Disney Imagineering&quot;. Each video was presented by Imagineer Asa Kalama and focused on a different science subject. Each video featured at least one Disney attraction, to show how science was used in them. These science subjects include Gravity, Trajectory, Levers &amp; Pulleys, Fluids, Energy, Design &amp; Models, Magnetism, Motion, Animal Adaptations: Communication, Friction, and Electricity.

===Mickey&#x27;s Ten Commandments===
In 1991, Marty Sklar (then-president of Imagineering) presented ten commandments attributed to Mickey Steinberg (the vice president of Imagineering). They are:

# Know your audience
# Wear your guest&#x27;s shoes (don&#x27;t forget the human factors; try to experience the parks from the guests&#x27; point of view)
# Organize the flow of people and ideas (ensure experiences tell a story that is organized and logically laid out)
# Create a &quot;Wienie&quot; (Walt Disney&#x27;s term for a &quot;visual magnet&quot;)
# Communicate with visual literacy (use a dominant color or shape or building to reinforce a theme)
# Avoid overload—create turn-ons (do not offer too much detailed information)
# Tell one story at a time (put one &#x27;big idea&#x27; in each show so guests leave with a clear understanding of the theme)
# Avoid contradictions—maintain identity (avoid irrelevant or contradicting elements; make sure the audience has a clear idea of what is being said)
# For every ounce of treatment, provide a ton of treat (take advantage of the distinction of the theme park, which is that it encourages active participation, compared to passive entertainment)
# Keep it up (do not become complacent or allow things to run down)

==Innovation==

Imagineering has been granted over 300 patents in areas such as advanced audio systems, fiber optics, interactive technology, live entertainment, ride systems and special effects. Imagineering pioneered technological advances such as the Circle-Vision 360° film technique and the FastPass virtual queuing system.

===Audio-Animatronics===

Imagineering is known for its development of Audio-Animatronics, a form of robotics, used in shows and theme park attractions that animate objects in three dimension (3D). The idea originated from Walt Disney&#x27;s fascination with a mechanical bird that he purchased in New Orleans, which later led to the development of the attraction, The Enchanted Tiki Room. The attraction, which featured singing Audio-Animatronic birds, was the first to use this technology. In the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair, a 3D figure of Abraham Lincoln was represented. The animated Lincoln delivered part of the Gettysburg Address for the &quot;Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln&quot; exhibit, the first human Audio-Animatronic figure.

Today, Audio-Animatronics are featured in many attractions, including Pirates of the Caribbean, The Haunted Mansion, The Hall of Presidents, Country Bear Jamboree, Star Tours—The Adventures Continue, and Muppet*Vision 3D. Guests have also had the opportunity to interact with Audio-Animatronic characters, such as Lucky the Dinosaur, WALL-E, and Remy from &quot;Ratatouille&quot;. The next wave of Audio-Animatronic development focuses on completely independent figures, also known as &quot;Autonomatronics&quot;. Otto, the first Autonomatronic figure, debuted at the 2009 D23 Expo and can see, hear, sense a person&#x27;s presence and emotions, and have a conversation.

===WEDway===
WEDway is a people mover system using linear induction motor (LIM) technology to propel vehicles along a pair of steel rails. This system was developed in the company&#x27;s early years. The system is in operation at Walt Disney World Resort&#x27;s Magic Kingdom and George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, United States. From 1967 to 1995, Disneyland utilized a version of this system which had rubber wheels placed every 9 feet along the guide-way.

==Theme park projects==

Since 1952, Imagineering has created twelve theme parks, a town, five cruise ships, dozens of resort hotels, water parks, shopping centers, sports complexes and various entertainment venues.

===Current Imagineering projects===
==Other projects==
Former creative director John Hench designed the &quot;Tower of Nations&quot; for the opening and closing ceremony of the 1960 Winter Olympics, whilst Walt Disney served as Pageantry Committee chairman.

Imagineering has collaborated with Disney Consumer Products on a number of projects for Disney Stores. The first store, in Glendale, was designed and constructed by a group of architectural Imagineers. Imagineering developed the now-defunct Walt Disney Gallery at the Main Place Mall in Santa Ana, California, and a Roman themed Disney Store at The Forum Shops at Caesars in Las Vegas. After the purchase of the Disney Stores by The Children&#x27;s Place in 2004, Imagineering helped design an exclusive chain of flagship stores, called World of Disney. These are located in resorts, Lake Buena Vista, Florida and Anaheim, California, as well as New York City. Another flagship store arrived at Disneyland Paris in 2012. An overhaul of Disney Stores was planned in 2009 with the help of Apple CEO Steve Jobs. Disney hoped to transition from a traditional retail model to an interactive entertainment hub.

In the 1990s, Imagineering designed the Club Disney interactive family fun center in Thousand Oaks, California. Although now closed, it was the first of several location-based entertainment (LBE) venues. In 1998, DisneyQuest, an high-tech, virtual reality arcade was launched at Disney Springs in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. Another DisneyQuest in Chicago was launched a year later. In 2007, Imagineering oversaw design and construction of ships, Disney Dream and Disney Fantasy. They also helped design exhibitions for the Autry Museum of Western Heritage in Los Angeles and developed the Encounter Restaurant, which is located at the top of Theme Building in Los Angeles International Airport. Moreover, they provided exhibits for the Port Discovery children&#x27;s museum at the Inner Harbor in Baltimore, Maryland, as well as the &quot;Below Deck&quot; sound show depicting Blackbeard&#x27;s final battle as part of the Pirate and Treasure Museum in St. Augustine, Florida.

From 1995 to 1997, Imagineering oversaw the renovation of the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York City. Imagineering also remodeled the Times Square Studios in New York City in 1996, following the acquisition of ABC. In 1997, Disney purchased the California Angels and renamed the team to Anaheim Angels. Shortly after, Imagineering renovated the Anaheim Stadium. Imagineering worked with a charity, For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, to create the teaser video and the story, as well as the theming of the 2016 FIRST Robotics Competition, FIRST Stronghold.

==Corporate locations==
Since the 1960s, Imagineering&#x27;s headquarters have been located in nondescript office buildings on the site of the former Grand Central Airport in Glendale, California, about east of Disney&#x27;s corporate headquarters in Burbank. Many of these employees were set to be relocated to a new facility in Lake Nona, Orlando, Florida. There are field offices at Epcot and Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort. There are also offices located at:

* Walt Disney Imagineering Disneyland Field Office, Disneyland Resort
* Tokyo Disney Resort Administration Building, Tokyo Disney Resort
* Walt Disney Imagineering Hong Kong Site Office, Hong Kong Disneyland Resort

<doc id="1201806" wikidata="Q5006575" url="?curid=1201806" title="C. J. Prentiss">
<text>Carolyn Jean Prentiss (June 6, 1941 – April 2, 2024) was an American politician of the Democratic party who served in the Ohio State Senate from 1999 until 2007. During the 126th Ohio General Assembly, she served as Minority Leader.

==Life and career==
Born in Cleveland in 1941, Prentiss grew up in an activist family. Her father worked with the Future Outlook League, which was critical in mobilizing the Black community and increasing Black employment. He was assaulted trying to integrate an amusement park during the Euclid Beach Park Riot of 1946. C. J. attended the March on Washington in 1963 along with her mother.

Prentiss earned a bachelor of arts degree and a master&#x27;s degree in education from Cleveland State University. She held a post-graduate certificate in Administration from Kent State University. She attended the advanced management program at Case Western Reserve University&#x27;s Weatherhead School of Management.

In 1976, Prentiss was one of the only Black women integrally involved in Ohio’s Cuyahoga Women’s Political Caucus, which at the time was primarily composed of white women. Next, Prentiss became a delegate to the Democratic Convention for Jesse Jackson in 1984, and then became co-chair of the Cleveland Rainbow Coalition.

From 1985 to 1990, Prentiss served on the Ohio State Board of Education. Known in Columbus as &quot;the highest ranking African-American education lawmaker in the state of Ohio,&quot; Prentiss served eight years in the Ohio State House of Representatives (8th district) before serving eight years in the Ohio State Senate (21st district). While in the Ohio State Senate, Prentiss represented constituents of Bratenahl, Brooklyn Heights, Cleveland Heights, Cuyahoga Heights, East Cleveland, Newburgh Heights and University Heights. She served as minority whip (during the 125th General Assembly), Senate Minority Leader, was the first female president of the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus (OLBC), and was the second African-American woman to serve as the Democratic leader in the Ohio Senate (after Rhine McLIn).

Prentiss was on numerous committees and consistently advocated for those most underserved. She spearheaded significant legislation that helped to decrease the Black-white academic achievement gap, she obtained funding for all-day kindergarten and reduced class sizes, and she worked tirelessly to improve education for students of all races. Under her leadership, the NBCSL published &quot;Closing the Achievement Gap: Improving Educational Outcomes for African American Children&quot;, which helped to put the achievement gap on the national agenda.

Prentiss was also on the founding board of directors for the nonpartisan economic policy group Policy Matters Ohio.

In 2007, she was also chosen to be the Special Education Adviser to Ohio Governor Ted Strickland.

Prentiss appeared on the pilot episode of &quot;30 Days&quot; discussing living on minimum wage.

Prentiss was a candidate in the special election to replace Stephanie Tubbs-Jones in the 110th Congress but withdrew before the Primary.

Prentiss died in Cleveland on April 2, 2024, at the age of 82.

<text>Ishvara () is a concept in Hinduism, with a wide range of meanings that depend on the era and the school of Hinduism. In ancient texts of Hindu philosophy, depending on the context, &quot;Ishvara&quot; can mean supreme Self, ruler, lord, king, queen or husband. In medieval era Hindu texts, depending on the school of Hinduism, &quot;Ishvara&quot; means God, Supreme Being, personal God, or special Self.
In Shaivism, &quot;Ishvara&quot; is an epithet of Shiva. In Vaishnavism it is synonymous with Vishnu, like in his epithet of Venkateswara. In traditional Bhakti movements, &quot;Ishvara&quot; is one or more deities of an individual&#x27;s preference (Iṣṭa-devatā) from Hinduism&#x27;s polytheistic canon of deities. In modern-day sectarian movements such as Arya Samaj and Brahmoism, &quot;Ishvara&quot; takes the form of a monotheistic God. In the Yoga school of Hinduism, it is any &quot;personal deity&quot; or &quot;spiritual inspiration&quot;. In Advaita Vedanta, Ishvara is the manifested form of Brahman.

==Etymology==
The root of the word Ishvara comes from ( ) meaning &quot;capable of&quot; and &quot;owner, ruler, chief of&quot;. The second part of the word &quot;Ishvara&quot; is ( ), which means depending on context, &quot;best, excellent, beautiful&quot;, &quot;choice, wish, blessing, boon, gift&quot;, and &quot;suitor, lover, one who solicits a girl in marriage&quot;. The composite word, &quot;Ishvara&quot; literally means &quot;owner of best, beautiful&quot;, &quot;ruler of choices, blessings, boons&quot;, or &quot;chief of suitor, lover&quot;.

As a concept, &quot;Ishvara&quot; in ancient and medieval Sanskrit texts variously means God, Supreme Being, Supreme Self, Shiva, a king or a ruler, a husband, the god of love, one of the Rudras and the number &#x27;eleven&#x27;.

The word &quot;Īśvara&quot; does not appear in Rigveda. However, the verb &quot;īś-&quot; does appear in Rigveda, where the context suggests that the meaning of it is &quot;capable of, able to&quot;. It is absent in Samaveda, is rare in Atharvaveda, but it appears in Samhitas of Yajurveda. The contextual meaning, however as the ancient Indian grammarian Pāṇini explains, is neither god nor supreme being.

The word &quot;Ishvara&quot; appears in numerous ancient Dharmasutras. However, there &quot;Ishvara&quot; does not mean God, but means Vedas. &quot;Ishvara&quot; in Dharmasutras could alternatively mean king, with the context literally asserting that the Dharmasutras are as important as &quot;Ishvara&quot; (the king) on matters of public importance&quot;.

The term is used as part of the compounds Maheshvara (&quot;The Great Lord&quot;) and Parameshvara (&quot;The Supreme Lord&quot;) as the names of Vishnu and Shiva. In Mahayana Buddhism it is used as part of the compound &quot;Avalokiteśvara&quot; (&quot;lord who hears the cries of the world&quot;, but see etymology section there), the name of a bodhisattva revered for his compassion. When referring to divine as female, particularly in Shaktism, the feminine Ishvari is sometimes used.

In Advaita Vedanta school, Ishvara is a monistic Universal Absolute that connects and is the Oneness in everyone and everything.

==Schools of thought==

Among the six systems of Hindu philosophy, Samkhya and Mimamsa do not consider the concept of &quot;Ishvara&quot;, i.e., a supreme being, relevant. Yoga, Vaisheshika, Vedanta and Nyaya schools of Hinduism discuss Ishvara, but assign different meanings.

Isvara is a metaphysical concept in Yogasutras. It does not mention deity anywhere, nor does it mention any devotional practices (&quot;Bhakti&quot;), nor does it give &quot;Ishvara&quot; characteristics typically associated with a deity. In Yoga school of Hinduism, states Whicher, Isvara is neither a creator God nor the universal Absolute of Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism. Whicher also notes that some theistic sub-schools of Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism, inspired by the Yoga school, explain the term &quot;Ishvara&quot; as the &quot;Supreme Being that rules over the cosmos and the individuated beings&quot;. Malinar states that in Samkhya-Yoga schools of Hinduism, &quot;Isvara&quot; is neither a creator-God, nor a savior-God.

Bhakti sub-schools refer to Isvara as a Divine Lord, or the deity of specific Bhakti sub-school. Modern sectarian movements have emphasized Ishvara as Supreme Lord; for example, Hare Krishna movement considers Krishna as the Lord. In traditional theistic sub-schools of Hinduism, such as the Vishishtadvaita Vedanta of Ramanuja and Dvaita Vedanta of Madhva, Ishvara is identified as Lord Vishnu/Narayana, that is distinct from the &quot;prakriti&quot; (material world) and &quot;purusha&quot; (Self).

These variations in &quot;Ishvara&quot; concept is consistent with Hinduism&#x27;s notion of &quot;personal God&quot; where the &quot;ideals or manifestation of individual&#x27;s highest Self values that are esteemed&quot;. Schools of Hinduism leave the individual with freedom and choice of conceptualizing Ishvara in any meaningful manner he or she wishes, either in the form of &quot;deity of one&#x27;s choice&quot; or &quot;formless Brahman (Absolute Reality, Universal Principle, true special Self)&quot;.

===In Samkhya===

Samkhya is called one of the major atheistic schools of Hindu philososphy by some scholars. Others, such as Jacobsen, believe Samkhya is more accurately described as non-theistic. Yet others argue that Samkhya has been theistic from its very beginnings until medieval times. Isvara is occasionally affirmed but most often denied in the Samkhya school of Hinduism; for example, arguments are advanced in the Samkhya Pravachana Sutra and its commentaries against the existence of Isvara, chiefly that a being that is both a creator and free cannot exist.

===In Yoga===

The Yogasutras of Patanjali, the foundational text of the Yoga school of Hinduism, uses the term &quot;Ishvara&quot; in 11 verses: I.23 through I.29, II.1, II.2, II.32 and II.45. Ever since the Sutra&#x27;s release, Hindu scholars have debated and commented on who or what is &quot;Isvara&quot;? These commentaries range from defining &quot;Isvara&quot; from a &quot;personal god&quot; to &quot;special self&quot; to &quot;anything that has spiritual significance to the individual&quot;. Whicher explains that while Patanjali&#x27;s terse verses can be interpreted both as theistic or non-theistic, Patanjali&#x27;s concept of &quot;Isvara&quot; in Yoga philosophy functions as a &quot;transformative catalyst or guide for aiding the yogin on the path to spiritual emancipation&quot;.

Patanjali defines &quot;Isvara&quot; (Sanskrit: ईश्वर) in verse 24 of Book 1, as &quot;a special Self (पुरुषविशेष, &quot;puruṣa-viśeṣa&quot;)&quot;,
– Yoga Sutras I.24

This sutra of Yoga philosophy of Hinduism adds the characteristics of &quot;Isvara&quot; as that special Self which is unaffected (अपरामृष्ट, &quot;aparamrsta&quot;) by one&#x27;s obstacles/hardships (क्लेश, &quot;klesha&quot;), one&#x27;s circumstances created by past or one&#x27;s current actions (कर्म, &quot;karma&quot;), one&#x27;s life fruits (विपाक, &quot;vipâka&quot;), and one&#x27;s psychological dispositions/intentions (आशय, ashaya).

Patanjali&#x27;s concept of Isvara is neither a creator God nor the universal Absolute of Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism.

===In Vaisesika===
The Vaiśeṣika school of Hinduism, as founded by Kanada in the 1st millennium BC, neither required nor relied on &quot;Ishvara&quot; for its atomistic naturalism philosophy. To it, substances and &quot;paramāṇu&quot; (atoms) were eternal; they moved and interacted based on impersonal, eternal &quot;adrsta&quot; (अदृष्ट, invisible) laws of nature. The concept of &quot;Ishvara&quot;, among others, entered into Vaisheshika school many centuries later in the 1st millennium AD. This evolution in ideas aimed to explain how and why its so-called &quot;atoms&quot; have a particular order and proportions. These later-age ancient Vaiśeṣika scholars retained their belief that substances are eternal, and added Ishvara as another eternal who is also omniscient and omnipresent (not omnipotent). Ishvara did not create the world, according to this school of Hindu scholars, but He only created invisible laws that operate the world and then He becomes passive and lets those hidden universal laws do their thing. Thus, Vaisheshika&#x27;s Ishvara mirrors Deus otiosus of Deism. Vaisheshika school&#x27;s &quot;Ishvara&quot;, states Klaus Klostermaier, can be understood as an eternal God who co-exists in the universe with eternal substances and atoms, but He &quot;winds up the clock, and lets it run its course&quot;.

===In Nyaya===

Early Nyaya school scholars considered the hypothesis of Ishvara as a creator God with the power to grant blessings, boons and fruits. However, the early Nyaya scholars rejected this hypothesis, though not the existence of God itself, and were non-theistic. Over time, the Nyaya school became one of the most important defenders of theism in Hindu philosophy.

In Nyayasutra&#x27;s Book 4, Chapter 1 examines what causes production and destruction of entities (life, matter) in universe. It considers many hypotheses, including &quot;Ishvara&quot;. Verses 19–21, postulates Ishvara exists and is the cause, states a consequence of postulate, then presents contrary evidence, and from contradiction concludes that the postulate must be invalid.

Centuries later, the 5th century CE Nyaya school scholar Prastapada revisited the premise of Ishvara. He was followed by Udayana, who in his text &quot;Nyayakusumanjali&quot;, interpreted &quot;it&quot; in verse 4.1.21 of Nyaya Sutra above, as &quot;human action&quot; and &quot;him&quot; as &quot;Ishvara&quot;, then he developed counter arguments to prove the existence of Ishvara. In developing his arguments, he inherently defined &quot;Ishvara&quot; as efficient cause, omnipotent, omniscient, infallible, giver of gifts, ability and meaning to humanity, divine creator of the world as well as the moral principles, and the unseen power that makes the karma doctrine work.

===In Mimamsa===

Mīmāṃsā scholars of Hinduism questioned what is &quot;Ishvara&quot; (God)? They used their &quot;pramana&quot; tools to cross-examine answers offered by other schools of Hinduism. For example, when Nyaya scholars stated God is omnipotent, omniscient and infallible, that the world is the result of God&#x27;s creation which is proved by the presence of creatures, just like human work proves human existence, Mimamsa scholars asked, why does this God create the world, for what reason? Further, they added, it cannot be because of Ishvara&#x27;s love for human beings because this world – if Ishvara created it – is imperfect and human Selfs are suffering in it. Mimamsa scholars of Hinduism raised numerous objections to any definition of Ishvara along with its premises. They deconstructed justifications for the concept of &quot;Ishvara&quot; and considered it unnecessary for a consistent philosophy and moksha (spiritual liberation).

===In Vedanta===

====Advaita Vedanta====

The Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism proclaims that at the empirical level Ishvara is the cause of the universe and the one who awards the fruits of every action. He is defined as the one without likes and dislikes, as well embodied with compassion (vaiṣamya Nairgghṛṇya doṣa vihīnaḥ). Ishvara is that which is &quot;free from &quot;avidyā&quot; (ignorance), free from &quot;ahaṃkṛti&quot; (ego-sense), free from &quot;bandhana&quot; (bondage)&quot;, a Self that is &quot;pure, enlightened, liberated&quot;. 
Having accepted and established Ishvara, Advaita Vedanta proclaims that the real nature of Ishvara (existence, consciousness and bliss) is non different from the real nature of an individual. This gives room in Advaita Vedanta to show the nature of Ishvara as both the material and instrumental cause of this universe and the individual who is limited in his own capacities as unreal and declare that there is oneness between the two having negated the qualities. This establishes Ishvara as &#x27;saguṇa&#x27; or with attributes from the empirical existence and &#x27;nirguṇa&#x27; from the absolute sense. This oneness is accepted only at the level of &#x27;mukti&#x27; or ultimate realization and not at the &#x27;vyavahara&#x27; or empirical level. At the absolute level there is no otherness nor distinction between &quot;Jiva&quot; (living being) and &quot;Ishvara&quot;, and any attempts to distinguish the two is a false idea, one based on wrong knowledge, according to Advaita Vedanta.

Other Advaitin Hindu texts resonate with the monist views of Adi Shankara. For example, Isa Upanishad, in hymn 1.5-7, states Ishvara is &quot;above everything, outside everything, beyond everything, yet also within everything&quot;; he who knows himself as all beings and all beings as himself – he never becomes alarmed before anyone. He becomes free from fears, from delusions, from root cause of evil. He becomes pure, invulnerable, unified, free from evil, true to truth, liberated like Ishvara.

When the universe is not manifest, Shankara conceives of Ishvara as abiding in a state of dreamless sleep. The universe&#x27;s manifestation occurs when Ishvara is in a dreaming state, wherein Ishvara is visualizing the universe owing to its memory of previous creations. Just as the state of dreaming is dependent on memory (not separate from the mind), the universe does not have an existence separate from Ishvara. Ishvara&#x27;s knowledge is thus a necessary condition for the existence of the universe.
====Vishishtadvaita Vedanta====

&quot;Ishvara&quot;, in Vishishtadvaita Vedanta sub-school of Hinduism, is a composite concept of dualism and non-dualism, or &quot;non-dualism with differentiation&quot;. Ishvara, Vishishtadvaitin scholars such as the 11th century Ramanuja state, is the supreme creator and synonymous with Brahman. Equated with Vishnu in Vishishtadvaita or one of his avatar, he is both the material and efficient cause, transcendent and immanent. Ishvara manifests in five forms, believe Vishishtadvaitins: &quot;para&quot; (transcendent), &quot;vyuha&quot; (emanations), &quot;vibhava&quot; (incarnations), &quot;antaryamin&quot; (dwells inside), and &quot;arca&quot; (icons). According to this sub-school, states John Grimes, Ishvara possesses six divine qualities: &quot;jnana&quot; (knowledge), &quot;bala&quot; (strength), &quot;aisvarya&quot; (lordship), &quot;sakti&quot; (power), &quot;virya&quot; (virility) and &quot;tejas&quot; (splendor).

Ramanuja&#x27;s Vishishtadvaita concepts provided the foundation for several Bhakti movements of Hinduism, such as those by Sri Aurobindo and has been suggested as having influenced Basava&#x27;s Lingayatism.

====Dvaita Vedanta====

The Dvaita (dualism) sub-school of Vedanta Hinduism, founded by 13th century Madhva, defines &quot;Ishvara&quot; as creator God that is distinct from &quot;Jiva&quot; (individual Selfs in living beings). Narayana (Vishnu) is considered to be &quot;Ishvara&quot;, and the Vaishnavism movement arose on the foundation developed by Dvaita Vedanta sub-school.

&quot;Ishvara&quot; (God) is a complete, perfect and the highest reality to Dvaitins, and simultaneously the world is a separate reality for them, unlike competing thoughts in other sub-schools of Vedanta. In Dvaita sub-school, &quot;Jiva&quot; (individual Self) is different, yet dependent on &quot;Ishvara&quot; (God). Both possess the attributes of consciousness, bliss and existence, but the individual Self is considered atomic, while God is all encompassing. The attributes of &quot;Jiva&quot; struggle to manifest, while of God it is fully manifested.

Madhva states there are five permutations of differences between &quot;Jiva&quot; (individual Self) and &quot;Ishvara&quot; (God): between God and Self, between God and matter, between Self and matter, between one Self and another Self, and between one material thing and another material thing. The differences are both qualitative and quantitative. Unlike Advaita Vedantins who hold that knowledge can lead to Oneness with everyone and everything as well as fusion with the Universal Timeless Absolute, to the state of moksha in this life, Dvaita Vedantins hold that moksha is possible only in after-life if God so wills (if not, then one&#x27;s Self is reborn). Further, Madhva highlights that God creates individual Self, but the individual Self never was and never will become one with God; the best it can do is to experience bliss by getting infinitely close to God.

The world, called &quot;Maya&quot;, is held as the divine will of Ishvara. &quot;Jiva&quot; suffers, experiences misery and bondage, state Dvaitins, because of &quot;ignorance and incorrect knowledge&quot; (&quot;ajnana&quot;). Liberation occurs with the correct knowledge and attainment unto Lord Narayana. It is His grace that gives salvation according to Dvaita sub-school, which is achievable by predominance of &quot;sattva&quot; guna (moral, constructive, simple, kindness-filled life), and therefore Dvaitins must live a dharmic life while constantly remembering, deeply loving &quot;Ishvara&quot;.

====Achintya-Bheda-Abheda====
 is a sub-school of Vedanta representing the philosophy of &quot;inconceivable one-ness and difference&quot;, in relation to the creation, Prakriti, and the creator, Ishvara (Krishna).

In Sanskrit &quot;achintya&quot; means &#x27;inconceivable&#x27;, &quot;bheda&quot; translates as &#x27;difference&#x27;, and &quot;abheda&quot; translates as &#x27;one-ness&#x27;. Self (their English phrase for the Sanskrit word: &quot;jiva&quot;) are considered parts of God, and thus one with Him in quality, and yet at the same time different from Him in quantity. This is called acintya-bheda-abheda-tattva, inconceivable, simultaneous oneness and difference.

Caitanya&#x27;s philosophy of acintya-bhedābheda-tattva is understood to be part of a progression to devotional theism. Rāmānuja had agreed with  that the Absolute is one only, but he had disagreed by affirming individual variety within that oneness. Madhva had underscored the eternal duality of the Supreme and the &quot;jiva&quot;: he had maintained that this duality endures even after liberation. Caitanya, in turn, specified that the Supreme and the jīvas are &quot;inconceivably, simultaneously one and different&quot; (acintya-bheda-abheda).

===In Carvaka===

Cārvāka, another atheist tradition in sramana, was materialist and a school of philosophical scepticism. They rejected all concepts of &quot;Ishvara&quot; as well as all forms of supernaturalism.

<text>Transport Canada () is the department within the Government of Canada responsible for developing regulations, policies and services of road, rail, marine and air transportation in Canada. It is part of the Transportation, Infrastructure and Communities (TIC) portfolio. The current Minister of Transport is Anita Anand. Transport Canada is headquartered in Ottawa, Ontario.

==History==
The Department of Transport was created in 1935 by the government of William Lyon Mackenzie King in recognition of the changing transportation environment in Canada at the time. It merged three departments: the former Department of Railways and Canals, the Department of Marine, and the Civil Aviation Branch of the Department of National Defence (c. 1927 when it replaced the Air Board) under C. D. Howe, who would use the portfolio to rationalize the governance and provision of all forms of transportation (air, water and land). He created a National Harbours Board and Trans-Canada Air Lines. The Department of Transport Act came into force November 2, 1936.

Prior to a 1994 federal government reorganization, Transport Canada had a wide range of operational responsibilities including the Canadian Coast Guard, the Saint Lawrence Seaway, airports and seaports, as well as Via Rail and CN Rail. Significant cuts to Transport Canada at that time resulted in CN Rail being privatized, the coast guard being transferred to Fisheries and Oceans, and the seaway and various ports and airports being transferred to local operating authorities. Transport Canada emerged from this process as a department focused on policy and regulation rather than transportation operations.

In 2004, Transport Canada introduced non-passenger screening to enhance both airport and civil aviation security.

==Headquarters==
Transport Canada&#x27;s headquarters are located in Ottawa at Place de Ville, Tower C. Transport Canada also has regional headquarters in:

* Vancouver – Government of Canada Building, 820-800 Burrard Street
* Edmonton – Canada Place, 9700 Jasper Avenue NW
* Winnipeg – Macdonald Building, 344 Edmonton Street
* Toronto – Government of Canada Building, 4900 Yonge Street
* Montreal – Pierre Elliott Trudeau Airport, 700 Place Leigh-Capreol
* Moncton – Heritage Building, 95 Foundry Street

*Minister of Transport, Anita Anand
**Deputy Minister, Transport Canada, Arun Thangaraj
***Associate Deputy Minister, Brigitte Diogo
**Assistant Deputy Minister, Safety and Security, Lisa Setlawke
***Associate Assistant Deputy Minister, Safety and Security, Nicholas Robinson

**Regional Director General, Quebec Region, Mélanie Morier
**Regional Director General, Ontario Region, Duwayne Williams

==Enforcement==

Transport Canada is responsible for enforcing several Canadian legislation, including the &quot;Aeronautics Act&quot;, &quot;Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, 1992&quot;, &quot;Motor Vehicle Safety Act&quot;, &quot;Canada Transportation Act&quot;, &quot;Railway Safety Act&quot;, &quot;Canada Shipping Act, 2001&quot;, &quot;Marine Transportation Security Act&quot; amongst others. Each inspector with delegated power from the Minister of Transport receives official credentials to exercise their power, as shown on the right. These inspectors are public officers identified within the Criminal Code of Canada.

==Road==

The &quot;Motor Vehicle Safety Act&quot; was established in 1971 in order to create safety standards for cars in Canada. The department also acts as the federal government&#x27;s funding partner with provincial (and territorial) transport ministries on jointly-funded provincial transportation infrastructure projects for new highways.

TC also manage a database of traffic collisions in Canada.
==Rail==

Transport Canada&#x27;s role in railways include:

* railway safety
* surface and intermodal security
* strategies for rail travel accessibility
* safety of federally regulated railway bridges
* safety and security of international bridges and tunnels (US/CAN border)
* Inspecting and testing traffic control signals, grade crossing warning systems
* rail operating rules
* regulations, standards and services for safe transport of dangerous goods
* Canadian Transport Emergency Centre to assist emergency response and handling dangerous goods emergencies

Following allegations by shippers of service level deterioration, on April 7, 2008, the federal government of Canada launched a review of railway freight service within the country. Transport Canada, which is managing the review, plans to investigate the relationships between Canadian shippers and the rail industry, especially with regards to the two largest railroad companies in the country, Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway.
On June 26, 2013, the &quot;Fair Rail Freight Service Act&quot; became law which was a response to the Rail Freight Service Review&#x27;s Final Report.

==Marine==


Transport Canada is responsible for the waterways inside and surrounding Canada. These responsibilities include:

* responding and investigating marine accidents within Canadian waters
* enforcing marine acts and regulations such as the &quot;Canada Marine Act&quot;
* establishing and enforcing marine personnel standards and pilotage
* Marine Safety
* Marine Security
* regulating the operation of marine vessels in Canadian waters

As of 2003 the Office of Boating Safety and the Navigable Waters Protection Program were transferred back to Transport Canada. As was certain regulatory aspects of Emergency Response (Oil pollution)

Transport Canada Marine Safety (TCMS) is the division under Transport Canada that maintains and enhances marine safety and work to protect life, health, property and the marine environment. This includes providing services that are mandated by acts and regulations such as certification for Canadian seafarers and related professionals.

==Aviation==

Transport Canada&#x27;s role in aviation is the most detailed. Until 1996, Transport Canada was responsible for both regulation of aviation and the operation of air traffic services, as well as the operation of most major airports. On November 1, 1996, these responsibilities were split: Transport Canada remains responsible for regulation (through the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs) and Standards), and a new regulated non-profit company, NAV CANADA, took over responsibility for all civilian air traffic services. This change was (and remains) controversial within the private aviation sector because NAV CANADA began charging for services that were previously funded through a specific tax on aviation gasoline. The specific tax remains but separate charges are levied by NAV CANADA.
In 2005, the United States was discussing a similar delegation of the FAA&#x27;s air traffic services to an &quot;arm&#x27;s-length&quot; government corporation.

During the 1990s, Transport Canada also began privatizing the operation of large airports, and divesting itself of small airports altogether (typically handing them over to municipalities). Following the 1994 National Airports Policy, Transport Canada retains ownership of most airports with 200,000 or more annual passenger movements, as well as the primary airports serving the federal, provincial, and territorial capitals, but leases most of these airports (which make up the National Airports System) to outside operators; currently, there are 26 airports in the system, of which 22 are operated by 21 Airport Authorities, an example of which is the Greater Toronto Airports Authority.

In 2003, Transport Canada launched its Electronic Collection of Air Transportation Statistics program to collect passenger and cargo data in real-time from air carriers flying in Canada. ECATS will expand into the field of general aviation during 2008. collects data on all accidents and incidents, no matter how minor, using the Civil Aviation Daily Occurrence Reporting System (CADORS).

Transport Canada continues to be responsible for licensing pilots and other aviation specialists (such as dispatchers and mechanics) as well as registering and inspecting aircraft. It is also responsible for the safety certification and continuous safety oversight of most forms of commercial operations. These responsibilities are carried out by 6 regions, Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, Prairie &amp; Northern, Pacific and the sixth region based in Ottawa (National Capital Region) is responsible for air operators operating international flights and certain types of large aeroplanes. The Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs) are also under Transport Canada control.

The Canadian Air Transport Security Authority is a Crown corporation that reports to parliament through the Minister of Transport. It is responsible for the protection of specific elements of the air transportation system – from passenger and baggage screening to screening airport workers. In spring 2017 CATSA and the Canada Border Services Agency began their roll-out &quot;as part of a broader effort to modernize and streamline clearance procedures at Canadian airports&quot; of the self-service border clearance kiosks programme, under which Canadian travellers are subject to facial recognition technology upon re-entry to the country. It was expected that as a cost-cutting measure the programme was to reduce the number of civilian interactions with civil servants.
===Civil Aviation Authority===

Transport Canada&#x27;s Civil Aviation (TCCA) Directorate is Canada&#x27;s civil aviation authority. It has existed since 1936, when civil aviation was transferred from the Civil Aviation Branch of the Department of National Defence.

Based in Ottawa, the Directorate has regional offices across Canada in geographical regions:

* Pacific – British Columbia
* Prairie and Northern – Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Northwest Territories, Yukon
* Ontario
* Quebec
* Atlantic Region – Nova Scotia, PEI, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick

===Air accident investigation===
Prior to 1990, Transport Canada was responsible for aircraft incident investigation through:

* Aircraft Accident Investigation Branch (1960–1984)
* Canadian Aviation Safety Board (1984–1990)

After 1990, the role was transferred over to Transportation Safety Board of Canada.

===Aircraft fleet===
As of February 2023, Transport Canada lists the following aircraft in its database and operate as ICAO airline designator TGO, and telephony TRANSPORT.

* 10 - Beechcraft C90A
*  1 - Bell206B (helicopter)
*  3 - Bell 407 (helicopter)
*  7 - Bell 412EP (helicopter)
* 16 - Bell 429 (helicopter)
*  6 - Cessna 550 Citation II
*  1 - de Havilland Canada Dash 7-150IR (in 1990 a single aircraft (C-GCFR) replaced two specially modified ice patrol Lockheed L-188 Electra&#x27;s registered as CF-NAY and C-GNDZ (both ex-Northwest Orient Airlines) that were operated under contract (for Ice Reconnaissance) for the Canadian government by Nordair in the late 1970s and later by Canadian Airlines. A second Electra CF-NAZ was written off in 1977 after an accident). and CF-NAX was sold in 1977 by Nordair and now owned by Buffalo Airways as C-FIJX
*  3- Bombardier Dash 8-100 - for Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Canadian Coast Guard

==Recent controversies==

Transport Canada has been the centre of a number of controversies in recent years. In September 2009, the CBC&#x27;s Fifth Estate produced a report &quot;Riding on Risk&quot;, which detailed alleged mismanagement and cover-ups in Transport Canada. The story was sparked by a lost memory stick which was found by a journalism student. The memory stick contained many documents showing efforts by security inspectors to enforce aviation security regulations, and the perceived failure of management to do so. The CBC report also detailed the alleged reprisals — and fear of reprisals — against whistleblowers and other employees.

Transport Canada&#x27;s move to Safety Management Systems (SMS) in its regulation of civil aviation has been criticised. Whistleblower Hugh Danford, a former inspector at Transport Canada, went on record criticizing this approach, indicating that it would increase risk to the flying public. Critics have warned that introducing SMS to the aviation sector is &quot;a recipe for disaster&quot;. However, the aviation accident rate in Canada declined over a number of years to 2008.

The rail industry in Canada, which has had SMS since 2001 and is also regulated by Transport Canada, had shown a marked increase in accidents under this regulatory scheme to 2006.

Several Transport Canada senior executives, including Assistant Deputy Minister, Safety and Security, Marc Grégoire, were sued in 2008 for reprisals against another whistleblower, Ian Bron. who reported that the Marine Security framework was riddled with gaps.

On 23 December 2013, it was revealed that a Transport Canada inspector had been dismissed for falsifying departmental reports. The identity of the guilty party was not revealed, because of a concern for his or her privacy.

The Canadian Association of Journalists nominated Transport Canada for its Secrecy Award for a second time in 2008, indicating that a bill to amend the &quot;Aeronautics Act&quot; will cause &quot;a veil of secrecy [to] fall over all information reported by airlines about performance, safety violations, aviation safety problems and their resolution.&quot;

In September 2009, Transport Canada was alleged to have fraudulently charged expenses to the non-existent Mackenzie Valley Pipeline project. This story came to light after repeated efforts by access to information expert Ken Rubin, and repeated denials by the department that the incriminating documents existed or that any impropriety had occurred.

Transport Canada was criticized in 2008 for its refusal to approve electric cars manufactured in Canada.

In 2017, Transport Canada proposed regulations for drones that were widely criticized.

As a result of the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash and the Lion Air Flight 610 crash, which occurred five months prior to the Ethiopian crash, most airlines and countries began grounding the Boeing 737 MAX 8 (and in many cases all MAX variants) due to safety concerns, but Transport Canada declined to temporarily ground Boeing 737 Max 8 operating in Canada. However, on 13 March, Transport Canada reversed the decision and grounded all 737 MAX 8 and MAX 9 aircraft.

<text>Michael Chung (1950 – 28 December 2021) also known as Mao Chung, was a Jamaican musician who played keyboards, guitar and percussion instruments. He was also an arranger and record producer of Jamaican music, and worked with a wide array of musicians, notably Lee Perry and Sly and Robbie.

==Life and career==
Chung was born in Christiana, Jamaica, in 1950. He was of Chinese Jamaican descent, and grew up on Tewari Crescent in Kingston, Jamaica. He later moved with his family to the Vineyard Town area of the city, attending St. George&#x27;s College. He began his career in music as the guitarist for the Mighty Mystics, The Virtues (1967–69), Generation Gap, and the Federal Studios house band the Now Generation Band, before playing with artists such as Jacob Miller and Inner Circle in the 1970s. As a member of Word, Sound and Power from 1978, along with Sly &amp; Robbie, he backed Peter Tosh on &quot;Mystic Man&quot;, &quot;Wanted Dread and Alive&quot;, and &quot;Bush Doctor&quot;, playing guitar and synthesizer. He played for Lee Perry&#x27;s band The Upsetters (?-1975?-?), and the Compass Point All Stars (Island Records). He often accompanied Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare on their recordings and played guitar for Black Uhuru on their albums &quot;Anthem&quot;, &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Chill Out&quot;.

He worked with many Jamaican and international artists, including Maxi Priest, Grace Jones, the Rolling Stones, Serge Gainsbourg, Bette Midler, Big Mountain, Art Ensemble of Chicago, James Brown, Garnett Silk, Joe Cocker and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor.

Chung was the brother of keyboardist/producer Geoffrey Chung, and had one daughter, Katharine. He died from myeloma in Kingston, Jamaica on 28 December 2021, at the age of 71.

<doc id="1201820" wikidata="Q851164" url="?curid=1201820" title="Corvinus University of Budapest">
<text>Corvinus University of Budapest () is a private research university in Budapest, Hungary. The university currently has an enrolment of approximately 9,600 students, with a primary focus on business administration, economics, and social sciences, operating in Budapest and Székesfehérvár since 1948. Corvinus University accepts students at six faculties and offer courses leading to degrees at the bachelor, master and doctoral level in specialisations taught in Hungarian, English, French or German.

Considered to be one of the most prestigious and selective universities in Hungary, Corvinus alumni include a former prime minister of Hungary, governors of the Hungarian National Bank as well as various members of the Hungarian political and business elite.

==History==
In 1846, József Industrial School opened its gates with departments for economics and trade for upper grade students. The immediate forerunner of the Corvinus University of Budapest, the Faculty of Economics of the Royal Hungarian University, was established in 1920. The faculty was an independent organization that was granted the same status as faculties of other universities.

In 1934, the faculty was merged with other institutions including the University of Technology to form the Hungarian Royal Palatine Joseph University of Technology and Economics. Modern economist training began in 1948, when the Hungarian University of Economics was established as a separate universitas. Since then, the institution has undergone multiple name changes. In 1953 it was renamed Karl Marx University of Economic Sciences. In 1990 the political system changed in Hungary. After 43 years, democratic and free parliamentary elections were held. Following that the name of the university was changed to the University of Economics of Budapest.

In 2000, with the integration of the College of Public Administration, the institution was named Budapest University of Economic Sciences and Public Administration (BUESPA). The College of Public Administration was founded in 1977.

In 2003, the three faculties of the former University of Horticulture (then part of the Szent István University) were integrated into the BUESPA. The first predecessor of the horticulture faculties, the School for practical Gardening (1853–1860) was the first institution of horticultural professional training in Hungary. The school was founded and managed by the horticultural scholar and publicist Dr Ferenc Entz (1805–1877), who was also a corresponding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In 1939 an independent Royal Horticultural Academy was launched. It included three departments: agriculture, horticulture and landscape architecture. The latter was one of a kind in Hungary at the time.

In 2004, the university received its present name. The name the Corvinus University of Budapest refers to the name of Corvinae (codices). Bibliotheca Corviniana was one of the most renowned libraries of the Renaissance world, established in the 15th century by King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary.

The Faculty of Public Administration was appended to the newly formed National University of Public Service on 1 January 2012.

From 2013 Corvinus University of Budapest offered a Summer School program.

In February 2019, the government announced that it would place Corvinus University under the newly created Maecenas Universitatis Corvini Foundation from July 2019. The foundation will be allocated 10% of the government&#x27;s stake in MOL and Gedeon Richter worth HUF 380 billion at the time, with the operational expenses to be paid with the dividends from these companies.

The new appointed rector became Előd Takáts on 1 August 2021, parallel with the change of control of the university, replacing András Lánczi after his six-year term.

==Faculties and programmes==
At the Corvinus University, 11,500 students are enrolled in bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, single-cycle, postgraduate specialisation and doctoral programmes.

The teaching activities previously organised under the faculties have been restructured for the 2019/20 academic year and have become institutionalised. Under the direction of the institutes, training is divided into departments. As of 2023/24 the institutes were as follows.
* Institute of Data Analytics and Information Systems
* Institute of Sustainable Development
* Institute of Global Studies
* Institute of Economics
* Institute of Marketing and Communication Studies
* Institute of Operations and Decision Sciences
* Institute of Finance
* Institute of Accounting and Law
* Institute of Social and Political Sciences
* Institute of Entrepreneurship and Innovation
* Institute of Strategy and Management
At Corvinus University of Budapest, doctoral studies currently cover seven fields of study:
* Doctoral School of Business and Management
* Doctoral School of Economics, Business, and Informatics
* Doctoral School of International Relations and Political Science
* Doctoral School of Sociology and Communication Science
The majority of courses are taught in English due to the growing internationalisation process based on an increasing number of foreign students.

==Setting and architecture==

The university is in an urban setting. The faculties operate in multiple buildings that stand in the city centre of Budapest.

The university&#x27;s main building (Building E)– now part of the UNESCO Heritage Site – is located in Pest on the left bank of the Danube, next to the Great Market Hall and facing the Budapest University of Technology and Economics on the river&#x27;s other bank. The main building was planned by Miklós Ybl as the Main Customs Office in Neo-Renaissance style. It was finished in 1874. The building was called &quot;Vámház&quot; (Customs House) and &quot;Fővámpalota&quot; (Chief Customs Palace). This is also the name of the nearby avenue. The building was connected to ports of the Danube by four tunnels. It had a railroad connection. During WW2 the Hungarian, German and Soviet troops used the building as a military base. The Customs House suffered serious damage during the war. In 1948 it became the main building of the University of Economics. It underwent major renovations in 1950 and later in 1989–1990.

Much of the education of the business faculties (Faculty of Business Administration, Economics, Social Sciences) takes place in the main building. This is the location of the rector&#x27;s offices as well. Next to the main building is the S(alt)-building (Sóház), and behind that is the C-Building.
The university&#x27;s Közraktár Street building was completed in 2007. It offers of floor space, which includes an office building and education areas. The building has community areas, and hosts the 450-seat central library of the university which contains 100,000 books and journals.

==Research==
The Regional Centre for Energy Policy Research was established in 2004. The three main pillars of the Research Centre are education, research and consultancy. Their analysis focuses mainly on electricity and natural gas markets. They have been working on water management issues since 2007 and on transport issues since 2017.

In 2018, the Corvinus Institute for Advanced Studies (CIAS), an international research centre, was established to strengthen Corvinus&#x27; scientific performance and international embeddedness. There are more than 20 research centres operating besides them at the university.

Several research-related journals (&quot;Society and Economy&quot;, &quot;Vezetéstudomány&quot; [Management], &quot;Corvinus Journal of Sociology and Social Policy&quot;, &quot;Corvinus Journal of International Affair&quot;s, and &quot;Köz-Gazdaság&quot; [Public Economy]) and publications (e.g. workshop series: Corvinus Economic Working Papers RePEc, and Corvinus Law Papers) are published by the university.

==Awards and rankings==
In 2010, Corvinus won the Higher Education Quality Award in the Higher Education Institutions category. Its business majors are not only among the leading universities in Hungary, but are also internationally recognised: the university was ranked first in the region in 2019 by Eduniversal and second in 2020, and in 2019 it was ranked among the 100 best business schools in Europe by the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, while the university&#x27;s master&#x27;s degree in Regional and Environmental Management was ranked 36th in the category of Sustainable Development and Environmental Management, also by Eduniversal.

The university was listed in the top 50 in the &quot;Financial Times&quot; European Masters in Management rankings, and was the first Hungarian university mentioned among the best in the area of agriculture.

==Specialised colleges==
The specialised colleges conduct in-depth research on a number of specialised subjects (e.g. social theory and finance), sometimes with the involvement of external academics or economic operators. Members usually live together on a separate floor of their university hall of residence or in a separate building. This promotes active community life and shared learning and research.

The most significant of the university&#x27;s specialised colleges in 2020 are:

* Rajk László College for Advanced Studies
* Széchenyi István College for Advanced Studies
* College for Advanced Studies in Social Theory (Társadalomelméleti Kollégium, TEK)
* EVK College for Advanced Studies
* Heller Farkas College for Advanced Studies
* Society of Young Autonomous Economists (FAKT)
* College for Advanced Studies of Diplomacy in Practice (GyDSz)

<doc id="1201822" wikidata="Q3795408" url="?curid=1201822" title="The Squire's Tale">
<text>&quot;The Squire&#x27;s Tale&quot; is a tale in Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. It is unfinished, because it is interrupted by the next story-teller, the Franklin, who then continues with his own prologue and tale. The Squire is the Knight&#x27;s son, a novice warrior and lover with more enthusiasm than experience. His tale is an epic romance, which, if completed, would probably have been longer than rest of the &quot;Tales&quot; combined. It contains many literary allusions and vivid descriptions.
The original source of the tale remains unknown. According to some critics the source of the tale is &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot;.

==Plot==
Genghis Khan (&quot;Cambyuskan&quot; in Chaucer&#x27;s version) leads the Mongol Empire with two sons, Algarsyf and Cambalo, and a daughter, Canace. At the twentieth anniversary of his reign, he holds a feast, and a strange knight sent from &quot;the kyng of Arabe and of Inde&quot; approaches him bearing gifts, a motif common in Arthurian legends. These are a brass horse with the power of teleportation, a mirror which can reveal the minds of the king&#x27;s friends and enemies, a ring which confers understanding of the language of birds (as some legends say King Solomon owned), and a sword which deals deadly wounds that only its touch can heal again (both the spear of Achilles and the Holy Lance have these powers). After much learned talk of the gifts, digressing into astrology, the first part of the tale ends.

A subplot of the tale deals with Canace and her ring. Eagerly rising the next morning, she goes on a walk and discovers a grieving falcon. The falcon tells Canace that she has been abandoned by her false lover, a tercelet (male hawk), who left her for a kite. (In medieval falconry, kites were birds of low status.) Canace heals the bird and builds a mew, or coop for it, which is painted on the outside blue for true faith within and green for falsity, and with pictures of deceitful birds. (This description of deceitful birds is similar to the images painted on the garden walls in the &quot;Romance of the Rose&quot;.)

The second part ends with a promise of more to come involving Genghis Khan&#x27;s sons and the quest of Cambalo to win Canace as his wife. When the Squire briefly describes the third part of the story that he is about to tell, there is a hint that in it Canace and her brothers will commit incest, as happens in John Gower&#x27;s version of the story. However, it is unlikely that Chaucer intended to finish the tale. Instead the Franklin breaks into the beginning of the third section with elaborate praise of the Squire&#x27;s gentility—the Franklin being something of a social climber—and proceeds to his own tale.

==Criticism and continuations==
Early critics were admiring of the Squire&#x27;s tale. John Milton was convinced that Chaucer had intended to conclude it. Authors of the Elizabethan period, including Edmund Spenser, used characters from the tale in their own works; some, like John Lane, wrote complete continuations of it.

In general, modern critics have not paid it much attention, and consider it Chaucer&#x27;s way of poking gentle fun at the young Squire&#x27;s love of romance literature, which frequently contains somewhat pretentious digressions, and his lack of narrative self-control. Compared to the tale told by his father, the Knight, which is formal, serious, and complete, the rambling and fantastical story shows the Squire&#x27;s inexperience. Some critics see the gifts as symbolic of the powers of poetry, which the Squire is still learning to use.

There is no clear source for the story, which is a collection of ideas and themes from many romances, as befits the Squire, a lover of such literature. The extravagant details on Eastern kingdoms come from the travel literature of the time, such as Giovanni da Pian del Carpine, Simon of St Quentin and John Mandeville. The episode of the falcon and the tercelet is similar to part of &quot;Anelida and Arcite&quot;, an early work of Chaucer&#x27;s.

<text>Philip Arthur Barker (22 August 1920 – 8 January 2001) was a British archaeologist who is best known for his work on excavation methodology.

== Education ==
He left school with no qualifications and served in the RAF during the Second World War before he trained as a teacher. He taught Art at the Priory Grammar School for Boys, Shrewsbury and established an archaeological society at the school, which conducted a large number of excavations in the area, including a section of the town walls at Roushill in Shrewsbury.

== Career ==
His interest in archaeology led him to become an academic at the University of Birmingham. For many years, he was the archaeologist at Worcester Cathedral, where he organised a regular symposium on church archaeology and history.

During the 1970s and the 1980s, he worked to help establish Rescue and the Institute of Field Archaeologists and undertook excavation work at Wroxeter and Hen Domen. He served as the chair of the Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust from 1984 to 1991.

He wrote a comprehensive guide to field archaeology, &quot;Techniques of Archaeological Excavation&quot;, in 1977, and it remains in print.

Barker specialised in castle studies and in 1987 was a founding member of the Castle Studies Group. The excavations at Hen Domen led to the publication of a book about the project and another about timber castles more broadly, jointly written with Robert Higham.

<doc id="1201825" wikidata="Q1900245" url="?curid=1201825" title="Mark Mallory">
<text>Mark Mallory (born April 2, 1962) is an American politician who served as the 68th Mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the first two-term Mayor under the City&#x27;s new Stronger-Mayor system, the first directly elected African-American mayor, the third African-American mayor, and the first mayor in more than 70 years who did not come from City Council.

Mallory works for FC Cincinnati as the Director of Community Development.

==Early life and education==
Mallory was born and raised in West End, Cincinnati. He graduated from the Cincinnati Academy of Math and Science and holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Administrative Management from the University of Cincinnati. Mayor Mallory began his career in public service as a book shelver at the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County. He worked there 14 years at a variety of positions, rising to Manager of Graphic Production and Assistant to the head of public relations.

==Career==
Prior to his election in 2005, he served as assistant Minority Leader in the Ohio Senate. He won a seat in the Ohio House of Representatives in 1994, replacing his father who retired after serving the district for nearly 30 years. He served in the Ohio House from 1995 to 1998, when he was elected to the Senate.

In November 1998, Mark Mallory was elected to represent the 9th Senate District in the Ohio General Assembly, and in 2002 was elected to his second four-year term. He was the Assistant Minority Leader for the Senate Democratic Caucus during his seven years in the General Assembly. In 2003, Senator Mallory passed a resolution in the General Assembly ratifying the 14th Amendment, 135 years after it was amended to the US Constitution.

Mallory resigned his senate seat in 2005 to run for Mayor of Cincinnati. He defeated fellow Democrat David Pepper to win the election. Mallory was elected to a second term as Mayor in 2009.

===Opening day pitch debacle===
On April 2, 2007, Mallory was scheduled to throw the ceremonial first pitch for the Cincinnati Reds&#x27; game on Opening Day. Despite claims that he had trained with the University of Cincinnati baseball team, his pitch flew thirty feet to the first base side of home plate, missing the intended target, Eric Davis. The ball hit the foot of umpire Sam Holbrook, who ejected Mallory before the contest even began. The pitch received national media attention, including appearances on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;Cold Pizza&quot;, and Mallory was given a second chance on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, but again failed to come anywhere close to the target with his throw. He was given a &quot;second, second-chance&quot; and finally completed a toss to actor Kurt Russell. Mallory took the incident as an opportunity to advertise the city of Cincinnati.

== Personal life ==
Mallory&#x27;s brother William L. Mallory Jr. is a Municipal Court judge, his brother Dwane Mallory is a Municipal Court Judge, his brother Dale Mallory was the State Representative in the Ohio House District once held by the Mayor and his father, and his brother Joe Mallory is the President of the Cincinnati chapter of NAACP. He is the son of former Ohio House of Representatives Majority Leader William L. Mallory Sr.

<text>Willis Alston Jr. (1769April 10, 1837) was a politician and planter from North Carolina. A member of the Democratic-Republican Party and later a Jacksonian, he served as a U.S. Representative in the 6th to the 13th Congresses (1799–1815) and the 19th to the 21st Congresses (1825–1831). He was the nephew of Nathaniel Macon.

==Early life==
Willis Alston was born in 1769 near Littleton in the Province of North Carolina.

==Career==
Alston engaged in agricultural pursuits at his slave plantation, Butterwood Plantation. He was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons in 1790 and served for two years; in 1794 he was elected to a single term in the North Carolina Senate.

In 1798, Alston was elected as a Federalist to the U.S. House, defeating incumbent Thomas Blount and two other candidates. Alston served from March 4, 1799, to March 4, 1815. Early in the Jefferson administration, Alston changed parties and became affiliated with the Republican Party. Local Federalists recruited former Gov. William R. Davie to challenge Alston in 1803, but Alston survived Davie&#x27;s challenge. Alston chaired the House Committee on Revisal and Unfinished Business during the 13th U.S. Congress. In the election of April 1813, Alston defeated Daniel Mason, the Peace candidate, with the smallest margin of his re-election campaigns (56%-44%), and Alston retired at the end of the term.

He returned to the state House of Commons between 1820 and 1824, and then returned to Washington in 1825, elected as a Jacksonian Democrat. Serving three terms (March 4, 1825 – March 4, 1831), Alston chaired the Committee on Elections during the 21st Congress. He declined to seek re-election in 1830 and returned to agriculture.

==Relationship with John Randolph==
Alston and John Randolph of Roanoke had an intense dislike for each other, and once had a pitched fight in a Washington boarding house, where heated words led to them throwing tableware at each other. Six years later, they fought again in a stairwell at the House after Alston loudly referred to Randolph as a &quot;puppy&quot;. Randolph beat Alston bloody with his cane and the two had to be separated by other congressmen. Randolph was fined $20 for this breach of the peace.

==Death and legacy==
Alston died on April 10, 1837, in Halifax and is buried at his plantation home of &quot;Butterwood&quot;, near Littleton. His granddaughter, Missouri Alston Pleasants, established the Alston-Pleasants scholarship fund in his memory.

In his will, he divided up ownership of his approximately 90 slaves among his family members.

<text>Lauchlin Bethune (April 15, 1785 – October 10, 1874) was a slave owner and U.S. Congressman from North Carolina between 1831 and 1833.

Born near Fayetteville, North Carolina in 1785, Bethune attended private schools and the Lumberton Male Academy. Elected to the North Carolina Senate in 1817, 1818, 1822 to 1825, and 1827, Bethune rose to the U.S. House in 1830 as a Jacksonian Democrat. Defeated for re-election in 1832, Bethune only served one term in Congress (March 4, 1831 – March 3, 1833). After losing two additional attempts to return to Congress in 1834 and 1836, Bethune returned to his slave plantation near Fayetteville and resumed the practice of agriculture; he owned thirty-eight slaves by the 1860 census.

He is buried in the Bethesda Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Aberdeen, North Carolina.

<doc id="1201833" wikidata="Q7702134" url="?curid=1201833" title="Teresa Fedor">
<text>Teresa Fedor (born May 2, 1956) is an American politician from Ohio. She was a member of the Ohio Senate, representing the 11th district from 2019 until her resignation in 2022. A member of the Ohio General Assembly since 2001, Fedor previously represented the same seat in the Senate from 2003 to 2010, and was a member of the Ohio House of Representatives for five nonconsecutive terms, serving from 2001 to 2002, and again from 2011 to 2018. A Democrat, Fedor represented Toledo and the surrounding areas.

==Life and career==
Fedor holds a bachelor of science degree in education from the University of Toledo. She served in the U.S. Air Force and Ohio Air National Guard for 6 and a half years.

In 2000, Fedor ran against incumbent Jim Mettler for a seat in the Ohio House, and defeated the incumbent with 55.6% of the vote. She served in the House for a single term. Fedor was named Public Servant of the Year in 2002 by the Ohio Environmental Council.

With incumbent Linda J. Furney unable to run again due to term limits, Fedor opted to run for the Ohio Senate in 2002 instead of seeking a second term in the House. Unopposed in the primary, she defeated Republican Phillip Barbosa with 72.3% of the vote. She served as assistant minority whip in the 125th General Assembly. Fedor won reelection in 2006 unopposed.

For the 127th General Assembly, Fedor&#x27;s fellow Senate Democrats chose her to serve as Minority Leader. However, in early 2008, Fedor was ousted in a political coup by Senator Ray Miller, who had organized a coalition to replace her with himself. As a result, Fedor served the remainder of her Senate career without a leadership position.

She resigned on October 31, 2022 to focus on her race for the Ohio State Board of Education 2nd District.

==Ohio House of Representatives, Second Tenure==
In 2009, Fedor stated that she would be a candidate for the Ohio House of Representatives in 2010, to replace the term limited Peter Ujvagi. However, Ujvagi resigned early after he was hired as Lucas County Administrator.

The appointment of Ujvagi set up what many thought was going to be a legislative shuffle, where Fedor was appointed to Ujvagi&#x27;s seat, and Representative Edna Brown then appointed to Fedor&#x27;s Senate seat. However, this plan was foiled when Toledo City Councilman Joe McNamara opted also to be appointed to the Senate. As a result, Fedor kept her seat, Brown hers, and Joe Walter was appointed to a nine-month stint in Ujvagi&#x27;s seat.

Nonetheless, Fedor was elected to the House seat, winning 64.37% of the vote in 2010. She began her first term on January 3, 2011.

== Ohio Senate, Second Tenure ==
In 2018, Fedor opted to again swap chambers and run for her old seat in the state Senate, to succeed Edna Brown who was term-limited. She again won the seat and was sworn into office on January 6, 2019. She resigned on October 31, 2022.

Fedor is also a member of the Ohio Attorney General&#x27;s Human Trafficking Commission.

==Initiatives, policies and positions==

===Human trafficking===

One of Fedor&#x27;s landmark legislative victories relates to human trafficking. She has stated, &quot;Traffickers have walked away from the halls of justice,&quot; and has vowed to help stop and continue to fight for those victimized as victims. She has received support from former Ohio Governors Ted Strickland and John Kasich on stopping human trafficking, and has successfully passed one measure.

Along with then Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, Fedor introduced the safe harbor bill, which would prevent a young person with being charged with prostitution if they were victims of human trafficking. She has stated it is a critical portion of tackling the problem.

===Education===

Fedor has also voiced concerns over the elimination of some education measures that would eliminate all-day kindergarten requirements. While new legislation has come forth to give more communities education choices, Fedor has stated that she thinks districts were offered some choice with the waiver for all-day kindergarten that were provided in the past.

===Economic issues===

Fedor opposed initiatives to raise funds by selling rights to state lands, including state parks to drill for crude oil and natural gas. &quot;Our picture-perfect parks in Ohio may certainly … be turned into picture-perfect toxic wastelands,&quot;she had stated. The General Assembly ultimately voted for allowing for oil exploration on state lands.

===Abortion===

On 25 March 2015, Fedor got so frustrated during a debate on abortion in the lower chamber of the state&#x27;s legislature that she stood up and revealed that she had been raped and terminated the resulting pregnancy.
&quot;You don&#x27;t respect my reason, my rape, my abortion, and I guarantee you there are other women who should stand up with me and be courageous enough to speak,&quot; she said. &quot;What you&#x27;re doing is so fundamentally inhuman, unconstitutional, and I&#x27;ve sat here too long.&quot;
Fedor was raped many years ago, while she was in the military.

The so-called heartbeat bill that was being discussed in the Ohio legislature at the time would have doctors test for a heartbeat in the fetus, which could be as early as six weeks into the pregnancy. If one is detected, and the doctor proceeds with the abortion, they would face felony charges. If the bill becomes law, it would ban all abortions, except when the pregnancy endangered the mother&#x27;s life or health, but including cases of rape and incest. The bill passed, 50 votes to 44.

<text>Tom Roberts is an Ohio Democratic politician who formerly served as a member of the Ohio General Assembly.

==Career==
===Ohio House of Representatives===
When Ed Orlett resigned from the Ohio House of Representatives in 1986, House Democrats appointed Roberts to serve the remainder of his term. He went on to win election that same November, and again in 1988 and 1990.

In 1992, Roberts was challenged by his predecessor, Ed Orlett, for the Democratic nomination, however Roberts ultimately won the primary election. He went on to win reelection in 1994, and 1996 as well.

===State Senate===
By 1998, term limits did not allow Roberts to seek another term in 2000, and he was succeeded by his former aide, Fred Strahorn. He instead decided to run for Montgomery County Commissioner, but lost in a landslide.

Following Rhine McLin&#x27;s victory to become Mayor of Dayton, Ohio, in 2001, her state Senate seat became vacant. As a result, Roberts was appointed to serve the remainder of her term, and went on to win his own full term in 2002. He won reelection in 2006 and served as assistant minority leader in the 127th General Assembly.

===Ohio Civil Rights Commission===
By 2009, Roberts was unable to run again for his Senate seat. As a result, Ohio Governor Ted Strickland appointed Roberts to the Ohio Civil Rights Commission. He therefore was required to resign his Senate seat, and was replaced again by Fred Strahorn.

===NAACP involvement===
On September 9, 2017, the Ohio Conference NAACP held its biennial election with terms commencing on September 9, 2017, and expiring on September 14, 2019. Roberts, 2nd Vice President of the Dayton Unit of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People NAACP, was elected to serve as President of the Ohio Conference NAACP. Roberts defeated Arlene Anderson, Secretary of the Cleveland Unit NAACP and received 68.85% of the votes.

On September 14, 2019, the Ohio Conference NAACP held its biennial election with terms commencing on September 14, 2019, and expiring on September 11, 2021. Roberts was re-elected to serve as President of the Ohio Conference NAACP. Roberts defeated Arlean Anderson, of Cleveland, Ohio and received 87.30% of the votes.

<text>Robert Franklin Armfield (July 9, 1829 – November 9, 1898) was the Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina from 1875 to 1876, and a U.S. Representative from North Carolina between 1879 and 1883.

==Biography==
Armfield, born near Greensboro, North Carolina in 1829, attended the common schools and later graduated from Trinity College (now Duke University). After reading law with John A. Gilmer, he was admitted to the bar in 1845 and practiced law in Yadkinville.

In 1861, at the outbreak of the American Civil War, Armfield enlisted in the Confederate States Army. He served as lieutenant and later as lieutenant colonel of the Thirty-eighth Regiment of North Carolina state troops. After the war, Armfield moved to Statesville and resumed his law practice.

While on furlough from the Army after being wounded in 1862, Armfield was state solicitor for the sixth district, until he was removed in 1865 by Governor William Woods Holden. He was elected to the North Carolina Senate in 1874 and 1875; during the 1874 session, he was Senate President. Armfield was chosen Lieutenant Governor of North Carolina and served in that post from 1875 to 1876.

In 1878, Armfield was elected to the United States House of Representatives and served two terms, in the 46th and 47th United States Congresses (March 4, 1879 – March 3, 1883). He did not stand for re-election to the House in 1882, but instead resumed his law practice. In 1889, he was appointed and then elected to a term as a superior court judge, a post he held until his death in Statesville on November 9, 1898. Armfield is buried in Statesville&#x27;s Oakwood Cemetery.

<doc id="1201876" wikidata="Q92269" url="?curid=1201876" title="Gerhard Bersu">
<text>Gerhard Bersu (26 September 1889 – 19 November 1964) was a German archaeologist who excavated widely across Europe. He was forced into exile from Germany in 1937 due to anti-Semitic laws in pre-war Nazi Germany. He was interned on the Isle of Man during World War II where he made several significant archaeological discoveries such as the Viking boat burial at Balladoole.

== Early life ==
He was born in Jauer in Silesia in 1889 to a Jewish father. He was interested in prehistory from a young age and began his archaeological career while still a school boy, by joining in Carl Schuchhardt&#x27;s excavations near Potsdam in 1907.

In successive years Bersu dug in several European countries such as France, Switzerland, Italy, and Greece. He worked under Hubert Schmidt in the excavations at Cucuteni. Romania.

During the First World War he worked for the Office for the Protection of Monuments and Collections on the Western Front. After the war he was attached to the German Armistice and Peace delegations.

In 1924 he began working with the German Archaeological Institute at Frankfurt-am-Main. In 1928 he became the institution&#x27;s Second Director and oversaw the acquisition of new buildings. He rose to the position of Director in 1931 and the institution became a &quot;centre at which scholars from all Europe and beyond met to discuss the problems of archaeology&quot; under his guidance.

After the Nuremberg Laws were passed in 1935, Bersu was forced to resign his post as a director due to his Jewish heritage. He was reassigned to a lower position at the German Archaeological Institute as Officer of Excavations, Berlin in 1935 and then was forced to retire later that year.

== Little Woodbury excavations ==

Following his forced resignation from the German Archaeological Institute and the worsening anti-Semitic laws in Germany Bersu emigrated to Britain with his wife in 1937.

At the invitation of British archaeologist Osbert Crawford as the president of the Prehistoric Society, Bersu conducted excavations in 1938 and 1939 at Little Woodbury in Wiltshire, introducing novel continental methods to the study of British prehistoric sites. The site had been first identified as a crop mark from an aerial photograph of the area, but it was not until Bersu&#x27;s excavations that the significance of the site was realised.

Bersu&#x27;s systematic investigation was revolutionary for its time in England, and his excavation helped to reinterpret earlier misconceptions of Iron Age Britain. Before Bersu&#x27;s investigations, it was believed that the inhabitants of these sites lived in holes in the ground due to the discovery of dug pits from similar sites. But Bersu&#x27;s identification of cereal grains and animals bones showed that these were storage pits for food, and the discovery of large postholes helped Bersu to convince British archaeologists that the inhabitants lived in a large Iron Age roundhouse that was also excavated on the site.

Bersu also introduced new methods from continental Europe regarding the digging of trenches and the investigation of timber post remains that were one of the few remnants of the domestic dwellings on the site.

== Internment ==

Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, Bersu and his wife were interned on the Isle of Man as &quot;enemy aliens&quot; with other German-born residents. Initially they were separated, with neither aware of the others location, with Maria in Rushen Camp, and Bersu in Hutchinson Internment Camp, Douglas. But in October 1940, they were reunited when interned married couples were permitted to meet at Derby Castle in Douglas. Later they were able to live together at Rushen Camp, which was Europe&#x27;s only internment camp for married couples during World War II.

Director of the Manx Museum, Basil Megaw immediately saw the potential of having Bersu investigate some of the Isle of Man&#x27;s significant archaeological sites. Bersu&#x27;s fellow archaeologists and friends such Gordon Childe and Christopher Hawkes lobbied on his behalf to allow excavations on the Island to be conducted.

Bersu was allowed to continue his research with the help of other internees and his wife Maria who did much of the recording of the excavation. They excavated a number of later prehistoric and Viking‐age sites and several important discoveries were made at Chapel Hill at Balladoole, Ballanorris, Ronaldsway, and Ballacagan. At Balladoole, Bersu expected to excavate an Iron Age hill fort, but instead also discovered Mesolithic remains; a Bronze Age cist; a Christian keeill (a small chapel); a Christian burial ground, and a Viking Age boat burial. The discovery of additional human remains at Ballateare and Balladoole have been interpreted as examples of Viking ritual slave sacrifice.

Most of Bersu&#x27;s investigations on the Isle of Man were at locations accessible by public transports, as neither he nor any of the other internees had cars. As Bersu used fellow internees for the excavations, however despite the presence of armed guards, they were not permitted to use pickaxes. Instead, the digging was done with trowels.

Bersu and his wife continued living and excavating on the Isle of Man after the end of World War II until 1947.

== Later years ==
When the war ended Bersu was offered the Chair of the Royal Irish Academy in Dublin and remained there until 1950 when he returned to Germany. Taking up his former post at the Institute he continued his work until retiring in 1956.

Bersu excavated at the settlement of Green Craig, Creich, Fife in 1947.

Bersu died suddenly while attending a meeting of the German Academy of Sciences in Magdeburg.

<text>Marc E. Dann (born March 12, 1962) is an American former politician of the Democratic Party, who served as the Attorney General of Ohio from 2007 until his resignation on May 14, 2008.

==Law career and state Senate==

Dann earned a B.A. in 1984 from the University of Michigan and a J.D. degree in 1987 from Case Western Reserve University. He practiced law in Youngstown, Ohio, and became active in Democratic Party politics.

Dann ran for the Ohio state Senate in the district then comprising Trumbull and Geauga counties. He finished third in the party primary behind eventual winner Tim Ryan and a local township trustee. From 2001 to 2002, Dann served as a member of the Liberty Local School District board of education.

After Ryan won election to the Ohio State Senate in 2002, Dann convinced the state Senate&#x27;s Democratic caucus to appoint him to fill the balance of Ryan&#x27;s term. He easily won election to a full term in 2004. He was reprimanded in 2004 by the Ohio Supreme Court for handling a 2002 alimony case without proper preparation.

Dann was a leading figure in the exposure of a variety of ethics and criminal scandals in the administration of Republican Governor Bob Taft, who became the first sitting governor in Ohio history to plead guilty to a crime. Dann was a leading critic of &quot;Coingate,&quot; an investment plan in which $50 million of the state&#x27;s workers compensation reserve fund was given to Republican Tom Noe, a politically connected coin dealer. When the Coingate scandal broke, Taft, who was a regular golf partner of Noe&#x27;s, denied having knowledge of the Bureau of Workers Compensation (BWC) decision to invest money in Noe&#x27;s coin funds. Dann demanded, then sued to see memos, e-mails, and other communications transmitted between Gov. Taft&#x27;s office and the BWC.

Dann was a vociferous critic of then-Attorney General Jim Petro, a Republican, who had been notified by the Securities and Exchange Commission more than two years earlier that the SEC had serious reservations about investment practices at the BWC. Dann charged that Petro ignored those warnings and the misuse of funds at the agency continued unabated until the &quot;Toledo Blade&quot; and Dann began to expose the corruption.

==Attorney General==

Dann announced his candidacy for Attorney General of Ohio on November 14, 2005, saying he would use the office to both help local police and prosecutors deal with street crime and to actively and aggressively pursue white collar criminals.

Dann won 71% of the vote in the Democratic primary against former Cleveland Law Director Subodh Chandra. He won the general election in November 2006 by upsetting Ohio State Auditor Betty Montgomery, a former attorney general. In the general-election campaign, Montgomery tried to distance herself from the scandals of the Taft administration, while criticizing Dann for wanting to use the attorney general&#x27;s office as a platform for activism.

In a television advertisement, the Montgomery campaign attacked Dann for the above-mentioned 2004 reprimand and for defending a man convicted of showing nude pictures to children. Dann responded to the latter attack by saying he was simply doing his job as an attorney.

Dann received 2.04 million votes to 1.83 million for Montgomery, a margin of 52% to 48%. He ran up huge margins in traditionally Republican areas and also won bellwether counties such as Franklin and Stark. Before her defeat by Dann, Montgomery had never lost a statewide election and had been the top Republican vote-getter in the previous two non-presidential statewide contests. He was sworn in as the 47th Ohio Attorney General on January 8, 2007.

==Controversies==
Dann had been questioned by some for supporting Capri Cafaro&#x27;s successful bid to fill Dann&#x27;s unexpired term in the state Senate. Cafaro, heiress to part of the Cafaro shopping-mall empire, had never won election to office. In addition, Cafaro&#x27;s father, J. J. Cafaro, had pleaded guilty in 2001 to bribing then-Congressman Jim Traficant to push legislation that would benefit his aviation-equipment company. Capri, then in her early 20s, was president of the aviation company but was not charged with any wrongdoing. In a related trial, Capri testified she had never conspired with Traficant.

As of October 18, 2006, the Cafaro family had contributed $30,500 to Dann&#x27;s campaign for attorney general, in addition to the $26,000 they had donated to his state Senate campaigns. Of that money, $10,000 came from J. J. Cafaro.
Dann defended his recommendation of Capri Cafaro by saying he believed she was the only qualified candidate to replace him.

Dann faced criticism from the Mansfield News Journal and others for telling (Warren, Ohio) &quot;Tribune Chronicle&quot; reporter Steve Oravecz to &quot;go ... fuck yourself&quot; at a fundraiser for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama. Dann was upset about an article Oravecz had written entitled &quot;Locals with ties to Dann get jobs&quot;. The article described how two people with ties to Dann&#x27;s election campaign, including a woman who he raised as a daughter, were given state jobs. The incident was caught on tape.

According to the Associated Press, the Attorney General&#x27;s office missed a legal deadline to join an appeal of a Medicaid-related court decision the state government opposes. The deadline for filing the documents was Dann&#x27;s inauguration day. The failure to join the appeal does not prevent the state from filing briefs in the case.

===Sexual harassment scandal===

A sexual harassment scandal arose during Dann&#x27;s tenure as attorney general, eventually leading to his resignation. The investigation focused on allegations of sexual harassment filed by two women, Cindy Stankoski and Vanessa Stout, who worked in Dann’s office under the supervision of Anthony Gutierrez, Dann’s director of general services. In April 2008, Dann placed Communications Director Leo Jennings on paid leave pending the outcome of the ongoing investigation in his office, along with Gutierrez, pending the outcome of the investigation. Jennings and Gutierrez were non-attorney friends of Dann from Youngstown; the three shared a condominium in Columbus.

Stankoski and Stout alleged that Gutierrez, who was paid $87,500 a year, repeatedly sexually harassed them. A statement from Dann released to reporters gave no details on what led to Jennings being included in the investigation. It said only: &quot;This action comes as a result of new information received over the weekend related to the ongoing investigation into charges of sexual harassment.&quot; Dann agreed to conditionally release emails between himself and his former scheduler, Jessica Utovich. Utovich, 28, began as Dann&#x27;s scheduler, but was transferred to the position of director of travel in late 2007. Upon being transferred, Utovich received a 27% pay raise.

===Extramarital affair and resignation===
On May 2, 2008, following the firing and resignation of a number of his aides in a sexual harassment scandal, Dann admitted that he had had an extramarital affair with an unidentified subordinate in his office. However, he initially refused to resign, saying his admission and punishment were enough. In the wake of his admission, a number of Ohio papers called for Dann to resign and the &quot;Tribune Chronicle&quot; even apologized to its readers for their endorsement of Dann during the 2006 election.

On May 4, 2008, the three largest Ohio newspapers ran editorials condemning Dann. &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; (Cleveland, Ohio) opined that &quot;Dann has turned the attorney general&#x27;s office into a laughingstock&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s impossible to see how he can recover&quot; The &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot; said Dann was &quot;not fit to serve&quot;, and the &quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; called for Dann&#x27;s resignation.

The &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; had previously reported on statements by Republicans that if Dann wouldn&#x27;t step down, they could try to impeach him. On the evening of May 5, Democratic Governor Strickland issued a statement which appeared to support Dann&#x27;s impeachment should he decide not to resign. Dann showed no interest in departure, even after Strickland&#x27;s statement.

On May 5, 2008, the &quot;Columbus Dispatch&quot; reported that seven separate investigations were either underway or being considered in response to misconduct at the Attorney General&#x27;s office. On May 10, 2008, the Ohio Democratic Party voted to remove their endorsement of Dann, remove him of his membership in the Ohio Democratic Party Executive Committee, and call for his immediate resignation as attorney general. On May 12, 2008, articles of impeachment were filed with 42 of the 45 Democrats in the state house supporting the nine counts. At a May 14, 2008, press conference in Columbus, Dann resigned the Office of Attorney General of Ohio.

In March 2009, Dann and his campaign were each fined $1,000 by the Ohio Elections Commission for violating campaign-finance laws by using his political account for personal cell phones for his family and for security renovations to his Youngstown-area home. In June 2009, Dann reached a plea agreement with the Ohio Inspector General, Thomas P. Charles, in which he pled guilty to a single count of misuse of campaign funds, for purchasing travel for family members to San Francisco for a vacation that was to be packaged with a political fundraiser, and paid another fine of $1000; the Commission agreed to accept the plea deal by a 5 to 1 vote.

Prior to filing criminal charges against Dann’s associates, including Leo Jennings, Anthony Gutierrez and Edgar Simpson, Charles filed complaints against Dann with the Elections Commission, alleging that he illegally used his political account to pay Leo Jennings, who used the money to pay for rent and utilities for the condominium they shared with Anthony Gutierrez. Following a trial regarding different allegations relating to his tenure in Dann&#x27;s office, Gutierrez was ultimately sentenced to 45 days in jail.

==Personal==
Dann&#x27;s former spouse, Alyssa Lenhoff, is director of the journalism program at Youngstown State University. Lenhoff won several awards for investigative reporting at the &quot;Tribune Chronicle&quot; in Warren, Ohio. Lenhoff&#x27;s former partner at the &quot;Tribune&quot;, Ed Simpson, was Dann&#x27;s chief of staff until he resigned under fire on May 2, 2008.
Dann was a Sigma Chi at the University of Michigan. Dann and Lenhoff have three children. Lenhoff filed for divorce from Dann on April 15, 2010, after Dann was caught having an extramarital affair. Their divorce was finalized in July 2010.

Dann was suspended from the practice of law by the Ohio Supreme Court effective November 20, 2012, and was reinstated effective June 11, 2013. Dann now has a private legal practice in Cleveland, Ohio, reportedly specializing in combating home foreclosures.

<text>Solar electric propulsion (SEP) refers to the combination of solar cells and electric thrusters to propel a spacecraft through outer space. This technology has been exploited in a variety of spacecraft designs by the European Space Agency (ESA), the JAXA (Japanese Space Agency), Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and NASA. SEP has a significantly higher specific impulse than chemical rocket propulsion, thus requiring less propellant mass to be launched with a spacecraft. The technology has been evaluated for missions to Mars.

== Overview ==
Solar electric propulsion combines solar panels on spacecraft and one or more electric thrusters, used in tandem. There are many different types of electric thrusters, including a so-called ion thruster, a term that is often incorrectly used to describe all types of electric thrusters.

It is also possible to generate electricity from the Sun without using photovoltaic panels, such as with solar concentrators and a Stirling engine.

A 50 kilowatt SEP system was studied in the 2010s for a mission to an asteroid. In February 2012, NASA awarded a contract for a Solar Electric Propulsion Flight System.

An example of work on this type of technology is Advanced Electric Propulsion System.

The NASA Solar Technology Application Readiness (NSTAR) ion engine has been used with photovoltaic solar panels, which was tested on the Deep Space 1 mission along with Solar Concentrator Arrays (Launched in 1998 as part of the New Millennium Program).

SEP has been studied as a technology for a mission to Mars. In particular the high specific impulse of the ion engines could lower overall mass and avoid having to use nuclear technology for power when coupled with solar panels. A 1998 study for SEP for a human mission suggest that a human-sized spacecraft would need 600 to 800 kilowatts of electrical power coupled with ion engines with a specific impulse of 2000 to 2500 seconds.

<doc id="1201890" wikidata="Q169598" url="?curid=1201890" title="Honnō-ji Incident">
<text>The  was the assassination of Japanese daimyo Oda Nobunaga at Honnō-ji temple in Kyoto on 21 June 1582 (2nd day of the sixth month, Tenshō 10). Nobunaga was on the verge of unifying the country, but died in the unexpected rebellion of his vassal Akechi Mitsuhide.

Nobunaga only had a few guards and retainers with him when he was attacked, ending his Sengoku period campaign to unify Japan under his power.
Nobunaga&#x27;s death was avenged two weeks later when his retainer Toyotomi Hideyoshi defeated Mitsuhide in the Battle of Yamazaki, paving the way for Hideyoshi to complete the unification of Japan.

Mitsuhide&#x27;s motive for assassinating Nobunaga is unknown, though there are multiple theories for his betrayal.

== Background ==
By 1582, Oda Nobunaga was the most powerful daimyo in Japan and was continuing a sustained campaign of unification in the face of the ongoing political upheaval that characterized Japanese history during the Sengoku period. Nobunaga had destroyed the Takeda clan earlier that year at the Battle of Tenmokuzan and had central Japan firmly under his control, with his only rivals, the Mōri clan and the Uesugi clan, both weakened by internal affairs. The death of Uesugi Kenshin left the Uesugi clan devastated also by an internal conflict between his two adopted sons, weaker than before. The nearly decade-long Ishiyama Hongan-ji War also had already ended with the conclusion of peace. The Mori clan was also in a situation where defeat was almost inevitable and had presented a peace proposal to Hashiba Hideyoshi, offering the cession of five provinces.

It was at this point that Nobunaga began sending his generals aggressively in all directions to continue his military expansion. Nobunaga ordered Hashiba Hideyoshi to attack the Mōri clan in the Chūgoku region; Niwa Nagahide to prepare for an invasion of Shikoku; Takigawa Kazumasu to watch the Hōjō clan from Kōzuke Province and Shinano Province; and Shibata Katsuie to invade Echigo Province, the home domain of the Uesugi clan.

Nobunaga, confident of unifying the country after destroying the Takeda clan, returned to Azuchi in high spirits. Tokugawa Ieyasu also came to Azuchi Castle to thank Nobunaga for giving him the Suruga province. However, around this time, the Mōri clan launched a large-scale counteroffensive in the Chūgoku region, and Nobunaga received a request for reinforcements from Hashiba Hideyoshi, whose forces were stuck besieging the Mōri-controlled Takamatsu Castle.

Nobunaga immediately ordered Akechi Mitsuhide to go to the Chugoku region to support Hideyoshi, and he himself was to follow soon after. Nobunaga began his preparations and headed for Honnō-ji temple in Kyoto, his usual resting place when he stopped by in the capital.

Nobunaga was unprotected at Honnō-ji, deep within his territory, with the only people he had around him being court officials, merchants, upper-class artists, and dozens of servants. Having dispatched most of his soldiers to take part in various campaigns, only a small force was left to protect his person and there was little fear that anyone would dare strike Nobunaga; security measures were weak. Taking advantage of this opening, Mitsuhide suddenly turned against his master.

== Mitsuhide&#x27;s betrayal ==
Upon receiving the order, Mitsuhide returned to Sakamoto Castle and moved to his base in Tanba Province. He engaged in a session of &quot;renga&quot; with several prominent poets, using the opportunity to make clear his intentions of rising against Nobunaga. Mitsuhide saw an opportunity to act, when Nobunaga was not only resting in Honnō-ji and unprepared for an attack, but all the other major &quot;daimyō&quot; and the bulk of Nobunaga&#x27;s army were occupied in other parts of the country. Mitsuhide led his army toward Kyoto under the pretense of following the order of Nobunaga. It was not the first time that Nobunaga had demonstrated his modernized and well-equipped troops in Kyoto, so the march toward Kyoto of Mitsuhide&#x27;s men did not raise any suspicion. Before dawn, Mitsuhide, leading 13,000 soldiers, suddenly changed course in the middle of his march and attacked Honnō-ji Temple, where Nobunaga was staying.

There&#x27;s a legend that when crossing the Katsura River, Mitsuhide announced to his troops that .
However, this story appeared first in &quot;Oda Nobunaga-fu&quot; () by Hayashi Razan (1583 – 1657) then in &quot;Nihon Gaishi&quot; by Rai San&#x27;yō, a kangakusha of the late Edo period, and is most likely a creation, not a statement by Akechi himself.
According to Luís Fróis&#x27;s &quot;History of Japan&quot; and testimonies from surviving soldiers, Mitsuhide was only the commander of the Oda Army&#x27;s area forces, and since it was the Oda clan to whom the soldiers owed allegiance, Mitsuhide did not reveal his purpose to anyone except his officers, fearing that informants might appear. Even when the attack actually began, the soldiers did not know whom they were attacking, and some thought it was Ieyasu.

=== Chronology of the incident ===
The situation at the time was recorded by Gyū-ichi Ota, the author of &quot;Shinchō Kōki&quot;, who interviewed the ladies-in-waiting who were at the scene soon after the incident.

Nobunaga had come to Kyoto to support Hashiba Hideyoshi and stayed at Honnō-ji on this day. This was because Nobunaga had not dared to build a castle in Kyoto in order to maintain a distance from the Imperial Court. Moreover, Nobunaga had ordered his generals to go into battle, so only about 150 men were escorting him at Honnō-ji. Akechi Mitsuhide, on the other hand, was leading 13,000 fully armed soldiers. This was a perfect opportunity for Mitsuhide.
Honnō-ji was a fortified temple with stone walls and a moat, and it had a reasonable defense capability, but it was helpless when surrounded by a large army.

On that day, Kyoto seemed to be in the midst of bad weather due to the combination of abnormal weather and the rainy season. The attack began early in the morning. Mitsuhide&#x27;s forces finished encircling Honnō-ji around 6:00 a.m. and began to invade the temple from all sides.

According to Shinchō Kōki, Nobunaga and the pages at first thought that someone had started a fight in the street. But when the enemy raised a battle cry and started shooting, they realized it was a rebellion. Nobunaga asked, &quot;Whose scheme is this?&quot;, Mori Ranmaru replied, &quot;It appears to be Akechi&#x27;s&quot;. Nobunaga did not ask back, but simply said, , and began to fight back with bows and arrows at the edge of the palace. When the bowstring broke, he kept shooting arrows while changing bows, and when he ran out of spare bows, he fought with his spear. When Nobunaga was eventually unable to fight after being hit in the elbow by an enemy spear, he retreated and told the nyōbō-shū there, &quot;I don&#x27;t care, you ladies hurry up and get out of here&quot;. It was said that Nobunaga then entered the back room of the palace, closed the door of the storage room, and committed seppuku in the burning temple. The Akechi forces lifted the siege around 8:00 a.m.

Meanwhile, Oda Nobutada, who was at Myōkaku-ji Temple, received news of Mitsuhide&#x27;s rebellion and attempted to go to Honnō-ji Temple to rescue his father. However, just as he was leaving the temple, Murai Sadakatsu and his sons rushed in and stopped him. Murai said that Honnō-ji had already burned down and the enemy would soon attack us, and advised Nobutada to hunker down in the fortified Nijō Gosho. Upon entering the Nijō Gosho, Nobutada orders Maeda Geni to flee with his infant son, Sanpōshi (Oda Hidenobu), going from Gifu Castle in Mino to Kiyosu Castle in Owari. Nobutada had all the people escape, including the kugyō and the nyōbō-shū, and then he began his war council. Some advised Nobutada to escape and head for Azuchi, but he said, &quot;An enemy who has committed such a rebellion will not let us escape so easily. It would be a disgrace for me to be killed by common soldiers while fleeing&quot;, and decided to stay in Kyoto and fight. In the meantime, Akechi completed the siege of Nijō Gosho, making it impossible to escape. Later, Nobutada also committed seppuku. Kamata Shinsuke, who assisted Nobutada in his suicide, hid his head and body according to his instructions.

== Aftermath ==
Akechi Mitsuhide was eager to find Nobunaga&#x27;s body in the burnt ruins of Honnō-ji, but he was unable to locate it. Nobunaga&#x27;s body not being found meant that no one knew if he was alive or dead and created a problem for Mitsuhide. If, by any chance, Nobunaga was alive, the probability of Mitsuhide&#x27;s defeat increased, and even if it remained unclear whether he was alive or dead, Mitsuhide would find it very difficult to gain support from those who feared Nobunaga&#x27;s retaliation. In fact, Hideyoshi sent a letter to Nobunaga&#x27;s vassals that falsely claimed that Nobunaga was still alive to request their cooperation in defeating Mitsuhide. If Mitsuhide had obtained Nobunaga&#x27;s head, he could have made his death known to the public, and some forces might have followed him. If that had happened, he might have been able to defeat Hideyoshi. Meanwhile, Mitsuhide also tried to persuade Oda vassals in the vicinity of Kyoto to recognize his authority after the death of Nobunaga. Then, Mitsuhide entered Nobunaga&#x27;s Azuchi Castle east of Kyoto and began sending messages to the Imperial Court to boost his position and force the court to recognize his authority as well. However, no one responded to Mitsuhide&#x27;s call.

Hashiba Hideyoshi received the first news the day after the incident. Hideyoshi immediately made peace with the Mōri clan, kept Nobunaga&#x27;s death under wraps, and returned to the Kinai region with an ultra-fast, forced march known as Chūgoku Ōgaeshi (the Great Return from the Chugoku Region). After returning in about a week with an army of nearly 30,000 troops for a total distance of 200 km, Hideyoshi joined forces with Niwa Nagahide and Oda Nobutaka in Osaka and headed for Kyoto. With this momentum, Hideyoshi defeated Mitsuhide in the Battle of Yamazaki. While on the run, Mitsuhide was killed as a victim of an ochimushagari.

The Kiyosu Conference was then held to determine the successor to the Oda clan, and four vassals of the Oda clan, Shibata Katsuie, Niwa Nagahide, Ikeda Tsuneoki, and Hashiba Hideyoshi, attended the conference. Three names were mentioned as possible successors: Nobukatsu, the second son; Nobutaka, the third son; and Hidenobu (Sanhōshi), Nobutada&#x27;s eldest son, or Nobunaga&#x27;s grandson, who was only three years old.

=== Nobunaga&#x27;s corpse ===
After defeating Mitsuhide, Hideyoshi also searched for Nobunaga&#x27;s body, but it still could not be found. In October 1582, Hideyoshi held Nobunaga&#x27;s funeral at Daitoku-ji Temple in Kyoto. In place of his missing body, Hideyoshi had a life-size wooden statue of Nobunaga cremated and put it in an urn in place of his ashes.

There is no doubt that what Nobunaga feared most when he prepared to die was not dying but what would happen after death: in other words, how his body would be treated. Nobunaga must have understood that if his body had fallen into Mitsuhide&#x27;s hands, his severed head would surely have been gibbeted, and he would have been disgraced as a criminal and that Mitsuhide would use Nobunaga&#x27;s death to justify his rebellion by making it public. In such a situation, Nobunaga had a few possible options. He would have the body burned so that it could not be identified as Nobunaga&#x27;s, or he would have it buried so that Mitsuhide could not find it inside Honnō-ji, or he would have someone he trusted carry it out of Honnō-ji, even at the risk of being stolen by Mitsuhide on the way. There are several theories regarding the fact that no bodies were found in the burnt ruins of Honnō-ji. One theory is that Nobunaga could not be identified because the bodies were too badly damaged, another that there were too many burned bodies to identify, and a third that the fire was so intense that his body was completely consumed.

There are also several stories that Nobunaga&#x27;s body and head were carried out from Honnō-ji. There are a number of tombs in various parts of Japan that are said to be Nobunaga&#x27;s, but there is no evidence that his body or ashes are buried in any of them.

== Tokugawa escape to Mikawa ==

Tokugawa Ieyasu heard the news in Hirakata, Osaka, but at the time, he had only a few companions with him. The Iga province track was also in danger of the &quot;Ochimusha-gari&quot;, or &quot;Samurai hunters&quot; gang. During the Sengoku period, particularly dangerous groups called &quot;Ochimusha-gari&quot; or &quot;fallen warrior hunter&quot; groups emerged. These groups consisted of peasant or Rōnin who dispossessed by war formed self-defense forces. However, in reality they often resorted to hunting and robbing defeated Samurais or soldiers during conflicts. These outlaw groups were particularly rampant on the route which Ieyasu took to return to Mikawa.

Ieyasu and his party, therefore, chose the shortest route back to the Mikawa province by crossing the Iga Province, which was different in many versions according to primary sources such as the records of &quot;Tokugawa Nikki&quot; or &quot;Mikawa Todai-Hon&quot;:

* The &quot;Tokugawa Nikki&quot; theory stated that Ieyasu took the roads to Shijonawate and Son&#x27;enji and then followed the stream of the Kizu river until they spent the night at Yamaguchi castle. The next day they reached a stronghold of the Kōka ikki clan of the Tarao who allowed them to take refuge for the night. Then on the last day, the Ieyasu group used a ship from Shiroko to reach Okazaki Castle. However, the &quot;Tokugawa Nikki&quot; theory was doubted by modern historians, since it was not the shortest route for Ieyasu to reach Mikawa from his starting position at Sakai, while on the other hand, it was also considered by history researchers as a very risky path due to the existence of Iga ikki groups which were hostile to the Oda and Tokugawa clans.
* The &quot;Mikawa Toda-Hon&quot; stated that Ieyasu went north from Ogawadate, crossed Koka, and entered Seishu Seki (from Shigaraki, passed through Aburahi and entered Tsuge in Iga.) This theory was supported by Modern Japanese historians such as Tatsuo Fujita from Mie University, who takes this material to formulate three different theories about the details of Ieyasu&#x27;s trek that he propagated. This theory is also supported by a group of history researchers of Mie city, which happened to be the descendants of the Kōka ikki clans. They stated that by taking this path, before the Ieyasu group reached the Kada pass where they could be escorted by the Kōka clan Jizamurai, Ieyasu mostly depended for protection with his high-rank vassals, particularly the four Shitennō (Tokugawa clan) generals of the Tokugawa clan, rather than the popular theory about the help of the &quot;Iga Ninja&quot; clans. In 2023, during the conference of the &quot;International Ninja Society&quot; at Chubu Centrair International Airport, a passionate debate occurred which involved Chris Glenn (a D.J. and Japanese history enthusiast and author), Uejima Hidetomo (a history book author from Nara), Watanabe Toshitsune (former chairman of the Koga Ninjutsu Research Society) and Sakae Okamoto (Mayor of Iga city). In this conference, Toshitsune challenged the common theory about the Iga route which is stated by Hidetomo and who propagated the theory about Ieyasu taking the Kōka route which he viewed as more plausible. 

Regardless, whichever theory is true, historians agreed that the track ended at Kada (a mountain pass between Kameyama town and Iga), and that the Tokugawa group suffered a last attack by the Ochimusha-gari outlaws at the Kada pass where they reached the territory of the Kōka ikki clans of Jizamurai which are friendly to the Tokugawa clan. The Koka ikki Jizamurai assisted Ieyasu in eliminating the threats of the Ochimusha-gari outlaws and escorted them until they reached Iga Province, where they were further protected by other friendly groups of Iga ikki which accompanied the Ieyasu group until they safely reached Mikawa. There are 34 recorded Tokugawa vassals who survived this journey, such as Sakai Tadatsugu, Ii Naomasa, and Honda Tadakatsu, Sakakibara Yasumasa and many others. Other than those four Shitennō generals Matsudaira Ietada recorded in his journal, &quot;Ietada nikki&quot; (家忠日記), the escorts of the Ieyasu during the journey in Iga consisted of:

Ietada Nikki also recorded that the escorts of Ieyasu suffered around 200 casualties during their journey.

However, not all of the escaping parties managed to escape alive. Anayama Nobutada, a former Twenty-Four Generals of Takeda Shingen member who was now an ally to the Tokugawa and Nobunaga clan, was ambushed by the Ochimusha-gari during the journey, and killed along with some of his retainers.

=== Iga Ninja theory&#x27;s controversy ===
It was reported by Edo period traditional records that Hattori Hanzō, a Tokugawa vassal from Iga, negotiated with Iga ninjas to hire them as guards along the way to avoid the ochimusha-gari. The local Koka-Ikki ninjas and Iga-Ikki ninjas under Hanzo who helped Ieyasu to travel into safety consisted of 300 Ninjas. Furthermore, Uejima Hidetomo, a researcher of Iga Ninja history, has stated there is research which revealed that Hattori Yasuji, one of the ninjas who accompanied Ieyasu on his journey in Iga province, also served as a bodyguard and espionage officer under Muromachi Shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki.

However, a modern scholar such as Tatsuo Fujita doubted the credibility of Hattori Hattori Hanzō&#x27;s ninja army theory, since it was first appeared in &quot;Iga-sha yuishogaki&quot; record which circulated in Edo period during the rule of Shogun Tokugawa Yoshimune. During his rule, Yoshimune were known for establishing the Oniwaban secret police institution whose members hailed from the confederation clans of Koka and Iga. It has been argued that the circulation of the myth about Hattori Hanzō ninja army helping Ieyasu was created as propaganda to increase the prestige of the Iga and Koka clan confederations in Tokugawa Shogunate.

On the other hand, Chaya Shirōjirō, a wealthy merchant in Kyoto, wrote that he went ahead and gave silver coins to local people and asked them to guide and escort the group, which is highly likely to be true since it also appears in Jesuit historical documents of the same period. However, the existence of Chaya Shirōjirō during this period itself is also doubted by historians, since it was recorded that Shirōjirō was born in 1600, so it was unlikely he existed during Ieyasu&#x27;s travels in Iga province in 1582.

== Mitsuhide&#x27;s betrayal theories ==

The Honnō-ji Incident is a major historical event, but no definitive conclusion has been reached regarding Akechi Mitsuhide&#x27;s motives, and the truth remains unknown. More than 50 theories have been proposed over the years, and new theories emerge with each discovery of a new historical document or announcement of the results of an excavation.

=== Betrayal motivation ===
Several theories regarding the motivation:

* Mitsuhide was abused by Nobunaga, including being humiliated and dismissed as a host for a visit of Tokugawa Ieyasu. The prevailing theory during the Edo period was that the incident was caused by Mitsuhide&#x27;s resentment of various unreasonable punishments he received from Nobunaga. The main reasons were as follows. However, historian Tetsuo Owada considered such history, including alleged Mitsuhide&#x27;s letter to Kobayakawa Takakage to express his feeling about Nobunaga as unreliable.
* Nobunaga had treated him unfairly. His fiefdom in the San&#x27;in region was unilaterally confiscated. Such theory includes the idication of preferential treatment for Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s relatives. The theory is that Mitsuhide felt threatened by the fact that Nobunaga, who had previously adopted a merit-based system for his vassals and had appointed them according to their abilities regardless of their origins, began to favor his relatives. Furthermore, there is an opinion that Nobunaga forcibly transferring Mitsuhide from his territorial control of Sakamoto and Tanba into the yet-to-be-conquered regions of Izumo and Iwami. However, this theory was also dismissed by Owada as it was a usual custom for Nobunaga to bestow non-pacified territories to his vassals as promise.
* His mother, who was a hostage of Hatano clan, was killed because of Nobunaga. During the siege of Yakami Castle in 1579 , Mitsuhide offered his mother as hostage to the Hatano clan, in an effort to convince Hatano Hideharu to submit to Nobunaga. However, Nobunaga instead executed Hideharu and his brother with crucifixion, prompting the Hatano clan to exact retaliation by crucifying Mitsuhide&#x27;s mother in response. However, there is no such mention in &quot;Nobunaga Koki&quot; a primary source. According to the book, Mitsuhide besieged Yakami Castle for a year, starving the enemy, and eventually captured the three Hatano brothers, but there is no mention of his mother being crucified afterwards. Furthermore, recent research has shown that she had died of natural causes before the siege of Yakami. Modern historian Watanabe Daimon also explained this theory was traced from Toyama Nobuharu&#x27;s work &quot;Sōkenki&quot; written around 1658; &quot;Kashiwazaki Monogatari&quot;; and also &quot;Nobunaga-ki&quot; (Shinchō Kōki); which Daimon also doubted their credibilities due to many embellishments and additions which was not found in primary sources found.

Thus, these stories were largely deemed by historians as unreliable, including the story of Mitsuhide betrayal from &quot;Akechi-gunki&quot; and &quot;Kōyō Gunkan&quot;.

Other new theories from 20th century historians which involve the Ashikaga Shogunate also emerged:

* There also emerged the theory that Mitsuhide was a loyalist to the imperial court or a shogunate vassal of the Ashikaga shogunate. Historian Kuwata Tadachika put forth the reason that Mitsuhide had a personal grudge, and there was another theory that Mitsuhide did not enjoy the cruelty of Nobunaga. Another indication was when Mitsuhide began his march toward Chugoku, he held a &quot;renga&quot; session at the shrine on Mount Atago. The beginning line, &quot;Toki wa ima, ame ga shita shiru satsuki kana&quot; (), translates to &quot;The time is now, the fifth month when the rain falls.&quot; However, there are several homonyms in the line, such that it could be taken as a double entendre. An alternate meaning, without changing any of the pronunciations, would be: . Thus it has also been translated as &quot;Now is the time to rule the world: It&#x27;s the fifth month!&quot; In this case, the word &quot;toki&quot;, which means &quot;time&quot; in the first version, sounds identical to Akechi&#x27;s ancestral family name, &quot;Toki&quot; ().
* Ashikaga Shogunate restoration, Tatsuo Fujita points out that Mitsuhide&#x27;s handwritten letter addressed to the Kishu daimyo named Shigeharu Dobashi shows that Mitsuhide had a clear plan to welcome Yoshiaki to Kyoto after the Honnoji Incident and restore the Muromachi Shogunate.

=== Alleged collaborators ===

The mastermind theory that someone behind the incident manipulated Mitsuhide Akechi to carry out Nobunaga&#x27;s assassination is surprisingly new and has emerged since the 1990s. It all started when the well-known medieval historian Akira Imatani published a book advocating a conflict between the Imperial Court and Nobunaga. The theory is that the existence of an emperor with high authority was becoming a hindrance to Nobunaga, who wanted to be an absolute monarch. At the time, when the new emperor was about to ascend to the throne, the emperor system was the subject of much debate in the historical academia. Although Imatani himself did not claim that the Imperial Court was involved in the Honnō-ji Incident, various conspiracy theories were developed, mainly by influential historical researchers who were inspired by Imatani&#x27;s theory.

There are several theories about the collaborator of Mitsuhide&#x27;s act in Honnō-ji:
* Hashiba (Toyotomi) Hideyoshi theory
** The reason is that Hideyoshi&#x27;s Chugoku Ogaeshi was too fast. However, only the cavalry warriors were able to turn back at breakneck speed, and the infantry arrived late. Many of the soldiers did not make it in time for the &quot;Battle of Yamazaki&quot; with Mitsuhide. While it might be a stretch to designate Hideyoshi as the mastermind, many historians have pointed out the strong possibility that he anticipated this situation.
* Tokugawa Ieyasu theory
** The reason is: &quot;Nobunaga, who was on the verge of unifying the country, felt that Ieyasu, his ally, stood in his way. He planned to kill Ieyasu first. However, Mitsuhide, who was becoming increasingly dissatisfied with Nobunaga&#x27;s policies, conversely informed Ieyasu of the plot and drew him into his side, thus killing Nobunaga by surprise.&quot; It is a leap of faith to assume that Mitsuhide and Ieyasu, who had not interacted with each other before, were able to conspire in Nobunaga&#x27;s city, Azuchi Castle Town, and there is no historical support for this idea.
* Ankokuji Ekei (the Mōri) theory
** The theory is that Ankokuji Ekei, a diplomatic monk of the Mōri, which was facing an existential crisis as Nobunaga himself was about to launch a full-scale offensive, arranged for Nobunaga&#x27;s assassination on condition of the Mōri&#x27;s full cooperation with Mitsuhide and Hideyoshi, and had it carried out.
* Buddhist power theory
**The theory that Buddhist powers such as Hiei-zan Enryaku-ji and Ishiyama Hongan-ji, which were suppressed by Nobunaga and held a strong grudge against him, were the masterminds behind the situation.
* Imperial Court/Kuge power theory
** This is the theory that Prince Masahito, Konoe Sakihisa, Yoshida Kanemi, and others forced Mitsuhide to defeat Nobunaga because Nobunaga forced Emperor Ōgimachi to abdicate. In reality, however, the Imperial Court was rather desperate to curry the favor of its sponsor, Nobunaga, since Nobunaga&#x27;s financial support had dramatically improved their financial situation, which was in danger. Emperor Ōgimachi was also unable to abdicate due to a lack of funding for the abdication ceremony.
* Ashikaga Shogun (Muromachi Shogunate) theory
** The theory is that Ashikaga Yoshiaki, the 15th shogun, exiled by Nobunaga, formed the Nobunaga siege by Mori Terumoto, Uesugi Kagakatsu, and other powerful Daimyo, and forced Mitsuhide to stage a coup d&#x27;état. However, the Shogun did not have much authority at the time, and Uesugi and Mori did not cooperate with Akechi.
* Jesuit theory
** The theory is that the Jesuits of the Catholic Church, which dispatched missionaries to Japan, were the masterminds. The Jesuits supported Nobunaga militarily and economically, and Nobunaga also protected Christianity, but Nobunaga tried to become independent from the Jesuits by deifying himself, so the Jesuits had Mitsuhide defeat Nobunaga and then had Hashiba (Toyotomi) Hideyoshi defeat Mitsuhide, according to this theory. However, while it is true that Nobunaga protected Christianity, there is no historical record of the Jesuits assisting Nobunaga on either the Japanese or Jesuit side, and in fact, the finances of the Japanese branch of the Jesuits were so tight that they could not afford to do so.

In the 2010s, a Shikoku theory was proposed that Mitsuhide, who valued his relationship with Chōsokabe Motochika, rose up to avoid Nobunaga&#x27;s attack on Shikoku. Mitsuhide was entrusted by Nobunaga to negotiate with Chōsokabe, and the Akechi family and Chōsokabe had deep ties in relation to marriage. In 2020, NHK aired a program called &quot;Honnoji Incident Summit 2020&quot;. Seven historians debated various theories, with the &quot;Shikoku theory&quot; garnering the most support.

<text>Thomas Samuel Ashe (July 21, 1812 – February 4, 1887) was an American lawyer and politician who served in the Confederate Congress, and U.S. Congressman from North Carolina.

==Early years==
Born in Hawfields, Orange County, North Carolina, he attended Bingham&#x27;s Academy in Hillsborough, then the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduating in 1832. He was admitted to the bar in 1834 and began to practice law in Wadesboro, North Carolina in 1835.

Ashe owned slaves, with former slave of his Evelina Morgan (Dargan) sharing her Account of what life was like on the plantation when the Yankees had invaded his home while he fled. The title of the book is “Slave Narratives: a folk history of slavery in the United States from interviews with former slaves, volume two, Arkansas natives part five”.

==Politics==
In 1842, Ashe was elected to a single term in the North Carolina House of Commons. From 1847 to 1851 he was solicitor of the fifth judicial district of North Carolina, and in 1854, he served in the North Carolina Senate. During the American Civil War, Ashe served in the Confederate House of Representatives from 1861 to 1864, and was elected to the Confederate Senate in 1864, but the war concluded before he was able to serve.

In 1868, Ashe ran unsuccessfully for Governor as the nominee of the &quot;Conservative&quot; party, then the name of the state Democratic Party. He accepted the nomination only after Zebulon B. Vance and Augustus Merrimon declined to run. In this election, waged under the supervision of the U.S. military and allowing African Americans to vote in large numbers for the first time, Ashe was defeated by the Republican nominee, William Woods Holden. This was the same election in which the new state constitution was approved by the people. Ashe and the Conservatives opposed the new constitution.

Ashe was elected for two terms in the United States House of Representatives, serving from March 4, 1873, to March 3, 1877. Although he chose not to run again in 1876, he was elected an associate justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court in 1878 and re-elected in 1886.

==Death==
Ashe was still serving on the court at the time of the death in Wadesboro in 1887.

Thomas Samuel Ashe was the cousin of fellow Congressmen John Baptista Ashe and William Shepperd Ashe.

<text>Kimberly A. Zurz (born January 23, 1959) of Akron, Ohio, is an American politician of the Democratic Party who served as the Director of the Ohio Department of Commerce from 2007 to 2011.

==Career==
A graduate of Firestone High School in Akron and attendee of the University of Akron, Zurz served as an assistant to the Summit County treasurer. She was a member of the Summit County Council from 1991 to 2003, serving three terms as president of the council.

In 2003, Senator Leigh Herington announced his decision to resign early from the Ohio Senate, and the Democratic caucus named Zurz as his replacement. She easily won reelection in 2004 to retain the seat.

With former Congressman Ted Strickland the new Ohio Governor in 2007, Zurz was named a member of his cabinet, chosen to serve as Director of the Department of Commerce. She would serve in the post for the entirety of Strickland&#x27;s tenure. With Strickland losing reelection in 2010, Zurz was out of the Commerce Department, however, he posted one last effort to appoint her to another board. It was announced by the Ohio Senate soon after that Republican leadership would not accept the nomination.

She has since returned to the Akron area.

<doc id="1201902" wikidata="Q3907563" url="?curid=1201902" title="Policewomen (film)">
<text>Policewomen is a 1974 exploitation film about a female police officer who infiltrates an all-female criminal gang. The film was written and directed by Lee Frost, and stars Sondra Currie (who would later be better known to recent audiences for her role in the Golden Globe-winning comedy &quot;The Hangover&quot;), Tony Young, and Phil Hoover.

Despite the fact that the story actually features only one female police officer, the film&#x27;s title was pluralized and formed into one word because the title &quot;Police Woman&quot; was already in use by an NBC TV series whose pilot was scheduled to premiere one month after this film&#x27;s release.

==Plot==
A lady cop infiltrates an all-female criminal gang.

== Cast ==
*Sondra Currie as Lacy Bond
*Tony Young as Lt. Frank Mitchell
*Phil Hoover as Doc
*Elizabeth Stuart as Maude
*Jean Bell as Pam Harris
*Laurie Rose as Janette
*William Smith as Karate Teacher
*Richard Schuyler as Pete Peterson

<doc id="1201904" wikidata="Q220848" url="?curid=1201904" title="Cercopithecinae">
<text>The Cercopithecinae are a subfamily of the Old World monkeys, which comprises roughly 71 species, including the baboons, the macaques, and the vervet monkeys. Most cercopithecine monkeys are limited to sub-Saharan Africa, although the macaques range from the far eastern parts of Asia through northern Africa, as well as on Gibraltar.

== Characteristics ==
The various species are adapted to the different terrains they inhabit. Arboreal species are slim, delicate, and have a long tail, while terrestrial species are stockier and their tails can be small or completely nonexistent. All species have well-developed thumbs. Some species have ischial callosities on their rump, which can change their colour during their mating periods.

These monkeys are diurnal and live together in social groups. They live in all types of terrain and climate, from rain forests, savannah, and bald rocky areas, to cool or even snowy mountains, such as the Japanese macaque.

Most species are omnivorous, with diets ranging from fruits, leaves, seeds, buds, and mushrooms to insects, spiders, and smaller vertebrates. All species possess cheek pouches in which they can store food.

Gestation lasts around six to seven months. Young are weaned after three to 12 months and are fully mature within three to five years. The life expectancy of some species can be as long as 50 years.

== Classification ==
The Cercopithinae are often split into two tribes, Cercopithecini and Papionini, as shown in the list of genera below.

* Family Cercopithecidae 
** Subfamily Cercopithecinae
*** Tribe Cercopithecini
**** Genus &quot;Allenopithecus&quot; – Allen&#x27;s swamp monkey
**** Genus &quot;Miopithecus&quot; – talapoins
**** Genus &quot;Erythrocebus&quot; – patas monkeys
**** Genus &quot;Chlorocebus&quot; – vervet monkeys, etc.
**** Genus &quot;Allochrocebus&quot; – terrestrial guenons
**** Genus &quot;Cercopithecus&quot; – guenons
*** Tribe Papionini
**** Genus &quot;Macaca&quot; – macaques
**** Genus &quot;Lophocebus&quot; – crested mangabeys
**** Genus &quot;Rungwecebus&quot; – highland mangabey
**** Genus &quot;Papio&quot; – baboons
**** Genus &quot;Theropithecus&quot; – gelada
**** Genus &quot;Cercocebus&quot; – white-eyelid mangabeys

<text>Illinois Route 43 (IL 43) is a major north–south state highway in the U.S. state of Illinois. It runs from U.S. Route 30 (US 30) in Frankfort north to the large intersection of IL 120 (Belvidere Road) and US 41 (Skokie Highway) in Waukegan.

== Route description ==

IL 43 is called Waukegan Road for the first until its intersection with Oakton Street in Niles; it then follows that road west one block until it turns back south and remains Harlem Avenue for the duration. When IL 50 begins in Skokie and IL 171 begins in Chicago, it parallels those routes for much of the rest of its length. It enters, exits, and runs parallel to Chicago limits several times, passing through or parallel to Edison Park, Norwood Park, Dunning, Montclare, and Austin on the Northwest Side then Garfield Ridge and Clearing on the Southwest Side. Listed as 7200 West in the Chicago address system, it is one of seven state roads that travel through the city of Chicago.

== History ==
IL 43 was originally part of what is now US 136 and IL 10 from Havana to Mason City. By 1935, IL 43 was moved to what is now IL 4 from Olive Township to Oraville. By 1964, IL 4 supplanted all of IL 43. In 1967, Illinois Route 42A, which originally followed Waukegan Road and Harlem Avenue, was decommissioned and was replaced by IL 43.

In Deerfield, IL 43 is designated a Blue Star Memorial Highway.

<doc id="1201931" wikidata="Q1562262" url="?curid=1201931" title="Stative verb">
<text>According to some linguistics theories, a stative verb is a verb that describes a state of being, in contrast to a dynamic verb, which describes an action. The difference can be categorized by saying that stative verbs describe situations that are static, or unchanging throughout their entire duration, whereas dynamic verbs describe processes that entail change over time. Many languages distinguish between these two types in terms of how they can be used grammatically.

== Contrast to dynamic ==
Some languages use the same verbs for dynamic and stative situations, and others use different (but often related) verbs with some kind of qualifiers to distinguish between them. Some verbs may act as either stative or dynamic. A phrase like &quot;he plays the piano&quot; may be either stative or dynamic, according to the context. When, in a given context, the verb &quot;play&quot; relates to a state (an interest or a profession), he could be an amateur who enjoys music or a professional pianist. The dynamic interpretation emerges from a specific context in the case &quot;play&quot; describes an action, &quot;what does he do on Friday evening? He plays the piano&quot;.

The distinction between stative and dynamic verbs can be correlated with:

* the distinction between intransitive and transitive
* the possibility of using the progressive aspect with the verb
* morphological markers

=== Progressive aspect ===
In English and certain other languages, stative and dynamic verbs differ in whether or not they typically occur in a progressive form. Dynamic verbs such as &quot;go&quot; can be used in the progressive (&quot;I am going to school&quot;) whereas stative verbs such as &quot;know&quot; cannot (*&quot;I am knowing the answer&quot;). A verb that has both dynamic and stative uses cannot normally be used in the progressive when a stative meaning is intended: e.g. one cannot normally say, idiomatically, &quot;Every morning, I am going to school&quot;. In other languages, statives can be used in the progressive as well: in Korean, for example, the sentence 미나가 인호를 사랑하고 있다 (&quot;Mina is loving Inho&quot;) is perfectly valid.

=== Morphological markers ===
In some languages, stative and dynamic verbs will use entirely different morphological markers on the verbs themselves. For example, in the Mantauran dialect of Rukai, an indigenous language of Taiwan, the two types of verbs take different prefixes in their finite forms, with dynamic verbs taking &quot;o-&quot; and stative verbs taking &quot;ma-&quot;. Thus, the dynamic verb &quot;jump&quot; is &quot;o-coroko&quot; in the active voice, while the stative verb &quot;love&quot; is &quot;ma-ðalamə&quot;. This sort of marking is characteristic of other Formosan languages as well.

==Difference from inchoative==
In English, a verb that expresses a state can also express the entrance into a state. This is called inchoative aspect. The simple past is sometimes inchoative. For example, the present-tense verb in the sentence &quot;He understands his friend&quot; is stative, while the past-tense verb in the sentence &quot;Suddenly he understood what she said&quot; is inchoative, because it means that he understood henceforth. On the other hand, the past-tense verb in &quot;At one time, he understood her&quot; is stative.

The only way the difference between stative and inchoative can be expressed in English is through the use of modifiers, as in the above examples (&quot;suddenly&quot; and &quot;at one time&quot;).

Likewise, in ancient Greek, a verb that expresses a state (e.g., &#x27;I was king&#x27;) may use the aorist to express entrance into the state (e.g., &#x27;I became king&#x27;). But the aorist can also simply express the state as a whole, with no focus on the beginning of the state ( &#x27;I ruled for twenty years&#x27;).

== Formal definitions ==
In some theories of formal semantics, including David Dowty&#x27;s, stative verbs have a logical form that is the lambda expression

:formula_1

Apart from Dowty, Z. Vendler and C. S. Smith have also written influential work on aspectual classification of verbs.

== English ==
=== Dowty&#x27;s analysis ===
Dowty gives several tests to decide whether an English verb is stative. They are as follows:

# Statives do not occur in the progressive:
#* &quot;John is running.&quot; (non-stative)
#* *&quot;John is knowing the answer.&quot;
# They cannot be complements of &quot;force&quot;:
#* &quot;I forced John to run.&quot;
#* *&quot;I forced John to know the answer.&quot;
# They do not occur as imperatives, except when used in an inchoative manner.
#* &quot;Run!&quot;
#* *&quot;Know the answer!&quot;
#* &quot;Know thyself!&quot; (inchoative, not stative; archaic)
# They cannot appear in the &quot;pseudo-cleft construction&quot;:
#* &quot;What John did was run.&quot;
#* *&quot;What John did was know the answer.&quot;

===Categories===

Stative verbs are often divided into sub-categories, based on their semantics or syntax.

Semantic divisions mainly involve verbs that express someone&#x27;s state of mind, or something&#x27;s properties (of course, things can also be expressed via other language mechanisms as well, particularly adjectives). The precise categories vary by linguist. Huddleston and Pullum, for example, divide stative verbs into the following semantic categories: verbs of perception and sensation (&quot;see, hear&quot;), verbs of hurting (&quot;ache, itch&quot;), stance verbs (&quot;stand, sit&quot;), and verbs of cognition, emotion, and sensation (&quot;believe, regret&quot;). Novakov, meanwhile, uses the slightly different categories: verbs denoting sensations (&quot;feel, hear&quot;), verbs denoting reasoning and mental attitude (&quot;believe, understand&quot;), verbs denoting positions/stance (&quot;lie, surround&quot;), and verbs denoting relations (&quot;resemble, contain&quot;).

Syntactic divisions involve the types of clause structures in which a verb may be used. In the following examples, an asterisk (*) indicates that the sentence is ungrammatical:

* John believes that Fido is a dog.
: John believes in Fido barking.
: John believes Fido to bark.

* *Joan depends that Fido is a dog.
: Joan depends on Fido barking.
: *Joan depends Fido to bark.

* Jim loathes that Fido is a dog.
: *Jim loathes on Fido barking.
: *Jim loathes Fido to bark.

<doc id="1201933" wikidata="Q24776048" url="?curid=1201933" title="Cadherin">
<text>Cadherins (named for &quot;calcium-dependent adhesion&quot;) are cell adhesion molecules important in forming adherens junctions that let cells adhere to each other. Cadherins are a class of type-1 transmembrane proteins, and they depend on calcium (Ca2+) ions to function, hence their name. Cell-cell adhesion is mediated by extracellular cadherin domains, whereas the intracellular cytoplasmic tail associates with numerous adaptors and signaling proteins, collectively referred to as the cadherin adhesome.

==Background==

The cadherin family is essential in maintaining cell-cell contact and regulating cytoskeletal complexes. The cadherin superfamily includes cadherins, protocadherins, desmogleins, desmocollins, and more. In structure, they share &quot;cadherin repeats&quot;, which are the extracellular Ca2+-binding domains. There are multiple classes of cadherin molecules, each designated with a prefix for tissues with which it associates. Classical cadherins maintain the tone of tissues by forming a homodimer in cis, while desmosomal cadherins are heterodimeric. The intracellular portion of classical cadherins interacts with a complex of proteins that allows connection to the actin cytoskeleton. Although classical cadherins take a role in cell layer formation and structure formation, desmosomal cadherins focus on resisting cell damage. Desmosomal cadherins maintain the function of desmosomes, that is to overturn the mechanical stress of the tissues. Similar to classical cadherins, desmosomal cadherins have a single transmembrane domain, five EC repeats, and an intracellular domain. There are two types of desmosomal cadherins: desmogleins and desmocollins. These contain an intracellular anchor and cadherin-like sequence (ICS). The adaptor proteins that associate with desmosomal cadherins are plakoglobin (related to formula_1-catenin), plakophilins (p120 catenin subfamily), and desmoplakins. The major function of desmoplakins is to bind to intermediate filament by interacting with plakoglobin, which attach to the ICS of desmogleins, desmocollins and plakophilins. Atypical cadherins, such as CELSR1, retain the extracellular repeats and binding activities of the other cadherins, but may otherwise differ significantly in structure, and are typically involved in transmitting developmental signals rather than adhesion.

Cells containing a specific cadherin subtype tend to cluster together to the exclusion of other types, both in cell culture and during development. For example, cells containing N-cadherin tend to cluster with other N-cadherin-expressing cells. However, mixing speed in cell culture experiments can effect the extent of homotypic specificity. In addition, several groups have observed heterotypic binding affinity (i.e., binding of different types of cadherin together) in various assays. One current model proposes that cells distinguish cadherin subtypes based on kinetic specificity rather than thermodynamic specificity, as different types of cadherin homotypic bonds have different lifetimes.

== Structure ==

Cadherins are synthesized as polypeptides and undergo many post-translational modifications to become the proteins which mediate cell-cell adhesion and recognition. These polypeptides are approximately 720–750 amino acids long. Each cadherin has a small C-terminal cytoplasmic component, a transmembrane component, and the remaining bulk of the protein is extra-cellular (outside the cell). The transmembrane component consists of single chain glycoprotein repeats.  Because cadherins are Ca2+ dependent, they have five tandem extracellular domain repeats that act as the binding site for Ca2+ ions.  Their extracellular domain interacts with two separate &quot;trans&quot; dimer conformations: strand-swap dimers (S-dimers) and X-dimers. To date, over 100 types of cadherins in humans have been identified and sequenced.

The functionality of cadherins relies upon the formation of two identical subunits, known as homodimers. The homodimeric cadherins create cell-cell adhesion with cadherins present in the membranes of other cells through changing conformation from &quot;cis&quot;-dimers to &quot;trans&quot;-dimers. Once the cell-cell adhesion between cadherins present in the cell membranes of two different cells has formed, adherens junctions can then be made when protein complexes, usually composed of α-, β-, and γ-catenins, bind to the cytoplasmic portion of the cadherin. Regulatory proteins include p-120 catenin, formula_2-catenin,  formula_1-catenin, and vinculin. Binding of p-120 catenin and formula_1-catenin to the homodimer increases the stability of the classical cadherin. formula_2-catenin is engaged by p120-catenin complex, where vinculin is recruited to take a role in indirect association with actin cytoskeleton. However, cadherin-catenin complex can also bind directly to the actin without the help of vinculin. Moreover, the strength of cadherin adhesion can increase by dephosphorylation of p120 catenin and the binding of formula_2-catenin and vinculin.

== Function ==

===Development===

Cadherins behave as both receptors and ligands for other molecules. During development, their behavior assists at properly positioning cells: they are responsible for the separation of the different tissue layers and for cellular migration. In the very early stages of development, E-cadherins (epithelial cadherin) are most greatly expressed. Many cadherins are specified for specific functions in the cell, and they are differentially expressed in a developing embryo. For example, during neurulation, when a neural plate forms in an embryo, the tissues residing near the cranial neural folds have decreased N-cadherin expression. Conversely, the expression of the N-cadherins remains unchanged in other regions of the neural tube that is located on the anterior-posterior axis of the vertebrate. N-cadherins have different functions that maintain the cell structure, cell-cell adhesion, internal adhesions. They participate greatly in keeping the ability of the structured heart due to pumping and release blood. Because of the contribution of N-cadherins adhering strongly between the cardiomyocytes, the heart can overcome the fracture, deformation, and fatigue that can result from the blood pressure. N-cadherin takes part in the development of the heart during embryogenesis, especially in sorting out of the precardiac mesoderm. N-cadherins are robustly expressed in precardiac mesoderm, but they do not take a role in cardiac linage. An embryo with N-cadherin mutation still forms the primitive heart tube; however, N-cadherin deficient mice will have difficulties in maintaining the cardiomyocytes development. The myocytes of these mice will end up with dissociated myocytes surrounding the endocardial cell layer when they cannot preserve the cell adhesion due to the heart starting to pump. As a result, the cardiac outflow tract will be blocked causing cardiac swelling. The expression of different types of cadherins in the cells varies dependent upon the specific differentiation and specification of an organism during development. Cadherins play a vital role in the migration of cells through the epithelial–mesenchymal transition, which requires cadherins to form adherents junctions with neighboring cells. In neural crest cells, which are transient cells that arise in the developing organism during gastrulation and function in the patterning of the vertebrate body plan, the cadherins are necessary to allow migration of cells to form tissues or organs. In addition, cadherins that are responsible in the epithelial–mesenchymal transition event in early development have also been shown to be critical in the reprogramming of specified adult cells into a pluripotent state, forming induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).

After development, cadherins play a role in maintaining cell and tissue structure, and in cellular movement. Regulation of cadherin expression can occur through promoter methylation among other epigenetic mechanisms.

===Tumour metastasis===

The E-cadherin–catenin complex plays a key role in cellular adhesion; loss of this function has been associated with increased invasiveness and metastasis of tumors. The suppression of E-cadherin expression is regarded as one of the main molecular events responsible for dysfunction in cell-cell adhesion, which can lead to local invasion and ultimately tumor development. Because E-cadherins play an important role in tumor suppression, they are also referred to as the &quot;suppressors of invasion&quot;.

Additionally, the overexpression of type 5, 6, and 17 cadherins alone or in combination can lead to cancer metastasis, and ongoing research aims to block their ability to function as ligands for integral membrane proteins.

=== Correlation to cancer ===
It has been discovered that cadherins and other additional factors are correlated to the formation and growth of some cancers and how a tumor continues to grow. The E-cadherins, known as the epithelial cadherins, are on the surface of one cell and can bind with those of the same kind on another to form bridges. The loss of the cell adhesion molecules, E cadherins, is causally involved in the formation of epithelial types of cancers such as carcinomas. The changes in any types of cadherin expression may not only control tumor cell adhesion but also may affect signal transduction leading to the cancer cells growing uncontrollably.

In epithelial cell cancers, disrupted cell to cell adhesion might lead to the development of secondary malignant growths; they are distant from the primary site of cancer and can result from the abnormalities in the expression of E-cadherins or its associated catenins. CAMs such as the cadherin glycoproteins that normally function as the glue and holds cells together act as important mediators of cell to cell interactions. E-cadherins, on the surface of all epithelial cells, are linked to the actin cytoskeleton through interactions with catenins in the cytoplasm. Thus, anchored to the cytoskeleton, E-cadherins on the surface of one cell can bind with those on another to form bridges. In epithelial cell cancers, disrupted cell-cell adhesion that might lead to metastases can result from abnormalities in the expression of E-cadherin or its associated catenins.

===Correlation to endometrium and embryogenesis===
This family of glycoproteins is responsible for calcium-dependent mechanism of intracellular adhesion. E-cadherins are crucial in embryogenesis during several processes, including gastrulation, neurulation, and organogenesis. Furthermore, suppression of E-cadherins impairs intracellular adhesion. The levels of these molecules increase during the luteal phase while their expression is regulated by progesterone with endometrial calcitonin.

==Types==
There are said to be over 100 different types of cadherins found in vertebrates, which can be classified into four groups: classical, desmosomal, protocadherins, and unconventional. These large amount of diversities are accomplished by having multiple cadherin encoding genes combined with alternative RNA splicing mechanisms. Invertebrates contain fewer than 20 types of cadherins.

===Classical===
Different members of the cadherin family are found in different locations.

* CDH1 – E-cadherin (epithelial): E-cadherins are found in epithelial tissue; not to be confused with the APC/C activator protein CDH1. E-cadherins play a vital role in cancer formation, as deregulation of E-cadherin functions is a crucial step in the formation of breast cancer tumors.
* CDH2 – N-cadherin (neural): N-cadherins are found in neurons
* CDH12 – cadherin 12, type 2 (N-cadherin 2)
* CDH3 – P-cadherin (placental): P-cadherins are found in the placenta.

===Desmosomal===
* Desmoglein (DSG1, DSG2, DSG3, DSG4)
* Desmocollin (DSC1, DSC2, DSC3)

===Protocadherins===

Protocadherins are the largest mammalian subgroup of the cadherin superfamily of homophilic cell-adhesion proteins.

<doc id="1201962" wikidata="Q5213183" url="?curid=1201962" title="Dan Brady (Ohio politician)">
<text>Daniel R. Brady of Cleveland, Ohio, is an American politician of the Democratic party. Brady holds a bachelor of arts degree in history and political science from Ohio University. An early staff member of Ohio Citizen Action, Brady was a member of the Cleveland City Council from 1986 to 1996. Brady was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives in 1996 and served one term. He was elected to the Ohio Senate in 1998. In 2001, he was elected Senate minority whip by the Democratic caucus. In 2010 he was elected to the inaugural Cuyahoga County Council representing the 3rd District on Cleveland&#x27;s near west side.

==Cleveland City Council==

Brady was a three-term councilman, serving from 1986 to 1996. As a council member, Mr. Brady was an advocate for the expansion of the Cleveland Public Power (CPP) system. As chairman of the city of Cleveland&#x27;s Public Utilities Committee from 1990 to 1996, he provided oversight for the expansion of CPP – the largest of its kind in the United States.

Mr. Brady also negotiated the city of Cleveland&#x27;s Cable Franchise agreement making provisions for five Public-access television cable TV channels and insured funding for broadcasting of Public, educational, and government access (PEG) channel programming. He has also served on the Finance, Safety, Health, Rules, Community Development, and City Planning committees.

== Ohio House of Representatives District 17 ==

Former District 17 included all of Lakewood and several west-side Cleveland wards. While serving in the minority of the Ohio House he secured $250,000 for The Beck Center For The Performing Arts.

Dan Brady opposed further reforms to the workers&#x27; compensation insurance system that would have reduced or eliminated benefits to injured workers. Brady opposed the Rebuttable Presumption Bill (House Bill 122) that assumed an injured worker who refused to take a drug and alcohol test up to 36 hours following an accident was at fault and automatically lost his or her benefits.

Dan Brady also supported the Ohio Supreme Court in its upholding of workers&#x27; rights when it ruled against anti-labor legislation. Brady campaigned across Ohio to re-elect Justice Resnick against millions in undisclosed out-of-state corporate money. Brady also led the fight against the legislative immunity amendment slipped into the budget bill (HB 94).

== Ohio State Senate District 23 ==

Mr. Brady served as an officer of the Ohio Senate as Assistant Minority Leader of the Democratic caucus. In July 2000, the Governor of Ohio signed Dan&#x27;s Safe Needle Legislation into law. Serving in the minority Dan was one of few Democratic legislators to pass significant legislation. SB 181 protected thousands of health care workers who are put at risk of getting deadly HIV or hepatitis when accidentally stuck with unsafe needles. The bill mandated the use of retracting needles in Ohio&#x27;s medical facilities.
He also served on the following committees: Finance &amp; Financial Institution&#x27;s, Education, Health, Human Services and Aging, Judiciary Committee on Civil Justice, Rules, Highways and Transportation and the Joint Legislative Ethic&#x27;s Committee. In addition, he was the Ranking Minority Member for the Natural Resources and Environment Committee, Insurance Commerce &amp; Labor as well as the State and Local Government Committee.

==Cuyahoga County Council==
In 2010, Brady was first elected to the then newly formed Cuyahoga County Council. He would then be reelected in 2014 and 2018, and is now in his third term. He became council president in 2015.

== Family ==
Dan&#x27;s wife Dona Brady (with whom he&#x27;s been married to since 1987) was a member of Cleveland City Council, holding Dan&#x27;s old seat that he vacated when he became an Ohio state representative (meaning that same seat has been held by a Brady - sans the period between Dan vacating the seat and Dona winning the succeeding special election - from 1986 to Dona&#x27;s resignation in 2020).

The Bradys have a daughter named Kelly, and a grandson named Jonathan.

<doc id="1201971" wikidata="Q1538280" url="?curid=1201971" title="Lou Holtz">
<text>Louis Leo Holtz (born January 6, 1937) is an American former college football coach and television analyst. He served as the head football coach at the College of William &amp; Mary (1969–1971), North Carolina State University (1972–1975), the New York Jets (1976), the University of Arkansas (1977–1983), the University of Minnesota (1984–1985), the University of Notre Dame (1986–1996), and the University of South Carolina (1999–2004), compiling a career college head coaching record of 249–132–7. Holtz&#x27;s 1988 Notre Dame team went 12–0 with a victory in the Fiesta Bowl and was the consensus national champion. Holtz is the only college football coach to lead six different programs to bowl games and the only coach to guide four different programs to the final top 15 rankings.

After retiring from coaching, Holtz worked as a TV college football analyst for CBS Sports in the 1990s and ESPN from 2005 until 2015. On May 1, 2008, Holtz was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame.

==Early life and coaching career==
Holtz was born in Follansbee, West Virginia, the son of Anne Marie (Tychonievich) and Andrew Holtz, a bus driver. His father was of German and Irish descent, while his maternal grandparents were emigrants from Chernobyl, Ukraine. He grew up in East Liverpool, Ohio, where he was raised as a Catholic. He graduated from East Liverpool High School. After high school, Holtz attended Kent State University. He was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity, and graduated in 1959 with a degree in history. Holtz also trained under Kent State&#x27;s Army Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps and earned a commission as a Field Artillery Officer in the United States Army Reserve at the time of his graduation from college. He began his coaching career as a graduate assistant in 1960, at Iowa, where he received his master&#x27;s degree. From there, he made stops as an assistant at William &amp; Mary (1961–1963), Connecticut (1964–1965), South Carolina (1966–1967) and Ohio State (1968). The 1968 Ohio State team won a national championship with Holtz as an assistant.

===William &amp; Mary===
Holtz&#x27;s first job as head coach came in 1969 at the College of William &amp; Mary, who played in the Southern Conference at that time. In 1970, he led the William &amp; Mary Indians (now Tribe) to the Southern Conference title and a berth in the Tangerine Bowl.

===North Carolina State===
In 1972, Holtz moved to North Carolina State University and had a 33–12–3 record in four seasons. His first three teams achieved final Top 20 rankings including a final Top 10 finish in the 1974 Coaches Poll. His 1973 team won the ACC Championship. His Wolfpack teams played in four bowl games, going 2–1–1. Following the 1975 season, Holtz accepted an offer to leave college football and become the head coach of the NFL&#x27;s New York Jets.

===New York Jets===
Holtz&#x27;s lone foray into the professional ranks began when he was appointed as head coach of the New York Jets on February 10, 1976. He was selected over Johnny Majors, Darryl Rogers, and Marv Levy. Holtz resigned ten months later on December 9 with the Jets at 3–10 and one game remaining in the 1976 season. Upon his departure, he lamented, &quot;God did not put Lou Holtz on this earth to coach in the pros.&quot;

===Arkansas===
Holtz went to the University of Arkansas in 1977. In his seven years there, the Razorbacks compiled a 60–21–2 record and reached six bowl games. In his first season at Arkansas, he led them to a berth in the 1978 Orange Bowl against the Oklahoma Sooners, then coached by University of Arkansas alumnus Barry Switzer. The Sooners were in position to win their third national championship in four seasons after top-ranked Texas lost earlier in the day to fifth-ranked Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl Classic. Arkansas&#x27; chances looked slim after the team lost several key personnel just before the game. In one of his last practices, All-American guard, Leotis Harris suffered a season-ending injury, and only a couple of days later Holtz suspended both starting running backs, Ben Cowins and Michael Forrest, and top receiver, Donny Bobo, for disciplinary reasons. However, behind an Orange Bowl record of 205 yards rushing from reserve running back Roland Sales the Hogs defeated the Sooners, 31–6. That team was recognized by the Rothman (FACT) poll as co-national champions, along with Texas and Notre Dame for 1977. Holtz was widely considered to be the leading candidate to replace Woody Hayes at Ohio State in 1979, but Holtz did not pursue the job because he did not want to follow Hayes.

Holtz led Arkansas to a 10–2 record and a share of the SWC championship in 1979 and a 9-2-1 record in 1982 with a Bluebonnet Bowl victory over Florida. Holtz was then dismissed following a 6–5 campaign in 1983. At the time, athletic director Frank Broyles stated that Holtz had resigned because he was &quot;tired and burned out&quot;, and was not fired. Broyles testified 20 years later that he had fired Holtz because he was losing the fan base with things he said and did. Holtz confirmed that he had been fired, but that Broyles never gave him a reason, although reports cited his political involvement as a major reason: controversy arose over his having taped two television advertisements from his coach&#x27;s office endorsing the re-election of Jesse Helms as Senator from North Carolina at a time when Helms was leading the effort to block Martin Luther King Jr. Day from becoming a national holiday.

===Minnesota===
Holtz accepted the head coaching job at the University of Minnesota before the 1984 season. The Golden Gophers had only won one game vs. Rice in 1983, but under Holtz won four games including 3 in the Big Ten. In 1985 the team was 7-5 and were invited to the Independence Bowl, where they defeated Clemson, 20–13. Holtz did not coach the Gophers in that bowl game, as he had already accepted the head coaching position at Notre Dame. His contract purportedly included a &quot;Notre Dame clause&quot; that allowed him to leave if that coaching job were to become available. 

Holtz&#x27;s tenure at Minnesota was not without controversy. Just prior to the 1991 Orange Bowl, the NCAA implicated the Holtz-era Golden Gophers for recruiting violations. Sanctions handed down in March 1991 included a bowl ban in 1992 for the Golden Gophers and &quot;two more years ... [of] continued probation&quot;.

===Notre Dame===

In 1986, Holtz left Minnesota to take over the then-struggling Notre Dame Fighting Irish football program. A taskmaster and strict disciplinarian, Holtz had the names removed from the backs of the players&#x27; jerseys when he took over at Notre Dame, wanting to emphasize team effort. With the exception of select bowl games, names have not been included on Notre Dame&#x27;s jerseys since. Although his 1986 squad posted an identical 5–6 mark that the 1985 edition had, five of their six losses were by a combined total of 14 points. In the season finale against the archrival USC Trojans, Notre Dame overcame a 17-point fourth-quarter deficit and pulled out a 38–37 win.

In his second season, Holtz led the Fighting Irish to an appearance in the 1988 Cotton Bowl Classic, where the Irish lost to the Texas A&amp;M Aggies, 35–10. The following year, Notre Dame won all eleven of their regular season games and defeated the third-ranked West Virginia Mountaineers, 34–21, in the Fiesta Bowl, claiming the national championship. The 1989 squad also won their first eleven games (and in the process set a school record with a 23-game winning streak) and remained in the No. 1 spot all season until losing to Miami in the season finale. A 21–6 win over Colorado in the Orange Bowl gave the Irish a second-place ranking in the final standings, as well as back-to-back 12-win seasons for the first time in school history.

Holtz&#x27;s 1993 Irish team ended the season with an 11–1 record and ranked second in the final AP poll. Although the Florida State Seminoles were defeated by the Irish in a battle of unbeatens during the regular season and both teams had only one loss at season&#x27;s end (Notre Dame lost to seventeenth-ranked Boston College), FSU was then voted national champion in the final 1993 AP and Coaches Poll. Between 1988 and 1993, Holtz&#x27;s teams posted an overall 64–9–1 record. He also took the Irish to bowl games for nine consecutive seasons, still a Notre Dame record.

Following an investigation in 1999, the NCAA placed Notre Dame on two years probation for extra benefits provided to football players between 1993 and 1999 by Kim Dunbar, a South Bend bookkeeper involved in a $1.4 million embezzlement scheme at her employer, as well as one instance of academic fraud that occurred under Holtz&#x27;s successor, Bob Davie. The NCAA found that Holtz and members of his staff learned of the violations but failed to make appropriate inquiry or to take prompt action, finding Holtz&#x27;s efforts &quot;inadequate.&quot;

On September 13, 2008, Lou Holtz was invited back to the campus where a statue of the former coach was unveiled. The ceremony took place during the weekend of the Notre Dame/Michigan game, almost twenty-two years to the day after Holtz coached his first Notre Dame team against the Wolverines.

Occasionally, despite his lack of success with the New York Jets, he was rumored to be leaving Notre Dame for the NFL. Following a 6–10 season in 1990 and an 8–8 showing in 1991, the Minnesota Vikings were rumored to replace Jerry Burns with Holtz. However, Holtz denied these rumors each of those two seasons. Holtz remained at Notre Dame; the Vikings, meanwhile, hired Dennis Green to replace the retired Jerry Burns. 

====First retirement====
Lou Holtz left Notre Dame after the 1996 season. In 1996, two members of the Minnesota Vikings&#x27;s ownership board, Wheelock Whitney and Jaye F. Dyer, reportedly contacted Holtz. They wanted to bring him in to replace Dennis Green. Of the rumors surrounding the reasons for Holtz&#x27;s retirement, one of them was the possible Vikings head coaching position.

===South Carolina===
After two seasons as a commentator for CBS Sports, Holtz came out of retirement in 1999 and returned to the University of South Carolina, where he had been an assistant in the 1960s. The year before Holtz arrived, the Gamecocks went 1–10, and the team subsequently went 0–11 during Holtz&#x27;s first season. In his second season, South Carolina went 8–4, winning the Outback Bowl over the heavily favored Ohio State Buckeyes. The eight-game improvement from the previous year was the best in the nation in 2000 and the third best single-season turnaround in NCAA history. It also earned National Coach of the Year honors for Holtz from &quot;Football News&quot; and &quot;American Football Coaches Quarterly&quot;. In his third season, Holtz&#x27;s success continued, leading the Gamecocks to a 9–3 record and another Outback Bowl victory over Ohio State. The nine wins for the season were the second highest total in the history of the program. Under Holtz&#x27;s leadership, the Gamecocks posted their best two-year mark in school history from 2000 to 2001, going 17–7 overall and 10–6 in SEC play.

After consecutive 5–7 campaigns in 2002 and 2003, Holtz finished his South Carolina tenure on a winning note with a 6–5 record in 2004. Holtz&#x27;s time in Columbia saw the resurrection of Gamecock Football, as the program had only one bowl win and no Top 25 finishes in the ten years before his hire. Upon his exit, USC had posted AP Top 25 finishes in 2000 and 2001 (#19 and No. 13 respectively) and had made consecutive New Year&#x27;s Day bowls for the first time in its history. Holtz finished his six-year tenure at South Carolina with a 2–4 record versus his former team, Arkansas, beating the Razorbacks in Columbia, SC in 2000 and 2004.

In 2005, the NCAA imposed three years probation and reductions in two scholarships on the program for ten admitted violations under Holtz, five of which were found to be major. The violations involved improper tutoring and off-season workouts, as well as a lack of institutional control. No games were forfeited, and no television or postseason ban was imposed. Holtz issued a statement after the sanctions were announced stating, &quot;There was no money involved. No athletes were paid. There were no recruiting inducements. No cars. No jobs offered. No ticket scandal.&quot;

====Second retirement====
On November 18, 2004, Holtz announced that he would retire at the end of the season. On November 20, 2004, the Clemson – South Carolina brawl took place during Holtz&#x27;s last regular season game. Instead of ending his career at a post-season bowl game, which was expected, the two universities announced that each would penalize their respective football programs for their unsportsmanlike conduct by declining any bowl game invitations. At his last press conference as South Carolina&#x27;s coach, Holtz said it was ironic that he and former Ohio State coach Woody Hayes both would be remembered for &quot;getting into a fight at the Clemson game&quot;. Holtz also alluded to his assistance in recruiting his successor, Steve Spurrier.

==Broadcasting career==
Holtz has worked for CBS Sports as a college football analyst and in the same capacity for the cable network ESPN. He worked on the secondary studio team, located in Bristol as opposed to the game site. He typically appeared on pregame, halftime, and postgame shows of college football games. In addition, he appeared on &quot;College Football Scoreboard&quot;, &quot;College Football Final&quot;, &quot;College Football Live&quot;, &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, and the occasional game. He typically partnered with Rece Davis and Mark May. Holtz came under scrutiny after referencing Adolf Hitler in an on-air comment while appearing on &quot;College Football Live&quot; in 2008. In his analysis of Michigan Wolverines head coach Rich Rodriguez, Holtz stated sarcastically, &quot;Ya know, Hitler was a great leader, too.&quot; The next day, Holtz apologized for the comment during halftime of a game between Clemson and Georgia Tech. On April 12, 2015, it was reported by SB Nation that Holtz was leaving ESPN.

==Personal life==
Holtz was married to Beth Barcus from July 22, 1961, until her death from cancer on June 30, 2020. Holtz currently resides in Lake Nona Golf &amp; Country Club in Orlando, Florida. He and Beth had four children, three of whom are Notre Dame graduates. His children include head coach Skip Holtz. His cousins Ashton and Kerosene Holtz both played football in Fort Scott, Kansas, as a linebacker and defensive end. Holtz is on the Catholic Advisory Board of the Ave Maria Mutual Funds, and gives motivational speeches. Coach Holtz is a member at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. On June 23, 2015, Holtz&#x27;s Lake Nona home was damaged by a house fire that was most likely triggered by a lightning strike.

Holtz has long been active in Republican Party politics, including his support for Helms, hosting former Vice President Dan Quayle in a 1999 fundraising tour, speaking at a 2007 House Republicans strategy meeting and considering entering the Republican primary for a Congressional seat in Florida in 2009. However, he also made a contribution of $2,300 to the campaign of Democratic Party Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2008. In 2016, Holtz endorsed Donald Trump for president. In 2020, Holtz voiced his support for Amy Coney Barrett&#x27;s nomination the United States Supreme Court. He often appears on &quot;Hannity&quot; on the Fox News Channel.

On August 26, 2020, Holtz spoke at the Republican National Convention endorsing Donald Trump for re-election. 
During his address at the 2020 Republican National Convention, Holtz said that Democratic Presidential Nominee Joe Biden was &quot;a Catholic in name only.&quot; The University of Notre Dame also released a statement the following day to distance itself from Holtz&#x27;s comment regarding Biden.

Holtz has been vocal about his disapproval of Colin Kaepernick taking a knee before NFL games and NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, allowing players to do so. Holtz told Scoop B Radio&#x27;s Brandon Scoop B Robinson that players should go to inner city neighborhoods and be influential in their community rather than kneeling.

===Popular culture===
Holtz appeared as himself in a Discover Card commercial in November 2011. A 1994 episode of &quot;Coach&quot; had the protagonist Hayden Fox covertly traveling to a nation under sanction from the United States in an attempt to sign a native who is an incredible place kicker, only to find Lou Holtz has beaten him to the punch, signing the kicker for Notre Dame.

<doc id="1201973" wikidata="Q4582419" url="?curid=1201973" title="1985 Narita International Airport bombing">
<text>--&gt;
The 1985 Narita International Airport bombing was the attempted terrorist bombing of Air India Flight 301, which took place on June 23, 1985. A bomb hidden in a suitcase transiting through Narita International Airport, then known as New Tokyo International Airport, exploded at 06:19 in a baggage handling room, killing two baggage handlers and injuring another four. The bomb exploded prematurely while the plane was still grounded. The attack at Narita was part of an attempted double-bombing orchestrated by Talwinder Singh Parmar, a Canadian national, and the Khalistani terrorist organization, Babbar Khalsa. The bombs were made by Inderjit Singh Reyat.

The suitcase bomb had come from Vancouver, Canada through CP Air Flight 003 and was transiting through the airport for Air India Flight 301 to Bangkok, Thailand before continuing on to Delhi, India.

The initial plan was for the Air India Flight 301 bomb to explode at the same time as the one that had been planted aboard Air India Flight 182. However, Flight 182&#x27;s bomb exploded over the Atlantic Ocean off the southwest tip of the coast of Ireland, just one hour after 301&#x27;s bomb, because the plan had failed to take into account that Japan did not observe daylight saving time. As a result the bomb at the Narita Airport exploded while 301 was still grounded, earlier than the perpetrators had planned. Had the plan worked the bomb would have exploded inside Air India Flight 301 instead of inside the airport.

Extensive analysis by the Japanese investigators identified bomb parts through serial numbers and narrowed the pieces to less than 2000 possible electronic tuners of an older model shipped to Vancouver, Canada, allowing Canadian police to identify a single person who had bought this older model recently. At the same time in the inquiry to the Air India Flight 182 bombing, investigators had identified that the man checked-in luggage without boarding the plane. Inderjit Singh Reyat, who lived in Duncan, British Columbia, was convicted in Canadian court. He was found guilty in 1991 in the Narita bombing. In 2003, shortly before the start of the Air India trial, he made a plea bargain on reduced charges and a promise of testimony against other suspects. He made the bombs used in both attacks.

== Timeline of the incident ==
On June 22, 1985, the bags of a passenger named L. Singh were checked in at Vancouver for Canadian Pacific Airlines (CP Air) 003 to New Tokyo International Airport in Narita, Japan, near Tokyo. This bag was interlined to Air India Flight 301 leaving for Don Muang International Airport in Bangkok, Thailand. L. Singh was assigned seat 38H.

At 20:37 UTC, CP Air Flight 003 (named &quot;Empress of Australia&quot;), departed Vancouver; no L. Singh was on board.

At 05:41 UTC (now June 23), CP Air 003 arrived in Tokyo Narita 14 minutes early.

At 06:19 UTC, a piece of luggage that had come from CP Air 3 exploded as it was being transferred to Air India Flight 301; the explosion killed two Japanese baggage handlers (Hideo Asano and Hideharu Koda) in Narita Airport and injured four other people.

At 07:14 UTC, Air India Flight 182 exploded in mid-air off the west coast of Ireland, falling into the sea. All 329 people on board were killed. Investigation by Canada has revealed connections between the two bombings.

At 08:05 UTC, Air India Flight 301 left Narita and arrived in Thailand unscathed and with no incidents.

February 1988 – Inderjit Singh Reyat is arrested by West Midlands Police in Coventry, United Kingdom.

December 8, 1989 – The British government agrees to extradite Reyat to Canada, following a lengthy court battle and trial.

May 10, 1991 – Inderjit Singh Reyat receives a ten-year sentence after being convicted of two counts of manslaughter terms and four explosives charges relating to the Narita Airport 1985 bombing.

==Second bombing==

Fifty-five minutes after, at 08:14 Irish time, Air India Flight 182 exploded mid-air and plunged into the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of Ireland, killing 329 people. Canadian security forces believe that the incidents were related, as noted in a 2010 report by a government commission. They were supposedly both developed by Babbar Khalsa, the Sikh separatist group operating in Canada. Investigators believe the bombings were intended to be simultaneous, but the terrorist planners were not aware that while Canada observes daylight saving time, Japan does not.

==Trials==
The trial for the Narita bombing took place in Canada in 1991. The only man convicted of any involvement in the bombings was Inderjit Singh Reyat, a British Columbia resident who had built the bombs used. He received a ten-year sentence of two counts of manslaughter and four explosives charges after being found guilty in May 1991 of the Narita bombing in federal court in Vancouver, British Columbia.

In 2003, weeks before the start of the Air India Flight 182 trial, Reyat made a deal with prosecutors. In exchange for pleading guilty to the charge of manslaughter in the Flight 182 bombing, he was sentenced to five years in prison. He also had to testify against the two other men tried in Canada for these incidents, Ripudaman Singh Malik and Ajaib Singh Bagri. Justice Ian Josephson acquitted them, as he believed that the prosecutors had not been able to meet the standard of proof &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;

In reading the verdicts of Malik and Bagri, Justice Josephson commented about Reyat&#x27;s testimony at their trial:
Even the most sympathetic of listeners could only conclude, as do I, that his evidence was patently and pathetically fabricated in an attempt to minimize his involvement in his crime to an extreme degree, while refusing to reveal relevant information he clearly possesses. His hollow expression of remorse for his crime must have been a bitter pill for the families of the victims.

In 2006 Crown Counsel in British Columbia announced they would be charging Reyat with perjury, based on his testimony at the Air India Flight 182 trial. It is alleged that he committed perjury 27 times during his testimony. In 2008, the court granted bail; he had already served 20 years in jail since his first arrest. The trial on perjury charges was scheduled for 2009. He was convicted of perjury in 2011 and sentenced to nine years, with 17 months&#x27; credit for time already served.

<doc id="1201980" wikidata="Q5106989" url="?curid=1201980" title="The Tholian Web">
<text>&quot;The Tholian Web&quot; is the ninth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Judy Burns and Chet Richards and directed by Herb Wallerstein, it was first broadcast on November 15, 1968.

In the episode, Captain Kirk is caught between dimensions while the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; works to retrieve him. All the while, the Tholians are weaving a destructive energy web around the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

==Plot==
The starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; searches for the USS &quot;Defiant&quot;. Sensors detect fractures in space, and a power loss affects all systems. &quot;Defiant&quot; is found adrift, and Captain Kirk, First Officer Spock, Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy, and Navigator Ensign Chekov transport over wearing environmental suits. Aboard &quot;Defiant&quot;, they find the crew dead, apparently having killed one another.

The boarding party discovers that &quot;Defiant&quot; is fading out of our universe. With limited transporter functionality due to the malfunctions, Kirk orders his men to return to &quot;Enterprise&quot;. As Chief Engineer Scott tries to beam Kirk aboard, &quot;Defiant&quot; vanishes.

Spock determines that the local space is experiencing periods of &quot;interphase&quot;, when two parallel dimensions merge. He believes Kirk will reappear during the next interphase. As he explains the situation, Chekov lashes out in anger, a symptom McCoy believes is due to their proximity to &quot;Defiant&quot;. Spock refuses to move the ship, fearful of disrupting local space and losing the Captain.

With two hours until the next interphase, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is approached by an unfamiliar ship. Its captain, Commander Loskene of the Tholian Assembly, asserts that &quot;Enterprise&quot; has violated Tholian space and must leave. Spock persuades Loskene to wait one hour and fifty-three minutes. When the time is up, Kirk does not reappear; Spock concludes that the arrival of the Tholian ship disrupted the interphase.

When the &quot;Enterprise&quot; is attacked by Loskene, McCoy again urges Spock to leave, believing Kirk lost. Spock returns fire and the Tholian ship is disabled, but the &quot;Enterprise&quot; takes damage and begins drifting. A second Tholian ship joins the first, and the two begin weaving an energy web that will cage the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

Spock and McCoy view a tape left by Kirk, to be played in the event of his death, which implores the two of them to work together. Lieutenant Uhura and Scott both report seeing ghostly manifestations of Kirk. Finally, the apparition is seen on the bridge; Kirk is still in his environmental suit.

With the Tholian web nearly complete, McCoy dispenses an antidote to the effects of the local space, and Spock determines the time of Kirk&#x27;s next appearance. They lock onto Kirk&#x27;s coordinates, and Spock orders the activation of the ship&#x27;s engines, which carries them through the spatial rift. Kirk is brought along by the transporter lock, and beamed aboard just as his oxygen runs out.

On the bridge, Kirk questions Spock and McCoy about their handling of the emergency, particularly concerning the tape. McCoy and Spock claim they did not have time to watch it, and Kirk accepts their answers.

==Subsequent appearances==

In a two-part episode of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; called &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot;, it is revealed that the &quot;Defiant&quot; has reappeared in the Mirror Universe of Archer&#x27;s time, where it is first salvaged by the Tholians and then stolen by the Terran Empire.

==Reception==
In 2015, SyFy ranked this episode as one of the top ten essential &quot;Star Trek&quot; original series Spock episodes.

In 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; rated &quot;The Tholian Web&quot; the 75th best television episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise television shows prior to &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;.

A 2018 &quot;Star Trek&quot; binge-watching guide by &quot;Den of Geek&quot;, recommended this episode for featuring the trio of characters Kirk, Spock, and Bones of the original series.

==Popular culture==
In 1997 it became known that United States Customs investigators had used the name &quot;Tholian Web&quot; for a sting operation designed to root out and arrest child porn criminals. 
By 1997 it had triggered hundreds of prosecutions.

In 2010 Gerry W. Beyer, of the Texas Tech University School of Law, cited a video recording introduced in this episode, which Captain Kirk, Captain of the starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;, had left for his two most senior officers to play in the event of his death, urging them to overcome their personal animosity.
Beyer described this fictional recording as one of the first recorded instances of what he called a &quot;video-will&quot;.

Political scientists have compared the metaphor of the entrapment in this episode with the deep challenges politicians and administrators feel when confronted with competing factions and lobby groups.

== Home video ==
&quot;The Tholian Web&quot; was released in 1988 on LaserDisc in the United States. It was published by Paramount Home Video, and was released as a pair with &quot;For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky&quot;. &quot;Star Trek&quot; titles were popular on the growing home video market in the 1980s, and the Star Trek II film had helped establish the home video market.

This episode was released in Japan on December 21, 1993, as part of the complete season 3 LaserDisc set, &quot;Star Trek: Original Series log.3&quot;. A trailer for this and the other episodes was also included on an additional disc, and the episode had English and Japanese audio tracks. The cover script was スター・トレック TVサードシーズン for the set.

<text>:&quot;Includes coverage of New York Journal-American and its predecessors New York Journal, The Journal, New York American and New York Evening Journal&quot;
The New York Journal-American was a daily newspaper published in New York City from 1937 to 1966. The &quot;Journal-American&quot; was the product of a merger between two New York newspapers owned by William Randolph Hearst: the New York American (originally the New York Journal, renamed &quot;American&quot; in 1901), a morning paper, and the New York Evening Journal, an afternoon paper. Both were published by Hearst from 1895 to 1937. The &quot;American&quot; and &quot;Evening Journal&quot; merged in 1937.

==History==
===Beginnings===
====&quot;New York Morning Journal&quot; ====
Joseph Pulitzer&#x27;s younger brother Albert founded the New York Morning Journal in 1882. After three years of its existence, John R. McLean briefly acquired the paper in 1895. It was renamed The Journal. But a year later in 1896, he sold it to Hearst.

====&quot;New York American&quot;====
In 1901, the morning newspaper was renamed New York American.

====&quot;New York Evening Journal&quot;====
Hearst founded the New York Evening Journal about a year later in 1896. He entered into a circulation war with the &quot;New York World&quot;, the newspaper run by his former mentor Joseph Pulitzer and from whom he stole the cartoonists George McManus and Richard F. Outcault. In October 1896, Outcault defected to Hearst&#x27;s &quot;New York Journal&quot;. Because Outcault had failed in his effort to copyright &quot;The Yellow Kid&quot; both newspapers published versions of the comic feature with George Luks providing the &quot;New York World&quot; with their version after Outcault left. &quot;The Yellow Kid&quot; was one of the first comic strips to be printed in color and gave rise to the phrase yellow journalism, used to describe the sensationalist and often exaggerated articles, which helped, along with a one-cent price tag, to greatly increase circulation of the newspaper. Many believed that as part of this, aside from any nationalistic sentiment, Hearst may have helped to initiate the Spanish–American War of 1898 with lurid exposes of Spanish atrocities against insurgents and foreign journalists.

====&quot;New York Journal-American&quot;====
In 1937, the morning &quot;New York American&quot; (since 1901) and the evening paper &quot;New York Evening Journal&quot; merged into New York Journal-American. The &quot;Journal-American&quot; was a publication with several editions in the afternoon and evening.

===Comics===
In the early 1900s, Hearst weekday morning and afternoon papers around the country featured scattered black-and-white comic strips, and on January 31, 1912, Hearst introduced the nation&#x27;s first full daily comics page in the &quot;Evening Journal&quot;. On January 12, 1913, McManus launched his &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot; comic strip. The comics expanded into two full pages daily and a 12-page Sunday color section with leading King Features Syndicate strips. By the mid-1940s, the newspaper&#x27;s Sunday comics included &quot;Bringing Up Father&quot;, &quot;Blondie&quot;, a full-page &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, &quot;The Little King&quot;, &quot;Buz Sawyer&quot;, Feg Murray&#x27;s &quot;Seein&#x27; Stars&quot;, &quot;Tim Tyler&#x27;s Luck&quot;, Gene Ahern&#x27;s &quot;Room and Board&quot; and &quot;The Squirrel Cage&quot;, &quot;The Phantom&quot;, &quot;Jungle Jim&quot;, &quot;Tillie the Toiler&quot;, &quot;Little Annie Rooney&quot;, &quot;Little Iodine&quot;, Bob Green&#x27;s &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, &quot;Believe It or Not!&quot;, &quot;Uncle Remus&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Donald Duck&quot;, &quot;Tippie&quot;, &quot;Right Around Home&quot;, &quot;Barney Google and Snuffy Smith&quot;, and &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot;.

Tad Dorgan, known for his boxing and dog cartoons, as well as the comic character Judge Rummy, joined the &quot;Journal&quot;&#x27;s staff in 1905.

In 1922, the &quot;Evening Journal&quot; introduced a Saturday color comics tabloid with strips not seen on Sunday, and this 12-page tabloid continued for decades, offering &quot;Popeye&quot;, &quot;Grandma&quot;, Don Tobin&#x27;s &quot;The Little Woman&quot;, &quot;Mandrake the Magician&quot;, Don Flowers&#x27; &quot;Glamor Girls&quot;, &quot;Grin and Bear It&quot;, &quot;Buck Rogers&quot;, and other strips.

Rube Goldberg and Einar Nerman also became cartoonists with the &quot;Journal-American&quot;.

===Columnists and reporters===

The &quot;Evening Journal&quot; was home to famed investigative reporter Nellie Bly, who began writing for the paper in 1914 as a war correspondent from the battlefields of World War I. Bly eventually returned to the United States and was given her own column that she wrote right up until her death in 1922.

Popular columnists included Ambrose Bierce, Benjamin De Casseres, Dorothy Kilgallen, O. O. McIntyre, and Westbrook Pegler. Kilgallen also wrote articles that appeared on the same days as her column on different pages, sometimes the front page. Regular &quot;Journal-American&quot; contributor Jimmy Cannon was one of the highest paid sports columnists in the United States. Society columnist Maury Henry Biddle Paul, who wrote under the pseudonym &quot;Cholly Knickerbocker&quot;, became famous and coined the term &quot;Café Society&quot;. John F. Kennedy contributed to the newspaper during a brief career as a journalist during the final months of World War II. Leonard Liebling served as the paper&#x27;s music critic from 1923 to 1936.

===Staff===
Beginning in 1938, Max Kase (1898–1974) was the sports editor until the newspaper expired in 1966. The fashion editor was Robin Chandler Duke.

Jack O&#x27;Brian (1914–2000) was television critic for the &quot;Journal-American&quot; and exposed the 1958 quiz-show scandal that involved cheating on the popular television program &quot;Twenty-One&quot;. O&#x27;Brian was a supporter of Senator Joseph McCarthy and his series of published attacks on CBS News and WCBS-TV reporter Don Hollenbeck, may have been a major factor in Hollenbeck&#x27;s eventual suicide, referenced in the 1986 HBO film &quot;Murrow&quot; and the 2005 motion picture &quot;Good Night, and Good Luck&quot;.

Ford Frick (1894–1978) was a sportswriter for the &quot;American&quot; before becoming president of baseball&#x27;s National League (1934–1951), then commissioner of Major League Baseball (1951–1965). Frick was hired by Wilton S. Farnsworth, who was sports editor of the &quot;American&quot; from 1914 to 1937 until becoming a boxing promoter.

Bill Corum was a sportswriter for the &quot;Journal-American&quot; who also served nine years as president of the Churchill Downs race track. Frank Graham covered sports there from 1945 to 1965 and was inducted in the Baseball Hall of Fame, as were colleagues Charley Feeney and Sid Mercer.

Before becoming a news columnist elsewhere, Jimmy Breslin was a &quot;Journal-American&quot; sportswriter in the early 1960s. He authored the book &quot;Can&#x27;t Anybody Here Play This Game?&quot; chronicling the season of the 1962 New York Mets.

Sheilah Graham (1904–1988) was a reporter for the &quot;Journal-American&quot; before gaining fame as a gossip columnist and as an acquaintance of F. Scott Fitzgerald.

William V. Finn, a staff photographer, died on the morning of June 25, 1958, while photographing the aftermath of a fiery collision between the tanker &quot;Empress Bay&quot; and cargo ship &quot;Nebraska&quot; in the East River. Finn was a past-president of the New York Press Photographers Association and was the second of only two of the association&#x27;s members to die in the line of duty.

===Photographs===
The newspaper was famous for publishing many photographs with the &quot;Journal-American Photo&quot; credit line as well as news photographs from the Associated Press and other wire services.

==Decline==
With one of the highest circulations in New York in the 1950s and 1960s, the &quot;Journal-American&quot; nevertheless had difficulties attracting advertising as its blue-collar reading base turned to television, a situation compounded by the fact that television news was affecting evening newspapers more than their morning counterparts. The domination of television news became evident starting with the four-day period of JFK&#x27;s assassination, Jack Ruby&#x27;s shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald and both men&#x27;s funerals. New York newspapers in general were in dire straits by then, following a devastating newspaper strike in late 1962 and early 1963.

&quot;Journal-American&quot; editors, apparently sensing that psychotherapy and rock music were starting to enter the consciousness of both blue-collar and white-collar New Yorkers, enlisted Dr. Joyce Brothers to write front-page articles in February 1964 analyzing the Beatles. While the Beatles were filming &quot;Help!&quot; in the Bahamas, columnist Phyllis Battelle interviewed them for articles that ran on the &quot;Journal-American&quot; front page and in other Hearst papers, including the &quot;Los Angeles Herald Examiner&quot;, for four consecutive days, from April 25 to 28, 1965.

During every visit that the Beatles made to New York in 1964 and 1965, including their appearances at Shea Stadium, various &quot;Journal-American&quot; columnists and reporters devoted a lot of space to them.

Throughout 1964 and 1965, Dorothy Kilgallen&#x27;s &quot;Voice of Broadway&quot; column, which ran Sunday through Friday, often reported short news items about trendy young rock groups and performers such as The Rolling Stones, The Animals, The Dave Clark Five, Mary Wells and Sam Cooke. The newspaper was trying to keep up with the many mid-1960s changes in popular music and its interracial fan bases.

 It published enlarged photographs of civil rights demonstrations, Dorothy Kilgallen&#x27;s skepticism about the Warren Commission report as well as many reporters&#x27; stories on the increasing crime rate in New York&#x27;s five boroughs.

Most of the front page of the Sunday edition of January 12, 1964 ran stories that were relevant to the previous day&#x27;s announcement by U.S. Surgeon General Luther Terry that &quot;a blue ribbon committee of scientists and doctors,&quot; in the words of reporter Jack Pickering, had concluded that cigarette smoking was dangerous.

The &quot;Journal-American&quot;″s feel of the pulse of the changing times of the mid-1960s hid the trouble that was going on behind the scenes at the paper, which was unknown to many New Yorkers until after it had ceased publication.

Besides trouble with advertisers, another major factor that led to the &quot;Journal-American&quot;″s demise was a power struggle between Hearst CEO Richard E. Berlin and two of Hearst&#x27;s sons, who had trouble carrying on the father&#x27;s legacy after his 1951 death. William Randolph Hearst Jr. claimed in 1991 that Berlin, who died in 1986, had suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease starting in the mid-1960s and that caused him to shut down several Hearst newspapers without just cause.

==Merger==
The &quot;Journal-American&quot; ceased publishing in April 1966, officially the victim of a general decline in the revenue of afternoon newspapers. While participating in a lock-out in 1965 after &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;New York Daily News&quot; had been struck by a union, the &quot;Journal-American&quot; agreed it would merge (the following year) with its evening rival, the &quot;New York World-Telegram and Sun&quot;, and the morning &quot;New York Herald-Tribune&quot;. According to its publisher, publication of the combined &quot;New York World Journal Tribune&quot; was delayed for several months after the April 1966 expiration of its three components because of difficulty reaching an agreement with manual laborers who were needed to operate the press. The &quot;World Journal Tribune&quot; commenced publication on September 12, 1966, but folded eight months later.

==Archives==
Other afternoon and evening newspapers that expired following the rise of network news in the 1960s donated their clipping files and many darkroom prints of published photographs to libraries. The Hearst Corporation decided to donate the &quot;basic back-copy morgue&quot; of the &quot;Journal-American&quot;, according to a book about Dorothy Kilgallen, plus darkroom prints and negatives, according to other sources, to the University of Texas at Austin. Office memorandums and letters from politicians and other notables were shredded in 1966, shortly after the newspaper expired.

Unlike two other New York City daily newspapers, the tabloid &quot;New York Daily News&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Journal-American&quot; has not been digitized and can not be accessed in a database or online archive. The newspaper is preserved on microfilm in New York City, Washington, DC, and Austin, Texas. Interlibrary loans make the microfilm accessible to people who cannot travel to those cities. The COVID-19 pandemic curtailed interlibrary loans, especially for researchers who need reels of microfilm that exist in very few places. On rare occasions, researchers have digitally scanned &quot;Journal-American&quot; pages, articles or columns, such as Dorothy Kilgallen&#x27;s, from microfilm and shared them on social media and other websites. These are rare opportunities for historians to become familiar with this newspaper.

The &quot;Journal-American&quot; photo morgue is housed at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The photographic morgue consists of approximately two million prints and one million negatives created for publication, with the bulk of the collection covering the years from 1937 to the paper&#x27;s demise in 1966. The Dolph Briscoe Center for American History, also at the University of Texas at Austin, has the &quot;Journal-American&quot; morgue of clippings, numbering approximately nine million. Because they are not digitized and because employees of the facility have limited time for communicating by email with people who are searching for very old articles, the people who are searching should know the date of a &quot;Journal-American&quot; article to locate it on microfilm.

<doc id="1201992" wikidata="Q4799808" url="?curid=1201992" title="Arthur Naftalin">
<text>Arthur Naftalin (June 28, 1917 – May 16, 2005) was an American political scientist and politician. A member of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL), he served as mayor of Minneapolis from July 3, 1961, to July 6, 1969. He was the first Jewish mayor of Minneapolis.

==Early life==
Naftalin was born in Fargo, North Dakota, one of four children of Sandel and Tillie Naftalin. He was married to Frances Healy Naftalin; among their children is Mark Naftalin, a musician who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015 as a member of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Their other notable children are David Michael Bismarck and Gail Marie Naftalin.

==University of Minnesota and Hubert Humphrey==
Naftalin came to Minneapolis to attend the University of Minnesota, from which he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1939 and a PhD in 1948. His dissertation was a history of the Farmer-Labor Party of Minnesota. During this time, he became acquainted with Hubert Humphrey and helped Humphrey lead the merger of Minnesota&#x27;s Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties into the DFL in 1944.

In 1945, Humphrey was elected mayor and Naftalin was appointed to work in his office. Naftalin later became a professor in the department of political science at the University of Minnesota. He served as commissioner of administration under Governor Orville L. Freeman.

==Mayor==
In 1961, he won the first of his four two-year terms as mayor, defeating incumbent Republican Mayor P. Kenneth Peterson by a margin of 52.04% to 47.96%. He attended the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and was present at Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. He ran for the DFL endorsement for lieutenant governor in 1966. In 1967, he called in the National Guard to quell the 1967 Plymouth Avenue civil unrest. Naftalin declined to seek reelection in 1969, becoming the only mayor of Minneapolis in the period 1913–1979 who never resigned or lost an election. Naftalin was succeeded by Charlie Stenvig, a police officer with no previous political experience who promised a &quot;law and order&quot; approach to any future civil unrest.

==Life after leaving office==
After leaving office, Naftalin became a professor in the department of public affairs at the University of Minnesota (now the Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs). In 1971, he joined the board of directors of the Citizens League, and served as president of the board in 1975–1976. From 1976 to 1987, he produced and hosted 500 installments of &quot;Minnesota Issues&quot;, a weekly public-affairs program on local public television station KTCA. In 1980 he produced, wrote, and narrated a series of one-hour television documentaries about former Minnesota governors. He retired in 1987.

On the morning of May 16, 2005, Naftalin struck his head in a fall, went into a coma, and died later in the day at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis. He donated his body to the University of Minnesota for research.

<text>Illinois Route 26 (IL 26, Illinois 26) is a north–south state highway in central and north-central Illinois. It runs from Illinois Route 116 just north of East Peoria to Highway 69 at the Wisconsin border near Orangeville. This is a distance of .

== Route description ==
Illinois 26 is a two to four lane surface highway for the majority of its length. Its southern terminus is just one mile (1.6 km) north of the McClugage Bridge carrying U.S. Route 150 into Peoria.

Illinois 26 mostly follows the east bank of the Illinois River until it crosses the river at Hennepin. It runs concurrent with Illinois Route 29, its Illinois River west bank counterpart, at Bureau and with U.S. Route 52 near Freeport.

== History ==
SBI Route 26 originally ran from Freeport to Polo, on part of current IL-26. In 1937, IL-26 was extended from Freeport to the WI state line, in place of IL-74, and extended from Polo to Bureau along US-52 to Dixon, and replacing IL-89 from Dixon to Bureau. In 1969, it was extended south to East Peoria replacing IL-87.

In northern Stephenson County, IL 26 originally ran through downtown Orangeville and the unincorporated community of Oneco. In 1990, it was rerouted onto a new at-grade bypass around the village, decreasing travel time.

IL-26 was rerouted onto the nearby I-180 bridge over the Illinois River near Hennepin during the 1990s. The older IL-26 bridge, half a mile south of I-180, was removed after 1999. the old approaches are now local roads, used mainly as access to riverside industries on both banks.

<text>Mark Naftalin (born August 2, 1944) is an American blues keyboardist and record producer. He appears on the first five albums by Paul Butterfield Blues Band in the mid 1960s as a band member, and as such was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. He later worked onstage with the late fellow Butterfield Band member Mike Bloomfield and has been active from his home in Marin County, California, in the San Francisco Bay Area as a festival and radio producer for several decades.

==Career==
Naftalin moved to Chicago in 1961, and graduated from the University of Chicago in 1964, where he performed on piano at campus &quot;twist parties,&quot; popular at the time. It was at these parties that Naftalin first played with blues harmonica player Paul Butterfield and guitarist Elvin Bishop, the nucleus of what was to become the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Naftalin then came to prominence as the keyboard player in the Butterfield Blues Band, from 1965-1968. On the group&#x27;s first album, he solos and has a writing credit on the instrumental track &quot;Thank You Mr. Poobah.&quot; On the second album by the band, &quot;East West,&quot; he is credited as &quot;Naffy Markham&quot;.

In the late 1960s, after the first four Butterfield albums, Naftalin went out on his own, settling in the San Francisco Bay Area. There he put together the Mark Naftalin &quot;Rhythm &amp; Blues Revue&quot; and has been active in blues and rock recording sessions, solo gigs and revue shows, and as a producer of concerts, festivals and radio shows. He played as a duo with fellow Butterfield bandsman Mike Bloomfield. He also in a band (most often called Mike Bloomfield &amp; Friends) from the late 1960s through the mid-1970s. He hosted &quot;Mark Naftalin&#x27;s Blue Monday Party&quot;, a weekly blues show (1979–1983) that featured over 60 blues artists and groups and was the scene of 86 live radio broadcasts and three TV specials.

Naftalin has produced the Marin County Blues Festival (1981–2000), and has been the associate producer of the Monterey Jazz Festival&#x27;s &quot;Blues Afternoon&quot; (1982–1991). His weekly radio show, &quot;Mark Naftalin&#x27;s Blues Power Hour&quot; has been on the air almost continuously since 1979 on San Francisco&#x27;s radio KALW-FM.

Naftalin co-founded the Blue Monday Foundation and, in 1988, started his own label, Winner Records, which has issued recordings by artists including Paul Butterfield and Percy Mayfield. He continued to perform, both solo and in an ensemble, in the Bay area and elsewhere, often with longtime associate slide guitarist, Ron Thompson. In the 1970s, he appeared on two albums by Quicksilver Messenger Service.

Naftalin has also recorded with many blues players including John Lee Hooker, Otis Rush, Percy Mayfield, Lowell Fulson, Big Joe Turner, James Cotton, Mike Bloomfield, Jake Walker and Van Morrison, and as a sideman on over 100 albums. He played keyboards on the first Mother Earth album, &quot;Living With the Animals&quot; (1968) and was credited as co-producer and arranger.

Naftalin was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015 as an early member of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band.

==Personal life==
Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, Naftalin is the son of former Minneapolis mayor Arthur Naftalin; he is married to third wife Ellen Naftalin. His son is the San Francisco Bay Area artist David Normal.

<doc id="1202005" wikidata="Q1632708" url="?curid=1202005" title="Sallah Shabati">
<text>Sallah Shabati () is a 1964 Israeli comedy film about the chaos of Israeli immigration and resettlement, as well as the issues Mizrahi Jews faced in the developing Israeli society. This social satire placed the director Ephraim Kishon and producer Menahem Golan among the first Israeli filmmakers to achieve international success. It also introduced to audiences to actor Chaim Topol, who would later achieve even greater recognition with the 1971 American period musical film &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;.

The protagonist&#x27;s name, Sallah Shabati, is perhaps a play on the phrase סליחה שבאתי, &quot;Sliḥa she&#x27;bati&quot;, &quot;I apologise for coming/I regret coming here&quot;. In earlier print versions of Kishon&#x27;s short stories which were revised for the film, the character was known as Saadia Shabtai.

This is the first Israeli film to be nominated for the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film and the first to win the Golden Globe award for best Foreign Film. Later, it was also produced as a musical.

==Plot==
The film begins with Sallah Shabati, a Mizrahi Jewish immigrant, arriving in Israel by plane with his family: his very pregnant wife, an ancient female relative, and seven children. Upon arrival, he is taken to live in a &quot;ma&#x27;abara&quot;, or transit camp, where he and his family are given a broken-down, one-room shack to live in.

The rest of the film follows Sallah&#x27;s many attempts to earn enough money to purchase an apartment in a nearby new housing development. His money-making schemes are often comical and frequently satirize the political and social stereotypes in Israel at the time.

Finally realizing that people are more likely to get what they &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; want, he organizes a demonstration against the housing office, shouting the slogan: &quot;We don&#x27;t want the development: we want the &quot;ma&#x27;abara&quot;!&quot; The film ends with residents being forcibly evicted by police and transported to the new housing complex.

==Cast==
* Topol as Sallah Shabati (as Haym Topol)
* Arik Einstein as Zigi, the kibbutznik boyfriend of Sallah&#x27;s eldest daughter
* Geula Nuni as Habbubah Shabati (as Geula Noni), Sallah&#x27;s daughter
* Gila Almagor as Batsheva Ha&#x27;Sosialit (social worker)
* Albert Cohen 
* Shraga Friedman as Neuman, the kibbutz secretary (administrator)
* Zaharira Harifai as Frieda, a kibbutz supervisor (and the real power)
* Shaike Levi as Shimon Shabati, Sallah&#x27;s son
* Nathan Meisler as Mr. Goldstein, Sallah&#x27;s neighbor and backgammon pal
* Esther Greenberg as Sallah&#x27;s wife
* Mordecai Arnon as Mordecai

==Themes==
&quot;Sallah Shabati&quot;&#x27;s irreverent and mocking depiction of core Zionist institutions like the kibbutz provoked strong reactions among many filmgoers and critics. &quot;The kibbutzniks in the film resemble bureaucrats and are clearly divided into veterans with managing roles and &#x27;simple&#x27; workers, a division which contradicts the myth of Socialist solidarity and collectivist idealism. The kibbutzniks betray total indifference, furthermore, to the miserable conditions of the poor &quot;ma&#x27;abara&quot; next to them.&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;Sallah Shabati&quot; received mixed reviews but achieved unprecedented box office success in Israel, drawing almost 1.3 million spectators.

&quot;New York Times&quot; critic A.H. Weiler called the film &quot;more educational than hilarious&quot;, and said &quot;Sallah Shabbati and his coterie are an unusual, endearing, often colorful lot, but their humor is largely rudimentary.&quot;

It won the Hollywood Foreign Press Association&#x27;s Golden Globe Award as Best Foreign Film, and opened and closed the Berlin Film Festival. The film was nominated for a 1964 Academy Award in the category of Best Foreign Language Film, a first for an Israeli production, but it lost the Oscar to the Italian film, &quot;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&quot;.

The film won best actor (Haim Topol) and best screenplay (Ephraim Kishon) in the 1964 San Francisco International Film Festival.

<text>The Confederate States Congress was both the provisional and permanent legislative assembly / legislature of the Confederate States of America that existed from February 1861 to April / June 1865, during the American Civil War. Its actions were, for the most part, concerned with measures to establish a new national government for the Southern proto-state in the current Southern United States region, and to prosecute a war that had to be sustained throughout the existence of the Confederacy. At first, it met as a provisional congress both in the first capital city of Montgomery, Alabama, and the second in Richmond, Virginia. As was the case for the provisional Congress after it moved northeast to Richmond, the permanent Congress met in the existing Virginia State Capitol, a building which it also shared with the secessionist Virginia General Assembly (state legislature).

The precursor to the permanent Congressional legislature was the temporary Provisional Congress of the Confederate States, which helped establish the Confederacy as a state / nation with an organized government. Following elections held in individual states, refugee colonies, and army camps in November 1861, the 1st Confederate States Congress met in four sessions. The 1863 midterm elections led to many former Democrats losing to former Whigs, the political parties of the recent 1850s in the United States in which they had formerly participated. The 2nd Confederate Congress met in two sessions following an intersession during the military campaign season beginning November 7, 1864, and ending on March 18, 1865, shortly before the conclusion of the Civil War and the downfall of the Confederacy.

All legislative considerations of the Confederate Congress were secondary to winning the American Civil War. These included debates whether to pass President Jefferson Davis&#x27;s war measures and deliberations on alternatives to administration proposals, both of which were often denounced as discordant, regardless of the outcome. Congress was often held in low regard regardless of what it did. Amidst early battlefield victories, few sacrifices were asked of those who resided in the Confederacy, and the Confederate Congress and Davis were in essential agreement.

During the second half of the war, the Davis administration&#x27;s program became more demanding, and the Confederate Congress responded by becoming more assertive in the law-making process even before the 1863 elections. It began to modify administration proposals, substitute its own measures, and sometimes it refused to act at all. While it initiated few major policies, it often concerned itself with details of executive administration. Despite its devotion to Confederate independence, it was criticized by supporters of Davis for occasional independence, and censured in the dissenting press for not asserting itself more often.

==Provisional Congress==

The Confederate Congress first met provisionally on February 4, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama, to form a unified national government among states whose secessionist conventions had resolved to leave their union with the United States. Most Deep South residents and many in the border states believed the new nation about to be born in a revolution to perpetuate slavery was the logical result of defeats in sectional contests.

===Meeting at Montgomery===

The 1859 raid at the federal Harpers Ferry Armory in Harper&#x27;s Ferry, then in Virginia, at the confluence of the Shenandoah with the Potomac River, by abolitionist John Brown to free slaves in Virginia was hailed in the North by other abolitionists, who proclaimed that it was a noble martyrdom, while many in the South saw Brown as a provocateur and dangerous extremist, seeking to incite servile insurrection and violent social upheaval. The North seemed unwilling to accept the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the Dredd Scott case of March 1857, that slaves were not free citizens even if moved to Northern free states or to the western federal territories, and by implication, therefore guaranteeing slavery in the territories, and the Democratic Party had split among Northern and Southern factions over the issue, especially in the controversial disputed 1860 presidential election. Sectional antagonism was magnified with the decline of the national Whig Party and the upsurge of the newly-organized Republican Party in 1854, was insistent on ending the extension of slavery in the western territories, which was seen as a threat to the very existence of continued slavery in the South itself, and of a white Southern civilization.
The increasing economic rivalry and gap of wealth between Northern industry and more mechanized farming versus Southern slave cash-crop agriculture seemed to be a losing battle that would permanently subject the South as diminished colonists dependent on an aggressive business world. Secession was to the state delegates meeting in Montgomery, Alabama, a clear cut solution to over several decades of humiliation, reverses, and defeats. A new nation of secessionist states exclusive to the South, would assure uncompromised slavery and deliver an independent economic security based on the King Cotton agriculture crop.

The November 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln proved to be the deciding catalyst for the Deep South. Southern members of Congress repeatedly addressed their constituents, saying that all hope of sectional relief and redress was done and that &quot;the sole and primary aim of each slaveholding State ought to be its speedy and absolute separation from an unnatural and hostile Union.&quot;

A chain reaction was set off, as the &quot;secessionists&quot;, &quot;straight-outs&quot;, and &quot;States&#x27; rights men&quot; demanded separate state action to withdraw from the United States and immediate regrouping as a Southern union for self defense. Cooperation towards such a new government was being achieved even before the Montgomery Convention, as the Southern states had been exchanging a series of commissioners to determine their joint action since the fall of 1860. On December 31, 1860, the South Carolina Convention issued an invitation to Southern states to form a Southern Confederacy, and, after their next commissioners returned on January 11, 1861, South Carolina invited all slave states in the Union to meet in Montgomery on February 4. Another six states called secession conventions of their own, held statewide elections to select delegates, convened and passed secession ordinances between January 9 and February 1, 1861.

South Carolina set the pattern for electing delegates to the Provisional Congress. Six state conventions elected two delegates at large, and one from each congressional district. Florida allowed its secessionist governor to appoint the state delegation. There was no popular election to the Provisional Congress; vacancies were filled by the secessionist conventions, state legislatures or temporarily by a convention president.

===Membership and politics===
Historian of the Confederate Congress, Wilfred Buck Yearns, held that the most significant feature of the Montgomery gathering was its moderation. The secessionist conventions had not only intended to establish a slaveholding republic of the Lower South, they also hoped to attract the border slaveholding states, and they sought to reconcile their own in-state cooperationists and union men. The result was that the Confederate Provisional Congress began its work in relative harmony.

The state secessionist conventions had generally chosen delegates that truly represented their congressional districts, so the Provisional Congress fairly represented the diversity of the Southern states, excluding, of course, the millions of black people held in bondage throughout the South. Fifty delegates attended the first sessions at Montgomery. A majority of them had served in state secessionist conventions, and, overall in Congress, straight-out secessionists held a three-to-two ratio over the former conditional unionists. Alabama and Mississippi had the only state delegations with majority conditional unionists.

Most of the Provisional Congressional delegates were prominent men of major political parties. The majority of the former Democrats to former Whigs was narrow, with Alabama and Louisiana delegations majority Whig and Georgia evenly divided. Thirty-six members of Congress had attended college, forty-two were licensed lawyers, and seventeen were planters. Their average age was 47, ranging from 72 to 31. Thirty-four had previous legislative experience, twenty-four having served in the U.S. Congress. Charles Conrad had served as Secretary of War under President Millard Fillmore, and John Tyler had been the tenth U.S. president. As Yearns noted, &quot;As a whole the Provisional Congress represented a higher type of leadership than either of the subsequent congresses.&quot;

During the Provisional Congress, the expected political rivalries between secessionist fire-eaters and conservative conditional unionists did not appear, nor did the older factions of former Democrats versus former Whigs. Past politics were reserved for short-hand labeling during election campaigns. The main basis for political division in the Confederate Congress were the issues related to the policies of the President and his administration. In the first year of the Provisional Congress, opposition stemmed from personal and philosophical differences with Jefferson Davis. Davis spoke in states&#x27; rights terms, but his actions were increasingly nationalist from early on, and he freely used his veto power against bills meant to limit national policy in a way that led to charges of &quot;military despotism&quot;.

Some opposition came from personal dislike of Davis; other opponents believed the presidency rightfully belonged to Robert Rhett. Henry S. Foote and Davis had a long running dislike for each other, which had previously lead to physical fight on the floor of the U.S. Congress. Another representative, William Lowndes Yancey, resented Davis for distributing patronage jobs. Even friends of Davis&#x27;s resented his habit of leaving Congress in total ignorance of executive policy and administration. He disliked personal interaction and met members only in state delegations. Generally speaking, Davis showed little interest in compromise, and Congressional legislators returned the favor by holding onto the opinions that got them elected.

Despite some resistance to the Davis administration proposals, because victory seemed imminent, little of the Confederacy was occupied, and any legislation that might require real sacrifice among the citizenry seemed unnecessary. Most Congressional debates were kept secret from the public, measures passed with substantial majorities, and the president&#x27;s messages were encouraging.

===Constitution drafting===

Deputies from the first seven states convening in Montgomery, Alabama, resolved themselves into the Confederate Provisional Congress. Delegations from Alabama, Louisiana, Florida, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina, and Texas met in the Alabama State Capitol in two sessions from February through May 1861. A committee of twelve drafted a proposal from Chairman Christopher G. Memminger from February 5–7. Receiving the committee report the following day, the convention of secession delegates assembled, with one vote cast for each state delegation, unanimously approved the Provisional Constitution of the Confederate States on February 8.

The Provisional Constitution was, as Alexander H. Stephens noted, &quot;the Constitution of the United States with such changes as are necessary to meet the exigencies of the times.&quot; In a pointed effort to incorporate states&#x27; rights principles, the Provisional Confederate Constitution referred to the &quot;Sovereign and Independent States&quot; of the permanent union. The U.S. Constitution&#x27;s &quot;general welfare&quot; was omitted. The Confederate Congress was to be similar to the Continental Congresses, with one chamber representing states, with a quorum of state delegations. Each state could fill Provisional Congressional vacancies as it wished.

Although not mandatory, the President might appoint cabinet members from Congress. In an effort at government economy, the president was authorized to veto individual items from appropriation bills. The Provisional Constitution organized each state into a federal judicial district — this provision was adopted in the permanent Confederate Constitution, but, in the only amendment to either document, this provision was amended to allow Congress to determine federal districts on May 21, 1861. A supreme court was to be constituted by convening all the federal district judges. To continue judicial procedure in the Confederacy as it had been in the United States, judicial power was extended to all cases of law and equity arising under the laws of the United States.

From February 28 until March 11, 1861, the Provisional Congress resolved itself into a Constitutional Convention each day, and, as a convention, it adopted the Permanent Confederate Constitution unanimously. On March 12, Howell Cobb of Georgia, as president of the Constitutional Convention, forwarded it to the state secessionist conventions. Several Congressmen returned to their home states to lobby for adoption, and all conventions ratified without submitting the new Constitution to a referendum by the people.

The permanent Constitution, like the provisional one before it, was primarily modeled on the U.S. Constitution, modified by the Convention&#x27;s desire to write a Southern constitution. The national government was clearly to be only an agent of the states, powers to the central government were &quot;delegated&quot; not &quot;granted&quot;. It provided for a bicameral national legislature consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate. The rights and duties of Congress received the most attention, most importantly related to fiscal matters such as export duties, discouraging internal improvements but for navigational aids, and the self-sustaining post office.

To limit log-rolling, a two-thirds vote in each house was required for appropriations bills not recommended by an executive department, and the president had line-item-veto power. In Article III, radical states&#x27; righters struck the provisional Constitution&#x27;s provision extending federal jurisdiction over cases between citizens of different states. Additionally, federal judicial power no longer applied to all cases of law and equity to accommodate the Roman law concept of single jurisdiction in Louisiana and Texas.

Congressional apportionment remained on the U.S. federal ratio, with three-fifths of the slave population counted for representation, over the objections of the South Carolina secessionist convention. Returning escaped slaves was removed from the discretion of state governors in the provisional Constitution and made the responsibility of the Confederate government.

The permanent Confederate Constitution served for the duration of the government, with only one Amendment on May 21, 1861, when Congress was given the right to draw multiple federal judicial districts in the large states. The reservations of the South Carolina secession convention ratification were never taken up by any other state legislatures.

===Functioning national government===

Sitting as the Provisional Congress, the gathering elected Jefferson Davis President of the Confederate States of America on February 9, the day after the Provisional Constitution had been adopted and five days after initially convening in Montgomery. On February 21, a week before it sat as a Constitutional Convention, the Provisional Congress established the several executive departments, virtually mirroring those of the U.S. Government. The only major exception was the Confederate Post Office, which was required to be financially self-sustaining. On March 4, 1861, the Confederacy adopted its first flag, which was used throughout the Confederacy on the battlefield and at government office buildings for the duration of the Civil War.

Following the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter in April 1861, the remaining six states admitted to the Confederate States of America with representation in its Congresses met in three additional sessions between July 1861 and February 1862 in the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond, Virginia. The Virginia secessionist convention was already in session, and, after Lincoln&#x27;s call-up of 75,000 troops to secure federal property, on April 17 that convention voted 88 to 55 to secede. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas soon after called secessionist conventions that voted to leave the Union by overwhelming majorities. On May 6, 1861, the Confederate Congress officially declared war on the United States and authorized the President to use all land and naval forces in pursuit of the war that had commenced.

Arizona secessionists met in convention at La Mesilla and resolved to leave the Union on March 16, and duly sent a delegate to Montgomery to lobby for admission. On January 18, 1862, Congress seated Granville H. Oury as a non-voting delegate. The Southwest Indians were initially sympathetic to the Confederate cause, as many were slaveholders. During the spring and summer of 1861, Choctaws, Chickasaws, Seminoles, Creeks, and Cherokees held tribal conventions that resolved themselves into independent nations and began negotiations with the Provisional Congress. Commissioner of Indian Affairs Albert Pike made three kinds of treaties. The Five Civilized Tribes were allowed a non-voting delegate in Congress and the Confederacy assumed all debts owed to the United States Government. They, in turn, promised mounted volunteer companies. Agricultural tribes of Osages, Senecas, Shawnees, and Quapaws received clothes and industrial aids in return for military assistance. The Comanches and ten other tribes promised non-aggression in return for rations from the Confederate Government.

===Mobilization===
In the campaign leading up to state conventions, secessionist leaders had assured the Southern people that severing ties with the United States would be an uncontested event. As a precautionary measure, on February 28, the Provisional Congress authorized Davis to take control of all military operations among the states in the Confederacy, and on March 6 it authorized raising 100,000 troops for Confederate national forces for a year, with additional levies of state militias for six months.

Following the assault on Fort Sumter in April, Lincoln responded with a call for 75,000 troops among loyal states to restore federal property ceded by Southern state legislatures to the United States. The Provisional Congress answered by removing its limit on enlistment durations, and, following the victory at First Manassas, it authorized a Confederate army of 400,000 for the duration. Davis was authorized an additional 400,000 of state militia troops for service of one to three years.

On May 6, 1861, Congress authorized presidential issue of letters of marque and reprisal against vessels of the United States. Ship owners were eligible for eighty-five percent of everything seized. Subsequent legislation provided for a bonus of $20 for each person aboard a captured or destroyed vessel, and twenty percent of the value of each enemy warship sunk or destroyed. The tightening Union blockade made the privateers less effective, as they could not return prizes to Southern ports for disposition.

Early volunteer law enabled the president to accept seamen from the state navies, but few enlisted in Confederate service. In December 1861, Congress authorized an enlistment bonus of $50 in the attempt to raise 2,000 sailors for the duration, but the quota was not met. The draft law of April 16, 1862, in the First Session of the First Congress allowed conscripts to choose their branch of service. Navy enlistment was so small that state courts later recruited sailors by sentencing criminals to serve in the Navy.

===Meeting at Richmond===
On May 23, the Virginia Secession Convention voted to secede, and, shortly thereafter, the Virginia legislature invited the Confederate Congress to move to Richmond. After the state&#x27;s voters overwhelmingly ratified the secession decisions a month later, the Congress ordered the next session to convene in Richmond on July 20.

Because Davis believed the Confederacy should embrace Kentucky and Missouri, the Provisional Congress appropriated $1 million each in late August to secure secession in those states.

The Provisional Congress in the Fifth Session reached two of the most far-reaching decisions for the Confederacy, both politically and militarily. The border states of Missouri and Kentucky were admitted into the Confederate States of America, requiring offensive military decisions otherwise uncalled for in the western theater, including violating Kentucky&#x27;s neutrality. Their admission also provided a solid two-state delegation support amounting to 17% of the House and 15% of the Senate backing the Davis administration throughout the existence of the Confederacy. Treaties with the Five Civilized Tribes also allowed for their seating non-voting representatives in the Confederate Congress, as did the Arizona Territory. With the short-lived claim to the far-western Arizona Territory, by the end of 1861, the Confederacy had gained the greatest extent of its territorial expansion. After that point, its &quot;de facto&quot; governance contracted as Union military actions prevailed.

While the initial response to calls to rally to the Confederate Army and state militias was overwhelming in the short run, Davis foresaw that substantial numbers of the twelve-month volunteers would not re-enlist. Fully half of the entire Confederate Army might vanish in the spring of 1862. In an effort to extend volunteer service, on December 11, 1861, Congress provided for a $50 reenlistment bounty and a 60-day furlough for an enlistment of three years or the duration. The measure destabilized the entire Provisional Army, resulting in the ousting of large numbers of serving officers in company and regimental election campaigns. Railroad transportation was snarled with the glut of furloughed soldiers coming and going.

In the last of its actions, the Provisional Congress instructed the states in several duties. These included redrawing congressional districts to conform to the Confederate apportionment, reenacting election laws conforming to Confederate timetables, permitting out-of-state voting by soldiers and refugees, and electing two Confederate Congress senators to meet at the permanent Congress called on February 18, 1862. The Confederate Congresses and the Davis administration were the only two national civilian administrative bodies for the Confederacy.

The Confederate constitution contained a provision (Article I, Section 8, Clause 17), essentially duplicated from the United States Constitution, for the establishment of a federal district of up to one hundred square miles. It was widely assumed in the Confederacy that this district would be sited somewhere other than an existing state capital after the war was won, similar to how Washington, D.C., was founded, or even more optimistically that the Confederate seat of government might eventually be moved to Washington itself, provided that Maryland, a slave state with considerable pro-Confederate sympathies, were to come under Confederate control. Since none of this ever occurred, the permanent Confederate Congress continued to meet in Richmond until its dissolution.

==First Congress==
Elections for the First Confederate States Congress were held on November 6, 1861. While Congressional elections in the United States were held in even-numbered years, elections for Confederate Congressmen occurred in odd-numbered years. The First Congress met in four sessions in Richmond.

In the 105 House seats and 26 Senate seats, altogether 267 men served in the Confederate Congress. About a third had served in the U.S. Congress, and others had prior experience in their state legislatures. Only twenty-seven served continuously, including House Speaker Thomas S. Bocock and Senate President pro tempore Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia, William Waters Boyce and William Porcher Miles of South Carolina, Benjamin Harvey Hill of Georgia, and Louis Wigfall of Texas. There was a rapid turnover in Congressional membership, in part due to some securing an officer&#x27;s commission for military service. The mercurial Vice President, Alexander H. Stephens, soon withdrew to his home state of Georgia, and Senator Hunter served as an acting Vice President and then later briefly as Secretary of State for the Davis administration. Throughout the existence of the Confederate Congress, its sessions were held in secrecy. Both U.S Continental and Confederation Congresses had been held in secret, and the U.S. Congress did not open its galleries to newspaper reporters until 1800. Nevertheless, by summer 1862, newspapers such as the &quot;Daily Richmond Examiner&quot; began objecting to the closed sessions.

===First general elections===
On May 21, 1861, the Provisional Congress ordered elections for the First Congress under the Permanent Constitution to be held on the first Wednesday in November. Election campaigning for the First Congress went quietly, with newspapers announcing the election and gently observing that the tickets offered good and true men. Despite some few purely local contests, the outcome of these first Confederate congressional elections depended chiefly on the connections of friendships formed during earlier politics. Secessionists and unionists, Democrats and Whigs, had all previously had networks, and even without partisan labels, they all were practical men who used their previous contacts to get out the vote.

While newspapers observed prior party affiliations, there were no issues, no visible organization, no interstate affiliations, and nothing other than unswerving devotion to Southern principles and Confederate independence reported. While the &quot;straight-out&quot; secessionists tried to make early support of disunion a test of loyalty, most men continued to vote for about the same candidates who they used to do.

The Permanent Constitution required that the state legislatures elect senators to the Confederate Congress, and there was virtually no political campaigning. The usual state practice while sending senators to the U.S. Congress was to divide the senate seats between two major geographical divisions in each state, and the practice continued. In states where the Democratic and Whig votes had been closely matched in the 1860 elections, the state legislatures also filled the seats with a former Democrat and a former Whig. Usually legislatures sent their best men to the Confederate Senate, for instance Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia left his post as Confederate Secretary of State, and William Lowndes Yancey of Alabama left his post at Confederate Commissioner to England to be senators.

The first general election held in the Confederacy went quietly. In mostly Union-controlled Missouri and Kentucky, where the secessionist governments were in flight out of state, secessionist governors appointed senators, and elections for representatives were held by soldier and refugee ballot. The results returned most of the provisional delegates who sought election as congressmen, and those who did not run were replaced by men of similar background. About a third of those elected would become administration opponents in a loyal opposition, but that would develop in Congress only after more assertive administration policies in the conduct of the war.

===First Session of the First Congress===
The first session of the First Congress sat from February 18 to April 21, 1862, a total of 63 days. During this time, the states of Missouri, Kentucky and northwest Virginia were occupied by Union forces and used as staging areas for further advances into Confederate territory. After the Battle of Shiloh, Union forces moved into the Tennessee Valley reaching into Alabama. Amphibious operations by the Union saw gains along the Atlantic Coast furthering the Union blockade at Fernandia and St. Augustine, Florida, New Berne, North Carolina, and Fort Pulaski at Savannah, Georgia.

The elections of November 1861 gave every indication that the political accommodation between president and Congress would continue. The Battle of First Manassas and General Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s Valley campaign bolstered confidence in the administration, and no major disasters had occurred. But during the spring of 1862 the pace of war quickened, and Union operations began in the West and along the coasts, resulting in Confederate territorial losses. It became evident that legislation could not be equitably applied in the lost territory and among the occupied population, and that additional burdens would fall on fewer Confederates.

While administration support was strongest in the First Session of the First Congress, strategic efforts at counterattacks into Kentucky and Maryland failed, and a war of attrition developed, leading many to criticize the administration for its war policy. Senator Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia was an early supporter of Jefferson Davis&#x27;s who turned severe critic, enough so that Lincoln recommended not arresting Hunter after the surrender at Appomattox. On the other hand, members representing districts already overrun and those actively contested by Union advances became stalwart administration supporters, advancing more aggressive measures. These assured Davis a solid Congressional base in the middle of the war, numbering 11 of the 28 senators, and 27 of the 122 Representatives.

====Mobilization====
After awaiting formal initiative from the Confederate Congress since December 1861 for the first national draft on the North American continent, Davis finally proposed military conscription of all men between 18 and 35 without deferring to the states for a policy unauthorized in the Confederate Constitution. The conscription bill was staffed by Robert E. Lee, and the draft was then forwarded to Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin. It was introduced into the Senate by Louis T. Wigfall of Texas, a fire-eating secessionist and one of the few states&#x27; rights leaders to support conscription.

Enacted on April 16, the statute empowered the president to conscript directly, for three years or the duration, all men between ages 18 and 35 not exempted by law, and all of those enrolled in service would continue to serve for three years from the date of their enlistment. Thousands of additional volunteers in 1862 and 1863 enlisted to avoid the odium of being labeled a &quot;conscript&quot;. Lee was able to use the reinforced army of trained recruits to defeat General George B. McClellan in the Seven Days Battles immediately before Richmond June 25 – July 1, when the army otherwise might have been halved by lapsing enlistments.

Generally, the volunteers in the army supported conscription; further, while most of the Southern press endorsed the measure, a strong minority opposed the idea. On April 14, Senator William Lowndes Yancey, a fire-eater of Alabama 1862–1863, proposed exemptions from the Confederate draft. It was termed &quot;over generous&quot; by one scholar, in a system of &quot;class exemptions&quot; related to the physically unfit, the politically connected, several service-related categories such as preachers, teachers and social workers, textile workers and a few other economic categories. It was passed at the end of the First Session of the First Congress.

After an earlier failed effort, Representative John Jones McRae of Alabama successfully secured legislation to establish a &quot;Volunteer Navy&quot;, more like privateering and less like the regular navy. While formally a part of Confederate forces, they were to operate within &quot;the ebb and flow of the tide&quot;.

Turning to strategic considerations of war policy, Representative William Smith of Virginia, former governor and future Confederate general and Virginia governor, proposed a band of &quot;partisan rangers&quot; to operate within enemy lines, and to be paid a bonus of $5 in addition to regular army pay for each enemy killed, as a way of raising men otherwise exempt. A substitute measure was passed in April that authorized Davis to commission officers to raise partisan bands. The experiment was a failure, as rangers tended to spend their time attacking Confederate civilians. By the end of 1863, Lee was recommending that the law be repealed.

Following the recommendation of Davis on March 28, Congress enacted its Conscription Act on April 16, the first military draft on the North American continent. It required three years&#x27; military service of all white males from ages eighteen to thirty-five. Substitutes were allowed. All volunteers, a majority of the army, had their terms of service extended, although they were granted a sixty-day furlough and the privilege of electing their own company-grade officers, captain and below. In addition to its &quot;class-exemption system&quot; deferring school teachers, river pilots, and iron foundry workers, Congress in October 1862 exempted owners or overseers of twenty or more slaves. Public opposition exploded, objecting to a system making the war a &quot;rich man&#x27;s war&quot; and a &quot;poor man&#x27;s fight&quot;. Conscription Bureau officers often acted like kidnappers or press gangs as they enforced the draft. Southern men began volunteering for military service to avoid the stigma of being labelled a conscript. Many entered state militias, where they would be restricted to service within their states, as in Georgia. Nevertheless, the Confederacy managed to mobilize practically the entire Southern military population, generally amounting to over a third of the manpower available to the Union until 1865.

In February 1862, a group of Georgia congressmen, led by the Cobb brothers and Robert Augustus Toombs, a former Confederate Secretary of State, called for a &quot;scorched earth policy&quot; before advancing Union troops, stating that the Confederacy should &quot;Let every woman have a torch, every child a firebrand&quot; in order to deprive Union troops of resources. On retiring from a city or town, the group stated that the Confederacy should &quot;let a desert more terrible than the Sahara welcome the Vandals.&quot; It became popular to believe that the loss and self-destruction of a city would make little difference in the ultimate outcome of the war; the vast size of the Confederacy would make its conquest impossible.

Thus, by the spring of 1862, it was obvious that, if the Confederacy were to survive, Southerners were of necessity changing their ante-bellum worldview, including constitutional principles, economic markets, and political axioms. Davis referred to the Confederacy&#x27;s &quot;darkest hour&quot;, and, with the consent of Congress, reconstituted his cabinet on March 19. Thomas H. Watts, an Alabama Whig, became the Attorney General, and, without a Confederate Supreme Court, he became the &quot;de facto&quot; final arbiter of legal questions involving the national government. Congress had authorized the president to suspend the writ of habeas corpus and to declare martial law in any city, town, or military district at his personal discretion as of February 27, and by March both Norfolk and Richmond were under martial law.

===Second Session of the First Congress===
The Second Session of the First Congress met from August 18 to October 13, 1862. During this period, Union river operations had continued success, capturing Memphis, Tennessee, and Helena, Arkansas. Along the Atlantic Coast, the Union captured Fort Macon-Beaufort, Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, and Norfolk, Virginia. The most strategic breakthrough for the Union was the capture of New Orleans and surrounding territory in Louisiana. By summer 1862, every Southern state had some Union occupation.

====Mobilization====
Congress continued to address manpower and mobilization needs in the Second Session of the First Congress. Given war displacement of border state men into the Deep South, and the practice of draft evaders relocating to avoid conscription in their old home counties, on October 8 Congress authorized the Bureau of Conscription to enroll eligible men into army service wherever they might be found. To meet local defense needs, Congress permitted men over age 45 and those otherwise exempt to form local defense units and to be incorporated into the regular army. Without a guarantee for prohibiting service outside of their home state, few enrolled. Although a proposal to draft resident foreigners was considered, the Congress had no desire to form immigrant units en masse as the Union did, and foreigners were exempted.

By September 2, during the Second Session of the First Congress, a strong group of states&#x27; righters in Congress tried to remove conscription from presidential authority and to place it in the hands of the states. Representative Henry S. Foote of Tennessee, a former Unionist who had defeated Davis for Governor of Mississippi, insisted in the Confederate House on state control of conscription, and warned that the Davis bill would lead to a Confederate civil war. When Davis responded with a successful measure to increase conscription to the ages of 16 to 45, these same members sought to limit his authority to raising 300,000 troops a year. The anti-Davis-conscription caucus failed on both counts.

In an effort to curb abuses, known refuges for draft-dodgers were eliminated for newly minted teachers, tanners, and preachers by exempting only those who had been practitioners for two or more years. The question of exempting overseers was controversial, as planters had classified their sons for the occupational exemption. Border-state senators, who generally were staunch allies of Davis&#x27;s, aligned with non-planting elements of the Confederate House to restrict the plantation exemption to one white man at all times. Generally, skilled artisans, laborers in essential occupations and public utilities, and managerial government personnel were exempted. By the end of the Second Session in the fall of 1862, Congress believed that it had established military and home-front manpower coordination for the duration.

===Third Session of the First Congress===
The Third Session of the First Congress ran from January 12 until May 1, 1863. The battles of Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville stymied Union attempts to advance in the eastern theater, but it achieved victories along the Mississippi at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Fort Hindeman, Arkansas. In 1863, Lee&#x27;s Confederate strike into Pennsylvania was turned back at Gettysburg, and General Kirby Smith&#x27;s invasion of Kentucky was ended at Perryville.

====Mobilization====
At the opening of the Third Session of the First Congress on December 7, 1862, opposition to the substitution provision of the April 16 conscription act was substantial. The cost of substitutes had been brokered from $100 initially up to as much as $5,000 per enlistee. Many objected to the provision as &quot;class legislation&quot;. The substitutes themselves were generally unsatisfactory soldiers, over 40 years of age and from undisciplined backgrounds. Some substitutes &quot;bounty jumped&quot;, deserting only to collect another substitute bonus. Within the army the remaining substitutes were mostly unpatriotic, shiftless, and held in contempt.

At the extension of the draft to men between ages 35 and 45 in the previous session, those who had been substitutes subsequently were found in most state courts to be liable to service in their own name, nullifying the earlier enlistment substitution without violation of contract; some state courts did not. A Senate bill to nationalize substitution policy failed in the House, perhaps due to upcoming elections in November.

Secretary of War James Seddon reported that over 10,000 men not in the army held fraudulent substitute papers to avoid conscription. The bill passed in December prohibited any further use of substitutes, and, in January, draft evaders with fraudulent substitute papers were subject to conscription and their substitute would be required to remain in service. State courts upheld both laws. While the army was not materially augmented, an important cause of dissatisfaction in the ranks was removed.

In the conscription law as initially passed, there was an exemption for an owner or overseer of twenty or more slaves. Most newspapers subsequently condemned the provision as the worst sort of class legislation. The state legislatures of North Carolina, Louisiana, and Texas petitioned Congress to repeal or amend the provision. On January 12, 1863, Davis advised Congress that some amendment was required allowing for policing the slave population without preferential treatment for the slave-owning class. Congress debated and negotiated an adjustment to the law from January until May. It finally agreed to exempt only overseers so employed before April 16, 1862. In the administration of plantation overseer exemptions, the War Department moved cautiously, granting temporary exemptions to those engaged in food production. The critique of the Davis administration waging a &quot;rich man&#x27;s war and a poor man&#x27;s fight&quot; persisted, objected by the poor as being discriminatory and by the upcountry on sectional grounds.

In March, Postmaster John H. Reagan proposed, with the support of Davis, that the 1,509 men of the postal service should be exempted from the draft. Congress immediately exempted most contractors and their drivers. On April 2, those elected to Congress, state legislatures, and several other state posts were exempted.

Following the Battle of Antietam, where Lee failed to gain additional Marylander recruits, Representative George G. Vest of Missouri brought to the attention of Congress, in January 1863, that there were some 2,000 Marylanders vocally supporting the Confederacy in the environs of Richmond, displaced as were numerous citizens of Missouri, and that the Marylanders should also be subject to conscription laws. Both House and Senate passed enabling legislation, but Davis pocket-vetoed the measure at the close of session in May for fear of alienating a state that was virtually neutral in the conflict.

The Confederate Congress never developed a coherent anti-administration party, but, in 1863, facing re-election amidst growing dissatisfaction with the Davis administration, it did refuse to extend Davis&#x27;s authority to suspend habeas corpus nationally as an emergency power. Nevertheless, state courts in the Confederacy substantially upheld the prerogatives asserted by the Davis government. Likewise, Congress did not enact a bill allowing commanding generals to appoint their own staffs, allowing Davis to place his personal stamp on every chain of command. Historian Emery Thomas has noted that, in the name of wartime emergency, Davis &quot;all but destroyed the political philosophy which underlay the founding of the Southern Republic,&quot; and Congress furthered his purposes.

Extending the earlier conscription of whites into the Confederate Army, Congress now allowed impressment of slaves as military laborers. Army quartermaster and commissary officers were authorized to seize private property for army use, compensated at below-market prices with depreciated currency. Not only did the Confederate States Congress anticipate the United States initiating a draft to conscript a mass army, it began a graduated income tax, both monetary and in-kind, fifty years before the U.S. government did. The graduated income tax spanned from one percent for monetary incomes under $500 to 15 percent for those over $1,500; in addition, a 10-percent tax was levied on all profit from sale of foodstuffs, clothing and iron, and all agriculture and livestock were taxed at 10 percent of everything grown or slaughtered. Congress authorized $500 million in bonds in an effort to stem inflation. But, in a wartime economy, inflation went from 300 percent for a gold dollar to 2,000 percent from January 1863 to January 1864, an inflation rate of over 600 percent in one year. The inflation rate discouraged investment in bonds, and only $21 million was retired from circulation.

===Fourth Session of the First Congress===
Following an intersession during the military campaign season, the Fourth Session of the First Congress met from December 7, 1863, to February 17, 1864. The Union achieved control of the Mississippi River with the fall of Vicksburg, the capture of Fort Hudson, Louisiana, along with victories at Fort Smith and Little Rock, Arkansas. Union advances in eastern Tennessee were signaled by the fall of Knoxville and Chattanooga. At the end of the First Confederate Congress, it controlled just over a half of its congressional districts, while Federals occupied two-fifths and almost one-tenth were disrupted by military conflict.

Davis had urged immediate measures to increase the Confederacy&#x27;s effective manpower as Congress reconvened on December 7, but it did not act until its adjournment on February 17, 1864. It expanded the draft ages from 18-40 to 17-50. It substantially cut exemption classifications, and authorized the use of free blacks and slaves as cooks, teamsters, laborers, and nurses.

By the close of the First Congress, the army had about 500,000 men enrolled, but only half of them were present for duty. The other 250,000 were lost to shirking, disloyalty, and poor policing of deserters. There was widespread abuse of the system of class exemptions, including teachers, apothecaries, newly minted artisans with scant business, and small state government employees hired at less than subsistence wages. For a price, doctors diagnosed &quot;rheumatism&quot; and &quot;low back&quot; pain. The net result by June 1864 was a present-for-duty strength in all Confederate armies totaling not more than 200,000, about 100,000 fewer than the year before.

While every state supreme court had upheld conscription by 1863, litigious draftees would challenge the Bureau of Conscription and so delay their enlistment in state courts for months. State governors resisted conscription of their citizens between ages 35 and 45 by enlisting them in state forces, then refusing to transfer them to the Confederacy for even temporary service.

Congress reauthorized the suspension of habeas corpus at Davis&#x27;s discretion. It extended the tax law of 1863, and, although there was some relief from the earlier double taxation of agricultural products, it generally required greater material sacrifice for the war effort. A Compulsory Funding Measure sought to curb inflation, but failed to do so. Finally, the Congress authorized requiring half of all cargo space aboard ships running the blockade to be dedicated to government shipments, and forbade any export of cotton or tobacco without Davis&#x27;s express permission.

==Second Congress==
The Second Congress served only one year of its two-year term due to the defeat of the Confederacy in 1865. Although the Confederate States did not establish political parties, the Congress was still dominated by Democrat politicians. However, the low electoral turnout threw out many secessionist and pro-Davis incumbents in favor of former Whigs: The number of anti-Davis members in the House increased from twenty-six of 106 in the First Congress to forty-one in the Second Congress. This weakened the administration&#x27;s ability to get its policies through Congress; nevertheless the Davis administration maintained control of the government.

The Confederate States Congress was sometimes unruly. The journal clerk shot and killed the chief clerk, and Henry S. Foote was attacked with &quot;fists, a Bowie knife, a revolver and an umbrella&quot;. In a Senate debate, Benjamin H. Hill threw an inkstand at William Lowndes Yancey, and Yancey and Edward A. Pollard had such fierce attacks on one another that newspapers would not publish the exchange for fears of their personal safety. Military glory could be had on the battlefield, but Congress and congressmen were held in contempt, in some part due to the members&#x27; habit of berating one another in personal terms. Nevertheless, one historian of the Confederacy assessed the Congress as &quot;better than its critics made it.&quot; The Confederacy lived out its existence during wartime, and virtually all of congressional action addressed that fact. While it took an interest in military affairs, it never followed the U.S. Congress&#x27;s example of harassing either the President, his cabinet, or military commanders. Despite Davis&#x27;s bitter Congressional critics, he dominated the Congress throughout most of the war until near the very end. Davis vetoed thirty-nine bills in total, deemed unconstitutional or unwise, and these were upheld in the Congress for all but the bill for free postage for newspapers addressed to soldiers.

The election of 1863 to seat the Second Confederate Congress hinged on a referendum on the administration&#x27;s war program. Among the 40% of the total elected membership who ran on opposition, there was little reservation about expressing their reservations about various administration proposals. The five unoccupied states where most of the opposition were drawn had 59 districts in the House (56%). Oppositionists obtained 36 members, with 61% of those districts in opposition. These elections were held among resident voters rather than in army camps by state regiment.

However, Davis was practically invulnerable to personal criticism (although individual cabinet members or generals came under Congressional attack from time to time). All things considered, the Confederate government ran more smoothly than that of the United States, where Lincoln faced congressional committees of inquiry. Davis did have influence over the Confederate Congress, primarily from agreement based on ideology, but, without party discipline in Congress, Davis was frustrated in his execution of proposed policy by lengthy deliberations, amendments, and the occasional rejection.

The administration was fundamentally sustained by support from the Congress for three principal reasons. First, Congressional membership universally wanted to win the war. Its members deferred to Davis&#x27;s suggestions whenever they could out of patriotism. When they did not, they were unobtrusive in their opposition. Opposition strategy was focused on modifying proposals rather than rejecting them out of hand. Second, the opposition lacked a consistent membership. Most administration opponents backed several elements of the Davis war program, and that program itself changed, along with public reaction to it. There was no consistent pressure from the electorate to oppose Davis, and no organizational loyalty to a formal opposition caucus. Third, as the Second Congress began, six states were largely in enemy hands. The administration received its main support from them: Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee. These states had 47 districts in the House (44%), and they had only 5 (10%) opponents of the administration.

During the Second Congress, the administration was defeated on four major issues. First, Davis wanted complete control over conscription exemptions to determine who would work and who would fight. Congress sustained class exemptions of the 1862 legislation, however modified. Second, the financial proposals set forth by the Treasury Department were repeatedly disregarded. Third, in 1865, Congress refused to reauthorize suspending the writ of habeas corpus. Fourth, Congress delayed presidential authority to arm slaves for military duty until March 16, 1865.

===Second general election===
The elections for the Second Confederate Congress took place at the time of the regular state and local elections held in each state. As a result, their dates ranged from May 1863 to May 1864. Only Virginia&#x27;s on May 28, 1863, was held before the reverses at Vicksburg and Gettysburg, and Virginia&#x27;s delegation had a turnover of forty percent. The war was going badly not only for Virginia, but for the South generally during the other elections, and citizens were adversely affected by conscription, taxes, food supply, and the economy generally. Unlike elections to the First Congress, which often were personality contests over who showed the most enthusiastic support of secession, Congressmen facing re-election had roll-call voting records that they had to defend. In Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Arkansas, the state delegations saw a turnover of half or more.

The major campaign issue was the Davis administration and the conduct of the war. Central government policies had become specific and expansive to meet growing war needs compared to two years previously. The everyday life of every class and group were affected. Objections did not mean an abandonment of the Confederacy, but rather that war weariness had fomented dissension in the public discussion. Even in 1863, the pre-war party organizations continued to be influential. In the face of repeated Confederate military reverses, the early secessionists maintained that only &quot;true&quot; men could legislate in times of peril. Unlike the quiet campaigns of two years earlier, the campaigns of 1863 were marked by angry political acrimony.

Generally candidates running on an anti-administration platform focused on one or two particularly unpopular issues in their local districts, without offering any alternative, although all appealed to states&#x27; rights, and most made direct appeals to the soldier vote with promises of pay increases or better rations, tobacco allotments, and homesteads in the territories. Peace proponents sought independence but wanted negotiations to begin before the end of hostilities. They were important in half the districts of North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. Conscription and exemption laws were leading political issues all along the eastern seaboard and in Mississippi. Taxation, impressment of produce, and in-kind taxation were widely seen as confiscatory. This was especially important in Virginia. Elsewhere, the poor objected to regressive schedules and the rich called for the government to purchase entire crops of cotton. Administration suspension of habeas corpus to corral able-bodied men dodging military service was especially offensive in North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.

The results overall did not result in a no-confidence majority against the administration. Former Democrats still outnumbered former Whigs 55–45 percent, but war weariness had taken its toll among the civilian population. The delegations from North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia were the most antagonistic to the Davis administration, and Alabama, Florida, and Texas only slightly less so. The Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee delegations were largely elected by soldier vote, and so were solidly pro-administration, as were the congressmen nominally elected to represent districts encompassing the Union-occupied regions of Virginia—these were mostly in West Virginia, since its admission to the Union as a separate state was never recognized by the Confederacy. At the time of elections in each state, just over forty percent of the Congressional Districts were occupied or disrupted by Union forces, yet the fragmentary Congressional results from army and refugee camps were accepted as representative of the majority of residents in each state, a practice that one historian has called delusional. As historian Wilfred B. Yearns concluded, &quot;Only the nearly solid support from occupied districts enabled President Davis to maintain a majority in Congress until the last days of the nation.&quot;

===Second Congress, First Session===
After a two-and-a-half month intersession from the end of the First Congress, the First Session of the Second Confederate Congress sat from May 2 until June 14, 1864. During this period, General William T. Sherman began his March to the Sea, and General Ulysses S. Grant advanced to the outskirts of Richmond at Cold Harbor, Virginia. Confederate forces fell back into defensive positions.

====Mobilization====
In his message to Congress on December 7, 1863, Davis insisted that Congress must &quot;add largely to our effective forces as promptly as possible.&quot; He proposed adding older men aged 45–60 to the draft to replace able-bodied men performing inactive duties. Seddon proposed that Congress organize non-conscripts in every state to hunt down deserters and to assist local enrolling officers.

The first draft law had compelled a three-year term of service for volunteers whose enlistment was about to expire. Seddon now proposed extending their service for the duration, as 315 regiments and 58 battalions were eligible for discharge in 1864. Lee had earlier proposed the end of all class exemptions, and General William J. Hardee along with twenty other generals had publicly proposed that all men should be eligible for service, both black and white, from the ages of 15 to 60.

From December to February, Congress considered bills and reported out a measure that passed both houses on February 17, 1864. It provided for conscription for the duration of white men from ages 17 to 50. Those between 18 and 45 years of age would be retained in their field organizations. Those aged 17–18 and 45–50 would constitute a reserve corps for detail duty, subject to military duty in their home states. Exemptions in government were limited to those certified as necessary. Plantation overseers were exempted only if provisions were provided at set impressment prices; other enumerated occupations were exempted only if they had been engaged for a number of years. Postal workers and railroad employees were exempted, as well as those the president was authorized to detail.

Following complaints of Confederate civilian depredations by independent Confederate ranger units, Lee&#x27;s flat recommendation to terminate them, and General Jeb Stuart&#x27;s assessment that they were inefficient and detrimental to the best interests of the army, Congress reconsidered the &quot;partisan ranger&quot; innovation of April 1862. On February 17, 1864, Congress absorbed the existing Confederate bands of rangers into the regular army, although permitting the Secretary of the Army to use regular troops in a ranger capacity within enemy lines.

At the same time, Congress again suspended the writ of habeas corpus from February 15 to August 1, 1864. It was seen as the most effective way to enforce conscription, maintain Confederate Army coherence, and arrest potential traitors and spies.

===Second Congress, Second Session===
Following an intersession from June 15 to November 6, 1864, the Second Session of the Second Congress sat from November 7, 1864, to March 18, 1865. This period saw the military collapse of the Confederacy, as Sherman turned northward in his Carolinas campaign, and both Fort Fisher and Charleston, South Carolina, were captured. Union advances in the Valley of Virginia forced a collapse of Confederate forces onto Richmond. At the end of the Civil War, 45 percent of Confederate congressional districts were occupied, 20 percent were disrupted by military conflict, and only 33.9 percent were under Confederate control in three geographical pockets in Appalachia, the Lower South, and the Trans-Mississippi West.

====Mobilization====
By the convening of the Second Session of the Second Congress, the inadequacy of all previous military laws had been made apparent through the summer of 1864 during Grant&#x27;s Wilderness campaign and the Siege of Petersburg, Sherman&#x27;s Atlanta campaign, and Sheridan&#x27;s Valley campaigns of 1864.

While the emergency was agreed to on all sides, Congress was still undecided as to how much authority it should grant Davis. There were still 125,000 men on the exemption lists. With support from Seddon, John T.L. Preston, the Superintendent of Conscription, and Lee, Davis recommended to Congress that the entire exemption system be replaced by a regime of executive detail, allowing him to decide who would work and who would fight.

Although a few in each house of Congress supported the Davis exemption proposal, radical states&#x27; righters sought to restore the exemptions of the 1863 level. The largest group in both houses sought to make some small concessions to the looming manpower emergency. They chose to focus on tightening the administration of the draft, including abolishing exemptions for postal workers, railroad men, and overseers, and abolishing all provost marshals not connected to the army. All such proposals died in committee, and the passed legislation to replace existing commissary officers and quartermasters with bonded agents was vetoed as &quot;seriously impairing our ability to supply armies in the field&quot;.

At the opening of the last session of the Confederate Congress, the conscription law of February 17, 1864, effectively had reorganized the state militias with men outside the draft ages. Thus reconstituted, state governors had lent these troops to district commanders through the campaign season of 1864 only as the Union offensives encroached upon their state boundaries. The resulting limitations on training and experience made them of little value in combat. On November 7, 1864, Davis responded to that battlefield experience with the request for a law empowering him to organize, arm, and train all state militias for central government deployment. Congress was reluctant to subject state militias to central government direction. A bill passed in the House was never acted on by the Senate.

In a related consideration about the thousands exempted in state government service, on November 10, Representative Waller R. Staples of Virginia was able to secure a report from the Superintendent of Conscription over the objections of Representative James T. Leach of North Carolina, who protested the questioning of any state&#x27;s loyalty. The report identified only North Carolina and Georgia as harboring &quot;excessive exemptions&quot; among their state agencies. Both houses of Congress dropped the investigation.

A bill concerning the exemption system reported out of conference committee did become law on March 16, 1865, but Davis accepted the law as passed reluctantly. It did not allow him the power to detail all southern men for emergency defense. In a final effort to increase manpower by tinkering with exemptions, Congress abolished the Bureau of Conscription, replacing it with one administered by the army, netting some 3,000 employees.

Although the subject of impressing slaves as soldiers as well as laborers had been considered and rejected in the Confederate press throughout 1864, by September 6, Seddon wrote privately to Louisiana Governor Henry W. Allen that every able-bodied slave should be used as a soldier. But, in October, he publicly refused to commit to the proposal, and Davis was also evasive. At the opening of the last session of Congress on November 7, Representative William Graham Swan of Tennessee sought a resolution against the use of Negro soldiers. The equivocating Davis effectively stalled the House, and a Committee was appointed to confer with the president to no avail.

In January, Congress received communication from Lee advocating the enlistment of slaves and their subsequent emancipation. On February 10, Representative Ethelbert Barksdale of Mississippi and Senator Williamson S. Oldham of Texas introduced bills in their respective houses providing for the raising of Negro troops, with Oldham proposing a requisition of 200,000 and Barksdale a number at the president&#x27;s discretion. Lee weighed in with another letter warning that the measure was both expedient and necessary, and that if the Confederate Congress did not use them, the Union Army would. The bill passed Congress, with a majority of Representatives from North Carolina, Texas, Arkansas, and Missouri voting against. The provision for manumission failed in the Senate by one vote, until the Virginia Assembly then in session, instructed its senators to vote for an emancipation provision, and the bill then passed with a nine to eight vote. The Act of March 13, 1865, authorized the president to raise 300,000 troops &quot;irrespective of color&quot;. A bitter Davis complained that he had wanted a statute arming the slaves the year before, at the beginning of 1864.

On February 6, 1865, Congress made Lee commanding general of all Confederate armies. In March, one of its final acts was the passage of a law allowing for the military induction of any slave willing to fight for the Confederacy. This measure had originally been proposed by Patrick Cleburne a year earlier but had met stiff opposition until the final months of the war, when it was endorsed by Lee. Davis had proposed buying 40,000 slaves and emancipating them, but neither Congress nor the Virginia General Assembly considered a similar proposal would provide for emancipation. Opponents such as Howell Cobb of Georgia claimed such an action would be &quot;the beginning of the end of the revolution. If slaves will make good soldiers, our whole theory of slavery is wrong.&quot; Davis and the War Department responded by fiat in General Order Number Fourteen asserting emancipation: &quot;No slave will be accepted as a recruit unless with his own consent and with the approbation of his master by a written instrument converting, as far as he may, the rights of a freedman.&quot; On March 23, the first black company of Confederates were seen drilling in the streets of Richmond.

In the closing days of the Confederacy, Congress and Davis were at loggerheads. The executive recommendations were debated, but not acted upon. March 18, 1865, was the last day of official business in the history of the Confederate States Congress. The Senate was still in secret session and the House in open session, although it adjourned with the wistful sine die as a last entry, &quot;the Confederate Congress, with its work still undone went silent forever&quot;.

Davis met with his cabinet for the last time on May 5, 1865, in Washington, Georgia. Davis&#x27;s cabinet declared the Confederate States of America dissolved and forthwith ceased any attempt to continue operating the executive branch of the Confederate government. As with the U.S. Constitution on which the C.S. Constitution was based, the president and executive branch had no constitutional power to dissolve the Confederate Congress under any circumstances, but, in any event, the fall of Richmond followed by the surrender and dissolution of the Confederate armies in April effectively had quashed any realistic prospect of the Confederate Congress ever re-convening. The Congress of the Confederate States of America is therefore generally considered to have been dissolved along with the entire Confederate government by May 5, 1865, at the latest; however, under a strict interpretation of the U.S. constitutional principle of separation of powers, the Confederate Congress&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; dissolution is regarded as being effective from the adjournment of its last meeting on March 18.

==Apportionment and representation==
The Confederate States Congress had delegations from 13 states and several territories and Indian tribes. The state delegation apportionment was specified in the Confederate Constitution using the same population basis for the free population and a three-fifths rule for slaves as had been used in the U.S. Constitution. There was to be one representative for every ninety thousand of the apportionment population, with any remaining fraction justifying an additional Congressman. After all thirteen states were admitted, there were 106 representatives in the Confederate House. The four most populous states were in the Upper South, and, shortly after the war began, the Union occupied all of Kentucky and Missouri, along with large portions of western Virginia and western Tennessee. Nevertheless, these states maintained full delegations in both national legislative bodies throughout the war. The seven original Confederate states had a total of forty-six representatives, or 43 percent of the House.

Except for the four states west of the Mississippi River (Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas), all Confederate states&#x27; apportionment in the U.S. Congress was going to decline into the 1860s. In the Confederate Congress, all would have larger delegations than they had from the census of 1850, except South Carolina, which was equal, and Missouri, which declined by one. The Confederate States Congress maintained representation in Virginia, Tennessee, and Louisiana throughout its existence. Unlike the U.S. Congress, there was no requirement for a majority of the voters in 1860 to vote for representatives for them to be seated. From 1861 to 1863, Virginia (east, north and west), Tennessee, and Louisiana had U.S. representation. Then, for 1863–1865, only the newly admitted West Virginia had U.S. representation. However, the whole of antebellum Virginia continued to be formally represented in the Confederate Congress until 1865, and West Virginians living in counties not under Federal control continued to participate in Confederate elections.

<text>KeyKOS is a persistent, pure capability-based operating system for the IBM S/370 mainframe computers. It allows emulating the environments of VM, MVS, and Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX). It is a predecessor of the Extremely Reliable Operating System (EROS), and its successor operating systems, CapROS, and Coyotos. KeyKOS is a nanokernel-based operating system.

In the mid-1970s, development of KeyKOS began at Tymshare, Inc., under the name GNOSIS. In 1984, McDonnell Douglas (MD) bought Tymshare. A year later MD spun off Key Logic, which bought GNOSIS and renamed it &quot;KeyKOS&quot;.

<doc id="1202013" wikidata="Q199203" url="?curid=1202013" title="Painted turtle">
<text>The painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) is the most widespread native turtle of North America. It lives in relatively slow-moving fresh waters, from southern Canada to northern Mexico, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. They have been shown to prefer large wetlands with long periods of inundation and emergent vegetation. This species is one of the few that is specially adapted to tolerate freezing temperatures for extended periods of time due to an antifreeze-like substance in their blood that keeps their cells from freezing. This turtle is a member of the genus &quot;Chrysemys&quot;, which is part of the pond turtle family Emydidae. Fossils show that the painted turtle existed 15 million years ago. Three regionally based subspecies (the eastern, midland, and western) evolved during the last ice age. The southern painted turtle (&quot;C. dorsalis&quot;) is alternately considered the only other species in &quot;Chrysemys&quot;, or another subspecies of &quot;C. picta&quot;.

The adult painted turtle is long; the male is smaller than the female. The turtle&#x27;s top shell is dark and smooth, without a ridge. Its skin is olive to black with red, orange, or yellow stripes on its extremities. The subspecies can be distinguished by their shells: the eastern has straight-aligned top shell segments; the midland has a large gray mark on the bottom shell; the western has a red pattern on the bottom shell.

The turtle eats aquatic vegetation, algae, and small water creatures including insects, crustaceans, and fish. Painted turtles primarily feed while in water and are able to locate and subdue prey even in heavily clouded conditions. Although they are frequently consumed as eggs or hatchlings by rodents, canines, and snakes, the adult turtles&#x27; hard shells protect them from most predators. Reliant on warmth from its surroundings, the painted turtle is active only during the day when it basks for hours on logs or rocks. During winter, the turtle hibernates, usually in the mud at the bottom of water bodies. The turtles mate in spring and autumn. Females dig nests on land and lay eggs between late spring and mid-summer. Hatched turtles grow until sexual maturity: 2–9 years for males, 6–16 for females.

In the traditional tales of Algonquian tribes, the colorful turtle played the part of a trickster. In modern times, four U.S. states (Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, and Vermont) have named the painted turtle their official reptile. While habitat loss and road killings have reduced the turtle&#x27;s population, its ability to live in human-disturbed settings has helped it remain the most abundant turtle in North America. Adults in the wild can live for more than 55 years.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The painted turtle (&quot;C. picta&quot;) is the only species in the genus &quot;Chrysemys&quot;. The parent family for &quot;Chrysemys&quot; is Emydidae: the pond turtles. Emydidae is split into two sub families; &quot;Chrysemys&quot; is part of the Deirochelyinae (Western Hemisphere) branch. The four subspecies of the painted turtle are the eastern (&quot;C. p. picta&quot;), midland (&quot;C. p. marginata&quot;), southern (&quot;C. p. dorsalis&quot;), and western (&quot;C. p. bellii&quot;).

The painted turtle&#x27;s generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek words for &quot;gold&quot; () and &quot;freshwater tortoise&quot; (&quot;&quot;); the species name originates from the Latin for &quot;colored&quot; (&quot;pictus&quot;). The subspecies name, &quot;marginata&quot;, derives from the Latin for &quot;border&quot; and refers to the red markings on the outer (marginal) part of the upper shell; &quot;dorsalis&quot; is from the Latin for &quot;back&quot;, referring to the prominent dorsal stripe; and &quot;bellii&quot; honors English zoologist Thomas Bell, a collaborator of Charles Darwin. An alternate East Coast common name for the painted turtle is &quot;skilpot&quot;, from the Dutch for turtle, &quot;schildpad&quot;.

===Classification===
Originally described in 1783 by Johann Gottlob Schneider as &quot;Testudo picta&quot;, the painted turtle was called &quot;Chrysemys picta&quot; first by John Edward Gray in 1855. Four subspecies were then recognized: the eastern by Schneider in 1783, the western by Gray in 1831, and the midland and southern by Louis Agassiz in 1857, though the southern painted turtle is now generally considered a full species.

===Subspecies===

Although the subspecies of painted turtle intergrade (blend together) at range boundaries they are distinct within the hearts of their ranges.

*The male eastern painted turtle (&quot;C. p. picta&quot;) is long, while the female is . The upper shell is olive green to black and may possess a pale stripe down the middle and red markings on the periphery. The segments (scutes) of the top shell have pale leading edges and occur in straight rows across the back, unlike all other North American turtles, including the other three subspecies of painted turtle, which have alternating segments. The bottom shell is plain yellow or lightly spotted. Sometimes as few as one dark grey spot near the lower center of the shell.
*The midland painted turtle (&quot;C. p. marginata&quot;) is long. The centrally located midland is the hardest to distinguish from the other three subspecies. Its bottom shell has a characteristic symmetrical dark shadow in the center which varies in size and prominence.
*The largest subspecies is the western painted turtle (&quot;C. p. bellii&quot;), which grows up to long. Its top shell has a mesh-like pattern of light lines, and the top stripe present in other subspecies is missing or faint. Its bottom shell has a large colored splotch that spreads to the edges (further than the midland) and often has red hues.

Until the 1930s, many of the subspecies of the painted turtle were labeled by biologists as full species within &quot;Chrysemys&quot;, but this varied by the researcher. The painted turtles in the border region between the western and midland subspecies were sometimes considered a full species, &quot;treleasei&quot;. In 1931, Bishop and Schmidt defined the current &quot;four in one&quot; taxonomy of species and subspecies. Based on comparative measurements of turtles from throughout the range, they subordinated species to subspecies and eliminated &quot;treleasei&quot;.

Since at least 1958, the subspecies were thought to have evolved in response to geographic isolation during the last ice age, 100,000 to 11,000 years ago. At that time painted turtles were divided into three different populations: eastern painted turtles along the southeastern Atlantic coast; southern painted turtles around the southern Mississippi River; and western painted turtles in the southwestern United States. The populations were not completely isolated for sufficiently long, hence wholly different species never evolved. When the glaciers retreated, about 11,000 years ago, all three subspecies moved north. The western and southern subspecies met in Missouri and hybridized to produce the midland painted turtle, which then moved east and north through the Ohio and Tennessee river basins.

Biologists have long debated the genera of closely related subfamily-mates &quot;Chrysemys,&quot; &quot;Pseudemys&quot; (cooters), and &quot;Trachemys&quot; (sliders). After 1952, some combined &quot;Pseudemys&quot; and &quot;Chrysemys&quot; because of similar appearance. In 1964, based on measurements of the skull and feet, Samuel B. McDowell proposed all three genera be merged into one. However, further measurements, in 1967, contradicted this taxonomic arrangement. Also in 1967, J. Alan Holman, a paleontologist and herpetologist, pointed out that, although the three turtles were often found together in nature and had similar mating patterns, they did not crossbreed. In the 1980s, studies of turtles&#x27; cell structures, biochemistries, and parasites further indicated that &quot;Chrysemys&quot;, &quot;Pseudemys&quot;, and &quot;Trachemys&quot; should remain in separate genera.

In 2003, Starkey &quot;et al.&quot; proposed that &quot;Chrysemys dorsalis&quot;, formerly considered a subspecies of &quot;C. picta&quot;, to be a distinct species sister to all subspecies in &quot;C. picta&quot;. Although this proposal was largely unrecognized at the time due to evidence of hybridization between &quot;dorsalis&quot; and &quot;picta&quot;, the Turtle Taxonomy Working Group and the Reptile Database have since followed through with it, although both the subspecific and specific names have been recognized.

===Fossils===
Although its evolutionary history—what the forerunner to the species was and how the close relatives branched off—is not well understood, the painted turtle is common in the fossil record. The oldest samples, found in Nebraska, date to about 15 million years ago. Fossils from 15 million to about 5 million years ago are restricted to the Nebraska-Kansas area, but more recent fossils are gradually more widely distributed. Fossils newer than 300,000 years old are found in almost all the United States and southern Canada.

===DNA===
The turtle&#x27;s karyotype (nuclear DNA, rather than mitochondrial DNA) consists of 50 chromosomes, the same number as the rest of its subfamily-mates and the most common number for Emydidae turtles in general. Less well-related turtles have from 26 to 66 chromosomes. Little systematic study of variations of the painted turtle&#x27;s karotype among populations has been done. (However, in 1967, research on &quot;protein&quot; structure of offshore island populations in New England, showed differences from mainland turtles.)

Comparison of subspecies chromosomal DNA has been discussed, to help address the debate over Starkey&#x27;s proposed taxonomy, but as of 2009 had not been reported. The complete sequencing of the genetic code for the painted turtle was at a &quot;draft assembled&quot; state in 2010. The turtle was one of two reptiles chosen to be first sequenced.
==Description==

Adult painted turtles can grow to long, with males being smaller. The shell is oval, smooth with little grooves where the large scale-like plates overlap, and flat-bottomed. The color of the top shell (carapace) varies from olive to black. Darker specimens are more common where the bottom of the water body is darker. The bottom shell (plastron) is yellow, sometimes red, sometimes with dark markings in the center. Similar to the top shell, the turtle&#x27;s skin is olive to black, but with red and yellow stripes on its neck, legs, and tail. As with other pond turtles, such as the bog turtle, the painted turtle&#x27;s feet are webbed to aid swimming.

The head of the turtle is distinctive. The face has only yellow stripes, with a large yellow spot and streak behind each eye, and on the chin two wide yellow stripes that meet at the tip of the jaw. The turtle&#x27;s upper jaw is shaped into an inverted &quot;V&quot; (philtrum), with a downward-facing, tooth-like projection on each side.

The hatchling has a proportionally larger head, eyes, and tail, and a more circular shell than the adult. The adult female is generally longer than the male, versus . For a given length, the female has a higher (more rounded, less flat) top shell. The female weighs around on average, against the males&#x27; average adult weight of roughly . The female&#x27;s greater body volume supports her egg-production. The male has longer foreclaws and a longer, thicker tail, with the anus (cloaca) located further out on the tail.

===Similar species===

The painted turtle has a very similar appearance to the red-eared slider (the most common pet turtle) and the two are often confused. The painted turtle can be distinguished because it is flatter than the slider. Also, the slider has a prominent red marking on the side of its head (the &quot;ear&quot;) and a spotted bottom shell, both features missing in the painted turtle.

==Distribution==

===Range===

The most widespread North American turtle, the painted turtle is the only turtle whose native range extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It is native to eight of Canada&#x27;s ten provinces, forty-five of the fifty United States, and one of Mexico&#x27;s thirty-one states. On the East Coast, it lives from the Canadian Maritimes to the U.S. state of Georgia. On the West Coast, it lives in British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon and offshore on southeast Vancouver Island. The northernmost American turtle, its range includes much of southern Canada. To the south, its range reaches the U.S. Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Alabama. In the southwestern United States there are only dispersed populations. It is found in one river in extreme northern Mexico. It is absent in a part of southwestern Virginia and the adjacent states as well as in north-central Alabama. There is a harsher divide between midland and eastern painted turtles in the southeast because they are separated by the Appalachian mountains, but the two subspecies tend to mix in the northeast.

The borders between the four subspecies are not sharp, because the subspecies interbreed. Many studies have been performed in the border regions to assess the intermediate turtles, usually by comparing the anatomical features of hybrids that result from intergradation of the classical subspecies. Despite the imprecision, the subspecies are assigned nominal ranges.

====Eastern painted turtle====

The eastern painted turtle ranges from southeastern Canada to Georgia with a western boundary at approximately the Appalachians. At its northern extremes, the turtle tends to be restricted to the warmer areas closer to the Atlantic Ocean. It is uncommon in far north New Hampshire and in Maine is common only in a strip about 50 miles from the coast. In Canada, it lives in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia but not in Quebec or Prince Edward Island. To the south it is not found in the coastal lowlands of southern North Carolina, South Carolina, or Georgia, or in southern Georgia in general or at all in Florida.

In the northeast, there is extensive mixing with the midland subspecies, and some writers have called these turtles a &quot;hybrid swarm&quot;. In the southeast, the border between the eastern and midland is more sharp as mountain chains separate the subspecies to different drainage basins.

====Midland painted turtle====

The midland painted turtle lives from southern Ontario and Quebec, through the eastern U.S. Midwest states, to Kentucky, Tennessee and northwestern Alabama, where it intergrades with the southern painted turtle. It also is found eastward through West Virginia, western Maryland and Pennsylvania. The midland painted turtle appears to be moving east, especially in Pennsylvania. To the northeast it is found in western New York and much of Vermont, and it intergrades extensively with the eastern subspecies.

====Western painted turtle====

The western painted turtle&#x27;s northern range includes southern parts of western Canada from Ontario through Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. In Ontario, the western subspecies is found north of Minnesota and directly north of Lake Superior, but there is a gap to the east of Lake Superior (in the area of harshest winter climate) where no painted turtles of any subspecies occur. Thus Ontario&#x27;s western subspecies does not intergrade with the midland painted turtle of southeastern Ontario. In Manitoba, the turtle is numerous and ranges north to Lake Manitoba and the lower part of Lake Winnipeg. The turtle is also common in south Saskatchewan, but in Alberta, there may only be 100 individuals, all found very near the U.S. border, mostly in the southeast.

In British Columbia, populations exist in the interior in the vicinity of the Kootenai, Columbia, Okanagan, and Thompson river valleys. At the coast, turtles occur near the mouth of the Fraser and a bit further north, as well as the bottom of Vancouver Island, and some other nearby islands. Within British Columbia, the turtle&#x27;s range is not continuous and can better be understood as northward extensions of the range from the United States. High mountains present barriers to east–west movement of the turtles within the province or from Alberta. Some literature has shown isolated populations much further north in British Columbia and Alberta, but these were probably pet-releases.

In the United States, the western subspecies forms a wide intergrade area with the midland subspecies covering much of Illinois as well as a strip of Wisconsin along Lake Michigan and part of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (UP). Further west, the rest of Illinois, Wisconsin and the UP are part of the range proper, as are all of Minnesota and Iowa, as well as all of Missouri except a narrow strip in the south. All of North Dakota is within range, all of South Dakota except a very small area in the west, and all of Nebraska. Almost all of Kansas is in range; the border of that state with Oklahoma is roughly the species range border, but the turtle is found in three counties of north central Oklahoma.

To the northwest, almost all of Montana is in range. Only a narrow strip in the west, along most of the Idaho border (which is at the Continental Divide) lacks turtles. Wyoming is almost entirely out of range; only the lower elevation areas near the eastern and northern borders have painted turtles. In Idaho, the turtles are found throughout the far north (upper half of the Idaho Panhandle). Recently, separate Idaho populations have been observed in the southwest (near the Payette and Boise rivers) and the southeast (near St. Anthony). In Washington state, turtles are common throughout the state within lower elevation river valleys. In Oregon, the turtle is native to the northern part of the state throughout the Columbia River Valley as well as the Willamette River Valley north of Salem.

To the southwest, the painted turtle&#x27;s range is fragmented. In Colorado, while range is continuous in the eastern, prairie, half of the state, it is absent in most of the western, mountainous, part of the state. However, the turtle is confirmed present in the lower elevation southwest part of the state (Archuleta and La Plata counties), where a population ranges into northern New Mexico in the San Juan River basin. In New Mexico, the main distribution follows the Rio Grande and the Pecos River, two waterways that run in a north–south direction through the state. Within the aforementioned rivers, it is also found in the northern part of Far West Texas. In Utah, the painted turtle lives in an area to the south (Kane County) in streams draining into the Colorado River, although it is disputed if they are native. In Arizona, the painted turtle is native to an area in the east, Lyman Lake. The painted turtle is not native to Nevada or California.

In Mexico, painted turtles have been found about 50 miles south of New Mexico near Galeana in the state of Chihuahua. There, two expeditions found the turtles in the Rio Santa Maria which is in a closed basin.
====Human-introduced range====

Pet releases are starting to establish the painted turtle outside its native range. It has been introduced into waterways near Phoenix, Arizona, and to Germany, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Spain.

===Habitat===

To thrive, painted turtles need fresh waters with soft bottoms, basking sites, and aquatic vegetation. They find their homes in shallow waters with slow-moving currents, such as creeks, marshes, ponds, and the shores of lakes. The subspecies have evolved different habitat preferences.

*The eastern painted turtle is very aquatic, leaving the immediate vicinity of its water body only when forced by drought to migrate. Along the Atlantic, painted turtles have appeared in brackish waters. They can be found in wetland areas like swamps and marshes with a thick layer of mud as well as sandy bottoms with lots of vegetation. Areas with warmer climates have higher relative densities among populations and habitat desirability also influences density.
*The midland and southern painted turtles seek especially quiet waters, usually shores and coves. They favor shallows that contain dense vegetation and have an unusual toleration of pollution.
*The western painted turtle lives in streams and lakes, similar to the other painted turtles, but also inhabits pasture ponds and roadside pools. It is found as high as .

===Population features===
Within much of its range, the painted turtle is the most abundant turtle species. Population densities range from 10 to 840 turtles per hectare (2.5 acres) of water surface. Warmer climates produce higher relative densities among populations, and habitat desirability also influences density. Rivers and large lakes have lower densities because only the shore is desirable habitat; the central, deep waters skew the surface-based estimates. Also, lake and river turtles have to make longer linear trips to access equivalent amounts of foraging space.

Adults outnumber juveniles in most populations, but gauging the ratios is difficult because juveniles are harder to catch; with current sampling methods, estimates of age distribution vary widely. Annual survival rate of painted turtles increases with age. The probability of a painted turtle surviving from the egg to its first birthday is only 19%. For females, the annual survival rate rises to 45% for juveniles and 95% for adults. The male survival rates follow a similar pattern, but are probably lower overall than females, as evidenced by the average male age being lower than that of the female. Natural disasters can confound age distributions. For instance, a hurricane can destroy many nests in a region, resulting in fewer hatchlings the next year. Age distributions may also be skewed by migrations of adults.

To understand painted turtle adult age distributions, researchers require reliable methods. Turtles younger than four years (up to 12 years in some populations) can be aged based on &quot;growth rings&quot; in their shells. For older turtles, some attempts have been made to determine age based on size and shape of their shells or legs using mathematical models, but this method is more uncertain. The most reliable method to study the long-lived turtles is to capture them, permanently mark their shells by notching with a drill, release the turtles, and then recapture them in later years. The longest-running study, in Michigan, has shown that painted turtles can live more than 55 years.

Adult sex ratios of painted turtle populations average around 1:1. Many populations are slightly male-heavy, but some are strongly female-imbalanced; one population in Ontario has a female to male ratio of 4:1. Hatchling sex ratio varies based on egg temperature. During the middle third of incubation, temperatures of produce males, and anything above or below that, females. It does not appear that females choose nesting sites to influence the sex of the hatchlings; within a population, nests will vary sufficiently to give both male and female-heavy broods.

==Ecology==

===Diet===

The painted turtle is a bottom-dwelling hunter. It quickly juts its head into and out of vegetation to stir potential victims out into the open water, where they are pursued. Large prey is ripped apart with the forefeet as the turtle holds it in its mouth. It also consumes plants and skims the surface of the water with its mouth open to catch small particles of food.

Although all subspecies of painted turtle eat both plants and animals (in the form of leaves, algae, fish, crustaceans, aquatic insects and carrion), their specific diets vary. Young painted turtles are mostly carnivorous and as they mature they become more herbivorous.

Painted turtles obtain coloration from carotenoids in their natural diet by eating algae and a variety of aquatic plants from their environment. Stripes and spots increase red and yellow chroma and decrease UV chroma and brightness in turtles with large amounts of carotenoids in their diet compared to the stripes and spots of turtles with only moderate amounts of carotenoids in their diet.

*The eastern painted turtle&#x27;s diet is the least studied. It prefers to eat in the water, but has been observed eating on land. The fish it consumes are typically dead or injured.
*The midland painted turtle eats mostly aquatic insects and both vascular and non-vascular plants.
*The western painted turtle&#x27;s consumption of plants and animals changes seasonally. In early summer, 60% of its diet comprises insects. In late summer, 55% includes plants. Of note, the western painted turtle aids in the dispersal of white water-lily seeds. The turtle consumes the hard-coated seeds, which remain viable after passing through the turtle, and disperses them through its feces.

===Predators===

Painted turtles are most vulnerable to predators when young. Nests are frequently ransacked and the eggs eaten by garter snakes, crows, chipmunks, thirteen-lined ground and gray squirrels, skunks, groundhogs, raccoons, badgers, gray and red fox, and humans. The small and sometimes bite-size, numerous hatchlings fall prey to water bugs, bass, catfish, bullfrogs, snapping turtles, three types of snakes (copperheads, racers and water snakes), herons, rice rats, weasels, muskrats, minks, and raccoons. As adults, the turtles&#x27; armored shells protect them from many potential predators, but they still occasionally fall prey to alligators, ospreys, crows, red-shouldered hawks, bald eagles, and especially raccoons.

Painted turtles defend themselves by kicking, scratching, biting, or urinating. In contrast to land tortoises, painted turtles can right themselves if they are flipped upside down.

==Life cycle==

===Mating===

The painted turtles mate in spring and fall in waters of . Males start producing sperm in early spring, when they can bask to an internal temperature of . Females begin their reproductive cycles in mid-summer, and ovulate the following spring.

Courtship begins when a male follows a female until he meets her face-to-face. He then strokes her face and neck with his elongated front claws, a gesture returned by a receptive female. The pair repeat the process several times, with the male retreating from and then returning to the female until she swims to the bottom, where they copulate. As the male is smaller than the female, he is not dominant. Although not directly observed, evidence indicates that the male will inflict injury on the female in attempts of coercion. Males will use their tooth-like cusps on their beaks and their foreclaws during this act of coercion with the female. The female stores sperm, to be used for up to three clutches, in her oviducts; the sperm may remain viable for up to three years. A single clutch may have multiple fathers.

===Egg-laying===

Nesting is done, by the females only, between late May and mid-July. The nests are vase-shaped and are usually dug in sandy soil, often at sites with southern exposures. Nests are often within of water, but may be as far away as , with older females tending to nest further inland. Nest sizes vary depending on female sizes and locations but are about deep. Females may return to the same sites several consecutive years, but if several females make their nests close together, the eggs become more vulnerable to predators. Female eastern painted turtles have been shown to nest together, possibly even participating in communal nesting.

The female&#x27;s optimal body temperature while digging her nest is . If the weather is unsuitable, for instance a too hot night in the Southeast, she delays the process until later at night. Painted turtles in Virginia have been observed waiting three weeks to nest because of a hot drought.

While preparing to dig her nest, the female sometimes exhibits a mysterious preliminary behavior. She presses her throat against the ground of different potential sites, perhaps sensing moisture, warmth, texture, or smell, although her exact motivation is unknown. She may further temporize by excavating several false nests as the wood turtles also do.

The female relies on her hind feet for digging. She may accumulate so much sand and mud on her feet that her mobility is reduced, making her vulnerable to predators. To lighten her labors, she lubricates the area with her bladder water. Once the nest is complete, the female deposits into the hole. The freshly laid eggs are white, elliptical, porous, and flexible. From start to finish, the female&#x27;s work may take four hours. Sometimes she remains on land overnight afterwards, before returning to her home water.

Females can lay five clutches per year, but two is a normal average after including the 30–50% of a population&#x27;s females that do not produce any clutches in a given year. In some northern populations, no females lay more than one clutch per year. Bigger females tend to lay bigger eggs and more eggs per clutch. Clutch sizes of the subspecies vary, although the differences may reflect different environments, rather than different genetics. The two more northerly subspecies, western and midland, are larger and have more eggs per clutch—11.9 and 7.6, respectively—than the eastern (4.9). Within subspecies, also, the more northerly females lay larger clutches.

===Growth===
Incubation lasts 72–80 days in the wild and for a similar period in artificial conditions. In August and September, the young turtle breaks out from its egg, using a special projection of its jaw called the egg tooth. Not all offspring leave the nest immediately, though. Hatchlings north of a line from Nebraska to northern Illinois to New Jersey typically arrange themselves symmetrically in the nest and overwinter to emerge the following spring.

The hatchling&#x27;s ability to survive winter in the nest has allowed the painted turtle to extend its range farther north than any other American turtle. The painted turtle is genetically adapted to survive extended periods of subfreezing temperatures with blood that can remain supercooled and skin that resists penetration from ice crystals in the surrounding ground. The hardest freezes nevertheless kill many hatchlings.

Immediately after hatching, turtles are dependent on egg yolk material for sustenance. About a week to a week and a half after emerging from their eggs (or the following spring if emergence is delayed), hatchlings begin feeding to support growth. The young turtles grow rapidly at first, sometimes doubling their size in the first year. Growth slows sharply at sexual maturity and may stop completely. Likely owing to differences of habitat and food by water body, growth rates often differ from population to population in the same area. Among the subspecies, the western painted turtles are the quickest growers.

Females grow faster than males overall, and must be larger to mature sexually. In most populations males reach sexual maturity at 2–4 years old, and females at 6–10. Size and age at maturity increase with latitude; at the northern edge of their range, males reach sexual maturity at 7–9 years of age and females at 11–16.
==Behavior==

===Daily routine and basking===

A cold-blooded reptile, the painted turtle regulates its temperature through its environment, notably by basking. All ages bask for warmth, often alongside other species of turtle. Sometimes more than 50 individuals are seen on one log together. Turtles bask on a variety of objects, often logs, but have even been seen basking on top of common loons that were covering eggs.

The turtle starts its day at sunrise, emerging from the water to bask for several hours. Warmed for activity, it returns to the water to forage. After becoming chilled, the turtle re-emerges for one to two more cycles of basking and feeding. At night, the turtle drops to the bottom of its water body or perches on an underwater object and sleeps.

To be active, the turtle must maintain an internal body temperature between . When fighting infection, it manipulates its temperature up to higher than normal.

===Seasonal routine and hibernation===
In the spring, when the water reaches , the turtle begins actively foraging. However, if the water temperature exceeds , the turtle will not feed. In fall, the turtle stops foraging when temperatures drop below the spring set-point.

During the winter, the turtle hibernates. In the north, the inactive season may be as long as from October to March, while the southernmost populations may not hibernate at all. While hibernating, the body temperature of the painted turtle averages . Periods of warm weather bring the turtle out of hibernation, and even in the north, individuals have been seen basking in February.

The painted turtle hibernates by burying itself, either on the bottom of a body of water, near water in the shore-bank or the burrow of a muskrat, or in woods or pastures. When hibernating underwater, the turtle prefers shallow depths, no more than . Within the mud, it may dig down an additional . In this state, the turtle does not breathe, although if surroundings allow, it may get some oxygen through its skin. The species is one of the best-studied vertebrates able to survive long periods without oxygen. Adaptations of its blood chemistry, brain, heart, and particularly its shell allow the turtle to survive extreme lactic acid buildup while oxygen-deprived.

=== Anoxia tolerance ===
During the winter months, painted turtles become ice-locked and spend their time in either hypoxic (low oxygen) or anoxic (no oxygen) regions of the pond or lake. Painted turtles essentially hold their breath until the following spring when the ice melts. As a result, painted turtles rely on anaerobic respiration, which leads to the production of lactic acid. However, painted turtles can tolerate long periods of anoxia due to three factors: a depressed metabolic rate, large glycogen stores in the liver, and sequestering lactate in the shell and releasing carbonate buffers to the extracellular fluid.

The shell of an adult painted turtle has the largest concentration of carbonate content recorded among animals. This large carbonate content helps the painted turtle buffer the accumulation of lactic acid during anoxia. Both the shell and skeleton release calcium and magnesium carbonates to buffer extracellular lactic acid. A painted turtle can also sequester 44% of total body lactate in their shell. Despite the shell&#x27;s large buffering contribution, it does not experience any significant decrease in mechanical properties under natural conditions.

The duration of anoxia tolerance varies depending on the sub-species of painted turtle. The western painted turtle (&quot;C. picta bellii&quot;) can survive 170 days of anoxia, followed by the midland painted turtle (&quot;C. picta marginata&quot;) which can survive 150 days, and finally the eastern painted turtle (&quot;C. picta picta&quot;), which can survive 125 days. Differences in anoxia tolerance are partially attributed to the rate of lactate production and buffering capability in painted turtles. Furthermore, northern populations of painted turtles have a higher anoxia tolerance than southern populations.

Other anoxia tolerant freshwater turtles include: the southern painted turtle (&quot;Chrysemys dorsalis&quot;), which can survive 75–86 days of anoxia, the snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina), which can survive 100 days under anoxia, and the map turtle (Graptemys geographica), which can survive 50 days of anoxia. One reason for the difference in duration between more anoxia-tolerant species and less anoxia-tolerant species is the turtle&#x27;s ability to buffer lactic acid accumulation during anoxia.

Unlike adult painted turtles, hatchlings can survive only 40 days, but still exhibit high anoxia tolerance and freeze tolerance compared to other hatchling species (30 days for &quot;Chelydra serpentina&quot;, and 15 days for &quot;Graptemys geographica&quot;) due to cold winters.

===Movement===

Searching for water, food, or mates, the painted turtles travel up to several kilometers at a time. During summer, in response to heat and water-clogging vegetation, the turtles may vacate shallow marshes for more permanent waters. Short overland migrations may involve hundreds of turtles together. If heat and drought are prolonged, the turtles will bury themselves and, in extreme cases, die.

Foraging turtles frequently cross lakes or travel linearly down creeks. Daily crossings of large ponds have been observed. Tag and release studies show that sex also drives turtle movement. Males travel the most, up to , between captures; females the second most, up to , between captures; and juveniles the least, less than , between captures. Males move the most and are most likely to change wetlands because they seek mates.

The painted turtles, through visual recognition, have homing capabilities. Many individuals can return to their collection points after being released elsewhere, trips that may require them to traverse land. One experiment placed 98 turtles varying several-kilometer distances from their home wetland; 41 returned. When living in a single large body of water, the painted turtles can home from up to away. Another experiment found that if placed far enough away from water the turtles will just walk in straight paths and not orient towards water or in any specific direction which indicates a lack of homing ability. Females may use homing to help locate suitable nesting sites.

Eastern painted turtle movements may contribute to aquatic plant seed dispersal. A study done in Massachusetts found that the quantity of intact macrophyte seeds defecated by Eastern painted turtles can be high and that the seeds of specifically &quot;Nymphaea ordorata&quot; that were found in feces were capable of moderate to high level germination. As turtles move between ponds and habitats, they carry seeds along with them to new locations.
==Interaction with humans==

===Conservation===


The species is currently classified as least concern by the IUCN but populations have been subject to decline locally.

The decline in painted turtle populations is not a simple matter of dramatic range reduction, like that of the American bison. Instead the turtle is classified as G5 (demonstrably widespread) in its Natural Heritage Global Rank, and the IUCN rates it as a species of least concern. The painted turtle&#x27;s high reproduction rate and its ability to survive in polluted wetlands and artificially made ponds have allowed it to maintain its range, but the post-Columbus settlement of North America has reduced its numbers.

Only within the Pacific Northwest is the turtle&#x27;s range eroding. Even there, in Washington, the painted turtle is designated S5 (demonstrably widespread). However, in Oregon, the painted turtle is designated S2 (imperiled), and in British Columbia, the turtle&#x27;s populations in the Coast and Interior regions are labeled &quot;endangered&quot; and &quot;of special concern&quot;, respectively.

Much is written about the different factors that threaten the painted turtle, but they are unquantified, with only inferences of relative importance. A primary threat category is habitat loss in various forms. Related to water habitat, there is drying of wetlands, clearing of aquatic logs or rocks (basking sites), and clearing of shoreline vegetation, which allows more predator access or increased human foot traffic. Related to nesting habitat, urbanization or planting can remove needed sunny soils.

Another significant human impact is roadkill—dead turtles, especially females, are commonly seen on summer roads. In addition to direct killing, roads genetically isolate some populations. Localities have tried to limit roadkill by constructing underpasses, highway barriers, and crossing signs. Oregon has introduced public education on turtle awareness, safe swerving, and safely assisting turtles across the road.

In the West, human-introduced bass, bullfrogs, and especially snapping turtles, have increased the predation of hatchlings. Outside the Southeast, where sliders are native, released pet red-eared slider turtles increasingly compete with painted turtles. In cities, increased urban predators (raccoons, canines, and felines) may impact painted turtles by eating their eggs.

Other factors of concern for the painted turtles include over-collection from the wild, released pets introducing diseases or reducing genetic variability, pollution, boating traffic, angler&#x27;s hooks (the turtles are noteworthy bait-thieves), wanton shooting, and crushing by agricultural machines or golf course lawnmowers or all-terrain vehicles. Gervais and colleagues note that research itself impacts the populations and that much funded turtle trapping work has not been published. They advocate discriminating more on what studies are done, thereby putting fewer turtles into scientists&#x27; traps. Global warming represents an uncharacterized future threat.

As the most common turtle in Nova Scotia, the eastern painted turtle is not listed under the Species at Risk Act for conservation requirements.

===Pets and other uses===

According to a trade data study, painted turtles were the second most popular pet turtles after red-eared sliders in the early 1990s. As of 2010, most U.S. states allow, but discourage, painted turtle pets, although Oregon forbids keeping them as pets, and Indiana prohibits their sale. U.S. federal law prohibits sale or transport of any turtle less than , to limit human contact to salmonella. However, a loophole for scientific samples allows some small turtles to be sold, and illegal trafficking also occurs.

Painted turtle pet-keeping requirements are similar to those of the red-eared slider. Keepers are urged to provide them with adequate space and a basking site, and water that is regularly filtered and changed. Aquatic turtles are generally unsuitable pets for children, as they do not enjoy being held. Hobbyists have maintained turtles in captivity for decades. Painted turtles are long-lived pets, and have a lifespan of up to 40 years in captivity.

The painted turtle is sometimes eaten but is not highly regarded as food, as even the largest subspecies, the western painted turtle, is inconveniently small and larger turtles are available. Schools frequently dissect painted turtles, which are sold by biological supply companies; specimens often come from the wild but may be captive-bred. In the Midwest, turtle racing is popular at summer fairs.

===Capture===

Commercial harvesting of painted turtles in the wild is controversial and, increasingly, restricted. Wisconsin formerly had virtually unrestricted trapping of painted turtles but based on qualitative observations forbade all commercial harvesting in 1997. Neighboring Minnesota, where trappers collected more than 300,000 painted turtles during the 1990s, commissioned a study of painted turtle harvesting. Scientists found that harvested lakes averaged half the painted turtle density of off-limit lakes, and population modeling suggested that unrestricted harvests could produce a large decline in turtle populations. In response, Minnesota forbade new harvesters in 2002 and limited trap numbers. Although harvesting continued, subsequent takes averaged half those of the 1990s. In 2023, Minnesota banned the practice of commercial turtle trapping. As of 2009, painted turtles faced virtually unlimited harvesting in Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Ohio, and Oklahoma; since then, Missouri has prohibited their harvesting.

Individuals who trap painted turtles typically do so to earn additional income, selling a few thousand a year at $1–2 each. Many trappers have been involved in the trade for generations, and value it as a family activity. Some harvesters disagree with limiting the catch, saying the populations are not dropping.

Many U.S. state fish and game departments allow non-commercial taking of painted turtles under a creel limit, and require a fishing (sometimes hunting) license; others completely forbid the recreational capture of painted turtles. Trapping is not allowed in Oregon, where western painted turtle populations are in decline, and in Missouri, where there are populations of both southern and western subspecies. In Canada, Ontario protects both subspecies present, the midland and western, and British Columbia protects its dwindling western painted turtles.

Capture methods are also regulated by locality. Typically trappers use either floating &quot;basking traps&quot; or partially submerged, baited &quot;hoop traps&quot;. Trapper opinions, commercial records, and scientific studies show that basking traps are more effective for collecting painted turtles, while the hoop traps work better for collecting &quot;meat turtles&quot; (snapping turtles and soft-shell turtles). Nets, hand capture, and fishing with set lines are generally legal, but shooting, chemicals, and explosives are forbidden.
===Culture===

Native American tribes were familiar with the painted turtle—young braves were trained to recognize its splashing into water as an alarm—and incorporated it in folklore. A Potawatomi myth describes how the talking turtles, &quot;Painted Turtle&quot; and allies &quot;Snapping Turtle&quot; and &quot;Box Turtle&quot;, outwit the village women. Painted Turtle is the star of the legend and uses his distinctive markings to trick a woman into holding him so he can bite her. An Illini myth recounts how Painted Turtle put his paint on to entice a chief&#x27;s daughter into the water.

As of 2010, four U.S. states designated the painted turtle as official reptile. Vermont honored the reptile in 1994, following the suggestion of Cornwall Elementary School students. In 1995, Michigan followed, based on the recommendation of Niles fifth graders, who discovered the state lacked an official reptile. On February 2, 2005, Representative Bob Biggins introduced a bill to make the tiger salamander the official state amphibian of Illinois and to make the painted turtle the official state reptile. The bill was signed into law by Governor Rod Blagojevich on July 19, 2005. Colorado chose the western painted turtle in 2008, following the efforts of two succeeding years of Jay Biachi&#x27;s fourth grade classes. In New York, the painted turtle narrowly lost (5,048 to 5,005, versus the common snapping turtle) a 2006 statewide student election for state reptile.

In the border town of Boissevain, Manitoba, a western painted turtle, &quot;Tommy the Turtle&quot;, is a roadside attraction. The statue was built in 1974 to celebrate the Canadian Turtle Derby, a festival including turtle races that ran from 1972 to 2001.

Another Canadian admirer of the painted turtle is Jon Montgomery, who won the 2010 Olympic gold medal in skeleton (a form of sled) racing, while wearing a painted turtle painting on the crown of his helmet, prominently visible when he slid downhill. Montgomery, who also iconically tattooed his chest with a maple-leaf, explained his visual promotion of the turtle, saying that he had assisted one to cross the road. BC Hydro referred to Montgomery&#x27;s action when describing its own sponsorship of conservation research for the turtle in British Columbia.

Several private entities use the painted turtle as a symbol. Wayne State University Press operates an imprint &quot;named after the Michigan state reptile&quot; that &quot;publishes books on regional topics of cultural and historical interest&quot;. In California, The Painted Turtle is a camp for ill children, founded by Paul Newman. Painted Turtle Winery of British Columbia trades on the &quot;laid back and casual lifestyle&quot; of the turtle with a &quot;job description to bask in the sun&quot;. Also, there is an Internet company in Michigan, a guesthouse in British Columbia, and a café in Maine that use the painted turtle commercially.

In children&#x27;s books, the painted turtle is a popular subject, with at least seven books published between 2000 and 2010.

<text>Midland Bank Plc was one of the Big Four banking groups in the United Kingdom for most of the 20th century. It is now part of HSBC. The bank was founded as the Birmingham and Midland Bank in Union Street, Birmingham, England in August 1836. It expanded in the Midlands, absorbing many local banks, and merged with the Central Bank of London Ltd. in 1891, becoming the London City and Midland Bank.

After a period of nationwide expansion, including the acquisition of many smaller banks, the name Midland Bank Ltd was adopted in 1923. By 1934, it was the largest deposit bank in the world. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange, and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index, but in June 1992, it was taken over by HSBC Holdings plc, which phased out the Midland Bank name by June 1999 in favour of HSBC Bank.

On 10 June 2015, HSBC announced that it would be rebranding its branches in the United Kingdom. HSBC chairman Douglas Flint described the Midland brand as &quot;odds on favourite&quot; for a return to the high street. In September 2015, it was announced that the Midland Bank name would not be revived, and the branch network in the United Kingdom would be branded &quot;HSBC UK&quot;.

== History ==

===Early history===

Midland Bank was founded by Charles Geach, its first manager in Union Street, Birmingham, England, in August 1836. Geach had formerly worked at the Bank of England; he secured the business support and capital backing of leading merchants and manufacturers in Birmingham.

In the 1830s and 1840s, Midland offered discounted bills of exchange for customers. By the 1850s the bank&#x27;s customers included railways, iron founders and engineering concerns, utilities and municipal corporations.

Midland acquired Stourbridge Old Bank in 1851 and Nichols, Baker and Crane of Bewdley in 1862.

===Acquisitions and development in its first 50 years===
From the 1880s, it expanded its customer base by opening new branches and acquiring other banks. In 1891 it acquired the Central Bank of London (which gave Midland a seat in the London Bankers&#x27; Clearing House, in 1898 it bought the City Bank (which provided a London head office), in 1901 it acquired the Sheffield Union Bank, in 1913 the Sheffield and Hallamshire Bank and, in 1914, it acquired the Birmingham Banking Company.

By 1918, with deposits of £335 million, it ranked as the largest bank in the world. Edward Hopkinson Holden led the bank at this time first as managing director from 1898 to 1908 and then as chairman and managing director from 1908 until his death in 1919. He oversaw more than twenty bank amalgamations between 1891 and 1918, and opened new branches throughout England and Wales.

Holden also expanded overseas; it was the first British bank to set up a foreign exchange department and, by 1919, it was acting as London bank to some 650 correspondent banks throughout the world. From 1907, these correspondents included The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.

After the First World War, the leading British banks entered an agreement with the government that they would not attempt further amalgamations without Treasury approval. As a result, Midland turned its attention to expanding its branch network, adding new banking services, mechanising its systems (from 1928) and advertising its activities.

===Post-war recovery and international alliances===

Midland responded to the ending of credit restrictions in 1958, by extending its branch network and by introducing a series of innovative services, including personal loans (1958), personal cheque accounts (1958) and cheque cards (1966). In 1958, it acquired Forward Trust, which became a leader in instalment finance, leasing and factoring services.

In 1967, Midland acquired a share in Montagu Trust, the owner of Samuel Montagu &amp; Co., and thereby became the first British clearing bank to own a London merchant bank. Samuel Montagu, with its own history dating back to 1853, became a wholly owned subsidiary in 1974, and is now part of HSBC&#x27;s private banking business.

Through the acquisition of Samuel Montagu &amp; Co, Midland also gained a majority share in Guyerzeller Bank AG (now HSBC Guyerzeller Bank) in Switzerland. Further diversification followed in 1972, when Midland was the leading member of the consortium that acquired the Thomas Cook travel business. After becoming sole owner in 1977, Midland sold its interest in 1992.

In 1974, Midland began to open branches or representative offices in overseas countries and to acquire other international banks. The largest of these was the purchase of a majority share in Crocker National of California, United States: this was not a success and Midland was forced to take full ownership in 1985 so that it could sell it to Wells Fargo the following year.

In 1980, Midland acquired a controlling interest in Trinkaus &amp; Burkhardt KGaA, a private bank in Germany with a long history of its own, today HSBC Trinkaus.

In 1984, in a bid to grab market share Midland scrapped current account charges. It was so successful that all other banks in the United Kingdom had to quickly follow and offer the same or risk losing their customers. The country has had free banking ever since.

===Midland joins the HSBC Group===
The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation acquired a 14.9% equity interest in Midland Bank in 1987, and a strong working relationship developed. In October 1989, First Direct was established and was at the forefront of telephone banking, with person to person service available twenty four hours a day, 365 days a year.

In June 1992, following a brief bidding war with Lloyds Bank, HSBC Holdings plc acquired full ownership of Midland Bank. At the time, it was one of the largest acquisitions in banking history, and gave HSBC a major foothold in Europe, which it needed to complement its existing business in Asia and the Americas, when it had to move its Hong Kong–based headquarters to London on 1 January 1993, accepting primary banking supervision by the Bank of England.

In 1997, Midland Bank underwent a total rebrand to match its parent company, with its familiar griffin logo being dropped after 32 years in favour of the HSBC &quot;hexagon&quot; symbol, albeit with the &quot;Midland Bank&quot; name placed next to it. Midland Bank was renamed HSBC Bank in June 1999, as part of the adoption of the HSBC brand throughout the Group. Prior to this, a Midland Bank branch in Croydon became the first to bear the HSBC name in the UK, albeit with &quot;Midland Bank plc&quot; still featuring on the plaque near the entrance.

The last head office of Midland Bank, opposite the Bank of England in Poultry and Princes Street, was sold in October 2006 to a tycoon from Russia, with HSBC vacating the banking hall on the ground floor and huge underground deposit vaults in 2007. In 2012 the ground floor was used in the Channel 4 game show The Bank Job. The architect John Alfred Gotch designed the building, with assistance from Sir Edwin Lutyens.

Built between 1921 and 1939, and symbol of the 1930s pride of the biggest bank in the world, the building is now The Ned Hotel City of London.

Until around 2020, the HSBC UK SWIFT code (all offices in the United Kingdom) remained &quot;MIDLGB22&quot;, reflecting its past as the Midland Bank.

==Branding==
Midland Bank was famous for its golden griffin logo, surrounded by golden coins originally introduced in 1965 on a black, then later blue background, and for its slogan &quot;the listening bank&quot;, written by the advertising executive Rod Allen. Advertisements for the bank appeared in the popular computer game &quot;Theme Park&quot;. An animated friendly version of the Griffin fronted the bank&#x27;s television advertising during the 1980s.

Midland Bank still traded as Midland Bank, but started adopting an HSBC byline by the early 1990s, started using the HSBC logo from 1997, and was finally rebranded as HSBC Bank in June 1999, as part of the adoption of the HSBC brand throughout the group. However, a dormant subsidiary, Midland Bank (Branch Nominees) Limited, continues to be registered at Companies House.

<doc id="1202032" wikidata="Q3195814" url="?curid=1202032" title="Kevin Taft">
<text>Kevin Taft (born 9 September 1955) is an author, consultant, speaker, and former provincial politician in Alberta, Canada. Prior to his election, he worked in various public policy roles (1973-2000) in the Government of Alberta, private and non-profit sectors, in the areas of health, energy, and economic policy. From 1986 to 1991 he was CEO of the ExTerra Foundation, which conducted paleontological expeditions in China&#x27;s Gobi Desert, Alberta&#x27;s badlands, and the Canadian Arctic. He is the author of five books as well as several research studies and articles on political and economic issues in Alberta. In the mid-late 1990s Dr. Taft wrote two books critical of the ruling Progressive Conservatives. The Premier of Alberta at the time (Ralph Klein) insulted Taft in the Alberta Legislature, which solidified Taft&#x27;s desire to run for office to defend his perspective on public policy. He was an Alberta Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 2001 to 2012, and Leader of the Official Opposition from 2004 to 2008. Taft is currently an author, speaker, and consultant. He is father to two adult sons and currently resides in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada with his partner Jeanette Boman.

==Education==
Taft has a B.A. in Political Science and Master&#x27;s Degree in Community Development from the University of Alberta. He received a Ph.D. (1998) in Business from the University of Warwick in England.

==Career==

===Early career===
Taft has worked as a consultant and policy analyst in both the public and private sectors. His professional career began in 1973 at the age of eighteen when Peter Lougheed&#x27;s Progressive Conservative cabinet appointed him a member of the Alberta Health Facilities Review Committee. His position on the committee involved investigating and monitoring Alberta&#x27;s hospitals and nursing homes, and reporting through the committee to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. Taft left the committee in 1982. He also worked as a planning consultant with the Alberta Hospital Association and on the Alberta government&#x27;s Nursing Home Review Panel task force from 1981 to 1982. In 1983, he became Coordinator of Planning, Research, and Evaluation for the Edmonton Region of Alberta Social Services and Community Health, where he remained until 1986.

===Work with the ExTerra Foundation===
Taft was the chief executive officer of the ExTerra Foundation from 1986 to 1991, where he oversaw a team that planned and developed the Canada-China Dinosaur Project. The project&#x27;s scientific partners were the Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology, the Canadian Museum of Nature, and the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The project was conceived and initiated by anthropologist Brian Noble and palaeontologist Philip J. Currie. Noble, who named the Foundation and lead the international team from 1983 to 1989, invited Taft to become a co-founding member of Ex Terra&#x27;s Board in 1984. The project included a multimillion-dollar series of expeditions that formed &quot;one of the biggest dinosaur hunts in history&quot;. It also included books, internationally televised films, and eventually an international touring exhibit.

The joint Canadian-Chinese expeditions went to China&#x27;s Gobi Desert, Alberta&#x27;s badlands, and the Canadian arctic. At the time, China was just beginning to open to international visitors, and the Gobi Desert expeditions were the first involving westerners since the 1930s.

The project discovered several new dinosaur species and yielded a large number of scientific papers, including a special edition of the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences.

Taft resigned from ExTerra in 1991 when it encountered financial shortfalls.

===Consulting work===
From 1991 to 2000, Taft worked as a consultant, researcher, and speaker through his firm Taft Research and Communications. His primary focuses were health care policy, energy, and economic policy.

Taft consulted extensively with the Alberta Ministry Responsible for Seniors from 1991 to 1993, an experience that prompted him to write his first book, &quot;Shredding the Public Interest&quot;, in 1997. In it, Taft challenged the provincial government&#x27;s claims that spending on public services was soaring. The book was reviewed nationally, and became a bestseller. &quot;Shredding the Public Interest&quot; placed Taft in the public eye, and cemented his reputation as a government critic. The book generated province-wide debate, attracting public criticism and avid defenders. Premier Klein publicly called Taft a communist, and suggested he should run for political office if he felt he had enough support. &quot;Shredding the Public Interest&quot; topped local bestseller charts and appeared on national bestselling charts as well. It remained on the Financial Post&#x27;s national bestseller list for 14 weeks, and was named Trade Book of the Year by the Alberta Book Publishers&#x27; Association in 1998.

In 1999, Taft co-authored a study criticizing the deregulation of Alberta&#x27;s electricity system, and in 1999 and 2000, he wrote two studies arguing against privatizing Epcor, Edmonton&#x27;s public electricity utility. In large part because of this research, Edmonton&#x27;s city council of the day eventually dropped its plans to sell Epcor in a narrow 7–6 vote. Edmonton never sold the utility, and remains Epcor&#x27;s sole shareholder.

Taft published his second book with co-author Gillian Steward, &quot;Clear Answers: The Economics and Politics of For-Profit Medicine&quot;, in 2000. In it, they argue &quot;There is overwhelming evidence that private health care hasn&#x27;t worked elsewhere and won&#x27;t work in Alberta&quot;, that private healthcare would increase costs and lengthen waiting lists, that privatization of healthcare is irreversible, and that it would allow American healthcare providers to compete with Alberta&#x27;s public system. The book also argues that the provincial government had systematically starved the public health system in order to make private healthcare a tempting alternative to the public model. The book, like its predecessor, topped local bestseller lists and appeared on national bestseller lists.

===Career in politics===

In December 2000, Taft announced he would seek the Alberta Liberal Party nomination for the next provincial election, &quot;citing his frustration with Tory policies in health care and power deregulation&quot;. He won the nomination for Edmonton-Riverview in January 2001. He was elected, defeating Progressive Conservative candidate and former city councillor Wendy Kinsella.

Three years later, in the spring of 2004, Ken Nicol resigned as leader of the Alberta Liberal Party, and Taft was soon elected to replace him. Taft was generally given credit for his tenacity in the legislature. Despite leading a party saddled with a $900,000 debt, he helped his party more than double its seats in the election from 7 before the election call to 16. The Alberta Liberals regained seats in Edmonton, and made a breakthrough in the traditionally conservative city of Calgary. Taft also saw his support in Edmonton Riverview solidify; he received more votes than all other candidates, of any party, in the 2004 election.

He published his third book, &quot;Democracy Derailed&quot; in 2007. It focussed on what he perceived as the broken state of Alberta&#x27;s democracy. The book &quot;provides plenty of examples of pettiness and arrogance&quot; from Ralph Klein&#x27;s government, and criticized the government&#x27;s record on dealing with whistle blowers. Taft described the situation as &quot;a widespread breakdown of accountability [... that&#x27;s] become part of the political culture&quot;. Taft also suggested 35 ways to fix the problem. &quot;Democracy Derailed&quot; topped local bestseller lists.

In the 2008 election, the Liberal Party won only nine seats in an election marked for its record low voter turnout. On 26 June 2008, Taft announced that he would step down as leader of the Alberta Liberal Party. He was publicly praised, and thanked for his service to the province. Taft remained as an MLA until the 2012 provincial election, when he did not seek re-election.

===Post-political career===
In January 2012, just before leaving office, Taft published &quot;Follow the Money&quot;, his fourth book. Research for the book was supported by two economists: Professor Melville Macmillan and Dr. Junaid Jahagir. Drawing heavily on economic data from Statistics Canada, the book challenges the notion that the Alberta government&#x27;s spending on public services is far higher than other provinces. Taft shows that total Alberta corporate profits are consistently double or more the rates in the rest of Canada or the United States. In contrast, spending on public services in Alberta is in the normal range, and the government has failed to increase the value of the Heritage Trust Fund. Like its predecessors, &quot;Follow the Money&quot; topped local bestseller lists. The book was also shortlisted for the Alberta Book Publishers Association Trade Non-Fiction Book of the Year in 2013.

Between 2011 and 2012, Taft, his wife Jeanette Boman and two other partners designed and constructed a three-home net-zero-ready infill residential project in Edmonton called &quot;Belgravia Green&quot;. Boman called it &quot;our one small way of saying we believe that we can make a difference as individuals.&quot; The homes are designed and built with the aim of reducing net energy use to near zero. The homes were built by Effect Home Builders, and one of them won the 2012 Canadian Home Builders&#x27; Association National Green Home Award.

Taft spent 2012-2017 as volunteer chair of a team overseeing the $1.6 million re-development of Belgravia community hall in Edmonton as a fully accessible, multi-purpose, solar powered community centre.

After his retirement from politics, Taft continues working as an author, consultant, and public speaker while volunteering substantial time in his community.

===Latest work (Oil&#x27;s Deep State)===

In 2014, Taft was invited to spend three weeks at the Whitlam Institute at Western Sydney University in Australia, to write and speak on the effects of the fossil fuel industry on democracy in the context of global warming. In September 2014, he published the paper &quot;Fossil Fuels, Global Warming and Democracy: A Report from a Scene of the Collision&quot;, in the Whitlam Institute&#x27;s &quot;Perspectives&quot; series.

Developing his ideas further, Taft published his fifth book, &quot;Oil’s Deep State: How the Petroleum Industry Undermines Democracy and Stops Action on Global Warming -- in Alberta, and in Ottawa&quot;, (James Lorimer Publishers), in September 2017. The book, written for a general audience, draws on numerous sources for a wide-ranging look at the effects of Canada&#x27;s petroleum industry on democratic institutions such as the civil service, political parties and academia. His analysis uses theories of democracy and regulatory capture to advance a theory of the &quot;deep state,&quot; arguing that the petroleum industry in Canada has captured so many democratic institutions that it has blocked the capacities of the governments of Alberta and Canada to effectively address global warming. He has toured and spoken extensively in support of his book.

<text>The Phantom Lover () is a 1995 Hong Kong musical romance drama film starring Leslie Cheung and Jacklyn Wu. It was directed by Ronny Yu and is a remake of the 1937 film &quot;Song at Midnight&quot;. 

The film itself is loosely based on real life &#x27;Phantom Lover&#x27; Dan Cheung (known as such due to the ghostlike nature of the women he romanced) and is a loose adaptation of the classic &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; romance where love between two passionate lovers were ultimately doomed when parental opposition was the major obstacle. The main theme of the film was, however, a strong adaptation of Gaston Leroux&#x27;s 1910 novel &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1940s-era China, Song Dan Ping (Leslie Cheung) was an ambitious theatre actor and owner who built his dream magnificent playhouse from where he entertained and dazzled the theatre-loving populace with his adaptation of classics such as Romeo and Juliet and other tragic love stories.

His passionate and devoted performances drew the attention of To Wan-Yin (Jacqueline Wu), the beautiful daughter of a corrupt and despotic official. To Wan-Yin would sneak out of her house with her personal maid in the night to watch Dan Ping&#x27;s play (he was acting as Romeo in Shakespeare&#x27;s play--&#x27;Romeo and Juliet&#x27;). During the patriarchal era, romance between an actor (considered useless and without a bright future) and a rich man&#x27;s daughter was definitely a taboo (it was an irony that the couple were &#x27;re-enacting&#x27; Romeo and Juliet in the movie). Hence after each performance, Dan Ping and Wan-Yin would have a rendezvous at the theatre and their love deepened to the extent that they vowed to run away from the city and to get married elsewhere.

However, Wan-Yin was betrothed to a man she did not love who was reputed to be cruel and sadistic; this persuaded her to throw caution to the wind and run away from home with Song. It also turned out that Wan-Yin&#x27;s father arranged the marriage (as was the custom of China at that time) to benefit himself as he sought to become allies with another official of great influence, whose friendship would help to improve his social standing.

As fate would have it, the eloping pair were apprehended before the scheme could be carried out, and Wan-maid, Yin&#x27;s who had helped them flee, was severely beaten until she became disabled. Wan-Yin was kept inside the house by her father in the meanwhile to stop her from eloping.

This did not end the couple&#x27;s tragic fate. Wan-Yin&#x27;s fiancé had arranged his men to harm Dan Ping. After disfiguring Dan Ping&#x27;s face with burning acid, they set the theatre ablaze with Dan Ping and many other innocent people in it. After Wan-Yin learned of the fire and Dan Ping&#x27;s disappearance, she resigned to fate and married her fiancé.

On her wedding night, Wan-Yin&#x27;s husband found out that she was not a virgin (he did not &#x27;see red&#x27; on their nuptial night). Wan-Yin was then abused and eventually drove out of the house and was forced to lead a wandering life with her crippled maid. Wan-Yin soon lost all her senses as her longing for Dan Ping drove her crazy.

Many years later, a group of performing arts students traveled from Beijing to perform in the city where Song Dan Ping had performed, eager to adapt his exploits and to improvise on his legendary performances. They came to the theatre hall, with its outer foundations still intact but with the internal sections terribly destroyed, and made their temporary quarters there. Many people believed Song to have perished in the fire but he was indeed still living as the students made their home in his theatre.

Song, however, was badly scarred in the face and was never to reveal his once-handsome face to the outside world and earned the nickname &#x27;The Phantom lover&#x27; by his once-loving audience. His personality was also changed as he was severely depressed and morose after the tragic incidents and had lived the life of a hermit ever since. When the students arrived at the theatre, he was slightly encouraged to reveal himself when one of the more talented students tried unsuccessfully to sing his ultimate love serenade whom he dedicated to Wan-Yin. Song later lashed out at the students&#x27; incompetence when he could no longer bear such disparaging performances of his efforts and decided to reveal himself and his scarred face to them.

When the officials heard that the students tried to popularise Song in their theatre performances and reenact his glorious days, they came to arrest the students. Little did they know their evil deeds were exposed to the public who came for the performances. One by one, the accomplices to the plot to burn down the theatre were forced to confess in detail, to their crimes.

Justice was finally achieved but only as a hollow victory on Song&#x27;s part. In the closing moments, Song was seen holding his lover&#x27;s hands. Wan-Yin had since become an invalid, and she had also become blind as a result of her ex-husband shooting her. She recognized Song, but lamented that she could not see him - a blessing for him, since she couldn&#x27;t see how ugly his face had become. The two lovers finally departed the town in a coach, together at last. An epilogue reveals that Wan-Yin died a year later—probably due to the shooting injuries—and that Song never loved another woman in his lifetime.

==Cast==
* Leslie Cheung as Song Danping
* Lei Huang as Wei Qing
* Philip Kwok
* Fong Pao as Zhao
* Roy Szeto as Zhao Jum
* Chien-lien Wu as Yun Yan
* Liwen Yu as Agent in 1926
Director Ronny Yu described that it was a challenge to portray Cheung in horror aesthetics while maintaining his familiar, charming image for his female fans. Yu juggled with this dilemma by often using long shots and covering only half of his face with blisters. This way he avoid disfiguration like previous remakes. Film and media studies professor Yiman Wang argues that this did not obviate but paradoxically highlights &quot;the deep-seated identity crisis that Hong Kong experiences&quot; a few years before the impending Handover of Hong Kong. The further expands, &quot;In other words, the more the filmmaker tries to maximize unproblematic entertainment, the more it hints at the underlying anxiety.&quot; This argument is furthered by the movie&#x27;s happy ending. 

==Critical reception==

Andrew Chan of the Film Critics Circle of Australia writes, &quot;&quot;The Phantom Lover&quot; could easily have been a cinematic classic, instead director Yu fails to focus the film on far more important things, namely the central doomed love affair and the rather lack of Cheung and Wu. &quot;

==Music==
The film&#x27;s theme song was composed and sung by Leslie Cheung entitled 夜半歌声 .The Phantom Lover.&#x27; The song also featured in his album 宠爱 &quot;Beloved&quot;. Another individual song popularised by this film is 一辈子失去了你 &#x27;Endless Embrace&#x27; also found in the same album. The film&#x27;s Western-influenced score was composed by Chris Babida.

Cheung&#x27;s composition and singing of the opera sets apart previous Chinese adaptations of the Phantom of the Opera. His singing was dubbed in the movie&#x27;s post-production phase.

== Awards ==
At the Hong Kong Film Award 1996, the movie won Best Art Direction, and Best Costume &amp; Make Up Design.

== Later screenings ==

* 2018: At the 6th Singapore Chinese Film Festival, the movie was screened along with others by Cheung to commemorate his 15th death anniversary.
* 2020: Hong Kong&#x27;s Mandarin Motion Pictures released a remastered version in 4K resolution in April 2020.

<text>Yun Bong-gil (; 21 June 1908 – 19 December 1932) was a Korean independence activist. His art name is Maeheon ().

He is most notable for his role in the Hongkou Park Incident, in which he set off a bomb that killed two Japanese colonial government and army officials in Shanghai&#x27;s Hongkou Park (now Lu Xun Park) in 1932. He was posthumously awarded the Republic of Korea Medal of Order of Merit for National Foundation in 1962 by the South Korean government.

Yun Bong-gil memorials were built in South Korea (Seoul and Yesan), China (Shanghai) and Japan (Kanazawa).

==Early life==
Yun Bong-gil was born in June 1908, in Yesan County, South Chungcheong Province, Korean Empire. He enrolled in Deoksan Elementary School in 1918, but the following year he dropped out after refusing colonial education. Also he studied in Ochi Seosuk (a village school that taught Korean and Chinese). As Korea had been made a protectorate within the Japanese empire in 1905, Yun grew up in a troubled country. Local resistance grew considerably with the annexation of Korea in 1910. It culminated in the March 1 Movement in 1919 that was aggressively crushed by the Japanese authorities (hundreds of protesters were massacred by the Japanese police force and army). The brutal repression that followed made many activists flee into China. In 1921, Yun began studying mathematics.

By 1926 Yun had become an independence activist, starting evening classes in his home town to help educate people from rural communities about the issues. At the age of 20, he had organized a reading club and published several pamphlets.
In 1928, he had become involved in several rural social movements, which were known as &quot;farmers&#x27; enlightenment and reading societies&quot;. Yun wrote a textbook called &quot;Farmers Readers&quot;. It was used at evening classes to teach literacy to poor young adults who could not attend school in rural areas. He also founded a group called &quot;Re-invigoration&quot; to promote the revival of farming villages. After successfully organizing a well-attended rural cultural festival in which he performed a sketch entitled &quot;The Rabbit and the Fox&quot;, he came to the attention of the &quot;Tokubetsu Kōtō Keisatsu&quot;, the Japanese Secret police in Korea tasked with investigating people and political groups that might threaten the Empire of Japan.

Despite the surveillance, Yun continued his activities and was appointed chairman of a Farmers&#x27; Association. Promoted through the Suam Sports Council to improve the health of farmers, he also created rural sports clubs because he believed that rural development and the spirit of national independence could be achieved through having a healthy mind and body. In the 1930s, Yun decided to enter the independence movement in earnest and moved to Manchuria. At first, he tried to become an independent army, but at that time, Manchuria&#x27;s independence forces were divided into several branches and suffered a period of stagnation. In response, Yun went to Shanghai, where the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea is located.

== China ==
After being briefly arrested and sent to prison, Yun fled to Manchuria. In a letter he left behind he wrote: &quot;I will not return home alive with the belief that I must die for my country and do something big&quot;. In China he met fellow activists Kim Tae-sik and Han Il-jin from the Korean independence movement.Yun headed for Shanghai, judging that he would be able to push for a successful independence movement only if he went directly to the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. He travelled alone through Dalian, south of the Liaodong Peninsula, to Qingdao, Shandong Province where he worked at a factory run by Park Jin, a Korean businessman, to save money. In August 1931, he finally arrived in Shanghai and stayed at the home of An Jung-geun in the French quarter. Yun also studied English at the Shanghai English School. He visited Kim Ku, the leader of Korea&#x27;s government-in-exile pledging to work for the independence of Korea.

The pledge he made read as follows:

==Hongkou Park Incident==
On January 28, 1932, the Japanese army launched an attack on the Chinese National Revolutionary Army&#x27;s 19th Route Army stationed in Zhabei, Shanghai. After more than a month of resistance, the Chinese forces gradually lost ground and eventually abandoned their positions in Jiangwan and Zhabei, retreating across the entire front. On March 3, after the Japanese occupied Zhenru and Nanxiang, they declared a ceasefire. Subsequently, with the mediation of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, both sides began negotiations.

During the negotiations, Japanese military and political officials in Shanghai decided to take advantage of the celebration of &quot;Tenchō Setsu&quot; (the birthday of Emperor Shōwa) on April 29 to hold a &quot;Victory Celebration of the Battle of Shanghai&quot; at Hongkou Park, Shanghai..

Against this backdrop, Chen Mingshu, the acting Premier of the Executive Yuan of the Nationalist Government and Commander of the Shanghai Defense Force, along with others, decided to carry out an assassination to disrupt the Japanese celebration. Chen approached his friend Wang Yaqiao, known as the &quot;King of Assassins,&quot; and shared this idea with him. Wang expressed his support. However, the Japanese, wary of potential threats, declared that &quot;no Chinese would be allowed to attend the victory celebration,&quot; making it difficult to act.

Wang then suggested that the exiled Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, based in Shanghai, be asked to send someone for the task. He contacted Ahn Chang-ho, the Minister of Internal Affairs of the Provisional Government, with whom he had a close relationship, and proposed the plan, offering a sum of 40,000 yuan for funding. Ahn Chang-ho subsequently met with Kim Gu, the Minister of Police of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea at the time. Kim agreed to take on the mission.

After accepting the mission, Kim Gu, learning from the failure of Lee Bong-chang&#x27;s attempt to assassinate Emperor Hirohito during the Sakuradamon Incident, meticulously prepared the explosives. At the same time, Kim approached a young Korean exile in Shanghai, Yun Bong-gil, to carry out the assassination. Yun Bong-gil, who was fluent in Japanese and resolute in his determination, immediately agreed to undertake the mission. On April 26, Yun joined the Korean Patriotic Corps and took an oath under the Korean national flag, capturing the moment in a photograph.

On 29 April 1932, Yun took a bomb disguised as a water bottle to a celebration arranged by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) in honor of Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s birthday at Hongkou Park. The bomb killed the government minister for Japanese residents in Shanghai, , and mortally wounded General Yoshinori Shirakawa, who died of his injuries on 26 May 1932. Among the seriously injured were Lieutenant General Kenkichi Ueda, the commander of the 9th Division of the Imperial Japanese Army, and Mamoru Shigemitsu, Japanese Envoy in Shanghai, who each lost a leg, and IJN Admiral Kichisaburō Nomura who lost an eye. The Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, , was seriously injured in the head and body.

Yun then tried to kill himself by detonating a second bomb disguised in a bento box. It did not explode and he was arrested at the scene.

== Sentencing and execution ==
After being convicted by a Japanese military court in Shanghai on 25 May, he was transferred to Osaka prison on 18 November. He was then moved to Kanazawa, Ishikawa: the headquarters of the IJA&#x27;s 9th Division. Yun was executed by firing squad on 19 December. His body was buried in Nodayama cemetery in Kanazawa, Japan then moved to Hyochang Park, Seoul in 1946 following Korea&#x27;s independence from Japan.

==Legacy==
The then-President of the Chinese Republic, Chiang Kai-shek of the Kuomintang government, praised Yun&#x27;s actions, stating he was &quot;a young Korean patriot who has accomplished something tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers could not do&quot;. However the future South Korean president, Syngman Rhee, disapproved of the incident and Kim Gu&#x27;s strategy of assassinations as a means to achieve independence because the Japanese could use such attacks to justify their oppression in Korea.

===Funeral and honours===

In May 1946, Korean residents in Japan exhumed Yun&#x27;s remains from Nodayama cemetery. After being transferred to Seoul, they were given Korean funeral rites and reburied in Hyochang Park.

On 1 March 1962, the South Korean government posthumously bestowed on him the Republic of Korea Cordon (the highest honor) of the Order of Merit for National Foundation.

On 27 March 1968, Chiang Kai-shek, the president of Republic of China in exile in Taiwan, wrote a prose to applaud Yun&#x27;s action at the request of Yun&#x27;s biographer, which was not revealed until 18 Dec 2013.

Yun Bong-gil Memorial Hall was built in commemoration of the 55th anniversary of his death. It is located in Yangjae Citizen&#x27;s Forest, Seocho District, Seoul Yangjaedong. Second name of Yangjae Citizen&#x27;s Forest Station is &#x27;Maeheon&#x27; which is named after his pen name.

There is also a memorial hall called the Plum Pavilion in Lu Xun Park, Shanghai where the bomb throwing incident happened.

In Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan, a monument was built on the site where Yun Bong-gil was buried after being executed by the Imperial Japanese Army.

===Modern re-evaluation===
In South Korea, discussion on whether Yun&#x27;s bombing attack in 1932 would have been considered terrorism in a modern context is a sensitive issue. In 2007, Anders Karlsson, a visiting Swedish scholar from SOAS, University of London, compared Yun Bong-gil and Kim Gu to terrorists in his lecture on Korean history. His comparison provoked strong criticism from the newspaper &quot;JoongAng Ilbo&quot;. Prof. Jeong Byeong-jun, interviewed by &quot;JoongAng Ilbo&quot;, dismissed Karlsson&#x27;s description as the &quot;view of Westerners&quot;. Later, he explained his purpose was to highlight &quot;how the implications of the &#x27;terrorism&#x27; have changed over the course of the past century&quot;. In 2013, Tessa Morris-Suzuki, an English historian and professor at Australian National University, concurred with Karlsson&#x27;s explanation and wrote in her academic article, &quot;If we accept the literal dictionary definition of the term terrorists as partisan, member of a resistance organization or guerrilla force using acts of violence then Yoo was self-evidently a terrorist.&quot;

On the other hand, at the &quot;International Research Conference in Memory of the 70th Anniversary of Yun Bong-gil &amp; Lee Bong-chang&#x27;s Patriotic Acts&quot;, held on 29 April 2002 in Shanghai, some scholars present pointed out that Yun&#x27;s patriotic acts have distinct differences from modern day terrorism, which targets civilians. Yun only attacked the Japanese top military and political officials attending the event, and no other civilians were hurt by the bombing. To protect civilians, Yun waited until all the diplomats had left the scene.

===In popular culture===
Yun is played by Lee Kang-min in the 2019 television series &quot;Different Dreams&quot;.

<text>John Angus (born March 3, 1943, in Winnipeg, Manitoba) is a businessman and former politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a city councillor in Winnipeg from 1977 to 1988, and a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 1990. He returned to the Winnipeg City Council in 1992, and continued to serve on that body until 2004.

Angus was educated at the University of Winnipeg and the Manitoba Institute of Technology. He has served as an executive member of the Winnipeg Business Development Corporation, and was for a time the vice president of Comcheq, a national Canadian company providing computerized payroll services. He now owns an international software company and a real estate firm, and holds a broker&#x27;s license.

He was elected to the Winnipeg council for St. Norbert ward (at the city&#x27;s southern tip) in 1977, and reached the office of deputy mayor in 1986. During his early years on the city council, he was associated with the now-defunct Independent Citizens&#x27; Election Committee, a right-wing organization which generally represented the interests of the city&#x27;s developers and suburban residents. In the provincial election of 1988, he was elected to the provincial legislature for St. Norbert as a Liberal, defeating incumbent Progressive Conservative Gerry Mercier by 388 votes.

The Liberals increased their parliamentary representation from one to twenty in this election, and Angus sat as a member of the official opposition for the next two years. During his time in parliament, he argued that the Public Utilities Board of Manitoba should be granted greater review powers over Manitoba Hydro.

In the provincial election of 1990, he lost to Tory candidate Marcel Laurendeau by 117 votes, amid a general decline in support of the Liberal Party.

Angus was re-elected to the city council in 1992. He supported the gradual elimination of the city&#x27;s business tax, and the immediate elimination of city taxes on arts and amusement. He entered the race for Mayor of Winnipeg in 1998, but withdrew before election day. Reg Alcock, then the federal MP for Winnipeg South, endorsed Angus in 2002.

On January 12, 2004, Angus resigned from the city&#x27;s Executive Policy Committee, one of the most important bodies in the city&#x27;s governing structure.

In 2008 Winnipeg named a major street in the Waverley West neighbourhood in his honour.

<text>To Your Scattered Bodies Go (1971) is a science fiction novel by American writer Philip José Farmer, the first book in the Riverworld series. It won a Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1972 at the 30th Worldcon. The title is derived from the 7th of the &quot;Holy Sonnets&quot; by English poet John Donne:
==Plot==
British adventurer Richard Francis Burton dies on Earth and is revived in mid-air in a vast dark room filled with human bodies, some only half-formed. There, he is confronted by men in a flying vehicle who then blast him with a weapon.

He next awakes upon the shores of a mysterious river, naked and hairless. All around him are other people in a similar situation. Shortly after they awaken, a nearby structure, nicknamed a &quot;grailstone,&quot; causes food and other supplies to appear in the &quot;grails&quot; bound to each individual. Burton quickly attracts a group of companions: the neanderthal Kazzintuitruaabemss (nicknamed Kazz), the science fiction author Peter Jairus Frigate, and Alice Liddell. Among these is the extraterrestrial Monat Grrautut, earlier part of a small group of beings from Tau Ceti who had arrived on Earth in the early 21st century. When one of their number was accidentally killed by humans, their spaceship automatically killed most of the people on Earth. Frigate and others alive at the time confirm Monat&#x27;s story. Retreating into the nearby woods for safety, Burton&#x27;s party chew gum provided by their grails, and discover that this gum is a powerful hallucinogen. As days and weeks pass, people&#x27;s physical wants are provided for by the grails, which eventually produce a set of cloths used for clothing. Rumors reach Burton&#x27;s region that the river continues seemingly forever. One night, Burton is visited by a mysterious cloaked figure, whom Burton dubs &quot;The Mysterious Stranger&quot;, who explains that he is one of the beings who has constructed this world and resurrected humanity on its shores, and tells Burton to approach the headwaters of the river.

After setting off, Burton&#x27;s group encounters many adventures, but are enslaved by a riverbank kingdom run by Tullus Hostilius and Hermann Göring, against whom Burton leads a successful revolt. Göring himself is killed by Alice. After the revolt, Burton is part of the nation&#x27;s ruling council. Later, the protagonists discover a person among them who they conclude is an agent of the beings who created this world. Before the man can be questioned, he dies of no apparent cause. An autopsy reveals a small device planted in the man&#x27;s brain which apparently allowed him to kill himself at will. Burton is visited by the Mysterious Stranger and is warned that the beings who created this world, whom the Stranger refers to as &quot;Ethicals&quot;, are close to capturing Burton. Desperate to escape, Burton kills himself to be resurrected elsewhere in the river valley, and continues thus to explore it. He often finds himself resurrected near Hermann Göring, who undergoes a moral and religious conversion and joins the pacifist Church of the Second Chance. After many resurrections, Burton finds himself resurrected not in the river but in the Dark Tower at the headwaters, and is interrogated by a council of Ethicals to discover the identity of Burton&#x27;s &quot;Mysterious Stranger&quot;. After fruitlessly questioning him, the Ethicals inform him that they will return him to the river valley, remembering nothing of themselves, and restore him to his friends, but the Mysterious Stranger prevents them from removing his memory and Burton resolves to continue pursuing the truth about the Ethicals and their intentions for the Riverworld.

==Publication history==
This novel, and the Riverworld series itself, is based on Farmer&#x27;s earlier, unpublished novel &quot;Owe for the Flesh&quot;. It was originally serialized as two separate novellas: &quot;The Day of the Great Shout&quot;, which appeared in the January 1965 issue of &quot;Worlds of Tomorrow&quot;, and &quot;The Suicide Express&quot;, which appeared in the March 1966 issue of &quot;Worlds of Tomorrow.&quot;

<text>Madder Mortem is a Norwegian progressive metal band. They were originally formed by siblings Agnete and BP M. Kirkevaag in 1993 as a doom metal/gothic metal band as Mystery Tribe, but changed the name to Madder Mortem in 1997.

The group released their first full-length album, &quot;Mercury&quot;, in 1999, but the band&#x27;s label folded soon after its release, and all members except the Kirkevaags left. A new lineup recorded the &quot;All Flesh Is Grass&quot; album for a new label, Century Media, in 2001, and &quot;Deadlands&quot; followed on The End Records in 2002, after which further lineup changes ensued. On 21 July 2014 the band announced the addition of a new guitar player, Richard Wikstrand, formerly of Chrome Division.

&quot;Red In Tooth And Claw&quot;, their sixth full-length album, was released on 28 October 2016 via Dark Essence Records. The band followed with the worldwide release of &quot;Marrow&quot; on 21 September 2018. The release of &quot;Marrow&quot; also coincided with another lineup change, with guitarist Richard Wikstrand being replaced by Anders Langberg, known from Souls Of Tide. The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Old Eyes, New Heart&quot;, was released on Dark Essence Records 26 January 2024.

== Live performances ==
In September/October 2001, Madder Mortem supported Tristania, Rotting Christ, and Vintersorg on a 23-date European tour. During February and March 2003 Madder Mortem supported Opeth on the European leg of their &quot;Deliverance&quot; tour. In addition to various cities across Western Europe, the Opeth tour also brought them to the UK for the first time, with a total of 33 gigs.

They have played festivals including Brutal Assault in the Czech Republic, Popkomm in Germany, Yuletide Metal Meeting in Northern Ireland, and Conmusic in Mexico; as well as the Norwegian festivals Transistorfestivalen, Southern Discomfort, Inferno Metal Festival, and Quart Festival.

With guitarist Richard Wilkstrand, Madder Mortem performed at the festival Livestock at Alvdal in rural Norway on 11 July 2014. In 2017, the band supported the Soen European Lykaia tour.

<text>Joe&#x27;s Comics is an American comic book imprint of Image Comics run by J. Michael Straczynski&#x27;s Studio JMS and was originally published as an imprint of Top Cow Productions. As of 2014, key titles in the current line include &quot;Dream Police&quot;, &quot;The Book of Lost Souls&quot;, &quot;Ten Grand&quot;, &quot;Protectors Inc&quot;, and &quot;Sidekick&quot;.

==History==

===Top Cow (1998–early 2000s)===
In 1998, Joe’s Comics was established as an imprint publishing Straczynski&#x27;s comic work including the critically lauded &quot;Midnight Nation&quot; with artist Gary Frank, &quot;Rising Stars&quot;, and &quot;Delicate Creatures&quot;, an illustrated fantasy parable.

Straczynski had a falling-out with Top Cow over movie scripts for &quot;Rising Stars&quot; in the mid-2000s, and after communication broke down their relationship came to a stand-still. Straczynski held back the final (already written) issues of &quot;Rising Stars&quot; until Straczynski and Top Cow finally came to an agreement after a nearly two-year hiatus. Straczynski subsequently took &quot;Dream Police&quot; to Marvel Comics&#x27;s Icon imprint, which also published his &quot;The Book of Lost Souls&quot;. Several &quot;Rising Stars&quot; spin-offs not written by Straczynski were published under Joe&#x27;s Comics through 2005.

===Image (2012–present)===
The imprint was dormant until Straczynski announced at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con that he was reviving it as part of his new media company, Studio JMS. The first title, the horror-noir &quot;Ten Grand&quot;, initially illustrated by Ben Templesmith came out in May 2013 and &quot;Sidekick&quot; came out in July. Further titles written by Straczynski and published by Joe&#x27;s Comics in 2014 include &quot;Protectors Inc&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Apocalypse Al&quot; (originally produced for MTV Comics), &quot;Alone&quot;, and the return of former Icon titles &quot;Dream Police&quot; and &quot;The Book of Lost Souls&quot; (both scheduled for 2014).

<doc id="1202066" wikidata="Q971280" url="?curid=1202066" title="The Fabulous Riverboat">
<text>The Fabulous Riverboat is a science fiction novel by American writer Philip José Farmer, the second book in the Riverworld series.

A shorter version of the novel was serialized in &quot;If&quot; magazine as &quot;The Felled Star&quot; (July and August 1967) and &quot;The Fabulous Riverboat&quot; (June and August 1971).

==Overview== 
Departing from the exploits of Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton in the first Riverworld novel, &quot;To Your Scattered Bodies Go&quot;, &quot;The Fabulous Riverboat&quot; follows the efforts of Samuel Clemens to find a way to build a riverboat on the metal-poor Riverworld. In the process, he confronts a tenth-century Viking, makes friends with a member of another hominid species and forms an uneasy alliance with King John Lackland.

==Plot summary==
Twenty years after humanity was resurrected on Riverworld, Sam Clemens is traveling with the crew of a Viking longboat, captained by Eric Bloodaxe, who is notable for having an axe made of metal. On the metal-poor Riverworld, where even a few ounces of metal is a treasure, this is a rarity. Clemens and Bloodaxe have allied in order to find the source of this metal. Clemens is accompanied on his quest by a gigantic prehistoric hominid whom he has named Joe Miller. Miller, despite being very cordial, and talking with a lisp, is a fearsome warrior because of his size, and protects Clemens from Bloodaxe&#x27;s crew. Clemens is also motivated in his quest by his desire to be reunited with his terrestrial wife, Livy.

Unknown to the others, Clemens had been contacted by a mysterious being whom he named X. X claimed to be a member of the beings who were responsible for resurrection, although he disagreed with their goals. He was aware of Clemens&#x27;s desire to build a metal riverboat, and assured the author that the metal needed to realise this dream could be found upriver. X manages to send a nickel-iron meteorite crashing into Riverwold, not far from Clemens. Clemens and his crew manage to survive the resulting tidal wave that kills nearly everyone in the vicinity. Sadly, Clemens discovers Livy is one of the dead when her body washes up on deck. She had been in the area but will now be resurrected thousands of miles from him.

In the wake of the tidal wave all the survivors in the region are put to sleep by a strange fog, and awake to discover the valley has been restored to a pristine condition. Clemens realizes that the meteor likely contains a source of metal and the crew sets out to look for it. They are soon joined by German aviator Lothar von Richthofen, a World War One ace and brother of the famous Red Baron. Lothar becomes a trusted ally of Clemens and an additional ally against Bloodaxe.

When the crew reaches the area where the meteor fell, they find a new group of resurrectees who have formed a nascent kingdom. The crew quickly kill the leaders and assume control of the region for themselves. They begin mining the metal from the meteorite. However, Clemens does not trust Bloodaxe, and has his co-leader assassinated.

As more metal is exhumed from the ground the technology level of the area begins to rise, including the reintroduction of firearms. While the meteorite is rich in nickel and iron Clemens needs other materials to manufacture modern conveniences. To get these resources he must trade much of his metal to neighboring kingdoms. Many of these kingdoms eye his own kingdom jealously and Clemens is constantly on guard lest he be invaded and his precious mine taken from him. Of particular concern is a neighboring kingdom led by the English King John Lackland. Eventually King John and another kingdom join forces to invade Clemens&#x27;s land. However, Clemens makes a deal with King John to unite their lands. John betrays his one-time ally and forms the nation of Parolando with Clemens.

As production begins on the boat, Clemens receives a rude shock when his wife arrives in the company of Cyrano de Bergerac. In the intervening years Livy has become Cyrano&#x27;s lover. When the Frenchman, who is noted as one of the best swordsmen in the world, had heard of a kingdom with metal, he became obsessed with traveling there in order to obtain a proper sword. Despite his discomfort with the situation, Clemens quickly warms to Cyrano, and the Frenchman becomes part of Clemens&#x27; inner circle.

The protagonists meet a later time American astronaut Firebrass, who claims to have visited the Moon, Mars, Ganymede, and orbited Jupiter.

Diplomatic problems continue for Parolando, most notably with nearby &quot;Soul City&quot;, a kingdom founded by a black nationalist. Demanding ever increasing payments for its resources, Soul City eventually attacks Parolando, almost conquering the nation until agents of John Lackland dynamite a dam, sending a wave of water to sweep the invading enemies into the river.

Despite such setbacks, Clemens builds his riverboat, a side paddle wheeler which is named the &quot;Not for Hire&quot;. However, on the day of its christening, King John betrays Clemens and steals the ship. As the boat steams away, Clemens vows to build an even bigger and better boat and to exact revenge on King John.

==Reception==
Lester del Rey found the novel to be &quot;a major piece of fiction. . . . Farmer pursuing one of his private delights to its ultimate end.&quot;

<text>The N3 Eastern Bypass is a section of the Johannesburg Ring Road that forms a beltway around the city of Johannesburg, South Africa, as part of the N3. The first section of the freeway opened in 1971, from Buccleuch to the interchange with Main Reef Road in Germiston. This is one reason why Germiston is listed as the southbound destination of this route, from the Buccleuch to Geldenhuys Interchanges, rather than to the Elands Interchange south of Germiston. The remaining section from Main Reed Road to Black Reef Road (Rand Airport Road), which included the construction of the Geldenhuys Interchange, was opened in 1977, linking the Eastern Bypass with the N3 freeway to Heidelberg. The interchange at Main Reef Road was removed and Main Reef Road is now an overbridge.

Much of the highway forms a border between Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni. From the south, the Eastern Bypass begins at the Elands Interchange, where it merges with the N12 Southern Bypass. It ends at the Buccleuch Interchange, where it merges with the N1 Western Bypass and M1 freeways. Other exits include M46 Rand Airport Road (southbound only), M2 motorway Johannesburg/Germiston (Geldenhuys Interchange), M52 Van Buuren Road, R24 OR Tambo Int&#x27;l Airport / N12 eMalahleni (George Bizos Interchange), M16 Linksfield Road, R25 Modderfontein Road, M54 London Road, and M60 Marlboro Road.

The entire Eastern Bypass was part of the Gauteng e-Toll Project and had open road tolling from 3 December 2013 up until e-tolls were discontinued in Gauteng on 12 April 2024.

<text>Daniel (; before 1492 – May 22, 1547) was Metropolitan of Moscow and all Rus&#x27;, the primate of the Russian Orthodox Church, from 1522 to 1539. He was the eighth metropolitan in Moscow to be appointed without the approval of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople as had been the norm.

He represented the belligerent ecclesiastic circle that was interested in alliance with the princely authority.

==Biography==
Daniel was a monk at Joseph-Volokolamsk Monastery and a student of Joseph Volotsky. In 1515, he was elected hegumen of the monastery, which had been under the patronage of Vasili III. When Daniel became metropolitan, he assisted Vasili III in summoning the Vasili Shemyachich, the prince of Seversk, to Moscow and imprisoning him. In 1525, bypassing the ecclesiastic canons, Daniel sanctioned the divorce between Vasili III and his childless wife Solomonia Saburova, which caused general discontent in Muscovy.

Daniel was the initiator of a number of church councils (&quot;sobory&quot;) between 1525 and 1531, which condemned the opponents of the Josephinians - Maximus the Greek and Vassian Patrikeyev. While on his deathbed, Vasili III asked Daniel to take care of his wife and son. The metropolitan solemnly blessed Ivan IV in the Cathedral of the Dormition.

During the struggle between the Shuisky family and prince Ivan Belsky in 1538, Daniel supported the latter, for which he would be defrocked a year later by the Shuiskys. He died on May 22, 1547, in the Joseph-Volokolamsk Monastery, where he was incarcerated.

Daniel was the author of a number of works, condemning heretics in Russia. Some historians believe that he was one of the compilers of the &quot;Nikon Chronicle&quot;.

<doc id="1202074" wikidata="Q5891833" url="?curid=1202074" title="Homotopy sphere">
<text>In algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics, a homotopy sphere is an &quot;n&quot;-manifold that is homotopy equivalent to the &quot;n&quot;-sphere. It thus has the same homotopy groups and the same homology groups as the &quot;n&quot;-sphere, and so every homotopy sphere is necessarily a homology sphere.

The topological generalized Poincaré conjecture is that any &quot;n&quot;-dimensional homotopy sphere is homeomorphic to the &quot;n&quot;-sphere; it was solved by Stephen Smale in dimensions five and higher, by Michael Freedman in dimension 4, and for dimension 3 (the original Poincaré conjecture) by Grigori Perelman in 2005.

The resolution of the smooth Poincaré conjecture in dimensions 5 and larger implies that homotopy spheres in those dimensions are precisely exotic spheres. It is open whether non-trivial smooth homotopy spheres exist in dimension 4.

Homotopy spheres form an abelian group known as Kervaire–Milnor group. Its composition is the connected sum and its neutral element is the sphere, while inversion is given by opposite orientation.

<doc id="1202087" wikidata="Q3063449" url="?curid=1202087" title="The Dark Design">
<text>The Dark Design (1977) is a science fiction novel by American writer Philip José Farmer, the third in the series of Riverworld books. The title is derived from lines in Sir Richard Francis Burton&#x27;s poem &quot;The Kasîdah of Hâjî Abdû El-Yezdî&quot;:
==Plot==
The plot, set 30 years after humanity&#x27;s resurrection, consists of three distinct plot lines, which come together towards the conclusion.

In the first plot line, Richard Burton and his friends continue their journey up river. On their journey they encounter a group of ancient Egyptians who tell them of a mission which their Pharaoh had undertaken to reach the source of the River. Accompanied by the Titanthrop Joe Miller, who they believed to be an avatar of Thoth, they scaled the mountains at the River&#x27;s headwaters and descended into a polar sea, with a large black tower in the center. On the shores they found a cave with supplies and boat. One of their number died there, bringing the story back to the Valley. Burton also discovers that his group has been infiltrated by traitors. Through hypnosis, the Neanderthal Kaz identifies Monat and Pete Frigate as agents of the alien creators of the Riverworld. When Burton goes to confront them he discovers that they have disappeared.

The second plot line deals with the real Peter Jairus Frigate, who is unaware that someone has been impersonating him (actually his deceased brother who died in infancy). One day, a ship docks near his home and Frigate recognizes its captains as two of his childhood heroes, Tom Mix and Jack London. He signs on to the crew, joining the Sufi mystic Nur-ed-Din and the African warrior Umslopogas. For years he travels with them without revealing that he knows Mix and London&#x27;s identities. When he finally confronts the men, they reveal that they had been recruited by the Mysterious Stranger to find the source of the River. Eventually they come upon the metal rich nation of New Bohemia and Frigate suggests they build a balloon to reach the pole faster. However, soon after launch their balloon is destroyed after an encounter with another airship.

In the third plot line, the nation of Parolando, now under the rule of President Milton Firebrass, is building an airship, which will allow them to reach the pole faster than Clemens&#x27; steamboat. Cyrano de Bergerac has opted to stay behind to help with the project and proves to be a competent pilot. Training is overseen by new arrival Jill Gulbirra, an Australian dirigible pilot and strident feminist. The airship launches and rapidly makes the journey to the pole, where they discover the sea and the dark tower described by the Egyptians. Firebrass and several others abruptly board a helicopter to fly down to the tower, but it explodes, killing them. Engineer Barry Thorn is jailed after it is discovered that he planted a bomb on the helicopter. The crew discover a doorway on the roof of the tower, but all attempts to enter it are stymied by an invisible force field. Japanese Sufi Piscator is able to make it farther than anyone and disappears into the tower. After he does not return, Jill Gulbirra decides to cut their losses and return home. On the way back, they are persuaded by Clemens to mount an attack on King John&#x27;s steamship. Cyrano leads the attack, which nearly succeeds in kidnapping John, but the king escapes. In the confusion, Barry Thorn escapes and parachutes from the airship, which explodes behind him.

* During the third plot line, it is revealed that Firebrass knew the alien from Arcturus and the death of most of humanity in the year 2003 AD.

<doc id="1202095" wikidata="Q8016585" url="?curid=1202095" title="Ark Alexandra Academy">
<text>Ark Alexandra, previously known as Hastings Grammar School, William Parker School, William Parker Sports College, and later as Ark William Parker is a secondary school in Hastings, East Sussex in the United Kingdom. It was the only male single-sex secondary school in East Sussex. It is now a co-educational Academy spread over two sites following the merger of Ark Helenswood Academy and Ark William Parker on 1 September 2019.

==History==
In 1619 The Rev. William Parker, Rector of All Saints Church, Hastings died, leaving a will which said:
:&quot;I give unto the Mayor, Jurates and Comynaltye of Hastings and to their successors for ever towards the maynteynance of a Religious and godlie Schoolemaster in the sayd towne w&#x27;ch shall instructe and teach the youthe of the Inhabitants of Hastings in learninge, manners and other vertuous education to gette their livinge. To which sayd use I give all my land in the parishe of Oer.&quot; 
This is taken as the foundation of the school, although Parker&#x27;s will also stated that his widow should enjoy the income from all his property until her death, so no money was available to appoint the first master until twenty years later. The will stipulated that the master should be chosen by the jurates (town councillors) living within the parish of All Saints, rather than by the town council as a whole, and by any heir of William Parker still living in Hastings.

Parker&#x27;s nephew William became Mayor of Hastings, and his nephew&#x27;s son (also William) later became master of the school. Titus Oates, son of the rector of All Saints, Samuel Oates, and later infamous for fabricating the notorious Popish Plot, started his career by bringing false charges against both William Parkers in an attempt to create a vacancy for the post of master. Records of early masters are incomplete, but in 1759 John Shorter was appointed master, once again by another William Parker, mayor elect.

In 1708 a Kentish landowner by the name of James Saunders made various charitable legacies in his will, including provisions for a schoolmaster in Rye and a schoolmaster and two school mistresses in Hastings. One of the mistresses was to teach 30 pupils in the parish of All Saints and the other in the parish of St Clements, at a salary of £10 per year. The master was to teach reading, writing, Latin, accounting, mathematics and navigation to any poor child in Hastings &quot;from the Seagate next the Fish Market&quot;, at a salary of £40 per year, subject to a maximum of 70 pupils. Saunders stipulated that the corporation of each of the towns concerned should oversee the way the other operated their school, with the penalty for failing to comply with the terms of the bequest that all the funds should go to the other town.
Falling income from the two charities meant that by 1809 one master, Joseph Hannay, was employed to teach forty boys on behalf of the Parker school, and fifteen for the Saunders school. The Saunders fund continued to pay two schoolmistresses ten pounds each per year, while the master received three pounds per child. Local complaints about the low rents being charged by the corporation for the Parker fund lands had led to increases from £49 in 1787 to £134 in 1809, but the council also turned down an offer from one James Halloway to rent the estate for £205. Thomas Breeds, another prominent local man, applied to the High Court of Chancery arguing that the funds were being improperly administered, with the result that he himself rented them for £210, no higher bid being received at a public auction. The expenses of the case were paid by the funds, with the result that the Saunders school had to close for five years, but afterwards two separate masters were appointed.

The two were permanently re-merged in 1878, together with part of the Magdalen trust, to form the &quot;Hastings Grammar School Foundation&quot;. A Victorian Gothic Revival building was constructed by John Howell &amp; Son to the design of Jeffery &amp; Skiller on a slope overlooking Hastings, at Standen&#x27;s High Field which became Nelson road, and occupied in July 1883. The school was originally designed as a central tower with wings either side. Owing to lack of funds, the wing intended as accommodation for the headmaster and boarders was never built.

In July 2024, a bus driver hired by the school was annoyed by the behaviour of children on his bus, and he broke into using abusive languages towards the children. 

===Modern educational reforms===
Following the Education Act 1902, the school began to receive a grant from the British Government. Under the Education Act 1944, secondary schools in England were reorganised in three categories: grammar schools, technical schools, and secondary modern schools. The school was naturally classed as a grammar school under this scheme, and had voluntary aided status: in other words the income from the Foundation was supplemented by a grant from the Local Education Authority. From now on, admission to the school was solely via the eleven-plus examination, and education was free (previously there had been fees of five guineas a year). Classes were held six days a week, with no lessons on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons. Saturday morning school was abolished in 1967.

===Voluntary controlled status===
In 1959 the school governors decided to change the status of the school from voluntary aided to voluntary controlled. The school was now controlled by a board of ten governors appointed by the borough of Hastings and five appointed by the charitable foundation. The charitable funds remained under the control of the foundation governors, but responsibility for providing buildings now fell to the education authority. A new modern building was constructed further from the town centre, on of land which had long been used as the school&#x27;s playing fields. The new school was designed for 570 boys, including a sixth form of 120, and is now the Parkstone Road half of the school. The foundation stone of the new school was laid on 4 July 1962, and the school occupied in 1964.

===Comprehensive school===
The incoming Labour government of 1965 introduced a change in national education policy intended to phase out grammar school education and replace it with comprehensive education. This was resisted by the borough of Hastings, but local government reorganisation under the following Conservative administration meant that the autonomous county borough was abolished and replaced by East Sussex County Council (ESCC) as the education authority. A decision was taken by ESCC to change to a comprehensive school system, and at the same time to merge the school with Hastings Secondary School for Boys (HSSB) known locally as &quot;Priory Road&quot;. 

A further new building was constructed on the same site, but reached by a separate road entrance in Park Avenue. The school was renamed &quot;The William Parker School&quot; and had its first comprehensive system intake in 1978. This first year of comprehensive students were temporarily taught in the former Hastings Secondary School for Boys site located in Priory Road, with occasional lessons held at the former grammar school site while the new building was being completed, and moved across to the new location for 1979 start of the school year.

===College===
In 1998, the school achieved specialist Sports College status, following the new opening of an athletics arena.

Towards 2000 the Alan Booth Jones Cricket centre opened, which featured indoor cricket and other sports facilities used both by the school and externally.

In 2006, the school re-instated the roles of Head Boy, Deputy Head Boy and Prefects for the Year 7-11 year group. They were chosen from Year 11 and distinguished from the rest of the year group by their tie, which was dark blue with the school crest.

In 2013, William Parker Sports College was graded Inadequate by Ofsted and Her Majesty&#x27;s Chief Inspector of Education, Children&#x27;s Care and Skills placed the college into Special Measures. As a result, the Secretary of State issued an academy order in accordance with Section 44 of the Education Act 2005.

===Academy===
In 2013, the governing body applied with Ark to become an academy. On 1 September 2013, ARK William Parker opened, replacing William Parker Sports College, with a capacity of 1400 including a sixth form of 200 places.

The school shared a sixth form with Ark Helenswood which at its latest inspection was graded Good and shares the highest results, for progress, in East Sussex.

After becoming an Ark academy, the school received two Section 5 Ofsted inspections each grading the school Requires Improvement and despite encouraging signs of improvement, it was plagued by a falling roll, budget deficits and high staff turnover. From its inception as an academy in 2013 to its merger in 2019, the academy had been led by four Principals. Daniel Hatley served as the second principal of Ark William Parker, however, he had been appointed as the principal by East Sussex County Council of William Parker Sports College prior to the school&#x27;s conversion into a Sponsored Academy. He later became the Associate Principal and, finally, the Principal again of Ark WIlliam Parker.

In 2017, Ofsted praised the &#x27;School leaders, governors and members of the academy trust&#x27; for &#x27;focusing on the right things&#x27; leading to &#x27;already encouraging signs of improvement.&#x27; However, the academy still maintained its Requires Improvement judgement.

While the final results of Ark William Parker moved in line with the national average (2018–19), the school had continually performed below the government&#x27;s floor standards. Attendance, however, had improved by 2018 to the joint highest in East Sussex.

In 2018-19, Ark William Parker achieved the second highest results in Hastings with an average Progress 8 score finishing above the largest academies in Hastings, The St Leonards Academy and The Hastings Academy.

=== Ark Alexandra ===
After continual budget deficits, Ark took the contentious decision to bring Ark Helenswood and Ark William Parker together as one school on two sites.

The Helenswood campus would house KS3, years 7-8 and the William Parker campus years 9-13 which includes the sixth form. The Minister approved this proposed merger on 19 December 2018 and on 1 September 2019, Ark Helenswood closed and merged with Ark William Parker. Ark Alexandra assumed the legal identity of Ark William Parker with an expanded &quot;co-educational&quot; capacity of 2100 students across two sites and it opened on 1 September 2019.

The Principal and Executive Principal of Ark William Parker assumed their same roles at Ark Alexandra Academy and they are assisted by an Associate Regional Principal and a Regional Director.

In January 2020, the Principal, Stephanie Newman, announced she was stepping back. She was appointed in 2017 as the Acting Principal which makes her the longest serving Principal of Ark William Parker.

==Campus==
After Ark Helenswood merged into Ark William Parker to become Ark Alexandra, the academy now educates students across two sites: the Helenswood (Lower) Campus and the William Parker (Upper) Campus. Below are the details of the William Parker Campus:

==Sports, clubs, and traditions==
=== William Parker ===
Apart from football and cricket, many other sports are played like Rugby, Badminton and Basketball.

William Parker was divided into three houses for sporting events and for students to wear during PE lessons.
Houses haven&#x27;t been decided yet

The house system was incorporated into the pastoral system for 2017-18 and 2018–19, and as a result, there were three Heads of Houses with responsibility for charity fundraising and house events as well as, the behaviour, attendance and tutor activities of students in their house.

=== Ark Alexandra Academy ===
Ark Alexandra maintains William Parker&#x27;s Church of England distinctiveness and aims to preserve and build on the legacy of both William Parker and Helenswood. It has five houses including two from William Parker, however, the house system has yet to be embedded into the academy fully. The school has three values: Faith, Excellence and Kindness.

The Voigt profile (named after Woldemar Voigt) is a probability distribution given by a convolution of a Cauchy-Lorentz distribution and a Gaussian distribution. It is often used in analyzing data from spectroscopy or diffraction.

==Definition==
Without loss of generality, we can consider only centered profiles, which peak at zero. The Voigt profile is then 
:formula_4

where &quot;x&quot; is the shift from the line center, formula_5 is the centered Gaussian profile:

:formula_6

and formula_7 is the centered Lorentzian profile:

:formula_8

The defining integral can be evaluated as:

:formula_9

where Re[&quot;w&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)] is the real part of the Faddeeva function evaluated for
:formula_10

In the limiting cases of formula_11 and formula_12 then formula_13 simplifies to formula_7 and formula_5, respectively.

==History and applications==
In spectroscopy, a Voigt profile results from the convolution of two broadening mechanisms, one of which alone would produce a Gaussian profile (usually, as a result of the Doppler broadening), and the other would produce a Lorentzian profile. Voigt profiles are common in many branches of spectroscopy and diffraction. Due to the expense of computing the Faddeeva function, the Voigt profile is sometimes approximated using a pseudo-Voigt profile.

==Properties==
The Voigt profile is normalized:
:formula_16
since it is a convolution of normalized profiles. The Lorentzian profile has no moments (other than the zeroth), and so the moment-generating function for the Cauchy distribution is not defined. It follows that the Voigt profile will not have a moment-generating function either, but the characteristic function for the Cauchy distribution is well defined, as is the characteristic function for the normal distribution. The characteristic function for the (centered) Voigt profile will then be the product of the two:

:formula_17

Since normal distributions and Cauchy distributions are stable distributions, they are each closed under convolution (up to change of scale), and it follows that the Voigt distributions are also closed under convolution.

=== Cumulative distribution function ===
Using the above definition for &quot;z&quot; , the cumulative distribution function (CDF) can be found as follows:

:formula_18

Substituting the definition of the Faddeeva function (scaled complex error function) yields for the indefinite integral:

:formula_19

which may be solved to yield

:formula_20

where formula_21 is a hypergeometric function. In order for the function to approach zero as &quot;x&quot; approaches negative infinity (as the CDF must do), an integration constant of 1/2 must be added. This gives for the CDF of Voigt:

:formula_22

=== The uncentered Voigt profile ===
If the Gaussian profile is centered at formula_23 and the Lorentzian profile is centered at formula_24, the convolution is centered at formula_25 and the characteristic function is:

:formula_26

The probability density function is simply offset from the centered profile by formula_27:

:formula_28

where:

:formula_29

The mode and median are both located at formula_27.

=== Derivatives ===

Using the definition above for formula_31 and formula_32, the first and second derivatives can be expressed in terms of the Faddeeva function as
:formula_33
and
:formula_34
respectively.

Often, one or multiple Voigt profiles and/or their respective derivatives need to be fitted to a measured signal by means of non-linear least squares, e.g., in spectroscopy. Then, further partial derivatives can be utilised to accelerate computations. Instead of approximating the Jacobian matrix with respect to the parameters formula_35, formula_36, and formula_37 with the aid of finite differences, the corresponding analytical expressions can be applied. With formula_38 and formula_39, these are given by:

: formula_40
: formula_41
: formula_42

for the original voigt profile formula_43;

: formula_44
: formula_45
: formula_46

for the first order partial derivative formula_47; and

: formula_48
: formula_49
: formula_50

for the second order partial derivative formula_51. Since formula_35 and formula_37 play a relatively similar role in the calculation of formula_31, their respective partial derivatives also look quite similar in terms of their structure, although they result in totally different derivative profiles. Indeed, the partial derivatives with respect to formula_36 and formula_37 show more similarity since both are width parameters. All these derivatives involve only simple operations (multiplications and additions) because the computationally expensive formula_57 and formula_58 are readily obtained when computing formula_59. Such a reuse of previous calculations allows for a derivation at minimum costs. This is not the case for finite difference gradient approximation as it requires the evaluation of formula_59 for each gradient respectively.

==Voigt functions==
The Voigt functions &quot;U&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, and &quot;H&quot; (sometimes called the line broadening function) are defined by
:formula_61
:formula_62
where 
:formula_63
erfc is the complementary error function, and &quot;w&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is the Faddeeva function.

=== Relation to Voigt profile ===
:formula_64
with Gaussian sigma relative variables formula_65
and formula_66

== Numeric approximations ==
=== Tepper-García Function ===
The Tepper-García function, named after Mexican-born, German-Australian Astrophysicist Thor Tepper-García, is a combination of an exponential function and rational functions that approximates the line broadening function formula_67 over a wide range of its parameters.
It is obtained from a truncated power series expansion of the exact line broadening function.

In its most computationally efficient form, the Tepper-García function can be expressed as
:formula_68
where formula_69, formula_70, and formula_71.

Thus the line broadening function can be viewed, to first order, as a pure Gaussian function plus a correction factor that depends linearly on the microscopic properties of the absorbing medium (encoded in formula_72); however, as a result of the early truncation in the series expansion, the error in the approximation is still of order formula_72, i.e. formula_74. This approximation has a relative accuracy of
:formula_75
over the full wavelength range of formula_67, provided that formula_77.
In addition to its high accuracy, the function formula_78 is easy to implement as well as computationally fast. It is widely used in the field of quasar absorption line analysis.

=== Pseudo-Voigt approximation ===
The pseudo-Voigt profile (or pseudo-Voigt function) is an approximation of the Voigt profile &quot;V&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) using a linear combination of a Gaussian curve &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and a Lorentzian curve &quot;L&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) instead of their convolution.

The pseudo-Voigt function is often used for calculations of experimental spectral line shapes.

The mathematical definition of the normalized pseudo-Voigt profile is given by
:formula_79 with formula_80. 
formula_81 is a function of full width at half maximum (FWHM) parameter.

There are several possible choices for the formula_81 parameter. A simple formula, accurate to 1%, is

:formula_83
where now, formula_81 is a function of Lorentz (formula_85), Gaussian (formula_86) and total (formula_87) Full width at half maximum (FWHM) parameters. The total FWHM (formula_87) parameter is described by:
:formula_89

=== The width of the Voigt profile ===
The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Voigt profile can be found from the
widths of the associated Gaussian and Lorentzian widths. The FWHM of the Gaussian profile 
is

:formula_90

The FWHM of the Lorentzian profile is

:formula_91

An approximate relation (accurate to within about 1.2%) between the widths of the Voigt, Gaussian, and Lorentzian profiles is:

:formula_92

By construction, this expression is exact for a pure Gaussian or Lorentzian.

A better approximation with an accuracy of 0.02% is given by (originally found by Kielkopf)

:formula_93

Again, this expression is exact for a pure Gaussian or Lorentzian.
In the same publication, a slightly more precise (within 0.012%), yet significantly more complicated expression can be found.

== Asymmetric Pseudo-Voigt (Martinelli) function ==
The asymmetry pseudo-Voigt (Martinelli) function resembles a split normal distribution by having different widths on each side of the peak position. Mathematically this is expressed as:

formula_79 

with formula_80 being the weight of the Lorentzian and the width formula_96 being a split function (formula_97for formula_98 and formula_99 for formula_100). In the limit formula_101, the Martinelli function returns to a symmetry pseudo Voigt function. The Martinelli function has been used to model elastic scattering on resonant inelastic X-ray scattering instruments.

<text>The Cayman Islands national football team is the national team of the Cayman Islands, and is controlled by the Cayman Islands Football Association. It is a member of FIFA and CONCACAF. Cayman Islands&#x27; home ground is Truman Bodden Stadium in George Town, and their head coach is Joey Jap Tjong. Tjong replaced Cláudio Garcia in February 2024. Garcia had replaced Ben Pugh, who was appointed in 2018, when the Cayman Islands national team had failed to win a single game in over nine years, sinking to 206 in the FIFA World Rankings. Under Pugh, they advanced 13 places in the rankings, winning four out of their six matches during the 2019–20 Nations League season.

==History==

===1985–2000===

The Caymanian football team played its first international match on 3 March 1985, against Dominica, in Roseau, as part of the 1985 CFU Championship. They lost that match 2–1 with Lee Ramoon - who would go on to become the team&#x27;s top scorer - opening the scoring.

They qualified for the 1991 Caribbean Cup, falling in the first round. They returned to the tournament in 1994, suffering the same fate. However, the following year, the Cayman Islands jointly organized with Jamaica the 1995 Caribbean Cup, reaching the semi-finals. It fell to Trinidad and Tobago by a scandalous 2–9. In the match for 3rd place, they were defeated by Cuba 0–3. They would qualify again in 1998 although they failed to get past the group stage. They have not played a Caribbean Cup final phase since then.

The Cayman Islands participated in their first World Cup qualifying tie in the 1998 where they succumbed in the first round at the hands of Cuba, who eliminated them after winning twice 0–1 and 0–5.

===2000–2010===

In 2000, given the status of the Cayman Islands as one of the British overseas territories, the national team attempted to use this as a loophole to call up a number of uncapped players possessing British passports but who had no specific links to the islands. Barry McIntosh, a football agent, was called in to scout players for an upcoming FIFA World Cup qualifier against Cuba and ultimately he secured eight players i.e. Wayne Allison (Tranmere Rovers), Ged Brannan (Motherwell), David Barnett (Lincoln City), Martin O&#x27;Connor (Birmingham City), Dwayne Plummer (Bristol City), Barry Hayles (Fulham), Neville Roach (Southend United) and Neil Sharpe (Boreham Wood). With the exception of Allison the players all appeared in a 5–0 friendly defeat against D.C. United but before they could appear in any official internationals FIFA stepped in and barred the players from representing the Cayman Islands due to their failure to satisfy the existing rules for national team eligibility. Of the eight players only Hayles went on to play international football, appearing for Jamaica ten times.

In the first round of the 2002 qualifiers, Cayman Islands was once again eliminated by Cuba, winning 4–0 in Havana and drawing 0–0 in George Town. History repeated itself four years later, in the 2006 qualifiers, since the Cubans eliminated the Caymanian team from the World Cup for the third time in a row (1–2 in George Town and 4–0 in Havana).

Things didn&#x27;t change significantly for the 2010 qualifiers, only this time it was Bermuda that eliminated the Cayman Islands in the first round, 4–2 on aggregate. Regardless, this tie saw the Caymanians earn their first points away from home, earning a 1–1 draw at Hamilton on 3 February 2008, with Allean Grant scoring in the 87th minute.

===2010–present===

Qualifying directly into the second round of the 2014 qualifiers, the Cayman Islands were drawn in group A along with their peers from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Suriname. They lost 5 games out of 6, rescuing a 1–1 draw on the last day, on 14 November 2011, against the Dominicans. The Caymanian team did not play any match again in the next few years, since declining their participation in the 2012 and 2014 Caribbean Cups. But they returned to the 2018 qualifiers, facing Belize in the first round. The first leg in Belmopan finished 0–0 and the second leg in George Town finished 1–1. The 1–1 aggregate score meant the Cayman Islands were eliminated on the away goal rule. With this unbeaten elimination, Cayman Islands can say that they are one of the few teams in the world that did not qualify for a FIFA World Cup despite not losing a single match.

<doc id="1202119" wikidata="Q2962778" url="?curid=1202119" title="Cherry Peel">
<text>Cherry Peel is the debut album of the Elephant 6 band of Montreal. It was released on Bar/None Records in 1997. In 1999 it was reissued with additional musical contributions and the songs remixed. All subsequent reissues contain this mix. All songs were written by Kevin Barnes.

==Background==
Prior to &quot;Cherry Peel&quot;, Barnes had made cassettes of 4-track recordings to share with friends and family. They had sent some tapes to independent record labels as well, and they ended up being signed by Bar/None Records.

Barnes was then given a budget of $3,000 to record an album. Bar/None partially gave the advance with the expectation that Jeff Mangum, the frontman of Neutral Milk Hotel who had just released the critical hit &quot;On Avery Island&quot;, would be co-producing. Mangum told Barnes that he would allow them to use his name to more easily get the deal but couldn&#x27;t co-produce as he was busy.

Barnes had also befriended the other members of Neutral Milk Hotel, including Julian Koster, who helped Barnes record the album. During this time, of Montreal would join the Elephant 6 Recording Company.

Bar/None encouraged Barnes to record the album in a studio, but Kevin was used to the intimacy home recording and did not like the sound of &#x27;90s studio polish. They vyed for a contemporary 1960s folk-pop analog feel, akin to influences &quot;The Kinks&quot; and early Paul McCartney. They acquired an eight track quarter-inch reel-to-reel TASCAM to record the songs at home as they were used to doing. They also purchased multiple contact PCM mics and a tape machine from RadioShack, often using the internal microphone to give vocals a signature more distorted sound. 

The live lineup of the time consisted of Kevin Barnes on vocals and guitar, Derek Almstead on drums and The Late B.P. Helium on bass. Songs recorded with this lineup consisted of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stop Your Memory&quot;, &quot;Sleeping in the Beetle Bug&quot;, &quot;Montreal&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Gift&quot;. When the album was overdubbed and remixed in 1999, &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me to Explain&quot; was also re-recorded by this band, the original version being a solo four track recording. The rest of the songs were recorded entirely by Kevin.

The majority of the songs were written prior to the recording of the album, some of them being the songs presented to the label as four track recordings before Kevin was signed. Tracks that weren&#x27;t re-recorded ended up being released on &quot;The Early Four Track Recordings&quot; compilation. &quot;Everything Disappears When You Come Around&quot; and &quot;Baby&quot; were written during the recording process of the album.

&quot;When You&#x27;re Loved Like You Are&quot; was written about Barnes&#x27; uncle, who was dying at the time of cancer. He left Barnes $7,000 which they would later use to buy another tape machine, on which &quot;The Gay Parade&quot; and &quot;Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse&quot; were recorded.
Many of the songs, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me to Explain&quot; and &quot;Montreal&quot;, are about Barnes&#x27; pen pal from Montreal, Julie, after whom the band is named. Barnes drove to Montreal to see her in person, but it ended poorly. The experience devastated Kevin and became the lyrical inspiration behind the bulk of early of Montreal material.

&quot;Tim I Wish You Were Born a Girl&quot; was the first song written for the album, about Barnes&#x27; friend Tim Root. &quot;In Dreams I Dance With You&quot;, &quot;I Was Watching Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;At Night Trees Aren&#x27;t Sleeping&quot; were written about another friend, Orenda. &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Gift&quot; was written for Julian as a thank you for helping them throughout the making of the album.

Due to the personal lyrics and complicated chord progressions, Barnes saw &quot;Cherry Peel&quot; as a more serious, introspective work than some critics and listeners did, denouncing the twee pop moniker it tends to be associated with. This, as well as the toll the failed Montreal relationship took, led to less personal, more abstract lyrical content and frantic musical styles from &quot;The Gay Parade&quot; until &quot;Satanic Panic in the Attic&quot;.

<text>TVBS Media Inc. (), formerly Liann Yee Production Co., Ltd. () is a Taiwanese commercial television broadcasting company. It was originally established as a joint venture between Hong Kong television network TVB and Taiwanese network Era Group, but TVB took over Era&#x27;s shares in the company in 2005. Later, TVB sold all of its shares in the company to HTC Corporation Chairwoman Cher Wang. 

As of 2019, TVBS operates four domestic channels and one international channel: TVBS, the flagship channel; TVBS News, 24-hour news channel; TVBS Entertainment, which shows variety and drama series; TVBS E! (formerly TVB8), an alternative channel available on CHT MOD IPTV platform; and TVBS Asia, available outside Taiwan.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated the parent company of TVBS, TVB, to be &quot;Captured Private Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

==History==

The company&#x27;s flagship channel, TVBS, began its broadcast through satellite DTH and local cable systems on 28 September 1993. The name originally stood for &quot;TVB Superchannel&quot;, while its Chinese name was &quot;Wuhsien Weihsing Tienshiht&#x27;ai&quot; (). It was originally a part of the so-called &quot;Gang of Five&quot;, which was a consortium that was set up to compete against Star TV across Asia. (The others in the group were CNN International, HBO, ESPN International [with its Asian operations] and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation [with Australia Television International]) The consortium&#x27;s channels were initially transmitted via Palapa satellite, but were later also added to Apstar satellite. TVBS later launched an international version named TVBS Asia in 1997, and TVB launched separate satellite channels that targeted East and Southeast Asia in 1998.

As the first privately owned broadcaster, it broke the decades-long oligopoly of the three state-owned terrestrial television stations in the Taiwan market.

TVBS Media was the first Taiwanese broadcasting company to go full HD, from filming to production to broadcast. It was the first to introduce 4K cameras paired with movie-quality lenses to film and produce its dramas, programs, and news special reports.

==TVBS channels==
TVBS operates four channels:
* TVBS
* TVBS Entertainment Channel
* TVBS News
* TVBS-Asia
* TVBS E!

==Controversy==
* Government Information Office (GIO) Taiwan head Pasuya Yao claims TVBS violated Taiwan media ownership laws, requiring that a foreign juristic person should not &quot;directly&quot; own majority shares of local satellite channels. On 1 November 2005, the announced a fine of NT$1 million against TVBS and ordered that it comply with the ownership rules in a practical timeframe, and afterwards TVBS appealed to Executive Yuan against Yao&#x27;s decision. TVBS stated that TVB, a television broadcasting company in Hong Kong, held majority ownership of the company by a local juristic person. Executive Yuan announced that TVBS&#x27;s ownership models is legal and GIO are required to return the fine.
* Bitumen duck incident (瀝青鴨事件): happened on 29 December 2006. Although TVBS apologized, the incident had already caused damage to the duck farming industry.
* Chou Cheng-pao Video Tape incident (周政保影帶事件): happened on 26 March 2007. On March 30, the NCC fined TVBS a total of two million New Taiwan dollars and required TVBS to replace the general manager.

<doc id="1202125" wikidata="Q1439639" url="?curid=1202125" title="Photoengraving">
<text>Photoengraving is a process that uses a light-sensitive photoresist applied to the surface to be engraved to create a mask that protects some areas during a subsequent operation which etches, dissolves, or otherwise removes some or all of the material from the unshielded areas of a substrate. Normally applied to metal, it can also be used on glass, plastic and other materials.

A photoresist is selected which is resistant to the particular acid or other etching compound to be used. It may be a liquid applied by brushing, spraying, pouring or other means and then allowed to set, or it may come in sheet form and be applied by laminating. It is then exposed to light—usually strong ultraviolet (UV) light—through a photographic, mechanically printed, or manually created image or pattern on transparent film. Alternatively, a lens may be used to project an image directly onto it. Typically, the photoresist is hardened where it receives sufficient exposure to light, but some photoresists are initially hard and are then softened by exposure. A solvent is used to wash away the soft parts, laying bare the underlying material, which is then bathed in or sprayed with the acid or other etchant. The remaining photoresist is usually removed after the operation is complete.

In the graphic arts, photoengraving is used to make printing plates for various printing processes, reproducing a wide variety of graphics such as lettering, line drawings and photographs. Photogravure and screen printing are examples of such process.

The same procedure is used to make printed circuit boards, foil-stamping dies and embossing dies. It is also used to make nameplates, commemorative plaques and other decorative engravings. It can be used to make flat springs, levers, gears and other practical components that would otherwise be fabricated from sheet metal by cutting, drilling, jigsawing or stamping. A very high degree of precision is possible. In these applications, it is properly called photochemical machining, but the terms photochemical milling, chemical milling and photoetching are sometimes used. A similar process called photolithography is used to make integrated circuits.

==Methods==
One method of photoengraving produces a shallow depression in the metal. This is used for intaglio printing plates or for decorative purposes. It is also the same method used for printed circuit boards. The engraving is usually made in copper or brass. The process can be done in open trays but is much more effective if the etchant (often ferric chloride) is sprayed onto the metal. When ferric chloride is used as the etchant, no metal parts other than titanium can be used in the etching equipment. Decorative engraving is often filled by spray-painting then sanding to remove the paint from the raised parts of the engraving.

Another method produces a deep engraving with sloped shoulders. In this method, the metal (usually zinc or magnesium) is held face down and a mixture of nitric acid and a soap-like oil is splashed onto it. As the acid etches the surface, the oil adheres to the edges of the exposed area. This progressively reduces the area being etched, resulting in a sloped edge; a single dot will end up as a cone-shaped mound protruding from the etched area. This method is used for printing plates (the shoulder supports the printing surface), foil stamping dies and embossing dies. Decorative engravings made by this method may go through a second process to produce a decorative background. The raised parts and their shoulders are painted with an etchant-resistant material and a pattern of etchant-resistant material is applied to the deep parts of the engraving. The resist for the background may be another photoengraving or may be randomly splashed on. The engraving is etched again for a short time to produce a raised pattern in the background. Decorative engravings of this type may also be spray-painted and sanded as in the previous method.

In traditional print shop practice, a special very-large-format camera is used to image the source material either directly onto the photosensitive coating, or onto a sheet of photographic film which is then developed and contact-printed onto the coated plate. In large-scale commercial printing, computer-driven optoelectronic equivalents began to replace these methods in the 1970s. In the case of line cuts (graphics in solid blacks and whites without gradations of gray or color), the photoengraving is done on zinc, and the result is called a zinc etching. In the case of halftone cuts, the work is done on copper. The halftone effect is accomplished by photographing the subject through a wire or glass screen, which breaks the image up into a pattern of dots with sizes corresponding to the local brightness of the image; the larger dots create the darker areas, the smaller dots the highlights. The finer the screen, the finer the detail possible in the printed product. Halftones made with a screen having 65 lines to the inch are considered coarse. Those having 150 lines to the inch are considered fine.

==History==
The first photoengraving process was developed in the 1820s by Nicéphore Niépce, which used photoresist to make a one-off camera photograph rather than a printing plate. His usual test subjects were paper prints of conventional engravings, and exposure was by contact under direct sunlight rather than by the use of a camera. Several metals were tried for the printing plate, as well as glass and lithographic stone. His first success came in 1822. The earliest known surviving example of a paper print made from one of his photoengraved plates dates to 1825 and reproduces a 17th-century engraving.

Niépce used Bitumen of Judea as the photoresist. Initially soluble in various spirits and oils, a thin coating of bitumen hardens (polymerizes) where it is exposed to light. The unexposed parts can then be rinsed away with a solvent, baring the underlying material, which can then be etched to the desired depth. Niépce&#x27;s process lay dormant for many years, but it was revived in the 1850s and bitumen was widely used as a photoresist far into the 20th century. Very long exposures in bright light were required, but bitumen had the advantage that it was superbly resistant to strong acids.

The use of photoengraving for a halftone process that could be used to print grayscale photographic images dates back to the 1839 introduction of the daguerreotype, the first practical photographic process. The daguerreotype image consisted of a microscopically fine granular structure on the surface of a silver-plated copper sheet that had been polished to a mirror finish. Methods were soon devised for differentially etching the image grains and the ground so that the daguerreotype could be used as a printing plate. In some instances, very pleasing results were obtained, but exceptional skill and care were required and the very fine structure of the image limited the useful life of each plate to a few hundred prints at best.

Henry Fox Talbot is usually credited with the first workable process for converting a grayscale image into a varying structure of stark black and white that resulted in a reasonably durable printing plate. As with other early halftone processes, the plate could not be combined with ordinary type, so for inclusion in a book or periodical each image had to be printed separately and either bound in or tipped in with an adhesive.

Frederic E. Ives is usually credited with the first commercially successful process that was compatible with ordinary letterpress printing, so that halftone blocks could be printed along with blocks of text in books, periodicals and newspapers. His process came into widespread use during the 1890s, largely replacing the hand-engraved wood and metal blocks that had previously served to provide illustrations.

As in many other fields of invention, there are conflicting claims of priority, instances of simultaneous invention, and variously nuanced definitions of the terminology, so sorting out the merits of the &quot;first&quot; claims made on behalf of the many inventors in the field of halftone reproduction—not infrequently biased by nationalistic sentiments—can be very problematic.

<text>The Guns of the South is a alternate history science fiction novel set during the American Civil War by Harry Turtledove. It was released in the United States on September 22, 1992.

The story deals with a group of time traveling members of the &quot;Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging&quot; (AWB) from an imagined 21st-century South Africa, who supply Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia with AK-47s and other advanced technology, medicine and intelligence. Their intervention results in a Confederate victory in the war. Afterwards, however, the AWB members discover that their ideas for the Confederate States and Lee&#x27;s are not one and the same as they believed and the general and the men of the South have a violent falling out with the white supremacists from the future.

==Plot==

===Alteration of the Civil War===

In January 1864, the Confederate States is on the verge of losing the Civil War against the United States. Men with strange accents and oddly-mottled clothing approach Confederate General Robert E. Lee at the headquarters of the Army of Northern Virginia. They demonstrate a rifle far superior to all other firearms of the time, operating on chemical and engineering principles that are unknown to Confederate military engineers. They offer to supply the Confederate Army with the rifles, which they refer to as AK-47s. The men, who call their organization &quot;America Will Break&quot; (or &quot;AWB&quot;), establish a base in Rivington in Nash County, North Carolina, along with offices in the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia.

The AWB continues to offer inexplicable intelligence and technology to the Confederacy, including nitroglycerine tablets for treating Lee&#x27;s heart condition. Finally, Lee questions their leader, Andries Rhoodie, who provides Lee a partially true explanation. The men of AWB are Afrikaner Neo-Nazi ultra-nationalists from post-apartheid South Africa, having traveled back 150 years from the year 2014 to change the outcome of the Civil War. The newcomers claim that white supremacy has not endured to the modern era and that blacks have marginalized whites. Lee is told that President Abraham Lincoln will act as a vicious tyrant during his second term and that his successor, Thaddeus Stevens, will continue his work to ensure that blacks will become the dominant political faction in the former Confederacy, as they outnumber whites in many areas. The AWB says that blacks will take over other countries, including the United Kingdom.

The AWB men train soldiers to use their new weapons and issue ammunition. With the AWB&#x27;s guns and some direct military aid from the time-traveling Afrikaners, the Army of Northern Virginia drives Union General Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s forces out of Virginia. In a surprise night attack they capture Washington, thus ending the Civil War. Lincoln refuses to flee the capital during their advance and appears on the White House lawn, where he addresses them before personally surrendering to Lee. The United Kingdom and France recognize the Confederacy, and Lincoln is forced to accept the Confederate victory.

===Events after Confederate victory===
The two sides hold formal peace negotiations in Richmond, with Lee as one of the commissioners, to settle territorial disputes and Confederate demands for reparation. At the same time, the Union defeat in the war results in a four-way split in the 1864 presidential election, with Lincoln losing to New York Governor Horatio Seymour. After the election is decided, the Union reluctantly agrees to pay $90 million in gold (more than $1.4 billion in 2019) as reparations; the Confederacy, in turn, gives up any claim to Maryland and West Virginia. At Lee&#x27;s suggestion, the border states of Kentucky and Missouri hold elections to decide their status; Kentucky joins the Confederacy, while Missouri remains in the Union.

Many Confederate slaves freed by the Union during the war who served in the Union Army continue to fight Confederate forces long after the Union formally surrenders. That frightens many Confederate whites and infuriates the troops charged with fighting them, particularly Nathan Bedford Forrest and his men. Lee, already dubious about slavery and respectful of the courage of the United States Colored Troops during the war, becomes convinced that continuing to enslave blacks is both morally wrong and ultimately impracticable. Despite threats from Rhoodie and the AWB, Lee makes no effort to hide his views.

At the urging and with the full backing of Jefferson Davis, who may not be re-elected under the Constitution of the Confederate States after his six-year term, Lee runs for President in the 1867 Confederate States presidential election, on a pro-abolition Confederate Party ticket with Senator Albert Gallatin Brown of Mississippi as his running mate. The Rivington men back the pro-slavery Patriot Party ticket of General Nathan Bedford Forrest and Senator Louis Wigfall of Texas, putting their considerable resources into Forrest&#x27;s campaign. Lee achieves a narrow victory, defeating Forrest 69-50 in the Electoral College and by 32,000 popular votes out of 963,437 cast. Following his loss, Forrest concedes defeat.

===AWB&#x27;s betrayal===

Soon after the election, Lee receives a history book that was stolen from the Rivington men by a former Confederate soldier, which covers the Civil War and the original outcome that was supposed to happen without the AWB&#x27;s intervention. Enraged at the lies that Rhoodie had told him about the future, Lee confronts the AWB leader by using the modern history book as proof of Rhoodie&#x27;s dishonesty, and compares his fanaticism to that of John Brown. Faced with the accusations, Rhoodie promises to show the AWB&#x27;s true colors to Lee.

At Lee&#x27;s inauguration on March 4, 1868, AWB men try to assassinate him by using Uzis, which results in the death of Lee&#x27;s wife, Mary, Vice President Brown, various dignitaries and generals, and many civilians. Police forces seize the AWB offices in Richmond after a fierce battle. Lee enters the stronghold to find more technological marvels (such as fluorescent light bulbs and air conditioning), books that document the increasing marginalization of racism from 1865 into the 21st century, and the efforts made to improve race relations. Lee shows the books to the Confederate Congress, in the hope that the future&#x27;s nearly universal condemnation of slavery and racism will convince them to vote for his plan for gradual abolition.

Confederate forces lay siege to Rivington and engage the AWB, which uses modern weaponry such as belt-fed machine guns, sniper rifles, mortars, barbed wire, and land mines to inflict heavy casualties on the Confederate forces. Ultimately, Confederate infantry destroy the AWB&#x27;s time machine during the fighting and seize the town after they break through the AWB defenses. Those surviving AWB men who were unable to escape back to their own time lose hope and surrender.

In Richmond, the Confederate Congress narrowly passes President Lee&#x27;s gradual emancipation bill. Pharmacists have copied the nitroglycerin pills brought by the AWB, and Lee hopes, with their help, to live to see the effects of his plan for emancipation. Several of the stranded Afrikaners agree to help the Confederacy replicate their 21st-century technology so that Lee can counter the Union in both its replica AK-47s and its greater industrial strength. Though the Confederacy has maintained strict neutrality in a war that the Union had started with the British Empire by invading Canada, Lee fears that the Union may later attempt a war of revenge against the Confederacy. He rests assured that the Confederacy will, however, remain the most technologically advanced country in the world for many decades to come.

== Reception ==
&quot;Kirkus&quot; gave a positive review, saying &quot;Readers willing to wink at the time travel will find a well-researched and well-written account of a nation that didn&#x27;t happen. Literate rebs will read it again and again and again.&quot;

==Award==

The book won the John Esten Cooke Award for Southern Fiction in 1993.

<doc id="1202137" wikidata="Q6951908" url="?curid=1202137" title="N1 Western Bypass (Johannesburg)">
<text>The Western Bypass is a section of the N1 and the Johannesburg Ring Road located in the city of Johannesburg, South Africa. Known at the time as the &quot;Concrete Highway&quot;, the freeway was initially opened in 1975 as a route to avoid the city centre of Johannesburg and to provide access to the western areas of the Witwatersrand. From the south, the Western Bypass begins at the Diepkloof Interchange in Soweto, where it splits from the N12 freeway and ends at the Buccleuch Interchange, where it merges with the N3 Eastern Bypass, M1 South and N1 Ben Schoeman freeways.

The Western Bypass is the longest section of the Johannesburg Ring Road. The freeway is mostly four lanes wide in either direction, but fans out into six lanes between Rivonia and Buccleuch, where there is heavy traffic moving north towards Pretoria. The Western Bypass is part of the N1 road that spans the length of South Africa.

==Route==
The southern terminus of the N1 Western Bypass is the Diepkloof Interchange, where the co-signed N12 splits off and heads east as the N12 Southern Bypass. At the same interchange, the N1 meets the M79 Rand Show Road (southbound only).

The Western Bypass continues north, with the suburb of Diepkloof to the west, to intersect with the M70 &quot;Soweto Highway&quot; that connects Soweto to the Johannesburg CBD (northerly off-ramp &amp; southerly on-ramp). Continuing north, near Riverlea, it intersects with a road that is part of the proposed extension of the N17 (northerly on-ramp and southerly off-ramp).

It soon crosses under the R41 near Wisbey Dip, heading north-west past the Newclare Cemetery. Here, it forms the borderline between Johannesburg to the east and Roodepoort to the west. It then intersects the R24 Albertina Sisulu Road Interchange in Bosmont. Continuing in a roughly northerly direction it passes under the M18 Ontdekkers Road before interchanging Gordon Road in Florida Glen. Heading north-west, it intersects with the M8 14th Avenue Interchange at Quellerina. Turning north-east, it passes between the suburbs of Weltevredenpark and Fairland to enter Randburg. Here, it intersects with the M5 (Beyers Naudé Drive) Interchange near Randpark Ridge. Continuing north-east, it crosses under the M6 Ysterhout Drive in Bromhof.

Continuing north-east, it intersects the R512 (Malibongwe Drive) Interchange in Strijdompark. The N1 continues north-east through the northern suburbs of Meadowhurst, Olivedale and Douglasdale before it intersects the R511/M81 Winnie Mandela Drive in Bryanston. Now taking an easterly direction, it passes under the M71 Main Road in Bryanston and then runs parallel with the R564 Witkoppen Road to its north until it intersects with the M9 Rivonia Road Interchange in Rivonia. Here, it becomes 6 lanes in each direction. Continuing east, it passes under the M85 Bowling Avenue and then under the R55 Woodmead Drive to reach the Buccleuch Interchange. At this interchange, it has its north-eastern terminus, meeting the M1 highway south to Johannesburg CBD, the N3 Eastern Bypass to the East Rand in the south-east and the N1 Ben Schoeman Freeway to Midrand and Pretoria in the north.

==Improvements==
By creating a narrower emergency shoulder, the freeway was widened during the 1990s from two lanes to three lanes in either direction, to alleviate massive traffic congestion on Johannesburg&#x27;s roads.

From 2007, the Western Bypass was included in the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project (GFIP), which improved traffic conditions in the province and created jobs in construction. Three of the benefits for users of the bypass now include lighting for the full length of the bypass, increased lanes in most parts of the bypass and increased capacity at the northern interchanges with the bypass. The trade-off for this was a toll project, aimed at the entire national road network in Johannesburg. As a result, the entire Western Bypass was declared an e-toll highway (with open road tolling) with 4 electronic tolling gantries in each direction from 3 December 2013 onwards. On 12 April 2024, e-tolls in Gauteng were shut down, effectively making the entire Western Bypass a toll-free route.

Very noticeably, the road is no longer concrete in construction, but has been tarred for its entire length. This spells a death-knell for its &quot;Concrete Highway&quot; nickname.

As with the Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project the R511 Winnie Mandela Drive and the M9/R564 Rivonia Road/Witkoppen Road interchanges were completely upgraded. The highway with the improvement project also upgraded all signage to new overhead signage.

<text>Illinois Route 40 (IL 40) is a north–south route in central portion of the U.S. state of Illinois. It runs from Interstate 74 (I-74) in East Peoria north to IL 78 at Mt. Carroll, just south of U.S. Route 52 (US 52) and IL 64.

== Route description ==

Illinois 40 is known as Knoxville Avenue in the Peoria area, generally south of Illinois Route 6. Route 40 crosses over Interstate 74 north of downtown, and then grows complex in the downtown area, as there are three turns in a one-block length. Illinois 40 then emerges onto William Kumpf Boulevard and crosses over the Illinois River using the Bob Michel Bridge. On the other side of the river, Illinois 40 is briefly called Washington Street. It then is routed onto an onramp to Interstate 74, where there is an exit to Camp Street before terminating at I-74.

== History ==
Originally, SBI Route 40 ran from Sterling to Stockton. In 1935, IL 40 got cut back to Mount Carroll in favor of IL 78. By 1938, Illinois Route 88 entirely acquired IL 40 north of Sterling. In 1987, Illinois Route 5, a four-lane freeway which crosses Illinois 40, was designated Interstate 88 east of I-80. As of 1995, IDOT redesignated Illinois 88 as Illinois 40 to prevent confusion. Although the new number is also the number of a Federal Highway that passes through Illinois (U.S. Route 40), a great enough distance exists between them that the possibility of confusing one for the other is negligible.
Prior to 2003, the Illinois 40 exit on I-74 southeast of Peoria was called &quot;Industrial Spur&quot;. As part of the Upgrade 74 Project, the exit was renamed by the Illinois Department of Transportation to Riverfront Drive.

<text>William Richard Titterton (1876–1963) was a British journalist, writer and poet now remembered as the friend and first biographer of G. K. Chesterton. Titterton and Chesterton met on the London &quot;Daily News&quot;.

==Early life==

In his younger days, he wrote copiously for A. R. Orage&#x27;s &quot;The New Age&quot;. He was the model for some of Jacob Epstein&#x27;s nude sculptures; he modelled too for George Grey Barnard, for the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania courthouse.

==The Weekly and the League==

Titterton was in practical terms the organiser of Chesterton&#x27;s Distributist League, and sub-editor of &quot;G. K.&#x27;s Weekly&quot;.

There were financial problems, and embarrassment caused by Titterton&#x27;s commissioning of articles on H. G. Wells by the lesser writer Edwin Pugh; Pugh&#x27;s articles had a hostile edge and Chesterton had to pacify Wells. His position on the &quot;Weekly&quot; came to an end in 1928, when he was replaced by Edward Macdonald, in a temporarily acrimonious situation, leading to the separation of the &quot;Weekly&quot; and the League.

Under Chesterton&#x27;s influence, he became a Catholic convert in 1931.

<text>AuthorHouse, formerly known as 1stBooks, is a self-publishing company based in the United States. AuthorHouse uses print-on-demand business model and technology.

==History==
Originally called 1stBooks, the company was founded in Bloomington, Indiana, United States, in January 1997. Its first e-book appeared in June of that year. In January 1999, it started using print-on-demand technology to produce paper books. The AuthorHouse website states the company has published over 70,000 titles by 50,000 authors since 1997. The company opened an office in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom, in May 2004. In October 2005, AuthorHouse was nominated by the Indiana Chamber of Commerce for the Small Business of the Year Award. AuthorHouse won the Silver Award under the Service industry category.

The US investment group Bertram Capital purchased AuthorHouse in 2007 from Gazelle TechVentures, which had owned AuthorHouse since 2002. Later in 2007, Bertram established Author Solutions and acquired AuthorHouse competitor iUniverse, before relocating its operations to Indiana in early 2008.

==Brandewyne lawsuit==
In August 2006, a Kansas trial court ordered AuthorHouse to pay $240,000 in punitive damage as well as $230,000 in actual damage to romance author Rebecca Brandewyne and her parents for publishing a book by her ex-husband that was &quot;harmful&quot; and libelous of them. AuthorHouse was also ordered to pay $20,000 each to Brandewyne&#x27;s parents for the damage. Although the court acknowledged that AuthorHouse employed a business model that placed a degree of responsibility for the content of works upon the authors, in this case it found that AuthorHouse had failed to act when it was informed that the book might include libelous content.

He was the 1996 Bradford Bulls season&#x27;s top try scorer and still holds the record for most tries scored for the Bulls.

Paul played for Bradford Bulls as his brother Henry&#x27;s halves partner in the 1999 Super League Grand Final which was lost to St Helens R.F.C.

<text>The N12 Southern Bypass is a section of the Johannesburg Ring Road that forms a beltway around the city of Johannesburg, South Africa, as part of the N12. The freeway was the last section of the Ring Road to be built, with the final section opening in 1986. As part of the old South African Freeways, It was initially called the N13. The entire Southern Bypass freeway was an e-toll highway (with open road tolling) from 3 December 2013 to 11 April 2024.

From the west, the Southern Bypass begins at the Diepkloof Interchange, where it splits from the N1 freeway. It ends at the Elands Interchange, where it merges with the N3 freeway to be cosigned with it on the N3 Eastern Bypass northwards. The exits include the M1 Uncle Charlie&#x27;s Interchange (north eastbound only), M17 Xavier Street, M7 Kliprivier Drive, M11 Comaro Road, R59 Reading Interchange, and R103/M31 Voortrekker Road (Alberton).

The N12 Southern Bypass, which cuts a concrete swath through the rocky hills of southern Johannesburg, is apparently very reminiscent of the freeways of Los Angeles, and together with Johannesburg&#x27;s sunshine, renders a real Southern California feel to that part of the city.

==Background==
As with the N1 Western Bypass, the freeway was built with concrete between Reading and Diepkloof and has always been three lanes wide in either direction, fanning out into four lanes at Reading. The freeway passes through a declared green belt area to the south of Johannesburg, which has prevented the construction of billboards along the roadside, a common practice in the city.

<doc id="1202168" wikidata="Q2142873" url="?curid=1202168" title="Relational operator">
<text>In computer science, a relational operator is a programming language construct or operator that tests or defines some kind of relation between two entities. These include numerical equality (&quot;e.g.&quot;, ) and inequalities (&quot;e.g.&quot;, ).

In programming languages that include a distinct boolean data type in their type system, like Pascal, Ada, Python or Java, these operators usually evaluate to true or false, depending on if the conditional relationship between the two operands holds or not.

In languages such as C, relational operators return the integers 0 or 1, where 0 stands for false and any non-zero value stands for true.

An expression created using a relational operator forms what is termed a &quot;relational expression&quot; or a &quot;condition&quot;. Relational operators can be seen as special cases of logical predicates.

==Equality==

===Usage===
Equality is used in many programming language constructs and data types. It is used to test if an element already exists in a set, or to access to a value through a key. It is used in switch statements to dispatch the control flow to the correct branch, and during the unification process in logic programming.

There can be multiple valid definitions of equality, and any particular language might adopt one or more of them, depending on various design aspects. One possible meaning of equality is that &quot;if &quot;a&quot; equals &quot;b&quot;, then either &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; can be used interchangeably in any context without noticing any difference&quot;. But this statement does not necessarily hold, particularly when taking into account mutability together with content equality.

===Location equality vs. content equality ===
Sometimes, particularly in object-oriented programming, the comparison raises questions of data types and inheritance, equality, and identity. It is often necessary to distinguish between:
* two different objects of the same type, e.g., two hands
* two objects being equal but distinct, e.g., two $10 banknotes
* two objects being equal but having different representation, e.g., a $1 bill and a $1 coin
* two different references to the same object, e.g., two nicknames for the same person

In many modern programming languages, objects and data structures are accessed through references. In such languages, there becomes a need to test for two different types of equality:
* Location equality (identity): if two references (A and B) reference the same object. Interactions with the object through A are indistinguishable from the same interactions through B, and in particular changes to the object through A are reflected through B.
* Content equality: if the objects referenced by two references (A and B) are equivalent in some sense:
:* Structural equality (that is, their contents are the same). which may be either shallow (testing only immediate subparts), or deep (testing for equality of subparts recursively). A simple way to achieve this is through representational equality: checking that the values have the same representation.
:* Some other tailor-made equality, preserving the external behavior. For example, 1/2 and 2/4 are considered equal when seen as a rational number. A possible requirement would be that &quot;A = B if and only if all operations on objects A and B will have the same result&quot;, in addition to reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.

The first type of equality usually implies the second (except for things like &quot;not a number&quot; (NaN) which are unequal to themselves), but the converse is not necessarily true. For example, two string objects may be distinct objects (unequal in the first sense) but contain the same sequence of characters (equal in the second sense). See identity for more of this issue.

Real numbers, including many simple fractions, cannot be represented exactly in floating-point arithmetic, and it may be necessary to test for equality within a given tolerance. Such tolerance, however, can easily break desired properties such as transitivity, whereas reflexivity breaks too: the IEEE floating-point standard requires that &quot;NaN ≠ NaN&quot; holds. In contrast, the (2022) private standard for posit arithmetic (posit proponents mean to replace IEEE floats) has a similar concept, NaR (Not a Real), where &quot;NaR = NaR&quot; holds.

Other programming elements such as computable functions, may either have no sense of equality, or an equality that is uncomputable. For these reasons, some languages define an explicit notion of &quot;comparable&quot;, in the form of a base class, an interface, a trait or a protocol, which is used either explicitly, by declaration in source code, or implicitly, via the structure of the type involved.

===Comparing values of different types===
In JavaScript, PHP, VBScript and a few other dynamically typed languages, the standard equality operator follows so-called &quot;loose typing&quot;, that is it evaluates to &quot;true&quot; even if two values are not equal and are of incompatible types, but can be &quot;coerced&quot; to each other by some set of language-specific rules, making the number 4 compare equal to the text string &quot;4&quot;, for instance. Although such behaviour is typically meant to make the language easier, it can lead to surprising and difficult to predict consequences that many programmers are unaware of. For example, JavaScript&#x27;s loose equality rules can cause equality to be intransitive (i.e., codice_1 and codice_2, but codice_3), or make certain values be equal to their own negation.

A strict equality operator is also often available in those languages, returning true only for values with identical or equivalent types (in PHP, codice_4 is false although codice_5 is true). For languages where the number 0 may be interpreted as &quot;false&quot;, this operator may simplify things such as checking for zero (as codice_6 would be true for x being either 0 or &quot;0&quot; using the type agnostic equality operator).

==Ordering==
&quot;Greater than&quot; and &quot;less than&quot; comparison of non-numeric data is performed according to a sort convention (such as, for text strings, lexicographical order) which may be built into the programming language and/or configurable by a programmer.

When it is desired to associate a numeric value with the result of a comparison between two data items, say &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, the usual convention is to assign −1 if a &lt; b, 0 if a = b and 1 if a &gt; b. For example, the C function codice_7 performs a three-way comparison and returns −1, 0, or 1 according to this convention, and qsort expects the comparison function to return values according to this convention. In sorting algorithms, the efficiency of comparison code is critical since it is one of the major factors contributing to sorting performance.

Comparison of programmer-defined data types (data types for which the programming language has no in-built understanding) may be carried out by custom-written or library functions (such as codice_8 mentioned above), or, in some languages, by &quot;overloading&quot; a comparison operator – that is, assigning a programmer-defined meaning that depends on the data types being compared. Another alternative is using some convention such as member-wise comparison.

==Logical equivalence==
Though perhaps unobvious at first, like the boolean logical operators XOR, AND, OR, and NOT, relational operators can be designed to have logical equivalence, such that they can all be defined in terms of one another. The following four conditional statements all have the same logical equivalence &quot;E&quot; (either all true or all false) for any given &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; values:
:formula_1

This relies on the domain being well ordered.

==Standard relational operators==
The most common numerical relational operators used in programming languages are shown below. Standard SQL uses the same operators as BASIC, while many databases allow codice_9 in addition to codice_10 from the standard. SQL follows strict boolean algebra, i.e. doesn&#x27;t use short-circuit evaluation, which is common to most languages below. E.g. PHP has it, but otherwise it has these same two operators defined as aliases, like many SQL databases.


Other conventions are less common: Common Lisp and Macsyma/Maxima use Basic-like operators for numerical values, except for inequality, which is codice_11 in Common Lisp and codice_12 in Macsyma/Maxima. Common Lisp has multiple other sets of equality and relational operators serving different purposes, including codice_13, codice_14, codice_15, codice_16, and codice_17. Older Lisps used codice_15, codice_19, and codice_20; and negated them using codice_21 for the remaining operators.

==Syntax==
Relational operators are also used in technical literature instead of words. Relational operators are usually written in infix notation, if supported by the programming language, which means that they appear between their operands (the two expressions being related). For example, an expression in Python will print the message if the &quot;x&quot; is less than &quot;y&quot;:

if x &lt; y:
 print(&quot;x is less than y in this example&quot;)
Other programming languages, such as Lisp, use prefix notation, as follows:

(&gt;= X Y)
===Operator chaining===
In mathematics, it is common practice to chain relational operators, such as in 3 &lt; x &lt; y &lt; 20 (meaning 3 &lt; x &quot;and&quot; x &lt; y &quot;and&quot; y &lt; 20). The syntax is clear since these relational operators in mathematics are transitive.

However, many recent programming languages would see an expression like 3 &lt; x &lt; y as consisting of two left (or right-) associative operators, interpreting it as something like codice_22. If we say that x=4, we then get codice_23, and evaluation will give codice_24 which generally does not make sense. However, it does compile in C/C++ and some other languages, yielding surprising result (as &quot;true&quot; would be represented by the number 1 here).

It is possible to give the expression codice_25 its familiar mathematical meaning, and some programming languages such as Python and Raku do that. Others, such as C# and Java, do not, partly because it would differ from the way most other infix operators work in C-like languages. The D programming language does not do that since it maintains some compatibility with C, and &quot;Allowing C expressions but with subtly different semantics (albeit arguably in the right direction) would add more confusion than convenience&quot;.

Some languages, like Common Lisp, use multiple argument predicates for this. In Lisp codice_26 is true when x is between 1 and 10.

===Confusion with assignment operators===

Early FORTRAN (1956–57) was bounded by heavily restricted character sets where codice_27 was the only relational operator available. There were no codice_28 or codice_29 (and certainly no codice_30 or codice_31). This forced the designers to define symbols such as codice_32, codice_33, codice_34, codice_35 etc. and subsequently made it tempting to use the remaining codice_27 character for copying, despite the obvious incoherence with mathematical usage (codice_37 should be impossible).

International Algebraic Language (IAL, ALGOL 58) and ALGOL (1958 and 1960) thus introduced codice_38 for assignment, leaving the standard codice_27 available for equality, a convention followed by CPL, ALGOL W, ALGOL 68, Basic Combined Programming Language (BCPL), Simula, SET Language (SETL), Pascal, Smalltalk, Modula-2, Ada, Standard ML, OCaml, Eiffel, Object Pascal (Delphi), Oberon, Dylan, VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL), and several other languages.

====B and C====
This uniform de facto standard among most programming languages was eventually changed, indirectly, by a minimalist compiled language named B. Its sole intended application was as a vehicle for a first port of (a then very primitive) Unix, but it also evolved into the very influential C language.

B started off as a syntactically changed variant of the systems programming language BCPL, a simplified (and typeless) version of CPL. In what has been described as a &quot;strip-down&quot; process, the codice_40 and codice_41 operators of BCPL were replaced with codice_42 and codice_43 (which would later become codice_44 and codice_45, respectively.). In the same process, the ALGOL style codice_38 of BCPL was replaced by codice_27 in B. The reason for all this being unknown. As variable updates had no special syntax in B (such as codice_48 or similar) and were allowed in expressions, this non standard meaning of the equal sign meant that the traditional semantics of the equal sign now had to be associated with another symbol. Ken Thompson used the ad hoc codice_49 combination for this.

As a small type system was later introduced, B then became C. The popularity of this language along with its association with Unix, led to Java, C#, and many other languages following suit, syntactically, despite this needless conflict with the mathematical meaning of the equal sign.

====Languages====
Assignments in C have a value and since any non-zero scalar value is interpreted as &quot;true&quot; in conditional expressions, the code codice_50 is legal, but has a very different meaning from codice_51. The former code fragment means &quot;assign &quot;y&quot; to &quot;x&quot;, and if the new value of &quot;x&quot; is not zero, execute the following statement&quot;. The latter fragment means &quot;if and only if &quot;x&quot; is equal to &quot;y&quot;, execute the following statement&quot;.

 int x = 1;
 int y = 2;
 if (x = y) {
 /* This code will always execute if y is anything but 0*/
 printf(&quot;x is %d and y is %d\n&quot;, x, y);


Though Java and C# have the same operators as C, this mistake usually causes a compile error in these languages instead, because the if-condition must be of type codice_52, and there is no implicit way to convert from other types (&quot;e.g.&quot;, numbers) into codice_52s. So unless the variable that is assigned to has type codice_52 (or wrapper type codice_55), there will be a compile error.

In ALGOL-like languages such as Pascal, Delphi, and Ada (in the sense that they allow nested function definitions), and in Python, and many functional languages, among others, assignment operators cannot appear in an expression (including codice_56 clauses), thus precluding this class of error. Some compilers, such as GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), provide a warning when compiling code containing an assignment operator inside an if statement, though there are some legitimate uses of an assignment inside an if-condition. In such cases, the assignment must be wrapped in an extra pair of parentheses explicitly, to avoid the warning.

Similarly, some languages, such as BASIC use just the codice_27 symbol for both assignment &quot;and&quot; equality, as they are syntactically separate (as with Pascal, Ada, Python, etc., assignment operators cannot appear in expressions).

Some programmers get in the habit of writing comparisons against a constant in the reverse of the usual order:
 if (2 == a) { /* Mistaken use of = versus == would be a compile-time error */


If codice_27 is used accidentally, the resulting code is invalid because 2 is not a variable. The compiler will generate an error message, on which the proper operator can be substituted. This coding style is termed left-hand comparison, or Yoda conditions.

This table lists the different mechanisms to test for these two types of equality in various languages:

Ruby uses codice_59 to mean &quot;b is a member of the set a&quot;, though the details of what it means to be a member vary considerably depending on the data types involved. codice_60 is here known as the &quot;case equality&quot; or &quot;case subsumption&quot; operator.

<text>Moniza Alvi FRSL (born 2 February 1954) is a British-Pakistani writer and poet. She has won several well-known prizes for her verse. She was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2023.

==Life and education==
Moniza Alvi was born in Lahore, Pakistan, to a Pakistani father and a British mother. Her father moved to Hatfield, Hertfordshire, in England when Alvi was few months old. She did not revisit Pakistan until after the publication of one of her first books of poems – &quot;The Country at My Shoulder&quot;. She worked for several years as a high-school teacher but is currently a freelance writer and tutor, living in Norfolk.

==Poetry==
&quot;Peacock Luggage&quot;, a book of poems by Moniza Alvi and Peter Daniels, was published after the two poets jointly won the Poetry Business Prize in 1991, in Alvi&#x27;s case for &quot;Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan&quot;. That poem and &quot;An Unknown Girl&quot; have featured on England&#x27;s GCSE exam syllabus for young teenagers.

Since then, Moniza Alvi has written four poetry collections. &quot;The Country at My Shoulder&quot; (1993) led to her being selected for the Poetry Society&#x27;s New Generation Poets promotion in 1994. She also published a series of short stories, &quot;How the Stone Found its Voice&quot; (2005), inspired by Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Just So Stories&quot;.

In 2002, she received a Cholmondeley Award for her poetry. In 2003 a selection of her poetry was published in a bilingual Dutch and English edition. A selection from her earlier books, &quot;Split World: Poems 1990–2005&quot;, was published in 2008.

On 16 January 2014, Alvi participated in the BBC Radio 3 series &quot;The Essay – Letters to a Young Poet&quot;. Taking Rainer Maria Rilke&#x27;s classic text, &quot;Letters to a Young Poet&quot; as their inspiration, leading poets wrote a letter to a protégé.
