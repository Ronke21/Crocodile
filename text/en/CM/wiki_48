<text>A natural product is a natural compound or substance produced by a living organism—that is, found in nature. In the broadest sense, natural products include any substance produced by life. Natural products can also be prepared by chemical synthesis (both semisynthesis and total synthesis and have played a central role in the development of the field of organic chemistry by providing challenging synthetic targets. The term &quot;natural product&quot; has also been extended for commercial purposes to refer to cosmetics, dietary supplements, and foods produced from natural sources without added artificial ingredients.

Within the field of organic chemistry, the definition of natural products is usually restricted to organic compounds isolated from natural sources that are produced by the pathways of primary or secondary metabolism. Within the field of medicinal chemistry, the definition is often further restricted to secondary metabolites. Secondary metabolites (or specialized metabolites) are not essential for survival, but nevertheless provide organisms that produce them an evolutionary advantage. Many secondary metabolites are cytotoxic and have been selected and optimized through evolution for use as &quot;chemical warfare&quot; agents against prey, predators, and competing organisms. Secondary or specialized metabolites are often unique to specific species, whereas primary metabolites are commonly found across multiple kingdoms. Secondary metabolites are marked by chemical complexity which is why they are of such interest to chemists.

Natural sources may lead to basic research on potential bioactive components for commercial development as lead compounds in drug discovery. Although natural products have inspired numerous drugs, drug development from natural sources has received declining attention in the 21st century by pharmaceutical companies, partly due to unreliable access and supply, intellectual property, cost, and profit concerns, seasonal or environmental variability of composition, and loss of sources due to rising extinction rates. Despite this, natural products and their derivatives still accounted for about 10% of new drug approvals between 2017 and 2019.

== Classes ==
The broadest definition of natural product is anything that is produced by life, and includes the likes of biotic materials (e.g. wood, silk), bio-based materials (e.g. bioplastics, cornstarch), bodily fluids (e.g. milk, plant exudates), and other natural materials (e.g. soil, coal).

Natural products may be classified according to their biological function, biosynthetic pathway, or source. Depending on the sources, the number of known natural product molecules ranges between 300,000 and 400,000.

== Function ==

Following Albrecht Kossel&#x27;s original proposal in 1891, natural products are often divided into two major classes, the primary and secondary metabolites. Primary metabolites have an intrinsic function that is essential to the survival of the organism that produces them. Secondary metabolites in contrast have an extrinsic function that mainly affects other organisms. Secondary metabolites are not essential to survival but do increase the competitiveness of the organism within its environment. For instance, alkaloids like morphine and nicotine act as defense chemicals against herbivores, while flavonoids attract pollinators, and terpenes such as menthol serve to repel insects. Because of their ability to modulate biochemical and signal transduction pathways, some secondary metabolites have useful medicinal properties.

Natural products especially within the field of organic chemistry are often defined as primary and secondary metabolites. A more restrictive definition limiting natural products to secondary metabolites is commonly used within the fields of medicinal chemistry and pharmacognosy.

=== Primary metabolites ===

Primary metabolites, as defined by Kossel, are essential components of basic metabolic pathways required for life. They are associated with fundamental cellular functions such as nutrient assimilation, energy production, and growth and development. These metabolites have a wide distribution across many phyla and often span more than one kingdom. Primary metabolites include the basic building blocks of life: carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, and nucleic acids.

Primary metabolites involved in energy production include enzymes essential for respiratory and photosynthetic processes. These enzymes are composed of amino acids and often require non-peptidic cofactors for proper function. The basic structures of cells and organisms are also built from primary metabolites, including components such as cell membranes (e.g., phospholipids), cell walls (e.g., peptidoglycan, chitin), and cytoskeletons (proteins).

Enzymatic cofactors that are primary metabolites include several members of the vitamin B family. For instance, Vitamin B1 (thiamine diphosphate), synthesized from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate, serves as a coenzyme for enzymes such as pyruvate dehydrogenase, 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase—all involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin), derived from ribulose 5-phosphate and guanosine triphosphate, is a precursor to FMN and FAD, which are crucial for various redox reactions. Vitamin B3 (nicotinic acid or niacin), synthesized from tryptophan, is an essential part of the coenzymes NAD and NADP, necessary for electron transport in the Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and other redox processes. Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), derived from α,β-dihydroxyisovalerate (a precursor to valine) and aspartic acid, is a component of coenzyme A, which plays a vital role in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, as well as fatty acid biosynthesis. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxol, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine, originating from erythrose 4-phosphate), functions as pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and acts as a cofactor for enzymes, particularly transaminases, involved in amino acid metabolism. Vitamin B12 (cobalamins) contains a corrin ring structure, similar to porphyrin, and serves as a coenzyme in fatty acid catabolism and methionine synthesis.

Other primary metabolite vitamins include retinol (vitamin A), synthesized in animals from plant-derived carotenoids via the mevalonate pathway, and ascorbic acid (vitamin C), which is synthesized from glucose in the liver of animals, though not in humans.

DNA and RNA, which store and transmit genetic information, are synthesized from primary metabolites, specifically nucleic acids and carbohydrates.

First messengers are signaling molecules that regulate metabolism and cellular differentiation. These include hormones and growth factors composed of peptides, biogenic amines, steroid hormones, auxins, and gibberellins. These first messengers interact with cellular receptors, which are protein-based, and trigger the activation of second messengers to relay the extracellular signal to intracellular targets. Second messengers often include primary metabolites such as cyclic nucleotides and diacyl glycerol.

=== Secondary metabolites ===

Secondary in contrast to primary metabolites are dispensable and not absolutely required for survival. Furthermore, secondary metabolites typically have a narrow species distribution.

Secondary metabolites have a broad range of functions. These include pheromones that act as social signaling molecules with other individuals of the same species, communication molecules that attract and activate symbiotic organisms, agents that solubilize and transport nutrients (siderophores etc.), and competitive weapons (repellants, venoms, toxins etc.) that are used against competitors, prey, and predators. For many other secondary metabolites, the function is unknown. One hypothesis is that they confer a competitive advantage to the organism that produces them. An alternative view is that, in analogy to the immune system, these secondary metabolites have no specific function, but having the machinery in place to produce these diverse chemical structures is important and a few secondary metabolites are therefore produced and selected for.

General structural classes of secondary metabolites include alkaloids, phenylpropanoids, polyketides, and terpenoids.

== Biosynthesis ==
The biosynthetic pathways leading to the major classes of natural products are described below.

=== Carbohydrates ===
Carbohydrates are organic molecules essential for energy storage, structural support, and various biological processes in living organisms. They are produced through photosynthesis in plants or gluconeogenesis in animals and can be converted into larger polysaccharides:

* Photosynthesis or gluconeogenesis → monosaccharides → polysaccharides (cellulose, chitin, glycogen, etc.)

Carbohydrates serve as a primary energy source for most life forms. Additionally, polysaccharides derived from simpler sugars are vital structural components, forming the cell walls of bacteria and plants.

During photosynthesis, plants initially produce , a three-carbon triose. This can be converted into glucose (a six-carbon sugar) or various pentoses (five-carbon sugars) through the Calvin cycle. In animals, three-carbon precursors like lactate or glycerol are converted into pyruvate, which can then be synthesized into carbohydrates in the liver.

=== Fatty acids and polyketides ===
Fatty acids and polyketides are synthesized via the acetate pathway, which starts from basic building blocks derived from sugars:

* Sugars → acetate pathway → fatty acids and polyketides

During glycolysis, sugars are broken down into acetyl-CoA. In an ATP-dependent enzymatic reaction, acetyl-CoA is carboxylated to form malonyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA then undergo a Claisen condensation, releasing carbon dioxide to form acetoacetyl-CoA which is used by the mevalonate pathway to produce steroids. In fatty acid synthesis, one molecule of acetyl-CoA (the &quot;starter unit&quot;) and several molecules of malonyl-CoA (the &quot;extender units&quot;) are condensed by fatty acid synthase. After each round of elongation, the keto group is reduced, the intermediate alcohol dehydrated, and resulting enoyl-CoAs are reduced to acyl-CoAs. Fatty acids are essential components of lipid bilayers that form cell membranes and serve as energy storage in the form of fat in animals.

The plant-derived fatty acid linoleic acid is converted in animals through elongation and desaturation into arachidonic acid, which is then transformed into various eicosanoids, including leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and thromboxanes. These eicosanoids act as signaling molecules, playing key roles in inflammation and immune responses.

Alternatively the intermediates from additional condensation reactions are left unreduced to generate poly-β-keto chains, which are subsequently converted into various polyketides. The polyketide class of natural products has diverse structures and functions and includes important compounds such as macrolide antibiotics.

=== Aromatic amino acids and phenylpropanoids ===

The shikimate pathway is a key metabolic route responsible for the production of aromatic amino acids and their derivatives in plants, fungi, bacteria, and some protozoans:

* Shikimate pathway → aromatic amino acids and phenylpropanoids

The shikimate pathway leads to the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids (AAAs) — phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan. This pathway is vital as it connects primary metabolism to specialized metabolic processes, directing an estimated 20-50% of all fixed carbon through its reactions. It begins with the condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P), leading through several enzymatic steps to form chorismate, the precursor for all three AAAs.

From chorismate, biosynthesis branches out to produce the individual AAAs. In plants, unlike in bacteria, the production of phenylalanine and tyrosine typically occurs via the intermediate arogenate. Phenylalanine serves as the starting point for the phenylpropanoid pathway, which leads to a diverse array of secondary metabolites.

Beyond protein synthesis, AAAs and their derivatives have crucial roles in plant physiology, including pigment production, hormone synthesis, cell wall formation, and defense against various stresses. Because animals cannot synthesize these amino acids, the shikimate pathway has also become a target for herbicides, most notably glyphosate, which inhibits one of the key enzymes in this pathway.

=== Terpenoids and steroids ===

The biosynthesis of terpenoids and steroids involves two primary pathways, which produce essential building blocks for these compounds:

* Mevalonate pathway and methylerythritol phosphate pathway → terpenoids and steroids

The mevalonate (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways produce the five-carbon units isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), which are the building blocks for all terpenoids.

The MVA pathway, discovered in the 1950s, functions in eukaryotes, some bacteria, and plants. It converts acetyl-CoA to IPP via HMG-CoA and mevalonate, and is essential for steroid biosynthesis. Statins, which lower cholesterol, work by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase in this pathway. The MEP pathway, found in bacteria, some parasites, and plant chloroplasts, starts with pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to produce IPP and DMAPP. This pathway is crucial for the synthesis of plastid terpenoids like carotenoids and chlorophylls. Both pathways converge at IPP and DMAPP, which combine to form longer prenyl diphosphates like geranyl (C10), farnesyl (C15), and geranylgeranyl (C20). These compounds serve as precursors for a wide range of terpenoids, including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and triterpenes.

The diversity of terpenoids arises from modifications such as cyclization, oxidation, and glycosylation, enabling them to play roles in plant defense, pollinator attraction, and signaling. Steroids, primarily synthesized via the MVA pathway, are derived from farnesyl diphosphate through intermediates like squalene and lanosterol, which are precursors to cholesterol and other steroid molecules.

=== Alkaloids ===

Alkaloids are nitrogen-containing organic compounds produced by plants through complex biosynthetic pathways, starting from amino acids. The biosynthesis of alkaloids from amino acids is essential for producing many biologically active compounds in plants. These compounds range from simple cycloaliphatic amines to complex polycyclic nitrogen heterocycles.

Alkaloid biosynthesis generally follows four key steps: (i) synthesis of an amine precursor, (ii) synthesis of an aldehyde precursor, (iii) formation of an iminium cation, and (iv) a Mannich-like reaction. These steps form the core structure of many alkaloids and represent the initial committed steps in their production. Amino acids such as tryptophan, tyrosine, lysine, arginine, and ornithine serve as essential precursors. Their accumulation is facilitated by mechanisms like increased gene expression, gene duplication, or the evolution of enzymes with broader substrate specificities. The biosynthesis of the tropane alkaloid cocaine follows this general pathway.

A key reaction in alkaloid biosynthesis is the Pictet-Spengler reaction, which is crucial for forming the β-carboline structure found in many alkaloids. This reaction involves the condensation of an aldehyde with an amine, as seen in the biosynthesis of strictosidine, a precursor to numerous monoterpene indole alkaloids.

Oxidoreductases, including cytochrome P450s and flavin-containing monooxygenases, play a vital role in modifying the core alkaloid structures through oxidation, contributing to their structural diversity and bioactivity. For instance, in the biosynthesis of morphine, oxidative coupling is essential for forming the complex polycyclic structures typical of these alkaloids. The biosynthetic pathways of alkaloids involve numerous enzymatic steps. For example, tropane alkaloids, derived from ornithine, undergo processes such as decarboxylation, oxidation, and cyclization. Similarly, the biosynthesis of isoquinoline alkaloids from tyrosine involves complex transformations, including the formation of (S)-reticuline, a key intermediate in the pathway.

=== Peptides, proteins, and other amino acid derivatives ===

Biosynthesis of peptides, proteins, and other amino acid derivatives assembles amino acids into biologically active molecules, producing compounds like peptide hormones, modified peptides, and plant-derived substances.

Peptides and proteins are synthesized through protein synthesis or translation, a process involving transcription of DNA into messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA serves as a template for protein assembly on ribosomes. During translation, transfer RNA (tRNA) carries specific amino acids to match with mRNA codons, forming peptide bonds to create the protein chain.

Peptide hormones, such as oxytocin and vasopressin, are short amino acid chains that regulate physiological processes, including social bonding and water retention. Modified peptides include antibiotics like penicillins and cephalosporins, characterized by their β-lactam ring structure, which is essential for their antibacterial activity. These compounds undergo complex enzymatic modifications during biosynthesis.

Cyanogenic glycosides are amino acid derivatives in plants that can release hydrogen cyanide when tissues are damaged, serving as a defense mechanism. Their biosynthesis involves converting amino acids into cyanohydrins, which are then glycosylated. Glucosinolates are sulfur-containing compounds in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and mustard. Their biosynthesis starts with amino acids such as methionine or tryptophan and involves adding sulfur and glucose groups. When tissues are damaged, glucosinolates break down into isothiocyanates, which contribute to the pungent flavors of these vegetables and offer potential health benefits.

== Sources ==
Natural products may be extracted from the cells, tissues, and secretions of microorganisms, plants and animals. A crude (unfractionated) extract from any one of these sources will contain a range of structurally diverse and often novel chemical compounds. Chemical diversity in nature is based on biological diversity, so researchers collect samples from around the world to analyze and evaluate in drug discovery screens or bioassays. This effort to search for biologically active natural products is known as bioprospecting.

Pharmacognosy provides the tools to detect, isolate and identify bioactive natural products that could be developed for medicinal use. When an &quot;active principle&quot; is isolated from a traditional medicine or other biological material, this is known as a &quot;hit&quot;. Subsequent scientific and legal work is then performed to validate the hit (e.g. elucidation of mechanism of action, confirmation that there is no intellectual property conflict). This is followed by the hit to lead stage of drug discovery, where derivatives of the active compound are produced in an attempt to improve its potency and safety. In this and related ways, modern medicines can be developed directly from natural sources.

Although traditional medicines and other biological material are considered an excellent source of novel compounds, the extraction and isolation of these compounds can be a slow, expensive and inefficient process. For large scale manufacture therefore, attempts may be made to produce the new compound by total synthesis or semisynthesis. Because natural products are generally secondary metabolites with complex chemical structures, their total/semisynthesis is not always commercially viable. In these cases, efforts can be made to design simpler analogues with comparable potency and safety that are amenable to total/semisynthesis.

=== Prokaryotic ===

==== Bacteria ====
The serendipitous discovery and subsequent clinical success of penicillin prompted a large-scale search for other environmental microorganisms that might produce anti-infective natural products. Soil and water samples were collected from all over the world, leading to the discovery of streptomycin (derived from &quot;Streptomyces griseus&quot;), and the realization that bacteria, not just fungi, represent an important source of pharmacologically active natural products. This, in turn, led to the development of an impressive arsenal of antibacterial and antifungal agents including amphotericin B, chloramphenicol, daptomycin and tetracycline (from &quot;Streptomyces&quot; spp.), the polymyxins (from &quot;Paenibacillus polymyxa&quot;), and the rifamycins (from &quot;Amycolatopsis rifamycinica&quot;). Antiparasitic and antiviral drugs have similarly been derived from bacterial metabolites.

Although most of the drugs derived from bacteria are employed as anti-infectives, some have found use in other fields of medicine. Botulinum toxin (from &quot;Clostridium botulinum&quot;) and bleomycin (from &quot;Streptomyces verticillus&quot;) are two examples. Botulinum, the neurotoxin responsible for botulism, can be injected into specific muscles (such as those controlling the eyelid) to prevent muscle spasm. Also, the glycopeptide bleomycin is used for the treatment of several cancers including Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, head and neck cancer, and testicular cancer. Newer trends in the field include the metabolic profiling and isolation of natural products from novel bacterial species present in underexplored environments. Examples include symbionts or endophytes from tropical environments, subterranean bacteria found deep underground via mining/drilling, and marine bacteria.

==== Archaea ====

Because many Archaea have adapted to life in extreme environments such as polar regions, hot springs, acidic springs, alkaline springs, salt lakes, and the high pressure of deep ocean water, they possess enzymes that are functional under quite unusual conditions. These enzymes are of potential use in the food, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries, where biotechnological processes frequently involve high temperatures, extremes of pH, high salt concentrations, and / or high pressure. Examples of enzymes identified to date include amylases, pullulanases, cyclodextrin glycosyltransferases, cellulases, xylanases, chitinases, proteases, alcohol dehydrogenase, and esterases. Archaea represent a source of novel chemical compounds also, for example isoprenyl glycerol ethers 1 and 2 from &quot;Thermococcus&quot; S557 and &quot;Methanocaldococcus jannaschii&quot;, respectively.

=== Eukaryotic ===
==== Fungi ====
Several anti-infective medications have been derived from fungi including penicillin and the cephalosporins (antibacterial drugs from &quot;Penicillium rubens&quot; and &quot;Cephalosporium acremonium&quot;, respectively) and griseofulvin (an antifungal drug from &quot;Penicillium griseofulvum&quot;). Other medicinally useful fungal metabolites include lovastatin (from &quot;Pleurotus ostreatus&quot;), which became a lead for a series of drugs that lower cholesterol levels, cyclosporin (from &quot;Tolypocladium inflatum&quot;), which is used to suppress the immune response after organ transplant operations, and ergometrine (from &quot;Claviceps&quot; spp.), which acts as a vasoconstrictor, and is used to prevent bleeding after childbirth. Asperlicin (from &quot;Aspergillus alliaceus&quot;) is another example. Asperlicin is a novel antagonist of cholecystokinin, a neurotransmitter thought to be involved in panic attacks, and could potentially be used to treat anxiety.

==== Plants ====
Plants are a major source of complex and highly structurally diverse chemical compounds (phytochemicals), this structural diversity attributed in part to the natural selection of organisms producing compounds to deter herbivory (feeding deterrents). Major classes of phytochemical include phenols, polyphenols, tannins, terpenes, and alkaloids. Though the number of plants that have been extensively studied is relatively small, many pharmacologically active natural products have already been identified. Clinically useful examples include the anticancer agents paclitaxel and omacetaxine mepesuccinate (from &quot;Taxus brevifolia&quot; and &quot;Cephalotaxus harringtonii&quot;, respectively), the antimalarial agent artemisinin (from &quot;Artemisia annua&quot;), and the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor galantamine (from &quot;Galanthus&quot; spp.), used to treat Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Other plant-derived drugs, used medicinally and/or recreationally include morphine, cocaine, quinine, tubocurarine, muscarine, and nicotine.

==== Animals ====
Animals also represent a source of bioactive natural products. In particular, venomous animals such as snakes, spiders, scorpions, caterpillars, bees, wasps, centipedes, ants, toads, and frogs have attracted much attention. This is because venom constituents (peptides, enzymes, nucleotides, lipids, biogenic amines etc.) often have very specific interactions with a macromolecular target in the body (e.g. α-bungarotoxin from cobras). As with plant feeding deterrents, this biological activity is attributed to natural selection, organisms capable of killing or paralyzing their prey and/or defending themselves against predators being more likely to survive and reproduce.

Because of these specific chemical-target interactions, venom constituents have proved important tools for studying receptors, ion channels, and enzymes. In some cases, they have also served as leads in the development of novel drugs. For example, teprotide, a peptide isolated from the venom of the Brazilian pit viper &quot;Bothrops jararaca&quot;, was a lead in the development of the antihypertensive agents cilazapril and captopril. Also, echistatin, a disintegrin from the venom of the saw-scaled viper &quot;Echis carinatus&quot; was a lead in the development of the antiplatelet drug tirofiban.

In addition to the terrestrial animals and amphibians described above, many marine animals have been examined for pharmacologically active natural products, with corals, sponges, tunicates, sea snails, and bryozoans yielding chemicals with interesting analgesic, antiviral, and anticancer activities. Two examples developed for clinical use include ω-conotoxin (from the marine snail &quot;Conus magus&quot;) and ecteinascidin 743 (from the tunicate &quot;Ecteinascidia turbinata&quot;). The former, ω-conotoxin, is used to relieve severe and chronic pain, while the latter, ecteinascidin 743 is used to treat metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. Other natural products derived from marine animals and under investigation as possible therapies include the antitumour agents discodermolide (from the sponge &quot;Discodermia dissoluta&quot;), eleutherobin (from the coral &quot;Erythropodium caribaeorum&quot;), and the bryostatins (from the bryozoan &quot;Bugula neritina&quot;).

== Medical uses ==

Natural products sometimes have pharmacological activity that can be of therapeutic benefit in treating diseases. Moreover, synthetic analogs of natural products with improved potency and safety can be prepared, and therefore, natural products are often used as starting points for drug discovery. Natural product constituents have inspired numerous drug discovery efforts that eventually gained approval as new drugs.

=== Modern natural product-derived drugs ===
Many prescribed drugs have been either directly derived from or inspired by natural products. Approximately 35% of the annual global market of medicine is either from natural products or related drugs. This breaks down as 25% from plants, 13% from microorganisms, and 3% from animal sources.

Between 1981 and 2019, the FDA approved 1,881 new chemical entities, of which 65 (3.5%) were unaltered natural products, 99 (5.3%) were defined mixture botanical drugs, 178 (9.5%) were natural product derivatives, and 164 (8.7%) were synthetic compounds containing natural product pharmacophores. Altogether, this accounts for 506 (26.9%) of all new approved drugs. Additionally, natural products and their derivatives often show higher success rates in later clinical trial phases and may have lower toxicity profiles compared to synthetic compounds.

Some of the oldest natural product based drugs are analgesics. The bark of the willow tree has been known since antiquity to have pain-relieving properties due to the natural product salicin, which in turn may be hydrolyzed into salicylic acid. A synthetic derivative acetylsalicylic acid better known as &quot;aspirin&quot; is a widely used pain reliever. Its mechanism of action is inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme. Another notable example is opium extracted from the latex of &quot;Papaver somniferous&quot; (a flowering poppy plant). The most potent narcotic component of opium is the alkaloid morphine, which acts as an opioid receptor agonist. The N-type calcium channel blocker ziconotide is an analgesic based on a cyclic peptide cone snail toxin (ω-conotoxin MVIIA) from the species &quot;Conus magus&quot;.

Numerous anti-infectives are based on natural products. The first antibiotic to be discovered, penicillin, was isolated from the mold &quot;Penicillium&quot;. Penicillin and related beta lactams work by inhibiting the -transpeptidase enzyme that is required by bacteria to cross link peptidoglycan to form the cell wall.

Several natural product drugs target tubulin, which is a component of the cytoskeleton. These include the tubulin polymerization inhibitor colchicine isolated from the &quot;Colchicum autumnale&quot; (autumn crocus flowering plant), which is used to treat gout. Colchicine is biosynthesized from the amino acids phenylalanine and tryptophan. Paclitaxel, in contrast, is a tubulin polymerization stabilizer and is used as a chemotherapeutic drug. Paclitaxel is based on the terpenoid natural product taxol, which is isolated from &quot;Taxus brevifolia&quot; (the pacific yew tree).

A class of drugs widely used to lower cholesterol are the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, for example atorvastatin. These were developed from mevastatin, a polyketide produced by the fungus &quot;Penicillium citrinum&quot;. Finally, a number natural product drugs are used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. These include the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. Captopril is based on the peptidic bradykinin potentiating factor isolated from venom of the Brazilian arrowhead viper (&quot;Bothrops jararaca&quot;).

===Limiting and enabling factors===
Numerous challenges limit the use of natural products for drug discovery, resulting in 21st century preference by pharmaceutical companies to dedicate discovery efforts toward high-throughput screening of pure synthetic compounds with shorter timelines to refinement. Natural product sources are often unreliable to access and supply, have a high probability of duplication, inherently create intellectual property concerns about patent protection, vary in composition due to sourcing season or environment, and are susceptible to rising extinction rates.

The biological resource for drug discovery from natural products remains abundant, with small percentages of microorganisms, plant species, and insects assessed for bioactivity. In enormous numbers, bacteria and marine microorganisms remain unexamined. As of 2008, the field of metagenomics was proposed to examine genes and their function in soil microbes, but most pharmaceutical firms have not exploited this resource fully, choosing instead to develop &quot;diversity-oriented synthesis&quot; from libraries of known drugs or natural sources for lead compounds with higher potential for bioactivity.

== Isolation and purification ==
All natural products begin as mixtures with other compounds from the natural source, often very complex mixtures, from which the product of interest must be isolated and purified. The &quot;isolation&quot; of a natural product refers, depending on context, either to the isolation of sufficient quantities of pure chemical matter for chemical structure elucidation, derivitzation/degradation chemistry, biological testing, and other research needs,

Structure determination refers to methods applied to determine the chemical structure of an isolated, pure natural product. For instance, the chemical structure of penicillin was determined by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1945, work for which she later received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1964).

Modern structure determination often involves a combination of advanced analytical techniques. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography are commonly used as primary tools for structure elucidation. High-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) also plays a crucial role, providing information on molecular formula and fragmentation patterns. For complex structures, computational methods are increasingly employed to assist in structure determination. This may include computer-assisted structure elucidation (CASE) platforms and in silico fragmentation prediction tools. Determination of the absolute configuration often relies on a combination of NMR data (coupling constants and nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE), chemical derivatization methods (e.g., Mosher&#x27;s ester analysis), and spectroscopic techniques like vibrational circular dichroism (VCD), and optical rotatory dispersion (ORD). In cases where traditional methods are insufficient, especially for novel compounds with unprecedented molecular skeletons, advanced computational chemistry approaches are used to predict and compare spectral data, helping to elucidate the complete structure including stereochemistry.

== Synthesis ==
Many natural products have complex structures. The complexity is determined by factors like molecular mass, arrangement of substructures (e.g., functional groups, rings), number and density of these groups, their stability, stereochemical elements, and physical properties, as well as the novelty of the structure and prior synthetic efforts.

Less complex natural products can often be cost-effectively synthesized from simpler chemical ingredients through total synthesis. However, not all natural products are suitable for total synthesis. The most complex ones are often impractical to synthesize on a large scale due to high costs. In these cases, isolation from natural sources may be sufficient if it provides adequate quantities, as seen with drugs like penicillin, morphine, and paclitaxel, which were obtained at commercial scales without significant synthetic chemistry.

=== Semisynthesis ===
Isolating a natural product from its source can be costly in terms of time and materials, and may impact the availability of the natural resource or have ecological consequences. For example, it is estimated that harvesting enough paclitaxel for a single dose of therapy would require the bark of an entire yew tree (&quot;Taxus brevifolia&quot;). Additionally, the number of structural analogues available for structure–activity analysis (SAR) is limited by the biology of the organism, and thus beyond experimental control.

When the desired product is difficult to obtain or modify to create analogs, a middle-to-late stage biosynthetic precursor or analog can sometimes be used to produce the final target. This approach, called semisynthesis or &quot;partial synthesis,&quot; involves extracting a biosynthetic intermediate and converting it into the final product using conventional chemical synthesis techniques.

This strategy offers two advantages. First, the intermediate may be easier to extract and yield higher amounts than the final product. For instance, paclitaxel can be produced by extracting 10-deacetylbaccatin III from &quot;T. brevifolia&quot; needles, followed by a four-step synthesis. Second, the semisynthetic process allows for the creation of analogues of the final product, as seen in the development of newer generation semisynthetic penicillins.

===Total synthesis===

In general, the total synthesis of natural products is a non-commercial research activity, aimed at deeper understanding of the synthesis of particular natural product frameworks, and the development of fundamental new synthetic methods. Even so, it is of tremendous commercial and societal importance. By providing challenging synthetic targets, for example, it has played a central role in the development of the field of organic chemistry. Prior to the development of analytical chemistry methods in the twentieth century, the structures of natural products were affirmed by total synthesis (so-called &quot;structure proof by synthesis&quot;). Early efforts in natural products synthesis targeted complex substances such as cobalamin (vitamin B12), an essential cofactor in cellular metabolism.

=== Biomimetic synthesis ===

Biomimetic synthesis is a branch of organic chemistry which aims at designing and preparing natural product compounds in the laboratory using the biosynthetic pathways as a blueprint. This method is based on the mechanisms used by the living organisms for the synthesis of various compounds, which is usually done in a stereoselective and regioselective manner. Biomimetic synthetic strategies have emerged due to their ability to simplify the synthesis of complex structures, especially those containing unusual moieties like spiro-ring systems or quaternary carbon atoms. These approaches mainly involve reactions such as Diels-Alder dimerizations, photocycloadditions, cyclizations, oxidative and radical reactions and these reactions can be used to efficiently construct complex molecular frameworks. Thus, mimicking the biosynthetic processes, chemists have been able to design more effective and economical processes for the synthesis of natural products that are of interest in drug discovery and chemical biology.

===Symmetry===
Examination of dimerized and trimerized natural products has shown that an element of bilateral symmetry is often present. Bilateral symmetry refers to a molecule or system that contains a C2, Cs, or C2v point group identity. C2 symmetry tends to be much more abundant than other types of bilateral symmetry. This finding sheds light on how these compounds might be mechanistically created, as well as providing insight into the thermodynamic properties that make these compounds more favorable. Density functional theory (DFT), the Hartree–Fock method, and semiempirical calculations also show some favorability for dimerization in natural products due to evolution of more energy per bond than the equivalent trimer or tetramer. This is proposed to be due to steric hindrance at the core of the molecule, as most natural products dimerize and trimerize in a head-to-head fashion rather than head-to-tail.

Research and teaching activities related to natural products fall into a number of diverse academic areas, including organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, pharmacognosy, ethnobotany, traditional medicine, and ethnopharmacology. Other biological areas include chemical biology, chemical ecology, chemogenomics, systems biology, molecular modeling, chemometrics, and chemoinformatics.

=== Chemistry ===

Natural products chemistry is a distinct area of chemical research which was important in the development and history of chemistry. Isolating and identifying natural products has been important to source substances for early preclinical drug discovery research, to understand traditional medicine and ethnopharmacology, and to find pharmacologically useful areas of chemical space. To achieve this, many technological advances have been made, such as the evolution of technology associated with chemical separations, and the development of modern methods in chemical structure determination such as NMR. Early attempts to understand the biosynthesis of natural products, saw chemists employ first radiolabelling and more recently stable isotope labeling combined with NMR experiments. In addition, natural products are prepared by organic synthesis, to provide confirmation of their structure, or to give access to larger quantities of natural products of interest. In this process, the structure of some natural products have been revised, and the challenge of synthesising natural products has led to the development of new synthetic methodology, synthetic strategy, and tactics. In this regard, natural products play a central role in the training of new synthetic organic chemists, and are a principal motivation in the development of new variants of old chemical reactions (e.g., the Evans aldol reaction), as well as the discovery of completely new chemical reactions (e.g., the Woodward cis-hydroxylation, Sharpless epoxidation, and Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions).

== History ==


=== Foundations of organic and natural product chemistry ===

The concept of natural products dates back to the early 19th century, when the foundations of organic chemistry were laid. Organic chemistry was regarded at that time as the chemistry of substances that plants and animals are composed of. It was a relatively complex form of chemistry and stood in stark contrast to inorganic chemistry, the principles of which had been established in 1789 by the Frenchman Antoine Lavoisier in his work &quot;Traité Élémentaire de Chimie&quot;.

=== Isolation ===
Lavoisier showed at the end of the 18th century that organic substances consisted of a limited number of elements: primarily carbon and hydrogen and supplemented by oxygen and nitrogen. He quickly focused on the isolation of these substances, often because they had an interesting pharmacological activity. Plants were the main source of such compounds, especially alkaloids and glycosides. It was long been known that opium, a sticky mixture of alkaloids (including codeine, morphine, noscapine, thebaine, and papaverine) from the opium poppy (&quot;Papaver somniferum&quot;), possessed a narcotic and at the same time mind-altering properties. By 1805, morphine had already been isolated by the German chemist Friedrich Sertürner and in the 1870s it was discovered that boiling morphine with acetic anhydride produced a substance with a strong pain suppressive effect: heroin. In 1815, Eugène Chevreul isolated cholesterol, a crystalline substance, from animal tissue that belongs to the class of steroids, and in 1819 strychnine, an alkaloid was isolated.

=== Synthesis ===

A second important step was the synthesis of organic compounds. While the synthesis of inorganic substances had been known for a long time, creating organic substances was a major challenge. In 1827, the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius argued that a vital force or life force was essential for synthesizing organic compounds. This idea, known as vitalism, had many supporters well into the 19th century, even after the introduction of atomic theory. Vitalism also aligned with traditional medicine, which often viewed disease as a result of imbalances in vital energies that distinguish life from nonlife.

The first significant challenge to vitalism came in 1828 when German chemist Friedrich Wöhler synthesized urea, a natural product found in urine, by heating ammonium cyanate, an inorganic substance:

:formula_1

This reaction demonstrated that a life force was not needed to create organic substances. Initially, this idea faced skepticism, but it gained acceptance 20 years later when Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe synthesized acetic acid from carbon disulfide. Since then, organic chemistry has developed into a distinct field focused on studying carbon-containing compounds, which were found to be prevalent in nature.

=== Structural theories ===

The third key development was the structure elucidation of organic substances. While the elemental composition of pure organic compounds could be determined accurately, their molecular structures remained unclear. This issue became evident in a dispute between Friedrich Wöhler and Justus von Liebig, who studied silver salts with identical compositions but different properties. Wöhler examined silver cyanate, a harmless compound, while von Liebig investigated the explosive silver fulminate. Elemental analysis showed both salts had the same amounts of silver, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, yet their properties differed, contradicting the prevailing view that composition alone determined properties.

This discrepancy was explained by Berzelius&#x27;s theory of isomers, which proposed that not only the number and type of elements but also the arrangement of atoms affects a compound&#x27;s properties. This insight led to the development of structural theories, such as the radical theory of Jean-Baptiste Dumas and the substitution theory of Auguste Laurent. A definitive structure theory was proposed in 1858 by August Kekulé, who suggested that carbon is tetravalent and can bond to itself, forming chains found in natural products.

=== Expanding the concept ===

The concept of natural product, which initially based on organic compounds that could be isolated from plants, was extended to include animal material in the middle of the 19th century by the German Justus von Liebig. Hermann Emil Fischer in 1884, turned his attention to the study of carbohydrates and purines, work for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1902. He also succeeded to make synthetically in the laboratory in a variety of carbohydrates, including glucose and mannose. After the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928, fungi and other micro-organisms were added to the arsenal of sources of natural products.

=== Milestones ===

By the 1930s, several major classes of natural products had been identified and studied extensively. Key milestones in the field of natural product research include:

* Terpenes: First systematically studied by Otto Wallach (Nobel Prize 1910) and later by Leopold Ružička (Nobel Prize 1939). 
* Porphyrin-based dyes: Including chlorophyll and heme, investigated by Richard Willstätter (Nobel Prize 1915) and Hans Fischer (Nobel Prize 1930). These tetrapyrrole compounds play essential roles in various biological processes (including photosynthesis, respiration, electron transfer, and catalysis) and have been the subject of extensive research.
* Steroids: Researched by Heinrich Otto Wieland (Nobel Prize 1927) and Adolf Windaus (Nobel Prize 1928). Their work contributed significantly to our understanding of sterol biosynthesis and structure.
* Carotenoids: Studied by Paul Karrer (Nobel Prize 1937). These pigments are important for their antioxidant properties and roles in photosynthesis and vision.
* Vitamins: Investigated by numerous scientists, including Paul Karrer, Robert R. Williams, Adolf Windaus (Nobel Prize 1928), Norman Haworth (Nobel Prize 1937), Richard Kuhn (Nobel Prize 1938), and Albert Szent-Györgyi (Nobel Prize 1937). The discovery and characterization of vitamins revolutionized our understanding of nutrition and health.
* Steroid hormones: Studied by Adolf Butenandt (Nobel Prize 1939) and Edward Calvin Kendall (Nobel Prize 1950). Their work on steroid hormones paved the way for modern endocrinology.
* Alkaloids and anthocyanins: Researched by Robert Robinson (Nobel Prize 1947) and others. These compounds, particularly alkaloids, have been crucial in the development of many pharmaceuticals.
* Polypeptide hormones: Investigated by Vincent du Vigneaud (Nobel Prize 1955) who completed the first total synthesis of the natural polypeptide oxytocin and vasopressin.
* Total synthesis of natural products: Robert Burns Woodward was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1965 for synthesizing compounds including quinine, cholesterol, cortisone, strychnine, reserpine, chlorophyll, and vitamin B12. Elias James Corey received a Nobel Prize in 1990 for similar achievements, such as the synthesis of gibberellic acid, ginkgolide, and prostaglandins.

These pioneering studies laid the foundation for our understanding of natural product chemistry and biochemistry, leading to numerous Nobel Prizes in Chemistry and Physiology or Medicine. The field of natural products has continued to evolve, with recent research focusing on the evolutionary and ecological roles of these compounds.

<doc id="1209762" wikidata="Q3279830" url="?curid=1209762" title="Touch (Sarah McLachlan album)">
<text>Touch is the debut album by Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan. It was originally released on October 11, 1988 through Nettwerk and Capitol Records. The album was then re-released on April 3, 1989 through Nettwerk and Arista Records with additional material and new cover art. The album includes &quot;Vox&quot;, McLachlan&#x27;s debut single, which reached number 90 in Canada upon its release.

McLachlan did not achieve commercial stardom until 1991 in Canada, with &quot;Solace&quot;, and 1994–1995 internationally, with her 1993 album &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot;. In 1993, McLachlan and Nettwerk were sued by Darryl Neudorf, a Vancouver musician and former member of 54-40, who alleged that he had made a significant and uncredited contribution to the songwriting on &quot;Touch&quot;. Although both McLachlan and Nettwerk acknowledged that Neudorf was involved in the album&#x27;s production, both took the position that his contribution had not been primarily in songwriting. The judge in that suit ultimately ruled in McLachlan&#x27;s favor.

<text>John Buchanan Floyd (June 1, 1806 – August 26, 1863) was an American politician who served as the 31st Governor of Virginia. Under president James Buchanan, he also served as the U.S. Secretary of War from 1857 to 1860. Floyd is also known as the Confederate general in the American Civil War who lost the crucial Battle of Fort Donelson.

==Early family life==
John Buchanan Floyd was born on June 1, 1806, on the Smithfield plantation near Blacksburg, Virginia. He was the eldest son of the former Laetitia Preston and her husband, Governor John Floyd (1783–1837). His brother, Benjamin Rush Floyd (1812–1860), served in both houses of the Virginia General Assembly but failed to win the election to the U.S. Congress. His sister Nicketti (1819–1908) married U.S. Senator John Warfield Johnston; his sisters Letitia Preston Floyd Lewis (1814–1886) and Eliza Lavallette Floyd Holmes (1816–1887) also survived their brothers. The elder Floyd served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1817 to 1829 and as governor of Virginia from 1830 to 1834.

Young Floyd, who was of English, Welsh, Scottish, and Irish heritage, graduated from South Carolina College in 1826 (by some accounts 1829), where he was a member of the Euphradian Society.

He married his cousin, Sarah (Sally) Buchanan Preston (1802–1879), daughter of Francis Preston, on June 1, 1830. They had no children. Some claimed Floyd had a daughter, Josephine, who married Robert James Harlan in 1852. Kentucky politician James Harlan enslaved Harlan, who may have been James&#x27; son. In the 1850s, Robert Harlan lived free in Cincinnati, Ohio.

==Career==
Admitted to the Virginia bar in 1828, Floyd practiced law in his native state and at Helena, Arkansas, where he lost a large fortune and his health in a cotton-planting venture.

In 1839, Floyd returned to Virginia and settled in Washington County. Voters elected him to the Abingdon town council in 1843 and the Virginia House of Delegates in 1847, and he won re-election once, then resigned in 1849 upon being elected governor of Virginia. As governor, Floyd commissioned the monument to President George Washington in Virginia Capitol Square, and laid the cornerstone in the presence of President Zachary Taylor on February 22, 1850. The second Governor Floyd also recommended the Virginia General Assembly pass a law taxing imports from states that refused to surrender fugitives from Virginian enslavers, which would have violated the Interstate Commerce Clause.

When he left statewide office in 1852, Washington County voters again elected him to the Virginia House of Delegates. Floyd also bought the &quot;Abington Democrat&quot; from Leonidas Baugh when the paper&#x27;s founder won appointment as postmaster, and he had J.M.H. Brunet of Petersburg publish it, but Brunet died, and the paper was sold at auction to pay the debts incurred by its next printer, Stephen Pendleton, in 1857.

Active in Democratic Party politics, the former governor was a presidential elector for James Buchanan after the presidential election of 1856.

==Secretary of War==

In March 1857, Floyd became Secretary of War in Buchanan&#x27;s cabinet, where his lack of administrative ability was soon apparent, including the poor execution of the Utah Expedition. Floyd is implicated in the scandal of the &quot;Abstracted Indian Bonds&quot;, which broke at the end of 1860 as the Buchanan administration was reaching its end. His wife&#x27;s nephew Godard Bailey, who worked in the Interior Department and removed bonds from the Indian Agency safe during 1860, was also implicated. Among the recipients of the money was Russell, Majors, and Waddell, a government contractor that held, among its contracts, the Pony Express. In December 1860, on ascertaining that Floyd had honored heavy drafts made by government contractors in anticipation of their earnings, the president requested his resignation. Several days later, Floyd was indicted for malversation in office, although the indictment was overruled in 1861 on technical grounds. No proof was found that he profited from these irregular transactions; in fact, he left office financially embarrassed.

Although he had openly opposed secession before the election of Abraham Lincoln, his conduct after the election, especially after his breach with Buchanan, fell under suspicion. Despite the fact that he had been ordered to reinforce Southern forts by Buchanan, the press accused him of sending large stores of government arms to federal arsenals in the Southern United States in anticipation of the Civil War.

Ulysses Grant, in his postwar &quot;Personal Memoirs&quot;, wrote:

After his resignation, a congressional commission in the summer and fall of 1861 investigated Floyd&#x27;s actions as Secretary of War. His records of orders and arms shipments from 1859 to 1860 were examined. In response to John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harper&#x27;s Ferry, he bolstered the federal arsenals in some Southern states by over 115,000 muskets and rifles in late 1859. He also ordered heavy ordnance to be shipped to the federal forts in Galveston Harbor, Texas, and the new fort on Ship Island off the coast of Mississippi.

He intended to send these heavy guns in the last days of his term, but the President revoked his orders.

His resignation as secretary of war on December 29, 1860, was precipitated by the refusal of Buchanan to order Major Robert Anderson to abandon Fort Sumter, which eventually led to the start of the war. On January 27, 1861, he was indicted by the District of Columbia grand jury for conspiracy and fraud. Floyd appeared in criminal court in Washington, DC, on March 7, 1861, to answer the charges against him. The indictments were thrown out.

==Civil War==

After the secession of Virginia, Floyd was commissioned a major general in the Provisional Army of Virginia, but on May 23, 1861, he was appointed a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army (CSA). He was first employed in some unsuccessful operations in the Kanawha Valley of western Virginia under Robert E. Lee, where he was both defeated and wounded in the arm at the Battle of Carnifex Ferry on September 10.

General Floyd blamed Brigadier General Henry A. Wise for the Confederate loss at the Battle of Carnifex Ferry, stating that Wise refused to come to his aid. Virginia Delegate Mason Mathews, whose son Alexander F. Mathews was Wise&#x27;s &quot;aide-de-camp&quot;, spent several days in the camps of both Wise and Floyd to seek resolution to an escalating feud between the two generals. Afterward, he wrote to President Jefferson Davis urging that both men be removed, stating, &quot;I am fully satisfied that each of them would be highly gratified to see the other annihilated.&quot; Davis subsequently removed Wise from his command of the western Virginia region, leaving Floyd as the region&#x27;s unquestioned superior officer.

In January 1862, he was dispatched to the Western Theater to report to General Albert Sidney Johnston and was given command of a division. Johnston sent Floyd to reinforce Fort Donelson and assume command of the post there. Floyd took command of Fort Donelson on February 13, just two days after the U.S. Army had arrived, becoming the third post commander within a week. Fort Donelson protected the crucial Cumberland River, and indirectly, the manufacturing city of Nashville and Confederate control of Middle Tennessee. It was the companion to Fort Henry on the nearby Tennessee River, which, on February 6, 1862, was captured by United States Army Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant and river gunboats. Floyd was not an appropriate choice to defend such a vital point, having political influence but virtually no military experience. General Johnston had other experienced, more senior generals (P.G.T. Beauregard and William J. Hardee) available and made a severe error in selecting Floyd. Floyd had little military influence on the Battle of Fort Donelson itself, deferring to his more experienced subordinates, Brigadier Generals Gideon Johnson Pillow and Simon Bolivar Buckner. As the U.S. forces surrounded the fort and the town of Dover, the Confederates launched an assault on February 15 to open an escape route. Although successful initially, indecision on General Pillow&#x27;s part left the Confederates in their trenches, facing growing reinforcements for Grant.

Early in the morning of February 16, at a council of war, the generals and field officers decided to surrender their army. Floyd, concerned that he would be arrested for treason if captured by the U.S. Army, turned his command over to Pillow, who immediately turned it over to Buckner. Colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest and his entire Tennessee cavalry regiment escaped while Pillow escaped on a small boat across the Cumberland. The next morning, Floyd fled by steamboat with the 36th Virginia and 51st Virginia Infantry regiments, two artillery batteries, and elements of the other units from his old command. He safely reached Nashville, escaping just before Buckner surrendered to Grant in one of the most significant strategic defeats of the Civil War. A short time before daylight the two steamboats arrived. Without loss of time the general (Floyd) hastened to the river, embarked with his Virginians, and at an early hour cast loose from the shore, and in good time, and safely, he reached Nashville. He never satisfactorily explained upon what principles he appropriated all the transportation on to the use of his particular command. Floyd was relieved of his command by Confederate President Davis, without a court of inquiry, on March 11, 1862. He resumed his commission as a major general of the Virginia Militia. However, his health soon failed, and he died a year later at Abingdon, Virginia, where he was buried in Sinking Spring Cemetery.

==In memoriam==
Floyd County in northwest Georgia, home to the cities of Rome and Cave Spring, is named for his relative, United States Congressman John Floyd.

Camp Floyd, a U.S. Army post near Fairfield, Utah from July 1858 to July 1861, was initially named after Floyd.

<text>Zibeline ( or ) is a thick, soft fabric with a long nap. It is usually made of wool, such as mohair or alpaca, but can also be made from the hair of other animals, such as camels.

Zibeline can also refer either to the sable (&quot;Martes zibellina&quot;) or to its pelt, from which zibeline was originally made.

Zibeline can also refer to a heavy silk fabric with a twill weave, very similar to Mikado. The noted apricot dress designed by Oleg Cassini for U.S. First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was made in silk zibeline.

<doc id="1209780" wikidata="Q16999385" url="?curid=1209780" title="Time-and-a-half">
<text>Time-and-a-half is payment to a worker (or workers) at 1.5 times their usual hourly rate. It is usually paid as an incentive to work on a particular day (such as Saturday) or as government-mandated compensation for having workers work on particular days (such as public holidays).

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, if an employee works on a public holiday, the employee gets time-and-a-half for the hours worked and, if the day was an otherwise working day for the employee, an alternative holiday to take at another time.

==United States==
In the United States, this provision, as well as the minimum wage, was first instituted by the Fair Labor Standards Act. The act was passed in 1938, during the Great Depression. Overtime pay was intended as a penalty or fine upon the employer, not as a bonus to the employee. Hoping to increase employment opportunities, Congress encouraged employers to hire more workers for the same amount of time: it was believed to be better for three workers to work forty hours per week than for two workers to work for sixty hours per week.

<doc id="1209790" wikidata="Q2254396" url="?curid=1209790" title="Viaccess">
<text>Viaccess is a conditional access system edit by Orange S.A. There are six versions in use today, Viaccess PC2.3, Viaccess PC2.4, Viaccess PC2.5, Viaccess PC2.6, Viaccess ACS3.x/Prime Sentinel, Viaccess ACS4.1, Viaccess ACS5.0, and Viaccess ACS6.x/Adaptive Sentinel.

Viaccess was developed as the digital version of the EuroCrypt system used with the hybrid MAC system,

The first version is sometimes referred to as Viaccess 1, and the latter three, although different, as Viaccess 2. PC2.3 and PC2.4 are known to be ineffective, and many set-top boxes can be &#x27;patched&#x27; to decrypt Viaccess signals without payment, however PC2.5 and PC2.6 are secure, with PC2.5 remaining secure two years after its first commercial deployment. PC2.6 was introduced at the end of 2005. PC3.0 was introduced during mid-2007.

There are two modifications of Viaccess PC2.3 in use. The first, known as TPS Crypt, is used by TPS. Despite being compromised also, the TPS Crypt system has been further modified to use Advanced Encryption System (AES) keys. These AES keys were originally updated once weekly, however after this inconvenienced unauthorised viewers little, a second TPS crypt system was introduced, by which keys are changed every 12 minutes, with keys being sent over TPS&#x27;s internal Open TV system. This therefore meant that only TPS receivers could receive the new AES key, and not the insecure TPS subscription cards. Monitoring and analysing of the keys by hacking groups, however, has brought about key lists, where the AES keys have been successfully predicted. Implementation of this procedure of automatically updating keys has proved difficult, if not impossible, to implement on many satellite receivers, rendering the TPS Crypt AES system a general success.

In 2008, Viaccess acquired Orca interactive and in 2012 they merge under the name Viaccess-Orca, which specializes in video content security and anti-piracy, OTT &amp; IPTV platforms and targeted TV advertising. 
The second Viaccess modification, called ThalesCrypt, is used by Canal Satellite France to protect its contents on the transport network to the head-ends of the cable networks; it is an over-encryption mechanism of the original protocol encryption keys.

Viaccess is currently used by a large number of providers. These include:
* Some programs
* ART
* NTV
* Televisa Networks
* Canal Satellite France
* FRANSAT
* AB Sat
* ETTV
* TBLTV
* Home2US
* Orange TV Romania
* Orange Polska
* YouSee
* Croatian Radiotelevision
* RTV Slovenija
* Skylink Czechia/Slovakia
* SRG SSR idée suisse
* Cyfrowy Polsat
* Platforma Canal+

Viaccess is the 3rd largest conditional access system provider in the world (in 2004).

Viaccess is also a subsidiary of Orange S.A. which offers pay TV and digital rights management enabled software.

Orca Interactive is a subsidiary of Viaccess which offers IPTV Middleware since 2008.

<text>The New York University College of Dentistry is the dentistry school of New York University. As the third oldest dentistry school in the United States, it offers both graduate programs and clinical training in oral healthcare.

==History==
The College of Dentistry was founded in 1865 as the &quot;New York College of Dentistry.&quot; It merged with NYU in 1925. NYU Dentistry is the third oldest continuously operating and the largest dental school in the United States. In 1957, the College moved into its present home on First Avenue, which in 1965 was named the &quot;K. B. Weissman Clinical Science Building&quot;. In 1978, the &quot;Arnold and Marie Schwartz Hall of Dental Sciences&quot; was completed. In 1987, New York University dedicated the David B. Kriser Dental Center. In 2002, the &quot;Leonard I. Bluestone Center for Clinical Research&quot; opened - the only dental school-based research center that provides beds for 24-hour patient monitoring.
In fall of 2005, NYU&#x27;s Division of Nursing moved from the Steinhardt School of Education to form the College of Nursing within the College of Dentistry.
In 2015, a new joint 170,000 square foot building for Dentistry, Nursing, and the Bioengineering Institute was opened. In aggregate, the College of Dentistry occupies 27 floors distributed among five buildings.

==Facilities==
The College of Dentistry is located on First Avenue between East 24th and 26th Streets, about 6 blocks south of the NYU School of Medicine. The College&#x27;s facilities include the &quot;Schwartz Hall of Dental Sciences,&quot; the &quot;K. B. Weissman Clinical Science Building&quot;, the new 13 floor interdisciplinary building at 433 First Avenue, four newly renovated floors at 137 25th Street, and one floor at 380 First Avenue. These house classrooms, patient clinics, research and teaching facilities, and administrative offices, as well as a state-of-the-art Learning Commons for dentistry, dental hygiene, nursing, and engineering students and an Executive Conference Suite. Clinical facilities include 506 dental operatories. The operatories are designed in modules, each containing a waiting room, offices, X-ray facilities, and a seminar room for instruction and consultation. These facilities enable the College to provide oral health care for thousands of New Yorkers. The address shown in the caption for the figure below is incorrect, the building shown is on East 24th street, not East 25th street.

==Library==

The College of Dentistry maintains one of the largest rare book dental libraries, close to 1000 volumes, the legacy of Dr. Bernhard Wolf Weinberger, a dental historian, orthodontist and a faculty member in the 1930s. Its collection includes a first edition of the Pierre Fauchard &quot;Le Chirurgien Dentist&quot; (1728), one second edition (1746) and a third edition (1786). Other volumes include works by Bartolomeo Eustachio, 1563 edition of &quot;De Libellus de Dentibus&quot;, 1546 and 1547 editions of Artzneybuch (The Little Medicinal Book for All Kinds of Diseases and Infirmities of the Teeth), one of the first German dentally-related book. The original library, founded in 1909 and named the &quot;Waldmann Memorial Library&quot; in 1978 was digitized and modernized in 2015. The College of Dentistry has moved its &quot;library&quot; into the newly opened Dental-Nursing-Biomaterials joint interprofessional building at 433 First Avenue. The building has a large study area for all students but it no longer houses books. The students have 24 hour access to the study area.

==E-Curriculum==
Since 2001, NYU Dentistry has replaced traditional textbooks with a collection of digitalized textbooks. All required materials are available to students through a computer-enhanced curriculum. The new technology gives each student a license for all of the textbooks in the curriculum. In addition to traditional textbook content, students are able to view slide presentations and video streams of lab and clinical procedures and do full text searches on their materials.

<doc id="1209794" wikidata="Q5894774" url="?curid=1209794" title="Hong Kong International School">
<text>Hong Kong International School (HKIS) is a co-educational private international school in Hong Kong with campuses in Tai Tam and Repulse Bay, serving students from Reception 1 to Grade 12. The Repulse Bay campus houses the Lower and Upper Primary Divisions, while Tai Tam houses the Middle and High School Divisions.

Hong Kong International School is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and is a member of the East Asia Regional Conference of Overseas Schools (EARCOS). HKIS participates in the Asia Pacific Activities Conference (APAC).

The school has been continuously recognized since 2020 by The Schools Index as one of the world&#x27;s 150 leading schools and amongst top 15 in China and Southeast Asia.

==History==
In 1964, a Hong Kong-based committee of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) first submitted a proposal to have the school built. The Repulse Bay Lutheran Church and School Project conducted a survey of Americans in July 1964. The results showed the majority of respondents were in favor of establishing an American school, with 100 new families anticipated to arrive each year.

In 1965, the Board of Missions of the LCMS and the Hong Kong Education Department approved a land grant and loan for the construction of the school. The LCMS matched the land grant with its own grant and loan, and the American business community in Hong Kong raised additional capital.

With the establishment of regional headquarters of the Dow Chemical Company and Pan Am in Hong Kong, a number of American families arrived in 1966. The HKIS Board of Managers agreed to establish and open an “HKIS Provisional Elementary School” program for the 1966–1967 school year in a leased apartment building at Chung Hom Kok with a capacity for 195 students.

In April 1966, the groundbreaking ceremony was held for the first permanent school building in Repulse Bay, with a capacity for 630 pupils. The campus included a cafeteria, library, and gymnasium. It became the first school in Hong Kong with a U.S. education program. The school facilities were completed in 1967, with the Church of All Nations also located on the campus.

HKIS officially opened in Repulse Bay in 1967, with more than 600 students in kindergarten through to grade 12. By 1969 this had grown to 900 students from 26 nationalities, with 80% being U.S. citizens. The campus was as dedicated in 1975. In the 1970s the school had both American students and students of other nationalities. In 1971, HKIS became WASC accredited, five years after the school opened.

In 1985, the Hong Kong Government approved a land grant in Tai Tam. The groundbreaking ceremony for the new campus was held in 1986. The campus was completed in 1989, in time for the 1988–1989 school year. Hong Kong Governor Sir David Wilson dedicated the new campus. In 1989, the school grown to 1,7111 students across its two campuses.

In 2001, the student count was 2,650. That same year, Charles Dull announced that he would not stay on after the end of his period as the head of the school. William Wehrenberg succeeded him. Wehrenberg left his position in 2004.

In 2003, HKIS and BrainPop collaborated on an episode of the latter about SARS/MERS.

By 2004 the school had established an extracurricular summer school, which was one of the largest in Hong Kong.

The Middle School completed a new Middle School Annex overlooking Tai Tam Bay in 2009 or 2010, including administrative offices, a boardroom, Modern Languages classrooms and a seminar/meeting space. The Middle School has also developed 5 houses, Tai Tam, Peak, Lantau, Central and Shek-O. However, in the new 2024 semester, a new house will be developed for Lamma Island.

=== Recent developments ===
HKIS announced in June 2011 that it would be redeveloping the Lower Primary school building in Repulse Bay for three years, with the old building being leveled during the process. In 2013, HKIS announced that lower primary students would move to the Tai Tam campus starting in the 2014–2015 school year. Offices and support staff rooms were retrofitted into classrooms, with space in the Middle School being turned over to Lower Primary. Work began in 2014, with the new campus featuring an indoor swimming pool, auditorium, gymnasium, learning spaces, and housing.

The school undertook a complete renovation of the Lower and Upper Primary Campus in Repulse Bay in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The Lower Primary school received six new playgrounds, swimming pool, auditorium, cafeteria, and Wonder Lab. The Upper Primary school received major renovations with all classrooms increasing in size and including art, science, and Design Garage rooms, a Chinese Cultural Center, cafeteria, multiple purpose sports room, and two-story indoor place area.

During the 2016–2017 academic year, HKIS celebrated its 50th anniversary. One of the biggest events included the 50th Anniversary Ball among a series of other celebrations held throughout May 2017.

== School structure ==

The school is divided into four divisions, all co-educational: Lower Primary (Grades R1-R2 and Grades 1-2), Upper Primary (Grades 3–5), Middle School (Grades 6–8) and High School (Grades 9–12). Lower Primary (LP) and Upper Primary (UP) are housed in the original Repulse Bay campus, while the Middle School (MS) and High School (HS) are in the newer Tai Tam campus.

Each school division has its own faculty administration and student government organization; the student governments are known as the Senate, the Student Leadership Team, and the Student Consul, respectively for the high school, middle school, and upper primary. The entire school is overseen by the head of school.

For the 2023/24 academic year, there were over 2,800 students from over 40 different nationalities, and 500 faculty and staff who occupied the two separate campuses of HKIS. Four libraries housed a total of 200,000 books, periodicals, and technological resources.

In 2000, HKIS had the highest benefits and pay scheme in HKD of all of the international schools in Hong Kong.

In 1994, Lutheranism was the school&#x27;s religion.

== Curriculum ==

The school follows an American curriculum, offering three foreign modern languages in Middle and High School—French, Spanish, and Chinese—and various Advanced Placement courses in High School. Chinese language study is mandatory for R1-G5 students.

Students in the High School are required to study English, mathematics, life and physical sciences, social studies, and a world language. They must also meet the various requirements in fine arts, religion, American history, Asian studies, physical education, and wellness.

High School students in G11 and G12 can enroll in Independent Study and Senior Option, in which students design their own coursework and present their studies to faculty advisors.

Middle School students in G7 and G8 can enroll in electives including creative computing, religious education, culinary arts, Art Studio A and Studio B, performing arts, strings, band, physical education, and other electives. All students are enrolled in maths, science, social studies, and language arts. Middle school students in G6 cannot enroll in electives but can still choose among strings, band, and choir for the required musical topic. Additionally, they can also enroll in Spanish or Chinese. They also have &quot;SPICES&quot; which are a rotation of the electives in Grades 7 and 8.

===Fine arts===
HKIS&#x27; High School has an extensive fine arts program, offering numerous performing and visual arts courses. At least one arts credit is required for graduation, with at least one half-credit course in performance/studio arts and, if only the minimum requirement is met, a one half-credit fine arts survey course.

==== Performing arts ====
HKIS is a member of the Association for Music in International Schools (AMIS), which hosts honor festivals for students of international schools. Acceptance is highly competitive and HKIS&#x27; Middle School and High School bands, choirs, and strings programs have been well represented at AMIS festivals since 2009.

HKIS&#x27;s high school has also hosted the annual Southeast Asia Honor Band Program, inviting several major schools from the region (e.g., Jakarta and Taipei) to participate. At these festivals, HKIS also provided three honor bands of its own: the Middle School band, the Junior Varsity band, and a Varsity honor band.

In 2005, the High School Wind Ensemble earned first place at the Hong Kong Schools Music Festival. The High School band also travels to various countries for the APAC Festival, where students work with composers such as Robert W. Smith to put on a full-length concert in a few days. This festival has been held in places such as Seoul and Shanghai.

The Middle School band performs twice annually: once publicly, often in Stanley or City Hall, and once privately, usually in the Middle School Gymnasium. Other instrumental programs include the Strings program, which performs twice a year.

In Middle School, there are two performances per year, a musical and a play. Along with these, there are also musical theater classes, drama classes, and classes on theater craft.

HKIS has several choirs: an Upper Primary choir of 60 students, several Middle School choirs totaling over 100 students, and three High School choirs totaling 80 students.

Every year, the Madrigal Singers perform at the American Club&#x27;s tree-lighting ceremony and the Rugby Sevens, and the Middle School choir sends a contingent to AMIS festivals around the world every year, in locations such as Kuala Lumpur (2012), Jakarta (2010), Scotland (2009), and Paris (2010).

==== Visual arts ====
The High School visual arts program offers classes of various levels in 2D studio art, 3D studio art, photography, and more recently, graphic design. Classes at the introductory level are more structured, with students gaining more freedom in project direction as they progress in the curriculum.

===== Art program =====
There is a strong emphasis on socially conscientious art; students from the High School art program were invited in 2005 to participate in The Art Miles Mural Project, and the 100 People World Portrait Project (100People.org).

===== Film program =====
The film program has also expanded in the past several years, now boasting the Tai Tam Virtual Film Festival, judged by industry professionals as well as media instructors throughout Hong Kong and the Asia region.

===== Theater program =====
Students in both High School and Middle School can also participate in school plays and musicals, both backstage and onstage. In the past three years alone, HKIS&#x27; HS and MS have produced many shows, including &quot;Into the Woods Jr.&quot;, &quot;The Apple Tree&quot;, &quot;Aida&quot;, &quot;The Crucible&quot;, Picasso at the Lapin Agile, &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie Jr.&quot;, and &quot;The Bald Soprano&quot;.

== Technology ==
In 1988, the school began operating its own bulletin board system (BBS), called &quot;Dragon BBS&quot;. Additional technological infrastructure was installed around 1994.

In 2010, HKIS became a 1:1 (one laptop, one student) school, offering education in traditional and technological forms. Every student from grade 5 upwards was equipped with an Apple MacBook Pro and, younger students learn using a wide range of software using MacBook Pros, iPods, and iPads that remain at school. In 2013, the school switched to MacBook Airs for students participating in the 1:1 program. Currently all Grades 6 to 12 students are required to bring their own MacBook to school every day. In 2025, the school switched from Google Workspace to Microsoft 365.

==Campuses==
In 1994, John Haibrook of &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; described the Tai Tam campus as &quot;reminiscent of a classy, overgrown Italian villa&quot;, and that it had an &quot;isolated location&quot;. At that time, its capacity was 2,200.

<text>The Georgian Civil War (, &quot;sakartvelos samokalako omi&quot;) lasted from 1991 to 1993 in the South Caucasian country of Georgia. It consisted of inter-ethnic and international conflicts in the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, as well as the violent military &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against the first democratically-elected President of Georgia, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, and his subsequent uprising in an attempt to regain power.

While the Gamsakhurdia-led rebellion was eventually defeated by the Eduard Shevardnadze-led government, the South Ossetia and Abkhazia conflicts resulted in the de facto secession of both regions from Georgia. As a result, both conflicts have lingered on, with occasional flare-ups.

==Background==
===Georgian independence and ethnic conflicts===
During the dissolution of the Soviet Union, an opposition movement in Georgia organized mass protests starting in 1988, culminating in a declaration of sovereignty in May 1990 and independence on April 9, 1991, which was recognized in December. Zviad Gamsakhurdia was elected President in May.

Meanwhile, ethnic minority separatist movements, primarily on the part of the Ossetians and the Abkhaz, demanded greater autonomy or secession from Georgia. A petition for a separate Abkhazian SSR was submitted to the Soviet Union in March 1989, followed by anti-Georgian riots in July. The South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast declared independence from Georgia SSR in July 1990. The Georgian government attempted to assert its control in South Ossetia, and on January 5, 1991, the National Guard of Georgia entered Tskhinvali, the South Ossetian capital, and fighting broke out in and around the city. The Georgian-Ossetian Conflict was the first major crisis faced by Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s government.

===Civil unrest===
In August 1991, the Georgian National Guard launched a mutiny against President Zviad Gamsakhurdia and seized a government broadcast station in September. Following the police dispersion of a large opposition demonstration in Tbilisi on September 2, several opposition leaders were arrested and their offices raided and pro-opposition newspapers were closed. The National Guard of Georgia, the major paramilitary force in the country, split into two factions; pro- and anti-Gamsakhurdia. Another paramilitary organization, the Mkhedrioni, led by Jaba Ioseliani, also sided with the opposition.

Demonstrations and barricade-building marked the next three months, with sporadic clashes between pro- and anti-Gamsakhurdia forces. On September 24 a state of emergency was declared in Tbilisi. By late October 1991, most of the leadership of the opposition National Democratic Party (NDP), headed by Giorgi Chanturia, had been arrested. A stand-off followed as the sacked National Guard leader Tengiz Kitovani&#x27;s armed supporters withdrew to the outskirts of Tbilisi where they remained until late December 1991. The opposition claimed that President Gamsakhurdia had left no chance to peacefully settle the crisis.

==Coup d&#x27;état==

On 20 December 1991, Kitovani&#x27;s fighters returned in force to begin the final onslaught against Gamsakhurdia. The armed opposition released Jaba Ioseliani and mounted barricades in central Tbilisi. On December 22, the rebels seized several official buildings, and attacked the Parliament building where Gamsakhurdia and his supporters were holding the position. Simultaneously, the rebels, already controlling most of the city, brutally suppressed pro-Gamsakhurdia protests in and around Tbilisi. They fired on the crowds, killing and wounding several people.

On 6 January 1992, President Gamsakhurdia with other members of his government was forced to flee first to Armenia and then to Chechnya, where he led a form of government-in-exile for the next 18 months.

Within several days of the fighting, the main boulevard in the city, Rustaveli Avenue, had been destroyed, and at least 113 people were killed.

==&quot;Zviadist&quot; resistance==
After the successful coup, an interim government, the Military Council, was formed in Georgia. Initially it was led by a triumvirate of Jaba Ioseliani, Tengiz Sigua and Tengiz Kitovani, but it was soon chaired by Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister who returned to Tbilisi in March 1992. The 1992 elections established Shevardnadze as the Chairman of Parliament and the Head of State.

Zviad Gamsakhurdia, despite his absence, continued to enjoy substantial support within Georgia, especially in rural areas and in his home region of Samegrelo in western Georgia. The supporters of the ousted president, the &quot;Zviadists&quot;, responded to the coup with spontaneous street demonstrations, which were brutally suppressed by the government forces and paramilitary groups. Clashes between pro- and anti-Gamsakhurdia forces continued throughout 1992 and 1993 with Zviad Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s supporters taking captive government officials and government forces retaliating with reprisal raids. One of the most serious incidents occurred in Tbilisi on June 24, 1992, when armed Gamsakhurdia supporters seized the state television center. However, they were driven out within a few hours by the National Guard.

The armed &quot;Zviadists&quot; actually prevented the new government forces from gaining control of Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s native Samegrelo region, which became the stronghold of the overthrown president&#x27;s supporters. Numerous acts of violence and atrocities committed by the Mkhedrioni and government forces in this region contributed to further confrontation between the local population and Shevardnadze&#x27;s regime.

Following the coup and armed clashes in western Georgia, Aslan Abashidze, the leader of southwestern autonomous province of Adjara, closed an administrative border and prevented both sides from entering Adjarian territory. This established Abashidze&#x27;s authoritarian semi-separatist regime within the region, and created long-term problems in relations between the regional government and the central government of Georgia.

==South Ossetian and Abkhazian wars==

In February 1992, the fighting escalated in South Ossetia, with sporadic Russian involvement. Facing interior instability and political chaos, Shevardnadze agreed to negotiations to avoid a confrontation with Russia. A cease-fire was agreed upon and on 14 July 1992, a peacekeeping operation began, consisting of a Joint Control Commission and joint Russian – Georgian – Ossetian military patrols.

By the summer of 1992, tensions in another secessionist region, Abkhazia, were close to developing into a full-scale Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. On August 14, Georgian forces entered Abkhazia to disarm separatist militias. By the end of September 1993, Russian-backed separatists fought back and took the region&#x27;s capital, Sukhumi, after fierce fighting on September 27. Georgia&#x27;s military defeat was followed by the ethnic cleansing of the Georgian majority in Abkhazia. The war produced approximately 20,000 deaths on both sides, and about 260,000 refugees and IDPs.

==The 1993 civil war==
During the Abkhazian war, the role of Vakhtang (Loti) Kobalia&#x27;s militia, the major force of the former President&#x27;s supporters, continued to be controversial. Kobalia&#x27;s militia fought on the Georgian side near the village of Tamish in Abkhazia and played an important role in defeating the Abkhaz-North Caucasian commandos. This step was assessed by Shevardnadze as a &#x27;beginning of national reconciliation&#x27;. At the same time, they stirred their activities in anticipation of the fall of Sukhumi and public discontent with Shevardnadze&#x27;s policy which they expected to follow (as they openly stated). On July 9–10, 72 deputies of the former Supreme Council that had been ousted in January 1992, held a session in Zugdidi and declared the &#x27;restoration of the legitimate government&#x27; there. Broadcasting on their TV channel became more frequent. From July to August Kobalia&#x27;s militia effectively established its control in a significant part of the Samegrelo province.

In September 1993, Zviad Gamsakhurdia took advantage of the struggle in Abkhazia to return to the city of Zugdidi, western Georgia, and rally enthusiastic but disorganized Georgians in Samegrelo region against the demoralized and unpopular government of Eduard Shevardnadze. Although Gamsakhurdia initially represented his return as a rescue of Georgian forces after the Abkhazian disaster, he actually disarmed part of the Georgian troops retreating from the breakaway region and established his control over the significant part of Samegrelo. Ex-president&#x27;s advance made Shevardnadze to join the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and appeal for Russian military assistance. In mid-October, the addition of Russian weapons, supply-line security, and technical assistance turned the tide against Gamsakhurdia. On October 20, around 2,000 Russian troops moved to protect Georgian railroads.

On October 22, 1993, the government forces launched an offensive against pro-Gamsakhurdia rebels led by Colonel Loti Kobalia and, with the help of Russian military, occupied most of Samegrelo province. The ex-president&#x27;s forces counter-attacked on October 27. Heavy fighting concentrated around the towns of Khobi and Senaki. From November 2, following an agreement between Eduard Shevardnadze and Russian leadership, a Russian marine battalion was deployed to Poti in order to secure critical transport infrastructure, including railroads and ports, from Zviadist rebels under the direction of Admiral Eduard Baltin, commander of the Black Sea Fleet. In order to obtain this support, Shevardnadze had to agree to Georgian accession to CIS and the establishment of Russian military installations within Georgia. On November 4, 1993, the government forces broke through the defence lines of the Zviadist militias and entered Zugdidi without fighting on November 6. Their troops moved to the Enguri river by 9 November. Zviad Gamsakhurdia and his bodyguards escaped to the forests chased by the government forces. He died in late December under controversial circumstances. It was later reported that Gamsakhurdia had shot himself (though unproven, with many errors in the original investigation) on December 31, in a village Jikhashkari (Samegrelo region of Western Georgia). The revolt was crushed and the region was overrun by the pro-governmental paramilitaries. Several Zviadist leaders were arrested in the following years.

==Aftermath==
The three-year civil war produced a decade of political instability, permanent financial, economic and social crises. The situation began to stabilize in 1995. However, radical &quot;Zviadists&quot; organized several acts of terrorism and sabotage. They were charged for the assassination attempt of President Eduard Shevardnadze on 9 February 1998. A few days later, supporters of the former president kidnapped four observers from the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia from their compound in Zugdidi in western Georgia. Some of the hostage takers surrendered, but Gocha Esebua, the leader of the Zviadist team, escaped and was killed in a shootout with police on 31 March.

On October 18, 1998, there was an attempted revolt led by Colonel Akaki Eliava, a former &quot;Zviadist&quot; officer, near Kutaisi, Georgia&#x27;s second largest city. After the collapse of the mutiny, Eliava and his followers hid in the forests of Samegrelo. He had produced permanent problems for the government until he was shot by security officers in 2000.

On January 26, 2004, the newly elected President Mikheil Saakashvili officially rehabilitated Gamsakhurdia to resolve the lingering political effects of his overthrow in an effort to &quot;put an end to disunity in our society&quot;, as Saakashvili put it. He also released 32 Gamsakhurdia supporters arrested by Shevardnadze&#x27;s government in 1993–1994.

The relationship between Georgia and the separatists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia remained tense and led to renewed warfare during the 2008 South Ossetia war.

<text>Brian Moore&#x27;s Head Looks Uncannily Like London Planetarium was a fanzine devoted to Gillingham F.C.

It began life in 1988, and remarkably for a fanzine, which tend to have short publishing histories, ran for 18 years, with the final issue being published in April 2006. Stephen Foster ranked it top amongst football fanzines in his 2006 book &quot;The Book of Lists Football&quot;. In the mid-1990s the fanzine began to insert celebrity pictures sent in by readers in order to break up the text. Images of Rolf Harris and Clare Grogan recurred the most.

Some fans believed the &quot;BMH&quot; could generally be relied upon to take the most pessimistic and cynical view possible, although this became increasingly difficult during the early years of the tenure of Paul Scally as chairman, as the club recovered from receivership and near losing of its League place to ascend to previously undreamed of heights: by season 2005–06, after relegation and financial difficulties in the club, the chairman has ceased to be considered beyond criticism.

The fanzine gained a reputation as &quot;one of the best and most popular fanzines ever made&quot;, with the name attracting comment for its quirky nature.

It took its title from a line in the Half Man Half Biscuit song &quot;Dickie Davies Eyes&quot;. Brian Moore was formerly a director of the club, and in the absence of any other notable supporters it was decided to honour him in the title.

After the final physical issue, the fanzine was relaunched online and ran in this format until 2008.

<doc id="1209805" wikidata="Q2005657" url="?curid=1209805" title="Depaneling">
<text>Depaneling or depanelization is a process step in high-volume electronics assembly production. In order to increase the throughput of printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing and surface mount (SMT) lines, PCBs are often arranged in a process called panelization so that they consist of many smaller individual PCBs that will be used in the final product. This PCB cluster is called a panel or multiblock. The large panel is broken up or &quot;depaneled&quot; as a certain step in the process - depending on the product, it may happen right after SMT process, after in-circuit test (ICT), after soldering of through-hole elements, or even right before the final assembly of the PCB assembly (PCBA) into the enclosure.

==Risks==
When selecting a depaneling technique, it is important to be mindful of the risks, including:
* Mechanical strain: depaneling can be a violent operation and may bend the PCB causing some components to fracture, or in the worst case, break traces. Ways to mitigate this are avoiding placing components near the edge of the PCBA, and orienting components parallel to the break line.
* Tolerance: some methods of depaneling may result in the PCBA being a different size than intended. Ways to mitigate are to communicate with the manufacturer about which dimensions are critical, and selecting a depaneling method that meets your needs. Hand depaneling will have the loosest tolerance, laser depaneling the tightest.

== Depaneling methods ==
There are different methods to depanel a PCB Board. Most commonly used depaneling methods are:

# V-Scoring
# Tab Routing
# Breakaway Rail

=== V-Scoring ===
In V-Scoring method, a V-shaped groove is placed between the individual PCBs. This groves can easily be broken by hand or with saw and the PCB boards are separated. In V-Scoring, the grove thickness should be selected carefully, normally the grove should be one-third of the actual PCB thickness.

=== Tab routing ===
In Tab Routing, small tabs are placed at the edges of individual PCBs. PCB boards can easily be separated by removing the tabs. The advantages of Tab-routing over V-soring is that it can handle different shapes of PCBs. While selecting this method, one should be careful of tabs stiffness, as they need to hold the whole board.

=== Breakaway Rail ===
Breakaway Rail, also called Edge Rail, is used at the border of the PCB Panel. The main reason of Breakaway Rail is to save the PCB boards from any damage at the edges. The rails are removed easily from the PCB Panel during depaneling.

==Main depanel technologies==
There are six main depaneling cutting techniques currently in use:

* hand break
* pizza cutter / V-cut
* Water jet Cutter
* punch
* router
* saw
* laser

===Hand break===
This method is suitable for strain-resistant circuits (e.g. without SMD components). The operator simply breaks the PCB, usually along a prepared V-groove line, with the help of a proper fixture.

===Pizza cutter / V-cut ===
A &quot;pizza cutter&quot; is a rotary blade, sometimes rotating using its own motor. The operator moves a pre-scored PCB along a V-groove line, usually with the help of a special fixture. This method is often used only for cutting huge panels into smaller ones. The equipment is cheap and requires only sharpening of the blade and greasing as maintenance.

It uses an aluminium based jig to secure the PCB in place.

=== Water jet Cutter ===
In order to cut the PCB Panel, a high-pressure water stream is used. The water stream is normally mixed with abrasive particles, helps in smooth cutting process. Water jet cutter has high precision and accuracy and is usually used to cut the metallic sheets.

===Punch===
&quot;Punching&quot; is a process where single PCBs are punched out of the panel through the use of special fixture. It is a two-part fixture, with sharp blades on one part and supports on the other. The production capacity of such a system is high, but fixtures are quite expensive and require regular sharpening.

===Router===
A depaneling &quot;router&quot; is a machine similar to wood router. It uses a &quot;router bit&quot; to mill the material of the PCB. The hardness of the PCB material wears down the bit, which must be replaced periodically.

Routing requires that single boards are connected using tabs in a panel. The bit mills the whole material of the tab. It produces much dust that has to be vacuumed. It is important for the vacuum system to be ESD-safe. Also the fixturing of the PCB must be tight - usually an aluminium jig or a vacuum holding system is used.

The two most important parameters of the routing process are: &quot;feed rate&quot; and &quot;rotational speed&quot;. They are chosen according to the bit type and diameter and should remain proportional (i.e. increasing feed rate should be done together with increasing the rotational speed).

Routers generate vibrations of the same frequency as their rotational speed (and higher harmonics), which might be important if there are vibration-sensitive components on the surface of the board. The strain level is lower than for other depaneling methods. Their advantage is that they are able to cut arcs and turn at sharp angles. Their disadvantage is lower capacity.

===Saw===
A &quot;saw&quot; is able to cut through panels at high feed rates. It can cut both V-grooved and not-V-grooved PCBs. It does not cut much material and therefore generates low amounts of dust.

The disadvantages are: ability to cut in straight lines only and higher stress than for routing.

===Laser===
Laser cutting is now being offered as an additional method by some manufacturers.

UV laser depaneling makes use of a 355 nm wavelength (ultraviolet), diode-pumped, Nd:YAG laser source. At this wavelength the laser is capable of cutting, drilling and structuring on rigid and flex circuit substrates. The laser beam, capable of cut widths under 25 μm, is controlled by high-precision, galvo-scanning mirrors with repeat accuracy of +/-4 μm.

A variety of substrate materials can be cut with a UV laser source including FR-4 and similar resin-based substrates, polyimide, ceramics, PTFE, PET, aluminium, brass and copper.

Advantages: accuracy, precision, low mechanical stress and flexible contour and cut capabilities.

Disadvantages: initial capital investment is often higher than traditional depaneling technologies, also the optimal board thickness is recommended to be no more than 1 mm.

 laser sources have also been used for depaneling, but are considered outdated as UV laser technology provides cleaner cuts, less-thermal stress and higher precision capabilities.

<doc id="1209806" wikidata="Q1626555" url="?curid=1209806" title="Honda CX series">
<text>The Honda CX series motorcycles, including the GL500 and GL650 Silver Wing variants, were developed and released by Honda in the late 1970s, with production ending in most markets by the mid-1980s. The design included innovative features and technologies that were uncommon or unused at the time such as liquid cooling, electric-only starting, low-maintenance shaft drive, modular wheels, and dual CV-type carburetors that were tuned for reduced emissions. The electronic ignition system was separate from the rest of the electrical system, but the motorcycle could only be started via the start button.

==Power train==

===Engine===
The CX series features a longitudinal engine configuration, similar to a rear wheel drive automobile. Unlike the flat twins produced by BMW, the cylinders protrude at an angle above the horizontal. The included angle of the CX is 80°, and the heads are twisted 22° so that the inlet tracts do not interfere with the rider&#x27;s legs. A camshaft nestles at the base of the V between the cylinders. Although Honda generally favors OHC engines, the cylinder head twist necessitated the use of stubby pushrods to operate the four overhead valves per cylinder, with a forked rocker arm acting off each pushrod. The 5-speed transmission is located below the crankshaft, with both in the same housing, an arrangement which keeps the engine short but quite tall. The engine has a 10.0:1 compression ratio and 9,650 rpm redline. Just as with the Honda Gold Wing, the transmission rotates opposite to the engine to help counteract the engine torque&#x27;s tendency to tip the bike slightly to one side when the throttle is opened or closed.

The CX was the first V-twin engine motorcycle that Honda ever built. It was initially designed as a 90 ° V-twin. Honda built a prototype CX350 but it was never released to the public. In that version the cylinder heads did not have the cylinder-head twist.

===Transmission===
Final drive is with a shaft. Power is transferred by an enclosed splined driveshaft with one universal joint. The shaft drives a bevel gear to which the wheel is joined via a cush-drive, which absorbs and dampens driveline shocks and vibrations. The bevel drive spins in an oil bath, and a grease-nipple is provided for greasing the shaft bearing.

===Wheels===
The ComStar wheels combine the flexibility of spoked wheels with the strength and tubeless characteristics of one-piece wheels. Honda introduced the Com-Star wheels a year or so earlier on the CB250T/400T Dream as well as on the CB750F2 and GL1000 Gold Wing, although these featured standard rims that required inner tubes. The CX500 was the first production motorcycle to use tubeless tires.

==Chassis==
Early versions had conventional suspension, consisting of hydraulically damped telescoping front forks and dual coil-over shocks at the rear. Later versions had air-assisted forks and featured Honda&#x27;s Pro-Link monoshock rear suspension. US bikes (except GL500I, GL650I and Turbo) were equipped with a single front disc brake whereas all other bike possess dual front disc brakes. Besides the &#x27;vanilla&#x27; CX500B, models after 1980 sport dual piston calipers replacing the single piston caliper of the earlier models. For the Turbo and Eurosport models the rear drum was replaced with a dual piston caliper and disc. All models feature steel tube frames with a large backbone, with the engine used as a stressed member. The dual shock models use a single tube backbone whereas the later Pro-Link models employed a triple tube backbone.

==Variants==

===CX500===
The basic 1978 48 hp CX500 had a large fuel tank, stepped seat, a round brake fluid reservoir and a plastic mini-fairing that was thought to look unusual at the time. Turn signals extend out through the mini fairing from the headlight&#x27;s centerline. The CX500 Standard had silver Comstar wheels, 19 inch (front) and 18 inch (rear).

The trademark Moto Guzzi habit of mounting a V-twin engine with the crankshaft inline with the frame and shaft final drive was adopted for the CX500; but this Honda was decidedly different. Not only was the 497 cc engine water-cooled, but it had four valves per cylinder that were operated by pushrods rather than the overhead cams favored by Honda on its previous four-stroke engine designs.

The styling was radical: a steep fork angle and a short engine contributed to a stubby wheelbase on a bike that was rather tall. The CX500 was one of the first recipients of Honda&#x27;s new Comstar wheels, of diameter (front) and (rear). Later, on B models, reversed Comstars and a square brake fluid reservoir) were fitted.

The fuel tank tapered toward the front and a huge half-moon tail light jutted out from a short fairing behind the radically stepped seat. The result was a mix of standard, sport, and cruiser features.

===CX500 Custom===


The &quot;Custom&quot; variant, introduced in 1979, had a smaller, narrower tank and buckhorn handlebars. The headlight and gauges were similar to the CX500 Deluxe. Turn signals were now mounted along the fork tubes, below the level of the headlight. 1982 was the last model year for the CX500. In 1983 it was bumped up to 673 cc and became the CX650. The CX650&#x27;s styling was different, and the engine was painted black instead of plain aluminium.

===CX500 Deluxe===
The &quot;Deluxe&quot; model appeared in 1979. This bike looked nearly identical to the original CX500 Standard, with the exception of regular (85 mph) gauges and headlight (the mini fairing was removed) and black reversed Com Star wheels - 19 inch front and 16 inch rear. 1981 was the final year for the CX500 Deluxe model.

The CX500 met with a good degree of success. It proved to be reliable and economical, being the least-expensive shaft-drive bike. Many examples still exist today, and along with the GL Silverwings, are fast becoming cult bikes. There are owners clubs throughout Europe and the rest of the world.
===CX500EC Sports===

Introduced in 1982 the EC variant is a much improved motorcycle compared to the original 500. Sharing many parts with the CX500 Turbo introduced the same model year, the Sport (following the release of the CX650ED &#x27;Eurosports&#x27;, many people referred to the CX500EC also as the &#x27;Eurosports&#x27; although technically not correct) features air pre-load assisted front forks with an anti-dive mechanism, known as TRAC (Torque Reactive Anti-dive Control), and an air pre-load assisted prolink mono-shock rear suspension. The wheels were also modified, with an restyled round hole comstar with a 100–90H18 front tyre, whilst on the rear is a 120–80H18. The brakes are vastly improved with much more effective twin pot calipers on the front and a new disc brake with twin pot caliper on the rear replacing the original drum. The Sports is also significantly restyled with a larger fuel tank, a nose fairing, side panels, seat, and tail unit that share much more modern lines. In the UK only two colour options were made: white pearl with blue and red strips, or black with orange and silver stripes. The instrumentation is improved with the introduction of a fuel gauge and like the rest of the bike, a much updated appearance. Plastic mudguards replace the chromed steel versions on the earlier machines curing the associated rust problems. The round headlight of the early bikes is also replaced with a rectangular lens which gives improved night lighting.

The changes extended to the engine where Honda&#x27;s late 1970s issues with cam chains were dealt with via the introduction of an automatic tensioner replacing the manual version on the earlier models. Other changes also meant that the standard valve clearances were reduced, possibly through tighter manufacturing control. Sports model engines are identifiable via the lack of a cam chain tensioner bolt and the revised valve covers which feature black painted stripes and satin alloy flat areas.

The changes made the 500 Sports significantly better to both look at and ride, and more reliable than the previous versions. The later CX650ED shared the majority of the cosmetic changes introduced by the 500EC, whilst in Japan a 400 cc version was introduced with the same styling to comply with licence rules.
===GL500 Silver Wing and GL650 Silver Wing===


In 1981 Honda released the GL500 Silver Wing, which was a mid-sized touring bike based on the CX500 engine. The GL500 engine was similar to the CX500 engine, but used the more reliable transistorized ignition system, which meant the stator would contain only charging windings and thus would put out more power for operating the lights and other devices commonly added to touring motorcycles. The GL500 also used Honda&#x27;s Pro-Link monoshock rear suspension and was available as either a naked bike or as an Interstate model with fairing. The Interstate included a large factory fairing, hard saddlebags, and a trunk. This made the Silver Wing look like a miniature Gold Wing GL1100 Interstate. The 1981 model had a small tail trunk, which was replaced by a larger trunk in 1982. The trunk was interchangeable with the back seat—the bike is rider-only with the trunk installed, although there was an aftermarket extender available to allow the trunk to be mounted behind the passenger seat.

In 1983 the GL500 was upgraded to the GL650. Apart from the larger, 674 cc engine, the GL650 had a slightly different fairing mounts and front engine hanger mount than the GL500, and portions of the GL650 engine are painted black. The fuel economy of the GL650 was improved over that of the GL500 due to significantly taller gearing and the replacement of the CX/GL500&#x27;s mechanical radiator fan with an electric fan. Claimed power was for the GL500 and for the GL650.

The CX-based Silver Wings were discontinued after the 1983 model year. Overproduction of the 1982 GL500 caused some to be sold new as late as 1984.

===CX500 Turbo===
The CX500 Turbo was released in 1982. The CX500 Turbo (also known as the CX500TC) was only produced for the 1982 model year. It was superseded by the CX650TD (CX650 Turbo; D=1983) for the 1983 model year, which was itself discontinued the same year. The 1982 CX500T was Honda&#x27;s first production motorcycle to have programmed fuel injection system. With redundant fail-safe systems working in tandem with a separate ignition system. Electronic system failures were reported to the driver through two dashboard displays: an issue with the fuel injection system would light a &quot;Fuel System&quot; light on the dashboard and an issue with the ignition would flash the &quot;TURBO&quot; indicator.

The CX500TC powerplant was based on the water-cooled V-twin with four pushrod-operated overhead valves per cylinder configuration used in the CX500 introduced a few years earlier. The engine case look was retained nearly intact from the original CX500. The turbocharger, at peak boost providing approximately 19 psi boost nearly doubles the power output of the engine. The engine case is changed to accept the larger crankshaft bearings of the CX650 released in the same year, while the suspension, brakes, frame and fairing all differ significantly from the earlier CX500 and the Pro-Link rear suspension and TRAC (Torque Reactive Anti-dive Control) were used on the CX500EC (released 1982) and CX650ED (released 1983) models.

===CX650C===
The CX650 Custom was a one-year model produced in 1983 for the US market. Like other CX customs, especially the CX400C designed for Asia-Pacific, this model was a cruiser. The frame is completely different, and the styling was marketed to accommodate the American desire for the low stretched look of American cruiser bikes. Its semi chopped fork, tear drop tank, low seat and truncated exhaust gave it a very rakish look. However, it was very similar in styling and price range to the 750 Shadow and Honda elected to have only one cruiser bike in that class, thus the reason for its short model life.

===CX650ED===
 The CX650ED or Eurosport was also introduced in 1983 and was cosmetically very similar to the CX500EC Sports produced the previous year. It was aimed at the UK, European, Canadian, and Australian markets. The brakes, suspension and handling were advanced in comparison to CX500 variants. The model shares many common features with the CX500TC. Tubular frame design, TRAC anti-dive forks, Pro-Link rear suspension, twin-pot brakes and disc front and back. Though this model was not sold in the US, some have been imported by private owners.

===CX650T===
For the 1983 model year, the engine of the CX500 Turbo was increased to 673 cc, together with an increase in power. In addition to the increase in displacement, the compression ratio was increased and the maximum boost pressure was lowered thus making for a smoother transition from off-boost to on-boost. The fuel-injection control system was substantially revised for the CX650 Turbo, and the rear shock received an update as well by adding a manually operated damping control mechanism in addition to the &quot;air&quot; pre-load of the previous model.

Cosmetically, the CX650 Turbo differs little from its predecessor other than in colors and badging. However, in a cost-cutting exercise, Honda manufactured the 650 Turbo fairing from ABS plastic as opposed to the 500 turbo&#x27;s GRP. Honda built 1,777 models, with fewer than 1,200 imported to the U.S. and Canada. Only 100 units were shipped to the UK with none being exported to Australia.

In the fall of 1982, it was Honda&#x27;s intent to provide a singular new CX650T to each American Honda Dealership for sale. Sales were lackluster due to the bikes high retail cost and expensive insurance rates. At years end, dealerships located in the Midwest began shipping unsold bikes to California where the bike was more popular and could be sold.

===Other variants===
 The Japanese and European market saw 400 cc versions of the CX and GL, aptly named the CX400 and GL400. In Japan the GL650 SilverWing Interstate was released as the Limited Edition GL700 Wing Interstate, although it used the same 674 cc engine that was used in the GL650. Also in Australia, the 1980-1982 CX500 &#x27;standard&#x27; models were known as the &quot;CX500 Shadow&quot;.

<doc id="1209812" wikidata="Q1218613" url="?curid=1209812" title="The Big Bus">
<text>The Big Bus is a 1976 American satirical comedy film directed by James Frawley, and starring Joseph Bologna and Stockard Channing. Parodying the then-popular disaster genre, it follows the maiden cross-country trip of an enormous nuclear-powered bus named &quot;Cyclops&quot;.

&quot;The Big Bus&quot; initially received mixed reviews, although the &quot;New York Times&quot; gave the film a favorable review. The film performed poorly at the box office but has since been recognized as a cult classic of its genre. Frawley won the audience award at the 1977 Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival.

==Plot==
Coyote Bus Lines&#x27; scientists and designers work feverishly to complete &quot;Cyclops&quot;, a state-of-the-art articulated jumbo bus, enabling man to achieve a new milestone in bus history, namely non-stop service between New York City and Denver. Almost immediately after the bus engine is equipped with nuclear fuel, a bomb goes off, critically injuring Professor Baxter, the scientist in charge of the project. &quot;Cyclops&quot; itself is undamaged, but Coyote Bus Lines has lost both its driver and co-driver.

Kitty Baxter, the professor&#x27;s daughter and the Cyclops designer, is forced to turn to old flame Dan Torrance. Once a promising driver, Torrance was disgraced after he crashed his bus atop Mount Diablo, and was accused of saving his own life by eating all of his passengers. (Torrance blames his co-driver for cannibalism, insisting that he himself survived by eating the seats and the luggage, and only ate part of a passenger&#x27;s foot by accident when it was included in a stew). Narrowly surviving an assault by vindictive fellow drivers with the help of &quot;Shoulders&quot; O&#x27;Brien, Torrance is recruited to drive &quot;Cyclops&quot;.

Meanwhile, a sinister tycoon known as &quot;Ironman&quot;, encased in a huge iron lung, plots to destroy the bus with some oil sheikhs. Ironman directs his brother Alex to sabotage &quot;Cyclops&quot; using time bombs. Alex would prefer to use a man-made earthquake, but Ironman insists that the bus be destroyed and discredited. Before its maiden voyage, Alex sneaks aboard and hides a bomb within the bus.

Amidst public fanfare, the bus finally leaves New York, bound for Denver. Among the passengers are the Cranes, a neurotic married couple waiting for their divorce to finalize; Father Kudos, a priest who has lost his way; Dr. Kurtz, a disgraced veterinarian; Emery Bush, a man with only a few months to live; and Camille Levy, whose father died in the aforementioned Mount Diablo bus crash.

At first, &quot;Cyclops″&quot; journey is a success, and Torrance triumphantly breaks the &quot;wind barrier&quot; (referenced as &quot;breaking wind&quot;). Soon, however, disaster strikes. Investigating a mechanical problem, Dan discovers the bomb and disarms it just seconds before an explosion rips through another part of the bus. Now unable to stop, &quot;Cyclops&quot; speeds across America. Dan is determined to achieve &quot;Cyclops&#x27;s&quot; historic goal of non-stop service to Denver, but he also needs to surpass a treacherously curvy road where his father died. Dan almost succeeds, but not before a truck smashes into the upper deck windshield, and the bus runs partially off the road, ending up teetering over a cliff. To save the bus, Dan and Shoulders shift all the weight to the back by jettisoning all of the passenger luggage and then pumping the vehicle&#x27;s entire carbonated beverage supply into the galley at the opposite end.

Knowing he has only one more chance to destroy &quot;Cyclops&quot;, Alex finally persuades Ironman to use the earthquake. Unfortunately for Ironman, Alex somehow set the co-ordinates for Ironman&#x27;s house instead.

Back on the road, &quot;Cyclops&quot; once again heads to its destination, but just outside of Denver, the front and rear halves of the bus split from each other.

==Production notes==

===Casting===
On the director&#x27;s commentary of the 1980 film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, John Landis reveals that he cast Murphy Dunne as the leader of &quot;Murph and the Magic Tones&quot; because he had seen him as a cheesy lounge singer in an earlier film. Although Landis doesn&#x27;t mention &quot;The Big Bus&quot; by name, the film was Dunne&#x27;s only previous performance as a lounge singer.

===The &quot;Cyclops&quot;===
The central set piece of the film is the bus itself—credited for the design is the film&#x27;s art director Joel Schiller. The bus is a nuclear powered, double-decker, articulated bus with 32 wheels. It is named &quot;Cyclops&quot; due to the single large headlight prominent at the front. The front also features large wraparound windows on both upper and lower decks—with the lower deck containing the cockpit and the upper, front portion containing the lounge/bar. &quot;Cyclops&quot; requires the operation of a driver and co-driver. In the film, &quot;Cyclops&quot; has a passenger capacity of 110 and is equipped with a bowling alley, Asian-style cocktail lounge with a piano bar, swimming pool, Bicentennial dining room, private marble-and-gold bathroom with sunken tub, and chef&#x27;s kitchen. Exterior features shown are an automatic washing mechanism for the &quot;Cyclops&quot; exterior; an automatic en route tire-changing system; and a display of &quot;Flags of all Nations,&quot; which emerges from the vehicle&#x27;s roof. &quot;Cyclops&quot; can be compared to the German Neoplan Jumbocruiser, an actual double decker articulated super bus with a capacity of 170, originally built in 1975.

According to articles in 1976 issues of both &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine and the now defunct &quot;Bus World&quot; magazine, the real bus used in the film was a large road-worthy vehicle created by production designer Joel Schiller. Though the most visible front portions of the bus (bar and cockpit) appeared to be functional, the remainder of the body of the vehicle was mostly empty—containing only the engine, suspension and essential mechanisms used for exterior trick shots. Few behind-the-scenes and construction photos or plans have surfaced, but according to Joel Schiller&#x27;s website, the actual bus built for the film was part of the Los Angeles Bicentennial Parade of 1976.

Further, the &quot;Bus World&quot; article stated that the vehicle made a trip from Los Angeles to San Diego, California, as a film promotion in 1976. The &quot;Bus World&quot; article also contained extensive photos and details about the building of the bus. The article states that the rear half of the bus was a separate vehicle with a driver. The two halves of the bus would arrive separately at the filming location where they were joined for shooting. The rear driver was unable to see and had to be directed by radio. In the scene in which the bus departs the terminal on its voyage, the front wheels on the rear portion of the bus are seen turning independently as the bus makes a very tight turn out of the terminal. According to car enthusiast web site Jalopnik.com, the bus was scrapped after filming.

In the closing credits, Trailways Bus Lines is thanked for their help in creating the bus used in the film. It is not stated what role Trailways took in creating &quot;Cyclops&quot;, although the footage of passengers boarding the bus in New York used Trailways Los Angeles bus station. The fictional bus line in the film that operates &quot;Cyclops&quot; is Coyote Bus Lines, a parody of Greyhound Lines.

==Soundtrack score==
The score to the film was created by veteran film composer David Shire. His score was in line with the disaster parody theme of the film that also incorporated elements of disco. In the &#x27;90s, &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; magazine ran a poll asking which film score its readers would most like to see released. &quot;The Big Bus&quot; was among the top 20 scores. In 2000, a bootleg CD of the film&#x27;s soundtrack surfaced as a prized collectable.

In January 2011, a limited edition official release of the score was produced by &quot;Film Score Monthly&quot; (Catalog No. FSM1401). The compact disc was limited to 2000 copies and contained the film&#x27;s complete score, including alternate takes and excerpts of classical pieces used in various scenes. The CD also contained comedy music and vocals bits by Murphy Dunne, who portrayed Tommy Joyce, the piano player in the bus&#x27; Oriental Lounge. The soundtrack release was sourced from the master tapes. As a result, sound quality was excellent and in stereo.

==Reception==
&quot;The Big Bus&quot; received mixed reviews critically. The film holds a 64% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 14 reviews.

==Television broadcast==
&quot;The Big Bus&quot; had its television premiere on CBS in March 1978, edited to remove some adult content and language to meet broadcast content standards of the time. Repeated in May 1980, the film has rarely been broadcast over the past 40 years on various channels, though it had been seen uncut as recently as 2009 on Turner Classic Movies (TCM) and Showtime.

As of 2009, Warner Bros. Television holds the USA TV broadcast rights while Paramount Pictures retains all other rights. Only the Warner Bros. logo appears on Showtime&#x27;s airings and the original Paramount logo is preserved on TCM&#x27;s print and the DVD issue.

==Home media==
The film was released on VHS and Betamax in the early 1980s.

In 2002, Paramount Home Entertainment released the film on DVD in a dual-format edition containing the film in the full-screen or theatrical 2.35:1 aspect ratios, (though there is some slight windowboxing with the widescreen version selected); Dolby 5.1 English Surround Sound stereo/mono mix, or Dolby 2.0 mono in English, French, and Spanish. No other extras are included, and the DVD is out of print.

The film was also released on DVD in the United States on September 24, 2013, as a Warner Archive Collection DVD-R.

The film has also been released on Region 4 DVD.

Kino Lorber released a newly-remastered version of the film on Blu-Ray in April 2023.

<doc id="1209820" wikidata="Q645216" url="?curid=1209820" title="William Lowndes Yancey">
<text>William Lowndes Yancey (August 10, 1814July 27, 1863) was an American politician in the Antebellum South. As an influential &quot;Fire-Eater&quot;, he defended slavery and urged Southerners to secede from the Union in response to Northern antislavery agitation.

Though a critic of John C. Calhoun at the time of the Nullification Crisis of 1832–33, in the late 1830s, Yancey began to identify with Calhoun, and, by 1849, Yancey was a firm supporter of Calhoun&#x27;s &quot;Southern Address&quot; and an adamant opponent of the Compromise of 1850. Throughout the 1850s, Yancey demonstrated an ability to hold large audiences under his spell for hours at a time and was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Orator of Secession&quot;. At the 1860 Democratic National Convention, he was instrumental in splitting the party into Northern and Southern factions as a leading opponent of Stephen A. Douglas and the concept of popular sovereignty. He used the phrase &quot;squatter sovereignty&quot; in a speech he gave at the convention to describe popular sovereignty.

During the American Civil War, Yancey was appointed by Confederate President Jefferson Davis to head a diplomatic delegation to Europe in the attempt to secure formal recognition of Southern independence. In these efforts, Yancey was unsuccessful and frustrated. Upon his return to America in 1862, Yancey was elected to the Confederate States Senate, where he was a frequent critic of the Davis Administration. Suffering from ill health for much of his life, Yancey died during the Civil War, in July 1863 at the age of 48.

==Early life==
Yancey&#x27;s mother, Caroline Bird (1790-1859), lived on her family&#x27;s plantation (nicknamed &quot;the Aviary&quot;) located near the falls of the Ogeechee River in Warren County, Georgia. On December 8, 1808, she married Benjamin Cudworth Yancey, a lawyer in South Carolina who had served on the USS Constellation during the Quasi-War with France. William Lowndes Yancey was born at the Aviary on August 10, 1814. Three years later, on October 26, 1817, his father died of yellow fever.

Yancey&#x27;s widowed mother married the Reverend Nathan Sydney Smith Beman on April 23, 1821. Beman had temporarily relocated to South Carolina to operate Mt. Zion Academy, where William was a student. In the spring of 1823, the entire family moved when Reverend Beman took a position at the First Presbyterian Church in Troy, New York. Beman worked with Reverend Charles G. Finney in the free-school movement, and became involved with abolitionism in the 1830s through contacts with Theodore Dwight Ward and Lyman Beecher.

Beman&#x27;s marriage was marred by domestic unrest and spousal abuse that led to serious considerations of divorce and, finally, a permanent separation in 1835. This atmosphere affected the children and caused William to reject many of his step-father&#x27;s teachings. Yancey&#x27;s biographer, historian Eric H. Walther, speculates the character of Yancey&#x27;s later career was a result of low self-esteem and a search for public adulation and approval that went back to his childhood experiences with Reverend Beman.

In the fall of 1830, Yancey was enrolled at Williams College in northwestern Massachusetts. The 16-year-old Yancey was admitted as a sophomore based on the required entrance examinations. At Williams, he participated in the debating society and for a short time was the editor of a student newspaper. In the autumn of 1832, Yancey took his first steps as a politician by working on the campaign for Whig Ebenezer Emmons. Overall, Yancey had a successful stay at Williams academically that was marred only by frequent disciplinary problems. Despite being selected as the Senior Orator by his class, Yancey left the school in the spring of 1833, six weeks before graduation.

==Early career==
Yancey returned to the South, relocating to Greenville, South Carolina. He originally lived on his uncle&#x27;s plantation, where he served as a bookkeeper. The uncle, Robert Cunningham, was a strong unionist, as were most of Yancey&#x27;s family, including his birth father. On July 4, 1834, at a Fourth of July celebration, Yancey made a stirring nationalistic address in which he openly attacked the radicals of the state who were still talking secession from the repercussions of the Nullification Crisis:


As a result of Yancey&#x27;s political activities, he was appointed editor of the &quot;Greenville Mountaineer&quot; in November 1834. As editor, he attacked both nullification and the chief architect of nullification, John C. Calhoun. Yancey compared Calhoun to Aaron Burr and referred to them as &quot;two fallen arch angels—who have made efforts to tear down the battlements and safeguards of our country, that they might rule, the Demons of the Storm.&quot;

Yancey resigned from the newspaper on May 14, 1835. On August 13, married Sarah Caroline Earl. As his dowry, Yancey received 35 slaves and a quick entry into the planter class. In the winter of 1836–1837, Yancey again moved to her plantation in Alabama, near Cahaba (Dallas County). It was an inopportune time to relocate. As a result of the Panic of 1837, Yancey&#x27;s financial position was seriously damaged by cotton prices that fell from fifteen cents a pound in 1835 to as low as five cents a pound in 1837.

In early 1838, Yancey took over the &quot;Cahaba Southern Democrat&quot;, and his first editorial was a strong defense of slavery. From his current economic perspective, Yancey began to identify the anti-slavery movement negatively with issues such as the establishment of a national bank, internal improvements, and the expansion of federal power. As the former nationalist moved to a states&#x27; rights position, Yancey also changed his attitude toward Calhoun — for example, by applauding Calhoun&#x27;s role in the Gag rule debates. Yancey also began to attack Henry Clay for his support of the American Colonization Society, which Yancey equated with attacks on Southern slavery.

Yancey, like most members of the planter class, was a strong believer in a personal code of honor. In September 1838, Yancey returned for a brief return visit to Greenville. A political slur by Yancey in a private conversation was overheard by a teenage relative of the aggrieved party. Yancey was confronted by another relative (and his wife&#x27;s uncle), Dr. Robinson Earle. Conversation turned to violence, and the always armed Yancey ended up killing the doctor in a street brawl. Yancey was tried and sentenced to a year in jail for manslaughter. An unrepentant Yancey was pardoned after only a few months, but, while incarcerated he wrote for his newspaper, &quot;Reared with the spirit of a man in my bosom—and taught to preserve inviolate my honor—my character, and my person, I have acted as such a spirit dictated.&quot;

Yancey returned to his paper in March 1839, but sold it a couple of months later when he moved to Wetumpka in Elmore County, Alabama. While his intent was to resume his life as a planter, Yancey suffered a huge financial reversal when his slaves were poisoned as a result of a feud between Yancey&#x27;s overseer and a neighboring overseer. Two of the slaves were killed, and most of the others were incapacitated for months. Unable to afford replacements, and burdened with other debts from his newspaper, Yancey was forced to sell most of the enslaved people as they recovered. Yancey did open in Wetumpka the &quot;Argus and Commercial Advertiser&quot;.

==Public office==

Yancey was increasingly interested in politics, as his personal politics moved towards the most radical wing of the Southern Democratic Party. Influenced most by Dixon Hall Lewis, Yancey fell into a social and political circle that included political leaders of the state such as Thomas Mays, J. L. M. Curry, John A. Campbell, and John Gill Shorter. In April 1840, Yancey started a weekly campaign newsletter that supported Democrat Martin Van Buren over Whig William Henry Harrison in the 1840 presidential election while emphasizing that slavery should now be the most important political and economic concern of the South. While still not a secessionist, Yancey was also no longer an unconditional unionist.

He was elected in 1841 to the Alabama House of Representatives, in which he served for one year. Because of increasing debt, Yancey sold his newspaper in March 1842. Throughout his career as an editor, he had faced the problem of many fellow editors in obtaining and collecting on subscriptions and decided to open a law practice instead. In 1843, he ran for the Alabama Senate and was elected by a vote of 1,115 to 1,025. His special concern in this election was the effort being made by Whigs to determine apportionment in the state legislature based on the &quot;federal ratio&quot; of each slave counting as three-fifths of a person. At the time, only whites were counted by the state, and the change would have benefited the Whigs, who generally were the largest slaveholders. This type of conflict between large slaveholders and yeomen Alabamians would continue through the Alabama secession convention in 1861.

In 1844, Yancey was elected to the United States House of Representatives to fill a vacancy (winning with a 2,197 to 2,137 vote) and re-elected in 1845 (receiving over 4,000 votes as the Whigs did not even field a candidate). In Congress, his political ability and unusual oratorical gifts at once gained recognition. Yancey delivered his first speech on January 6, 1845, when he was selected by the Democrats to respond to a speech by Thomas Clingman, a Whig from North Carolina who had opposed Texas annexation. Clingman was offended by the tone of Yancey&#x27;s speech and, afterwards, Yancey refused to clarify that he had not intended to impugn Clingman&#x27;s honor. Clingman challenged Yancey to a duel, and he accepted. The exchange of pistol fire occurred in nearby Beltsville, Maryland; neither combatant was injured.

In Congress, Yancey was an effective spokesman in opposing internal improvements and tariffs and supporting states&#x27; rights and the start of the Mexican–American War. More and more, he subscribed to conspiracy theories regarding Northern intentions, while helping to provide ammunition for those Northerners who were starting to believe in a slaveholders&#x27; conspiracy. In 1846, however, he resigned his seat, partly for financial reasons, and partly because of his disgust with the Northern Democrats, whom he accused of sacrificing their principles for economic interests.

==Alabama platform and address to the people of Alabama==

Within a few months of his resignation, Yancey moved to Montgomery, where he purchased a dairy farm while establishing a law partnership with John A. Elmore. No longer a planter, Yancey still remained a slaveholder, owning 11 slaves in 1850, 14 by 1852, and 24 between 1858 and 1860. While he had suggested with his resignation that his active role in politics might be over, &quot;perhaps forever&quot;, Yancey found this to be impossible.

Yancey recognized the significance to the South of the Wilmot Proviso and, in 1847, as the first talk of slaveholder Zachary Taylor as a presidential candidate surfaced, Yancey saw him as a possibility for bringing together a Southern political movement that would cross party lines. Yancey made it clear that his support for Taylor was conditional upon Taylor denouncing the Wilmot Proviso. However, Taylor announced that he would seek the Whig nomination, and, in December 1847, Lewis Cass of Michigan, the leading Democratic candidate, endorsed the policy of popular sovereignty.

With no available candidate sufficiently opposed to the Proviso, Yancey in 1848 secured the adoption by the state Democratic convention of the &quot;Alabama Platform,&quot; which was endorsed by the legislatures of Alabama and Georgia and by Democratic state conventions in Florida and Virginia. The platform endorsed these proposals:

# The Federal government could not restrict slavery in the territories.
# Territories could not prohibit slavery until the point where they were meeting in convention to draft a state constitution in order to petition Congress for statehood.
# Alabama delegates to the Democratic convention were to oppose any candidate supporting either the Wilmot Proviso or popular sovereignty (which allowed territories to exclude slavery at any point).
# The federal government would have to overrule Mexican anti-slavery laws specifically in the Mexican Cession and actively protect slavery.

When the national convention was held in Baltimore, Cass was nominated on the fourth ballot. Yancey&#x27;s proposal that the convention adopt the main points of the Alabama Platform was rejected by a 216–36 vote. Yancey and one other Alabama delegate left the convention in protest, and Yancey&#x27;s efforts to stir up a third-party movement in the state failed.

The opening salvo in a new level of sectional conflict occurred on December 13, 1848, when Whig John G. Palfrey of Massachusetts introduced a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia. Throughout the South in 1849, &quot;the rhetoric of resistance to the North escalated and spread&quot;. Calhoun delivered his famous &quot;Southern Address&quot;, but only 48 out of 121 Congressmen signed off on it. Yancey persuaded a June 1849 state Democratic Party meeting to endorse Calhoun&#x27;s address and was instrumental in calling for the Nashville Convention scheduled for June 1850.

Yancey was opposed to both the Compromise of 1850 and the disappointing results of the Nashville Convention. The latter, rather than making a strong stand for secession as Yancey had hoped, simply advocated extending the Missouri Compromise Line to the Pacific Coast. Yancey helped create Southern Rights Associations (a concept that originated in South Carolina) in Alabama to pursue a secessionist agenda. A convention of these Alabama associations, held in February 1851, produced Yancey&#x27;s radical &quot;Address to the People of Alabama&quot;. The address began in this way:

The address hit all of the main points that would ultimately resurface in the secession during the winter of 1860–1861, especially the treatment of Southerners:

Despite the efforts of Yancey, the popularity of the Compromise of 1850, the failure of the Nashville Convention, and the acceptance of the more moderate Georgia Platform by much of the South led to unionist victories in Alabama and most of the South. Yancey&#x27;s third-party support for George Troup of Georgia on a Southern-rights platform drew only 2,000 votes.

==Road to secession==
Yancey continued to support the most radical Southern positions and is generally included as one of a group of Southerners referred to as &quot;Fire-Eaters.&quot; Historian Emory Thomas notes that Yancey, along with Edmund Ruffin and Robert Barnwell Rhett, &quot;remained in the secessionist forefront longest and loudest.&quot; Thomas characterized the whole Fire-Eater cause as reactionary in purpose (the preservation of the South as it then existed), but revolutionary in means (the rejection of the existing political order).

When the conflicts in Kansas Territory known as Bleeding Kansas erupted in 1855–1856, Yancey spoke publicly in support of Jefferson Buford&#x27;s efforts to raise 300 men to go to Kansas and fight for Southern interests. In 1856, Yancey was head of the platform committee for the state Democratic and Anti–Know Nothing Convention, and he succeeded in having the convention readopt the Alabama Platform. In June 1856, he participated in a rally condemning Charles Sumner while praising his assailant Preston Brooks, who nearly bludgeoned Sumner to death in the United States Senate chamber. In June 1857, Yancey spoke at a rally opposing Robert J. Walker&#x27;s actions as territorial governor of Kansas. In July 1856, he spoke at the University of Alabama&#x27;s graduation on &quot;the distinctive characteristics of the Northern and Southern people of the Union.&quot; In January 1858, he participated in a rally supporting William Walker, the famous Nicaragua filibuster, calling the &quot;Central American enterprise as the cause of the South.&quot;

Throughout the mid-1850s, he also lectured on behalf of the Mount Vernon Ladies&#x27; Association, an organization that eventually purchased Mount Vernon from John A. Washington in 1858 for its restoration. Yancey helped to raise $75,000 for this project.

Editor and fellow Fire-Eater James DeBow was a leader in establishing the Southern Commercial Conventions in the 1850s. At the 1857 meeting in Knoxville, DeBow had called for a reopening of the international slave trade. At the May 1858 convention in Montgomery, responding to a speech by Virginian Roger A. Pryor opposing the slave trade, Yancey, in an address that spanned several days, made the following points:

Yancey supported a plan originated by Edmund Ruffin for the creation of a League of United Southerners as an alternative to the national political parties. In a letter of June 16, 1858, to his friend James S. Slaughter that was publicly circulated (Horace Greeley referred to it as &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;), Yancey wrote the following:

Yancey was ill for much of the remainder of 1858 and early 1859. For the 1859 Southern Commercial Convention in Vicksburg, which passed the resolution to repeal all state and federal regulations banning the slave trade, Yancey could only contribute editorials, although by July 1859 he was able to speak publicly in Columbia, South Carolina, in favor of repealing the restrictions. When the Alabama Democratic Party organized in the winter of 1859–1860 for the upcoming national convention, they chose Yancey to lead them on the basis of the Alabama Platform. Both Stephen A. Douglas and popular sovereignty were the immediate targets, but, by then, Yancey also recognized that secession would be necessary if a &quot;Black Republican&quot; were to gain the White House.

==Spreading the pro-slavery message==
After twelve years&#x27; absence from the national conventions of the Democratic Party, Yancey attended the Charleston convention in April 1860. The Douglas faction refused to accept a platform modeled after Yancey&#x27;s Alabama Platform of 1848 that was committed to protecting slavery in the territories. When the platform committee presented such a proposal to the convention, it was voted down on the floor 165–138. Yancey and the Alabama delegation left the hall and were followed by the delegates of Mississippi, Louisiana, South Carolina, Florida and Texas and by two of the three delegates from Delaware. On the next day, the Georgia delegation and a majority of the Arkansas delegation withdrew. As Eric Walther states, &quot;Through his years of preparation and despite some brief wavering, William L. Yancey had finally destroyed the Democratic Party.&quot;

Failing to nominate a candidate, the convention adjourned and reconvened in Baltimore on June 18, 1860. In a last gasp effort to obtain party unity, Douglas supporter George Nicholas Sanders made an unauthorized offer to Yancey to run as vice-president. Yancey turned this down, and the entire Yancey delegation from Alabama was refused credentials in favor of a pro–Douglas slate headed by John Forsyth Jr. With the South Carolina delegation also being denied credentials, the Louisiana, Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee delegations left the convention. The Southern representatives reconvened in Baltimore on June 23 and adopted the Yancey platform from the Charleston convention and nominated John C. Breckinridge for president. In a speech before the convention, Yancey characterized the Douglas supporters as &quot;ostrich like—their head was in the sand of squatter sovereignty, and they did not know their great, ugly, ragged abolition body was exposed&quot;. Yancey, who already had made thirty public addresses in 1860, delivered twenty more during the campaign. If he had not been a national figure before, he certainly was one now — a figure making it clear that secession would follow anything other than a Breckinridge election.

Yancey&#x27;s speaking tour in favor of Breckinridge was not confined to the South. In Wilmington, Delaware, Yancey stated, &quot;We stand upon the dark platform of southern slavery, and all we ask is to be allowed to keep it to ourselves. Let us do that, and we will not let the negro insult you by coming here and marrying your daughters.&quot;

On October 10, 1860, at Cooper Union Hall in New York, Yancey advised Northerners interested in preserving the Union to &quot;enlarge your jails and penitentiaries, re-enforce and strengthen your police force, and keep the irrepressible conflict fellows from stealing our negroes...&quot; Yancey cited Southern fears that, with abolitionists in power, &quot;Emissaries will percolate between master [and] slave as water between the crevices of rocks underground. They will be found everywhere, with strychnine to put in our wells.&quot; He further warned the crowd that Republican agitation would make Southern whites &quot;the enemies of that race until we drench our fields with the blood of the unfortunate people.&quot;

At Faneuil Hall in Boston, Yancey defended the practices of slavery:

From Boston, Yancey&#x27;s tour included stops in Albany, Syracuse, Louisville, Nashville, and New Orleans, finally returning to Montgomery on November 5. When news of Lincoln&#x27;s election reached the city, Yancey rhetorically asked a public assemblage protesting the results, &quot;Shall we remain [in the Union] and all be slaves? Shall we wait to bear our share of the common dishonor? God forbid!&quot;

==Secession==

On February 24, 1860, the Alabama legislature passed a joint resolution requiring the governor to call for the election of delegates to a state convention if a Republican was elected president. After first waiting for the official electoral votes to be counted, Governor Andrew Moore called for the election of delegates to take place on December 24, with the convention to meet on January 7, 1861. When the convention convened, Yancey was the guiding spirit. The delegates were split between those insisting on immediate secession versus those who would secede only in cooperation with other Southern states. A frustrated Yancey lashed out at those cooperationists:

Eventually, the ordinance of secession was passed over cooperationists objections by a vote of 61–39.

When the newly established Confederate States of America met later that month in Montgomery to establish their formal union, Yancey was not a delegate, but he delivered the address of welcome to Jefferson Davis, selected as provisional President, on his arrival at Montgomery. While many of the Fire-Eaters were opposed to the selection of a relative moderate like Davis, Yancey accepted him as a good choice. In his speech, Yancey indicated that, in the selection of Davis, &quot;The man and the hour have met. We now hope that prosperity, honor, and victory await his administration.&quot; Many historians agree with Emory Thomas who wrote, &quot;When Yancey and Davis met in Montgomery the helm of the revolution changed hands. Yancey and the radicals had stirred the waters; Davis and the moderates would sail the ship.&quot;

==At war==

===Diplomat===
Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Yancey met on February 18, 1861, as Davis was starting to put together the executive branch of the government. Yancey turned down a cabinet position, but indicated he would be interested in a diplomatic post. Don Doyle argues that Davis displayed &quot;tone deafness&quot; in appointing Yancey, who was &quot;ignorant of the world&quot; and himself realized that he was &quot;wholly unsuited by experience and personality for diplomacy.&quot; However, Davis feared that Yancey would be a political opponent, and wanted him out of the country.

On March 16, Yancey was formally appointed as the head of the diplomatic mission to England and France. Ambrose Dudley Mann and Pierre Adolphe Rost were also part of the mission; only Mann had any diplomatic experience. The delegation assembled in London at the end of April. Confederate Secretary of State Toombs&#x27;s official instructions to Yancey were to convince Europe of the righteousness and legality of Southern secession, the viability of the militarily strong Confederacy, the value of cotton and virtually duty-free trade, and the South&#x27;s willingness to observe all treaty agreements in effect between Britain and the United States except for the portion of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty requiring aid in combating the African slave trade. Above all, Yancey was to strive for diplomatic recognition.

Hubbard argues that President Davis could not have selected &quot;three less qualified Southern leaders&quot;. In contrast to Walther&#x27;s favorable characterizations of Yancey&#x27;s conduct, Hubbard stated that Yancey&#x27;s conduct in England was &quot;consistently impulsive, arrogant, [and] unreasonably demanding&quot;. Arriving in Britain just a few days ahead of the news about the attack on Fort Sumter, Yancey and his delegation met informally with British foreign secretary Lord John Russell on May 3 and 9. Yancey emphasized the points from his instructions and denied, upon being questioned by Russell, that there was any intent to reopen the slave trade. Russell was non-committal, and on May 12, Queen Victoria announced British neutrality combined with recognition that a state of belligerency existed.

After news arrived of the Confederate victory at Bull Run, Yancey attempted to arrange another meeting with Russell, but he was forced to present his arguments in writing. Doyle argues that Yancey blundered badly by extolling the benefits of slavery to the world in general and Britain in particular. In an August 24 response directed to the representatives &quot;of the so-styled Confederate States of America&quot;, Russell merely reiterated the previous determination to remain neutral. Critics maintain that the Yancey mission failed to adequately exploit openings presented by U.S. Secretary of State William Seward&#x27;s antagonist attitude towards Great Britain or to address British concerns concerning the effect of the war on Great Britain. In late August, with little else to do, Yancey submitted his resignation but, due to the events of the Trent Affair, Yancey did not leave until his replacements, James M. Mason and John Slidell (selected by President Davis in July before he was aware of Yancey&#x27;s intent), arrived in January 1862. Yancey did make one further attempt to meet with Russell in the wake of the Trent affair, but Russell replied to the delegation that &quot;we must decline to enter into any official communication with them.&quot;

While Yancey was originally optimistic about his mission, his observations in conversations and in the British papers forced him to conclude that the slavery issue was the primary obstacle to formal diplomatic recognition. He told his brother, &quot;Anti-slavery sentiment is universal. Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin has been read and believed...I ought never to have come here. This kind of thing does not suit me. I do not understand these people or their ways well enough.&quot;

===Confederate Senate===
While still in England, Yancey was elected to the Confederate Senate. His return home, because of the Union blockade, found him landing at the Sabine Pass near the Texas and Louisiana border. On his way to Richmond, he stopped in New Orleans, where he made a public speech lamenting the fact that Europe looked down on the Confederacy over the issue of slavery, stating, &quot;We cannot look for any sympathy or help from abroad. We must rely on ourselves alone.&quot;

From March 28, 1862, until May 1, 1863, Yancey served in three sessions of the Confederate Congress. While there, he reluctantly supported the Confederate Conscription Act of April 16, 1862, but was instrumental in allowing many state exemptions to the draft as well as the unpopular exemption for one overseer for every twenty slaves, an exemption that applied to about 30,000 men. He unsuccessfully argued against the excessive use of secret, unrecorded sessions of Congress and generally pursued a states&#x27; rights position in regard to the exercise of national war powers in general and impressment of supplies and slaves by the federal Confederate government in particular. On military matters, Yancey wanted details provided to Congress on reports of execution without trials of Confederate soldiers by General Braxton Bragg, questioned the reasons Virginia had 29 brigadier generals while Alabama only had four, authored a resolution condemning drunkenness within the army, and joined in demands that Davis account for complaints on the military administration of the Trans-Mississippi District.

Yancey gradually ran afoul of President Davis on matters of policy, although he was not one of Davis&#x27;s most extreme critics. Their differences accelerated in a series of letters exchanged after May 1863, and no final resolution was reached. In Congress, Yancey and Benjamin Hill of Georgia, who had previously clashed in 1856, had their differences over a bill intended to create the Confederate Supreme Court erupt into physical violence. Hill hit Yancey in the head with a glass inkstand, knocking Yancey over a desk and onto the floor of the Senate. The physical attack on Yancey by Hill within the Confederate Congress was kept secret for months, and in the ensuing investigation it was Yancey, not Hill, who was censured.

Yancey returned to Alabama in May 1863, before Congress had adjourned. By the end of June, Yancey was extremely ill from his injures received during the attack by Hill in the Confederate Congress, but he still continued his correspondence with President Davis and others. Finally, on July 27, 1863, at age 48, Yancey died of kidney disease. Yancey&#x27;s funeral on July 29, 1863, brought the city of Montgomery to a standstill, and he was buried at Oakwood Cemetery on Goat Hill near the original Confederate Capitol.

The William Lowndes Yancey Law Office in Montgomery, Alabama, was designated a National Historic Landmark of the United States in 1973. Due to unauthorized interior renovations, it was later de-designated, but it remains listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>A rotating frame of reference is a special case of a non-inertial reference frame that is rotating relative to an inertial reference frame. An everyday example of a rotating reference frame is the surface of the Earth. (This article considers only frames rotating about a fixed axis. For more general rotations, see Euler angles.)
==Fictitious forces==

All non-inertial reference frames exhibit fictitious forces; rotating reference frames are characterized by three:

* the centrifugal force,
* the Coriolis force,
and, for non-uniformly rotating reference frames,
* the Euler force.

Scientists in a rotating box can measure the rotation speed and axis of rotation by measuring these fictitious forces. For example, Léon Foucault was able to show the Coriolis force that results from Earth&#x27;s rotation using the Foucault pendulum. If Earth were to rotate many times faster, these fictitious forces could be felt by humans, as they are when on a spinning carousel.

===Centrifugal force===
In classical mechanics, &quot;centrifugal force&quot; is an outward force associated with rotation. Centrifugal force is one of several so-called pseudo-forces (also known as inertial forces), so named because, unlike real forces, they do not originate in interactions with other bodies situated in the environment of the particle upon which they act. Instead, centrifugal force originates in the rotation of the frame of reference within which observations are made.

===Coriolis force===
The mathematical expression for the Coriolis force appeared in an 1835 paper by a French scientist Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis in connection with hydrodynamics, and also in the tidal equations of Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1778. Early in the 20th century, the term Coriolis force began to be used in connection with meteorology.

Perhaps the most commonly encountered rotating reference frame is the Earth. Moving objects on the surface of the Earth experience a Coriolis force, and appear to veer to the right in the northern hemisphere, and to the left in the southern. Movements of air in the atmosphere and water in the ocean are notable examples of this behavior: rather than flowing directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure, as they would on a non-rotating planet, winds and currents tend to flow to the right of this direction north of the equator, and to the left of this direction south of the equator. This effect is responsible for the rotation of large cyclones (see Coriolis effects in meteorology).

===Euler force===

In classical mechanics, the &quot;Euler acceleration&quot; (named for Leonhard Euler), also known as &quot;azimuthal acceleration&quot; or &quot;transverse acceleration&quot; is an acceleration that appears when a non-uniformly rotating reference frame is used for analysis of motion and there is variation in the angular velocity of the reference frame&#x27;s axis. This article is restricted to a frame of reference that rotates about a fixed axis.

The &quot;Euler force&quot; is a fictitious force on a body that is related to the Euler acceleration by &quot;F&quot;  = &quot;ma&quot;, where &quot;a&quot; is the Euler acceleration and &quot;m&quot; is the mass of the body.

==Relating rotating frames to stationary frames==
The following is a derivation of the formulas for accelerations as well as fictitious forces in a rotating frame. It begins with the relation between a particle&#x27;s coordinates in a rotating frame and its coordinates in an inertial (stationary) frame. Then, by taking time derivatives, formulas are derived that relate the velocity of the particle as seen in the two frames, and the acceleration relative to each frame. Using these accelerations, the fictitious forces are identified by comparing Newton&#x27;s second law as formulated in the two different frames.

=== Relation between positions in the two frames ===

To derive these fictitious forces, it&#x27;s helpful to be able to convert between the coordinates formula_1 of the rotating reference frame and the coordinates formula_2 of an inertial reference frame with the same origin. 
If the rotation is about the formula_3 axis with a constant angular velocity formula_4 (so formula_5 and formula_6 which implies formula_7 for some constant formula_8 where formula_9 denotes the angle in the formula_10-plane formed at time formula_11 by formula_12 and the formula_13-axis), 
and if the two reference frames coincide at time formula_14 (meaning formula_15 when formula_16 so take formula_17 or some other integer multiple of formula_18), the transformation from rotating coordinates to inertial coordinates can be written
formula_19
formula_20
whereas the reverse transformation is
formula_21
formula_22

This result can be obtained from a rotation matrix.

Introduce the unit vectors formula_23 representing standard unit basis vectors in the rotating frame. The time-derivatives of these unit vectors are found next. Suppose the frames are aligned at formula_14 and the formula_3-axis is the axis of rotation. Then for a counterclockwise rotation through angle formula_26:
formula_27
where the formula_28 components are expressed in the stationary frame. Likewise,
formula_29

Thus the time derivative of these vectors, which rotate without changing magnitude, is
formula_30
formula_31
where formula_32 
This result is the same as found using a vector cross product with the rotation vector formula_33 pointed along the z-axis of rotation formula_34 namely,
formula_35
where formula_36 is either formula_37 or formula_38

=== Time derivatives in the two frames ===
Introduce unit vectors formula_23, now representing standard unit basis vectors in the general rotating frame. As they rotate they will remain normalized and perpendicular to each other. If they rotate at the speed of formula_40 about an axis along the rotation vector formula_41 then each unit vector formula_36 of the rotating coordinate system (such as formula_43 or formula_44) abides by the following equation:
formula_45
So if formula_46 denotes the transformation taking basis vectors of the inertial- to the rotating frame, with matrix columns equal to the basis vectors of the rotating frame, then the cross product multiplication by the rotation vector is given by formula_47.

If formula_48 is a vector function that is written as
formula_49
and we want to examine its first derivative then (using the product rule of differentiation):
formula_50
where formula_51 denotes the rate of change of formula_48 as observed in the rotating coordinate system. As a shorthand the differentiation is expressed as:
formula_53

This result is also known as the transport theorem in analytical dynamics and is also sometimes referred to as the &quot;basic kinematic equation&quot;.

=== Relation between velocities in the two frames ===
A velocity of an object is the time-derivative of the object&#x27;s position, so

:formula_54

The time derivative of a position formula_55 in a rotating reference frame has two components, one from the explicit time dependence due to motion of the object itself in the rotating reference frame, and another from the frame&#x27;s own rotation. Applying the result of the previous subsection to the displacement formula_56 the velocities in the two reference frames are related by the equation

:formula_57
where subscript formula_58 means the inertial frame of reference, and formula_59 means the rotating frame of reference.

=== Relation between accelerations in the two frames ===
Acceleration is the second time derivative of position, or the first time derivative of velocity

:formula_60
where subscript formula_58 means the inertial frame of reference, formula_59 the rotating frame of reference, and where the expression, again, formula_63 in the bracketed expression on the left is to be interpreted as an operator working onto the bracketed expression on the right.

As formula_64, the first time derivatives of formula_65 inside either frame, when expressed with respect to the basis of e.g. the inertial frame, coincide.
Carrying out the differentiations and re-arranging some terms yields the acceleration &quot;relative to the rotating&quot; reference frame, formula_66

:formula_67

where formula_68 is the apparent acceleration in the rotating reference frame, the term formula_69 represents centrifugal acceleration, and the term formula_70 is the Coriolis acceleration. The last term, formula_71, is the Euler acceleration and is zero in uniformly rotating frames.

=== Newton&#x27;s second law in the two frames ===
When the expression for acceleration is multiplied by the mass of the particle, the three extra terms on the right-hand side result in fictitious forces in the rotating reference frame, that is, apparent forces that result from being in a non-inertial reference frame, rather than from any physical interaction between bodies.

Using Newton&#x27;s second law of motion formula_72 we obtain:

* the Coriolis force formula_73

where formula_76 is the mass of the object being acted upon by these fictitious forces. Notice that all three forces vanish when the frame is not rotating, that is, when formula_77

For completeness, the inertial acceleration formula_78 due to impressed external forces formula_79 can be determined from the total physical force in the inertial (non-rotating) frame (for example, force from physical interactions such as electromagnetic forces) using Newton&#x27;s second law in the inertial frame:

Newton&#x27;s law in the rotating frame then becomes

In other words, to handle the laws of motion in a rotating reference frame:


==Use in magnetic resonance==
It is convenient to consider magnetic resonance in a frame that rotates at the Larmor frequency of the spins. This is illustrated in the animation below. The rotating wave approximation may also be used.

<doc id="1209824" wikidata="Q3099011" url="?curid=1209824" title="Solace (Sarah McLachlan album)">
<text>Solace is the second studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan, released in June 1991, on Nettwerk in Canada and in January 1992, on Arista Records in the United States. It was the album that first made her a star in Canada, spawning the hit singles &quot;The Path of Thorns (Terms)&quot; and &quot;Into the Fire&quot; (Mclachlan appeared nude in both the accompanying videos) and being certified double platinum for sales of 200,000 copies in Canada. This was also the first of many Sarah McLachlan albums produced by Pierre Marchand.

Although the album received favourable reviews internationally, her commercial breakthrough outside of Canada would not come until her next full album, &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot;. Although McLachlan has not discarded the album&#x27;s songs from her concerts so completely as those of &quot;Touch&quot;, nothing from &quot;Solace&quot; has been performed live since 1999 except for “The Path of Thorns (Terms)”, which was performed 19 times between 2010 and 2012.

==Critical reception==
In a rave review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Steve Hochman said that &quot;Solace&quot; &quot;gorgeously recalls&quot; Joni Mitchell, Judy Collins, and Sandy Denny &quot;without sounding derivative&quot;, praising McLachlan&#x27;s &quot;strong, emotional songwriting and singing&quot; and Marchand&#x27;s &quot;atmospheric yet involving production&quot;. Gary Dretzka was more ambivalent in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, commenting that the album&#x27;s songs &quot;are not without some poetic beauty&quot;, but &quot;no one piece really stands out&quot; due to their similar &quot;somber emotional range&quot;. Writing for &quot;NME&quot;, David Quantick found the record merely promising, with &quot;hints of possible excellence&quot;.

Retrospectively, AllMusic critic Kelly McCartney deemed &quot;Solace&quot; &quot;a wonderful record that offers a glimpse of the astounding talent of a young Sarah McLachlan&quot;, writing that McLachlan avoided the &quot;sophomore jinx&quot; with &quot;a superior collection of songs and performances&quot;. Richard Skanse stated in the 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; that &quot;Solace&quot; &quot;represented a considerable leap in maturity and focus&quot; for McLachlan, noting the album&#x27;s &quot;less muddled&quot; production and its songs&#x27; &quot;sharper hooks and distinctive melodies&quot;.

<doc id="1209826" wikidata="Q1335365" url="?curid=1209826" title="Security token">
<text>A security token is a peripheral device used to gain access to an electronically restricted resource. The token is used in addition to, or in place of, a password. Examples of security tokens include wireless key cards used to open locked doors, a banking token used as a digital authenticator for signing in to online banking, or signing transactions such as wire transfers.

Security tokens can be used to store information such as passwords, cryptographic keys used to generate digital signatures, or biometric data (such as fingerprints). Some designs incorporate tamper resistant packaging, while others may include small keypads to allow entry of a PIN or a simple button to start a generation routine with some display capability to show a generated key number. Connected tokens utilize a variety of interfaces including USB, near-field communication (NFC), radio-frequency identification (RFID), or Bluetooth. Some tokens have audio capabilities designed for those who are vision-impaired.

== Password types ==

All tokens contain some secret information used to prove identity. There are four different ways in which this information can be used:
; Static password token: The device contains a password that is physically hidden (not visible to the possessor), but is transmitted for each authentication. This type is vulnerable to replay attacks.

; Synchronous dynamic password token: A timer is used to rotate through various combinations produced by a cryptographic algorithm. The token and the authentication server must have synchronized clocks.

; Asynchronous password token: A one-time password is generated without the use of a clock, either from a one-time pad or cryptographic algorithm.

; Challenge–response token: Using public key cryptography, it is possible to prove possession of a private key without revealing that key. The authentication server encrypts a challenge (typically a random number, or at least data with some random parts) with a public key; the device proves it possesses a copy of the matching private key by providing the decrypted challenge.

Time-synchronized, one-time passwords change constantly at a set time interval; e.g., once per minute. To do this, some sort of synchronization must exist between the client&#x27;s token and the authentication server. For disconnected tokens, this time-synchronization is done before the token is distributed to the client. Other token types do the synchronization when the token is inserted into an input device. The main problem with time-synchronized tokens is that they can, over time, become unsynchronized. However, some such systems, such as RSA&#x27;s SecurID, allow the user to re-synchronize the server with the token, sometimes by entering several consecutive passcodes. Most also cannot have replaceable batteries and only last up to 5 years before having to be replaced – so there is an additional cost.
Another type of one-time password uses a complex mathematical algorithm, such as a hash chain, to generate a series of one-time passwords from a secret shared key. Each password is unique, even when previous passwords are known. The open-source OATH algorithm is standardized; other algorithms are covered by US patents. Each password is observably unpredictable and independent of previous ones, whereby an adversary would be unable to guess what the next password may be, even with knowledge of all previous passwords.

==Physical types==
Tokens can contain chips with functions varying from very simple to very complex, including multiple authentication methods.

The simplest security tokens do not need any connection to a computer. The tokens have a physical display; the authenticating user simply enters the displayed number to log in. Other tokens connect to the computer using wireless techniques, such as Bluetooth. These tokens transfer a key sequence to the local client or to a nearby access point.

Alternatively, another form of token that has been widely available for many years is a mobile device which communicates using an out-of-band channel (like voice, SMS, or USSD).

Still other tokens plug into the computer and may require a PIN. Depending on the type of the token, the computer OS will then either read the key from the token and perform a cryptographic operation on it, or ask the token&#x27;s firmware to perform this operation.

A related application is the hardware dongle required by some computer programs to prove ownership of the software. The dongle is placed in an input device and the software accesses the I/O device in question to authorize the use of the software in question.

Commercial solutions are provided by a variety of vendors, each with their own proprietary (and often patented) implementation of variously used security features. Token designs meeting certain security standards are certified in the United States as compliant with FIPS 140, a federal security standard. Tokens without any kind of certification are sometimes viewed as suspect, as they often do not meet accepted government or industry security standards, have not been put through rigorous testing, and likely cannot provide the same level of cryptographic security as token solutions which have had their designs independently audited by third-party agencies.

=== Disconnected tokens ===

Disconnected tokens have neither a physical nor logical connection to the client computer. They typically do not require a special input device, and instead use a built-in screen to display the generated authentication data, which the user enters manually themselves via a keyboard or keypad. Disconnected tokens are the most common type of security token used (usually in combination with a password) in two-factor authentication for online identification.

=== Connected tokens ===
Connected tokens are tokens that must be physically connected to the computer with which the user is authenticating. Tokens in this category automatically transmit the authentication information to the client computer once a physical connection is made, eliminating the need for the user to manually enter the authentication information. However, in order to use a connected token, the appropriate input device must be installed. The most common types of physical tokens are smart cards and USB tokens (also called &quot;security keys&quot;), which require a smart card reader and a USB port respectively. Increasingly, FIDO2 tokens, supported by the open specification group FIDO Alliance have become popular for consumers with mainstream browser support beginning in 2015 and supported by popular websites and social media sites.

Older PC card tokens are made to work primarily with laptops. Type II PC Cards are preferred as a token as they are half as thick as Type III.

The audio jack port is a relatively practical method to establish connection between mobile devices, such as iPhone, iPad and Android, and other accessories. The most well known device is called Square, a credit card reader for iOS and Android devices.

Some use a special purpose interface (e.g. the crypto ignition key deployed by the United States National Security Agency). Tokens can also be used as a photo ID card. Cell phones and PDAs can also serve as security tokens with proper programming.

==== Smart cards ====

Many connected tokens use smart card technology. Smart cards can be very cheap (around ten cents) and contain proven security mechanisms (as used by financial institutions, like cash cards). However, computational performance of smart cards is often rather limited because of extreme low power consumption and ultra-thin form-factor requirements.

Smart-card-based USB tokens which contain a smart card chip inside provide the functionality of both USB tokens and smart cards. They enable a broad range of security solutions and provide the abilities and security of a traditional smart card without requiring a unique input device. From the computer operating system&#x27;s point of view such a token is a USB-connected smart card reader with one non-removable smart card present.

=== Contactless tokens ===
Unlike connected tokens, contactless tokens form a logical connection to the client computer but do not require a physical connection. The absence of the need for physical contact makes them more convenient than both connected and disconnected tokens. As a result, contactless tokens are a popular choice for keyless entry systems and electronic payment solutions such as Mobil Speedpass, which uses RFID to transmit authentication info from a keychain token. However, there have been various security concerns raised about RFID tokens after researchers at Johns Hopkins University and RSA Laboratories discovered that RFID tags could be easily cracked and cloned.

Another downside is that contactless tokens have relatively short battery lives; usually only 5–6 years, which is low compared to USB tokens which may last more than 10 years. Some tokens however do allow the batteries to be changed, thus reducing costs.

==== Bluetooth tokens ====
The Bluetooth Low Energy protocols provide long lasting battery lifecycle of wireless transmission.

* The transmission of inherent Bluetooth identity data is the lowest quality for supporting authentication. 
* A bidirectional connection for transactional data interchange serves for the most sophisticated authentication procedures.

Although, the automatic transmission power control attempts for radial distance estimates. The escape is available apart from the standardised Bluetooth power control algorithm to provide a calibration on minimally required transmission power.

Bluetooth tokens are often combined with a USB token, thus working in both a connected and a disconnected state. Bluetooth authentication works when closer than . When the Bluetooth link is not properly operable, the token may be inserted into a USB input device to function.

Another combination is with a smart card to store locally larger amounts of identity data and process information as well. Another is a contactless BLE token that combines secure storage and tokenized release of fingerprint credentials.

In the USB mode of operation sign-off requires care for the token while mechanically coupled to the USB plug. The advantage with the Bluetooth mode of operation is the option of combining sign-off with distance metrics. Respective products are in preparation, following the concepts of electronic leash.

==== NFC tokens ====

Near-field communication (NFC) tokens combined with a Bluetooth token may operate in several modes, thus working in both a connected and a disconnected state. NFC authentication works when closer than . The NFC protocol bridges short distances to the reader while the Bluetooth connection serves for data provision with the token to enable authentication. Also when the Bluetooth link is not connected, the token may serve the locally stored authentication information in coarse positioning to the NFC reader and relieves from exact positioning to a connector.

=== Single sign-on software tokens ===
Some types of single sign-on (SSO) solutions, like enterprise single sign-on, use the token to store software that allows for seamless authentication and password filling. As the passwords are stored on the token, users need not remember their passwords and therefore can select more secure passwords, or have more secure passwords assigned. Usually most tokens store a cryptographic hash of the password so that if the token is compromised, the password is still protected.

=== Programmable tokens ===
Programmable tokens are marketed as &quot;drop-in&quot; replacement of mobile applications such as Google Authenticator (miniOTP). They can be used as mobile app replacement, as well as in parallel as a backup.

== Vulnerabilities ==

=== Loss and theft ===

The simplest vulnerability with any password container is theft or loss of the device. The chances of this happening, or happening unaware, can be reduced with physical security measures such as locks, electronic leash, or body sensor and alarm. Stolen tokens can be made useless by using two factor authentication. Commonly, in order to authenticate, a personal identification number (PIN) must be entered along with the information provided by the token the same time as the output of the token.

=== Attacking ===

Any system which allows users to authenticate via an untrusted network (such as the Internet) is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. In this type of attack, an attacker acts as the &quot;go-between&quot; of the user and the legitimate system, soliciting the token output from the legitimate user and then supplying it to the authentication system themselves. Since the token value is mathematically correct, the authentication succeeds and the fraudster is granted access. In 2006, Citibank was the victim of an attack when its hardware-token-equipped business users became the victims of a large Ukrainian-based man-in-the-middle phishing operation.

=== Breach of codes ===

In 2012, the Prosecco research team at INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt developed an efficient method of extracting the secret key from several PKCS #11 cryptographic devices. These findings were documented in INRIA Technical Report RR-7944, ID hal-00691958, and published at CRYPTO 2012.

== Digital signature ==

Trusted as a regular hand-written signature, the digital signature must be made with a private key known only to the person authorized to make the signature. Tokens that allow secure on-board generation and storage of private keys enable secure digital signatures, and can also be used for user authentication, as the private key also serves as a proof of the user&#x27;s identity.

For tokens to identify the user, all tokens must have some kind of number that is unique. Not all approaches fully qualify as digital signatures according to some national laws. Tokens with no on-board keyboard or another user interface cannot be used in some signing scenarios, such as confirming a bank transaction based on the bank account number that the funds are to be transferred to.

<text>Shield bearer usually refers to a Macedonian version of a heavy armored hoplite, whose tasks were protecting flanks of the sarrisa phalanx, and carrying a shield to protect other people in same ranks. A commander might be protected by several shield bearers. In combat, the shield bearers served as core of Macedonian army along with sarissa pike men, usually protecting flanks of the pike infantry. Other types of soldiers that made use of shield bearers included charioteers, archers, crossbowmen, and early handgunners.

<text>Sir John Floyer (3 March 1649 – 1 February 1734) was an English physician and author.

==Early life==
John Floyer was born on 3 March 1649. He was the third child and second son of Elizabeth Babington and Richard Floyer, of Hints Hall, a since demolished country house. Hints is a quiet village lying a short distance from Lichfield in Staffordshire. He was educated at The Queen&#x27;s College, University of Oxford.

==Career==
He practised in Lichfield, and it was by his advice that Dr Johnson, when a child, was taken by his mother to be touched by Queen Anne for the king&#x27;s evil on 30 March 1714. As a physician, Floyer was best known for introducing the practice of pulse rate measurement, and creating a special watch for this purpose. He was an advocate of cold bathing, and gave an early account of the pathological changes in the lungs associated with emphysema.

==Personal life==
Floyer was married to Mary Fleetwood of Lichfield, a widow, in April 1680.
Their son John Floyer (1681–1762) was a Tory Member of Parliament for Tamworth from 1741 to 1742.

He died on 1 February 1734.
