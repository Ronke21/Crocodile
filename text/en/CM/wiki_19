<text>Bipolar coordinates are a two-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system based on the Apollonian circles. There is also a third system, based on two poles (biangular coordinates). 

The term &quot;bipolar&quot; is further used on occasion to describe other curves having two singular points (foci), such as ellipses, hyperbolas, and Cassini ovals. However, the term &quot;bipolar coordinates&quot; is reserved for the coordinates described here, and never used for systems associated with those other curves, such as elliptic coordinates.

== Definition ==
The system is based on two foci &quot;F&quot;1 and &quot;F&quot;2. Referring to the figure at right, the &quot;σ&quot;-coordinate of a point &quot;P&quot; equals the angle &quot;F&quot;1 &quot;P&quot; &quot;F&quot;2, and the &quot;τ&quot;-coordinate equals the natural logarithm of the ratio of the distances &quot;d&quot;1 and &quot;d&quot;2:

:formula_1

If, in the Cartesian system, the foci are taken to lie at (−&quot;a&quot;, 0) and (&quot;a&quot;, 0), the coordinates of the point &quot;P&quot; are

:formula_2

The coordinate &quot;τ&quot; ranges from formula_3 (for points close to &quot;F&quot;1) to formula_4 (for points close to &quot;F&quot;2). The coordinate &quot;σ&quot; is only defined modulo &quot;2π&quot;, and is best taken to range from &quot;-π&quot; to &quot;π&quot;, by taking it as the negative of the acute angle &quot;F&quot;1 &quot;P&quot; &quot;F&quot;2 if &quot;P&quot; is in the lower half plane.

== Proof that coordinate system is orthogonal ==

The equations for &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; can be combined to give

:formula_5
or
:formula_6

This equation shows that &quot;σ&quot; and &quot;τ&quot; are the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function of &quot;x+iy&quot; (with logarithmic branch points at the foci), which in turn proves (by appeal to the general theory of conformal mapping) (the Cauchy-Riemann equations) that these particular curves of &quot;σ&quot; and &quot;τ&quot; intersect at right angles, i.e., it is an orthogonal coordinate system.

== Curves of constant &quot;σ&quot; and &quot;τ&quot; ==

The curves of constant &quot;σ&quot; correspond to non-concentric circles 

{\sin^2 \sigma}
= a^2(1+\cot^2\sigma)&lt;/math&gt;|(1)|RawN=.}}

that intersect at the two foci. The centers of the constant-&quot;σ&quot; circles lie on the &quot;y&quot;-axis at formula_7 with radius formula_8. Circles of positive &quot;σ&quot; are centered above the &quot;x&quot;-axis, whereas those of negative &quot;σ&quot; lie below the axis. As the magnitude |&quot;σ&quot;|- &quot;π&quot;/2 decreases, the radius of the circles decreases and the center approaches the origin (0, 0), which is reached when |&quot;σ&quot;| = &quot;π&quot;/2. (From elementary geometry, all triangles on a circle with 2 vertices on opposite ends of a diameter are right triangles.)

The curves of constant formula_9 are non-intersecting circles of different radii

that surround the foci but again are not concentric. The centers of the constant-&quot;τ&quot; circles lie on the &quot;x&quot;-axis at formula_10 with radius formula_11. The circles of positive &quot;τ&quot; lie in the right-hand side of the plane (&quot;x&quot; &gt; 0), whereas the circles of negative &quot;τ&quot; lie in the left-hand side of the plane (&quot;x&quot; &lt; 0). The &quot;τ&quot; = 0 curve corresponds to the &quot;y&quot;-axis (&quot;x&quot; = 0). As the magnitude of &quot;τ&quot; increases, the radius of the circles decreases and their centers approach the foci.

==Inverse relations==
The passage from the Cartesian coordinates towards the bipolar coordinates can be done via the following formulas:
:formula_12
and
:formula_13

The coordinates also have the identities: 
:formula_14
and
:formula_15
which can derived by solving Eq. (1) and (2) for formula_16 and formula_17, respectively.

== Scale factors ==
To obtain the scale factors for bipolar coordinates, we take the differential of the equation for formula_18, which gives
:formula_19
Multiplying this equation with its complex conjugate yields
:formula_20
Employing the trigonometric identities for products of sines and cosines, we obtain
:formula_21
from which it follows that
:formula_22

Hence the scale factors for &quot;σ&quot; and &quot;τ&quot; are equal, and given by
:formula_23

Many results now follow in quick succession from the general formulae for orthogonal coordinates.
Thus, the infinitesimal area element equals

:formula_24

and the Laplacian is given by 

:formula_25

Expressions for formula_26, formula_27, and formula_28 can be expressed obtained by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in orthogonal coordinates.

==Applications==
The classic applications of bipolar coordinates are in solving partial differential equations, e.g., Laplace&#x27;s equation or the Helmholtz equation, for which bipolar coordinates allow a separation of variables. An example is the electric field surrounding two parallel cylindrical conductors with unequal diameters.

==Extension to 3-dimensions==
Bipolar coordinates form the basis for several sets of three-dimensional orthogonal coordinates.

*The bipolar cylindrical coordinates are produced by translating the bipolar coordinates along the &quot;z&quot;-axis, i.e., the out-of-plane axis.

*The bispherical coordinates are produced by rotating the bipolar coordinates about the &quot;x&quot;-axis, i.e., the axis connecting the foci.

*The toroidal coordinates are produced by rotating the bipolar coordinates about the &quot;y&quot;-axis, i.e., the axis separating the foci.

<doc id="1197436" wikidata="Q317145" url="?curid=1197436" title="Ozurgeti">
<text>Ozurgeti ( ) is the capital of the western Georgian province of Guria. It was formerly known as Macharadze or Makharadze (named in honor of Filipp Makharadze). It is a regional center of tea and hazelnut processing. Ozurgeti is also administrative center of Ozurgeti District.

==Geography==

Ozurgeti is above sea level. Most of the town is located between the Bzhuzhi and Natanebi rivers. The Natanebi is a subterranean river in Ozurgeti, with a good deal of the city built on top of it, while the Bzhuzhi flows above ground. The city is bounded by hills in the north and south.

Ozurgeti sits on a slope that was leveled into three broad terraces: The market district, containing bazaars and small shops, as well as a plaza overlooked by a statue of a mermaid, is on the lowermost level. Most of the city’s public buildings—including municipal buildings, the cinema, the theater, and museums—as well as parks, are on the middle terrace. The highest level contains mostly private housing.

==Climate==
The city has a humid subtropical climate, and experiences significant rainfall throughout the year. January is the coldest month and August is the hottest. Snow is rare and occurs primarily in January, February, and early March.

==History==

Ozurgeti was founded in the late Middle Ages, and is first mentioned by name in 1578 in the &quot;New Georgian Chronicles&quot; (ახალი ქართლის ცხოვრობა, akhali qartlis tskhovroba). It became the centre of Guria soon after, serving as an important centre for trade and the home of the rulers of the Principality of Guria. The later discovery of a hoard of 270 silver coins under the city, the &quot;Ozurgeti Treasure,&quot; is testament to this.

On December 14, 1846, Ozurgeti was designated as a city. At that time there were just over 300 residents, though the population grew as the city gained importance: by 1865 it had grown to over 700. It served as a strategic place for the course of the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78). It was the fourth city in Georgia to have a legal printing press, which began in 1891. During the Russian Empire, the city was the administrative center of the Ozurgeti Uyezd of the Kutaisi Governorate. On December 26, 1923, a rail line had been established, connecting Ozurgeti with the rest of the country. It was renamed &quot;Makharadze&quot; on July 9, 1934, in honour of the Georgian Bolshevik Filipp Makharadze. It would revert to its original name on May 15, 1989.

==Demographics==
According to the 2014 Census, the city had a population of 14,785. In 2010, the population was estimated to be 20,636. The city is 94.5% ethnic Georgian, 3.8% Armenian, and 0.8% Russian. According to official statistics, 10% of the population lives below the poverty line and the unemployment rate is 15%. In 2020, the population was estimated to be 14,372.

==Culture==

===Theater===
The Ozurgeti Dramatic Theatre overlooks the city&#x27;s central square. It is named in honor of Alexander Tsutsunava, whose statue stands in an adjoining park. It was founded in 1868, and the first production was a performance by local amateur actors. A new theater building was constructed in 1914. In 1933, another new building was constructed. In 1962, the theater was moved to yet another building, the five-storey Soviet Neoclassical-style structure in which it currently resides. It is one of the largest theaters in Georgia. In 1968, a large centennial celebration was held in the building and the theater was named after Tsutsunava. In 2005, the Ministry of Culture and the Theater Workers’ Union declared the Ozurgeti Dramatic Theater to be the best regional theater in Georgia.

===History Museum===
The Ozurgeti History Museum was founded in 1936, moved to Gurieli Palace in 1974, and relocated to its current site in 1991. The museum contains over 6,000 artifacts, and it currently includes archaeological, numismatic, ethnographic, heraldic, sphragistic, and historical exhibits, and perhaps most prominently displayed among them is a sword that allegedly belonged to Napoleon Bonaparte. It also houses a collection of old printed books.

===Public life===
There are 15 NGOs in Ozurgeti, most of which focus on the city’s youth, civil society, democracy, women’s rights, and agronomy. There is a branch of the Georgian Young Lawyers’ Association in the city. The television station Guria TV, which broadcasts to the entire region, is also based in the city.

The city has three newspapers, some of which serve the entire region. Several other cultural organizations exist in the city: A city library, a children’s theater, and a modern art gallery.

==Notable structures==
An ancient Byzantine-era bathhouse was recently discovered in central Ozurgeti and the ruins are under excavation. It is a two storey-structure. The lower, subterranean floor was the fire chamber which heated an upper floor that contained public baths.

Gurieli Palace, constructed in 1873, is also near the city center. It currently serves as the seat of the Shemokmedi Orthodox Bishopric.

==Education==

The first school in the city was established on February 21, 1850. At various times, Simon Gugunava, Niko Mari, and Ekvtime Takaishvili attended the school. On July 1, 1874, the school came under municipal administration. Interest in education and literacy was increasing at this time. Due to widespread political activism among the student population, the school was briefly closed on the order of the Transcaucasia Governorate near the end of the 19th century.

In the beginning of the 20th century, Constantine Leselidze and Porfiry Chanchibadze also attended the school. In 1918, the city school introduced elementary-level education. In 1922, due to increasing attendance, a new school, thereafter called School #2, was opened. Both schools offered education to the 7th grade.

There are now five public schools, two parochial schools, nine kindergartens, and one art school in Ozurgeti. , the total number of students enrolled in primary and secondary schools was roughly 2,850, and there were 236 teachers. There is also a vocational college with some 500 students and 30 instructors.

==Sports==
Ozurgeti has rugby and football clubs. There are two stadia in the city: Friendship Stadium belongs to the municipality and is used by the football club; Zvani Stadium is used by the rugby club. In 2007, a “sport palace,” containing a space that can be converted into a miniature football stadium, a volleyball court, a basketball court, and a wrestling ring, was built. The city operates a municipal sports school including a tae kwon do club, a basketball club, a tennis club, a boxing club, a track club, a judo club, a weightlifting club, a freestyle wrestling club, and a hockey club.

<doc id="1197437" wikidata="Q1464956" url="?curid=1197437" title="Shower (juggling)">
<text>In toss juggling, the shower is a juggling pattern for 3 or more objects, most commonly balls or bean bags, where objects are thrown in a circular motion. Balls are thrown high from one hand to the other while the other hand passes the ball back horizontally. &quot;In the shower pattern, every ball is thrown in a high arc from the right hand to the left (or vice versa) and then quickly passed off with a low throw from the left to the right hand (or vice versa).&quot; The animation depicts a 3-ball version. Siteswap notation for shower patterns is (2n-1)1, where n is the number of objects juggled. (i.e. 31 for 2 balls, 51 for 3 balls, 71 for 4 balls, etc...)
The circular motion of the balls is commonly represented in cartoons as the archetypical juggling pattern, somewhat at odds with reality, where the cascade is more common. By constantly reversing the direction, the box pattern can be formed.

There are two different types of shower: synchronous shower, where both hands throw their ball at the same time and asynchronous shower. The half-shower resembles the shower, but is siteswap 3. It is, &quot;one of the best of all the routines for strengthening and for improving all-around agility and coordination.&quot; A variant of the shower or shape distortion of the half-shower, the Statue of Liberty (siteswap: 3), involves one overhead hand.

One attraction of the shower pattern is that it does not change with increasing numbers of props. &quot;The props follow each other around in circles.&quot; The four-ball pattern is exactly the same as the three-ball pattern, except that the balls are thrown higher or faster. This is unlike a cascade pattern for odd numbers of props, which must be juggled as a fountain if another prop is added.

The easiest shower is the two-ball shower which many people often define as juggling. Asked to demonstrate juggling with two objects the average person is likely to throw one in the air, pass across the other, and catch the first in the other hand. Performed continuously, this is a two-ball shower. However this two object shower is not defined as toss juggling which is most usually defined as the manipulation of more objects than the number of hands doing the manipulation.

A three-ball shower is significantly more difficult for a beginner than a three-ball cascade, due to the height, speed, and asymmetry of the two throws. However, once mastered it is easy to perform for long periods, or to combine with other tricks. &quot;The shower is more complicated than the cascade, but some people find that the movement comes naturally to them.&quot;

<text>Moulton B. &quot;Molt&quot; Taylor (September 29, 1912 – November 16, 1995) was an American aeronautical engineer famed for his work designing, developing, and manufacturing on a small scale one of the first practical flying cars, the 1949 Aerocar.

== Life and career ==

Taylor was born in Portland, Oregon and studied engineering at the University of Washington. After graduation, he was accepted into the United States Navy as a Naval Aviator during World War II, and spent much of the war working on the Navy&#x27;s Gorgon missile program, for which he was awarded the Legion of Merit medal. Shortly after the war, he designed his first flying car, the Aerocar, and founded Aerocar International in Longview, Washington, to develop, manufacture and market the aircraft. Taylor came up with the idea for the Aerocar in 1946, after meeting inventor Robert Edison Fulton Jr. and noticing the flaws in his Airphibian roadable aircraft design. To date, Taylor&#x27;s Aerocar remains the closest that any such design came to actual mass production, but eventually only six models were built.

Although Taylor continued to push for the viability of the flying car throughout the rest of his life, he also designed a number of only slightly more conventional designs for the homebuilt aircraft market, including the Taylor Coot amphibian and the Aerocar IMP family of light sport planes (which consists of the Mini, Micro and Ultra IMP).

In a 1979 article about the future of flight past the year 2000, Taylor somewhat inaccurately predicted widespread use of flying autos and pusher configurations, however he did accurately predict the mainstream use of carbon materials for lightweight spars and wing ribs.

He also gave frequent help and advice to the Klapmeier brothers throughout the 1980s on their first design, the pusher-propeller homebuilt Cirrus VK-30.

== Awards and honors ==
He was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal from the Franklin Institute in 1960. In 1975, he received the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) Dr. August Raspet Memorial Award for &quot;significant advancements in the field of light aircraft design&quot;. Six days before his death in 1995, Taylor was inducted into the EAA Hall of Fame.

The Kelso-Longview Regional Airport is also known as the &quot;Molt Taylor Field&quot;.

<text>Appleton was a Canadian musical duo composed of sisters Natalie and Nicole Appleton. The sisters are better known as members of the girl group All Saints.

==Career==
In 2002, after All Saints disbanded, Natalie and Nicole formed the duo Appleton and signed with Polydor. In September 2002, they released their first single &quot;Fantasy&quot;, written with Andy Hayman and Gareth Young, which reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart. Their autobiography, &quot;Together&quot;, came out in October 2002. The sisters releases stated that director David Slade announced he would direct the autobiographical book into a film, but that has yet to happen. In 2003, they had two more hits with &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry&quot; and &quot;Everything Eventually&quot; and the album, &quot;Everything&#x27;s Eventual&quot; which went silver in the UK.

In 2004 they left Polydor and signed with Concept Music. Their second album was cancelled after All Saints&#x27; return in 2006.

<text>1000 Mona Lisas were an American punk band from Hollywood, California, United States, formed in 1992. They found minor success in 1995 with their cover of Alanis Morissette&#x27;s &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;. It first became popular when they performed it live at The Whisky A Go Go, after which, almost as an afterthought, the band decided to include it on their debut EP as a hidden track after much cajoling by their A&amp;R guy Brian Malouf. Before signing with RCA Records, the band became popular performing throughout Southern California often, also through extensive DIY touring of the west coast and posting songs and ticket giveaways on the internet, which was an unusual practice at the time. They released a full-length album on RCA on February 27, 1996, titled &quot;New Disease&quot; produced by Geza X which was the first major label release to be offered via the internet before its street date release through a site called IUMA (Internet Underground Music Archive). The band members were Armando Prado (guitar, vocals) Gianni Neiviller (bass, vocals) Rocco Bidlovski (drums, vocals).

<text>Sawston is a large village in Cambridgeshire in England, situated on the River Cam about south of Cambridge with a population of 7,271.

The village has historical roots dating back to medieval times and has landmarks such as Sawston Hall, a Grade I listed Tudor manor house, and St. Mary&#x27;s Church, which dates back to the 13th century.

It is best known for its once notable paper and leather industry dating back to the 17th century and the opening of the first village college, Sawston Village College, in 1930.

==Etymology==
The historical forms of Sawston suggest a variety of spellings over time, such as Salsingetune, Salsintona, Salsiton(e), and many others. These variations reflect the evolution of the name over centuries. The suggested etymology derives &quot;Sawston&quot; from &quot;Salse,&quot; potentially indicating ownership or association with a person named Salse, along with the Old English suffix &quot;-ingatūn,&quot; meaning a settlement or farmstead. &quot;Salse&quot; is believed to be a shortened form of names beginning with &quot;Sele-,&quot; and it corresponds to similar forms in Old Swedish and Old Norse . Thus, &quot;Sawston&quot; likely originated from a combination of these elements, ultimately meaning something like &quot;Salse&#x27;s farmstead&quot; or &quot;settlement of Salse&#x27;s people.&quot;

==History==
===Prehistory===

Although the current village of Sawston has only existed as anything more than a hamlet for 400 to 600 years, there is evidence for a settlement in the vicinity dating back to the early Bronze Age almost 5,000 years ago. The northern high-ground in Sawston would have been the only vantage point from which to view the ancient Hill figures discovered in the Wandlebury section of the Wheatsheaf Duxford.

===Domesday Book===
In the Domesday Book of 1086, Sawston is recorded as being in the hundred of Whittlesford and the county of Cambridgeshire. It is recorded to have 38 households, placing it in the top 20% of settlements in terms of population. Divided among three owners—Count Robert of Mortain, Geoffrey de Mandeville, and Eudo the steward—Sawston&#x27;s social fabric comprised lords, villagers, smallholders, and even slaves. The land was primarily used for agriculture, with ploughlands, meadows, and mills contributing to its annual valuation of £19 for all lands. Before the Norman Conquest of 1066, the previous overlords of Sawston where some of the notable figures in England including: Earl Harold and King Edward.

===Sawston Hall===

 Sawston Hall is a Grade I listed Tudor manor house dating from the 16th century. It has many fine features, such as the magnificent Great Hall complete with Elizabethan panelling and a large Tudor fireplace with fireback dated 1571. The house also has its own panelled private chapel which has an 18th-century decorated plaster ceiling and wonderful stained glass windows. On the first floor there is a long gallery and a bedroom where Queen Mary I is rumoured to have slept.

The hall is surrounded by almost of grounds which includes a Site of Special Scientific Interest protected by Natural England due to the presence of Cambridge Milk Parsley, a rare English native plant. The ground also include a number of naturally fed springs, woodland walks, a half moat and a number of smaller landscaped gardens.

===Sawston Cross===

Until 1815 the village of Sawston had an ancient cross, possibly erected by the Knights Templar. The cross had many purposes, even as a location where public officers administered justice during the 13th century. It survived the rage of the Puritans in the civil wars, but was torn down between the summer of 1815 and autumn of 1816, along with the surrounding amphitheatre-like enclosure, the stocks and ancient sycamore tree, and sold by greedy village elders to make way for redevelopment. William Hone&#x27;s &quot;Table-book&quot; includes a contributor&#x27;s description when he stumbled across the villagers discussing whether or not to tear down the cross. A poem comparing Sawstonites to the Jews, which would today appear to be antisemitic, was subsequently published in the 1827 journal:

The Jews of old, as we&#x27;ve been told——
 And Scriptures pure disclose——
With harden&#x27;d hearts drew lots for parts
 Of our Salvator&#x27;s clothes.

The modern Jews ——the Sawstonites——
As harden&#x27;d as the Israelites——
 In ignorance still more gross——
Thinking they could no longer thrive
By Christian means, did means contrive——
 Draw lots, and sold the cross!
===Recent history===
Sawston has seen substantial development since the end of the Second World War and, more recently, a number of large housing estates have been constructed, most notably to the north-west and south of the village. This development has led to the area of Sawston spreading into the small nearby village of Pampisford.

Sawston has been earmarked for development to meet Cambridgeshire&#x27;s housing needs, including in the 2013 Local Plan from South Cambridgeshire District Council currently under review by the Planning Inspectorate. Work on a new Community Hub - a flexible meeting place and library (in temporary buildings following the 2012 fire at the Walnut Gallery, SVC)-was completed in 2022. It is located adjacent to the Marven Centre on New Road.

As well as housing developments on either side of the Babraham Road, approval has been given for the building of a 3,000 capacity football stadium to house Cambridge City F.C.

==Geology==
The underground structure of Sawston is the same as that of the region – permeable chalk and impermeable clay. The low-lying nature of the village is indicative of a former flood plain which still tends towards the moist, although comparatively recent dredging of the local ditches and rivers has alleviated the general flooding problem. The chalky nature of the local geology provides for a clean, if hard, water supply as it is drawn from artesian wells in the area. The chalk and clay in the area contains a large quantity of flint that often finds its way into older local construction.

There is a hill, Huckeridge Hill, to the north west of the village. At 32 m it is a good viewpoint for Little Trees Hill (itself the highest point of Magog Down in the Gog Magog Hills) across the valley of the Granta.

==Industry==
For the last couple of hundred years, the two principal industries in Sawston&#x27;s environs have been Paper &amp; Printing and Leather. 
The original paper mill in Sawston is on the current Spicers site, named after the family who owned the mill in the last century. This complex is located at the north-west corner of the parish.

There are two sites in Sawston which support or have formerly supported Tanning facilities. The site south of the village centre and backing onto the grounds of the Sawston manor house – Sawston Hall – is the Hutchins and Harding site. The other site is on the southern border of the village, crossing over into neighbouring Pampisford, the Eastern Counties Leather site which has now been mostly converted into a general industrial estate. These industries were introduced into Sawston to take advantage of the clean water supply. Examination reveals that both sites are located on bore holes or streams.

A further large industrial estate exists in the north of the village adjacent to Babraham Road.

==Local government==

Sawston Parish Council has a nominal 19 seats, so at the May 2016 elections 15 Councillors were elected unopposed, for a period of two years. The Council moved to a new office building on Link Road in 2011. This incorporates an office for the village History Society. Sawston Parish Council is active in many aspects of village life, including village facilities (recreation grounds, community buildings etc.) and organising events (such as annual bonfire nights).

Sawston is a two-seat Ward within the South Cambridgeshire District Council local government area. This is responsible for Planning, waste collection and the provision of local services such as street lighting. It is currently represented by Maria King and Brian Milnes, both of the Liberal Democrat Party, and both elected in the 2021 Cambridgeshire County Council election.

Sawston is a two-seat Cambridgeshire County Council District with its last elections in May 2017 (following Boundary Commission review.) It is currently represented by Brian Milnes and Maria King, both of the Liberal Democrat party.

Nationally, Sawston is in the South Cambridgeshire constituency for representation in the Westminster Parliament – a seat currently held by Pippa Heylings of the Liberal Democrats since the 2024 United Kingdom general election. It hosts hustings every election in the Free Church.

A dedicated walking and cycling path connects the station to the Unity Campus business park in the southern part of the village.Sawston is also within close proximity to Shelford railway station and the now-disused Pampisford station, formerly on the Stour Valley Railway.

A cycle path linking Sawston with Babraham, and Babraham with Abington was completed in October 2010, at a cost of £350,000. The route will eventually cross the A11 using the existing footbridge and join the National Cycle Network route 11.

==International links==
The village has been twinned with the German town of Selsingen since Klaus Bruno Pape&#x27;s visit to Sawston in 1984, as a result of a link being established between the two in the PhD thesis of Walther Piroth of Frankfurt University.

<doc id="1197460" wikidata="Q7699692" url="?curid=1197460" title="Tenement (law)">
<text>A tenement (from the Latin &quot;to hold&quot;), in law, is anything that is held, rather than owned. This usage is a holdover from feudalism, which still forms the basis of property law in many common law jurisdictions, in which the monarch alone owned the allodial title to all the land within his kingdom.

Under feudalism, land itself was never privately &quot;owned&quot; but rather was &quot;held&quot; by a tenant (from Latin &quot;teneo&quot; &quot;to hold&quot;) as a fee, being merely a legal right over land known in modern law as an estate in land. This was held from a superior overlord, (a mesne lord), or from the crown itself in which case the holder was termed a tenant-in-chief, upon some manner of service under one of a variety of feudal land tenures. The thing held is called a tenement, the holder is called a tenant, the manner of his holding is called a tenure, and the superior is called the landlord, or lord of the fee. These forms are still preserved in law, even though feudalism itself is extinct, because all real estate law has developed from them over centuries.

Feudal land tenure existed in many varieties. The sole surviving form in the United States is that species of freehold known as &quot;free socage&quot;. Here the service to be performed is known and fixed, and not of a base or servile nature; the &quot;lord of the fee&quot; is the State itself, and the service due to this &quot;lord&quot; is payment of the taxes upon the real estate. The major consequences, in the modern world, of this feudal approach, as distinguished from ownership, are, first, the of the tenement upon failure to perform the service (that is, non-payment of taxes), and second, the doctrine of eminent domain, whereby the &quot;lord of the fee&quot; might take back the estate, provided he make just compensation. Also existing in a vestigial form is the concept of escheat, under which an estate of a holder without heirs returns to the ownership of the state.

A side effect of this is that government entities do not pay real estate taxes to other government entities since government entities own the land rather than hold the land. Localities that depend on real estate taxes to provide services are often put at a disadvantage when the state or federal government acquires a piece of land. Sometimes, to mollify local public opinion, the state or federal government may volunteer to make payments in lieu of taxes to local governments.

<text>Marston Trussell is a village and civil parish in West Northamptonshire in England. Marston Trussell was first recorded as &#x27;Mersitone&#x27;, meaning marsh settlement. The parish includes Thorpe Lubenham. At the time of the 2001 census, its population was 163 people, reducing slightly to 157 at the 2011 census but including Lubenham.

The villages name means &#x27;Marsh farm/settlement&#x27;. The village was held by Richard Trussel in 1233.

The manor house in the village, Marston Trussell Hall, dates from circa 1606 and is an Elizabethan-style mansion with fine wood panelling interiors in the drawing room; in later years the existing house was dwarfed by a Victorian extension which no longer exists. A priesthole was discovered in the mid-1950s. The grounds of the hall have gardens and a newly added sunken Italian garden. Also of note are the 10 Wellingtonia trees. Richard Trussell was lord of the manor in 1233. The Trussells of Marston died out in the 14th century and the hall was eventually re-established as the seat of the Barwell-Ewins Bennett family. There is a hatchment in the parish church of Henry Barwell who died in 1763.

The River Welland was in flood at the time of the Battle of Naseby in 1645 which led to a massacre of retreating Royalists who were trapped between the river and the church; this area is known locally as Slaughterford field.

The late 17th century wrought-iron carriage gates of Marston Trussell Hall were originally made for the house of Erasmus Norwich at Brampton Ash. They were moved to the entrance of the hall in the mid-1700s. Some of the original wrought-iron railings are still used to partition fields at the hall. However, during the First World War, like many country houses, a lot of the wrought-iron was removed and used in the war effort for the manufacture of arms and munitions.

There are around 60 houses, St Nicholas&#x27; Church and a village hall.

The village has a lake, two minutes walk to the west, which primarily stocks roach, perch and pike.

Alongside the lake resides the cricket pitch. The cricket team was started in the mid-1980s, predominantly playing friendlies on a Sunday. The team at one point could field five sets of brothers, Daniel (now at Wokingham Cricket Club) and Oliver Reddyhough, David and John Reddyhough, Simon and Sam Smith (now Gumley Cricket Club), Charles and Robert Mathew and Shaun and Ashley Burbery.

The village holds an annual Beer Festival, over a weekend in mid-June. The Victorian village hall becomes The Rising Sun (the old village pub, The Sun Inn, closed some time ago), complete with pub sign, hand pumps and a variety of real ales, and ciders, including some from the local Welland Valley vineyard.

The village is now (2017) enabled for high speed ultrafast (over 100 Mbit/s) broadband via Zippynet.

<text>PC12 by Artronix was a minicomputer built with 7400-series TTL technology and ferrite core memory. Computers were manufactured at the Artronix facility in suburban St. Louis, Missouri.

The instruction set architecture was adapted from the LINC, the only significant change was to
expand addressable memory to 4K, which required addition of an origin register. It was an accumulator machine with 12-bit addresses to manipulate 12-bit data. Later versions included &quot;origin registers&quot; that were used to extend the addressability of memory. Arithmetic was ones&#x27; complement.

For mass storage it had a LINCtape dual unit. It also used a Tektronix screen with tube memory and an ADC/DAC to capture and display images. There was an optional plotter to draw the results. To speed up the calculations it had a separate floating point unit that interfaced like any other peripheral.

It ran an operating system LAP6-PC with support for assembly language and Fortran programming and usually came with end user software for Radiation Treatment Planning (RTP), for use by a radiation therapist or radiation oncologist, and Hospital Patient Records. Software for implant dosimetry was available for the PC12. With extended hardware it became a multiuser system running MUMPS.
Latter additions included an 8&quot; floppy disk and hard disk of larger capacity.
The PC12 initially controlled the Artronix brain scanner (computed axial tomography), but this was for prototyping.
The PC12 was also the core of an ultrasound system and a gamma camera system.

The PC12 was eventually superseded by the &quot;Modulex&quot; system built by Artronix around the 16-bit Lockheed SUE processor, roughly around 1976. The PC12 continued in production, but was phased out over time.

Sites which used the Artronix PC12 included the Lutheran Hospital Cancer Center in Moline, Illinois, where it was used to store the medical records of patients undergoing treatment for cancer. A 1974 paper describes the use of a PC12 as a frontend to an IBM 360 mainframe in radiation therapy, in which the PC12 acted as the user interface while the mainframe is used to perform complex calculations.

<text>The Susquehanna Valley is a region of low-lying land that borders the Susquehanna River in the U.S. states of New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. The valley consists of areas that lie along the main branch of the river, which flows from Upstate New York through Pennsylvania and Maryland into the Chesapeake Bay, as well as areas that lie along the shorter West Branch in Pennsylvania.

==History and architectural features==
As of 2014, seventeen of the oldest covered bridges in the United States were located in the Susquehanna Valley.

==Geography==
Historians and environmentalists at the Chesapeake Conservancy have described the Susquehanna River as the &quot;lifeblood&quot; of the Chesapeake Bay and also as &quot;extension of the Susquehanna Valley that the Atlantic Ocean has steadily flooded over the last 15,000 years.&quot;

Within Pennsylvania, the Susquehanna Valley is linked inextricably with the Chesapeake Bay watershed, which extends from Virginia, West Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Maryland through Delaware, Pennsylvania and New York. Pennsylvania&#x27;s connections to the watershed are &quot;primarily in the counties along the Susquehanna River, the West Branch of the Susquehanna, and their tributaries,&quot; according to Shelby Splain. &quot;Located in the middle of the commonwealth, about half of the land in Pennsylvania drains into it.&quot;

<text>Carlo Carrà (; February 11, 1881 – April 13, 1966) was an Italian painter and a leading figure of the Futurist movement that flourished in Italy during the beginning of the 20th century. In addition to his many paintings, he wrote a number of books concerning art. He taught for many years in the city of Milan.

==Biography==
Carrà was born in Quargnento, a comune just northwest of Alessandria, Italy (Piedmont). At the age of 12 he left home in order to work as a mural decorator.

In 1899–1900, Carrà was in Paris decorating pavilions at the Exposition Universelle, where he became acquainted with contemporary French art. He then spent a few months in London in contact with exiled Italian anarchists, and returned to Milan in 1901. In 1906, he enrolled at Brera Academy (&quot;Accademia di Brera&quot;) in the city, and studied under Cesare Tallone. In 1910 he signed, along with Umberto Boccioni, Luigi Russolo, and Giacomo Balla the &quot;Manifesto of Futurist Painters&quot;, and began a phase of painting that became his most popular and influential.
Carrà&#x27;s Futurist phase ended around the time World War I began. His work, while still using some Futurist concepts, began to deal more clearly with form and stillness, rather than motion and feeling. In his 1913 manifesto, &quot;The Painting of Sounds, Noises and Smells,&quot; Carrà discussed his interest in synaesthesia, describing it as &quot;being a perceptual phenomenon that relates to the idea that exposure to one external stimulus (say, sound or smell), induces a parallel visualization (say, color).&quot; 

Inspired by Trecento painting, children&#x27;s art, and the work of Henri Rousseau, Carrà soon began creating still lifes in a simplified style that emphasized the reality of ordinary objects. In 1917 he met Giorgio de Chirico in Ferrara, and worked with him there for several weeks. Influenced by de Chirico, Carrà began including mannequin imagery in his paintings. The two artists were the innovators of a style they called &quot;metaphysical painting&quot;. By 1919, Carrà&#x27;s metaphysical phase was giving way to an archaicism inspired by the works of Giotto, whom he admired as &quot;the artist whose forms are closest to our manner of conceiving the construction of bodies in space&quot;. Carrà&#x27;s painting &quot;The Daughters of Lot&quot; (1919) exemplifies the new direction of his work. He was among the contributors of the Rome-based literary magazine &quot;La Ronda&quot; between 1919 and 1922. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, he concentrated mainly on landscape painting and developed a more atmospheric style. An example from this period is his 1928 &quot;Morning by the Sea&quot;.

Carrà is best known for his 1911 Futurist work, &quot;The Funeral of the Anarchist Galli&quot;. He was indeed an anarchist as a young man but, along with many other Futurists, later held more reactionary political views, becoming ultranationalist and irredentist before and during the war. He supported fascism after 1918. In the 1930s, Carrà signed a manifesto in which called for support of the state ideology through art. The &quot;Strapaese&quot; group he joined, founded by Giorgio Morandi, was strongly influenced by fascism and responded to the Neo-classical guidelines which had been set by the regime after 1937, but was opposed to the ideological drive towards strong centralism.
Carrà died in Milan, Italy on April 13, 1966 at age 85.

<doc id="1197479" wikidata="Q721578" url="?curid=1197479" title="Jay McInerney">
<text>John Barrett &quot;Jay&quot; McInerney Jr. (; born January 13, 1955) is an American novelist, screenwriter, editor, and columnist. His novels include &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot;, &quot;Ransom&quot;, &quot;Story of My Life&quot;, &quot;Brightness Falls&quot;, and &quot;The Last of the Savages&quot;. He edited &quot;The Penguin Book of New American Voices&quot;, wrote the screenplay for the 1988 film adaptation of &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot;, and co-wrote the screenplay for the television film &quot;Gia&quot;, which starred Angelina Jolie. He was the wine columnist for &quot;House &amp; Garden&quot; magazine, and his essays on wine have been collected in &quot;Bacchus &amp; Me&quot; (2000) and &quot;A Hedonist in the Cellar&quot; (2006). His most recent novel is titled &quot;Bright, Precious Days&quot;, published in 2016. From April 2010 he was a wine columnist for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. In 2009, he published a book of short stories which spanned his entire career, titled &quot;How It Ended&quot;, which was named one of the 10 best books of the year by Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

==Early life and education==
McInerney was born in 1955 in Hartford, Connecticut, the son of Marilyn Jean (Murphy) and John Barrett McInerney Sr., a corporate executive. He graduated from Williams College in 1976. At Syracuse University, he earned a Master of Arts in English and studied writing with Raymond Carver.

==Career==
After working as a fact-checker at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, McInerney achieved fame with his first published novel, &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot;. Published in 1984, the novel was unique at the time for its depiction of cocaine culture in second-person narrative. The title is taken from a 1961 blues song by Jimmy Reed. The novel established McInerney&#x27;s reputation as part of a new generation of writers. Labelled the &#x27;literary brat pack&#x27; in a 1987 article in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, McInerney, Bret Easton Ellis and Tama Janowitz were presented as the new face of literature: young, iconoclastic and fresh. Five novels followed: &quot;Ransom&quot;, &quot;Story of My Life&quot;, &quot;Brightness Falls&quot;, &quot;The Last of the Savages&quot; and &quot;Model Behavior&quot;.

After the success of &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot;, publishers started looking for similar works about young people in urban settings. Ellis&#x27;s &quot;Less than Zero&quot;, published in 1985, was promoted as following McInerney&#x27;s example. McInerney, Ellis and Janowitz were based in New York City and their lives there were the subject of heavy media coverage.

Ellis used McInerney&#x27;s character, Alison Poole (&quot;Story of My Life&quot;), in his novels &quot;American Psycho&quot; and &quot;Glamorama&quot;. McInerney revealed that the character of Alison Poole is based upon his former girlfriend, Rielle Hunter, then known as Lisa Druck. He described the character as &quot;cocaine addled,&quot; and &quot;sexually voracious&quot; but also treated her with some sympathy. McInerney&#x27;s roman à clef opened a prescient glimpse into the notorious horse murders scandal, which did not become known to the public until 1992, when &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine published a confession from the man who had murdered Lisa Druck&#x27;s horse at her father&#x27;s behest, in order to claim the insurance on its life.

McInerney also has a cameo role in Ellis&#x27;s &quot;Lunar Park&quot;, attending the Halloween party Bret hosts at his house. It was later revealed that McInerney was not pleased with his representation in the novel.

Throughout his career, McInerney has struggled against the image of himself as both the author and protagonist of &quot;Bright Lights, Big City.&quot; In 2009, he said in an interview, &quot;Obviously, I&#x27;m no longer a 25-year-old &quot;bon vivant&quot;, but [that] gave me what I always wanted: the opportunity to be a full-time writer. It hasn&#x27;t been entirely fair to my other books, and I&#x27;ve had to deal with a lot of idiocy on the part of the critics and the cultural commentators.&quot; He appeared at Williams College as the commencement speaker for the Class of 2010.

==Personal life==
His first wife was fashion model Linda Rossiter. His second wife was writer Merry Reymond. For four years he lived with fashion model Marla Hanson.
His third marriage, to Helen Bransford, lasted nine years, and the couple had fraternal twin children, John Barrett McInerney III and Maisie Bransford McInerney. In 2006, he married Anne Hearst.

<doc id="1197501" wikidata="Q1134118" url="?curid=1197501" title="Gag order">
<text>A gag order (also known as a gagging order or suppression order) is an order, typically a legal order by a court or government, restricting information or comment from being made public or passed on to any unauthorized third party. The phrase may sometimes be used of a private order by an employer or other institution.

Uses of gag orders include keeping trade secrets of a company, protecting the integrity of ongoing police or military operations, and protecting the privacy of victims or minors. Conversely, as their downside, they may be abused as a useful tool for those of financial means to intimidate witnesses and prevent release of information, using the legal system rather than other methods of intimidation. Strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) orders may potentially be abused in this way.

Gag orders are sometimes used in an attempt to assure a fair trial by preventing prejudicial pre-trial publicity, although their use for this purpose is controversial since they are a potentially unconstitutional prior restraint that can lead to the press&#x27;s using less reliable sources such as off-the-record statements and second- or third-hand accounts.

In a similar manner, a &quot;gag law&quot; may limit freedom of the press, by instituting censorship or restricting access to information.

==Examples==

===Australia===
In the summer of 2014, WikiLeaks revealed the existence of an Australia-wide gagging order, issued 19 June by the Supreme Court of Victoria, to block reporting of bribery allegations involving several international political leaders in the region.

In December 2018, International news sources have reported that Cardinal George Pell&#x27;s conviction on child-molestation charges is subject to a gag order issued by Victoria, Australia court Judge Peter Kidd, suppressing coverage of the conviction by Australian media companies. In early February 2019, Victoria&#x27;s DPP, Kerri Judd QC, wrote to around 50 Australian news publishers, editors, broadcasters, reporters and subeditors, accusing them of breaking the gag order. Kidd told a closed court that some of the breaches were serious and editors faced jail.

=== Brazil ===
In 2019, the Brazilian Ministry of Environment imposed a gag order on environmental enforcement agency Ibama, ordering it not to respond to press inquiries and to instead redirect them to the ministry’s communications office. Ibama&#x27;s head of communications was forced to resign after weeks of defying the ministry&#x27;s directive to reroute press queries.

===India===
After the 2008 Mumbai attacks in which live streaming of the event was broadcast, the Indian government proposed a draft law that would gag media outlets broadcasting live pictures during a terrorist event or war, to ensure the safety of any hostages and to protect security operations from hindrance. This has been opposed by Indian media who argue that they have adopted &#x27;self-regulation&#x27; during such events and refrain from doing so anyway. It is uncertain if the draft law will be passed.

===Israel===
In late 2009, Israel issued a gag order against the Israeli media reporting on facts surrounding the Anat Kamm–Uri Blau affair. The gag order was ultimately subject to widespread criticism and publicity as the details of the case were reported overseas. The scandal centered around leaked documents from the Israeli Defense Force which suggested the military had engaged in extrajudicial killings.

A gag order concerning the Prisoner X affair prevented Israeli coverage of the topic for more than two years. After numerous foreign media outlets revealed the prisoner&#x27;s identity and other key facts in February 2013, a court partially lifted the gag order, allowing Israeli media to quote foreign press reports but offer no original reporting.

On 13 November 2013 a gag order concerning a famous Israeli singer suspected of sex with girls below the age of consent was issued. While the traditional media did not advertise the name of the singer, social media platforms users like Facebook published the singer name and incriminating photos. On 20 November Eyal Golan released a press statement announcing he was the suspected singer.

In 2014, a blanket gag order regarding the detainment of Avera Mengitsu was put into place. It lasted 10 months, until July 9, 2015. Discussions took place in social media forums and some reports were published on foreign websites. Some clues about the affair were leaked to different Arabic media outlets, from which the story made its way to international media and was published to Tikun Olam by blogger Richard Silverstein. The gag order was lifted following a request from &quot;Haaretz&quot;. The Associated Press speculated that a statement made by Khaled Mashal the previous day, in which he spoke of an Israeli request through a European intermediary for the release of &quot;two soldiers and two bodies&quot;, may have &quot;forced Israel&#x27;s hand&quot;.

In August 2017, Israeli court issued a month-old gag order on a state witness deal regarding the ongoing criminal investigations of the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.

===Malaysia===
There was speculation that a gag order may be imposed by the MCA on their press statements before they are released to the public to &quot;ensure maximum effectiveness&quot;. Such releases would have to be approved by the president. These claims in the media were later denied.

=== Myanmar ===
In October 2021, the top attorney for Myanmar&#x27;s deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi claimed that Burmese authorities had issued him a gag order barring him from discussing Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s court proceedings in public because they believed such communications could spark unrest.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, name suppression is the commonly used term for a court order preventing the publication of a name or details of a criminal case. The rules for name suppression are laid out in the Criminal Procedure Act 2011. Name suppression can be granted automatically for several reasons, including to protect the identities of victims of sex crimes or to protect the identity of children under the age of 17. Name suppression can also be granted at the discretion of the court. Defendants frequently receive name suppression in New Zealand. Often this is due to the court determining that media coverage could cause undue hardship to a defendant, or could prejudice the defendant&#x27;s right to a fair trial. Name suppression orders can be (and frequently are) opposed, often by media outlets. Victims of crime can waive their automatic name suppression rights, in order to lift name suppression on the defendant, though this is uncommon.

Breaching a name suppression order brings a penalty of up to 6 months in prison for individuals, or fines of up to for organisations.

Some high profile cases have seen breaches of name suppression orders in New Zealand. In 2010, right-wing blogger and vocal critic of name suppression rules Cameron Slater was convicted of breaching name suppression orders and fined . Later, Slater himself benefited from name suppression when charged with attempting to hack a competing political website.

The defendant in the murder of Grace Millane was granted name suppression during trial, but media outlets covering the case in the United Kingdom published his name, as they were not subject to New Zealand law. This resulted in his name being commonly available online in New Zealand, including being emailed to Google News subscribers within New Zealand. Auckland businessman Leo Molloy was convicted of breaching name suppression in the case when he posted the defendant&#x27;s name on a web forum. He was fined and sentenced to 350 hours of community service.

In August 2023 Te Pāti Māori coleader Rawiri Waititi made a direct reference to a suppressed case in parliament. Despite details of the case being suppressed from publication by the courts, Waititi&#x27;s speech was protected by parliamentary privilege. He was later suspended from parliament for breaching standing orders.

Name suppression laws in New Zealand have been controversial since they were first introduced in the early 20th century, and specific suppression orders are also sometimes highly controversial. Critics point to the legislation being used to protect the identities of well-known figures when they are accused of crime, and that suppressing details from publication conflicts with the principle of open justice. The internet has introduced new challenges with the enforcement of name suppression orders. The New Zealand Bar Association has defended name suppression laws as an important tool for balancing the principles of open justice against fair trial rights.

=== Nigeria ===
In July 2021, the National Broadcasting Commission issued a gag order barring all journalists and broadcast stations in the country from reporting details of terrorists, kidnappers, and victims. After unsuccessfully calling for the gag order&#x27;s withdrawal, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) and the Centre for Journalism Innovation and Development (PTCIJ) filed a lawsuit against President Muhammadu Buhari and Minister of Information and Culture Lai Mohammed, with National Broadcasting Commission also named as a defendant. The plaintiffs asked the court to “declare illegal the gag order&quot; and to compel the defendants to withdraw the directive, arguing that it was &quot;inconsistent and incompatible with sections 22 and 39 of the Nigerian Constitution, Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights and Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&quot;.

=== United Kingdom ===

A gag order, or anonymity order, is sometimes issued by courts in the United Kingdom to protect privacy, prevent harm to suspects, prisoners, witnesses, victims, or to protect national security. In the Allan Chappelow murder case, the trial was held mostly &quot;in camera&quot; and media were prevented from speculating on the case. The order was imposed after a &quot;compelling case&quot; made by prosecutors, despite overwhelming media opposition brought by a legal challenge to the ruling. This criminal case has been thought to be the first in which a gagging order was imposed.

In 2011, gagging orders that applied to themselves, or &quot;super-injunctions&quot; as they were called, were being referred to almost daily in the United Kingdom after a number of high-profile public figures, including celebrities and politicians, censored the British media from revealing information about their personal lives, such as affairs and dealings with prostitutes.

Gag orders protecting the privacy of convicted child murderers such as Mary Bell, Jon Venables and David McGreavy, in order to protect them from revenge attacks, have also been controversial because of public concerns about the inability to avoid such persons and protect victims&#x27; families and other children from being harmed by them.

=== The Netherlands ===
In The Netherlands, ethologist Gerrit van Putten was given two separate gag orders by the Minister of Agriculture to protect intensive farming. The first gag order was issued after Van Putten had published a report on tail biting in pigs in 1972, and had advocated that the pig&#x27;s tail is a thermometer of animal welfare, which was discarded when the &quot;temperature&quot; became too high, i.e. the tails were docked rather than that housing conditions were improved. The second gag order was issued in 1989 by Minister Braks, who did not want to hear about the adverse effects of confined housing of pigs.

In 2015, a Dutch court issued a gag order on writer Edwin Giltay, banning his non-fiction thriller &quot;The Cover-up General&quot;
and prohibiting him to promote it. The suppression order denied Edwin Giltay to disclose the contents of the book, which 
delineates an espionage scandal within Dutch military intelligence that he 
witnessed first-hand, about obscuring evidence of war crimes in 
Srebrenica.
In 2016, the Court of Appeal in The Hague revoked the gag order and the book ban.

===United States===
A national security letter (), an administrative subpoena used by the FBI, has an attached gag order which restricts the recipient from ever saying anything about being served with one. The government has issued hundreds of thousands of such NSLs accompanied with gag orders. The gag orders have been upheld in court.

Suspicious activity reports (; the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 / Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act, , § 1517(b), ) require that &quot;If a financial institution or any director, officer, employee, or agent of any financial institution [...] reports a suspicious transaction to a government agency—neither the financial institution, director, officer, employee, or agent of such institution (whether or not any such person is still employed by the institution) [...] may notify any person involved in the transaction that the transaction has been reported; and no current or former officer or employee of or contractor for the Federal Government or of or for any State, local, tribal, or territorial government within the United States, who has any knowledge that such report was made may disclose to any person involved in the transaction that the transaction has been reported&quot;.

 (the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 / Stored Communications Act) also provides for gag orders which direct the recipient of a order to refrain from disclosing the existence of the order or the investigation.

 (the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986) also provides for gag orders which direct the recipient of a pen register or trap and trace device order not to disclose the existence of the pen/trap or the investigation.

In the United States, a court can order parties to a case not to comment on it but has no authority to stop unrelated reporters from reporting on a case. Thus, information concerning a case is often leaked to the media, and the media often chooses to publicly report this leaked information after receiving it. Most statutes which restrict what may be reported have generally been found unconstitutional and void. However, the gag provisions of the WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act have been upheld.

The trials of Guantanamo Bay suspects have also been subjected to a gag order, which has hindered public scrutiny. Likewise, as part of a plea bargain, John Walker Lindh consented to a gag order to not talk to the press or others. Also, Judge Howard Shore from San Diego put a gag order on activist Jeff Olson.

Gag orders can be part of a settlement agreement between two parties. In the state of Pennsylvania in 2011, a lifetime gag order on the discussion of fracking was agreed to by a family as part of their agreement with the oil and gas drilling company Range Resources. An attorney for Range Resources claimed in court that the gag order covered not only the adults in the family, but also the children, then aged seven and ten years old, and that the company intended to enforce it.

Some U.S. states, the first of which was Florida, have enacted so-called &quot;physician gag laws&quot; limiting doctors&#x27; ability to ask about a patient&#x27;s gun ownership.

====California====
In 2017, California enacted the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act, adjusting California Penal Code 1546, including Section 1546.2 (b) (1), a provision which allows that in certain cases, a court can issue &quot;an order delaying notification and prohibiting any party providing information from notifying any other party&quot; that an electronic search warrant has been requested by a government entity.

====Puerto Rico====

On 21 May 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and Nationalist movements on the archipelago, which was a colony of the United States at the time. The Senate, controlled by the &quot;Partido Popular Democrático&quot; (PPD), approved the bill that day. This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the &quot;Ley de la Mordaza&quot; (Gag Law, technically &quot;Law 53 of 1948&quot;) when the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jesús T. Piñero, signed it into law on 10 June 1948.

Under this new law it became a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both. According to Leopoldo Figueroa, the lone non-PPD member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, Law 53 was repressive and was in violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution which guarantees Freedom of Speech. He pointed out that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico.

=== Venezuela ===
The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Press Association (IAPA), as well as the Venezuelan opposition, have considered the Law on Social Responsibility on Radio and Television as a gag law that violates freedom of the press and the exercise of journalism in Venezuela.

<text>Bruce Noel Stevenson Fordyce (born 3 December 1955 in Hong Kong) is a South African marathon and ultramarathon athlete who was also active in opposing Apartheid. He is best known for having won the South African Comrades Marathon a record nine times, of which eight wins were consecutive. He also won the London to Brighton Ultramarathon three years in a row. He is the former world record holder over 50 miles and the former world record holder over 100 km.

==Early life and education==
Born in Hong Kong to Evan Noel and Nancy Ann (Née Stevenson), Fordyce moved with his family to Johannesburg when he was 13 years old. He completed his school career at Woodmead High School and subsequently attended the University of the Witwatersrand, where he obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1977 and his Honours Bachelor of Arts degree in 1979. During this time he was also a member of the university&#x27;s anti-apartheid Student Representative Council as well as a committee member of the Wits Athletic Club. He married Gillian Leigh (Née Bruce)

==Comrades Marathon==
In 1977, when Fordyce first ran the Comrades Marathon, he placed 43rd out of 1,678 entries. He placed 14th in 1978, 3rd in 1979, 2nd in 1980, and was the winner for an unprecedented eight consecutive years from 1981 to 1988; he won it again in 1990. No other runner in the history of the Comrades has achieved this feat. Fordyce also held the record time for the &quot;up&quot; run (Durban to Pietermaritzburg) and his record of 5:24:07 for the &quot;down&quot; run (Pietermaritzburg to Durban) stood for 21 years from 1986 until it was broken in 2007 by Russia&#x27;s Leonid Shvetsov.

He has thus completed 30 Comrades Marathons, including the remarkable result of posting identical times in 1985 and 1987.
In 2011 he aimed for a silver medal, but missed this by 31 seconds (finishing time of 7 hours 30 minutes 31 seconds).

==London to Brighton Ultramarathon==
Fordyce won the London to Brighton ultramarathon 3 years running from 1981 to 1983.

==World record holder==
Fordyce was the world record holder over 50 miles, when he covered the distance in 4hr 50min 21sec at the 1984 AMJA 50 Mile Ultramarathon in Chicago, IL, until the record was broken by Jim Walmsley on 5 May 2019. Fordyce holds the 50-mile record for the United States All Comers Race.

== Political activism ==
Fordyce was strongly anti-apartheid. On his first victory race in 1981 he wore a black armband to protest against the 20th anniversary celebrations of the apartheid republic attracting boos and even some rotten tomatoes thrown by a fellow runner. Fordyce has claimed this protest as &quot;one of the proudest moments in my life&quot;.

==Books, journalism and motivational speaker==
In addition to having written two books about the Comrades Marathon, Fordyce was also a sports columnist for various newspapers and magazines, and a SABC television commentator for the 2014 event. He is also a motivational speaker and the chief executive officer of the South African Sports Trust.

==Parkrun==
Fordyce also introduced the parkrun running events to South Africa in November 2011. This is a collection of free-entry weekly 5k run events. There are now 210 parkrun events in South Africa as of 16 October 2023. Fordyce ran his 500th parkrun at Delta Park, Johannesburg, the first South African parkrun venue, on 14 October 2023.

==Other honours==
In 2004, he was voted 64th in the Top 100 Great South Africans.

In 2007, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of the Witwatersrand.

<doc id="1197531" wikidata="Q2072471" url="?curid=1197531" title="Hamiltonian system">
<text>A Hamiltonian system is a dynamical system governed by Hamilton&#x27;s equations. In physics, this dynamical system describes the evolution of a physical system such as a planetary system or an electron in an electromagnetic field. These systems can be studied in both Hamiltonian mechanics and dynamical systems theory.

== Overview ==

Informally, a Hamiltonian system is a mathematical formalism developed by Hamilton to describe the evolution equations of a physical system. The advantage of this description is that it gives important insights into the dynamics, even if the initial value problem cannot be solved analytically. One example is the planetary movement of three bodies: while there is no closed-form solution to the general problem, Poincaré showed for the first time that it exhibits deterministic chaos.

Formally, a Hamiltonian system is a dynamical system characterised by the scalar function formula_1, also known as the Hamiltonian. The state of the system, formula_2, is described by the generalized coordinates formula_3 and formula_4, corresponding to generalized momentum and position respectively. Both formula_3 and formula_4 are real-valued vectors with the same dimension &quot;N&quot;. Thus, the state is completely described by the 2&quot;N&quot;-dimensional vector

:formula_7

and the evolution equations are given by Hamilton&#x27;s equations:

:formula_8

The trajectory formula_9 is the solution of the initial value problem defined by Hamilton&#x27;s equations and the initial condition formula_10.

==Time-independent Hamiltonian systems==

If the Hamiltonian is not explicitly time-dependent, i.e. if formula_11, then the Hamiltonian does not vary with time at all:

and thus the Hamiltonian is a constant of motion, whose constant equals the total energy of the system: formula_12. Examples of such systems are the undamped pendulum, the harmonic oscillator, and dynamical billiards.

===Example===
An example of a time-independent Hamiltonian system is the harmonic oscillator. Consider the system defined by the coordinates formula_13 and formula_14. Then the Hamiltonian is given by

: formula_15

The Hamiltonian of this system does not depend on time and thus the energy of the system is conserved.

== Symplectic structure ==
One important property of a Hamiltonian dynamical system is that it has a symplectic structure. Writing

: formula_16

the evolution equation of the dynamical system can be written as

:formula_17

where

:formula_18
and &quot;I&quot;&quot;N&quot; is the &quot;N&quot;×&quot;N&quot; identity matrix.

One important consequence of this property is that an infinitesimal phase-space volume is preserved. A corollary of this is Liouville&#x27;s theorem, which states that on a Hamiltonian system, the phase-space volume of a closed surface is preserved under time evolution.

:formula_19

where the third equality comes from the divergence theorem.

== Hamiltonian chaos ==
Certain Hamiltonian systems exhibit chaotic behavior. When the evolution of a Hamiltonian system is highly sensitive to initial conditions, and the motion appears random and erratic, the system is said to exhibit Hamiltonian chaos.

=== Origins ===
The concept of chaos in Hamiltonian systems has its roots in the works of Henri Poincaré, who in the late 19th century made pioneering contributions to the understanding of the three-body problem in celestial mechanics. Poincaré showed that even a simple gravitational system of three bodies could exhibit complex behavior that could not be predicted over the long term. His work is considered to be one of the earliest explorations of chaotic behavior in physical systems.

=== Characteristics ===
Hamiltonian chaos is characterized by the following features:

Sensitivity to Initial Conditions: A hallmark of chaotic systems, small differences in initial conditions can lead to vastly different trajectories. This is known as the butterfly effect.

Mixing: Over time, the phases of the system become uniformly distributed in phase space.

Recurrence: Though unpredictable, the system eventually revisits states that are arbitrarily close to its initial state, known as Poincaré recurrence.

Hamiltonian chaos is also associated with the presence of &quot;chaotic invariants&quot; such as the Lyapunov exponent and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, which quantify the rate at which nearby trajectories diverge and the complexity of the system, respectively.

=== Applications ===
Hamiltonian chaos is prevalent in many areas of physics, particularly in classical mechanics and statistical mechanics. For instance, in plasma physics, the behavior of charged particles in a magnetic field can exhibit Hamiltonian chaos, which has implications for nuclear fusion and astrophysical plasmas. Moreover, in quantum mechanics, Hamiltonian chaos is studied through quantum chaos, which seeks to understand the quantum analogs of classical chaotic behavior. Hamiltonian chaos also plays a role in astrophysics, where it is used to study the dynamics of star clusters and the stability of galactic structures.

<text>Murder, My Sweet (released as Farewell, My Lovely in the United Kingdom) is a 1944 American film noir, directed by Edward Dmytryk and starring Dick Powell, Claire Trevor and Anne Shirley (in her final film before retirement). The film is based on Raymond Chandler&#x27;s 1940 novel &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot;. It was the first film to feature Chandler&#x27;s primary character, the hard-boiled private detective Philip Marlowe.

&quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot; is, along with &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (released five months prior), one of the first films noir, and a key influence in the development of the genre.

==Plot==
With his eyes bandaged, private detective Philip Marlowe is interrogated by police lieutenant Randall about two murders.

Marlowe tells how he was hired by ex-con Moose Malloy to locate Malloy&#x27;s former girlfriend Velma Valento. They go to Florian&#x27;s, the nightclub where Velma last worked as a singer, but no one remembers her. Marlowe tracks down Jessie Florian, the alcoholic widow of the nightclub&#x27;s former owner, who hides a photo of Velma and says Velma is dead. Marlowe steals the photo and sees Jessie making a phone call as he leaves.

The next morning, Lindsay Marriott hires Marlowe to be his bodyguard while he acts as a go-between to pay a ransom for some stolen jewels. During the job, Marlowe is knocked unconscious from behind. When he comes to, a young woman shines a flashlight on his face, then runs away. The money is gone, and Marriott has been brutally clubbed to death with a blackjack. When Marlowe reports the murder, the police ask him if he knows a Jules Amthor, and warn him not to interfere in the case.

Ann Grayle tries to pry information out of Marlowe about the murder. She mentions that the jewels were jade, and introduces him to her weak, elderly, and wealthy father, Leuwen Grayle, and his seductive second wife, Helen. Grayle collects rare jade and was attempting to recover a stolen necklace. Jules Amthor, a psychic healer who treated both Helen and Marriott, shows up just as Marlowe is leaving. Helen retains Marlowe to try to recover the jade, but Ann tries bribing him to drop the case.

In an attempt to locate the jade, Amthor has duped Moose into thinking that Marlowe knows where Velma is. Moose attacks and subdues Marlowe, then Amthor has Marlowe taken to Dr. Sonderberg&#x27;s sanatorium, where he is drugged and held for three days. Marlowe escapes and convinces Moose that Amthor tricked him, then goes to Ann.

When Marlowe learns that the police had asked Ann&#x27;s father about the family beach house, which Marriott rented, Marlowe and Ann go there, where they find Helen hiding from the police. Ann leaves to tell her father where his missing wife is. Marlowe deduces that Helen hired him only to set him up for Amthor&#x27;s interrogations and that Ann was trying to save him from the set-up. Helen attempts to entice Marlowe into helping her murder Amthor. Marlowe seems to go along with her plan, but finds Amthor dead already. Moose is waiting for Marlowe at his office. Marlowe shows Moose the photo of &quot;Velma&quot; he took from Jessie, and as he suspected, it is a fake intended to throw anyone looking for Velma off the track. In fact, Helen is Velma. Marlowe tells Moose to lie low until the next night, when he will take Moose to her.

At the beach house, Marlowe has Moose wait outside while he meets with Helen to find out what happened to the necklace, but she pulls a gun on him. Jessie Florian had tipped her that Marlowe was looking for Velma, so she was faking the robbery and the ransom exchange to kill him. Helen killed Marriott while Marlowe went down into the canyon, and was about to kill Marlowe when Ann came along, worried that her jealous father might be trying to kill Marriott.

As Helen is about to shoot Marlowe, a lovesick Grayle shows up with Ann. He takes Marlowe&#x27;s gun and kills Helen/Velma. Moose hears the shot and comes in, finding Velma dead. Grayle admits to shooting her, and Moose lunges for Grayle, who shoots him. Marlowe attempts to intercede as the gun goes off and his eyes are burned by the flash. Two more shots are fired.

His story concluded, the temporarily blinded private eye is told that Moose and Grayle shot each other in a struggle for Marlowe&#x27;s gun. Marlowe is escorted out of the building by Detective Nulty, with Ann following them and overhearing every word. Marlowe expresses his attraction for Ann to the detective. In the back seat of a taxi cab, the bandaged Marlowe recognizes her perfume, and they kiss.

==Production==
The rights to Chandler&#x27;s &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; were bought by RKO Radio Pictures for $2,000, and the novel provided the essentials of the plot for &quot;The Falcon Takes Over&quot;, released in 1942. Another of Chandler&#x27;s novels had been purchased as well, but in 1944 no studio had yet used Chandler&#x27;s antihero private detective Philip Marlowe as the protagonist of a film. RKO&#x27;s studio boss, Charles Koerner, recognized the value of the character and of Chandler&#x27;s style, and decided to use the rights RKO already owned to make a true adaptation of the novel. He was able to convince RKO&#x27;s management to make a new version of the book so soon after the previous one by pointing out that the book did not need a great deal of adapting to create a screenplay.

For &quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot; Koerner assembled a creative staff who were ready to make the move up from B-movies, specifically producer Adrian Scott and director Edward Dmytryk; for Scott, the film was his first as producer. Koerner also revitalized the career of Claire Trevor – who was making Westerns in which she had fourth or fifth billing – and intended the film to be a showcase for the actress, who played a &quot;femme fatale&quot;. At one point, the studio had considered Ann Dvorak for one of the female leads.

Both Shirley and Trevor tried to convince the studio that they should both play &quot;against type&quot;, with perennial good girl Shirley cast as the &quot;femme fatale&quot; Helen, and Trevor cast as the nice girl, Ann, but their pressure did not convince the studio.

Koerner was also responsible for Dick Powell&#x27;s transformation from a crooner to playing hard-boiled characters. Powell had been known in the 1930s and early 1940s for light comedies and musicals, but for ten years he had been trying to break away from that typecasting, which he felt he was too old for; he had wanted to play Fred MacMurray&#x27;s part in &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;. Koerner wanted Powell under contract to RKO to do musicals, but Powell would only sign if he was allowed to do other kinds of roles, so he offered Powell the opportunity he wanted. However, producer Scott and director Dmytryk were strongly opposed to casting Powell (as was Chandler) – Dmytryk later wrote &quot;The idea of the man who had sung &#x27;Tiptoe Through the Tulips&#x27; playing a tough private eye was beyond our imaginations.&quot; – Powell had to make a screen test, as a result of which Koerner offered the actor a multi-picture contract with the studio. After the success of the film, and considering the quality of Powell&#x27;s performance, Koerner dropped the idea of casting Powell in musicals, and cast him instead as other tough guy characters and in action films.

Powell&#x27;s performance as Philip Marlowe is much debated by fans of Chandler and film noir; some think it too light and comic; while others consider it the best interpretation of Marlowe on film. Chandler himself – who at first had objected to casting Powell – said he was very fond of it, but after seeing Marlowe played by Humphrey Bogart in &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, changed his allegiance to Bogart.

Another actor who had to audition to get the role he played was former pro-wrestler-turned-actor Mike Mazurki. Dmytryk wanted a true actor to play the part, but was convinced by Mazurki in a studio commissary discussion to give him a chance; Powell assisted him in his efforts.

The film&#x27;s screenwriter, John Paxton – a former reporter and publicist whose only previous full-length feature was &quot;My Pal Wolf&quot;, a girl-and-her-dog film – closely followed Chandler&#x27;s novel, as well as Chandler&#x27;s advice: &quot;When your plot hits a snag, have somebody come through the door with a gun.&quot; Some aspects of Chandler&#x27;s plot had to be underplayed because of the Production Code, such as Marriott&#x27;s homosexuality, or the fact that Amthor and Sonderborg were providing drugs to the elites of Los Angeles. Other parts of the novel, such as a plot thread involving a fleet of gambling boats off the L.A. coast, were dropped completely, but not because of the Code: in real life mobster Anthony Cornero ran such a fleet outside the three-mile limit, and hosted many of Hollywood&#x27;s movers and shakers, and there was concern about drawing unwanted attention to him. Finally, Florian&#x27;s, the club Moose first brings Marlowe to in his search for Velma, was originally a club with an exclusively African-American clientele located on Central Avenue in the heart of L.A.&#x27;s black district. Making the change meant that the scenes in the club, and with Jessie Florian, would not have to be cut when the film was distributed in Southern states.

Another change made in the adaptation from the book to the film was in the character of Ann Grayle. She was originally the daughter of an honest cop, but changing her to the step-daughter of Trevor&#x27;s seductress helped to show the differences between the two types of women.

It was producer Scott&#x27;s idea to shoot the film as an extended flashback, which kept the book&#x27;s first-person narrative style.

Production on &quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot; took place from May 8 to July 1, 1944. Shooting on the first day was so hectic that Claire Trevor was being sewn into her dress while the first scene was being set up. A makeup person was left off of the call, so Trevor did her makeup herself. During breaks between scenes, Dick Powell would entertain the other actors with imitations of himself as a singer earlier in his film career.

Night location shooting took place in the Hollywood Hills.

==Release and title change==
The film was first screened on December 18, 1944 in Minneapolis, Minnesota with the title &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot;, and also played in previews in New England with that title. A survey by Audience Research Inc. indicated that viewers thought that the title suggested a Dick Powell musical, so the film&#x27;s name was changed, delaying its release. It opened in New York City on March 8, 1945 as &quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot;.

==Response==
===Critical reception===

&quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot; is considered one of the better adaptations of Chandler&#x27;s work. Glenn Erickson wrote, &quot;&quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot; remains the purest version of Chandler on film, even if it all seems far too familiar now.&quot;

Alison Dalzell, writing for the Edinburgh University Film Society, notes:Of all the adaptations of Chandler novels, this film comes as close as any to matching their stylish first person narrative and has the cinematic skill and bravado of direction to carry it off. Since the &#x27;40s countless mystery and neo-noir films have been made in Hollywood and around the world. &quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot; is what they all aspire to be.

According to film critics Ellen Keneshea and Carl Macek, the picture takes Chandler&#x27;s novel and transforms it into a &quot;film with a dark ambiance unknown at [the] time&quot;. Dmytryk was able to transcend the tough dialogue and mystery film conventions by creating a &quot;cynical vision of society&quot;. As such, the film enters the world of film noir.

When the film was released, Bosley Crowther, the film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, appreciated the adaptation of Chandler&#x27;s novel and lauded the acting and writing: Practically all of the supporting roles are exceptionally well played, particularly by Mike Mazurki, the former wrestler, as the brutish Moose Malloy; Otto Kruger as Jules Amthor, quack-psychologist and insidious blackmailer; Anne Shirley as an innocent among the wolf pack, and Don Douglas as the police lieutenant. In short, &quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot; is pulse-quickening entertainment.

The staff at &quot;Variety&quot; magazine also gave the film kudos, writing: &quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot;, a taut thriller about a private detective enmeshed with a gang of blackmailers, is as smart as it is gripping ... Performances are on a par with the production. Dick Powell is a surprise as the hard-boiled copper. The portrayal is potent and convincing. Claire Trevor is as dramatic as the predatory femme, with Anne Shirley in sharp contrast as the soft kid caught in the crossfire.

===Box office===
The film made a profit of $597,000.

==Awards and honors==
&quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot; won four 1946 Edgar Awards from the Mystery Writers of America:
* Best Motion Picture
* John Paxton (screenplay)
* Raymond Chandler (author)
* Dick Powell (actor)

==Other versions==
*The Chandler novel had been filmed once before, in 1942, as &quot;The Falcon Takes Over&quot;, directed by Irving Reis, part of a film series which featured George Sanders as The Falcon. 
*In 1975, the story was remade under its original title as &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; starring Robert Mitchum as Marlowe and directed by Dick Richards.
*The film version of &quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot; was dramatized as an hour-long radio play on June 11, 1945, broadcast of Lux Radio Theater, with Powell and Trevor in their original film roles.
*Another radio adaptation, with Powell and Mike Mazurki reprising their roles, was presented on &quot;Hollywood Star Time&quot; in 1948, with Mary Astor playing Helen.
*The success of &quot;Murder, My Sweet&quot; inspired the creation of two radio series: 1947&#x27;s short-lived &quot;Philip Marlow&quot; with Van Heflin in the lead role, and &quot;The Adventures of Philip Marlowe&quot; which played from 1948 to 1951, with Gerald Mohr as Marlowe. The latter was the most popular show on radio in 1949.

<text>Rescue Me is a British romantic comedy television series produced by Tiger Aspect Productions and broadcast on BBC One in 2002. It was created, and principally written, by David Nicholls and stars Sally Phillips as Katie Nash, a woman who is recovering from a divorce while at the same time writing relationship features for &quot;Eden&quot;, the women&#x27;s magazine she works on. The series was filmed from November to December 2001. It ran for six episodes, averaging 3.4 million viewers and a 15% audience share in its Sunday night timeslot. The low ratings meant it was not recommissioned for a second series, leaving an unresolved cliffhanger. Nicholls had written four episodes of the unmade second series before discovering &quot;Rescue Me&quot; had been cancelled. As a result, he took a break from screenwriting to concentrate on his debut novel &quot;Starter for Ten&quot;. A cover version of &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, performed by Oliver Darley, is the series theme tune.

==Cast==
*Sally Phillips as Katie Nash, a feature writer on a magazine.

<text>An air purifier or air cleaner is a device which removes contaminants from the air in a room to improve indoor air quality. These devices are commonly marketed as being beneficial to allergy sufferers and asthmatics, and at reducing or eliminating second-hand tobacco smoke.

The commercially graded air purifiers are manufactured as either small stand-alone units or larger units that can be affixed to an air handler unit (AHU) or to an HVAC unit found in the medical, industrial, and commercial industries. Air purifiers may also be used in industry to remove impurities from air before processing. Pressure swing adsorbers or other adsorption techniques are typically used for this.

==History==
In 1830, a patent was awarded to Charles Anthony Deane for a device comprising a copper helmet with an attached flexible collar and garment. A long leather hose attached to the rear of the helmet was to be used to supply air, the original concept being that it would be pumped using a double bellows. A short pipe allowed breathed air to escape. The garment was to be constructed from leather or airtight cloth, secured by straps.
In the 1860s, John Stenhouse filed two patents applying the absorbent properties of wood charcoal to air purification (patents 19 July 1860 and 21 May 1867), thereby creating the first practical respirator.

In 1871, the physicist John Tyndall wrote about his invention, a fireman&#x27;s respirator, as a result of a combination of protective features of the Stenhouse&#x27;s respirator and other breathing devices. This invention was later described in 1875.

In the 1950s, HEPA filters were commercialized as highly efficient air filters, after being put to use in the 1940s in the United States&#x27; Manhattan Project to control airborne radioactive contaminants.

The first residential HEPA filter was reportedly sold in 1963 by brothers Manfred and Klaus Hammes in Germany, who created the Incen Air Corporation which was the precursor to the IQAir corporation.

==Use and benefits==
Dust, pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and dust mite feces can act as allergens, triggering allergies in sensitive people. Smoke particles and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can pose a risk to health. Exposure to various components such as VOCs increases the likelihood of experiencing symptoms of sick building syndrome.

===COVID-19===
Joseph Allen, director of the Healthy Buildings program at Harvard&#x27;s School of Public Health, recommends that school classrooms use an air purifier with a HEPA filter as a way to reduce transmission of COVID-19 virus, saying &quot;Portables with a high-efficiency HEPA filter and sized for the appropriate room can capture 99.97 percent of airborne particles.&quot;

One fluid dynamic modelling study from January 2021 suggests that operating air purifiers or air ventilation systems in confined spaces, such as an elevator, during their occupancy by multiple people leads to air circulation effects that could, theoretically, enhance viral transmission. However, real-life testing of portable HEPA/UV air filters in COVID-19 wards in hospital demonstrated complete elimination of air-borne SARS-CoV-2. This report also showed a significant reduction in other bacteria, fungal and viral bioaerosol, suggesting that portable filters such as this may be able to prevent not only nosocomial spread of COVID-19 but also other hospital-acquired infections. The Addenbrooke&#x27;s Air Disinfection Study (AAirDS) undertook a quasi-experimental study comparing paired wards with and without air purifying devices. The researchers found an association between the deployment of air purifying devices and reduced nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 but the size of the effect and uncertainty around it were high. Acceptability of the devices in the hospital environment was imperfect, and as other restrictions such as masking and room occupancy were reduced so too did compliance with the air purifying devices.

==Purifying techniques==
There are two types of air purifying technologies, &quot;active&quot; and &quot;passive&quot;. Active air purifiers release negatively charged ions into the air, causing pollutants to stick to surfaces, while passive air purification units use air filters to remove pollutants. Passive purifiers are more efficient since all the dust and particulate matter is permanently removed from the air and collected in the filters.
Several different processes of varying effectiveness can be used to purify air. As of 2005, the most common methods were high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI).

=== Filtration ===
Air filter purification traps airborne particles by size exclusion. Air is forced through a filter and particles are physically captured by the filter. Various filters exist notably including:
* High-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filters remove at least 99.97% of 0.3-micrometer particles and are usually more effective at removing larger and smaller particles. HEPA purifiers, which filter all the air going into a clean room, must be arranged so that no air bypasses the HEPA filter. In dusty environments, a HEPA filter may follow an easily cleaned conventional filter (prefilter) which removes coarser impurities so that the HEPA filter needs cleaning or replacing less frequently. HEPA filters do not generate ozone or harmful byproducts in the course of operation.
* Filter HVAC at MERV 14 or above are rated to remove airborne particles of 0.3 micrometers or larger. A high-efficiency MERV 14 filter has a capture rate of at least 75% for particles between 0.3 and 1.0 micrometers. Although the capture rate of a MERV filter is lower than that of a HEPA filter, a central air system can move significantly more air in the same period of time. Using a high-grade MERV filter can be more effective than using a high-powered HEPA machine at a fraction of the initial capital expenditure. Unfortunately, most furnace filters are slid in place without an airtight seal, which allows air to pass around the filters. This problem is worse for the higher-efficiency MERV filters because of the increase in air resistance. Higher-efficiency MERV filters are usually denser and increase air resistance in the central system, requiring a greater air pressure drop and consequently increasing energy costs.
* There is ongoing research to enable viable and effective biocide treated air filters (i.e. air filters coated with antimicrobial agents) for preventing the spread of airborne pathogens.

=== Other methods ===

* Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation - UVGI can be used to sterilize air that passes UV lamps via forced air. Air purification UVGI systems can be freestanding units with shielded UV lamps that use a fan to force air past the UV light. Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves micro-organisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is the placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead micro-organisms. For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light. However, a UV lamp placed at the coils and drain pan of the cooling system will keep micro-organisms from forming in these naturally damp places. The most effective method for treating the air rather than the coils is in-line duct systems, these systems are placed in the center of the duct and parallel to the airflow.
* Activated carbon is a porous material that can adsorb volatile chemicals on a molecular basis, but does not remove larger particles. The adsorption process when using activated carbon must reach equilibrium thus it may be difficult to completely remove contaminants. Activated carbon is merely a process of changing contaminants from a gaseous phase to a solid phase, when aggravated or disturbed contaminants can be regenerated in indoor air sources. Activated carbon can be used at room temperature and has a long history of commercial use. It is normally used in conjunction with other filter technology, especially with HEPA. Other materials can also absorb chemicals but at a higher cost.
* Polarized-media electronic air cleaners use active electronically enhanced media to combine elements of both electronic air cleaners and passive mechanical filters. Most polarized-media electronic air cleaners use safe 24-volt DC voltage to establish the polarizing electric field. Most airborne particles have a charge and many are even bi-polar. As airborne particles pass through the electric field the polarized field re-orients the particle to adhere to a disposable fiber media pad. Ultra-fine particles (UFPs) that are not collected on their initial pass through the media pad are polarized and agglomerate to other particles, odor and VOC molecules and are collected on subsequent passes. The collection efficiency varies significantly by particle size. The efficiency of polarized-media electronic air cleaners increases as they load, providing high-efficiency filtration, with air resistance typically equal to or less than passive filters. Polarized-media technology is non-ionizing, which means no ozone is produced.
* Photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) is an emerging technology in the HVAC industry. In addition to the prospect of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) benefits, it has the added potential for limiting the introduction of unconditioned air to the building space, thereby presenting an opportunity to achieve energy savings over previous prescriptive designs. As of May 2009 there was no more disputable concern raised by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory data that PCO may significantly increase the amount of formaldehyde in real indoor environments. As with other advanced technologies, sound engineering principles and practices should be employed by the HVAC designer to ensure proper application of the technology. Photocatalytic oxidation systems are able to completely oxidize and degrade organic contaminants. For example, Volatile Organic Compounds found low concentrations within a few hundred ppmv or less are the most likely to be completely oxidized. PCO uses short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC), commonly used for sterilization, to energize the catalyst (usually titanium dioxide (TiO2)) and oxidize bacteria and viruses. PCO in-duct units can be mounted to an existing forced-air HVAC system. PCO is not a filtering technology, as it does not trap or remove particles. Like polarized electric media, the effectiveness of PCO approaches are highly dependent on particle size, and system geometries must be tailored accordingly. PCO systems are sometimes coupled with other filtering technologies for air purification. UV sterilization bulbs must be replaced about once a year; manufacturers may require periodic replacement as a condition of warranty. Photocatalytic Oxidation systems often have high commercial costs.
** A related technology relevant to air purification is photoelectrochemical oxidation (PECO) Photoelectrochemical oxidation. While technically a type of PCO, PECO involves electrochemical interactions among the catalyst material and reactive species (e.g., through emplacement of cathodic materials) to improve quantum efficiency; in this way, it is possible to use lower energy UVA radiation as the light source and yet achieve improved effectiveness.
* Ionizer purifiers use charged electrical surfaces or needles to generate electrically charged air or gas ions. These ions attach to airborne particles which are then electrostatically attracted to a charged collector plate. This mechanism produces trace amounts of ozone and other oxidants as by-products. Most ionizers produce less than 0.05 ppm of ozone, an industrial safety standard. There are two major subdivisions: the fanless ionizer and fan-based ionizer. Fanless ionizers are noiseless and use little power, but are less efficient at air purification. Fan-based ionizers clean and distribute air much faster. Permanently mounted home and industrial ionizer purifiers are called electrostatic precipitators.
* Plasma air purifiers are a form of ionizing air purifier. Instead of precipitating particles on a plate, they are primarily intended to destroy volatile organic compounds, bacteria, and viruses by chemical reactions with generated ions. While promising in laboratory conditions, their usefulness and safety has not been established in air purification.
* Far-UVC air purification systems (under development).
* Immobilized cell technology removes microfine particulate matter from the air by attracting charged particulates to a bio-reactive mass, or bioreactor, which enzymatically renders them inert.
* Ozone generators are designed to produce ozone and are sometimes sold as whole-house air cleaners. Unlike ionizers, ozone generators are intended to produce significant amounts of ozone, a strong oxidant gas which can oxidize many other chemicals. The only safe use of ozone generators is in unoccupied rooms, utilising &quot;shock treatment&quot; commercial ozone generators that produce over 3000 mg of ozone per hour. Restoration contractors use these types of ozone generators to remove smoke odors after fire damage, musty smells after flooding, mold (including toxic molds), and the stench caused by decaying flesh which cannot be removed by bleach or anything else except for ozone. However, it is not healthy to breathe ozone gas, and one should use extreme caution when buying a room air purifier that also produces ozone.
* Titanium dioxide (TiO2) technology - nanoparticles of TiO2, together with calcium carbonate to neutralize any acidic gasses that may be adsorbed, is mixed into slightly porous paint. Photocatalysis initiates the decomposition of airborne contaminants at the surface.
* Thermodynamic sterilization (TSS) - This technology uses heat sterilization via a ceramic core with microcapillaries, which are heated to . It is claimed that 99.9% of microbiological particles - bacteria, viruses, dust mite allergens, mold and fungus spores - are incinerated. The air passes through the ceramic core by the natural process of air convection, and is then cooled using heat transfer plates and released. TSS is not a filtering technology, as it does not trap or remove particles. TSS is claimed not to emit harmful by-products (although the byproducts of partial thermal decomposition are not addressed) and also reduces the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere.
* Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Technology also known as &quot;ROS Purifier&quot; - There are 7 airborne ROS. Some are short-lived and some are long-lived. The five short-lived ones are going to be hydroxyl radical, Singlet Oxygen (dioxidene), Superoxide, Atomic Oxygen, Peroxynitrite (peroxynitrite). The two long-lived ROS ones are Hydrogen Peroxide – Gas Phased, and Ozone. Due to the long-lived Hydrogen Peroxide (gas phased) and with low levels of Ozone (30ppb - 50 ppb) It is very effective in killing pathogens that include mold, bacteria, viruses, and germs in the air and on surfaces and provide odor control. Unlike Ozone generators that produce a high amount of ozone that is used as &quot;shock treatment&quot; is only effective in empty rooms without people present whereas ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) purifiers can be effective safely 24/7 while people are present when ozone is (30ppb - 50 ppb). ROS (Reactive Oxygen Species) has very effective long-distance surface treatment due to its output of ozone (30ppb - 50ppb) and Hydrogen Peroxide it has, unlike Titanium dioxide that produces 2 ROS which are Hydroxyl radicals and superoxide that are a very short distance on surface treatment.

==Consumer concerns==

Other aspects of some air cleaners are hazardous gaseous by-products from ozone-generating units, noise level, frequency of filter replacement, electrical consumption, and visual appeal. Ozone production is typical for air ionizing purifiers. A high concentration of ozone is dangerous, although most air ionizers produce low amounts, low rates of ozone reduce the effectiveness. A build up can cause detrimental health effects especially for vulnerable people. The noise level of a purifier can often be obtained through a customer service department and is usually reported in decibels (dB). The noise levels for most purifiers can vary and may be dependent on fan speed. Frequency of filter replacement and electrical consumption are the major operation costs for any purifier. There are many types of filters; some can be cleaned by water, by hand or by vacuum cleaner, while others need to be replaced every few months or years. Sometimes suitable filters are only sold by the manufacturer for a high cost, some have DRM control so only replacement filters authorised by the manufactuere can be used. In the United States, some purifiers are certified as Energy Star and are energy efficient.

HEPA technology is used in portable air purifiers as it removes common airborne allergens. The US Department of Energy has requirements manufacturers must pass to meet HEPA requirements. The HEPA specification requires removal of at least 99.97% of 0.3 micrometers airborne pollutants. Products that claim to be &quot;HEPA-type&quot;, &quot;HEPA-like&quot;, or &quot;99% HEPA&quot; do not satisfy these requirements and may not have been tested in independent laboratories.

Air purifiers may be rated on a variety of factors, including Clean Air Delivery Rate (which determines how well air has been purified); efficient area coverage; air changes per hour; energy usage; and the cost of the replacement filters. Two other important factors to consider are the length that the filters are expected to last (measured in months or years) and the noise produced (measured in decibels) by the various settings that the purifier runs on. This information is available from most manufacturers.

==Potential ozone hazards==
As with other health-related appliances, there is controversy surrounding the claims of certain companies, especially involving ionic air purifiers. Many air purifiers generate some ozone, an energetic allotrope of three oxygen atoms, and in the presence of humidity, small amounts of NOx. Because of the nature of the ionization process, ionic air purifiers tend to generate the most ozone. This is a serious concern because ozone is a criteria air pollutant regulated by health-related US federal and state standards. In a controlled experiment, in many cases, ozone concentrations were well in excess of public and/or industrial safety levels established by US Environmental Protection Agency, particularly in poorly ventilated rooms.

Ozone can damage the lungs, causing chest pain, coughing, shortness of breath and throat irritation. It can also worsen chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and compromise the ability of the body to fight respiratory infections—even in healthy people. People who have asthma and allergy are most prone to the adverse effects of high levels of ozone. For example, increasing ozone concentrations to unsafe levels can increase the risk of asthma attacks.

Due to the below average performance and potential health risks, Consumer Reports has advised against using ozone producing air purifiers. Some manufacturers falsely claim outdoor and indoor ozone are different. Claims that these devices restore a hypothesized ionic balance are unsupported by science.

Ozone generators are used by cleanup contractors on unoccupied rooms to oxidize and permanently remove smoke, mold, and odor damage, and are considered a valuable and effective industrial tool. However, these machines can produce undesirable by-products.

In September 2007, the California Air Resources Board announced a ban of indoor air cleaning devices which produce ozone above a legal limit. This law, which took effect in 2010, requires testing and certification of all types of indoor air cleaning devices to verify that they do not emit excessive ozone.

== Industry and markets ==
As of 2015, the United States residential air purifier total addressable market was estimated at $2 billion per year.

<text>Robert Fox Bacher (August 31, 1905November 18, 2004) was an American nuclear physicist and one of the leaders of the Manhattan Project. Born in Loudonville, Ohio, Bacher obtained his undergraduate degree and doctorate from the University of Michigan, writing his 1930 doctoral thesis under the supervision of Samuel Goudsmit on the Zeeman effect of the hyperfine structure of atomic levels. After graduate work at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he accepted a job at Columbia University. In 1935 he accepted an offer from Hans Bethe to work with him at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. It was there that Bacher collaborated with Bethe on his book &quot;Nuclear Physics. A: Stationary States of Nuclei&quot; (1936), the first of three books that would become known as the &quot;Bethe Bible&quot;.

In December 1940, Bacher joined the Radiation Laboratory at MIT, although he did not immediately cease his research at Cornell into the neutron cross section of cadmium. The Radiation Laboratory was organized into two sections, one for incoming radar signals, and one for outgoing radar signals. Bacher was appointed to handle the incoming signals section. Here he gained valuable experience in administration, coordinating not just the efforts of his scientists, but also those of General Electric and RCA. In 1942, Bacher was approached by Robert Oppenheimer to join the Manhattan Project at its new laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico. It was at Bacher&#x27;s insistence that Los Alamos became a civilian rather than a military laboratory. At Los Alamos, Bacher headed the project&#x27;s P (Physics) Division, and later its G (Gadget) Division. Bacher worked closely with Oppenheimer, and the two men discussed the project&#x27;s progress on a daily basis.

After the war, Bacher became director of the Laboratory of Nuclear Studies at Cornell. He also served on the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, the civilian agency that replaced the wartime Manhattan Project, and in 1947 he became one of its inaugural commissioners. He left in 1949 to become head Division of Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy at Caltech. He was appointed a member of the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) in 1958. In 1962, he became Caltech&#x27;s vice president and provost. He stepped down from the post of provost in 1970, and became a professor emeritus in 1976. He died in 2004 at the age of 99.

== Early life and career ==
Bacher was born in Loudonville, Ohio, on August 31, 1905, the only child of Harry and Byrl Fox Bacher. In 1908, the family moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where Harry worked as a banker and Byrl as a voice teacher on the University of Michigan faculty. Bacher attended the W. S. Perry School, and later Ann Arbor High School. While there he met Professor Harrison M. Randall, the head of the physics department at the University of Michigan, who encouraged him to study physics.

Bacher entered the University of Michigan, where he joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity and lived in the frat house. He became the house manager in his sophomore year, but moved back home in his junior year to concentrate on physics. At Randall&#x27;s suggestion he applied to the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, which he entered in 1926 to study for his doctorate. His fees were paid by his family, but his father had a heart attack and could no longer afford them, so in 1927 Bacher moved back to Ann Arbor, where he lived at home, and attended the University of Michigan. He received a Charles A. Coffin Foundation Fellowship from General Electric.

To build up the theoretical physics department at the University of Michigan, Randall recruited four distinguished young physicists to work at Ann Arbor in 1927: Otto Laporte, George Uhlenbeck, Samuel Goudsmit, and David M. Dennison. The University of Michigan was no longer a backwater in theoretical physics. Bacher immediately signed up for Goudsmit&#x27;s course on atomic structure. With Goudsmit he investigated the Zeeman effect of hyperfine structure of atomic levels, which became the subject of his 1930 PhD thesis.

On May 30, 1930, Bacher married Jean Dow. His mother gave them a Ford Model A and the use of the family&#x27;s lakeside holiday house, where they entertained guests including Paul Ehrenfest and Enrico Fermi. In 1931, with a National Research Council Fellowship, he spent a year at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) because Ira Bowen taught there. At Caltech Bacher attended lectures by Robert Oppenheimer, but spent most of his time at the Mt. Wilson Observatory, which had a better library. Bacher decided to create a work listing the energy, coupling constant, parity and electron configurations of all the known atoms and ions, working with Goudsmit back in Ann Arbor. The result was a book, &quot;Atomic Energy States as Derived from the Analysis of Optical Spectra&quot; (1932), which they dedicated to Randall.

In the second year of his National Research Council Fellowship, Bacher moved across the country to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to work with John C. Slater, who had taught Bacher at Harvard. While there, Slater asked him to conduct a seminar on James Chadwick&#x27;s recent discovery of the neutron. Reading Chadwick&#x27;s paper, he realized that anomalies in then-current theory would be resolved if the spin of the neutron was . This became the subject of a letter he submitted to the &quot;Physical Review&quot; with visiting scholar Edward Condon. A year later, Bacher became the first to suggest the neutron had a magnetic moment equal to about minus one nuclear magneton, based on the unusually small magnetic moment of nitrogen determined from its hyperfine structure.

Afterwards Bacher returned to the University of Michigan on an Alfred H. Lloyd Fellowship. Jobs were hard to find at this time due to the Great Depression, and in 1934 he accepted a job at Columbia University, where he worked with Isidor Isaac Rabi, Jerrold Zacharias, Jerome Kellogg and Sid Millman. However it was difficult living in New York on his salary, and Jean gave birth to their first child, Martha, in December 1935. A second child, Andrew, was born in 1938. Bacher therefore accepted an offer from Hans Bethe to work with him at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Ithaca was a university town similar to Ann Arbor, where Bacher and Jean had been raised. At Cornell Bacher worked with Bethe on his book &quot;Nuclear Physics. A: Stationary States of Nuclei&quot; (1936), the first of three books that would become known as the &quot;Bethe Bible&quot;.

== World War II ==

=== Radiation Laboratory ===

In December 1940 Bacher joined the Radiation Laboratory at MIT, but did not immediately cease his research. He reached an arrangement with its director, Lee Alvin DuBridge, to return to Cornell for four days every three weeks until it was completed. He was researching the neutron cross section of cadmium, a topic of interest to Enrico Fermi, who was attempting to build a nuclear reactor, but whose figures did not agree with Bacher&#x27;s. Bacher carefully checked his results, and Fermi, convinced of their correctness, urged Bacher to publish them. Bacher submitted a paper to the &quot;Physical Review&quot; with instructions to withhold publication until after the war, and the paper was not published until 1946.

DuBridge organized the Radiation Laboratory into two sections, one for incoming radar signals, and one for outgoing radar signals. Bacher was appointed to handle the incoming signals section. Here he gained valuable experience in administration, coordinating not just the efforts of his scientists, but also those of General Electric and RCA. He later recalled: 

=== Manhattan Project ===
In 1942, Bacher and Rabi, the Radiation Laboratory&#x27;s assistant director, were approached by Oppenheimer to join the Manhattan Project at its new laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico. They convinced Oppenheimer that the plan for a military laboratory would not work, since a scientific effort would need to be a civilian affair. The plan was modified, and the new laboratory would be a civilian one, run by the University of California under contract from the War Department. Bacher felt that this was his first contribution to the success of the project. He met with Oppenheimer at Los Alamos in April 1943, but was not convinced that he was needed. Oppenheimer wrote to him that:
Bacher then accepted the job at Los Alamos, moving there in May 1943 with his family to become the head of the Experimental Physics Division (P Division). His wife Jean Dow Bacher was also hired to work as a human computer in the Theoretical Division (T Division). For his seven group leaders he had John H. Williams, Robert R. Wilson, John H. Manley, Darol K. Froman, Emilio G. Segrè, Bruno B. Rossi and Donald W. Kerst. Bacher worked closely with Oppenheimer, and the two men discussed the project&#x27;s progress on a daily basis.

In July 1944, Oppenheimer reorganized the laboratory to focus on the problem of building an implosion-type nuclear weapon, which was necessary because the gun-type design would not work with plutonium. P Division was broken up, and Bacher became the head of the G (for Gadget) Division. This much larger division contained eleven groups headed by leaders who included William Higinbotham, Seth Neddermeyer, Edwin McMillan, Luis Alvarez and Otto Frisch.

While George Kistiakowsky&#x27;s Explosives Division (X Division) developed the explosive lenses, G Division designed the rest of the weapon. There were numerous difficulties to overcome, not the least of which was devising a means of detonating the lenses with the required speed. Robert F. Christy&#x27;s solid core design was chosen as the most likely design to succeed.

To coordinate the efforts of the laboratory, Oppenheimer created the &quot;Cowpuncher Committee&quot;, so-called because they were to &quot;ride herd&quot; on the implosion effort and coordinate all the efforts of the laboratory. It included Bacher, along with Samuel Allison, George Kistiakowsky, Deak Parsons, Charles Lauritsen and Hartley Rowe.

Three days before the day the bomb was to be test detonated in the New Mexico desert, Bacher was part of the pit assembly team, which assembled the nuclear capsule (a cylindrical section of the uranium tamper, containing the plutonium core and initiator) in an old farmhouse near the Alamogordo testing site. When the capsule was driven to the shot tower and inserted into the spherical tamper, inside the explosive assembly, it stuck. Bacher recognized that expansion of the capsule due to the heat given off by the plutonium core was causing the jam, and that leaving the two parts in contact would equalize temperatures and allow the capsule to be inserted fully. After watching the test, his reaction was merely &quot;Well, it works.&quot;

Bacher was packaging the third core for shipment to Tinian on August 12 at the Ice House at Los Alamos when he received word that the Japanese had initiated surrender negotiations. He had already set G Division the task of designing and building new types of cores and assemblies, and he co-authored a report with Robert Wilson urging the development of Edward Teller&#x27;s Super bomb. He served on a committee chaired by Richard Tolman that looked into declassifying documents produced by the Manhattan Project, and one chaired by Manson Benedict that investigated the technical feasibility of international control of nuclear energy. For his services to the Manhattan Project Bacher was awarded the Medal for Merit on January 12, 1946.

== Post-World War II ==

=== Atomic Energy Commission ===
After the war, Bacher returned to Ithaca to head Cornell&#x27;s Laboratory for Nuclear Studies. He agreed with Bethe that what Cornell needed to become a major player in high energy nuclear physics was a new synchrotron, but first he needed to find somewhere to put it. However, in 1946 Bacher was appointed to the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the new United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, along with fellow United States representatives Tolman and Oppenheimer. Bacher therefore had to divide his time between Ithaca and New York City.
In October 1946 David Lilienthal asked Bacher to become one of the inaugural commissioners of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, the civilian agency that was being formed to replace the wartime Manhattan Project. As a Republican, Bacher was easily confirmed by the Senate members of the United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy by an 8–0 vote. As he was the only one of the five commissioners who was a scientist—an important factor in his decision to accept the post—he played a leading role in the selection of the Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s influential General Advisory Committee to which nine scientists were appointed: James Conant, Lee DuBridge, Enrico Fermi, Robert Oppenheimer, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Hartley Rowe, Glenn Seaborg, Cyril Stanley Smith and Hood Worthington.

Bacher and fellow commissioner Sumner Pike began with an inspection of Los Alamos and the Hanford Site, and conducted an inventory of the fissionable material at Los Alamos with Norris Bradbury, who had succeeded Oppenheimer as its director. He found that only nine atomic bombs had been built in 1946; only four would be in 1947, primarily due to production problems with the reactors at Hanford. These problems were on their way to resolution when Bacher observed the Operation Sandstone nuclear tests at Enewetak Atoll in 1948 as the Atomic Energy Commission&#x27;s representative. Bacher&#x27;s original two-year term would have expired on January 1, 1949, but President Harry Truman convinced him to stay on. Bacher resigned in May 1949, and this time the President was unable to dissuade him.

Bacher wished to return to academia, but Robert Wilson was now the head of Cornell&#x27;s Laboratory for Nuclear Studies, and Bacher felt that it would be awkward working for someone who was one of his group leaders at Los Alamos. He therefore accepted an offer from Lee DuBridge of the chair of the Division of Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy at Caltech. However the work at the Atomic Energy Commission was not so easily left behind. Senator Bourke Hickenlooper charged the commission with mismanagement, specifically cost overruns at Hanford, awarding a scholarship to a communist, and the loss of of uranium from the Argonne National Laboratory. Bacher felt obligated to return to Washington to testify on Lilienthal&#x27;s behalf before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.

Another crisis broke in September 1949 when the Air Force picked up signs of the Soviet Union&#x27;s RDS-1 nuclear test. Bacher joined Oppenheimer, Parsons, General Hoyt Vandenberg, the Atomic Energy Commissioners and a British delegation under William Penney to discuss what to do. The recent devaluation of the British pound had already triggered a financial crisis, and there was concern about how the markets would react to the news. Oppenheimer and Bacher saw the evidence of a nuclear test as conclusive, and Bacher in particular came down strongly on the side of making a public announcement, as the number of people who already knew made a leak almost inevitable. Truman made the announcement a few days later.

=== Caltech ===
The division chair that Bacher now occupied at Caltech had been vacant since Robert A. Millikan had retired in 1945. Although nominally a professorship, it was primarily an administrative post. In 1949 there were 17 professors in the department, of whom nine were physicists, two were astrophysicists, and the remaining six were mathematicians. There were two world class research laboratories funded by the Office of Naval Research, the Cosmic Ray Laboratory that had been founded by Millikan, which was now directed by Carl Anderson, and the W. K. Kellogg Radiation Laboratory which was directed by Charles Lauritsen. But there were no facilities for high energy physics; these would have to be created from scratch.

In moving into high energy physics Bacher had the full support not just of DuBridge, but of Anderson and Lauritsen as well. Lauritsen had already hired Robert Langmuir to begin designing a new 600 MeV synchrotron, and Bacher found a large building to house it that had originally been used for grinding and polishing the Palomar Observatory&#x27;s mirror, but which had been empty since 1948. He arranged for Atomic Energy Commission and Office of Naval Research grants worth $1 million to build it and the other required facilities, and $300,000 a year to run it.

Facilities were not enough; Bacher needed physicists. Lauritsen had made a start on this too, by hiring Robert Christy. Bacher hired experimental physicists Alvin V. Tollestrup, Robert M. Walker and Matthew Sands. The physicist that Bacher decided he wanted most, though, was Richard Feynman. To get him, Bacher offered a large salary, and agreed to pay for Feynman&#x27;s 1950–1951 sabbatical in Brazil. Feynman would go on to win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. In 1955 Bacher hired Murray Gell-Mann, who would win the Nobel Prize in 1969.

The relatively new field of radio astronomy sparked Bacher&#x27;s interest, and he hired John Bolton and Gordon Stanley from the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in 1955. A grant from the Office of Naval Research allowed Bolton to build the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, which became an important center for the study of quasars.

Caltech did not spell an end to Bacher&#x27;s service in Washington. He served two terms as a member of the President&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, from November 18, 1953, to June 30, 1955, and from December 9, 1957, to December 31, 1959. During his first term he testified on behalf of his old friend at the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954. During his second, he worked with James Fisk and Ernest Lawrence to examine how a Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty could be monitored.

Bacher remained chair of the division of physics, mathematics and astronomy at Caltech until 1962, when he was appointed as vice president and provost. He stepped down from the post of provost in 1970 at the age of 65, and became a professor emeritus in 1976. He still did some research at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and visited Caltech from time to time. In 1983 he was master of ceremonies at Los Alamos for events commemorating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the laboratory in 1943. In his lifetime, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Bacher died on November 18, 2004, at a retirement home in Montecito, California. He was survived by his daughter, Martha Bacher Eaton, and son, Andrew Dow Bacher, a nuclear physicist working at Indiana University, his wife Jean having died on May 28, 1994. His papers are in the California Institute of Technology Archives.

<doc id="1197599" wikidata="Q1096979" url="?curid=1197599" title="Green Party Northern Ireland">
<text>The Green Party Northern Ireland, sometimes abbreviated as Green Party NI, is a political party in Northern Ireland. Like many green political parties around the world, its origins lie in the anti-nuclear, labour and peace movements of the 1970s and early 1980s.

Since 2006, the party has operated as a region of the Green Party of Ireland and also maintains links with other Green parties, including the Scottish Greens and the Green Party of England and Wales. The party has a youth wing operating in Northern Ireland, the Young Greens. The party also has LGBT policies and an activist group operating in Northern Ireland, the Queer Greens.

== History ==
In the Northern Ireland local elections of May 1981, Peter Emerson, Avril McCandless and Malcolm Samuels stood as the first candidates to use the Ecology label in Northern Ireland and gained 202, 81 and 61 votes respectively; the first in a large urban area, the other two in smaller rural constituencies. Emerson had previously stood in the same area in 1977.

In May 1983, the Northern Ireland Ecology Party was launched at a press conference held in the Europa Hotel, Belfast, with members of the British and Irish Ecology parties in attendance. At the same time, the three parties put forward one combined policy on Northern Ireland, the first time that UK and Irish political parties had held a common Northern Ireland policy.

In 1985, ecology parties throughout the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom changed their names to Green Party.

The party became a region of the Green Party of Ireland in 2006. These arrangements are said to demonstrate the Northern Ireland party&#x27;s cross-community nature, as the Green Party claim to be the only party that actually lives the Good Friday Agreement through its operational set up through north–south and east–west links.

In 2007, a Green society was established at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. In 2010, the LGBT Greens NI were established: a policy group and lobby group specialising in LGBT community issues within Northern Ireland. The LGBT group dissolved in early 2012 as their main aim—pushing for the inclusion of same-sex marriage within party policy—was achieved at the 2011 AGM after a unanimous vote.

The party supported a no vote in the 2011 Alternative Vote referendum.

In February 2015, the Queer Greens party group was set up to become the LGBT issues and activist wing of the party. The group is taking charge of party policy on LGBT rights, issues, welfare, campaigning, lobbying and raising awareness.

On 14 January 2016, the party announced that it had selected Ellen Murray as its candidate to contest the 2016 Northern Ireland Assembly elections for West Belfast, making her the first openly transgender person to stand for election on the island of Ireland.

In June 2023, the party got their first ever mayoral role when Áine Groogan was made the deputy lord mayor of Belfast.

==Policies==
The Green Party has four key values: social justice, environmental sustainability, grassroots democracy and non-violence. It is considered to be more to the left than most parties in Northern Ireland.

The Green Party has been involved in several major campaigns since entering the Northern Ireland Assembly, including clean rivers and anti-nuclear campaigns, opposition to fracking, and fighting the austerity agenda. It has also campaigned against the development of incinerators at Belfast North Foreshore and Lough Neagh, and against proposals to extend the airport runway at George Best Belfast City Airport.

The Green Party campaigns not just for more environmental protection but also for politics for the common good. Former leader Steven Agnew has championed the rights of children in Northern Ireland through his Private Member&#x27;s Bill which is seeking to establish a statutory duties on government departments to work together to deliver optimum children&#x27;s services. Agnew has also been a long-standing supporter of integrated education and a society based on equal rights and mutual respect for all traditions. This has included bringing forward the first motion on same-sex marriage to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2011. The party has also called for funding to be focused on improving public transport infrastructure and supports the creation of an independent environmental protection agency for Northern Ireland. They also campaign for a shift to alternative energy for Northern Ireland and were involved in the setting up of a lobby group for the sector. The Green Party in Northern Ireland campaigns for transparency in political funding, responsive local government, effective community planning, dynamic and sustainable local economies, environmental protection, and for animal welfare.

On the constitutional status of Northern Ireland, Agnew believes the status quo should remain &quot;until the people of Northern Ireland decide otherwise&quot;, but stated that the Green Party does not consider the issue as one that should divide its members or society. The party has also called for greater transparency in politics, arguing that political donations in Northern Ireland should be made public. Northern Ireland is the only region of the United Kingdom where political donations are secret.

The party has said it wants a citizens&#x27; assembly to examine if drugs should be decriminalised to reduce deaths. In March 2021, then deputy leader and now leader of the party since August 2022, Mal O&#x27;Hara, said legalisation and harm-reduction models should be considered as the &quot;current approach is obviously not working&quot;. In 2020, drug deaths in Northern Ireland were recorded at 218 according to official figures. This was an increase from the official recorded figure in 2019, which stood at 191 drug deaths in Northern Ireland and 92 in 2010, indicating the figure had more than doubled in a decade.

== Leaders ==
* Steven Agnew (10 January 2011 – 21 November 2018)
* Clare Bailey (21 November 2018 – 15 August 2022)
* Mal O&#x27;Hara (15 August 2022 – present)

==Election results ==
The party&#x27;s first electoral success in Northern Ireland was at the local council elections of 2005. Raymond Blaney was elected onto Down District Council and Brian Wilson, formerly of the Alliance Party, took a seat on North Down Borough Council. The party&#x27;s third local councillor was Ciaran Mussen, elected to Newry and Mourne District Council.

At the 2007 Northern Ireland Assembly election, the Green Party won its first seat in the Northern Ireland Assembly, when Brian Wilson won a seat in the North Down constituency. Overall the party won 11,985 first preference votes or 1.7% of the total – a rise of 1.4% since the 2003 Assembly election.

In 2009, the Green Party stood Steven Agnew in the European election he secured 15,674 votes, trebling the Green Party&#x27;s share of the vote. The Greens fought the election on the Green New Deal, calling for job creation in the green energy sector.

The Greens fielded four candidates in the 2010 UK general election, none of which managed to secure a seat. However, the number of votes for Green candidates more than trebled.

Brian Wilson MLA stood down ahead of the 2011 Assembly election, in which the party won a seat on North Down council, with their candidate Steven Agnew. Agnew subsequently stepped down from his position on North Down Borough Council as the party took a strong stand against so called &#x27;double jobbing&#x27; or dual mandate; he was replaced by John Barry.

In May 2016, the Greens picked up their second seat in the Northern Ireland Assembly when Clare Bailey took a seat in South Belfast.

In 2019, the Greens picked up seats in local elections across the country. They managed to double the seats and won four seats in Belfast City Council.

Bailey and Rachel Woods were both defeated in the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election, leaving the party with no representation in Stormont for the first time since 2007.

<doc id="1197631" wikidata="Q1687911" url="?curid=1197631" title="Jersey Dutch language">
<text>Jersey Dutch () (Low Dutch), also known as Bergen Dutch, was a Dutch dialect formerly spoken in northeastern New Jersey from the late 17th century until the early 20th century. It evolved in one of the two Dutch-speaking enclaves that remained for over two centuries after the dissolution of Dutch control in North America, the other (around Albany, New York) giving rise to Mohawk Dutch. It may have been a partial creole language based on Zeelandic and West Flemish Dutch dialects with English and possibly some elements of Lenape.

Jersey Dutch was spoken by the descendants of New Netherlanders who settled in Bergen, New Netherland, in 1630, and by Black slaves and free people of color also residing in that region, as well as the American Indian people known as the Ramapough Lenape Nation.

==Varieties==

By the mid-eighteenth century, according to one estimate, up to 20% of the population of the areas of New Jersey with &quot;a strong Dutch element&quot; were enslaved people. Blacks who grew up in insular Dutch communities were raised speaking the Dutch language, or adopted it later in life, to speak both with their white Dutch-descendant counterparts and with each other. Some blacks during this period spoke Dutch as their primary or only language, and for some knowing the language was a point of pride:&quot;They were Dutch and proud of it. I can remember my Aunt Sebania telling me about her great-grandmother, a stern old lady who both spoke and understood English, but who refused to speak it except in the privacy of her home. In public she spoke Dutch, as any proper person should do, a dignified language.&quot;Some contemporary reports from white speakers of Jersey Dutch reported a distinct variety of the language unique to the black population, which they called (&quot;Negro Dutch&quot;, not to be confused with the Dutch creole ). This term was used both for the speech of the Ramapough (a distinct community of black, white, and Lenape descent), and of other blacks in Bergen County. 

However, as attestation of Jersey Dutch from black and Ramapough speakers is scarce, scholars disagree whether &quot;Negerduits&quot; can be considered a distinct variety. Sojourner Truth&#x27;s Dutch, for example, was described by her owner&#x27;s daughter around 1810 as &quot;very similar to that of the unlettered white people of her time.&quot; The only contemporaneous linguistic treatment of Jersey Dutch draws primarily on the speech of three white Jersey Dutch speakers and one Ramapough speaker, and notes phonetic, syntactic, and lexical differences between the two groups.

==Phonology==

=== Vowels ===
The vowel system of Jersey Dutch differs markedly from Standard Dutch, as well as from the Dutch dialects from which it derives, perhaps due to the influence of American English. The following chart is based on the speech of two white Jersey Dutch speakers recorded in 1910 and 1941 respectively. Parentheses &quot;indicate that the vowel is attested in few forms.&quot;
=== Consonants ===
Jersey Dutch consonants are largely the same as those of Standard Dutch, with a few exceptions.
==Example==
An example of Jersey Dutch, transcribed in 1913, spoken by Matthew Hicks of Mahwah, the white sexton of a Dutch church. 

=== Jersey Dutch ===
===Standard Modern Dutch===
Below is a word-by-word translation of the Jersey Dutch quote, rather than a fluent Dutch rendering.

===English===
&lt;poem&gt;
The prodigal/lost son:
A man had two sons; the one stayed at home; 
the other went abroad from home to make his fortune. 
He was not content at home and therefore then he became poor. 
He thought about it at home and his father’s place. 
Then said: I shall go home. My father has plenty.
&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>Minesweeping is the practice of removing explosive naval mines, usually by a specially designed ship called a minesweeper using various measures to either capture or detonate the mines, but sometimes also with an aircraft made for that purpose. Minesweeping has been practiced since the advent of naval mining in 1855 during the Crimean War. The first minesweepers date to that war and consisted of British rowboats trailing grapnels to snag the mines.

==By ship==
A sweep is either a contact sweep, a wire dragged through the water by one or two ships to cut the mooring wire of floating mines, or a distance sweep that mimics a ship to detonate the mines. The sweeps are dragged by minesweepers, either purpose-built military ships or converted trawlers. Each run covers between , and the ships must move slowly in a straight line, making them vulnerable to enemy fire. This was exploited by the Turkish army in the Battle of Gallipoli in 1915, when mobile howitzer batteries prevented the British and French from clearing a path through minefields.

If a contact sweep hits a mine, the wire of the sweep rubs against the mooring wire until it is cut. Sometimes &quot;cutters&quot;, explosive devices to cut the mine&#x27;s wire, are used to lessen the strain on the sweeping wire. Mines cut free are recorded and collected for research or shot with a deck gun. Before the First World War, the Imperial Russian Navy officer Pyotr Kitkin invented &quot;mine protectors&quot; to break a sweeping wire before it could cut the mine&#x27;s mooring wire.

Minesweepers protect themselves with an oropesa or paravane instead of a second minesweeper. These are torpedo-shaped towed bodies, similar in shape to a Harvey Torpedo, that are streamed from the sweeping vessel thus keeping the sweep at a determined depth and position. Some large warships were routinely equipped with paravane sweeps near the bows in case they inadvertently sailed into minefields—the mine would be deflected towards the paravane by the wire instead of towards the ship by its wake. More recently, heavy-lift helicopters have dragged minesweeping sleds, as in the 1991 Persian Gulf War.

The distance sweep mimics the sound and magnetism of a ship and is pulled behind the sweeper. It has floating coils and large underwater &quot;drums&quot;. It is the only sweep effective against bottom mines.

During the Second World War, RAF Coastal Command used Vickers Wellington bombers Wellington DW.Mk I fitted with degaussing coils to trigger magnetic mines.

Modern influence mines are designed to discriminate against false inputs and are much more difficult to sweep. They often contain inherent anti-sweeping mechanisms. For example, they may be programmed to respond to the unique noise of a particular ship-type, its associated magnetic signature and the typical pressure displacement of such a vessel. As a result, a mine-sweeper must accurately guess and mimic the required target signature to trigger detonation. The task is complicated by the fact that an influence mine may have one or more of a hundred different potential target signatures programmed into it.

Another anti-sweeping mechanism is a ship-counter in the mine fuze. When enabled, this allows detonation only after the mine fuze has been triggered a pre-set number of times. To further complicate matters, influence mines may be programmed to arm themselves (or disarm automatically—known as &quot;self-sterilization&quot;) after a pre-set time. During the pre-set arming delay (which could be days or weeks) the mine would remain dormant and ignore any target stimulus, whether genuine or faked.

When influence mines are laid in an ocean minefield, they may have various combinations of fuze settings configured. For example, some mines (with the acoustic sensor enabled) may become active within three hours of being laid, others (with the acoustic and magnetic sensors enabled) may become active after two weeks but have the ship-counter mechanism set to ignore the first two trigger events, and still others in the same minefield (with the magnetic and pressure sensors enabled) may not become armed until three weeks have passed. Groups of mines within this mine-field may have different target signatures which may or may not overlap. The fuzes on influence mines allow many different permutations, which complicates the clearance process.

Mines with ship-counters, arming delays, and highly specific target signatures in mine fuses can falsely convince a belligerent that a particular area is clear of mines or has been swept effectively because a succession of vessels have already passed through safely.

==By aircraft==
Aircraft can also be used for minesweeping. During the Second World War, fifteen British Vickers Wellington bombers were modified to carry a large magnetic induction loop and an electrical generator. The &quot;Directional Wireless Installation&quot; (DWI), a cover story for the true purpose of the magnetic loop, was used successfully on 10 May 1940, to sweep a path for the escape of the Dutch royal family to the UK. The DWI was used most successfully in the Mediterranean Theatre, particularly over the Suez Canal and Alexandria Harbour. Their use revealed the limitations of the technique, in that it only works effectively in very shallow water (such as canals and harbours). From about 1943, German Junkers Ju 52 transports were similarly converted. Blohm &amp; Voss BV 138 MS tri-motor flying boats were also used for this purpose.

The MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopter is used primarily by the United States Navy to tow several types of mine hunting or mine sweeping gear through the water. It replaced the earlier, RH-53A and RH-53D variants of the Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion. Other examples of minesweeping helicopters include the RH-3A variant of the Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King, as well as the Mi-14BT variant of the Mil Mi-14 and the MCH-101 variant of the AgustaWestland AW101.

<text>Yuri Nikolaevich Artsutanov (; 5 October 1929 – 1 January 2019) was a Russian engineer born in Leningrad. He was one of the pioneers of the idea of a space elevator.

The February issue of the ISEC Newsletter is devoted to his life and place in history and features reminisces and photographs from his colleagues in the West, including his attendance at the 2010 ISEC Space Elevator conference.

==Biography==
Artsutanov was a graduate of Leningrad Technological Institute. In 1960, he wrote an article &quot;V Kosmos na Electrovoze (en. &quot;Into space with the help of an electric locomotive&quot;)&quot;, where he discussed the concept of the space elevator as an economic, safe and convenient way to access orbit and facilitate space exploration.

Artsutanov developed his idea independently from Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who in 1895 proposed an idea of building an &quot;orbital tower&quot;. Artsutanov&#x27;s concept was based on the linking of geosynchronous satellites to the ground with a cable. He suggested using the satellite as the base from which to construct the tower since a geosynchronous satellite will remain over a fixed point on the equator. By using a counterweight, a cable would be lowered from the geosynchronous orbit to the surface of Earth while the counterweight was extended from the satellite away from Earth, keeping the center of mass of the cable at the same height above the Earth. The ideas of Tsiolkovsky&#x27;s compression-structure concept and Artsutanov&#x27;s tension-structure concept differ in that a compression structure is well outside conceivable future capabilities, while the tension-structure is much easier to build and maintain, and is considered possible with near-future technologies.

Artsutanov later went on to propose other concepts involving space tethers, including the lunar space elevator, and using rotating tethers for space transportation.

<doc id="1197653" wikidata="Q1760759" url="?curid=1197653" title="Saramaka">
<text>The Saramaka, Saamaka or Saramacca are one of six Maroon peoples (formerly called &quot;Bush Negroes&quot;) in the Republic of Suriname and one of the Maroon peoples in French Guiana. In 2007, the Saramaka won a ruling by the Inter-American Court for Human Rights supporting their land rights in Suriname for lands they have historically occupied, over national government claims. It was a landmark decision for indigenous peoples in the world. They have received compensation for damages and control this fund for their own development goals.

The word &quot;Maroon&quot; comes from the Spanish &quot;cimarrón&quot;, which was derived from an Arawakan root. Since 1990 especially, some of the Saramaka have migrated to French Guiana due to extended civil war in Suriname. By the early 16th century, the term &quot;maroon&quot; (&quot;cimarron&quot;) was used throughout the Americas to designate slaves who had escaped from slavery and set up independent communities beyond colonists&#x27; control.

== Setting and language ==
The 90,000 Saramaka in Suriname (some of whom live in neighboring French Guiana) are one minority within this multi-ethnic nation. The Saramaka, together with the other Maroons in Suriname and French Guiana: the Ndyuka (90,000), and the Matawai, Paramaka, Aluku, and Kwinti (who together number some 25,000).

Since their escape from slavery in the 17th and 18th centuries, the Saramaka have lived chiefly along the Upper Suriname River and its tributaries, the Gaánlío and the Pikílío. Since the 1960s, they also live along the Lower Suriname River in villages constructed by the colonial government and Alcoa, a major aluminum company. They were relocated to allow flooding of approximately half their tribal territory for a hydroelectric project built to supply electricity for an aluminum smelter. Today, about one-third of the Saramaka live in French Guiana, most having migrated there since 1990 after warfare in Suriname.

The Saramaka and the Matawai (in central Suriname) speak variants of a creole language called Saramaccan. The Ndyuka, Paramaka, and Aluku, (in eastern Suriname), as well as the several hundred Kwinti, speak variants of another creole language, Ndyuka. Both languages are historically related to Sranan Tongo, the creole language of coastal Suriname. About 50 percent of the Saramaccan lexicon derives from various West and Central African languages, 20 percent from English (the language of the original colonists in Suriname), 20 percent from Portuguese (the language of the overseers and slave masters on many Suriname plantations), and the remaining 10 percent from Amerindian languages and Dutch (the latter were later colonists). Although lexically different, the grammar resembles that of the other Atlantic creoles and derives from West African models.

== History ==
The ancestors of the Saramaka were among those Africans sold as plantation slaves to Europeans in Suriname in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Coming from a variety of West and Central African peoples speaking many different languages, they escaped into the dense rainforest – individually, in small groups, and sometimes in great collective rebellions. For nearly 100 years, they fought from the rainforest for their independence. They were so feared that late 18th century maps showed the defensive fortifications in the European colony intended to protect against their raids.

In 1762, a full century before the general emancipation of slaves in Suriname, the Maroons won their freedom and signed a treaty with the Dutch Crown to acknowledge their territorial rights and trading privileges. The Saramaka have a keen interest in the history of their formative years; they preserve their very rich oral tradition. Innovative scholarly research since the late 20th century has brought together oral and archival accounts in new histories. Like the other Suriname Maroons, the Saramaka lived almost as a state-within-a-state until the mid-20th century, when the pace of outside encroachments increased.
During the late 1980s, a civil war between Maroons and the military government of Suriname caused considerable hardship to the Saramaka and other Maroons. By mid-1989 approximately 3,000 Saramaka and 8,000 Ndyuka were living as temporary refugees in French Guiana. Access to the outside world was severely restricted for many Saramaka in their homeland. The end of the war in the mid-1990s initiated a period in which the national government largely neglected the needs of Saramaka and other Maroons while granting large timber and mining concessions to foreign multinationals (Chinese, Indonesian, Malaysian, and others) in traditional Saramaka territory. They did not consult the Saramaka authorities.

In addition, during this period there were numerous social changes, both on the coast of Suriname and in Saramaka territory. United States Peace Corps volunteers lived and worked in Saramaka villages, and Brazilian gold-miners arrived on the Suriname river. Such economic activities as prostitution, casino gambling, and drug smuggling became major industries in coastal Suriname and accompanied the miners to the interior.

In the mid-1990s, the Association of Saramaka Authorities filed a complaint before the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights to protect their land rights. In November 2007, the Inter-American Court for Human Rights ruled in favor of the Saramaka people against the government of Suriname. In this landmark decision, which establishes a precedent for all Maroon and indigenous peoples in the Americas, the Saramaka were granted collective rights to the lands on which their ancestors had lived since the early 18th century, including rights to decide about the exploitation of natural resources such as timber and gold within that territory. In addition, they were granted compensation from the government for damages caused by previous timber grants made to Chinese companies. This was paid into a special development fund, which is now managed by the Saramaka.

===Presence in French Guiana===
The Saramaka maroons were originally living in Suriname. They first came to French Guiana in the 19th century as freighters to the interior. During the gold rush, their services became important for the economy. In 1883, the Governor of French Guiana and the &quot;Granman&quot; (paramount chief) of the Saramaka, signed an official accord that the Saramaka could stay in French Guiana under the legal authority of the Granman. The accords have never been rescinded and allow the tribe entry to French Guiana without the risk of deportation.

== Subsistence, economy, and the arts ==

Traditional villages, which average 100 to 200 residents, consist of a core of matrilineal kin plus some wives and children of lineage men. Always located near a river, for water, transportation and fishing, they are constructed of an irregular arrangement of small houses, open-sided structures, domesticated trees, occasional chicken houses, various shrines, and scattered patches of bush. (In contrast, the so-called transmigration villages, built to house the 6,000 Saramaka displaced by the hydroelectric project, range up to 2,000 people. They are laid out in a European-style grid pattern, used throughout larger South American cities. In many cases they have been located far from the riverside, making life difficult for the occupants.) Horticultural camps, which include permanent houses and shrines, are located several hours by canoe from each village. They are exploited by small groups of women related through matrilineal ties.

Due to their matrilineal ties, many women have a house in their own birth village, another in their horticultural camp, and a third in their husband&#x27;s village. Men divide their time among several different houses, built at various times for themselves and for their wives. Traditional Saramaka houses are compact, wide enough to tie a hammock and not much longer from front to back; with walls of planks and woven palm fronds, and traditionally roofs of thatch or, increasingly, of corrugated metal. They do not have windows but often have elaborately carved facades. Since the Suriname civil war, the Saramaka have built an increasing number of houses in coastal, Western style. They use concrete as well as wood, and feature windows and more expansive floor plans.

For more than two centuries, the economy has been based on full exploitation of the forest environment and on periodic work trips by men to the coast to bring back Western goods. For subsistence, the Saramaka depend on shifting (swidden) horticulture done mostly by women, with hunting and fishing done by men, supplemented by the women gathering wild forest products, such as palm nuts. They imported a few key items, such as salt. Rice is the most cultivated crop, in dry (hillside) technique. Other crops include cassava, taro, okra, maize, plantains, bananas, sugarcane, and peanuts. Domesticated trees, such as coconut, orange, breadfruit, papaya, and calabash are mainly cultivated in the villages. There are no markets.

Until the late 20th century, the Saramaka produced most of their material culture, much of it embellished with decorative detail. Women sewed patchwork and embroidered clothing, and carved calabash bowls. Some men also produced baskets, and some women made pottery. Men built the houses and canoes. In addition, they carved a wide range of wooden objects for domestic use, such as stools, paddles, winnowing trays, cooking utensils, and combs. Today, an increasing number of items, including clothing, are imported from the coast.

Body cicatrization, practiced by virtually all Saramaka women as late as the 1970s and 1980s, had become relatively uncommon by the start of the 21st century. Numerous genres of singing, dance, drumming, and tale telling continue to be a vibrant part of Saramaka culture.

Once the men have cleared and burned the fields, horticulture is mainly women&#x27;s work. Women cultivate and process a variety of crops, choosing which to develop to continue preferred qualities. They process the food for meals and storage of foods such as peanuts. They use parts of plants to make some needed goods.

The men conduct hunting of game with shotguns; they also do most of the fishing as well. Men have long devoted a large portion of their adult years to earning money in work in coastal Suriname or French Guiana. This allows them to buy the Western goods considered essential to life in their home villages, such as shotguns and powder, tools, pots, cloth, hammocks, soap, kerosene, and rum. During the second half of the 20th century, small stores were established in many villages, making more goods available. Outboard motors, transistor radios, and tape recorders became common consumer items. Today, cell phones are ubiquitous: both men and women have greatly increased communication with Paramaribo. New economic opportunities in the gold industry – mining for men, prostitution for women – are being exploited.

== Social organization ==
Saramaka society is firmly based on a matrilineal kinship system. A clan (&quot;lo&quot;) – often several thousand individuals – consists of the matrilineal descendants of an original band of escaped slaves. Children are considered born into this clan. It is subdivided into lineages (&quot;bee&quot;) – usually 50 to 150 people – descended from a more recent ancestress. Several lineages from a single clan constitute the core of every village.

The matrilineal clans (&quot;lo&quot;) own land, based on claims staked out in the early 18th century as the original Maroons fled southward to freedom. Hunting and gathering rights belong to clan members collectively. Within the clan, temporary rights to land use for farming are negotiated by village headmen. The establishment of transmigration villages in the 1960s led to land shortages in certain regions. The success of the Saramakas in their lawsuit against the government of Suriname will now permit them to manage their lands with less outside interference.

Complex marriage prohibitions (including &quot;bee&quot; exogamy) and preferences are negotiated through divination. Demographic imbalance, owing to labor migration, permits widespread polygyny. Although co-wives hold equal status, relations between them are expected to be adversarial. The Saramaka treat marriage as an ongoing courtship, with frequent exchanges of gifts such as men&#x27;s woodcarving and women&#x27;s decorative sewing. Although many women live primarily in their husband&#x27;s village, men never spend more than a few days at a time in the matrilineal (home) village of a wife.

Each house belongs to an individual man or woman, but most social interaction occurs outdoors. The men in each cluster of several houses, whether &quot;bee&quot; members or temporary visitors, eat meals together. The women of these same clusters, whether &quot;bee&quot; members or resident wives of &quot;bee&quot; men, spend a great deal of time in each other&#x27;s company, often farming together as well.

Matrilineal principles, mediated by divination, determine the inheritance of material and spiritual possessions as well as political offices. Before death, however, men often pass on specialized ritual knowledge (and occasionally a shotgun) to a son.

Each child, after spending its first several years with its mother, is raised by an individual man or woman (not a couple) designated by the &quot;bee&quot;, girls typically are raised by women, and boys by men. Although children spend most of their time with matrilineal kin, father-child relations are warm and strong. Gender identity is established early, with children taking on responsibility for gender-typed adult tasks as soon as they are physically able. Girls often marry by age 15, whereas boys are more often in their twenties when they take their first wife.

A woman is required to go into seclusion during her menstrual cycle. The cycle is considered a time of transgression and destructive of village order. Women are not allowed to perform many of the village&#x27;s functions and face other restrictions during their menstrual cycle. The Saramaka expression &quot;to be in menstrual seclusion&quot; is the same as &quot;to be in mourning.&quot;

== Political organization and social control ==
The Saramaka people, like the other Maroon groups, are politically and formally run by men. The 2007 ruling of the Inter-American Court for Human Rights helps define the spheres of influence in which the national government and Saramaka authorities hold sway.

Saramaka society is egalitarian, with kinship forming the backbone of social organization. No social or occupational classes are distinguished. Elders are accorded special respect and ancestors are consulted, through divination, on a daily basis.

Protestant missionary schools have existed in some villages since the 18th century. State elementary schools came to most villages only in the 1960s. Schools ceased to function completely during the Suriname civil war of the late 1980s and have been rebuilt only partially since.

Since the 18th-century treaty, the Saramaka have had a government-approved paramount chief (&quot;gaamá&quot;), as well as a series of headmen (&quot;kabiteni&quot;) and assistant headmen (&quot;basiá&quot;). Traditionally, the role of these officials in political and social control was exercised in a context replete with oracles, spirit possession, and other forms of divination. As the national government is intervening more frequently in Saramaka affairs (and paying political officials nominal salaries), the sacred base of these officials’ power is gradually being eroded. These political offices are historically controlled and the property of clans (&quot;lo&quot;). Political activity is strongly dominated by men.

Council meetings (&quot;kuútu&quot;) and divination sessions provide complementary arenas for the resolution of social problems. Palavers may involve the men of a lineage, a village, or all Saramaka. They treat problems ranging from conflicts concerning marriage or fosterage to land disputes, political succession, or major crimes. These same problems, in addition to illness and other kinds of misfortune, are routinely interpreted through various kinds of divination as well. In all cases, consensus is found through negotiation, often with a strong role being played by gods and ancestors. In a type of reconciliation justice, guilty parties are usually required to pay for their misdeeds with material offerings to the lineage of the offended person. In the 18th century people found guilty of witchcraft were sometimes burned at the stake. Today, men caught in flagrante delicto with the wife of another man are either beaten by the woman&#x27;s kinsmen or made to pay them a fine.

Aside from adultery disputes, which sometimes mobilize a full canoe-load of men seeking revenge in a public fistfight, intra-Saramaka conflict rarely surpasses the level of personal relations. The civil war that began in 1986, pitting Maroons against the national army of Suriname, brought major changes to the villages of the interior. Members of the &quot;Jungle Commando&quot; rebel army, almost all Ndyuka and Saramaka, learned to use automatic weapons. They became accustomed to a state of war and plunder. Their reintegration into Saramaka (and Ndyuka) society has been difficult, though their migration to the coast and French Guiana has provided a safety valve, if not for the receiving areas.

== Belief system ==
Every aspect of Saramaka life is based in various religious beliefs. Such decisions as where to clear a garden or build a house, whether to undertake a trip, or how to deal with theft or adultery are made in consultation with village deities, ancestors, forest spirits, and snake gods. The means of communication with these powers vary from spirit possession and the consultation of oracle-bundles, to the interpretation of dreams. Gods and spirits, which are a constant presence in daily life, are also honored through frequent prayers, libations, feasts, and dances.

The rituals surrounding birth, death, and other life passages are extensive, as are those relating to more mundane activities, from hunting a tapir to planting a rice field. Today about 25 per cent of Saramaka are nominal Christians – mainly Moravian (some since the mid-18th century), but others Roman Catholic. Increasingly some are converted to Evangelicalism of one or another kind.

The Saramaka world is populated by a wide range of supernatural beings, from localized forest spirits and gods that reside in the bodies of snakes, vultures, jaguars, and other animals, to ancestors, river gods, and warrior spirits. Within these categories, each supernatural being is named, individualized, and given specific relationships to living people. Intimately involved in the ongoing events of daily life, these beings communicate to humans mainly through divination and spirit possession. &quot;Kúnus&quot; are the avenging spirits of people or gods who were wronged during their lifetime and who pledge themselves to eternally tormenting the matrilineal descendants and close matrilineal kinsmen of their offender. Much of Saramaka ritual life is devoted to their appeasement. The Saramaka believe that all evil originates in human action; not only does each misfortune, illness, or death stem from a specific past misdeed, but every offense, whether against people or gods, has eventual consequences. The ignoble acts of the dead intrude daily on the lives of the living; any illness or misfortune calls for divination, which quickly reveals the specific past act that caused it. Through the performance of rites, the ancestors speak, the gods dance, and the world is again made right.

Individual specialists who supervise rites oversee the major village- and clan-owned shrines that serve large numbers of clients, as well as the various categories of possession gods, and various kinds of minor divination. These specialists generally pass on their knowledge to selected individuals before death. A large proportion of Saramaka have some kind of specialized ritual expertise, which they occasionally exercise. They are paid in cloth, rum, or, increasingly, cash.

Saramaka ceremonial life is not determined by the calendar, but rather regulated by the occurrence of particular misfortunes, interpreted through divination. The most important ceremonies include those surrounding funerals and the appeasement of ancestors, public curing rites, rituals in honor of &quot;kúnus&quot; (in particular snake gods and forest spirits), and the installation of political officials.

Every case of illness is believed to have a specific cause that can be determined only through divination. The causes revealed vary from a lineage &quot;kúnu&quot; to sorcery, from a broken taboo to an ancestor&#x27;s displeasure. Once the cause is known, rites are carried out to appease the offended god or ancestor (or otherwise right the social imbalance). Since the 1960s, Western mission clinics and hospitals have been used by most Saramaka as a supplement to their own healing practices. During the Suriname Civil War of the 1980s and 1990s, most of these facilities were destroyed. They have only been very partially restored since.

The dead play an active role in the lives of the living. Ancestor shrines – several to a village – are the site of frequent prayers and libations, as the dead are consulted about ongoing village problems. A death occasions a series of complex rituals that lasts about a year, culminating in the final passage of the deceased to the status of ancestor. The initial rites, which are carried out over a period of one week to three months, depending on the importance of the deceased, end with the burial of the corpse in an elaborately constructed coffin filled with personal belongings. These rites include divination with the coffin (to consult the spirit of the deceased) by carrying it on the heads of two men, feasts for the ancestors, all-night drum/song/dance performances, and the telling of folktales. Some months later, a &quot;second funeral&quot; is conducted to mark the end of the mourning period and to chase the ghost of the deceased from the village forever. These rites involve the largest public gatherings in Saramaka and also include all-night drum/song/dance performances. At their conclusion, the deceased has passed out of the realm of the living into that of the ancestors.

== Isolation ==
The Saramaka people beyond Gaan Lio lived in relative isolation and as an uncontacted people group from the time of their ancestor&#x27;s escape from slavery in the eighteenth century. In the latter part of 1993, a local, independent missionary by the name of Steve Groseclose and a small group of Saramaka men from other less remote villages ventured beyond the main barrier point called Tapa Wata Sula, translated as Shut Off Rapids. This initial excursion led to subsequent trips and began the gradual influx of increasing outside influence throughout the following years. A local Saramaka man named Pompeia had left one of the uncontacted villages to visit the capital city of Paramaribo earlier that year. His knowledge of the villages beyond Tapa Wata Sula made him an invaluable guide on the first trips into the area.

== Ethnographic studies ==
Ethnography among the Saramaka was first conducted by Americans Melville and Frances Herskovits (during two summers in 1928 and 1929). Americans Richard and Sally Price have also studied the people (intermittently between 1966 and the present: in Suriname until 1986, and in French Guiana thereafter). This late-20th century fieldwork complements the modern fieldwork carried out among other groups of Suriname Maroons, such as the Ndyuka ethnography of Dutch scholars Bonno Thoden van Velzen and his partner Ineke van Wetering.

Edward C. Green, an American medical anthropologist, conducted fieldwork among the Matawais between 1970 and 1973, with intermittent visits since. His doctoral dissertation focused on changes underway then in the matrilineal kinship and indigenous spiritual belief systems. He has become known for his work on processes related to AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases, especially in African nations, and making use of indigenous healers.

<text>Charles Green (1893 – November 27, 1935) was an American jazz musician, who was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and died in New York City. He was one of the early jazz trombonists and the soloist in the Fletcher Henderson orchestra (joining slightly before Louis Armstrong).

==Biography==
He played locally in Omaha between 1920 and 1923, before his two stints with Henderson (July 1924 and April 1926; and late 1928 to early 1929). Described as &quot;a superior blues player who could also swing fairly early&quot;, Green played on several Bessie Smith recordings, notably &quot;Trombone Cholly&quot; featuring his trombone and biographical lyrics praising his playing, and the notorious &quot;Empty Bed Blues&quot; which features the &quot;dirty moaning&quot; of his playing.

Green also recorded in the 1920s with several other blues singers, and worked with the bands of Benny Carter (1929–1931 and 1933), Chick Webb (several times during 1930-1934), Jimmie Noone (1931), Don Redman (1932) and at the end with Kaiser Marshall. In 1928, Green played in the orchestra of the revue &quot;Keep Shufflin&quot;&#x27; together with Fats Waller and James P. Johnson.

According to jazz historian John Chilton (in his book &quot;Who&#x27;s Who of Jazz&quot;) Green&#x27;s premature death was from passing out on his doorstep in Harlem on a cold February night after having been unable to get into his home, and thus freezing to death. This story was disputed by Frederick J. Spencer, M.D., in his book &quot;Jazz and Death, Medical Profiles of Jazz Greats&quot;.

A folk song, known by various names, was recorded as &quot;Charley Green, Play That Slide Trombone&quot;, by Jim Croce and appears on the albums &quot;Facets&quot; (1966) and &quot;The Faces I&#x27;ve Been&quot; (1975). It has also been performed and recorded by Bessie Smith (as &quot;Trombone Cholly&quot;), Hoyt Axton and the Chicago area folksinger, Jim Craig.

<text>The superbone (sometimes known as the double trombone) is a hybrid tenor trombone in B that has both a slide like a regular trombone and a set of valves like a valve trombone.

== History ==
Trombones that combine both a slide with a set of valves were built as early as the 1860s by Besson. One of the earliest surviving examples was built by Conn in 1884, and closely resembles the modern superbone that appeared in the 1970s. Conn manufactured them through the early 20th century, and a similar instrument with a shorter four-position slide, the valide, was invented by jazz musician and machinist Brad Gowans in 1946.

The term &quot;superbone&quot; was first coined in the 1970s as a name for the instrument patented by Larry Ramirez of Holton Musical Instruments in collaboration with jazz trumpeter and bandleader Maynard Ferguson. It is very similar to the early Conn hybrid instruments from the 19th century, with a very narrow bore of and three piston valves. It has a slide lock, which frees the player to operate the valves or the slide with either hand, and was manufactured by Holton as the model TR-395 &quot;Superbone&quot; between 1974 and 2004.

The Holton became a staple instrument for Ferguson, and Don Ellis in his later career. Ferguson used the superbone on the recording &quot;Superbone Meets the Bad Man&quot; from the &quot;Chameleon&quot; album. Ashley Alexander, another proponent of the instrument, recorded &quot;Spring Can Really Hang You up the Most&quot; on his &quot;Secret Love&quot; album, which demonstrates the instrument&#x27;s flexibility. Alexander referred to the instrument as a &quot;double trombone&quot; and wrote a method for it, published by Leblanc in 1980.

=== Later developments ===
In the early 2010s James Morrison in conjunction with Austrian instrument manufacturer Schagerl created his own version of a superbone, employing a larger bore and three rotary valves operated by the left hand. This arrangement allows the player to use the valves and slide independently or simultaneously.
Wessex Tubas also manufacture a superbone with the same larger bore, but with three piston valves similar to the Holton.

== Construction ==
Superbones, unlike the valide, have a fully functioning trombone slide with the usual seven positions. The Holton and Wessex instruments are assembled from three detachable sections; the slide and bell sections attach to each end of the valve assembly, built with three piston valves arranged in the same manner as on other three-valved brass instruments. The player grips the valve section with the left hand, which supports the weight of the instrument while the right arm is free to operate the slide. The James Morrison Schagerl model has the two sections of a normal tenor trombone (slide and bell), with three rotary valves and their tubing incorporated in the bell section in a similar manner to F attachments.

Early superbones, and the Holton instrument designed for Ferguson (who was primarily a trumpet player), have very narrow almost trumpet-like bore diameters of less than . Later models from Schagerl and Wessex use a larger bore of found more commonly on modern tenor trombones.

== Technique ==
The Superbone can be played as a slide trombone, a valve trombone, or in combination. Using the slide and valves in combination requires the slide positions to be adjusted, just as when using the trigger of an F attachment on a tenor or bass trombone. Using the slide with the first and third valves engaged has the same effect as using an F attachment. Conversely, the valves can be used to provide trills and ornaments for passages played with the slide.

<text>West Midlands Fire Service (WMFS) is the fire and rescue service for the metropolitan county of West Midlands, England. The service has 38 fire stations, with a blended fleet of vehicles and specialist resources.

The service is led by a Chief Executive Officer who is overseen by the West Midlands Fire Authority. The Fire Authority is made up of 15 councillors who represent the seven councils within the West Midlands area.

&lt;mapframe latitude=&quot;52.484128&quot; longitude=&quot;-1.877759&quot; zoom=&quot;15&quot; width=&quot;273&quot; height=&quot;207&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;

The service&#x27;s headquarters is located in Nechells in Birmingham, which is also the home to Staffordshire and West Midlands Fire Control. The control room, based at WMFS headquarters is the main incident management and mobilising centre for both WMFS and Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service.

==History==
The service was created in 1974, when the West Midlands county came into being. Prior to its creation, each of the county boroughs in the West Midlands area (Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Solihull, Walsall, Warley, West Bromwich and Wolverhampton) had their own fire brigade, the largest of which was the City of Birmingham Fire Brigade. WMFS was created by a merger of these county borough fire brigades, plus fire stations rom the fire brigades of Warwickshire, Worcestershire and Staffordshire.

==Performance==
Every fire and rescue service in England and Wales is subjected to a periodic statutory inspection by His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS). The inspection investigates how well the service performs in each of three areas. On a scale of outstanding, good, requires improvement and inadequate, West Midlands Fire and Rescue Service has been rated as follows:
== Workstreams ==
The service divides its main functions into three areas: response, prevention and protection.

Response covers responding to emergencies, risk-based attendance standards, dynamic mobilising and Fire Control. Prevention covers their up-stream firefighting work that includes safe and well visits, community engagement, vulnerable persons officers and other individual and home-based fire prevention work. Protection covers their work around commercial and business fire safety, licensing and safety around buildings such as high-rise and apartment blocks.

==Chief fire officers==
The following people have held the office of chief fire officer:
*19741975: George Merrell (Chief officer of Birmingham Fire and Ambulance Service from 1969)
*19751981: Tom Lister
*19811990: Brian Fuller
*19901998: Graham Meldum
*19982003: Kenneth Knight
*20032008: Frank Sheehan
*20092013: Vijith Randeniya
*20142023: Phil Loach
*20232024: Wayne Brown
*2025Present: Simon Tuhill 

== Fire stations, appliances and rank structure ==
===Frontline Appliances===
The service currently uses the following frontline appliances
West Midlands Fire Service operates 38 fire stations and employs 1,350 firefighters.
It has no on-call retained firefighters. All fire stations within the service are full-time, and work on two types of shift:
* CORE – 10-hour day-shift, or 14-hour shift-night shift covered by four watches, comprising Red, White, Blue and Green
* LATE – 12-hour shift running from 10am to 10pm covered by two watches of Orange and Purple

Tettenhall is the only solely late crewed station.
Following the closure of the Birmingham Central fire station, Birmingham city centre is now covered by three fire stations: Aston located and covering the northern side, Highgate located and covering the southern, central and eastern sides, and Ladywood covering the western side.

WMFS currently operates a fleet of pump rescue ladders, technical rescue pumps, brigade response vehicles, aerial ladder platforms which are also referred to as Hydraulic platforms. WMFS also operate business support vehicles in addition to various specialist appliances and transport vehicles.

== Specialist units ==
=== Technical Rescue Unit ===
Operating out of three locations, a primary base at Bickenhill fire station and two other bases at Wednesbury and Sutton Coldfield fire stations, the WMFS Technical Rescue Unit has provides specialist rescue services such as rope and water rescue, dangerous buildings, and vehicle incidents involving trains and heavy goods vehicles.

===International search and rescue===
The United Kingdom International Search and Rescue Team (UK-ISAR) is on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year to respond to humanitarian accidents or disasters anywhere in the world. WMFS personnel are on call as UK-ISAR volunteers to respond to international incidents. 

Twelve members of the West Midlands team were deployed as part of the UKISAR (United Kingdom International Search And Rescue) mission to Haiti in the wake of the earthquake there on 12 January 2010. The team members were joined by two further members who had been in Sweden as part of a training exercise at the time of the earthquake. The team members were involved in the rescue of several people, including two-year-old Mia, who had been trapped for over four days.

===Fire Investigation and Prevention Section===
The Fire Investigation and Prevention Section (FIPS) investigates the cause of fire in a variety of different types of incidents including large fires, fires where the cause cannot be immediately determined, and fires where people may have been injured or died. FIPS works closely with the Police, other services, and organisations such as insurance companies when investigating fires.

The officers also work on special projects including arson reduction policies and strategies, human behaviour in fire, the main causes of fire, and the compilation of any information to identify trends in fire causes. This information is vital when undertaking targeted initiatives and campaigns relating to the education of fire safety awareness.

==Notable incidents==
* 2013 Smethwick fire – 35-pump fire, 50,000 tonnes of plastic and Jayplas plastics and paper recycling plant on fire, sparked by a Chinese lantern.

<text>A breath test is a type of test performed on air generated from the act of exhalation.

Types include:
*Breathalyzer – by far the most common usage of this term relates to the legal breath test to determine if a person is driving under the influence of alcohol.
*Hydrogen breath test – it is becoming more and more common for people to undertake a medical test for clinical diagnosis of dietary disabilities such as fructose intolerance, fructose malabsorption, lactose intolerance and lactulose intolerance. 
*The presence of &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; (in peptic ulcer disease) can be tested for with the urea breath test.
*Exhaled nitric oxide is a breath test that might signal airway inflammation such as in asthma.
*Breath tests for diseases have been developed for early detection of lung cancer, breast cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis and many others, to serve as an adjunct to existing medical tests. A trial will commence at Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital in Cambridge, England to confirm the efficacy of these breath tests. Phase II and Phase III clinical studies by Menssana Research, Inc. in the United States are also under way.

<text>47 Ursae Majoris (abbreviated 47 UMa), formally named Chalawan , is a yellow dwarf star approximately 45.3 light-years from Earth in the constellation of Ursa Major. , three extrasolar planets (designated 47 Ursae Majoris b, c and d; the first two later named Taphao Thong and Taphao Kaew) are believed to orbit the star.

The star is located fairly close to the Solar System: according to astrometric measurements made by the Gaia space observatory, it exhibits a parallax of 72.0070 milliarcseconds, corresponding to a distance of 45.30 light-years. With an apparent magnitude of +5.03, it is visible to the naked eye and its absolute magnitude of +4.29 implies a visual luminosity around 60% greater than the Sun. A solar analog, with a spectral type of G1V, it has a similar mass to that of the Sun but is slightly hotter at around 5,882 K. and slightly more metal-rich with around 110% of the solar abundance of iron.

Like the Sun, 47 Ursae Majoris is on the main sequence, converting hydrogen to helium in its core by nuclear fusion. Based on its chromospheric activity, the star may be around six billion years old, though evolutionary models suggest an older age of around 8.7 billion years. Other studies have yielded estimates of 4.4 and 7 billion years for the star. The low level of magnetic activity makes it a Maunder Minimum candidate star.

== Nomenclature ==
47 Ursae Majoris is the Flamsteed designation. On their discoveries the planets were successively designated 47 Ursau Majoris b, c and d.

In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names were Chalawan for this star and Taphao Thong and Taphao Kaew for two of the planets (b and c, respectively).
The winning names were submitted by the Thai Astronomical Society, Thailand. Chalawan ( ) is a mythological crocodile king from the Thai folktale Krai Thong and Taphaothong and Taphaokaeo are two sisters associated with the tale. (&#x27;Chalawan&#x27; is also the name given to an extinct genus of crocodylian. It contains a single species, &quot;Chalawan thailandicus&quot;.)

In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. In its first bulletin of July 2016, the WGSN explicitly recognized the names of exoplanets and their host stars approved by the Executive Committee Working Group Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites, including the names of stars adopted during the 2015 NameExoWorlds campaign. This star is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

== Planetary system ==
In 1996 an exoplanet (47 UMa b) was announced in orbit around 47 Ursae Majoris by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler. The discovery was made by observing the Doppler shift of the star&#x27;s spectrum corresponding to changes in the star&#x27;s radial velocity as the planet&#x27;s gravity pulled it around. The planet was the first long-period extrasolar planet discovered. Unlike the majority of known such planets, it has a low-eccentricity orbit. The planet is at least 2.53 times the mass of Jupiter and takes 1,078 days, or 2.95 years, to orbit its star. If it were to be located in the Solar System, it would lie between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

In 2001, preliminary astrometric measurements made by the Hipparcos probe suggested the orbit of 47 UMa b is inclined at an angle of 63.1° to the plane of the sky, implying the planet&#x27;s true mass is around 2.9 times that of Jupiter. However, subsequent analysis suggested the Hipparcos measurements were not precise enough to accurately determine the orbits of substellar companions, and the inclination and true mass remain unknown.

A second planet (47 UMa c) was announced in 2002 by Debra Fischer, Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler. The discovery was made using the same radial velocity method. According to Fischer et al., the planet takes around 2,391 days, or 6.55 years, to complete an orbit. This configuration is similar to the configuration of Jupiter and Saturn in the Solar System, with the orbital ratio (close to 5:2) and mass ratio roughly similar. Subsequent measurements failed to confirm the existence of the second planet, and it was noted that the dataset used to determine its existence left the planet&#x27;s parameters &quot;almost unconstrained&quot;. Analysis of a longer dataset spanning over 6,900 days suggests that while a second planet in the system is likely, periods near 2,500 days have a high false-alarm probability, and the best fit model gives an orbital period of 7,586 days at a distance of 7.73 AU from the star. Nevertheless, the parameters of the second planet are still highly uncertain. On the other hand, the Catalog of Nearby Exoplanets gives a period of 2,190 days, which would put the planets close to a 2:1 ratio of orbital periods, though the reference for these parameters is uncertain: the original Fischer &quot;et al.&quot; paper is cited as a reference in spite of the fact that it gives different parameters, though this solution has been adopted by the &quot;Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia&quot;.

In 2010, the discovery of a third planet (47 UMa d) was made by using the Bayesian Kepler Periodogram. Using this model of this planetary system it was determined that it is 100,000 times more likely to have three planets than two planets. This discovery was announced by Debra Fischer and P. C. Gregory. This planet has an orbital period of 14,002 days, or 38.33 years, and a semi-major axis of 11.6 AU with a moderate eccentricity of 0.16. It would be the longest-period planet discovered by the radial velocity method, although longer-period planets had previously been discovered by direct imaging and pulsar timing.

Simulations suggest that the inner part of the habitable zone of 47 Ursae Majoris could host a terrestrial planet in a stable orbit, though the outer regions of the habitable zone would be disrupted by the gravitational influence of the planet 47 UMa b. However, the presence of a giant planet within 2.5 AU of the star may have disrupted planet formation in the inner system, and reduced the amount of water delivered to inner planets during accretion. This may mean any terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zone of 47 Ursae Majoris are likely to be small and dry. , there have been two METI messages sent to 47 Ursae Majoris. Both were transmitted from Eurasia&#x27;s largest radar— Eupatoria Planetary Radar. The first message, the Teen Age Message, was sent on September 3, 2001, and it will arrive at 47 Ursae Majoris in July 2047. The second message, Cosmic Call 2, was sent on July 6, 2003, and it will arrive at 47 Ursau Majoris in May 2049.



Because of its planetary system, 47 Ursae Majoris was listed as one of the top 100 target stars for NASA&#x27;s former Terrestrial Planet Finder mission.

<text>Pasir Gudang is a city located in eastern Johor Bahru District, Johor, which is the second largest district in Malaysia by population. The main industries are transportation and logistics, shipbuilding, petrochemicals and other heavy industries, and oil palm storage and distribution, which is located in Johor Port and Tanjung Langsat.

==History==
Established in 1918, Pasir Gudang, which was formerly known as Kampung Pasir Udang, was founded by Long Abu who is believed to have originated from Riau, Indonesia. Four more villages were established by the expanded population of about 83 families.

*Kampung Pasir Gudang Baru. (known as Kampung Pasir Gudang Lama located at TNB Sultan Iskandar Power Station)
*Kampung Sungai Perembi. (currently the Pasir Gudang Police Station)
*Kampung Ulu (currently MSE dockyard)
*Kampung Tengah (currently the Tenaga Nasional area)
*Kampung Hilir.

In 1920, 4 more villages were established :

*Kampung Air Biru (now the port).
*Kampung Pasir Merah (now the port).
*Kampung Pasir Puteh, which is still in existence today.
*Kampung Pulau Tekong, now the territory of Singapore.

The name Pasir Gudang originated from the existence of a sand mine at Kampung Ulu. Sand or &#x27;pasir&#x27; in Malay are dug and stocked in sand pits/stores or &#x27;gudang&#x27; in Malay, to be exported to Singapore, hence the name &#x27;Pasir Gudang&#x27;.

The surrounding areas further inland were developed in the mid-19th century by Chinese travellers of the Teochew clan. Issuance of the &#x27;river deed&#x27; by the Sultan of Johore allowed them to develop the Kangkar Masai, Kangkar Plentong and Kangkar Lunchu areas under riverheads known as &#x27;kangchus&#x27;. It was on these riverbeds that they cultivated catechu and black pepper. Falling catechu and black pepper prices forced some estate owners to cultivate pineapples.

The introduction of rubber into Malaysia in the early 20th century resulted in the opening of big estates by the British and Singaporean cultivators. Up till 1916, six estates covering an area of 15,000 acres (61 km2) were opened in the Mukim of Plentong. In 1916, Kampung Pasir Gudang became the centre for Police, Customs and opium-control besides being a centre for the &#x27;penghulu&#x27; of the Mukim of Pasir Gudang. The formation of estates had also resulted in influx of labourers from China and India.

The Japanese occupation during the Second World War and guerrilla movements after the war did not have much effect on the agricultural activities here. Under the Emergency Law in the 1950s, new villages were set up at Plentong, Masai, Johor and Pasir Gudang. The estate labourers were either placed in these new villages or at guarded estate barracks.

Land schemes under the FELDA scheme were founded in Ban Foo, Plentong Baru and Felda Cahaya Baru after 1969. To further develop Johor, the State Government further took the estate lands to be converted into industrial and housing areas to the develop Pasir Gudang into an industrial area.

On 1 July 2008, Pasir Gudang Municipal Council () was established. On 22 November 2020, the municipal council was upgraded to Pasir Gudang City Council (}).

==Government==

Pasir Gudang is administered by the Pasir Gudang Local Authority, or Pihak Berkuasa Tempatan Pasir Gudang, a subsidiary of Johor Corporation. It is the first local authority in Malaysia that was privatised, although Johor Corporation is the investment arm of the Johor State Government.

On 1 July 2008, this city was granted municipal status and henceforth changed its name to Pasir Gudang Municipal Council. 

At 2015, the administration zone of Pasir Gudang Municipal Council was increase from 29,459.9ha to 31,732.24ha following the re-delineation exercise. This brought Masai and Bandar Seri Alam become a part of Pasir Gudang.

On 22 November 2020, it was granted the city status and henceforth changed its name to Pasir Gudang City Council. The title of leader of Pasir Gudang was also changed, as Mayor.

== Demographics ==
As of 2023, the area of Pasir Gudang has a population of 534,659.

The following is based on Department of Statistics Malaysia 2010 census.
==Economy==
The main economy sectors of the city are transportation, logistics, shipbuilding, petrochemicals and other heavy industries.

==Education==

The &quot;Politeknik Ibrahim Sultan&quot; (PIS), Pasir Gudang Community College, &quot;Institut Latihan Perindustrian Pasir Gudang&quot; and Johor Skills Development Centre (PUSPATRI) are the major higher institutes located at Pasir Gudang. Not only that, the “City of Knowledge”－Bandar Seri Alam houses a number of higher institutions including Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) campus, Universiti Kuala Lumpur (UniKL) campus, the Masterskill University College of Health Sciences campus and other international schools. The Foon Yew High School second branch (Bandar Seri Alam Campus) and the Lee Chong Wei Badminton Academy are still construction.

==Transportation==
===Sea===
The town consists of two ports, which are Tanjung Langsat Port and Johor Port. Johor Port is one of the country&#x27;s most important seaports for commodities and mineral resources shipping, as Johor is home to a large number of major commercial plantations. The port is also the location of the majority of Malaysia&#x27;s resources refineries.

The Pasir Gudang Ferry Terminal is also located in Pasir Gudang and has passenger ferry services to Batam in the Riau Islands Province of Indonesia.

<doc id="1197746" wikidata="Q5666416" url="?curid=1197746" title="Harrogate line">
<text>The Harrogate line is a passenger rail line through parts of North Yorkshire and the West Yorkshire area of northern England connecting Leeds to York by way of Harrogate and Knaresborough. Service on the line is operated by Northern, with a few additional workings by London North Eastern Railway starting and terminating at Harrogate. West Yorkshire Metro&#x27;s bus and rail &quot;MetroCard&quot; ticket is available for journeys between Leeds and Harrogate.

==Route==

===History===
The routes over which the Harrogate line trains now run were opened in 1848 by two of the railways which came to be part of the North Eastern Railway: the &quot;Leeds Northern Railway&quot; and the &quot;East and West Yorkshire Junction Railway&quot;. At the time of the 1923 Grouping the Harrogate area formed the junction for five routes: the main line was that of the Leeds-Northallerton railway; the other lines were to:
* Pateley Bridge;
* Pilmoor on the East Coast Main Line, the junction for the line to York (the only remaining section open)
* Wetherby, the junction with the Cross Gates–Wetherby line;
* Church Fenton, terminus of the Harrogate–Church Fenton line
The Leeds station at the time was &quot;Leeds Central station&quot;, jointly owned by the NER and the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway.

The line terminated in Harrogate at the Brunswick station which was opened in 1848 but closed in 1862 when a new and more central station was opened.

===Description===

The line is composed of all or part of the following Network Rail routes:

* LNE 9 from Leeds to Leeds West Junction
* LNE 6A from Leeds West Junction

* LNE 6 from Harrogate

* LNE 2 from Skelton Junction to York

====Stations and features====
Currently open stations are shown in bold font.

* Leeds is a major transport hub where several long-distance and commuter lines meet. Trains scheduled to operate via Harrogate to York are shown with the destination of &quot;Poppleton via Harrogate&quot; because the Leeds-York journey via this route takes 40 minutes longer than on the route of the York and Selby Lines via Garforth.
* Royal Gardens, only a short distance from Burley Park, was closed in 1858.
* Cardigan Road Goods station is closed and now the site of a builders yard.
* Burley Park opened in 1988.
* Headingley near Kirkstall Lane (B6157 road) is the closest station to the Kirkstall Lane end of Headingley Stadium.
* Horsforth Woodside was located near Leeds Outer Ring Road, today&#x27;s A6120, and closed in 1864. Opening of a new station here has been discussed on several occasions.
* Horsforth is physically the closest railway station to Leeds &amp; Bradford Airport, though no direct public transport link currently exists between Horsforth station and the Airport terminal. The closest railway station with a bus link is Guiseley on the busier electrified Wharfedale Line.

* Bramhope Tunnel with a length of 2 miles 220 yd (3418 m) is the longest tunnel on the historic NER system.
* Arthington was a triangular junction for the line to Otley. Both station and branch are now closed. Plans to reopen the station as a park and ride facility for Pool-in Wharfedale have been mooted by campaigners, but both Otley Town Council and West Yorkshire Metro state that the local road network could not support a park and ride facility.
* Arthington Viaduct
* Weeton serves Huby, Weeton and Otley.
* Pannal serves Pannal, Burn Bridge and Spacey Houses.
* The line climbs and turns sharply, passing the junction with the former Harrogate–Church Fenton line where the short-lived Crimple station was located, and crosses &quot;Crimple Valley Viaduct&quot;, under which the original main line passed en route to Starbeck. The course of this section (closed in 1951) can be seen from the viaduct.
* Hornbeam Park serves the southern parts of Harrogate, Oatlands and is also the closest station to the Great Yorkshire Showground. It opened in 1992, making it the newest station on the line.
* Harrogate is also served by trains to and from London every 2 hours. The bus station is immediately adjacent.
* Starbeck serves Starbeck and Woodlands. Here were the junctions for the former Nidd Valley Railway to Pateley Bridge and the line to Ripon and Northallerton.
* The line crosses the River Nidd on a four-arch stone viaduct.
* Knaresborough is near Knaresborough High Street (the A59). Here the line to Pilmoor branched off. Most of the line between Knaresborough and York was singled in the 1980s. However, the track between Cattal and Hammerton stations remains double track and functions as a passing loop. The line between Poppleton &amp; York is also double.
* Goldsborough closed to passengers in 1958 and to freight in 1965.
* Hopperton closed to passengers in 1958 and to freight in 1962.
* Cattal serves Cattal, Whixley and Green Hammerton.
* Hammerton serves Green Hammerton and Kirk Hammerton.
* Wilstrop Siding served Copmanthorpe and closed to passengers in 1931, to freight in 1964.
* Marston Moor which served Long Marston closed to passengers in 1958, to freight in 1965 and to parcels in 1967.
* Hessay closed to passengers in 1958 and to freight in 1964.
* Poppleton serves Upper Poppleton and Nether Poppleton.
* York is also served by the East Coast Main Line and by the York and Selby Lines and the Dearne Valley line, trains on the latter two being operated by Northern. At York station, trains travelling to Leeds via Harrogate are shown with the destination of Burley Park as the route takes 40 mins longer via Harrogate.

===Special services===
In addition to the regular services on the Harrogate line, there is occasionally an increased service which runs prior to and after a major event on at Headingley Stadium such as an international cricket test match. The services run between Leeds and Horsforth stations to cater for a large usage at Headingley and Burley Park railway stations, and tickets are sold by Revenue Protection staff at the entrances to the platforms. This is to reduce the queue for tickets at Leeds station. Extra services have also been run on the Harrogate line for the Great Yorkshire Show.

In July 2014, the Tour de France Grand Depart 2014 was held in Yorkshire with stage 1 from Leeds to Harrogate and thousands of spectators were expected. Extra trains were operated in this occasion. In addition to the local trains which were run at increased capacity, two locomotive hauled services ran between Leeds and Harrogate during the day. Passengers wishing to travel between the depart at Leeds and first day finishing at Harrogate were required to wait separately outside Leeds station rather than proceed through the barriers, given the limited capacity through the station.

===Trains===

The route is served by Northern Trains rolling stock; the most common seen on the line is the Class 170 &quot;Turbostar&quot;, and Class 150 Sprinters, Class 155 Super Sprinters and Class 158 Express Sprinters often make appearances on the line as well. London North Eastern Railway services use the Class 800 &quot;Azuma&quot;.

==Future==
In July 2011, Harrogate Chamber of Commerce proposed electrifying the line with 750 V DC third rail, using D Stock of the London Underground, to substantially increase capacity. The D stock&#x27;s replacement by S Stock on the District line in 2015 has made them available for other locations. It is proposed that the stock will be converted to use the bottom-contact third rail system. The scheme never gained support from Metro, Northern Rail or National Rail, generally overhead electrification is favoured and is the only method used in the region. Furthermore, the D stock is older than current stock using the line and runs on a fourth rail system, although D Stock units have successfully been converted to 3rd rail operation as Class 484s.

Several new stations have also been proposed, including at Flaxby and Knaresborough East. In November 2013 &quot;Rail Magazine&quot; reported on plans for the line to be electrified at 25 kV AC overhead power lines which could be in use by 2019. This would mean that there would be two electric lines to York from Leeds, the other being Leeds to York via Cross Gates which will soon be electrified.

On 5 March 2015, the Harrogate line, amongst others in the area including the Leeds–Bradford Interchange–Halifax line, the Selby–Hull line and the Northallerton–Middlesbrough line were named top priority for electrification; with an estimated cost for the Harrogate line of £93 million with a projected cost-benefit ratio of 1/3.60. No date has been set however.

From December 2017, additional services on Sundays began with an extra hourly service from Leeds to Knaresborough during the day. This means trains between Knaresborough/Harrogate and Leeds are now every 30 minutes during the daytime on Sundays. Funding has been secured for signalling and infrastructure upgrades on the section of line between Knaresborough and York. This will allow an enhanced passenger service of two trains per hour. However, the proposal to re-open railway station to serve a new housing estate, would jeopardise reliable timings on the train service. The £13 million scheme will be carried out over the summer and autumn of 2020 with improved signalling. This will allow two services an hour between York, Knaresborough and Harrogate.

In December 2019, London North Eastern Railway (LNER), intend to increase their one train a day, between Harrogate and London King&#x27;s Cross, to six trains each way per day, including weekends. The service will be suitable for an increase in service pattern due to LNER using its bi-mode class 800 Azuma trains that would have previously terminated at Leeds. A siding at the northern end of Harrogate station has been brought back into use to enable the trains to reverse direction.

Since 1 March 2020 services have been directly operated by the Department for Transport (DfT) under the brand name Northern Trains, with an objective of &quot;stabilising performance and restoring reliability for passengers&quot;.

==The Line to Ripon==

The city was previously served by Ripon railway station on the Leeds–Northallerton line that ran between Leeds and Northallerton. It was once part of the North Eastern Railway and then LNER.

The Ripon line was closed to passengers on 6 March 1967 and to freight on 5 September 1969 as part of the wider Beeching Axe, despite a vigorous campaign by local campaigners, including the city&#x27;s MP. Today much of the route of the line through the city is now a relief road and although the former station still stands, it is now surrounded by a new housing development. The issue remains a significant one in local politics and there are movements wanting to restore the line. Reports suggest the reopening of a line between Ripon and Harrogate railway station would be economically viable, costing £40 million and could initially attract 1,200 passengers a day, rising to 2,700. Campaigners call on MPs to restore Ripon railway link.

In the former North Yorkshire County Council&#x27;s &#x27;A Strategic Transport Prospectus for North Yorkshire&#x27;, they propose to build an entirely new railway between Leeds, Harrogate and Ripon which would have a junction with the East Coast Main Line north of Northallerton station. This would enable running, reduce journey times and provide an alternative route when the current Leeds to York to Northallerton section is closed.

<text>Styphnic acid (from Greek &quot;stryphnos&quot; &quot;astringent&quot;), or 2,4,6-trinitro-1,3-benzenediol, is a yellow astringent acid that forms hexagonal crystals. It is used in the manufacture of dyes, pigments, inks, medicines, and explosives such as lead styphnate. It is itself a low-sensitivity explosive, similar to picric acid, but explodes upon rapid heating.

== History ==
It was discovered in 1808 by Michel Eugène Chevreul who was researching ways of producing colorants from tropical logwoods. Upon boiling Pernambuco wood extract with nitric acid he filtered crystals understood to be styphnic acid in an impure form. In mid-1840s chemists purified and systematically studied the substance with Rudolf Christian Böttger and Heinrich Will giving its modern name, while in 1871 J. Schreder proved that it&#x27;s trinitroresorcinol.

==Preparation and chemistry==
It may be prepared by the nitration of resorcinol with a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acid.

This compound is an example of a trinitrophenol.

Like picric acid, it is a moderately strong acid, capable of displacing carbon dioxide from solutions of sodium carbonate, for example.

It may be reacted with weakly basic oxides, such as those of lead and silver, to form the corresponding salts.

The solubility of picric acid and styphnic acid in water is less than their corresponding mono- and di-nitro compounds, and far less than their non-nitrated precursor phenols, so they may be purified by fractional crystallisation.

<text>TV Cream was a British television nostalgia website, which had expanded to cover not only television, but film, toys, books, and other objects. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called it &quot;a labour of love&quot; and praised &quot;the standard of the writing&quot;. In 2003, it was amongst the nominees for Yahoo! UK &amp; Ireland as best comedy website. Its sister website &quot;Off The Telly&quot; offered more serious insight into television. &quot;Off The Telly&quot; ceased producing new content in 2010, but its archive remained available, latterly hosted within TV Cream, until 2024.

==History==
The site originally appeared as &quot;The Arkhive&quot; on 31 August 1997, before adopting its current name the following year. Founded by Phil Norman, the site mainly reviews hundreds of programmes shown on British television (but not necessarily made in the UK), during the 1970s and 1980s, though some earlier and later shows are also featured. The site also features a selection of nostalgia-based articles relating to areas of popular culture such as pop music, film, comics, and so on. 

Site writers included Steve Berry, Chris Diamond, Chris Hughes, Ian Jones, Graham and Jack Kibble-White, Suzy Norman, Jill Phythian, Matthew Rudd, Ian Tomkinson, Simon Tyers, Steve Williams and TJ (Tim) Worthington. Some contributors were also involved with &quot;Off the Telly&quot;, worked in journalism and/or wrote books. Graham Kibble-White wrote for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and Jill Phythian appeared as a talking-head on TV list shows.

TV Cream also operated email lists; as at 2024 these were &quot;Creamguide&quot;, which provides subscribers with a weekly mailout listing forthcoming TV programmes of interest, and &quot;Why Don&#x27;t YouTube?&quot;, a weekly Substack mailing compiling clips of archive TV material from that week in history, sourced via YouTube. The latter mailing grew from a feature which had run in text form in some editions of the defunct &quot;Creamup&quot; (TV Cream Update), a monthly digest of features (distributed via a Yahoo! Group) which had largely ceased regular publication by the end of the 00s; a final &quot;Creamup&quot;, composed of new and reused material, was distributed via the &quot;Creamguide&quot; mailing list on the day TV Cream&#x27;s closure was announced. 

On 31 August 2024, the website announced its shutdown on 19 September, due to increasingly infrequent edits in recent years and increased server costs. &quot;Creamguide&quot; and &quot;Why Don&#x27;t YouTube?&quot; mailings continue. 

==Publications==
The website and its contributors have produced a number of spin-off books, some marketed as TV Cream tie-ins, others individual projects by writers:

===Official TV Cream books===

<text>The Long and the Short and the Tall (released as Jungle Fighters in the US and Canada) is a 1961 British war film directed by Leslie Norman and starring Richard Todd, Laurence Harvey and Richard Harris. The film, which is based on a 1959 play with the same name, by Willis Hall, takes place in 1942 during the Malayan Campaign.

The title comes from the second line of the First World War song &quot;Bless &#x27;Em All&quot;, which became very popular during the Second World War following recordings from singers such as Vera Lynn.

== Plot ==
During the Japanese invasion of Burma in 1942, a seven-strong British sonic deception unit on a short jungle exercise hides from the rain in a hut at an abandoned tin mine. The men constantly bicker, often provoked by the bullying Corporal Johnstone or the forever mocking Bamforth. While Sergeant Mitchem and Corporal Johnstone are reconnoitering, Lance-Corporal Macleish (&quot;Mac&quot;), provoked, beats up Bamforth. Tension rises as they fail to make radio contact with their base and pick up a Japanese broadcast, indicating that they are nearby. A Japanese scout appears: Johnstone grabs him and tells Taff to stab him. Taff cannot kill him in cold blood and, before Bamforth does, the returning Mitchem says they must take him back for interrogation.

Mitchem places Bamforth in charge of the prisoner, who Bamforth names Tojo. Bamforth realises Tojo is just another soldier, bonding over pictures of Tojo&#x27;s family. Johnstone, enraged, tries to destroy the pictures but Bamforth, his frustrations boiling over, beats him up, risking a court martial. Mitchem sends Mac and Smudge to reconnoiter. They see a small patrol sending two soldiers to find Tojo. Knowing this endangers their patrol, Mac kills one but the other escapes. Mac and Smudge return to warn the patrol which tries to radio base to warn them, even though it may reveal their position. A taunting Japanese broadcast accelerates their decision to flee for their base.

They head for home. Mitchem now realises that the prisoner is a liability rather than as asset and Johnstone keeps offering to kill him. The group, temporararily blocked by a flash flood, take a break in the mine canyons and Bamforth is sent to keep watch. Johnstone spots Mac and Tojo enjoying a cigarette, and cruelly points out that the cigarettes are British, and Tojo must have stolen them from a British soldier he had killed. This affects the men who turn on Tojo. Johnstone sadistically rips up Tojo&#x27;s cherished family photos and Mac searches and slaps him. Upon hearing the commotion, Bamforth returns and explains he gave Tojo the cigarettes. The men are ashamed and try to make amends by gathering and returning Tojo&#x27;s possessions. Johnstone maliciously says that Tojo&#x27;s cigarette case was made in Birmingham. As the men again grow hostile, Bamford responds that Tojo could have traded for it, forcing the youngest member (Whittaker) to admit that he does this.

The flood is receding and Mitchem asks Whittaker to make a last attempt to contact base before they leave. They plan to abandon the mules, blow up the special equipment and kill the prisoner Tojo. Bamforth is alone in protesting against killing Tojo and appeals for support from the other men without success. The radio responds to Whittaker&#x27;s efforts but only a Japanese message can be heard. Tojo approaches him, trying in Japanese to explain the message. Panicking about the Japanese broadcast and ashamed from his unveiling as a looter, Whittaker mistakes Tojo&#x27;s movements and shoots him dead with a machine gun. The radio crackles into life again and a Japanese accented English announces that the patrol is surrounded and demands their surrender. Whittaker&#x27;s firing will have further alerted the Japanese.

Mitchem with Bamforth forms a rear guard to allow the others led by Johnstone to escape. The rear guard are soon defending against the main Japanese force. As the main group emerge, a Japanese sniper dispatches Taff and Mac. Although Whittaker is cut off, Johnstone tells Smudge they must return to Mitchem. As they flee, Smudge is also killed.

Mitchem is shocked to see the superficially injured Johnstone back alone but is shot by a sniper. As the Japanese close in, Johnstone implores Bamforth to surrender. Bamforth however shoots at the explosives. The explosion kills many attackers but also causes a rockfall, killing Bamforth. Johnstone strides forward and, taking a white scarf from a dead Japanese soldier, surrenders. Whittaker is found cowering under a bush by Japanese soldiers and is also taken by the Japanese and is shouted at and mocked just as the British treated Tojo.

==Production==
Roy Ward Baker wanted to make the film at Rank but the company would not authorise the purchase of the rights. Associated British bought the film rights in April 1959 and assigned the role of the sergeant to Richard Todd. The movie was a co production between Associated British and Michael Balcon Productions Ltd - it was the first movie Balcon made since he left Ealing Studios.

According to Todd filming was postponed. The actor was disappointed with the script, Norman&#x27;s plan to film in a studio and the decision to not cast Peter O&#x27;Toole. He wrote in his memoirs, &quot;Leslie was a nice chap, but seemed rather indecisive and insecure.&quot;

The film was shot at Elstree Studios in 1960, where Richard Todd had starred in &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; a few years earlier. Todd loathed making the film, as he didn&#x27;t get along with Laurence Harvey, In an interview many years later, he said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t enjoy working with Laurence Harvey... I took it for granted that they would cast Peter O&#x27;Toole, who was marvellous on stage, but they said they wanted a &#x27;name&#x27;&quot;. He said it &quot;was the most unpleasant film I ever worked on&quot; blaming Harvey in particular for causing trouble; he said Harvey was a poor influence on Richard Harris, and that Leslie Norman was unable to control either, but that Harris&#x27; behaviour improved after Todd had a word with him.

Richard Harris later claimed Todd would stand on top of mounds of dirt to seem as tall as his co-stars. Leslie Norman was also unhappy he had to cast Laurence Harvey instead of Peter O&#x27;Toole. He felt Laurence Harvey and Richard Harris &quot;let the film down... Harris because he resented Laurence Harvey, despised him and they didn&#x27;t get on with Richard Todd&quot;. Norman says &quot;I was very pleased with my side of the film in the end. It was all made in a studio, we never set foot outside for a month. I asked to go on location, but a jungle&#x27;s pretty claustrophobic, for sure&quot;.

<doc id="1197758" wikidata="Q10726982" url="?curid=1197758" title="Viking revival">
<text>The Viking revival was a movement reflecting new interest in, and appreciation for Viking medieval history and culture. Interest was reawakened in the late 18th and 19th centuries, often with added heroic overtones typical of that Romantic era.

The revival began earlier with historical discoveries and early modern publications dealing with Old Norse culture. The first printed edition of the 13th-century &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; or the &quot;Legend of the Danes&quot; by Saxo Grammaticus, came out in 1514 just as book printing began become more practical and printing trade was quickly spreading. Olaus Magnus&#x27;s &quot;Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus&quot;, or &quot;History of the northern peoples&quot;, was printed in 1555. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the famous Edda, notably Peder Resen&#x27;s &quot;Edda Islandorum&quot; of 1665. The Edda consisted of two 13th-century Medieval Icelandic literary works on Norse mythology, written down in the 13th century, but certainly from older oral sources: they are the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, and an older collection of poems without an original title now known as the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. The books are the main sources of medieval skaldic tradition of poetry and storytelling in Iceland and Norse mythology.

The word &quot;Viking&quot; is not a medieval term and was introduced into Modern English only during the 18th century. At that point in the Romantic Era, Viking exploits were aggregated and tended to be falsely subsumed under a single category and subsequently romanticized as heroic adventure. Etymologists frequently trace the word &quot;Viking&quot; to writers who are referring to those who set about to raid and pillage. The word &quot;Viking&quot; in the sense in which it is commonly used is derived from the Old Norse &quot;víkingr&quot; signifying a sea-rover or pirate. Thus, a modern understanding of &quot;Viking&quot; history is shaped by the views of the people of the Romantic era, who studied and wrote about &quot;the Vikings&quot; as seen from their point of view.

==Norway==
The rediscovery of the Viking past began in Norway during the 19th century when Norway saw a rise in nationalism. Having been in a personal union with Denmark under the Danish king for 400 years and subsequently in the union between Sweden and Norway under the Swedish king, Norwegians started looking back to their Viking Age kings and sagas. In 1867, the first Viking ship to be unearthed, the Tune ship, was excavated in Østfold, Norway. The ship provided new knowledge about the Vikings and their culture. The excavation of other ships and artifacts led to a higher consciousness about the Viking past in Norway. For example, the only complete Viking helmet, the Gjermundbu helmet, ever to be found was also excavated in Buskerud, Norway.

==Denmark==
Danish antiquarian Carl Christian Rafn was noted for his early advocacy of the theory that the Vikings had explored North America centuries before Christopher Columbus&#x27;s and John Cabot&#x27;s voyages. Rafn published much of his work in 1837 in the &quot;Antiquitates Americanæ&quot;, considered the first scholarly exposition of the Old Norse exploration period.

==Sweden==
The term Viking was popularized with positive connotations by Erik Gustaf Geijer at the beginning of the 19th century. His poem &quot;The Viking&quot; (&quot;Vikingen&quot;) appeared in the first issue of the Swedish periodical, &quot;Iduna&quot;. The word Viking was taken to refer to romanticized, heroic, idealized Norse seafarers and warriors. This renewed interest of the Romanticism of a historic past had political implications. The Geatish Society, of which Geijer was a member, popularized this ideal to a great extent. Another author who had great influence on the perception of the Vikings was Esaias Tegnér, another member of the Geatish Society who wrote a modern version of &quot;Frithiof&#x27;s Saga&quot;, which became widely popular in the Nordic countries, England, the United States, and Germany.

==Germany==
The German composer Richard Wagner is said to have strong influences of the Nordic mythology in his musical pieces. His Nordic influences further enhanced the Romanticism of the Viking era during that time. Wagner&#x27;s Der Ring des Nibelungen, commonly referred to as the Ring cycle, is a set of four operas based loosely on figures and elements of Germanic mythology—particularly from the later Norse mythology—notably the Old Norse &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and &quot;Volsunga Saga&quot;, and the epic poem &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;.

==Britain==
English authors from the 16th century had been aware of the Viking impact on the countryside, though the numerous placenames of &quot;Danes Camp&quot; is better explained as a modification of &quot;dene&quot;, or hollow. Following the 17th-century first flowering of Anglo-Saxon studies, there was a similar wave of enthusiasm for Northern culture in Britain, identifying as Viking remains Iron Age hill forts and even Stonehenge and exemplified by the antiquarian interests of George Hickes, who published a &quot;Linguarum veterum septentrionalium thesaurus grammatico-criticus et archæologicus&quot; in 1703–05. In the 1780s, Denmark offered to cede Iceland to Britain in exchange for Crab Island (now Vieques, Puerto Rico), and in the 1860s Iceland was considered for compensation for the British support of Denmark in the Schleswig-Holstein conflicts. During this time, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland and Nordic culture grew dramatically, expressed in original English poems extolling Viking virtues, such as Thomas Warton&#x27;s &quot;Runic Odes&quot; of 1748:

:&quot;Yes – &#x27;tis decreed my Sword no more&quot;
:&quot;Shall smoke and blush with hostile gore&quot;
:&quot;To my great Father&#x27;s Feasts I go,&quot;
:&quot;Where luscious Wines for ever flow.&quot;
:&quot;Which from the hollow Sculls we drain&quot;
:&quot;Of Kings in furious Combat slain.&quot;

==United States==
Rasmus B. Anderson, the founding head of the Department of Scandinavian Studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, also founded a publication company, The Norrœna Society, which focused on republishing translations of texts devoted to the history and romance of Northern Europe. Anderson was the author of a number of books with Scandinavian themes. He brought to the American popular attention the idea that Viking explorers discovered the New World and was the originator of Leif Erikson Day.

<text>Canons Ashby Priory was an Augustinian priory at Canons Ashby, Northamptonshire, England.
==History==
The Priory was founded by Stephen la Leye on a site to the south of the present church between 1147 and 1151 in the reign of Henry II.

In 1253 the Augustinians were granted a licence to dig the Norwell, which still exists north of the present church, to supply water to the priory.

In 1452, John Nantewych is named as the prior of Canons Assheby. 

In 1537 after the Dissolution of the Monasteries the Crown granted the priory and its estates to Sir Francis Bryan, a close ally of Henry VIII. Bryan held the estate for only about a year before selling it in 1538 to Sir John Cope, a wealthy Banbury lawyer. Sir John&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth inherited what is thought to have been the priory farmhouse [wrong – Wilkyns farm was part of John Dryden&#x27;s inheritance. Copes Ashbie – across the road – was inherited by Elizabeth&#x27;s brother, who died early leaving his sons as Wards of the Dryden family] . In 1551 she married John Dryden, who extended the building to form the earliest parts of Canons Ashby House.

Part of the building survives: the Church of England parish church of St Mary dates from about 1250 and this, together with Canons Ashby House, is now owned by the National Trust. Its power and size can be judged by its outlying buildings which cover a large area of the surrounding countryside. The remains of the priory&#x27;s &quot;hospitalium&quot; survive as the monastic building centred on the parish church of Maidford, about away.

==Burials==
*Sir Erasmus Dryden, 1st Baronet and other members of his family
*Sir John Dryden, 2nd Baronet
*Sir Robert Dryden, 3rd Baronet (c. 1638–1708)
*Sir Erasmus Henry Dryden, 5th Baronet

<doc id="1197767" wikidata="Q24568869" url="?curid=1197767" title="Thermal interface material">
<text>A thermal interface material (shortened to TIM) is any material that is inserted between two components in order to enhance the thermal coupling between them. A common use is heat dissipation, in which the TIM is inserted between a heat-producing device (e.g. an integrated circuit) and a heat-dissipating device (e.g. a heat sink). There are intensive studies in developing several kinds of TIM with different target applications. At each interface, a thermal resistance exists and impedes heat dissipation. In addition, the electronic performance and device lifetime can degrade dramatically under continuous overheating and large thermal stress at the interfaces. 

Many recent efforts have been dedicated to developing and improving TIMs: These effort include minimizing the thermal boundary resistance between layers and enhancing thermal management performance, while addressing application requirements such as low thermal stress between materials of different thermal expansion coefficients, low elastic modulus or viscosity, as well as ensuring flexibility and reusability.

*Thermal paste: Mostly used in the electronics industry, thermal pastes provide a very thin bond line and therefore a very small thermal resistance. They have no mechanical strength (other than the surface tension of the paste and the resulting adhesive effect) and require an external mechanical fixation mechanism. Because they do not cure, thermal pastes are typically only used where the material can be contained, or in thin applications where the viscosity of the paste will allow it to stay in position during use.
*Thermal adhesive: As with thermal pastes, thermal adhesives provide a very thin bond line, but provide additional mechanical strength to the bond after curing. While curing TIMs like thermal adhesives may be used outside of a semiconductor package, often they are used in inside of a thermal package, as their curing properties can improve reliability over different thermal stresses. Thermal adhesives come in both single-part formulations as well as two-part formulations, often containing additives to improve thermal conductivity, including solid fillers (metal oxides, carbon black, carbon nanotubes, etc.), or liquid metal droplets.
*Thermal gap filler: This could be described as &quot;curing thermal paste&quot; or &quot;non-adhesive thermal glue&quot;. It provides thicker bond lines than the thermal paste, as it cures while still allowing an easy disassembly, thanks to limited adhesiveness.
*Thermally conductive pad: As opposed to previous TIMs that come in a fluidic form, thermal pads are manufactured and used in a solid state (albeit often soft). Mostly made of silicone or silicone-like material, thermal pads have the advantage of being easy to apply. They provide thicker bond lines (ranging in thickness from larger than a few hundred μm to a few mm) to accommodate non-flat interfaces and even multi-component interfaces, but will usually need higher force to press the heat sink onto the heat source, so that the thermal pad conforms to the bonded surfaces.
*Thermal tape: These materials adhere to the bonded surfaces, require no curing time, they are easy to apply. Similar to thermal pads, they are typically shipped in a solid but flexible form and come in a variety of thicknesses larger than a few hundred μm.
*Phase-change materials (PCM): Naturally sticky materials, used in place of thermal pastes. Its application is similar to solid pads. After achieving a melting point of 55–60 degrees, it changes to a half-liquid status and fills all gaps between the heat source and the heat sink.
*Metal thermal interface materials (metal TIMs): Metallic materials offer substantially higher bulk thermal conductivity as well as the lowest thermal interface resistance. This high conductivity translates to less sensitivity to bondline thicknesses and coplanarity issues than polymeric TIMs. Common metals used as TIMs include the relatively soft and compliant indium alloys, as well as sintered silver.

<doc id="1197785" wikidata="Q494894" url="?curid=1197785" title="Kanmon Straits">
<text>The or the Straits of Shimonoseki is the stretch of water separating Honshu and Kyushu, two of Japan&#x27;s four main islands. On the Honshu side of the strait is Shimonoseki (, which contributed &quot;Kan&quot; () to the name of the strait) and on the Kyushu side is Kitakyushu, whose former city and present ward, Moji (), gave the strait its &quot;mon&quot; (). The straits silt up at the rate of about 15 centimetres per annum, and dredging has made it possible to build the Kitakyushu Airport at low cost.

Western maps from the 19th century also refer to this waterway as the Straits of Van der Capellen.

==Population of Kanmon area==

The total population of the Kanmon area is about 1.3 million, counting the whole of Kitakyushu (approx. one million) and Shimonoseki (approx. 300,000), although detailed definitions vary widely (see Fukuoka–Kitakyushu). 

==Tourism==
*Fireworks festival
The Kanmon Straits Summer Fireworks Festival is held in August every year.
*Boat rides
The Voyager pleasure boat departs from Moji-kō and cruises the straits.
*Helicopter and airship flights
Helicopter joyrides are available from Kaikyo Dramaship in Moji-kō.
In October 2005, one of the world&#x27;s largest airships currently flying (a Zeppelin NT imported from Germany) also passed through Moji on an all-Japan tour. This airship was purchased by Nippon Airship Corporation in June 2004 and was used in the Tokyo area and at the Aichi Expo 2005.

==Transportation across the Straits==
The Kanmon Straits can be crossed in a number of ways, the oldest of which are the ferries. There is a car ferry between Nishiminato (Kokura) and Hikinoshima (Shimonoseki) which takes about ten minutes, and a passenger ferry from Moji-ko to Shimonoseki (Karato wharf). There is also a bridge which carries an expressway. By far the most used method is a number of Kanmon Tunnels which carry the Sanyō Shinkansen, trains, cars, and even one for pedestrians at the narrowest point.

The first railway tunnel was opened on November 15, 1942. The highway tunnel was opened on March 9, 1958. The Kanmonkyo Bridge (see photo) was opened to vehicles on November 14, 1973. The Shinkansen tunnel was opened on March 10, 1975.

==Commercial importance==
The Kanmon straits is also the connection between the Sea of Japan and the Inland Sea. It is used by many cargo ships as a shortcut to Osaka and Tokyo from Korea and China. The New Kitakyushu Airport is also nearby.

==Historical significance==
* Battle of Dan-no-ura
* Battle of Shimonoseki Straits
* Bombardment of Shimonoseki
* Treaty of Shimonoseki

== Transportation ==
The New Kitakyushu Airport opened in Kitakyushu on March 16, 2006, and is expected to bring further prosperity in the form of increased tourism and trade to the area.

Ferries from Shimonoseki Port International Terminal:
*The Kanpu ferry to Busan in South Korea
*The Orient ferry to Qingdao in China
*The Orient ferry to Shanghai in China

<doc id="1197794" wikidata="Q472404" url="?curid=1197794" title="Dennis Stratton">
<text>Dennis Stratton (born 9 October 1952) is an English guitarist best known as a member of the heavy metal band Iron Maiden from December 1979 to October 1980. He was also the lead guitarist and occasional lead vocalist of Praying Mantis from 1990 to 2006, recording six studio albums with the band.

==Career==
Born in Canning Town, London, Stratton showed early promise as a footballer and was briefly on the books at West Ham United until age 16, when he took up guitar. He joined his first band Harvest (later known as Wedgewood) in 1973. Two years later, Stratton formed the band Remus Down Boulevard, which toured in support of Rory Gallagher and Status Quo, and recorded a live album with music producer Jonathan King.

In December 1979, Steve Harris invited Stratton to join Iron Maiden after witnessing a Remus Down Boulevard performance. The band was also in need of a new drummer, and recruited Clive Burr on Stratton&#x27;s recommendation. Stratton played on the group&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;Iron Maiden&quot;, which was released in April 1980, and on the non-album single &quot;Women in Uniform&quot;. Stratton also appeared in the home video recording &quot;Live at the Ruskin&quot; (recorded in 1980 and released in 2004 as part of &quot;The History of Iron Maiden – Part 1: The Early Days&quot; DVD set), and in the band&#x27;s first British television appearance, when they performed &quot;Running Free&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Stratton was with the band during their first European tour, supporting Kiss.

Dennis Stratton left Iron Maiden in October 1980, and has stated that he left due to conflicts with Steve Harris and band manager Rod Smallwood. Officially, the band stated &quot;musical differences&quot; as the reason for Stratton&#x27;s departure. He was replaced by Adrian Smith. After his departure from Iron Maiden, Stratton played with bands such as Lionheart and Praying Mantis, with which he recorded six studio albums from 1990 to 2003. He officially left Praying Mantis in 2006. In 1995 he formed a project called The Original Iron Men with another former Iron Maiden member, singer Paul Di&#x27;Anno. The duo released three albums. More recently, Stratton still performs locally in the East London area, sometimes with a reformed version of Remus Down Boulevard, and occasionally tours Europe with various cover bands that play classic Iron Maiden songs. 
Stratton is endorsed by Caparison Guitars, from his tenure with Praying Mantis.

<text>Silchester is a village and civil parish about north of Basingstoke in Hampshire. It is adjacent to the county boundary with Berkshire and about south-west of Reading.

Silchester is most notable for the archaeological site and Roman town of Calleva Atrebatum, an Iron Age and later Atrebates Celtic settlement first occupied by the Romans in about AD 45, and which includes what is considered the best-preserved Roman wall in Great Britain and the remains of what may be one of the oldest Christian churches.

==History==
===Archaeology===
The University of Reading is leading a five-year archaeological research project to explore the later prehistoric use of the landscape around Silchester Roman Town and its underlying Late Iron Age oppidum (ancient Celtic fortified town). To date (2020) the project has identified 671 new archaeological sites, from the Neolithic through to WWII, in addition to the 267 already known. A number of reports on the archaeological investigations have been published by Historic England.

====Iron Age and Roman town====

&quot;Calleva Atrebatum&quot; was an Iron Age &quot;oppidum&quot; and subsequently a town in the Roman province of Britannia and the &quot;civitas&quot; capital of the &quot;Atrebates&quot; tribe. Its ruins are beneath and to the west of the parish church, which is itself just within the town wall and about to the east of the modern village.

The site covers an area of over within a polygonal earthwork. The earthworks and extensive ruined walls are still visible. The remains of the amphitheatre, added about AD 70–80 and situated outside the city walls, can also be clearly seen. The area inside the walls is now largely farmland with no visible distinguishing features, other than the enclosing earthworks and walls, with the church and old manor house in one corner.

Silchester was the subject of antiquarian interest from the 16th century onwards. The bronze Silchester eagle was discovered in the Basilica at Calleva in 1866 and can now be seen in Reading Museum. The most extensive excavations were carried out by the Society of Antiquaries from 1890 until 1909 under George E. Fox and W. H. St. J. Hope. During excavations carried out in 1893, the Silchester Ogham stone was located. Dated c. 500 AD, it is one of very few found in England. It is now held in storage at Reading Museum. The inscription on the ogham stone was in the Latin alphabet, but in Irish and appears to be indicating that the property belonged to someone named Tebicatos. The precise identity of Tebicatos remains a mystery, but it is possible that he was a pilgrim or a mercenary. 

Analysis of plant remains shows that Calleva residents had access to typical foods eaten in Roman Britain, such as cereals, coriander, and cultivated fruits. They also received imports of exotic medlar and mulberry fruits.

Calleva was finally abandoned in the 7th century, which is unusually late compared to other deserted Roman settlements.

===Manor===
&quot;Silcester&quot; was recorded in the 11th century, when one Alestan held a manor here with King Edward the Confessor as his overlord and one Cheping held another manor with Earl Harold Godwinson as his overlord. The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded that the Normans William De Ow and Ralph de Mortimer possessed Alestan&#x27;s and Cheping&#x27;s manors respectively. The book assessed Alestan&#x27;s manor at five hides and Mortimer&#x27;s at three hides. De Mortimer&#x27;s tenant was another Norman, Ralph Bluet. In 1204 he or a later Ralph Bluet gave a palfrey horse in exchange for a licence to enclose an area of land south-east of the former Roman town as a deer park. Today parts of the earthwork park pale survive and parts of the former park remain wooded.

Forms of the toponym included &quot;Ciltestere&quot; and &quot;Cilcestre&quot; in the 13th century, &quot;Scilchestre&quot; in the 14th century and &quot;Sylkchester&quot; in the 18th century before it reached its current spelling.

The Irish peer Murrough Boyle, 1st Viscount Blesington (1685–1718) bought the manor in 1704 and it remained with his hereditary heirs until the death of William Stewart, 1st Earl of Blessington in 1769. In 1778 it was inherited jointly by Thomas Vesey, 1st Viscount de Vesci and Edward Pakenham, 2nd Baron Longford. In 1806 Baron Longford&#x27;s daughter The Hon. Catherine Pakenham married Arthur Wellesley, who in 1814 was created Duke of Wellington. In 1821 Catherine&#x27;s brother Thomas Pakenham, 2nd Earl of Longford was created Baron Silchester, but in 1828 he and John, 2nd Viscount de Vesci sold the manor of Silchester to the Duke. In the first decade of the 20th century Arthur Wellesley, 4th Duke of Wellington still owned the manor of Silchester.

===Church and chapel===

The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin is just within the walls of the former Roman town, possibly on the site of a Roman temple. The building may contain some re-used Roman materials. The building dates from the late 12th or early 13th century. It has a north and south aisle, each of two bays. There is no chancel arch, and the chancel is longer than the nave. The wall of the south aisle was rebuilt in about 1325–50, incorporating an ogee-arched tomb recess containing the effigy of a lady wearing a wimple. Two new windows were added to the church in the 14th century, and two more including the Perpendicular Gothic east window of the chancel in the 15th century.

The church has a Perpendicular Gothic rood screen. The pulpit was made early in the 18th century but its tester is dated 1639. There is also a carved memorial cartouche to the Irish peer Viscount Ikerrin (died 1712). The bell-turret has a ring of five bells. Four were cast by John Stares of Aldbourne, Wiltshire in 1744. The other was cast by William Taylor of Oxford in 1848.

There is a Primitive Methodist chapel on Silchester Common.

==Geography==
The present village is centred on Silchester Common. It is about west of the Church of England parish church and former manor house (now Manor Farm), which are in the eastern part of the former Roman town.

==Local government==
Silchester is a civil parish with an elected parish council. Silchester parish is in the ward of Pamber and Silchester, part of Basingstoke and Deane District Council and of Hampshire County Council and all three councils are responsible for different aspects of local government. The ward returns two councillors to the borough council. The 2011 census recorded a parish population of 921.

==Transport==
Silchester Common is served (as of October 2017) by bus route 14 between Basingstoke, Chineham Shopping Centre, Bramley, Little London, Silchester Common and Tadley, operated by Stagecoach on Monday to Saturday.

==Amenities==
Silchester&#x27;s sole public house is the Calleva Arms, named after the former Roman town of &quot;Calleva Atrebatum&quot; that lies within the village boundary. It was previously known as &quot;The Crown&quot;.

The parish has events and village activities through the year including a beer festival, fun run, church fete, and music festival. The village has an amateur dramatic society and a village association.

Silchester Cricket Club compete in Regional Division Three North East in the Hampshire Cricket League.

===School===
Silchester has a Church of England aided primary school. Most Silchester children of secondary school age attend The Hurst School in Baughurst.

==Awards==
Silchester was voted &quot;Hampshire Village of the Year&quot; (2008) and &quot;South England Village of the Year&quot; (2009) in the Calor Village of the Year competition.

<doc id="1197806" wikidata="Q2455499" url="?curid=1197806" title="Trophozoite">
<text>A trophozoite (G. &quot;trope&quot;, nourishment + &quot;zoon&quot;, animal) is the activated, feeding stage in the life cycle of certain protozoa such as malaria-causing &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; and those of the &quot;Giardia&quot; group. The complementary form of the trophozoite state is the thick-walled cyst form. They are often different from the cyst stage, which is a protective, dormant form of the protozoa. Trophozoites are often found in the host&#x27;s body fluids and tissues and in many cases, they are the form of the protozoan that causes disease in the host. In the protozoan, &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot; it invades the intestinal mucosa of its host, causing dysentery, which aid in the trophozoites traveling to the liver and leading to the production of hepatic abscesses. 

==Life cycle stages==
=== &quot;Plasmodium falciparium&quot; ===
The causative organism of malaria is a protozoan, &quot;Plasmodium falciparium&quot;, that is carried by the female Anopheles mosquito. Malaria is recorded as the most common disease in Sub-Saharan Africa, and some Asian countries with the highest number of deaths. Studies have shown the increased prevalence of this disease since 2015. This protozoan has several other subspecies, with some causing diseases in humans with over 91,000 death in 2021 from malaria (&quot;Plasmodium falciparium&quot;) alone, which is a 77% increase from 2020 as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The Malaria lifecycle is divided into two phases:

# Human: The infected female mosquito (usually Anopheles species) bites a human and injects sporozoites into the bloodstream during a bloodmeal. The sporozoites travel to the liver where they invade liver cells (hepatocytes) in the Exo-erythrocytic Cycle. The sporozoites in the infected liver cells ruptures into schizonts which enter into the blood of the individual (Erythrocytic Cycle). The schizonts mature and divide asexually to form thousands of merozoites in the early trophozoite phase, which cause the malaria symptoms in humans. These mature and go through sexual reproduction, known as gametogenesis to produce the gametocytes (occurring in male and female forms) in the late trophozoite phase in the bloodstream that are picked up by other mosquitoes during blood meals.
# Mosquito: The gametocytes, flagellated microgametocytes (males) and the unflagellated megagametocytes (females) are ingested during bloodmeal by mosquitoes, which then enter into the cyst phase, sporozoites, and undergo a series of asexual reproduction. After a span of 10-18 days, the sporozoite moves to the mosquito&#x27;s salivary gland. In a subsequent blood meal on another human, anticoagulant saliva is injected along with the sporozoites, which then migrate to the liver, initiating a new cycle.

=== &quot;Balantidium coli&quot; ===
&quot;Balantidium coli&quot; is the causative agent of balantidiasis. In the apicomplexan life cycle the trophozoite undergoes schizogony (asexual reproduction) and develops into a schizont which contains merozoites.

=== &quot;Giardia&quot; ===
The trophozoite life stage of &quot;Giardia&quot; colonizes and proliferates in the small intestine. Trophozoites develop during the course of the infection into cysts which is the infectious life stage.

<text>HD 12661 is a G-type main sequence star in the northern constellation of Aries. The star is slightly larger and more massive than the Sun, with an estimated age of seven billion years. It has two known extrasolar planets.

==Properties==
The apparent visual magnitude of this star is 7.42, making it too faint to be viewed by the naked eye even under ideal viewing conditions. However, it can be readily observed using a small telescope with an aperture of or more. Parallax measurements of HD 12661 place it at a distance of about from the Earth, with a margin of error of ±0.2 light years. It has a stellar classification of G6 V, indicating that it is a main sequence star that is generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. The effective temperature of the star&#x27;s outer envelope is about 5,754 K, giving it the characteristic yellow hue of a G-type star. Based on stellar models, estimates of the radius of this star range from 107% to 112% times Sun&#x27;s radius, while the mass is likely in the range from 107% to 110% of the Sun&#x27;s mass.

As a star ages it slows its rotation and diminishes the amount of magnetic activity in its chromosphere. Hence the measured emission from the chromosphere can be used to estimate the age of a star, particularly for F and G-type dwarf stars with an age of less than two billion years. However, this technique becomes less accurate for ages beyond about 5.6 billion years. Based upon the chromosphere emission of HD 12661, it is older than the Sun with an estimated age of roughly seven billion years. It has a low projected rotational velocity of 1.20 km/s, consistent with it being an older star. The age of a star can also be estimated by the abundance of lithium, as this element is destroyed through thermonuclear fusion at the core. However, this is less accurate technique. For HD 12661, the lithium abundance gives an age estimate of 4.4 billion years.

The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the metallicity, is unusually high in this star when compared to the Sun. High metallicity has been found to be statistically correlated with the presence of a multi-planet system around a star. It is possible that a planet in this system may have been scattered and ended up being accreted by the star, which may account for the large surface metallicity.

==Planetary system==
The first planet was discovered in 2001 from the Lick and Keck observatories using precision measurements of the star&#x27;s radial velocity variations. The periodicity in this variation allowed astronomers to extract information about the planet&#x27;s orbit and minimum mass. A second planet was discovered by the same team two years later. Both planets are greater in mass than Jupiter.

The system is dynamically unstable. &quot;Either this system is being observed during a relatively rare state, or additional planets are affecting the observed radial velocities and/or the system’s secular eccentricity evolution.&quot;

<doc id="1197808" wikidata="Q1407466" url="?curid=1197808" title="Sleep-learning">
<text>Sleep-learning or sleep-teaching (also known as hypnopædia or hypnopedia) is an attempt to convey information to a sleeping person, typically by playing a sound recording to them while they sleep. Although sleep is considered an important period for memory consolidation, scientific research has concluded that sleep-learning is not possible. Once a concept explored in the early history of psychology, sleep-learning appears frequently in fiction and parapsychology, and is widely considered to be pseudoscience.

==History==
In 1927, Alois Benjamin Saliger invented the &quot;Psycho-Phone&quot; or &quot;Psychophone&quot;, a specialized version of Thomas Edison&#x27;s phonograph, for sleep learning, stating: &quot;It has been proven that natural sleep is identical with hypnotic sleep and that during natural sleep the unconscious mind is most receptive to suggestions.&quot; Saliger patented the device in 1932 as the &quot;automatic time-controlled suggestion machine&quot;.

Since the electroencephalography studies by Charles W. Simon and William H. Emmons in 1956, learning by sleep has not been taken seriously. The researchers concluded that learning during sleep was &quot;impractical and probably impossible&quot;. They reported that stimulus material presented during sleep was not recalled later when the subject awoke, unless alpha wave activity occurred at the same time the stimulus material was given.

==In fiction==
Sleep-learning is found in influential science fiction and other literature. The following examples are listed chronologically by publication or original air date, when known.

* In Hugo Gernsback&#x27;s 1911 story &quot;Ralph 124C 41+&quot;, one finds the Hypnobioscope, a sleep learning device.
* In Aldous Huxley&#x27;s 1932 novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;, it is used for the conditioning of children into the novel&#x27;s fictional future culture. In the novel, sleep-learning was discovered by accident when a Polish boy named Reuben Rabinovitch was able to recite an entire radio broadcast in English after a radio receiver was left on in his sleep. The boy was unable to comprehend what he had heard via hypnopædia, but it was soon realized that hypnopædia could be used to effectively make suggestions about morality.
* In Robert Heinlein&#x27;s 1948 novel &quot;Space Cadet&quot;, the character Matt Dodson is taught to speak Venutian (the language of the planet Venus) while under drug-aided hypnosis. He surprises his Venus-born friend Oscar by spontaneously reproving him when Oscar utters a curse in Venutian. (Later in the novel, Matt appears to have forgotten what he learned and relies on Oscar for translation.)
* In the BBC Radio series &quot;Journey into Space&quot; (1953–1958), during the second and third parts of the trilogy, there were said to be Martians abducting people from the Earth and conditioning them to obey instructions or to make them believe things that were not true. The inception of this conditioning involved putting the subject into a hypnotic sleep and appraising them of a certain situation; once they awoke they would believe it, regardless of the validity.
* In a 1961 episode of &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, &quot;A Lesson In Any Language&quot;, Mike connects a phonograph to an automatic timer to play Spanish lessons while he sleeps. Steve and Bub ultimately end up sleeping in the room and are able to speak fluent Spanish the following day.
* In Anthony Burgess&#x27;s 1962 novel &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, it is used to reverse the effects of the Ludovico Technique, a form of conditioning, which was used on the main character Alex to make him incapable of violent behavior. The conditioning was a new technique which was supposed to rehabilitate violent criminals in a short period of time, but which resulted in Alex attempting to commit suicide. This reflected very badly on the government, which had sanctioned the experiment, so hypnopædia was used to undo the conditioning.
* In 1954 Günter Spang wrote a children&#x27;s book called &quot;Lohengrin schwant etwas&quot;, meaning Lohengrin has a good idea, in which a bunch of schoolchildren take an easy way out of studying by learning in their sleep.
* In a 1963 episode of &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;, &quot;The Conquering Hero&quot;, Cathy tries to help a failing basketball player pass a quiz. She suggests that the latest scientific method of &quot;subconscious learning&quot; will help. She records the lessons on a tape which plays repeatedly while he is asleep. He passes the quiz after the answers &quot;come to him&quot; while looking at the questions.
* In the 1965 episode of &quot;I Spy&quot; titled Chrysanthemum, the assigned partner of Bill Cosby and Robert Culp&#x27;s characters, Maximilian de Broget claims to have learned Mandarin Chinese in his sleep.
* In the 1965 movie &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Uncle&quot;, a college student connects a phonograph to an automatic timer, which plays to sleeping students the voice of a girl reading their lessons aloud. This backfires in class, however—when asked to give an oral report, the students speak, but in the girl&#x27;s voice.
* In the 1966 novel &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;, an intellectually disabled 37-year-old, Charlie Gordon, has an operation to increase his intelligence. Professor Nemur and Dr. Strauss then give Charlie a &quot;teeching mashine that werks like T.V.&quot; Charlie explains to Professor Nemur that .
* The 1976 film &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot; contains a scene where Logan 5 (Michael York) chastises his friend Francis 7 (Richard Jordan) for his rigidly orthodox opinions, &quot;You sound like a sleep-teacher with a stuck tape&quot;.
* In a 1988 episode of the BBC2 sitcom &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, &quot;Me2&quot;, Arnold Rimmer uses sleep-learning tapes such as &quot;Learn Esperanto While You Sleep&quot; and &quot;Learn Quantum Theory While You Sleep&quot;, to the dismay of his bunkmate Dave Lister.
* In the 1990 movie &quot;Dragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might&quot;, Chi-Chi packs for her son Gohan a tape recorder so he can learn while he sleeps on a camping trip.
* In a 1992 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Bart&#x27;s Friend Falls in Love&quot;, Homer orders hypnosis tapes which are supposed to induce weight loss. However, the mail-order company sends him vocabulary builder tapes instead, and Homer gets fatter and fatter while his vocabulary increases, through hypnopædia.
* In a 1996 episode of &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, &quot;The Big Cheese&quot;, Dexter hooks himself up to a gramophone that repeats his lesson for a French class test the next morning. The gramophone gets stuck at the phrase &quot;omelette du fromage&quot;, and Dexter finds out the next morning that it is all he is capable of saying.
* In a 1997 episode of &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;The One with the Hypnosis Tape&quot;, Chandler borrows from Rachel a smoking-cessation audiocassette, to which he listens while he is asleep. The tape tells him that he is &quot;a strong, confident woman&quot; who does not need to smoke. He stops smoking, but also begins acting effeminately.
* In the 1997 PC game &quot;Outpost 2: Divided Destiny&quot;, one of the items available for research was hypnopædia, which allowed scientists to be trained more quickly.
* In a 2001 episode of &quot;Homestar Runner&quot;, &quot;A Jorb Well Done&quot;, Coach Z attempts to overcome his speech impediment with the word &quot;job&quot; (which he pronounces as &quot;jorb&quot;). After unsuccessfully trying several methods, Strong Sad gives him a tape of him repeating the word job thousands of times, &quot;from when (he) was practicing the dictionary&quot;. Coach Z takes it home and listens to it while he sleeps, and the next day is able to pronounce &quot;job&quot; correctly, but forgets Homestar&#x27;s name.
* The twins Hank and Dean Venture, of the animated television program &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot;, are homeschooled through the use of hypnopædic beds.

<doc id="1197809" wikidata="Q601388" url="?curid=1197809" title="Indus script">
<text>The Indus script, also known as the Harappan script and the Indus Valley script, is a corpus of symbols produced by the Indus Valley Civilisation. Most inscriptions containing these symbols are extremely short, making it difficult to judge whether or not they constituted a writing system used to record a Harappan language, any of which are yet to be identified. Despite many attempts, the &quot;script&quot; has not yet been deciphered. There is no known bilingual inscription to help decipher the script, which shows no significant changes over time. However, some of the syntax (if that is what it may be termed) varies depending upon location.

The first publication of a seal with Harappan symbols dates to 1875, in a drawing by Alexander Cunningham. By 1992, an estimated 4,000 inscribed objects had been discovered, some as far afield as Mesopotamia due to existing Indus–Mesopotamia relations, with over 400 distinct signs represented across known inscriptions.

Some scholars, such as G. R. Hunter, S. R. Rao, John Newberry, and Krishna Rao have argued that the Brahmi script has some connection with the Indus system. Raymond Allchin has somewhat cautiously supported the possibility of the Brahmi script being influenced by the Indus script. Another possibility for the continuity of the Indus tradition is in the megalithic graffiti symbols of southern and central India and Sri Lanka, which probably do not constitute a linguistic script, but may have some overlap with the Indus symbol inventory. Linguists such as Iravatham Mahadevan, Kamil Zvelebil, and Asko Parpola have argued that the script had a relation to a Dravidian language.

==Corpus==



By 1977 at least 2,906 inscribed objects with legible inscriptions had been discovered, and by 1992 a total of 4,000 inscribed objects had been found. In 2025, it was reported around 5,000 inscriptions have been excavated since 1924.
Indus script symbols have primarily been found on stamp seals, pottery, bronze, and copper plates, tools, and weapons. The majority of the textual corpus consists of seals, impressions of such seals, and graffiti markings inscribed on pottery. Seals and their impressions were typically small in size and portable, with most being just 2–3 centimetres in length on each side. No extant examples of the Indus script have been found on perishable organic materials like papyrus, paper, textiles, leaves, wood, or bark.

===Early Harappan===
Early examples of the Indus script have been found on pottery inscriptions and clay impressions of inscribed Harappan seals dating to around during the Early Harappan period, and emerging alongside administrative objects such as seals and standardised weights during the Kot Diji phase of this period. However, excavations at Harappa have demonstrated the development of some symbols from potter&#x27;s marks and graffiti belonging to the earlier Ravi phase from .

===Mature Harappan===
In the Mature Harappan period, from about , strings of Indus signs are commonly found on flat, rectangular stamp seals as well as written or inscribed on a multitude of other objects including pottery, tools, tablets, and ornaments. Signs were written using a variety of methods including carving, chiselling, embossing, and painting applied to diverse materials such as terracotta, sandstone, soapstone, bone, shell, copper, silver, and gold. , Iravatham Mahadevan noted that about 90% of the Indus script seals and inscribed objects discovered so far were found at sites in Pakistan along the Indus River and its tributaries, such as Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, while other sites located elsewhere account for the remaining 10%. Often, animals such as bulls, water buffaloes, elephants, rhinoceros, and the mythical &quot;unicorn&quot; accompanied the text on seals, possibly to help the illiterate identify the origin of a particular seal.

===Late Harappan===
The Late Harappan period, from , followed the more urbanised Mature Harappan period, and was a period of fragmentation and localisation which preceded the early Iron Age in the Indian subcontinent. Inscriptions have been found at sites associated with the localised phases of this period. At Harappa, the use of the script largely ceased as the use of inscribed seals ended around ; however, the use of the Indus script may have endured for a longer duration in other regions such as at Rangpur, Gujarat, particularly in the form of graffiti inscribed on pottery. Seals from the Jhukar phase of the Late Harappan period, centred on the present-day province of Sindh in Pakistan, lack the Indus script, however, some potsherd inscriptions from this phase have been noted. Both seals and potsherds bearing Indus script text, dated , have been found at sites associated with the Daimabad culture of the Late Harappan period, in present-day Maharashtra.

===Post-Harappan===
Numerous artefacts, particularly potsherds and tools, bearing markings inscribed into them have been found in Central India, South India, and Sri Lanka dating to the Megalithic Iron Age which followed the Late Harappan period. These markings include inscriptions in the Brahmi and Tamil-Brahmi scripts, but also include non-Brahmi graffiti symbols which co-existed contemporaneously with the Tamil-Brahmi script. As with the Indus script, there is no scholarly consensus on the meaning of these non-Brahmi symbols. Some scholars, such as the anthropologist Gregory Possehl, have argued that the non-Brahmi graffiti symbols are a survival and development of the Indus script into and during the 1st millennium BCE. In 1960, archaeologist B. B. Lal found that a majority of the megalithic symbols he had surveyed were identifiably shared with the Indus script, concluding that there was a commonness of culture between the Indus Valley Civilisation and the later Megalithic period. Similarly, Indian epigraphist Iravatham Mahadevan has argued that sequences of Megalithic graffiti symbols have been found in the same order as those on comparable Harappan inscriptions and that this is evidence that language used by the Iron Age people of south India was related to or identical with that of the late Harappans.

==Characteristics==
The characters are largely pictorial, depicting objects found in the ancient world generally, found locally in Harappan culture, or derived from the natural world. However, many abstract signs have also been identified. Some signs are compounds of simpler pictorial signs, while others are not known to occur in isolation, being known only to occur as components of more complex signs. Some signs resemble tally marks and are often interpreted as early numerals.

===Number and frequency===
The number of principal signs is over 400, which is considered too large a number for each character to be a phonogram, and so the script is generally believed to be logo-syllabic. The precise total number of signs is uncertain, as there is disagreement concerning whether particular signs are distinct or variants of the same sign. In the 1970s, the Indian epigrapher Iravatham Mahadevan published a corpus and concordance of Indus inscriptions listing 419 distinct signs in specific patterns. However, in 2015, the archaeologist and epigrapher Bryan Wells estimated that were around 694 distinct signs.

Of the signs identified by Mahadevan, 113 occur only once (are hapax legomena), 47 occur only twice, and 59 occur fewer than five times. Just 67 signs account for 80 percent of usage across the corpus of Indus symbols. The most frequently used sign is the &quot;jar&quot; sign, identified by Parpola as &#x27;sign 311&#x27;.

===Writing direction===
Most scholars agree that the Indus script was generally read from right to left, though some exceptions wherein the script is written left to right or in a boustrophedon mode are also known. Although the script is undeciphered, the writing direction has been deduced from external evidence, such as instances of the symbols being compressed on the left side as if the writer is running out of space at the end of the row. In the case of seals, which create a mirror image impression on the clay or ceramic on which the seal is affixed, the impression of the seal is read from right to left, as is this case with inscriptions in other cases.

===Relationship to other scripts===
Some researchers have sought to establish a relationship between the Indus script and Brahmi, arguing that it is a substratum or ancestor to later writing systems used in the region of the Indian subcontinent. Others have compared the Indus script to roughly contemporary pictographic scripts from Mesopotamia and the Iranian plateau, particularly Sumerian proto-cuneiform and Elamite scripts. However, researchers now generally agree that the Indus script is not closely related to any other writing systems of the second and third millennia BCE, although some convergence or diffusion with Proto-Elamite conceivably may be found. A definite relationship between the Indus script and any other script remains unproven.

====Comparisons with Brahmi====
Researchers have compared the Indus Valley script to the Brahmi and Tamil-Brahmi scripts, suggesting that there may be similarities between them. These similarities were first suggested by early European scholars, such as the archaeologist John Marshall and the Assyriologist Stephen Langdon, with some, such as G. R. Hunter, proposing an indigenous origin of Brahmi with a derivation from the Indus script.

====Comparisons with Proto-Elamite====


Researchers have also compared the Indus Valley script with the Proto-Elamite script used in Elam, an ancient Pre-Iranian civilisation that was contemporaneous with the Indus Valley civilisation. Their respective scripts were contemporary to each other, and both were largely pictographic. About 35 Proto-Elamite signs may possibly be comparable to Indus signs. Writing in 1932, G. R. Hunter argued, against the view of Stephen Langdon, that the number of resemblances &quot;seem to be too close to be explained by coincidence&quot;.

==Theories and attempts at decipherment==


===Decipherability===
The following factors are usually regarded as the biggest obstacles to successful decipherment:

* Inscriptions are very short. The average length of the inscriptions is around five signs, and the longest only 34 characters long, found on a copper plate belonging to the mature Harappan period. Inscriptions vary between just one and seven lines, with single lines being the most common.
* 67 signs account for 80 percent of the writing that has been identified.
* There are doubts whether the Indus script records a written language or is instead a system of non-linguistic signs or proto-writing similar to merchant&#x27;s marks and house marks, and to the contemporary accounting tokens and numerical clay tablets of Mesopotamia. Due to the brevity of inscriptions, some researchers have questioned whether Indus symbols can even express a spoken language.
* The spoken Harappan language has not been identified, so, assuming the script is a written language, the language the script is most likely to express is unknown. However, an estimated 300 loanwords in the Rigveda may provide evidence of substrate language(s) which may have been spoken in the region of the Indus civilisation.
* No digraphic or bilingual texts, like the Rosetta Stone, have been found.
* No names, such as those of Indus rulers or personages, are known to be attested in surviving historical records or myths, as was the case with rulers like Rameses and Ptolemy, who were known to hieroglyphic decipherers from records attested in Greek.

Over the years, numerous decipherments have been proposed, but there is no established scholarly consensus. The few points on which there exists scholarly consensus are the right-to-left direction of the majority of the inscriptions, numerical nature of certain stroke-like signs, functional homogeneity of certain terminal signs, and some generally adopted techniques of segmenting the inscriptions into initial, medial, and terminal clusters. Over 100 (mutually exclusive) attempts at decipherment have been published since the 1920s, and the topic is popular among amateur researchers.

In 2025, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. K. Stalin announced a $1 million (USD) prize for deciphering the Indus Valley Script, stating that &quot;Archaeologists, Tamil computer software experts and computer experts across the world have been making efforts to decipher the script but it remains a mystery even after 100 years.&quot;

===Dravidian language===

Although no clear consensus has been established, there are those who argue that the Indus script recorded an early form of the Dravidian languages (Proto-Dravidian). Early proponents included the archaeologist Henry Heras, who suggested several readings of signs based on a proto-Dravidian assumption.

Based on computer analysis, the Russian scholar Yuri Knorozov suggested that a Dravidian language is the most likely candidate for the underlying language of the script. The Finnish scholar Asko Parpola led a Finnish team in the 1960s–80s that, like Knorozov&#x27;s Soviet team, worked toward investigating the inscriptions using computer analysis. Parpola similarly concluded that the Indus script and Harappan language &quot;most likely belonged to the Dravidian family&quot;. A comprehensive description of Parpola&#x27;s work up to 1994 is given in his book &quot;Deciphering the Indus Script&quot;. Supporting this work, the archaeologist Walter Fairservis argued that Indus script text on seals could be read as names, titles, or occupations, and suggested that the animals depicted were totems indicating kinship or possibly clans. The computational linguist Rajesh P. N. Rao, along with a team of colleagues, performed an independent computational analysis and concluded that the Indus script has the structure of a written language, supporting prior evidence for syntactic structure in the Indus script, and noting that the Indus script appears to have a similar conditional entropy to Old Tamil.

These scholars have proposed readings of many signs; one such reading was legitimised when the Dravidian homophonous words for &#x27;fish&#x27; and &#x27;star&#x27;, , were hinted at through drawings of both the things together on Harappan seals. In a 2011 speech, Rajesh P. N. Rao said that Iravatham Mahadevan and Asko Parpola &quot;have been making some headway on this particular problem&quot;, namely deciphering the Indus script, but concluded that their proposed readings, although they make sense, are not yet proof.

In his 2014 publication &quot;Dravidian Proof of the Indus Script via The Rig Veda: A Case Study&quot;, the epigraphist Iravatham Mahadevan identified a recurring sequence of four signs which he interpreted as an early Dravidian phrase translated as &quot;Merchant of the City&quot;. Commenting on his 2014 publication, he stressed that he had not fully deciphered the Indus script, although he felt his effort had &quot;attained the level of proof&quot; with regard to demonstrating that the Indus script was a Dravidian written language.

===Non-Dravidian languages===

====Indo-Aryan language====
Perhaps the most influential proponent of the hypothesis that the Indus script records an early Indo-Aryan language is the Indian archaeologist Shikaripura Ranganatha Rao, who in his books, &quot;Lothal and the Indus Civilization&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Decipherment of the Indus Script&quot;, wrote that he had deciphered the script. While dismissing most such attempts at decipherment, John E. Mitchiner commented that &quot;a more soundly-based but still greatly subjective and unconvincing attempt to discern an Indo-European basis in the script has been that of Rao&quot;. S. R. Rao perceived a number of similarities in shape and form between the late Harappan characters and the Phoenician letters, and argued that the Phoenician script evolved from the Harappan script, and not, as the classical theory suggests from the Proto-Sinaitic script. He compared it to the Phoenician alphabet, and assigned sound values based on this comparison. Reading the script from left to right, as is the case with Brahmi, he concluded that Indus inscriptions included numerals and were &quot;Sanskritic&quot;.

S. R. Rao&#x27;s interpretation helped to bolster Hindu nationalist and Aryan indigenist views propagated by writers, such as David Frawley, who hold the conviction that Indo-Aryan peoples are the original Bronze Age inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent and that the Indo-European language family originated in India. However, there are many problems with this hypothesis, particularly the cultural differences evident between the Indus River Civilisation and Indo-European cultures, such as the role of horses in the latter; as Parpola put it, &quot;there is no escape from the fact that the horse played a central role in the Vedic and Iranian cultures&quot;. Additionally, the Indus script appears to lack evidence of affixes or inflectional endings, which Possehl has argued rules out an Indo-European language such as Sanskrit as the language of the Indus script.

====Munda language====
A less popular hypothesis suggests that the Indus script belongs to the Munda family of languages. This language family is spoken largely in central and eastern India, and is related to some Southeast Asian languages. However, much like the Indo-Aryan language, the reconstructed vocabulary of early Munda does not reflect the Harappan culture, therefore, its candidacy for being the language of the Indus Civilisation is dim.

===Non-linguistic signs===

An opposing hypothesis is that these symbols are nonlinguistic signs which symbolise families, clans, gods, and religious concepts, and are similar to components of coats of arms or totem poles. In a 2004 article, Steve Farmer, Richard Sproat, and Michael Witzel presented a number of arguments stating that the Indus script is nonlinguistic. The main ones are the extreme brevity of the inscriptions, the existence of too many rare signs (which increase over the 700-year period of the Mature Harappan civilisation), and the lack of the random-looking sign repetition that is typical of language.

Asko Parpola, reviewing the Farmer &quot;et al.&quot; thesis in 2005, stated that their arguments &quot;can be easily controverted&quot;. He cited the presence of a large number of rare signs in Chinese and emphasised there was &quot;little reason for sign repetition in short seal texts written in an early logo-syllabic script&quot;. Revisiting the question in a 2008 lecture, Parpola took on each of the 10 main arguments of Farmer &quot;et al.&quot;, presenting counterarguments for each.

A 2009 paper published by Rajesh P. N. Rao, Iravatham Mahadevan, and others in the journal &quot;Science&quot; also challenged the argument that the Indus script might have been a nonlinguistic symbol system. The paper concluded the conditional entropy of Indus inscriptions closely matched those of linguistic systems like the Sumerian logo-syllabic system, Rig Vedic Sanskrit etc., but they are careful to stress that by itself does not imply the script is linguistic. A follow-up study presented further evidence in terms of entropies of longer sequences of symbols beyond pairs. However, Sproat argued there existed a number of misunderstandings in Rao &quot;et al.&quot;, including a lack of discriminative power in their model, and argued that applying their model to known non-linguistic systems such as Mesopotamian deity symbols produced similar results to the Indus script. Rao &quot;et al.&quot; argument against Sproat&#x27;s arguments and Sproat&#x27;s reply were published in &quot;Computational Linguistics&quot; in December 2010. The June 2014 issue of &quot;Language&quot; carries a paper by Sproat that provides further evidence that the methodology of Rao &quot;et al.&quot; is flawed. Rao &quot;et al.&quot; rebuttal of Sproat&#x27;s 2014 article and Sproat&#x27;s response are published in the December 2015 issue of &quot;Language&quot;.

==Unicode==
The Indus symbols have been assigned the ISO 15924 code &quot;Inds&quot;. Michael Everson submitted a completed proposal for encoding the script in Unicode&#x27;s Supplementary Multilingual Plane in 1999, but this proposal has not been approved by the Unicode Technical Committee. , the Script Encoding Initiative still lists the proposal among the list of scripts that are not yet officially encoded in the Unicode Standard (and ISO/IEC 10646).

The Indus Script Font is a Private Use Areas (PUA) font representing the Indus script. The font was developed based on a corpus compiled by Indologist Asko Parpola in his book &quot;Deciphering the Indus Script&quot;. Amar Fayaz Buriro, a language engineer, and Shabir Kumbhar, a developer of fonts, were tasked by the National Fund for Mohenjo-daro to develop this font, and they presented it at an international conference on Mohenjo-daro and the Indus Valley Civilisation on 8 February 2017.

==Decline==
The Indus Valley Civilization started to decline around 1800 BCE. This phase included the disappearance of writing. The script created by the Indus Valley Civilization perished along with it. The Vedic civilization, which ruled over North India for several centuries, did not use the Indus Script or have a writing system.

<doc id="1197818" wikidata="Q1057021" url="?curid=1197818" title="Bird strike">
<text>A bird strike (sometimes called birdstrike, bird ingestion (for an engine), bird hit, or bird aircraft strike hazard (BASH)) is a collision between an airborne animal (usually a bird or bat) and a moving vehicle (usually an aircraft). The term is also used for bird deaths resulting from collisions with structures, such as power lines, towers and wind turbines (see bird–skyscraper collisions and towerkill).

A significant threat to flight safety, bird strikes have caused a number of accidents with human casualties. There are over 13,000 bird strikes annually in the US alone. However, the number of major accidents involving civil aircraft is quite low and it has been estimated that there is only about one accident resulting in human death in one billion (109) flying hours. The majority of bird strikes (65%) cause little damage to the aircraft; however, the collision is usually fatal to the bird(s) involved.

Vultures and geese have been ranked the second and third most hazardous kinds of wildlife to aircraft in the United States, after deer, with approximately 240 goose–aircraft collisions in the United States each year. 80% of all bird strikes go unreported.

Most accidents occur when a bird (or group of birds) collides with the windscreen or is sucked into the engine of jet aircraft. These cause annual damages that have been estimated at $400 million within the United States alone and up to $1.2 billion to commercial aircraft worldwide. In addition to property damage, collisions between man-made structures and conveyances and birds is a contributing factor, among many others, to the worldwide decline of many avian species.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) received 65,139 bird strike reports for 2011–14, and the Federal Aviation Administration counted 177,269 wildlife strike reports on civil aircraft between 1990 and 2015, growing 38% in seven years from 2009 to 2015. Birds accounted for 97%.

==Event description==

Bird strikes happen most often during takeoff or landing, or during low altitude flight. However, bird strikes have also been reported at high altitudes, some as high as above the ground. Bar-headed geese have been seen flying as high as above sea level. An aircraft over the Ivory Coast collided with a Rüppell&#x27;s vulture at the altitude of , the current record avian height. The majority of bird collisions occur near or at airports (90%, according to the ICAO) during takeoff, landing and associated phases. According to the FAA wildlife hazard management manual for 2005, less than 8% of strikes occur above and 61% occur at less than .

The point of impact is usually any forward-facing edge of the vehicle such as a wing leading edge, nose cone, jet engine cowling or engine inlet.

Jet engine ingestion is extremely serious due to the rotation speed of the engine fan and engine design. As the bird strikes a fan blade, that blade can be displaced into another blade and so forth, causing a cascading failure. Jet engines are particularly vulnerable during the takeoff phase when the engine is turning at a very high speed and the plane is at a low altitude where birds are more commonly found.

The force of the impact on an aircraft depends on the weight of the animal and the speed difference and direction at the point of impact. The energy of the impact increases with the square of the speed difference. High-speed impacts, as with jet aircraft, can cause considerable damage and even catastrophic failure to the vehicle. The energy of a bird moving at a relative velocity of approximately equals the energy of a weight dropped from a height of . However, according to the FAA only 15% of strikes (ICAO 11%) actually result in damage to the aircraft.

Bird strikes can damage vehicle components, or injure passengers. Flocks of birds are especially dangerous and can lead to multiple strikes, with corresponding damage. Depending on the damage, aircraft at low altitudes or during take-off and landing often cannot recover in time. US Airways Flight 1549 is a classic example of this. The engines on the Airbus A320 used on that flight were torn apart by multiple bird strikes at low altitude. There was no time to make a safe landing at an airport, forcing a water landing in the Hudson River.

Remains of the bird, termed &quot;snarge&quot;, are sent to identification centers where forensic techniques may be used to identify the species involved. These samples need to be taken carefully by trained personnel to ensure proper analysis and reduce the risks of infection (zoonoses).

==Species==
Most bird strikes involve large birds with big populations, particularly geese and gulls in the United States. In parts of the US, Canada geese and migratory snow geese populations have risen significantly while feral Canada geese and greylag geese have increased in parts of Europe, increasing the risk of these large birds to aircraft. In other parts of the world, large birds of prey such as &quot;Gyps&quot; vultures and &quot;Milvus&quot; kites are often involved. In the US, reported strikes are mainly from waterfowl (30%), gulls (22%), raptors (20%), and pigeons and doves (7%). The Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Feather Identification Laboratory has identified turkey vultures as the most damaging birds, followed by Canada geese and white pelicans, all of which are very large birds. In terms of frequency, the laboratory most commonly finds mourning doves and horned larks involved in the strike.

The largest numbers of strikes happen during the spring and fall migrations. Bird strikes above altitude are about 7 times more common at night than during the day during the bird migration season.

Large land animals, such as deer, can also be a problem to aircraft during takeoff and landing. Between 1990 and 2013, civil aircraft experienced more than 1,000 collisions with deer and 440 with coyotes.

An animal hazard reported from London Stansted Airport in England is rabbits: they get run over by ground vehicles and planes, and they pass large amounts of droppings, which attract mice, which in turn attract owls, which then become another birdstrike hazard.

==Countermeasures==
There are three approaches to reduce the effect of bird strikes. The vehicles can be designed to be more bird-resistant, the birds can be moved out of the way of the vehicle, or the vehicle can be moved out of the way of the birds.

===Vehicle design===
Most large commercial jet engines include design features that ensure they can shut down after ingesting a bird weighing up to . The engine does not have to survive the ingestion, just be safely shut down. This is a standalone requirement, meaning the engine alone, not the aircraft, must pass the test. Multiple strikes (such as from hitting a flock of birds) on twin-engine jet aircraft are very serious events because they can disable multiple aircraft systems. Emergency action may be required to land the aircraft, as in the January 15, 2009 forced ditching of US Airways Flight 1549.

As required by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA)&#x27;s CS 25.631 or the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)&#x27;s 14 CFR § 25.571(e)(1) post Amdt 25-96, modern jet aircraft structures are designed for continued safe flight and landing after withstanding one bird impact anywhere on the aircraft (including the flight deck windshields). Per the FAA&#x27;s 14 CFR § 25.631, they must also withstand one bird impact anywhere on the empennage. Flight deck windows on jet aircraft must be able to withstand one bird collision without yielding or spalling. For the empennage, this is usually accomplished by designing redundant structures and protected locations for control system elements or protective devices such as splitter plates or energy-absorbing material. Often, one aircraft manufacturer will use similar protective design features for all of its aircraft models, to minimize testing and certification costs. Transport Canada also pays particular attention to these requirements during aircraft certification, considering there are many documented cases in North America of bird strikes with large Canada geese which weigh approximately on average, and can sometimes weigh as much as .

At first, bird strike testing by manufacturers involved firing a bird carcass from a gas cannon and sabot system into the tested unit. The carcass was soon replaced with suitable density blocks, often gelatin, to ease testing. Current certification efforts are mainly conducted with limited testing, supported by more detailed analysis using computer simulation, although final testing usually involves some physical experiments (see birdstrike simulator).

Based on US National Transportation Safety Board recommendations following US Airways Flight 1549 in 2009, EASA proposed in 2017 that engines should also be capable of sustaining a bird strike in descent. During descent, turbofans turn more slowly than during takeoff and climb. This proposal was echoed a year later by the FAA; new regulations could apply for the Boeing NMA engines.

===Wildlife management===
Though there are many methods available to wildlife managers at airports, no single method will work in all instances and with all species. Wildlife management in the airport environment can be grouped into two broad categories: non-lethal and lethal. Integration of multiple non-lethal methods with lethal methods results in the most effective airfield wildlife management strategy.

====Non-lethal====
Non-lethal management can be further broken down into habitat manipulation, exclusion, visual, auditory, tactile, or chemical repellents, and relocation.

=====Habitat manipulation=====
One of the primary reasons that wildlife is seen in airports is an abundance of food. Food resources on airports can be either removed or made less desirable. One of the most abundant food resources found on airports is turfgrass. This grass is planted to reduce runoff, control erosion, absorb jet wash, allow passage of emergency vehicles, and to be aesthetically pleasing. However, turfgrass is a preferred food source for species of birds that pose a serious risk to aircraft, chiefly the Canada goose (&quot;Branta canadensis&quot;). Turfgrass planted at airports should be a species that geese do not prefer (e.g. St. Augustine grass) and should be managed in such a way that reduces its attractiveness to other wildlife such as small rodents and raptors. It has been recommended that turfgrass be maintained at a height of 7–14 inches through regular mowing and fertilization.

Wetlands are another major attractant of wildlife in the airport environment. They are of particular concern because they attract waterfowl, which have a high potential to damage aircraft. With large areas of impervious surfaces, airports must employ methods to collect runoff and reduce its flow velocity. These best management practices often involve temporarily ponding runoff. Short of redesigning existing runoff control systems to include non-accessible water such as subsurface flow wetlands, frequent drawdowns and covering of exposed water with floating covers and wire grids should be employed. The implementation of covers and wire grids must not hinder emergency services.

=====Exclusion=====
Though excluding birds (and flying animals in general) from the entire airport environment is virtually impossible, it is possible to exclude deer and other mammals that constitute a small percentage of wildlife strikes. Three-meter-high fences made of chain link or woven wire, with barbed wire outriggers, are the most effective. When used as a perimeter fence, these fences also serve to keep unauthorized people off of the airport. Realistically, every fence must have gates. Gates that are left open allow deer and other mammals onto the airport. 15 foot (4.6 meter) long cattle guards have been shown to be effective at deterring deer up to 98% of the time.

Hangars with open superstructures often attract birds to nest and roost in. Hangar doors are often left open to increase ventilation, especially in the evenings. Birds in hangars are in proximity to the airfield and their droppings are both a health and damage concern. Netting is often deployed across the superstructure of a hangar denying access to the rafters where the birds roost and nest while still allowing the hangar doors to remain open for ventilation and aircraft movements. Strip curtains and door netting may also be used but are subject to improper use (e.g. tying the strips to the side of the door) by those working in the hangar.

=====Visual repellents=====
There have been a variety of visual repellent and harassment techniques used in airport wildlife management. They include using birds of prey and dogs, effigies, landing lights, and lasers. Birds of prey have been used with great effectiveness at landfills where there were large populations of feeding gulls. Dogs have also been used with success as visual deterrents and means of harassment for birds at airfields. Airport wildlife managers must consider the risk of knowingly releasing animals in the airport environment. Both birds of prey and dogs must be monitored by a handler when deployed and must be cared for when not deployed. Airport wildlife managers must consider the economics of these methods.

Effigies of both predators and conspecifics have been used with success to disperse gulls and vultures. The effigies of conspecifics are often placed in unnatural positions where they can freely move with the wind. Effigies have been found to be the most effective in situations where the nuisance birds have other options (e.g. other forage, loafing, and roosting areas) available. Time to habituation varies.

Lasers have been used with success to disperse several species of birds. However, lasers are species-specific as certain species will only react to certain wavelengths. Lasers become more effective as ambient light levels decrease, thereby limiting effectiveness during daylight hours. Some species show a very short time to habituation. The risks of lasers to aircrews must be evaluated when determining whether or not to deploy lasers on airfields. Southampton Airport utilizes a laser device which disables the laser past a certain elevation, eliminating the risk of the beam being shone directly at aircraft and air traffic control tower.

=====Auditory repellents=====
Auditory repellents are commonly used in both agricultural and aviation contexts. Devices such as propane exploders (cannons), pyrotechnics, and bioacoustics are frequently deployed on airports. Propane exploders are capable of creating noises of approximately 130 decibels. They can be programmed to fire at designated intervals, can be remote controlled, or motion activated. Due to their stationary and often predictable nature, wildlife quickly becomes habituated to propane cannons. Lethal control may be used to extend the effectiveness of propane exploders.

Pyrotechnics utilizing either an exploding shell or a screamer can effectively scare birds away from runways. They are commonly launched from a 12 gauge shotgun or a flare pistol, or from a wireless specialized launcher and as such, can be aimed to allow control personnel to &quot;steer&quot; the species that is being harassed. Birds show varying degrees of habituation to pyrotechnics. Studies have shown that lethal reinforcement of pyrotechnic harassment has extended its usefulness. Screamer type cartridges are still intact at the end of their flight (as opposed to exploding shells that destroy themselves) constituting a foreign object damage hazard and must be picked up. The use of pyrotechnics is considered &quot;take&quot; by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and USFWS must be consulted if federally threatened or endangered species could be affected. Pyrotechnics are a potential fire hazard and must be deployed judiciously in dry conditions.

Bioacoustics, or the playing of conspecific distress or predator calls to frighten animals, is widely used. This method relies on the animal&#x27;s evolutionary danger response. One limitation is that bioacoustics are species-specific and birds may quickly become habituated to them. They should therefore not be used as a primary means of control.

In 2012, operators at Gloucestershire Airport in England stated that songs by the American-Swiss singer Tina Turner were more effective than animal noises for scaring birds from its runways.

=====Tactile repellents=====
Sharpened spikes to deter perching and loafing are commonly used. Generally, large birds require different applications than small birds do.

=====Chemical repellents=====
There are only two chemical bird repellents registered for use in the United States, methyl anthranilate and anthraquinone. Methyl anthranilate is a primary repellent that produces an immediate unpleasant sensation that is reflexive and does not have to be learned. As such it is most effective for transient populations of birds. Methyl anthranilate has been used with great success at rapidly dispersing birds from flight lines at Homestead Air Reserve Station. Anthraquinone is a secondary repellent that has a laxative effect that is not instantaneous. Because of this it is most effective on resident populations of wildlife that will have time to learn an aversive response.

=====Relocation=====
Relocation of raptors from airports is often considered preferable to lethal control methods by both biologists and the public. There are complex legal issues surrounding the capture and relocation of species protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940. Prior to capture, proper permits must be obtained and the high mortality rates as well as the risk of disease transmission associated with relocation must be weighed. Between 2008 and 2010, U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services personnel relocated 606 red-tailed hawks from airports in the United States after the failure of multiple harassment attempts. The return rate of these hawks was 6%; the relocation mortality rate for these hawks was never determined.

====Lethal====
Lethal wildlife control on airports falls into two categories: reinforcement of other non-lethal methods and population control.

=====Reinforcement=====
The premise of effigies, pyrotechnics, and propane exploders is that there be a perceived immediate danger to the species to be dispersed. Initially, the sight of an unnaturally positioned effigy or the sound of pyrotechnics or exploders is enough to elicit a danger response from wildlife. As wildlife become habituated to non-lethal methods the culling of small numbers of wildlife in the presence of conspecifics can restore the danger response.

=====Population control=====
Under certain circumstances, lethal wildlife control is needed to control the population of a species. This control can be localized or regional. Localized population control is often used to control species that are residents of the airfield such as deer that have bypassed the perimeter fence. In this instance sharpshooting would be highly effective, such as is seen at Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport.

Regional population control has been used on species that cannot be excluded from the airport environment. A nesting colony of laughing gulls at Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge contributed to 98–315 bird strikes per year, in 1979–1992, at adjacent John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). Though JFK had an active bird management program that precluded birds from feeding and loafing on the airport, it did not stop them from overflying the airport to other feeding sites. U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services personnel began shooting all gulls that flew over the airport, hypothesizing that eventually, the gulls would alter their flight patterns. They shot 28,352 gulls in two years (approximately half of the population at Jamaica Bay and 5–6% of the nationwide population per year). Strikes with laughing gulls decreased by 89% by 1992. However this was more a function of the population reduction than the gulls altering their flight pattern.

===Flight path===
Pilots should not take off or land in the presence of wildlife and should avoid migratory routes, wildlife reserves, estuaries and other sites where birds may congregate. When operating in the presence of bird flocks, pilots should seek to climb above as rapidly as possible as most bird strikes occur below that altitude. Additionally, pilots should slow down their aircraft when confronted with birds. The energy that must be dissipated in the collision is approximately the relative kinetic energy (formula_1) of the bird, defined by the equation formula_2 where formula_3 is the mass of the bird and formula_4 is the relative velocity (the difference of the velocities of the bird and the plane, resulting in a lower absolute value if they are flying in the same direction and higher absolute value if they are flying in opposite directions). Therefore, the speed of the aircraft is much more important than the size of the bird when it comes to reducing energy transfer in a collision. The same can be said for jet engines: the slower the rotation of the engine, the less energy which will be imparted onto the engine at collision.

The body density of the bird is also a parameter that influences the amount of damage caused.

The United States Air Force (USAF)&#x27;s Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) uses near-real-time data from the National Weather Service&#x27;s NEXRAD system to provide current bird hazard conditions for published military low-level routes, ranges, and military operating areas (MOAs). Additionally, AHAS incorporates weather forecast data with the Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) to predict soaring bird activity within the next 24 hours and then defaults to the BAM for planning purposes when activity is scheduled outside the 24-hour window. The BAM is a static historical hazard model based on many years of bird distribution data from the Christmas Bird Count, the Breeding Bird Survey, and National Wildlife Refuge data. The BAM also incorporates potentially hazardous bird attractions such as landfills and golf courses. AHAS is now an integral part of military low-level mission planning, with aircrew being able to access the current bird hazard conditions at a dedicated website. AHAS will provide relative risk assessments for the planned mission and give aircrew the opportunity to select a less hazardous route should the planned route be rated severe or moderate. Prior to 2003, the USAF BASH Team bird strike database indicated that approximately 25% of all strikes were associated with low-level routes and bombing ranges. More importantly, these strikes accounted for more than 50% of all of the reported damage costs. After a decade of using AHAS for avoiding routes with severe ratings, the strike percentage associated with low-level flight operations has been reduced to 12% and associated costs cut in half.

Avian radar is an important tool for aiding in bird strike mitigation as part of overall safety management systems at civilian and military airfields. Properly designed and equipped avian radars can track thousands of birds simultaneously in real-time, night and day, through 360 degrees of coverage, out to ranges of and beyond for flocks, updating every target&#x27;s position (longitude, latitude, altitude), speed, heading, and size every 2–3 seconds. Data from these systems can be used to generate information products ranging from real-time threat alerts to historical analyses of bird activity patterns in both time and space. The FAA and United States Department of Defense (DoD) have conducted extensive science-based field testing and validation of commercial avian radar systems for civil and military applications, respectively. The FAA used evaluations of commercial three-dimensional avian radar systems developed and marketed by Accipiter Radar as the basis for an advisory circular and a guidance letter on using Airport Improvement Program funds to acquire avian radar systems at Part 139 airports. Similarly, the DoD-sponsored Integration and Validation of Avian Radars (IVAR) project evaluated the functional and performance characteristics of Accipiter avian radars under operational conditions at Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force airfields. Accipiter avian radar systems operating at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport, and Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point made significant contributions to the evaluations carried out in the aforementioned FAA and DoD initiatives.

In 2003, a US company, DeTect, developed the only production model bird radar in operational use for real-time, tactical bird–aircraft strike avoidance by air traffic controllers. These systems are operational at both commercial airports and military airfields. The system has widely used technology available for BASH management and for real-time detection, tracking and alerting of hazardous bird activity at commercial airports, military airfields, and military training and bombing ranges. After extensive evaluation and on-site testing, MERLIN technology was chosen by NASA and was ultimately used for detecting and tracking dangerous vulture activity during the 22 Space Shuttle launches from 2006 to the conclusion of the program in 2011. The USAF has contracted DeTect since 2003 to provide the Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) previously mentioned.

The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, a research and development organization, has developed the successful ROBIN (Radar Observation of Bird Intensity) for the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF). ROBIN is a near real-time monitoring system for flight movements of birds. ROBIN identifies flocks of birds within the signals of large radar systems. This information is used to warn air force pilots during take-off and landing. Years of observation of bird migration with ROBIN have also provided a better insight into bird migration behavior, which has had an influence on averting collisions with birds, and therefore on flight safety. Since the implementation of the ROBIN system at the RNLAF, the number of collisions between birds and aircraft in the vicinity of military airbases has decreased by more than 50%.

There are no civil aviation counterparts to the above military strategies. Some experimentation with small portable radar units has taken place at some airports, but no standard has been adopted for radar warning nor has any governmental policy regarding warnings been implemented.

== History ==
===In aviation===


The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) estimates bird strikes cost US aviation 400 million dollars annually and have resulted in over 200 worldwide deaths since 1988. In the United Kingdom, the Central Science Laboratory estimated that worldwide, birdstrikes cost airlines around US$1.2 billion annually. This includes repair cost and lost revenue while the damaged aircraft is out of service. In 2003, there were 4,300 bird strikes listed by the United States Air Force and 5,900 by US civil aircraft.

The first reported bird strike was by Orville Wright in 1905. According to the Wright brothers&#x27; diaries, &quot;Orville [...] flew 4,751 meters in 4 minutes 45 seconds, four complete circles. Twice passed over the fence into Beard&#x27;s cornfield. Chased flock of birds for two rounds and killed one which fell on top of the upper surface and after a time fell off when swinging a sharp curve.&quot;

During the 1911 Paris to Madrid air race, French pilot Eugène Gilbert encountered an angry mother eagle over the Pyrenees. Gilbert, flying an open-cockpit Blériot XI, was able to ward off the large bird by firing pistol shots at it but did not kill it.

The first recorded bird strike fatality was reported in 1912 when aero-pioneer Calbraith Rodgers collided with a gull which became jammed in his aircraft control cables. He crashed at Long Beach, California, was pinned under the wreckage, and drowned.


The greatest loss of life directly linked to a bird strike was on 29 December, 2024, when a Boeing 737-800, flying from Bangkok, Thailand to Muan, South Korea as Jeju Air Flight 2216, flew through a flock of birds during landing, leading to a dual engine failure. The aircraft crashed at Muan International Airport after a runway excursion into a concrete structure during a belly landing, resulting in 179 fatalities out of 181 occupants.

Before the crash of Jeju Air Flight 2216, the then greatest loss of life directly linked to a bird strike was on October 4, 1960, when a Lockheed L-188 Electra, flying from Boston as Eastern Air Lines Flight 375, flew through a flock of common starlings during take-off, damaging all four engines. The aircraft crashed into Boston Harbor shortly after takeoff, with 62 fatalities out of 72 passengers. Subsequently, minimum bird ingestion standards for jet engines were developed by the FAA.

NASA astronaut Theodore Freeman was killed in 1964 when a goose shattered the plexiglass cockpit canopy of his Northrop T-38 Talon. Shards of plexiglass were ingested by the engines, leading to a fatal crash.

On November 12, 1975, the flight crew of Overseas National Airways Flight 032 initiated a rejected takeoff after accelerating through a large flock of gulls at John F. Kennedy International Airport, resulting in a runway excursion. Of the 139 aircraft occupants, all survived, while the aircraft was destroyed by an intense post-crash fire. An investigation was carried out on the #3 engine by General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) in Ohio. Disassembly revealed that several engine fan blades were damaged and broken, causing blades to abrade the epoxy fan shroud; as the epoxy combusted, it ignited jet fuel leaking from a broken fuel line. However, GEAE denied that the ingested birds were the underlying cause of the damage. Company investigators speculated that a tire or landing gear failure had occurred prior to the bird strikes, and that tire, wheel or landing gear debris ingested into the engine caused the fan blade damage and cut the fuel line. To demonstrate that the General Electric CF6 engine was capable of withstanding a bird strike, the National Transportation Safety Board conducted a test with a sample engine.

In 1988, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 604 sucked pigeons into both engines during takeoff and then crashed, killing 35 passengers.

In 1995, a Dassault Falcon 20 crashed at Paris–Le Bourget Airport during an emergency landing attempt after sucking lapwings into an engine, which caused an engine failure and a fire in the airplane&#x27;s fuselage; all 10 people on board were killed.

On September 22, 1995, a U.S. Air Force Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft (Callsign Yukla 27, serial number 77-0354), crashed shortly after takeoff from Elmendorf AFB. The aircraft lost power in both port side engines after these engines ingested several Canada geese during takeoff. It crashed about from the runway, killing all 24 crew members on board.

On November 28, 2004, the nose landing gear of KLM Flight 1673, a Boeing 737-400, struck a bird during takeoff at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The incident was reported to air traffic control, the landing gear was raised normally, and the flight continued normally to its destination. Upon touching down at Barcelona International Airport, the aircraft started deviating to the left of the runway centreline. The crew applied right rudder, braking, and the nose wheel steering tiller but could not keep the aircraft on the runway. After it veered off the paved surface of the runway at about 100 knots, the jet went through an area of soft sand. The nose landing gear leg collapsed and the left main landing gear leg detached from its fittings shortly before the aircraft came to a stop perched over the edge of a drainage canal. All 140 passengers and six crew evacuated safely, but the aircraft itself had to be written off. The cause was discovered to be a broken cable in the nose wheel steering system caused by the bird collision. Contributing to the snapped cable was the improper application of grease during routine maintenance which led to severe wear of the cable.

During the launch of STS-114 on July 26, 2005, a large bird (presumed to be a turkey vulture) was struck by Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; shortly after liftoff. The collision proved fatal to the bird; however, the Space Shuttle was undamaged.

In April 2007, a Thomsonfly Boeing 757 from Manchester Airport to Lanzarote Airport suffered a bird strike when at least one bird, thought to be a crow, was ingested by the starboard engine. The plane landed safely back at Manchester Airport a while later. The incident was captured by two plane spotters on opposite sides of the airport, as well as the emergency calls picked up by a plane spotter&#x27;s radio.

On November 10, 2008, Ryanair Flight 4102 from Frankfurt to Rome made an emergency landing at Ciampino Airport after multiple bird strikes caused both engines to fail. After touchdown, the left main landing gear collapsed, and the aircraft briefly veered off the runway. Passengers and crew were evacuated through the starboard emergency exits.

On January 4, 2009, a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter hit a red-tailed hawk in Louisiana. The hawk hit the helicopter just above the windscreen. The impact forced the activation of the engine fire suppression control handles, retarding the throttles and causing the engines to lose power. Eight of the nine people on board died in the subsequent crash; the survivor, a passenger, was seriously injured.

On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 from LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte/Douglas International Airport ditched into the Hudson River after experiencing a loss of both turbines. The engine failure was caused by running into a flock of geese at an altitude of about , shortly after takeoff. All 150 passengers and 5 crew members were safely evacuated after a successful water landing. On May 28, 2010, the NTSB published its final report into the accident.

On August 15, 2019, Ural Airlines Flight 178 from Moscow–Zhukovsky to Simferopol, Crimea, suffered a bird strike after taking off from Zhukovsky and crash landed in a cornfield 5 kilometers away from the airport. 74 people were injured, all with minor injuries.

On September 16, 2023, the Italian Frecce Tricolori Aermacchi MB-339 squadron departed from the Turin Airport for an airshow. One jet experienced a sudden loss of engine power shortly after takeoff, possibly due to a bird strike, and crashed. The pilot ejected before the ground impact and was admitted to the hospital for burn injuries. A five-year-old girl died in the crash and subsequent fireball, and three other people were brought to the hospital for burns.

===In ground transportation===

During the 1952 edition of the Carrera Panamericana, Karl Kling and Hans Klenk suffered a bird strike incident when the Mercedes-Benz W194 was struck by a vulture in the windscreen. During a long right-hand bend in the opening stage taken at almost , Kling failed to spot vultures sitting by the side of the road. When the vultures were scattered after hearing the loud W194 coming towards them, one vulture impacted through the windscreen on the passenger side. The impact was severe enough to briefly knock Klenk unconscious. Despite bleeding badly from facial injuries caused by the shattered windscreen, Klenk ordered Kling to maintain speed. He waited until a tire change almost later to clean himself and the car up, and the two eventually won the race. For extra protection, eight vertical steel bars were bolted over the new windscreen. Kling and Klenk discussed the species and size of the dead bird, agreeing that it had a minimum wingspan and weighed as much as five fattened geese.

Alan Stacey&#x27;s fatal accident during the 1960 Belgian Grand Prix was caused when a bird hit him in the face on lap 25, causing his Lotus 18-Climax to crash at the fast, sweeping right hand Burnenville curve. According to fellow driver Innes Ireland&#x27;s testimony in a mid-1980s edition of &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine, spectators claimed that a bird had flown into Stacey&#x27;s face while he was approaching the curve. Ireland stated that the impact might have knocked him unconscious, or possibly killed him by breaking his neck or inflicting a fatal head injury even before the car crashed.

On lap 2 of the 1991 Daytona 500 driver Dale Earnhardt hit a seagull causing cosmetic damage to the front of his car. Despite this he would fight all the way up to second before spinning on the last lap and finishing fifth.

On March 30, 1999, during the inaugural run of the hypercoaster Apollo&#x27;s Chariot in Virginia, passenger Fabio Lanzoni suffered a bird strike by a goose and required three stitches to his face. The roller coaster has a height of over 200 feet and reaches speeds over 70 miles per hour.

==Bug strikes==
Flying insect strikes, like bird strikes, have been encountered by pilots since aircraft were invented. Future United States Air Force general Henry H. Arnold, as a young officer, nearly lost control of his Wright Model B in 1911 after a bug flew into his eye while he was not wearing goggles, distracting him.

In 1968, North Central Airlines Flight 261, a Convair 580, encountered large concentrations of insects between Chicago and Milwaukee. The accumulated insect remains on the windshield severely impaired the flight crew&#x27;s forward visibility; as a result, while descending to land at Milwaukee, the aircraft suffered a mid-air collision with a private Cessna 150 that the Convair&#x27;s flight crew had been unable to see until a split second before the collision, killing the three occupants of the Cessna and severely injuring the Convair&#x27;s first officer.

In 1986, a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress on a low-level training mission entered a swarm of locusts. The insects&#x27; impacts on the aircraft&#x27;s windscreens rendered the crew unable to see, forcing them to abort the mission and fly using the aircraft&#x27;s instruments alone. The aircraft eventually landed safely.

In 2010, the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) issued a warning to pilots about the potential dangers of flying through a locust swarm. CASA warned that the insects could cause loss of engine power, loss of visibility, and inaccurate airspeed readings via blocking an aircraft&#x27;s pitot tubes.

Bug strikes can also affect the operation of machinery on the ground, especially motorcycles. The team on the US TV show &quot;MythBusters&quot; – in a 2010 episode entitled &quot;Bug Special&quot; – concluded that death could occur if a motorist were hit by a flying insect of sufficient mass in a vulnerable part of the body.

<doc id="1197832" wikidata="Q139390" url="?curid=1197832" title="HD 37124">
<text>HD 37124 is a star in the equatorial constellation of Taurus (the Bull), positioned about a half degree to the SSW of the bright star Zeta Tauri. The apparent visual magnitude of this star is 7.68, which is too dim to be visible to the naked eye. It is located at a distance of 103 light years from the Sun based on parallax, but is drifting closer with a radial velocity of −23 km/s. Three extrasolar planets have been found to orbit the star.

The stellar classification of HD 37124 is G4IV-V, showing a spectrum with blended traits of a main sequence star and a more evolved subgiant star. It is a quiet star with a low activity index. This star is smaller than the Sun, with 81–92% of the mass of the Sun and around 92% of the Sun&#x27;s radius. It is an older, thick disk star with an age of around 11 billion years, and is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 3.6 km/s. The metallicity of the star, what astronomers term the abundance of heavier elements, is much lower than in the Sun with an iron abundance of 35–41%. It is radiating 77–84% of the Sun&#x27;s luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5,763 K.

==Planetary system==
As of 2011, three extrasolar planets have been found to orbit the star. Announced on the first of November 1999, the first planet (HD 37124 b) was discovered orbiting its parent star around the inner edge of the habitable zone, causing the planet to have a somewhat similar insolation to that of Venus. A second planet became apparent by 2003, thought to orbit in a 1940 days on an eccentric orbit, but this was subsequently found to be unstable. Solving this, a three-planet solution was announced in 2005: this contained a second planet (HD 37124 c) orbiting at the outer edge of the habitable zone with an insolation similar to that of Mars, and a third planet, (HD 37124 d). While not obviously in any orbital resonances in 2005, an updated solution announced in 2011 found planets &#x27;c&#x27; and &#x27;d&#x27; to likely be in a 2:1 resonance.

<doc id="1197847" wikidata="Q4970936" url="?curid=1197847" title="British Rail TOPS first arrangement">
<text>At the end of the 1960s, British Railways adopted the Total Operations Processing System (TOPS), a computerised system developed by the Southern Pacific Railroad in the United States. All types of locomotive and multiple unit received a TOPS classification, but the first attempt at applying TOPS was soon modified. This page explains the first attempt at using TOPS and cross-refers the classes allocated with those adopted in the successful re-arrangement. An explanation of the final arrangements for TOPS classification may be found here.

==Locomotives==
The first attempt to apply TOPS differed from the latter approach in two significant ways:
* xx/0 was not a valid subclass number. When the second arrangement was applied, original subclasses xx/1 became xx/0, xx/2 became xx/1 and so on.
* Some detail differences within classes were considered sufficient for a different class number to be allocated, rather than indicate it with a subclass. In addition, there are a number of cases where conversions led to complete reclassification, where similar circumstances later would be indicated simply by allocating a new subclass. The change in approach led to some odd gaps in the list of locomotive classes when they were re-arranged, as the principal class numbers were retained unaltered. Classes affected by this change in approach include:
** Class 29 (re-engined Class 21)
** Class 31 (re-engined Class 30)
** Class 34 (became Class 33/1)
** Class 43 (North British Locomotive-built Class 42 with different make of engine and torque-converter)
** Class 48 (Class 47 with experimental Sulzer vee-formation engine; later rebuilt to standard class 47 with in-line twin-bank engine)
** Class 72 (became Class 73/0)

==Diesel Multiple Units==
The first attempt to apply TOPS to diesel multiple units saw each carriage within a unit being allocated its own unique class number. This was probably because most DMUs were not kept in permanent formations. Classes were allocated according to the following division:
 100-131: Driving Motor cars
 140-150: Driving Trailer cars
 160-190: Trailer cars
 201-203: DEMU Driving Motor cars
 211-212: DEMU Driving Trailer cars
 221-225: DEMU Trailer cars
 251: Express DEMU Driving Motor cars
 261: Express DEMU Trailer cars

However, this arrangement was later revised so that each unit adopted the class number previously given just to the main type of Driving Motor car (the exception being the DEMU units, which were completely changed). The table below cross-references the old and new TOPS classes:

==Electric Multiple Units==
The first attempt to apply TOPS to the Southern Region&#x27;s fleet of electric multiple units, saw classes being allocated according to the following division:
* 40x: Southern Railway designed units
* 41x: 1951-type British Railways designed units
* 42x: 1957-type British Railways designed units
* 43x: 1963-type British Railways designed units
* 44x: 1967-type British Railways designed units
* 45x: Underground (&#x27;Tube&#x27;-sized) units
* 46x: 1971-type British Railways designed units

In comparison with the later re-arrangement, the types that were different were given the same class (e.g. the single-car luggage vans) and identified only by subclass, while those that were later treated as variations of the same class, were separated according to their construction period (e.g. early or late 1950s builds). When the new arrangement was applied, 40x classes were left untouched, but the others were changed as follows:

<text>Ross Paule (born April 4, 1976) is an American former soccer midfielder, who last played for the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer.

==Playing career==
Paule moved from Dallas, TX as a youth and joined the Memphis Futbol Club in Memphis, Tennessee. Paule also starred for Houston High School in Germantown, Tennessee where he was awarded the Commercial Appeal&#x27;s Best of the Preps title.

Paule played college soccer at Creighton University, but left only after three seasons, becoming one of the first players to leave college early for a jump to MLS. He was drafted 11th overall by the Colorado Rapids in the 1997 MLS College Draft, and became a regular right away, a starter by his second season, appearing in 19 games and starting seven. Paule&#x27;s best year with the Rapids came in 1998, when he tallied ten goals and six assists. He stayed with the team through 2001, running the team&#x27;s midfield, and was atop the league&#x27;s assist charts at midseason, when the Rapids traded for midfield maestro Carlos Valderrama. With no place for Paule on the squad, he was dealt to the MetroStars for Steve Shak and a draft pick.

Paule spent the rest of 2001 and all of 2002 with the Metros, usually playing—in a new out-of-position role of defensive midfielder, as mandated by Metro coach Octavio Zambrano. Ross was traded to Columbus prior to the 2003 season for Chris Leitch and Jeff Matteo and spent the next two seasons there, scoring seven goals in 2004, including a hat-trick against Los Angeles Galaxy. In eight years in MLS, his totals are 31 goals and 41 assists.

Paule retired early into the 2005 season because of post-concussion syndrome. He then went on to coach a local club, WASA, for the u12A girls team. After his first season with them he moved back to Memphis and is now the executive director of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes Soccer where he is producing a Soccer Themed New Testament with high-profile professional soccer player testimonies inserted into the New Testament. Each testimony is unique as Paule is connecting the players character trait to a person of faith throughout the Bible. He also is the executive director of newly formed Arlington Soccer Academy in TN.

==Career highlights==
Ross Paule was inducted into the Creighton University Athletic Hall of Fame in 2011.

<doc id="1197868" wikidata="Q561524" url="?curid=1197868" title="Raymond Roger Trencavel">
<text>Raymond Roger Trencavel (also Raimond, ; 1185 – 10 November 1209) was a member of the noble Trencavel family. He was viscount of Béziers and Albi (and thus a vassal of the count of Toulouse), and viscount of Carcassonne and the Razès (and thus a vassal of the count of Barcelona, which was also ruling Aragon at this time). 

Raymond-Roger was the son of Roger II Trencavel (d. 1194), and of Azalais of Toulouse (also known as the &quot;Countess of Burlats&quot;), daughter of Raymond V of Toulouse and sister of Raymond VI. Raymond-Roger was married to Agnes of Montpellier. His aunt, Beatrice of Béziers, was the second wife of Raymond VI of Toulouse.

Raymond-Roger lived in the Château Comtal in the fortified hill town of Carcassonne. The château was built by his ancestors in the 11th century. Raymond-Roger was not a Cathar, although many of his subjects were. He adopted a &quot;laissez-faire&quot; attitude to Catharism – and to other cultures and religions. He relied strongly on Jews to run Béziers, his second seat of power.

By mid-1209, at the beginning of the Albigensian Crusade, around 10,000 crusaders had gathered in Lyon and began to march south. In June, Raymond of Toulouse, recognizing the potential disaster at hand, promised to act against the Cathars, and his excommunication was lifted. The crusaders headed towards Montpellier and the lands of Raymond-Roger de Trencavel, aiming for the Cathar communities around Albi and Carcassonne. Like Raymond VI of Toulouse, Raymond-Roger de Trencavel sought an accommodation with the crusaders, but Raymond-Roger was refused a meeting and raced back to Carcassonne to prepare his defences. The city of Béziers was sacked in July and its population massacred. 

The town of Carcassonne was well fortified, but vulnerable and over-populated with refugees. The crusaders, led by a papal legate, Arnaud Amaury, Abbot of Cîteaux, arrived outside the town on 1 August 1209. As vassal of King Peter II of Aragon, Raymond-Roger had hoped for protection, but Peter was powerless to oppose Pope Innocent III&#x27;s army and could act only as a mediator.

The siege did not last long. By 7 August the crusaders had cut the town&#x27;s access to water. Raymond-Roger accepted a safe-conduct to negotiate terms of surrender in the Crusader camp. At the conclusion of these negotiations he was taken prisoner while still under safe conduct, and imprisoned in his own dungeon, where he died, possibly of dysentery, though there were suspicions of poisoning.

The town of Carcassonne had surrendered on 15 August. The inhabitants were not massacred but were forced to leave the town. Simon de Montfort was granted control of the area encompassing Carcassonne, Albi, and Béziers. Raymond-Roger&#x27;s dispossessed son, Raymond II (1204-1263), formally ceded his rights to Louis IX of France in 1247, after several failed attempts to recover his patrimony.

<text>Nice Enough to Eat is a budget priced sampler album released by Island Records in 1969.

Continuing the policy set by its predecessor &quot;You Can All Join In&quot;, the album presented tracks from the latest albums by established artists including Free, Traffic, and Jethro Tull, and introduced tasters from newer signings to the label, notably Nick Drake and King Crimson. The inclusion of the Nick Drake track, &quot;Time Has Told Me&quot;, has been credited with providing the first opportunity for many record buyers to hear Drake&#x27;s music.

It was priced as low as 14 shillings and 6 pence (£0.72), less than half of the standard album price at the time. The album is described at Allmusic.com as a &quot;somewhat incoherent sampler of folk-rock, prog rock, and prog-tinged hard rock&quot;, but with a &quot;stellar artist lineup&quot;.

It was combined with &quot;You Can All Join In&quot; for a CD re-release in August 1992 entitled &quot;Nice Enough To Join In&quot; (Island Records IMCD 150), but omitting tracks 1, 4 (side one) and 4 (side two).

==Cover==
The cover was designed by Mike Sida, who had already provided the cover for &quot;Spooky Two&quot;, and went on to produce several further classic Island album covers including Free&#x27;s &quot;Fire and Water&quot; and Traffic&#x27;s &quot;John Barleycorn Must Die&quot;. The front cover&#x27;s simple motif of names of featured bands spelt out in alphabet sweets (in a combination of blue/biscuit colours alone) is subverted on the rear cover, where most of the letters have been dispersed and replaced by what seem to be brightly coloured tablets.&lt;br&gt;
The rear cover also features the track listing and thumbnail images of eight of the featured albums (1.1-4, 2.1, 2.3-4 &amp; 2.6).

<doc id="1197877" wikidata="Q700577" url="?curid=1197877" title="Werwolf (Wehrmacht headquarters)">
<text>Führerhauptquartier Werwolf was the codename used for one of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s World War II Eastern Front military headquarters located in a pine forest about north of Vinnytsia, in Ukraine, which was used between 1942 and 1943. It was one of a number of &quot;Führer&quot; Headquarters throughout Europe, and the most easterly ever used by Hitler in person.

== Naming ==
The name is derived from &quot;Werwolf&quot; or &quot;Wehrwolf&quot; in German, which can be translated as werewolf. The Nazis also used the term &quot;Werwolf&quot; as a codename for clandestine resistance groups which were intended to carry out guerrilla attacks against the occupying forces towards the end of World War II. The naming scheme is in accord with other code-names given to &quot;Führerhauptquartiere&quot; during the Second World War, such as &quot;Wolfsschanze.&quot; Several were named for Hitler himself, whose nickname was &quot;Wolf&quot;. The site was also the easternmost Wehrmacht headquarters.

==Headquarters ==
The complex was located in a pine forest about north of Vinnytsia in occupied Ukraine, between the villages of Stryzhavka and Kolo-Mikhailovka on the Kyiv highway. It was built between December 1941 and June 1942 under top secret conditions by Soviet prisoners of war. In July 1941 the whole Vinnyts’ka oblast’ was occupied by the Nazi regime and later the entire region. Systematic warcrimes took place nearby. According to official figures, during the Nazi occupation of the region over 200,000 local civilians were killed, including 25,000 in Vinnytsia in September 1941 and April 1942. Also 1,800 psychiatric patients were shot, starved or poisoned. The Nazi regime built 18 camps for Soviet prisoners of war in the region, and several ghettos, labor camps and prisons for Jewish residents, all of whom were killed by the German occupants. Thousands of women from the Vinnytsia region were sent to forced labor camps in Germany—61,000 people were removed to be replaced by German occupants. 

The location may have been influenced by the Nazis&#x27; proposed trans-European highway to the Crimean Peninsula, which would have connected with the site. The Wehrmacht had its regional headquarters in Vinnytsia, and the Luftwaffe had a strong presence at their airbase in Kalinovka, about away.

Hitler&#x27;s accommodation at Werwolf (the Führerhaus) consisted of a modest log cabin built around a private courtyard with its own concrete bunker. The rest of the complex consisted of about 20 wooden cottages and barracks and up to three &quot;B&quot; class bunkers, surrounded by a ring of barbed wire and ground defensive positions connected by tunnels. A couple of observation points were set up on platforms in the oak trees surrounding the pine forest. The area was surrounded by a defensive strip of bunkers, anti-aircraft guns and tanks, as well as anti-tank ditches and minefields.

There was a tea house, a barber shop, a bathhouse, a sauna, a cinema, and a swimming pool primarily intended for Hitler who never used it. The facility also contained a large vegetable garden organised by the German horticultural company Zeidenspiner to provide Hitler with a secure supply of food. Hitler&#x27;s personal chef selected his vegetables and the food was chemically analyzed before being tried by a taster because of Hitler&#x27;s fear of poisoning. Oxygen tanks were also available at Hitler&#x27;s insistence. Water for the site was provided by artesian wells while power was provided by a generator. Some buildings were connected by tunnels.

The bunkers were constructed by Organisation Todt using some local Ukrainian workers, but mainly Soviet prisoners of war. The code name for the secret construction project was &quot;Anlage Eichenhain&quot; (Camp Oak Grove). The 4000 forced laborers were lined up and shot when construction was finished.

The complex was served by a daily three-hour flight connection from Berlin to the airfield in Kalinovka from the compound. There was also a regular train connection from Berlin-Charlottenburg to &quot;Eichenbein&quot; station at Werwolf. The journey took 34 hours.

During Germany&#x27;s Eastern campaign, Adolf Hitler lived mainly at FHQ Wolfsschanze (near Rastenburg, East Prussia) but he stayed at FHQ &quot;Werwolf&quot; three times:

* 16 July to 30 October 1942: The weather was hot, up to , and the bunkers were humid. Hitler caught severe influenza, with a temperature running up to . In this condition, he gave his fateful &quot;Führer Directive 45&quot;, splitting Army Group South into two parts in a bid to reach both Stalingrad and the Caucasian oil fields simultaneously. The Directive was the main cause of the eventual defeat and destruction of the German 6th Army at Stalingrad and the German Army&#x27;s subsequent withdrawal from Southern Russia to a new front near the Soviet city of Kursk.
* 19 February to 13 March 1943: to observe Field Marshal Erich von Manstein&#x27;s Kharkov offensive in the wake of Germany&#x27;s defeat at Stalingrad.
* 27 August to 15 September 1943: to observe the unsuccessful defense of Kharkov.

==History==
The Nazis destroyed the site, including mining access to the underground complex, upon abandoning the region. The site was examined after the Nazi departure in March 1944 under the orders of Joseph Stalin, but no documentation was found. The Soviet Union took steps to permanently seal the underground parts of the complex.

Today only the swimming pool and concrete fragments remain visible on the site, which is an open recreation area. The site can be visited but plans to create a full-fledged museum had not come to fruition as of August 2018. Nearby is a memorial to the thousands of labourers and others buried by the Nazis in gravepits at Stryzhavka.

<text>Derech HaShem (The &quot;Way of the Name&quot;) is a philosophical text written around 1736 by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto. It is considered one of the quintessential handbooks of Jewish thought. It&#x27;s of note that that would make the author around 29 or 30 when it was written.

The text covers a vast gamut of philosophical topics in the vast spectrum of classical Judaism&#x27;s outlook on the world. These topics include the purpose of creation, the Creator, human responsibility, the spiritual realms, providence, Israel and the nations, astrology, the human soul, theurgy, prophecy, the study of Torah, prayer, and the function of &quot;mitzvah&quot; observance. All these are brought in a clear flowing structure that builds on previous topics.

== Principles ==
The text systematizes the basic principles of Jewish belief regarding the existence of God, God&#x27;s purpose in creation, and the logical consequence of other concepts in Judaism. The reader is led from thought to idea, from idea to a logical whole of the structure of Jewish belief. 

One of its core assertions is that man was created for the purpose of earning closeness to the creator by struggling against evil inclinations.

Presented from a Kabbalistic perspective, yet presupposing no prior knowledge and without the use of Kabbalistic terminology, this work provides a foundation for understanding the worldview and ideas found in the throughout Jewish works on these topics. 

The book is organized into four main sections: the general basis of all existence, God&#x27;s Divine Providence and interface with Creation, prophecy and the Human soul, and practical religious observance.

<text>Gary Beach (October 10, 1947 – July 17, 2018) was an American actor of stage, film and television. His roles included Roger De Bris in both the stage and film productions of &quot;The Producers&quot;, which won him a Tony Award, and Lumiere in the stage musical version of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, for which he was nominated for a Tony Award.

==Early life==
Beach was born in Alexandria, Virginia, and graduated from Groveton High School. He went on to graduate from the North Carolina School of the Arts, the same school as his &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; co-star Terrence Mann.

==Career==
Beach&#x27;s television credits included both the 2003 and 2009 Kennedy Center Honors, &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;Sisters&quot;, &quot;Arli$$&quot;, and &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, as well as &quot;Recording the Producers&quot;, a documentary for PBS. Beach also lent his voice to Fox&#x27;s &quot;Family Guy&quot; in the now infamous banned-from-television episode &quot;Partial Terms of Endearment&quot; (available on DVD).

In 1994, Beach originated the comical role of Lumiere in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, a performance that earned him a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Musical. In 2001, he originated the stage role of Roger DeBris in &quot;The Producers&quot; for which he won the Tony Award for Featured Actor in a Musical. In 2004, he starred as Albin in the Broadway revival of &quot;La Cage aux Folles,&quot; earning him his third Tony nomination, this time for Leading Actor. After starring in the 2005 film version of &quot;The Producers&quot;, Beach returned to his stage role as Roger DeBris while the movie was in release, becoming the first artist to play the same part on Broadway and in movie theaters at the same time. In 2006, Beach played the role of Thénardier in the Broadway revival of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, a role he had originated in the Los Angeles production. Previously, he performed in the chorus for the 1989 &quot;Les Misérables: Complete Symphonic Recording&quot;. In March 2008, Beach joined the United States national tour cast of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Spamalot&quot; in the lead role of King Arthur.

Beach&#x27;s other Broadway credits included &quot;Annie&quot;, &quot;Doonesbury&quot;, &quot;The Moony Shapiro Songbook&quot;, &quot;Broadway Bash&quot;, &quot;Sweet Adeline&quot; (Encores), &quot;Something&#x27;s Afoot&quot; and &quot;1776&quot;. He toured nationally with the James Kirkwood comedy &quot;Legends!&quot; starring Mary Martin and Carol Channing. In addition to his Broadway credits, Beach was well known for his Summer stock theatre performances. In later years he frequently returned to Sacramento as a Music Circus favorite in shows such as &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, &quot;A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To The Forum&quot; and &quot;Spamalot&quot;.

==Personal life==
Beach and his husband, Jeffrey Barnett, resided in Palm Springs, California where Beach died on July 17, 2018, at the age of 70. On July 20th, 2018 at 6:45 pm, Disney presented a tribute to Beach on the marquee of the New Amsterdam Theatre.

<doc id="1197889" wikidata="Q698239" url="?curid=1197889" title="Later Baekje">
<text>Later Baekje (, ) was one of the Later Three Kingdoms of Korea, along with Taebong and Silla. Later Baekje was a Korean dynastic kingdom founded by the disaffected Silla general Kyŏn Hwŏn in 900, whom led the local gentry and populace that were in large Baekje descent holding onto their collective consciousness until the twilight days of Later Silla. With the former Silla general declaring the revival of the Baekje kingdom of old, the Baekje refugees from the old territories and a portion of the Rank Six Nobility from Silla seeking the opportunity of rising up the ranks gathered under his leadership. Led by the charismatic and capable Kyŏn Hwŏn who was also a competent field commander, Later Baekje in its early days was advantageous in the power game against the newly found kingdom Goryeo and the declining Silla. However, despite its fertile territories in the Jeolla Province and capable military prowess, it eventually fell to Wang Kŏn&#x27;s Goryeo army in 936 due to political strife and Kyŏn Hwŏn&#x27;s defection towards Goryeo. Its capital was at Jeonju, in present-day North Jeolla province.

== Background ==

=== Baekje Refugees of Later Silla ===
With Silla defeating the Tang Dynasty during the Silla-Tang Wars and finalizing the unification of the Three Kingdoms, an opportunity was provided for the culture of the three kingdoms to converge and for the residents to be integrated. When it came to Baekje, the vast majority of its populace including the ruling class was admitted to the polities of Silla onwards. However, Later Silla adhered to its Bone-Rank System that was highly exclusive towards the Goguryeo and Baekje refugees. In the case for those that came from Baekje, the discriminatory treatment was more severe. This was due to the fact that Baekje people resisted against Silla during its revival movement from 660 to 663. After the revival movement, Baekje refugees that were cooperative to the Silla government joined the ranks of the Nine Legions as part of the Blue and White Legion; fighting the Tang armies during the Silla-Tang Wars. Some, portion of the former royals and nobles of Baekje, were granted titles and positions by Munmu of Silla himself. However, despite these measures, there was a limit to embracing the people of Baekje by Silla when it came to fully integrating them.

Many of the former Baekje ruling class became ordinary people after the fall of Baekje. As evidenced by this, the Eight Great Families of Baekje was lost to history with many of them discarding their surnames. Though some were awarded, hence granted prestigious titles by Silla, the prizes that were bestowed upon them was far lesser of the old status back in Baekje. The Baekje people and that of their descendants&#x27; political success was bound to be limited. This eventually led to the dissatisfaction of the residents of the former Baekje region and the perception that they were in fact descendants of Baekje residents as a whole; holding an antipathic attitude against the Silla and preserving their collective consciousness.

=== Decline of Later Silla ===
After the Unification of the Three Kingdoms, Later Silla reigned as an powerhouse in the Eastern World, enjoying its heyday of more than 220 years. However, as it proceeded to decline, the local gentries across the country known as &quot;hojok&quot; began to have a desire to revolt, feeling that the central government&#x27;s control over the provinces it held gradually weakened due to the endless struggle for the throne amongst the True Bone-class nobility.

In the era of Queen Jinseong (887-897), the newly crowned queen of Silla, collected taxes were not efficient due to Silla&#x27;s weakened grip over its territories beyond its capital and the vicinity of it. Thus, officials were sent by the central government to urge the peasants and farmers across the country to have their taxes paid, infuriating them in the process. What came after were a series of rebellion with the Rebellion of Wŏnjong and Aeno in the Sabeol Province being the most famous of them. Though the rebellion led by Wonjong and Aeno (889) was put down to an end by Silla&#x27;s army, it signaled the beginning of the Later Three Kingdoms period that was to severely weaken Silla in the following years.

When it began with his attack on Mujinju in 892, Kyŏn Hwŏn&#x27;s rebellion was only one among numerous rebellions which sprouted up against the weak Silla rulers in the late 9th century. Many of these rebellions were initially triggered by the Silla decision to use force to collect taxes on the peasantry in 889 (Lee, 1984, p. 98). At this time most of the power on the peninsula was held by local gentry, who lacked strong loyalty to the central government. It was thus fairly easy for rebellions led by disaffected military officials to gain steam.

=== Rise to Power ===
Kyŏn Hwŏn, who was originally a military officer in Silla, was deployed in the southwest sea (South Jeolla Province) to wipe out pirates. However, his course of thinking that Silla was gradually declining resulted in his revolt in Mujinju (today&#x27;s Gwangju) in 892. The Samguk-sagi records as many as 5,000 people participating in his revolt. Kyŏn Hwŏn would march his army to occupy Mujinju and Wansanju (Jeonju). Afterwards, he ruled the area and internally referred to himself as the King of Baekje in 900. Having the country named (Later) Baekje was part of his plan to establish the state as an authentic successor to the ancient kingdom of Baekje, which dominated the southwestern part of the Korean Peninsula until it was conquered by Silla in 660. Additionally, Kyŏn Hwŏn having the country named after the old kingdom was with the justification of solving Uija&#x27;s long-cherished grudge towards Silla and inheriting the old kingdom itself. These measures were advantageous in the sense of gaining support from the Baekje refugees living in the area and rationalizing the rebellion against Silla above all else. The capital was later moved to Wansanju (now Jeonju) as well, which was closer to the central realms of old Baekje. Government offices were established in various parts of the country from this point on.

Afterwards, envoys were sent to Wuyue across the sea to establish diplomatic relations while territorial expansion policies were being implemented to subdue local gentries and independent castellans beyond. The confrontation with Taebong, the northern counterpart of the Later Three Kingdoms founded by Kung Ye and the Goguryeo refugees, would begin when both states confronted each other in the Ungju province (now South Chungcheong Province).

== Internal affairs ==
For all but the last year of its existence, Later Baekje was ruled by Kyŏn Hwŏn , and his personal style of rule played a key role in the kingdom&#x27;s fate.

After declaring himself king, Kyŏn Hwŏn took numerous wives, and is said to have had 10 sons by them in addition to the eight borne by his first wife. This laid the groundwork for the strife which ended the kingdom&#x27;s existence.

In 935, Kyŏn Hwŏn chose his fourth son Kŭm-gang over the elder sons as the crown prince of Later aekje. At this the eldest son, Kyŏn Sin-gŏm, conspiring with his brothers, had his father confined to Geumsansa in Gimje. Kyŏn Sin-gŏm killed Crown Prince Kŭm-gang and took the throne for himself. However, Kyŏn Hwŏn escaped to Goryeo.

== Military affairs ==
For much of its existence, Later Baekje was troubled by Wang Kŏn&#x27;s naval raids in Naju region. These worked to disrupt trade and diplomatic ties with Southern Chinese kingdoms.

Later Baekje possessed considerable military strength. South Korean historian Ki-baik Lee writes of Kyŏn Hwŏn that &quot;Had Kungye and Wang Kŏn not stood in his way, he surely would have had little difficulty in toppling Silla.&quot; Later Baekje showed its greatest strength in 927. In that year its armies attacked and pillaged the Silla capital at Gyeongju, slaying King Gyeongae and establishing King Gyeongsun as the ruler. Before the attack, Silla had sent for aid from Goryeo, and Wang Kŏn arrived with a large army shortly after Gyeongju was taken. The two armies met near Palgong Mountain in present-day Daegu. Wang Kŏn&#x27;s forces in the battle reportedly numbered 10,000 men. Later Baekje triumphed, and Wang Kŏn himself only escaped through the daring self-sacrifice of his general Sin Sung-gyŏm and Kim Nak.

However, when the two armies met again at the Battle of Gochang near Andong in 930, Goryeo scored a decisive victory. Later Baekje was pushed back into its heartland, and there suffered a further crippling defeat at Hongseong in 934.

== Diplomatic ties ==
As Wang Kon sought to maintain legitimacy through diplomatic ties with northern China, Kyŏn Hwŏn strove to do the same by maintaining ties with the rulers of southern China, particularly Wuyue. However, because Later Baekje&#x27;s existence largely coincided with the turbulent Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in China, neither side was able to parlay these ties into military support.

== Fall ==
After he was deposed by his sons in 935 and fled to Goryeo, Kyŏn Hwŏn himself came to lead the armies against Later Baekje. Together with Wang Kŏn, the &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot; reports that he led an army of 100,000 against his former kingdom. The Goryeo and Later Baekje armies met at Seonsan, today part of Gumi in North Gyeongsang province, and the Later Baekje forces were destroyed. Later Baekje thus finally fell in 936, one year after King Gyeongsun had surrendered Silla to Wang Kŏn. The battle of Seonsan thus marked the end of the Later Three Kingdoms period.

In his own characteristically open-handed style, Wang Kŏn conferred a title upon the defeated leader Sin-gŏm. Sin-gŏm&#x27;s younger brothers Yang-gŏm and Yong-gŏm, who were judged to have been to blame for the coup d&#x27;etat, were sent into exile.

<text>The Royal Indian Navy (RIN) was the naval force of British India and the Dominion of India. Along with the Presidency armies, later the Indian Army, and from 1932 the Royal Indian Air Force, it was one of the Armed Forces of British India.

From its origins in 1612 as the East India Company&#x27;s Marine, the Navy underwent various changes, including changes to its name. Over time it was named the Bombay Marine (1686), the Bombay Marine Corps (1829), the Indian Navy (1830), Her Majesty&#x27;s Indian Navy (1858), the Bombay and Bengal Marine (1863), the Indian Defence Force (1871), Her Majesty&#x27;s Indian Marine (1877) and the Royal Indian Marine (1892). It was finally named the Royal Indian Navy in 1934. However, it remained a relatively small force until the Second World War, when it was greatly expanded.

After the partition of India into two independent states in 1947, the Navy was split between India and Pakistan. One-third of the assets and personnel were assigned to the Royal Pakistan Navy. Approximately two thirds of the fleet remained with the Union of India, as did all land assets within its territory. This force, still under the name of &quot;Royal Indian Navy&quot;, became the navy of the Dominion of India until the country became a republic on 26 January 1950. It was then renamed the Indian Navy.

==History==


===East India Company===
====1612–1830, the Bombay Marine====
The East India Company was established in 1599, and it began to create a fleet of fighting ships in 1612, soon after Captain Thomas Best defeated the Portuguese at the Battle of Swally. This led the company to build a port and to establish a small navy based at Suvali, in Surat, Gujarat, to protect its trade routes. The Company named the force the &#x27;Honourable East India Company&#x27;s Marine&#x27;, and the first fighting ships arrived on 5 September 1612.

This force protected merchant shipping off the Gulf of Cambay and the rivers Tapti and Narmada. The ships also helped map the coastlines of India, Persia and Arabia. During the 17th century, the small naval fleet consisted of a few English warships and a large number of locally built gunboats of two types, &quot;ghurabs&quot; and &quot;gallivats&quot;, crewed by local fishermen. The larger &quot;ghurabs&quot; were heavy, shallow-draft gunboats of 300 tons (bm) each, and carried six 9 to 12-pounder guns; the smaller &quot;gallivats&quot; were about 70 tons (bm) each and carried six 2 to 4-pounder guns. In 1635, the East India Company established a shipyard at Surat, where they built four pinnaces and a few larger vessels to supplement their fleet.

In 1686, with most of the English commerce moving to Bombay, the force was renamed the &quot;Bombay Marine&quot;. This force fought the Marathas and the Sidis and took part in the Anglo-Burmese Wars. While it recruited Indian sailors extensively, it had no Indian commissioned officers.

Commodore William James was appointed to command the Marine in 1751. On 2 April 1755, commanding the Bombay Marine&#x27;s ship &quot;Protector&quot;, he attacked the Maratha fortress of Tulaji Angre at Severndroog between Bombay and Goa. James had instructions only to blockade the stronghold, but he was able to get close enough to bombard and destroy it.

In February 1756, the Marine supported the capture of Gheriah (Vijaydurg Fort) by Robert Clive and Admiral Watson, and was active in skirmishes against the French, helping to consolidate the British position in India. In 1809, a fleet of 12 ships of the Marine bombarded the city of Ras al-Khaimah, a pirate stronghold, in an unsuccessful attempt to quell Arab piracy. A subsequent mission in 1819 with 11 vessels proved successful in blockading the city for four days, after which the tribal chieftain surrendered.

In 1829, the &quot;Bombay Marine&quot; received the additional name of &quot;Corps&quot;, and also received its first steam-powered vessel, . Steaming from Bombay on 20 March 1830, &quot;Hugh Lindsay&quot; reached Suez after 21 days under steam (plus coaling stops at Aden, Mocha, and Jeddah), at an average speed of six knots. Between 1830 and 1854 the Indian Navy was responsible for maintaining mail service on the Bombay and Suez leg of the &quot;overland route&quot; (England–Alexandria, Alexandria–Suez overland, and Suez–Bombay).

====1830–1858====

In 1830, the Bombay Marine was renamed the &quot;Indian Navy&quot;. The British capture of Aden in the Aden Expedition increased its commitments, leading to the creation of the &quot;Indus Flotilla&quot;. The Navy then took part in the First Opium War of 1840. By 1845, the Indian Navy had completed the conversion from sail to steam.

In 1848, an Indian Navy contingent of 100 ratings and seven officers took part in the Siege of Multan during the Anglo-Sikh War. In 1852, at the outset of the Second Anglo-Burmese War, ships of Her Majesty&#x27;s Indian Navy joined a Royal Navy force under the command of Admiral Charles Austen to assist General Godwin in the capture of Martaban and Rangoon..Nabarun Rudra Paul, the great captain of India leased that time.

===Direct British rule in India===
After the end of Company rule in India following the Indian rebellion of 1857, the force came under the command of the British government of India and was formally named &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Indian Navy&quot;.

====1858–1934====
Her Majesty&#x27;s Indian Navy resumed the name &quot;Bombay Marine&quot; from 1863 to 1877, when it was renamed &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Indian Marine&quot; (HMIM). The Marine then had two divisions; an Eastern Division at Calcutta and a Western Division at Bombay.

As the HMIM wasn&#x27;t covered by Naval Discipline Act 1866 (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. 109) or the Merchant Shipping Act 1854 (17 &amp; 18 Vict. c. 104), the Governor General in Council was empowered to by the Indian Marine Service Act 1884 (47 &amp; 48 Vict. c. 3) to help formulate maritime and naval laws. These laws were first formulated and codified in the &quot;Indian Marine Act, 1887&quot; and followed by an amendment act to the same in the next year. The former adopted the general lines of the Naval Discipline and Indian Navy Acts as far as possible, whilst the latter merely supplied deficiencies in regard to grading and rating.

In recognition of its fighting services, HMIM was given the title of &quot;Royal Indian Marine&quot; in 1892. By this time it consisted of over fifty vessels. In 1905, the service was described as having &quot;Government vessels engaged in troop-ship, surveying, police or revenue duties in the East Indies&quot;.

When mines were detected off the coasts of Bombay and Aden, during the First World War, the Royal Indian Marine went into action with a fleet of minesweepers, patrol vessels and troop carriers. Besides patrolling, the Marine ferried troops and carried war stores from India to Mesopotamia (now Iraq), Egypt and East Africa.

The first Indian to be granted a commission was Engineer Sub-Lieutenant D.N. Mukherji, who joined the Royal Indian Marine as an officer on 6 January 1923.

===World War II===
In 1934, the Royal Indian Marine changed its name, with the enactment of the Indian Navy (Discipline) Act 1934. The Royal Indian Navy was formally inaugurated on 2 October 1934, at Bombay. Its ships carried the prefix HMIS, for His Majesty&#x27;s Indian Ship.

At the start of the Second World War, the Royal Indian Navy was small, with only eight warships. The onset of the war led to an expansion in vessels and personnel described by one writer as &quot;phenomenal&quot;. By 1943 the strength of the RIN had reached twenty thousand. During the war, the Women&#x27;s Royal Indian Naval Service was established, for the first time giving women a role in the navy, although they did not serve on board its ships.

During the course of the war, six anti-aircraft sloops and several fleet minesweepers were built in the United Kingdom for the RIN. After commissioning, many of these ships joined various escort groups operating in the northern approaches to the British Isles. and , each armed with six high-angle 4-inch guns, were present during the Clyde &quot;Blitz&quot; of 1941 and assisted the defence of this area by providing anti-aircraft cover. For the next six months these two ships joined the Clyde Escort Force, operating in the Atlantic and later the Irish Sea Escort Force where they acted as the senior ships of the groups. While engaged on these duties, numerous attacks against U-boats were carried out and attacks by hostile aircraft repelled. At the time of action in which the was involved, the &quot;Sutlej&quot; left Scapa Flow, with all despatch as the senior member of a group, to take over a convoy from the destroyers which were finally engaged in the sinking of the &quot;Bismarck&quot;.

Later , , , , also anti-aircraft sloops, completed similar periods in the U.K. waters escorting convoys in the Atlantic and dealing with attacks from hostile U-boats, aircraft and glider bombs. These six ships and the minesweepers all eventually proceeded to India carrying out various duties in the North Atlantic, Mediterranean and Cape stations en route. The fleet minesweepers were , , , , , , , , .

Four Australian-built Bathurst-class sloops served with the RIN from 1943 onwards. These included , which was a part of the Eastern Fleet during World War II, and escorted numerous convoys between 1942 and 1945.

The sloops and played a role in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily by providing air defence and anti-submarine screening to the invasion fleet.

Furthermore, the Royal Indian Navy participated in convoy escort duties in the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean and was heavily involved in combat operations as part of the Burma Campaign, carrying out raids, shore bombardment, naval invasion support and other activities.

====Royal Indian Naval combat losses====

The sloop HMIS &quot;Pathan&quot; was sunk in June 1940 by the Italian Navy Submarine &quot;Galvani&quot; during the East African Campaign

In the days immediately following the Attack on Pearl Harbor, was patrolling the Laccadive Islands in search of Japanese ships and submarines. At midnight on 9 December 1941, HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; sank the RIN patrol vessel with two lighters in tow en route to Karachi, with 6-inch shells at . &quot;Prabhavati&quot; was alongside the lighters and was mistaken for a surfaced Japanese submarine.

 was sunk by a Japanese aircraft during the Burma Campaign on 6 April 1942.

====Royal Indian Naval successes====

 was ordered in 1939, and built by William Denny and Brothers. She was commissioned in 1941, and with World War II underway, was immediately deployed as a convoy escort. &quot;Jumna&quot; served as an anti-aircraft escort during the Java Sea campaign in early 1942, and was involved in intensive anti-aircraft action against attacking Japanese twin-engined level bombers and dive bombers, claiming five aircraft downed from 24 to 28 February 1942.

In June 1942, was involved in the defence of Sydney Harbour during the attack on Sydney Harbour.

On 11 November 1942, &quot;Bengal&quot; was escorting the Dutch tanker to the southwest of Cocos Islands in the Indian Ocean. Two Japanese commerce raiders armed with six-inch guns attacked &quot;Ondina&quot;. &quot;Bengal&quot; fired her single four-inch gun and &quot;Ondina&quot; fired her 102 mm and both scored hits on , which shortly blew up and sank.

On 12 February 1944, the was depth charged and sunk east-south-east off Visakhapatnam, India by the Indian sloop and the Australian corvettes and . &quot;Ro-110&quot; had attacked convoy JC-36 (Colombo-Calcutta) and torpedoed and damaged the British merchant &quot;Asphalion&quot; (6,274 GRT).

On 12 August 1944, the was sunk near the Seychelles, in position 03º35&#x27;S, 52º49&#x27;E, by depth charges from and the British frigate HMS &quot;Findhorn&quot;.

====Mutiny of 1946====

In February 1946, Indian sailors launched the Royal Indian Navy Mutiny on board more than fifty ships and in shore establishments, protesting about issues such as the slow rate of demobilization and discrimination in the Navy. The mutiny found widespread support and spread all over India, including elements in the Army and the Air Force. A total of seventy-eight ships, twenty shore establishments and 20,000 sailors were involved in this mutiny.

===Transition to Independence and Partition===

On 1 March 1947, the designation of &quot;Flag Officer Commanding, Royal Indian Navy&quot; was replaced with that of &quot;Commander-in-Chief, Royal Indian Navy.&quot; On 21 July 1947, H.M.S. Choudhry and Bhaskar Sadashiv Soman, both of whom later commanded the Pakistani and Indian Navies, respectively, became the first Indian RIN officers to attain the acting rank of captain. Following India&#x27;s independence in 1947 and the ensuing partition, the Royal Indian Navy was divided between the newly independent Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan, and the Armed Forces Reconstitution Committee divided the ships and men of the Royal Indian Navy between India and Pakistan. The division of the ships was on the basis of two-thirds of the fleet to India, one third to Pakistan.

The committee allocated to the Royal Pakistan Navy (RPN) three of the seven active sloops, , and , four of the ten serviceable minesweepers, two frigates, two naval trawlers, four harbour launches and a number of Harbour Defence Motor Launches. 358 personnel, and 180 officers, most of whom were Muslims or Europeans, volunteered to transfer to the RPN. India retained the remainder of the RIN&#x27;s assets and personnel, and many British officers opted to continue serving in the RIN. As only nine of the Navy&#x27;s 620 Indian commissioned officers in 1947 had more than 10 years&#x27; service, with the majority of them only having served from five to eight years, British officers seconded from the Royal Navy continued to hold senior RIN shore appointments after Independence, though all naval vessels had Indian commanders by the year&#x27;s end.

===Dominion of India===

In May 1948, Ajitendu Chakraverti became the first Indian commodore in the post-independence RIN, in the appointment of Chief of Staff Naval HQ. On 21 June 1948, the additional designation of &quot;Chief of the Naval Staff&quot; was added before that of &quot;Commander-in-Chief, Royal Indian Navy.&quot; In January 1949, the first batch of 13 Indian officers began their flight training, initiating the process which would lead to the formation of the Indian Naval Air Arm.

On 26 January 1950, when India adopted its current constitution and became a republic, the Royal Indian Navy became the Indian Navy. Its vessels were redesignated as &quot;Indian Naval Ships&quot;, and the &quot;HMIS&quot; ship prefix for existing vessels was changed to &#x27;INS&#x27;. At 9:00 that morning, the White Ensign of the Royal Navy was struck and replaced with the Indian Naval Ensign, with the Flag of India in its canton, symbolically completing the transition to the new Indian Navy.

<doc id="1197917" wikidata="Q1128574" url="?curid=1197917" title="633 Squadron">
<text>633 Squadron is a 1964 war film directed by Walter Grauman and starring Cliff Robertson, George Chakiris, and Maria Perschy. The plot, which involves the exploits of a fictional World War II British fighter-bomber squadron, was based on the 1956 novel of the same name by former Royal Air Force officer Frederick E. Smith, which itself drew on several real RAF operations. The film was produced by Cecil F. Ford for the second film of Mirisch Productions UK subsidiary Mirisch Films for United Artists. &quot;633 Squadron&quot; was the first aviation film to be shot in colour and Panavision widescreen.
==Plot==
After the Norwegian resistance leader Royal Norwegian Navy Lieutenant Erik Bergman travels to Great Britain to report the location of a German V-2 rocket fuel plant, the Royal Air Force&#x27;s No. 633 Squadron is assigned to destroy it. The squadron is led by Wing Commander Roy Grant, a former Eagle Squadron pilot (an American serving in the RAF before the US entered the war).

The plant is in a seemingly impregnable location beneath an overhanging cliff at the end of a long, narrow fjord lined with numerous anti-aircraft guns. The only way to destroy the plant is by bombing the cliff until it collapses and buries the facility, a job for 633 Squadron&#x27;s fast and manoeuvrable de Havilland Mosquitos. The squadron trains in Scotland, where there are narrow glens similar to the fjord. There, Grant is introduced to Bergman&#x27;s sister, Hilde. They are attracted to each other, despite Grant&#x27;s aversion to wartime relationships.

The Norwegian resistance has to destroy the anti-aircraft defences immediately before the attack. When unexpected German reinforcements arrive, Bergman returns to Norway to try to gather more forces. He is captured while transporting desperately needed weapons, taken to Gestapo headquarters and tortured for information. Since Bergman knows too much, he must be silenced before he breaks. Grant and newly married Pilot Officer Bissell are sent in with a single Mosquito to bomb the Gestapo building. Though they are successful, their shot-up Mosquito fighter-bomber crashes on its return; Bissell is wounded and becomes blind. A tearful Hilde thanks Grant for ending her brother&#x27;s suffering.

Still worried, Air Vice-Marshal Davis decides to move up the attack to the next day. The resistance fighters are ambushed and killed, leaving the defences intact. Although Grant is given the option of aborting, he decides to press on. The factory is destroyed at the cost of the entire squadron, though a few crews are able to ditch in the fjord. Grant crash-lands but a local man helps Grant&#x27;s navigator, Flight Lieutenant Hoppy Hopkinson, pull the wounded wing commander from the burning wreckage. Back in Britain, Davis tells a fellow officer who is aghast at the losses, &quot;You can&#x27;t kill a squadron&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
Originally a project for director John Sturges, he initially worked on a script with Rod Serling of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; fame as early as 1958 and offered Jack Lord the leading role. After Sturges dropped out in favour of making &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, Walter Mirisch took on the project after reading the book. Filming took place during the summer of 1963.

Authentic period aircraft were used instead of models or special effects to create many of the aerial sequences. In part, this was because &quot;633 Squadron&quot; was the first film shot in colour in Panavision widescreen format, a choice that made the use of archival film (a common expedient and cost-saving measure in previous films) unfeasible. 

The original drafts of the script were penned by &quot;The Great Escape&quot; scriptwriter James Clavell. When Robertson expressed reservations about the story, producer Walter Mirisch engaged U.S. scriptwriter Howard Koch, resident in London, to rewrite the film to placate him.

===Locations===
The scenes were shot in the Scottish Highlands near Glen Coe, with most of the attack sequences filmed above Loch Morar and Loch Nevis.
Inverness Airport was used for filming purposes and aircraft were based there while filming in the Highlands. The distinctive outline of some islands can be seen behind some of the cockpit shots. While the spectacular aerial scenes used real aircraft, more dangerous sequences were created with models.

RAF Bovingdon substituted for the fictional RAF Sutton Craddock bomber airfield. The riverbank where Robertson&#x27;s character romances Maria Perschy was Hurley Lock on the River Thames and was also used in a similar early scene in &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;. Some scenes were filmed at Staverton Airport in Gloucestershire and the nearby Churchdown Hill could be seen in some shots. The pub in which the aircrew relax was The Three Compasses in Aldenham, Hertfordshire, which still exists.

The Lairig Ghru pass in the Cairngorms was used for the training flight sequences and scenes with the Norwegian resistance.

===The aircraft===
Walter Grauman, the director, collected flying period aircraft, creating the &quot;Mirisch Air Force&quot; or M.A.F. as it was dubbed. Grauman&#x27;s wartime experience as a North American B-25 Mitchell bomber pilot helped create an authentic aviation epic.

The film features eight De Havilland Mosquitos. As the Royal Air Force had retired the type in 1963, civilian operators mostly leased former converted bomber examples (TT Mk 35) to the RAF for target-towing. Scouring RAF airfields at Exeter, South Devon, Henlow, Shawbury and the Central Flying School at Little Rissington provided not only ten authentic aircraft but also vehicles and equipment from the war.

Eight Mosquitos were primarily used, five airworthy and others that could be taxied on runways or used as set dressing. The airworthy TT 35 Mosquitos were converted to resemble a fighter-bomber variant (FB Mk VI). The TT 35 models had their clear nosecones and side windows painted over and dummy machine gun barrels fitted. One airworthy Mosquito was a T3 with a solid nose, which only required the fitting of dummy gun barrels. It lacked the two-stage Merlin engines, V-shaped windscreen and bulged bomb bay of the TT 35s. At least one surplus Mosquito was destroyed in a simulated crash scene.

The Mosquitos used in the film were:
* &quot;RS709&quot; – flown in the film (now on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio)
* &quot;RS712&quot; – flown (now owned by Kermit Weeks, on display at the EAA AirVenture Museum, Oshkosh, Wisconsin)
* &quot;RS715&quot; – cockpit section only
* &quot;RS718&quot; – written off in simulated crash sequence.
* &quot;TA639&quot; – flown (now on show at the RAF Museum Cosford, Shropshire)
* &quot;TA719&quot; – flown (now on show at the Imperial War Museum Duxford)
* &quot;TJ118&quot; – cockpit section only
* &quot;TV959&quot; – at RAF Bovingdon Airfield, but not flown (now at the Flying Heritage &amp; Combat Armor Museum, Everett, Washington)
* &quot;TW117&quot; – flown (now on show at the Norwegian Aviation Museum, Bodø, Norway)

No German aircraft of the right type were available; consequently Nord Pingouin aircraft (French licence-built variants of the Messerschmitt Bf 108 Taifun) were used to represent the Messerschmitt Bf 109. At the beginning of the film, Lieutenant Erik Bergman&#x27;s original escape from Norway is in a Miles Messenger.

The primary camera aircraft, a North American B-25 Mitchell set up as a camera ship by Greg Board (also appearing in &quot;The War Lover&quot;) and flown by him, also appears in the film, dropping Bergman back into Norway. The director and former Mitchell bomber pilot Walter Grauman flew the B-25 himself, acting as co-pilot in the right-hand seat. During filming, technical advisor Hamish Mahaddie, who had acquired the aircraft for the film, told Walter Mirisch he &quot;commanded the 14th largest air force in the world&quot;.

===Special effects===
Although the film made extensive use of real flying aircraft, special effects were needed to create the final attack scenes. Oscar winning special effects technician Tom Howard used miniatures, front and rear projection and matte paintings to make the sequences work.

Cliff Robertson enjoyed working on the film and stated that the atmosphere on set was very good, but was unhappy with the ambiguous ending. He noted that the movie was shot on a very tight schedule and budget. He regretted not being allowed to pilot a Mosquito, which he was forbidden to do for insurance reasons.

==Differences from the book==
The film and the novel on which it was based follow the same basic plot, but many details were changed for the film. Some scenes were re-arranged in sequence and the story was heavily condensed with most of the characters&#x27; backgrounds not mentioned. The first half of the book sees the squadron equipped with Douglas Boston light bombers before converting to the Mosquito. An early coastal shipping strike sequence was omitted for the film, as was an action-packed reconnaissance mission. The film adapts only the second half of the novel.

In the novel, Squadron Leader Roy Grenville was a British character, but becomes Americanised as Wing Commander Roy Grant for the film. Robertson was cast because he was popular internationally at the time and because an American central character improved the production&#x27;s access to finance and worldwide audiences. Additionally, Robertson was an experienced pilot, owned a Supermarine Spitfire, and was personally interested in making the film as an accurate portrayal of wartime flying. Although he was refused permission to fly in the film, his scenes stand out as a realistic depiction of operational flying.

At the end of the film, it is unclear whether Grant survives the mission or not. However, in the book Grenville does survive but becomes a prisoner of war. In the novel, much more time was devoted to the personal lives of the squadron&#x27;s personnel than in the film.

==Historical accuracy==
The Royal Air Force (RAF) did not form a unit called &quot;633 Squadron&quot; during the Second World War. However, there was a 613 Squadron, equipped with Mosquitos, and credited with an attack on a Dutch Central Population Registry building on 11 April 1944, where the Germans held their Dutch Gestapo records. Furthermore, RAF Bomber Command undertook a variety of operations against German missile production facilities similar to that of the film, including Operations Crossbow, Bellicose, and Hydra.

A multinational Allied war effort is depicted: in addition to an American central character, the film features members of the Norwegian resistance, airmen from India, New Zealand, and Australia. This reflects three historical facts: first, airmen of many nationalities joined the RAF proper; second, under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, airmen from Commonwealth air forces were frequently assigned to RAF units and; third, many squadrons belonging to Commonwealth air forces, or European governments-in-exile were under the operational control of the RAF during the war.

The film draws from many of the real operations of 617 Squadron, in particular their attack on the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; in a Norwegian fjord, although that squadron used four-engined Avro Lancaster heavy bombers to carry the Barnes Wallis designed, 5.35-ton Tallboy earthquake bombs, not the twin-engined de Havilland Mosquitos depicted. However, the Mosquito was used by 618 Squadron in connection with another of Barnes Wallis&#x27; &quot;bouncing bombs&quot;, called Highball. Though Highball was never used operationally, 618 Squadron was used as a special operations unit and is, probably, the closest match to &quot;633&quot;.

During the film, the pilots are briefed on using earthquake bombs, however the footage of the bombs arriving at the airfield clearly show the Mark I 1,800 kg (4,000 lb) Cookie. The delivery method, construction and effect of the two types of bomb are almost totally opposite. The Earthquake bomb must be released from high altitude for it to attain the necessary speed, and must have a heavy case to penetrate the ground. In the blockbuster bomb, the case is extremely light in comparison to allow maximum explosive payload to flatten buildings at or above ground level.

The single-plane raid on Gestapo Headquarters to kill Erik before he talked bore similarities to the Oslo Mosquito raid.

The original plot, however, is similar to a real RAF mission. The novel&#x27;s plot did not mention the nature of the target, only that it was a highly rated objective in Norway that could not be reached by the RAF until the Mosquito became operational. There was such a target, the molybdenum mine in Knaben, southern Norway. Typical of the mineral wealth that Hitler stated was worth the sacrifice of a significant portion of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, Knaben could produce four-fifths of Germany&#x27;s requirements for molybdenum, an important element in the production of armour plate. The mine at Knaben was too small to hit in a night raid, and sending heavy, long-range bombers in daylight would have met with disaster. Light bombers such as the Blenheim were ideal for the job, but did not have the necessary range. However, Knaben was within the range of the Mosquito, and 139 Squadron was given the task on 3 March 1943. Nine Mosquitoes were dispatched. All placed their bombs on target, though one failed to return. The target was out of action for some time and was later visited by the United States Army Air Forces″s Eighth Air Force.

The &quot;jeep&quot; partly hidden behind a bush in one of the Scottish Highlands training sequences is a post-war Land Rover, and the &quot;German halftrack&quot; is an Alvis Saracen. Land Rovers are seen in backgrounds of other scenes, such as when Grant is being driven from the airfield to be given the squadron&#x27;s new assignment. The towing tractor seen on the airfield in the early part of the film is a Fordson E1A Major first produced in 1952.

==Reception==
&quot;633 Squadron&quot; had its world premiere on 4 June 1964 at the Leicester Square Theatre in the West End of London. While critics derided the wooden acting and hackneyed plot, and the use of the miscast Mirisch Pictures contract star George Chakiris, the aerial scenes were considered spectacular and with Ron Goodwin&#x27;s music remained the main attraction. Walter Mirisch recalled that the film earned nearly its entire cost of US$1.3 million from Eady Levy receipts in the UK, making the film practically cost free when Mirisch released the film throughout the world. The great success of the film worldwide led to Mirisch making a series of UK based Oakmont Productions World War II productions shot mostly in the UK.

It was among the ten most popular films of the year at the British box office in 1964.

The film was re-released several times throughout the 1960s, sometimes on a double bill with other Mirisch features such as &quot;The Great Escape&quot;. An oddity of this double billing was that actor Angus Lennie appeared in RAF uniform in both films.

The extensive footage of the Mosquito was also of considerable interest to aviation enthusiasts. &quot;633 Squadron&quot; appears on the list of &quot;The 100 Greatest War Films&quot; voted by the UK public and is featured in the 2005 documentary of the same name.

==Influence==
The film&#x27;s climax shows the squadron flying through a deep fjord while being fired on by anti-aircraft guns. George Lucas stated that this sequence inspired the &quot;trench run&quot; sequence in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Lucas intercut sequences into &quot;Star Wars&quot; during post-production as a guide.

&quot;633 Squadron&quot; is well known in the UK for its regular appearances on television, and became almost a part of the Christmas schedule. The film had its network premiere on British television on 17 November 1970 on BBC1. It enjoyed the twelfth largest TV audience of the year. Although erroneously considered a sequel, the film &quot;Mosquito Squadron&quot; (1969) is similar to &quot;633 Squadron&quot; and influenced by it, even using footage from the original.

Frederick Smith wrote several sequel novels about 633 Squadron&#x27;s further exploits, but these were never adapted for the screen.

==Soundtrack==
The musical score of &quot;633 Squadron&quot; was written by the British composer Ron Goodwin and became very popular and well known to the public after the film&#x27;s initial release. The theme was adapted for the computer games &quot;1942&quot; and &quot;Into the Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot;. It was used for TV advertisements for an insurance company during the early 2000s. It has also become a standard part of the repertoire of the RAF bands, most recently included in an album marking the 100th Anniversary of the RAF. The RCAF Band also played the theme for their 75th anniversary. Cozy Powell did a version of the theme on his album Octopuss in 1983.

==Home media==
&quot;633 Squadron&quot; was released on Region 2 DVD on 5 May 2003. The movie is presented in Widescreen 2.35:1 format and Dolby Digital 2.0 sound. The original trailer is included as an extra.

<doc id="1197919" wikidata="Q5769546" url="?curid=1197919" title="Hirate Masahide">
<text>was a Japanese samurai who served the Oda clan for two generations. His original name was .

== Life ==
Masahide first served Oda Nobuhide. He was a talented samurai as well as skilled in sado and waka. This helped him to act as a skilled diplomat, dealing with the Ashikaga shogunate and deputies of the emperor. In 1533, a well-known regent Yamashina Tokitsugu visited Owari Province, the domain of the Oda clan. Finding the reception prepared by Masahide superb, Tokitsugu praised Masahide&#x27;s knowledge highly. Other signs of his importance as a diplomat can be found in the fact that he paid a visit to Kyoto in the name of Nobuhide to offer the funds needed to repair the Emperor&#x27;s residence.

When Nobuhide&#x27;s son Nobunaga was born in 1534, Masahide became the second highest ranking Karō as well as the tutor of the newborn heir. In 1547 Nobunaga finished his coming-of-age ceremony, and on the occasion of his first battle, Masahide served beside him. The next year, he exerted himself to establish peace between Nobuhide and his agelong rival Saitō Dōsan of Mino Province, and to arrange the marriage between Nobunaga and Dōsan&#x27;s daughter Nōhime. This move made it possible for the Oda clan to concentrate on the fight against the Imagawa clan.

Masahide served the Oda family faithfully in many ways, but he was also deeply troubled by Nobunaga&#x27;s eccentricity. After Nobuhide&#x27;s death, discord in the clan increased and so did Masahide&#x27;s concern about the future of his master.

In 1553, Masahide committed &quot;kanshi&quot; (&quot;remonstration death&quot;) to startle Nobunaga into his obligations.

<doc id="1197928" wikidata="Q114206" url="?curid=1197928" title="Woodes Rogers">
<text>Woodes Rogers ( – 15 July 1732) was an English sea captain, privateer and colonial administrator who served as the governor of the Bahamas from 1718 to 1721 and again from 1728 to 1732. He is remembered as the captain of the vessel that rescued marooned Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk, whose plight is generally believed to have inspired Daniel Defoe&#x27;s novel &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;. Rogers came from an experienced seafaring family, grew up in Poole and Bristol, and served a marine apprenticeship to a Bristol sea captain. His father, who held shares in many ships, died when Rogers was in his mid-twenties, leaving Rogers in control of the family shipping business. 

In 1707, Rogers was approached by Captain William Dampier, who sought support for a privateering voyage against the Spanish, with whom the British were at war. Rogers led the expedition, which consisted of two well-armed ships, &quot;Duke&quot; and &quot;Duchess&quot;, and was the captain of &quot;Duke&quot;. In three years, Rogers and his men went around the world, capturing several ships in the Pacific Ocean. En route, the expedition rescued Selkirk, finding him on Juan Fernández Island on 1 February 1709. When the expedition returned to England in October 1711, Rogers had circumnavigated the globe, while retaining his original ships and most of his men, and the investors in the expedition doubled their money. 

The expedition made Rogers a national hero, but his brother was killed and Rogers was badly wounded in fights in the Pacific. On his return, he was successfully sued by his crew on the grounds that they had not received their fair share of the expedition profits, and Rogers was forced into bankruptcy. He wrote of his maritime experiences in the book &quot;A Cruising Voyage Round the World&quot;, which sold well, in part due to public fascination at Selkirk&#x27;s rescue. Rogers was twice appointed Governor of the Bahamas, where he succeeded in warding off threats from the Spanish, and in ridding the colony of pirates. His first term as governor was financially ruinous, and on his return to England, he was imprisoned for debt. During his second term as governor, Rogers died in Nassau aged about 53.

==Early life==
Woodes Rogers was the eldest son and heir of Woods Rogers, a successful merchant captain. Woodes Rogers spent part of his childhood in Poole, England, where he likely attended the local school; his father, who owned shares in many ships, was often away nine months of the year with the Newfoundland fishing fleet. Sometime between 1690 and 1696, Captain Rogers moved his family to Bristol. In November 1697, Woodes Rogers was apprenticed to Bristol mariner John Yeamans, to learn the profession of a sailor. At 18, Rogers was somewhat old to be starting a seven-year apprenticeship. His biographer, Brian Little, suggests that this might have been a way for the newcomers to become part of Bristol maritime society, as well as making it possible for Woodes Rogers to become a freeman, or voting citizen, of the city. Little also suggests that it is likely that Rogers gained his maritime experience with Yeamans&#x27; ship on the Newfoundland fleet.

Rogers completed his apprenticeship in November 1704. The following January, Rogers married Sarah Whetstone, daughter of Rear Admiral Sir William Whetstone. In 1706, Captain Rogers died at sea, leaving his ships and business to his son Woodes. Between 1706 and the end of 1708, Woodes and Sarah Rogers had a son and two daughters.

==Privateering expedition==

===Preparation and the early voyage===
The War of the Spanish Succession started in 1702, during which England&#x27;s main maritime foes were France and Spain, and a number of Bristol ships were given letters of marque, allowing them to strike against enemy shipping. At least four vessels in which Rogers had an ownership interest were granted the letters. One, &quot;Whetstone Galley&quot;, named for Rogers&#x27; father-in-law, received the letters before being sent to Africa to begin a voyage in the Atlantic slave trade (Rogers would continue to engage in slave trading for the rest of his life). The ship did not reach Africa, but was captured by the French. Rogers suffered other losses against the French, although he does not record their extent in his book. He turned to privateering as a means of recouping these losses.

In late 1707, Rogers was approached by William Dampier, a navigator and friend of Rogers&#x27; father, who proposed a privateering expedition against the Spanish. This was a desperate move on the part of Captain Dampier to save his career. Dampier had recently returned from leading a two-ship privateering expedition into the Pacific, which culminated in a series of mutinies before both ships finally sank due to Dampier&#x27;s error in not having the hulls properly protected against worms before leaving port. Unaware of this, Rogers agreed. Financing was provided by many in the Bristol community, including Thomas Goldney II of the Quaker Goldney family and Thomas Dover, who would become president of the voyage council and Rogers&#x27; father in law. Commanding two frigates, &quot;Duke&quot; and &quot;Duchess&quot;, and captaining the first, Rogers spent three years circumnavigating the globe. The ships departed Bristol on 1 August 1708. Dampier was aboard as Rogers&#x27; sailing master.

Rogers encountered various problems along the way. Forty of the Bristol crew deserted or were dismissed, and he spent a month in Ireland recruiting replacements and having the vessels prepared for sea. Many crew members were Dutch, Danish, or other foreigners. Some of the crew mutinied after Rogers refused to let them plunder a neutral Swedish vessel. When the mutiny was put down, he had the leader flogged, put in irons, and sent to England aboard another ship. The less culpable mutineers were given lighter punishments, such as reduced rations. The ships intended to force the chilly Drake Passage off the tip of South America, but expedition leaders soon realised that they were short of warm clothing and alcohol, which was then believed to warm those exposed to cold. Considering the latter the more important problem, the expedition made a stop at Tenerife to stock up on the local wine, and later sewed the ships&#x27; blankets into cold weather gear. The ships experienced a difficult inter-oceanic passage; they were forced to almost 62° South latitude, which, according to Rogers, &quot;for ought we know is the furthest that any one has yet been to the southward&quot;. At their furthest south, they were closer to as-yet-undiscovered Antarctica than to South America.

===Rescue of Selkirk and raids on the Spanish===
Rogers stocked his ships with limes to fend off scurvy, a practice not universally accepted at that time. After the ships reached the Pacific Ocean, their provisions of limes were exhausted and seven men died of the vitamin deficiency disease. Dampier was able to guide the ships to little-known Juan Fernández Island to replenish supplies of fresh produce. On 1 February 1709, as they neared the island, the sailors spotted a fire ashore and feared that it might be a shore party from a Spanish vessel. The next morning Rogers sent a party ashore and discovered that the fire was from Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk, who had been stranded there four years previously. Selkirk was to become an inspiration for the classic novel &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, written by Rogers&#x27; friend, Daniel Defoe. Rogers found Selkirk to be &quot;wild-looking&quot; and &quot;wearing goatskins&quot;, noting in his journal, &quot;He had with him his clothes and bedding, with a firelock, some powder, bullets and tobacco, a hatchet, a knife, a kettle, a Bible and books.&quot; Selkirk, who had been part of the ship&#x27;s crew that abandoned Dampier after losing confidence in his leadership, was now more than willing to join a flotilla that included his old commodore as ship&#x27;s pilot. Selkirk served as a mate aboard the &quot;Duke&quot;, and was later given command of one of the prize ships taken by the expedition.

After leaving Juan Fernández on 14 February 1709, the expedition captured and looted a number of small vessels, and launched an attack on the town of Guayaquil, today located in Ecuador. When Rogers attempted to negotiate with the governor, the townsfolk secreted their valuables. Rogers was able to get a modest ransom for the town, but some crew members were so dissatisfied that they dug up the recently dead hoping to find items of value. This led to sickness on board ship, of which six men died. The expedition lost contact with one of the captured ships, which was under the command of Simon Hatley. The other vessels searched for Hatley&#x27;s ship, but to no avail—Hatley and his men were captured by the Spanish. On a subsequent voyage to the Pacific, Hatley would emulate Selkirk by becoming the centre of an event which would be immortalised in literature. His ship beset by storms, Hatley shot an albatross in the hope of better winds, an episode memorialised by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

The crew of the vessels became increasingly discontented, and Rogers and his officers feared another mutiny. This tension was dispelled by the expedition&#x27;s capture of a rich prize off the coast of Mexico: the Spanish vessel &quot;Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación y Desengaño&quot;. Rogers sustained a wound to the face in the battle. While &quot;Duke&quot; and &quot;Duchess&quot; were successful in capturing that vessel, they failed to capture &quot;Encarnación&quot; companion, a well-armed galleon, &quot;Nuestra Señora de Begoña&quot;, which made its escape after damaging both vessels. Rogers only reluctantly agreed to giving the inexperienced Captain Dover command of &quot;Encarnación&quot;, a decision that may have been eased by naming Selkirk as its sailing master. The privateers, accompanied by their two prizes, limped across the Pacific Ocean. The expedition was able to resupply at Guam, which, though governed by the Spanish, extended a cordial welcome to the privateers.

===Homeward voyage===
The ships then went to the Dutch port of Batavia in what is now Indonesia, where Rogers underwent surgery to remove a musket ball from the roof of his mouth, and the expedition disposed of the less seaworthy of the two Spanish prizes. Dealing with the Dutch there constituted a violation of the British East India Company&#x27;s monopoly. When the ships finally dropped anchor in the River Thames on 14 October 1711, a legal battle ensued, with the investors paying the East India Company £6,000 (about £ at today&#x27;s values) as settlement for their claim for breach of monopoly, about four per cent of what Rogers brought back. The investors approximately doubled their money, while Rogers gained £1,600 (now worth perhaps £) from a voyage which disfigured him and cost him his brother, who was killed in a battle in the Pacific. The money was probably less than he could have made at home, and was entirely absorbed by the debts his family had incurred in his absence. The long voyage and the capture of the Spanish ship made Rogers a national hero. Rogers was the first Englishman, in circumnavigating the globe, to have his original ships and most of his crew survive.

After his voyage, he wrote an account of it, titled &quot;A Cruising Voyage Round the World&quot;. Edward Cooke, an officer aboard &quot;Duchess&quot;, also wrote a book, &quot;A Voyage to the South Sea and Round the World&quot;, and beat Rogers to print by several months. Rogers&#x27; book was much more successful, with many readers fascinated by the account of Selkirk&#x27;s rescue, which Cooke had slighted. Among those interested in Selkirk&#x27;s adventure was Daniel Defoe, who appears to have read about it, and fictionalised the story as &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;.

While Rogers&#x27; book enjoyed financial success, it had a practical purpose—to aid British navigators and possible colonists. Much of Rogers&#x27; introduction is devoted to advocacy for the South Seas trade. Rogers notes that had there been a British colony in the South Seas, he would not have had to worry about food supplies for his crew. A third of Rogers&#x27; book is devoted to detailed descriptions of the places that he explored, with special emphasis on &quot;such [places] as may be of most use for enlarging our trade&quot;. He describes the area of the River Plate in detail because it lay &quot;within the limits of the South Sea Company&quot;, whose schemes had not yet burst into financial scandal. Rogers&#x27; book was carried by such South Pacific navigators as Admiral George Anson and privateering captains John Clipperton and George Shelvocke.

==Governor and later life==

===Financial difficulties and the Bahamas proposal===

Rogers encountered financial problems on his return. Sir William Whetstone had died, and Rogers, having failed to recoup his business losses through privateering, was forced to sell his Bristol home to support his family. He was successfully sued by a group of over 200 of his crew, who stated that they had not received their fair share of the expedition profits. The profits from his book were not enough to overcome these setbacks, and he was forced into bankruptcy. His wife gave birth to their fourth child a year after his return—a boy who died in infancy—and Woodes and Sarah Rogers soon permanently separated.

Rogers decided the way out of his financial difficulty was to lead another expedition, this time against pirates. In 1713, Rogers led what was ostensibly an expedition to purchase slaves in Madagascar and take them to the Dutch East Indies, this time with the permission of the British East India Company. Rogers&#x27; secondary purpose was to gather details on the pirates of Madagascar, hoping to destroy or reform them, and colonise Madagascar on a future trip. Rogers collected information regarding pirates and their vessels near the island. Finding that a large number of the pirates had gone native, he persuaded many of them to sign a petition to Queen Anne asking her for clemency. While Rogers&#x27; expedition was profitable, when it returned to London in 1715, the British East India Company vetoed the idea of a colonial expedition to Madagascar, believing a colony was a greater threat to its monopoly than a few pirates. Accordingly, Rogers turned his sights from Madagascar to the West Indies. His connections included several of the advisers to the new king, George I, who had succeeded Queen Anne in 1714, and Rogers was able to forge an agreement for a company to manage the Bahamas, which were infested with pirates, in exchange for a share of the colony&#x27;s profits.

At the time, according to the Governor of Bermuda, the Bahamas were &quot;without any face or form of Government&quot; and the colony was a &quot;sink or nest of infamous rascals&quot;. Until Rogers obtained his commission, the islands had been nominally governed by absentee Lords Proprietor, who did little except appoint a new, powerless governor when the position fell vacant. Under the agreement that underlay Rogers&#x27; commission, the Lords Proprietor leased their rights for a token sum to Rogers&#x27; company for twenty-one years.

On 5 September 1717, a proclamation was issued announcing clemency for all piratical offences, provided that those seeking what became known as the &quot;King&#x27;s Pardon&quot; surrendered not later than 5 September 1718. Colonial governors and deputy governors were authorised to grant the pardon. Rogers was officially appointed &quot;Captain General and Governor in Chief&quot; by George I on 6 January 1718. He did not leave immediately for his new bailiwick, but spent several months preparing the expedition, which included seven ships, 100 soldiers, 130 colonists, and supplies ranging from food for the expedition members and ships&#x27; crews to religious pamphlets to give to the pirates, whom Rogers believed would respond to spiritual teachings. On 22 April 1718, the expedition, accompanied by three Royal Navy vessels, sailed out of the Thames.

===First term===
The expedition arrived on 24 July 1718, surprising and trapping a ship commanded by pirate Charles Vane. After negotiations failed, Vane used a captured French vessel as a fireship in an attempt to ram the naval vessels. The attempt failed, but the naval vessels were forced out of the west end of Nassau harbour, giving Vane&#x27;s crew an opportunity to raid the town and secure the best local pilot. Vane and his men then escaped in a small sloop via the harbour&#x27;s narrow east entrance. The pirates had evaded the trap, but Nassau and New Providence Island were in Rogers&#x27; hands.

At the time, the island&#x27;s population consisted of about 200 former pirates and several hundred fugitives who had escaped from nearby Spanish colonies. Rogers organised a government, granted the King&#x27;s Pardon to those former pirates on the island who had not yet accepted it, and started to rebuild the island&#x27;s fortifications, which had fallen into decrepitude under pirate domination. Less than a month into his residence on New Providence, Rogers was faced with a double threat: Vane wrote, threatening to join with Edward Teach (better known as Blackbeard) to retake the island, and Rogers learned that the Spanish also planned to drive the British out of the Bahamas.

Rogers&#x27; expedition suffered further setbacks. An unidentified disease killed almost 100 of his expedition members, while leaving the long-term residents nearly untouched. Two of the three navy vessels, having no orders to remain, left for New York. Ships sent to Havana to conciliate the Spanish governor there never arrived, their crew revolting and becoming pirates mid-voyage. Finally, the third naval vessel left in mid-September, its commander promising to return in three weeks—a promise he had no intention of keeping. Work on rebuilding the island&#x27;s fortifications proceeded slowly, with the locals showing a disinclination to work.

On 14 September 1718, Rogers received word that Vane was at Green Turtle Cay near Abaco, about north of Nassau. Some of the pardoned pirates on New Providence took boats to join Vane, and Rogers decided to send two ex-pirate captains, Benjamin Hornigold and John Cockram, with a crew to gather intelligence, and, if possible, to bring Vane to battle. As the weeks passed, and hopes of their return dimmed, Rogers declared martial law and set all inhabitants to work on rebuilding the island&#x27;s fortifications. Finally, the former pirates returned. They had failed to find an opportunity to kill Vane or bring him to battle, but had captured one ship and a number of pirate captives. Captain Hornigold was then sent to recapture the ships and crews who had gone pirate en route to Havana. He returned with ten prisoners, including captain John Auger, and three corpses. On 9 December 1718, Rogers brought the ten men captured by Hornigold to trial. Nine were convicted, and Rogers had eight hanged three days later, reprieving the ninth on hearing he was of good family. One of the condemned, Thomas Morris, quipped as he climbed the gallows, &quot;We have a good governor, but a harsh one.&quot; The executions so cowed the populace that when, shortly after Christmas, several residents plotted to overthrow Rogers and restore the island to piracy, the conspirators attracted little support. Rogers had them flogged, then released as harmless.

On 16 March 1719 Rogers learned that Spain and Britain were at war again. He redoubled his efforts to repair the island&#x27;s fortifications, buying vital supplies on credit in the hope of later being reimbursed by the expedition&#x27;s investors. The Spanish sent an assault fleet against Nassau in May, but when the fleet&#x27;s commodore learned that the French (now Britain&#x27;s ally) had captured Pensacola, he directed the fleet there instead. This gave Rogers time to continue to fortify and supply New Providence, and in February 1720 the Spaniards finally arrived in Nassau. Two ex-slave sentries alerted the town to the presence of the &quot;Delicia&quot; of 32-guns, and the British frigate HMS &quot;Flamborough&quot; of 24-guns under Captain Johnathan Hildesley as well as 500 ready waiting militia, many of them ex-pirates helped cause the Spanish withdrawal.

The year 1720 brought an end to external threats to Rogers&#x27; rule. With Spain and Britain at peace again, the Spanish made no further move against the Bahamas. Vane never returned, having been shipwrecked and captured in the Bay Islands—a year later, he was hanged in Jamaica. This did not end Rogers&#x27; problems as governor. Overextended from financing New Providence&#x27;s defences, he received no assistance from Britain, and merchants refused to give him further credit. His health suffered, and he spent six weeks in Charleston, South Carolina, hoping to recuperate. Instead, he was wounded in a duel with Captain John Hildesley of HMS &quot;Flamborough&quot;, a duel caused by disputes between the two on New Providence. Troubled by the lack of support and communication from London, Rogers set sail for Britain in March 1721. He arrived three months later to find that a new governor had been appointed, and his company had been liquidated. Personally liable for the obligations he had contracted at Nassau, he was imprisoned for debt.

===Activities in England, second term, and death===
With both the government and his former partners refusing to honour his debts, Rogers was released from debtor&#x27;s prison only when his creditors took pity on him and absolved him of his debts. Even so, Rogers wrote that he was &quot;perplexed with the melancholy prospect of [his] affairs&quot;. In 1722 or 1723, Rogers was approached by a man writing a history of piracy, and supplied him with information. The resulting work, &quot;A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates&quot;, published under the pseudonym Captain Charles Johnson, was an enormous hit on both sides of the Atlantic, and catapulted Rogers for the second time to the status of a national hero. With public attention focused on him again, Rogers was successful in 1726 in petitioning the king for financial redress. Not only did King George I grant him a pension, retroactive to 1721, but the king&#x27;s son and successor, George II, reappointed him as governor on 22 October 1728.

The Bahamas did not come under external threat during Rogers&#x27; second term, but the reappointed governor had difficulties. Still seeking to bolster the island&#x27;s defences, Rogers sought imposition of a local tax. The assembly, which had been instituted in Rogers&#x27; absence, objected, and Rogers responded by dissolving it. The governmental battle exhausted Rogers, who again went to Charleston in early 1731 in an attempt to recover his health. Though he returned in July 1731, he never truly regained his health, and died in Nassau on 15 July 1732.

A harbour-side street in Nassau is named for Rogers. &quot;Piracy expelled, commerce restored&quot; remained the motto of the Bahamas until the islands gained independence in 1973.

<doc id="1197932" wikidata="Q5611111" url="?curid=1197932" title="Group 9 Rugby League">
<text>Group 9 is a rugby league competition based in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Australia, and surrounding areas. The competition is played in six grades, with these being Under 16s, Under 18s, Women&#x27;s Tackle, Women&#x27;s League-Tag, Reserve-Grade and First-Grade.

Currently a home and away season consisting of sixteen rounds is played. The best four teams then play-off according to the Page–McIntyre system, culminating in the Group 9 Grand final, which is traditionally held at McDonald&#x27;s Park in Wagga Wagga.

== History ==
===1920s–1950s: Foundations===
Group 9 Rugby League was formed at a meeting at the Grand Hotel, Harden, following a four-hour meeting on 26 April 1923, which finished at 12:20 am the following morning. The foundation clubs were Harden, Murrumburrah, Binalong, Young, Wambanumba, Monteagle, Bendick Murrell, Cootamundra, Junee, Wagga Wagga, Gundagai, Tumut, Adelong, West Wyalong, Barmedman, Griffith, Temora, Leeton, Ariah Park and Mildil.

Competition in the early years of Group 9 consisted of various challenge type matches, and it was not until 1933 that regular inter-club competition commenced.

===1960s–1980s: Murrumbidgee Breakaway and Reformation===

In 1966, the rebel Murrumbidgee Rugby League broke away from the competition due to years of competition boundary disputes, leading to four years of reshuffled competitions from 1967 to 1970. The Murrumbidgee Rugby League was renamed to Riverina Zone 3 in 1969-70.

Given that a number of the Group 9 clubs (including Gundagai, Junee, Tumut) joined the five clubs who broke away from Group 20 to form the new competition (Batlow, Tumbarumba, Turvey Park, Wagga Magpies and Wagga Kangaroos), Group 9 was severely weakened in the 1966 season. 

Therefore, the remaining Group 9 clubs were divided up and put into neighbouring competitions. Barmedman, Temora and West Wyalong joined the Group 20 during this period, leading to the 9/20 name, while Harden, Young and Wyangala Dam joined Group 8. To honour the additions of the clubs, the competitions were renamed to Group 9/20, Group 8/9 respectively.

In 1970, when the Group 9 body regained control of football in the district and the Murrumbidgee Rugby League/Riverina Zone 3 returned to the competition, West Wyalong remained in Group 20, while Harden, Temora and Young returned from their respective competitions.

=== 1990s–present: Absorption of Group 13, Peak and Decline===

After the Group 13 Rugby League competition collapsed in 1991, the Albury Blues (renamed Greater Southern Rams upon entry due to Tumut already being the Blues), Wagga Brothers, a merged outfit from Adelong and Batlow, and Tumbarumba, joined the competition.

However, the competition declined from a peak of 14 clubs in the late 1990s to 9 clubs in 2022. Clubs to leave in this period included Adelong-Batlow (folded), Harden-Murrumburrah (George Tooke Shield), Tumbarumba (folded, then joined Murray Cup) and Cootamundra (George Tooke Shield). Turvey Park and Wagga Magpies also merged in 2005 to form the South City Bulls.

Albury Thunder, the successor to Greater Southern Rams and Lavington Panthers, won a threepeat of titles from 2012 to 2014.

Group 9&#x27;s crisis became even more apparent following powerhouse Junee&#x27;s decision not to field a First Grade team in 2021 and 2022. However, this strategy paid off as the club won the Reserve Grade title in 2022, with plans to return to First Grade football in 2023. Their return to the premier grade was offset by the loss of the Wagga Brothers to the exact same fate for the 2023 season.

Group Nine has run two under-age competitions since 1971. Clubs in the older division compete for the Weissel Cup. This is not to be confused with the &quot;Weissel Medal&quot;, an award for the First Grade Player of the Year. Both awards are named in honour of the late Eric Weissel, an Australian representative who played and coached several clubs in the region.

<text>Apache Flex, formerly Adobe Flex, is a software development kit (SDK) for the development and deployment of cross-platform rich web applications based on the Adobe Flash platform. Initially developed by Macromedia and then acquired by Adobe Systems, Adobe donated Flex to the Apache Software Foundation in 2011 and it was promoted to a top-level project in December 2012.

The Flex 3 SDK was released under the MPL-1.1 license in 2008. Consequently, Flex applications can be developed using standard Integrated development environments (IDEs), such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, the free and open source IDE FlashDevelop, as well as the proprietary Adobe Flash Builder.

In 2014, the Apache Software Foundation started a new project called FlexJS to cross-compile ActionScript 3 to JavaScript to enable it to run on browsers that do not support Adobe Flash Player and on devices that do not support the Adobe AIR runtime. In 2017, FlexJS was renamed to Apache Royale. The Apache Software Foundation describes the current iteration of Apache Royale as an open-source frontend technology that allows a developer to code in ActionScript 3 and MXML and target web, mobile devices and desktop devices on Apache Cordova all at once. Apache Royale is currently in beta development stage.

== Overview ==
Flex uses MXML to define UI layout and other non-visual static aspects, ActionScript to address dynamic aspects and as code-behind, and requires Adobe AIR or Flash Player at runtime to run the application.

== Versions ==

=== Macromedia Flex 1.0 and 1.5 ===
Macromedia targeted the enterprise application development market with its initial releases of Flex 1.0 and 1.5. The company offered the technology at a price around US$15,000 per CPU. Required for deployment, the Java EE application server compiled MXML and ActionScript on-the-fly into Flash applications (binary SWF files). Each server license included 5 licenses for the Flex Builder IDE.

=== Adobe Flex 2 ===

Adobe significantly changed the licensing model for the Flex product line with the release of Flex 2. The core Flex 2 SDK, consisting of the command-line compilers and the complete class library of user interface components and utilities, was made available as a free download. Complete Flex applications can be built and deployed solely with the Flex 2 SDK, which contains no limitations or restrictions compared to the same SDK included with the Flex Builder IDE.

Adobe based the new version of Flex Builder on the open source Eclipse platform. The company released two versions of Flex Builder 2, Standard and Professional. The Professional version includes the Flex Charting Components library.

Enterprise-oriented services remain available through Flex Data Services 2. This server component provides data synchronization, data push, publish-subscribe and automated testing. Unlike Flex 1.0 and 1.5, Flex Data Services is not required for the deployment of Flex applications.

Coinciding with the release of Flex 2, Adobe introduced a new version of the ActionScript programming language, known as Actionscript 3, reflecting the latest ECMAScript specification. The use of ActionScript 3 and Flex 2 requires version 9 or later of the Flash Player runtime. Flash Player 9 incorporated a new and more robust virtual machine for running the new ActionScript 3.

Flex was the first Macromedia product to be re-branded under the Adobe name.

=== Adobe Flex 3 ===
On April 26, 2007, Adobe announced their intent to release the Flex 3 SDK (which excludes the Flex Builder IDE and the LiveCycle Data Services) under the terms of the Mozilla Public License. 
Adobe released the first beta of Flex 3, codenamed &quot;Moxie&quot;, in June 2007. Major enhancements include integration with the new versions of Adobe&#x27;s Creative Suite products, support for AIR (Adobe&#x27;s new desktop application runtime), and the addition of profiling and refactoring tools to the Flex Builder IDE.

=== Adobe Flash Builder and Flex 4 ===
Adobe released Flex 4.0 (code named Gumbo) on March 22, 2010. The Flex 4 development environment is called Adobe Flash Builder, formerly known as Adobe Flex Builder.

Some themes that have been mentioned by Adobe and have been incorporated into Flex 4 are as follows:

* Design in Mind: The framework has been designed for continuous collaboration between designers and developers.
* Accelerated Development: Be able to take application development from conception to reality quickly.
* Horizontal Platform Improvements: Compiler performance, language enhancements, BiDirectional components, enhanced text (Flex 4 includes the new Text Layout Framework).
* Full Support for Adobe Flash Player 10 and above.
* Broadening Horizons: Finding ways to make a framework lighter, supporting more deployment runtimes, runtime MXML.
* Simpler skinning than the previous versions.
* Integration with Adobe Flash Catalyst.
* Custom templates

Flash Builder is available in two versions: Standard and Premium, the premium adds the following features;

* Testing tools
* Memory and performance profilers
* An automated testing harness to connect to all the leading testing tools

* command-line build capability

=== Adobe Flash Builder 4.5 and Flex 4.5 ===
May 3, 2011, Adobe shipped Flash Builder 4.5 copying Flex 4.5 (SDK only) which delivers full support for building Flex and ActionScript applications for Google Android, as well as support for building ActionScript applications for BlackBerry Tablet OS and Apple iOS. An update to Flash Builder 4.5 and Flex 4.5 adds support for building Flex applications for BlackBerry Tablet OS and Apple iOS.

Flex 4.5 SDK delivers many new components and capabilities, along with integrated support in Flash Builder 4.5 and Flash Catalyst CS 5.5. With the Adobe Flex 4.5 SDK which is governed by three main goals:

* Allow developers to use Flex for multiscreen application development

<doc id="1197942" wikidata="Q6323503" url="?curid=1197942" title="K. Kelappan">
<text>Koyapalli Kelappan (24 August 1889 – 7 October 1971) was an Indian politician, independence activist, educationist and journalist. During the Indian independence movement, he was the lead figure of Indian National Congress in Kerala and was popularly known as &quot;Kerala Gandhi&quot;. After Indian independence, he held various seats in Gandhian organisations. He was the co-founder and the first president of the Nair Service Society and was also the founder of Kerala Kshetra Samrakshana Samiti (Temple Protection Movement).

==Early life==
Kelappan was born in the small village of Muchukunnu at Koyilandy in Kozhikode, Kerala as the son of Thenpoyil Kanaran Nair, a Clerk at Court and Koyapalli Kunjamma. Kelappan got his family name, &quot;Koyapalli&quot;, through matrilineal succession.

He studied in Kozhikode and Madras and graduated from the University of Madras before starting his career as a teacher at St. Berchmans High School, Changanassery. Kelappan was the founding President of the Nair Service Society and later became the principal of a school run by the society.

==As reformer==
He fought for social reforms on one hand and the British on the other. He fought relentlessly against untouchability and caste-based discrimination. Along with K. Kumar, he became the earliest in Kerala to remove the suffix to his name that implied caste-status. He was called Kerala Gandhi.

Kelappan labored incessantly for the equality of all sections of the people. He was a major influence on the Vaikom Satyagraha movement and later led the Guruvayur Satyagraha in 1932. During Gandhi&#x27;s visit to Travancore to commemorate the Temple Entry Proclamation, he seconded the most critical resolution re-establishing faith in Gandhiji&#x27;s leadership and the forward steps to be taken in conformity with the Gandhian approach to translate the spirit of the move for social equality. The resolution was presented by K. Kumar of Travancore, a veteran reformer and one of the leaders of the Vaikom Satyagraha who later came to be forgotten by people and historians.

==Role post independence==
After independence he left the Congress Party. He joined the Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party and was elected to Parliament from the Ponnani Lok Sabha seat in 1952. At the end of his term, he left active politics and became a Sarvodaya worker and was actively associated with Bhoodan Movement in Kerala.

Kelappan helped in starting &quot;Mathrubhumi&quot; and was its editor for several years. He worked for the unification of Kerala into a new linguistic state. He was also the president of many Gandhian organizations in Kerala including Kerala Sarvodaya Sangh, Kerala Gandhi Smarak Nidhi, Kerala Sarvodaya Mandal, and Gandhi Peace Foundation, Calicut.

Kelappan opposed the formation of Muslim-majority Malappuram District in Kerala arguing that it would create a &#x27;mini Pakistan&#x27;. He was involved in the Tali Temple Movement which aimed at a temple resurrection near a mosque in Angadippuram, in Malapppuram which caused some communal tensions. Kelappan was instrumental in the Tali Temple Movement. But before its completion, Kelappan died on October 7, 1971. The temple built with his support stands alongside the mosque, symbolizing harmony among different communities.

==Awards and recognition==
In his honor India Post released a Commemorative stamp in 1990.

<text>Whare Ra is a building in Havelock North in the Hawkes Bay region of New Zealand. The building housed the New Zealand branch of the magical order the Stella Matutina. It was designed and overseen by James Chapman-Taylor, a senior member of the order.

Whare Ra was one of the last surviving temples that could trace its lineage back to the original Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. It was the only temple to operate in a permanent, purpose-built building.

==Early preparations==
The foundations for the Order in New Zealand were laid by Reginald Gardiner (1872-1959). Born in New South Wales, Australia, he was the son of an Anglican vicar and brother of the Anglican vicar of St Luke&#x27;s Church, Havelock North, New Zealand, where he settled in 1907. He formed about him an artistic, cultural and spiritual group whose activities became known as the &quot;Havelock Work&quot;, and produced a publication called &quot;The Forerunner&quot;. The Havelock Work grew and in time the group became known as the Society of the Southern Cross.

In 1910, Revd. Father J. Fitzgerald travelled to New Zealand on Church business, and was introduced to the group. He was suitably impressed, and prior to his return to Britain, promised to stay in touch and to do what he could to help. One of the last G.H. Chiefs of the Order later recollected:

In due course he wrote that if further progress were to be made, that certain people of his acquaintance would need to come out from England.

In 1912 Dr. Robert Felkin, Chief of the Order of the Stella Matutina arrived, assisted by his appointment as Inspector of the Australasian Colleges of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia by William Wynn Westcott, one of the original Chiefs of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Supreme Magus of the S.R.I.A.

==Founding of the Smaragdum Thallasses Temple No 49==

Travelling with his wife and daughter, he initiated a group of twenty-four members into the Order, twelve of whom were advanced to the &quot;Second Order&quot;. A sizeable piece of land on Tauroa Road in Havelock North was donated, and a home for the Order constructed, which they named “Whare Ra”, or House of the Sun. It was in the basement of this house that the large Temple was built.

During their three-month stay, sufficient members had been initiated to make a beginning, and the building commissioned and sufficiently advanced to enable its Consecration. Before leaving New Zealand to return to England, a Warrant was issued establishing the Smaragdum Thallasses Temple No. 49 of the Order of the Stella Matutina. The three Chiefs that appeared on the Warrant were Reginald Gardiner, Mason Chambers, and probably Harold Large (or possibly Thomas Chambers).

A trust had been set up to manage the monetary affairs of the Order, with the trustees being Mason Chambers, his wife Margaret Chambers, the younger John Chambers, and Reginald Gardiner. The trust deed stated that the group was formed:

John von Dadelszen, who spent most of his adult life in the Order, and who had been a Temple Warden and one of its last Chiefs, stated that the Order:

A contemporary of John von Dadelszen, and fellow Chief Archie Shaw, wrote of the role of the three Chiefs, in his 1960 address to members:

==The Work==
Students who had been initiated into the Order had to follow a curriculum of activities.

Topics studied included comparative religion, mythology, geomancy, astrology, tarot, cabala, alchemy and tatwas.

After a minimum prescribed period, and having passed appropriate examinations, a student would then progress to the next grade, and receive another “Advancement” through a ceremonial experience. In all, there was one initiation ceremony and 10 advancement ceremonies used in the Order, although arguably the last one or possible two were reserved for a small number of very senior members and leaders of the group.

The Order was really two orders, an “Outer” or “First Order” where basic disciplines and rudimentary knowledge were taught, and an “Inner” or “Second Order” where in essence the member received advanced teachings to enable them to become effectively priests, capable of making their own connection with the divine. Admission to the Second Order was by invitation only.

The “Work” of the Second Order took the theory and knowledge taught in the First Order, and turned it into ceremonial and ritual with the intent of strengthening the link with the divine, personal spiritual enlightenment, and the advancement of life in general.

The core content of the study materials and the methods used by members of the Smaragdum Thallasses included almost all (if not all) of the original content of the Golden Dawn, verbatim. However, some of the wording in the initiation and advancement ceremonies were changed by the Stella Matutina, which the Smaragdum Thallasses came out of, minimising masonic style references but by and large keeping the structure and intent the same as the original.

After time, and with decades of experience applying the methods of the Golden Dawn, the Smaragdum Thallasses also produce a plethora of new material unique to its membership. A natural renaissance of knowledge and expertise unfolded.

==The temple prospers==
In 1916, at the invitation of the members of the New Zealand branch, and with the offer of life tenancy of “Whare Ra”, Felkin and his family returned to New Zealand for good. He issued a new constitution for the Order of the Stella Matutina in the same year, informing members that the Mother Temple of the Order was now in New Zealand. The Order, governed by three ruling Chiefs, prospered under their leadership. By the time of the death of Felkin in 1926, it had a very active membership and was well established – its membership included two Anglican Bishops, General Sir Arthur Russell, Lord Jellicoe, Governor General of New Zealand, members of Parliament, and local dignitaries and officials.

Entrance to the Temple, by the candidate for initiation, was via a secret staircase behind a wardrobe, located in Felkin&#x27;s surgery.

In 1931 a devastating earthquake hit the area, and many buildings were levelled or damaged. With its fortress like construction, Whare Ra was unscathed.

Gardiner replaced Felkin as a Greatly Honoured Chief of the Order, and with Mrs and Miss Felkin, ruled for a further stable period of 33 years.

In its heyday during the 1930s, it has been estimated that its membership numbered some 300 men and woman, and during its 60-plus-year history that approximately 400–500 people had been initiated. It was during this time that the Temple distanced itself from the affairs of the Stella Matutina in Britain, and renamed itself simply the Order of Smaragdum Thallasses.

In 1949, in the last issue of &quot;The Lantern&quot;, Mrs. Felkin stated:

In the Annual Report for year ending 31 December 1959, the Order&#x27;s Cancellarius reported that:

In 1959 Gardiner and Mrs Felkin died, followed by Miss Felkin three years later.

During the late 1960s, Frater Albertus of the Paracelsus Research Society visited Whare Ra. He reported this visit to members of the society in one of their bulletins.

==Decline==
By 1978 it was clear that Whare Ra was a spent force. On 24 August 1978 a letter was circulated to members announcing the closure:

Much to the regret of many esoteric historians, they burnt most of the group&#x27;s regalia, Temple furnishings and records. Some things survived, including the Temple&#x27;s pillars, the two sphinxes which flanked either side of the dais steps. Many copies of the rituals and lectures were passed on and preserved.

Whare Ra is now in private hands, and has been registered as a Category I protected building by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.
