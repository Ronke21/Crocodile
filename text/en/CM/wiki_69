<text>Wincenty Kadłubek (; 1150 – 8 March 1223) was a Polish Catholic prelate and professed Cistercian who served as the Bishop of Kraków from 1208 until his resignation in 1218. His episcopal mission was to reform the diocesan priests to ensure their holiness and invigorate the faithful and cultivate greater participation in ecclesial affairs on their part. Wincenty was much more than just a bishop; he was a leading scholar in Poland from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. He was also a lawyer, historian, church reformer, monk, magister, and the father of Polish culture and national identity. 

The process of his canonization proved quite slow despite the initial momentum to see him proclaimed as a saint. The cause languished for several centuries until 1764 when Pope Clement XIII beatified him.

==Early life and education==
Little is known about Kadłubek&#x27;s early life, but we do know he was born around 1160 to parents of elite status. Eleventh and Twelfth century Poland was a complicated and turbulent place, shaping Kadłubek&#x27;s works and life. This period of time is characterized by territorial divisions between branches of the Piast family and civil war. 

Kadłubek first studied in Stopnica before he studied at the cathedral school in Kraków. It was while at the latter that he studied under Mateusz Cholewa, who encouraged Kadłubek to be sent abroad for further studies. He completed his studies in 1185 and returned home where he was ordained to the priesthood before 1189 and served as the provost for the Sandomierz Cathedral; some sources suggest that he served as the principal of the cathedral school in Kraków.  He studied in France at the university of Paris as well as at the university of Bologna. Some sources suggest that he met the future Pope Innocent III at Bologna when the two were students and it was further said he once encountered John of Salisbury.

Kadłubek was considerably educated for the time period. He was knowledgeable of medieval and classical literature, spoke Greek, French, and Latin, and had a meticulous knowledge of Roman and Canon law. At the time, you could only learn about Roman and Canon law at schools in Paris and Bologna. He was the first known Polish lawyer to contribute to Polish legal scholarship. Kadłubek&#x27;s &quot;Chronica Polonorum&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of Poles&quot;) confirms he was a lawyer. Through this chronicle, he was the first Polish person to chronicle Polish history, making him a cardinal source for the early medieval history of Poland.

== Time as a bishop ==
Kadłubek was elected to be a bishop in 1208. It was after the death of Fulko - the Bishop of Kraków - that he was chosen to succeed him as the new bishop. This was the first time that the Krakow Chapter elected a bishop on its own, with the help of Pope Innocent III, instead of through secular power. Pope Innocent III had to take action because the Krakow Chapter could not decide between Kadłubek and Bishop Gedko of Plok. Kadłubek was eventually chosen to be a bishop because of his avid support of church reforms and potential friendship with Pope Innocent III, as It is possible that Pope Innocent III and Kadłubek met in Paris while studying. Pope Innocent III confirmed the decision in a papal bull on 28 March 1208 and Kadłubek received his episcopal consecration from the Archbishop of Gniezno two months later. Innocent III&#x27;s bull referred to Kadłubek&#x27;s wisdom as the motivation for his selection while referring to him as a &quot;master and preacher&quot;. 

He set out to reform the diocesan priesthood to ensure their holiness while also seeking to invigorate the faithful to active participation in ecclesial affairs. As Bishop, he took action to make sure the church was independent of the power of the duke. In addition to being the bishop, he was the legislator of the diocese in Krakow and a member of the first Polish delegation to the Fourth Lateran Council, causing him to affect their reforms and resolutions in Krakow. He participated in diocesan synods and donated to the diocese of Krakow. He also founded and donated to monasteries, in addition to being a benefactor of the Cistercian monastery in Jędrzejów, which was not uncommon for bishops at the time. He was the first in Poland to begin the custom of lighting a vigil lamp prior to the Blessed Sacrament, which he was able to accomplish by allocating funds from the Krakow Chapter to provide wax for the vigil lamp in Saint Wenceslas Cathedral. He also consecrated Saint Florian&#x27;s Basilica and was said to have once been the chaplain to Casimir II the Just. Kadłubek was ordained as a priest the Dominican friar Ceslaus.

The bishop was noted for his linguistic skills and his charismatic preaching; Kadłubek was known also for his expertise in canon law, his approach to philosophical subjects, as well as for his expertise in rhetoric. He was well educated in the natural sciences since he had learned about them while in Paris and Bologna. Yet, it was while in Europe that he started reading into the life and works of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux and became enthralled with the charism of the Cistercians whom he granted favors to as bishop.

He followed Gallus Anonymus in further developing the idea of the Latin proverb &quot;vox populi vox dei&quot; (&quot;the voice of the people is the voice of God&quot;) and argued that the ruler (king) should follow a council that includes bishops and representatives of clans since not the ruler but the council has higher power originating from the laws that God instituted. He also claimed that the council should elect the ruler and that rulers abusing their power should be removed from their position.

== Later life ==
In 1217, Kadłubek decided to resign from his duties as a bishop. He spent his last years at the Cistercian monastery in Jędrzejów, making him the first Bishop of Krakow to join the Cistercian order after voluntarily abdicating. This also made him the first Polish person in the Cistercian monastery in Jędrzejów, which was composed of exclusively French monks at the time. The fire of the Jędrzejów monastery in 1800 in combination with the turbulence of Polish history at the time makes it difficult to understand the remaining years of his life. He likely continued to write the Chronica Polonorum into this time.

Kadlubek died on March 8, 1223, retaining his bishop&#x27;s pallium, buried in the Jędrzejów monastery, his remains were interred before the high altar of the convent church. His remains were exhumed on 26 April 1633 with his pallium found intact though his remains had become skeletal. Measurements were taken and it was surmised that he was of &quot;fair height&quot;. His remains were moved to a new location before the high altar on the following 16 August. Kadłubek&#x27;s remains were again exhumed and reinterred in mid-1765 and some were moved to Sandomierz in 1845 for veneration. Other parts to his remains were moved in 1903 to Wawel and placed in a silver urn.

==Beatification==

In 1634 the Polish episcopate made a petition to Pope Urban VIII requesting his canonization. In 1650 the Bishop of Kraków Piotr Gembicki appointed a tribunal to hear witnesses for the cause but the commission never began its work which suspended the cause. Bishop Jan Małachowski - in 1683 - petitioned Pope Innocent XI to canonize the late bishop. Innocent XI requested the Congregation for Rites to begin an investigation which took place from 1688 to 1692. But the congregation concluded that there was no reliable evidence to prove his heroic virtue which suspended the cause once again. In 1682 the king Jan III Sobieski petitioned for his beatification. The Order of Cîteaux made similar request in 1699 at their General Chapter. The Polish episcopate made another request to Pope Clement XII to canonize him but the process that the pope requested came to the same conclusion as the previous one.

In 1761 the king Augustus III sent two letters to Pope Clement XIII requesting the canonization which prompted the pope to order another process of investigation. That investigation proved to be successful for Clement XIII issued a papal bull in which he beatified the late bishop on 18 February 1764. On 9 June 1764 the pope issued another bull that allowed for a Mass and the Divine Office to be said in his honor in Kraków and among the Cistercians.

He is referred to in Poland as a saint despite the fact that he has not been canonized as such; Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz referred to Kadłubek as a &quot;saint&quot; in 2008. Since 2 January 2016 he has been the patron for Jędrzejów.

===Efforts to resume the cause===
There had been several efforts since his beatification to resume the cause and achieve his canonization though each attempt failed. Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński and Karol Józef Wojtyła (the future Pope John Paul II) both supported his cause in 1964 with Wojtyła referring to the late bishop as the &quot;Father of Polish culture&quot;.

In 1972 the Congregation for the Causes of Saints concluded that there was no reliable or available documentation that could confirm Kadłubek&#x27;s heroic virtues thus suspending the cause which has not continued since.

==Works==

His best-known work - &quot;Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae&quot; (&quot;Chronicles of the Kings and Princes of Poland&quot;) - is a historical compendium of Poland in four volumes. The first three volumes take the form of a dialogue between Archbishop John of Gniezno and Bishop Mateusz. The first volume&#x27;s sources are legends while the second is based on the chronicle of Gallus and the last two are based upon Kadłubek&#x27;s own experiences. Writing this work made him the first Polish native to chronicle Polish history.

This work had a huge impact on the Polish political doctrine of the 14th and 15th centuries co-authored by Stanisław of Skarbimierz as well as on later works of Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki. These ideas led to the Nobles&#x27; Democracy in Poland for it is in his works that for the first time the terms &quot;res publica&quot; (see Commonwealth and Rzeczpospolita) were used in the context of Poland. Some suggest that the book was written at the request of Prince Casimir II; others suggest that it was made at the request of Prince Leszek while Kadłubek was a bishop; still others claim that it was not written until after his retirement.

<text>Fort Laramie (; founded as Fort William and known for a while as Fort John) was a significant 19th-century trading post, diplomatic site, and military installation located at the confluence of the Laramie and the North Platte Rivers. They joined in the upper Platte River Valley in the eastern part of the present-day US state of Wyoming. The fort was founded as a private trading-post in the 1830s to service the overland fur trade; in 1849, it was purchased by the United States Army. The site was located east of the long climb leading to the best and lowest crossing-point over the Rocky Mountains at South Pass and became a popular stopping-point for migrants on the Oregon Trail. Along with Bent&#x27;s Fort on the Arkansas River, the trading post and its supporting industries and businesses were the most significant economic hub of commerce in the region.

Fort William was founded by William Sublette and his partner Robert Campbell in 1834. In the spring of 1835, Sublette sold the fort to Thomas Fitzpatrick, a local fur trader. After a rendezvous in 1836, it was sold to the American Fur Company, which still had a virtual monopoly on the western fur trade. Starting as early as the fall of 1840, the American Fur Company began competing with the newly-established Fort Platte, built by Lancaster Lupton about a mile away from Fort William.

The American Fur Company hired workers from Santa Fe to construct an adobe fort to replace Fort William. This fort was named Fort John, after John Sarpy, a partner in the company. In 1849, the U.S. Army purchased the fort as a post to protect the many wagon trains of migrant travelers on the Oregon Trail, and the subsidiary northern emigrant trails which split off further west. These included the California and Mormon Trails. The middle reaches of the Mormon trail stayed on the north banks of the Platte and North Platte rivers, and merged with the other emigrant trails heading west over the continental divide from Fort John-Laramie. The name &quot;Fort Laramie&quot; gradually came into use, likely as a convenient shortening of &quot;Fort John at the Laramie River&quot;.

The remaining structures are preserved as the Fort Laramie National Historic Site by the National Park Service.

==History==

===Name===
In 1815 or 1816, Jacques La Ramee and a small group of fellow trappers settled in the area where Fort Laramie would later be located. He went out alone to trap in 1819 or 1820 and was never seen again. Arapahoe Indians were accused of killing La Ramee and burying his body in a beaver dam. The river was named &quot;Laramie&quot; in his honor, and later settlers used this name for the Laramie Mountains, the fort, and the towns of Laramie, Wyoming and Fort Laramie, Wyoming.

===The fur trade===
The original fort was constructed in the 1830s, probably in 1833–1834 by William Sublette and Robert Campbell. The overland fur trade was still prosperous when Jim Bridger and Tom Fitzpatrick bought the place.

The fort was located near the confluence of two rivers, so it commanded a broad plain with water on two sides; these formed a partial natural moat. In addition, the nearby confluence of the North Platte&#x27;s waters had a ford easily used by travelers on what later became the northern overland emigrant trails following the North Platte River west from Nebraska. With the opening of the Mormon Trail on the north bank of the Platte and North Platte, the fort was a junction for westbound travelers. It was an anchor roughly a quarter of the way to either California or Oregon on the famous Oregon Trail. To the west, the common trail leaving Fort John-Laramie later spins off to the Mormon and California trails further west along the road to the Rogue River Valley. The main trail passed northwest to Oregon&#x27;s Willamette Valley and Oregon City.

One of the early principal owner-trappers was William Sublette, and the fort was called Fort William before being sold to the American Fur Company in 1841. (John Jacob Astor, the founder, had left his company a decade before.) The name was changed to Fort John after John Sarpy, a partner in the company. The 1846 treaties established relatively stable western territories after viable routes west had become well published. By the time the westward migration along the Oregon Trail had markedly increased, the US Army had become tenants in the fort as well. The fort was located along the Laramie River just south of its mouth onto the North Platte River.

On the opposite bank, the town of Fort Laramie, developed (both were later renamed to match the river&#x27;s eponym). Geographically, the site is situated just east of the steeper foothills terrain to the west (sometimes called &quot;High Plains&quot;) that ascends to the east side of the Rocky Mountains proper. This ascent was among the few roadways accessible by the wagons pioneers used to the west. It passed through the continental divide and reached the west slopes of the Rockies along a network of river valleys connecting to the far west via South Pass near the head waters of the North Platte. The strategic site on the eastern plains also had large grazing areas, where migrants could rest their draft animals before tackling the mountains. People could set up camps, do laundry, and heal before beginning anew the rigors of the westward trail.

In 1845, the nearby Fort Bernard was established about east, farther down the North Platte River, in hopes of getting some of the growing Emigrant Trail trade with western bound wagon trains. This much smaller fort undersold the Laramie operation. It offered a connection south via a crude mule-train road to the Santa Fe Trail via Colorado. Fort Bernard burnt down in 1866, and was never rebuilt. Only a few years later the transcontinental railway joined the two American sea coasts and train travel largely replaced the overland travel along the Emigrant Trails.

===Frontier army post===
The fort was purchased from Bruce Husband, a member of the American Fur Company, for $4,000 in June 1849 by US Army Lt. Daniel P. Woodbury on behalf of the United States Government. Three companies of cavalry arrived at the fort that same month, and Company &#x27;G&#x27;, 6th Infantry, which was the post&#x27;s permanent garrison for many years, arrived on August 12, 1849.

By 1849, gold seekers had joined the Oregon-bound settlers and Mormons heading to Utah, and westward travelers were estimated to number between 20,000 and 40,000 in 1849. The fort itself occupied a location where the westward trail diverged in the direction of either Oregon, Salt Lake City or California. Based on contemporary accounts travelers would remain at the fort several days to mail letters, exchange or purchase cattle, replenish their provisions and reset wagon tires.

The fort was taken over by the Army largely to protect and supply emigrants along the emigrant trails. In 1851, the first Treaty of Fort Laramie was signed, resulting in relatively peaceful relations between the whites and the Native Americans during the 1850s, though troops from the fort made up the small force that was killed during the Grattan massacre of 1854 under the command of Second Lieutenant John Lawrence Grattan. During the increasing strife of the 1860s, the fort took on a more military posture.

Fort Laramie was never seriously threatened by Indian attacks during the quarter-century of intermittent warfare sparked by the Grattan massacre. However, a number of civilians were killed in the immediate area and their property destroyed or stolen during this period of hostilities on the plains. The last known death occurred in March 1877 on the Big Bitter Cottonwood Creek.

The earliest surviving photograph of Fort Laramie, taken in 1858 by Samuel C. Mills, shows the remains of the old adobe walled fur trade fort (Fort John) flanked by a cluster of scattered wood and adobe buildings around the parade grounds.

===Architecture===
After Fort Laramie was purchased by the military on June 26, 1849, numerous buildings were constructed in the following years. As construction began many different factors were hindering progress. Amongst these issues included a lack of laborers, the cold winters, lack of water, and a limited supply of wood and stone in the surrounding area. One solution to these issues was the use of adobe bricks in building. Adobe bricks were a cheaper material that could provide needed insulation in the cold climate. Alongside adobe bricks, many buildings are made using concrete and some wood use as well. This use of multiple building materials gives Fort Laramie a unique aesthetic

Built in 1849, Old Bedlam is the oldest known U.S. military structure in Wyoming and Fort Laramie&#x27;s most commonly noted building. Old Bedlam served as the original officer quarters for Fort Laramie. It was used by officers of various rank and marital status, since no other housing was yet available. Old Bedlam offered very little privacy utilizing public kitchen areas and soldiers often sharing rooms. In 1881 Old Bedlam was turned into a duplex.

Also originally built in 1849 was the Post Traders store. This store provided supplies for all sorts of people including the Army, Native Americans, and pioneers traveling west. Throughout the years the fort was running, numerous additions were added to the Post Traders store and complex. In 1852 the northern section was built from stone, this became the store headquarters. Additions were made again in 1883 to serve as a bar and officers club housing.

The First Hospital in Fort Laramie was built from adobe bricks with a log roof in 1856. It had two rooms with eight beds each. The First Hospital was expanded in 1858 with an additional room, kitchen, dinning, and laundry area. Then in 1871 a new hospital was built in Fort Laramie originally based on a military standardized hospital plan. The first wing of this hospital was completed in 1873–1874 but the original plans were never finished. Porches were added around the building to help with the harsh weather.

Over the years Fort Laramie was operational, several more buildings were built for housing. Firstly, The Captains Quarters were built from 1868–1870. The plans for the Captains Quarters were altered midway through construction, resulting in a duplex with a thin staircase. Next, was the construction of the Cavalry Barracks in 1872–1874. This two story building is the only barracks left at Fort Laramie. The Cavalry Barracks had two large rooms on the second floor, each would hold roughly 60 men. Another quarters, known as the Post Surgeon quarters was finished in 1875 and lived in for the next 15 years by the surgeon and his family. The post surgeon quarters have been reconstructed to resemble the 1880&#x27;s. Following this was the construction of the Lt. Col. Quarters known as Burt House in 1884. Made with lime grout concrete, Burt House was intended for the Lt. Col. and his family. Burt House is currently restored to 1887–1888 when Lt. Col. Andrew Burt and his family lived there.

Fort Laramie also has two surviving guardhouses. The Old Guardhouse, built in 1866, was the second guardhouse in Fort Laramie. This building usually had guards on duty for 24 hours a day, and could hold up to 40 prisoners in the lower level. The New Guardhouse was built to relieve the Old Guardhouse from overcrowding in 1876.

Many ruins of old structures are present at Fort Laramie Historic Site, with the remaining structures making up only a third of the buildings that were once at Fort Laramie.

===Civil War, 1861–1865===
With the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the troops at Fort Laramie were withdrawn to fight the Confederate States Army in the east. To take their place, a series of volunteer regiments soon arrived at Fort Laramie, including the 11th Ohio Cavalry, serving until they were mustered out in 1866. Between October 1864 and October 1866 at least two companies from various units of &quot;Galvanized Yankees&quot; (Confederate prisoners of war recruited in the Union Army) were stationed at Fort Laramie.

===Red Cloud&#x27;s War, 1866–1868===
On Christmas night in 1866, John &quot;Portuguese&quot; Phillips ended his historic horseback ride at Fort Laramie after riding from the Powder River Country. His entire unit had been killed in a fight with the Sioux under Red Cloud, and he had ridden to get reinforcements for Fort Phil Kearny. Legend maintains that Phillips&#x27; thoroughbred horse dropped dead upon arriving at the fort; it is unclear whether Phillips kept the same mount for the entire ride. Phillips crossed hostile Indian country, and had to make most of the journey during a brutal Wyoming blizzard.

In the late 1860s, the fort was the primary staging ground for the United States in the Powder River Country during Red Cloud&#x27;s War. In 1868 the parties reached a peace agreement codified as the second Treaty of Fort Laramie.

===Great Sioux War of 1876–1877===
The discovery of gold in the Black Hills touched off another period of conflict with the Lakota and Northern Cheyenne, as the United States violated their previous promise to keep the hills limited to the Sioux. Miners invaded the territory, and US forces came into conflict during the Great Sioux War of 1876. Fort Laramie served as a major staging point for supplies and troops.

===Final years===
After the completion of the transcontinental railroad, the fort&#x27;s importance gradually decreased. Fewer wagon trains journeyed west, and regional Native Americans had been largely subdued. The fort was decommissioned in 1890. The original abandonment order was issued in 1889, and four of the infantry companies stationed there at that time went to Fort Logan, near Denver, Colorado that fall.

In March 1890, about 30 cavalry soldiers and civilian mechanics under the command of Lt. C. W. Taylor arrived at the fort and removed doors, windows, flooring, and any other material from the buildings that was thought to be of value to the government. The last soldiers left Fort Laramie on April 20, 1890. All but one of the structures were sold at auction to private citizens. The entire military reservation, which was nine miles long and six miles wide, was opened up to homesteaders for settlement on October 5, 1891.

==Historic district==
The federal government repurchased the site in 1938 and began reconstructing the fort for preservation purposes. The Fort Laramie National Monument was established, which became the Fort Laramie National Historic Site in 1960.

In a 1983 document, the National Park Service (NPS) describes a 536-acre historic district within the larger national historic site containing all of the historic structures, buildings, ruins, and sites, as well as a separate area containing a bridge. The NPS identified 36 significant physical remains that provide the background for the events and the people associated with Fort Laramie. These included 13 standing buildings, 11 standing ruins, and several buildings where only the foundations remain.

<doc id="1216950" wikidata="Q701689" url="?curid=1216950" title="Green Island, Taiwan">
<text>Green Island, also known by other names, is a small volcanic island in the Pacific Ocean about off the eastern coast of the main island of Taiwan. It is at high tide and at low tide, making it the seventh-largest island in Taiwan. The island is administered as , a rural township of Taitung County and one of the county&#x27;s two insular townships (the other being Lanyu Township). The island once served as a penal colony for political prisoners during Taiwan&#x27;s period of martial law, although today it is primarily known as a tourist hotspot.

==Names==
The island was known as Sama-Sana, Samasana and as in the 19th and early 20th centuries, a transcription of its Amis name &quot;Sanasai&quot;.

The name &quot;Green Island&quot; is a calque of the island&#x27;s Chinese name, written . It is also known as Lyudao, Lüdao or from the pinyin romanization of the name&#x27;s Mandarin pronunciation; as from its Wade-Giles romanization; and as from its Hokkien pronunciation. The name was adopted by the Republic of China on August 1, 1949, at the behest of Huang Shih-hung , the magistrate of Taitung.

Before that, it was usually known as (or Huoshao), a calque of its original Chinese name &quot;Huǒshāo Dǎo&quot; 

==History==
The island was originally inhabited by the aboriginal Amis people.

In March 1864 the British brig &quot;Susan Douglas&quot; was swept off course and wrecked on the island. Her captain then sailed by junk from the island to Kaohsiung, and the Royal Navy gunboat HMS &quot;Bustard&quot; found and rescued the remainder of the survivors.

In the early 1870s, William Campbell saw the island from aboard the &quot;Daphne&quot;, and wrote:

On 11 December 1937 the Dollar Steamship Company luxury ocean liner ran aground in a typhoon on a reef at Zhongliao Bay. All 503 passengers and 330 crew survived and were safely brought ashore. Over the next few days the cargo liners SS &quot;President McKinley&quot; and SS &quot;President Pierce&quot; took the survivors off the island, helped by boats provided by the and an Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer. Dollar Lines sold &quot;President Hoover&quot;″s wreck to a Japanese salvage company, which spent the next three years breaking her up &quot;in situ&quot;.

In response to the wreck, members of the US public gave money through the American Red Cross for a lighthouse to be built near Zhongliao village. Lyudao or Lüdao Lighthouse was designed by Japanese engineers, built by local islanders in 1938 and is high.

A shipwreck of Dutch origin dating to the 19th century was found in June 2013.

===Prisons===
Green Island first served as an isolated spot and place of exile for political prisoners during the martial law period during the Kuomintang government, and especially in the White Terror. After their release, many of the prisoners jailed between the late 1940s and the late 1980s went on to establish the Democratic Progressive Party, most notably Shih Ming-teh. Writer and political dissident Bo Yang served his prison terms there.

The place where most of the political prisoners (such as Shih Ming-teh) were held was &quot;Green Island Lodge&quot; (Pinyin: &quot;Lǜ Dǎo Shānzhuāng&quot;). &quot;Oasis Village&quot; was the main penal colony. The prison was later closed, and its interior is now open to the public. &quot;Green Island Prison&quot; (Pinyin: &quot;Lǜdǎo Jiānyù&quot;) is also on the island and has housed prisoners considered to be among Taiwan&#x27;s most dangerous criminals and gangsters. However, this has changed in recent years.

==Geography==
The island is formed of volcanic tholeiite, andesite, and volcanic explosive fragments with an area of 15 km2. The volcano erupted from the Pliocene to Pleistocene epochs and is part of the Luzon Volcanic Arc. Magma was formed by subduction of oceanic crust at a depth of about . The andesite rock contains some visible crystals of pyroxene or amphibole. The geochemistry of the rock shows it is enriched in potassium, strontium and rubidium and light rare earth elements. Chromium and nickel are depleted.

===Fauna===
The island is a habitat for Formosan sika deer, Reeves&#x27;s muntjacs, Ryukyu flying foxes, and resident and migratory birds.

==Local population==
In 1995 fewer than half of the registered 2,634 residents of the island actually lived on the island. The population is dwindling due to the difficulty of finding jobs on the island. The island has two pre-schools, one kindergarten, two elementary schools and one middle school. To pursue any education at the senior high school level or above, islanders must move to the main island of Taiwan. Public service centres include one seniors&#x27; home, one library, and one community centre.

The villages and the settlements (聚落) they administer are:
* Zhongliao Village (中寮村)
** Zhongliao
* Nanliao Village (南寮村)

* Gongguan Village (公館村)
** Gongguan (公館)
** Chaikou (柴口)

The following abandoned aboriginal tribal settlements also belong to Gongguan Village:
* Youzihu (柚子湖)
* Nanzihu (楠子湖)
* Haishenping (海參坪)
* Dabaisha (大白沙)

==Power generation==
The island is powered by its only diesel-fired power plant with a capacity of 29.1 MW, consisting of 28 units of generation.

==Tourist attractions==
* Green Island Human Rights Culture Park
* Lüdao Lighthouse
* Green Island Dive Sites Recreational diving is popular for visitors. There are many dive sites that are established with walkways down to ocean About 150 meter Off Shilang, lies the biggest reef attraction &#x27;Big Mushroom Coral&#x27; its height about 12m, width around 31m.

<text>Airdrieonians Football Club, more commonly known as Airdrie, was a Scottish professional football team from the town of Airdrie, in the Monklands area of Lanarkshire.

The club became defunct at the end of the Scottish Football League 2001–02 season, despite the team finishing as runners-up in the SFL First Division to Partick Thistle and therefore only narrowly missing out on promotion to the Scottish Premier League.

During their 124-year existence the &quot;Diamonds&quot;, as they were nicknamed, won the old Scottish Division Two three times, the Spring Cup once and the Scottish Challenge Cup on three occasions. The club also competed in four separate Scottish Cup finals; winning the competition in 1924.

Airdrieonians were the first club in the Scottish League to fold since 1967, when Third Lanark went bankrupt.

==History==

===Formation and early years===
The team was founded in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire in 1878 as Excelsior Football Club, changing its name to Airdrieonians in 1881. It was elected to the Scottish Football League in 1894.

The club enjoyed its most successful era in the 1920s, following the signing of Hughie Gallacher from Queen of the South in 1921. Airdrie challenged the dominance of Rangers, as they finished in second place in the Scottish League championship for four consecutive seasons (1923 - 1926). They won the 1924 Scottish Cup Final beating Hibernian 2–0. Bob McPhail said, &quot;The terror-like attitude of Gallacher caused havoc with the Hibs defenders. He and Russell were easily our best forwards&quot;. Willie Russell scored both goals.

Following this victory, in early summer 1925, the club visited Norway and Sweden, and made a big impression. Translations of local newspaper reports, and some photographs of the tour, are still available. This successful era came to an end after Gallacher in December 1925 and McPhail in 1927 were sold to Newcastle United and Rangers respectively.

===Post war era and beyond===

Airdrie spent much of the post war era &quot;yo-yoing&quot; between the top flight and Second Division. Airdrie entered the first Texaco Cup competition in 1970–71, defeating Nottingham Forest in the first round. That tie was decided by a penalty shootout and Airdrie became the first Scottish club to be involved in that method of deciding a contest. Airdrie reached the Texaco Cup Final in 1972, losing 2–1 on aggregate to Derby County. They also reached the 1975 Scottish Cup Final, losing 3–1 to Celtic. After the leagues were restructured in 1975, a competition called the Spring Cup was instituted for the teams in the lower divisions. Airdrie won this competition in 1976, but it was discontinued after one season as clubs preferred to play additional league games instead.

===Alex MacDonald era===

During the 1990s, with Alex MacDonald at the helm, Airdrie worked their way into the Premier Division in the 1991–92 and 1992–93 seasons, were regularly considered challengers for promotion and recognised as one of the bigger clubs in First Division.

MacDonald also guided the Diamonds to two Scottish Cup Finals. The first appearance coming on 9 May 1992 when the club faced Rangers in front of 44,045 strong crowd at Hampden Park. Unfortunately for Airdrie on this occasion however, a goal each from Mark Hateley and Ally McCoist earned the blue half of Glasgow a 2–1 victory.

Although Airdrie lost in the 1992 Scottish Cup Final they had already qualified for the 1992–93 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, as Rangers had also won the Scottish league championship in 1992. Airdrie were drawn against Czech side Sparta Prague in the first round. Airdrie lost 1–0 at Broomfield and 2–1 in Prague, losing 3–1 on aggregate. Kenny Black, who later went on to become manager of Airdrie United, scored the only Airdrie goal.

Airdrie also reached the 1995 Scottish Cup Final, where they faced the other half of the Old Firm, Celtic. Airdrie would once again fall at the final hurdle, as they lost 1–0 to a Pierre van Hooijdonk goal. Airdrie also won the Scottish Challenge Cup in 1994–95.

===Stadium problems===

Airdrie sold their Broomfield home to Safeway in 1994, but had to groundshare with Clyde at Broadwood Stadium for four years until the Excelsior Stadium was opened. It is arguably this stadium re-location and the difficulties generated by it that was Airdrie&#x27;s first step towards oblivion. The mismanagement of the entire situation by the club&#x27;s board, as well as North Lanarkshire Council&#x27;s lengthy delay in granting planning permission caused Airdrieonians financial situation to reach critical level. This was not helped by the low attendances at Excelsior Stadium following the completion of the move, which was connected to the quality of football on display due to the lack of funds available to be spent on the team.

The demise of Airdrieonians was personified by the sudden and unexpected death of Joey Rowan, the club&#x27;s sole remaining director. Rowan had a long and intimate association with the club and was son-in-law and advisor to Airdrieonians long term benefactor Jack Dalziel (recognised by having the main stand named after him). Rowan, already a popular figure with the club&#x27;s supporters due to his passion, candour and trademark ponytail, gained even more respect by remaining with Airdrieonians and incurring substantial personal losses whilst trying to steer the club away from liquidation despite the fact that the rest of the board had resigned amid finger-pointing and acrimony in an attempt to avoid reproach and financial liabilities. He is considered the club&#x27;s last great hero for his selfless sacrifice and unyielding loyalty.

===Liquidation===

In February 2000, KPMG were appointed as provisional liquidators of Airdrieonians. This move came soon after Rangers chairman David Murray had applied for a court order to seize some of Airdrie&#x27;s revenue in lieu of funds owed to another of his companies. KPMG and the board hoped more private investment would be made in the club. Most of the playing staff were made redundant at the end of the 1999–2000 season. Steve Archibald put forth a bid for the club and during the 2000–01 season he brought in many foreign players, including David Fernández, Jesus Sanjuán, Antonio Calderón and Javier Sánchez Broto, that became popular with the fans and won the Scottish Challenge Cup in 2000. KPMG terminated their management deal with Archibald in February 2001, stating that Archibald had not kept up to date with payment of fees. After difficulty fulfilling their fixtures, Airdrie narrowly avoided relegation to the Second Division.

Despite the obvious financial problems, Ian McCall managed to build a new Airdrie team and retained the Scottish Challenge Cup. The club also performed well in the 2001–02 Scottish First Division and chased promotion to the Scottish Premier League. A run of only two victories in the last 14 games, however, meant that Partick Thistle won the First Division and the promotion place. The final match played by Airdrieonians was an away game against Ayr United at Somerset Park on 27 April. The match was abandoned by the referee after a crossbar was broken during a pitch invasion by Airdrie fans, who were protesting against the Ayr United owner Bill Barr. His Barr Construction company had built the Excelsior Stadium and became one of the major creditors of Airdrie.

After Airdrieonians went out of business on 1 May 2002, local accountant Jim Ballantyne attempted to gain entry to the Scottish Football League (SFL) with a team named Airdrie United. His bid for league status was rejected, however, in favour of the application by Gretna, who were then playing in the English Northern Premier League. Ballantyne then opted to buy control of Clydebank, another SFL club experiencing extreme financial hardship. With approval by the SFL, their name was changed to Airdrie United, the team relocated to Airdrie and the strip was altered to the famous diamond style of Airdrieonians. A &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; was established by the new club to honour noted players of the previous entity (some of whom also played for the new club), with more entrants added each year.

In June 2013, the SFA allowed Airdrie United to change their name to Airdrieonians.

==Stadium==
For most of its history, Airdrieonians played at Broomfield Park, which was opened in 1892. The ground was located in a hollow in Airdrie town centre. The Broomfield pitch was very narrow, at just 67 yards wide. These physical features and the proximity of the stands to the pitch meant that Broomfield had a raucous atmosphere, which visiting clubs disliked. Broomfield was known for its distinctive corner pavilion, which was built in 1907. After winning the 1923–24 Scottish Cup, the club built a main stand, adjacent to the pavilion.

The final game at Broomfield took place in May 1994 after which the ground, having been sold to supermarket chain Safeway, was demolished to make room for their new store. The club planned to make use of the funds generated from the sale to build a new all-seated stadium, but had difficulties acquiring planning permission. Airdrie went on to groundshare with Clyde at Broadwood Stadium in Cumbernauld for four seasons with the club eventually moving into its new home, the Shyberry Excelsior Stadium, in time for the 1998–99 season. Airdrieonians played their home games there until they were liquidated in 2002.

===European record===
Airdrieonians qualified for a UEFA club competition on one occasion. In 1992, Airdrieonians reached the final of the Scottish Cup and were beaten by Rangers. The winner of the Scottish Cup would normally qualify for the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, but because Rangers had already qualified for the UEFA Champions League through their league ranking in the Scottish Premier Division, the place was passed to Airdrie as runners-up. Airdrie were eliminated in the first round by Sparta Prague of Czechoslovakia in a two-legged tie.

<text>Lyveden New Bield (sometimes called New Build) is an unfinished Elizabethan summer house in the parish of Aldwincle in North Northamptonshire, commissioned by Sir Thomas Tresham and now owned by the National Trust. It is a Grade I listed building, classing it as a &#x27;building of exceptional interest.&#x27;

==Construction==
It was constructed for Sir Thomas Tresham, the fervent Roman Catholic of Rushton Hall, and is thought to have been designed by Robert Stickells. The exact date is unknown but can be estimated to circa 1604–05, the year of Tresham&#x27;s death. The New Bield was on the estate of Tresham&#x27;s second home, Lyveden Manor House, also known as Lyveden Old Bield.

== Design &amp; Catholic Motifs ==
Just as at Tresham&#x27;s smaller folly, Rushton Triangular Lodge, his principal estate, the New Bield has a religious design full of symbolism. Designed on a plan reminiscent of a Greek cross, the facades have a strict symmetry. The building has two floors above a raised basement, with mullioned and transomed windows. Each floor had three rooms with a staircase in the south projection of the cross. 

The exterior of the building is decorated by friezes of a religious nature. The metopes contain the emblems and motifs found also at the triangular lodge, such as the &quot;IHS&quot; christogram.

==Purpose as a &#x27;Secret House&#x27; ==

The house was obviously meant for occupation, as it has a great hall and parlour on the first floor, kitchen and buttery in the basement, and a bedroom on the upper floor. However, it was probably never intended for full-time occupation. Too close to the main house for use as a hunting lodge, it may have been intended for use as a &quot;Secret House&quot;—keeping a secret house was a custom of the 16th century. Often within a mile of the main house, the secret house was a place where the head of the household would retire for a few days with a minimum of servants, while the principal house was thoroughly cleaned and, bearing in mind the sanitation of the time, fumigated. Similar examples of &quot;secret houses&quot; exist at Leconfield and Warkworth, where their use for this purpose has been well documented.

Lyveden New Bield was never completed. It remains as it was when the builders left following Sir Thomas Tresham&#x27;s death. Today, it is in the care of the National Trust.

==Lyveden Old Bield==
Lyveden Manor House, now also known as Lyveden Old Bield, the once grand principal house of the estate, had belonged to the Tresham family from c.1450. Today, little remains and what does was probably built by Thomas Tresham&#x27;s grandson Lewis. The gatehouse has been removed to Fermyn Woods Hall, and the staircase was transported to America, where it was incorporated in the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House near Detroit. One wing remains with mullioned windows.

In 2013, the National Trust acquired Lyveden Manor House, it is open to the public, with the Trust&#x27;s long-term aim to restore the historic gardens and open them to the public.

== Gardens &amp; Orchard ==

Set on 60 acres Lyveden lies in the heart of the medieval Royal Forest of Rockingham. Tresham designed extensive gardens between the manor house and the New Bield, but for centuries little evidence of the gardens remained. However, in 2010, National Trust experts studying photographs taken by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War discovered the remains of an Elizabethan labyrinth, garden and orchard in the grounds. The gardens were subsequently upgraded to a Grade I listing by English Heritage.

The National Trust has reconstructed Tresham&#x27;s orchard, which originally contained 300 fruit and nut trees, as well as restored the moat on three sides of the labyrinth.

==The Tresham Family and The Gunpowder Plot==

Sir Thomas Tresham died in 1605 following decades of religious persecution, his once vast wealth having been severely depleted. His son Francis Tresham inherited the estate, but within the same year, along with his cousins Robert Catesby and Robert and Thomas Wintour, he became involved in the Gunpowder Plot. Thus, within a year the estate had a third owner, Francis&#x27;s son Lewis Tresham. The estate was managed by Lewis&#x27;s mother until her death in 1615.

After this, Lewis Tresham, a spendthrift, lost the remaining family wealth. The estate was eventually sold following the death of his son in 1643.

<doc id="1216972" wikidata="Q1645936" url="?curid=1216972" title="Anaconda (character)">
<text>Anaconda (Blanche Sitznski) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She has generally been associated with the Serpent Society, often as a foe of Captain America. Sitznski was given her superhuman abilities by the Roxxon corporation, giving her the codename Anaconda due to her powerful, adamantium-enhanced arms which she uses to constrain or crush her opponents. Her first appearance was as part of the Serpent Squad, when they tried to retrieve the Serpent Crown only to be thwarted by Thing, Stingray and Triton. She later became a core member of Sidewinder&#x27;s Serpent Squad and remained a member when they became the Serpent Society.

In 2020, Anaconda was ranked as CBR&#x27;s 5th best female Marvel supervillain.

==Publication history==
Anaconda was created by Mark Gruenwald and Ralph Macchio and first appeared in &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; #64 in June 1980.

The character received biographical entries in &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; #1 (1983), &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition&quot; #1 (1985), &quot;Gamer&#x27;s Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot; #4 (1988), &quot;The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Master Edition&quot; #1 (1990), and &quot;Deadpool Corps: Rank and Foul&quot; #1 (2010).

==Fictional character biography==

===Origin===
Blanche &quot;Blondie&quot; Sitznski was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She worked as a steelworker until executives at the Roxxon Oil Company selected her to become a special agent in covert operations. She was already well-adjusted to villainy, as she was the calisthenics instructor at the criminal trainer Taskmaster&#x27;s Academy. It was there that she trained several women in hand-to-hand combat, most notably Diamondback and Snapdragon. She was eventually taken to Roxxon&#x27;s Mutagenic Laboratory and bioengineered by Roxxon&#x27;s Mutagenics Division to have various permanent serpentine features. Her entire skeletal structure was laced with artificial adamantium, giving her the ability to elongate her arms and legs, which she uses to constrict her enemies. She had also been surgically given gills, which allows her to breathe underwater.

===Serpent Squad===
Her first mission as part of the second Serpent Squad grouped her with three other snake-themed villains: Sidewinder, Black Mamba, and Death Adder. They were given the task to retrieve the Serpent Crown for Roxxon president Hugh Jones. During the mission, the group came into conflict with the Thing, Stingray, and Triton. Anaconda eagerly battled the Thing, and was able to apprehend him with ease. They found the Serpent Crown, but the Thing and Triton retaliated, defeating Anaconda, Black Mamba and Death Adder by trapping them underwater.

Anaconda freed herself and her teammates from their underwater captivity using her brute strength, and they were sent on another mission—this time, to search for a powerful weapon known as the Micro-Scanner. After battling Iron Man, Anaconda and the others were defeated and presumably taken to prison.

===Serpent Society===
The trio somehow escaped, and sought out Sidewinder for payment from their first mission together. He gave them their share of the money, plus more, inviting them to join his new criminal organization, the Serpent Society. Anaconda hesitantly accepted the offer. At the orientation, Sidewinder grouped Anaconda together with Cobra and the Rattler to perform an initiation test. Their job was to steal equipment from the bankrupt Brand Corporation. Constrictor, annoyed with the whole idea of the Serpent Society, spied on Anaconda&#x27;s group and called the Avengers hotline to tip them off. Captain America appeared as Anaconda and the others were pulling their heist, and Anaconda ordered Cobra and Rattler to return to Sidewinder with the apparatus. During an intense battle with the Avenger, Anaconda was able to wrap her arms around Captain America. She started to crush his bones, but one well-placed hit of his shield knocked her out, and she was taken to jail.

Teleported out by Sidewinder, Anaconda paid a visit to Constrictor, beating him to near death. Anaconda also participated in the mission to murder MODOK, but was knocked out with a mind-blast early in the fight. However, her teammates Cottonmouth and Death Adder were able to kill him, and Anaconda carried his corpse to A.I.M. for the large sum profit they were promised. Soon after, Death Adder was murdered by the Scourge of the Underworld. Anaconda vowed to find the murderer and avenge his death.

When Viper invaded the Serpent Society, Anaconda willingly switched sides and attacked Diamondback when she brought Captain America and Demolition Man to help, but was defeated by Diamondback&#x27;s acid-tipped diamonds. Later, Cobra took over leadership and he and Anaconda had a mutual respect for each other, having worked together on many missions in the past. Anaconda assisted the Serpent Society on a mission against the X-Men, and fought Colossus. Anaconda also took time out to help Diamondback&#x27;s date with Captain America (unbeknownst to her at the time) go smoothly. Upon learning that Diamondback knew the true identity of her sworn enemy, Captain America, Anaconda turned on Diamondback. Anaconda served as bailiff during her trial where she voted guilty, and battled Captain America after the trial.
Anaconda eventually became romantically involved with one of the new recruits, Puff Adder. They, along with Rock Python were sent to retrieve Diamondback, who had escaped her death sentence. They eventually crashed their Serpent Saucer into Diamondback&#x27;s apartment, where she, Black Mamba, and Asp were hiding out. The girls were easily taken out by Anaconda and her allies, but their kidnapping attempt was interrupted by an invitation to join Superia&#x27;s all-female villain group, the Femizons. Diamondback, Black Mamba, and Asp accepted, as did Anaconda, reluctantly. While on Superia&#x27;s ship, Anaconda caused quite a ruckus with the villainess Quicksand. She also took part in the attack on Captain America and Paladin, but fled when the Femizons disbanded. She reappeared with the Serpent Society when super hero undercover, Jack Flag, attempted to join the group to replace a retired Cobra. Anaconda battled Jack Flag and his partner Free Spirit until Force Works showed up and put an end to the battle.

===Six Pack===
Much later, Anaconda took part in the Bloodsport tournament in hopes of winning the prize money. She easily took out her first opponent, Forearm, but got her neck slit by her second opponent, Puma. Her ability to heal quickly proved useful, as she survived the attack and returned to the Serpent Society for their mission to exact revenge on Diamondback once again. She then joined S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s espionage team, the Six Pack. She eventually turned on them, along with Constrictor, Solo, and Domino, to join forces with Cable, who was trying to create a sanctuary with his newfound powers. She was also warped into Cable&#x27;s mind, where she saved Cable&#x27;s life by grabbing onto him before he could get sucked into a techno-organic virus. She continued to work with the Six Pack as they committed acts of terrorism in Rumekistan to diminish Cable&#x27;s reputation. Cable exacted revenge on the Six Pack by defeating them all and returning them to the United States.

Anaconda was later seen as one of the supervillains defeated by the New Warriors and was tied up and gagged with a form of Spider-Man&#x27;s web fluid.

===Secret Invasion===
During the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, Anaconda rejoined the Serpent Society. The Society held a number of civilians hostage in a compound in the American Midwest claiming they were protecting themselves from the Skrulls. However, they were easily defeated by Nova and his new Nova Corps.

Later, several Serpent Society members including Anaconda, Black Mamba, Bushmaster and Cottonmouth fought members of the New Avengers in a semi-tropical locale. Anaconda was then seen playing poker in Reno, Nevada. She was accused by a woman named Desire of running an illegal underwater animal fighting ring. Deadpool later corrected her, stating that the animal ring was an Australian reality show and that the only crime Anaconda is guilty of is &quot;being a bleach queen.&quot; She also battled the mutants Rockslide and Anole with the Serpent Society, under Mister Negative&#x27;s contract. The Serpent Society, while on an assignment to kill a man named Marcus Johnson, encountered Taskmaster and Deadpool. During the skirmish, Anaconda&#x27;s arm was dismembered by Deadpool&#x27;s sword. Anaconda and her allies were then arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D.

===Returning to the Serpent Society===
Most recently, Anaconda has been seen working with the Serpent Society on several missions. One mission had her battling the Avengers, though she was once again arrested. On another mission, Anaconda robbed a bank alongside teammates Asp, Cottonmouth, Bushmaster, and Puff Adder. They encountered the mutant Hope Summers, who subsequently defeated Anaconda with a barrage of headbutts. She also briefly served as a member of the Doom Maidens.

Alongside Sidewinder, Black Mamba, and the second Death Adder, Anaconda battled Elektra after being hired by the Assassins Guild to kill her allies Matchmaker, Cape Crow, and Kento Roe.

===Serpent Solutions===
As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; event, Anaconda appears as a member of Viper&#x27;s Serpent Society under its new name Serpent Solutions.

During the &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, Anaconda and Serpent Solutions join Helmut Zemo&#x27;s Army of Evil. She also briefly battled the X-Men alongside her teammates.

Anaconda later attended former Six Pack teammate Domino&#x27;s birthday party.

During the Thing&#x27;s bachelor party, Anaconda and other female members of the Serpent Society hid in a giant cake, and attacked the Thing and his superhero guests after they had several alcoholic beverages. Anaconda and the others were defeated after a battle, and taken into custody.

Anaconda was among several animal-themed super-villains captured and hunted by Kraven the Hunter. Alongside the rest of the Serpent Society, Anaconda joined Vulture in rebelling against human-controlled drones that had been set up to hunt the criminals. When the group gained their freedom, they were ambushed and apprehended by the Avengers.

==Powers and abilities==

Anaconda has the superhuman ability to elongate her limbs and constrict her opponents. Her arms and legs are able to elongate to about one and a half times their normal length (though most artists show her greatly exceeding that length), while her muscles engorge with blood, giving the appearance of massive, snake-like limbs. Once she has entwined her limbs around a human-sized foe, there are very few human beings able to break free of her grip. She has also been surgically given gills, which allow her to breathe underwater, and modified lungs for extracting oxygen from water. Due to all the bio-engineering performed on her, Anaconda has incredible recuperative abilities and she is able to heal non-fatal wounds several times faster than a normal human being. Her strength is enhanced beyond normal human levels and she is an excellent swimmer.

Her entire skeletal structure is laced with an adamantium alloy-based substance, increasing her durability.

Anaconda is a skilled combatant, using street-fighting techniques to accommodate her elongating arms.

==Other versions==
===Ultimate Marvel===
Anaconda appears in the Ultimate Universe as a member of the all-female Serpent Squad. Searching for the Serpent Squad at Project Pegasus, the girls are attacked by the Fantastic Four and a battle ensues. Mister Fantastic is able to take out Anaconda, and she is later taken into custody. She looks significantly different from her Earth-616 counterpart, depicted as much thinner and less masculine, though she retains her scales. She later reappears, once again with the Serpent Squad attempting to steal the Serpent Crown back from Project Pegasus. However, she and her cohorts are defeated by Spider-Man, Rick Jones, Iceman, and Human Torch. Anaconda then left the Serpent Squad and joined the gang called the Serpent Skulls, becoming a lieutenant. She had her own gang of biker girls. However, during the final battle with the All-New Ultimates, Anaconda was defeated by Kitty Pryde and taken into custody. Anaconda somehow escaped imprisonment and rejoined the Serpent Squad, seeking out the crown for one more time. She and the Squad were stopped, however, by Spider-Man and the All-New Ultimates.

===Marvel Adventures===
Anaconda appears as a member of the Serpent Society in the Marvel Adventures universe. With the other members, she briefly battles Spider-Man and holds him in her grip. However, as soon as Lizard is transformed into a monstrous beast, Anaconda and the Serpents teleport away.

===Earth-33900===
In the Avengers series dedicated to the American Armed Forces, Anaconda appears as a member of the Serpent Society. After her teammates Viper, Eel, and Death Adder fail to capture a secret parcel carried by Sergeant Joe Wilton, Cobra sends Anaconda to Atlanta International Airport to aid them. Hanging from a Serpent Saucer piloted by Cobra, Anaconda manages to capture both the sergeant and his parcel. After discovering what was inside the bag, Anaconda refuses to show Cobra and tells him they are going to let Sergeant Wilton and the bag go. She also reveals her father was a marine. Iron Man and Hawkeye attack the saucer, and Anaconda stops Cobra from blasting Hawkeye. This allows Iron Man to defeat Cobra and subsequently Anaconda.

===Marvel Super Hero Adventures===
In this comic book series aimed toward young children, Anaconda appears as a member of the Serpent Society. Alongside her teammates, Anaconda battled Ms. Marvel, Spider-Man, and the Society&#x27;s newest recruit, Garden Snake.

===Deadpool: Samurai===
Anaconda appeared in the second volume of &quot;Deadpool: Samurai&quot;, part of the Marvel × Shōnen Jump+ Super Collaboration.

==In other media==
Anaconda appears in &quot;The Avengers: Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes&quot;, voiced by Vanessa Marshall.

<doc id="1216977" wikidata="Q1358126" url="?curid=1216977" title="Mushroom rock">
<text>A mushroom rock, also called rock pedestal, or a pedestal rock, is a naturally occurring rock whose shape, as its name implies, resembles a mushroom. The rocks are deformed in a number of different ways: by erosion and weathering, glacial action, or from a sudden disturbance. Mushroom rocks are related to, but different from, &quot;yardang&quot;.

A mushroom rock, rock pedestal, or gour is a typical mushroom-shaped landform that is formed by the action of wind erosion. At an average height of from the base, the material-carrying capacity of the wind is at its maximum, so abrasion (erosion by wind in which transported materials hit an exposed rock surface and polish it or scratch it) is also maximized. In some cases, harder rocks are arranged horizontally over a softer rock, resulting in such erosion.

==Erosion==

Usually found in desert areas, these rocks form over thousands of years when wind erosion of an isolated rocky outcrop progresses at a different rate at its bottom than at its top. Abrasion by wind-borne grains of sand is most prevalent within the first above the ground, causing the bases of outcrops to erode more rapidly than their tops. Running water can have the same effect. An example of this type of mushroom rock is the one in Timna Park, Israel.

Occasionally, the chemical composition of the rocks can be an important factor; if the upper part of the rock is more resistant to chemical erosion and weathering, it erodes more slowly than the base. For example, erosion attributed to chemical weathering at the base of the rock due to the collection of dew near the surface.

A mushroom rock may ultimately form from an originally flat area of hard rock overlying soft rock, similar to the pattern of rocks that form a waterfall. Weathering of the exposed hard rock layer eventually exposes the lower rock to erosion from wind, water, salt intrusion, etc., depending on local conditions. The layer of softer rock is more readily eroded, leading to the formation of a depression or blowout. The overlying harder rocks are resistant to this process, and may ultimately end up as isolated mushroom rocks standing above the new, lower plain.

The nature of wind erosion is that it concentrates a few feet over the ground - wind speeds increase with height, but sediment load reduces. This means that the combination of highest sediment loads and fastest wind speed exist a few feet over the ground, leading to the characteristic narrowing of the support pedestal at this height.

==Glacial action==
In contrast to a mushroom rock formed by erosion of a single rock, these mushrooms are a type of balancing rock that formed from two separate rocks, one of which came to rest on top of the other. Typically, the uppermost rock was transported and deposited by the slow action of a glacier. The lower part of the rock formation might or might not have also undergone a degree of erosion to accentuate the mushroom shape.

<text>The wrinkled hornbill or Sunda wrinkled hornbill (Rhabdotorrhinus corrugatus) is a medium-large hornbill which is found in forest in the Thai-Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo. 
The wrinkled hornbill is around 70 cm long, and has a very large bill that is fused to the skull. It has mainly black plumage, a blue eye-ring, and a broadly white or rufous-tipped tail. The male and female have different head and bill patterns. Males have bright yellow feathers on the auriculars, cheeks, throat, neck-sides and chest, but these areas are black in the female, except for the blue throat. The bill of the male is yellow with a red base and casque, and a brownish basal half of the lower mandible. The bill and casque of the female is almost entirely yellow.

This is a forest species and eats mainly fruit, such as figs, although it will also eat small animals such as frogs and insects. Wrinkled hornbills do not drink, but get the water they need from their food. Their call is a harsh &quot;Kak-kak&quot;, or a deep &quot;Row-wow&quot; which can be heard for miles.

These birds are monogamous and remain in a pair for life. They use holes found in trees for nests, and the female will plaster over the entrance with mud and droppings, leaving a nesting mother and her chicks only a small hole, too small for them to exit. They are fed exclusively by the male, who regurgitates food for them. After several months, when the chicks are ready, the female will break out of her nest. 

Wrinkled hornbills were first bred in captivity in 1988. Heavy deforestation in their forest habitat has led them to be uplisted from near threatened to endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2018.

<text>Bell and Howell is a United States brand of cameras, lenses, and motion picture machinery. It was originally founded as a company in 1907, and headquartered in Wheeling, Illinois. The company was acquired by Böwe Systec in 2003. Since 2010, the brand name has been licensed for a variety of consumer electronics products.

==History==


According to its charter, the Bell &amp; Howell Company was incorporated on February 17, 1907. It was recorded in the Cook County Record Book eight days later. The first meeting of stockholders took place in the office of Attorney W. G. Strong on February 19 at 10 a.m. (10:00 CT). The first board of directors was chosen for a term of one year: Donald Joseph Bell (1869–1934), chairman; Albert Summers Howell (1879–1951), secretary; and Marguerite V. Bell (wife of Donald Bell), vice chairman.

The firm made products for the motion picture industry. The Bell &amp; Howell 2709 was the first all metal, commercially available motion picture camera. The 2709 was so expensive that only Charlie Chaplin and three other people owned one, while the rest were owned by studios.

Bell &amp; Howell introduced products that improved the quality of projected images in a movie theater. The Kinodrome 35-mm projector mechanism, introduced in 1907, steadied projected images and reduced the flicker that can occur during motion-picture projection. The 35-mm perforator, introduced in 1910, set the standard throughout the industry as to the expected distance and width of the sprocket holes running on each side of the 35-mm film; before this there had been no agreed upon standard

Bell &amp; Howell developed a continuous film printing process in 1911, that was gradually accepted across the film printing industry.

Historically, Bell &amp; Howell Co. was an important supplier of many different media technologies, and it produced products such as:

*Newsreel and amateur film cameras such as the Filmo (end of 1923) and Eyemo (1925), and Autoload EE (1956)
* Military Gun sight TYPE N-8
* Regular-8 and Super-8 film cameras and projectors (all models)
* 16mm silent and sound projectors (all models)
*Slide projectors (2&quot; × 2&quot;; 5 cm x 5 cm)
* 35mm filmstrip projectors
* Overhead presentation projectors (all models)
* Stereo cameras and stereo slide projectors through its TDC subsidiary
* Slide Cube Projector, circa 1970

In 1934, Bell &amp; Howell introduced their first amateur 8mm movie projector, in 1935 the Filmo Straight Eight camera, and in 1936 the Double-Run Filmo 8. The 1938 Kodak cassette holding of Double-Eight film was taken by the Filmo Auto-8 in 1940.

The firm added microfilm products in 1946. In 1954, Bell &amp; Howell purchased DeVry Industries&#x27; 16mm division.

Although known for manufacturing their film projectors, a partnership with Canon between 1961 and 1976 offered still cameras. Many of their 35mm SLR cameras were manufactured by Canon with the Bell &amp; Howell logo or Bell &amp; Howell/Canon in place of the Canon branding. The firm dropped the production of movie cameras by the end of the 1970s.

Bell &amp; Howell was a supplier of media equipment for schools and offices. The film laboratory line is now a separate company, BHP Inc, which is a division of Research Technology International.

In 1960, Bell &amp; Howell merged with an Electronics and Instrumentation company CEC, Lennox Road, Basingstoke, UK. This facility produced pressure transducers and other devices for applications in areas such as North Sea oil platforms, the chemical industry, and the Ariane Space vehicles. This division was divested to Transamerica Corporation in 1983.

In 1977, Bell &amp; Howell signed an agreement with BASF to develop a new amateur videotape recorder, which would have made use of a tape on which 28 of parallel tracks were to be recorded with the aid of a fixed head. The machine was expected to be ready by Christmas 1979, but did not reach the market.

Bell &amp; Howell purchased University Microfilms International in the 1980s. UMI produced a product called ProQuest.

In the 2000s, Bell &amp; Howell decided to focus on their information technology businesses. The imaging business was sold to Eastman Kodak, and the international mail business was sold to Pitney Bowes. On June 6, 2001, Bell &amp; Howell became a ProQuest Company, which was then a publicly traded company, but is now a subsidiary of the private Cambridge Information Group. In September 2001, the remaining industrial businesses along with the Bell &amp; Howell name were sold to private equity firm Glencoe Capital.

The company merged with the North American arm of Böwe Systec Inc. Later, in 2003, Böwe Systec acquired the entire company. The company was known as Böwe Bell &amp; Howell until 2011, when Versa Capital Management bought the company out of bankruptcy and renamed the company &quot;Bell and Howell, LLC&quot;.

In 2010 consumer electronics manufacturer Elite Brands licensed the Bell + Howell brand name to use on optical and imaging products including digital cameras and camcorders, binoculars, telescopes, lenses, and various camera accessories. BHH, LLC has also expanded licensing of the Bell + Howell brand name for a range of products including lighting and security, personal care, tools, pest control, auto accessories and luggage.

In 2011 a digital video recorder was released featuring the Bell + Howell brand.

In 2017 the company spun off the mail sorting business, including vote by mail, to Fluence Automation, 
which was then acquired by BlueCrest Inc. in 2021.
BlueCrest had acquired the Pitney-Bowes document messaging business in 2018.

In December 2018, Versa Capital Management, LLC (&quot;Versa&quot;) announced the successful closing of the sale of Bell and Howell to Boston-based WestView Capital Partners (&quot;WestView&quot;).

==Apple II==
Bell &amp; Howell marketed a specially designed Apple II Plus computer to the educational market beginning in July 1979. The modified Apple had additional security elements for classroom use such as a tamper-proof cover. The case color was black but the inside was a standard Apple II Plus. The modified Apple II became known colloquially among computer enthusiasts as the &quot;Darth Vader&quot; Apple II for its black case design.

== Education Group ==
Bell &amp; Howell founded an Education Group within the company in 1907. This Education Group created Bell &amp; Howell Schools in 1966. In that same year, the Education Group purchased a controlling share of DeVry Institute of Technology. Two years later in 1968, Bell &amp; Howell&#x27;s Education Group, via a controlling interest in DeVry, acquired Ohio Institute of Technology in Columbus, Ohio. Over the years, the Education Group has bought and sold large interests in a variety of educational organizations and institutions, including Heathkit which supplied electronics kits for Bell &amp; Howell courses.

<text>Fort Frances is a town in, and the seat of, Rainy River District in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. The population as of the 2021 census was 7,466 Fort Frances is a popular fishing destination. It hosts the annual Fort Frances Canadian Bass Championship.

Located on the international border with the United States where Rainy Lake narrows to become Rainy River, it is connected to International Falls, Minnesota by the Fort Frances–International Falls International Bridge. The town is the fourth-largest community in Northwestern Ontario after Thunder Bay, Kenora and Dryden. The Fort Frances Paper Mill was formerly the main employer and industry in the town until its closure in January 2014. New Gold, a Canadian mining company, acquired mineral rights to the area in 2013. The Rainy River mine commenced processing ore on September 14, 2017 and completed its first gold pour on October 5, 2017.

== History ==

Fort Frances was the first European settlement west of Lake Superior and was established by French Canadian Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye, first commander of the western district. In 1731, he built Fort Saint Pierre near that spot as support for the fur trade with native peoples. In 1732, his expedition built Fort Saint Charles on Magnuson&#x27;s Island on the west side of Lake of the Woods. After some time, Fort Saint Pierre fell out of use.

In 1817, following the War of 1812 and the redefinition of borders between Canada and the United States, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) built a fort here. In 1830 HBC Chief Factor John Dugald Cameron named the fur trading post after Frances Ramsay Simpson, the 18-year-old daughter of a London merchant, who had married earlier that year in London, George Simpson, Governor of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, who would visit the fort many times. In 1841 she became Lady Simpson after George Simpson was knighted, and she died in 1853 at Lachine, Quebec.
Incorporated in 1903, the town held a big centennial celebration in 2003.

The main employer was a pulp and paper mill established in the early 1900s. It had numerous owners over the years, notably Edward Wellington Backus. Most recently owned by Resolute Forest Products, the mill employed about 700 persons until its closure in 2014.

On June 25, 1946, the town was struck by a tornado, which caused major damage and struck a week after the deadly Windsor tornado.

On August 25, 2013, the town hosted the final pitstop in the Kraft Celebration Tour by receiving the most votes out of all 20 communities

On January 14, 2014, Resolute Forest Products announced that it planned to stop operations of the final paper machine and close out its operations in Fort Frances by the end of the month.

On December 13, 2014, Tim Hortons filmed a commercial in Fort Frances. The commercial, which dubs Fort Frances &quot;one of the coldest places in Canada&quot;, was shot at the local Tim Hortons. In the days leading up to the filming, yarn was seen covering trees, benches, etc. Workers had spent the night covering the interior of the restaurant with yarn and building a giant toque on the roof. For the day, the coffee was free.

In August 2015 the Seven Generations Education Institute hosted the World Indigenous Nations Higher Education Consortium&#x27;s (WINHEC) Annual General Meeting at the Nanicost Grounds for members attending from all over the world.

<doc id="1217003" wikidata="Q5472217" url="?curid=1217003" title="Fort Vancouver National Historic Site">
<text>Fort Vancouver National Historic Site is a United States National Historic Site located in the states of Washington and Oregon. The National Historic Site consists of two units, one located on the site of Fort Vancouver in modern-day Vancouver, Washington; the other being the former residence of John McLoughlin in Oregon City, Oregon. The two sites were separately given national historic designation in the 1940s. The Fort Vancouver unit was designated a National Historic Site in 1961, and was combined with the McLoughlin House into a unit in 2003.

==Visitor Center==
The visitor center at Fort Vancouver National Historic Site was originally built in 1966 as a part of the National Park Service&#x27;s Mission 66 Program. Today, the visitor center is co-operated by both the National Park Service and the United States Forest Service. Recent renovations to the visitor center (2015) transformed the historic building as an information center for both Fort Vancouver National Historic Site and the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. The visitor center features rotating archaeological exhibits from the national historic site and art exhibits from local native artists. The building also has a theater that shows 2 films from the National Park Service and the United States Forest Service: Oregon Experience: Fort Vancouver (25 mins), and Mount St. Helens - &quot;Eruption of Life&quot; (17 mins).

==HBC Fort Vancouver site==

The main unit of the site, containing Fort Vancouver, is located in Vancouver, Washington, just north of Portland, Oregon. Fort Vancouver was an important Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) fur trading post that was established in 1824. Operations until 1845 were overseen by Chief Factor John McLoughlin. It was the headquarters of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s fur trade activity on the Pacific coast and its influence stretched from the Rocky Mountains in the east, to Alaska in the north, Alta California in the south, and to the Kingdom of Hawaii in the Pacific. Ratified in 1846, the Treaty of Oregon was signed by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the United States, thereby ending the decades long Oregon boundary dispute. The treaty permitted the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to continue to operate at Fort Vancouver, which was now within the Oregon Territory. On June 14, 1860, Fort Vancouver was abandoned by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in favor of their stations in British Columbia, such as Fort Victoria.In 1849, the United States Army constructed the Vancouver Barracks adjacent to the British trading post; and took over the facility when it was abandoned. A fire destroyed the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company fort in 1866, but the Army facility continued in operation in various forms until the present. Fort Vancouver was separated from the Army&#x27;s barracks and became a national monument in 1948. Congress expanded the protected area in 1966 and re-designated the site as a National Historic Site. For some years after its addition to the National Park System, the National Park Service was reluctant to begin reconstruction of the fort walls or buildings, preferring to manage it as an archaeological site as provided by its standing policies. However, in 1965, with the urging of the local community, Congress directed reconstruction to begin. All fort structures seen today are modern replicas, albeit carefully placed on the original locations.
In response to concerns about the designation of reconstructed structures, the Park Service designated the Vancouver National Historic Reserve Historic District to encompass reconstructed buildings as well as historic Army and Mission 66-era Park Service structures.

==McLoughlin House site==
The McLoughlin House unit consists of the homes of McLoughlin and Dr. Forbes Barclay, an explorer and associate of McLoughlin&#x27;s; the two homes are known respectively as the McLoughlin House and the Barclay House. They are located adjacent to each other on a overlooking the Willamette River in Oregon City, Oregon, on a plot of land set aside for public use by McLoughlin in the 1840s.

In 1846, McLoughlin left the employ of Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, and purchased from the company a land claim located on the Willamette River in Oregon City. McLoughlin constructed the house there, and lived there until his death in 1857. The house, a two-style colonial mansion, is typical of East Coast residences from the time.

After McLoughlin&#x27;s death in 1857, his widow lived there until she died three years later; their heirs sold the house in 1867. The home soon became a bordello known as the Phoenix Hotel. In 1908, the paper mill that owned the property wished to expand and the house was threatened with demolition, but preservationists saved it the next year, raising over $1,000 and overcoming a referendum. In 1910 the house was moved from the riverfront to its current location on a bluff overlooking downtown Oregon City. It sat there for twenty-five years, until being restored in 1935–1936 under the auspices of the Civil Works Administration, and opened as a museum.

The Barclay House was built in 1849 by Portland carpenter and pioneer John L. Morrison, and occupied by Dr. Barclay and his family. Barclay died in 1874; the house remained in the family&#x27;s possession until 1930 when it was moved from the waterfront to its present location, next to the McLoughlin House. Today, the Barclay House contains museum offices and a gift shop.

The McLoughlin House became a National Historic Site in 1941, and both homes were added to the National Park System in 2003, becoming part of the Fort Vancouver National Historic Site. The McLoughlin House unit lies on the Oregon National Historic Trail, a part of the National Trails System. The graves of McLoughlin and his wife are on the premises. The house contains both original and period furnishings.

==Pearson Air Museum==

Opened in a historic hangar in 1996, the Pearson Air Museum and The Jack Murdock Aviation Center showcases aviation history in the Vancouver area, and specifically Pearson Airfield. Today, the Pearson Air museum displays a number of aircraft, including a De Havilland DH-4 Liberty that has been restored to represent an aircraft from the US Army Air Corps 321st Observation Squadron that was stationed at Pearson Airfield in the 1930s. In June 2018, National Park Service Volunteers completed work on a replica of Silas Christofferson&#x27;s Curtis Pusher from scratch. The original plane was flown from the roof of the Multnomah Hotel in Portland, OR to the location of the modern day Pearson airfield. The replica is currently being exhibited at the Pearson Air Museum. Exhibits at the museum also feature the US Army Spruce Production Division, and the first transpolar flight which landed in 1937 on Pearson Field from Moscow, Russia. Models of the Russian Tupolev ANT-25 that made the first transpolar flight are on display at the museum. The museum also houses a Fleet Model 2 which was flown by Leah Hing, the first Chinese American woman to earn a pilot&#x27;s license. 

An earth-covered pedestrian land bridge was built over the Lewis and Clark Highway, as part of the Confluence Project, in 2007. It connects the site with the Columbia River.

==Vancouver Barracks==

Parts of the Vancouver Barracks were transferred to the National Park Service in 2012 when the US Army Reserve officially closed the post after its continuous occupation since 1849. The buildings are typically closed to the public, but there are outdoor exhibits.

Since the Post to Park transfer to the National Park Service in 2012, the NPS has been restoring and renovating the barracks buildings to be used as mixed-use structures. Future tenants of these buildings are expected to be other governmental agencies, community groups, and private businesses. The area is expected to feature a community center, office buildings, restaurants, and retail in addition to a future museum space for the Vancouver Barracks operated by the National Park Service. In 2016, the Gifford Pinchot National Forest moved its headquarters and administration operations to one of the renovated double infantry barracks buildings in the Vancouver Barracks. The United States Forest Service co-operates the visitor center on Fort Vancouver National Historic Site along with the National Park Service.

==Recreation==
A cross country running course is located at the site. The USA Cross Country Championships have been held at this site.

<doc id="1217008" wikidata="Q2604584" url="?curid=1217008" title="Adversary (comics)">
<text>The Adversary is a demonic supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

==Publication history==
The Adversary first appeared in &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #188 (December 1984), and was created by Chris Claremont and John Romita Jr.

==Fictional character biography==
The Adversary is a demon who was initially summoned by the X-Men member Forge several decades ago and has since come back to antagonize the X-Men and threaten the world.

During the Vietnam War, Forge saw his company slain by the North Vietnamese. Forge summoned the Adversary to destroy the attackers, but then regained his senses and banished the demon. Nevertheless, the Adversary had a foothold on the Earth thanks to Forge&#x27;s actions.

Years later, Forge&#x27;s mentor Nazé was killed and his form and memories stolen by a Dire Wraith, an alien parasite. The Nazé impostor summoned the Adversary, only to be destroyed by the demon. The Adversary was then able to escape the dimension to which he was bound, capturing Forge and his ally, Storm of the X-Men, and imprisoning them in Roma&#x27;s stronghold.

The Adversary then travelled to Dallas, Texas and battled the combined forces of the X-Men and Freedom Force in &quot;The Fall of the Mutants&quot;. Ultimately, the only way to permanently banish the Adversary was for nine souls to sacrifice themselves in a magical spell. The X-Men agreed, and Forge cast the spell. The X-Men died, but Roma secretly revived them.

The Adversary later returned to Earth, having been physically born, but was again banished by Forge, who was at the time affiliated with X-Factor.

In &quot;Fear Itself&quot;, Adversary attends the Devil&#x27;s Advocacy to discuss the Serpent&#x27;s actions on Earth.

The Adversary possesses Forge in &quot;Cable and X-Force&quot;, but is trapped in a mind prison in Dr. Nemesis&#x27; subconsciousness.

==Powers and abilities==
The Adversary is a powerful demon of the highest order and possesses vast supernatural powers. He is virtually invulnerable to anything but the most powerful magic and iron. He has superhuman strength and endurance.

He can enter and leave different planes of existence and dimensions at will and has reality-warping powers. He can also summon demons and other supernatural creatures to do his bidding.

==In other media==
The Adversary appears in the &quot;X-Men &#x27;97&quot; two-part episode &quot;Lifedeath&quot;, voiced by Alison Sealy-Smith. This version is an owl-like demon who feeds on negative emotions.

<doc id="1217023" wikidata="Q2745653" url="?curid=1217023" title="Postage stamps and postal history of Gabon">
<text>Gabon is a country in west central Africa sharing borders with the Gulf of Guinea to the west, Equatorial Guinea to the northwest, and Cameroon to the north, with the Republic of the Congo curving around the east and south. Its size is almost 270,000 km2 with an estimated population of 1,500,000. The capital and largest city is Libreville.

== First posts ==
The earliest post office was set up at Libreville in 1862; mail from there was routed through the British post office on Fernando Po (now Bioko). Mail used the stamps of the French Colonies general issue, cancelled with a &quot;GAB&quot; inside a lozenge of dots.

== First stamps ==
On 31 July 1886 Gabon issued its first stamps, which were surcharges on the existing stock, to cover shortages of the most-used values. The overprint consisted of &quot;GAB&quot; in dots, plus the new value. Additional surcharges in 1888 were just the numeral, while in 1889 the postage due stamps were overprinted &quot;GABON / TIMBRE&quot; in addition to the new value, to indicate their validity as regular stamps. Also in 1889 15c and 25c stamps were locally typeset; they were inscribed &quot;Gabon-Congo / POSTES&quot; in one corner, the value in the opposite corner, and a diagonal &quot;Republique Française&quot; across the middle. All of these early issues were produced in small numbers, and not often seen.
== French colonial stamps ==
From 1891 to 1904, Gabon was administered as part of the French Congo, but in connection with a grant of partial autonomy, it issued its own stamps in 1904. These were the stamps of the Navigation and Commerce Issue used by all the French colonies, and included 17 values ranging from 1c to 5fr.

This was followed in 1910 by a set using designs specific to Gabon; a Fang warrior, a view of Libreville, and a Fang woman, all printed in two colors. A first version included &quot;CONGO FRANÇAIS&quot; along with &quot;GABON&quot; in the inscription, but was soon supplanted by a redesign saying &quot;AFRIQUE EQUATORIALE&quot; instead.

As with many other colonies, leftover stamps of the Navigation &amp; Commerce issue were surcharged &quot;5&quot; and &quot;10&quot; in 1912.

From 1924 on, the 1910-series stamps were overprinted &quot;AFRIQUE EQUATORIALE FRANÇAISE&quot;, and from 1927 some of these were additionally surcharged with new values.

A new definitive series came out in 1932, comprising 24 values using three designs; a timber raft on the Ogooué River, a portrait of de Brazza, and a view of the village of Setta Kemma. This series was only briefly in use, since Gabon was absorbed into French Equatorial Africa and used its stamps thereafter.

== Independence ==

Although the Republic was proclaimed in November 1958, the people continued to use the stamps of French Equatorial Africa, and the first issue of the Republic came on its 1st anniversary, 28 November 1959, with two values depicting different views of Prime Minister Léon M&#x27;ba.

During the 1960s, issues followed a pattern generally common to France and the former French colonies; multicolored engraved stamps in an oblong format, either horizontal or vertical. Some were conscious imitations of French designs, such as the small-format coat of arms stamps that began appearing in 1969 and continuing into the 1980s (long after France itself had stopped using the design). The 1970s saw the gradual appearance of stamps designed primarily to appeal to American and European collectors, such as an issue featuring motorcycles in 1978, and Nobel laureates in 1995, but these have been the exception rather than the rule. In 1965 Gabon issued one of the first gold foil stamps, one honoring Albert Schweitzer.

<text>The National Civil Rights Museum is a complex of museums and historic buildings in Memphis, Tennessee; its exhibits trace the history of the civil rights movement in the United States from the 17th century to the present. The museum is built around the former Lorraine Motel, the site of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Two other buildings and their adjacent property, also connected with the King assassination, have been acquired as part of the museum complex.

After renovations, the museum reopened in 2014 with an increase in the amount of multimedia and interactive displays, as well as various short films to show highlights. The museum is owned and operated by the Lorraine Civil Rights Museum Foundation, based in Memphis. The Lorraine Motel is owned by the Tennessee State Museum and leased long term to the Foundation to operate as part of the museum complex. In 2016, the museum was honored by becoming an affiliate museum of the Smithsonian Institution. It is also a contributing property to the South Main Street Historic District of the National Register of Historic Places.

==Location and complex==
The complex is located at 450 Mulberry Street, with all properties except the Lorraine Motel owned by the Lorraine Civil Rights Museum Foundation. The motel is owned by the state of Tennessee and operated by the foundation under a 20-year lease with the state museum in Nashville.

The main museum is located on the south edge of downtown Memphis, in what is now the South Main Arts District, about six blocks east of the Mississippi River. The main site includes the museum, the Lorraine Motel, and associated buildings. The museum also owns the Young and Morrow Building at 422 Main Street, where James Earl Ray initially confessed (and later recanted) to shooting King. The complex includes Canipe&#x27;s Amusement Store at 418 Main Street, next to the rooming house where the murder weapon with Ray&#x27;s fingerprints was found. Included on these grounds is the brushy lot that stood between the rooming house and the motel.

The museum exhibits a number of vehicles of historic value or which are otherwise relevant to the time period. Vehicles on display include an International Harvester garbage truck in an exhibit on the 1968 Memphis sanitation strike that brought King to Memphis, James Earl Ray&#x27;s 1966 white Ford Mustang, a 1968 Cadillac and 1959 Dodge parked outside the motel, a re-creation of the burned shell of a Greyhound bus used by Freedom Riders, and a bus representative of the Montgomery bus boycott.

==History==

The site first opened as the 16-room Windsor Hotel in 1924, and was later known as the Marquette Hotel. In 1945, Walter Bailey purchased it and renamed it for his wife Loree and the song &quot;Sweet Lorraine&quot;.

During the segregation era, Bailey operated the hotel as upscale lodging that catered to a black clientele. After the Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned segregated businesses, Bailey believed he needed to improve the facility to compete with other hotels that were no longer whites-only. He expanded the complex significantly later that year, adding a second floor, a swimming pool, and drive-up access for new rooms on the south side of the complex. Accordingly, he then changed the name from the Lorraine Hotel to the Lorraine Motel. Many musicians stayed at the motel in the 1960s while recording at Memphis&#x27; Stax Records, including Ray Charles, Lionel Hampton, Aretha Franklin, Ethel Waters, Otis Redding, the Staple Singers and Wilson Pickett.

===Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.===

Civil rights movement leader Martin Luther King Jr. stayed in Room 306 of the Lorraine Motel in early April 1968, while working to organize protests around the ongoing Memphis sanitation strike. While standing on the balcony outside his room on the evening of April 4, King was shot once in the face by an unseen assassin. King was rushed to St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital, where he was pronounced dead about an hour later. James Earl Ray, a resident of a rooming house across the street from the motel, was convicted of King&#x27;s murder in 1969. Ray pleaded guilty to the murder, but later recanted his confession. The King family, alongside many others, have long believed that Ray was not the culprit and that the assassination was carried out by a group of conspirators, possibly including agents of the U.S. federal government. In the Loyd Jowers trial in 1999, a Memphis jury found Loyd Jowers, owner of a restaurant near the motel, liable for King&#x27;s wrongful death.

Within days of the assassination, King&#x27;s supporters began asking Bailey to build a permanent memorial at the Lorraine Motel, with one early suggestion being an eternal flame similar to the one at the grave of John F. Kennedy. On May 2, one of the caravans of marchers headed to participate in the Poor People&#x27;s March on Washington started its journey at the motel. King&#x27;s widow Corretta and Ralph Abernathy, his successor as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, unveiled a memorial plaque at the motel shortly before the march started. In June, Room 306 was converted into a shrine to King&#x27;s memory which was opened to the public. Touring the Dr. Martin Luther King Memorial Room was initially free, but later cost an admission fee of one dollar.

===Establishing the memorial foundation===

In the years following the assassination, business at the motel declined and Bailey ran into increasing debts, even as the assassination site became a frequent destination for sightseers. Approximately 15,000 people signed the motel&#x27;s guestbook in 1980, while a report by the Shelby County Office of Planning and Development that year estimated that 70,000 people took commercial tours that stopped at the motel annually. Based on the findings of this report, the county considered purchasing the motel and turning it into a memorial or museum.

In April 1982, Bailey defaulted on a $140,000 construction loan, causing the lender to attempt foreclosure on the property. Bailey filed for bankruptcy a few days later, halting the foreclosure auction, and the news of the foreclosure provoked local business leaders to try to save the motel. The Martin Luther King Memphis Memorial Foundation, a newly-established non-profit organization, agreed to purchase the motel from Bailey for $240,000, which it would need to raise from donors to finalize the sale. Later that year, the motel was added to the National Register of Historic Places, as part of the South Main Street Historic District.

The foundation held a series of fundraising events to purchase the motel property, including an exhibition basketball game at the Mid-South Coliseum that featured Magic Johnson, Isiah Thomas, George Gervin, and Marques Johnson. However, these efforts raised only $96,568 of the needed $240,000 in time for the set deadline of October 28, 1982, leading the motel to be placed back on the auction block. The foundation took out a $50,000 loan and was able to win the ensuing auction with its only bid of $144,000.

The group, which changed its name to the Lorraine Civil Rights Museum Foundation, stopped charging admission to tour Room 306 in March 1983. The foundation continued to operate the Lorraine as a single-room occupancy motel while seeking to raise funds to convert the building into a museum. However, it proved difficult to gather the millions of dollars needed for the construction. In May 1987, the foundation reached an agreement with the state of Tennessee, Shelby County, and the city of Memphis to develop the museum. The foundation agreed to sell the property to the state, which would provide $4.4 million in funding to build a museum that would be designed and controlled by the foundation, while the city and county would each provide another $2.2 million.

The motel closed to customers on January 10, 1988, when the state took possession of the property. Former owner Walter Bailey moved out of his residence in the motel that day after living there for over 40 years. Bailey died later that year.

===Jacqueline Smith protest===

When the motel closed, one of the remaining long-term tenants, Jacqueline Smith, refused to leave her room. Smith, who had lived at the motel since 1973 and had worked there as a housekeeper, protested the creation of the museum. Smith thought King would have objected to having millions of dollars spent on a memorial for him, evicting poor residents in the process, instead of policies and programs that would benefit the neighborhood community, which was generally lower-income and predominantly Black at the time. She saw the creation of the museum as part of a larger gentrification of the South Main Street area, pushing out poor residents as part of transforming it into the South Main Arts District.

Smith continued to live inside the closed motel, which was surrounded with an eight-foot-tall chain-link fence, for several weeks. On March 2, 1988, four sheriff&#x27;s deputies forcibly carried her out of the building, while she shouted, &quot;You people are making a mistake [...] If King were alive he wouldn&#x27;t want this.&quot; Before the eviction, Smith had told reporters, &quot;If I can&#x27;t live at The Lorraine, I&#x27;ll camp out on the sidewalk out front.&quot; After she was removed from the building and her belongings were dumped on the curb outside, she covered the items with a tarp and pitched a tent next to them.

Smith has lived outside the museum ever since, in a round-the-clock vigil that has lasted for more than 35 years. Her presence caused delays in the construction of the museum, as the construction work risked endangering her safety. As a result, she was ordered to leave her spot on the sidewalk outside the motel. On July 16, 1990, Smith was forcibly carried from that spot and dumped on the opposite side of the street.

Since her vigil began, Smith has spoken to thousands of museum visitors, including former president Jimmy Carter. Carter visited the museum site in December 1991 when his daughter Amy graduated from the Memphis College of Art, but did not enter the museum after listening to Smith&#x27;s criticisms, which Amy agreed with. However, when Carter received an award in September 1994 for his humanitarian work in Haiti, he attended the award ceremony at the museum, leading Smith to feel that he had betrayed her. In addition to her criticism of the gentrification of the South Main neighborhood, Smith has also criticized the museum for its inherent focus on the moment of King&#x27;s violent death, referring to it as the &quot;James Earl Ray Memorial&quot;. In a 2018 column in the &quot;Memphis Commercial Appeal&quot;, Smith elaborated on her stance, saying, &quot;Let&#x27;s relocate the museum within Memphis, along with its Klan hoods, James Earl Ray rifle, and other negative memorabilia and turn the Lorraine into an establishment that Dr. King and Memphis can be rightly proud of and where visitors can experience his dream in action.&quot;

===Museum opening in 1991===

The Foundation worked with Smithsonian Institution curator Benjamin Lawless to develop a design to save historical aspects of the site. The Nashville, Tennessee firm McKissack and McKissack was tapped to design a modern museum on those portions of the grounds that were not directly related to the assassination.

A groundbreaking ceremony for the museum was held on January 27, 1989. The museum was dedicated on July 4, 1991, and officially opened to the public on September 28, 1991. D&#x27;Army Bailey was the founding president of the museum.

In 1999, the Foundation acquired the Young and Morrow Building, and its associated vacant lot on the West side of Mulberry, as part of the museum complex. A tunnel was built under the lot to connect the building with the motel. The Foundation became the custodian of the police and evidence files associated with the assassination, including the rifle and fatal bullet. The latter are on display in a exhibit in the former Y &amp; M building, which opened September 28, 2002.

===Renegotiation of lease with state in 2007===
Through the years, there has been controversy over composition of the board of the museum Foundation and of the mission of the museum, as people have differing opinions. These issues came to a head in December 2007, as the museum foundation was asking the state, which owned the property, to extend its lease for 50 years rent-free. Bailey, a circuit court judge, said he was disappointed with the museum&#x27;s emphasis on history. He said that he had envisioned it as an institution to inspire activism. By 2007, members of the board included whites from the corporate world. Bailey and other community activists criticized the board as &quot;too white&quot; and claimed they were shutting out the community. Beverly Robertson, then director of the museum, defended the board and the museum&#x27;s operation.

Gregory Duckett, a board member, disagreed with Bailey&#x27;s interpretation, saying the museum was never designed as an activist institution. Robertson noted that many board members were African Americans who had been activists and also entered corporate life. In 2007, the state agreed to a 20-year lease, while taking over major maintenance of the complex. It required the museum board to hold annual public meetings and increase the number of African-American board members.

===2012 renovations===

The main museum closed in November 2012 for a $27.5 million renovation, to include changes to exhibits and upgrades to building systems. The exhibits were updated for historical accuracy and to add to their evocative power; the work was guided by a group of recognized civil rights scholars. Many of the museum&#x27;s most popular exhibits did not change, such as Room 306 (where King was staying when he died), the replica sanitation truck (King came to Memphis to support an AFSCME sanitation workers&#x27; strike), and the replica of the bus Rosa Parks rode in Montgomery, Alabama, before initiating the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955–1956. The original bus resides at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.

In the 2014 reopening, a major new exhibit featured is a replica of the U.S. Supreme Court room where oral argument was heard in 1954 in the seminal &quot;Brown v. Board of Education,&quot; in which the Court ruled that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. This was a major victory for the civil rights movement. The museum has several interactive kiosks where patrons can access audio, images, text and video about the full civil rights movement. Visitors can search for text based on event, location, or theme. Many exhibits now feature &quot;listening stations&quot; where patrons with headphones can hear audio about the exhibit they are seeing; one features the voice of Malcolm X in a debate. More than 40 new short films throughout the museum also enhance the effect of the exhibits.

The renovated museum opened to the public on April 5, 2014. The Associated Press review said, &quot;The powerful, visceral exhibit[s set] the tone for an evocative, newly immersive museum experience that chronicles the history of the civil rights struggle in America.&quot; King scholar Clayborne Carson of Stanford University said that the museum&#x27;s renovations present &quot;the best and most recent scholarship on civil rights available today&quot;.

<doc id="1217044" wikidata="Q2930473" url="?curid=1217044" title="C. E. Brock">
<text>Charles Edmund Brock (5 February 1870 – 28 February 1938) was a widely published English painter, line artist and book illustrator, who signed most of his work C. E. Brock. He was the eldest of four artist brothers, including Henry Matthew Brock, also an illustrator.

==Early life==
Brock was born on 5 February 1870 in Holloway, London. The family later settled in Cambridge. He studied art briefly under sculptor Henry Wiles.

==Name confusion==
Charles Edmund Brock of Cambridge was sometimes confused with the unrelated Charles Edmond Brock (1882–1952) of London, a portrait painter who painted members of the Royal Family and the aristocracy, and was the son of English Sculptor Thomas Brock RA (1 March 184722 August 1922).

The confusion was so great that they even found themselves paying each other&#x27;s bills. They solved by agreeing that Charles Edmund of Cambridge would stop using Edmund and that Charles Edmond of London would stop using Charles. In Graves&#x27; &quot;Dictionary of Contributors&quot; to the Royal Academy he lists the Cambridge Brock as Charles E. Brock - Painter, and the London Brock as C. Edmond Brock - Painter.

This was not the only confusion. One report of a Cambridge Council meeting attributed the Victoria Memorial to C. E. Brock. &quot;The name of the sculptor to which the commission for a bust of Queen Victoria is entrusted is Mr. Thomas Brock, R.A., and not, of course, Mr. C. E, Brock, stated by a mistake which crept into our report of the meeting last week.&quot;

==Work==
Brock received his first book commission at the age of 20 in 1890. He became very successful, and illustrated books for authors such as Jonathan Swift, William Thackeray, Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, and George Eliot. Brock also contributed pieces to several magazines such as &quot;The Quiver&quot;, &quot;The Strand&quot;, and &quot;Pearsons&quot;. He used the Cambridge college libraries for his &quot;picture research.&quot; In illustration Brock is best known for his line work, initially working in the tradition of Hugh Thomson, but he was also a skilled colourist. As a painter he received plaudits for his realism and vibrancy he created in his work. Only a small quantity of his paintings have been located which is why their prices have been so high.

Brock and his brothers maintained a Cambridge studio filled with various curios, antiques, furniture, and a costume collection. They owned a large collection of Regency era costume prints and fashion plates, and had clothes specially made as examples for certain costumes. Using these, family members modeled for each other.

Unequivocally the most famous and valuable paintings in Brock&#x27;s career were his golf paintings – &quot;The Bunker&quot;; &quot;The Drive;&quot; and &quot;The Putt&quot; – all of which were painted in 1894 as part of the same series.These paintings were acquired together by a Japanese collector in 1991 for $1.5 million. The most valuable of these is &quot;The Putt&quot;, which was repainted due to the position of the caddy and bystander as the commissioner of the painting wanted to bring himself, the putter, more into the forefront of the painting. The initial unsigned painting is considered to be the more impressive of the two versions, and is even used as the print for postcards and posters sold in many golf museums.

Brock published 109 illustrations in Punch between 6 February 1901 and 30 March 1910. He output in Punch tapered off after 1905 and he did not publish any more work in Punch after 1910. Brock continued to work on book illustration and on portraits. Some of the portraits by Brock in national collections date from the 1920. He continued to illustrate books right up until his death, with Gunby Hadath&#x27;s &quot;Pamela: A Story for Girls&quot; (1938) being one of the last books he illustrated. Books he was working on at the time of his death were completed by other illustrators. Brock was one of the twenty leading illustrators selected by Percy Bradshaw for a portfolio in his 1917/1918 &quot;The Art of the Illustrator&quot;.

Brock was an occasional exhibitor at various venues. He died on 28 February 1938 in Cambridge.

==Style==
The approach of C.E. Brock&#x27;s work varied with the sort of story he was illustrating. Some was refined and described as &quot;sensitive to the delicate, teacup-and-saucer primness and feminine outlook of the early Victorian novelists,&quot; while other work was &quot;appreciative of the healthy, boisterous, thoroughly English characters&quot; – soldiers, rustics, and &quot;horsey types.&quot; Other illustrations were grotesqueries drawn to amuse children looking at or reading storybooks.

==Assessment==
Joseph Pennell in his &quot;Pen Drawing and Pen Draughtmanship . . .&quot; made the following assessment of Brock at the very start of his career as an illustrator:
&quot;Mr. Brock has come out with &quot;Hood&#x27;s Humorous Poems&quot;. His drawing can scarce be called original, — there are many reminiscences in it, — but his humour, dramatic action, and his arrangement are quite his own. H is sense of illustration is good, and is well shown in the concentration on the black horse and black cap of the huntsman in the title; possibly this is exaggerated, but it is a good sort of exaggeration. In the other drawing, &quot; The Supper Superstition&quot;, the story is extremely well told with movement and go. There are several other drawings in the book quite as good; enough of them to prove that Mr. Brock has something to say for himself, besides showing how well he has studied other people.&quot;

==Examples of complete book illustrations==
The following examples show what a complete set of illustrations for a single book look like.

===An adventure novel===
Brock illustrated a new edition of Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s Ivanhoe for Service &amp; Paton in 1897. The new edition had 16 full page illustrations. New illustrations were one of the ways in which publishers tried to sell titles were had already had a number of editions. The illustrations are by courtesy of The British Library the whole book is available on-line. The illustrations for Ivanhoe would have benefited from the props that the Brock&#x27;s kept in their studio to serve as examples for arms, clothing, and so on.

===A book for children===
Lucas Malet was the pseudonym of Mary St Leger Kingsley (4 June 1852 – 27 October 1931), a Victorian novelist. Although most of here output was for adults, she did produce some juvenile fiction In 1887, Kegan Paul &amp; Co. published Malet&#x27;s short book &quot;Little Peter: A Christmas Morality for Children of any Age&quot; with nine full page illustrations including the frontispiece, and several smaller ones, by Paul Hardy. The book tells the story of a small boy who befriends a very ugly and socially-despised man, who saves him in the end. The story was apparently popular as it was reprinted numerous times, most recently in 2010. In 1909, Henry Frowde and Hodder &amp; Stoughton&#x27;s joint venture reissued the book, but this time with eight full-page colour illustrations, including the frontispiece, by Charles Brock. The costs of colour illustration had decreased significantly since the 1887 edition, and colour was now the norm for books for younger children. This was good news for an artist as versatile as Brock, as it increased the options for selling his work. The following illustrations show the story in outline.

<doc id="1217049" wikidata="Q434166" url="?curid=1217049" title="Altalena Affair">
<text>The &quot;Altalena&quot; Affair was a violent confrontation that took place in June 1948 between the newly created Israel Defense Forces and the Irgun (also known as Etzel), one of the Jewish paramilitary groups that were in the process of merging to form the IDF. The confrontation involved a cargo ship, the &quot;Altalena&quot;, captained by ex-US Navy lieutenant Monroe Fein and led by senior Etzel commander Eliyahu Lankin, which had been loaded with weapons and fighters by the independent Irgun, but arrived during the murky period of the Irgun&#x27;s absorption into the IDF. Nineteen Israelis, three of them IDF soldiers and 16 of them Irgun members, were killed in the confrontation. The incident brought the newfound Israel to the brink of civil war.

==History==
As the British Mandate for Palestine was coming to an end, and following the United Nations General Assembly vote recommending the Partition Plan for Mandatory Palestine, which took place on 29 November 1947, Jewish leaders proclaimed the establishment of the State of Israel on May 14, 1948. The declaration of independence was followed by the establishment of a provisional government and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The process of absorbing all military organizations into the IDF proved complicated, and several paramilitary groups continued to be active outside the IDF. One of the largest groups, the Irgun, planned to ship weapons and fighters to the newly formed state. The plans included a ship renamed &quot;Altalena&quot; (a &quot;nom de plume&quot; of Zionist leader Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky) and a target date for the ship&#x27;s arrival from Europe was set to mid-May 1948. The &quot;Altalena&quot;, former landing ship tank USS &quot;LST-138&quot;, organized by Hillel Kook (a.k.a., Peter Bergson) purchased by Irgun members Gershon Hakim, Abraham Stavsky, and Victor Ben-Nachum, was originally intended to reach Israel on 15 May 1948, loaded with fighters and military equipment.

Weapons valued at 153 million francs were donated by the French government, in accordance with a secret agreement approved by French Foreign Minister Georges Bidault. The exact text of the agreement has not been found, and the French motivation is unclear. However, it is known that Bidault was very concerned about the possibility of a Jordanian takeover of Jerusalem. Deputy Chief of Staff General Henri Coudraux, who was involved in the operation, told a 1949 inquiry that France had &quot;reached a secret agreement with the Irgun, which promised it advantages if it were to come into power [in Israel].&quot; He described the Irgun&#x27;s representative in the negotiations, Shmuel Ariel, as &quot;a terrorist who did not represent a legitimate organization and acted to take power by force.&quot;

According to Begin biographer Daniel Gordis, organizational matters took longer than expected, and the sailing was postponed for several weeks. Meanwhile, on 1 June, an agreement had been signed for the absorption of the Irgun into the IDF and one of the clauses stated that the Irgun had to cease all independent arms acquisition activities. Consequently, the Irgun informed the Israeli government about the &quot;Altalena&quot;.

The Irgun headquarters in Paris did their best to keep the &quot;Altalena&quot;″s preparations for departure a secret, but it was difficult to conceal the movement of 940 men and the loading of a large quantity of arms and ammunition. It was feared that if the plans were discovered, attempts might be made to sabotage the &quot;Altalena&quot; at sea.

For this reason, when it raised anchor on 11 June, no cable was sent to the Irgun command in Israel, for fear that it would fall into the wrong hands. These precautionary measures proved fruitless, however, and the following day the BBC reported that the &quot;Altalena&quot; had sailed from Port-de-Bouc, France, in the direction of Israel with 940 Jewish volunteers and a large quantity of weapons on board.

The first truce in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War had also begun on 11 June and when the Irgun leaders in Israel learned through the BBC broadcast of the embarkation of the vessel, they feared that this breach of the truce conditions (i.e., the ban on bringing military equipment and fighters into the country) would be discovered (though ultimately, these aspects of the truce were ignored by both sides). Menachem Begin decided therefore to postpone the arrival of the ship, and Irgun staff secretary, Zippora Levi-Kessel sent a wireless message to the &quot;Altalena&quot; to stay put and await orders. A similar cable was sent to Shmuel Katz (member of the General Headquarters), who was then in Paris, but the ship had already departed the day before the message arrived.

On 15 June, Begin and his comrades held a meeting with government representatives, at which Begin announced that the ship had sailed without his knowledge and that he wanted to hold consultations on how to proceed. In his diary for 16 June, David Ben-Gurion, the head of the provisional government, wrote:

Yisrael [Galili] and Skolnik [Levi Eshkol] met yesterday with Begin. Tomorrow or the next day their ship is due to arrive: 4,500 tons, bringing 800–900 men, 5,000 rifles, 250 Bren guns, 5 million bullets, 50 bazookas, 10 Bren carriers. Zipstein (director of Tel Aviv port) assumes that at night it will be possible to unload it all. I believe we should not endanger Tel Aviv port. They should not be sent back. They should be disembarked at an unknown shore.

Galili informed Begin of Ben-Gurion&#x27;s consent to the landing of the ship, adding a request that it be done as quickly as possible. Zippora Levi-Kessel then radioed the vessel to come in at full speed. The following day, a working meeting was held between Irgun representatives and Defense Ministry personnel. While the Irgun proposed directing the &quot;Altalena&quot; to Tel Aviv beach, Defense Ministry representatives claimed that Kfar Vitkin beach was preferable, as it would be easier to evade UN observers there. The ship was therefore instructed to make for Kfar Vitkin.

==Confrontation with the IDF==
Intense negotiations between representatives of the provisional government (headed by Ben-Gurion) and the Irgun (headed by Begin) followed the departure of the &quot;Altalena&quot; from France. Among the issues discussed were logistics of its landing and distribution of the cargo. Whilst there was agreement on the anchoring place of the &quot;Altalena&quot;, there were differences of opinion about the cargo. Ben-Gurion agreed to Begin&#x27;s initial request that 20 percent of the weapons be dispatched to the Irgun&#x27;s Jerusalem Battalion, which was still fighting independently. His second request that the remainder be transferred to the IDF to equip the newly incorporated Irgun battalions was rejected by the government representatives, who interpreted the request as a demand to reinforce an &quot;army within an army&quot;.

The &quot;Altalena&quot; reached Kfar Vitkin in the late afternoon of Sunday, 20 June, greeted by Menachem Begin and a group of Irgun members on shore. Irgun sympathizers from the nearby town of Netanya and residents of the fishing village of Mikhmoret gathered on the beach to help unload the cargo. After the ship dropped anchor, 940 passengers disembarked and were taken to an army camp for induction into the IDF. Arms were unloaded throughout the night. In all, 2,000 rifles, two million rounds of ammunition, 3,000 shells, and 200 Bren guns were unloaded at Kfar Vitkin. Concomitantly with the events at Kfar Vitkin, the government had convened in Tel Aviv for its weekly meeting. Ben-Gurion reported on the meetings which had preceded the arrival of the &quot;Altalena&quot; and was adamant that Begin hand over the weapons:

We must decide whether to hand over power to Begin or to order him to cease his separate activities. If he does not do so, we will open fire! Otherwise, we must decide to disperse our own army.
The debate ended in a resolution to empower the army to use force if necessary. Implementation was assigned to the Alexandroni Brigade commanded by (Epstein), which the following day surrounded the Kfar Vitkin area in two regiments equipped with armor and artillery. In addition, the Israeli Navy deployed three corvettes off Kfar Vitkin. Even issued the following ultimatum:

To: M. BeginBy special order from the Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces, I am empowered to confiscate the weapons and military materials which have arrived on the Israeli coast in the area of my jurisdiction in the name of the Israel Government. I have been authorized to demand that you hand over the weapons to me for safekeeping and to inform you that you should establish contact with the supreme command. You are required to carry out this order immediately. If you do not agree to carry out this order, I shall use all the means at my disposal in order to implement the order and to requisition the weapons which have reached shore and transfer them from private possession into the possession of the Israel government. I wish to inform you that the entire area is surrounded by fully armed military units and armored cars, and all roads are blocked. I hold you fully responsible for any consequences in the event of your refusal to carry out this order. The immigrants—unarmed—will be permitted to travel to the camps in accordance with your arrangements. You have ten minutes to give me your answer.D.E., Brigade Commander

The ultimatum was made, according to Even, &quot;in order not to give the Irgun commander time for lengthy considerations and to gain the advantage of surprise.&quot; Begin did not respond. Claiming he needed more time, he drove to Netanya to consult directly with government leaders. A standoff between the IDF and Irgun members at the beach ensued as a UN observation plane circled overhead and recorded the incident. Failing to reach an accord, Begin returned to the beach and conferred with his officers. As evening began, rifle fire broke out; which side fired first is a matter of dispute. Hillel Kook, an eyewitness, claimed it was the Irgun, which fired shots toward the sea to demonstrate their will to resist. As the fighting began, Begin fled to the &quot;Altalena&quot; in a rowboat, under fire from the corvettes offshore, and Captain Fein maneuvered the &quot;Altalena&quot; to shield Begin, enabling him to board safely. On shore, the Irgun fighters were compelled to surrender. The IDF suffered two dead and six wounded, while the Irgun suffered six dead and 18 wounded. In order to prevent further bloodshed, the residents of Kfar Vitkin initiated negotiations between Yaakov Meridor (Begin&#x27;s deputy) and Dan Even which ended in a general ceasefire and the transfer of the weapons on shore to the local IDF commander.


Meanwhile, Begin ordered the &quot;Altalena&quot; to sail to Tel Aviv, where there were more Irgun supporters. At 9:35 p.m., the &quot;Altalena&quot; began cruising toward Tel Aviv. Many Irgun members, who had joined the IDF earlier that month, left their bases and assembled on the beach. Rumors began circulating that the Irgun was planning a military coup.

According to the book &quot;Altalena&quot; by journalist and political analyst , Ben-Gurion instructed the Israeli Air Force to sink the ship on the high seas, long before it approached the shore. This would have resulted in much greater loss of life aboard. Gordon Levett, a Mahal volunteer pilot, wrote in his book &quot;Flying Under Two Flags&quot; that Heiman Shamir, deputy commander of the Air Force, tried to convince non-Jewish pilot volunteers to attack the ship. However, three pilots refused to participate in the mission, one of them saying, &quot;You can kiss my foot. I did not lose four friends and fly 10,000 miles in order to bomb Jews.&quot;

The &quot;Altalena&quot; was shadowed by navy corvettes on its way to Tel Aviv. As the ship neared the coastline, the corvettes began firing at it with bursts of machine gun fire, and stopped after fighters on board the &quot;Altalena&quot; returned fire with Bren guns mounted on deck. The &quot;Altalena&quot; arrived at midnight, running aground on the busiest stretch of shore, at the foot of David Frischmann Street, in view of locals, journalists, and UN observers watching from the terrace of the Kaete Dan Hotel (today Dan Tel Aviv). In response, Ben-Gurion ordered Yigael Yadin (acting chief of staff) to concentrate large forces on the Tel Aviv beach and to take the ship by force. He also indicated to his interior minister that he would order the Israeli Navy to intercept any attempt by the &quot;Altalena&quot; to retreat into international waters. The IDF transferred heavy guns to the area and at 4 p.m. the next day, Ben-Gurion ordered the shelling of the &quot;Altalena&quot;. The first gunner ordered to shell the ship, a Red Army veteran named Yosef Aksen, refused, saying he was willing to be executed for insubordination and this would be &quot;the best thing he did in his life.&quot; At this, his superior, Nathan Plotnik, ordered him to be imprisoned to await a court-martial for insubordination.

Then Hillel Daleski, a recent immigrant from South Africa, initially protested, telling Shmuel Admon, the commander of the IDF Artillery Corps, that &quot;I didn&#x27;t come to the Land of Israel to fight against Jews.&quot; However, his superior yelled at him that it was his duty to obey orders. Threatened with a court-martial if he did not fire, Daleski reluctantly complied. One of the shells hit the ship, and it began to burn.

Yitzhak Rabin commanded the IDF and Palmach forces on the shore. Yigal Allon later claimed that five or six shells were fired as warning shots, and hit the ship by accident. IDF troops on the shore also directed heavy small-arms fire towards the ship, and employed heavy machine guns with armor-piercing rounds. Some soldiers refused to open fire on the &quot;Altalena&quot;, including a Palmach soldier whose brother, an Irgun officer, was on board. Menachem Begin, hoping to avert civil war, ordered his men not to shoot back, and the ship raised the white flag. However, the firing continued, and some Irgun members on board reportedly returned fire. The Israeli corvettes also fired at the &quot;Altalena&quot; during the battle, and one crew member later claimed that IDF troops on the beach were hit by fire from one of the corvettes, which had aimed at the &quot;Altalena&quot; but overshot its target. On the beach, a battle between the IDF and Irgun forces along the shore erupted, and clashes between IDF and Irgun units also took place throughout Tel Aviv, mainly in the south and center.

Fearing the fire would spread to the holds which contained explosives, Captain Fein ordered all aboard to abandon ship. Passengers jumped into the water, whilst their comrades on shore set out to meet them on rafts. Begin biographer Daniel Gordis writes that although Captain Fein flew the white flag of surrender, automatic fire continued to be directed at the unarmed survivors swimming in the water. Begin, who was on deck, agreed to leave the ship only after the last of the wounded had been evacuated. Although civil war appeared imminent, a cease-fire was arranged by the evening of 22 June. Mass arrests were carried out against Irgun soldiers who had joined their former comrades, and Irgun units in the IDF were disbanded, with their soldiers dispersed among other units. In all, more than 200 Irgun members were arrested. Most were released several weeks later, with the exception of five senior commanders (Moshe Hason, Eliyahu Lankin, Yaakov Meridor, Bezalel Amitzur, and Hillel Kook), who were detained for more than two months, until 27 August, 1948. Eight IDF soldiers who refused to fire on the &quot;Altalena&quot; were court-martialed for insubordination.

Meanwhile, Begin reached his clandestine radio station and ordered his men not to fight back. He called for them to assemble in Jerusalem and continue the battle for the Old City.

Sixteen Irgun fighters were killed in the confrontation with the army (all but three were veteran members and not newcomers from the ship); six were killed in the Kfar Vitkin area and 10 on Tel Aviv beach. Three IDF soldiers were killed: two at Kfar Vitkin and one in Tel Aviv.

==Aftermath==
About a year after the incident, the &quot;Altalena&quot; was refloated, towed 15 miles out to sea, and sunk.

The &quot;Altalena&quot; Affair exposed deep rifts between the main political factions in Israel, and is still occasionally referenced in Israeli media to illustrate the current debate as to whether or not the use of force by the Israeli government against fringe Jewish political elements is legitimate. Proponents of Ben-Gurion&#x27;s actions praised them as essential to establishing the government&#x27;s authority and discouraging factionalism and formation of rival armies. This was consistent with other actions he took, such as dissolving the Palmach later that year. Furthermore, Ben-Gurion&#x27;s supporters have argued that a state must have a monopoly over the use of force. The Irgun, by attempting to import weapons to use as a private militia, was undermining the legitimacy of the fledgling State of Israel.

Opponents condemned what they saw as unnecessary violence. The debate was reignited for a short time when Likud headed by Menachem Begin won the 1977 elections.

Begin later said, &quot;My greatest accomplishment was not retaliating and causing civil war.&quot; Years later, on the eve of the Six-Day War, in June 1967 (when Levi Eshkol was prime minister), Menachem Begin joined a delegation which visited Sde Boker to ask David Ben-Gurion to return and accept the premiership again. After that meeting, Ben-Gurion said that if he had then known Begin as he did now, the face of history would have been different.

In 2012, the wreckage of the &quot;Altalena&quot; was discovered by marine experts hired by the Menachem Begin Heritage Center in a search effort that the Israeli government helped to fund. The search was initially based on Israeli Navy&#x27;s coordinates on the location where it was sunk, but after failing to turn up results, the search area was expanded. The &quot;Altalena&quot; was eventually found sitting on the seabed several kilometers off the coast of Rishon LeZion at a depth of about . A sonar survey confirmed the ship&#x27;s identity. The Israeli government subsequently announced plans to raise the wreck and install it on dry land as a monument.

==Legacy==

The first memorial to the sixteen Irgun fighters and three IDF soldiers killed in the &quot;Altalena&quot; sinking was erected in the Nahalat Yitzhak Cemetery in Givatayim in 1998. The official government memorial ceremony for the victims is held annually on the cemetery grounds. The ceremony is primarily attended by relatives of the victims and political personalities identified with Israel&#x27;s national camp.

In 2011, invitations circulated by Israel&#x27;s Ministry of Defense used the word &quot;murdered&quot; in reference to the fighters who lost their lives in the incident, implying that Ben-Gurion, Rabin, and the IDF had committed murder. Defense Minister Ehud Barak subsequently demanded that the &quot;severe mishap&quot; be investigated and corrected. Speaker of the Knesset at the time and subsequently president of Israel Reuven Rivlin said at the ceremony that the &quot;Altalena&quot; Affair was an unatonable crime.

Every year, a cruise led by the Hazon Leumi organization leaves from the port of Jaffa to the place where the ship sank, where a memorial ceremony is held in memory of those who died on the ship.

<text>The Serpent Society is an organization of snake-themed supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The society is a continuation of the original group the Serpent Squad and was later changed into Serpent Solutions. The Serpent Society first appeared in &quot;Captain America&quot; #310 (October 1985) and was created by writer Mark Gruenwald and artist Paul Neary. Serpent Solutions first appeared in &quot;Captain America: Sam Wilson&quot; #1 by writer Nick Spencer and artist Daniel Acuña.

The Serpent Society have appeared in various media outside comics, including the animated series &quot;The Avengers: Earth&#x27;s Mightiest Heroes&quot; and &quot;Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers&quot; and the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Captain America: Brave New World&quot;.

==Publication history==
The Serpent Society was formed by Sidewinder as he gathered a number of villains with snake-themed powers. The group was organized more like a supervillain labor union, with the members providing protection for each other, sharing profits, and organizing profitable crimes. The Society worked, on an as-needed basis, for criminal organizations such as HYDRA, the Maggia, the Kingpin, and A.I.M. Some of these jobs brought the Serpent Society into conflict with Captain America and his partners. At one point, the Viper took control of the Society, plotting to take control of the United States, but was ultimately foiled by Captain America, D-Man, Nomad, the Falcon and former members of the Serpent Society. The Society would briefly reform over the years, but never made much impact.
As part of the All-New Marvel NOW! branding, a resurrected Viper (Jordan Stryke) took control of the Serpent Society. He reorganized it as &quot;Serpent Solutions&quot; and provided their services to various corporations. Serpent Solutions were opposed by the new Captain America, formerly known as Falcon.
===Concept and creation===
The Serpent Society first appeared in &quot;Captain America&quot; #310 (Oct. 1985) and was created by Mark Gruenwald and Paul Neary. Serpent Solutions first appeared in &quot;Captain America: Sam Wilson&quot; #1 by writer Nick Spencer and artist Daniel Acuña.

Most of the villains Mark Gruenwald introduced in &quot;Captain America&quot; were created to symbolize aspects of contemporary American culture and the world political situation. In the case of the Serpent Society, Gruenwald created them to symbolize trade unions.

==Fictional team history==
===Formation===
The Serpent Society was founded by Sidewinder, and was a descendant of sorts from the two original Serpent Squads. The first Squad consisted of the original Viper, his brother the original Eel, and the Cobra. The second Squad consisted of the second Viper (Madame Hydra), Eel, Princess Python, Cobra, and Krang. Sidewinder led the third incarnation of the Squad that included Anaconda, Black Mamba, and Death Adder. They were to retrieve the fabled Serpent Crown from its then-underwater grave. Sidewinder used his cloak and abandoned his comrades during an underwater mishap, and proceeded to collect the reward for the Crown.

Anaconda, Mamba and Adder survived and confronted Sidewinder. During that time, Sidewinder had invested the money and started the groundwork for the Serpent Society. The Society was to provide its members with better access to technology, bigger access to jobs, higher pay, comradeship, safe lodging, and a host of other benefits. Most importantly, with Sidewinder&#x27;s teleportation cloak, members never had to fear imprisonment again. It was, essentially, a supervillain labor union.

After persuading his former comrades of his true intention to better their lot (and paying their share of the reward plus interest), he had them contact other snake-themed criminals which included Asp, Diamondback, Constrictor, Cobra, Princess Python, Viper, Rattler, Cottonmouth, and Bushmaster. The Viper refused to attend the first initial gathering. Constrictor, unimpressed with the proceedings, walked out and tried to turn the group over to the Avengers.

Sidewinder, Anaconda, Black Mamba, Death Adder, Asp, Diamondback, Cottonmouth, the Cobra, Bushmaster, Rattler, and Princess Python became charter members of the Serpent Society. They headquartered at Serpent Citadel, which was an abandoned mental hospital located in upstate New York. Sidewinder sent them out to contact various criminal organizations including HYDRA, the Maggia, Kingpin, and A.I.M. From A.I.M., they received their first paying assignment: the elimination of their former leader MODOK. The Society&#x27;s success in killing MODOK cemented their reputation as criminal talents of the first caliber. Captain America intervened many times during their early years, but was never able to put them out of commission.

Two charter members soon left the Society. Princess Python fled during the MODOK assignment and was soon after expelled from their ranks. Death Adder was killed by the Scourge of the Underworld when he was sent to ransom the Princess to her Circus of Crime cohorts.

Later, the Viper sent a fourth Serpent Squad (though not named as such) consisting of Copperhead, Black Racer, Fer-de-Lance, and Puff Adder to infiltrate the Society with the intention of assassinating Sidewinder and setting herself up as the rightful leader. When the four were taken to Serpent Citadel by Sidewinder, it was easy for the rest of the Viper&#x27;s allies (Coachwhip, Boomslang, Slither, and Rock Python), to assault the place. Many of the charter members went turncoat and supported the Viper, whereas the Asp, Black Mamba, Bushmaster, and Diamondback remained loyal to Sidewinder.

The Viper used the Society and its resources to poison the water supply of Washington DC, which turned its citizens into snake-men. The ensuing chaos nearly destroyed the capital. Diamondback managed to escape with Sidewinder and solicited help from Captain America, Demolition Man, Nomad, Falcon, and Vagabond. The team stormed Serpent Citadel, rescued the Society members who were loyal to Sidewinder, and captured many others. The Viper, however managed to escape.

In the end, Cobra subdued the Viper and turned her over to the Captain on the condition that he allowed the Serpent Society 24 hours to evacuate from their headquarters. When the Captain refused the deal the Cobra turned Viper over anyway.

Bitter over the betrayal, Sidewinder left the Society and the Cobra became its new leader, eventually calling himself King Cobra. With the exception of Slither and the Viper herself, all of the Viper&#x27;s agents remained with the Society. The Society re-located to a new secret headquarters in the Bronx.

===The trial===
Shortly afterwards, Diamondback became romantically involved with Captain America and tried to leave the Society altogether to be with him. Despite the fact that she was a member of a criminal organization that he desperately wanted to put out of commission, Captain America did not force her to betray her companions. The Society, however, had Diamondback under surveillance, and when they realized she had been seeing Captain America socially, certain members demanded that she should be put on trial for treason.

Diamondback was found guilty. Every member voted for her death except for Asp, Black Mamba, Bushmaster and Rock Python. Penalty was death by injection, but King Cobra said he would commute the sentence if she would cooperate with them by revealing the true identity of Captain America. Diamondback refused but Black Mamba secretly alerted Sidewinder, who teleported in to save Diamondback at the last moment.

Diamondback, seeking revenge against the Society, sought out Paladin when Captain America could not guarantee that Black Mamba and Asp be given immunity from arrest. The two infiltrated the Society&#x27;s headquarters, only to be captured along with Mamba and Asp. Captain America, on the other hand, from his sky cycle, spotted a Serpent Saucer piloted by Cottonmouth and Fer-de-Lance, which was heading back to the Society&#x27;s hideout. Cap entered the hideout along with the saucer and quickly subdued the two Serpents. He quickly freed Diamondback, Paladin, Mamba and Asp and together they brought down the Society. All members were taken to prison with the exception of Diamondback, Asp, and Mamba (Asp and Mamba eventually were given immunity from arrest due to their help in defeating their former colleagues). Anaconda, Puff Adder and Rock Python escaped capture, as they were not at the headquarters at the time. Boomslang was in the hospital after being shot by thugs around this period. Puff Adder and Rock Python were eventually imprisoned after being thrown out of their Serpent Saucer by MODAM. Anaconda, Black Mamba, Asp, and Diamondback were all invited by MODAM to join the Femizons. Afterwards, Mamba, Asp, and Diamondback formed a new team called BAD Girls, Inc. with fellow Femizon Impala.

After spending time in prison, the Society re-formed again, going back to their old ways. Another encounter with Captain America and the now defunct team called Force Works seemed to have permanently put them out of commission; both Puff Adder and Black Mamba later said that the Society had disbanded.

===Disassembled===
However, the Society re-formed yet again in the &quot;Captain America/Avengers Disassembled&quot; tie-ins. King Cobra, Rattler, Bushmaster, and a new Death Adder had aided the Thunderbolts during the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline. After that, the four villains have been identified as members of the 142 registered superheroes who appear on the cover of the comic book &quot;&quot; #1. Anaconda served with the Six Pack and was later defeated by the New Warriors; Diamondback, Black Mamba, and Asp had reformed BAD Girls, Inc.; Cottonmouth had not been seen since he broke free from prison with Hawkeye, but was later taken back into custody by S.H.I.E.L.D.

===Other Activities===
During the 2008 &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; storyline, in which a race of alien shapeshifters known as the Skrulls were discovered to have engaged in a subversive, long-term invasion of Earth, the Serpent Society took a number of civilians hostage in a compound in the American Midwest, claiming they were protecting themselves from the Skrulls. Nova and his Nova Corps deputies defeated them in seconds.

The Serpent Society appeared in the 2012 &quot;Avengers vs. X-Men&quot; storyline, during which they were confronted by the X-Men. They were next seen battling Taskmaster and Deadpool after they were contracted by Leviathan to capture Marcus Johnson.

Subsequently, Sidewinder returned to lead the Serpent Society, which during one endeavor, attacked the superhero group being protected by Elektra. Having studied the Serpent Society and its members while working for S.H.I.E.L.D., Elektra was able to defeat the Society.

As part of Marvel Comics&#x27; 2015 All-New, All-Different Marvel initiative, Jordan Stryke, also known as the Viper, returned from the dead and became leader of the Serpent Society. He rebranded the group as a criminal business called Serpent Solutions, which later came into conflict with Sam Wilson, who had assumed the identity of Captain America, and his allies, which included the now-retired Diamondback. After their plans were foiled, the Serpent Society were arrested by the authorities.

Most of the members of Serpent Solutions escaped from prison and reunited during the 2017 &quot;Secret Empire&quot; storyline, including Slither, who rejoined the group.

The Serpent Society was next seen working with the brand new Constrictor, the original&#x27;s son. He had stolen the Book of the Iron Fist and planned to sell it to Iron Fist&#x27;s enemy Choshin. This led to a battle between the serpents, Choshin&#x27;s samurais, and Iron Fist and Sabretooth. Iron Fist and Coachwhip were the last two fighters standing, and Coachwhip revealed that the Society did not know it was not the real Constrictor and that he had not told them where he hid the book.

During the Thing&#x27;s bachelor party, Johnny Storm unwittingly hired the Serpent Society as strippers. Anaconda, Asp, Black Mamba, Black Racer, Fer-de-Lance, and Princess Python jumped out of the Thing&#x27;s cake and battled the Thing and his superhuman guests, including Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Luke Cage, Spider-Man, Rocket Raccoon, and Thundra, among others. The ladies of the Serpent Society were eventually defeated and taken into custody.

In a prelude to the &quot;Hunted&quot; storyline, most, if not all, members of the Serpent Society were captured by Kraven the Hunter, Taskmaster, and Black Ant and forced to participate in a murderous hunt set up by Arcade. While Piet Voorhees&#x27; Cobra alias (where he was called King Cobra by Arcade) was selected to be a member of the Savage Six, the rest of the Society members were placed in electric cages to wait for the hunt to commence. After the hunt began, the Society attempted to battle the robotic drones being controlled by the wealthy participants, though they realized they were outmatched and fled with the rest of the supervillains. As they fled, Cottonmouth and Black Mamba commented that they did not believe Viper was suited to be the Serpent Society&#x27;s leader. They are saved by Vulture, who took over as leader of the band of villains. The Society then joined in the fight against the hunters. After Kraven had Arcade lower the force field, they are seen with Armadillo charging towards the awaiting police officers only to be subdued by the Avengers and the Fantastic Four.

The male members of the Serpent Society attended the Criminal Technology Show Expo, where MODOK had disguised himself as Arnim Zola. MODOK followed the men into the restroom where he beat them to near death as revenge for his murder many years prior. Iron Man, who had been working with MODOK and disguised as a HYDRA agent, suggested they hide the supervillains before they regained consciousness. However, King Cobra learned of this and alerted the rest of the supervillains in attendance to MODOK&#x27;s and Iron Man&#x27;s scheme, causing a fight to break out.

During the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Reign&quot; storyline, Coachwhip and Puff Adder appear as members of Wilson Fisk&#x27;s incarnation of the Thunderbolts at the time when Fisk had outlawed superhero activity. They alongside the Thunderbolts unit with them attack Spider-Woman only to be fought off by Spider-Woman as she gets Lindsay McRabe to safety. Boomslang was seen as an inmate of the Myrmidon and was defeated by Moon Knight in one of the prison bouts.

The Serpent Society members Anaconda, Asp, Black Mamba, Bushmaster, Coachwhip, Cobra II, Copperhead, Cottonmouth, Death Adder III, Fer-de-Lance, Princess Python, Puff Adder, Rattler, Rock Python, Slither, Viper started killing and throwing bodies into an offering pile at their old Serpent Solutions lair in the &quot;name of the serpent&quot;. Their worshiping is crashed by Nighthawk. The Avengers also arrive and find that Nighthawk defeated them. The portal that the Serpent Society opened with their worshiping summoned Mephisto. The Serpent Society later escaped from police custody and started killing people while making their way across the Brooklyn Bridge causing the Avengers to take action.

===Making the Serpent&#x27;s Tears===
Viper changes his name to Pit Viper and reorganizes the Serpent Society into a cult dedicated to worshiping Mephisto. Pit Viper orchestrates several crises around the world to keep the Avengers Emergency Response Squad distracted while dispatching his new recruit Tiger Snake to lead raids for components needed for the Serpent&#x27;s Tears, which Pit Viper boasts will not only be powerful and profitable weapons but will honor Mephisto. When Pit Viper sets off the Serpent&#x27;s Tears, Captain America throws himself into it to protect Shang-Chi and is turned into a humanoid snake. After the Avengers defeat the Serpent Society, Wonder Man uses his energy to cure Captain America.

<doc id="1217056" wikidata="Q123244" url="?curid=1217056" title="Organicism">
<text>Organicism is the philosophical position that states that the universe and its various parts (including human societies) ought to be considered alive and naturally ordered, much like a living organism. Vital to the position is the idea that organicistic elements are not dormant &quot;things&quot; &quot;per se&quot; but rather dynamic components in a comprehensive system that is, as a whole, everchanging. Organicism is related to but remains distinct from holism insofar as it prefigures holism; while the latter concept is applied more broadly to universal part-whole interconnections such as in anthropology and sociology, the former is traditionally applied only in philosophy and biology. Furthermore, organicism is incongruous with reductionism because of organicism&#x27;s consideration of &quot;both bottom-up and top-down causation.&quot; Regarded as a fundamental tenet in natural philosophy, organicism has remained a vital current in modern thought, alongside both reductionism and mechanism, that has guided scientific inquiry since the early 17th century. 

Though there remains dissent among scientific historians concerning organicism&#x27;s pregeneration, most scholars agree on Ancient Athens as its birthplace. Surfacing in Athenian writing in the 4th-century BC, Plato was among the first philosophers to consider the universe an intelligent living (almost sentient) being, which he posits in his &quot;Philebus&quot; and &quot;Timaeus&quot;. At the turn of the 18th-century, Immanuel Kant championed a revival of organicisitic thought by stressing, in his written works, &quot;the inter-relatedness of the organism and its parts[,] and the circular causality&quot; inherent to the inextricable entanglement of the greater whole. 

Organicism flourished for a period during the German romanticism intellectual movement and was a position considered by Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling to be an important principle in the burgeoning field of biological studies. Within contemporary biology, organicism stresses the organization (particularly the self-organizing properties) rather than the composition (the reduction into biological components) of organisms. John Scott Haldane was the first modern biologist to use the term to expand his philosophical stance in 1917; other 20th-century academics and professionals, such as Theodor Adorno and , have followed in Haldane&#x27;s wake.

Properly scientific interest in organicist biology has recently been revived with the extended evolutionary synthesis.

==In philosophy==

Organicism as a doctrine rejects mechanism and reductionism (doctrines that claim that the smallest parts by themselves explain the behavior of larger organized systems of which they are a part). However, organicism also rejects vitalism, the doctrine that there is a vital force different from physical forces that accounts for living things. As Fritjof Capra puts it, both schools, organicism and vitalism, were born from the quest for getting rid of the Cartesian picture of reality, a view that has been claimed to be the most destructive paradigm nowadays, from science to politics.
A number of biologists in the early to mid-twentieth century embraced organicism. They wished to reject earlier vitalisms but also to stress that whole organism biology was not fully explainable by atomic mechanism. The larger organization of an organic system has features that must be taken into account to explain its behavior.

The French zoologist Yves Delage, in his seminal text &quot;L&#x27;Hérédité Et Les Grands Problèmes de la Biologie Générale,&quot; described organicism thus: [L]ife, the form of the body, the properties and characters of its diverse parts, as resulting from the reciprocal play or struggle of all its elements, cells, fibres, tissues, organs, which act the one on the other, modify one the other, allot among them each its place and part, and lead all together to the final result, giving thus the appearance of a consensus, or a pre-established harmony, where in reality there is nothing but the result of independent phenomena.

Scott F. Gilbert and Sahotra Sarkar distinguish organicism from holism to avoid what they see as the vitalistic or spiritualistic connotations of holism. Val Dusek notes that holism contains a continuum of degrees of the top-down control of organization, ranging from monism (the doctrine that the only complete object is the whole universe, or that there is only one entity, the universe) to organicism, which allows relatively more independence of the parts from the whole, despite the whole being more than the sum of the parts, and/or the whole exerting some control on the behavior of the parts.

Still more independence is present in relational holism. This doctrine does not assert top-down control of the whole over its parts, but does claim that the relations of the parts are essential to explanation of behavior of the system. Aristotle and early modern philosophers and scientists tended to describe reality as made of substances and their qualities, and to neglect relations. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz showed the bizarre conclusions to which a doctrine of the non-existence of relations led. Twentieth century philosophy has been characterized by the introduction of and emphasis on the importance of relations, whether in symbolic logic, in phenomenology, or in metaphysics.

William Wimsatt has suggested that the number of terms in the relations considered distinguishes reductionism from holism. Reductionistic explanations claim that two or at most three term relations are sufficient to account for the system&#x27;s behavior. At the other extreme the system could be considered as a single ten to the twenty-sixth term relation, for instance.

== In Theology ==
Organicism as a structuring or worldview motif finds implementation in the dogmatic theology of the nineteenth century. It was implemented prominently by Dutch Reformed theologian Herman Bavinck, and has been variously debated and appraised. Nonetheless, Bavinck&#x27;s consideration of reality as both being and becoming, with an organic unity-and-diversity rooted in the united essence of the Trinity, stands as a prominent example of a theological implementation of organicism.

Likewise, organicist language can be found in relation to faith and the church by Norwegian Lutheran theologian Gisle Johnson. Johnson will construe the relationship between faith, church, and historical development as &quot;an organic development,&quot; likening it to a sprout.

==In politics and sociology==

Organicism has also been used to characterize notions put forth by various late 19th-century social scientists who considered human society to be analogous to an organism, and individual humans to be analogous to the cells of an organism. This sort of organicist sociology was articulated by Alfred Espinas, Paul von Lilienfeld, Jacques Novicow, Albert Schäffle, Herbert Spencer, and René Worms, among others. Prominent conservative political thinkers who have developed an organic view of society are Edmund Burke, G.W.F. Hegel, Adam Müller, and Julius Evola. Organicism has also been identified with the &quot;Tory Radicalism&quot; of Thomas Carlyle, John Ruskin, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Benjamin Disraeli.

Thomas Hobbes arguably put forward a form of organicism. In the &quot;Leviathan&quot;, he argued that the state is like a secular God whose constituents (individual people) make up a larger organism. However, the body of the Leviathan is composed of many human faces (all looking outwards from the body), and these faces do not symbolize different organs of a complex organism but the individual people who themselves have consented to the social contract, and thereby ceded their power to the Leviathan. That the Leviathan is more like a constructed machine than like a literal organism is perfectly in line with Hobbes&#x27; elementaristic individualism and mechanical materialism.

According to scholars Jean-Yves Camus and Nicolas Lebourg, organicism stands at the core of the historical far-right&#x27;s worldview. Adolf Hitler himself along with other members of the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (German: &quot;Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei&quot;, NSDAP) in the Weimar Republic (1918–1933) were greatly influenced by several 19th- and early 20th-century thinkers and proponents of philosophical, onto-epistemic, and theoretical perspectives on ecological anthropology, scientific racism, holistic science, and organicism regarding the constitution of complex systems and theorization of organic-racial societies. In particular, one of the most significant ideological influences on the Nazis was the 19th-century German nationalist philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte, whose works had served as an inspiration to Hitler and other Nazi Party members, and whose ideas were implemented among the philosophical and ideological foundations of Nazi-oriented Völkisch nationalism.

==In biology==
In breathing organisms, the cells were first observed in 17th-century Europe following the invention of the microscope. Before that period, individual organisms were studied as a whole in a field known as &quot;organismic biology&quot;; that area of research remains an important component of the biological sciences.

In biology, organicism considers that the observable structures of life, its overall form and the properties and characteristics of its component parts, are a result of the reciprocal play of all the components on each other. Examples of 20th-century biologists who were organicists are Ross Harrison, Paul Weiss, and Joseph Needham. Donna Haraway discusses them in her first book &quot;Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields&quot;. John Scott Haldane (father of J. B. S. Haldane), William Emerson Ritter, Edward Stuart Russell, Joseph Henry Woodger, Ludwig von Bertalanffy, and Ralph Stayner Lillie are other early 20th-century organicists. Robert Rosen, founder of &quot;relational biology&quot;, provided a comprehensive mathematical and category-theoretic treatment of irreducible causal relations he believed to be responsible for life.

The early biologists of the organicist movement have influenced the organism-centered perspective of the extended evolutionary synthesis.

===Theoretical Biology Club===
In the early 1930s Joseph Henry Woodger and Joseph Needham, together with Conrad Hal Waddington, John Desmond Bernal, Dorothy Needham, and Dorothy Wrinch, formed the Theoretical Biology Club, to promote the organicist approach to biology. The club was in opposition to mechanistic philosophy, reductionism, and the gene-centric view of evolution. Most of the members were influenced by the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead. The club disbanded as the Rockefeller Foundation refused to fund their investigations.

=== Ecology ===
In ecology, &quot;organicism&quot; and &quot;organicistic&quot; (or &quot;organismic&quot;) are used to designate theories which conceptualize populations, particularly ecological communities or ecosystems, according to the model of the individual organism. As such, the term &quot;organicism&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;holism&quot;, although there are versions of holism that are not organicistic/organismic but individualistic.

Early iterations of Gaia theory took an explicitly organicist approach by conceptualizing the entire Earth as an integrated, self-regulating organic whole akin to a living being, rather than just a mechanical collection of separate components.

<doc id="1217057" wikidata="Q1129913" url="?curid=1217057" title="Coosa River">
<text>The Coosa River is a tributary of the Alabama River in the U.S. states of Alabama and Georgia. The river is about long.

The Coosa River begins at the confluence of the Oostanaula and Etowah rivers in Rome, Georgia, and ends just northeast of the Alabama state capital, Montgomery, where it joins the Tallapoosa River to form the Alabama River just south of Wetumpka. Around 90% of the Coosa River&#x27;s length is located in Alabama. Coosa County, Alabama and Etowah County, Alabama are located on the Coosa River.

The Coosa is one of Alabama&#x27;s most developed rivers. Most of the river has been impounded, with Alabama Power, a unit of the Southern Company, owning seven dams and powerhouses on the Coosa River. The dams produce hydroelectric power, but they are costly to some species endemic to the Coosa River.

== History ==
Native Americans had been living on the Coosa Valley for millennia before Hernando de Soto and his men became the first Europeans to visit it in 1540. The Coosa chiefdom was one of the most powerful chiefdoms in the southeast at the time.

Over a century after the Spanish left the Coosa Valley, the British established strong trading ties with the Muscogee Creek bands of the area around the late 17th century, much to the dismay of France, which had some early settlements on the coast, specifically Mobile. The French had traveled from there upriver and believed that the Coosa River was a key gateway to the entire South; they wanted to control the valley. The main transportation of the day was by boat. The confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers formed the Alabama River, which has its mouth at Mobile Bay, the port used by the French for travel around the Caribbean and to France. They wanted to retain control of both the Coosa and the Alabama rivers.

In the early 18th century, almost all European and Indian trade in the southeast ceased during the tribal uprisings brought on by the Yamasee War against the Carolinas. After a few years, the Indian trade system was resumed under somewhat reformed policies. The conflict between the French and English over the Coosa Valley, and much of the southeast in general, continued. It was not until after Britain had defeated France in the Seven Years&#x27; War (also known as the French and Indian War) that France relinquished its holdings east of the Mississippi River to Britain. This was part of the Treaty of Paris, signed by both nations in 1763 to mark the end of the war.

By the end of the American Revolutionary War, the Coosa Valley was occupied in its lower portion by the Creek and in the upper portion by the Cherokee peoples, who had a settlement near its origin in northwest Georgia. They were beginning to feel pressure from European-American encroachment throughout their territories.

After the Fort Mims massacre near Mobile, General Andrew Jackson led American troops, along with Cherokee allies, against the Lower Creek in the Creek War. This culminated in the Creek defeat at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. Afterward, the Treaty of Fort Jackson in 1814 forced the Creek to cede a large amount of land to the United States, but left them a reserve between the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers in northern Alabama. Even there the Creeks were encroached on by European-American settlers who began as squatters from the United States.

Finally, during the 1820s and 1830s the Creek, Cherokee, and virtually all the southeastern Indians were removed to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). The Cherokee removal is remembered as the Trail of Tears. The Cherokee capital city of New Echota was located on the headwater tributaries of the Coosa River, in Georgia, until the tribe&#x27;s removal. The Creek and Choctaw removals were similar to the Cherokee Trail of Tears. After the removals, the Coosa River valley and the southeast in general was wide open for American settlers.

The invention of the cotton gin at the turn of the 19th century had made short-staple cotton profitable to process. It could be easily grown in the upland areas of the South, and demand was high for this cotton in the US and Europe. Large-scale migrations known as &quot;Alabama Fever&quot; filled Alabama with new settlers developing large cotton plantations worked by enslaved African Americans.

The first river town to form in the Coosa Basin was at the foot of the last waterfall on the Coosa River, the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Staircase.&quot; Settlers soon adopted the native name &quot;Wetumpka&quot; (meaning &quot;rumbling waters&quot; or &quot;falling stream&quot;) for this new community.

The Coosa River was an important transportation route into the early 20th century as a commercial waterway for riverboats along the upper section of the river for 200 miles south of Rome. However, shoals and waterfalls, such the Devil&#x27;s Staircase along the river&#x27;s lowest 65 miles, blocked the upper Coosa&#x27;s riverboats from access to the Alabama River and the Gulf of Mexico.

Through its building of dams on the Coosa in the early 20th century — Lay, Mitchell and Jordan — Alabama Power began to pioneer new methods of controlling and eliminating malaria, which was a major health issue in rural Alabama in the early 1900s and in other river valley areas. So successful were their pioneering efforts, that the Medical Division of the League of Nations visited Alabama to study the new methods during the construction of Mitchell Dam.

For a time, the &quot;Popeye the Sailorman&quot; cartoons were inspired by Tom Sims, a Coosa River resident of Rome, Georgia. He was familiar with riverboat life and characters of the early 1900s.

== Impoundments and sections ==
The following table describes the seven impoundments on the Coosa River from the south to north built by the Alabama Power Company as well as the tailwater section below Jordan Dam. Harvey H. Jackson III in a book &quot;Putting Loafing Streams To Work&quot; characterized the importance of the first Coosa River dams as follows:

==Flora and fauna biodiversity highlights==
In the Middle Coosa River Watershed, 281 occurrences of rare plant and animal species and natural communities have been documented, including 73 occurrences of 23 species that are federal or state protected. Ten conservation targets were chosen: the riverine system, matrix forest communities (oak hickory-pine forest), gray bat (&quot;Myotis grisescens&quot;), riparian vegetation, mountain longleaf pine (&quot;Pinus palustris&quot;) forest communities, red-cockaded woodpecker (&quot;Picoides borealis&quot;), critically imperiled aquatic species (fish, mussels, and snails), southern hognose snake (&quot;Heterodon simus&quot;), caddisflies, and imperiled plants. Maintaining the biodiversity of the Coosa River system is particularly important because it has already lost a significant portion of its aquatic fauna to extinction.

== Tributaries ==

The Coosa River&#x27;s drainage has hundreds of tributaries, which have been divided into sections based on the different areas of the watershed. The first four sections are tributary systems that converge to form the main artery of the Coosa River in Georgia. These main tributary rivers are the Conasauga and Coosawattee Rivers, which together then form the Oostanaula River. The Oostanaula then joins with the Etowah River in Rome, Georgia, forming the Coosa River.

Other significant tributaries of the Coosa are:
*Amicalola Creek
*Armuchee Creek
*Big Wills Creek
*Cartecay River
*Cedar Creek
*Chattooga River
*Chocolocco Creek
*Coahulla River
*Ellijay River
*Hatchett Creek
*Heath Creek
*Little River
*Mill Creek
*Mountain Creek
*Raccoon Creek
*Rock Creek
*Spring Creek
*Sugar Creek
*Terrapin Creek
*Waxahatchee Creek
*Weogufka Creek (through Hatchett Creek)

==Major cities==
A number of significant cities lie on the banks of the Coosa River. They include:
* Gadsden, Alabama - between Weiss and H. Neely Henry lakes
* Rainbow City, Alabama - on the Coosa due south of Gadsden
* Childersburg, Alabama - near Lay Lake
* Rome, Georgia - headwaters
* Southside, Alabama - on the Coosa due south of Rainbow City
* Wetumpka, Alabama - near confluence with Tallapoosa River forming the Alabama River
* Pell City, Alabama - on Coosa River at Logan Martin Lake

== Advocates ==
The Coosa-Alabama River Improvement Association, founded in 1890 in Gadsden, Alabama to promote navigation on the Coosa River is a leading advocate of the economic, recreational and environmental benefits of the Coosa River system.

The Alabama Rivers Alliance works to unite the citizens of Alabama to protect peoples right to clean, healthy, waters.

Alabama Water Watch is dedicated to volunteer citizen monitoring of water quality in Alabama Rivers.

The Alabama Power Foundation is a non-profit foundation providing grants for watershed, environmental and community projects along the Coosa River and within the state of Alabama.

The Coosa River Basin Initiative is a grassroots environmental organization with the mission of informing and empowering citizens so that they may become involved in the process of creating a clean, healthy and economically viable Coosa River Basin.

Coosa Riverkeeper is a citizen-based river conservation group that patrols the river, educates the public and advocates on behalf of the river. The staffed organization is based on Yellowleaf Creek and works in the Middle and Lower Coosa Basins.

<doc id="1217062" wikidata="Q7259194" url="?curid=1217062" title="Pulaski Academy">
<text>Pulaski Academy (PA) is a private, independent college preparatory preschool, elementary, and junior/senior high school headed by Brock Dunn in the Pleasant Valley neighborhood of Little Rock, Arkansas, United States. PA was established in 1971 as a segregation academy and remains as the only independent, non-sectarian, college preparatory school in Arkansas.

== History ==
When busing was introduced in the early 1970s to counteract the effects of racially defined residential patterns, whites built private schools in the suburbs or fled the county altogether. In 1971, the segregationist businessman William F. Rector announced the construction of the private Pulaski Academy in the western suburbs of the city for those, he said, who &quot;don&#x27;t like busing.&quot; Pulaski was the first school established after the &quot;Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education&quot; decision (1971). Rector said, &quot;I even hope we&#x27;ll be allowed to play &quot;Dixie&quot; if we want to without having a riot about it.&quot;

In 2003, one of 102 graduating seniors was black.

In the 2015–2016 school year, 955 of 1,221 students in grades 1-12 were white (78%). In 2016, Little Rock was 48% white.

In 2006, Pulaski Academy purchased the campus of Fellowship Bible Church, on the corner of Hinson and Napa Valley, increasing the campus to .

== Academics==
PA is accredited by ISACS (Independent Schools Association of the Central States), and ANSAA (Arkansas Non-public School Accrediting Association). PA is a member of the Cum Laude Society, Council for the Advancement and Support of Education (CASE), Arkansas Activities Association (AAA), College Board and NAIS (National Association of Independent Schools).

Pulaski Academy was named 2003 &quot;Best of the Best&quot; Private High School by the readers of an Arkansas Democrat-Gazette contest.

During the 2008–09 academic year, fifteen members of the Class of 2009 were named as National Merit Scholars, three as Commended Scholars and twelve as Finalists. Enrollment for the 2009–10 academic year was approximately 1,210 K-12 students, with a student–teacher ratio of 8.9:1.

== Extracurricular activities ==

The school&#x27;s mascot is the Bruin and school colors are Navy blue and Vegas gold. For 2024-2026 the Pulaski Academy Bruins play in the 7A Central Conference administered by the Arkansas Activities Association. The school participates in baseball, basketball (boys/girls), cheer, cross country, Pom, football, soccer (boys/girls), softball, swimming and diving (boys/girls), tennis (boys/girls), golf (boys/girls) volleyball(girls), lacrosse (boys/girls), and wrestling.

The school&#x27;s football team has won nine state championships since 2003. The team was coached by Kevin Kelley until 2021, who gained notoriety for his strategies, which include the total rejection of punting and returning punts, as well as a reliance on the onside kick. The team is now coached by Anthony Lucas.

<text>The Mount Hope Bay raids were a series of military raids conducted by British troops during the American Revolutionary War against communities on the shores of Mount Hope Bay on May 25 and 31, 1778. The towns of Bristol and Warren, Rhode Island were significantly damaged, and Freetown, Massachusetts (present-day Fall River) was also attacked, although its militia resisted British attacks more successfully. The British destroyed military defenses in the area, including supplies that had been cached by the Continental Army in anticipation of an assault on British-occupied Newport, Rhode Island. Homes as well as municipal and religious buildings were also destroyed in the raids.

On May 25, 500 British and Hessian soldiers, under orders from General Sir Robert Pigot, the commander of the British garrison at Newport, Rhode Island, landed between Bristol and Warren, destroyed boats and other supplies, and plundered Bristol. Local resistance was minimal and ineffective in stopping the British activities. Six days later, 100 soldiers descended on Freetown, where less damage was done because local defenders prevented the British from crossing a bridge.

==Background==

In December 1776, after completing the conquest of New York City, British Lieutenant General William Howe detached a body of troops from his army which occupied Newport, Rhode Island without significant opposition. The Newport garrison came under the command of Brigadier General Sir Robert Pigot when the original commander, Brigadier General Richard Prescott, was captured in the summer of 1777 in a daring commando operation led by Continental Army Major and Warren, Rhode Island, native William Barton.

Since the British occupation began American and British forces had been in a standoff. Major General Joseph Spencer had been ordered by Major General George Washington to launch an assault on Newport in 1777, but he had not done so, and was removed from command of the Rhode Island defenses. In March 1778 Congress approved the appointment of Major General John Sullivan to Rhode Island. By early May, Sullivan had arrived in the state and produced a detailed report on the situation there. He also began logistical preparations for an attack on Newport, caching equipment and supplies on the eastern shore of Narragansett Bay and the Taunton River. General Pigot was alerted to Sullivan&#x27;s preparations by a local Loyalist, and organized an expedition to raid Bristol and Warren. On the evening of May 24 he ordered a force of 500 British and Hessian soldiers under the command of the 22nd Regiment&#x27;s Lieutenant Colonel John Campbell to march to the northern end of Aquidneck Island, from where they took whaleboats across to the mainland.

==Warren and Bristol raid==
Arriving early on May 25, Campbell&#x27;s forces landed on Bristol Neck, between Bristol and Warren. Campbell divided his force in two, sending one detachment into Warren, and the other to areas along the Kickemuit River where boats and other supplies were cached. The latter force destroyed 58 of 70 small boats that General Spencer had originally stored there, along with other military supplies and a corn mill. They burned down a bridge that crossed the river, and set fire to a sloop. After the British left, locals put out the fire on the sloop, which only suffered minor damage.
The Warren detachment had expected some resistance upon reaching the town, but Continental Army forces, numbering about 300 under the command of Colonel Archibald Clary, had fled the town upon rumors that the British force was much larger than it actually was. The British destroyed military supplies, and set fire to the local powder magazine. The ensuing explosion destroyed six homes and the town&#x27;s meeting house. The troops also burned a sloop and destroyed five cannon. As they marched from the town, the first signs of organized resistance began to appear. The two British detachments rejoined and headed for Bristol.

Word of the British landing had reached Providence, and Colonel Barton immediately sprang into action. Recruiting about 200 volunteers, he rushed south, turned Clary&#x27;s retreating force around, and caught up with the British shortly after they left Warren, heading for Bristol. The two forces skirmished as the British marched southward, with both sides incurring minor casualties. The notable exception was Colonel Barton, who took a musket ball that did him sufficient damage that it effectively ended his military career, although he continued to fight on that day. Campbell&#x27;s men reached Bristol in good order despite the ongoing skirmishes, and engaged in a destructive rampage. In addition to military supplies and cannon, they destroyed 22 homes and a church, and looted everywhere, making, according to one account, &quot;no distinction between their Friends and Foes&quot;.

Their work completed around noon, the British returned to their boats. They embarked, covered by the guns of the frigate HMS &quot;Flora&quot; and HM galley &quot;Pigot&quot;, and returned to Aquidneck Island and Newport. The raid prompted General Sullivan to renew calls to area governors for increased militia assistance. This recruiting did not have material effect before the next raid occurred.

The May 25 raids also included the capture of an anchored American galley, the &quot;Spitfire&quot;, near the entrance to the Taunton River.

==Freetown raid==
Pigot next organized a smaller raiding force to go to lower Freetown (a portion that was later separated to form Fall River). On the night of May 30, a force of 100 men led by Major Edmund Eyre (who had served under Campbell in the previous raid) embarked from Arnold&#x27;s Point on Aquidneck Island in flat-bottomed boats under the escort of several naval vessels, including the aforementioned HMS &quot;Flora&quot; and &quot;Pigot&quot;. The &quot;Pigot&quot; ran aground while passing through Bristol Ferry, but the rest sailed up the Taunton River, and landed near the mouth of the Quequechan River in lower Freetown on the morning of Sunday, May 31.

The local militia was under the command of Colonel Joseph Durfee (going by the title of Captain at the time), a Continental Army veteran, and had established a watch. The British landing was spotted by a sentinel and the alarm was raised. Forty men, including militia from Freetown and nearby Tiverton, mustered to give resistance. Eyre&#x27;s men fired grapeshot from a small cannon and slowly pushed the militiamen uphill. As this took place, some of his men proceeded to burn a house, grist mill and sawmill, nine boats, and 15,000 feet of planking. The militia eventually reached a bridge across a stream, where about 25 men established a defensive line behind a stone wall on the far side. In a battle lasting about 90 minutes, Durfee&#x27;s men repulsed repeated attempts by Eyre&#x27;s men to gain control of the bridge. The British soldiers then took one local resident prisoner, set fire to his property, and retreated to their boats. The militia followed, harassing the soldiers with musket fire.

On their return to port, the British naval vessels worked to assist the &quot;Pigot&quot;, which had been grounded; in the process of doing so, they came under fire from an American battery on shore (which, by at least one account, included cannon-launched stone and spare iron) and suffered additional casualties (three killed and one wounded according to one account). The &quot;Pigot&quot; also sustained significant damage from the American battery. Some accounts describe the American prisoner (an elderly man named Richard Borden) as being aboard one of the boats coming under fire; these accounts describe the prisoner seeking shelter by laying flat on the floor of the vessel, despite attempts of his captors to have him stand (perhaps to try to dissuade the attackers); according to these accounts, one or two of the captors were eventually hit by shots from the Americans on shore. The prisoner was eventually released several days later. In addition to the casualties at Bristol Ferry, the British suffered two killed and five wounded in the battle at Freetown, while the Americans suffered no casualties beyond the one captive, who apparently emerged without any noteworthy injury.

==Aftermath==

The destruction of the boats and supplies was a minor setback to American plans. In mid-July, General Washington informed Sullivan that a French fleet was available to assist in operations against Newport. This had a galvanizing effect on recruiting, and local shipbuilders embarked on a crash boatbuilding program to replace the boats destroyed in the raid. By early August, the French fleet of the Comte d&#x27;Estaing had arrived off Newport, and Sullivan commanded a force of 10,000 militia and regular army troops. Bad weather and the timely arrival of a British fleet to oppose d&#x27;Estaing frustrated allied plans. Sullivan, who had occupied the northern part of Aquidneck Island, was forced to retreat by the mass desertion of militia after the French withdrew their fleet and troops. General Pigot then broke out of his lines in pursuit, but Sullivan successfully fought off his attack in the Battle of Rhode Island on August 29 before retreating off Aquidneck Island.

The British occupied Newport until October 1779, when the garrison was withdrawn for operations elsewhere. The raided communities continued to contribute to the American war effort despite the damage and difficulties caused by the raids.

Major Edmund Eyre, leader of the Freetown raid, was by 1781 promoted to lieutenant colonel, when he again led British forces during a raid on New London and Groton, Connecticut on September 6 of the same year. He was wounded early in the Battle of Groton Heights, and his troops were accused of engaging in atrocities in the aftermath of the battle.

<doc id="1217065" wikidata="Q1544257" url="?curid=1217065" title="Great Dismal Swamp">
<text>The Great Dismal Swamp is a large swamp in the Coastal Plain Region of southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina in the eastern United States, between Norfolk, Virginia, and Elizabeth City, North Carolina. It is located in parts of the southern Virginia independent cities of Chesapeake and Suffolk and northern North Carolina counties of Gates, Pasquotank, and Camden. Some estimates place the original size of the swamp at over . the size of the Great Dismal Swamp is around .

Lake Drummond, a natural lake, is located in the heart of the swamp. Lake Drummond is a circular body of water, and is one of only two naturally occurring freshwater lakes in Virginia. Along the Great Dismal Swamp&#x27;s eastern edge runs the Dismal Swamp Canal. The canal is 22 miles long, and was completed in 1805 to provide a pathway for trade between Chesapeake Bay, Virginia and the Albemarle Sound in North Carolina. The largest water supply for the Dismal Swamp Canal is through Lake Drummond.

The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge was created in 1973 when the Union Camp Corporation of Franklin, Virginia, donated of land after centuries of logging and other human activities devastated the swamp&#x27;s ecosystems. The refuge was officially established through the Dismal Swamp Act of 1974, and consists of over 167 square miles (433 square km) of forested wetlands. Outside the boundaries of the refuge, the state of North Carolina has preserved and protected additional portions of the swamp through the establishment of the Dismal Swamp State Park. That park protects of forested wetland.

The swamp was a refuge location for the Great Dismal Swamp maroons, including enslaved people in the Southern states before the American Civil War, and Native Americans who were escaping colonial expansion. Prior to the maroons inhabiting the swamp, it was inhabited by Algonquian-speaking Native American coastal tribes.

A remnant of the original swamp was declared a National Natural Landmark in 1973, in recognition of its unique combination of geological and ecological features.

==History==

The origin of Lake Drummond is not entirely clear, as there is no apparent network of natural streams emptying into the lake.

Archaeological evidence suggests varying cultures of humans have inhabited the swamp for 13,000 years. The Powhatan empire extended to the northern edge of the Great Dismal Swamp around the time of the settling of Jamestown (circa 1600), displacing the Chesapeake tribe residing there before. In 1650, Algonquian-speaking Native Americans of coastal tribes lived in the swamp. In 1665, William Drummond, the first governor of North Carolina, was the first European recorded as discovering the swamp&#x27;s lake, which was subsequently named for him. In 1728, William Byrd II, while leading a land survey to establish a boundary between the Virginia and North Carolina colonies, made many observations of the swamp, none of them favorable; he is credited with naming it the Dismal Swamp. At this time, the swamp was estimated to cover around 2,000 square miles. Settlers did not appreciate the ecological importance of wetlands. In 1763, George Washington visited the area, and he and others founded the Dismal Swamp Company in a venture to drain the swamp and clear it for settlement. The company later turned to the more profitable goal of timber harvesting.

Based on archeological findings, Native American communities fled to the Swamp for refuge from the colonial frontier. Along with the Native American communities, there were also multiple populations of African Americans taking refuge in the Swamp in early American History, many of them fleeing slavery due to the Atlantic slave trade. These Great Dismal Swamp maroons consisted of thousands of escaped Black refugee slaves by the year 1860. They were able to find shelter, community and society in the swamp that was not readily available in the world outside the swamp. J.D. Smyth wrote of the maroons in his 1784 novel: &quot;A Tour in the United States&quot;, &quot;Run-away(s) have resided in these places for twelve, twenty, or thirty years and upwards, subsisting themselves upon corn, hogs, and fowls that they raised on some of the spots not perpetually under water, nor subject to be flooded, as forty-nine parts out of fifty are; and on such spots they have erected habitations and cleared small fields around them.&quot; Excavations reveal island communities existing until the Civil War. Charlie, a maroon who worked illegally in a lumber camp in the swamp, later recalled that there were whole families of maroons living in the Dismal Swamp, some of whom had never seen a White man. The Underground Railroad Education Pavilion, an exhibit set up to educate visitors about the fugitive slaves who lived in the swamp, was opened February 24, 2012.

The Dismal Swamp Canal was authorized by Virginia in 1787 and by North Carolina in 1790. Construction began in 1793 and was completed in 1805. The canal, as well as a railroad constructed through part of the swamp in 1830, enabled the harvest of timber. The canal deteriorated after the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal was completed in 1858. In 1929, the United States Government bought the Dismal Swamp Canal and began to improve it. The canal remains the oldest operating artificial waterway in the country. Like the Albemarle and Chesapeake canals, it is part of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway.

==Preservation==

In the mid-20th century, conservation groups across the United States began demanding the preservation of the remaining Great Dismal Swamp and restoration of its wetlands, by then understood as critical habitat for a wide variety of birds, animals, plants, and other living things. This area is along the Atlantic Flyway of migrating species. In 1973, the Union Camp Corporation, a paper company based in Franklin, Virginia, with large land holdings in the area, donated just over of land to The Nature Conservancy, which the following year transferred the property to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. During this time, a portion of the swamp was declared a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service in 1973 due to its unique combination of geological and ecological features.

The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge was officially established by the U.S. Congress through the Dismal Swamp Act of 1974. The refuge consists of almost of forested wetlands, including the Lake Drummond at its center. The refuge&#x27;s resource management programs aim to restore and maintain the natural biodiversity that once existed in the swamp, including its water resources, native vegetation communities, and wildlife species. Water control structures in the ditches help conserve and manage water, while forest management activities that simulate the ecological effects of wildfires are used to restore and maintain plant diversity. Wildlife is managed by ensuring the presence of required habitats, with hunting used to balance some wildlife populations with available food supplies.

==Contemporary swamp==

The Great Dismal Swamp lies wholly within the Middle Atlantic coastal forests ecoregion. 
The swamp harbors a wide range of plant and animal species. Bald cypress, tupelo, maple, Atlantic white cypress, pine, and other tree species found on the refuge support the fauna within. In a survey undertaken from 1973 to 1976, some 334 plants from 100 plant families were found. The swamp is home to many mammals, including black bears, bobcats, otters, and weasels, as well as over 70 reptile and amphibian species. There are 213 bird species to be seen within the swamp throughout the year, including 96 nesting species, and birders are common within the prime birding months of April through June. Once home to American alligators, the swamp receives occasional vagrants from North Carolina to the south.

Lake Drummond is the center of activity in the swamp, attracting fishermen, sightseers, and boaters. Camping is not allowed on the refuge.

<text>The Killing Fields is a 1984 British biographical drama film about the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, which is based on the experiences of two journalists, Cambodian Dith Pran and American Sydney Schanberg. It was directed by Roland Joffé and produced by David Puttnam for his company Goldcrest Films. Sam Waterston stars as Schanberg, Haing S. Ngor as Pran, and John Malkovich as Al Rockoff. The adaptation for the screen was written by Bruce Robinson; the musical score was written by Mike Oldfield and orchestrated by David Bedford.

The film was a success at the box office and an instant hit with critics. At the 57th Academy Awards it received seven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture; it won three, most notably Best Supporting Actor for Haing S. Ngor, who had no previous acting experience, as well as Best Cinematography and Best Editing. At the 38th British Academy Film Awards, it won eight BAFTAs, including Best Film and Best Actor in a Leading Role for Ngor.

In 1999, the British Film Institute voted &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; the 100th-greatest British film of the 20th century. It is now seen as one of the greatest films of all time.

==Plot==

In 1973 Phnom Penh, the Cambodian national army wages a civil war with the communist Khmer Rouge group. Dith Pran, a Cambodian journalist and interpreter for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, awaits the arrival of reporter Sydney Schanberg at the city&#x27;s airport, but leaves suddenly. Schanberg takes a cab to his hotel where he meets up with photographer Al Rockoff. Pran meets Schanberg later and tells him that an American B-52 has allegedly bombed Neak Leung. After Schanberg and Pran go to the town and confirm the allegation, they are arrested when they try to photograph the execution of two Khmer Rouge operatives. They are eventually released and Schanberg is furious when the international press corps arrives with the U.S. Army.

Two years later, in 1975, the Phnom Penh embassies are evacuated in anticipation of the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s arrival. Schanberg secures evacuation for Pran&#x27;s family, but Pran insists on staying behind to help Schanberg. The Khmer Rouge move into the capital, ostensibly in peace. During a parade through the city, Schanberg and Rockoff are met by a detachment of the Khmer Rouge, who immediately arrest them. The group is taken to a back alley where prisoners are being held and executed. Pran, unharmed because he is a Cambodian civilian, negotiates to spare his friends&#x27; lives, and the group retreats to the French embassy. The Khmer Rouge orders all Cambodian citizens in the embassy to be handed over, to which the fearful ambassador complies. Knowing that Pran will be imprisoned or killed, Rockoff and fellow photographer Jon Swain try to forge a British passport for Pran, but the deception fails when Pran&#x27;s image on the passport photo disappears, as they lack adequate photographic fixer. Pran is turned over to the Khmer Rouge and forced to live under their totalitarian regime.

Several months after returning to New York City, Schanberg launches a personal campaign to locate Pran; he writes letters to several charities and maintains close contact with Pran&#x27;s family in San Francisco. In Cambodia, Pran has become a forced labourer under the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s &quot;Year Zero&quot; policy, a return to the agrarian ways of the past. Pran is also forced to attend propagandist classes where many undergo re-education. As intellectuals are made to disappear, Pran feigns simple-mindedness. Eventually, he escapes and stumbles upon one of the Pol Pot regime&#x27;s Killing Fields before he is found unconscious on the riverside and taken in by a different cadre of Khmer Rouge. In 1976, Schanberg is awarded the fictional AIFPC journalism award (a stand-in for the real Schanberg’s Pulitzer Prize) for his coverage of the Cambodian conflict, and he tells the audience that half the recognition for the award belongs to Pran. Rockoff confronts Schanberg and harshly accuses him of not doing enough to locate Pran and for using his friend to win the award. Although Schanberg initially defends his efforts, he ultimately admits that Pran stayed because of what Schanberg wanted.

Pran is shown living in a Khmer Rouge-held village led by a man named Phat, where he does household chores and tends to Phat&#x27;s young son. Phat makes several attempts to test Pran’s understanding of French and English, but Pran continues to hide his education, claiming to have been a taxi driver before the revolution. This ruse continues until Phat catches him at night listening to an English language radio broadcast. However, rather than punishing him, Phat confides in Pran about his distrust of the Khmer Rouge leadership, and asks him to take ward of his son in the event that he is killed. During the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s border war with Vietnam, Pran discovers that Phat&#x27;s son has American money and a map leading to safety. When Phat tries to stop the younger Khmer Rouge officers from killing several of his comrades, he is ignominiously shot. In the confusion, Pran escapes with four of Phat’s comrades and they begin a long trek through the jungle with Phat&#x27;s son. The group later splits and three of them head in a different direction; Pran continues following the map with the fourth man. However, Pran&#x27;s companion activates a hidden land mine while holding the boy. As Pran pleads with the man to give him the boy, the mine goes off, killing the pair. Pran continues through the jungle alone until he eventually finds a Red Cross refugee camp near the border of Thailand. In the United States, Schanberg learns that Pran is alive and safe, and reunites with Pran at the Red Cross camp. Pran assures Schanberg of his forgiveness as the two embrace.

==Cast==
==Production==
In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; in November 2014, Joffé said:

David Puttnam asked to see me, which in those days was a bit like being invited out to Hollywood. He gave me Bruce Robinson&#x27;s script, which was enormous, but it was so full of passion and energy I couldn&#x27;t put it down. I&#x27;d heard about Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge, but didn&#x27;t know much until I read it. I wrote to David saying that whoever made the film would have to be careful because it wasn&#x27;t just a war story: it was about human connection, how friendships are born and what they do to us. I didn&#x27;t hear from him for six months, then we bumped into one another and he said he&#x27;d interviewed most of the directors in the world – including some very big names who would make the studios happy – but no one had really understood it. &quot;You&#x27;re the only man who has,&quot; he said.

In the same interview actor Julian Sands said:

Roland&#x27;s audition process was extraordinary. I was 24 and I&#x27;ve never come across anything as rigorous since. He was looking to put together a troupe of actors without much film experience, because he wanted the freshness of everything to resonate with us. He would gather lots of us in his office to improvise scenes. After about a month, he had a group he found interesting. John Malkovich, Sam Waterston and Haing S. Ngor weren&#x27;t subject to that, but their meetings with him were still pretty intense. A lot was made of the fact that Haing hadn&#x27;t acted before, but John put it differently: he said Haing had been acting his whole life – you had to be a pretty good actor to survive the Khmer Rouge.

Puttnam recalled Yoko Ono&#x27;s reaction to the use of John Lennon&#x27;s Imagine in the film: &quot;“The film ended, and she was in pieces. She climbed over the back of her chair, hugged me and cried. ‘I promise you this,’ she said: ‘This is exactly the way John would have liked the song to have been used.’ It was an amazing moment.”

==Box office==
Goldcrest Films invested £8,419,000 in the film, which earned £10,664,000 in gross receipts.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Killing Fields&quot; holds a 93% rating and an average rating of 8.30/10 at the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 40 reviews, with the consensus: &quot;Artfully composed, powerfully acted, and fueled by a powerful blend of anger and empathy, &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; is a career-defining triumph for director Roland Joffé and a masterpiece of cinema.&quot; Critic Roger Ebert wrote in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;: &quot;The film is a masterful achievement on all the technical levels—it does an especially good job of convincing us with its Asian locations—but the best moments are the human ones, the conversations, the exchanges of trust, the waiting around, the sudden fear, the quick bursts of violence, the desperation.&quot; John Simon of National Review wrote: &quot;For all its flaws &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; is an important, indeed necessary, film&quot;.

The film has been criticized by some who lived through the actual events. Al Rockoff expressed dissatisfaction at the portrayals of himself and Schanberg, while Denis Cameron sought to have his consultative credit removed upon watching the completed film.

The Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa cited this movie as one of his 100 favorite films.

===Accolades===
Besides its place as 100th on the BFI Top 100 British films list, &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; is also 30th on Channel 4&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, and 60th on the AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Cheers list.

==Home media==
&quot;The Killing Fields&quot; was released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment in Australia in March 2010. The DVD includes special features such as the theatrical trailer, audio commentary with Roland Joffé, an interview with David Puttnam and a BBC documentary titled &quot;The Making of The Killing Fields&quot;. In April 2013 Umbrella Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray in Australia.

In the UK, the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Optimum Releasing and was released in North America on DVD twice by Warner Brothers, both as a regular release and later as part of their Warner Archive Collection.

In 2023, Australia&#x27;s Imprint Films (a sublabel of the home media group ViaVision) released a 2-disc Blu-ray edition of &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; as part of the 4-film &quot;Directed By Roland Joffé&quot; box set. The Imprint Blu-ray of &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; contains extra features exclusive to the release.

==Casting of Haing S. Ngor==
Haing S. Ngor, who plays Pran, was himself a survivor of the Khmer Rouge regime and the labour camps. Prior to the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s &#x27;Year Zero&#x27; he was a doctor based in Phnom Penh. In 1975, Ngor was one of millions who were moved from the city to forced labour camps in the countryside. He spent four years there before fleeing to Thailand.

Haing S. Ngor had never acted before appearing in &quot;The Killing Fields&quot;. He was spotted by the film&#x27;s casting director, Pat Golden, at a Cambodian wedding in Los Angeles.

Of his role in the film, he told &quot;People&quot; magazine in 1985: &quot;I wanted to show the world how deep starvation is in Cambodia, how many people die under Communist regime. My heart is satisfied. I have done something perfect.&quot;

Ngor became one of only two non-professional actors to win an Academy Award for acting, the other being Harold Russell (&quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, 1946).

==Related work==
The screenplay is adapted from a Sydney Schanberg story in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; entitled &quot;The Death and Life of Dith Pran: A Story of Cambodia&quot;.

In 1986, actor Spalding Gray, who had a small role in the film as the American consul, created &quot;Swimming to Cambodia&quot;, a monologue (later filmed by Jonathan Demme) based upon his experiences making &quot;The Killing Fields&quot;.

A book of the film was written by Christopher Hudson.

<doc id="1217100" wikidata="Q57490" url="?curid=1217100" title="Theodor Morell">
<text>Theodor &quot;Theo&quot; Karl Ludwig Gilbert Morell (22 July 1886 – 26 May 1948) was a German medical doctor known for acting as Adolf Hitler&#x27;s personal physician. Morell was well known in Germany for his unconventional treatments. He assisted Hitler daily in virtually everything he did for several years and was beside Hitler until the last stages of the Battle of Berlin. Hitler granted Morell high awards, enabling the latter to become a multi-millionaire through business deals with the Nazi government, made possible by his status.

==Early years==
Morell was the second son of a primary school teacher, born and raised in the small village of Trais-Münzenberg in Upper Hesse. He studied medicine in Grenoble and Paris, then trained in obstetrics and gynecology in Munich in 1910. On 23 May 1913, he completed his doctoral degree and was fully licensed as a physician. He served as a ship&#x27;s doctor until 1914 when he volunteered for service at the Front during the First World War. Morell served as an army battalion medical officer until 1917. By 1918, he was in Berlin with his own medical practice, and in August 1919 he married Johanna &quot;Hanni&quot; Moller (1898–1983), a wealthy actress. He furnished his office with the latest medical technology through his wife&#x27;s fortune. He targeted his unconventional treatments at an upscale market, his practice becoming fashionable for treatment of skin and venereal diseases, and turned down invitations to be personal physician to both the Shah of Persia and the King of Romania.

==Career==
===Hitler&#x27;s physician===
Morell joined the Nazi Party when Hitler came to power in 1933. In 1935, Hitler&#x27;s personal photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann, was successfully treated by Morell. Hoffmann told Hitler that Morell had saved his life. Hitler met Morell in 1936, and Morell began treating Hitler with various commercial preparations, including a combination of vitamins and hydrolyzed strain of &quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria called Mutaflor (probiotic strain, isolated in 1917), which successfully treated Hitler&#x27;s severe stomach cramps. Through Morell&#x27;s prescriptions, a leg rash that Hitler had developed also disappeared. Hitler was convinced of Morell&#x27;s medical genius, and Morell became part of his social inner circle.

Some historians have attempted to explain this by citing the reputation he had gained in Germany for success in treating syphilis, along with Hitler&#x27;s own (speculated) fears of the disease, which he associated closely with Jews. Others have commented on the possibility that Hitler had visible symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, especially towards the end of the war.

Hitler recommended Morell to others of the Nazi leadership, but most of them, including Hermann Göring and Heinrich Himmler, dismissed Morell as a quack. As Albert Speer related in his autobiography:
When Hitler was troubled with grogginess in the morning, Morell would inject him with a solution of water mixed with a substance from several small, gold-foiled packets, which he called &quot;Vitamultin&quot;. In 1943, Ernst-Günther Schenck, Nutrition Inspector for the Waffen SS and the Wehrmacht, became suspicious of the substance. Believing it was possibly inert or made up of diluted ingredients he sent some to the nutrition inspector&#x27;s office for testing. The report he received indicated the substance did contain certain vitamins but also methamphetamine, a substance known even then to be highly addictive and strictly controlled as a result. Schenck showed the results to Reich Health Leader Dr. Leonardo Conti who informed Heinrich Himmler. Himmler&#x27;s response was that the matter should be dropped immediately.

Speer characterized Morell as an opportunist who, once he achieved status as Hitler&#x27;s physician, became extremely careless and lazy in his work. By 1944, Morell developed a hostile rivalry with Dr. Karl Brandt, who had been attending Hitler since 1934. Though criticized by Brandt and other physicians, Morell was always &quot;restored to favor&quot;.

Morell was not popular with Hitler&#x27;s entourage, who complained about the doctor&#x27;s crude table manners, poor hygiene, and body odor. Hitler is said to have responded, &quot;I do not employ him for his fragrance, but to look after my health.&quot; Hermann Göring called Morell &quot;Der Reichsspritzenmeister&quot;, (&quot;Reich Master of Injections&quot;), and variations on that theme, implying that Morell resorted to using drug injections when faced with medical problems and overused them.

===Substances administered to Hitler===
Morell kept a medical diary of the drugs, tonics, vitamins, and other substances he administered to Hitler, usually by injection (up to 20 times per day) or in pill form. Most were commercial preparations; some were Morell&#x27;s own mixes. Since some of these compounds are considered toxic, historians have speculated that Morell inadvertently contributed to Hitler&#x27;s deteriorating health. The incomplete list &quot;(below)&quot; of some 74 substances (in 28 different mixtures) administered to Hitler include psychoactive drugs such as heroin as well as commercial poisons. Among the compounds, in alphabetical order, were:
# &quot;Brom-Nervacit&quot;: Bromide, sodium diethylbarbiturate, Pyramidon, since August 1941, a spoonful of this tranquilizer almost every night, to counteract stimulation from methamphetamine and to allow sleep.
# &quot;Cardiazol&quot; and &quot;Coramine&quot;: since 1941 for leg oedema.
# &quot;Chineurin&quot;: Quinine-containing preparation for common colds and flu.
# Cocaine and adrenaline (via eye drops).
# &quot;Coramine&quot;: Nikethamide injected when unduly sedated with barbiturates. In addition, Morell would use Coramine as part of an all-purpose &quot;tonic&quot;.

# &quot;Glyconorm&quot;: Metformin, metabolism enzymes (cozymase I and II), amino acids, vitamins – injectable solution as a strengthener tonic.
# &quot;Homatropin&quot;: Homatropine HBr 0.1 g, NaCl 0.08 g; Distilled water added 10 mL. Eye drops for right eye problems.
# &quot;Intelan&quot;: Twice a day Vitamins A, D3 and B12 – tablets as a strengthener, tonic.

# &quot;Luitzym&quot;: After each meal, enzymes with cellulase, hemicellulases, amylase, and proteases, for intestinal problems, meteorism.
# &quot;Mutaflor&quot;: Emulsion of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; strains – enteric coated tablets for improvement of intestinal flora. They were prescribed to Hitler for flatulence in 1936, the first unorthodox drug treatment from Morell; bacteria cultured from human feces, see: &quot;E. coli&quot;.
# &quot;Omnadin&quot;: Mixture of protein compounds, biliary lipids and animal fat, taken at the onset of infections (together with Vitamultin).
# &quot;Optalidon&quot;: Caffeine, propyphenazone – tablets at the beginning of infections (together with Vitamultin).
# &quot;Orchikrin&quot;: An extract of bovine testosterone, pituitary gland, and glycerophosphate, as a tonic, strengthener. Marketed also as an aphrodisiac.
# &quot;Penicilline-Hamma&quot;: Penicillin – powder topical antibiotic. After the attempted assassination of 20 July 1944 to treat his right arm.
# &quot;Pervitin&quot;: methamphetamine injections for mental depression and fatigue.
# &quot;Progynon B-Oleosum&quot;: Estradiol benzoate, benzoic ester of follicle hormone, for improvement of the circulation in the gastric mucosa.

# &quot;Septoid&quot;: intravenous injections of 10 cc of 3% iodine (in potassium iodide form) with 10 cc of 20% glucose, two or three times a day, to improve heart&#x27;s condition and the altered Second Sound.
# &quot;Strophantin&quot;: 1941–44 – cycle of 2 weeks of homeopathic Strophanthus gratus glycoside 0.2 mg per day for coronary sclerosis.

# &quot;Veritol&quot;: since March 1944 hydroxyphenyl-2-methylamino-propane – eyedrops for left eye treatment.
# &quot;Vitamultin-Calcium&quot;: Caffeine, vitamins.
An &quot;almost&quot; complete listing of the drugs used by Morell, wrote historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, was compiled after the war from his meticulous daily records and unlikely to have been exaggerated.
Morrell was trained as a general practitioner. However, his specialty was training neither in dermatology nor venereology but in obstetrics and gynecology. Despite his lack of training, Morrell did treat Hitler (who had an obsessive fear of VD) with Arsenobenzol, designated &quot;606&quot;, salvarsan, neosalvarsan with bismuth and iodine salts.

===World War II===
In 1939, Morell inadvertently became involved with the invasion of Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovak president, Emil Hacha, became so scared at Hitler&#x27;s outburst that he fainted. Morell injected stimulants into Hacha to wake him, and although he claimed that these were only vitamins, they may have included methamphetamine. Hacha soon gave in to Hitler&#x27;s demands.

When Reinhard Heydrich, who was serving as Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia – the rump left of Czechoslovakia after Hitler annexed it – was the victim of an assassination attempt in May 1942, Morell was one of the doctors brought in by Heinrich Himmler to treat the badly-wounded SS man. Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s chief doctor, Karl Gebhardt, ignored his recommendation to use antibiotics; gangrene set in, and Heydrich died a week later.

After the 20 July 1944 assassination attempt against Hitler, Morell treated him with topical penicillin, which had only recently been introduced into testing by the U.S. Army. Where he acquired it is unknown, and Morell claimed complete ignorance of penicillin when American intelligence officers interrogated him after the war. When members of Hitler&#x27;s inner circle were interviewed for the book &quot;The Bunker,&quot; some claimed Morell owned a significant share in a company fraudulently marketing a product as penicillin.

When Hitler developed jaundice in September 1944, Dr. Erwin Giesing – an ear, nose and throat specialist who had initially been brought in to treat the dictator after the damage done to his eardrums from the bomb explosion of the 20 July plot – began to be suspicious of Morell&#x27;s treatment of Hitler. Suspecting that he knew the cause of the jaundice, Giesing deliberately dosed himself with some of the &quot;Dr. Koester&#x27;s Anti-Gas Pills&quot;, which Morell had Hitler taking in large numbers every day, and found that they had mildly harmful effects. Having them analyzed, he found they contained strychnine and belladonna, the strychnine being the cause of the jaundice. Giesing reported his results to two of Hitler&#x27;s other doctors, Karl Brandt and Hanskarl von Hasselbach, who in turn told other members of Hitler&#x27;s retinue. When word of this finally reached Hitler, he was furious. Declaring that he had total faith in Morell and his treatments, he dismissed all three doctors – Giesing, Brandt, and Hasselbach – even though the latter two had been with him since his early days in power. Several months later, Brandt was imprisoned and condemned to death at the Nuremberg trials.

By April 1945, Hitler was taking many pills a day, along with numerous injections. The personal notes of Morell describe how he treated Hitler over the years, including notations such as, &quot;injection as always&quot;, and, &quot;Eukodal&quot;, an early German trade name for the opioid oxycodone.

Morell was one of the occupants of the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;, located in the garden of the Reich Chancellery, once Hitler and his entourage relocated there from the Wolf&#x27;s Lair in Rastenburg in East Prussia. As the Battle of Berlin progressed and the outlook became dire, it was Morell who provided the cyanide capsules which Eva Braun would later use to kill herself, and which Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda used to murder their six children before killing themselves.

On 20 April 1945, Hitler ordered Morell, Albert Bormann, Admiral Karl-Jesko von Puttkamer, Dr. Hugo Blaschke, secretaries Johanna Wolf, Christa Schroeder, and several others to leave the bunker and Berlin by aircraft for the Obersalzberg. Hitler told Morell he did not need any more medical help, although he continued to take many of the medications Morell had prescribed for him; during the last week of Hitler&#x27;s life, it was administered by Dr. Werner Haase and by Heinz Linge, Hitler&#x27;s valet. The group flew out of Berlin on different flights by aircraft of the &quot;Fliegerstaffel des Führers&quot; over the following three days. Morell was on the flight which left Berlin on 23 April.

==Personal awards and wealth==
Hitler awarded Morell the title of Professor and gave him the Golden Party Badge and the Knights Cross of the War Merit Cross. Morell was able to use his relationship with Hitler to sell his &quot;Vitamultin&quot; to the German Labor Front and his delousing product &quot;Rußla powder&quot; to the Wehrmacht. In addition to an annual salary of , these business ventures earned Morell a fortune of about seven million Reichsmark.

==Final years and death==
Morell was captured by American forces and interrogated on 18 May 1945. One of his interrogators was reportedly &quot;disgusted&quot; by his obesity and lack of hygiene. Although he was held in an American internment camp on the site of the former Dachau concentration camp and questioned because of his proximity to Hitler, Morell was never charged with a crime. Grossly obese and suffering from poor health, he died in a Tegernsee hospital on 26 May 1948.

<text>The Sacramento perch (Archoplites interrupts) is from the family Centrarchidae, characterized by dorsal fins with spiny elements and known for its nesting behavior. There are about 31 species in this family, which include sunfishes, crappies, and basses. The Sacramento perch is considered in the sunfish group. It is the only species of Centrarchidae whose native habitat resides west of the Rocky Mountains, while all the other species are native to the east.

They are indigenous to the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, Pajaro, and Salinas River areas but have been widely introduced outside their native range throughout California. They have also been introduced outside of the state, in Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Texas, to revive their populations. While there is no updated analysis of their populations in these states, it is certain that they still exist throughout California. However, there is speculation of viable populations in Utah, Nevada, and Colorado. The Sacramento perch&#x27;s native habitat is in sluggish, heavily vegetated waters of sloughs and lakes. It can reach a maximum overall length of 73 cm (29 in) and a maximum weight of 1.4 kg (3.1 lb), and it has been reported to live as long as nine years. Its adaptability to different habitats is variable, and it can survive on various food sources, from insects, bottom-dwelling snails, phytoplankton, and small fishes. As young perch, they consume mainly small crustaceans and eventually move on to insect larvae and then smaller fish as adults.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Archoplites interruptus&quot; belongs to the family Centrarchidae, within the order Perciformes. Although called the Sacramento perch, &quot;A. interruptus&quot; is not a perch strictly speaking. The perches are members of the genus &quot;Perca&quot; in the family Percidae. Being the only native centrarchid west of the Rockies, the Sacramento perch is believed to closely resemble the ancestral fish that split from the rest of the other species residing in the east. This split was believed to occurred during the Middle Miocene period, which is about 15.5 to 5.2 MYA. It was initially thought that the Sacramento perches’ close relatives were the flyer (Centrarchus macropterous) and crappies (Pomoxis spp.). However, a reevaluation of this using DNA sequences shows that it is most closely related to the Rock Bass.

&quot;A. interruptus&quot; is currently the only species of the genus &quot;Archoplites&quot;, but Girard, an ichthyologist, originally assigned it to &quot;Centrarchus&quot;. The genus name comes from the Greek words that mean anus and armor, which refers to the anal spines. The species name, &quot;interruptus&quot;, refers to the irregular stripe pattern on its sides.

== Description ==

The body shape of this fish is laterally compressed, and it is considered to be deep-bodied for a Centrarchid species. Being deep-bodied refers to it being wide in length from its ventral to dorsal side. On average, its depth is 2.5 times greater than the average length of all other Centrarchids. This fish has a slightly angled mouth in the superior position, indicating that it feeds on insects near the middle of the water column. The mouth is large, with numerous small teeth found on its jaws, tongue, and roof of its mouth. The dorsal fin has a strictly spiny portion with about 12–14 spines that is continuous, with the soft-rayed portion that has 10–11 spines. It has fairly large cycloid scales numerously ranging from 38 to 48 along the lateral line in an adult. It has a combination of white, silver, and dark brown colored scales.
The Sacramento perch is most identifiable by its irregular dark brown vertical bars that almost resemble stripes, giving it great cryptic coloration in dark and vertically broken-up habitats provided by aquatic plants. The females, however, tend to have these bars less prominent and have more of an even coloration with the silver scales. There are about 25–30 gill rakers in its gills, and has black spots on the operculum. During the breeding season, there tends to be more sexual dimorphism. Overall,  the males become darker with metallic green-purple scales and display purple opercula, as shown in the right image.

The color in females is plainer with spotted opercula. Its size is dependent on how old the fish is. A Sacramento perch at age 1 would measure 6–13 cm, at age 2 it would be 12–19 cm, and the growth rate will begin to slow.[] The largest of this species ever recorded was 73 cm total length.

== Distribution ==

Historically, the Sacramento perch was found throughout the Central Valley of California at elevations below 100 m. The Sacramento perch was very popular for recreational fishing. It was so abundant that this species was commonly used as a food fish eaten regularly. It inhabited sloughs, slow-moving rivers of the Pajaro and Salinas rivers, and lakes with emergent vegetation such as Clear Lake. This species has been eliminated from 90% of its natural habitat due to habitat destruction, egg predation by invasive fish species, and interspecific competition with other centrarchids, mainly bluegill. Sacramento perch are quite rare in their native range and are found primarily in warm, turbid, and alkaline farm ponds, reservoirs, and recreational lakes that it has been introduced into. Sacramento perch populations exist in six California watersheds, including Clear Lake Reservoir, Cedar Creek, Walker River, upper Owens River, Mono Lake, and Abbotts Lagoon. In Colorado, there were two successful introductions in private land, one in Abrams Lake and the other in Gilberts Pond. The growth rate of the fish here was very rapid, but spawning is yet to be determined. Sacramento perch populations in Nevada were transplanted in 1877 from the Sacramento River into Washoe Lake. Eventually, they were moved again into Pyramid and Walker Lake in 1880. These populations have grown and expanded in Eureka, Churchhill, Elko, Humbolt, Lander, and Washoe counties. However, the populations in Pyramid and Washoe Lake need a current reevaluation since the state of Nevada has been implementing actions of introducing large predatory game fish such as walleyes, basses, and other centrarchid species. In Utah, the early populations of Nevada were transplanted in the Garrison Reservoir along the Bear River. According to the state wildlife agency, in 2006, the population was still present but with a small population. Due to a lack of recent population surveys, this is also currently unknown.

== Diet ==
Aquatic insects are critical to the Sacramento perch&#x27;s diet. This fish mostly feeds on chironomid midge larvae and pupae found on the bottom or in aquatic plants during winter months. Triochopteran larvae and recently hatched boatmen are also common insect food sources. During the summer months, this fish will mostly feed on plankton and other surface organisms. The Sacramento perch is an opportunistic species and will generally prey upon whatever is in abundance. They have even been shown to eat mosquito larvae. However, eating mosquito larvae is rare because these fishes are mainly midwater swimmers and do not usually feed on terrestrial or flying insects. The younger and smaller adult perches mostly feed on small benthic crustaceans. As they grow, they move on to chironomid larvae and other fish, including their own species on rare occasions. Sacramento perch of Pyramid Lake have been found feeding on Tui chubs and Tahoe suckers. Based on experimental designs in aquariums, they usually hunt alone and will slowly stalk their prey for a period of time. Once their prey becomes comfortable and loses focus, it is unprecedentedly snatched by the perch&#x27;s sudden burst toward the prey. This behavior differs from the bluegill, its main competitive species, which usually hunts in schools and is much more aggressive towards its prey. The Sacramento perch is most active at dawn and dusk but can feed at any time of the day or night.

== Breeding Pattern ==
Spawning occurs from late March through early August, with peak times being late May and early June when water temperatures are between 18 and 29 °C. Studies in aquarium environments, however, have shown that the range is usually between 22 and 24 °C. The Sacramento perch reaches breeding age at 2–3 years old. The perch lay their eggs in 8 to 12 inch diameter nests in shallow waters, usually with rock piles, submerged roots, or other substrates nearby. These nests are not created but found, differentiating them from all the other centrarchid species that create their own nests. Nesting sites are scouted by males about 12 hours before nesting, and once obtained, they begin defending their territory. These nest areas are vigorously defended from other males by chasing, biting, and flaring opercular flaps at each other. Intruders can be attacked within 18 inches of the defender. When getting ready to attack intruders, the Sacramento perch quivers its tail as it maintains itself stationary with its pectoral fins. The entire body of the fish does not move during the quivering. When a female approaches, the aggressive behavior of the male acts as a barrier to immediate mating. Females persistently approach males and are driven off for up to an hour before successful mating. With the consistent approaches, the male recognizes that the intruder is a potential mate. After that, both sexes begin to engage in a set of activities furthering their bond. The male will lightly bite and may try to roll the female to turn on one side. They will also begin to actively pick up small substrates with their mouths and let go of them. Females spawn by releasing their eggs into the nest, followed by the male quickly fertilizing them. Spawning can also occur ventrally side by side, with sperm and egg being released at the same time in a circular fashion. The male cares for the fertilized eggs for several days until they hatch and two days after to defend them against predators. When the eggs hatch, they are like tiny planktonic fish that rise to the surface to feed and grow for a couple of weeks before settling down into the vegetation at the bottom.

== Restoration Efforts ==
The Sacramento perch is a very resilient fish species with a highly variable diet. It is adapted to withstand low water clarity, high temperatures, and even water with high salinity and alkalinity. This is why it has been chosen as the primary fish used in aquaponics systems. Aquaponics farms in California are incorporating the use of this endangered species in their systems for growing vegetables. This also serves as a restoration project to breed Sacramento perch to release them back into native waters and add diversity to the wild population. With the rising temperatures in California, the mosquito population has been growing. A study shows that Sacramento perch bred in captivity prefer eating mosquito larvae. These results show that this species has the potential to be used to help control these growing populations in California wetlands. Although populations of Sacramento perch are not as numerous as before, many programs today are focusing on reintroducing them across California waterways again. Potential habitats include Putah Creek and Clear Lake, where the Sacramento perch were abundant at one time but, due to the construction of heavy infrastructure, could not persist. This species is also being reintroduced upstream of its native habitats in gravel pit ponds. However, due to limited genetic diversity, inbreeding has occurred in these isolated populations. To prevent this, reintroduction programs have been pulling only the most diverse fish from current populations and closely monitoring the diversity of the new populations using genetic markers.

== Conservation Status ==

The Sacramento perch is considered endangered according to the IUCN red list and its populations are projected to continually decline. The main threat to its population numbers is not so much climate change or even the change in water quality. They are euryhaline organisms, meaning they are well-adapted to survive and reproduce in alkaline waters containing high concentrations of chloride-sulfate and sodium-potassium ions. In these conditions, most other game fish would not survive. The highest alkaline concentration recorded that this fish was found surviving in was 4,083 ppm. The Sacramento perch dies off once the alkalinity concentration goes below 2000 ppm. The main threat to this species’ survival is interspecific competition with other introduced centrarchid species that are typically larger in size and prey upon it. One in particular is the bluegill since its diet is similar, and they have the same preferred nesting areas. The bluegill&#x27;s advantage is not so much in size but in its aggressive behavior. Field observations in small ponds and experimental observations in aquariums consistently show the dominance of the bluegill over the Sacramento perch by aggressively chasing them. This aggression of the bluegill can quickly eliminate young Sacramento perch from shallow nesting waters occupied with aquatic plants. This forces them to lay their eggs in deeper, more open space waters. This poses a threat to individuals as they will be more visible to larger fish predators and birds. The eggs themselves will also be in danger of being eaten by other aquatic organisms. A good example of this detrimental interspecific competition is in Clear Lake, which was known to be one of the habitats containing a prominent Sacramento perch population until it gradually declined as bluegills increased. The best strategy to allow Sacramento perch populations to thrive over invasive species would require the creation of aquatic habitats such as watersheds, reservoirs, or lakes with a high alkalinity salt content. Furthermore, restoring their populations back to their native range of the Central Valley in California would require restoring the flow regime of the rivers as close to their natural state as possible. This means the flows must be in higher magnitude with frequent fluctuations of cold water. Invasive fish would not be adapted to these water fluctuations because of the change in salt content that would arise. It would be particularly effective if these water management practices were targeted in the lower part of the Sacramento River.

<doc id="1217104" wikidata="Q899393" url="?curid=1217104" title="Stokes shift">
<text>Stokes shift is the difference (in energy, wavenumber or frequency units) between positions of the band maxima of the absorption and emission spectra (fluorescence and Raman being two examples) of the same electronic transition. It is named after Irish physicist George Gabriel Stokes.

When a system (be it a molecule or atom) absorbs a photon, it gains energy and enters an excited state. The system can relax by emitting a photon. The Stokes shift occurs when the energy of the emitted photon is lower than that of the absorbed photon, representing the difference in energy of the two photons.

The Stokes shift is primarily the result of two phenomena: vibrational relaxation or dissipation and solvent reorganization. A fluorophore is a part of a molecule with a dipole moment that exhibits fluorescence. When a fluorophore enters an excited state, its dipole moment changes, but surrounding solvent molecules cannot adjust so quickly. Only after vibrational relaxation do their dipole moments realign.

Stokes shifts can also be given in wavelength units, but this is less meaningful than energy, wavenumber or frequency units because it depends on the absorption wavelength. For instance, a 50 nm Stokes shift from absorption at 300 nm is larger in terms of energy than a 50 nm Stokes shift from absorption at 600 nm.

== Stokes fluorescence ==
Stokes fluorescence is the emission of a longer-wavelength photon (lower frequency or energy) by a molecule that has absorbed a photon of shorter wavelength (higher frequency or energy). Both absorption and radiation (emission) of energy are distinctive for a particular molecular structure. If a material has a direct bandgap in the range of visible light, the light shining on it is absorbed, which excites electrons to a higher-energy state. The electrons remain in the excited state for about 10−8 seconds. This number varies over several orders of magnitude, depending on the sample, and is known as the &quot;fluorescence lifetime&quot; of the sample. After losing a small amount of energy through vibrational relaxation, the molecule returns to the ground state, and energy is emitted. 

== Anti-Stokes shift ==
If the emitted photon has more energy than the absorbed photon, the energy difference is called an anti-Stokes shift; this extra energy comes from dissipation of thermal phonons in a crystal lattice, cooling the crystal in the process. Anti-Stokes shifts may also be due to triplet-triplet annihilation processes, resulting in the formation of higher singlet states that emit at higher energies.

== Applications of Stokes and anti-Stokes shifts ==

=== Raman spectroscopy ===
In Raman spectroscopy, when a molecule is excited by incident radiation, it undergoes a Stokes shift as it emits radiation at a lower energy level than the incident radiation. Analyzing the intensity and frequency of the spectral shift provides valuable information about the vibrational modes of molecules, enabling the identification of chemical bonds, functional groups, and molecular conformations.

=== Yttrium oxysulfide ===
Yttrium oxysulfide () doped with gadolinium oxysulfide () is a common industrial anti-Stokes pigment, absorbing in the near-infrared and emitting in the visible region of the spectrum. This composite material is often utilized in luminescent applications, where it absorbs lower-energy photons and emits higher-energy photons. This unique property makes it particularly valuable in various technological fields, including security printing, anti-counterfeiting measures, and luminescent displays. By harnessing anti-Stokes fluorescence, this pigment enables the creation of vibrant and durable inks, coatings, and materials with enhanced visibility and authentication capabilities.

=== Photon upconversion ===
Photon upconversion is an anti-Stokes process where lower-energy photons are converted into higher-energy photons. An example of this later process is demonstrated by upconverting nanoparticles. It is more commonly observed in Raman spectroscopy, where it can be used to determine the temperature of a material.

=== Optoelectronic devices ===
In direct-bandgap thin-film semiconducting layers Stokes shifted emission can originate from three main sources: doping, strain, and disorder. Each of these factors can introduce variations in the energy levels of the semiconductor material, leading to a shift in the emitted light towards longer wavelengths compared to the incident light. This phenomenon is particularly relevant in optoelectronic devices where controlling these factors can be crucial for optimizing device performance.

<doc id="1217105" wikidata="Q5032062" url="?curid=1217105" title="Candy Broad">
<text>Candy Celeste Broad (born 4 January 1956) is an Australian politician. She has been a Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Council from September 1999 to May 2014, first representing the electorate of Melbourne North Province until 2006, and then as a Member for the Northern Victoria region.

After making a name for herself as the Assistant National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party (ALP), Broad moved into politics, contesting a safe Labor seat at the 1999 Victorian state election. She was immediately promoted into the ministry and served three years as Minister for Energy and Resources and Minister for Ports. After overseeing a range of changes in this area, she was promoted to Minister for Local Government and Housing after the 2002 election, but was unsuccessful in retaining a frontbench position following the 2006 Victorian State Election.

==Beginnings==
Broad was born in Perth, Western Australia, and studied commerce at the University of Western Australia. She graduated in 1978 and joined the Australian Labor Party the following year. After moving to Melbourne, Victoria in 1980, she worked as an administrator at the Labor Resource Centre—which specialised in industry and employment-related research—for several years. In 1986, she was appointed as a ministerial adviser, specialising in conservation for three years, before switching to education in 1989.

In 1991, Broad was promoted to Head of the Premier&#x27;s Office under Joan Kirner. This tenure was to be short-lived, as the Kirner government was defeated the following year, but she re-emerged as the party&#x27;s Assistant National Secretary in 1993. While in this position, she had considerable influence over the creation of federal ALP policy, and campaigned for the rights of women in the party. To this end, Broad played a significant role in the 1994 introduction of the ALP&#x27;s affirmative action scheme, aiming to have women pre-selected in 35 percent of winnable seats. She was also heavily involved in the creation in 1996 of Emily&#x27;s List Australia, the support network for ALP women.

In the months before the 1999 state election, Caroline Hogg, the sitting member for the very safe Labor Legislative Council seat of Melbourne North Province, announced that she would resign only halfway through her term. This meant that a by-election for her seat would be held alongside the regular election, and Broad won Labor pre-selection to fill the vacancy.

==First term (1999–2002)==
The election saw Broad easily defeat her Liberal rival, and also saw the ALP, under new leader Steve Bracks, regain power after seven years. The widely unexpected victory meant that several first-time MPs were promoted to the ministry, and Broad was appointed Minister for Energy and Resources, Minister for Ports, and Minister Assisting the Minister for State and Regional Development. In this new portfolio, Broad was forced to deal with a number of major issues, particularly those surrounding the state&#x27;s power supplies and natural resources.

One of Broad&#x27;s first challenges as an incoming minister was to deal with the fate of the Snowy River, which had diminished to a trickle as a result of being dammed for various purposes. Though it had been an environmental issue for many years, it became of particular concern to the Bracks government, as the issue was central to the support of independent Craig Ingram, who they relied on to retain a majority in parliament. It fell to Broad, as the relevant minister, to handle negotiations on the issue with both the federal and New South Wales state governments. Despite the involvement of a number of conflicting interests, a major agreement was reached between the three parties in October 2000. This saw A$160 million put towards regenerating the river, with the intention of increasing its water flow to 28% of its original capacity.

Broad was also faced with the problem of balancing the need to promote environmentally sustainable sources of energy against the need to maintain a cheap and reliable electricity supply across the state. She publicly supported the Kyoto Protocol, and oversaw the introduction of the Victorian Greenhouse Strategy, which introduced a range of reforms, such as mandated five-star efficiency standards for new houses, and which, according to the government, would save &quot;about five to eight million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year&quot;.

Despite this, Broad oversaw the tendering process for the first new brown coal licenses in Victoria in almost a century. This decision allowed for the construction of coal-to-oil facilities capable of emitting several million tons of additional carbon dioxide each year, with associated conditions requiring that they introduce more efficient means of production in order to minimise the environmental costs. However, the tenders led to substantial criticism from several environmental groups, such as Environment Victoria, who argued that it could &quot;wipe out all of the savings&quot; achieved in the Greenhouse Strategy, and pushed for a complete ban on new brown coal facilities.

As the minister responsible for energy, Broad was entrusted with the task of maintaining stable electricity supplies across the state. In this way, she helped to establish the National Electricity Market Ministers Forum, a high-level organisation with the mission of expediting reform in the area. She went on to serve as its founding chair during 2001.

In addition, she oversaw the instigation of two major changes to the state&#x27;s electricity industry. This involved the establishment of the position of the Essential Services Commissioner, which created a regulatory body that could deal with individual complaints, and the introduction of choice in dealing with retail electricity companies. This encouraged the various electricity companies to compete for customers, replacing a system where each had operated with a monopoly in certain regions. However, Broad was also to face serious difficulties associated with industrial relations in this area, most notably when she was forced to play a mediating role in a long-running and much-publicised dispute between Yallourn Energy, one of the state&#x27;s major power suppliers, and their workforce.

==Second term (2002–2006)==
Due to being elected in a by-election, Broad had to face re-election at the November 2002 state election, but was easily re-elected. After the election, Premier Bracks oversaw a major reshuffle of the ministry, and Broad was moved to the higher-profile portfolios of Local Government and Housing, at the expense of Bob Cameron, who was demoted to Agriculture. These new portfolios left Broad responsible for the issues of public housing, homelessness and local councils in general, as well as overseeing the November 2004 council elections.

Broad was responsible for implementing a controversial $70 million proposal to encourage welfare groups and councils to form not-for-profit housing associations as a means of dealing with public housing. Though Broad had not been involved in the plan&#x27;s conception, as it had been devised by her predecessor as Minister for Housing, she had to deal with the mixed reactions the proposal received. While it was commended by some, such as the Salvation Army, others, such as the Brotherhood of St Laurence worried that it gave them little protection if an association ran into financial trouble.

Under Broad, several public housing estates underwent major renovations - most notably in the notorious Kensington area of Melbourne and in Wendouree West, Ballarat. A number of smaller residential facilities were also built, mostly in regional areas. However, she came under fire from several organisations representing public tenants for agreeing to raise rent charges across the state, as well as to sell off significant open space adjacent to an estate in Port Melbourne.

Broad&#x27;s tenure as Minister for Housing also included the unveiling of the Youth Homeless Action Plan. This both attempted to determine major causes of homelessness and provided a number of potential means for dealing with the problem, such as family mediation and further attempts at education. It resulted in an influx of $8.8 million into relevant programs, as well as a $298,000 grant to the Melbourne Citymission. In addition, she oversaw the introduction of a $200,000 plan to prevent homeless in the regional area of Loddon Mallee, and opened a series of small accommodation centres for the homeless in both Melbourne and a number of regional centres.

In comparison to the many developments under the housing portfolio, Broad&#x27;s term as Minister for Local Government has been comparatively uneventful. As the responsible minister for the November 2004 council elections, she came under some fire for not intervening in the City of Melbourne lord mayoral race, which had over 100 candidates vying for two positions, resulting in widespread allegations of dummy candidates. However, she claimed some vindication when the result was widely uncontroversial, seeing the re-election of incumbent Lord Mayor of Melbourne John So.

==Third term (2006–2014)==
Broad wished to continue as a Minister following Labor&#x27;s victory on 25 November 2006, however, she did not have enough votes within the Labor Caucus to secure a frontbench position. She went to the backbench in the odd position of never having been a backbencher in her seven-year parliamentary career.

Broad introduced the Abortion Law Reform Bill into the Parliament in 2008, which was passed overwhelmingly on a conscience vote by Members of all parties.

Broad did not contest the 2014 election.

==Personal life==

Broad is an avid football supporter, and is a member of the Collingwood Football Club. She supports voluntary euthanasia, being a member of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society of Victoria, and is a member of several community organisations, such as the Australian Conservation Foundation.

<text>Pocketwatch is a cassette album by Dave Grohl, under the pseudonym Late!, released in 1992, on the now-defunct indie label Simple Machines as part of their Tool Cassette Series.

==Background==
In the summer of 1991, Dave Grohl went into WGNS Studios and recorded four songs, playing all the instruments himself. The recording was combined with six songs from a previous Upland Studios session recorded in late 1990. Both sessions occurred after Grohl had joined Nirvana. A tape of the songs, given to Simple Machines co-founder Jenny Toomey by Grohl, immediately became a candidate for the label&#x27;s Tool Cassette Series. The 1990 sessions emerged as Grohl, then the drummer of Scream, requested his producer friend Barrett Jones to record songs on his home 8-track tape recorder. Upon accepting Simple Machines&#x27; request for a demo tape, Grohl decided to hide his identity under the pseudonym Late!, &quot;because I’m an idiot and I thought it would be funny to say to everybody, &#x27;Sorry, we’re Late!’&quot;.

The Tool Cassette Series started around 1991 as an experiment and as a way of keeping music &quot;in print&quot; on an as-needed basis without having to finance vinyl or CD pressings, since Simple Machines dubbed the cassettes as the orders came in. With multiple cassette decks and a lot of volunteer help, this was a manageable project for the label. Shortly after Nirvana released &quot;Nevermind&quot; in the fall of 1991, its unexpected success was large enough that &quot;Pocketwatch&quot; eventually became noticed. It gained more attention when the Foo Fighters&#x27; early material was released in 1995. Some of the songs appeared on subsequent releases, creating even higher demand for the cassette. Suddenly, &quot;Pocketwatch&quot; was being mentioned frequently in interviews, and the label became flooded with orders. Grohl claimed that the big number of requests led Toomey to &quot;literally dub them on a double cassette deck in her bedroom.&quot;

With minimal help and deteriorating master cassettes, Simple Machines got in touch with Grohl about releasing the Late! album as a CD, to keep up with demand. However, Grohl preferred to keep it as a cassette-only release, which the label honored. The musician explained later that he refused to do a CD release because &quot;it was never intended to be a big thing&quot;, but Grohl also joked, regarding &quot;Pocketwatch&quot;″s current status as a highly sought collectible, that he &quot;wanted to drive up the price of cassettes to $3,000&quot;. When the two master cassettes for &quot;Pocketwatch&quot; came to the end of their useful lives, and with some of the other artists&#x27; masters in the same condition, Simple Machines decided to discontinue the Tool Cassette Series from their mailorder, putting the over-half-decade experiment to an end.

==Other releases==
As cassettes became a less popular format, and with no official CD release in sight, &quot;Pocketwatch&quot; fell victim to countless bootleg CD releases, ranging from a single song to the entire album. &quot;Color Pictures of a Marigold&quot; appeared on the rarities collection &quot;Outcesticide III: The Final Solution&quot;, part of a popular Nirvana bootleg series on Blue Moon Records. The song also appeared on &quot;Fighting the &quot;N&quot; Factor&quot;, an unauthorized Foo Fighters release that included the track as a bonus, with Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; rehearsals and Tunnel TV Show performance. The Late! album appeared in its entirety on the Foo Fighters&#x27; bootleg album &quot;Pocketwatch Demos&quot; on Primadonna, a bootleg label active throughout the 1990s, based in Milan, Italy.

Songs from the Late! album made appearances on official releases as well. Prior to the &quot;Pocketwatch&quot; offering, &quot;Petrol CB&quot; was included on the &quot;Neapolitan Metropolitan&quot; 7&quot; vinyl box set compilation released by Simple Machines in 1992, under the title &quot;There&#x27;s That Song&quot; and also featured tracks from Breadwinner, Burma Jam, Bratmobile, and Lilys, among others. The only song officially released on CD was a remixed version of &quot;Just Another Story About Skeeter Thompson&quot;, included on The Melvins&#x27; 1992 &quot;King Buzzo&quot; EP, retitled &quot;Skeeter&quot;.

Although constantly coupled with Nirvana and Foo Fighters collections, Late! should be considered its own separate project, even though both bands would go on to release new versions of songs from the &quot;Pocketwatch&quot; album. &quot;Color Pictures of a Marigold&quot; was re-recorded with Krist Novoselic on bass in 1993 and released as a B-side of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot; single, simply titled &quot;Marigold&quot;. This version would also appear on the 2004 &quot;With the Lights Out&quot; box set. Another version of the song appeared on the Foo Fighters live album &quot;Skin and Bones&quot;. &quot;Winnebago&quot; was re-recorded during the sessions for the first Foo Fighters album in 1994. Despite not making the album, it appeared as a B-side on the Foo Fighters first release, the &quot;Exhausted&quot; vinyl single, and later on the Australian bonus disc to &quot;Foo Fighters&quot; and as a B-side to the singles &quot;This Is a Call&quot; and &quot;Big Me&quot;. A new version of &quot;Friend of a Friend&quot; was first released on a free NME covermount cassette, then the acoustic side of the Foo Fighters&#x27; 2005 double album &quot;In Your Honor&quot; and later the following year on &quot;Skin and Bones&quot;.

<doc id="1217118" wikidata="Q775927" url="?curid=1217118" title="Tinea corporis">
<text>Tinea corporis is a fungal infection of the body, similar to other forms of tinea. Specifically, it is a type of dermatophytosis (or ringworm) that appears on the arms and legs, especially on glabrous skin; however, it may occur on any superficial part of the body.

==Signs and symptoms==
It may have a variety of appearances; most easily identifiable are the enlarging raised red rings with a central area of clearing (ringworm). The same appearances of ringworm may also occur on the scalp (tinea capitis), beard area (tinea barbae) or the groin (tinea cruris, known as jock itch or dhobi itch).

Other classic features of tinea corporis include:
* Itching occurs on infected area.
* The edge of the rash appears elevated and is scaly to touch.
* Sometimes the skin surrounding the rash may be dry and flaky.
* Almost invariably, there will be hair loss in areas of the infection.

==Causes==
Tinea corporis is caused by a tiny fungus known as dermatophyte. These tiny organisms normally live on the superficial skin surface, and when the opportunity is right, they can induce a rash or infection.

The disease can also be acquired by person-to-person transfer usually via direct skin contact with an infected individual. Animal-to-human transmission is also common. Ringworm commonly occurs on pets (dogs, cats) and the fungus can be acquired while petting or grooming an animal. Ringworm can also be acquired from other animals such as horses, pigs, ferrets, and cows. The fungus can also be spread by touching inanimate objects like personal care products, bed linen, combs, athletic gear, or hair brushes contaminated by an affected person.

Individuals at high risk of acquiring ringworm include those who:
* Live in crowded, humid conditions.
* Sweat excessively, as sweat can produce a humid wet environment where the pathogenic fungi can thrive. This is most common in the armpits, groin creases and skin folds of the abdomen.
* Participate in close contact sports like soccer, rugby, or wrestling.
* Wear tight, constrictive clothing with poor aeration.
* Have a weakened immune system (e.g., those infected with HIV or taking immunosuppressive drugs).

==Diagnosis==
Superficial scrapes of skin examined underneath a microscope may reveal the presence of a fungus. This is done by utilizing a diagnostic method called KOH test, wherein the skin scrapings are placed on a slide and immersed on a dropful of potassium hydroxide solution to dissolve the keratin on the skin scrappings thus leaving fungal elements such as hyphae, septate or yeast cells viewable. If the skin scrapings are negative and a fungus is still suspected, the scrapings are sent for culture. Because the fungus grows slowly, the culture results do take several days to become positive.

==Prevention==
Because fungi prefer warm, moist environments, preventing ringworm involves keeping skin dry and avoiding contact with infectious material. Basic prevention measures include:
* Washing hands after handling animals, soil, and plants.
* Avoiding touching characteristic lesions on other people.
* Wearing loose-fitting clothing.
* Practicing good hygiene when participating in sports that involve physical contact with other people.

==Treatment==
Most cases are treated by application of topical antifungal creams to the skin, but in extensive or difficult to treat cases, systemic treatment with oral medication may be required. The over-the-counter options include tolnaftate, as well as ketoconazole (available as Nizoral shampoo that can be applied topically).

Among the available prescription drugs, the evidence is best for terbinafine and naftifine, but other agents may also work.

Topical antifungals are applied to the lesion twice a day for at least 3 weeks. The lesion usually resolves within 2 weeks, but therapy should be continued for another week to ensure the fungus is completely eradicated. If there are several ringworm lesions, the lesions are extensive, complications such as secondary infection exist, or the patient is immunocompromised, oral antifungal medications can be used. Oral medications are taken once a day for 7 days and result in higher clinical cure rates. The antifungal medications most commonly used are itraconazole, terbinafine, and ketoconazole.

The benefits of the use of topical steroids in addition to an antifungal is unclear. There might be a greater cure rate but no guidelines currently recommend its addition. The effect of Whitfield&#x27;s ointment is also unclear.

==Prognosis==
Tinea corporis is moderately contagious and can affect both humans and pets. If a person acquires it, the proper measures must be taken to prevent it from spreading. Young children in particular should be educated about the infection and preventive measures: avoid skin to skin contact with infected persons and animals, wear clothing that allows the skin to breathe, and do not share towels, clothing or combs with others. If pets are kept in the household or premises, the animal should be checked for tinea, especially if hair loss in patches is noticed or the pet is scratching excessively. The majority of people who have acquired tinea know how uncomfortable the infection can be. However, the fungus can easily be treated and prevented in individuals with a healthy immune system.

==Society and culture==
When the dermatophytic infection presents in wrestlers, with skin lesions typically found on the head, neck, and arms it is sometimes called tinea corporis gladiatorum.

<doc id="1217120" wikidata="Q4723976" url="?curid=1217120" title="Algebra of random variables">
<text>In statistics, the algebra of random variables provides rules for the symbolic manipulation of random variables, while avoiding delving too deeply into the mathematically sophisticated ideas of probability theory. Its symbolism allows the treatment of sums, products, ratios and general functions of random variables, as well as dealing with operations such as finding the probability distributions and the expectations (or expected values), variances and covariances of such combinations.

In principle, the elementary algebra of random variables is equivalent to that of conventional non-random (or deterministic) variables. However, the changes occurring on the probability distribution of a random variable obtained after performing algebraic operations are not straightforward. Therefore, the behavior of the different operators of the probability distribution, such as expected values, variances, covariances, and moments, may be different from that observed for the random variable using symbolic algebra. It is possible to identify some key rules for each of those operators, resulting in different types of algebra for random variables, apart from the elementary symbolic algebra: Expectation algebra, Variance algebra, Covariance algebra, Moment algebra, etc.

== Elementary symbolic algebra of random variables ==
Considering two random variables formula_1 and formula_2, the following algebraic operations are possible:

* Addition: formula_3
* Subtraction: formula_4
* Multiplication: formula_5
* Division: Suppose formula_6, formula_7.
* Exponentiation: formula_8

In all cases, the variable formula_9 resulting from each operation is also a random variable. All commutative and associative properties of conventional algebraic operations are also valid for random variables. If any of the random variables is replaced by a deterministic variable or by a constant value, all the previous properties remain valid.

== Expectation algebra for random variables ==
The expected value formula_10 of the random variable formula_9 resulting from an algebraic operation between two random variables can be calculated using the following set of rules:

* Addition: formula_12
* Subtraction: formula_13
* Multiplication: formula_14. Particularly, if formula_1 and formula_2 are independent from each other, then: formula_17.
* Division: formula_18. Particularly, if formula_1 and formula_2 are independent from each other, then: formula_21.
* Exponentiation: formula_22

If any of the random variables is replaced by a deterministic variable or by a constant value (formula_23), the previous properties remain valid considering that formula_24 and, therefore, formula_25.

If formula_9 is defined as a general non-linear algebraic function formula_27 of a random variable formula_1, then:

formula_29

Some examples of this property include:

* formula_30
* formula_31
* formula_32
* formula_33

The exact value of the expectation of the non-linear function will depend on the particular probability distribution of the random variable formula_1.

== Variance algebra for random variables ==
The variance formula_35 of the random variable formula_9 resulting from an algebraic operation between random variables can be calculated using the following set of rules:

* Addition: formula_37. Particularly, if formula_1 and formula_2 are independent from each other, then: formula_40.
* Subtraction: formula_41. Particularly, if formula_1 and formula_2 are independent from each other, then: formula_44. That is, for independent random variables the variance is the same for additions and subtractions: formula_45
* Multiplication: formula_46. Particularly, if formula_1 and formula_2 are independent from each other, then: formula_49.
* Division: formula_50. Particularly, if formula_1 and formula_2 are independent from each other, then: formula_53.
* Exponentiation: formula_54

where formula_55 represents the covariance operator between random variables formula_1 and formula_2.

The variance of a random variable can also be expressed directly in terms of the covariance or in terms of the expected value:

formula_58

If any of the random variables is replaced by a deterministic variable or by a constant value (formula_23), the previous properties remain valid considering that formula_24 and formula_25, formula_62 and formula_63. Special cases are the addition and multiplication of a random variable with a deterministic variable or a constant, where:

* formula_64
* formula_65

If formula_9 is defined as a general non-linear algebraic function formula_27 of a random variable formula_1, then:

formula_69

The exact value of the variance of the non-linear function will depend on the particular probability distribution of the random variable formula_1.

== Covariance algebra for random variables ==
The covariance (formula_71) between the random variable formula_9 resulting from an algebraic operation and the random variable formula_1 can be calculated using the following set of rules:

*Addition: formula_74. If formula_1 and formula_2 are independent from each other, then: formula_77.
*Subtraction: formula_78. If formula_1 and formula_2 are independent from each other, then: formula_81. 
*Multiplication: formula_82. If formula_1 and formula_2 are independent from each other, then: formula_85.
*Division (covariance with respect to the numerator): formula_86. If formula_1 and formula_2 are independent from each other, then: formula_89.
*Division (covariance with respect to the denominator): formula_90. If formula_1 and formula_2 are independent from each other, then: formula_93.
*Exponentiation (covariance with respect to the base): formula_94.
*Exponentiation (covariance with respect to the power): formula_95.

The covariance of a random variable can also be expressed directly in terms of the expected value:

formula_96

If any of the random variables is replaced by a deterministic variable or by a constant value ( formula_23), the previous properties remain valid considering that formula_98, formula_99 and formula_100.

If formula_9 is defined as a general non-linear algebraic function formula_27 of a random variable formula_1, then:

formula_104

The exact value of the covariance of the non-linear function will depend on the particular probability distribution of the random variable formula_1.

== Approximations by Taylor series expansions of moments ==
If the moments of a certain random variable formula_1 are known (or can be determined by integration if the probability density function is known), then it is possible to approximate the expected value of any general non-linear function formula_107 as a Taylor series expansion of the moments, as follows:

formula_108, where formula_109 is the mean value of formula_1.

formula_111, where formula_112 is the &quot;n&quot;-th moment of formula_1 about its mean. Note that by their definition, formula_114 and formula_115. The first order term always vanishes but was kept to obtain a closed form expression.

Then,

formula_116, where the Taylor expansion is truncated after the formula_117-th moment.

Particularly for functions of normal random variables, it is possible to obtain a Taylor expansion in terms of the standard normal distribution:

formula_118, where formula_119 is a normal random variable, and formula_120 is the standard normal distribution. Thus,

formula_121, where the moments of the standard normal distribution are given by:

formula_122

Similarly for normal random variables, it is also possible to approximate the variance of the non-linear function as a Taylor series expansion as:

formula_123, where

formula_124, and

formula_125

==Algebra of complex random variables==
In the algebraic axiomatization of probability theory, the primary concept is not that of probability of an event, but rather that of a random variable. Probability distributions are determined by assigning an expectation to each random variable. The measurable space and the probability measure arise from the random variables and expectations by means of well-known representation theorems of analysis. One of the important features of the algebraic approach is that apparently infinite-dimensional probability distributions are not harder to formalize than finite-dimensional ones.

Random variables are assumed to have the following properties:
# complex constants are possible realizations of a random variable;
# the sum of two random variables is a random variable;
# the product of two random variables is a random variable;
# addition and multiplication of random variables are both commutative; and
# there is a notion of conjugation of random variables, satisfying and for all random variables and coinciding with complex conjugation if is a constant.

This means that random variables form complex commutative *-algebras. If then the random variable is called &quot;real&quot;.

An expectation on an algebra of random variables is a normalized, positive linear functional. What this means is that
# where is a constant;
# for all random variables ;
# for all random variables and ; and
# if is a constant.

One may generalize this setup, allowing the algebra to be noncommutative. This leads to other areas of noncommutative probability such as quantum probability, random matrix theory, and free probability.

<doc id="1217121" wikidata="Q6705694" url="?curid=1217121" title="Lutheran Free Church">
<text>The Lutheran Free Church (LFC) was a Lutheran denomination that existed in the United States, mainly in Minnesota and North Dakota, from 1897 until its merger into the American Lutheran Church (ALC) in 1963. The history of the church body predates its official organization, and a group of congregations that did not join the ALC formed the Association of Free Lutheran Congregations.

==Background==
Georg Sverdrup and Sven Oftedal were two scholars from prominent Haugean families in Norway who came to Augsburg Seminary, now Augsburg University, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to teach in the 1870s, bringing with them a radical view of Christian education that was centered on Scripture and the simple doctrines of Christianity. The Haugean movement took its name from Norwegian lay evangelist Hans Nielsen Hauge who spoke up against the Church establishment in Norway. Sverdrup and Oftedal had been concerned about hierarchy within the Christian church as well as the study of the Bible. They believed that, according to the New Testament, the local congregation was the correct form of God&#x27;s kingdom on earth. Their vision was for a church that promoted a “living” Christianity, emphasized an evangelism that would result in changed lives, and enabled the church member to exercise his/her spiritual gifts.

Augsburg was the seminary of the Conference of the Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America In 1890, the &quot;Conference&quot; joined with two other Lutheran church bodies to form the United Norwegian Lutheran Church of America (UNLC).

A dispute within the UNLC over which school, Augsburg or St. Olaf, should be the college of the church body led in 1893 to the creation of the Friends of Augsburg. By 1896, Sverdrup, Oftedal, and others felt their beliefs of a &quot;free church in a free land&quot; were being compromised and broke away from the UNLC, forming the Lutheran Free Church in 1897.

The LFC&#x27;s publishing house was the &quot;Messenger Press&quot; and its official English language magazine was the &quot;Lutheran Messenger&quot; started in 1918. During most of its earlier history the church also published a Norwegian language publication named &quot;Folkebladet&quot; (the People&#x27;s Paper).

In harmony with its emphasis on utilizing and developing the natural spiritual gifts of all the members of the Church, the LFC gave a freer rein to women within its church body to hold non-ordained ministries, offices, and responsibilities than many of its contemporary Lutheran counterparts. The LFC also strongly emphasized the importance of foreign missions (with missions fields in Madagascar and the Cameroons) and spent more of its financial resources on foreign missions and supported a larger number of foreign missionaries than many of its contemporary Lutheran church bodies of comparable size.

By the 1950s there was a growing movement by many Lutherans throughout the United States to merge smaller Lutheran bodies into larger ones. The Lutheran Free Church joined the American Lutheran Church on February 1, 1963, after votes were held in 1955, 1957, and 1961. In 1988 the ALC itself joined with other Lutheran churches to form the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). About 40 Lutheran Free Churches however did not join the ALC, instead forming the Association of Free Lutheran Congregations (AFLC) in October 1962. Today the AFLC has more than 250 congregations.

In 1963, just before its merger into the ALC, the LFC had 252 pastors, 334 congregations, and 90,253 members.

<doc id="1217122" wikidata="Q7747539" url="?curid=1217122" title="The List (magazine)">
<text>The List is Scotland&#x27;s biggest and longest standing guide to arts and entertainment and was founded in 1985.

The company&#x27;s activities include content syndication and running a network of websites carrying listings and editorial, covering film, eating and drinking, music, theatre, visual art, dance, kids and family, clubs and the Edinburgh Festivals. Originally launched in 1985 as a paid-for fortnightly arts and entertainment magazine covering Edinburgh and Glasgow, &quot;The List&quot; magazine switched to a free monthly magazine in 2022 and is weekly during the Edinburgh Festivals in August.

==History==

&quot;The List&quot; was founded as an independent limited company in October 1985 by Robin Hodge (publisher) and Nigel Billen (founding editor). The first editors were Nigel Billen and Sarah Hemming.

In 2007 the company launched its listings website.

In June 2016, &quot;The Sunday Times Scotland&quot; launched a fortnightly events guide pullout section, produced in collaboration with &quot;The List&quot;.

After near closing its doors in 2021, &quot;The List&quot; was relaunched after a successful Crowdfund campaign as &quot;List Publishing Ltd&quot;. Sheri Friers is the CEO and its board includes Assembly director William Burdett-Coutts and Dani Rae.

The original company, &quot;The List Ltd&quot;, changed name to &quot;Phylum Forge Ltd&quot;, and trades under the name &quot;Data Thistle&quot;.

&quot;Data Thistle&quot; continues the live events data services that formed part of &quot;The List’s&quot; original business, with &quot;List Publishing Ltd&quot; purchasing listings from &quot;Data Thistle&quot;.

== Activities ==
&quot;The List&quot; was a member of the group of organisations who developed an International Venue and Event Standard (IVES). A now dormant project.

&quot;The List&quot; was a member of the Creative Industries Federation.

==Publications==

&quot;The List&quot; publishes several printed guides throughout the year. These include the &quot;Edinburgh Festival Guide&quot;, the &quot;Eating &amp; Drinking Guide&quot;, which includes reviews of over 900 restaurants, cafes and bars in Glasgow and Edinburgh, and the annual &quot;Guide to Scotland&#x27;s Festivals&quot;. &quot;The List&quot; also publishes Summer and Winter Festival magazines in Adelaide, Australia.

&quot;The List&quot; also publishes a series of guides under the &quot;Larder&quot; imprint. Since 2009, it has published two national editions and more than twenty regional editions. &quot;The Larder&quot; provides comprehensive information and articles about producers and sources for local food and drink across Scotland.

==Online activity==

As the print magazine came under increasing competition in the early 2000s, listings were increasingly moved to its website. The network of sites includes minisites dedicated to Film, Food &amp; Drink and Edinburgh Festivals.

An archive (1985–2020) is available at http://archive.list.co.uk.

<doc id="1217123" wikidata="Q557879" url="?curid=1217123" title="Tomboy (software)">
<text>Tomboy is free and open-source desktop note-taking software written for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, and BSD operating systems. Tomboy is part of the GNOME desktop environment. As Ubuntu changed over time and its cloud synchronization software Ubuntu One came and went, Tomboy inspired various forks and clones. Its interface is a word processor with a wiki-like linking system to connect notes together. Words in the note body that match existing note titles become hyperlinks automatically, making it simple to construct a personal wiki. For example, repeated references to favorite artists would be automatically highlighted in notes containing their names. As of version 1.6 (2010), it supports text entries and hyperlinks to the World Wide Web, but not graphic image linking or embedding.

Development of the original Tomboy software ceased in 2017. Starting in 2017 the development team rewrote the software from scratch, for ease of maintenance and installation, renaming it tomboy-ng. Tomboy-ng is written in Free Pascal.

==Features==

Some of the editing features supported:
* Text highlighting
* Inline spell checking using GtkSpell
* Automatic hyperlinking of Web and email addresses
* Undo/redo
* Font styling and sizing
* Bulleted lists
* Note synchronization over SSH, WebDAV, Ubuntu One, or the Tomboy REST API that is implemented by several server applications

==Plugins==
Tomboy supports several plugins, including:
* Evolution mail links
* Galago/Pidgin presence
* Note of the day (disabled by default)
* Fixed width text
* HTML export
* LaTeX math (in the package , not installed by default)
* Print

==Ports==
* Conboy: a Tomboy port to the Maemo platform written in the C language
* Gnote: a conversion of the Tomboy code to the C++ language, but is not cross-platform
* libktomgirl: a platform-independent library that reads and writes the Tomboy File Format 
* Tomdroid: an effort to produce a Tomboy-compatbile notetaking app for the Android operating system.

<doc id="1217124" wikidata="Q361466" url="?curid=1217124" title="CERN Axion Solar Telescope">
<text>The CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) is an experiment in astroparticle physics to search for axions originating from the Sun. The experiment, sited at CERN in Switzerland, was commissioned in 1999 and came online in 2002 with the first data-taking run starting in May 2003. The successful detection of solar axions would constitute a major discovery in particle physics, and would also open up a brand new window on the astrophysics of the solar core.

CAST is currently the most sensitive axion helioscope.

==Theory and operation==
If the axions exist, they may be produced in the Sun&#x27;s core when X-rays scatter off electrons and protons in the presence of strong electric fields. The experimental setup is built around a 9.26 m long decommissioned test magnet for the LHC capable of producing a field of up to . This strong magnetic field is expected to convert solar axions back into X-rays for subsequent detection by X-ray detectors. The telescope observes the Sun for about 1.5 hours at sunrise and another 1.5 hours at sunset each day. The remaining 21 hours, with the instrument pointing away from the Sun, are spent measuring background axion levels.

CAST began operation in 2003 searching for axions up to . In 2005, Helium-4 was added to the magnet, extending sensitivity to masses up to 0.39 eV, then Helium-3 was used during 2008–2011 for masses up to 1.15 eV. CAST then ran with vacuum again searching for axions below 0.02 eV.

As of 2014, CAST has not turned up definitive evidence for solar axions. It has considerably narrowed down the range of parameters where these elusive particles may exist. CAST has set significant limits on axion coupling to electrons and photons.

A 2017 paper using data from the 2013–2015 run reported a new best limit on axion-photon coupling of 0.66×10 &quot;/&quot; GeV.

Built upon the experience of CAST, a much larger, new-generation, axion helioscope, the International Axion Observatory (IAXO), has been proposed and is now under preparation.

== Detectors ==
The CAST focuses on the solar axions using a helioscope, which is a 9.2 m superconducting LHC prototype dipole magnet. The superconductive magnet is maintained by constantly keeping it at 1.8 Kelvin using superfluid helium. There are two magnetic bores of 43 mm diameter and 9.2 6m length with X-ray detectors placed at all ends. These detectors are sensitive to photons from inverse Primakoff conversion of solar axions. The two X-ray telescopes of CAST measures both signal and background simultaneously with the same detector and reduces the systematic uncertainties.

From 2003 to 2013, the following three detectors were attached to ends of the dipole magnet, all based on the inverse Primakoff effect, to detect the photons converted from the solar axions.

# Conventional time projection chamber detectors (TPC).
# MICROMEsh GAseous Structure detectors (MICROMEGAS).
# X-ray telescope with a charged couple device (CCD).

After 2013 several new detectors such as the RADES, GridPix, and KWISP were installed, with modified goals and newly enhanced technologies.

=== Conventional time projection chamber detectors (TPC) ===
TPC is a gas-filled drift chambers type of detector, designed to detect the low-intensity X-ray signals at CAST. The interactions in this detector take place in a very large gaseous chamber and produce ionizing electrons. These electrons travel towards the multiwire proportional chamber (MWPC), where the signal is then amplified through the avalanche process.

=== MICROMEsh GAseous Structure detectors (MICROMEGAS) ===
This detector operated during the period of 2002 to 2004. It is a gaseous detector and was primarily employed for to detect X-rays in the energy range of 1–10 KeV. The detector itself was made up of low radioactive materials. The choice of material was mainly based on reducing the background noise, and Micromegas achieved a significantly low background rejection of without any shielding.

=== X-ray telescope with a charged couple device (CCD) ===
This detector has a pn-CCD chip located at the focal plane of the X-ray telescope. The X-ray telescope is based on the popular Wolter-I mirror optics concept. This technique is widely used in almost all X-ray astronomy telescopes. Its mirror is made up of 27 gold-coated nickel shells. These parabolic and hyperbolic shells are confocally arranged to optimize the resolution. The largest shell is 163 mm in diameter, while the smallest is 76 mm. The overall mirror system has a focal length of 1.6 m. This detector achieved a remarkably good signal to noise ratio by focusing the axions created inside the magnetic field chamber onto small, about few formula_1 area.

=== GridPix detector ===
In 2016, The GridPix detector was installed to detect the soft X-rays (energy range of 200 eV to 10 KeV) generated by solar chameleons through the primakoff effect. During the search period of 2014 to 2015 the detected signal-to-noise ratio was below the required levels.

=== InGrid Based X-ray detector ===
The sole aim of this detector is to enhance the sensitivity of CAST to energy thresholds around 1 KeV range. This is an improved sensitive detector set up in 2014 behind the X-ray telescope, for the search of solar chameleons which have low threshold energies. The InGrid detector and its granular Timepix pad readout with low energy threshold of 0.1 KeV for photon detection hunts the solar chameleons in this range.
=== Relic Axion Dark Matter Exploratory Setup (RADES) ===
The RADES started searching for axion-like dark matter in 2018, and the first results from this detector were published in early 2021. Although no significant axion signal was detected above the noise background during the 2018 to 2021 period, RADES became the first detector to search for axions above formula_2. CAST helioscope (looks at sun) was made a haloscope (looks at galactic halo) in late 2017. RADES detector attached to this haloscope has a 1 m long alternating-irises stainless-steel cavity able to search for dark matter axions around formula_3. Further prospects of improving the detector system with enhancements such as superconductive cavities and ferro-magnetic tunings are being looked into.

=== KWISP detector ===
KWISP at CAST is designed to detect the coupling of solar chameleons with matter particles. It uses a very sensitive optomechanical force sensor, capable of detecting a displacement in a thin membrane caused by the mechanical effects from the solar chameleon interactions.

=== CAST-CAPP ===
This detector has a delicate tuning mechanism, made of 2 parallel sapphire plates and activated by a piezoelectric motor. The maximum tuning corresponds to axions masses between 21–23 μeV. CAST-CAPP detector is also sensitive to dark matter axion tidal or cosmological streams and to the theorized axion mini-clusters. A newer and better version of CAPP is being developed at CAPP, South Korea.

== Results ==
The CAST experiment began with the goal of devising new methods and implementing novel technologies for the detection of solar axions. Owing to the inter-disciplinary and interrelated field of axion studies, dark matter, dark energy, and axion-like exotic particles, the new collaborations at CAST have broadened their research into the wide field of astroparticle physics. Results from these different domains are described below.

=== Constraints on axions ===
During the initial years, axion detection was the primary goal of CAST. Although the CAST experiment did not yet observe axions directly, it has constraint the search parameters. Mass and the coupling constant of an axion are primary aspects of its detectability.  Over almost 20 years of the operation period, CAST has added very significant details and limitations to the properties of solar axions and axion-like particles. In the initial run period, the first three CAST detectors put an upper limit of formula_4 on formula_5 (parameter for axion-photon coupling) with a 95% confidence limit (CL) for axion mass- formula_6. For axion mass range between formula_7 and formula_8, RADES constrained the axion-photon coupling constant formula_9 with just about 5% error. The most recent results, in 2017 set an upper limit on formula_5 formula_11 (with 95% CL) for all axions with masses below 0.02 eV. CAST has thus improved the previous astrophysical limits and has probed numerous relevant axion models of sub-electron-volt mass.

=== Search for dark matter ===
CAST was able to constrain the axion-photon coupling constant from the very low up to the hot dark matter sector; and the current search range overlaps with the present cosmic hot dark matter bound which is axion mass, formula_12. The new detectors at CAST are also looking for proposed dark matter candidates such as the solar chameleons and pharaphotons as well as the relic axions from the Big bang and Inflation. In late 2017, the CAST helioscope which originally was searching for solar axion and ALPs, was converted into haloscope to hunt for the Dark Matter wind in milky way&#x27;s galactic halo while it crosses the Earth. These idea of streaming dark wind is thought to affect and cause the random and anisotropic orientation of solar flares, for which the CAST haloscope will serve as a testbed.

=== Search for dark energy ===
In the dark energy domain CAST is currently looking for signatures of a chameleon, which is hypothesized to be a particle produced when dark energy interacts with the photons. This area is currently in its beginning stages, wherein possible ways of dark energy particles coupling with normal matter are being theorized. Using the GridPix detector, the upper bound on the chameleon photon coupling constant- formula_13 was determined to be equal to formula_14 for formula_15 (chameleon matter coupling constant) in the range of 1 to formula_16. KWISP detector obtained an upper limit on the force acting on its detector membrane due to chameleons as formula_17 pNewton, which corresponds to a specific exclusion zone in formula_13-formula_15 plane and complements the results obtained by GridPix.

<doc id="1217131" wikidata="Q1784338" url="?curid=1217131" title="Spar torpedo">
<text>A spar torpedo is a weapon consisting of a bomb placed at the end of a long pole, or spar, and attached to a boat. The weapon is used by running the end of the spar into the enemy ship. Spar torpedoes were often equipped with a barbed spear at the end, so it would stick to wooden hulls. A fuse could then be used to detonate it.

==Invention==
Robert Fulton had written about submarine (i.e., subsurface) marine torpedoes in 1810, and experiments were conducted using spar torpedoes that year. Boats carrying spar torpedoes were used during the War of 1812.

E. C. Singer, a private engineer who worked on secret projects for the benefit of the Confederate States of America, constructed a spar torpedo during the American Civil War. His torpedo was detonated by means of a trigger mechanism adapted from a rifle lock (see flintlock mechanism for a similar device). The spring-loaded trigger was detonated by means of a long cord attached to the attacking vessel. The attacking vessel rammed its target, embedding the barbed torpedo in its hull, then backed off. When the attacker reached the limit of the trigger cord, the torpedo was detonated.

==Use==
Perhaps the most famous use of spar torpedoes during the U.S. Civil War was by the Confederate submarine &quot;H. L. Hunley&quot;, which managed to sink the Union screw sloop USS &quot;Housatonic&quot; on February 17, 1864, although the &quot;Hunley&quot; was lost. Spar torpedoes were also used by the &quot;David&quot;-class of semi-submersible attack boats. In April 1864, Confederate torpedo boat CSS &quot;Squib&quot; employed a spar torpedo against USS &quot;Minnesota&quot;. 

At night on October 27–28, 1864, Lieutenant Cushing employed a spar torpedo to sink the Confederate ironclad ram CSS &quot;Albemarle&quot;. The sinking of the &quot;Albemarle&quot; was the Union navy&#x27;s only successful sinking of a Confederate vessel by torpedo. Lieutenant Cushing employed a spar torpedo designed by John Lay.

The semi-submersible 1864 Union craft USS &quot;Spuyten Duyvil&quot; employed a spar torpedo, but not with a barbed attachment to the target. Owing to an innovative directable and extensible spar, this craft could release a slightly buoyant mine underneath the target, which would be exploded by the means described above. (This craft was not employed against Confederate targets, but was used to clear wreckage from rivers.)

Spar torpedoes were also used on small wooden launches in the late 19th century, although they were not very useful weapons. The locomotive torpedo (the contemporary term for the modern self-propelled torpedo) replaced the spar torpedo as a weapon for submarines and small boats in the 1870s.
Spar torpedoes were also used by Romanian forces during the country&#x27;s war of independence. On May 26, 1877, the craft &quot;Rândunica&quot; sank the Ottoman river monitor &quot;Seyfi&quot; on the Danube.

French admiral Courbet made good use of two spar torpedo boats at the Battle of Fuzhou on August 23, 1884, which sank the flagship of the Chinese Fujian Fleet - corvette &quot;Yangwu&quot; and a gunboat &quot;Fuxing&quot;. It showed that spar torpedoes can be effective against ships at anchor, not protected by torpedo nets and without a proper look-out. On February 14, 1885, Courbet also sank Chinese frigate &quot;Yuyuan&quot; in Battle of Shipu with two spar torpedo boats.

Spar torpedoes were superseded by the automotive torpedo.

<text>Ignazio Donati (c. 1570 – 21 January 1638) was an Italian composer of the early Baroque era. He was one of the pioneers of the style of the concertato motet.

==Biography==
Ignazio Donati was born in Casalmaggiore (now in the Province of Cremona). Little is known about his earliest years, but he must have had a thorough early musical training, and his succession of posts at various cathedrals in Italian towns is well documented: he served successively at Urbino, Pesaro, Fano, Ferrara, Casalmaggiore, Novara, and Lodi, eventually acquiring the prestigious post at Milan Cathedral in 1629, which he kept with one short break until his death.

Donati wrote &quot;sacred concertos&quot;, motets, masses and psalm settings. Most of Donati&#x27;s music is sacred, and his style tends towards the cheerful, the light, and the practical. He wrote motets using the new concertato style pioneered by the composers of the Venetian School, though he was not associated with Venice himself. Most of his music is for two to five voices with instrumental accompaniment including basso continuo, and some of his works—for example a book of psalm settings—exist in several settings for different types of performance, with different instrumental and vocal forces. Ignazio Donati wrote the &quot;Sacri concentus&quot; and published it in Venice in 1612; here he defined the &quot;cantar lontano&quot; vocal practice.

In some of his music he went even farther, and suggested multiple performance ideas—from singing only a very few parts, to using multiple choruses with instrumental doubling, based on the resources of the performing ensemble and the type of effect required by the performance occasion. This kind of practical advice is rarely found in the writings accompanying the music of the Venetian school composers, who had massive, virtuoso, well-paid ensembles at their disposal, but it would have been essential to the musical establishments at the small provincial towns in which Donati worked.

In addition to his concertato motets and other mixed instrumental-vocal music, he wrote some relatively conservative masses, which, however, are not in the polyphonic Palestrina style but find a middle-ground between the &quot;stile antico&quot; and the more modern harmonic practice.

<doc id="1217139" wikidata="Q656545" url="?curid=1217139" title="Reinsurance Treaty">
<text>The Reinsurance Treaty was a diplomatic agreement between the German Empire and the Russian Empire that was in effect from 1887 to 1890. The existence of the agreement was not known to the general public, and as such, was only known to a handful of officials in Berlin and St. Petersburg. The treaty played a critical role in German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck&#x27;s network of alliances and agreements, which aimed to keep the peace in Europe as well as maintaining Germany&#x27;s economic, diplomatic and political dominance. It helped calm tensions between both Russia and Germany.

The treaty provided that both parties would remain neutral if the other became involved in a war with a third great power, with the exception of if Germany attacked France or if Russia attacked Austria-Hungary. Germany made concessions to Russia by changing its stance on Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia (now part of southern Bulgaria), agreeing that they were in the Russian sphere of influence and agreeing to support Russian action to keep the Black Sea as its own preserve. After Bismarck lost power in 1890, his enemies in the Foreign Ministry convinced the Kaiser that the treaty was too much in Russia&#x27;s favor and should not be renewed. The cancellation, as with the treaty itself, was generally held from the public. Russia, however, had not wanted to terminate the alliance. Needing new allies, Russia opened negotiations with Germany&#x27;s enemy France. The resulting Franco-Russian Alliance of 1891–1892 to 1917 rapidly began to take shape. Historians consider the new alliance a major disaster for Germany and one of the long-term causes of the First World War.

==Background==
The Reinsurance Treaty originated after the German-Austrian-Russian &quot;Dreikaiserbund&quot; (League of the Three Emperors) had lapsed in 1887 due to competition between Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire for spheres of influence in the Balkans. In early 1887, a Russian diplomat went to Berlin to propose a treaty in which Russia would be a friendly neutral country during a war between Germany and France, and in return, Germany would recognize Russian dominance in Bulgaria and promise a friendly neutrality if Russia seized the Turkish Straits from the Ottoman Empire. Bismarck strongly supported the idea, but Alexander III rejected the plan until Foreign Minister Nikolay Girs convinced him that it would be best for Russia in the absence of French friendship. Bismarck refused Russia&#x27;s request for Germany to stay neutral if Russia went to war against Austria citing that Berlin was in the Triple Alliance with Vienna.

Bismarck had a long-term policy of preserving the peace in Europe, which was threatened by the growing competition between Russia and Austria–Hungary for dominance over the Balkans. He felt that an agreement with Russia was essential to prevent a Russian alliance with France, and he always had the policy of keeping France isolated diplomatically to avoid Germany from fighting a two-front war against both France and Russia. Bismarck risked the expansion of the Russian sphere of influence toward the Mediterranean and diplomatic tensions with Vienna.

The treaty signed by Bismarck and Russian Foreign Minister Nikolay Girs contained two separate agreements:
# Germany and Russia agreed to observe benevolent neutrality if either become involved in a war with a third country. If Germany attacked France or if Russia attacked Austria-Hungary, that provision would not apply. In those cases, the distinguished bilateral alliances could come into effect. The Reinsurance Treaty applied only if France or Austria–Hungary were the aggressors.
# Germany would declare neutrality if Russia intervened against the Ottoman control of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles.

==Non-renewal==
As part of Bismarck&#x27;s system of &quot;periphery diversion&quot;, the treaty was highly dependent on his prestige. After Kaiser Wilhelm II had removed Bismarck from office in 1890, Russia asked for a renewal of the treaty, but Germany refused. Bismarck&#x27;s successor, Leo von Caprivi, felt no need to mollify Russia. A main advocate of the non-renewal of the treaty was Count von Berchem, undersecretary at the Foreign Office. During the lead up to the non-renewal of the treaty, Count von Berchem created a memorandum describing why the treaty was unfavorable for Germany and introduced reasons as to why it should not be renewed. The memorandum was given to Chancellor von Caprivi on March 25 and was filed by the Chancellor on March 28 showing its influence over Chancellor von Caprivi. The German foreign policy establishment was unanimous in rejecting a renewal because the treaty contradicted so many other German positions with regard to Austria-Hungary, the United Kingdom, Romania and Italy. For example, the Reinsurance Treaty contradicted the Austro-Romanian Treaty of 1883, in which Germany and Austria-Hungary promised to protect Romania; Russia knew nothing of that treaty.

Kaiser Wilhelm II, who was still highly influential in foreign policy, believed that his personal friendship with Tsar Alexander III would suffice to ensure further genial diplomatic ties. His higher priority was to build better relationships with Britain. Anglo-Russian relations had long been strained by Russia&#x27;s quest to take control of the Turkish Straits, which link the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. Britain feared that Russian expansion to its south would threaten British colonial interests in the Middle East. In the creation of this treaty, Bismarck was aware of Russian desire to control Constantinople and wished to use to influence an Anglo-Russian conflict so that Germany may consolidate more power within Europe. The non-renewal of the treaty pushed Russia away from Germany&#x27;s alliance and created a need for Russia to have the military and economic security that came with such a strategic deal. France, desperate for an ally, offered financial help to rebuild the Russian economy and successfully developed the Franco-Russian Alliance in 1894, which ended French isolation. This was a policy that Bismarck utilized to his benefit as he desired to see France ostracized from the complex web of alliances within Europe. The dismissal of Bismarck, the erratic temper of Wilhelm II, and the uncertain policies of the men who succeeded Bismarck were joint causes of the growing international instability. The dismissal of Bismarck as chancellor as well as the non-renewal of the treaty represented a shift in foreign policy strategy for Germany. This is noteworthy because as stated by Peter R. Mansoor and William Murray, this non-renewal was an important feature of Wilhelmine Germany&#x27;s foreign policy that revealed simplistic thinking in comparison to the foreign policy of Bismarck when he was chancellor.

In 1896, the retired Bismarck caused a huge sensation by revealing the existence of the treaty to a German newspaper. He blamed his successor, Caprivi, as responsible for the non-renewal in 1890. Bismarck said that the failure of the treaty made it possible for France and Russia to draw together.

Most historians, according to Norman Rich, agree that the Reinsurance Treaty itself was not of great importance while it was in operation, but the failure to renew it marked the decisive turning point of Russia&#x27;s movement away from Germany and toward France; and so was one of the causes of the First World War, which broke out in 1914. Sidney Fay agrees that it was a turning point, but also argues that non-renewal was only one of several powerful factors pushing Russia and Germany apart. The German treaty with Britain in July 1890 made the Russians falsely suspect that Berlin was drawing closer to London. Pan-Slavism was growing in Russia, with a determination to dominate the Balkans. As a result, Russia and Austria-Hungary became increasingly alienated from each other, and Germany was forced to support its only true ally, Austria-Hungary. A third factor was the renewal of revanchism in France, which made the French much more eager to find an alliance with Russia, despite Russia&#x27;s long opposition to republicanism.

<doc id="1217146" wikidata="Q50764" url="?curid=1217146" title="Éric Rohmer">
<text>Jean Marie Maurice Schérer or Maurice Henri Joseph Schérer, known as Éric Rohmer (; 21 March 192011 January 2010), was a French film director, film critic, journalist, novelist, screenwriter, and teacher. Rohmer was the last of the post-World War II French New Wave directors to become established. He edited the influential film journal &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; from 1957 to 1963, while most of his colleagues—among them Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut—were making the transition from critics to filmmakers and gaining international attention.

Rohmer gained international acclaim around 1969 when his film &quot;My Night at Maud&#x27;s&quot; was nominated at the Academy Awards. He won the San Sebastián International Film Festival with &quot;Claire&#x27;s Knee&quot; in 1971 and the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival for &quot;The Green Ray&quot; in 1986. In 2001, Rohmer received the Venice Film Festival&#x27;s Career Golden Lion. After his death in 2010, his obituary in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called him &quot;the most durable filmmaker of the French New Wave&quot;, outlasting his peers and &quot;still making movies the public wanted to see&quot; late in his career.

==Early life==
Rohmer was born &quot;Jean-Marie Maurice Schérer&quot; (or &quot;Maurice Henri Joseph Schérer&quot;) in Nancy (also listed as Tulle), Meurthe-et-Moselle department, Lorraine, France, the son of Mathilde (née Bucher) and Lucien Schérer. Rohmer was a Catholic. He was secretive about his private life and often gave different dates of birth to reporters. He fashioned his pseudonym from the names of two famous artists: actor and director Erich von Stroheim and writer Sax Rohmer, author of the Fu Manchu series. Rohmer was educated in Paris and received an advanced degree in history, though he seemed equally interested and learned in literature, philosophy, and theology.

==Career as a journalist==
Rohmer first worked as a teacher in Clermont-Ferrand. In the mid-1940s he quit his teaching job and moved to Paris, where he worked as a freelance journalist. In 1946 he published a novel, &quot;Elisabeth&quot; (AKA &quot;Les Vacances&quot;) under the pen name Gilbert Cordier. While living in Paris, Rohmer first began to attend screenings at Henri Langlois&#x27;s , where he first met and befriended Jean-Luc Godard, François Truffaut, Claude Chabrol, Jacques Rivette and other members of the French New Wave. Rohmer had never been very interested in film, preferring literature, but soon became an intense lover of films and about 1949 switched from journalism to film criticism. He wrote film reviews for such publications as &quot;Révue du Cinéma&quot;, &quot;Arts&quot;, &quot;Temps Modernes&quot; and &quot;La Parisienne&quot;.

In 1950, he co-founded the film magazine &quot;La Gazette du Cinéma&quot; with Rivette and Godard, but it was short-lived. In 1951 Rohmer joined the staff of André Bazin&#x27;s newly founded film magazine &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;, of which he became the editor in 1956. There, Rohmer established himself as a critic with a distinctive voice; fellow &quot;Cahiers&quot; contributor and French New Wave filmmaker Luc Moullet later remarked that, unlike the more aggressive and personal writings of younger critics like Truffaut and Godard, Rohmer favored a rhetorical style that made extensive use of questions and rarely used the first person singular. Rohmer was known as more politically conservative than most of the &quot;Cahiers&quot; staff, and his opinions were highly influential on the magazine&#x27;s direction while he was editor. Rohmer first published articles under his real name but began using &quot;Éric Rohmer&quot; in 1955 so that his family would not find out that he was involved in the film world, as they would have disapproved.

Rohmer&#x27;s best-known article was &quot;Le Celluloïd et le marbre&quot; (&quot;Celluloid and Marble&quot;, 1955), which examines the relationship between film and other arts. In the article, Rohmer writes that in an age of cultural self-consciousness, film is &quot;the last refuge of poetry&quot; and the only contemporary art form from which metaphor can still spring naturally and spontaneously. In 1957, Rohmer and Claude Chabrol wrote &quot;Hitchcock&quot; (Paris: Éditions Universitaires, 1957), the earliest book-length study of Alfred Hitchcock. It focuses on Hitchcock&#x27;s Catholic background and has been called &quot;one of the most influential film books since the Second World War, casting new light on a filmmaker hitherto considered a mere entertainer&quot;. &quot;Hitchcock&quot; helped establish the auteur theory as a critical method and contributed to the reevaluation of the American cinema that was central to that method. By 1963, Rohmer was becoming more at odds with some of the more radical left-wing critics at &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;. He continued to admire U.S. films while many of the other left-wing critics had rejected them and were championing &quot;cinéma vérité&quot; and Marxist film criticism. Rohmer resigned that year and was succeeded by Rivette.

==Film career==
===1950–1962: Shorts and early film career===
In 1950 Rohmer made his first 16mm short film, &quot;Journal d&#x27;un scélérat&quot;. The film starred writer Paul Gégauff and was made with a borrowed camera. By 1951 Rohmer had a bigger budget provided by friends and shot the short film &quot;Présentation ou Charlotte et son steak&quot;. The 12-minute film was co-written by and starred Jean-Luc Godard. The film was not completed until 1961. In 1952 Rohmer began collaborating with Pierre Guilbaud on a one-hour short feature, &quot;Les Petites Filles modèles&quot;, but the film was never finished. In 1954 Rohmer made and acted in &quot;Bérénice&quot;, a 15-minute short based on a story by Edgar Allan Poe. In 1956 Rohmer directed, wrote, edited and starred in &quot;La Sonate à Kreutzer&quot;, a 50-minute film produced by Godard. In 1958 Rohmer made &quot;Véronique et son cancre&quot;, a 20-minute short produced by Chabrol.

Chabrol&#x27;s company AJYM produced Rohmer&#x27;s feature directorial debut, &quot;The Sign of Leo&quot; (&quot;Le Signe du lion&quot;) in 1959. In the film an American composer spends the month of August waiting for his inheritance while all his friends are on vacation and gradually becomes impoverished. It included music by Louis Saguer. &quot;The Sign of Leo&quot; was later recut and rescored by distributors when Chabrol was forced to sell his production company, and Rohmer disowned the recut version. In 1962 Rohmer and Barbet Schroeder co-founded the production company Les Films du Losange (they were later joined by Pierre Coltrell in the late 1960s). Les Films du Losange produced all of Rohmer&#x27;s work (except his last three features produced by La Compagnie Eric Rohmer).

===1962–1972: &quot;Six Moral Tales&quot; and television work===
Rohmer&#x27;s career began to gain momentum with his &quot;Six Moral Tales&quot; (&quot;Six contes moraux&quot;). Each of the films in the cycle follows the same story, inspired by F. W. Murnau&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1927): a man, married or otherwise committed to a woman, is tempted by a second woman but eventually returns to the first.

For Rohmer, these stories&#x27; characters &quot;like to bring their motives, the reasons for their actions, into the open, they try to analyze, they are not people who act without thinking about what they are doing. What matters is what they &quot;think&quot; about their behavior, rather than their behavior itself.&quot; The French word &quot;moraliste&quot; does not translate directly to the English &quot;moralist&quot; and has more to do with what someone thinks and feels. Rohmer cited the works of Blaise Pascal, Jean de La Bruyère, François de La Rochefoucauld and Stendhal as inspirations for the series. He clarified, &quot;a &quot;moraliste&quot; is someone who is interested in the description of what goes on inside man. He&#x27;s concerned with states of mind and feelings.&quot; Regarding the repetition of a single storyline, he explained that it would allow him to explore six variations of the same theme. Plus, he stated, &quot;I was determined to be inflexible and intractable, because if you persist in an idea it seems to me that in the end you do secure a following.&quot;

The first &quot;Moral Tale&quot; was &quot;The Bakery Girl of Monceau&quot; (1963). This 26-minute film portrays a young man, a college student, who sees a young woman in the street and spends days obsessively searching for her. He meets a second woman who works in a bakery and begins to flirt with her, but abandons her when he finally finds the first woman. Schroder starred as the young man and Bertrand Tavernier was the narrator. The second &quot;Moral Tale&quot; was &quot;Suzanne&#x27;s Career&quot; (1963). This 60-minute film portrays a young student who is rejected by one woman and begins a romantic relationship with a second. The first and second &quot;Moral Tales&quot; were never theatrically released and Rohmer was disappointed by their poor technical quality. They were not well known until after the release of the other four.

In 1963 Les Films du Losange produced the New Wave omnibus film &quot;Six in Paris&quot;, of which Rohmer&#x27;s short &quot;Place de l&#x27;Etoile&quot; was the centerpiece. After being driven out of his editor position at &quot;Cahiers&quot;, Rohmer began making short documentaries for French television. Between 1964 and 1966 Rohmer made 14 shorts for television through the Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française (ORTF) and Télévision Scolaire. These included episodes of &quot;Filmmakers of Our Time&quot; on Louis Lumiere and Carl Theodor Dreyer, educational films on Blaise Pascal and Stéphane Mallarmé, and documentaries on the Percival legend, the Industrial Revolution and female students in Paris. Rohmer later said that television taught him how to make &quot;readable images&quot;. He later said, &quot;When you show a film on TV, the framing goes to pieces, straight lines are warped...the way people stand and walk and move, the whole physical dimension...all this is lost. Personally I don&#x27;t feel that TV is an intimate medium.&quot; In 1964 Rohmer made the 13-minute short film &quot;Nadja à Paris&quot; with cinematographer Nestor Almendros.

Rohmer and Schroder then sold the rights of two of their short films to French television in order to raise $60,000 to produce the feature film &quot;La Collectionneuse&quot; in 1967, the third &quot;Moral Tale&quot;. The film&#x27;s budget went only to film stock and renting a house in St. Tropez as a set. Rohmer described it as a film about &quot;l&#x27;amour par désoeuvrement&quot; (&quot;love from idleness&quot;). &quot;La Collectionneuse&quot; won the Jury Grand Prix at the 17th Berlin International Film Festival and was praised by French film critics, though US film critics called it &quot;boring&quot;.

The fourth &quot;Moral Tale&quot; was &quot;My Night at Maud&#x27;s&quot; in 1969. The film was made with funds raised by Truffaut, who liked the script, and was initially intended to be the third &quot;Moral Tale&quot;. But because the film takes place on Christmas Eve, Rohmer wanted to shoot the film in December. Actor Jean-Louis Trintignant was not available so filming was delayed for a year. The film centers on Pascal&#x27;s Wager and stars Trintignant, Françoise Fabian, Marie-Christine Barrault and Antoine Vitez. &quot;My Night at Maud&#x27;s&quot; was Rohmer&#x27;s first successful film both commercially and critically. It was screened and highly praised at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival and later won the Prix Max Ophüls. It was released in the US and praised by critics there as well. It eventually received Oscar nominations for Best Original Screenplay and Best Foreign Film. James Monaco wrote, &quot;Here, for the first time the focus is clearly set on the ethical and existential question of choice. If it isn&#x27;t clear within &quot;Maud&quot; who actually is making the wager and whether or not they win or lose, that only enlarges the idea of &quot;le pari&quot; (&quot;the bet&quot;) into the encompassing metaphor that Rohmer wants for the entire series.&quot;

The fifth &quot;Moral Tale&quot; was &quot;Le genou de Claire&quot; (&quot;Claire&#x27;s Knee&quot;, 1970). It won the Grand Prix at the San Sebastián International Film Festival, the Prix Louis Delluc and the Prix Méliès, and was a huge international success. Vincent Canby called it &quot;something close to a perfect film.&quot; It was Rohmer&#x27;s second film in color. Rohmer said, &quot;the presence of the lake and the mountains is stronger in color than in black and white. It is a film I couldn&#x27;t imagine in black and white. The color green seems to me essential in that film...This film would have no value to me in black and white.&quot;

The sixth and final &quot;Moral Tale&quot; was 1972&#x27;s &quot;Love in the Afternoon&quot; (released as &quot;Chloe in the Afternoon&quot; in the US). Molly Haskell criticized the film for betraying the rest of the series by making a moral judgment of the main character and approving of his decision in the film.

Overall, Rohmer said he wanted the &quot;Six Moral Tales&quot; &quot;to portray in film what seemed most alien to the medium, to express feelings buried deep in our consciousness. That&#x27;s why they have to be narrated in the first person singular...The protagonist discusses himself and judges his actions. I film the process.&quot;

===1972–1987: Adaptations and &quot;Comedies and Proverbs&quot;===
Following the &quot;Moral Tales&quot; Rohmer wanted to make a less personal film and adapted a novella by Heinrich von Kleist, &quot;La Marquise d&#x27;O...&quot; in 1976. It was one of Rohmer&#x27;s most critically acclaimed films, with many critics ranking it with &quot;My Night at Maud&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Claire&#x27;s Knee&quot;. Rohmer stated that &quot;It wasn&#x27;t simply the action I was drawn to, but the text itself. I didn&#x27;t want to translate it into images, or make a filmed equivalent. I wanted to use the text as if Kleist himself had put it directly on the screen, as if he were making a movie ... Kleist didn&#x27;t copy me and I didn&#x27;t copy him, but obviously there was an affinity.&quot;

In 1978 Rohmer made the Holy Grail legend film &quot;Perceval le Gallois&quot;, based on a 12th-century manuscript by Chrétien de Troyes. The film received mostly poor critical reviews. Tom Milne said that the film was &quot;almost universally greeted as a disappointment, at best a whimsical exercise in the faux-naif in its attempt to capture the poetic simplicity of medieval faith, at worse an anticlimatic blunder&quot; and that it was &quot;rather like watching the animation of a medieval manuscript, with the text gravely read aloud while the images — cramped and crowded, coloured with jewelled brilliance, delighting the eye with bizarre perspectives — magnificently play the role traditionally assigned to marginal illuminations.&quot; In 1980 Rohmer made a film for television of his stage production of Kleist&#x27;s play &quot;Catherine de Heilbronn&quot;, another work with a medieval setting.

Later in 1980 Rohmer embarked on a second series of films: the &quot;Comedies and Proverbs&quot; (&quot;Comédies et Proverbes&quot;), where each film was based on a proverb. The first &quot;Comedy and proverb&quot; was &quot;The Aviator&#x27;s Wife&quot;, which was based on an idea that Rohmer had had since the mid-1940s. This was followed in 1981 with &quot;Le Beau Mariage&quot; (&quot;A Perfect Marriage&quot;), the second &quot;Comedy and Proverb&quot;. Rohmer stated that &quot;what interests me is to show how someone&#x27;s imagination works. The fact that obsession can replace reality.&quot; In his review of the film, film critic Claude Baignères said that &quot;Eric Rohmer is a virtuoso of the pen sketch...[He had not been] at ease with the paint tubes that Persival required, [but in this film he created] a tiny figurine whose every feature, every curl, every tone is aimed at revealing to us a state of soul and of heart.&quot; Raphael Bassan said that &quot;the filmmaker fails to achieve in these dialogues the flexibility, the textual freedom of &quot;The Aviator&#x27;s Wife&quot;. &quot;A Perfect Marriage&quot; is only a variation on the spiritual states of the petty bourgeoise who go on and on forever about the legitimacy of certain institutions or beliefs confronted by problems of the emotions. Quite simply, this is a minor variation on this central Rohmerian theme.&quot;

The third &quot;Comedy and proverb&quot; was &quot;Pauline at the Beach&quot; in 1983. It won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 33rd Berlin International Film Festival. It was based on an idea that Rohmer had in the 1950s, originally intended for Brigitte Bardot. Rohmer often made films that he had been working on for many years and stated &quot;I can&#x27;t say &#x27;I make one film, then after that film I look for a subject and write on that subject...then I shoot.&#x27; Not at all...these are films that are drawn from one evolving mass, films that have been in my head for a long time and that I think about simultaneously.&quot;

The fourth &quot;Comedy and Proverb&quot; was &quot;Full Moon in Paris&quot; in 1984. The film&#x27;s proverb was invented by Rohmer himself: &quot;The one who has two wives loses his soul, the one who has two houses loses his mind.&quot; The film&#x27;s cinematographer Renato Berta called it &quot;one of the most luxurious films ever made&quot; because of the high amount of preparation put into it. The film began with Rohmer and the actors discussing their roles and reading from the film&#x27;s scenario while tape recording the rehearsals. Rohmer then re-wrote the script based on these sessions and shot the film on Super 8mm as a dress rehearsal. When the film was finally shot, Rohmer often used between two and three takes for each shot, and sometimes only one take. Alain Bergala and Alain Philippon have stated that &quot;all the art of Eric Rohmer consists of creating on the set a veritable osmosis among himself, the actors and the technicians.&quot; Rohmer even encouraged actress Pascale Ogier to design sets for the film since her character is an interior decorator. Ogier later won the Best Actress award at the Venice Film Festival. Alain Philippon called the film &quot;one of the most accomplished films that Rohmer has given us...and that if the film moves it is because of its own risk-taking.&quot;

The fifth &quot;Comedy and Proverb&quot; was &quot;The Green Ray&quot; in 1986. Rohmer explained that &quot;I was struck by the naturalness of television interviews. You can say that here, nature is perfect. If you look for it, you find it because people forget the cameras.&quot; As was becoming his custom in pre-production, Rohmer gathered his cast together to discuss the project and their characters, but then allowed each actor to invent their own dialogue. Rohmer stated that lead actress Marie Rivière &quot;is the one who called the shots, not only by what she said, but by the way she&#x27;d speak, the way she&#x27;d question people, and also by the questions her character evoked from the others.&quot; The film was shot chronologically and in 16mm so as to be &quot;as inconspicuous as possible, to have Delphine blend into the crowd as a way, ultimately, of accentuating her isolation.&quot; Rohmer also instructed his cinematographer Sophie Maintigneux to keep technical aspects of the shoot to a minimum so as to not interrupt or distract the actors. The film&#x27;s only major expense was a trip to the Canary Islands in order to film the green rays there. Rohmer chose to première the film on Canal Plus TV, a pay-TV station that paid $130,000 for the film, which was only one fifth of its budget. Rohmer stated that &quot;Cinema here will survive only because of television. Without such an alliance we won&#x27;t be able to afford French films.&quot; The experiment paid off when the film was a theatrical hit after being released three days after its initial broadcast. It won the Golden Lion and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1986 Venice Film Festival. It was mostly praised by film critics, although Alain Robbe-Grillet wrote an unfavorable review and stated &quot;I didn&#x27;t like it very much.&quot;

The Sixth &quot;Comedy and Proverb&quot; was &quot;Boyfriends and Girlfriends&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Ami de mon amie&quot;) in 1987.

===1987–2009: &quot;Tales of the Four Seasons&quot; and later film career===
He followed these with a third series in the 1990s: &quot;Tales of the Four Seasons&quot; (&quot;Contes des quatre saisons&quot;). &quot;Conte d&#x27;automne&quot; or &quot;Autumn Tale&quot; was a critically acclaimed release in 1999 when Rohmer was 79. The previous titles of the series were &quot;A Tale of Springtime&quot; (1990), &quot;A Tale of Winter&quot; (1992), and &quot;A Summer&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1996).

Beginning in the 2000s, Rohmer, in his eighties, returned to period drama with &quot;The Lady and the Duke&quot; and &quot;Triple Agent&quot;. &quot;The Lady and the Duke&quot; caused considerable controversy in France, where its negative portrayal of the French Revolution led some critics to label it monarchist propaganda. Its innovative cinematic style and strong acting performances led it to be well received elsewhere.

In 2001, his life&#x27;s work was recognised when he received the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.

In 2007, Rohmer&#x27;s final film, &quot;The Romance of Astrea and Celadon&quot;, was shown during the Venice Film Festival, at which he spoke of retiring.

==Style==
Rohmer&#x27;s films concentrate on intelligent, articulate protagonists who frequently fail to own up to their desires. The contrast between what they say and what they do fuels much of the drama in his films. Gerard Legrand once said that &quot;he is one of the rare filmmakers who is constantly inviting you to be intelligent, indeed, more intelligent than his (likable) characters.&quot; Rohmer considered filmmaking to be &quot;closer to the novel—to a certain classical style of novel which the cinema is now taking over—than the other forms of entertainment, like the theater.&quot;

Many of Rohmer&#x27;s films have a circular structure, with the main part consisting of a digression that will &quot;seem to promise escape from a trap which the protagonist feels closing around him or her, but will come to be seen rather as itself a trap from which the protagonist must escape&quot;. This is most easily observable in films such as &quot;Pauline at the Beach&quot; and &quot;A Summer&#x27;s Tale&quot;, which begin with their protagonists arriving and end with their protagonists leaving in the same manner in which they arrived.

Rohmer saw the full-face closeup as a device that does not reflect how we see each other and avoided its use. He avoids extradiegetic music (not coming from onscreen sound sources), seeing it as a violation of the fourth wall. He has on occasion departed from the rule by inserting soundtrack music in places in &quot;The Green Ray&quot; (1986) (released as &quot;Summer&quot; in the United States). Rohmer also tends to spend considerable time in his films showing his characters going from place to place, walking, driving, bicycling or commuting on a train, engaging the viewer in the idea that part of the day of each individual involves quotidian travel. This was most evident in (1982), which had the female protagonist constantly traveling, particularly between Paris and Le Mans.

Rohmer typically populates his films with people in their twenties and the settings are often on pleasant beaches and popular resorts, notably in &quot;La Collectionneuse&quot; (1967), &quot;Pauline at the Beach&quot; (1983), &quot;The Green Ray&quot; (1986) and &quot;A Summer&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1996). These films are immersed in an environment of bright sunlight, blue skies, green grass, sandy beaches, and clear water. He explained that &quot;people sometimes ask me why most of the main characters in my films are young. I don&#x27;t feel at ease with older people ... I can&#x27;t get people older than forty to talk convincingly.&quot;

Half a dozen of Rohmer&#x27;s films are set in the summertime, which he depicts as a time of beauty and leisure but also of &quot;stagnation and aimlessness&quot;. He does this through cinematography and sound design, but primarily through presenting &quot;reflective characters with too much time on their hands and too many thoughts in their heads&quot;. Rohmer said he wanted to look at &quot;thoughts rather than actions&quot;, dealing &quot;less with what people do than what is going on in their minds while they are doing it.&quot; Given Rohmer&#x27;s professed interest in the anticipation rather than the climax in his tales, the summertime provides his characters with the time and space to show their self-consciousness and anxiety, rather than the solitude and relaxation they desire. 

Rohmer preferred to use non-professional actors in his films. He usually held a large number of rehearsals before shooting and would shoot his films very quickly. He spent little time editing his films. He usually shot his films chronologically, and often shot scenes during the time of day in which they took place. He explained that &quot;my films are based on meteorology. If I didn&#x27;t call the weather service everyday, I couldn&#x27;t make my films because they&#x27;re shot according to the weather outside. My films are slaves to weather.&quot;

Similarly, Rohmer&#x27;s films all have a strong sense of place. Whether shot in Paris, Clermont-Ferrand, or elsewhere, his films clearly show where they are and how the characters are part of that place. Characters travel or walk past signposts or monuments, or converse about these places. The locations in which the characters exist are as important an element in his films as what his characters are saying and doing. For this reason, Rohmer has been called a &quot;poet of place&quot;. 

The director&#x27;s characters engage in long conversations—mostly talking about man–woman relationships but also on mundane issues like trying to find a vacation spot. There are also occasional digressions by the characters on literature and philosophy as most of Rohmer&#x27;s characters are middle class and university educated.

&quot;A Summer&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1996) has most of the elements of a typical Rohmer film: no soundtrack music, no close-ups, a seaside resort, long conversations between beautiful young people (who are middle class and educated) and discussions involving the characters&#x27; interests from songwriting to ethnology.

Beginning in the late 1970s during the production of &quot;Perceval le Gallois&quot; Rohmer began to reduce the number of crew members on his films. He first dispensed with the script supervisor, then (controversially) cut out the assistant director, then all other assistants and technical managers until, by the time he shot &quot;The Green Ray&quot; in 1986, his crew consisted only of a camera operator and a sound engineer. Rohmer stated that &quot;I even wonder if I could work in the usual conditions of filmmaking.&quot;

His style was famously criticised by Gene Hackman&#x27;s character in the 1975 film &quot;Night Moves&quot; who describes viewing Rohmer&#x27;s films as &quot;kind of like watching paint dry&quot;.

Rohmer was a highly literary man. His films frequently refer to ideas and themes in plays and novels, such as references to Jules Verne (in &quot;The Green Ray&quot;), William Shakespeare (in &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;) and Pascal&#x27;s wager (in &quot;Ma nuit chez Maud&quot;).

==Personal life and death==
Rohmer&#x27;s brother was the philosopher René Schérer. In 1957, Rohmer married Thérèse Barbet. The couple had two sons. The elder, René Monzat (b. 1958), is an author and investigative journalist at, most recently, &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;Mediapart&quot;. His work focuses on the French far-right.

Rohmer was a devout Catholic, monarchist, and &quot;ecological zealot&quot;. For years he had no telephone and refused to get into cars, which he called &quot;immoral pollutors&quot;. For many years he was known to jog two miles to his office every morning. He was well known for his need for personal privacy and sometimes wore disguises, such as a false moustache at the New York premiere of one of his films. Rohmer&#x27;s mother died without ever knowing that her son was a famous film director.

Rohmer died on the morning of 11 January 2010 at the age of 89 after a series of strokes. He had been admitted to hospital the previous week.

The former Culture Minister Jack Lang called Rohmer &quot;one of the masters of French cinema&quot;. Director Thierry Fremaux called his work &quot;unique&quot;.

Rohmer&#x27;s grave is in district 13 of Montparnasse Cemetery.

At the 2010 César Awards, actor Fabrice Luchini presented a special tribute to Rohmer:
I&#x27;m going to read a remarkable text written by Jacques Fieschi, writer, director, creator of &quot;the cinematographe&quot;, challenger of &quot;Les cahiers du cinéma&quot;, which recently published a special edition on Eric Rohmer. Truffaut once said he was one of the greatest directors of the 20th century, Godard was his brother, Chabrol admired him, Wenders couldn&#x27;t stop taking photos of him. Rohmer is a tremendous international star. The one and only French director who was in coherence with the money spent on his films and the money that his films made. I remember a phrase by Daniel Toscan Du Plantier the day &quot;Les Visiteurs&quot; opened, which eventually sold 15 million tickets: &quot;Yes but there is this incredible film called &quot;L&#x27;arbre, le maire et la médiathèque&quot; that sold 100,000 tickets, which may sound ridiculous in comparison, but no, because but it was only playing in one theater for an entire year.&quot; A happy time for cinema when this kind of thing could happen. Rohmer. Here is a tribute from Jacques Fieschi: &quot;We are all connected with the cinema, at least for a short time. The cinema has its economical laws, its artistic laws, a craft that once in a while rewards us or forgets us. Éric Rohmer seems to have escaped from this reality by inventing his own laws, his own rules of the game. One could say his own economy of the cinema that served his own purpose, which could skip the others, or to be more accurate that couldn&#x27;t skip the audience with its originality. He had a very unique point of view on the different levels of language and on desire that is at work in the heart of each and every human being, on youth, on seasons, on literature, of course, and one could say on history. Éric Rohmer, this sensual intellectual, with his silhouette of a teacher and a walker. As an outsider he made luminous and candid films in which he deliberately forgot his perfect knowledge of the cinema in a very direct link with the beauty of the world.&quot; The text was by Jacques Fieschi and it was a tribute to Éric Rohmer. Thank you.

On 8 February 2010, the Cinémathèque Française held a special tribute to Rohmer that included a screening of &quot;Claire&#x27;s Knee&quot; and a short video tribute to Rohmer by Jean-Luc Godard.

<text>Haeju () is a city located in South Hwanghae Province near Haeju Bay in North Korea. It is the administrative centre of South Hwanghae Province. As of 2008, the population of the city is estimated to be 273,300. At the beginning of the 20th century, it became a strategic port in Sino-Korean trade. Haeju has chemical-related enterprises and a cement factory.

==History==
The area around Haeju is known to have been inhabited since the Neolithic period, as shellmounds, pottery, and stone tools have been found at Ryongdangp&#x27;o. During the early Three kingdoms period, it was briefly governed by a small chieftain, when it was known as &quot;Naemihol&quot; (). In 757, however, it was conquered by the Goguryeo kingdom, who later lost it to Silla. It was under the Goryeo dynasty&#x27;s King T&#x27;aejo that it received its current name.

Sohyon Academy (소현서원) was a Confucian academy founded near Haeju by the famous Joseon dynasty scholar Yi I (1536–84) after his retirement. It is situated in Unbyong Valley, a part of Soktamgugok (Nine valleys of pools and rocks).

According to the North Korean government, their southward offfensive on the first day of the Korean War on 25 June 1950 was a response to a two-day long bombing by the South Koreans and their surprise attacks on Haeju and other places. Early in the morning of 25 June, before the dawn counterattack in the North Korean account, the South Korean Office of Public Information announced that the Southern forces had captured Haeju. The South Korean government later denied capturing the town and blamed the report on an exaggerating officer. Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union proposed that North Korea would be invited to the UN Security Council to present its side of the story. Both proposals were voted down.

==Geography==
Haeju City is located on the westernmost edge of the Korean Peninsula, 60 km north of the Military Demarcation Line and 100 km south of Pyongyang. The city, being not very mountainous, is composed mostly of plains. All the mountains located within the city are under 1,000 m in elevation.

=== Mountains ===
*Mountain Suyang, 946 m.
*Mountain Jangdae, 686 m.
*Nam Hill, 122 m.

== Climate ==
Haeju has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dwa&quot;), with cold, dry winters and hot, humid summers.
==Administrative divisions==
Haeju is divided into several urban neighborhoods (&quot;dong&quot;) and several rural villages (&quot;ri&quot;).
==Culture and travel==

Famous tourist attractions in the city center include Puyong Pavilion, the Haeju Dharani Monument, the Haeju Sokbinggo, and several trees classified as living monuments. Farther out, scenic spots include Suyangsan Falls, the Sokdamgugok scenic area, Suyangsan Fortress and the Sohyon Academy.

==Economy==
Haeju Special Economic Zone was announced in the Second Inter-Korean summit meeting between the South Korean president Roh Moo-Hyun and the North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-Il. It was to be a Special Economic Zone centered on the Haeju port. The zone would have consisted of 16.5 km2 of development, and also the expansion of the Haeju port. This project was estimated to cost over US$4.5 billion.

This economic agreement between South Korea and North Korea would have allowed trading across the Northern Limit Line between the ports of Incheon and Haeju, only 110 km apart. Recent military skirmishes make any revival of this deal unlikely for the time being.

==Transportation==
Haeju has a military and civilian dual purposes air station (HAE), with a 12/30 runway (Haeju Airport). Haeju also has one of the major economic and military ports in North Korea. It is connected to Sariwŏn via the Hwanghae Ch&#x27;ŏngnyŏn Line of the Korean State Railway.

==Education==
Haeju is home to Haeju University of Education, Haeju College of Art, and Kim Je Won Haeju University of Agriculture.
Sohyon Academy (소현서원) was a Confucian academy founded by the famous scholar Yi Yulgok (1536–84). It is situated in the Unbyong Valley west of Haeju.

==Media==
The Korean Central Broadcasting Station airs on AM 1080 kHz using a 1.5-megawatt mediumwave transmitter.

<text>Diné College is a public tribal land-grant college based in Tsaile, Arizona, serving the Navajo Nation. It offers associate degrees, bachelor&#x27;s degrees, academic certificates, and one master&#x27;s degree.

== History ==
Diné College opened in 1968 as the Navajo Community College, the first college established by Native Americans for Native Americans. The college was chartered by the Navajo Nation in 1968. The Navajo Tribal Council appointed Guy Gorman, Yazzie Begay, Chester Yellowhair, Carl Todacheene, Wilson Skeet, Howard Gorman, Allen Yazzie, and Dillon Platero to be the first to serve on the college&#x27;s Board of Regents. Robert Roessel served as the college&#x27;s first president.

The college was originally located at the site of the Rough Rock Community School in Rough Rock on a temporary basis until a permanent site could be chosen and constructed. The Board of Regents selected three possible sites for the college, namely the Tsaile–Wheatfields area, Many Farms, and Ganado. After a Board-commissioned survey of possible sites for the college, the Tsaile–Wheatfields area was recommended because it had plenty of water available and has scenic forests and lakes. After the Board was guaranteed 1,000 acres for the campus, a residential area, and a shopping area, the Board officially chose the Tsaile–Wheatfields area in October 1968. The Board asked people to send in designs for the college&#x27;s seal, and it chose the William Morgan&#x27;s design of an arrowhead encircled by a rainbow god.

On January 20, 1968, the college officially opened with 40 faculty members. There were 340 students enrolled during its first semester, which was the limit of its capacity. More than 3,000 other applicants were turned away due to a lack of space. The college added 23 evening classes because there was a higher demand for evening classes than daytime classes.

By 1973, 3,421 students had enrolled at Navaho Community College, but only 46 had graduated with associate degrees during that time. There was little for the students to do outside of classes, and excessive drinking became a problem for some.

In October 1973, following construction delays, students began taking classes at the college&#x27;s permanent campus in Tsaile. The campus was officially dedicated on May 14, 1974. Most campus buildings were built in octagonal shapes, similar to the eight-sided traditional Navajo hogan. The campus cost $12million to build. Some classes were taught in Shiprock and Fort Defiance.

In August 1992, Tommy Lewis became president. During his tenure, the college&#x27;s funding from the Bureau of Indian Affairs increased to almost $7.3million in 2000. The Navajo Language and Culture Curriculum became widely popular at the Tsaile campus after the program saw increases in class enrollment, thus allowing the Board of Regents to implement the program throughout the institution. In 1994, the college was designated a land-grant college alongside 31 other tribal colleges.

During the Summer of 1997, the administration changed the name of the college from Navajo Community College to Diné College in order to better to represent the school&#x27;s function as an institution of learning for the Diné/Navajo people.

In 1998, Diné College bestowed its first bachelor&#x27;s degrees under the Diné Teacher Education Program, accredited through a partnership with Arizona State University.

In 1998, the Diné College Library was rededicated as the Kinyaa&#x27;áanii Charlie Benally Memorial Library.

On May 21, 2011, the women&#x27;s archery team made history by winning the United States college national championship in compound bow. This is believed to be the first time a tribal college team has won a top-tier intercollegiate national championship event in any sport.

In 2019, the Chicago-based Higher Learning Commission (HLC) approved Diné College’s four-year institution status and two additional emphasis options within the BA of Fine Arts degree: silversmithing and weaving. 

== Academics ==
Diné College offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees, associate degrees,certificate programs, and one master&#x27;s degree.

The college&#x27;s Center for Diné Studies &quot;applies Navajo principles to advance quality student learning through (Thinking), (Planning), (Living) and (Assurance) in study of the Navajo language, history, and culture in preparation for further studies and employment in a multi-cultural and technological world.&quot;

The college also hosts the Uranium Education Program on its Shiprock campus. It is an empowerment program for the Navajo centering on the study of radiation and environmental health issues arising from the aftermath of uranium mining/milling operations on the Navajo Nation, as well as other serious environmental issues.

==Campuses==

The main campus of Diné College is in Tsaile, a census-designated place in unincorporated Apache County, Arizona. There are also five branches of Diné College: two in Apache County, Arizona (Chinle and Window Rock), one in Coconino County, Arizona (Tuba City), one in McKinley County, New Mexico (Crownpoint) and one in San Juan County, New Mexico (Shiprock). Diné College also has two micro-sites in Aneth, Utah, and Newcomb, New Mexico.

The main Tsaile campus includes eight fifteen-room dormitories housing about 150 students: each octagonally shaped unit has a fireplace in the center, and is described by the college as a &quot;hooghan away from hogan&quot;—a reference to the traditional Navajo &quot;hogan&quot; dwelling.

Hogan Faculty Housing is also on campus. Residents of family housing and faculty housing are zoned to the Chinle Unified School District. Tsaile Elementary School is in proximity to the university. All Chinle USD residents are assigned to Chinle High School.

==Governance==
The college is directed by an eight-member Board of Regents confirmed by the Government Services committee of the Navajo Nation Council. The name Diné comes from the traditional name for the Navajo, meaning &quot;the people.&quot;

* Nicco Montaño, professional Mixed Martial Artist, inaugural and current UFC Women&#x27;s Flyweight Champion, first UFC Champion of Navajo descent

<doc id="1217160" wikidata="Q16821514" url="?curid=1217160" title="Prompt criticality">
<text>In nuclear engineering, prompt criticality describes a nuclear fission event in which criticality (the threshold for an exponentially growing nuclear fission chain reaction) is achieved with prompt neutrons alone and does not rely on delayed neutrons. As a result, prompt supercriticality causes a much more rapid growth in the rate of energy release than other forms of criticality. Nuclear weapons are based on prompt criticality, while nuclear reactors rely on delayed neutrons or external neutrons to achieve criticality.

== Criticality ==
An assembly is critical if each fission event causes, on average, exactly one additional such event in a continual chain. Such a chain is a self-sustaining fission chain reaction. When a uranium-235 (U-235) atom undergoes nuclear fission, it typically releases between one and seven neutrons (with an average of 2.4). In this situation, an assembly is critical if every released neutron has a 1/2.4 = 0.42 = 42 % probability of causing another fission event as opposed to either being absorbed by a non-fission capture event or escaping from the fissile core.

The average number of neutrons that cause new fission events is called the effective neutron multiplication factor, usually denoted by the symbols &quot;k-effective&quot;, &quot;k-eff&quot; or &quot;k&quot;. When &quot;k-effective&quot; is equal to 1, the assembly is called critical, if &quot;k-effective&quot; is less than 1 the assembly is said to be subcritical, and if &quot;k-effective&quot; is greater than 1 the assembly is called supercritical.

== Critical versus prompt-critical ==
In a supercritical assembly, the number of fissions per unit time, &quot;N&quot;, along with the power production, increases exponentially with time. How fast it grows depends on the average time it takes, &quot;T&quot;, for the neutrons released in a fission event to cause another fission. The growth rate of the reaction is given by:

: formula_1

Most of the neutrons released by a fission event are the ones released in the fission itself. These are called prompt neutrons, and strike other nuclei and cause additional fissions within nanoseconds (an average time interval used by scientists in the Manhattan Project was one shake, or 10 ns). A small additional source of neutrons is the fission products. Some of the nuclei resulting from the fission are radioactive isotopes with short half-lives, and nuclear reactions among them release additional neutrons after a long delay of up to several minutes after the initial fission event. These neutrons, which on average account for less than one percent of the total neutrons released by fission, are called delayed neutrons. The relatively slow timescale on which delayed neutrons appear is an important aspect for the design of nuclear reactors, as it allows the reactor power level to be controlled via the gradual, mechanical movement of control rods. Typically, control rods contain neutron poisons (substances, for example boron or hafnium, that easily capture neutrons without producing any additional ones) as a means of altering &quot;k-effective&quot;. With the exception of experimental pulsed reactors, nuclear reactors are designed to operate in a delayed-critical mode and are provided with safety systems to prevent them from ever achieving prompt criticality.

In a delayed-critical assembly, the delayed neutrons are needed to make &quot;k-effective&quot; greater than one. Thus the time between successive generations of the reaction, &quot;T&quot;, is dominated by the time it takes for the delayed neutrons to be released, of the order of seconds or minutes. Therefore, the reaction will increase slowly, with a long time constant. This is slow enough to allow the reaction to be controlled with electromechanical control systems such as control rods, and accordingly all nuclear reactors are designed to operate in the delayed-criticality regime.

In contrast, a critical assembly is said to be prompt-critical if it is critical (&quot;k = 1&quot;) without any contribution from delayed neutrons and prompt-supercritical if it is supercritical (the fission rate growing exponentially, &quot;k &gt; 1&quot;) without any contribution from delayed neutrons. In this case the time between successive generations of the reaction, &quot;T&quot;, is limited only by the fission rate from the prompt neutrons, and the increase in the reaction will be extremely rapid, causing a rapid release of energy within a few milliseconds. Prompt-critical assemblies are created by design in nuclear weapons and some specially designed research experiments.

The difference between a prompt neutron and a delayed neutron has to do with the source from which the neutron has been released into the reactor. The neutrons, once released, have no difference except the energy or speed that have been imparted to them. A nuclear weapon relies heavily on prompt-supercriticality (to produce a high peak power in a fraction of a second), whereas nuclear power reactors use delayed-criticality to produce controllable power levels for months or years.

== Nuclear reactors ==
In order to start up a controllable fission reaction, the assembly must be delayed-critical. In other words, &quot;k&quot; must be greater than 1 (supercritical) without crossing the prompt-critical threshold. In nuclear reactors this is possible due to delayed neutrons. Because it takes some time before these neutrons are emitted following a fission event, it is possible to control the nuclear reaction using control rods.

A steady-state (constant power) reactor is operated so that it is critical due to the delayed neutrons, but would not be so without their contribution. During a gradual and deliberate increase in reactor power level, the reactor is delayed-supercritical. The exponential increase of reactor activity is slow enough to make it possible to control the criticality factor, &quot;k&quot;, by inserting or withdrawing rods of neutron absorbing material. Using careful control rod movements, it is thus possible to achieve a supercritical reactor core without reaching an unsafe prompt-critical state.

Once a reactor plant is operating at its target or design power level, it can be operated to maintain its critical condition for long periods of time.

=== Prompt critical accidents ===

Nuclear reactors can be susceptible to prompt-criticality accidents if a large increase in reactivity (or &quot;k-effective&quot;) occurs, e.g., following failure of their control and safety systems. The rapid uncontrollable increase in reactor power in prompt-critical conditions is likely to irreparably damage the reactor and in extreme cases, may breach the containment of the reactor. Nuclear reactors&#x27; safety systems are designed to prevent prompt criticality and, for defense in depth, reactor structures also provide multiple layers of containment as a precaution against any accidental releases of radioactive fission products.

With the exception of research and experimental reactors, only a small number of reactor accidents are thought to have achieved prompt criticality, for example Chernobyl #4, the U.S. Army&#x27;s SL-1, and Soviet submarine K-431. In all these examples the uncontrolled surge in power was sufficient to cause an explosion that destroyed each reactor and released radioactive fission products into the atmosphere.

At Chernobyl in 1986, a poorly understood positive scram effect resulted in an overheated reactor core. This led to the rupturing of the fuel elements and water pipes, vaporization of water, a steam explosion, and a graphite fire. Estimated power levels prior to the incident suggest that it operated in excess of 30 GW, ten times its 3 GW maximum thermal output. The reactor chamber&#x27;s 2000-ton lid was lifted by the steam explosion. Since the reactor was not designed with a containment building capable of containing this catastrophic explosion, the accident released large amounts of radioactive material into the environment. 

In the other two incidents, the reactor plants failed due to errors during a maintenance shutdown that was caused by the rapid and uncontrolled removal of at least one control rod. The SL-1 was a prototype reactor intended for use by the US Army in remote polar locations. At the SL-1 plant in 1961, the reactor was brought from shutdown to prompt critical state by manually extracting the central control rod too far. As the water in the core quickly converted to steam and expanded (in just a few milliseconds), the reactor vessel jumped , leaving impressions in the ceiling above. All three men performing the maintenance procedure died from injuries. 1,100 curies of fission products were released as parts of the core were expelled. It took 2 years to investigate the accident and clean up the site. The excess prompt reactivity of the SL-1 core was calculated in a 1962 report:

In the &quot;K-431&quot; reactor accident, 10 were killed during a refueling operation. The &quot;K-431&quot; explosion destroyed the adjacent machinery rooms and ruptured the submarine&#x27;s hull. In these two catastrophes, the reactor plants went from complete shutdown to extremely high power levels in a fraction of a second, damaging the reactor plants beyond repair.

==List of accidental prompt critical excursions==
A number of research reactors and tests have purposely examined the operation of a prompt critical reactor plant. CRAC, KEWB, SPERT-I, Godiva device, and BORAX experiments contributed to this research. Many accidents have also occurred, however, primarily during research and processing of nuclear fuel. SL-1 is the notable exception.

The following list of prompt critical power excursions is adapted from a report submitted in 2000 by a team of American and Russian nuclear scientists who studied criticality accidents, published by the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, the location of many of the excursions.

== Nuclear weapons ==

In the design of nuclear weapons, in contrast, achieving prompt criticality is essential. Indeed, one of the design problems to overcome in constructing a bomb is to compress the fissile materials enough to achieve prompt criticality before the chain reaction has a chance to produce enough energy to cause the core to expand too much. A good bomb design must therefore win the race to a dense, prompt critical core before a less-powerful chain reaction disassembles the core without allowing a significant amount of fuel to fission (known as a fizzle). This generally means that nuclear bombs need special attention paid to the way the core is assembled, such as the implosion method invented by Richard C. Tolman, Robert Serber, and other scientists at the University of California, Berkeley in 1942.

<doc id="1217161" wikidata="Q489825" url="?curid=1217161" title="Kanggye">
<text>Kanggye (; ) is the provincial capital of Chagang, North Korea and has a population of 251,971. Because of its strategic importance, derived from its topography, it has been of military interest from the time of the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910).

==History==
In December 1949, Kanggye-myon was promoted to Kanggye-si.

During the Korean War, after being driven from Pyongyang, Kim Il Sung and his government temporarily moved the capital to Kanggye after first moving temporarily to Sinuiju. The city was firebombed in November 1950 on American general Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s orders after the Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army turned the course of the war; at least 65% of the city was destroyed. The following month Kim presided over a plenum of the cabinet at Kanggye, where he assigned blame for what he claimed were military failures during the losing phase of the war.
==Culture==

=== Attractions ===
Kanggye is home to an open-air stadium and is also home to the Kanggye Riding Club, which was built in 2024. Kanggye has scenic walkways along the Changja River and a small waterpark.

Other places of interest include Inphung Pavilion and Mount Ryonhwa. Tourist attractions have been developed to show the mountainous nature of the city.

=== Facilities ===
Kanggye University of Education, Kanggye University of Technology, and the Kanggye University of Medicine are located in the city.

The city has more than 50 various medical centres including an oral care and a maternity hospital.

==Transportation==
Kanggye is a transportation hub, connected to other cities by road, rail and air. It lies at the junction of the Kanggye and Manp&#x27;o Lines. Commuter trains run on the Manpo line between Kanggye and Ssangbangdong stations. In addition, highways connect it to Pyongyang and other locations, with the road network of Chagang province being centered on the city. The city is located near a military and civilian dual-purpose air station.

Kanggye has a trolleybus (무궤도전차) system, opened on April 17, 1992, with one 12 km line running from Changja-dong to Kong&#x27;in-dong, following the embankment of the Changja and Puchon rivers. Up until 2009 it had 6 full length and 2 medium trolleybuses; in the 2010s 5 full length and 1 medium trolleybus remained. In 2020, the northern loop was built into a small depot.

==Broadcasting==
A local radio station called &quot;Kanggye Broadcasting ()&quot;, originally founded in 1947 as a local broadcasting station for North Pyongan Province, which later became a local broadcasting station for Chagang Province in 1949. It is operated by the Chagang Province Broadcasting Committee (). It airs programs that cover topics such as ideological education or local weather information.

==Economy==
From 1945, the manufacturing industry developed rapidly.

Kanggye has a mining industry producing copper, zinc ore, coal and graphite.

Kanggye hosts one of the main timber processing factories of Chagang province and North Korea. The city has various light industry along with production of construction, electrical and precision machinery. The pencils produced, which are also exported, have &#x27;national significance&#x27;. The city also has agricultural, fruit, vegetable and livestock production.

=== Electricity production ===
The city has a large number of hydropower plants due to its location near a number of rivers. The first hydropower station in a series of them is called Hungju No.1 Youth Power Station, is located 3.5 km north of Kanggye. It is supported by the Ryongrim dam, which does not have a power station attached to it. This allows a careful management of the water level to ensure efficient operation. This is followed by the Hungju Youth Power Station No. 2 and 3. No.2 was completed in 2007 and No.3 was completed by February 2019, fitted with three generator turbines.

There are also a series of four small scale hydropower plants on the Pukchon river.

===Kanggye Timber Processing Factory===
Kanggye Timber Processing Factory(강계목재가공공장) is a small state-run factory located in Kanggye City. At the start of operations, it produced only two kinds of furniture (dining tables and sterilized chopsticks) through manual labour. Over time it has developed into a comprehensive modernized furniture producer, producing woodwork with a hundred and dozens of modern facilities in production.
Amongst machinery in use are three- and four-faced automatic planes, all-purpose polishers, joining machines, and grooving saws.
Meanwhile, the factory has directed an effort into the programme of modernizing the drying job, which is an important part of the woodworking process. By making technical innovations (such as replacing a boiler-induced drying process drying ovens and using fuels other than coal) the factory increased production and lowered manpower.

===No.26 General Plant===

The No.26 factory is the largest underground military facility in Korea. The plant manufactures ammunition which has been exported to Libya, Syria, Iran, Iraq and Egypt. It employs more than 20,000 workers and can produce 126,000 mortar rounds and 1.76 million rounds of rifle ammunition per year. On November 30, 1991, up to a thousand people were allegedly killed after a massive explosion at the plant. South Korean sources put the number of fatalities at six times that amount or more based on the claims of survivors of the incident.

==Administrative divisions==

Kanggye is divided into 34 &quot;tong&quot; (neighbourhoods) and two &quot;ri&quot; (villages):

==Geography==
Kanggye gets its name, &quot;river junction,&quot; from the Changja River, which flows through the city, and two tributaries. The city is located in a basin, and is hence surrounded by mountains. The main mountain ranges are the Nangnim and Gangnam.

===Climate===
Kanggye has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dwa&quot;).

<text>The yellow perch (Perca flavescens), commonly referred to as perch, striped perch, American perch or preacher is a freshwater perciform fish native to much of North America. The yellow perch was described in 1814 by Samuel Latham Mitchill from New York. It is closely related, and morphologically similar to the European perch (&quot;Perca fluviatilis&quot;); and is sometimes considered a subspecies of its European counterpart.

Latitudinal variability in age, growth rates, and size have been observed among populations of yellow perch, likely resulting from differences in day length and annual water temperatures. In many populations, yellow perch often live 9 to 10 years, with adults generally ranging in length.

The world record for a yellow by weight is , and was caught in May 1865 in Bordentown, New Jersey, by Dr. C. Abbot. It is the longest-standing record for a freshwater fish in North America.

==Description==

The yellow perch has an elongate, laterally compressed body with a subterminal mouth and a relatively long but blunt snout which is surpassed in length by the lower jaw. Yellow perch have 800 fine teeth. Their bodies are rough to the touch because of their ctenoid scales. Like most perches, the yellow perch has two separate dorsal fins. The anterior, or first, dorsal fin contains 12–14 spines while the second has 2–3 spines in its anterior followed by 12–13 soft rays. The anal fin has 2 spines and 7–8 soft rays. The opercula tips are spined, and the anal fin has two spines. The pelvic fins are close together, and the homocercal caudal fin is forked. Seven or eight branchiostegal rays are seen.

The upper part of the head and body varies in colour from bright green through to olive or golden brown. The colour on the upper body extends onto the flanks where it creates a pattern of 6–8 vertical bars over a background of yellow or yellowish green. They normally show a blackish blotch on the membrane of the first dorsal fin between the rearmost 3 or 4 spines. The colour of the dorsal and caudal fins vary from yellow to green while the anal and pelvic fins may be yellow through to silvery white; in spawning season, males develop pronounced red or yellow color on their lower fins. The pectoral fins are transparent and amber in colour. The ventral part of the body is white or yellow. The juvenile fish are paler and can have an almost whitish background colour. The maximum recorded total length is —although they are more commonly around —and the maximum published weight is .
==Distribution==
Yellow perch are native to the tributaries of the Atlantic Oceans and Hudson Bay in North America, particularly the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence River and Mississippi River basins. In Canada, its native range extends throughout Nova Scotia and Quebec north to the Mackenzie River. It also is common in the northwest to Great Slave Lake and west into Alberta. In the United States, the native range extends south into Ohio and Illinois, and throughout most of the northeastern United States. Native distribution was driven by postglacial melt from the Mississippi River. It is also considered native to the Atlantic Slope basin, extending south to the Savannah River. There is also a small, likely native population in the Dead Lakes region of the Apalachicola River system in Florida.

The yellow perch has also been widely introduced for sport and commercial fishing purposes. It has also been introduced to establish a forage base for bass and walleye. These introductions were predominantly performed by the U.S. Fish Commission in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. However, unauthorized introductions have likely occurred from illegal introductions, dispersal through connected waterways, and use as live bait. The current native and introduced range in the United States is through northern Missouri to western Pennsylvania to South Carolina and north to Maine, with introduced populations in the northwest and southwest portions of the United States. It has been extirpated in Arkansas. Introductions in Canada have been less intense than in the United States. It was primarily limited to the lakes in the Peace River drainage of British Columbia, but has currently expanded to other bordering areas since. A population in Swan Lake of the Peace River drainage, however, may be indigenous. The yellow perch has been introduced to China and Japan.

==Habitat==
Yellow perch are commonly found in the littoral zones of both large and small lakes, but also inhabit slow-moving rivers and streams, brackish waters, and ponds. Due to human intervention, they are currently found in many man-made lakes, reservoirs, and river impoundments. The perch are most abundant in lakes that may be warm or cool and are extremely productive in smaller lakes where they can dominate unless controlled by predation.

==Biology==

Yellow perch typically reach sexual maturity in two to three years for males and three to four years for females. They are iteroparous, spawning annually in the spring when water temperatures are between . Spawning is communal and typically occurs at night. Yellow perch are oviparous, as eggs are fertilized externally. Eggs are laid in a gelatinous strand (commonly 10,000–40,000), a characteristic unique among North American freshwater fishes. Egg strands are commonly draped over weeds, the branches of submerged trees or shrubs, or some other structure. Eggs hatch in 11–27 days, depending on temperature and other abiotic factors. They are commonly found in the littoral zones of both large and small lakes, but they also inhabit slow-moving rivers and streams, brackish waters, and ponds. Yellow perch commonly reside in shallow water, but are occasionally found deeper than or on the bottom.

In the northern waters, perch tend to live longer and grow at a slower rate. Females in general are larger, grow faster, live longer, and mature in 3–4 years compared to males, which mature in 2–3 years at a smaller size. Most research has showed the maximum age to be about 9–10 years, with a few living past 11 years. The preferred temperature range for the yellow perch is , with an optimum range of and a lethal limit in upwards of and a stress limit over . Yellow perch spawn once a year in spring using large schools and shallow areas of a lake or low-current tributary streams. They do not build a redd or nest. Spawning typically takes place at night or in the early morning. Females have the potential to spawn up to eight times in their lifetimes.

A small aquaculture industry in the US Midwest contributes about of yellow perch annually, but the aquaculture is not expanding rapidly.
The yellow perch is absolutely crucial to the survival of the walleye and largemouth bass in its range. Cormorants feed heavily on yellow perch in early spring, but over the entire season, only 10% of their diet is perch.

According to VanDeValk et al. (2002), &quot;Cormorant consumption of adult yellow perch was similar to angler harvest, but cormorants consumed almost 10 times more age‐2 yellow perch and only cormorants harvested age‐1 yellow perch. Cormorants and anglers combined harvested 40% of age‐1 and age‐2 yellow perch and 25% of the adult yellow perch population. Total annual mortality of adult percids has not changed since cormorant colonization. Although cormorant consumption of adult percids has little effect on harvest by anglers, consumption of subadults will reduce future angler harvest of yellow perch and, to a lesser extent, walleyes.&quot;

==Life history==
Yellow perch spawn once a year in spring using large schools and shallow areas of a lake or low-current tributary streams. They do not build a redd or nest. Females have the potential to spawn up to eight times in their lifetimes. Two to five males go to the spawning grounds first and are with the female throughout the spawning process. The female deposits her egg mass, and then at least two males release their milt over the eggs, with the total process taking about five seconds. The males stay with the eggs for a short time, but the females leave immediately. No parental care is provided for the eggs or fry. The average clutch size is 23,000 eggs, but can range from 2,000 to 90,000. The egg mass is jelly-like, semibuoyant, and can reach up to 2 m long. The egg mass attaches to some vegetation, while the rest flows with the water current. Other substrate includes sand, gravel, rubble, and submerged trees and brush in wetland habitat. Yellow perch eggs are thought to contain a chemical in the jelly-like sheath that protects the eggs and makes them undesirable since they are rarely ever eaten by other fish. The eggs usually hatch in 8–10 days, but can take up to 21 days depending on temperature and proper spawning habitat. Yellow perch do not travel far during the year, but move into deeper water during winter and return to shallow water in spring to spawn. Spawning occurs in the spring when water temperatures are between 6.7 and 12.8 °C. Growth of fry is initiated at 6–10 °C, but is inactive below 5.3 °C. Larval yellow perch survival is based on a variety of factors, such as wind speed, turbidity, food availability, and food composition. Immediately after hatching, yellow perch head for the pelagic shores to school and are typically 5 mm long at this point. This pelagic phase is usually 30–40 days long.

Sexual dimorphism is known to occur in the northern waters where females are often larger, grow faster, live longer, and mature in 3–4 years. Males mature in 2–3 years at a smaller size. Perch do not grow as large in the northern waters, but tend to live longer. Maximum age estimates vary widely. The age of the perch is highly based on the condition of the lake. Most research has shown the maximum age to be approximately 9–10 years, with a few living past 11 years. Yellow perch have been proven to grow the best in lakes where they are piscivorous due to the lack of predators. Perch do not perform well in cold, deep, oligotrophic lakes. Seasonal movements tend to follow the 20 °C isotherm and water temperature is the most important factor influencing fish distribution. Yellow perch commonly reside in shallow water, but are occasionally found deeper than 15 m or on the bottom. Their optimum temperature range is 21–24 °C, but have been known to adapt to warmer or cooler habitats. The common lethal limit is 26.5 °C, but some research has shown it to be upwards of 33 °C with a stress limit at anything over 26 °C. To grow properly, yellow perch prefer a pH of 7 to 8. The tolerable pH ranges have been found to be about 3.9 to 9.5. They also may survive in brackish and saline waters, as well as water with low dissolved oxygen levels.

==Ecology==
Primarily, age and body size determine the diets of yellow perch. Zooplankton is the primary food source for young and larval perch. By age one, they shift to macroinvertebrates, such as midges and mosquitos. Large adult perch feed on invertebrates, fish eggs, crayfish, mysid shrimp, and juvenile fish. They have been known to be predominantly piscivorous and even cannibalistic in some cases. About 20% of the diet of a yellow perch over 32 g (1.1 oz) in weight consists of small fish. Maximum feeding occurs just before dark, with typical consumption averaging 1.4% of their body weight.

Their microhabitat is usually along the shore among reeds and aquatic weeds, docks, and other structures. They are most dense within aquatic vegetation, since they naturally school, but also prefer small, weed-filled water bodies with muck, gravel, or sand bottoms. They are less abundant in deep and clear open water or unproductive lakes. Within rivers, they only frequent pools, slack water, and moderately vegetated habitat. They frequent inshore surface waters during the summer. Almost every cool- to warm-water predatory fish species, such as northern pike, muskellunge, bass, sunfish, crappie, walleye, trout, and even other yellow perch, are predators of the yellow perch. They are the primary prey for walleye &quot;Sander vitreus&quot;, and they consume 58% of the age zero and 47% of the age one yellow perch in northern lakes. However, in shallow natural lakes, largemouth bass &quot;Micropterus salmoides&quot; may be most influential in structuring the quality of yellow perch populations. In Nebraska&#x27;s Sandhill lakes, the mean weight and quality of yellow perch is not related to invertebrate abundance, but is related to the abundance of largemouth bass. The three primary factors influencing quality panfish populations are predators, prey, and the environment.

In eastern North America, yellow perch are an extremely important food source for birds such as double-crested cormorants. The cormorants specifically target yellow perch as primary prey. Other birds also prey on them, such as eagles, herring gulls, hawks, diving ducks, kingfishers, herons, mergansers, loons, and white pelicans. High estimates show that cormorants were capable of consuming 29% of the age-three perch population. Yellow perch are effective at escaping predation seasonally by lake trout and other native fishes during summer, perhaps due to the high thermal tolerance of yellow perch.

Perch are commonly active during the day and inactive at night except during spawning, when they are active both day and night. Perch are most often found in schools. Their vision is necessary for schooling and the schools break up at dusk and reform at dawn. The schools typically contain 50 to 200 fish, and are arranged by age and size in a spindle shape. Younger perch tend to school more than older and larger fish, which occasionally travel alone, and males and females often form separate schools. Some perch are migratory, but only in a short and local form. They also have been observed leading a semianadromous life. Yellow perch do not accelerate quickly and are relatively poor swimmers. The fastest recorded speed for a school was 54 cm/s (12.08 mph), with individual fish swimming at less than half that speed.

Some examples of parasites and diseases that afflict yellow perch include the epizootic bacterium &quot;Flavobacterium columnare&quot;, red worm &quot;Eustrongylides tubifex&quot;, cnidarians of subphylum Myxozoa including brain parasite &quot;Myxobolus neurophilus&quot;,
broad tapeworm &quot;Diphyllobothrium latum&quot;, and parasitic copepods &quot;Ergasilus&quot; spp.

==Current management==
Managers employed management techniques at Drummond Island, Michigan, such as harassing the cormorants and killing them as needed. Overall, the harassment deterred 90% of cormorant foraging attempts, while killing less than 6% on average at each site; yellow perch abundance increased significantly due to their being the predominant prey of cormorants by total number and weight at that lake. Lakes in South Dakota without suitable spawning substrate have had conifers introduced, such as short-needle spruce, to increase both spawning habitat and hatching success. Managers have identified seven key unauthorized pathways for the introduction of the yellow perch to non-native regions: shipping, recreational and commercial boating, construction of new canals and water diversions, releases from live food fish markets, releases from the aquarium and water garden trade, use of live bait, and illegal introductions to create new fisheries. The most likely unofficial pathways are illegal introductions, dispersal through connected waterways, and live bait. Many authorized introductions by natural resources agencies have taken place, as well, due to the sport-fishing demand.

In 2000, the parasite &quot;Heterosporis&quot; spp. was discovered in yellow perch on the Eagle River Chain of Lakes in Vilas County in Wisconsin, and has since been found in Minnesota, Michigan, and Ontario. The parasite does not infect people, but can infect many important sport and forage fish including the yellow perch. It does not kill the infected fish, but the flesh of a severely infected fish becomes inedible when the fish dies and the spores are then spread through the water to infect another fish. That concerns commercial fisherman in the Great Lakes regions that depend on these fish. The infected perch are not marketable. The current infection rates are 5% of harvest. Viral hemorrhagic septicemia is another serious disease in perch in the Great Lakes region. It has already killed thousands of drum in Lake Ontario and caused a large die-off of yellow perch in Lake Erie in 2006. Ontario is restricting commercial bait licenses as a precaution against this disease. Outside its native range, very few diseases or parasites have been found.

===Fishing===

Yellow perch are a popular sport fish, prized by both recreational anglers and commercial fishermen for their delicious, mild flavor. Because yellow perch are among the finest flavored pan fish, they are occasionally misrepresented on menus within the restaurant industry. White perch, rock bass, and many species of sunfish (genus &quot;Lepomis&quot;) are sometimes referred to as &quot;perch&quot; on menus. 
The voracious feeding habits of yellow perch make them fairly easy to catch when schools are located, and they are frequently caught by recreational anglers targeting other species. Perch at times attack lures normally used for bass such a 3&quot; tubes, Rapala minnows, and larger curl tail grubs on jigheads, and small, brightly colored casting spoons, but the simplest way to catch them is to use light line, 4 to 8# test and light, unpainted jig heads, 1/32–1/16 oz. Too many small soft plastic lure designs to mention can catch all panfish, but minnow-shaped lures with a quivering tail work much of the time, so long as the retrieval speed is slow and the lure is fished at the depth the perch are swimming. Thin, straight-tail grubs require the slowest speed of retrieval and are preferred when the bite is slow, which is much of the time.

Some good baits for perch include worms, live and dead minnows, small freshwater clams, crickets, and any small lure resembling any of these. Larger perch are often caught on large live minnow on a jighead, especially when fished over weed beds. Bobbers, if used, should be spindle type for the least resistance when the bait is struck, but small, round bobbers work well, too, yet indicate any slight pull of the bait. Raising the rod tip is usually more than enough force to set the hook.

Some yellow perch fisheries have been affected by intense harvesting, and commercial and recreational harvest rates often are regulated by management agencies. In most aquatic systems, yellow perch are an important prey source for larger, piscivorous species, and many fishing lures are designed to resemble yellow perch.

==Aquaculture ==

Yellow perch is a viable species for aquaculture. This species has shown a net weight gain between 37 and 78 grams over a three-year period in a study that raised yellow perch in outdoor ponds. Yellow perch meet several characteristics that make a species fit for aquaculture. Some such characteristics are as follows: they are low on the food chain, needing an optimal protein content of 21–27%, are accepting of pelleted fish feed, grow well in high densities due to their schooling nature, and the fish do not turn cannibalistic at high densities. When grown in ponds or tanks, yellow perch do not exhibit off flavors compared to wild caught yellow perch. These fish become sexually mature before they reach market size under natural conditions. Yellow perch rely on environmental cues, such as cooler temperatures, to mature. Controlling the temperature of the system allows yellow perch to be grown to market size before they mature.

==Market==

For over 100 years, Canada and the United States have been commercially harvesting yellow perch in the Great Lakes with trapnets, gillnets, and poundnets. In Canada, the estimated catch in 2002 was 3,622 tons with a value of $16.7 million, second only to walleye at $28.2 million. The greatest demand in the United States is in the north-central region, where nearly 70% of all yellow perch sales in the US occur within 80 km (49.7 mi) of the Great Lakes. Yellow perch is one of the easiest fish to catch, and can be taken in all seasons, and tastes great. Therefore, it is a desirable sport fish in some locations within the US and Canada. It even makes up around 85% of the sport fish caught in Lake Michigan.

The market demand for wild yellow perch has decreased due to overfishing in the 1960s and 1970s but farmed perch has become more popular. Farmed yellow perch reduce the need for mass harvesting from bodies of water. In 2000 farmed perch on the domestic and international markets were often the same or similar quality to wild perch.

==Etymology==
According to Brown, Runciman, Bradford and Pollard (2009), the genus name, &quot;Perca&quot;, is derived from ancient Greek for &quot;perch&quot; and the specific epithet, &quot;flavescens&quot;, is Latin for &quot;becoming gold&quot; or &quot;yellow colored&quot;. &quot;Perca&quot; may also mean &quot;dusky&quot;.

<text>Cabin in the Sky is a 1943 American musical film based on the 1940 Broadway musical of the same name. The first feature film directed by Vincente Minnelli, &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; features an all-black cast and stars Ethel Waters, Eddie &quot;Rochester&quot; Anderson and Lena Horne. Waters and Rex Ingram reprise their roles from the Broadway production as Petunia and Lucifer Junior, respectively. The film was Horne&#x27;s first and only leading role in an MGM musical. Louis Armstrong is also featured in the film as one of Lucifer Junior&#x27;s minions, and Duke Ellington and his Orchestra have a showcase musical number in the film.

In 2020, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

Little Joe is a well-meaning yet weak man, whose attempts at redemption are cut short when he is killed over gambling debts by big-shot Domino Johnson. On his deathbed, Little Joe is resurrected by angelic powers and given six months to redeem his soul and become worthy of entering Heaven—otherwise he will be condemned to Hell. Secretly guided by &quot;The General&quot; (the Lord&#x27;s Angel), Little Joe gives up his shiftless ways and becomes a hardworking, generous, and loving husband to his wife Petunia, whom he had previously neglected.

Demon Lucifer Jr. (the son of Satan himself) is determined to drag Little Joe to Hell and attempts to do so in many ways, including by arranging for Joe to become wealthy by winning a lottery; reintroducing Joe to a beautiful gold-digger, Georgia Brown; and manipulating the marital discord between Joe and Petunia. His tactics work: Little Joe abandons his wife for Georgia, and the two embark on a life of hedonistic pleasure.

As Little Joe and Georgia celebrate at a nightclub one evening, Petunia joins them, determined to win Joe back. Little Joe fights with Domino for Petunia, and Petunia, anguished at this turn of events, prays to God to destroy the nightclub. A tornado appears and leaves the nightclub in ruins, as Joe and Petunia lie dead in the ruins after being shot by Domino. Just as it appears that Joe&#x27;s soul is lost forever, the angelic General informs him that Georgia Brown was so affected by the tragedy that she has donated all the money that Joe had lavished upon her to the church. On this technicality, Little Joe is allowed to go to Heaven with Petunia.

As the two climb the Celestial Stairs, Joe suddenly wakes in his own bed. Joe had not been killed in the initial gambling-debt fracas, only wounded. All his supposed dealings with angels and demons were only a fever dream. Now genuinely reformed, Little Joe begins a new happy life with his loving Petunia.

==Cast==
==Production==
According to notes within the reissue of the CD soundtrack, Freed and Minnelli sought input from black leaders before production began on the film.

The script was submitted before production to the NAACP. In a letter to the editor in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, a writer of the film said he received a letter &quot;congratulating [them] on the treatment of this black fable, which avoided clichés and racial stereotypes.&quot;

Stock footage of Arnold Gillespie&#x27;s famous muslin-sock tornado from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; was reused in this film for the scene where the cyclone destroys the nightclub.

===Deleted songs===
One musical number, in which Horne sings a reprise of &quot;Ain&#x27;t It the Truth&quot; while taking a bubble bath, was cut from the film prior to release, though it later appeared in a 1946 Pete Smith short subject entitled &quot;Studio Visit&quot;. According to Horne speaking in the documentary &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot; (1994) (in which the excised performance was also featured), the consensus was thought to be that the showing of a black woman singing in a bath went beyond the bounds of moral decency in 1943. A second non-bubble bath (and third overall) performance of this song by Louis Armstrong was also cut from the final print, resulting in Armstrong having no solo musical number in the film. Armstrong&#x27;s recording of &quot;Ain&#x27;t it the Truth&quot; survives and is included on the later CD release of the film&#x27;s original soundtrack. The song&#x27;s authors and Lena Horne collaborated on their Broadway musical &quot;Jamaica&quot; starring Horne, in which they recycled the song as part of the score as a solo for her.

==Film promotion==
MGM held a trade show of the film on February 9, 1943, in Denver, Salt Lake City, and San Francisco. Another show was held on February 11 in Portland, Los Angeles and Seattle.

For promotional purposes, records were produced for two musical numbers: &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Taking a Chance on Love.&quot;

Marian McCullough from Loews in Dayton had cooperated with local hotels to place a sign at each registry desk that read, &quot;Ps-s-t! If they don&#x27;t have a room, come over to Loew&#x27;s...We have a great big &quot;Cabin in the Sky.&quot;

The Orpheum Theatre in Springfield, Illinois placed advertisements in the classified section of newspapers that read, &quot;This Cabin for Rent, and with it goes plenty of entertainment for all.&quot; The ad came with a small cutout of a cabin.

Jack Matlack&#x27;s campaign at the Broadway theater in Portland had the theater staff in blackface and gingham-dressed.

===&quot;Showmen&#x27;s Trade Review&quot;===
At a screening of the film, &quot;Showmen&#x27;s Trade Review&quot; gathered and listed possible ideas for theaters to promote the film. Newspapers and radios were encouraged to hold contests where viewers were to submit, dreams, recipes that use inexpensive ingredients, the furnishing and construction of their ideal &quot;Cabin in the Sky,&quot; or incidents they have personally experienced using &quot;luck charms.&quot; A &quot;Go to Church Sunday&quot; campaign included offering discounts on tickets for congregations to bring in new worshipers. For the stage, choral groups or amateur night with comedy, singing and dancing nights were suggested. For the lobby, a trio of boys singing and dancing where boys could throw large, 12-inch square dice was suggested. To play on Eddie Rochester Anderson&#x27;s difficulty with his necktie in the film, it was suggested to borrow mannequins and hold a tie tying contest where the top ten fastest contestants gain free admission.

While the article did suggest that these activities were held using people of color, it closed out by emphasizing that focus of an all-black cast should not be used as the main selling points as it would sell &quot;through confidence that it will be enthusiastically received by [the] customers.&quot;

==Reception==
In the 1940s, movie theaters in many cities, particularly in the southern United States, refused to show films with prominent black performers. On July 29, 1943, in Mt. Pleasant, Tennessee, the film was pulled after the first 30 minutes on orders from the local sheriff. A crowd gathered outside the theater and someone threatened to &quot;pull the switch.&quot;

The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song for &quot;Happiness Is a Thing Called Joe&quot; sung by Ethel Waters.

According to MGM records the film made $1,719,000 in the US and Canada and $234,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $587,000.

After years of unavailability, Warner Home Video and Turner Entertainment released &quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot; on DVD on January 10, 2006.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 81% from 47 reviews and an average rating of 7.2/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Cabin in the Sky&quot;″s racial stereotypes are impossible to ignore – but so are its irresistible musical numbers and brilliantly talented cast.&quot;

<doc id="1217188" wikidata="Q4826997" url="?curid=1217188" title="Autosplenectomy">
<text>An autosplenectomy (from&quot; &#x27;auto-&#x27; &quot;self,&quot; &#x27;-splen-&#x27; &quot;spleen,&quot; &#x27;-ectomy&#x27; &quot;removal) is a negative outcome of disease and occurs when a disease damages the spleen to such an extent that it becomes shrunken and non-functional. The spleen is an important immunological organ that acts as a filter for red blood cells, triggers phagocytosis of invaders, and mounts an immunological response when necessary. Lack of a spleen, called asplenia, can occur by autosplenectomy or the surgical counterpart, splenectomy. Asplenia can increase susceptibility to infection. Autosplenectomy can occur in cases of sickle-cell disease where the misshapen cells block blood flow to the spleen, causing scarring and eventual atrophy of the organ. Autosplenectomy is a rare condition that is linked to certain diseases but is not a common occurrence. It is also seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

==Consequences==

Absence of effective splenic function or absence of the whole spleen (asplenia) is associated with increased risks of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection, especially from polysaccharide encapsulated bacteria and organisms that invade erythrocytes. People without a spleen have a weakened immune system, although other immune organs compensate for the missing spleen. Vaccination against encapsulated bacteria and prophylactic antibiotics can be used to counteract lowered immunity in asplenic patients. Specifically, people without a spleen are recommended to be vaccinated against pneumonia, influenza, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; type b and meningococci.

=== Testing for autosplenectomy ===
One of the spleen&#x27;s main tasks is to filter the blood and remove and recycle damaged or old red blood cells. Splenic function can be measured by filtering capabilities, as indicated by number of Howell-Jolly bodies or pitted erythrocytes in the blood. Both of these tests examine whether or not the spleen is functioning normally by testing splenic outputs.

==== Howell-Jolly bodies ====
Howell–Jolly bodies are found on red blood cells and contain chromatin remnants from basophilic cells. Under normal conditions, these nuclear remnants are removed from the blood by the spleen&#x27;s filtering capabilities. Howell-Jolly bodies can be identified and quantified using a blood smear or by flow cytometry. A high number of Howell-Jolly bodies is indicative of splenic hypofunction and potentially autosplenectomy.

==== Pitted erythrocytes ====
Erythrocytes with membrane pits can be indicative of splenic dysfunction as a healthy spleen clears blood of pitted erythrocytes. Pitted erythrocytes can be counted using Normarsky optics. Humans with healthy spleens have less than two percent of their red blood cells contain pits. In comparison, a person with asplenia may have up to 50% of their red blood cells contain pits.

==Diseases that cause autosplenectomy==

===Sickle cell anemia===
The most frequent cause of autosplenectomy is sickle cell anemia which causes progressive splenic hypofunction over time. Increased deoxygenation causes sickling of red blood cells, which adhere to the spleen wall and splenic macrophages causing ischemia. This ischemia can result in splenic sequestration, where large amounts of blood pool in the spleen but do not flow within vasculature.

=== Pneumococcal sepsis ===
Pneumococcal sepsis, or whole-body infection caused by the &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; bacteria, has been reported to cause autosplenectomy but is a very rare and poorly understood complication of the infection.

<text>Outskirts is the debut studio album by Canadian country rock group Blue Rodeo, released in March 1987 through Risqué Disque. The singles &quot;Try&quot; and &quot;Rose-Coloured Glasses&quot; were hits in Canada, where &quot;Outskirts&quot; and &quot;Rebel&quot; also made the singles charts.

To mark the 25th anniversary of the album, Blue Rodeo released a two-LP vinyl remixed edition, &quot;Outskirts Remix&quot;, on November 27, 2012.

On the thirtieth anniversary of the album&#x27;s release, Jim Cuddy posted the following message on the band&#x27;s website: &quot;The first night we started to make &quot;Outskirts&quot; was also the night my wife Rena went into labour with our first child Devin. So needless to say it was an unforgettable night. The record came out to a deafening silence. Not a single radio station played the first single, &#x27;Outskirts&#x27;. We sold 5000 records which we thought was amazing but were told we would be dropped if nothing else happened. So much has happened since then but I still hold onto the feelings from those early days of tearing it up in a club with nothing to lose. We could never have dreamed of being where we are today and looking back on 30 years of playing music together. Sometimes life surprises you.&quot;

<text>Diamond Mine is the second album by Blue Rodeo, released in 1989. It was recorded in 1989 at the Donlands Theatre in Toronto and mixed at the Kingsway Studio in New Orleans. It is the last Blue Rodeo album to feature original drummer Cleave Anderson and includes several instrumental interludes by Bob Wiseman on the majority of versions. &quot;Diamond Mine&quot; was the second best-selling Cancon album in Canada in 1989.

The band had decided to work with Malcolm Burn on the album after hearing the album &quot;Red Earth&quot; by Crash Vegas, which had been formed a year earlier by singer-songwriter Michelle McAdorey and Blue Rodeo member Greg Keelor. They hired Burn in December 1988, and set up a temporary recording studio at the abandoned Donlands Theatre in the east end of Toronto for its &quot;roomy acoustics&quot;, in part inspired by the acoustics of &quot;The Trinity Session&quot; by the Cowboy Junkies. The recording was then mixed at the New Orleans studio of Daniel Lanois.

While touring to support the album in 1989, the band&#x27;s manager John Caton quit abruptly as a result of a heart condition, effectively ending the label Risque Disque as well. The band hired Danny Goldberg as their new manager.

Jim Cuddy states that of all the Blue Rodeo albums, &quot;Diamond Mine&quot; has the &quot;most honest expression of musical interest&quot;. Keelor has stated that in retrospect, the album has a &quot;muddy, confused&quot; sound.

<text>Casino is the third studio album by Blue Rodeo. It was drummer Mark French&#x27;s only album with the band. It was produced by Dwight Yoakam guitarist Pete Anderson.

&quot;Trust Yourself,&quot; &quot;After the Rain,&quot; and, most significantly, &quot;Til I Am Myself Again&quot; were notable hit singles from the album. The album was the ninth-best selling Cancon album in Canada of 1990, despite only being available for the last month of the year.

<doc id="1217213" wikidata="Q6684270" url="?curid=1217213" title="Lost Together (Blue Rodeo album)">
<text>Lost Together is the fourth studio album by Blue Rodeo. It was Bob Wiseman&#x27;s last album with the band, and was the first to feature drummer Glenn Milchem, and steel guitar player Kim Deschamps.

Notable hits from the album included &quot;Rain Down on Me,&quot; &quot;Flying,&quot; &quot;Already Gone&quot; and the title track.

The album was a Juno Award nominee for Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 1993.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada in 2020, CBC Music organized and released a &quot;Great Canadian Singalong&quot; of the title track, with several hundred Canadians submitting video of themselves singing the song in their homes for inclusion in the final mix.

==Songs==
The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Fools Like You&quot;, is a song Greg Keelor wrote about his disgust about continued abuse of Natives in Canada. Keelor explained in a 1992 interview: &quot;It&#x27;s about how atrocious our European forefathers were in the taking of this land and how the tradition is still continued in our present day. It was written after the Oka thing. I was freaked out and disgusted by it.&quot;

&quot;Restless&quot; is a song that was written about the demise of social welfare programs in America during the Ronald Reagan and George Bush administrations.

<doc id="1217215" wikidata="Q5455884" url="?curid=1217215" title="Five Days in July">
<text>Five Days in July is the fifth studio album by Canadian country-rock band Blue Rodeo. It was released by WEA on October 26, 1993, in Canada and Discovery Records on September 27, 1994, in the United States. It is the band&#x27;s first album to be released through WEA. The band&#x27;s most commercially successful album, it has been certified six times platinum as of 2008.

The album was recorded on singer/guitarist Greg Keelor&#x27;s farm in Southern Ontario in July 1993. While the band originally intended for the recordings to serve only as demos, they found that the songs had a warmth and spontaneity that warranted releasing the collection as an album. Guest musicians on the album include Sarah McLachlan, Colin Linden and Anne Bourne. This album was keyboardist James Gray&#x27;s first album with the band.

The album is supposed to be a tribute to the &quot;Harvest&quot;-era Neil Young sound. &quot;5 Days in May&quot;, &quot;Hasn&#x27;t Hit Me Yet&quot; and &quot;Bad Timing&quot; were notable hit singles for the band.

==Track trivia==
*&quot;What Is This Love,&quot; &quot;Dark Angel&quot; and &quot;Tell Me Your Dream&quot; feature Sarah McLachlan.
*Colin Linden appears on &quot;Know Where You Go&quot;
*Singer/guitarist Jim Cuddy has said that &quot;5 Days in May&quot; was inspired by his sound engineer&#x27;s practice of writing his wife&#x27;s name in the sand whenever he finds himself on a beach. Cuddy noticed the engineer doing so while the band was on tour in New Zealand, and was inspired to write lyrics combining this story with the story of how Cuddy met his own wife.

== 30th Anniversary Reiussue &amp; Performances ==
The album was reissued on Vinyl for its 30th Anniversary on October 26, 2023. The group also performed numerous two-set shows performing the album in its entirety to commemorate the anniversary.

<doc id="1217217" wikidata="Q505957" url="?curid=1217217" title="Edgar Froese">
<text>Edgar Willmar Froese (; 6 June 1944 – 20 January 2015) was a German musical artist and electronic music pioneer, best known for founding the electronic music group Tangerine Dream in 1967. Froese was the only continuous member of the group until his death. His solo and group recordings prior to 2003 name him as &quot;Edgar Froese&quot;, and his later solo albums bear the name &quot;Edgar W. Froese&quot;.

== Biography ==
Froese was born in Tilsit, East Prussia (now Sovetsk, Russia), on D-Day during World War II; members of his family, including his father, had been killed by the Nazis and after the war his mother and surviving family settled in Berlin. He took piano lessons from the age of 12, and started playing guitar at 15. After showing an early aptitude for art, Froese enrolled at the Academy of the Arts in Berlin to study painting and sculpture.

One of his most lucrative jobs was to design advertising posters for the Berlin buses. He started an evening degree in Psychology and Philosophy and received his doctorate on Kant&#x27;s categorical imperative. Since his interpretation was not in accordance with the academic way of thinking, he left the college with the remark: &quot;The dust of the universities is like a shroud over the truth.&quot;

In 1965 he formed a band called The Ones, who played psychedelic rock, and some rock R&amp;B standards. While playing in Spain, The Ones were invited to perform at Salvador Dalí&#x27;s villa in Cadaqués. Froese&#x27;s encounter with Dalí was highly influential, inspiring him to pursue more experimental directions with his music. The Ones disbanded in 1967, having released only one single &quot;Lady Greengrass&quot; (b/w &quot;Love of Mine&quot;) on Star-Club Records. After returning to Berlin, Froese began recruiting musicians for the free-rock band that would become Tangerine Dream.

== Personal life ==
Froese declared himself to be vegetarian, teetotal, and a non-smoker; he also did not take drugs. Froese was married to artist and photographer Monika (Monique) Froese from 1974 until her death in 2000. Their son Jerome Froese was a member of Tangerine Dream from 1990 through 2006. In 2002, Edgar Froese married artist and musician Bianca Froese-Acquaye.

Froese was a friend of such artists as David Bowie, Brian Eno, Iggy Pop, George Moorse, Volker Schlöndorff, Alexander Hacke and Friedrich Gulda. Pop and Bowie lived with Froese and his family at their home in Schöneberg before moving to their apartment on Hauptstraße. Froese also helped Bowie with his recovery from drugs and introduced him to the Berlin underground scene. Bowie named Froese&#x27;s solo album &quot;Epsilon in Malaysian Pale&quot; as a big influence and a soundtrack to his life in Berlin.

Froese died suddenly in Vienna on 20 January 2015 from a pulmonary embolism. He was posthumously awarded the Schallwelle Honorary Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2015. He was quoted by the BBC as having once said: &quot;there is no death, there is just a change of our cosmic address&quot;.

== Solo discography ==
;Studio albums
;Tangerine Dreams albums performed solely by Froese
;Compilations
=== Other appearances ===
=== Edgar Froese solo material as Tangerine Dream ===
&quot;Tangents&quot; was a Tangerine Dream compilation album box set of five CDs issued in 1994, compiling music from their years with Virgin Records, 1973 to 1983. Disc five consists entirely of &quot;previously unreleased material&quot;: ten tracks, seven of which are credited only to Froese as the composer. No information is given as to where or when these tracks were recorded, or by which line-up of Tangerine Dream. Most Tangerine Dream tracks credit the line-up that recorded it as the composers, therefore these appear to be Froese solo tracks, released under the Tangerine Dream name, and may have been recorded for this album. Furthermore, five tracks on disc three are described as &quot;re-recordings by Edgar Froese&quot;, while the remaining tracks on discs three and four are described as &quot;re-mixed plus additional recordings by Edgar Froese&quot;. The tracks on discs one and two are also remixed and contain new overdubs, and Froese is credited as producer for the entire album.

Another compilation box set, the 6-CD &quot;I-Box&quot; (2001) contains further bonus tracks credited only to Froese: &quot;Ivory Town&quot;, &quot;Storm Seekers&quot;, &quot;Cool Shibuya&quot; and &quot;Akash Deep&quot;. Several of Froese&#x27;s tracks from &quot;Tangents&quot; are included as well.

The Tangerine Dream album &quot;Views from a Red Train&quot; (2008) was originally announced as an Edgar Froese solo album. It was eventually expanded with other band members performing, but the album remains composed entirely by Froese.

<text>Nowhere to Here is the sixth studio album by Blue Rodeo.

A more electric rock album than the band&#x27;s 1993 outing &quot;Five Days in July&quot;, the album was not as well received by critics and fans as its predecessor. Despite this, &quot;Side of the Road&quot; and &quot;Better Off As We Are&quot; were notable singles.

Sarah McLachlan appears as a guest vocalist on &quot;Save Myself&quot;, &quot;Girl in Green&quot;, and &quot;Brown-Eyed Dog&quot;.

Some copies came with a 15-track second CD called 
:&quot;From There to Here: Best Of&quot;

<text>Tremolo is the seventh studio album by Blue Rodeo.

On this album, the band attempted to maintain a more immediate vibe than on 1995&#x27;s &quot;Nowhere to Here&quot;, which had been labelled as overly mannered by critics. To that end, songs were not brought to the whole band until the day of recording, so that the band&#x27;s performance would retain a spontaneous flair.

<doc id="1217233" wikidata="Q1376093" url="?curid=1217233" title="Samhan">
<text>Samhan, or Three Han, is the collective name of the Byeonhan, Jinhan, and Mahan confederacies that emerged in the first century BC during the Proto–Three Kingdoms of Korea, or Samhan, period. Located in the central and southern regions of the Korean Peninsula, the Samhan confederacies eventually merged and developed into the Baekje, Gaya, and Silla kingdoms. The name &quot;Samhan&quot; also refers to the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

&quot;Sam&quot; () is a Sino-Korean word meaning &quot;three&quot; and &quot;Han&quot; is a Korean word meaning &quot;great (one), grand, large, much, many&quot;. &quot;Han&quot; was transliterated into Chinese characters , , , or , but is believed by foreign linguists to be unrelated to the &quot;Han&quot; in Han Chinese and the Chinese kingdoms and dynasties also called &quot;Han&quot; (漢) and &quot;Han&quot; (韓). The word &quot;Han&quot; is still found in many Korean words such as &quot;Hangawi (한가위)&quot; — archaic native Korean for Chuseok (秋夕, 추석), &quot;Hangaram (한가람)&quot; — archaic native Korean for Hangang (漢江, 한강), &quot;Hanbat (한밭)&quot; — the original place name in native Korean for Daejeon (大田, 대전), &quot;hanabi&quot; (하나비) — a Joseon-era (Late Middle Korean) word for &quot;grandfather; elderly man&quot; (most often 할아버지 &quot;harabeoji&quot; in present-day Korean, although speakers of some dialects, especially in North Korea, may still use the form &quot;hanabi&quot;). &quot;Ma&quot; means south, &quot;Byeon&quot; means shining and &quot;Jin&quot; means east.

Many historians have suggested that the word &quot;Han&quot; might have been pronounced as &quot;Gan&quot; or &quot;Kan&quot;. The Silla language had a usage of this word for king or ruler as found in the words 마립간 (麻立干; Maripgan) and 거서간 / 거슬한 (居西干 / 居瑟邯; Geoseogan / Geoseulhan). Alexander Vovin suggests this word is related to the Mongolian &quot;Khan&quot; and Manchurian &quot;Han&quot; meaning ruler, and the ultimate origin is Xiongnu and Yeniseian.

The Samhan are thought to have formed around the time of the fall of Gojoseon in northern Korea in 108 BC. Kim Bu-sik&#x27;s Samguk Sagi, one of the two representative history books of Korea, mentions that people of Jin Han are migrants from Gojoseon, which suggests that early Han tribes who came to Southern Korean peninsula are originally Gojoseon people; this coincides with the state of Jin in southern Korea also disappearing from written records. By the 4th century, Mahan was fully absorbed into the Baekje kingdom, Jinhan into the Silla kingdom, and Byeonhan into the Gaya confederacy, which was later annexed by Silla.

Beginning in the 7th century, the name &quot;Samhan&quot; became synonymous with the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The &quot;Han&quot; in the names of the Korean Empire, &quot;Daehan Jeguk&quot;, and the Republic of Korea (South Korea), &quot;Daehan Minguk&quot; or &quot;Hanguk&quot;, are named in reference to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, not the ancient confederacies in the southern Korean Peninsula.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Samhan&quot; became a name for the Three Kingdoms of Korea beginning in the 7th century.

According to the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot; and &quot;Samguk Yusa&quot;, Silla implemented a national policy, &quot;Samhan Unification&quot; (), to integrate Baekje and Goguryeo refugees. In 1982, a memorial stone dating back to 686 was discovered in Cheongju with an inscription: &quot;The Three Han were unified and the domain was expanded.&quot; During the Later Silla period, the concepts of Samhan as the ancient confederacies and the Three Kingdoms of Korea were merged. In a letter to an imperial tutor of the Tang dynasty, Ch&#x27;oe Ch&#x27;i-wŏn equated Byeonhan to Baekje, Jinhan to Silla, and Mahan to Goguryeo. By the Goryeo period, Samhan became a common name to refer to all of Korea. In his Ten Mandates to his descendants, Wang Geon declared that he had unified the Three Han (Samhan), referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Samhan continued to be a common name for Korea during the Joseon period and was widely referenced in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty.

In China, the Three Kingdoms of Korea were collectively called Samhan since the beginning of the 7th century. The use of the name Samhan to indicate the Three Kingdoms of Korea was widespread in the Tang dynasty. Goguryeo was alternately called Mahan by the Tang dynasty, as evidenced by a Tang document that called Goguryeo generals &quot;Mahan leaders&quot; () in 645. In 651, Emperor Gaozong of Tang sent a message to the king of Baekje referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea as Samhan. Epitaphs of the Tang dynasty, including those belonging to Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla refugees and migrants, called the Three Kingdoms of Korea &quot;Samhan&quot;, especially Goguryeo. For example, the epitaph of Go Hyeon (), a Tang dynasty general of Goguryeo origin who died in 690, calls him a &quot;Liaodong Samhan man&quot; (). The History of Liao equates Byeonhan to Silla, Jinhan to Buyeo, and Mahan to Goguryeo.

In 1897, Gojong changed the name of Joseon to the Korean Empire, &quot;Daehan Jeguk&quot;, in reference to the Three Kingdoms of Korea. In 1919, the provisional government in exile during the Japanese occupation declared the name of Korea as the Republic of Korea, &quot;Daehan Minguk&quot;, also in reference to the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

== Three Hans ==

The Samhan are generally considered loose confederations of walled-town states. Each appears to have had a ruling elite, whose power was a mix of politics and shamanism. Although each state appears to have had its own ruler, there is no evidence of systematic succession.

The name of the poorly understood Jin state continued to be used in the name of the Jinhan confederacy and in the name &quot;Byeonjin,&quot; an alternate term for Byeonhan. In addition, for some time the leader of Mahan continued to call himself the King of Jin, asserting nominal overlordship over all of the Samhan confederations.

Mahan was the largest and earliest developed of the three confederacies. It consisted of 54 minor statelets, one of which conquered or absorbed the others and became the center of the Baekje Kingdom. Mahan is usually considered to have been located in the southwest of the Korean peninsula, covering Jeolla, Chungcheong, and portions of Gyeonggi.

Jinhan consisted of 12 statelets, one of which conquered or absorbed the others and became the center of the Silla Kingdom. It is usually considered to have been located to the east of the Nakdong River valley.

Byeonhan consisted of 12 statelets, which later gave rise to the Gaya confederacy, subsequently annexed by Silla. It is usually considered to have been located in the south and west of the Nakdong River valley.

== Geography ==
The exact locations occupied by the different Samhan confederations are disputed. It is also quite likely that their boundaries changed over time. &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot; indicates that Mahan was located in the northern region later occupied by Goguryeo, Jinhan in the region later occupied by Silla, and Byeonhan in the southwestern region later occupied by Baekje. However, the earlier Chinese &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; places Mahan in the southwest, Jinhan in the southeast, and Byeonhan between them.

Villages were usually constructed deep in high mountain valleys, where they were relatively secure from attack. Mountain fortresses were also often constructed as places of refuge during war. The minor states which made up the federations are usually considered to have covered about as much land as a modern-day &quot;myeon&quot;, or township.

Based on historical and archeological records, river and sea routes appear to have been the primary means of long-distance transportation and trade (Yi, 2001, p. 246). It is thus not surprising that Jinhan and Byeonhan, with their coastal and river locations, became particularly prominent in international trade during this time.

== Languages ==
One of the most prominent leader of the Han (Korean: 한; 韓) Immigration was King Jun of Gojoseon from the northern Korea, having lost the throne to Wiman, fled to the state of Jin in southern Korea around 194 - 180 BC. He and his followers established Mahan which was one of the Samhan (&quot;Three Hans&quot;), along with Byeonhan and Jinhan. Further Han(韓) migration followed the fall of Gojoseon and establishment of the Chinese commanderies in 108 BC.

The Samhan languages (Korean: 삼한어; 三韓語) were a branch of the ancient Koreanic languages, referring to the non-Buyeo Koreanic languages, once spoken in the southern Korean Peninsula, which were closely related to the Buyeo languages.

The Samhan languages were spoken in the Mahan, Byeonhan and Jinhan. The extent of Han languages is unclear. It is generally accepted as including Sillan, and may also have included the language(s) spoken in Baekje. A number of researchers have suggested that Baekje may have been bilingual, with the ruling class speaking a Puyŏ language and the commoners speaking a Han language.

Linguistic evidence suggests that Japonic languages (see Peninsular Japonic) were spoken in large parts of the southern Korean Peninsula, but its speakers were eventually assimilated by Koreanic-speaking peoples and the languages replaced/supplanted. Evidence also suggests that Peninsular Japonic and Koreanic languages co-existed in the southern Korean Peninsula for an extended period of time and influenced each other. As has been suggested for the later Korean kingdom of Baekje, it is possible that the Samhan states were bilingual prior to the complete replacement of Peninsular Japonic by Koreanic languages.

== Technology ==
The Samhan saw the systematic introduction of iron into the southern Korean peninsula. This was taken up with particular intensity by the Byeonhan states of the Nakdong River valley, which manufactured and exported iron armor and weapons throughout Northeast Asia.

The introduction of iron technology also facilitated growth in agriculture, as iron tools made the clearing and cultivation of land much easier. It appears that at this time the modern-day Jeolla area emerged as a center of rice production (Kim, 1974).

== Relations ==
Until the rise of Goguryeo, the external relations of Samhan were largely limited to the Chinese commanderies located in the former territory of Gojoseon. The longest standing of these, the Lelang commandery, appear to have maintained separate diplomatic relations with each individual state rather than with the heads of the confederacies as such.

In the beginning, the relationship was a political trading system in which &quot;tribute&quot; was exchanged for titles or prestige gifts. Official seals identified each tribal leader&#x27;s authority to trade with the commandery. However, after the fall of the Kingdom of Wei in the 3rd century, San guo zhi reports that the Lelang commandery handed out official seals freely to local commoners, no longer symbolizing political authority (Yi, 2001, p. 245).

The Chinese commanderies also supplied luxury goods and consumed local products. Later Han dynasty coins and beads are found throughout the Korean peninsula. These were exchanged for local iron or raw silk. After the 2nd century CE, as Chinese influence waned, iron ingots came into use as currency for the trade based around Jinhan and Byeonhan.

Trade relations also existed with the emergent states of Japan at this time, most commonly involving the exchange of ornamental Japanese bronzeware for Korean iron. These trade relations shifted in the 3rd century, when the Yamatai federation of Kyūshū gained monopolistic control over Japanese trade with Byeonhan.

The title track was later covered by the Toronto surf-country band The Sadies under the title of &quot;The Story&#x27;s Often Told&quot;. The Sadies&#x27; album on which the track appears was produced by Blue Rodeo&#x27;s singer/guitarist, Greg Keelor.

The singer/guitarist, Jim Cuddy, said in concert that &quot;Bulletproof&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single, was his attempt to emulate the songwriting of his admired singer-songwriter Ron Sexsmith. He originally wrote the song to give to Blue Rodeo&#x27;s bass guitarist, Bazil Donovan, for use in a solo project, but chose in the end to keep the song for Blue Rodeo.

&quot;Glad to Be Alive&quot; was later re-recorded for Blue Rodeo&#x27;s 2014 Christmas album, &quot;A Merrie Christmas to You&quot;.

&quot;Clearer View&quot; was later re-recorded for Jim Cuddy&#x27;s 2019 solo album, &quot;Countrywide Soul&quot;.

<text>Latent Recordings is a Canadian independent record label founded in 1981. It was dormant in the 1990s while the Cowboy Junkies were signed to American labels, but began to release independently produced albums in the 2000s. By the late 2000s, it sold downloads and CDs online.

== History ==
The label was formed in London by Michael Timmins, Alan Anton, Geoff Railton, and Brett Wickens to produce and distribute their music. After their first three releases, they returned to Canada, where Timmins and Anton formed Cowboy Junkies with Timmins&#x27; siblings Margo and Peter.

In Toronto, the label distributed Cowboy Junkies&#x27; first two albums before the band signed with RCA, which re-released &quot;The Trinity Session&quot; internationally. For the next few years the label&#x27;s releases were sporadic offerings produced by Michael Timmins and/or Peter Moore.

After Cowboy Junkies was released from their record contract—by then with Geffen Records— following their 1998 album &quot;Miles from Our Home&quot;, they revived Latent Recordings and have released their subsequent albums on that label in Canada. The records have been licensed to other independent labels, such as Zoë Records in the United States and Strange Fruit Records in the UK, for international release.

In recent years, the label has again become active in releasing work by other artists as well, including Ivy Mairi, Finlayson/Maize, Jerry Leger, Lee Harvey Osmond and Huron.

==Catalogue==

<doc id="1217251" wikidata="Q1721876" url="?curid=1217251" title="Chocolate liquor">
<text>Chocolate liquor, also called cocoa liquor, paste or mass, is pure cocoa in liquid or semi-solid form. It is produced from cocoa bean nibs that have been fermented, dried, roasted, and separated from their skins. The nibs are ground to the point cocoa butter is released from the cells of the bean and melted, which turns cocoa into a paste and then into a free-flowing liquid.

The liquor is either separated into (non-fat) cocoa solids and cocoa butter, or cooled and molded into blocks, which can be used as unsweetened baking chocolate. Like the nibs from which it is produced, it contains both cocoa solids and cocoa butter in roughly equal proportion. Its main use (often with additional cocoa butter) is in making chocolate.

The name &quot;&quot; is used not in the sense of a distilled, alcoholic substance, but rather the older meaning of the word, meaning &#x27;liquid&#x27; or &#x27;fluid&#x27;. The terms &quot;paste&quot; and &quot;mass&quot; are also commonly used. According to American legislation, chocolate liquor is classified as a chocolate product. According to European legislation, it strictly remains a cocoa product until sugar is added.

Chocolate liquor contains roughly 53 percent cocoa butter (fat), about 17 percent carbohydrates, 11 percent protein, 6 percent tannins, and 1.5 percent theobromine.

<doc id="1217252" wikidata="Q5526626" url="?curid=1217252" title="Gaspé Manifesto">
<text>The Gaspé Manifesto was a controversial manifesto produced by a group of leading Canadian theatre professionals in connection with a 1971 conference in Gaspé, Quebec sponsored by the Canada Council. Its main suggestion called for publicly subsidized theatres to ensure that at least half of their productions would be Canadian content by 1973. There were two key goals in mind, to create a national theatre and to improve the conditions of playwrights. In the years that followed this manifesto more Canadian content was performed in Canadian theatres, although the 50% goal was not attained.

The Gaspé Manifesto can be found in &quot;Canadian Theatre History &quot; by Don Rubin.

<doc id="1217254" wikidata="Q7978333" url="?curid=1217254" title="Weaubleau structure">
<text>The Weaubleau structure is a probable meteorite impact site in western Missouri near the towns of Gerster, Iconium, Osceola, and Vista. It is believed to have been caused by a meteoroid between 335 and 340 million years ago during the middle Mississippian Period (Latest Osagean to Earliest Meramecian).
It is listed by the Impact Field Studies Group as a &quot;probable&quot; impact structure.

The structure consists of an area of severe structural deformation and extensive brecciation that was poorly understood and had been thought to be the result of either thrusting over a dome or a cryptoexplosive event. A circular structure was discovered by geologist Kevin R. Evans through examination of digital elevation data. The structure was originally called the Weaubleau-Osceola structure after Weaubleau Creek and Osceola. It is now known as the Weaubleau structure.

Because the site was covered by later Pennsylvanian Period sediments, and only partially exposed to erosion relatively recently, its structure is well preserved, and its age can be determined with fair accuracy. It is one of a series of known or suspected impact sites along the 38th parallel in the states of Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas. These 38th parallel structures are thought to possibly be the result of a serial impact, similar to that of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter, an extremely unlikely event on Earth. The argument for a serial strike would be greatly strengthened if the ages of the other 38th parallel structures could be constrained to the same period as the Weaubleau structure.

The Weaubleau structure is one of the fifty largest known impact structures on earth and the fourth largest in the United States. The three larger ones in the US either have been glaciated and buried (Manson crater), are under water (Chesapeake Bay crater), or have been subjected to orogeny (Beaverhead impact structure). Therefore, the Weaubleau structure is the largest exposed untectonized impact structure in the US.

==Round rocks==

Long thought to be a glacial remnant, these conglomerate rocks are found in the area of the Weaubleau structure. They are nearly perfectly round, and are referred to locally simply as &quot;geodes&quot;, &quot;round rocks&quot;, &quot;Missouri rock balls&quot;, or &quot;Weaubleau eggs&quot;.

It has been suggested that the round rocks are chert concretions or nodules. The round rocks may have formed when the impact threw shale clasts of the Northview Formation away from the center of the impact structure and subsequent silica-saturated waters precipitated silica around the shale clasts. The formation of the round rocks is poorly understood and requires further research.

<text>Unidentified Human Remains and the True Nature of Love is a 1989 stage play written by Canadian playwright Brad Fraser. Set in Edmonton, Alberta, the comedy-drama follows the lives of several sexually frustrated &quot;thirty-somethings&quot; who try to learn the meaning of love — during a time in which a serial killer is terrorizing the city. &quot;Unidentified Human Remains and the True Nature of Love&quot; was published in 2006 by Playwrights Canada Press as &quot;Love and Human Remains&quot;.

==Characters==
Candy, a heterosexual woman trying to meet the perfect man but who along the way finds herself experimenting with lesbianism; David, her homosexual roommate, who no longer believes that love exists; 
Kane, a sexually confused teenager who idolizes David; 
Bernie, David&#x27;s troubled best friend; 
Jerri, a lesbian who falls in love with Candy. 
Benita, a prostitute with psychic abilities.
Robert, a bartender who takes an interest in Candy
Sal, a past friend of David&#x27;s. An actor.

==Plot==
Using and subverting elements of various genres, including thriller, situation comedy and grade-B horror film, the piece is written with cynical humor, but is serious in tone. A group of friends, both old &amp; new, live their lives in a Canadian Metropolis. David &amp; Candy are two roommates looking for love, perhaps in the wrong places. Bernie is David&#x27;s best friend. Kane is David&#x27;s coworker. Jeri is a lesbian that Candy meets. Rick is a bartender, with a secret, who takes an interest in Candy. Benita is a psychic dominatrix whose talents feature heavily in the last moments of the play. As the action happens around the group of friends, a serial killer is making victims of various women in the city.

==Production history==

First presented by Alberta Theatre Projects at the playRites &#x27;89 Festival in Calgary, Alberta, &quot;Unidentified Human Remains&quot; was immediately controversial for its violence, nudity, frank dialogue, and sexual explicitness. It nevertheless received critical acclaim; it was named one of the 10 best plays of 1991 by &quot;TIME&quot;. The Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre&#x27;s 1992 production starred Erica Ehm as Benita and Derek Aasland as Kane. Over the next 15 years, productions in many languages have been mounted from New York City to Japan. In November 2004, a 15th anniversary revival of the piece took place in Calgary, Alberta.

==Film adaptation==
A film version, &quot;Love and Human Remains&quot;, was released in 1993.

<doc id="1217273" wikidata="Q3020470" url="?curid=1217273" title="Lest Darkness Fall">
<text>Lest Darkness Fall is a 1939 alternate history science fiction novel by the American author L. Sprague de Camp. &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot; is similar in concept to Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot;, but the treatment is very different.

The later alternate history author Harry Turtledove has said it sparked his interest in the genre as well as his desire to study Byzantine history.

== Plot ==
American classical archaeologist Martin Padway is visiting the Pantheon in Rome in 1938. A thunderstorm arrives, lightning cracks, and he finds himself transported to Rome in 535 AD. The Italian Peninsula is under the rule of the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths. The novel depicts their rule as a relatively benevolent despotism, allowing freedom of religion and maintaining the urban Roman society they had conquered, though slavery is common and torture the normal method of interrogation.

In the real timeline, the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire temporarily expanded westwards, embarking on what came to be known as the Gothic War (535–554). They overthrew the Ostrogoths in Italy and the Vandals in North Africa, but this war devastated the Italian urbanized society that required the support of intensive agriculture and Italy was severely depopulated: its population is estimated to have decreased from 7,000,000 to 2,500,000. The great cities of Roman times were abandoned and the Byzantines never fully consolidated their rule over Italy, which faced further invasions by the Lombards; Italy fell into a long period of decline. Some historians consider this the true beginning of the Dark Ages in Italy. The city of Rome was besieged three times and many of its inhabitants did not survive the war. Padway, finding himself in this Rome and knowing what the near future holds, must act not only to preserve the future of civilization, but to improve his personal chances of survival.

Padway initially wonders whether he is dreaming or delusional, but he quickly accepts his fate. As an archaeologist, he has enough understanding of various devices used before his time, but after the 6th century, to be able to reproduce them by the means available. He can speak both modern Italian and Classical Latin, and quickly learns enough Vulgar Latin to communicate effectively. Most crucially, Padway has read with great attention the book of the historian Procopius, who described the very war at whose outset Padway finds himself. He recalls the book in great detail, down to details of the time and route of the various armies&#x27; moves and their tactical and strategic considerations, as well as the convoluted and violent power struggles of the various contenders for the Gothic Kingship. Thus Padway, in effect, knows the direct, immediate future of the country where he lives and of some individual people whom he meets (at least, until he acts in a way that changes that future). In addition to this specialized and uniquely useful knowledge of the current war, Padway has taken a general interest in military history, which he is eventually able to put to very practical purposes.

Padway&#x27;s first idea is to make a copper still and sell brandy for a living. He persuades a banker, Thomasus the Syrian, to lend him seed money to start his endeavor. He teaches his and Thomasus&#x27;s clerks Arabic numerals and double entry bookkeeping. He eventually develops a printing press, issues a newspaper, and builds a crude semaphore telegraph system utilizing small telescopes. However, he fails to produce a mechanical clock, and temporarily halts his experiments attempting to reinvent gunpowder and cannons. He becomes increasingly involved in the politics of the state as Italy is invaded by the Byzantines and also threatened from the north.

Padway rescues the recently deposed king Thiudahad and becomes his quaestor. He uses the king&#x27;s support to gather forces to defeat the formidable Byzantine general Belisarius. He manages to surprise Belisarius with tactics never used in the ancient world. Then, deceiving the Dalmatian army, Padway reinstates the senile Thiudahad and imprisons King Wittigis as a hostage. In 537, when Wittigis is killed and Thiudahad descends into madness, Padway has a protégé of his, Urias, married to Mathaswentha and crowned king of the Ostrogoths. He tricks Justinian I into releasing Belisarius from his oath of allegiance and quickly enlists the military genius to command an army against the Franks.

The landing of a Byzantine army at Vibo, led by Bloody John, and a rebellion, led by Thiudahad&#x27;s son, threaten the Ostrogothic kingdom and its army is destroyed at Crathis Valley. Padway assembles a new force, spreads an &quot;emancipation proclamation&quot; to the Italian serfs and recalls Belisarius after his defeat of the Franks. The armies clash near Calatia and then Benevento. Despite the lack of discipline of his Gothic forces, some simple tactical tricks and the nick-of-time arrival of Belisarius secure Padway&#x27;s victory.

At the end of the novel, Padway has stabilized the Italo-Gothic kingdom, introduced a constitution, arranged the end of serfdom, liberated the Burgundians, and is having boats built for an Atlantic expedition to acquire tobacco. The king of the Visigoths has appointed Urias as his heir, reunifying the Goths. Ultimately, due to Padway&#x27;s actions, Europe will not experience what Enlightenment thinkers retrospectively named the Dark Ages: &quot;darkness will not fall&quot;.

==Principal characters==

* Martin Padway (self-Latinized as Martinus Paduei): Protagonist. Transported from 1938 Rome to its 535 equivalent.
* Nevitta, Nevitta Gummund&#x27;s son: Gothic farmer, Padway&#x27;s best friend in ancient Rome.
* Thomasus the Syrian: Banker and confidant of Padway. Often invokes God&#x27;s name, especially while bickering.
* Fritharik, Staifan&#x27;s son: Deposed Vandal noble, who becomes Padway&#x27;s bodyguard and right-hand man. Often laments the loss of his beautiful Carthage estate and remarks that they will eventually all end up in unmarked graves.
* Julia from Apulia: A servant hired by Padway who has a one-night stand with him.
* Dorothea: Daughter of Cornelius Anicius and love interest for Padway.

==Publication history==
A novella version was first published in &quot;Unknown&quot; #10, December 1939. The complete novel was published by Henry Holt and Company on 24 February 1941 and reprinted by both Galaxy Publishing and Prime Press in 1949. The first British edition was published in hardcover by Heinemann in 1955. The first paperback edition was published by Pyramid Books in February 1963 and reprinted in August 1969. A later paperback edition was issued by Ballantine Books in August 1974 and reprinted in 1975, 1979 and 1983; the Ballantine edition was also issued in hardcover by the Science Fiction Book Club in April 1979 and reprinted in 1996. The importance of the work was recognized by its inclusion in The Easton Press&#x27;s series The Masterpieces of Science Fiction in 1989. The book has also been collected with David Drake&#x27;s novella &quot;To Bring the Light&quot; in &quot;Lest Darkness Fall and To Bring the Light&quot; (Baen Books, 1996), with other works by de Camp in &quot;Years in the Making: the Time-Travel Stories of L. Sprague de Camp&quot; (NESFA Press, 2005), and with works by other authors in &quot;Lest Darkness Fall and Related Stories&quot; (Phoenix Pick, 2011). An E-book edition was published by Gollancz&#x27;s SF Gateway imprint on September 29, 2011, as part of a general release of de Camp&#x27;s works in electronic form. &quot;Galaxy&#x27;s Edge&quot; magazine reprinted &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot; over four issues starting in August 2014, repeating a typographical error that appears in &quot;Lest Darkness Fall and Related Stories&quot; (&quot;have&quot; for &quot;lave&quot; in Padway&#x27;s seduction scene).

==Sequels by other hands==
Several short story sequels to &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot;, written by other authors, have appeared over the years. &quot;The Apotheosis of Martin Padway&quot;, written by S. M. Stirling, appeared in Harry Turtledove&#x27;s 2005 tribute anthology honoring L. Sprague de Camp, &quot;The Enchanter Completed&quot;, and the 2011 Arc Manor anthology &quot;Lest Darkness Fall and Related Stories&quot;. It offers glimpses of what might have become of the reality Padway altered, both during his old age and a few hundred years later.

&quot;Temporal Discontinuity&quot; by David Weber, appeared in the second edition of the Arc Manor anthology, retitled &quot;Lest Darkness Fall and Timeless Tales Written in Tribute&quot; (2021); it was newly commissioned for the edition. It is another direct sequel, though incompatible with Stirling&#x27;s &quot;The Apotheosis of Martin Padway.&quot; Like &quot;Apotheosis,&quot; it also involves a future time-traveler investigating Padway&#x27;s temporal disruptions, only she thinks he&#x27;s a criminal from her own time who set out to change the timeline on purpose - a crime punishable by death. When agent Yawen Clasen-Hamatti confronts Padway in person, she discovers her mistake and has a moral dilemma on her hands.

The other story, &quot;The Fake Pandemic,&quot; by Harry Turtledove, was also commissioned for the second edition of the Arc Manor anthology. It is also a direct sequel to de Camp&#x27;s novel, compatible with Stirling&#x27;s but not Weber&#x27;s. In it, Padway recruits the Byzantine jurist Tribonian in an effort to prevent the Plague of Justinian. The story follows Tribonian as he proceeds to secure the emperor Justinian I&#x27;s permission and support to do just that, and follows him on his successful if thankless mission (Justinian may be supportive, but he is far from grateful).

==Related works==
Subsequent to &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot;, de Camp wrote two subsequent works with similar themes: &quot;The Wheels of If&quot; (1940) and &quot;Aristotle and the Gun&quot; (1958).

Direct responses to &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot; include the stories &quot;The Deadly Mission of Phineas Snodgrass&quot; (1962) by Frederik Pohl, and &quot;The Man Who Came Early&quot; (1956) by Poul Anderson. In the Pohl tale, a man travels back to 1 BC and teaches modern medicine, causing a population explosion. It ends with the fantastically overpopulated alternate timeline sending someone back to assassinate the title character, allowing darkness to fall for thankful billions. It was reprinted in the anthologies &quot;The Enchanter Completed&quot; (2005) and &quot;Lest Darkness Fall and Related Stories&quot; (2011). The Anderson piece is a tale of an American airman sent by a storm (like Padway) to Saga Age Iceland; in this instance, the outcome proves tragic due to cultural misunderstandings and a poor fit between the protagonist&#x27;s attempted innovations and local needs.

Another story inspired by &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot; is &quot;To Bring The Light&quot;, by David Drake, published together with the original in the 1996 Baen double &quot;Lest Darkness Fall and To Bring The Light&quot; and the 2011 anthology &quot;Lest Darkness Fall and Related Stories&quot;. This story features Flavia Herosilla, a well-educated woman living in ancient Rome at its height. Like Padway, she is sent back in time by a lightning strike, in her case to the era of Rome&#x27;s beginnings around 751 BC. Unlike Padway, who tries to change history, Flavia tries to recreate the founding of Rome based on the legends that she knows. But there is one detail she does want to change. The legends tell that on the day of Rome&#x27;s founding, Romulus killed his brother Remus - and while in the process of making sure that Rome will be founded, Flavia Herosilla had fallen in love with Remus.

Several editions of &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot;, including the one printed with &quot;To Bring the Light&quot;, repeat an error in the sequence where Padway and Julia from Apulia are setting up their one night stand: in the original text a somewhat inebriated Padway says Julia&#x27;s dirty feet form a barrier and &quot;I must lave the pedal extremities...&quot;. Apparently some editor failed to recognize &quot;lave&quot; as a synonym for &quot;wash&quot; and turned the word into &quot;have&quot;.

==Reception==
Jo Walton wrote, &quot;In 1939, L. Sprague de Camp came up with one of the wonderful ideas of science fiction, the man taken out of his time to a time of lower technology... As soon as Padway&#x27;s there, he puts his head down and starts to concentrate on what makes these books such fun—improvising technology from what he knows and can find around him. Padway starts with distilling and double-entry bookkeeping and makes his way up to newspapers and heliographs... The more you know history, the more you can see how clever the book is... De Camp was a historian of technology. His &quot;The Ancient Engineers&quot; (1963) is a... fascinating non-fiction book.&quot; Stating that it &quot;is an excellent introduction to Rome at the time of the Gothic invasion&quot;, Carl Sagan in 1978 listed &quot;Lest Darkness Fall&quot; as an example of how science fiction &quot;can convey bits and pieces, hints and phrases, of knowledge unknown or inaccessible to the reader&quot;.
Boucher and McComas praised the novel as &quot;a witty version of the Connecticut Yankee theme, distinguished by its lore of Gothic Rome.&quot; Algis Budrys termed it &quot;marvelous,&quot; rating it as &quot;Maybe the best [book] DeCamp ever wrote.&quot; P. Schuyler Miller wrote that &quot;Next to Wells&#x27;s &quot;Time Machine&quot;, this could be the best time-travel novel ever written.&quot;

<doc id="1217278" wikidata="Q1759628" url="?curid=1217278" title="Love and Human Remains">
<text>Love and Human Remains is a 1993 Canadian film directed by Denys Arcand and based on Brad Fraser&#x27;s stage play &quot;Unidentified Human Remains and the True Nature of Love&quot;. Fraser also wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation. The film version follows the story line of the original play fairly closely: a gay man and his heterosexual, female roommate (who sexually experiments by having sex with a lesbian) try to find love and sexual gratification in Edmonton, as a serial killer is loose in the city.

While the film was shot on location in Montreal, Quebec, the original stage play and the screenplay are both set in Edmonton, Alberta. There are attempts made in the dialogue, props and background film footage to identify the city as Edmonton, as in David&#x27;s remark, &quot;Let&#x27;s order a Rosebowl pizza and discuss your sexual crises&quot; (Rose Bowl Pizza was a well-known restaurant and bar in Edmonton). In another scene, the TV news reporter signs off from &quot;CFR-&quot; and gets cut off by the TV remote control before she can say &quot;-N&quot;, the final call letter of Edmonton&#x27;s CTV affiliate station. Sal&#x27;s remark, &quot;It&#x27;s chicken night at Flash&quot;, is an allusion to Flashbacks, a long-gone Edmonton gay bar. There&#x27;s also repeated use of a &quot;Sun&quot; newspaper (the &quot;Edmonton Sun&quot; is one of the city&#x27;s major daily newspapers, although the city&#x27;s name is not included in the masthead of the prop paper) and CBC-TV Canadian Football League footage of an Edmonton Eskimos game.

Fraser won a Genie Award for his adapted screenplay, while stars Mia Kirshner, Joanne Vannicola and Matthew Ferguson received acting nominations.

In 2011, it was finally released on Region 1 DVD from Sony Pictures Classic&#x27;s MOD service. It is also available in the UK on a Region 0 (&quot;region-free&quot;) PAL DVD issued by Arrow Films.

<doc id="1217286" wikidata="Q459902" url="?curid=1217286" title="Takahiro Sakurai">
<text>is a Japanese voice actor, narrator, and radio personality from Aichi Prefecture, Japan.
His well-known roles include heroes such as Cloud Strife in &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Suzaku Kururugi in &quot;Code Geass&quot;, X in &quot;Mega Man X&quot;, Arataka Reigen in &quot;Mob Psycho 100&quot;, Giyu Tomioka in &quot;Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba&quot;, and Burton in &quot;Ninjala&quot;, as well as villains such as Maximilien Robespierre in &quot;Le Chevalier D&#x27;Eon&quot;, Hiltz in &quot;&quot;, Sasori in &quot;Naruto Shippūden&quot;, Rohan Kishibe in &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable&quot;, and Suguru Geto in &quot;Jujutsu Kaisen&quot;. He voiced the main character Miyuki Kazuya in &quot;Ace of Diamond.&quot; He is the official Japanese dub voice for Robert Pattinson since &quot;Twilight&quot;. His range is tenor.

==Early life==
Sakurai is the eldest of three siblings born to a family that owned a rice shop. When he was a child, he became interested in voice acting after watching a television interview with a voice actor. He graduated from Okazaki Johsei High School. After graduating from Yoyogi Animation Academy in Nagoya and 81 Acting Institute, he made his official anime debut in 1996 with the TV animation series &quot;Bakusō Kyōdai Let&#x27;s &amp; Go!!&quot;. Sakurai stated that he would have taken over his family&#x27;s rice shop if he did not pursue voice acting.

==Career==
After moving on from the training school, he became a member of 81 Produce under the influence of his admiration for Toshihiko Seki. Even before his official debut, he had already received work in radio dramas and other projects during his time at the training school, but for a while after his debut, there was a period of time when he was unable to find work even after auditioning. In 1999, when he was 25 years old and wondering if he should quit voice acting, he got regular roles in two TV anime in a row, &quot;Digimon Adventure&quot; and &quot;Sensual Phrase&quot;, and in the same year, he sang his first character song in his first starring movie, &quot;Gate Keepers&quot;.

From August 31 to September 3, 2006, Sakurai appeared in &quot;Eternity&quot;, a stage play produced by the theater troupe Joy. Sakurai and Joy were accused of copyright infringement, as &quot;Eternity&quot; was based on Kōki Mitani&#x27;s stage play &quot;Tokyo Sunshine Boys&#x27; Trap&quot;. Sakurai, as well as his agency, 81 Produce, issued apologies.

On April 22, 2011, Sakurai won the &quot;Male Character Voice Award&quot; at Famitsu Awards 2010. In 2012, he won the &quot;Overseas Fan&#x27;s Award&quot; at the 6th Seiyu Awards.

In 2013, after a year of discussions with the record company, Sakurai announced on his radio show that he would be singing the character song for &quot;Shirokuma Cafe&quot;. In April, he announced on the radio show &quot;Cherry Bell Co., Ltd&quot; that he would be leaving 81 Produce, where he had worked since his debut, and going freelance. On July 20, 2014, it was announced on the official website that he became a member of INTENTION, founded by his friend Kenichi Suzumura.

On October 25, 2016, Sakurai stepped on the red carpet at the 27th Tokyo International Film Festival as John Paul in &quot;Genocidal Organ&quot; with Yuichi Nakamura as Clavis Shepherd. On October 25, 2018, he attended the 31st Tokyo International Film Festival as Metofies in &quot;&quot; with Mamoru Miyano as Haruo.

Sakurai lists people like Ryūsei Nakao, Chō, Ryōtarō Okiayu, Tomokazu Seki, and Minami Takayama as his favorite and respected voice actors, and he had a close relationship with Keiji Fujiwara in his private life. He is good at illustration and once wanted to be an illustrator. In addition to the eyecatching illustrations in &quot;Canvas 2: Niji Iro no Sketch&quot;, he was also a member of the key drawing staff for the final episode of &quot;Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2&quot;, and was credited as a logotype designer for the second season of &quot;Active Raid&quot;.

==Personal life==

Sakurai has been married to a former voice actress for nearly 20 years, which was not disclosed to the public until September 2022 after he acknowledged a report published by &quot;Shukan Bunshun&quot;. On October 26, 2022, &quot;Shukan Bunshun&quot; reported that Sakurai had been having an extramarital affair with a writer from his radio show, &quot;P.S. Genki Desu: Takahiro,&quot; which began in October 2013 and had been terminated suddenly on October 24, 2022, without any explanation of reasons given. The two had been in a relationship for 10 years, with them intending to marry; however, the writer had allegedly not been aware of Sakurai&#x27;s marital status until September 2022. On November 3, 2022, the chief of Second Shot, the company behind Sakurai&#x27;s radio show, apologized to the listeners, who were upset from Sakurai and the writer dating and having to listen to them on the radio show. In the same announcement, they cancelled preorders for a product originally set to be released in November 2022.

<text>Canadian Business is the longest-publishing business magazine based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and founded in 1927. The print edition terminated in the end of 2016. Beginning in January 2017, the magazine was published online only.

In October 2021, &quot;Canadian Business&quot; relaunched its print edition as a quarterly magazine.

==History and profile==
The magazine was founded in 1927. The first issue appeared in February 1928 as &quot;The Commerce of the Nation&quot;, the organ of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. The magazine was renamed &quot;Canadian Business&quot; in 1933. Canadian Business official association with the Chamber of Commerce ended in 1977, the position of official media partner is currently held by George Media&#x27;s &quot;The Canadian Business Journal&quot;. It is owned by Rogers Communications. The company acquired the magazine in 1994. The former owner was Maclean Hunter.

&quot;Canadian Business&quot; is published every second week, monthly in January, July and August. Its special annual issues include: the Rich 100 (highlighting the wealthiest Canadians), the Investor 500 (comparing the largest 500 publicly listed Canadian companies), All-Star Execs (about the best corporate executives), the MBA Report, and the Best and Worst Boards.

Its main direct competition comes from &quot;Report on Business Magazine&quot;, published by and inserted in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper, &quot;Financial Post Magazine&quot;, formerly &quot;National Post Business&quot;, published by and inserted in the &quot;National Post&quot; newspaper and &quot;The Canadian Business Journal&quot; business magazine published by George Media.

&quot;Profit&quot;, targeting small and mid-sized businesses, is a sister title under the same ownership.

On March 20, 2019, Rogers announced a deal to sell the magazine to St. Joseph Communications.

==Annual report on wealthiest Canadians==
For nearly 20 years, &quot;Canadian Business&quot; published an annual list of the &quot;100 Richest Canadians.&quot; The list was last published in 2017.

:&quot;See List of Canadians by net worth&quot;

===2008===
In 2008 the Canadian Business magazine&#x27;s annual report on the wealthiest Canadians calculated that the Irving family combined wealth rose 34 percent from 2007 to $US 7.11 billion. Only the Thompson family, with a net worth is $US 18.45 billion, are wealthier 

===2012===
In their annual report on Canada&#x27;s wealthiest, Canadian Business magazine described Ultra High Net Worth (UHNW) Canadians as having a very profitable year. The wealthiest are now among the 0.00028%, not just the 1%. Frank Stronach&#x27;s net was $US 2.72 Billion in 2011-2012. The Chan family&#x27;s net worth was $US 1.03 billion. JR Shaw&#x27;s net worth was $US 1.5 billion up 4.41 percent from last year.

<text>:&quot;&quot;Linear genetic programming&quot; is unrelated to &quot;linear programming&quot;.&quot;

Linear genetic programming (LGP) is a particular method of genetic programming wherein computer programs in a population are represented as a sequence of register-based instructions from an imperative programming language or machine language. The adjective &quot;linear&quot; stems from the fact that each LGP program is a sequence of instructions and the sequence of instructions is normally executed sequentially. Like in other programs, the data flow in LGP can be modeled as a graph that will visualize the potential multiple usage of register contents and the existence of structurally noneffective code (introns) which are two main differences of this genetic representation from the more common tree-based genetic programming (TGP) variant.
Like other Genetic Programming methods, Linear genetic programming requires the input of data to run the program population on. Then, the output of the program (its behaviour) is judged against some target behaviour, using a fitness function. However, LGP is generally more efficient than tree genetic programming due to its two main differences mentioned above: Intermediate results (stored in registers) can be reused and a simple intron removal algorithm exists that can be executed to remove all non-effective code prior to programs being run on the intended data. These two differences often result in compact solutions and substantial computational savings compared to the highly constrained data flow in trees and the common method of executing all tree nodes in TGP. Furthermore, LGP naturally has multiple outputs by defining multiple output registers and easily cooperates with control flow operations.

Linear genetic programming has been applied in many domains, including system modeling and system control with considerable success.

Linear genetic programming should not be confused with linear tree programs in tree genetic programming, program composed of a variable number of unary functions and a single terminal. Note that linear tree GP differs from bit string genetic algorithms since a population may contain programs of different lengths and there may be more than two types of functions or more than two types of terminals.

==Examples of LGP programs==

Because LGP programs are basically represented by a linear sequence of instructions, they are simpler to read and to operate on than their tree-based counterparts. For example, a simple program written to solve a Boolean function problem with 3 inputs (in R1, R2, R3) and one output (in R0), could read like this:

R4 = R2 AND R3
R0 = R1 OR R4
R0 = R3 AND R0
R4 = R2 AND R4 # This is a non-effective instruction
R0 = R0 OR R2

R1, R2, R3 have to be declared as input (read-only) registers, while R0 and R4 are declared as calculation (read-write) registers. This program is very simple, having just 5 instructions. But mutation and crossover operators could work to increase the length of the program, as well as the content of each of its instructions.

Note that one instruction is non-effective or an intron (marked), since it does not impact the output register R0. Recognition of those instructions is the basis for the intron removal algorithm which is used analyze code prior to execution. Technically, this happens by copying an individual and then run the intron removal once. The copy with removed introns is then executed as many times as dictated by the number of training cases. Notably, the original individual is left intact, so as to continue participating in the evolutionary process. It is only the copy that is executed that is compressed by removing these &quot;structural&quot; introns.

Another simple program, this one written in the LGP language Slash/A looks like a series of instructions separated by a slash:

input/ # gets an input from user and saves it to register F
0/ # sets register I = 0
save/ # saves content of F into data vector D[I] (i.e. D[0] := F)
input/ # gets another input, saves to F
add/ # adds to F current data pointed to by I (i.e. F := F + D[0])
output/. # outputs result from F

By representing such code in bytecode format, i.e. as an array of bytes each representing a different instruction, one can make mutation operations simply by changing an element of such an array.

<text>Marvin Daniel Levy (; born August 3, 1925) is an American former football coach and executive who was a head coach in the National Football League (NFL) for seventeen seasons. He spent most of his head coaching career with the Buffalo Bills, leading them from 1986 to 1997. After spending ten years as head coach in college, Levy was hired to coach the Montreal Alouettes of Canadian Football League (CFL) in 1973. From 1973 to 1977, he won two Grey Cup titles with Montreal.

After five seasons coaching the Kansas City Chiefs, Levy helped the Bills become one of the most dominant American Football Conference (AFC) teams during the 1990s. His greatest success occurred between 1990 and 1993 when he led Buffalo to a record four consecutive Super Bowls, although each game ended in defeat. Levy concluded his head coaching career with 11 playoff victories and four Super Bowl appearances, both of which are the most of head coaches to not win an NFL championship.

After retiring from coaching in 1997, Levy served as the general manager of the Bills from 2006 to 2007. He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2001 and the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 2021.

==Early life==
Levy was born to a Jewish family in Chicago on August 3, 1925.

In 1943, the day after graduation from South Shore High School in Chicago, Levy enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces. He served as a meteorologist at Apalachicola Army Airfield in Franklin County, Florida, but the war ended before his unit deployed to the Pacific.

Though he was known to use historical examples to inspire his teams, Levy corrected those who used war and combat metaphors to describe football games by telling them that he actually fought in a war (despite not being deployed) and that football, and war were in no way comparable. Referring to the Super Bowl, he said &quot;This is not a must-win; World War II was a must-win&quot;. Steve Tasker, who played for Levy on the Bills, said

In later years, Levy became a supporter of the World War II Memorial and pushed for World War II veterans to be honored at Super Bowl LIV to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Allied victory in the war, noting that fewer than 3% of those who served in the war were still alive in 2020.

==Playing career==
Levy was initially recruited to the Wyoming Cowboys football team as a defensive back. The coach who recruited Levy left Wyoming, and Levy was displeased and exhausted by the following coach&#x27;s round-the-clock training regimen. He transferred to Coe College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa following a single semester.

At Coe College, Levy earned varsity letters in football, track, and basketball. He obtained a degree in English literature, was granted membership in Phi Beta Kappa society, and was twice voted student council president. He was also a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.

He was admitted to Harvard University for graduate studies in 1951, where he earned a Masters of Arts in English history.

==Coaching career==
Levy&#x27;s first coaching job was at St. Louis Country Day School, coaching football and basketball; he coached the school&#x27;s basketball team to a championship.

===College===
Two years later, Levy returned to Coe College as an assistant football coach (1953–1954). In his second stint as a head coach, he also won a championship in basketball; future NBA Coach Bill Fitch was one of his players.

In 1954, he joined the coaching staff at the University of New Mexico and was named head coach in 1958. In two seasons as head coach, he guided the Lobos to a 14–6 record and earned Skyline Conference Coach of the Year honors in 1958. He interviewed with the University of California, Berkeley on February 2, 1960, and was announced as the new head coach of the Cal Bears on February 5, 1960. Despite selecting a young Bill Walsh as a coaching assistant, Levy&#x27;s best record during his four-season tenure as head coach at Cal from 1960 to 1963 was 4–5–1.

He finished his college coaching career with a five-year stint as head coach at the College of William &amp; Mary where he twice earned Southern Conference Coach of the Year honors. In 1965 his team had the school&#x27;s first winning record in 12 years.

===Professional===
====Philadelphia Eagles, Los Angeles Rams, and Washington Redskins====
Levy began his professional football coaching career in 1969 as kicking teams coach for the Philadelphia Eagles before joining George Allen&#x27;s staff as a special teams coach for the Los Angeles Rams in 1970. He followed Allen to Washington, D.C., in 1971, where he served as the Washington Redskins&#x27; special teams coach for two seasons.

====Canadian Football League====
Levy then served as the head coach of the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League for five seasons. He coached Montreal to three CFL Grey Cup appearances and two championships, and won the Annis Stukus Trophy (Coach of the Year) in 1974.

====Kansas City Chiefs====
Levy returned to the NFL in 1978 as head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs. He coached the Chiefs for five seasons with steady improvement each year, but was fired at the end of the strike-shortened 1982 season with a 3–6 record.

====Buffalo Bills====
Midway through the 1986 season, following a two-year hiatus from coaching and one season as the head coach of the Chicago Blitz of the USFL, Levy returned to the NFL with the Buffalo Bills. Initially hired as a television analyst, Levy replaced Hank Bullough seven games into the regular season as head coach. He finished the season with a 2–5 record.

In 1987, his first full season with the Bills, the team returned to respectability with a 7–8 record and were in the playoff hunt throughout most of the season. The following season the team posted a 12–4 record and won the first of six AFC Eastern Division titles.

With his high-powered &quot;no-huddle&quot; offense, Levy&#x27;s Bills went on to make four consecutive Super Bowl appearances from 1990 to 1993, the most in league history. Each game ended in defeat, however, tying Levy with Bud Grant and Dan Reeves for the most Super Bowl appearances without a victory. Nonetheless, he is credited with changing the franchise&#x27;s culture. When the Bills won the 1988 AFC East title, it was only the Bills&#x27; fourth playoff appearance since the AFL-NFL merger and their fifth winning season since winning two consecutive AFL titles in 1964 and 1965.

From 1988 through 1997, the Bills were first in the AFC in winning percentage and second only to the San Francisco 49ers in the NFL. Levy, the winningest coach in Bills&#x27; history, recorded a 112–70 regular season record and was 11–8 in the playoffs during his eleven seasons with the Bills. He was named NFL Coach of the Year in 1988 and AFC Coach of the Year in 1988, 1993, and 1995.

Levy retired after the 1997 season, when he felt that it was time to rest, doing so despite the pleas of Wilson to stay. He later stated that he regretted the decision. He later became an analyst for NFL.com. In 2001, Levy was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio. Along with former Bills&#x27; special-teamer Steve Tasker, Levy did local broadcasts for the Bills&#x27; pre-season games from 1998 until being appointed the Bills&#x27; general manager in 2006. During the regular season he was a part of the Chicago Bears pregame show on ESPN Radio 1000 (WMVP-AM), as well as a Bears postgame show on Comcast SportsNet.

Early in his tenure with the Bills, an emotional Levy gathered the team around him and exclaimed, &quot;Where else would you rather be than right here, right now?&quot; The question became a standard part of Levy&#x27;s pregame routine, and was adopted as a battle cry by the Bills during their resurgence under Sean McDermott. Before each game, a Bills legend leads the crowd at Highmark Stadium in the chant.

===General manager===
On January 5, 2006, Bills owner Ralph Wilson enlisted Levy, at the age of 80, to act as general manager and vice president of football operations for the Buffalo Bills. Following the resignation of Mike Mularkey, there was initial speculation (created by Levy&#x27;s own comments at a team press conference) that Levy would resume a coaching role with the team. To eliminate this speculation, and to minimize any future tension between Levy and the Bills&#x27; new head coach, team owner Wilson said: &quot;He was hired to be the GM and would never coach the team.&quot;

Levy&#x27;s first order of business was to hire a new coach as a replacement for Mularkey, who resigned within days of Levy&#x27;s appointment. After a strenuous interview process Levy and team owner Wilson hired Detroit Lions interim head coach Dick Jauron as coach. Jauron had been head coach of the Chicago Bears.

===Post-coaching career===
Following the Bills&#x27; last game of the 2007 season, Levy decided to step down as general manager of the Bills following the expiration of his two-year contract.

He returned to live in his native Chicago, although he also spent some time in Montreal mentoring then-Alouettes head coach Marc Trestman. Levy stated he would be open to returning to coaching if asked.

In 2000, Levy appeared as a studio analyst at Fox NFL Sunday. In 2002, he was color commentator for the NFL on FOX with Ron Pitts for select games.

In 2009, Levy collaborated with Buffalo football historian Jeffrey J. Miller to write a book entitled &quot;Game Changers: The Greatest Plays in Buffalo Bills Football History&quot;.

In August 2011, Levy published a second book, &quot;Between the Lies&quot;, featuring a team based loosely on the Bills and including a quarterback named &quot;Kelly James&quot; progressing to the Super Bowl against a Los Angeles-based team and its take-no-prisoners head coach, while a scandal erupts, placing the integrity of the game at risk.

A lifelong Chicago Cubs fan, Levy was among a select few people in attendance at both the 1945 World Series, which he attended while on furlough from the Army Air Forces, and the Cubs&#x27; next appearance, the 2016 World Series.

Levy&#x27;s fourth book, the children&#x27;s book &quot;Go Cubs Go&quot;, is about the 2016 series.

In 2017, he said that he has not paid much attention to professional football in the past several years as of 2017.

In 2020, Levy assisted The Friends of the National World War II Memorial to convince NFL teams—and the league itself—to recognize the 75th anniversary of the war, honoring veterans at Super Bowl LIV in Miami.

In 2021, he was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame.

In 2022, Levy appeared at the Bills&#x27; home opener along with Jim Kelly, his former quarterback. Kelly passed the mic to Levy, who led the crowd in the &quot;right here, right now&quot; chant. On January 19, 2025, he delivered a pre-recorded message of well-wishes to the Bills squad ahead of its playoff game with the Baltimore Ravens.

==Personal life ==
Levy and his wife Mary have a daughter, Kim, and two grandchildren Angela (oldest) and George (youngest). Following the death of Art McNally on January 1, 2023, Levy became the oldest living Pro Football Hall of Fame member.

Levy is a vegetarian.

<text>Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport is an international airport serving Ho Chi Minh City, the most populous city in Vietnam. The airport is located in the Tân Bình district within the Ho Chi Minh City metropolitan area. 

It is the busiest airport in Vietnam, with 32.5 million passengers in 2016, 38.5 million passengers in 2018, and about 41 million passengers in 2023. As of December 2023, it is the 50th-busiest airport in the world, and the fourth-busiest in Southeast Asia. As of April 2024, it has a total capacity of only around 30 million passengers, which has caused constant and increasing traffic and congestion, hence it has sparked debates for expanding or building a new airport, of which the plan of the new airport as an alternative is under construction since 2021, and will be completed by the first half of 2026.

Of the routes the airport serves, the domestic Ho Chi Minh City–Hanoi route is the busiest in Southeast Asia and the fourth-busiest in the world, serving around 11 million passengers in 2023. Its IATA airport code, SGN, is derived from the city&#x27;s former name of Saigon.

==History==
===Early history and Vietnam War era===
Tan Son Nhat International Airport has its origins in the early 1930s when the French colonial government constructed a small airport with unpaved runways, known as Tân Sơn Nhứt Airfield near the village of Tan Son Nhut. 

By mid-1956, with U.S. aid, a runway had been built; the airfield near Saigon became known as South Vietnam&#x27;s principal international gateway. During the Vietnam War (or Second Indochina War), Tan Son Nhut Air Base (then using the Southern spelling &quot;Tân Sơn Nhứt&quot;) was an important facility for both the U.S. Air Force and the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. Between 1968 and 1974, Tan Son Nhut Airport was one of the busiest military airbases in the world. Pan Am schedules from 1973 show that during the last days of South Vietnam, Boeing 747 service was being operated four times a week to San Francisco via Guam and Manila. Continental Airlines operated up to 30 Boeing 707 military charters per week to and from Tan Son Nhut Airport during the 1968–74 period.

===Post-war era===
On 9 December 2004, United Airlines became the first U.S. airline to fly to Vietnam since Pan Am&#x27;s last flight during the Fall of Saigon in April 1975. Flight UA 869, operated using a Boeing 747-400 landed at Ho Chi Minh City, the terminus of the flight that originated from San Francisco via Hong Kong. On 29 October 2006, this service was switched from San Francisco to Los Angeles with a stop in Hong Kong, operating as UA 867 (also using a 747–400). In 2009, the service UA 869 has resumed once again from San Francisco via Hong Kong International Airport. United ended the route to San Francisco via Hong Kong on 30 October 2011. The airline resumed the route from Ho Chi Minh City to Hong Kong after its merger with Continental Airlines. The flight until suspended, no longer made a stop at San Francisco and was flown on a Boeing 777-200ER instead of the 747-400.

In 2006, Tan Son Nhat International Airport served approximately 8.5 million passengers (compared with 7 million in 2005) with 64,000 aircraft movements. It has recently accounted for nearly two-thirds of the arrivals and departures at Vietnam&#x27;s international gateway airports. Due to increasing demand (about 15–20% per annum), the airport has been continuously expanded by the Southern Airports Corporation.

In 2010, Tan Son Nhat domestic terminal handled 8 million passengers, its maximum capacity. The airport reached its full capacity of 20 million passengers in 2013, two years earlier than predicted. Both domestic and international terminal are being expanded to meet the increasing demand. In December 2014, expansion for the domestic terminal was finished, boosting the terminal&#x27;s capacity to 13 million passengers per annum. In September 2017, People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam ceded 21 hectare of military land in the vicinity of the airport to Airports Corporation of Vietnam for civil use. This gave way for the construction of 21 new aircraft parking spaces, expected to be completed by Tet holidays in 2018. Tan Son Nhat will then have 72 parking spaces for airplanes.

Of the routes the airport serves, the Ho Chi Minh City–Hanoi route is the busiest in Southeast Asia and the seventh busiest in the world, serving 6,769,823 customers in 2017.

==Terminals and other facilities==
===Passenger terminals===
====Terminal 1====
Until the opening of the International Terminal in 2007, the domestic terminal was the sole civilian terminal of the airport. The French Indochinese administration built the original terminal. It initially covered an area of . Between 1954 and 1975 when the airport quickly became one of the busiest airports in the world, it was expanded 4 more times: in 1956, 1960, 1963 (which was handled by the contractor RMK-BRJ), and 1969. By 1972, the terminal grew to in space with a capacity of 1.5 million passengers a year.

In recent history, after years of constant expansion to meet growing traffic, the terminal&#x27;s handling capacity increased tenfold to 15 million passengers a year as of 2023. It has a floor area of with 20 boarding gates (4 aerobridge gates and 16 remote gates).

The terminal has two lounges: Lotus Lounge and Le Saigonnais Lounge.

====Terminal 2====
A new international terminal, constructed by a consortium of four Japanese contractors (KTOM, abbreviation of four contractors&#x27; names: Kajima – Taisei – Obayashi – Maeda), opened in December 2007 with an initial designed capacity of 10 million passengers a year. The terminal was funded by Japanese official development assistance at a cost of 219 million USD. Following the opening of its new international terminal in September 2007, Tan Son Nhat has two major terminal buildings with separate sections for international and domestic flights.

In 2014, the terminal served over 9 million international passengers and a demand of an expansion to the terminal was in sight. Plan for a 109 million-USD expansion of the international terminal was approved in August 2014. The first phase of an urgent expansion to the terminal was finished in December 2016 with the addition of 2 new jet bridges and other facilities. Upon the completion of phase two in 2018, the terminal has a floor area of and 26 boarding gates, and can handle 13 million passengers annually.

There are a total of five passenger lounges situated in the International Terminal: Lotus Lounge 1 and 2, Le Saigonnais, Orchid Lounge, and Rose Business Lounge.

The terminal is connected to Terminal 1 by an outdoor walkway on the landside.
====Terminal 3====

A new passenger terminal for the airport broke ground on 24 December 2022. The new terminal will include 27 gates (13 jetbridges and 14 remote gates) for an annual handling capacity of 20 million passengers. The terminal building will have a total floor area of , and will be connected with a new non-aviation services and parking complex by footbridges. The project has a budget of 10,986 billion VND (US$467.6 million) and was projected to be completed by the end of 2024, which is now slated to be completed by April 2025. Upon completion, the terminal will serve domestic flights to support the current domestic terminal.

===Cargo terminal===
Tan Son Nhat Airport currently has three cargo terminals. Two of them (Air Freight Terminal 1 and 2) are operated by Tan Son Nhat Cargo Services (TCS) and the other one is operated by Saigon Cargo Services Corporation (SCSC). These facilities have a handling capacity of 700,000 tonnes of cargo per year combined.

TCS&#x27;s Air Freight Terminal 1 was the first cargo terminal at the airport. It was inaugurated on January 1, 1997. In May 2012, Air Freight Terminal 2 was opened after 20 months of construction. The latter was built at a cost of $15 million and covers an area of .

The Prime Minister of Vietnam, by Decision 1646/TTg-NN, has approved the addition of of the adjacent area to extend the apron and to build a cargo terminal to handle the rapid increase of passenger (expected to reach 17 million in 2010, compared to 7 million and 8.5 million in 2005 and 2006 respectively) and cargo volume at the airport.

The SCSC cargo terminal was constructed from March 2009 to December 2010 at a cost of $50 million. The cargo handling area consists of a cargo terminal, of apron area, and of warehouse and other facilities.

===Runways and air control===
The airport has two parallel runways, namely 07L/25R, and 07R/25L. Since the runways are only 365 meters apart, they are operated dependently. Due to the maximum processing capacity of the passenger terminals (about 3,600 passengers/hour), the runway system&#x27;s capacity is capped at 44 operations per hour. During peak seasons such as Tết, the hourly limit is extended to 48 operations.

The original air traffic control tower is situated between present-day taxiway Y1 and S5. It was originally built in 1949 before being rebuilt in 1959. During the Tet Offensive in 1968, the tower was damaged by a rocket and a new tower was built in June 1969.

A new 70-meter (230-feet) tall air control tower was put into use in 2013. The new airport control tower is situated in the corner area between the Domestic Terminal and the International Terminal.

There were four USAF ATRC facilities in Viet Nam in the 1960-1973 era. The one located on Tan son Nhut was designated Paris ATRC. Patty was located down in the Delta, there was one in Da Nang, and Pyramid was in the highlands. Paris operated on the top Dias inside the radar facility located mid-base with the US Army&#x27;s Recovery and ground radio operations. The USAF 2027th Communications Squadron staffed the air traffic controllers that operate the scopes and handle all non-civilian in-country fixed wing radar traffic 24-7. Once Tan Son Nhut radar traffic got within 15 miles of the base it was normally handed off to Approach Control for sequencing and landing, which operated inside the air control tower. Usually none of the local helicopter traffic was under radar control; it was basically flown VFR and was based at Hotel 3. There was too much air traffic for controllers to be able to handle anything but fixed wing. In 70-71 VNAF controllers were introduced to work alongside the 2027th squadron&#x27;s controllers to help with communication with pilots who did not speak English.

==Ground transportation==
===Bus and shuttle===
A bus station is situated in front of the international terminal and is served by Ho Chi Minh City Bus. It is connected to the city center by bus line 109 and 152 as well as shuttle bus line 49. Connecting the airport to Vung Tau and other cities in Mekong Delta are express minibus services as well as bus line 119 (via Mien Tay Bus Station).

===Metro===
The airport is expected to be served by Ho Chi Minh City Metro Line 4B, connected to Line 4 and 5 with services to the southern and eastern area of the city. However, it is currently not known when the line will be constructed.

===Taxi===
There are several options for getting a taxi from the airport to the city

* Main taxi queue. Traditional taxi brands such as Vinasun and Mai Linh operate at the airport alongside Grab, a ridesharing company.
* Other taxi counters are also available in the terminal building, including SASCO, ACV Unico, Sand ong Viet.

===Road===
Until 2016, the airport only had one main access route via Trường Sơn Street, which caused chronic congestion for traffic going in and out of the airport. As an effort to ease traffic bottleneck, in August 2016, Phạm Văn Đồng Boulevard officially opened and connected the airport to National Route 1 in an intersection east of the airport.

The new terminal 3 building will be accessible via a new road connecting the existing Trần Quốc Hoàn Street and Cộng Hòa Street. This new connector road is expected to alleviate the traffic pressure surrounding the airport area and provide an alternative exit from the airport to the west side of the city.

==Accidents and incidents==
Throughout its history there have been several incidents that happened at the airport, some of the most notable are summarized below:
*On 4 April 1975, a Lockheed C-5A Galaxy, operated by the United States Air Force as part of Operation Babylift en route to Clark Air Base in the Philippines, crashed on approach during an emergency landing. Out of 328 people on board (311 passengers and 17 crew members), 155 were killed.
*On 12 January 1991, a Vietnam Airlines-operated Tupolev Tu-134, registration VN-A126, with 76 passengers on board crashed on final approach to Ho Chi Minh City. At , the Tupolev suddenly lost height and landed hard, touched down with the left main gear first. There were no casualties but the aircraft was written off due to substantial damage.
*On 4 September 1992, Vietnam Airlines Flight 850, an Airbus A310-300 en route from Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City, was hijacked by Ly Tong, a former pilot in the Republic of Vietnam Air Force. Tong proceeded to drop anti-communist leaflets over Ho Chi Minh City before parachuting out of an emergency exit. Vietnamese security forces arrested him on the ground two hours later. The aircraft landed safely, and no one on board was injured.
*On 20 November 2014, the 3-unit uninterruptible power supply of Ho Chi Minh City Area Air Control Center went offline, causing a blackout to the center that oversees air traffic from and to Tan Son Nhat from 11:05 AM to 12:19 PM. This incident also disabled the radar system, halting air traffic control capabilities. Overall, 92 flights were affected; 54 of them were within Ho Chi Minh flight information region and 8 were preparing to land at Tan Son Nhat at the time of the incident. No air traffic accident occurred and operations fully resumed by noon the next day.
*On 22 April 2017, Tan Son Nhat International Airport was the site of an alleged terrorist attack. Two remotely controlled petrol bombs were planted at the airport, one in the International Terminal while the other was placed in the airport&#x27;s parking garage. The bomb in the terminal failed to detonate due to internal sabotage. The bomb in the garage initially also failed to detonate because the activator was out of range. It was subsequently moved and set off in the International Terminal&#x27;s departure hall where the first bomb was originally placed. No one was injured nor killed in the attack. A total of 15 people were arrested for involvement in the attack, according to the Vietnamese state media.

==Future plans==
===New airport===

Tan Son Nhat International Airport is located inside the crowded urban core of Ho Chi Minh City, making expansions difficult. In a report submitted to the Vietnamese National Assembly in 2015, legislators deemed continued expansion of Tan Son Nhat problematic in five aspects. Firstly, it would be more economically viable to build a new airport rather than extensively upgrade Tan Son Nhat. An estimated US$9.1 billion was reportedly needed for a new 4,000 m runway, a new passenger terminal and other facilities at Tan Son Nhat. Secondly, Tan Son Nhat airspace overlaps with that of Bien Hoa Airport, which is currently reserved for national defense purpose. A reduction in military activities in Bien Hoa is considered to be temporary and unsustainable. At the same time, Tan Son Nhat also acts as a strategic location in national defense; therefore, the airport cannot be used entirely for civic air transport. Additionally, due to its urban location, aside from increasing ground traffic stress in its access points, the airport cannot operate between midnight and 5AM in accordance to the International Civil Aviation Organization sustainable development goals, further limiting its capability.

However, Ho Chi Minh City People&#x27;s Assembly believed that building a new airport can be impractical and unrealistic, giving that the numbers supporting the new airport are &quot;wrong calculations, magical stats&quot; to &quot;trick others with a purpose of serving their own designs.&quot; The cost of construction is too high in the midst of already-suppressed national debt, stressing the people without fully-diagnosed value. It is believed that the delay of the expansion is due to the military-run golf course at the north of the airport, where the land is listed as &quot;defense land.&quot; Ho Chi Minh City hired an independent French consultant firm ADPi to evaluate the suggestions. The firm supported the idea of expansion at first, but then called off and delayed its final statement, and finally released a report to support the new airport proposition. The city&#x27;s Assembly responded that the report was rigged.

Following Decision 703/QĐ-TTg by the Vietnamese Prime Minister in July 2005, a new airport—Long Thanh International Airport—was planned to replace Tan Son Nhat airport for international departure use. The initial master plan for the new airport was publicly announced in December 2006. The new airport will be built in Long Thành District, Đồng Nai Province, about east of Ho Chi Minh City and north of the petroleum-focused city of Vung Tau, near Highway 51A.

According to the approved modified plan in 2011, Long Thanh International Airport will be constructed on an area of , and will have four runways (4,000 m x 60 m or 13,100 ft x 200 ft) and be capable of receiving the Airbus A380. The project will be divided in three stages. Stage One calls for the construction of two parallel runways and a terminal with a capacity of 25 million passengers per year, due to be completed in 2020. Stage Two is scheduled for completion in 2030, giving the airport three runways, two passenger terminals and a cargo terminal designed to receive 1.5 million metric tons of cargo and 50 million passengers per year. The final stage is scheduled to be initiated after 2035, envisioned to handle 100 million passengers, 5 million metric tons of cargo annually on an infrastructure of four runways and four passenger terminals. The total budget for the first stage alone was estimated to be US$6.7 billion.

====After the opening of Long Thanh International Airport====
In accordance with the master planning of Vietnam&#x27;s network of airports, Tan Son Nhat will continue to operate after the opening of Long Thanh International Airport. In the feasibility report for Long Thanh, Airports Corporation of Vietnam proposed that, for international carriers, only low-cost carriers would fly out of Tan Son Nhat, while for Vietnamese carriers, only short-haul international flights and selected domestic routes would be operated out of the airport. In another report, the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam presented a different approach to the division of flights between the two airports. As such, Tan Son Nhat would only serve flights under 1000 km operated by Code C aircraft or smaller.

===Expansion===
Because Long Thanh will not be ready for service until at least 2025, Tan Son Nhat must expand to meet the increasing demand. In January 2017, Airport Design and Construction Consultancy (ADCC) presented three proposals to expand the airport. Vietnam&#x27;s Deputy Prime Minister Trịnh Đình Dũng agreed to proceed a US$860 million upgrade proposal for final review before submitting to the government. Under the chosen proposal, there would be a new mixed-use Terminal 3 and a civil-use Terminal 4 (to be built on the south side of the airport), a parallel taxiway between the existing runways and technical hangars on the northeast. The estimated time to complete the upgrade would be three years and the airport would then have a capacity of 43–45 million passengers annually. The decision was controversial due to the fact that the golf course immediately north of SGN would remain untouched despite the urgent need of airport expansion. The Minister of Transport Trương Quang Nghĩa explained that the airport could not be expanded northward due to costs and environmental impact. On 12 June 2017, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc requested the Ministry of Transport to research the prospect of constructing a third runway at Tan Son Nhut International Airport. The French consulting company ADP Ingénierie (ADPi) was subsequently hired to provide a second opinion for the project.

In March 2018, ADPi presented their plan for the expansion. The firm advised against the construction of a third runway and supported a southward expansion plan. Without a new runway, Tan Son Nhat has a maximum capacity of 51 million passengers per year – a number ADPi predicted SGN to reach in 2025, in time for the opening of Long Thanh. However, an independent consultancy of Ho Chi Minh City believed it could reach up to 80 million by the time Long Thanh was supposed to open, in accordance with reports by Boeing or the International Air Transport Association. As such, they proposed a three-phase northward expansion plan that would see a new runway and two new terminals to increase the airport&#x27;s capacity to 70 million passengers per year.

On 28 March 2018, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc ultimately selected the ADPi proposal as the basis for the expansion of the airport. This proposal includes a new Terminal 3 with a designed capacity of 20 million passengers per year south of Runway 07R/25L, additional facilities in the north area where a golf court currently occupies as well as improvements and constructions of access points for the airport.

<text>is a Japanese voice actor from Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Some of his major roles include Seiji Hayami in &quot;Cutie Honey Flash&quot;, Chiaki Nagoya in &quot;Phantom Thief Jeanne&quot;, Sai Fujiwara in &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot;, Jetfire and Wheeljack in &quot;&quot;, Chairman Muranishi in &quot;Kirarin Revolution&quot;, Isao Kondo in &quot;Gin Tama&quot;, Sideways in &quot;&quot;, Shō Sai in &quot;The Story of Saiunkoku&quot;, Hans in &quot;Nijū Mensō no Musume&quot;, Takuma Ichijo in &quot;Vampire Knight&quot;, Welkin Gunther in &quot;Valkyria Chronicles&quot;, and Ryuu Daikouji in &quot;Little Battlers Experience&quot;. He is currently affiliated with Office Osawa.

==Biography==
When Chiba was in college, he joined a production company because he was interested in acting and wanted to try something different from his baseball career. At the production company, he studied basic theatrical skills, but rather than studying acting with the aim of becoming an actor, he was more interested in &quot;having fun&quot; with his friends. He was not satisfied with the lessons offered by the production company, and he began to organize study sessions with volunteers. At this point, he was still thinking of acting and work as &quot;separate things.&quot; It wasn&#x27;t until he moved to Office Osawa, which handles a lot of narration work, that he became fully aware of voice acting as a profession.

His first job involved narrating a commercial. The role that left the deepest impression on him was the role he played in the TV anime &quot;Hikaru no Go&quot;, as Fujiwara no Sai. Since he had read the original manga, when he heard the news of the anime adaptation, he auditioned wondering who was going to play which role, later finding out he was going to play Sai, which felt strange for him. He was very enthusiastic about playing Sai, but on the other hand, he felt that it was not his role. Even when he watched reruns of the anime, he had the feeling that it wasn&#x27;t his voice, and although Sai was the role of an insubstantial being, Chiba felt the same way about himself.

<text>Three Chinese Poets is a book of poetry by the titular poets Wang Wei, Li Bai and Du Fu translated into English by Vikram Seth. The Three Poets were contemporaries and are considered to be amongst the greatest Chinese poets by many later scholars. The three have been described as a Buddhist recluse, a Taoist immortal and a Confucian sage respectively. Though this trichotomy has been criticised as simplistic and artificial, it can act as a guiding approximation. They lived in the Tang dynasty and the political strife at that time affected all of their lives very much and this impact is evident in the poetry of all three.

It is not clear whether Wang Wei and Li Bai ever met, but they had a mutual friend in Meng Haoran. Li Bai and Du Fu did meet and in fact Du Fu greatly admired Li Bai.

In the introduction of &quot;Three Chinese Poets&quot;, Seth talks about the influence of translations on his life and work; that while sometimes he has been so moved by a translation that he learnt another language to read the original, he doubts that he would ever be able to do this as much as he wished to. However, he says that Charles Johnston&#x27;s translation of Aleksandr Pushkin&#x27;s Eugene Onegin, Richard Wilbur&#x27;s translation of Molière&#x27;s Tartuffe and Robert Fitzgerald&#x27;s translation of the Iliad have helped him enter worlds without which would have been out of his reach. He states that he avoided the style and philosophy of the famous translations by Ezra Pound which was to read and deeply understand a poem then to create an approximate translation inspired by the original - the judge of the merit being whether the new poem is a good poem in the new language. Instead he wanted to follow the example of the translators mentioned above to retain a greater fidelity and to try to preserve structure such as rhyme. He stresses that while he has tried not to lose meaning, he has often failed, explaining that because each word is much more important in poetry, the problem of losing associations of words is much greater than when translating prose. He also makes note that any satisfaction derived from the tonality of the poems is necessarily lost because of the non-tonality of English.
