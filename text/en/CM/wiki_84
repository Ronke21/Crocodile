<text>Lorenzo di Credi (1456/59 – January 12, 1537) was an Italian Renaissance painter and sculptor best known for his paintings of religious subjects, and portraits. With some excursions to nearby cities, his whole life was spent in Florence. He is most famous for having worked in the studio of Andrea del Verrocchio at the same time as the young Leonardo da Vinci, who seems to have influenced his style considerably.

He trained with Verrocchio, and became his principal assistant, inheriting the workshop after his master&#x27;s death in 1488, when Lorenzo was still in his twenties. He largely continued his master&#x27;s style, working until at least the 1520s, by which time he was becoming rather old-fashioned. He does not seem to have painted frescos himself, although his workshop may have done so. Vasari says that he avoided large paintings of all sorts, preferring to create smaller works with a meticulous finish. 

==Life==
Lorenzo was born in Florence in 1456 or 1459 to a goldsmith named Andrea d&#x27; Oderigo. He was apprenticed to the leading master Andrea del Verrocchio, where he is first recorded, on low wages, in 1480/81. He eventually became Verrocchio&#x27;s primary assistant, running the shop during the master&#x27;s absence in 1482-1483, and inherited his workshop on Verrocchio&#x27;s death in 1488. On Verrocchio&#x27;s behalf he completed the famous &quot;Madonna di Piazza&quot; for Pistoia Cathedral, commissioned from Verrocchio in 1475 but executed by Lorenzo between 1485 and 1491.

Lorenzo&#x27;s earliest independent works include an &quot;Annunciation&quot; in the Uffizi, two panels of the &quot;Madonna and Child&quot; at the Galleria Sabauda in Turin, another at the National Gallery in London and &quot;Adoration of the Child&quot; at the Pinacoteca Querini Stampalia in Venice. From his maturity date the &quot;Madonna and Child with Saints Julian and Nicholas&quot; (1493) for the Mascalonzi chapel at the Cestello, Florence (Paris, Louvre), the &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot; (1487) for Santa Chiara (now at the Uffizi) and the &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot; for the Chiostro dello Scalzo (now Fiesole, San Domenico). In 1501 he remade parts of Fra Angelico&#x27;s high altarpiece for San Domenico, Fiesole. Later works include an altarpiece (1510–12) for the Ospedale del Ceppo, Pistoia (now in that town&#x27;s Museo Civico) and many small religious panels, including an unfinished &quot;Crucifixion&quot; at Göttingen University and an &quot;Annunciation&quot; dated 1508 at the Harvard University Art Museums.

Lorenzo was also a painter of portraits. His most famous is the &quot;Portrait of Caterina Sforza&quot;, called &quot;La dama dei gelsomini&quot;, at the Pinacoteca in Forlí. Caterina Sforza was the Lady of Forlì and Imola in the Romagna and later a prisoner of Cesare Borgia. Lorenzo&#x27;s portrait of her has been the subject of recent attention because of the sitter&#x27;s resemblance to the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; by Leonardo da Vinci. Another portrait by Lorenzo, perhaps of his brother&#x27;s widow is the panel now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The composition of this work is often compared to Leonardo&#x27;s &quot;Ginevra de&#x27; Benci&quot; at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.
Several of his patrons had links to Savonarola, and apart from portraits, secular subjects such as mythological ones are absent from his known works, except for a nearly nude &quot;Venus&quot; for the Medici family. In 1504 he was appointed to the committee set up to decide where to place Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot;.

Giorgio Vasari devoted a biography to Lorenzo di Credi in his &quot;Lives of the Artists&quot;. Though Vasari praised Lorenzo&#x27;s art for its high finish, he criticized him for being a perfectionist who was excessively diligent, ground his pigments too fine, and spent too much time distilling his oils.

Lorenzo had many pupils. His most important were Giovanni Antonio Sogliani, who assisted Lorenzo in many of his late works. Others include Tommaso di Stefano Lunetti and Antonio del Ceraiolo. Collaborators and followers included Giovanni di Benedetto Cianfanini, the Master of the Johnson Ascension of the Magdalene (named after a painting now in Philadelphia) and the anonymous artist known as &quot;Tommaso&quot; (also called Tommaso di Credi, the Master of the Czartoryski Tondo or the Master of the Santo Spirito Conversazione).

Lorenzo died in Florence in 1537.

==Sculptor?==
Lorenzo is usually described as a sculptor and, given his father&#x27;s profession and the important part sculpture played in Verrocchio&#x27;s workshop, he no doubt received training in it. But he seems to have worked largely or entirely in paint, though drawings are also attributed to him. The workshop probably continued to offer sculpture.

At the time of Verrocchio&#x27;s death in 1488, his workshop was in the middle of the very large commission for the Equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni for Venice. Verrocchio&#x27;s will recommended Lorenzo to the Venetian authorities to finish the job; at that point the statue seems only to have existed in clay, and casting had not begun. Lorenzo transferred his rights, such as they were, to another artist, apparently a &quot;bronze technician&quot;. It was eventually finished by the Venetian bronze sculptor Alessandro Leopardi several years later.

<text>Staff-Sergeant Joseph John Davies (28 April 1889 − 16 February 1976) was a British Army soldier and a British recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Davies was 27 years old, and a corporal in the 10th Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 20 July 1916 at Delville Wood, France, prior to an attack on the enemy, Corporal Davies and eight men became separated from the rest of the company. When the enemy delivered their second counterattack, the party was completely surrounded, but Corporal Davies got his men into a shell hole and by throwing bombs and opening rapid fire he succeeded in routing the attackers, and even followed and bayoneted them in their retreat.

He later achieved the rank of staff-sergeant. After demobilisation from the Regular Army he joined the 1st Battalion, The Herefordshire Regiment, Territorial Army (TA) regiment, until the mid 1920s.

His VC is displayed at the Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum in Caernarfon Castle, Gwynedd, Wales.

<doc id="1221598" wikidata="Q2429241" url="?curid=1221598" title="Weldiya">
<text>Weldiya or Woldia () is a town, woreda, and capital of the North Wollo Zone in the Amhara Region in northern Ethiopia. It has an elevation of 2112 meters above sea level and is surrounded by Guba Lafto woreda. Both are located north of Dessie and southeast of Lalibela.

A notable landmark is a church Weldiya Gebriel.

==History==

=== 19th century ===
When the missionary Johann Ludwig Krapf passed through Weldiya in April 1842, it was the headquarters of Dejazmach Faris Aligas and his brother Birru. They were absent at the time of Krapf&#x27;s visit, raiding the territories of Imam Liban of the Were Himano.

As early as 1890, Weldiya was the administrative center of Yejju Province. Its Tuesday market was well known for its mules.

=== 20th century ===
Weldiya was attacked in 1948 by farmers who were disgruntled after their appeals over their loss of land were ignored. They seized the prison in Weldiya and freed the prisoners. Despite this success, the revolt was eventually put down. On 16–17 November 1988 Weldiya was subjected to an aerial attack by the Derg, but no deaths were reported.

===21st century===

TPLF aligned fighters captured Weldiya on 11 August 2021, but it was recaptured in December 2021.

==Demographics==
Based on the 2007 national census conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), this town had a total population of 46,139, of whom 23,000 were male and 23,139 female. The majority of the inhabitants practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, with 80.49% reporting that as their religion, while 18.46% of the population said they were Muslim.

The 1994 national census reported a total population for Weldiya of 24,533 in 5,413 households, of whom 11,689 were male and 12,844 were female. The two largest ethnic groups reported in this were the Amhara (93.92%), and the Tigrayan (4.32%); all other ethnic groups made up 1.76% of the population. Amharic was spoken as a first language by 95.2%, and 3.75% spoke Tigrinya; the remaining 1.05% spoke all other primary languages reported. 79.75% of the population practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, and 19.44% of the population said they were Muslim.
==Education==
There is a rising university, Weldiya University, and about a dozen other governmental and private primary and secondary schools.

==Economy==
Travertine for use in building has been worked on a minor scale nearby.

==Transportation==
Woldia is connected by all weather roads to Addis Ababa and Mekelle by highway 2 and to Debre Tabor by highway 22.

The city will be served by two railways under construction: the Awash–Weldiya Railway and the Weldiya–Mekelle Railway, forming one line. The Station won&#x27;t be in Weldiya itself, but in Hara Gebeya (town about 17 km, station about 18 km east of Weldiya), which has only a third of Weldiya&#x27;s number of population.

==Sports==

The 25,155-capacity Woldia Stadium is located in Woldia. Two football clubs, Woldia City and Woldia SC, both use the venue for home games.

<text>The Honourable Raymond Harvey Lodge Joseph de Montmorency VC (5 February 1867 – 23 February 1900) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. (Also considered a Canadian recipient due to his place of birth).

==Early life career==
De Montmorency was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the eldest son and heir of Major-General Reymond de Montmorency, 3rd Viscount Frankfort de Montmorency, Irish representative peer, who served in the Crimean War, the Indian Rebellion, Abyssinia and the Mahdist War, and his wife Rachel Mary Lumley Godolphin Michel, daughter of Field Marshal Sir John Michel.

He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Lincolnshire Regiment on 14 September 1887, and transferred to the 21st Lancers as he was promoted to lieutenant on 6 November 1889.

==Details of Victoria Cross==

De Montmorency was 31 years old, and a lieutenant in the 21st Lancers (Empress of India&#x27;s), British Army during the Sudan Campaign when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

On 2 September 1898 at the Battle of Omdurman, Sudan, after the charge, Lieutenant de Montmorency returned to help an officer who was lying surrounded by a great many Dervishes. He drove the Dervishes off and finding that the officer was dead, put the body on his horse which then broke away. Captain Paul Aloysius Kenna and a corporal then came to his assistance and he was able to rejoin his regiment. His citation read:

<text>Norman Augustus Finch, VC (26 December 1890 – 15 March 1966) was a Royal Marines soldier and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and career==
Finch was born 26 December 1890 in Birmingham. He enlisted in the Royal Marines in January 1908 and received basic training at Eastney. For the next four years he served on various ships and shore stations and, in June 1913, was promoted to bombardier. This was soon followed by further rises to corporal in 1915 and sergeant in 1917. He joined the 4th Battalion on 23 March 1918.

==Victoria Cross==

Finch was 27 years old, and a sergeant in the Royal Marine Artillery, Royal Marines during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC).

On 22/23 April 1918 at Zeebrugge, Belgium, Sergeant Finch was second in command of the pom-poms and Lewis gun in the foretop of HMS &quot;Vindictive&quot;. At one period &quot;Vindictive&quot; was being hit every few seconds, but Sergeant Finch and the officer in command kept up a continuous fire, until two heavy shells made direct hits on the foretop killing or disabling everyone except Sergeant Finch who was, however, severely wounded. Nevertheless, he remained in his battered and exposed position, harassing the enemy on the Mole until the foretop received another direct hit, putting the remainder of the armament completely out of action. His award was by virtue of ballot.

==Later career and life==
Finch retired with the rank of quartermaster sergeant in December 1929, though returned to the Portsmouth Division in 1938. He appears to have spent most of the Second World War as quarter master, serving as a storekeeper officer (lieutenant) at 104 (Training) RM Brigade, R.M. Training Group Dalditch, then Devon. On 15 August 1945 he was released from service and in 1964 was made divisional sergeant major of HM Bodyguard of the Yeoman of the Guard. He died 15 March 1966.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Marines Museum in Southsea.

Finch was a Freemason and was initiated into Lodge of Hope No. 2153 at Portsmouth on 18 September 1918. He was subsequently a founding member of Royal Marine Portsmouth Lodge No. 6423 when it was consecrated on 23 April 1947, and was their first Senior Warden. The following year he was installed as their second Worshipful Master – on the thirtieth anniversary of the Zeebrugge Raid.

<text>Edmund De Wind, (11 December 1883 – 21 March 1918) was an Irish British Army officer during the First World War, and posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Both his native Northern Ireland and his adopted home of Canada count De Wind amongst the men of their militaries who have earned the VC.

==Background==
De Wind was born in Comber, County Down, Ireland on 11 December 1883 to Arthur Hughes De Wind, C.E., and Margaret Jane De Wind. He was educated at Campbell College and then went to work for the Bank of Ireland, Clones branch.

De Wind was living in Canada in 1914 and working for the Edmonton branch of the CIBC when World War I broke out. He served with The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada for a period of six months prior to his enlistment as a private on 16 November 1914 in the 31st Battalion-Alberta Regiment, Canadian Overseas Expeditionary Force. He arrived in France with 2nd Division of C.E.F. in September 1915. He saw action in the Battle of the Somme (1916) and at Vimy Ridge (1917). He earned a commission in September 1917 in the British Army.

==Victoria Cross==
As a 34-year-old Second Lieutenant in the 15th Battalion, The Royal Irish Rifles, he was awarded the VC for deeds committed during the 1918 Spring Offensive on 21 March 1918. He died on that day.

==Commemoration==

De Wind is commemorated by a pillar, bearing his name and date of death, commissioned by his mother and installed at the main entrance on the west front of St Anne&#x27;s Cathedral, Belfast. The entire west front, dedicated in 1927, forms a memorial to the Ulster men and women who served and died in the Great War. He is also named on the Pozières Memorial, in the Somme department of France, to the missing of the Fifth Army. There is a plaque memorial in his old school, Campbell College, Belfast. In his home town of Comber, he is commemorated by an Ulster History Circle blue plaque, unveiled in 2007.

Mount De Wind, Alberta, Canada, is named after him. A housing estate in Comber is also named in his honour.

<text>Frederick William Dobson, VC (9 November 1886 – 15 November 1935) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Dobson was 27 years old, and a private in the 2nd Battalion, Coldstream Guards, British Army during the First World War when the following deed at the First Battle of the Aisne took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 28 September 1914 at Chavonne, Aisne, France, Private Dobson twice volunteered to go out under heavy fire to bring in two wounded men. This undertaking involved crossing a good deal of open ground in full view of the enemy. Private Dobson, however, crawled out and found one of the men dead and the other wounded. He dressed the wounds and then crawled back, to return with a corporal and a stretcher, on to which they put the wounded man and then dragged him back to safety.

He later achieved the rank of lance-corporal. His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Coldstream Guards RHQ), Wellington Barracks in London.

==VC Commemoration==
As part of the United Kingdom national commemoration of the First World War memorial stones of VC recipients of that war were laid in their birthplaces. Dobson was born in Ovingham, Northumberland on 19 November 1886. Northumberland County Council organised a church service to unveil the VC Memorial Stone to Frederick Dobson VC on 27 September 2014.

<text>Sterling Campbell (born May 3, 1964) is an American drummer and songwriter who has worked with numerous high-profile acts, including the B-52s, Duran Duran, Soul Asylum, Cyndi Lauper, Nena, Grayson Hugh, Spandau Ballet, Gustavo Cerati, and David Bowie.

==Early life==
Campbell was born and raised in New York City, in an African-American family with five older brothers, all of whom enjoyed music from funk and Motown, to rock and beyond, where he began learning to play the drums at age twelve. When he was fourteen years old, then-drummer in David Bowie&#x27;s backing band, Dennis Davis, moved into the apartment building where Campbell&#x27;s family resided. Davis invited him to come with him to see a Bowie concert, galvanizing the student to apply himself further on the drum kit. He attended high school at the High School of Music &amp; Art (a part of the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts) from which he graduated. Campbell practiced, and composed his own songs, finding work as a session musician.

==Career==
Campbell rose to international attention in 1986, touring with Cyndi Lauper on her True Colors World Tour. For the next ten years, he played with several notable bands which drew from different genres. In 1989, Campbell joined Duran Duran, and later was hired first as a session player in 1991 by Soul Asylum, playing on half of the tracks on their 1992 release, &quot;Grave Dancer&#x27;s Union&quot; including their Grammy Award-winning single, &quot;Runaway Train&quot;. Campbell soon replaced Soul Asylum&#x27;s drummer Grant Young, and played with them from 1995 to 1998.

Campbell began recording with David Bowie in 1991 and later joined his band in 1992, touring with him for fourteen years, until the end of his A Reality Tour, in 2004. Campbell has worked with artists such as David Byrne, the B-52s, Chic, Tina Turner, Grayson Hugh and Gustavo Cerati. In 2007, he reunited with the B-52s and toured with the band into 2012.

==Human rights advocacy==
In 1996, Campbell began practicing Falun Gong, a form of meditative qigong practice whose followers are persecuted in China. He traveled to Beijing in 2002 to demonstrate against the suppression, and was allegedly detained and beaten by police. He has since continued to advocate for human rights in China.

<text>Humphrey Osbaldston Brooke Firman VC (24 November 1886 – 24 April 1916) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Firman was born at South Kensington in 1886 to Humphrey Brooke Firman, J.P. (of Gateforth, Selby, Yorkshire and New Malden, Surrey) and Florence Adelaide (née Cumming). He joined the Royal Navy as a cadet on 15 May 1901 and, as midshipman and sub-lieutenant, served on HMS Glory on the China Station, in the battleships HMS Albion and HMS Illustrious in the Channel Fleet, and in the Royal Yacht Victoria and Albert. Promoted to Lieutenant in 1908, he saw service in the Persian Gulf and off the Horn of Africa. During the First World War he was killed in action on the night of 24 April 1916 in Mesopotamia in an attempt to resupply the forces trapped in the Siege of Kut, at the age of 29. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his deeds, as was a fellow naval officer, Lieutenant Commander Charles Cowley R.N.V.R.

==Citation==
==Legacy==
In New Malden, Surrey, a plaque bearing his name was unveiled on the war memorial in April 2008, while Firman Close is named after him. A stone slab memorial to Firman is set into the pavement on the south side of South Kensington tube station and was unveiled on 25 April 2016. He is commemorated on the Basra Memorial.
His Victoria Cross is held at the York Castle Museum.

<text>Ernest Albert Egerton VC (10 November 1897 – 14 February 1966) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Egerton was born on 10 November 1897. When he was 19 years old, and a Corporal in the 16th Battalion, The Sherwood Foresters (The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment), British Army during the First World War, he was awarded the VC for his actions during the Battle of Passchendaele.

On 20 September 1917 southeast of Ypres, Belgium: ...during an attack, visibility was bad owing to fog and smoke. As a result, the two leading waves of the attack passed over certain hostile dugouts without clearing them and enemy rifles and machine-guns from these dugouts were inflicting severe casualties. Corporal Egerton at once responded to a call for volunteers to help in clearing up the situation and he dashed for the dugouts under heavy fire at short range. He shot a rifleman, a bomber and a gunner, by which time support had arrived and 29 of the enemy surrendered.

He later achieved the rank of sergeant. He served in the Home Guard in World War II and died on 14 February 1966.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Sherwood Foresters Museum in Nottingham Castle.

<text>George Gardiner (c. 1821 – 17 November 1891) was born in Clonallon, Warrenpoint, County Down and was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was about 34 years old, and a sergeant in the 57th Regiment of Foot (later The Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Own)), British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 22 March 1855 at Sebastopol, Crimea, Sergeant Gardiner acted with great gallantry upon the occasion of a sortie by the enemy, in having rallied the covering parties which had been driven in by the Russians, thus regaining the trenches. On 18 June during the attack on the Redan he himself remained and encouraged others to remain in the holes made by the explosions of the shells, and whence they were able to keep up a continuous fire until their ammunition was exhausted, and the enemy cleared away from the parapet.

He later achieved the rank of Colour-Sergeant. He died at Lifford, County Donegal, 17 November 1891. He is buried at Clonleigh Church of Ireland Churchyard, Lifford.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment (Queen&#x27;s and Royal Hampshires) &quot;(Dover Castle, England)&quot;.

<doc id="1221644" wikidata="Q7229775" url="?curid=1221644" title="Population Connection">
<text>Population Connection (formerly Zero Population Growth or ZPG) is a US-based non-profit organization that educates young people and advocates for progressive policies to stabilize world population at a level that can be sustained by Earth&#x27;s resources.

==History==
Population Connection was founded in 1968 under the name &quot;Zero Population Growth&quot; or ZPG by Paul R. Ehrlich, Richard Bowers, and Charles Remington in the wake of Paul and Anne Ehrlich&#x27;s influential but controversial book &quot;The Population Bomb&quot;. The organization adopted its current name in 2002.

==Issues and campaigns==
* Connections between population, health, and the environment, in the United States and around the world
* U.S. foreign assistance funding for international family planning
* U.S. funding for the domestic family planning program for low-income Americans, Title X
* Ending U.S. policies that restrict access to family planning and reproductive health care, including abortion, domestically (e.g. Hyde Amendment) and internationally (e.g. Mexico City policy, Helms Amendment, restrictions on funding for UNFPA)
* Comprehensive (as opposed to abstinence-only) sex education for American teens
* Development of material for introduction to K-12 curricula to &quot;educate American and Canadian students on population challenges&quot;.
* Publication of a quarterly magazine

==Criticisms==
Betsy Hartmann, author of &quot;Reproductive Rights and Wrongs&quot; in 1987 criticised ZPG for inciting fear of population growth that she claims led to millions of sterilizations in China, India, Mexico, Bolivia, Peru, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and elsewhere. Writing in &quot;On the Issues&quot; magazine in 2009, Hartmann said she received some &quot;junk mail&quot; from the organisation and commented that &quot;According to ZPG, you can blame just about everything on population growth, from traffic congestion, overcrowded schools and childhood asthma to poverty, famine and global warming.&quot; In her book &quot;The America Syndrome: Apocalypse, War, and Our Call to Greatness&quot;, Hartmann is again critical of the organization, noting that as the year 2000 millennium approached, the company launched a campaign that tried to link the birth of the world’s six billionth child to the coming Y2K global computer crash, a disaster that never materialized.

<text>Alfred Edward Gaby, VC (25 January 1892 – 11 August 1918) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Tasmania, Gaby worked as a farmer and then a labourer before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in 1916 and volunteering to serve overseas. Serving initially in the ranks, Gaby was quickly promoted, having previously served as a part-time soldier before the war, and was commissioned in 1917. He was one of 64 Australians to receive the award for their actions during the First World War, receiving it for his actions during an attack around Villers-Bretonneux in France during the Battle of Amiens that took place at the start of the Allied Hundred Days Offensive. He was killed three days later, at the age of 26, while leading another attack around Lihons.

==Early life==
Born in Springfield near Ringarooma, Tasmania, he was the seventh son of Alfred Gaby, a farmer, and his wife Adelaide, née Whiteway. While working on the family farm, he joined the militia and served for three years with the 12th Infantry Battalion (Launceston Regiment). Two of his brothers had served overseas during the Second Boer War.

==Military service==
Gaby was labouring in Katanning, Western Australia, when he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in January 1916. He had been twice previously rejected for enlistment. He embarked from Fremantle on board HMAT A38 &quot;Ulysses&quot; in April 1916, and was assigned to the 28th Battalion – an infantry battalion that was formed mainly from Western Australian recruits, which was assigned to the 7th Brigade, 2nd Division – as part of the unit&#x27;s tenth draft of reinforcements. Over the course of the next twelve months while in the frontline on the Western Front, he was promoted through the ranks at a rapid speed, reaching sergeant before being selected for officer training in the United Kingdom. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in April 1917 and graduated from the course in May. Further promotion came in September when he made lieutenant. On 29 October, Gaby was gassed during the 28th Battalion&#x27;s involvement in the Battle of Passchendaele.

===Victoria Cross details===

Gaby was 26 years old lieutenant when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). On 8 August 1918, at the start of the Allied Hundred Days Offensive, Gaby was acting as commander of his battalion&#x27;s &#x27;D&#x27; Company, which was committed to an attack around Villers-Bretonneux, France, during the Battle of Amiens. When the advance was checked by a large German force about 40 yards beyond the wire, Gaby found a gap and approached the strong point under heavy machine-gun and rifle fire. He emptied his revolver into the garrison, drove the crews from their guns and captured 50 prisoners and four machine-guns. Three days later, on 11 August 1918 while leading his men during an attack at Lihons, he was killed.

His VC citation from the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 30 October 1918 reads:

He is buried at the Heath Cemetery in Harbonnieres, France. He was unmarried at the time of his death. The Alfred Gaby ward at the former Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood was named in his honour.

<text>Yaletown is an area of Downtown Vancouver, Canada, bordered by False Creek and Robson and Homer Streets. Formerly a heavy industrial area dominated by warehouses and rail yards, since the 1986 World&#x27;s Fair it has been transformed into one of the most densely populated neighbourhoods in the city.

==History==

Soon after the construction of bridges across False Creek in 1889, railway yards in the area were developed by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) under the leadership of William Cornelius Van Horne. Many of the CPR workers were resettled from Yale, British Columbia, named after chief trader James Murray Yale, thus the name &quot;Yaletown&quot;. Many of the brick railway-era buildings survive to this date.

After the real-estate boom and bust cycles of the 20th century, the area became shoddy and contaminated and was bought up by the city. After Expo 86, held on neighbouring former industrial land, the whole area became ripe for development. The site was sold to Hong Kong–based developer Li Ka-shing, setting in motion the redevelopment process which continues to this day.
==Planning and architecture==

From the start, city planners imposed strict guidelines on the development, in particular requiring a substantial amount of development of the public realm and preservation of existing heritage stock. In part, the city&#x27;s adoption of new zoning plans in the Central Area Plan (1991) also aided in the process of rejuvenation by establishing objectives of improving livability and providing for office space within Yaletown, as well as preserving its heritage structures. Thus there are generous areas set aside for parks, waterfront access, community centres, and schools. Along the shore of False Creek, the Stanley Park Seawall linear park has been continued through the area, forming its southern boundary.

While little or no original housing from the 19th century survives, several older buildings from the industrial days still exist. Hamilton Street and Mainland Street are the most significant, comprising two intact streetscapes from that era. They are lined with handsome brick warehouses built on rail platforms, many with cantilevered canopies. These have been converted into loft style apartments and offices, with boutique stores, bars and restaurants at the ground level. During the latter years of the dot com boom in the late 1990s, these streets housed Vancouver&#x27;s &quot;multimedia gulch&quot;, similar to the SOMA area of San Francisco.

Nearby, at the junction of Davie Street and Pacific Boulevard, an old brick Canadian Pacific railway roundhouse (Drake Street Roundhouse) has been converted into the Roundhouse Community Centre, which uses the old engine turntable as a small outdoor amphitheatre. In another tribute to the rail history of the area, it also houses Engine No. 374, which pulled the first passenger train into Vancouver in 1887.

Spilling around the central core of Hamilton and Mainland Streets, most other architecture in Yaletown is newly built on the old derelict yards, the vast majority in a uniform glass and concrete high-rise style. Most of these buildings are apartment blocks.
==Transportation==
The Aquabus and False Creek Ferries provide passenger service from Yaletown to various stops around False Creek, including Granville Island and Science World. Yaletown is served by the Yaletown–Roundhouse SkyTrain station on the Canada Line, as well as buses 6 and 23.

==Education==
The Yaletown waterfront is also home to Elsie Roy Elementary School, the first new elementary school to be opened in an inner-city Vancouver neighbourhood since 1975. Yaletown is also home to a number of English language schools.

<text>Private James Henry Finn (sometimes Fynn) VC (24 November 1893 – 30 March 1917) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was also awarded the Order of Karageorge, which is Serbia&#x27;s equivalent to the Victoria Cross.

==Early life==
Finn was born in St Clement near Truro, Cornwall. His father, John Finn, served in the Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry (DCLI) in the Boer War, and again in the Special Reserve during the First World War. James Finn served as a Territorial Force soldier with the 5th Battalion, DCLI before moving to the South Wales Valleys looking for work. He eventually found employment at the colliery at Cwmtillery near Abertillery.

==Military service==
On the outbreak of war in the summer of 1914, he immediately enlisted with the local regiment, the South Wales Borderers, and was duly posted to their 4th (Service) Battalion. On enlistment, his surname was incorrectly recorded as &quot;Fynn&quot;.

On 15 July 1915, the battalion landed at Gallipoli. Fynn was wounded in the knee and chest, and invalided back to Britain. After the withdrawal from Gallipoli, the battalion had moved to Mesopotamia, and Fynn rejoined them there. He acted as orderly to the battalion&#x27;s commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel G. E. Kitchen.

It was on 9 April 1916 at Sanna-i-Yat, Mesopotamia (now Iraq), that 22-year-old Private Fynn earned the Victoria Cross for his bravery.

Fynn was decorated with the ribbon of the VC by Lt Gen Sir Frederick Stanley Maude at Amara on 5 November 1916. On 29 March 1917 he was wounded in the leg in an engagement at Marl Plain, 50 miles north of Baghdad. He was taken by stretcher to the field ambulance the next day, but on the way he was struck in the side by another bullet, which proved fatal.

The VC was presented to his father at a public investiture in Hyde Park on 2 June 1917 by King George V.

Fynn was also mentioned in dispatches (London Gazette, 19 October 1916). He was awarded the Serbian Cross of the Karageorge (1st Class) with swords (London Gazette, 15 February 1917).

==Legacy==
His memorial at Basra, Iraq can be found at panel numbers 16 and 32 on the Basra Memorial which was originally sited within Basra War Cemetery.

In 1966, Fynn was also remembered at his home town of Bodmin when an estate was named &quot;Finn VC Estate&quot; in his honour. A plaque commemorating the event was unveiled, and can be seen opposite the old library in Bodmin. His VC was donated to the town council but is not on public display.

Whilst his body was never returned to Cornwall he is remembered on his father&#x27;s headstone in Bodmin Cemetery.

In March, 2016 a commemorative paving stone was unveiled at Mount Folly in Bodmin

There are memorials also at Havard Chapel, Brecon Cathedral; St Michael&#x27;s Church, Abertillery; Town War Memorial, Abertillery.

There is a painting of the action which was published in &quot;The Sphere&quot;, &quot;Tatler&quot;, and also &quot;The Times Illustrated History of the Great War&quot;. The original artwork was by Ugo Matania and is held at the Wellcome Library, London.

<doc id="1221655" wikidata="Q2741618" url="?curid=1221655" title="Milo O'Shea">
<text>Milo Donal O&#x27;Shea (2 June 1926 – 2 April 2013) was an Irish actor. He was twice nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his performances in &quot;Staircase&quot; (1968) and &quot;Mass Appeal&quot; (1982).

==Early life==
O&#x27;Shea was born and brought up in Dublin and educated by the Christian Brothers at Synge Street school, along with his friend Donal Donnelly. His father was a singer and his mother a ballet teacher. Because he was bilingual, O&#x27;Shea performed in English-speaking theatres and in Irish in the Abbey Theatre Company. At age 12, he appeared in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; at the Gate Theatre. He later studied music and drama at the Guildhall School in London and was a skilled pianist.

He was discovered in the 1950s by Harry Dillon, who ran the 37 Theatre Club on the top floor of his shop the Swiss Gem Company, 51 Lower O&#x27;Connell Street Dublin. Early in his career O&#x27;Shea toured with the theatrical company of Anew McMaster.

==Career==
O&#x27;Shea began acting on the stage, then moved into film in the 1960s. He became popular in the United Kingdom, as a result of starring in the BBC sitcom &quot;Me Mammy&quot; alongside Yootha Joyce. In 1967–68 he appeared in the drama &quot;Staircase&quot;, co-starring Eli Wallach and directed by Barry Morse, which stands as Broadway&#x27;s first depiction of homosexual men in a serious light. For his role in that drama, he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play in 1968.

O&#x27;Shea starred as Leopold Bloom in Joseph Strick&#x27;s 1967 film version of &quot;Ulysses&quot;. 
Among his other memorable film roles in the 1960s were the well-intentioned Friar Laurence in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and the villainous Dr. Durand Durand (who tried to kill Jane Fonda&#x27;s character by making her die of pleasure) in Roger Vadim&#x27;s counterculture classic &quot;Barbarella&quot; (both films were released in 1968). In 1984, O&#x27;Shea reprised his role as Dr. Durand Durand (credited as Dr. Duran Duran) for the 1985 Duran Duran concert film &quot;Arena (An Absurd Notion)&quot;, since his character inspired the band&#x27;s name. He played Inspector Boot in the 1973 Vincent Price horror/comedy film &quot;Theatre of Blood&quot;.

He was active in American films and television, such as his memorable supporting role as the trial judge in the Sidney Lumet-directed movie &quot;The Verdict&quot; (1982) with Paul Newman, an episode of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; in 1987, and portraying Chief Justice of the United States Roy Ashland in the television series &quot;The West Wing&quot;. In 1992, O&#x27;Shea guest starred in the season 10 finale of the sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot; and in 1995, in an episode of the show&#x27;s spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot;. In the episode of &quot;Frasier&quot;, he played Dr. Schachter, a couple&#x27;s therapist who counsels the Crane brothers together. He appeared in the pilot episode of &quot;Early Edition&quot; as Sherman.

Other stage appearances include &quot;Mass Appeal&quot; (1981) in which he originated the role of Father Tim Farley (for which he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play in 1982), the musical &quot;Dear World&quot; in which he played the Sewer Man opposite Angela Lansbury as Countess Aurelia, &quot;Corpse!&quot; (1986) and a 1994 Broadway revival of &quot;Philadelphia, Here I Come&quot;.

O&#x27;Shea received an honorary degree from Quinnipiac University in 2010.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Shea&#x27;s first wife was Maureen Toal, an Irish actress, with whom he had two sons. He divorced her in 1974.

He was married to the Irish actress Kitty Sullivan, whom he met in Italy, where he was filming &quot;Barbarella&quot; and she was auditioning for &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;. The couple occasionally acted together, such as in a 1981 Broadway revival of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;. O&#x27;Shea and Sullivan had no children together. They both adopted United States citizenship and resided in New York City, where they both lived from 1976.

===Death===
O&#x27;Shea died on 2 April 2013, in New York City following a short illness at the age of 86.

<text>Frederick Jeremiah Edwards (3 October 1894 – 9 March 1964) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Edwards was born in Queenstown (now named Cobh), County Cork, Ireland. As a boy he attended the Royal Hibernian Military School in Dublin. He was 21 years old, and a private in the 12th Battalion, The Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Own), British Army during the First World War, and was awarded the VC for his deeds on 26 September 1916 in the Battle of Thiepval Ridge at Thiepval, France:
part of the line was held up by machine-gun fire and all the officers had become casualties. There was confusion and indication of retirement. Private Edwards, grasping the situation and on his own initiative, dashed out towards the gun, which he knocked out with his bombs. This very gallant act, coupled with great presence of mind and disregard of personal danger, made further advance possible and cleared up a dangerous situation.

He was later promoted to corporal and after leaving the British Army he was forced to sell his medal to make ends meet. He died on 9 March 1964 at the Royal Star and Garter Home in Richmond (then in Surrey, now in London) and is buried in Richmond Cemetery.

His Victoria Cross was displayed at the National Army Museum, Chelsea, England.

==In popular culture==
Edwards was portrayed by Adam Webb in the 2006 BBC docudrama &quot;The Somme – From Defeat to Victory&quot;, a film made to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme.

<text>Edmund John Fowler (1861 – 26 March 1926) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in County Waterford, he later achieved the rank of Colour-Sergeant. He died in Colchester, Essex, on 26 March 1926.

==Details==
He was around 18 years old, and a Private in the 2nd Battalion, 90th Regiment of Foot (Perthshire Volunteers), British Army during the Zulu War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 28 March 1879 at the Battle of Hlobane, South Africa, Private Fowler, with a captain and a lieutenant (Henry Lysons) dashed forward in advance of the party which had been ordered to dislodge the enemy from a commanding position in natural caves up the mountain. The path was so narrow that they had to advance in single file and the captain who arrived first at the mouth of the cave was instantly killed. The lieutenant and Private Fowler undismayed by the death of their leader, immediately sprang forward and cleared the enemy out of their stronghold.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Cameronians Regimental Museum in the Hamilton Low Parks Museum in Hamilton, Lanarkshire, Scotland.

<text>William Charles Fuller, VC (13 March 1884 – 29 December 1974) was a soldier in the British Army and a Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Fuller was the first Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross in the First World War.

==Early life==
Fuller was the son of William and Mary Fuller of Laugharne, Carmarthenshire, Wales. He was born in Laugharne on 13 March 1884. Educated in Swansea, he served in the British Army from 1902 to 1909. Fuller married Mary Elizabeth Phillips in 1909, and they had five children: four daughters (Mary, Doris, Muriel and Caroline); and one son, William. He was recalled to the army as a reservist in 1914. 

==First World War==
Fuller was 30 years old, and a lance corporal in the 2nd Battalion, Welsh Regiment, during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 14 September 1914 near Chivy-sur-Aisne, France, Fuller advanced under very heavy enemy rifle and machine-gun fire to extract an officer who was mortally wounded, and carried him back to cover. Fuller won his Victoria Cross for saving Captain Mark Haggard, nephew of Rider Haggard, who had fallen wounded. He carried him a distance estimated at 100 yards to a ridge where he managed to dress the officer&#x27;s wounds. Captain Haggard asked Fuller to fetch his rifle from where he had fallen, because he did not want the enemy to get it. Fuller managed to do so.

With the help of two others, Private Snooks and Lieutenant Melvin, Officer in charge of the machine-gun section of the Welsh Regiment, they managed to get Haggard to the safety of a barn that was being used as a first-aid dressing station. Fuller remained with Haggard trying to help him until the officer died later on that evening, his last words being &quot;Stick it, Welch.&quot; Fuller attended to two other officers who had also been brought to the barn wounded (Lieutenant The Honorable Fitzroy Somerset and Lieutenant Richards). The barn came under heavy fire, and the wounded men and officers were evacuated. Afterwards, the barn was razed to the ground via German shell-fire.

On 29 October, Fuller was wounded while dressing the wounds of Private Tagg; shrapnel entered his right side, twelve inches in up to his shoulder blade and came to rest on his right lung. Fuller was sent to Swansea Hospital where they operated, removing the shrapnel. Fuller was given a home posting after his recovery, as a recruiting sergeant in Wales.

==Later life and legacy==
After the war he was awarded the Royal Humane Society Medal for Life-Saving for attempting to save a drowning child at Mumbles, South Wales. During the Second World War, Fuller served in the Swansea Home Guard.
Fuller died on 29 December 1974 and was buried at Oystermouth Cemetery, Mumbles. A memorial stone was erected there in 2005.

<text>Negative Population Growth is an anti-immigration organization in the United States, founded in 1972.

NPG works on overpopulation issues and advocates for a gradual reduction in U.S. and world population. The organization believes the optimal population for the United States is between 150 and 200 million, while the optimal world population is estimated to be two to three billion. To achieve their goal of a smaller U.S. population, NPG promotes policies aimed at reducing the fertility rate in the U.S. to 1.5 births per woman and advocates for reducing immigration to the United States to 100,000 to 200,000 per year, down from the existing level of over 1.5 million per year.

In 2011, NPGclaimed that their membership exceeded 25,000, although it is unclear what constituted a member.

<text>Gerald Robert O&#x27;Sullivan VC (; 8 November 1888–21 August 1915) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Gerald Robert O&#x27;Sullivan was born in Frankfield, Douglas, County Cork on 8 November 1888. His father was a career soldier in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Known as &#x27;Jerry&#x27;, he was educated at Wimbledon College from which he graduated in 1906. He desired a career in the British Army and attended the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst.

==Military career==
Commissioned into the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers in 1909, O&#x27;Sullivan spent much of the next three years serving in China with his unit, 2nd Battalion. From 1912, the battalion was based in British India but on the outbreak of the First World War was brought back to England.

===First World War===
The Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers formed part of 29th Division, intended for service in the Gallipoli Campaign. Now a captain in the 1st Battalion, he commanded a company during the landing at X Beach on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915 and acquitted himself well during the early stages of the fighting. On 18 June 1915, the Turks mounted an attack on positions adjacent to those of O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s company, forcing the troops manning the defenses to abandon it. He led his company in a counterattack to reclaim the lost position which exchanged hands several times during the next few hours. The commanding officer in the area, Brigadier General W. R. Marshall, eventually directed O&#x27;Sullivan to lead a party of Inniskilling and South Wales Borderers soldiers to capture the position which was achieved at dawn the following day.

Two weeks later, O&#x27;Sullivan was involved in a further action near Krithia, and this resulted in his recommendation for the Victoria Cross (VC). The citation, published in the London Gazette on 1 September 1915, read as follows: 
The wounds he received in the action of 1–2 July necessitated his evacuation to Egypt for medical treatment but he quickly recovered and returned to his unit on 11 August 1915. The 29th Division was now at Suvla Bay and preparing for a new offensive. The Inniskillings were tasked with the capture of a feature known as Hill 70 or Scimitar Hill. During this battle, on 21 August 1915, he led a charge of 50 men to the hilltop but was killed.

O&#x27;Sullivan has no known grave and is remembered on the Helles Memorial to the Missing. His VC was delivered to his mother who lived in Dorchester, and his name also appears on the memorial there.

<text>John Patrick Hamilton, VC (24 January 1896 – 27 February 1961) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Born in Orange, New South Wales, Hamilton described himself as a butcher when he enlisted aged eighteen, as a private in the 1st Australian Imperial Force on 15 September 1914. His father William Hamilton was also a butcher and they resided together in Penshurst, Sydney when the younger Hamilton joined up. He was assigned to the 3rd Battalion (N.S.W.) and embarked from Sydney in October 1914 on &quot;HMAT Euripides&quot;. After training in Egypt his battalion sailed for Gallipoli and took part in the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915 – his battalion coming ashore in the second and third waves.

==First World War==
Hamilton was 19 years old, and still a private when the following deed took place at Sasse&#x27;s Sap during the Battle of Lone Pine on the Gallipoli Peninsula for which he was awarded the VC:

The 3rd Battalion was decimated at Lone Pine but, after the withdrawal from Gallipoli and reorganization in Egypt the Battalion was redeployed to the Western Front in March 1916 and went into the line at Armentières. Hamilton was promoted corporal on 3 May and fought at the Battle of Pozières in July, the Battle of Mouquet Farm in August and Flers in November. He was promoted sergeant in May 1917 and that year his battalion served at Bullecourt and at the Menin Road and Broodseinde theatres of the Battle of Passchendale.

After officer cadet training at Cambridge, England, from July 1918 he was commissioned a second lieutenant in January 1919 and promoted lieutenant in April 1919. After demobilisation, he was discharged in September 1919.

==Second World War==
Hamilton rejoined the Army in 1940, and served as a lieutenant with the 16th Garrison Battalion and several training battalions. In 1942 he went to New Guinea with the 2/3rd Pioneer Battalion, then served with Australian Labour Employment Companies until 1944 when he transferred to the Australian Army Labour Service. He was promoted captain in the Australian Military Forces in October 1944. He returned to Sydney in April 1946.
==Between and post the wars==
He was a wharf labourer for over thirty years, also working as a shipping clerk, storeman and packer. He was an active in the Waterside Workers&#x27; Federation and in the Sydney branch of the Australian Labor Party.

Hamilton died of cerebro-vascular disease in the Concord Repatriation General Hospital on 27 February 1961 and is buried in Woronora cemetery. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial and was the only one awarded to Hamilton&#x27;s unit during the war.

<text>Bernard Sidney Gordon, VC, MM (16 August 1891 – 19 October 1963) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross during the First World War, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==First World War==
Gordon was 27 years old, and acting as a Lance Corporal in the 41st Battalion, Australian Imperial Force when, during the Battle of Amiens, the following deeds leading to him being awarded the Military Medal occurred.

This action occurred on the &quot;Black Day&quot; of the German Army, in which the Australian Corps destroyed their opposition. As a result of this, on 9 August 1918 the Canadian Corps advance lead to a general retreat by the German troops. The Australian 3rd Division continued to advance toward the bend in the River Somme. During this period the following action, for which Gordon was awarded the Victoria Cross, took place:

Gordon was wounded on 1 September 1918 (Bouchavesnes Spur – Battle of Mont St Quentin). He was evacuated and sent to England on 4 September 1918, where he was awarded the Military Medal on 15 September 1918. He was not awarded the Victoria Cross until 20 December 1918 (after the Armistice), the citation for which states:

==Sale of his medal==
Gordon&#x27;s Victoria Cross was sold at auction in Sydney on 28 November 2006 for A$478,000. The medal was sold by one of Gordon&#x27;s daughters, who needed money to keep the family farm in operation. The VC was purchased by an agent of media tycoon Kerry Stokes, the same man who paid a world record price of A$1 million in July 2006 for the VC awarded to Alfred Shout, A$180,000 for the George Cross of Lieutenant Commander George Gosse, and in conjunction with the South Australian Government, the VC of Major Peter Badcoe. All four medals are on display at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.

==Legacy==
A successor unit to his 41st Battalion AIF, the 41st Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment, continues to honour the memory of Lance Corporal Gordon VC MM. An annual Mess Dinner is held in his honour during August on the anniversary of his heroic actions. On the 7th of September, 2024, a new barracks facility was opened in Chinderah, New South Wales and was named as the Gordon VC Multi User Depot, for the use by the 41st Battalion.

<text>Fred Greaves VC (16 May 1890 – 11 June 1973) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Greaves was born on 16 May 1890 in Killamarsh, a town in north-east Derbyshire. He was 27 years old, and an acting corporal in the 9th Battalion, The Sherwood Foresters (The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment), British Army during the Battle of Broodseinde in the First World War when he performed a deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 4 October 1917 at Poelcapelle, east of Ypres, Belgium, when the platoon was held up by machine-gun fire from a concrete stronghold and the platoon commander and sergeant were casualties, Corporal Greaves, followed by another NCO, rushed forward, reached the rear of the building and bombed the occupants, killing or capturing the garrison and the machine-gun. Later, at a most critical period of the battle, during a heavy counter-attack, all the officers of the company became casualties and Corporal Geaves collected his men, threw out extra posts on the threatened flank and opened up rifle and machine-gun fire to enfilade the advance.

He later achieved the rank of Sergeant. Fred died in Brimington, near Chesterfield, on 11 June 1973, aged 83, and was cremated there.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Sherwood Foresters Museum, Nottingham Castle, England.

On 2 August 2014 a commemorative plaque to Greaves was unveiled in the Chesterfield FC Memorial Garden at the Proact Stadium.

<text>Thomas Grady VC DCM (; 18 September 1835 – 18 May 1891) was born in Claddagh, County Galway and was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 19 years old, and a private in the 4th Regiment of Foot (later The King&#x27;s Own (Royal Lancaster) Regiment), British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 18 October 1854 at Sebastopol, the Crimea, Private Grady volunteered to repair the embrasures of the Sailors&#x27; Battery on the Left Attack and carried out this task under very heavy fire from a line of batteries. On 22 November during the repulse of a Russian attack, although severely wounded, Private Grady refused to leave the front and his example encouraged the weak force which was engaging the enemy to maintain their position.

==Further information==
He emigrated to Australia and died in South Melbourne, Victoria on 18 May 1891. Grady is buried in Melbourne General Cemetery.

Some references incorrectly state he was promoted sergeant. He was discharged as a private, his award was gazetted as a private and his pension was paid as a private.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial &quot;(Canberra, Australia)&quot;.

<text>Brigadier Milton Fowler Gregg, (10 April 1892 – 13 March 1978) was a Canadian military officer and a First World War recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. In later life, he was a Member of the Canadian Parliament, cabinet minister, academic, soldier and diplomat.

== Early life ==
Gregg was born in 1892 in Mountain Dale, Kings County, New Brunswick, the son of Clarissa E.(Myles) and George Lord Gregg. During the early stages of World War I he enlisted in the Canadian Army with The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada in September 1914 while still studying at Acadia University. He graduated with a Master of Arts in 1916.

=== Victoria Cross ===
At the age of eighteen Gregg joined the 8th New Brunswick Hussars militia regiment. Gregg served during the First World War as a sergeant in the medical corps and later as an officer of The Royal Canadian Regiment. During combat on the Western Front in 1917, his actions earned him the Military Cross and in 1918 further valour added a bar to the Cross. Near Cambrai, Nord, France on 28 September 1918 his actions during the Battle of the Canal du Nord (part of Canada&#x27;s Hundred Days) earned him the Victoria Cross. 

The citation for Gregg&#x27;s Victoria Cross reads:
==== Victoria Cross stolen ====
On the evening of 24 December 1978, Gregg&#x27;s medal set was stolen from the Royal Canadian Regiment Museum in London, Ontario. The medal set which had been placed on permanent loan to the museum by his widow Erica Deichmann Gregg included the Victoria Cross, the Order of Canada in the grade of Officer and the Military Cross with one Bar.

== Later career ==

From 1934 until 1939, Gregg was the Sergeant at Arms of the House of Commons. Following the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Gregg served overseas for two years with the West Nova Scotia Regiment and then commanded officer training centres at various military facilities in Canada and retired with the rank of brigadier in 1943. In 1944, Gregg was appointed the commanding officers of CANLOAN officers at Sussex Military Camp prior to their deployment to the British Army. He was later named the first honorary president of the CANLOAN Army Officers&#x27; Association, a veterans association of CANLOAN officers.

In 1944, Gregg was appointed President of the University of New Brunswick, serving in that position until 1947 when he was elected to Parliament as Liberal member for the York-Sunbury riding. Gregg served in the cabinets of Prime Ministers William Lyon Mackenzie King and Louis St. Laurent for almost 10 years as the Minister of Fisheries, Minister of Veterans Affairs, and Minister of Labour.

Defeated in the 1957 election, Gregg went on to become the United Nations representative in Iraq, the UNICEF administrator in Indonesia, and the Canadian High Commissioner in Georgetown, British Guiana. He retired in 1968. He died on 13 March 1978 and is buried at Snider Mountain Baptist Church Cemetery in Snider Mountain, New Brunswick.

== Honours ==


* Gregg was sworn into the King&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada on 2 September 1947 by the Governor General of Canada FM Rt Hon Lord Alexander of Tunis on the advice of Canadian Prime Minister Rt Hon William Lyon Mackenzie King. This gave him the Honorific Title &quot;The Honourable&quot; and the Post Nominal Letters &quot;PC&quot; for Life.

== Legacy ==
After his death, the Milton Fowler Gregg VC Memorial Trust Fund Bursary was created in his name. It is offered annually to students entering the Royal Military College of Canada Division of Graduate Studies and Research.

The Mons Box Trophy was created by then Brigadier, The Honourable Milton F. Gregg, VC, CBE, OC, MC, ED, CD. It is awarded to the platoon commander who has exhibited the highest qualities of leadership and who is therefore, the junior officer most fit to command the men who have been placed in his charge. The Mons Box, a ceremonial cigar box, was presented to then Lieutenant Gregg by the Burgomaster of Mons, Belgium in November 1918. In addition, all members of the Canadian Corps who had reached the Mons area by Armistice Day were presented with a souvenir medallion of the City of Mons. Duplicates of this medallion are affixed to the box. Brigadier Gregg presented the Mons Box to 2 RCR on 1 June 1973. It has been presented annually since then to the winning platoon commander on the first appropriate battalion function after 1 June. The winner of the Mons Box is determined by a selection committee consisting of the Commanding Officer, the Adjutant, Company Commanders and any previous winners of the Mons Box serving in 2 RCR. These previous winners are no longer eligible to compete. All Subalterns, who have spent at least eight consecutive months of the previous year as a platoon commander, are eligible for the award.
The Mons Box is displayed in the silver cabinet of the Saint Andrew&#x27;s Barracks Officers&#x27; Mess in CFB Gagetown. It is placed in front of the current winner during all Mess Dinners and it contains the after dinner cigars. Each winner of the Mons Box receives a souvenir trophy.

The Brigadier Milton F. Gregg, VC, Centre for the Study of War and Society was created at the University of New Brunswick in 2006 to further Canadians&#x27; knowledge about conflict, and is devoted to excellence in the study of war as a complex social phenomenon. Marc Milner is the first Director. The centre incorporates the UNB History and UNB Military and Strategic Studies Programs.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Sir John Reginald Noble Graham, 3rd Baronet, (17 September 1892 – 6 December 1980) was a British businessman, army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He received the award &quot;for most conspicuous bravery, coolness and resource when in command of a Machine Gun Section&quot; during the Samarra offensive in 1917, during the First World War.

==Early life==
Graham was born at Calcutta, India, on 17 September 1892, the eldest son of Sir Frederick Graham, 2nd Baronet. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge.

==First World War==
Soon after the First World War broke out, Graham joined the British Army and was posted to 9th Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise&#x27;s). In 1916 he was seconded to 136 Company, Machine Gun Corps, which was sent to Mesopotamia. During the Samarra offensive, Lieutenant Graham was in command of a machine gun section co-operating with the 56th Punjabi Rifles (Frontier Force) near Istabulat on the evening of 22 April 1917. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his subsequent actions that night:

After recovering from his severe wounds Captain Graham, as he had become, was ordered back to Mesopotamia where he continued to serve until January 1918, when his company was transferred to Palestine where he was given command of the unit with the rank of major.

After the war, Graham returned to Scotland to a hero&#x27;s welcome at his home village of Cardross.

==Business ventures and later life==
Graham later worked in India in branches of the family firm, William Graham and Company, founded by his great-great-grandfather in Glasgow.

In 1920 Graham married Rachel Sprot, daughter of Sir Alexander Sprot, 1st Baronet. They had one son (who inherited the baronetcy as Sir John Graham, 4th Baronet) and one daughter, Lesley, who married Jock Wykeham Strang Steel.
Graham succeeded to the Baronetcy on the death of his father in 1936. During the Second World War, he was given a temporary rank of lieutenant colonel and served in Scottish Command. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1946 New Year Honours, and awarded King Haakon VII&#x27;s Cross of Liberty in 1949.

From 1959 to 1979 Graham was Usher of the Green Rod to the Order of the Thistle, and participated in many state occasions including the unveiling of a memorial to King George VI in St Giles&#x27; Cathedral, Edinburgh in 1962. He died aged 88 in Edinburgh. He was cremated at Mortonhall Crematorium.

Lady Graham died in 1984.

==Memorials==

Graham&#x27;s medals are held by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Museum in Stirling Castle on loan from the family.

Reginald Graham&#x27;s Commemorative Memorial Stone was unveiled at the Cardross War Memorial on 22 April 2017, the 100th anniversary of his gallant action. There is a second Commemorative Memorial Stone to him in the National Memorial Arboretum along with Memorial Stones for all the other VCs who were born abroad.

<text>Lone Justice is the debut studio album by American roots rock band Lone Justice, released in April 1985.

== Reception ==
The album received some critical acclaim, but it failed commercially. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; described the problem as over-promotion: &quot;It isn&#x27;t that Lone Justice&#x27;s first album is bad (it&#x27;s not), but the ballyhoo that preceded the LA quartet&#x27;s debut raised expectations that these frisky countryfied rock tunes (Linda Ronstadt on speed, perhaps, or Dolly Parton backed by the Blasters) couldn&#x27;t possibly satisfy. Maria McKee is an impressive young singer — an energetic, throaty powerhouse with a Southern twang and a slight Patsy Cline catch — and the band is solid enough, but... [the album] doesn&#x27;t come anywhere near extraordinary.&quot;

&quot;Lone Justice&quot; was ranked the 24th best album of 1985 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; year-end Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll.

<text>Major Edric Frederick Gifford, 3rd Baron Gifford, VC (5 July 1849 – 5 June 1911) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==
Edric Gifford was born at Ropley in Hampshire on 5 July 1849. His father was Robert Francis Gifford, 2nd Baron Gifford, and his mother was Hon. Swinburne Frederica Charlotte FitzHardinge Berkeley. His brother was Maurice Gifford, CMG, who raised &quot;Gifford&#x27;s Horse&quot; in the Second Matabele War.

He was educated at Harrow, and in 1869 entered the 83rd Foot. On the death of his father in 1872, he became 3rd Baron Gifford.

In 1874, at the age of 23, Gifford was a lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, 24th Foot (later the South Wales Borderers), British Army during the Third Anglo-Ashanti War, when the events took place which resulted in the award of his Victoria Cross with the citation:

In 1876, Gifford left the 24th Foot, moving to the 57th Foot. In 1878 he was in Cyprus, and in 1879 he was aide-de-camp to Sir Garnet Wolseley in the Anglo-Zulu War. Shortly afterwards he retired from the Army as a brevet major.

==Colonial administrator==

Gifford married Sophia Catherine Street, the daughter of Gen. John Alfred Street, in April 1880, then went to Western Australia, which was at that time a British colony. He arrived in Western Australia in October 1880 and immediately took up an appointment to the position of Colonial Secretary, and a nomination to the Western Australian Legislative Council. After leaving Western Australia in January 1883 following disputes with the Chief Justice, Sir Henry Wrenfordsley and the Governor Sir William Robinson, Gifford was Colonial Secretary of Gibraltar from 1883 to 1887. In 1889 he became a director of the British South Africa Company.

Edric Gifford died on 5 June 1911 in Chichester, England. He had no children. His nephew John Fitzhardinge Paul Butler also won a Victoria Cross.

Edric Gifford&#x27;s Victoria Cross medal is not publicly held.

<text>Sergeant Harold Jackson VC (31 May 1892 − 24 August 1918) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. A soldier with the East Yorkshire Regiment, he was awarded the VC for his actions in March 1918, during the German spring offensive of the First World War. He was killed in action five months later.

==Early life==
Jackson was born on 31 May 1892 to Thomas and Ann Jackson, and lived in Allandales, Kirton, in the English county of Lincolnshire. After working as a drayman, he moved to Nottingham in about 1912 or 1913 and worked on the railways there. He later started working as a bricklayer for a building company.

==First World War==
Jackson joined the British Army in April 1915, eight months after the British entry into World War I, and was posted to the 18th Hussars (later the 18th Royal Hussars), a cavalry regiment. As a trooper, he was dispatched to France for service on the Western Front. After a few months he was transferred to the East Yorkshire Regiment, a line infantry regiment, and assigned to the 7th (Service) Battalion of his new regiment, a recently-raised Kitchener&#x27;s Army unit made up of civilian volunteers. He participated in the capture of Fricourt, on the opening day of the Battle of the Somme on 1 July 1916, and was wounded two weeks later during the Battle of Bazentin Ridge. Repatriated to England for medical treatment and on recovery served with a reserve battalion before rejoining the 7th East Yorkshires in 1917.

During the German spring offensive of 1918, Jackson&#x27;s battalion were tasked with the defence of Hermies. On 22 March, Jackson, now a sergeant, volunteered for an intelligence gathering patrol, which had to be conducted while the Germans laid down an artillery barrage. Later the same day, he was heavily involved in fighting off a German attack that initially penetrated his battalion&#x27;s position and then put a machine-gun post out of action. Over the following days, the regiment conducted a fighting retreat. Near Albert, on 31 March, he took command of his company after all the officers had been killed or wounded and even retrieved wounded men while under fire. For his actions over the period 22 to 31 March 1918, he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire.

 The citation for his VC read as follows:

Jackson received his VC ribbon from Lieutenant General Cameron Shute, commander of V Corps, on 18 May. He returned to England to be presented with the VC medal itself from King George V; this ceremony took place at Buckingham Palace on 26 June. He &quot;returned home to Kirton, to a hero&#x27;s welcome and Kirton Brass Band took part in the ceremonies along with most of the town&#x27;s inhabitants&quot;. Jackson&#x27;s response to this was to thank the townspeople for their &quot;grand and hearty reception&quot;.

After a period of leave, he returned to his battalion, which &quot;in the last ten days of March had lost twenty-one officers and 431 men&quot;, and was still serving on the Western Front. Jackson&#x27;s &quot;luck ran out&quot; on 24 August when he was killed in action at Thiepval, France. Originally buried near where he was killed, in 1927 his remains were relocated to the AIF Burial Ground at Flers. &quot;The village of Flers came into prominence in mid-September 1916 when it was captured by British and New Zealanders who had the use of tanks for the first time. The village was lost in March 1918 and retaken by the British in August&quot;. He is commemorated on several memorials; that in his home town, one in Boston and at Wood Green in London.

==The medal==
Jackson&#x27;s medals also included the 1914–15 Star, British War Medal, and the Victory Medal. His sister, Mary Searby, had possession of his VC and later lent it to her father, Thomas Jackson, for a function at Buckingham Palace. The VC remained with him until his death, at which time it was returned to Searby. It was later passed onto her niece in the mid-1950s. It, along with Jackson&#x27;s other medals, was sold to a private collector in May 1989.

<text>Herman James Good (29 November 1887 – 18 April 1969) was a soldier in the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Good received the award for his actions during the Battle of Amiens in August 1918, while fighting around Hangard Wood. Good survived the war and returned to Canada. After his discharge from the military in 1919, Good worked in the lumber industry and then later as a fish and game warden. He died of a stroke in 1969, at the age of 81.

==Early life==
Good was born on 29 November 1887 in South Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada. He was one of fourteen children of Walter and Rebecca Good. He was educated at the local public school and involved in lumber operations in the area.

==First World War==
On 29 June 1915, Good enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) on 29 June 1915 in Sussex, New Brunswick. He embarked for England in late October 1915. Arriving there the following month, he was posted to the 2nd Pioneer Battalion serving on the Western Front.

In April 1916, he transferred to the 13th (Royal Highlanders of Canada) Battalion, 3rd Brigade, 1st Canadian Division. Two months later, he received gunshot wounds to his buttocks which required six weeks of treatment before he could return to his unit. He experienced a bout of shell shock in early October and was in and out of care for the next several weeks. He was back with the 13th Battalion by early 1917. He became an acting lance corporal in mid-1917, following a further period in hospital with the mumps, and his rank was made substantive by the end of the year. In May 1918, he was promoted again, to corporal.

On 8 August 1918, the opening day of the Battle of Amiens, and the beginning of the Hundred Days Offensive, the 3rd Brigade, accompanied by a battalion of tanks, was at the forefront of the 1st Division&#x27;s advance. The 13th Battalion had secured Aubercourt village but became held up by machine gun posts in the vicinity of Hangard Wood. At the head of his company, Good attacked the machine guns and put them out of action. Later in the day he located a battery of field guns and led a group of men in the capture of them. Good&#x27;s battalion was able to push on to its objective and consolidate its positions. He was recognised for his deeds of 8 August 1918 by being awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for Good&#x27;s VC read:

The next month, Good was promoted to lance sergeant. He received his VC in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 29 March 1919. Soon afterwards, Good returned to Canada aboard the RMS &quot;Olympic&quot;. He was formally discharged from the CEF on 26 April 1919.

==Later life==
Good resumed his pre-war employment, working in the lumber industry. He later became a fish and game warden, serving in this capacity for 20 years. In his retirement, he lived in Bathurst, where on 13 April 1969 he suffered a stroke. He died five days later. After a funeral service at St George&#x27;s Church, he was buried with military honours in St Alban&#x27;s Cemetery in Bathurst. He was survived by two sons; his wife had predeceased him by several years as had a third son.

After his death, Good&#x27;s VC was inherited by one of his sons; Frank Good. It, along with his other war service medals, is now held by the Canadian War Museum, which purchased them in December 2013.

<text>Robert Edwin &quot;Bob&quot; Phillips VC (11 April 1895 – 23 September 1968) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Early life ==

Philips was born at 12, Queen Street, Hill Top, West Bromwich, (then Staffordshire) England. His father was a roll turner. He was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School, Aston.

== The Medal==

He was 21 years old, and a Temporary Lieutenant in the 13th Battalion, The Royal Warwickshire Regiment, British Army, attached 9th (S) Battalion during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 25 January 1917 near Kut, Mesopotamia, Lieutenant Phillips went to the assistance of his commanding officer (Edward Elers Delaval Henderson) who was lying in the open, having been mortally wounded while leading a counter-attack. The lieutenant went out with a comrade and, under the most intense fire, they succeeded in bringing their commanding officer back to British lines.

He later achieved the rank of captain.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers Museum (Royal Warwickshire), Warwick, England.

== Blue plaque ==

On 26 January 2008, a blue plaque was erected on Holyhead House, Phillips&#x27; childhood home, at 54b, Hill Top, West Bromwich.

== Street name ==

A street in Sandwell, near his birthplace, was named in his honour in 2000. However the name &quot;Edwin Phillips Drive&quot; was used in error. Derek Pinches, Phillips&#x27; great nephew, noticed the error and local historians campaigned to have the name changed. This met with resistance from residents of the drive, 85% of whom objected. As a compromise, Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council replaced the street name plate with one explaining that the street name commemorates &quot;Capt Robert Edwin Phillips V.C.&quot;.

<text>Brigadier Herbert Wallace Le Patourel (20 June 1916 – 4 September 1979) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Le Patourel was born in Guernsey, Channel Islands on 20 June 1916. His father, Herbert Augustus Le Patourel, was procureur (Attorney General) of Guernsey from 1929 to 1934. He was educated at Elizabeth College, Guernsey, and represented the school at shooting and hockey. On leaving school he worked as a bank clerk from 1934 to 1937. He joined the British Army, being commissioned a second lieutenant into the Hampshire Regiment in 1938 and was promoted to captain in 1941, during the Second World War.

==VC details==
Le Patourel was 26 years old, and a temporary major in the 2nd Battalion, Hampshire Regiment (later the Royal Hampshire Regiment), British Army during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 3 December 1942 at Tebourba, Tunisia, enemy forces were holding high ground and resisting all efforts in dislodge them. Le Patourel called for four volunteers to go with him and they attacked and silenced several of the machine-gun posts. When all his men became casualties, he went on alone to engage the enemy, using his pistol and hurling hand grenades.

Initial reports from other wounded soldiers suggested that Le Patourel had been killed in action, and he was awarded the VC posthumously. He was later discovered to have survived, been taken prisoner and was in hospital in Italy. He was repatriated in 1943, and awarded his Victoria Cross at a ceremony in Cairo, Egypt.

==Later career==
Shortly after his repatriation, Le Patourel returned to active service. He went on to serve as brigade major in north-western Europe 1944–45 where he was mentioned in dispatches. In November 1945, he was appointed an Instructor at the Staff College, Quetta, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel. He later achieved the rank of brigadier.

He paid an official visit to his native Guernsey at its Liberation in 1945, and was officially welcomed home by the States of Guernsey on the anniversary of the liberation in 1948.

Le Patourel was later appointed as a Deputy Lieutenant of the County of Avon, and was a director of Harveys of Bristol from 1969.

He married Babette Theresa Beattie in 1949, and had two daughters. One daughter, Penelope Ann Le Patourel, is the wife of Sir William Ehrman. His brother, John Le Patourel, FBA, was Professor of Medieval History at the University of Leeds from 1945 to 1974.

In 2002, a series of six postage stamps was issued by Guernsey Post depicting Le Patourel&#x27;s life. On 18 July 2015, a blue plaque was unveiled on his childhood home, celebrating the lives of Le Patourel and his brother, John.

==The medal==
Le Patourel&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed in the Royal Hampshire Regiment Museum, Lower Barracks, Winchester, England.

<doc id="1221714" wikidata="Q1419797" url="?curid=1221714" title="Tommy (1975 film)">
<text>Tommy is a 1975 British psychedelic musical fantasy drama film written and directed by Ken Russell. It was based on the Who&#x27;s 1969 album of the same name, a rock opera about a &quot;psychosomatically deaf, mute, and blind&quot; boy who becomes a pinball champion and religious leader. The film featured a star-studded ensemble cast, including the band members themselves (most notably, lead singer Roger Daltrey, who plays the title role), Oliver Reed, Ann-Margret, Elton John, Eric Clapton, Jack Nicholson, Robert Powell and Tina Turner.

An independent production by Russell and Robert Stigwood, &quot;Tommy&quot; was released by Columbia Pictures in the US on 19 March 1975 while in the UK it was released by Hemdale Film Corporation on 26 March 1975. Ann-Margret received a Golden Globe Award for her performance and was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. Pete Townshend was also nominated for an Oscar for his work in scoring and adapting the music for the film. The film was shown at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition. In 1975, the film won the award for Rock Movie of the Year in the First Annual Rock Music Awards.

==Plot==
In the prologue, set in 1945, a montage displays the honeymoon of Group Captain Walker and his wife, Nora (&quot;Prologue - 1945&quot;). After his leave ends, Walker goes off to fight in World War II as a bomber pilot, but is shot down during a mission. &quot;Captain Walker&quot; is listed as missing in action and is presumed dead, although—unknown to his family—the badly burned Walker is still alive. Back in England, Nora goes into labour and gives birth to a son, Tommy, on V-E Day (&quot;Captain Walker/It&#x27;s a Boy&quot;). Five years later, in 1950, Nora begins a new relationship with Frank, a holiday worker she and Tommy meet at a holiday camp. Tommy looks up to his &quot;Uncle&quot; Frank and expresses his desire to run his own holiday camp some day (&quot;Bernie&#x27;s Holiday Camp&quot;). On New Year&#x27;s Eve, Nora and Frank dream of their future (&quot;1951 / What About the Boy?&quot;), but, late that evening, the returning Captain Walker surprises the couple in bed, leading to a struggle where Frank kills the Captain (in the original album synopsis, the Captain kills Frank). Realising that Tommy has witnessed the murder through the reflection of a mirror, the couple coerce Tommy into believing he did not see or hear anything and will tell no one. The heat of the moment panics Tommy into a dissociative state where he outwardly appears &quot;deaf, dumb, and blind&quot;, though internally he finds himself experiencing the world through a psychedelia-like state (&quot;Amazing Journey&quot;). Later, at a Christmas party, Nora is distressed that Tommy &quot;doesn&#x27;t know what day it is&quot; (&quot;Christmas&quot;).

Over 16 years, Nora and Frank make several fruitless attempts to bring the now older Tommy out of his state, taking him to a faith healer (&quot;Eyesight to the Blind&quot;) and a drug dealer (&quot;The Acid Queen&quot;). They become increasingly lethargic at the lack of effect, place him with some questionable babysitters (&quot;Cousin Kevin&quot; / &quot;Fiddle About&quot;) and eventually leave Tommy standing at the mirror one night, allowing him to wander off. He follows a vision of himself to a junkyard pinball machine (&quot;Sparks&quot;) and begins to play. Tommy is recognised by Frank and the media as a pinball prodigy (&quot;Extra, Extra, Extra&quot;), which is made even more impressive with his sensory-impaired state. During a championship game, Tommy faces the &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; with The Who as the backing band. Nora watches her son&#x27;s televised victory and celebrates his (and her) success and luxury, but finds she can&#x27;t fully enjoy it because of Tommy&#x27;s extreme condition (&quot;Champagne&quot;).

Frank finds a specialist for Tommy (&quot;There&#x27;s a Doctor&quot;) who concludes that Tommy&#x27;s state is triggered emotionally rather than physically and explains the only hope is to continue having Tommy face his reflection (&quot;Go to the Mirror!&quot;). An increasingly frustrated Nora promptly throws Tommy through the mirror (&quot;Smash the Mirror!&quot;) causing him to snap to full consciousness (&quot;I&#x27;m Free&quot;). Tommy reveals that his experiences have transformed him and decides that he wants to transform the world (&quot;Mother and Son&quot; / &quot;Miracle Cure&quot;).

Tommy goes on lecture tours that resemble glam-rock gospel shows and spreads a message of enlightenment by hang glider, gaining friends and followers everywhere he goes (&quot;Sally Simpson&quot; / &quot;Sensation&quot;). Tommy and a more enlightened and elated Nora and Frank welcome converts to their house, which quickly becomes too crowded to accommodate everyone. Tommy opens an extension for his religious campus (&quot;Welcome&quot; / &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Holiday Camp&quot;).

The converts, confused about Tommy&#x27;s odd practices and his family&#x27;s commercial exploitation of the compound, wrathfully demand Tommy teach them something useful. Tommy does so, artificially deafening, muting, and blinding everyone, only to inadvertently provoke a riot. The followers kill Nora and Frank and destroy the camp in a fire (&quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot;). Tommy finds his parents in the debris and mourns before escaping into the mountains from the beginning of the film. He ascends the same peak where his parents celebrated their honeymoon, celebrating the rising sun (&quot;Listening to You&quot;).

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Tommy&quot; was written in 1968 and recorded by the Who in 1969. Three years later a version of the opera was recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra. The two albums sold ten million copies between them.

Film rights were bought by Robert Stigwood who secured financing from Columbia. Beryl Vertue of the Stigwood Organisation was executive producer. Stigwood also arranged for Ken Russell to direct.

Russell admitted he did not like the music – he disliked rock music in general – but he loved the theme of the film, being about a messiah.

According to Russell, several scripts had been written by the time he came on the project. He later wrote &quot;some were well written, some were not, but they all had one thing in common - a big negative. They were not about a deaf dumb and blind boy&#x27;s spiritual journey from darkness to light.&quot;

Russell did up his own treatment of the story as he saw it. He said: &quot;This in no way deviated from his [Townshend&#x27;s] original but plugged in the gaps where I found the story obscure or just non existent.&quot; Russell said Townshend liked most of his suggestions and wrote new material.

Russell and Townshend worked on the film together for a year. Russell had been working on a script called &quot;The Angels&quot;, which was to star Mia Farrow about a pop star called Poppy Day who becomes a messianic figure, and reworked some of that script&#x27;s sequences for &quot;Tommy&quot;. He also used scenes from another unfilmed script of his, &quot;Music Music Music&quot; about a composer who writes music for TV commercials (this turned into what became known as the &quot;baked beans&quot; scene with Ann-Margret). Russell made several changes to the story:
* In the original story, Tommy&#x27;s father returns and murders the lover. In the film, the father is the murder victim.
* Both Tommy&#x27;s mother and lover are complicit in the murder.
* The story&#x27;s setting is shifted forward, so that the finale takes place in the mid-1970s (present-day when the film was released). The song &quot;1921&quot; is changed to &quot;1951&quot; to accommodate this.

===Casting===
It was announced that Roger Daltrey would play Tommy and Keith Moon would play Uncle Ernie. Various rumours spread over who would play other characters with names such as David Bowie, Elton John, Barbra Streisand and Mick Jagger being mentioned.

Daltrey was cast at Russell&#x27;s specific request, over the wishes of Daltrey&#x27;s own management.

In December, it was announced Ann-Margret would play Tommy&#x27;s mother. Ann-Margret was cast because, according to Russell, &quot;I needed a superb singer.&quot;

Jagger was reportedly offered the role of The Acid Queen but insisted on singing three of his own songs, so the role was given to Tina Turner.

Jack Nicholson agreed to play a small role because &quot;Russell&#x27;s films intrigue me, some I like very much, some I don&#x27;t like at all, and I want to find out what makes them tick.&quot; Russell originally considered Peter Sellers for the role of The Specialist.

Russell says Pete Townshend wanted Tiny Tim to play Pinball Wizard but Stigwood overruled him. Elton John initially turned down the role of the Pinball Wizard and among those considered to replace him was David Essex, who recorded a test audio version of the &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; song. However, producer Robert Stigwood held out until John agreed to take the part, reportedly on condition that he could keep the gigantic Dr. Martens boots he wore in the scene. John later wore the boots in a brief scene in the music video for his song &quot;Nikita&quot;, which was directed by Russell.

===Filming===

Filming started April 1974 and took place over twelve weeks. In his commentary for the 2004 DVD release of the film, Ken Russell stated that the opening and closing outdoor scenes were shot in the Borrowdale valley of the English Lake District, near his own home, the same area that he had used to double for rural Austria and Bohemia in his earlier film &quot;Mahler&quot;, in which Robert Powell had starred.

Much of the film was shot on locations around Portsmouth, including the scene near the end of the film featuring the giant &#x27;pinballs&#x27;, which were, in fact, obsolete buoys found in a British Navy yard, which were simply sprayed silver and filmed in situ. The Bernie&#x27;s Holiday Camp ballroom sequence was shot inside the Gaiety Theatre on South Parade Pier. Exterior shots were filmed at Hilsea Lido (Russell had worked there before making &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;). The Sally Simpson interior sequence was filmed in the Wesley Hall in Fratton Road, Portsmouth. The exterior intro sequence to the scene, however, shows Sally Simpson buying a badge and entering South Parade Pier.

On 11 June 1974, the pier caught fire and was badly damaged while the production was filming there. According to Russell, the fire started during the filming of the scene of Ann-Margret and Oliver Reed dancing together during the &quot;Bernie&#x27;s Holiday Camp&quot; sequence; smoke from the fire can be seen drifting in front of the camera in several shots. Russell also used a brief exterior shot of the building fully ablaze during the scenes of the destruction of Tommy&#x27;s Holiday Camp by his disillusioned followers.

The Pinball Wizard sequence was shot at the Kings Theatre in Southsea and the two pinball machines used were a 1965 Kings &amp; Queens by Gottlieb—used by Roger Daltrey—and a Gottlieb Buckaroo also from 1965, used by Elton John. The machines&#x27; scoring displays were modified from their originals for the scene, to accommodate for large scores. Other locations on Portsdown Hill, which overlooks Portsmouth and local churches were used. All Saints in Commercial Road was used for the Sally Simpson wedding scene, whilst the meeting in the same sequence was filmed at the Wesley Hall in Fratton Road. The Eyesight to the Blind sequence was filmed at St Andrews Church in Henderson Road in Southsea. The other church featured was Warblington Church near Havant in Hampshire.

The famous scene in which Ann-Margret&#x27;s character hallucinates that she is cavorting in detergent foam, baked beans, and chocolate reportedly took three days to shoot. According to Russell, the detergent and baked bean sequences were &quot;revenge&quot; parodies of real-life TV advertisements he had directed early in his career, although the baked bean sequence also references one of the cover photos and a parody radio ad from The Who&#x27;s 1967 album &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot;. Russell also recalled that Ann-Margret&#x27;s husband, Roger Smith, strongly objected to the scene in which she slithers around in melted chocolate.

During the filming, Ann-Margret accidentally struck her hand on the broken glass of the TV screen, causing a severe laceration, and Russell had to take her to hospital to have the wound stitched, although she was back on set the next day. The film also includes a scene in which Mrs. Walker watches a parodic TV advertisement for the fictional product &quot;Rex Baked Beans&quot;; the costumes in this segment were originally made for the lavish masked ball sequence in Richard Lester&#x27;s version of &quot;The Three Musketeers,&quot; and the dress worn by the Queen in the Rex ad is that worn by Geraldine Chaplin in the earlier film.

Russell recalled that Townshend initially baulked at Russell&#x27;s wish to have The Who performing behind Elton in the &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; sequence (they did not perform the audio there), and also objected to wearing the pound-note suits, which were in fact stitched together from novelty pound-note tea-towels. On The Who&#x27;s involvement with the film, members Daltrey played the title character; Moon played, in essence, a dual role as both Uncle Ernie and as himself along with Entwistle and Townshend miming on their respective instruments in the &quot;Eyesight to the Blind&quot; and &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; segments. About his role as the Specialist, Jack Nicholson stated: &quot;In my whole career there was only one time when a director said to me, &#x27;OK, come right down the pike and just look beautiful, Jack.&#x27; That was Ken Russell on &quot;Tommy&quot;.&quot;

Filming finished in September 1974. Russell then edited the film and supervised the recording of the soundtrack. When it was done, Russell said: &quot;I think it&#x27;s probably the one thing I&#x27;ve ever done that satisfies me aesthetically. The fact that it&#x27;s a rock opera as well is a tremendous bonus because people will come see it.&quot;

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was a box-office hit. By August 1975, it had earned US$27 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in the US alone.

The film made over US$1 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in France.

Russell later called it &quot;the most commercial film I&#x27;ve ever made&quot;.

===Critical response===
The film holds a 74% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 34 reviews, with an average grade of 6.90/10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Tommy&quot; is as erratic and propulsive as a game of pinball, incorporating the Who&#x27;s songs into an irreverent odyssey with the visual imagination that only director Ken Russell can conjure.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared: &quot;It may be the most overproduced movie ever made, but there is wit and reason for this. It is the last word in pop art ... Everything, including the sound level, is too much. But even this works in an odd way. The victim of the movie is as much the person sitting in the audience as it is Tommy.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;spectacular in every way ... The production is magnificent, the multitrack sound (tradenamed Quintaphonic) terrific, the casting and acting great, and the name cameos most showmanly.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, commenting that its message is muddled and hypocritical, but that its focus is on well-executed, grandiose spectacles rather than any pretense at meaning. He called the pinball tournament sequence &quot;the movie&#x27;s best single scene: a pulsating, orgiastic turn-on edited with the precision of a machine gun burst.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded &quot;Tommy&quot; two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling the film &quot;a disappointing, slap-dash pictorialization of the fine music of the Who [with] no cinematic flow.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;an overwhelming, thunderous, almost continuously astonishing achievement, coherent and consistent from first frames to last.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the music of the original album: &quot;...had a certain obscure dignity and integrity, and these qualities don&#x27;t withstand the Russell treatment. On record &quot;Tommy&quot; seemed a bit mysterious. On screen it&#x27;s just banal.&quot; Jonathan Rosenbaum of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that &quot;even at its most lacklustre and tasteless junctures, &quot;Tommy&quot; is never boring, and always full of energy; and given the very loose framework and imprecise plot that Russell has to work with, this is no small achievement.&quot;

In a retrospective review, Perry Seibert of &quot;AllMovie&quot; gave the film four stars out of five and described it as &quot;continuously watchable, but the film version of &quot;Tommy&quot; sacrifices the fragile emotional core of Pete Townshend&#x27;s work for grandiose spectacle.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
==Quintaphonic Sound==
The original release of &quot;Tommy&quot; used a sound system devised by sound engineer John Mosely called &quot;Quintaphonic Sound&quot;. At the time that the film was in production, various &quot;Quadraphonic&quot; (four-speaker) sound systems were being marketed to the domestic HiFi market. Some of these were so-called matrix systems that combined the four original channels into two, which could be recorded on or transmitted by, existing two-channel stereo systems such as LP records or FM radio. John Mosely used one of these systems (QS Regular Matrix from Sansui) to record front left, front right, back left, and back right channels on the left and right tracks of a four-track magnetic striped print of the Cinemascope type. A discrete centre channel was also recorded on the centre track of the print. The fourth (surround) track on the striped print was left unused. In addition, John Mosely used dbx noise reduction on the magnetic tracks.

Unlike the usual multiple small surround speakers used in cinemas, the Quintaphonic system specified just two rear speakers, but of the same type as those used at the front.

One problem that arose was that by the 1970s the four-track magnetic sound system was largely moribund. Only a few theatres were equipped with the necessary magnetic playback heads and other equipment; of those that did in many cases, it was not in working order. Thus, in addition to installing the extra electronics and rear speakers, John Mosely and his team had to repair and align the basic magnetic playback equipment. Each theatre that showed &quot;Tommy&quot; using the Quintaphonic system accordingly had to be specially prepared to take the film. In this respect there is a similarity between &quot;Tommy&quot; and Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia&quot;, for which a special sound system (Fantasound) had been devised and required each theatre that showed it in the original release to be specially prepared. Also, like Fantasound, Quintaphonic Sound was never used again (five-channel audio, in the form of 5.1 surround sound, eventually made a comeback).

&quot;Tommy&quot; was later released with mono, conventional four-track magnetic and Dolby Stereo soundtracks.

The Quintaphonic Sound mix was restored for the DVD and Blu-ray release of the film.

==Changes from the album==
Unlike some other filmed rock operas (such as the only partially re-recorded soundtrack of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot;), the album is never dubbed over the film. All the songs were rerecorded featuring the film&#x27;s cast – including Nicholson and Reed, neither of whom were known for their singing ability (Reed&#x27;s character&#x27;s songs were cut from &quot;Oliver!&quot;, and Nicholson&#x27;s in &quot;On a Clear Day You Can See Forever&quot; appeared only in the now-lost roadshow version) – performing the songs in character. Of the Who, Daltrey performs as Tommy, Moon performs as Uncle Ernie, and Townshend sings narration in place of recitative.

The song order is shuffled around considerably; this and the addition of several new songs and links creates a more balanced structure of alternating short and long sequences. A large number of songs have new lyrics and instrumentation, and another notable feature is that many of the songs and pieces used on the film soundtrack are alternate versions or mixes from the versions on the soundtrack album.

===Differences between 1969 and 1975 versions===
* The film opens with a new instrumental, &quot;Prologue–1945&quot; (partly based on the 1969 &quot;Overture&quot;), which accompanies the opening sequences of Captain Walker&#x27;s romance and disappearance.
* &quot;It&#x27;s a Boy&quot; is separated from &quot;Overture&quot; and becomes the medley &quot;Captain Walker/It&#x27;s A Boy&quot;; in the film this medley narrates the aftermath of Walker&#x27;s disappearance, the end of the war and the birth of Tommy.
* A new song, &quot;Bernie&#x27;s Holiday Camp&quot;, which follows &quot;Captain Walker/It&#x27;s a Boy&quot;, portrays Tommy&#x27;s childhood and his mother&#x27;s romance with Hobbs (Oliver Reed). The song also features the melody from, and even foreshadows, &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Holiday Camp&quot;.
* The story&#x27;s setting is updated so that the action goes through modern times (modern as of the 1970s). From this, the track &quot;1921&quot; from the album is changed to &quot;1951&quot; and is made a medley, being titled &quot;What About the Boy?&quot; on the soundtrack, in which Capt. Walker dies instead of the lover (Frank, in this context).
* &quot;The Amazing Journey&quot; (shortened to three minutes) has almost completely different lyrics, and the &quot;guide&quot; from the album is depicted as Tommy&#x27;s dead father, rather than the &quot;tall stranger&quot; in a &quot;sparked, glittering gown&quot; from the album. A new introduction is also added in lieu of the &quot;Deaf, dumb, and blind boy; he&#x27;s in a quiet vibration land...&quot; from the album. The movie version also ends with different fantastic lyrics, going &quot;His eyes are the eyes that transmit all he knows, The truth burns so bright it can melt winter snows. A towering shadow, so black and so high, A white sun burning the earth and the sky.&quot;.
* The running order of &quot;Christmas&quot; and &quot;Eyesight to the Blind&quot; is reversed; references to pinball are removed from &quot;Christmas&quot; and the character of The Hawker becomes The Preacher (Clapton), leader of the Marilyn Monroe cult. Arthur Brown is cast as the character The Priest in the film, and sings a verse in the song but is not featured on the soundtrack. According to Russell&#x27;s DVD audio commentary, the concept of people literally worshipping celebrities (in this case Marilyn Monroe) and several other elements in the film were adapted from his pre-existing treatment for a film about false religions, which he had developed prior to &quot;Tommy&quot; but for which he had never been able to secure financial backing.
* The running order of &quot;The Acid Queen&quot; and &quot;Cousin Kevin&quot; is reversed.
* &quot;Underture&quot; is removed but parts from it have been re-arranged as &quot;Sparks&quot;.
* &quot;Cousin Kevin&quot;, &quot;Fiddle About&quot;, and &quot;Sparks&quot;, linked by three renditions of &quot;Do You Think It&#x27;s Alright?&quot; form an extended sequence depicting Tommy&#x27;s inner journey and his trials.
* A three-minute version of the &quot;Sparks&quot; theme (with, then new, synthesizer orchestration) precedes &quot;Extra, Extra, Extra&quot; and &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;. In the film, it is used behind the sequence of the dazed Tommy wandering into a junkyard and discovering a pinball machine. The music on the film soundtrack (for this and many other songs) is heavily edited, however, and is a noticeably different mix from the version on the soundtrack album.
* A new linking theme, &quot;Extra, Extra, Extra&quot;, narrates Tommy&#x27;s rise to fame and introduces the battle with the pinball champ. It is set to the tune of &quot;Miracle Cure&quot; and precedes &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;.
* &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot; has extra lyrics and movements. It features guitar and keyboard solos (the guitars are only readily discernible on the soundtrack album), and an outro with a riff reminiscent of the Who&#x27;s first single, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot;.
* A new song, &quot;Champagne&quot;, which follows &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;, covers the sequence of Tommy&#x27;s stardom and wealth and his parents&#x27; greed. Like many other songs, it features Tommy singing &quot;See Me, Feel Me&quot; interludes: this is the first song with &quot;Daltrey&quot; singing for Tommy. In the film (but not on the soundtrack), the song is introduced by a mock TV commercial—reminiscent of the Who&#x27;s early years when they made jingles.
* &quot;Go to the Mirror&quot; is shortened, not featuring the elements of &quot;Listening To You&quot;, nor the phrase &quot;Go to the mirror, boy.&quot;
* &quot;I&#x27;m Free&quot; is moved earlier, and now follows &quot;Smash The Mirror!&quot; (as was done on the 1972 symphonic album); it covers the lavish psychedelic sequence depicting Tommy&#x27;s reawakening.
* &quot;I&#x27;m Free&quot; is followed by a new song, &quot;Mother and Son&quot;, which depicts Tommy&#x27;s rejection of materialism and his vision for a new faith based around pinball.
* &quot;Sensation&quot;, featuring extra lyrics, is moved forward and covers the spread of Tommy&#x27;s new religion. In the film it occurs between &quot;Sally Simpson&quot; and &quot;Welcome&quot;. (On the soundtrack album, it occurs between &quot;Mother and Son&quot; and &quot;Miracle Cure&quot;—with the extra [narration] lyrics and guitar solo included on the cassette and CD versions, but not the LP version.)
* &quot;Sally Simpson&quot; is re-arranged with a Bo Diddley beat and in the film is preceded by &quot;Miracle Cure&quot;—which features an extra verse.
* In &quot;Sally Simpson&quot;, the album version mentions her father&#x27;s Rolls-Royce as blue, but the film changes the lyrics to black (the Rolls-Royce in the film is also black).
* In &quot;Sally Simpson&quot;, the album version describes Tommy giving a lesson. In the film, Tommy gives a lesson, and the lyrics are changed to the words of the lesson.
* In the album version of &quot;Sally Simpson&quot;, the title character jumps on the stage and brushes Tommy&#x27;s cheek, but in the movie she is kicked off the stage before she can get close to Tommy.
* A new linking piece, &quot;T.V. Studio&quot;, is used between &quot;Welcome&quot; and &quot;Tommy&#x27;s Holiday Camp&quot;.
* The 1969 album&#x27;s closing track &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; is split into two pieces, &quot;We&#x27;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; and medley &quot;See Me Feel Me/Listening To You&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;SM FM/LTY&quot;&gt;&quot;See Me, Feel Me/Listening To You&quot; is the name given in the song book for the soundtrack album; the soundtrack album itself calls it &quot;Listening To You/See Me, Feel Me&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; this covers the climactic film sequences of Tommy&#x27;s fall from grace and his final redemption and opens with an extra chorus sung by the crowd (&quot;These pricey deals don&#x27;t teach us...&quot;).
* The CD reissue of the soundtrack album opens with a version &quot;Overture From Tommy&quot; previously released on a vinyl single in 1975, but not included either in the film or on the original soundtrack LP. Although the track is listed in the CD&#x27;s song credits as being performed by The Who, it is actually a Pete Townshend solo number with him playing all the instruments (as with &quot;Prologue – 1945&quot; and other tracks)—neither John Entwistle or Keith Moon appear on it, as they do on all other selections on the soundtrack credited to &quot;The Who,&quot; regardless of whether Roger Daltrey performs as vocalist.

<text>Major-General Frank Crowther Roberts, (2 June 1891 – 12 January 1982) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Frank Crowther Roberts was born on 2 June 1891 in Highbury, London, the son of Rev. Frank Roberts, vicar of St John&#x27;s Church, Southall. 
 He was educated at St Lawrence College, Ramsgate and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he graduated and was subsequently commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Worcestershire Regiment on 4 March 1911. Roberts was soon posted to the 1st Battalion of his regiment and was sent, along with his battalion, to Alexandria, Egypt, in the following year, to relieve the 2nd Battalion, Worcesters. Roberts was still there upon the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.

==First World War==
Roberts, promoted to lieutenant on 3 September 1914, along with his battalion, then commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George Grogan, returned to the United Kingdom shortly after the declaration of war and arrived there in October 1914, where it became part of the 24th Brigade of the newly formed 8th Division, which was then in the process of formation. The battalion was sent to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front and landed in France in November 1914.

The battalion was involved in the winter operations 1914–1915 and participated in the Christmas truce, although it is not known if Roberts himself took part. Just less than two months after his arrival in France, Roberts was already proving himself in action, which resulted in his being awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) while leading a trench raid. He was made his battalion&#x27;s adjutant and fought in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, and was promoted to captain on 6 August 1915 He remained an adjutant until October 1916 when he was made a brigade major of the 8th Division&#x27;s 23rd Brigade. In this capacity, during the Battle of Passchendaele (also known as the Third Battle of Ypres) in August 1917, Roberts was awarded the Military Cross (MC). His MC citation states the following:

On 24 October 1917 he returned to the 1st Battalion, Worcesters and, aged just twenty-six, was promoted to the acting rank of lieutenant-colonel, and given temporary command of the battalion, becoming one of the British Army&#x27;s youngest battalion commanders.

He was 26 years old, and an acting lieutenant-colonel in the 1st Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. Lieutenant-Colonel Roberts showed exceptional military skill during the period 22 March – 2 April 1918, in the German spring offensive, west of the Somme and at the village of Pargny, France.

During continuous operations which covered over twelve days Lt-Col Roberts showed most conspicuous bravery, exceptional military skill in dealing with the many very difficult situations of the retirement, and amazing endurance and energy in encouraging and inspiring all ranks under his command.

On one occasion the enemy attacked a village and had practically cleared it of our troops, when this officer got together an improvised party and led a counter-attack which temporarily drove the enemy out of the village, thus covering the retirement of troops on their flanks who would otherwise have been cut off.

The success of this action was entirely due to his personal valour and skill.

Roberts was wounded on 27 March and returned to England for treatment, returning to his battalion on 17 June, where he again assumed command, leading the battalion during the Hundred Days Offensive until the armistice of 11 November 1918. During the First World War, Roberts was wounded three times and mentioned in despatches six times.

==Between the wars==
He remained in the army during the interwar period, reverting to his permanent rank of captain and serving briefly with the Egyptian Army in the Sudan from 16 February 1919. Returning to England, Roberts attended the Staff College, Camberley, entering in January 1921, shortly afterwards being made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), and graduating in December 1922. Among his many fellow students there were Eric Costin, James Gammell, John Priestman, Edward Alban, Merton Beckwith-Smith, Russell Gurney, Francis Nosworthy, Giffard Martel, John Kennedy, Ridley Pakenham-Walsh, Ralph Eastwood, Edwin Morris, Eric Miles, Robert Naylor, Thomas Corbett, Ernest Squires, Austin Miller, William Baker and Edmund Osborne, all of whom would, like Roberts, become general officers. He later served in Egypt in 1923–24 and with the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). He transferred to the Royal Warwickshire Regiment as a major in July 1927 and served with the regiment&#x27;s 2nd Battalion in India and the Middle East. His next appointment was as a General Staff Officer Grade 3 (GSO3) with the Iraqi Army and, for his service in Southern Kurdistan, was promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel.

He married Winifred Margaret Wragg at Bretby, Derbyshire on 23 April 1932; she was the sister of Herbert Wragg MP.

He was made a brevet colonel in 1932 and promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 24 November 1936. In January 1935 he served as a GSO2 with Northern Ireland District. In 1937 Roberts became CO of the 1st Battalion, Royal Warwickshires and went with the battalion to India. The following year he became commander of the Poona Brigade of the Indian Army, an unusual posting for an officer of the British Army but a clear sign that his star was on the rise, and was granted the local rank of brigadier from 9 April 1937 until 8 November 1937, before reverting to colonel, when he relinquished command. Returning to England, he was promoted to the rank of major-general on 1 June 1939 (with seniority backdated to 13 June 1939), three months before the outbreak of the Second World War, and became General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division, a Territorial Army (TA) formation. Aged just 48, he was one of the youngest divisional commanders in the British Army, only Major-General The Hon. Harold Alexander, GOC of the 1st Infantry Division, and Major-General William Holmes, GOC of the 42nd (East Lancashire) Infantry Division, being younger.

==Second World War and retirement==
The 48th Division – comprising the 143rd, 144th and 145th Infantry Brigades along with supporting units – being a first-line TA formation, was poorly trained and equipped, lacking in modern weapons and equipment, had to be rapidly trained to Regular standards in order to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) serving in France. However, in October, Roberts handed over command of the division to Major-General Andrew Thorne and retired from the army on 16 December 1939, three months after the outbreak of the war, after twenty-eight years of military service.

Roberts and his wife, who died 22 December 1980, settled in Stanhope Bretby, Derbyshire. Having no children, he remained there until his death on 12 January 1982 at the age of 90. He was cremated at Bretby crematorium and his ashes buried in his wife&#x27;s family grave in St Wystan&#x27;s churchyard, Bretby.

His VC is displayed at the Worcestershire Regimental Collection in the Worcester City Art Gallery &amp; Museum, Worcester, England.

<doc id="1221722" wikidata="Q4910334" url="?curid=1221722" title="Bill Newton">
<text>William Ellis Newton, VC (8 June 1919 – 29 March 1943) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to a member of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. He was honoured for his actions as a bomber pilot in Papua New Guinea during March 1943 when, despite intense anti-aircraft fire, he pressed home a series of attacks on the Salamaua Isthmus, the last of which saw him forced to ditch his aircraft in the sea. Newton was still officially posted as missing when the award was made in October 1943. It later emerged that he had been taken captive by the Japanese, and executed by beheading on 29 March.

Raised in Melbourne, Newton excelled at sport, playing cricket at youth state level. He joined the Citizen Military Forces in 1938 and enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in February 1940. Described as having the dash of &quot;an Errol Flynn or a Keith Miller&quot;, Newton served as a flying instructor in Australia before being posted to No. 22 Squadron, which began operating Boston light bombers in New Guinea late in 1942. Having just taken part in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, he was on his fifty-second mission when he was shot down and captured. Newton was the only Australian airman to receive a Victoria Cross for action in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II, and the sole Australian to be so decorated while flying with an RAAF squadron.

==Family, education and sport==
Born in the Melbourne suburb of St Kilda on 8 June 1919, Bill Newton was the youngest child of dentist Charles Ellis Newton and his second wife Minnie. His three older half-siblings from Charles&#x27; earlier marriage included two brothers, John and Lindsay, and a sister, Phyllis. Bill entered Melbourne Grammar School in 1929, but two years later switched to the nearby St Kilda Park Central School as the family income was reduced through the impact of the Great Depression. In 1934, aged fifteen, he was able to return to Melbourne Grammar where, despite struggling with his schoolwork, he completed his Intermediate certificate. He gave up further study when his father died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of fifty-one, and began working in a silk warehouse.

Considered while at school to be a future leader in the community, Newton was also a talented all-round sportsman, playing cricket, Australian rules football, golf and water polo. A fast bowler in cricket, he was friends with Keith Miller, and collected the Victorian Cricket Association (VCA) Colts bowling trophy for 1937–38; Miller collected the equivalent batting prize. In January 1938, Newton dismissed Test batsman Bill Ponsford—still the only Australian to have twice scored 400 in a first-class innings—for four in a Colts game at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The following year, he gained selection in the Victorian Second XI. He opened the bowling against the New South Wales Second XI—his first and only match—taking a total of 3/113 including the wickets of Ron Saggers and Arthur Morris who, like Miller, went on to become members of the &quot;Invincibles&quot;.

==Early career==
Newton had been a sergeant in his cadet corps at school, and joined the Citizens Military Force on 28 November 1938, serving as a private in the machine-gun section of the 6th Battalion, Royal Melbourne Regiment. Still employed in the silk warehouse when World War II broke out in September 1939, he resigned to join the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 5 February 1940. He had earlier attempted to enlist when he turned eighteen in 1937, but his mother refused to give her permission; with Australia now at war, she consented. His brothers—dentists by profession, like their father—also enlisted in the armed forces, John as a surgeon lieutenant in the Royal Australian Navy and Lindsay as a captain in the Army Medical Corps.
Newton undertook basic training with No. 1 Elementary Flying Training School in Parafield, South Australia, flying De Havilland Tiger Moths, and with No. 21 (City of Melbourne) Squadron at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, flying CAC Wirraways. He was awarded his wings and commissioned as a pilot officer on 28 June 1940. Following advanced training on Avro Ansons with No. 1 Service Flying Training School at RAAF Point Cook in September, he was selected to become a flight instructor. He completed the requisite course at Central Flying School in Camden, New South Wales, and was promoted to flying officer on 28 December. He subsequently began training students under the Empire Air Training Scheme at No. 2 Service Flying Training School near Wagga Wagga, under the command of Group Captain Frederick Scherger.

In October 1941, Newton transferred to No. 5 Service Flying Training School at Uranquinty. He found instruction frustrating, as he longed for a combat assignment. His fortunes changed in February 1942, when he was selected for the navigation course on Ansons at the General Reconnaissance School based at Laverton. From there he was sent to No. 1 Operational Training Unit at Sale, Victoria, for conversion to Lockheed Hudson twin-engined light bombers during March and April.

Promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 April 1942, Newton was posted the following month to No. 22 (City of Sydney) Squadron, based at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales. Previously equipped with Hudsons, the unit had just begun converting to the more advanced Douglas Boston when Newton arrived. A comrade described him as a &quot;big brash, likeable man who could drink most of us under the table, was a good pilot, good at sports, and had a way with girls&quot;. No. 22 Squadron was engaged in convoy escort and anti-submarine patrols off Sydney from July to September, before moving north to Townsville, Queensland. In November, it was deployed to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea, under the control of No. 9 Operational Group RAAF.

==New Guinea campaign==
Newton undertook the first of his fifty-two operational sorties on 1 January 1943, under the leadership of his commanding officer, Squadron Leader Keith Hampshire. During February, Newton flew low-level missions through monsoon conditions and hazardous mountain terrain, attacking Japanese forces ranged against Allied troops in the Morobe province. In early March, he took part in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, one of the key engagements in the South West Pacific theatre, bombing and strafing Lae airfield to prevent its force of enemy fighters taking off to intercept Allied aircraft attacking the Japanese fleet. Newton gained a reputation for driving straight at his targets without evasive manoeuvre, and always leaving them in flames; this earned him the nickname &quot;The Firebug&quot;. The Japanese gunners reportedly knew him as &quot;Blue Cap&quot;, from his habit of wearing an old blue cricket cap on operations. In spite of the hazards of the air war in New Guinea, he was quoted as saying, &quot;The troops on the ground should get two medals each, before any airman gets one&quot;.

===Attacks on Salamaua===

On 16 March 1943, Newton led a sortie on the Salamaua Isthmus in which his Boston was hit repeatedly by Japanese anti-aircraft fire, suffering damage to its fuselage, wings, fuel tanks, and undercarriage. He continued his attack and dropped his bombs at low level on buildings, ammunition dumps and fuel stores, returning for a second pass at the target to strafe it with machine-gun fire. Newton managed to get his crippled machine back to base, where it was found to be marked with ninety-eight bullet holes. Two days later, he and his two-man crew made a further attack on Salamaua with five other Bostons. As he bombed his designated target, Newton&#x27;s plane was seen to burst into flames, having been raked by cannon fire from the ground. Attempting to keep his aircraft aloft as long as possible to get his crew away from enemy lines, he was able to ditch in the sea approximately offshore.

The Boston&#x27;s navigator, Sergeant Basil Eastwood, was killed in the forced landing but Newton and his wireless operator, Flight Sergeant John Lyon, survived and managed to swim ashore. Several of the other aircraft in the flight circled the area; one returned to base straight away to inform Hampshire, and the remainder were later forced to depart through lack of fuel. Newton and Lyon originally made their way inland with the help of natives, aiming to contact an Australian Coastwatcher, but subsequently returned to the coast. There they were captured by a Japanese patrol of No. 5 Special Naval Landing Force. The two airmen were taken to Salamaua and interrogated until 20 March, before being moved to Lae, where Lyon was bayoneted to death on the orders of Rear Admiral Ruitaro Fujita, the senior Japanese commander in the area. Newton was taken back to Salamaua where, on 29 March 1943, he was ceremonially beheaded with a samurai sword by Sub-Lieutenant Uichi Komai, the naval officer who had captured him. Komai was killed in the Philippines soon afterwards, and Fujita committed suicide at the end of the war.

===Revelations and reactions===

It was initially believed that Newton had failed to escape from the Boston after it ditched into the sea, and he was posted as missing. Hampshire had immediately dispatched a sortie to recover the pair that were last seen swimming for shore, but no sign of them was found. Two weeks later, he wrote a letter to Newton&#x27;s mother in which he described her son&#x27;s courage and expressed the hope that he might yet be found alive. Hampshire concluded, &quot;Bill is one of those rare fellows I shall miss for a long time, and if it is to be, remember for an age&quot;. The details of his capture and execution were only revealed later that year in a diary found on a Japanese soldier. Newton was not specifically named, but he was identified by circumstantial evidence: the diary entry recorded the beheading of an Australian flight lieutenant who had been shot down by anti-aircraft fire on 18 March 1943 while flying a Douglas aircraft. The Japanese observer described the prisoner as &quot;composed&quot; in the face of his impending execution, and &quot;unshaken to the last&quot;. After the decapitation, a seaman slashed open the dead man&#x27;s stomach, declaring, &quot;Something for the other day. Take that.&quot;

General Headquarters South West Pacific Area released details of the execution on 5 October, but initially refused to name Newton due to the lack of absolute certainty as to identification. Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, Air Officer Commanding RAAF Command, contended that naming him would change the impact of the news upon Newton&#x27;s fellow No. 22 Squadron members &quot;from the impersonal to the closely personal&quot; and hence &quot;seriously affect morale&quot;. News of the atrocity provoked shock in Australia. In an attempt to alleviate anxiety among the families of other missing airmen, the Federal government announced on 12 October that the relatives of the slain man had been informed of his death.

===Victoria Cross===
Newton was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 16–18 March, becoming the only Australian airman to earn the decoration in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II, and the only one while flying with an RAAF squadron. The citation, which incorrectly implied that he was shot down on 17 March rather than the following day, and as having failed to escape from his sinking aircraft, was promulgated in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 19 October 1943:

==Legacy==

Buried initially in an unmarked bomb crater in Salamaua, Newton&#x27;s body was recovered and re-interred in Lae War Cemetery after Salamaua&#x27;s capture by Allied troops in September 1943. His grave marker bears the epitaph . In early 1944, the recently constructed No. 4 Airfield in Nadzab was renamed Newton Field in his honour. For many years, the story of Newton&#x27;s death was intertwined with that of an Australian commando, Sergeant Len Siffleet, who had also been captured in New Guinea. A photograph showing Siffleet about to be beheaded was discovered by American troops in April 1944 and was thought to have depicted Newton in Salamaua, but there is no known photograph of the airman&#x27;s execution.

Newton&#x27;s mother Minnie was presented with her son&#x27;s Victoria Cross by the Governor-General, the Duke of Gloucester, on 30 November 1945. She donated it to the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, where it remains on display with his other medals. Newton is also commemorated on Canberra&#x27;s Remembrance Driveway. In the 1990s, his friend Keith Miller successfully fought to ensure that the Victoria Racing Club abandoned a plan to rename the William Ellis Newton Steeplechase—run on Anzac Day—after a commercial sponsor. Later in the decade, Miller also publicly questioned Australia Post&#x27;s exclusion of Newton from a series of stamps featuring notable Australians such as cricketer Sir Donald Bradman. A plaque dedicated to No. 22 Squadron was unveiled at the Australian War Memorial by the Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Angus Houston, on 16 March 2003, the sixtieth anniversary of Newton&#x27;s attack on Salamaua.

<text>Andrew Charles Mynarski, VC (14 October 1916 – 13 June 1944) was a Canadian airman and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for bravery in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Mynarski was 27 years old and flew with No. 419 &quot;Moose&quot; Squadron, Royal Canadian Air Force during the Second World War when he died attempting to help rescue a trapped crew member. His Victoria Cross, which was awarded in 1946, was the last Victoria Cross received by any Canadian serviceman in the Second World War.

==Early years==
Mynarski was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on 14 October 1916, the son of Polish immigrants. Known as Andy to his close friends, he had five other siblings, two brothers and three sisters. Mynarski was educated at King Edward and Isaac Newton Elementary Schools, later graduating from St. John&#x27;s Technical School. To help support his family after his father&#x27;s death, at the age of 16, he worked as a chamois cutter.

==Wartime service==
In 1940, Mynarski joined the Royal Winnipeg Rifles, a militia unit, but only served a short time before enlisting in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). In September 1941, he was posted to No. 3 Manning Depot in Edmonton. After basic training, he went to No. 2 Wireless School in Calgary but had trouble learning Morse Code. He was then posted to No. 3 Bomb and Gunnery School at RCAF Station MacDonald, MacDonald, Manitoba, graduating just before Christmas as an air-gunner, earning his &quot;AG&quot; brevet.

Mynarski was promoted to temporary sergeant in Halifax just prior to going overseas in January 1942. After a series of transfers through operational training units, as a warrant officer (second class), he joined Flying Officer Art de Breyne&#x27;s crew as the mid-upper gunner in No. 419 &quot;Moose&quot; Squadron, based at RAF Middleton St. George, Darlington, County Durham.

The squadron first flew combat operations using Vickers Wellington bombers before converting to the Handley Page Halifax bombers. After a short introduction to this four-engine heavy bomber, 419 Squadron began to receive the Avro Lancaster bomber in 1944, including examples built in Canada by the Victory Aircraft Company in Malton, Ontario. In early June, de Bryne&#x27;s crew received Canadian-built Avro Lancaster Mk X bomber, #&quot;KB726&quot;, coded &quot;VR-A&quot; (call sign A for Able).
===Mynarski&#x27;s last &quot;op&quot;===
In the aftermath of D-Day attacks on 12 June 1944, Mynarski was aboard KB726, taking part in the crew&#x27;s 12th operation, a raid on Cambrai in northern France. They reached their target at midnight, Tuesday 13 June. After encountering flak over the coastline and briefly being &quot;coned&quot; by searchlights, the Lancaster was attacked by a Junkers Ju 88 enemy night fighter. Raked by cannon fire with major strikes on the port engines and centre fuselage, a hydraulic fire engulfed the bomber. Losing both port engines, de Breyne ordered the crew to bail out. As Mynarski approached the rear escape door, he saw through the inferno in the rear, that tail gunner Pilot Officer Pat Brophy was trapped in his turret. The tail turret had been jammed part way through its rotation to the escape position.

Without hesitation, Mynarski made his way through the flames to Brophy&#x27;s assistance. All his efforts were in vain, initially using a fire axe to try to pry open the doors before finally resorting to beating at the turret with his hands. With Mynarski&#x27;s flight suit and parachute on fire, Brophy eventually waved him away. Mynarski crawled back through the hydraulic fire, returned to the rear door where he paused and saluted. He then reputedly said &quot;Good night, sir,&quot; his familiar nightly sign-off to his friend, and jumped.

Except for Brophy, all crew members of the Lancaster managed to escape the burning bomber. Five left through the front escape hatch on the floor of the cockpit. When bomb aimer Jack Friday, tried to release the escape hatch cover in the aircraft&#x27;s nose, the rushing wind ripped it from his hands. The hatch cover caught him above his left eye and knocked him out. He fell into the open hatch and jammed it closed until Flight engineer Roy Vigars reached him to quickly clip on Friday&#x27;s parachute and toss him out the hatch while pulling the unconscious crewman&#x27;s rip cord. Only Mynarski managed to leave via the rear escape door.

Mynarski&#x27;s descent was rapid due to the burnt parachute and shroud lines, resulting in a heavy impact on landing. He landed alive though severely burned, with his clothes still on fire. French farmers who spotted the flaming bomber found him and took him to a German field hospital but he died shortly afterwards of severe burns. He was buried in a local cemetery. Brophy remained trapped in the bomber when it crashed in a farm field. As the bomber disintegrated, and began breaking apart, Brophy survived the crash and the subsequent detonation of the bomb load. Still lodged in his turret, the crash broke the turret open with him pitched out, striking a tree and being temporarily knocked out.

Four of the crew members: Brophy, navigator Robert Bodie, radio operator James Kelly and pilot de Breyne were hidden by the French and, except for Brophy, returned to England shortly after the crash. Vigars remained with the unconscious Friday and both were captured by the Germans, being interned until liberated by American troops. Brophy joined French Resistance fighters and, after joining a resistance unit to continue the fight on the ground behind enemy lines, returned to London in September 1944, where he learned of Mynarski&#x27;s death. It was not until 1945 when Brophy was reunited with the rest of the crew that the details of his final moments on the aircraft were revealed. He related the story of the valiant efforts made by Mynarski to save him.

Mynarski lies buried in Grave 20 of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission plot in the Méharicourt Communal Cemetery, near Amiens, France.
==Legacy==

===Victoria Cross===
In late 1945, de Breyne started the process of gaining recognition for Mynarski&#x27;s extraordinary deed by recommending an award and enquiring about the location of his grave. Although facing some initial resistance, the recommendation worked its way up the command structure of the RCAF and RAF. On 11 October 1946, a Victoria Cross was posthumously awarded for &quot;valour of the highest order&quot; to Andrew Charles Mynarski, by then also awarded the rank of pilot officer.

===Remembering Andrew Mynarski===
Mynarski&#x27;s Victoria Cross was loaned by his family to Air Command in 1989 and is on display in the entrance foyer at the Mynarski Memorial Room of the Headquarters, 1 Canadian Air Division, in Winnipeg (where a number of other family artifacts are on display). No. 419 Squadron in CFB Cold Lake also displays the original fire axe that Mynarski used to try to free the jammed Lancaster turret; the axe was recovered from the Lancaster bomber at the crash site in northern France.

Andrew Mynarski VC School in Winnipeg, the Mynarski municipal ward of Winnipeg, a park in Alberta, the Royal Canadian Legion &quot;Andrew Mynarski&quot; Branch 34, and 573 &quot;Andrew Mynarski&quot; Air Cadet squadron all bear his name. A chain of three lakes in Manitoba has been named after him by the Geographical Placenames of Canada and at CFB Penhold, one of the locations in which he trained, the married quarters area is known as Mynarski Park. Mynarski was also honoured in 1973 when he was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Aviation Hall of Fame. 

Avro Lancaster FM213 of the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in Hamilton, Ontario, one of only two airworthy Lancasters in the world, is known as the Mynarski Memorial Lancaster in honour of Mynarski, and is painted in the markings of his aircraft.

Mynarski&#x27;s bust has joined the other &quot;Valiants&quot; when the Valiants Memorial was unveiled in Ottawa, Ontario. This memorial site is a collection of nine busts and five statues and a large bronze wall inscription that commemorates 14 individuals celebrated for their personal contributions, but also representing critical moments in Canada&#x27;s military history.
A larger-than-life bronze statue of Pilot Officer Mynarski, sculpted by Keith Maddison, was dedicated in 2005 outside the former Officers&#x27; Mess, now the St George Hotel, at RAF Middleton St. George, the bomber base in England where he served. The memorial depicts Mynarski at the rear of the stricken aircraft, his right arm raised in a salute. Andrew Mynarski is also remembered at the St George Hotel by the &quot;Mynarski Bar&quot;, a bar dedicated to him where images of him and a replica VC are on display.

A local Polish organization from the community area near where Mynarski grew up has erected a memorial plaque in Winnipeg&#x27;s Kildonan Park to honour Mynarski.

In January 2006, a group of local Winnipeggers prominent in business, government, heritage, military and community organizations embarked on a fund-raising project to cast and erect in Winnipeg, a new statue in a campaign known as &quot;Bring Andrew home&quot;. The Mynarski Statue Project operated under the auspices of the Air Cadet League of Canada (Manitoba) Inc. including the parents&#x27; committee of 573 Andrew Mynarski VC Royal Canadian Air Cadets Squadron, with support from the Canadian Aviation Historical Society. The Mynarski Statue Project Committee coordinated fundraising and community support and received important media coverage through journalist Mr. Gordon Sinclair Jr. of the Winnipeg Free Press.

After learning that the original mould used to cast the statue at St. George was feasibly unavailable to use for a new statue in Winnipeg, the Committee decided to consider alternatives around 2008–2009. In December 2009, Mr. Charles Johnston, a Winnipeg sculptor/artist was selected to create a new statue.

Fundraising and communication efforts continued until 2010, when a Winnipeg business owner and philanthropist, Brian Frank Klaponski became involved. After learning that his uncle had grown up with Andrew Mynarski and had been Mynarski&#x27;s best friend at Isaac Newton School in Winnipeg&#x27;s North End in the 1930s, Klaponski offered a significant donation for the project. That donation catalyzed the final statue design and approval process.
The artist presented several concepts to the Committee as sketches and maquettes, with the final statue design chosen in 2013. Johnston created a full-size clay model and arranged to have it cast in bronze in early 2014. He brought it home to Winnipeg from the U.S. foundry that summer. It was unveiled to the public during a reception held 14 November 2014 at Winnipeg&#x27;s Frame Arts Warehouse.

Winnipeg&#x27;s Andrew Mynarski VC Memorial Statue will be dedicated in Winnipeg&#x27;s Vimy Ridge Memorial Park during a public ceremony at 1:00 p.m. on 12 June 2015.

===In the media===
Mynarski&#x27;s story has been dramatised in the Canadian Historica Foundation&#x27;s series of Heritage Minutes. Mynarski was also profiled in the 2006 docudrama &quot;Victoria Cross Heroes&quot; which included archive footage and dramatisations of his Victoria Cross-winning action. His story was recently recounted in &quot;As Close as Brothers&quot; (2011) documentary, shot in Canada using the Mynarski Memorial Lancaster as well as an Avro Lancaster bomber and artifacts at the Bomber Command Museum in Nanton, Alberta.

The eight-minute film &quot;Mynarski Death Plummet&quot; (2014), directed by Matthew Rankin, looks expressionistically at the final moments in Mynarski&#x27;s life. The film played at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival and was selected for the 2015 Sundance Film Festival.

<text>Frederick Charles Riggs (28 July 1888 – 1 October 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
He was born in Springbourne, Bournemouth, and was adopted by Mrs G. Burgum when he was about five years old. He grew up in the Malmesbury Park area of Bournemouth, and was one of two recipients of the Victoria Cross from Capstone Road; the other being Cecil Reginald Noble. A nearby neighbourhood of Bournemouth is named Charminster, and has led to the confused suggestion that Noble lived in the village of Charminster in Dorset. He lived at 39 Capstone Road and attended Malmesbury Park Primary School as it is known now. There is a memorial for him now inside the school.

==Details==
Riggs was 30 years old, and a Sergeant in the 6th Battalion, The York and Lancaster Regiment, British Army during the First World War at the battle of the Canal du Nord when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 1 October 1918 near Epinoy, France, Sergeant Riggs, having led his platoon through strong uncut wire under severe fire, continued straight on and although losing heavily from flanking fire, succeeded in reaching his objective, where he captured a machine-gun. Later he handled two captured guns with great effect and caused 50 of the enemy to surrender. Subsequently, when the enemy again advanced in force, Sergeant Riggs cheerfully encouraged his men exhorting them to resist to the last, and while doing so was killed.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at The York and Lancaster Regiment Museum contained within the Clifton Park Museum in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England.

<text>Matthew Rosamond VC (12 July 1823 – 14 July 1866) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

The christening record for Matthew Rosamond in 1823 shows his parents as George Rosamond and his wife Elizabeth. Matthew Rosamond married Bridget Mahoney in Agra, West Bengal on 21 July 1851. The English 1861 census for Eaton Socon in Bedfordshire, shows Matthew Rosamond home from India five years before his death. Just prior to his death, he married Alice Wollen in 1865 in Serampore, Bengal, India.

Rosamond was born in the village of St. Neots, Huntingdonshire (some records say Swallow Cliffe, Wiltshire; other says Seaton Town, Bedfordshire), the son and grandson of soldiers.

==Victoria Cross==
Rosamund was 33 years old, and a sergeant-major in the 37th Bengal Native Infantry, Bengal Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed on 4 June 1857 at Benares led to the award of the Victoria Cross for Rosamund, Sergeant-Major Peter Gill and Private John Kirk:
Rosamund later achieved the rank of lieutenant but died on board ship and was buried in the Red Sea at the age of 43. His VC medal was sold at auction in 1903 and has not been located since.

A blue plaque has been erected in the village of Eaton Socon in Bedfordshire with the correct spelling of his surname which reads &quot;Matthew Rosamond VC – On 4th June 1857 Matthew Rosamond, a relative of the Rosamond bakers on this site, won the Victoria Cross during the Indian Mutiny. He died on the Red Sea on 14th July 1866 and was buried at sea. This building was built by Budd&#x27;s Bakers as a new bakehouse around 1930, replacing a much older timber framed property.&quot;

<text>Colonel Richard Kirby Ridgeway (18 August 1848 – 11 October 1924) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Ridgeway was born on 18 August 1848 in Oldcastle, County Meath, Ireland. He was commissioned into the British Army on 8 January 1868, and promoted to lieutenant on 14 February 1870.

===Victoria Cross===
On 22 November 1879, he was 31 years old, and a captain in the Bengal Staff Corps, 44th Gurkha Rifles (later 1/8th Gurkha Rifles), British Indian Army, during the Naga Hills Expedition. On that date, during the final assault on Konoma, Eastern Frontier of India, under heavy fire from the enemy, Captain Ridgeway rushed up to a barricade and attempted to tear down the planking surrounding it to enable him to effect an entrance. While doing this he was wounded severely in the right shoulder.

===Later career===
He was appointed assistant adjutant-general of the Peshawar district, part of the Punjab Command, on 29 April 1895, and was promoted to the rank of colonel on 8 January 1898. After an extended furlough back home, he resigned in early 1900, and did not return to India.

He died at the age of 76 in Harrogate, Yorkshire on 11 October 1924.

<text>Charles Pope, VC (5 March 1883 – 15 April 1917) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He received the Victoria Cross posthumously for his actions on 15 April 1917 on the Western Front at the Battle of Lagnicourt, which took place during the First World War.

==Early life==
Born in Mile End, London, on 5 March 1883, Charles Pope&#x27;s parents were William, a Metropolitan Police constable, and Jane Pope (born Clark). He attended school in Navestock, Essex, before moving to Canada where he worked for Canadian Pacific Railways. He returned to England in 1906 and joined the Metropolitan Police. Later that year, at St Luke&#x27;s Anglican Church in Chelsea, he married Edith Smith, with whom he later had two children, Edith Maude and Charles William. In 1910, Pope resigned from the police force and moved his family to Perth, Western Australia. He took up work as a furniture salesman and then took on a role in the insurance sector.

==Military career==
Amidst the backdrop of the First World War, Pope enlisted with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 31 August 1915, volunteering to serve overseas as part of Australia&#x27;s commitment to the First World War. Assigned as a reinforcement to 11th Battalion, which had been formed largely from Western Australians and was at the time fighting at Gallipoli, after training he was quickly made a sergeant. By February 1916, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant and four months later sailed for England, to join the battalion, which had been transferred to Europe following its evacuation from Gallipoli, along with a batch of reinforcements. Sailing on HMAT &quot;Ajana&quot;, he arrived at Plymouth on 1 September 1916.

On 9 December 1916, Pope arrived on the Western Front reporting to the 11th Battalion, which was camped around Bazentin le Grand for the winter having fought at Pozières and Mouquet Farm earlier in the year. Later that month he was promoted to lieutenant and in early 1917 he attended the divisional school. Pope subsequently fought in actions around Flers, Le Barque, and Ligny–Thilloy. On 15 April 1917 at Louverval, France, during the Battle of Lagnicourt, he was in command of a very important picquet post, with orders to hold it at all costs amidst a heavy German attack. The enemy, in greatly superior numbers, attacked and surrounded the post and ammunition was running short. Pope, in a desperate bid to save the position, was &quot;seen to charge with his men into a superior enemy force, by which they were overpowered&quot;, although heavy losses were inflicted. He had &quot;obeyed the order to hold out to the last&quot; and his lifeless body, along with those of most of his men, was found amongst 80 enemy dead.
The 11th Battalion, despite suffering over 245 casualties, was subsequently able to hold their sector of the line. For his actions Pope was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. The award was announced in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 8 June 1917. The full citation for his VC reads as follows:

He is buried at Moeuvres Communal Cemetery Extension in France, while his Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.

==Legacy==
The Charles Pope ward at the former Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood is named in his honour.

<text>General Sir Hugh Rowlands (6 May 1828 – 1 August 1909) was a Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross for courageous action that led to the rescue of Colonel William O&#x27;Grady Haly during the Crimean War.

==Early life==
Hugh Rowlands was born in the village of Plastirion, Llanrug. He was the second son of miner and Welsh landowner John Rowlands, heir to the Plastirion estate, and his wife Elizabeth (née Hartwell). His family claimed descent from Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, Prince of Powys, and Dafydd ap Llywelyn, Prince of Gwynedd and had resided in the area for almost 200 years. He was educated at Beaumaris Grammar School and Mr John Taylor&#x27;s Cramming Academy, Woolwich.

==Career==
Rowlands entered the military at the age of 21, purchasing a commission as an Ensign in the 41st (Welch) Regiment of Foot, British Army. Rowlands served in Ireland, Malta and the Ionian Islands and was promoted to captain in the 41st in September 1954, during the Crimean War. He first saw action at the battle of the Alma in the same month and was present at Little Inkerman the following month.

On 5 November 1854 in the Crimea at Inkerman, Captain Rowlands and Private John McDermond rescued Colonel William O&#x27;Grady Haly of the 47th Regiment who had been wounded and surrounded by Russian soldiers. He also acted with great gallantry in holding the ground occupied by his advanced picquet against the enemy at the commencement of the Battle of Inkerman. For this action he became the first Welshman to be awarded the Victoria Cross.

He further distinguished himself during the siege of Sevastopol and was nominated for a Victoria Cross in recognition of his action during the second assault on the Redan in September 1855.

After service in the West Indies and India he was a Special Service officer in South Africa in 1878 and 1879. He was appointed Commandant of the Transvaal in 1878 and led an unsuccessful assault on the Pedi stronghold of Chief Sekukuni. He served as a brigadier-general during the later stages of the Zulu War.

His latter years of service were spent in India where he commanded the Bangalore Division of the Madras Army and, on two occasions, took temporary command of the Madras Army. Returning to Britain he was appointed Lieutenant of the Tower of London in 1893 and Commander-in-Chief, Scotland in 1894 before retiring in 1896.

In October 1897 he was appointed colonel of the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment, which he retained until his death at Plastirion on 1 August 1909.

==Further information==
He later achieved the rank of General. He was born and died in Llanrug. His VC is on display at the Welch Regiment Museum in Cardiff Castle in Wales. He served as a deputy lieutenant of Caernarfonshire and was a justice of the peace in Caernarfonshire and in the Transvaal. His only son, Major Hugh Barrow Rowlands, Suffolk Regiment and King&#x27;s African Rifles, died of wounds in Somaliland in 1903.

<doc id="1221743" wikidata="Q1774784" url="?curid=1221743" title="Clitoromegaly">
<text>Clitoromegaly (or macroclitoris) is an abnormal enlargement of the clitoris that is mostly congenital; it is otherwise acquired through deliberately induced clitoral enlargement e.g. body modification by use of anabolic steroids, including testosterone. It can happen as part of a gender transition. It is clinically distinguishable from normal enlargement of the clitoris seen during sexual arousal.

==Presentation==
Degree of genital ambiguity is commonly measured by the Prader classification, which ranges, in ascending order of masculinisation, from 1: &quot;female external genitalia with clitoromegaly&quot; through 5: &quot;pseudo-phallus looking like normal male external genitalia&quot;.

==Causes==
Clitoromegaly is a rare condition and can be either present by birth or acquired later in life.
If present at birth, congenital adrenal hyperplasia can be one of the causes, since in this condition the adrenal gland of the female fetus produces additional androgens and the newborn baby has ambiguous genitalia which are not clearly male or female. In pregnant women who received norethisterone during pregnancy, masculinization of the fetus occurs, resulting in hypertrophy of the clitoris; however, this is rarely seen nowadays due to use of safer progestogens. It can also be caused by the autosomal recessive congenital disorder known as Fraser syndrome.

In acquired clitoromegaly, the main cause is endocrine hormonal imbalance affecting the adult person, including polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and hyperthecosis. Acquired clitoromegaly may also be caused by pathologies affecting the ovaries and other endocrine glands. These pathologies may include virulent (such as arrhenoblastoma) and neurofibromatosic tumors. Another cause is clitoral cysts. Sometimes there may be no obvious clinical or hormonal reason.

Female bodybuilders and athletes who use androgens, primarily to enhance muscular growth, strength and appearance, may also experience clearly evident enlargement of the clitoris and increases in libido. Women who use testosterone for therapeutic reasons (treating low libido, averting osteoporosis, as part of an anti-depressant regimen, etc.) may experience some enlargement of the clitoris, although the dosages warranted for these conditions are much lower.
==Anatomy==
In &quot;Atlas of Human Sex Anatomy&quot; (1949) by Robert Latou Dickinson, the &quot;typical&quot; clitoris is defined as having a crosswise measurement of 3 to 4 mm (0.12 - 0.16 inches) and a lengthwise measurement of 4 to 5 mm (0.16 - 0.20 inches). On the other hand, in obstetrics and gynecology medical literature, a frequent definition of clitoromegaly is when there is a clitoral index (product of lengthwise and crosswise measurements) of greater than 35 mm2 (0.05 inches2), which is almost twice the size given above for an &quot;average&quot; sized clitoris.
==Human rights concerns==
Early surgical reduction of clitoromegaly via full or partial clitoridectomy is controversial, as many that have undergone such treatment have spoken of their loss of physical sensation, and loss of autonomy. In recent years, human rights institutions have criticized early surgical management of such characteristics.

In 2013, it was disclosed in a medical journal that four unnamed elite female athletes from developing countries were required to receive gonadectomies and partial clitoridectomies if they wanted to continue competing after testosterone testing revealed that they had 5α-Reductase 2 deficiency. In April 2016, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on health, Dainius Pūras, condemned this treatment as a form of female genital mutilation &quot;in the absence of symptoms or health issues warranting those procedures.&quot;

<text>Benson John Lossing (February 12, 1813 — June 3, 1891) was an American historian, known best for his illustrated books on the American Revolution and American Civil War and features in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. He was a charter trustee of Vassar College.

== Early life ==
Lossing was born February 12, 1813, in Beekman, New York. His father John was descended of old Dutch stock, originally surnamed Lassing or Lassingh, who had been among the earliest settlers of the Hudson Valley. His mother, Miriam Dorland Lossing was a Quaker. His formal education was curtailed when he was orphaned in 1824. Soon thereafter, he moved to Poughkeepsie to serve as apprentice to Adam Henderson, clock and watchmaker and silversmith. During his apprenticeship he read a number of history books, and over a period of several years pursued an independent study. He became interested in history after reading Edward Gibbon&#x27;s &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, John Marshall&#x27;s &quot;The Life of George Washington&quot;, and the Bible. By 1833, Lossing and Henderson had formed a partnership.

== Career ==

In 1835, Lossing became part owner and editor of the Poughkeepsie &quot;Telegraph&quot;. Out of that publication grew a semi-monthly literary paper, the &quot;Poughkeepsie Casket&quot;. Lossing began to learn the art of wood engraving from J. A. Adams, illustrator for the paper.

In 1838, Lossing moved to New York City seeking greater opportunity as a journalist and illustrator. He edited and illustrated J.S. Rothchild&#x27;s weekly &quot;Family Magazine&quot; from 1839 to 1841 and launched his literary career with the publication of his &quot;Outline of the History of Fine Arts&quot;. In 1846, he joined William Barritt in a wood engraving business that became one of the largest of such firms in New York. His illustrations appeared in the New-York &quot;Mirror&quot; and several other periodicals. During this time, Lossing sat for a portrait by Thomas Seir Cummings (1804–1894), now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City.

Around 1848, Lossing conceived the idea of writing a narrative sketchbook on the American Revolution. The first installment was published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s New Monthly Magazine&quot; in 1850; the completed &quot;Pictorial Field-Book of the Revolution&quot; was published in 1853. To gather material for the work, Lossing traveled some 8,000 miles throughout the United States and Canada. As with his subsequent books, his pen and ink drawings served as the primary illustrations when turned into wood cuts. The book won him critical acclaim and general reputation. During and after the Civil War, Lossing toured the United States and the once Confederacy. On the basis of that research, he published a three-volume pictorial field book/history of the war, which is also presumed to have been Mathew Brady&#x27;s first collaboration in the use of his Civil War photographs as book illustrations. In 1860 and 1861, the London Art Journal featured a series of Lossing&#x27;s articles describing the history and scenery of the Hudson Valley; the illustrated articles were published in 1866 under the title &quot;The Hudson: From the Wilderness to the Sea&quot;. Lossing was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1872. He was awarded an LL.D. by the University of Michigan in 1873, adding to lesser degrees previously awarded him by Hamilton College and Columbia University. He also worked with engraver and book publisher George Edward Perine, most notably on his &quot;History of New York City&quot; (1884).

=== Historian ===
Lossing&#x27;s significance as a historian derives from his diligence in seeking out primary records, his interviews with participants of events and intimates of his biographical subjects, and his care to weigh and contrast details of his various sources. Although such efforts are today a standard among historians, in Lossing&#x27;s time they were not. Historiography was not yet a discipline. Washington Irving, with whom he corresponded, wrote, &quot;I have been gratified at finding how scrupulously attentive you have been to accuracy to facts, which is so essential in writings of an historical nature.&quot; This made him an essential secondary source for contemporary and succeeding historians, such as Theodore Roosevelt in his &quot;The Naval War of 1812&quot;.

== Personal life ==
On June 18, 1833, Lossing married his first wife, Alice Barrit, who died in 1855. On November 18, 1856, Lossing married his second wife, Helen Sweet. In 1868, the Lossings moved to a manor in Dover, New York, that Helen had inherited from her family; they called this The Ridge, but by later custom it has come to be known as Lossing Manor. There Benson had built a fireproof library to house his collection of over five thousand books and documents associated with the American Revolution and the framing of the Constitution. Lossing was actively involved in charitable, civic, literary, and historical societies, most notably serving as a charter trustee of Vassar College in Poughkeepsie. He died at home in Dover Plains, New York, on June 3, 1891. A written reminiscence of the Lossing family and life in 19th century New York was assembled by his son, Thomas Sweet Lossing; edited by his great-nephew, Peter Hannaford, it was published as &quot;My Heart Goes Home&quot; in 1997 (Purple Mountain Press, Fleischmanns, New York).

* &quot;Outline of the History of the Fine Arts&quot; (1840)
* &quot;Seventeen Hundred and Seventy-Six or the War of Independence; A History of the Anglo - Americans from the period of the Union of the Colonies against the French to the inauguration of Washington the First President of the United States of America&quot; (1847; 1852)

<text>Major Michael John O&#x27;Leary VC (29 September 1890 – 2 August 1961) was an Irish soldier and police officer who was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth military personnel. O&#x27;Leary achieved his award for single-handedly charging and destroying two Imperial German Army barricades defended by machine gun positions near the French village of Cuinchy, in a localised operation on the Western Front during World War I.

At the time of his action, O&#x27;Leary was a nine-year veteran of the British Armed Forces and by the time he retired from the British Army in 1921, he had reached the rank of lieutenant. He served in the army again during World War II, although his later service was blighted by periods of ill-health. At his final retirement from the military in 1945, O&#x27;Leary was in command of a prisoner-of-war camp at the rank of Major. 

Before WWI and between the wars, O&#x27;Leary spent many years employed as a police officer in Canada and is sometimes considered to be a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross. 

==Early life==

O&#x27;Leary was born in 1890, one of four children of Daniel and Margaret O&#x27;Leary, who owned a farm at Inchigeela, near Macroom in County Cork, Ireland. Daniel O&#x27;Leary was a fervent Irish nationalist and keen sportsman who participated in competitive weightlifting and football. Aged 16 and unwilling to continue to work on his parents&#x27; land, Michael O&#x27;Leary joined the Royal Navy, serving at the shore establishment HMS &quot;Vivid&quot; at Devonport for several years until rheumatism in his knees forced his departure from the service. Within a few months however, O&#x27;Leary had again tired of the farm and joined the Irish Guards regiment of the British Army.

O&#x27;Leary served three years with the Irish Guards, leaving in August 1913 to join the Royal North-West Mounted Police (RNWMP) in Saskatchewan, Canada. Operating from Regina, Constable O&#x27;Leary was soon commended for his bravery in capturing two criminals following a two-hour gunbattle, for which service he was presented with a gold ring. At the outbreak of the First World War in Europe during August 1914, O&#x27;Leary was given permission to leave the RNWMP and return to Britain in order to rejoin the army as an active reservist. On 22 October, O&#x27;Leary was mobilised and on 23 November he joined his regiment in France, then fighting with the British Expeditionary Force, entrenched in Flanders.

==First World War service==

During December 1914, O&#x27;Leary saw heavy fighting with the Irish Guards and was Mentioned in Despatches and subsequently promoted to lance corporal on 5 January 1915. Three weeks later, on 30 January, the Irish Guards were ordered to prepare for an attack on German positions near Cuinchy on the La Bassée Canal, a response to a successful German operation in the area five days before. The Germans attacked first however, and on the morning of 1 February seized a stretch of canal embankment on the western end of the 2nd Brigade line from a company of Coldstream Guards. This section, known as the Hollow, was tactically important as it defended a culvert that passed underneath a railway embankment. 4 Company of Irish Guards, originally in reserve, were tasked with joining the Coldstream Guards in retaking the position at 04:00, but the attack was met with heavy machine gun fire and most of the assault party, including all of the Irish Guards officers, were killed or wounded.

To replace these officers, Second Lieutenant Innes of 1 Company was ordered forward to gather the survivors and withdraw, forming up at a barricade on the edge of the Hollow. Innes regrouped the survivors and, following a heavy bombardment from supporting artillery and with his own company providing covering fire, assisted the Coldstream Guards in a second attack at 10:15. Weighed down with entrenching equipment, the attacking Coldstream Guardsmen faltered and began to suffer heavy casualties. Innes too came under heavy fire from a German barricade to their front equipped with a machine gun.

O&#x27;Leary had been serving as Innes&#x27;s orderly, and had joined him in the operations earlier in the morning and again in the second attack. Charging past the rest of the assault party, O&#x27;Leary closed with the first German barricade at the top of the railway embankment and fired five shots, killing the gun&#x27;s crew. Continuing forward, O&#x27;Leary confronted a second barricade, also armed with a machine gun further on and again mounted the railway embankment, to avoid the marshy ground on either side. The Germans spotted his approach, but could not bring their gun to bear on him before he opened fire, killing three soldiers and capturing two others after he ran out of ammunition. Reportedly, O&#x27;Leary had made his advance on the second barricade &quot;intent upon killing another German to whom he had taken a dislike&quot;.

Having disabled both guns and enabled the recapture of the British position, O&#x27;Leary then returned to his unit with his prisoners, apparently &quot;as cool as if he had been for a walk in the park.&quot; For his actions, O&#x27;Leary received a battlefield promotion to sergeant on 4 February and was recommended for the Victoria Cross, which was gazetted on 16 February:


For conspicuous bravery at Cuinchy on the 1st February, 1915. When forming one of the storming party which advanced against the enemy&#x27;s barricades he rushed to the front and himself killed five Germans who were holding the first barricade, after which he attacked a second barricade, about 60 yards further on, which he captured, after killing three of the enemy and making prisoners of two more.

Lance-Corporal O&#x27;Leary thus practically captured the enemy&#x27;s position by himself and prevented the attacking party from being fired upon. 
The London Gazette, 16 February 1915
===Later war service===

Returning to Britain to receive his medal from King George V at Buckingham Palace on 22 June 1915, O&#x27;Leary was given a grand reception attended by thousands of Londoners in Hyde Park on 10 July. He was also the subject of much patriotic writing, including a poem in the Daily Mail and the short play &quot;O&#x27;Flaherty V.C.&quot; by George Bernard Shaw. Tributes came from numerous prominent figures of the day, including Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who said that &quot;No writer in fiction would dare to fasten such an achievement on any of his characters, but the Irish have always had a reputation of being wonderful fighters, and Lance-Corporal Michael O’Leary is clearly one of them.&quot; and Thomas Scanlan who said: &quot;I heard early this week of the great achievements of the Irish Guards. All Ireland is proud of O’Leary. He fully deserves the high honour that has been conferred upon him. Ireland is grateful to him.&quot; His reception was repeated in Macroom when he visited Ireland, with crowds turning out to applaud him. Daniel O&#x27;Leary was interviewed in a local newspaper regarding his son&#x27;s exploit but was reportedly unimpressed, commenting: &quot;I am surprised he didn&#x27;t do more. I often laid out twenty men myself with a stick coming from Macroom Fair, and it is a bad trial of Mick that he could kill only eight, and he having a rifle and bayonet.&quot; According to one eyewitness account, Daniel caused public embarrassment when he confused his son&#x27;s German opponents for the English.

O&#x27;Leary was further rewarded for his service, being advanced to a commissioned rank as a second lieutenant with the Connaught Rangers, and he was also presented with a Russian decoration, the Cross of St. George (third class). Despite his popularity with the crowds in London and Macroom, he was jeered by Ulster Volunteers at a recruitment drive in Ballaghaderreen during the autumn of 1915. This treatment caused such a scandal that it was raised in the Houses of Parliament in December.

In 1916, O&#x27;Leary travelled to Salonika with the 5th battalion of the Connaught Rangers to serve in the Balkans campaign, remaining in theatre until the end of the war, following which he was stationed in Dover with the 2nd battalion until demobilised in 1921. During his service in the Balkans, O&#x27;Leary contracted malaria, which was to have severe negative effects on his health for the rest of his life.

O&#x27;Leary was in the same regiment as the British actor Stanley Holloway and they served together in France. After the war ended, they remained close friends and Holloway often stayed in The May Fair Hotel where O&#x27;Leary worked as a concierge.

==Later life==

Leaving his wife Greta and their two children in Britain, O&#x27;Leary returned to Canada in March 1921 with the purported intention of rejoining the RNWMP, newly renamed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. For unknown reasons, this plan came to nothing and after some months giving lectures on his war service and working in a publishing house, O&#x27;Leary joined the Ontario Provincial Police, charged with enforcing the prohibition laws. In 1924, with his family recently arrived from England, O&#x27;Leary left the Ontario police force and became a police sergeant with the Michigan Central Railway in Bridgeburg, Ontario, receiving £33 a month.

In 1925, O&#x27;Leary was the subject of several scandals, being arrested for smuggling illegal immigrants and later for irregularities in his investigations. Although he was acquitted both times, he spent a week in prison following the second arrest and lost his job with the railway. Several months later, the municipal authorities in Hamilton, Ontario loaned him £70 to pay for him and his family to return to Ireland. Although his family sailed on the SS &quot;Leticia&quot;, O&#x27;Leary remained in Ontario, working with the attorney general&#x27;s office.

With his health in serious decline, the British Legion arranged for O&#x27;Leary to return to Britain and work in their poppy factory. By 1932, O&#x27;Leary was living in Southborne Avenue in Colindale, had regained his health and found employment as a commissionaire at The May Fair Hotel in London, at which he was involved in charitable events for wounded servicemen. With the mobilisation of the British Army in 1939, O&#x27;Leary returned to military service as a captain in the Middlesex Regiment. O&#x27;Leary was sent to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force but had returned to Britain before the Battle of France due to a recurrence of his malaria.

No longer fit for full active service, O&#x27;Leary was transferred to the Pioneer Corps and took command of a prisoner-of-war camp in Southern England. In 1945, he was discharged from the military as unfit for duty on medical grounds at the rank of major and found work as a building contractor in London, in which career he remained until his retirement in 1954. He died in London in 1961.

Two of O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s sons had also served in the military during the war, with both receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross for their actions. As a Victoria Cross recipient, O&#x27;Leary joined the VE day parade in 1946, but at the 1956 Centenary VC review his place was taken by an imposter travelling in a bath chair. With his health again declining, O&#x27;Leary moved to Limesdale Gardens in Edgware shortly before his death in 1961 at the Whittington Hospital in Islington.

O&#x27;Leary was buried at Mill Hill Cemetery following a funeral service at the Roman Catholic Annunciation Church in Burnt Oak which was attended by an honour guard from the Irish Guards and six of his children. His medals were later presented to the Irish Guards, and are on display at the Regimental Headquarters. He is also remembered in his birthplace, the &quot;macroom-online&quot; website listing him as a prominent citizen and states that &quot;while many might consider he was fighting with the wrong army, in the wrong war, he was nevertheless a very brave, resourceful and capable soldieer who deserved the honours bestowed upon him.&quot;

<text>Shelter is the second album by American country rock band Lone Justice, released in November 1986.

== Critical reception ==
Jon Pareles, music critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, gave high praise to McKee&#x27;s singing and the band&#x27;s musicianship, but described the album as something of a disappointment in that &quot;the band&#x27;s songwriting has grown weaker&quot;: whereas the songs of the debut album were filled with &quot;down-to-earth details that make country music hit home&quot;, those of &quot;Shelter&quot; &quot;are much vaguer – they&#x27;re about abstracted emotions rather than recognizable people&quot;.

<text>James McPhie VC (18 December 1894 – 14 October 1918) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
McPhie was 23 years old, and a corporal in the 416th (Edinburgh) Field Company, Royal Engineers, British Army, during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 14 October 1918 at the Canal de la Sensée near Aubencheul-au-Bac, Nord, France, Corporal McPhie was with a party of sappers maintaining a cork float bridge, which when our infantry started to cross it just before dawn began to break away and sink. Corporal McPhie jumped into the water and tried to hold the cork and timbers together but this proved impossible so he swam back and collected the materials for repair. Although it was daylight and the bridge was under close fire he then led the way to the bridge, axe in hand. He was severely wounded and died almost at once. However, the bridge was kept open and 1/2nd Battalion, London Regiment were able to maintain their bridgehead on the opposite bank until relieved.

His grave is at Naves, about 6 km east of Cambrai.

He was commemorated on the war memorial doorway in St George&#x27;s Church, Charlotte Square, Edinburgh, and, when the church was closed and the memorial demolished, on a plaque in St Andrew&#x27;s &amp; St George&#x27;s West Church. He is also commemorated by a bench in West Princes Street Gardens under the Royal Scots Grey statue, there is also a memorial stone at the corner of Brown St. Edinburgh].

==The medal==

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Imperial War Museum, London, England.

<text>Lewis McGee, VC (13 May 1888 – 12 October 1917) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. As a sergeant in the Australian Imperial Force, McGee was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions in the Battle of Broodseinde—part of the Passchendaele offensive—on 4 October 1917. As his platoon came under heavy machine gun fire from a German pillbox, McGee rushed alone across open ground towards the emplacement. Armed solely with a revolver, he shot the gunners and captured the garrison. He then organised a bombing party, and led the group in the seizure of a second machine gun post.

Born in Tasmania, McGee gained employment as an engine driver with the Tasmanian Department of Railways. In March 1916, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force for service in the First World War. He was posted to the 40th Battalion, and completed training in Tasmania and the United Kingdom, where he was promoted to lance corporal. Transferring to the Western Front in November 1916, McGee was rapidly promoted to corporal then sergeant, and took part in the Battle of Messines. He was killed in action on 12 October 1917 during the First Battle of Passchendaele, eight days after his Victoria Cross exploit.

==Early life==
McGee was born in Campbell Town, Tasmania, on 13 May 1888, the youngest of eleven children to John McGee, a labourer and farmer, and his wife Mary (née Green). Three of McGee&#x27;s sisters had died in infancy prior to his birth, and—when Lewis was aged only seven—his mother succumbed to pleurisy. Following his wife&#x27;s death, John relocated his remaining family to a new farming property near Avoca. Here, Lewis gained employment as an engine driver with the Tasmanian Department of Railways. He also achieved a reputation as a &quot;powerful athlete&quot;, particularly as a cyclist with the Avoca Cycling Club. On 15 November 1914, McGee married Eileen Rose Bailey; the couple had daughter called Nada the following year.

==First World War==
On 1 March 1916, McGee enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force for service during the First World War. Allotted to the 40th Battalion as a private, he was initially posted for training at Claremont military camp with his unit for a period of three months. He was advanced to lance corporal on 22 May. On finalising its primary training, the 40th Battalion embarked for the United Kingdom on 1 July, with McGee aboard HMAT &quot;Berrima&quot;. Arriving seven weeks later, the battalion was dispatched to Salisbury Plain to complete an additional period of training in preparation of its deployment to the Western Front.

McGee proceeded to France, and the Western Front, with his battalion on 23 November 1916, arriving the next day. The unit was ultimately posted to Armentières, where McGee was raised to corporal on 4 December. Five days after his promotion, the 40th Battalion was moved into the frontline, occupying a set of trenches just south of Lys. Over subsequent engagements, McGee gained a reputation as a &quot;natural soldier&quot;, which consequently led to his promotion to sergeant on 12 January 1917. The 40th Battalion undertook various small-scale operations and raids throughout this period until June, when it fought in the Battle of Messines. This was followed by a period in reserve behind the lines, before the battalion was shipped to Belgium in preparation for its service in the Passchendaele offensive.

===Victoria Cross===
As part of the third phase of the Passchendaele offensive, the 10th Australian Brigade—of which McGee&#x27;s 40th Battalion was part—was detailed to execute an attack on Broodseinde Ridge. The brigade was allocated four primary objectives to seize during the assault, one for each battalion, with the 40th Battalion to take the final target located on the ridge itself. The advance commenced at the predetermined time of 06:00 on 4 October 1917, under the cover of an artillery barrage. The first three battalions were able to seize their objectives, though the fighting intensified with each stage. As the 40th Battalion set to advance towards the final objective, its progress became hampered by increasingly heavy machine-gun and rifle fire, as well as by barbed wire entanglements and sectors of impassable swamp.

With McGee&#x27;s B Company heading the 40th Battalion&#x27;s advance, the unit was able to progress to a point approximately in front of the crest, where it was confronted by a thick line of barbed wire and another bog, while simultaneously subject to the fire of ten machine guns in trenches and heavily defended pillboxes. The men of B Company struggled to within of the battalion&#x27;s objective, when the severe fire of the German machine guns pinned them down in shellholes.

McGee&#x27;s platoon was suffering heavy casualties from a particular machine gun in front of his position, which was set in a recess atop a concrete pillbox and firing directly at his men. Armed solely with a revolver, McGee dashed alone towards the post across the fire-swept ground. Shooting the gunners, he captured the remaining soldiers in the garrison as prisoners and seized control of the pillbox. On returning to his unit, he reorganised his men and led a bombing party in the capture of a second machine-gun post. McGee&#x27;s actions reignited the 40th Battalion&#x27;s advance, with McGee himself &quot;foremost in the remainder&quot; of the action. By 09:12 on 5 October, the 40th Battalion had seized its objective and held complete control of the Broodseinde Ridge, having captured 300 Germans as prisoners in the process.

As a result of his actions at Broodseinde, McGee was awarded the Victoria Cross, one of two Australians to be so decorated that day. However, he never saw the announcement of the award. On 12 October 1917—eight days after McGee&#x27;s Victoria Cross action—the 40th Battalion returned to the frontline, in an attempt to exploit the success of the previous week. The battlefield was drenched in rain, turning the ground into a quagmire that was additionally dominated by several German pillboxes. McGee—who had been appointed acting company sergeant major of B Company that morning—led his unit into the attack. As the men of the company advanced forward, a machine gun began firing upon them from the front, before a second opened up on their flank. Men ran to take cover in shellholes as the German fire inflicted several casualties. McGee, however, made a rush towards the guns in an apparent effort to silence them. As he ran towards the pillbox, a bullet struck him in the head, killing him instantly. McGee was later buried in Tyne Cot Cemetery; he was one of 248 members of the 40th Battalion killed or wounded during the Battle of Passchendaele. McGee&#x27;s fellow Australian Victoria Cross recipient from Broodseinde, Lance Corporal Walter Peeler, was also severely wounded on this day, receiving a bullet wound to his arm.

==Legacy==
The announcement and accompanying citation for McGee&#x27;s Victoria Cross was promulgated in a supplement to &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 26 November 1917, reading:

McGee&#x27;s wife, Eileen, was presented with her late husband&#x27;s Victoria Cross by the Governor-General of Australia, Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson, at an investiture ceremony in Launceston&#x27;s York Park during October 1918. Additionally, Eileen McGee was later gifted an Iron Cross that her husband had captured from a German officer at Broodseinde, which was enclosed in a letter of condolence written to her by an officer of the 40th Battalion.

Prior to his Victoria Cross action, McGee had been noted in the 40th Battalion for his leadership qualities, and had attained a &quot;famous fighting record&quot;. In addition to his decoration, McGee had been recommended for a commission as a result of his actions at Broodseinde, with an officer in his battalion declaring &quot;had he lived his commission would have been assured&quot;. His original company commander, Major Leslie Payne, noted McGee&#x27;s &quot;sterling qualities as a leader&quot; and stated: &quot;His ability in the carrying out of certain important tasks early in the year was most marked and ... there is in my opinion, and the opinion of many others, no more gallant and capable non-commissioned officer in the battalion.&quot;

McGee is commemorated on a war cenotaph located in Ross, Tasmania, and his name was given to the McGee Soldiers&#x27; Club at Anglesea Army Barracks, Tasmania, which was opened in 1956. During the 150th anniversary celebrations of the town of Avoca in March 1984, the Governor of Tasmania, Sir James Plimsoll, unveiled a memorial plaque on the Returned Serviceman&#x27;s League cenotaph honouring McGee; his widow and their daughter attended the ceremony. McGee&#x27;s Victoria Cross and other medals are held in the collections of the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, Tasmania.

<text>William Henry Grimbaldeston VC (19 September 1889 – 13 August 1959) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Grimbaldeston was 27 years old, and an Acting Company Quartermaster-Sergeant in the 1st Battalion, The King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers, British Army at the Battle of Passchendaele during the First World War when he performed a deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 16 August 1917 at Wijdendrift, Belgium, Company Quartermaster-Sergeant Grimbaldeston noticed that the unit on his left was held up by enemy machine-gun fire from a blockhouse. Arming himself with a rifle and hand grenade he started to crawl towards his objective, and when he had advanced about 100 yards another soldier came forward to give covering support. Although wounded, he pushed on to the blockhouse, threatened the machine-gun teams inside with a hand grenade and forced them to surrender. This action resulted in the capture of 36 prisoners, six machine-guns and one trench mortar.

He was also awarded the French Croix de Guerre.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Regimental Museum of The Kings Own Scottish Borderers, Berwick upon Tweed, Northumberland, England.

<text>Brigadier-General Francis Aylmer Maxwell, (7 September 1871 – 21 September 1917) was a British Army officer in the Second Boer War and First World War. He was also a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and military career==

He was born on 7 September 1871 at &quot;Westhill&quot; in the Grange, Guildford in Surrey, the son of Surgeon Major Thomas Maxwell.

Maxwell was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Sussex Regiment on 7 November 1891 and promoted to lieutenant on 24 November 1893. He transferred to the Indian Staff Corps, Indian Army, and took part in the Chitral Expedition in 1895 with the Queen&#x27;s Own Corps of Guides. In the following years he served on the North-West Frontier of India, and took part in the Tirah Campaign 1897-98 under Sir William Lockhart, to whom he was Aide-de-camp. He was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his services.

==Second Boer War==
Maxwell was attached to Roberts&#x27;s Light Horse during the Second Boer War 1899-1900. By early March 1900 the British had captured the two capital cities of the Boer republics, and the war entered a new phase with a Boer guerrilla campaign to hit the British supply and communication lines. The first engagement of this new form of warfare was at Sanna&#x27;s Post on 31 March where 1,500 Boers under the command of Christiaan De Wet attacked Bloemfontein&#x27;s waterworks about east of the city, and ambushed a heavily escorted convoy, which caused 155 British casualties and the capture of seven guns, 117 wagons, and 428 British troops.

===Victoria Cross===

Maxwell was 28 years old, and a lieutenant attached to Roberts&#x27;s Light Horse during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

On 31 March 1900 at Sanna&#x27;s Post (aka Korn Spruit), South Africa, 

Major Edmund Phipps-Hornby, Sergeant Charles Parker, Gunner Isaac Lodge and Driver Horace Glasock also earned the Victoria Cross in this action.

===Later service in South Africa===
Maxwell was promoted to captain on 10 July 1901. He was appointed Aide-de-camp to Lord Kitchener, Commander-in-Chief of the Forces in South Africa. Following the end of hostilities in early June 1902, he left Cape Town on board the SS &quot;Orotava&quot; together with Lord Kitchener, and arrived at Southampton the next month. He received a brevet promotion to major on 22 August 1902.

==India==
When Kitchener went to India as commander-in-chief in November 1902, Maxwell joined him there as his aide-de-camp.

He was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel in November 1910, while serving as military secretary to the viceroy and governor general of India.

==First World War==
Almost two years into the First World War Maxwell, promoted in November 1915 to brevet lieutenant colonel, was placed in command of the 12th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment from June to October 1916, for which he was promoted once again to temporary lieutenant colonel while serving as the battalion&#x27;s commander. In November he was awarded a Bar to his Distinguished Service Order. For his actions taking Thiepval, he was given command of the 18th King George&#x27;s Own Lancers, Indian Army in October 1916.

As commander of the 12th Middlesex, and later of the 27th Infantry Brigade of the 9th (Scottish) Division, to which he had been appointed to command in October when he was promoted to temporary brigadier general, Maxwell came to be regarded as one of the finest combat commanders serving in the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. He was an aggressive commander who was also both an original thinker and popular with his men.

Despite his rank, Maxwell, made a brevet colonel in June 1917, was frequently at the front line. He was killed in action, shot by a German sniper, during the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge on 21 September 1917. He is buried in Ypres Reservoir Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery. The gravestone inscription states: &quot;An ideal soldier and a very perfect gentleman beloved by all his men.&quot;

His brother, Lieutenant Colonel Eustace Lockhart Maxwell of the 11th King Edward&#x27;s Own Lancers (Probyn&#x27;s Horse), was killed on 20 July 1916 during the Battle of the Somme, whilst commanding the &#x27;bantams&#x27; of 23rd Manchester Regiment. He is commemorated on the Neuve-Chapelle Indian Memorial.

General Maxwell is commemorated with a plaque in St. Giles Cathedral on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh, Scotland. Maxwell&#x27;s medals are now held in the Imperial War Museum as part of the &quot;Lord Ashcroft collection&quot; having been bought at auction for £78,000. His wife, Charlotte Maxwell, published a volume of his edited letters in 1921.

<doc id="1221781" wikidata="Q11857427" url="?curid=1221781" title="Vitality curve">
<text>A vitality curve is a performance management practice that calls for individuals to be ranked or rated against their coworkers. It is also called stack ranking, forced ranking, and rank and yank. Pioneered by GE&#x27;s Jack Welch in the 1980s, it has remained controversial. Numerous companies practice it, but mostly covertly to avoid direct criticism.

== Overview ==
The vitality model of former General Electric chairman and CEO Jack Welch has been described as a &quot;20-70-10&quot; system. The &quot;top 20&quot; percent of the workforce is most productive, and 70% (the &quot;vital 70&quot;) work adequately. The other 10% (&quot;bottom 10&quot;) are nonproducers and should be fired.

The often cited &quot;80-20 rule&quot;, also known as the &quot;Pareto principle&quot; or the &quot;Law of the Vital Few&quot;, whereby 80% of crimes are committed by 20% of criminals, or 80% of useful research results are produced by 20% of the academics, is an example of such rankings observable in social behavior. In some cases such &quot;80-20&quot; tendencies do emerge, and a Pareto distribution curve is a fuller representation.

=== Ratings ===
In his 2001 book &quot;Jack: Straight from the Gut&quot;, Welch says that he asked &quot;each of the GE&#x27;s businesses to rank all of their top executives&quot;. Specifically, top executives were divided into &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot; players. Welch admitted that the judgments were &quot;not always precise&quot;.

According to Welch, &quot;A&quot; players had the following characteristics:

* Filled with passion
* Committed to &quot;making things happen&quot;
* Open to ideas from anywhere
* Blessed with much &quot;runway&quot; ahead of them
* Possess charisma, the ability to energize themselves and others
* Can make business productive and enjoyable at the same time
* Exhibit the &quot;four Es&quot; of leadership:
** Very high Energy levels
** Can Energize others around common goals
** The &quot;Edge&quot; to make difficult decisions
** The ability to consistently Execute

The vital &quot;B&quot; players may not be visionary or the most driven, but are &quot;vital&quot; because they make up the majority of the group. On the other hand, the &quot;C&quot; players are nonproducers. They are likely to &quot;enervate&quot; rather than &quot;energize&quot;, according to Serge Hovnanian&#x27;s model. Procrastination is a common trait of &quot;C&quot; players, as well as failure to deliver on promises.

===Consequences===
Welch advises firing &quot;C&quot; players, while encouraging &quot;A&quot; players with rewards such as promotions, bonuses, and stock options. However, if such rewards become a meaningful portion of “A” player&#x27;s overall compensation, it can lead to perverse incentives, especially if the rewards of being an “A” player are predictable and recurring, such as a normal part of the annual review process. When broad-based stock compensation is the norm, avoiding perverse incentives can be difficult.

==Prevalence==

It&#x27;s difficult to gauge how prevalent forced ranking is, particularly because companies have started using more anodyne terms like &quot;talent assessment system&quot; or &quot;performance procedure&quot;. That said, research and anecdotal evidence seems to point to a downward trend. A 2006 article in &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; estimated that one-third of U.S. companies &quot;evaluated employees based on systems that pit them against their colleagues&quot;. According to the Institute for Corporate Productivity, 42% of companies surveyed reported using a forced ranking in 2009. That, however, decreased to 14% in 2011.

In 2013, one human resources consultant estimated that 30% of Fortune 500 companies still used some sort of ranking system but often under a different name. A 2013 survey by WorldatWork, however, showed that it was used by about 12% of U.S. companies, whereas another by CEB in the same year found that it was used by 29% of companies.

According to a 2015 CEB study, 6% of Fortune 500 companies had ditched the forced ranking system, though it did not provide an estimate of how many companies still practiced it.

== Criticism ==

=== Morale ===

Stack ranking pits employees against their coworkers in what has been described as a Darwinian &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, leading employees to &quot;feel unmotivated and disengaged&quot; as well as creating &quot;unnecessary internal competition that can be destructive to synergy, creativity and innovation and pull focus from marketplace completion&quot;. Furthermore, people who belong to an exceptionally talented team may suffer attrition if they know a certain number of their team will be given lower grades than if they were part of a less talented team.

=== Cost ===
According to CEB, an average manager spends more than 200 hours a year on activities related to performance reviews, including training and filling out and delivering evaluations. Adding in the cost of the performance-management technology itself, CEB estimated that a company of about 10,000 employees spends roughly $35 million a year on reviews. Additionally, jettisoned employees provide the competition with fresh talent.

=== Discrimination ===

Forced ranking systems may lead to biased decision-making and discrimination. Employees at Microsoft, Ford, and Conoco have filed lawsuits against their employers, saying that forced ranking systems are inherently unfair &quot;because they favor some groups of employees over others: white males over blacks and women, younger managers over older ones and foreign citizens over Americans&quot;. For example, around 2001, Ford used a forced ranking system with three grades, A, B, and C, with quotas preset to 10%, 80%, and 10%. After a class action lawsuit, which it settled for $10.5 million, it stopped using the system.

=== Lack of empirical evidence ===
Rob Enderle has argued that &quot;No sane person could sustain the argument for forced ranking once it&#x27;s applied to products instead of people. Apply it to automobiles and make 20 percent or even 10 percent of any run unsatisfactory by policy, regardless of actual quality, and you&#x27;d immediately see that you were institutionalizing bad quality. With people, though, folks remain blind to the fact that forced ranking is walking example of confirmation bias.&quot;

Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert I. Sutton have criticized the practice on the grounds that there is limited empirical evidence of its overall usefulness to organizations.

=== Unrealistic assumptions ===
The model assumes that the players do not change their rating. In practice even the fear of being selected as a &quot;C&quot; player may result in an employee working harder, reducing the number of &quot;C&quot; players.

Some critics believe that the 20-70-10 model fails to reflect actual human behavior. Among randomly selected people assigned to a task, such a model may be accurate. They contend, however, that at each iteration, the average quality of employees will increase, making for more &quot;A&quot; players and fewer &quot;C&quot; players. Eventually, the &quot;C&quot; players comprise less than 10% of the workforce.

The style may make it more difficult for employees to cross rate from one division to another. For example, a &quot;C&quot; employee in a company&#x27;s Customer Service division would be at a disadvantage applying for a job in Marketing, even though they may have talents consistent with an &quot;A&quot; rating in the other division.

=== Management philosophy ===
This is a competitive model of organization. The criticisms of both the morality and actual effectiveness of such a method of social cohesion apply. Challenges to the model include: &quot;C&quot; player selection methods; the effect of office politics and lowered morale on productivity, communication, interoffice relations; and cheating. Rank-based performance evaluations (in education and employment) are said to foster cut-throat and unethical behavior. University of Virginia business professor Bruner wrote: &quot;As Enron internally realized it was entering troubled times, rank-and-yank turned into a more political and crony-based system&quot;. Forced ranking systems are said to undermine employee morale by creating a zero-sum game that discourages cooperation and teamwork. They also tend to change norms of reciprocity that characterise the interactions among employees. In terms of Adam Grant&#x27;s notion of &quot;giver&quot;, &quot;taker&quot;, and &quot;matcher cultures&quot;, forced ranking systems are found to make it less likely for a &quot;giver culture&quot; to be present among employees, as individuals shift to &quot;matcher&quot; or &quot;taker&quot; behaviour.

Rank and yank contrasts with the management philosophies of W. Edwards Deming, whose broad influence in Japan has been credited with Japan&#x27;s world leadership in many industries, particularly the automotive industry. &quot;Evaluation by performance, merit rating, or annual review of performance&quot; is listed among Deming&#x27;s Seven Deadly Diseases. It may be said that rank-and-yank puts success or failure of the organization on the shoulders of the individual worker. Deming stresses the need to understand organizational performance as fundamentally a function of the corporate systems and processes created by management in which workers find themselves embedded. He sees so-called merit-based evaluation as misguided and destructive.

=== Specific examples ===
According to Qualtrics CEO Ryan Smith, stack-ranking and similar systems are suitable for ranking sales personnel among whom the management wishes to foster a spirit of competition, but less suitable for engineers, among whom management may want to encourage closer collaboration.

According to a 2006 MIT study cited by &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot;, forced ranking can be particularly detrimental for a company undergoing layoffs: “As the company shrinks, the rigid distribution of the bell curve forces managers to label a high performer as a mediocre. A high performer, unmotivated by such artificial demotion, behaves like a mediocre.”

MIT Research Fellow Michael Schrage has argued that the forced ranking policy has perverse effects even in organizations that are successful: &quot;Organizations intent on rigorous self-improvement and its measurement inevitably confront an evaluation paradox: The more successful they are in developing excellent employees, the more trivial and inconsequential the reasons become for rewarding one over the other. Perversely, truly effective objective employee-evaluation criteria ultimately lead to personnel decisions that are fundamentally rooted in arbitrary and subjective criteria. [...] The coup de grace occurs when the top employees are all told that
they must collaborate better with one another even as they compete in this rigged game of managerial musical chairs.&quot;

==Companies using the system==
===IBM===
IBM has used a vitality curve program called Personal Business Commitments (PBC) since before 2006. For IBM, the main thrust of the strategy is to reduce workforce and shift personnel to lower-cost geographies by using a pseudo-objective rationale. The PBC process starts with a corporate distribution target, which is applied at the lowest levels of the hierarchy and then iteratively applied through the higher levels. The process involves meetings where managers compete for a limited number of favorable rankings for their employees. An employee&#x27;s rating is thus dependent not only on the manager&#x27;s opinion but also on the ability of the manager at &quot;selling&quot; and how much influence the 1st line manager has on the second-line manager (for example, if the first-line manager is rated highly, that manager&#x27;s employees are more likely to be ranked highly).

=== AIG ===
Under the leadership of Bob Benmosche, American International Group (AIG) implemented a five-point system in 2010, with a split of 10%/20%/50%/10%/10%. The top 10% are deemed &quot;1s&quot; and receive the largest bonuses; the next 20% are &quot;2s&quot; and receive somewhat smaller bonuses; the bulk consists of &quot;3s&quot;, which get the smallest bonuses. The &quot;4s&quot; receive no bonuses, and the &quot;5s&quot; are fired unless they improve. According to Jeffrey Hurd, AIG&#x27;s senior vice president of human resources and communications, &quot;Prior to this, everyone was above-average...You never really knew where you stood.&quot;

===Yahoo===
Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer instituted its &quot;QPR&quot; (quarterly performance review) system in 2012, using the rankings: Greatly Exceeds (10%) Exceeds (25%), Achieves (the largest pool at 50%), Occasionally Misses (10%) and Misses (5%).

In a new version for the fourth quarter 2013, sources said the percentages are changing, but only at the discretion of leadership within the units: Greatly Exceeds (10%), Exceeds (35%), Achieves (50%), Occasionally Misses (5%) and Misses (0%). This new evaluation system resulted in 600 layoffs in the fourth quarter of 2013.

===Amazon===
Excerpt from &quot;The New York Times&quot;

Amazon holds a yearly Organization Level Review, where managers debate subordinates&#x27; rankings, assigning and reassigning names to boxes in a matrix projected on the wall. In recent years, other large companies, including Microsoft, General Electric and Accenture Consulting, have dropped the practice — often called stack ranking, or &quot;rank and yank&quot; — in part because it can force managers to get rid of valuable talent just to meet quotas.

The review meeting starts with a discussion of the lower-level employees, whose performance is debated in front of higher-level managers. As the hours pass, successive rounds of managers leave the room, knowing that those who remain will determine their fates.

Preparing is like getting ready for a court case, many supervisors say: To avoid losing good members of their teams — which could spell doom — they must come armed with paper trails to defend the wrongfully accused and incriminate members of competing groups. Or they adopt a strategy of choosing sacrificial lambs to protect more essential players. &quot;You learn how to diplomatically throw people under the bus&quot;, said a marketer who spent six years in the retail division. &quot;It&#x27;s a horrible feeling.&quot;

Many women at Amazon attribute its gender gap — unlike Facebook, Google, or Walmart, it does not currently have a single woman on its top leadership team — to its competition-and-elimination system. 

The employees who stream from the Amazon exits are highly desirable because of their work ethic, local recruiters say. In recent years, companies like Facebook have opened large Seattle offices, and they benefit from the Amazon outflow.

Recruiters, though, also say that other businesses are sometimes cautious about bringing in Amazon workers, because they have been trained to be so combative. The derisive local nickname for Amazon employees is &quot;Amholes&quot; — pugnacious and work-obsessed.

===Microsoft===
Since the 2000s, Microsoft used a stack ranking system similar to the vitality curve. Many Microsoft executives noted that company &quot;superstars did everything they could to avoid working alongside other top-notch developers, out of fear that they would be hurt in the rankings&quot;, and that ranking stifled innovation, as employees were more concerned about making sure that their peers or rival projects failed than of proposing new inventions, turning the company into a &quot;collection of non-cooperating fiefdoms, unable to catch on to many technology trends&quot;. The stack ranking system was relatively secretive for a long time at Microsoft; non-manager employees were supposed to pretend they did not know about it.

Microsoft was involved in lawsuits regarding its forced ranking system as early as 2001. Detractors argued that the use of the system in small groups was inherently unfair and favored the employees who socialized more heavily over actual technical merit. At the time, Microsoft officially claimed through Deborah Willingham, Microsoft&#x27;s senior vice president for human resources, that it had no such &quot;stack rank&quot; system.

In 2006, Microsoft began to use a vitality curve, despite intense internal criticism. Posts on &quot;the curve&quot; by Who da&#x27;Punk, an anonymous blogger internal to the company, on his blog Mini-Microsoft became a hot topic of commentary by other presumed employees.

According to one source, by 1996 Microsoft had already adopted a stack ranking system which led managers to deliberately retain subpar staff in order to keep their higher performers:

Microsoft managers are generally supposed to allocate reviews according to the following ratios: 25 percent get 3.0 or lower; 40 percent get 3.5; and 35 percent get 4.0 or better. Employees with too many successive 3.0 reviews are given six months to find another position in the company or face termination. A manager who is top-heavy with valuable or talented people doesn&#x27;t want to be forced to give them 3.0 reviews. So these managers kept a few extra slabs of deadwood around so as to save the higher reviews for the employees they want to keep.
In a memo to all Microsoft employees dated April 21, 2011, chief executive Steve Ballmer announced the company would make the vitality curve model of performance evaluation explicit: &quot;We are making this change so all employees see a clear, simple, and predictable link between their performance, their rating, and their compensation&quot;. The new model had 5 buckets, each of a predefined size (20%, 20%, 40%, 13%, and 7%), which management used to rank their reports. All compensation adjustments were predefined based on the bucket, and employees in the bottom bucket were ineligible to change positions since they would have the understanding that they might soon be yanked.

Following Ballmer&#x27;s announced departure, on November 12, 2013, Microsoft&#x27;s HR chief Lisa Brummel announced they were abandoning the practice.

The practice at Microsoft became a topic of significant media attention following Kurt Eichenwald&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article called &quot;Microsoft’s Lost Decade&quot;. According to a subsequent article by Nick Wingfield in &quot;The New York Times&quot; Bits blog, &quot;While that story overstated the harmful effects of stack ranking in the view of many Microsoft employees, it clearly represented the views of many others...The negative publicity around Microsoft&#x27;s old employee review system reverberated loudly around the company, according to people who work there...The executive who spoke [to Wingfield] on condition of anonymity recalled Ms. Brummel saying: &quot;I hope I never have to read another article about our review system ever again.&quot;

===General Electric===
General Electric, by far, was the most famous company to use the form of corporate management. However, since Welch&#x27;s departure from the company, less emphasis has been placed on eliminating the bottom 10%, with more emphasis placed on team-building. During Welch&#x27;s leadership, the system was dubbed &quot;rank and yank&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2015 that the company dropped the evaluation method.

===Other companies===
Companies that previously used the system but have abandoned it include Ford (2001), Adobe Systems (2012), Medtronic, Kelly Services, New York Life, Juniper Networks, Accenture (2016), Goldman Sachs (2016) and Gap Inc.

<doc id="1221784" wikidata="Q1509889" url="?curid=1221784" title="Gerald Graham">
<text>Lieutenant General Sir Gerald Graham, (27 June 1831 – 17 December 1899) was a senior British Army commander in the late 19th century and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

As an officer of the Royal Engineers, he served in the Crimean War, China, Canada, and Africa — including as a Brigadier General in the Anglo-Egyptian War and as commander of the Suakin Expedition against Mahdist Sudan in 1884–85.

In February 1884, Graham accompanied his close friend and colleague Charles George Gordon up the Nile to Gordon&#x27;s disembarkation at Korosko, making Graham one of the last Englishmen to see Gordon alive before he set out across the Nubian Desert on his fateful mission to Khartoum. In 1887 Graham commemorated Gordon, reflecting on his life, character, and the context of the Mahdist War, in a publication entitled “Last Words with Gordon”.

==Early life==
Graham was born in Acton, Middlesex to Frances (née Oakley), of Yorkshire, and Robert Hay Graham, of north Cumberland, a medical doctor and descendent of Clan Graham.

After studying at Wimbledon and Dresden he was admitted (1847) to the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich where he passed third out of his batch and received a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 19 June 1850. He subsequently completed his military training in the School of Military Engineering at Chatham.

As a young man, he was noted for his strong and imposing stature, reaching a height of – a quality ultimately remarked upon throughout his career – as well as a reserved but kind disposition and a fondness for boating on the Medway.

==Crimea &amp; Victoria Cross==
Graham was ordered to the 11th Company of Royal Sappers and Miners at Woolwich and shipped to Gallipoli in April 1854 to engage in the building of defensive works at the Gulf of Saros. He then served in the Crimea at the battles of Alma, Inkerman, and the Siege of Sebastopol where his actions at the assault of the Redan on June 18, 1854, earned him the award of a Victoria Cross.

The ill-fated attack on the Russian fortifications consisted of three columns (1,600 men each) with 23 year old Lieutenant Graham in command of the ladder party at the head of Number 1 column. Notably, Charles George Gordon was in command of the same column&#x27;s reserves - a former peer of Graham&#x27;s at the Royal Academy and subsequent close friend and colleague through later campaigns in China and the Sudan.

Commencing their offensive after dawn, the Number 1 column became pinned down by heavy Russian fire as it endeavoured to close on the right flank of the Redan across approximately 400 yards of open, level ground. Graham later recalled:

Graham carried Tylden to the rear before returning to the action but after numerous attempts to move forward and suffering severe casualties, the column retired to their advance trench. At this point, Graham and sapper John Perie gallantly scaled the parapet and returned to the field under withering grape and musket fire to retrieve wounded comrades.

Lord West, who succeeded command of Graham&#x27;s column following the death of Sir John Campbell, later wrote to Lieutenant General Betnick, &quot;...Lieutenant Graham of the Engineers, who lead the ladder party, evinced a coolness and readiness to expose himself to any personal risk which does him the greatest credit.&quot;

The citation for Graham&#x27;s VC, published in the London Gazette, noted his &quot;Devoted heroism in sallying out of the trenches on numerous occasions, and bringing in wounded officers and men.&quot; For his actions in the Crimea Graham was awarded the Victoria Cross, twice mentioned in dispatches, made a Knight of the French Legion d&#x27;honneur, received the 5th Class of the Order of the Medjidie, and promoted to Brevet Major.

At the inaugural VC ceremony in Hyde Park, on 26 June 1857, Graham was personally decorated by Queen Victoria, who pierced his chest while pinning the Cross to his coat.

==Later service==

During the Second Anglo-Chinese War he again displayed great courage and skill and, although seriously wounded in the storming of the Taku forts (21 August 1860), subsequently entered Peking with the victors. Following his return to England in 1861, he was for 16 years commanding engineer successively at Brighton, Aldershot, Montreal, Chatham, Manchester, and York. In 1877 he was appointed assistant director of works for barracks at the War Office.

In 1882 he accompanied Sir Garnet Wolseley to Egypt as brigadier general, and his forces had a great share in the victorious campaign against Urabi Pasha. In 1884 he took the field against Osman Digna, whose army he defeated at El-Teb and Tamai. In the meantime he had urged a plan for the assistance of Gordon, which, however, was not accepted.

Graham led a second Suakin Field Force which arrived at the port on 12 March 1885. Its purpose was to suppress Osman Digna&#x27;s forces which were active in the area, and to supervise the construction of the Suakin-Berber Railway. The field force engaged in two actions: at Hashin on 20 March and at Tofrek on 22 March, before the British government changed its policies, shutting down the railway project and leaving the Sudan in May 1885.

In his book &quot;The Battle of Tofrek, fought near Suakin, March 22nd 1885&quot;, written shortly after the battle for the purpose of correcting erroneous statements in both official and press reports of the battle, William Galloway was strongly critical of General Graham&#x27;s planning of the Tofrek expedition on three counts: 
# Compared to the expedition to Hashin on 20 March which Graham commanded himself, which had been protected by four squadrons of British cavalry and a regiment of Bengal cavalry acting as scouts, the Tofrek expedition which he delegated to the command of General McNeill had only one squadron of Lancers plus a company of Mounted Infantry to provide warning of enemy activity;
# Whereas Graham had the protection of a battery of Royal Horse Artillery able to shell the enemy at long range, no artillery was assigned to McNeill&#x27;s force;
# Whereas the ratio of men to transport animals had been over 5:1 in the earlier expedition, it was no more than 2:1 for the later one, resulting in greater difficulties in keeping controlling of the animals.
Galloway was even more critical of Graham for a last-minute change to McNeill&#x27;s marching orders. Instead of following an established track in a southwesterly direction towards Tamai as originally planned, Graham personally instructed McNeill to march westwards into uncharted territory, which turned out to be thickly covered by a jungle of mimosa bushes with long low-lying branches covered in sharp thorns. This caused progress to be both slow and difficult while affording the enemy excellent cover for the surprise attack that they launched later in the day.

Graham was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1896, and a colonel commandant of the Corps of Royal Engineers in 1899. He is buried in East-the Water Cemetery in Bideford in Devon in a grave adjacent to that of George Channer VC.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is currently owned by Graham&#x27;s great great great grandson Oliver Brooks and is displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum in Gillingham, England.

==Works==
He published a number of scientific papers and a contribution to the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot;, entitled &quot;Last Words with Gordon&quot; (1887), and prepared a translation of Goetze&#x27;s &quot;Operations of the German Engineers and Technical Troops during the Franco-German War of 1870–71&quot; (1875).

<text>Major Benjamin Handley Geary VC (29 June 1891 – 26 May 1976) was a British Army recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Geary was educated at Dulwich College Preparatory School and St Edmund&#x27;s School, Canterbury, then went up to Keble College, Oxford, in 1910. After graduating he taught at Forest School in Walthamstow (then in Essex, now absorbed into Greater London) 1913–14. On the outbreak of World War I he was commissioned into the Special Reserve on 15 August 1914 as a second lieutenant in the 4th Battalion, East Surrey Regiment. Soon afterwards he was sent to France and attached to the regular 1st Battalion serving on the Western Front.

==VC==
On 20 and 21 April 1915 the 1st Battalion was in action on Hill 60 near Ypres. Second Lieutenant Geary led his men across exposed open ground swept by fierce enemy fire to join survivors of the Bedfordshire Regiment in a crater at the top of the hill. Geary&#x27;s subsequent actions earned him the VC. The citation reads:
==Later life==
Geary was evacuated to England having been shot in the head and lost the sight in his left eye; his right eye was also seriously impaired. He was promoted to lieutenant, worked on ground duties with the Royal Flying Corps, returned to France (still with the RFC) in 1916 and was appointed acting captain. In January 1918 he rejoined the 1st Battalion East Surrey Regiment in Italy, still as acting captain, and commanded a company although medically he should not have returned to active duty. Later that year he returned to France and was wounded again. He retired from Army in 1919 with the rank of captain.
Geary took Holy Orders in the Church of England, having studied at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, and after other Church posts served as Chaplain to the Forces 1926–27. He then resigned and emigrated to Canada. During World War II he served with the Canadian Army and achieved the rank of Major. After the war he was Sergeant-at-Arms of the Ontario Legislature 1947–71, then retired but was for a time historian for the Legislature. His grave and memorial are at St Mark&#x27;s Church Cemetery, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario.

==The medal==
Geary&#x27;s Victoria Cross and other medals are displayed at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

<text>The Meyers Aircraft Company was a US aircraft manufacturer established by Al Meyers in Tecumseh, Michigan, in 1936 at what is now Meyers–Diver&#x27;s Airport.

== History ==
Originally, the company produced a biplane trainer, the Meyers OTW, but after World War II developed a range of light utility aircraft, culminating in the Meyers 200. In 1965, the company and the rights to two of its aircraft, the 145 and 200 were purchased by the Aero Commander Division of Rockwell-Standard.

=== Post-acquisition ===
In 1977, a company in Denver bought the tooling and rights to the Meyers 200 and attempted to put it back into production. By 1994, the type certificate for the MAC-145 was owned by a company in Fayetteville, North Carolina. By 1996, a company called the New Meyers Aircraft Company had started construction on a new factory in Fort Pierce, Florida. The company planned to build a development of the MAC-145 called the SP20.

<text>George Rodgers VC (January 1829 – 9 March 1870) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Rodgers was about 29 years old, and a private in the 71st Regiment (later The Highland Light Infantry), British Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 16 June 1858 at Marar, Gwalior for which he was awarded the VC:
Rodgers returned to Glasgow and died in a domestic accident. He visited his sister in order to get an alcoholic drink but was refused and told to lie down in her flat. Some time later Rodgers got up and found a bottle of sulphuric acid and thinking it was alcohol, drank it, causing his death. He was buried in a common grave in Glasgow&#x27;s Southern Necropolis.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Museum of The Royal Highland Fusiliers, Glasgow, Scotland.

<text>Lieutenant General Premindra Singh Bhagat, PVSM, VC (14 October 1918 – 23 May 1975) was a general in the Indian Army and an Indian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. The Victoria Cross was conferred on him for his actions in the Sudan Theatre during World War II.

Bhagat was an alumnus of the famous Prince of Wales Royal Indian Military College, Dehradun.

==Early life and education==
Bhagat was born on 13 October 1918 in Gorakhpur, British India to Surendra Singh Bhagat, an executive engineer in the provincial government of the then United Provinces. His mother died in 1927. In 1930, he entered the Royal Indian Military College, a military school in Dehradun, where he was an average student. In June 1937, he entered the Indian Military Academy. As a gentleman cadet, Bhagat captained the academy tennis and squash teams. While noted by his instructors as an intelligent all-round sportsman, he was also described as a careless student. In January 1938, Surendra Singh Bhagat died in a riding accident in Varanasi.

==Military career==
Bhagat applied himself to his studies in his final year and was commissioned in the British Indian Army on 15 July 1939 as a Second lieutenant (2Lt.) in the Royal Bombay Sappers and Miners. He was posted to the 21 Field Company of Engineers at Pune in September, shortly after war began in Europe.

===World War II===
On 23 September 1940, Bhagat&#x27;s company was sent to East Africa, as part of the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade, 5th Indian Division, Sudan Defence Force under the overall command of Lieutenant General William Platt. The 10th Infantry Brigade was commanded by Brigadier William Slim, MC (later Field Marshal the Viscount Slim). On 6 November, Slim launched an attack on the fort of Gallabat, with the assault spearheaded by the 3rd Royal Garhwal Rifles, under Lieutenant-Colonel S.E. Taylor. Gallabat was captured, but an enemy counterattack forced the brigade to withdraw. The Sappers were tasked with obstructing the enemy to prevent them from following too closely. At one stage, two broken-down tanks were filled with explosives and placed on a culvert to collapse it and halt the enemy. The charges were detonated, but one tank failed to explode, and the culvert did not collapse. With the enemy closing in, Bhagat dashed out from under cover and, with bullets flying all around him, detonated the remaining explosives and collapsed the culvert. For his heroism, he was recommended for a Military Cross, but it was downgraded to a mentioned in dispatches. After the brigade was relieved by 9th Indian Infantry Brigade in mid-November, it readied for the Battle of Keren.

On 31 January 1941, a mobile column of 3/12 Royal Frontier Force Rifles, including a detachment of 21 Field Company under Second Lieutenant Bhagat, was sent on a reconnaissance mission towards Metemma. Bhagat&#x27;s Bren carrier passed through a heavily-mined stretch of road and detonated two mines, the second of which destroyed the carrier and killed the driver and a sapper. Bhagat then continued in another carrier and defused mines by hand as the column moved down the road. Under close enemy fire and without food or rest, he worked for four days, clearing a total of 15 minefields over a distance of 55 miles. After having another Bren carrier blown up under him on 2 February, which resulted in punctured eardrums, he was relieved of further duties and evacuated to Khartoum for treatment. He was decorated with the Victoria Cross later that month and presented with the ribbon by General Wavell (later Field Marshal the Earl Wavell), the Commander-in-Chief, India in June at Asmara and formally invested with the decoration by the Governor-General of India, Lord Linlithgow, at Viceroy&#x27;s House in Delhi on 10 November.

===Victoria Cross===
At 22, the Second Lieutenant (King&#x27;s Commissioned Indian Officer) in the Corps of Indian Engineers, Indian Army, attd. Royal Bombay Sappers and Miners during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross:
 
On 24 February 1942 in Pune, Bhagat married Mohini Bhandari (b. 1923), the daughter of a colonel in the Indian Army Medical Corps. He spent the remainder of the war away from the front, first as a successful recruiting officer for the Bombay Sappers and then as the commanding officer of 484 Field Company. In mid-1943, the unit was posted to Chhindwara in the Central Provinces for training in jungle warfare for the war in Burma. In January 1945, Bhagat was nominated to attend a course at Camberley Staff College and became one of the first two Indian officers to attend Staff College in the United Kingdom. At the end of the war in August 1945, Bhagat returned to India and attended a course at the School of Military Engineering at Roorkee. He then returned to England in June 1946 to complete a further engineering course and was promoted to substantive captain on 1 July 1946, returning to India in June 1947. Bhagat was the highest decorated officer in the Indian Army at Indian independence.

==Post-Independence==
After his return to India, Major Bhagat was assigned to the Punjab Boundary Force under Major General Thomas Wynford Rees, trying to maintain law and order in the chaotic region following Indian independence and Partition in August. On 1 September, after the dissolution of the Punjab Boundary Force, Bhagat was promoted to acting lieutenant-colonel and appointed CO of the Royal Engineers, 4th Infantry Division. In July 1948, Bhagat was posted as GSO 1 at the Armed Forces Academy. On 15 February 1949, he was appointed Commandant of the Bombay Sappers at Pune, and he was promoted to substantive major on 28 August 1951. In 1954, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and assigned as the Chief Instructor (Army Wing) at the Defence Services Staff College at Wellington. He was promoted to acting brigadier on 11 March 1957 and assigned command of 165 Infantry Brigade at Ramgarh.

He was posted to Army headquarters on 29 August 1959 as Director of Military Intelligence. During his tenure, Bhagat completed a thorough assessment of the Chinese Army&#x27;s threat to India, but his report was not heeded before the 1962 Sino-Indian War. He was promoted to colonel on 2 February 1959, and to substantive brigadier on 28 August 1961. From June 1961 to May 1962, Bhagat took the National Defence College course and was then posted as Commandant of the Indian Military Academy (IMA). As Commandant of the IMA, he co-authored (with Lieutenant General T. B. Henderson Brooks) the Henderson Brooks-Bhagat Report, an incisive &quot;Operations Review&quot; of the Indian Army during the Sino-Indian War. The report, initially suppressed and still classified top secret, soon led to sweeping changes in the army. On 29 January 1963, Bhagat was appointed Brigadier General Staff (BGS) for an army corps.

===General Officer===
Promoted acting major-general on 14 May 1963, he was appointed Chief of Staff (COS) for Eastern Command. He was appointed GOC of a mountain division on 18 September 1964, and promoted to major-general in 1965. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general op on 19 May 1967, and subsequently took over as the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the Central Command on 4 August 1970. In June 1972, he became the first GOC-in-C of the re-established Northern Command, in Udhampur, Jammu and Kashmir. He was also awarded the Param Vishisht Seva Medal (PVSM).

In January 1973, the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS), Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw was to relinquish office. Although Manekshaw&#x27;s choice of successor was Lieutenant General Bhagat, however, Lt General Bewoor was senior to Bhagat, but Bhagat could still conceivably become army chief when Bewoor was to retire on his 58th birthday. But, the Government extended Bewoor&#x27;s tenure by nine months to give him a full two years on the job. By many that was construed as a deliberate manipulation to deny Bhagat the position of COAS. That decision resulted effectively to end Bhagat&#x27;s army career, as he retired naturally a few months later. Bhagat was a strong General who was also very popular in the army.

==Post-retirement==
In July 1974, he became Chairman of the Damodar Valley Corporation, a major electric utility company. He arranged to remain in army service while he headed DVC. During his tenure, DVC increased its power production from 45 MW to 700 MW, and its morale and productivity improved greatly.
 However, after only ten months at DVC, Bhagat died on 23 May 1975 of anaphylactic shock after an injection of penicillin, to which he was allergic, by a careless military doctor. His wife, Mohini Bhagat, presented Bhagat&#x27;s medals, including his Victoria Cross, to the museum of the Bombay Sappers in Pune on 1 February 1976, where they remain on display.

==Legacy==
The Indian Army has dedicated a &quot;Chair of Excellence&quot; in his memory at the United Service Institution of India (USI). USI and the Bombay Sappers also organise the annual &quot;Lieutenant General PS Bhagat Memorial Lecture&quot;.

<text>qpsmtpd is an SMTP daemon written in Perl. It was originally designed to be a drop-in replacement for &quot;qmail-smtpd&quot;, the SMTP component of qmail, and it is now also compatible with Postfix, Exim, sendmail and virtually any software that &quot;speaks SMTP&quot;. It has a flexible plugin system, making it easy to interoperate with other pieces in a mail system.

Its main purpose is to allow mail administrators to perform more advanced spam filtering than is possible with other SMTP daemons. As one example of dozens, the earlytalker plugin blocks many viruses and mass mailers based on their characteristic violation of basic protocol, even before they start sending mail data.

The program&#x27;s main author is Ask Bjørn Hansen. It is licensed under the MIT License.

== Qpsmtpd Plugins ==

A defining virtue of qpsmtpd is its plugin system and collection of plugins. In addition to basic plugins qpsmtpd has a suite of additional plugins that provide integration with external mail filters and processors as well as implementations of many email technologies. The following list is just a few of the many qpsmtpd plugins.

<doc id="1221810" wikidata="Q4719721" url="?curid=1221810" title="Alexander Murray, 8th Earl of Dunmore">
<text>Alexander Edward Murray, 8th Earl of Dunmore (22 April 1871 – 29 January 1962), known by the courtesy title Viscount Fincastle until 1907, was a Scottish peer, soldier and politician.

==Early life and colonial military career==
Murray was born on 22 April 1871 to Charles Murray, 7th Earl of Dunmore and Lady Gertrude Coke, immediately taking the courtesy title of Viscount Fincastle. His grandparents included Alexander Murray, 6th Earl of Dunmore, Lady Catherine Herbert, Thomas Coke, 2nd Earl of Leicester, and Juliana Whitbread. His paternal great-grandmother was the Russian noblewoman Countess Catherine Woronzoff (or Vorontsova), daughter of the Russian ambassador to St James&#x27;s, Semyon Romanovich Vorontsov. He was educated privately and at Eton before joining the army.
On 30 May 1892, Murray was commissioned into the 16th Lancers and sent to India. Murray was aide-de-camp to Victor Bruce, 9th Earl of Elgin, Governor-General of India from 1895 to 1897. In 1896, he accompanied the Dongola Expedition to the Sudan and saw action in the Mahdist War.

===Victoria Cross===
In 1897, aged 26, while a lieutenant in the 16th Lancers, Murray returned to India also acting as a war correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot;. On 17 August 1897 at Nawa Kili, Upper Swat, British India, Lieutenant Murray with two other officers (Robert Bellew Adams and Hector Lachlan Stewart MacLean) and five men of the Guides, went under a heavy and close fire, to the rescue of a lieutenant of the Lancashire Fusiliers who was lying disabled by a bullet wound and surrounded by enemy swordsmen. While the wounded officer was being brought under cover, he was killed by a bullet. One of the officers of the rescue party was mortally wounded and four horses were shot. The message sent to their superiors read:
Murray received the Victoria Cross for his actions, becoming the only journalist to be so honoured.

==Later political and military career==
Murray&#x27;s account of his colonial service was published in 1898. In 1899, Murray was posted to South Africa as aide-de-camp to General Sir H. C. Chermside in South Africa. He fought in the Second Boer War and was present at the Relief of Kimberley. In late 1901 he raised Fincastle&#x27;s Horse (31st Battalion Imperial Yeomanry, comprising 139th–142nd and 177th Companies), and was appointed in command of the battalion with the temporary rank of Lieutenant-colonel 22 January 1902. The battalion numbered 32 officers and 603 men, recruited mainly from the Highlands. They left Edinburgh in April 1902 to embark the SS Galatea for South Africa, where they arrived the following month. The war in South Africa ended shortly after their arrival, and Lord Fincastle stayed until late November, when he returned on the . He relinquished the command of the 31st battalion Imperial Yeomanry in January 1903. For his service in South Africa he earned a Mention in Despatches.
In 1906, Murray was awarded the Royal Victorian Order for services to the Prince of Wales, in connection with the marriage of King Alfonso of Spain. When in February 1907 Murray&#x27;s father died, he succeeded to the family titles, becoming the eighth earl, and resigned his commission to look after the family&#x27;s considerable estates. He lived at 55 Lancaster Gate, London.

He returned to active duty in 1914 with the outbreak of World War I, serving as a staff officer on the Western Front. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order during the Battle of the Somme, was mentioned in dispatches four times and wounded twice.
Between the wars, Murray held political office, serving as a government whip in the House of Lords; first, as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms in 1924; and then as a Lord-in-waiting from 1930 to 1936. He also held the ceremonial role of Deputy Lieutenant of Inverness-shire.

==Personal life==
On 5 January 1904, he married Lucinda Dorothea Kemble, daughter of Colonel Horace William Kemble. They had three children:

*Lady Marjorie Hilda Murray (1904-2000)
*Edward David Murray, Viscount Fincastle (1908–1940). Killed in action in northern France on 5 June, while serving as a Captain with 4th Bn. Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders, he is buried at the London Cemetery and Extension on the Somme.
*Lady Mary Elizabeth Murray (1913-2000), married Major Peter Oldfield in April 1937.

He died in London on 29 January 1962 and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. His titles then passed to his grandson, John Alexander Murray (1939–1980), 9th Earl of Dunmore, 9th Viscount of Fincastle, 9th Lord Murray of Blair, Moulin and Tillimet, and 5th Baron Dunmore.

<text>Peter Scawen Watkinson Roberts, (28 July 1917 – 8 December 1979) was a Royal Navy officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Roberts was 24 years old, and a lieutenant in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 16 February 1942 north of Crete, in the Mediterranean, HM Submarine &quot;Thrasher&quot;, after attacking and sinking a supply ship, was itself attacked. &quot;Thrasher&quot; was subjected to a three-hour depth charge attack and aerial bombing.

Later, after surfacing, two unexploded bombs were discovered in the gun-casing. Lieutenant Roberts and a petty officer (Thomas William Gould) removed the first one without too much difficulty, but the second bomb had penetrated the side plating of the gun emplacement, and then the deck casing above the pressure hull. Roberts and Gould entered the confined space (which was no more than 2 ft high in places), and lying flat, wormed past deck supports, battery ventilators, and drop bollards. The petty officer then lay on his back with the 100 lb bomb in his arms while the lieutenant dragged him along by the shoulders. Meanwhile, &quot;Thrasher&quot; was surfaced, stationary, and close inshore to enemy waters. If the submarine was forced to crash dive, both men would drown. It was 40 minutes before they got the bomb clear, wrapped it in sacking, and dropped it over the side.

Roberts&#x27; VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

The award of the two new VCs was announced by the BBC on 11 June 1942.

<text>Major George Murray Rolland VC (12 May 1869 – 9 July 1910) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
He was born on 12 May 1869 at Wellington, Madra Presidency, British India, the son of Major P. M. Rolland, R.A. and educated at Harrow and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before being commissioned into the Bedfordshire Regiment in November 1889. He transferred to the Indian Staff Corps on the 11 August 1891. He was appointed a double company commander with the 1st Bombay Grenadiers on 4 February 1901, and appointed a Special Service Officer on the Staff of the Somaliland Field Force on 25 October 1902, leaving Bombay via Aden for British Somaliland the previous day.

==Details==
He was 33 years old, and a captain in the 1st Bombay Grenadiers, Indian Army, employed Berbera -Bohotle Flying Column during the Third Somaliland Expedition when on 22 April 1903 after the action at British Somaliland, the rearguard got considerably behind the rest of the column. Captain Rolland and William George Walker, with four other men were with a fellow officer when he fell badly wounded and Captain Rolland ran back some 500 yards to get help while the others stayed with the casualty, endeavouring to keep off the enemy who were all round. This they succeeded in doing, and when the officer in charge of the column (John Edmund Gough) arrived they managed to get the wounded man on to a camel. He was, however, hit again and died immediately.

His VC is on display at the Lord Ashcroft Galley in the Imperial War Museum in London.

==Later life==
In November 1906, he was appointed the Adjutant of the Nagpur Volunteer Rifles, with whom he was serving when he died from a fall. He achieved the rank of major, being promoted 9 November 1907. Recently his grave was discovered in Nagpur in routine cleaning exercise.

<text>The Banqiao Reservoir Dam () is a dam on the River Ru (), a tributary of the Hong River in Zhumadian City, Henan province, China. The Banqiao dam and Shimantan Reservoir Dam () are among 62 dams in Zhumadian that failed catastrophically in 1975 during Typhoon Nina. The dam was subsequently rebuilt.

==History==

===Construction===

Construction of the Banqiao dam began in April 1951 on the Ru River with the help of Soviet consultants as part of a project to control flooding and provide electrical power generation. The construction was a response to severe flooding in the Huai River Basin in 1949 and 1950. The dam was completed in June 1952. Because of the absence of hydrology data, the design standard was lower than usual. After the 1954 Huai River great flood, the upstream reservoirs including Banqiao were extended, constructed, and consolidated. Banqiao Dam was increased in height by . The dam crest level was above sea level and the crest level of the wave protection wall was above sea level. The total capacity of the reservoir was 492 million m3 (398,000 acre feet), with 375 million m3 (304,000 acre feet) reserved for flood storage. The dam was made of clay and was high. The maximum discharge of the reservoir was per second.

Cracks in the dam and sluice gates appeared after completion due to construction and engineering errors. They were repaired with the advice from Soviet engineers and the new design, dubbed &quot;the iron dam&quot;, was considered unbreakable.

====Whistle-blower====
Chen Xing (), one of China&#x27;s foremost hydrologists, was involved in the design of the dam but he was also a vocal critic of the government&#x27;s dam building policy which involved many dams in the basin. He had recommended 12 sluice gates for the Banqiao Dam but this was criticized as being excessive and the number was reduced to five. Other dams in the project, including the Shimantan Dam, had a similar reduction of safety features and Chen was removed from the project. In 1961, after problems with the water system were revealed, Chen was brought back to help. He continued to be an outspoken critic of the system and was again removed from the project.

===1975 Banqiao Dam failure===

In August 1975, the Banqiao dam collapsed, creating the third-largest flood in history which affected a total population of 10.15 million and inundated around 30 cities and counties of 12,000 square kilometers (or 3 million acres), with an estimated death toll ranging from tens of thousands to 240,000.

===Reconstruction===
Within eleven years of the dam failure, the lower reach of the River Ru, esp. Zhumadian City, experienced several more disastrous floods. After many feasibility studies, the new Banqiao Reservoir reconstruction was listed as a key national project of The Seventh Five-Year Plan of China. The project owner was Huai River Water Resources Commission. The construction contractor was Changjiang Gezhouba Engineering Bureau. By the end of 1986, the rebuilding project commenced. On June 5, 1993, the project was certified by the Chinese government.

The reconstructed Banqiao Reservoir controls a catchment area of . The maximum reserve capacity is 675 million m3 (178 billion gallons), a capacity increase of 34% above the capacity of the failed dam. The effective storage is 256 million m3 (67.6 billion gallons) and the corresponding normal high water level is above sea level. The flood control storage is 457 million m3 (121 billion gallons). The dam is made of clay and is long and high. The dam crest level is above sea level. The maximum discharge of the reservoir is per second.

==Legacy==
After the disaster of the Banqiao dam failure, the Chinese government became very focused on surveillance, repair, and consolidation of reservoir dams. China has 87,000 reservoirs across the country; most of which were built in the 1950s–1970s using low construction standards. Most of these reservoirs are in serious disrepair, posing challenges to the prevention and control of flood-triggered geological disasters in areas with a population of 130 million or more. China&#x27;s medium and small rivers are considered to be the Achilles&#x27; heel in the country&#x27;s river control systems. According to a report from 2010, by the Ministry of Water Resources, China has invested () since the 1998 Yangtze River floods in repairing and consolidating the country&#x27;s 9,197 degraded reservoirs, of which 2,397 are large or medium-sized, and 6,800 are key small reservoirs.

<text>John Readitt VC (19 January 1897 – 9 June 1964) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 20 years old, and a private in the 6th Battalion, The South Lancashire Regiment (The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Volunteers), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.
On 25 February 1917 at Alqayat-al-Gaharbigah Bend, Mesopotamia, Private Readitt advanced five times along a water-course in the face of heavy machine-gun fire at very close range, being the sole survivor on each occasion. These advances drove the enemy back and about 300 yards of the water-course was made good in an hour. After his officer had been killed, Private Readitt, on his own initiative, made several more advances. On reaching the enemy barricade he was forced to retire, but gave ground slowly continuing to throw bombs. When support reached him he held a forward bend by bombing until the position was consolidated.

==Further information==
He later achieved the rank of Sergeant. Readitt was also awarded the Bronze Medal of Military Valor by Italy.

<doc id="1221850" wikidata="Q734363" url="?curid=1221850" title="SsangYong Rodius">
<text>The SsangYong Rodius (Korean: 쌍용 로디우스, sold in Australia, Chile, New Zealand, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Morocco, Singapore and South Africa as the Stavic) is an automobile released in late 2004 by the South Korean automaker SsangYong Motor Company. Rodius is an inaccurate portmanteau of the words road and Zeus, which is intended to mean &quot;Lord of the Road.&quot;
Considered a multi-purpose vehicle (MPV), it is available in 7, 9 and 11 seat configurations (3 or 4 rows), a 5-seater version is also available in Hong Kong. The seats can be folded to act as tables or folded further (double folded) to add extra cargo area. They can be turned around, encouraging awkward conversation when slid forward and backward.

== First generation (2004–2013) ==

The engines are the Mercedes-Benz licensed 3.2 L 6-cylinder gasoline engine ( &amp; ) and the 2.7 L 5-cylinder common rail diesel engine ( &amp; ). The diesel engine was criticised as &#x27;old-school&#x27; and &#x27;dated&#x27;, but praised for &#x27;solid Mercedes underpinnings&#x27;.

The car was designed by Steve Park, former head of the automotive design college in Seoul. The design goal was to capture the essence of a luxury yacht.

In August 2008, the Rodius received a facelift which reduced criticism concerning its appearance, however the styling was still widely panned. Afterwards, because of poor popularity, the Rodius was discontinued in Europe without a direct successor on December 31, 2011. However, on July 2, 2012, the Rodius returned with the new name Rodius Euro which comes with the e-XDi200 diesel engine that produces 155PS of power, available with either a 6-speed MT or a 5G-Tronic automatic unit sourced from Mercedes-Benz. The manual transmission was often criticised by reviewers for a poor gearchange.

The car was criticised on release by many reviewers for poor build quality, handling, refinement, emissions, performance, safety, ride, and interior finish, but praised for its space, practicality, value for money, low price, number of seats, after-sales service, the availability of four-wheel-drive, Mercedes-Benz mechanicals, and generous warranty terms. Many were used as airport taxis due to the generous warranty and large space available, enabling the car to transport entire families while carrying luggage. In 2015 the first generation Rodius became one of the most popular vehicles on the Banger racing circuit due to its high centre of gravity and high strength in a collision, eventually leading to a ban from the sport in 2017, the second vehicle to be banned from Banger racing after the Chrysler Imperial in 2016.

=== Appearance and styling ===
In the mass media, the vehicle received some negative reviews of its aesthetics, with many describing it as the &#x27;ugliest car ever&#x27;. The styling was described by contemporary reviewers and pundits as &#x27;awkward-looking&#x27;, &#x27;curious&#x27;, &#x27;pot-bellied&#x27;, &#x27;abysmal&#x27;, &#x27;distinctive&#x27;, &#x27;challenging&#x27;, &#x27;hideous&#x27;, &#x27;controversial&#x27;, &#x27;oddball&#x27;, &#x27;outrageous&#x27;, &#x27;strange&#x27;, &#x27;weird&#x27;, &#x27;unusual&#x27;, &#x27;gopping&#x27;, and an &#x27;ocular insult&#x27; with a &#x27;gormless face&#x27;, &#x27;barn-door&#x27; rear-end, &#x27;shopping-trolley wheels&#x27;, and &#x27;grotesquely oversized front features&#x27;.

The styling was also notably condemned by Top Gear regarding the appearance of the standard wheel trims and &#x27;gloopy front&#x27;, saying that &#x27;the whole rulebook on what is ugly has been rewritten&#x27;. As a follow-up, the car won the 2009 &#x27;WTF&#x27; award from &quot;Top Gear&quot; Magazine, which said that it &#x27;looks like it got bottled in a pub brawl and stitched back together by a blind man&#x27;. Jeremy Clarkson described the car as an &quot;unholy merger&quot; of a coupe and a removal van, with &#x27;wheels... the size of Smarties&#x27;, while Richard Hammond criticised it as &#x27;rather ugly&#x27;.

Due to its appearance, the car was quickly dubbed the &#x27;Odious Rodius&#x27; by automotive journalists, some of which described the car as a &#x27;surprised hippopotamus&#x27; that was &#x27;so ugly it could frighten small children&#x27;. The car was voted by readers of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; as the ugliest car on the road, taking 29% of the vote, commenting that &#x27;even its own mother would call it ugly&#x27;. In Australia, the car was described by the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; as looking like &#x27;a collapsing bus shelter&#x27;, and by &quot;Wheels&quot; as &#x27;having a face like a burnt thong&#x27;.

In response to this criticism, SsangYong denied that the car was ugly, and replied that the vehicle &#x27;comes with a strong emotional component that will make it the focus of attention wherever it goes&#x27;.

In 2017, the British motoring television series &quot;Top Gear&quot; attempted to realise Greenley&#x27;s design aspirations by combining a pre-facelift Rodius with a boat chassis to create a luxury yacht, which they named the SsangYacht. It was tested in Monaco harbour and reviewed by presenter Eddie Jordan for &quot;Boat International&quot;.

== Second generation (2012–2019) ==

The second generation Rodius, called the Korando Turismo (Korean: 코란도 투리스모) in South Korea, was revealed on February 5, 2013 and was first shown at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show with sales commencing soon after. The new model comes in nine-, ten- or eleven-seat configurations (in addition to the standard 5 and 7 seat variants) and offers up to 3,240 liters of cargo volume. Powering the new Rodius/Korando Turismo is a 2.0-liter turbo diesel engine connected to either a 6-speed manual gearbox or a 5-speed Mercedes-Benz-sourced automatic transmission. The current 2016+ Turismo offers an updated 7-speed Mercedes-Benz e-Tronic gearbox with the same 6-speed manual available. The 2016+ Turismo also complies with Euro VI emissions standards. The car is based on the same platform as its predecessor.

This generation of the car is badged as the Turismo in the United Kingdom due to the particularly negative reception of the previous model in the UK regarding its styling.

In March 2014, the second generation Stavic was awarded “2014 Car of the Year – Best MPV Design” by &quot;Grand Prix&quot;, the most famous automotive magazine in Thailand, at the 35th Bangkok International Motor Show 2014. The styling was praised as a significant improvement on its predecessor.

In July 2018, the final facelifted version was launched with smaller headlights, a new front grille, a new front bumper, a resigned bonnet, a redesigned front fenders, a new steering wheel and new infotainment unit.

In 2019, Ssangyong discontinued the Rodius/Stavic without any successor planned citing poor sales and implementation of the Euro 6D-Temp standards as both the 2.0L e-XDI 200 I4 and 2.2L e-XDI 220 I4 diesel engines offered on the Rodius are unable to be modified further to comply with the new emission regulations. The discontinuation of the Ssangyong Rodius/Stavic will allow Ssangyong to now put its focus on crossovers, SUVs, and pickup trucks.

<text>Lieutenant John O&#x27;Neill VC MM (also spelt O&#x27;Niell) (10 February 1897 − 16 October 1942) was a British Army officer and a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

O&#x27;Neill was 21 years old, and a sergeant in the 2nd Battalion, Prince of Wales&#x27;s Leinster Regiment, British Army during the First World War when in October 1918 near Moorsele, Belgium, he won the Victoria Cross.

The citation reads:
O&#x27;Neill later served in the RAF as an armourer sergeant where he served alongside T. E. Lawrence

On 1 June 1940 O&#x27;Neill was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps. In that year he was an officer on HMT &quot;Dunera&quot;, taking to Australia &quot;enemy aliens&quot;, most of whom were German Jews. Possessions of the internees were rifled through and stolen. He appeared as a witness at a subsequent court martial. The internees used the Russian song &quot;Stenka Rassin&quot; with new ironic German text:
 
John O&#x27;Neill died of a heart attack on 16 October 1942. He is buried at Holy Trinity Church, Hoylake, in The Wirral.

<text>Cecil Redvers Griffiths (18 February 1900 – 11 April 1945) was a Welsh athlete who won a gold medal at the 1920 Summer Olympics. He was subsequently barred from competing at the 1924 Summer Olympics due to a ruling that he had competed as a professional during his early career, but continued to successfully race in domestic competitions.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Griffiths&#x27; father, Benjamin, was a former able-bodied seaman born in a workhouse who settled in Neath upon leaving the Royal Navy. He was a successful local businessman, town councillor and committee member of Neath RFC. He married Sarah Trick in 1892.

Griffiths was Benjamin and Sarah&#x27;s fifth child of six, but only older siblings Ben and Eva survived beyond infancy. Their father died when Griffiths was eight. Griffiths showed promise as a winger for Neath RFC but did not progress beyond the junior sides due to the outbreak of the First World War.

Upon leaving school, Griffiths began work at the Great Western Railway depot in Neath. When he reached his eighteenth birthday in February 1918, he volunteered for the Queen&#x27;s Westminsters, a Territorial Army regiment in London. The war ended before Griffiths was sent on active service.

=== Athletics career ===
While in the army, Griffiths ran in several races, including winning the 440 yards at the 1918 Inter-Services Championships at Stamford Bridge. When the war ended, Griffiths joined Surrey Athletics Club and made his first appearance in the AAA Championships, finishing third in the 440 yards at the 1919 AAA Championships. Third place in the same race the following year at the 1920 AAA Championships, led to Griffiths being selected in the British team for the 1920 Summer Olympics.

Griffiths made his only Olympic Games appearance in the 1920 Antwerp Games, running the opening leg in the British 4×400 metres relay team which won the gold medal. He was also picked to represent Britain in the 400 metres but illness forced him to withdraw before the event.

In September 1920, soon after the Olympics, Griffiths was a member of the British Empire team that broke the 4×440 yards British record in a time of 3:20.8. The following year, Griffiths claimed the Welsh records in 220 yards and 440 yards. 

Griffths claimed third behind Robert Lindsay in the 440 yards event at the 1921 AAA Championships before switching focus to 880 yards. In his first season, he broke the Welsh record at this distance and finished runner-up to Edgar Mountain at the 1922 AAA Championships. He won the AAA Championships 880 yards in 1923 and 1925.

At the end of 1923 or in early 1924, Griffiths was banned by the International Amateur Athletics Federation and Amateur Athletic Association for receiving prize money at unregistered races in Neath and Swansea in 1917, the cumulative prizes of which totalled less than £10. As a reinstated professional, Griffiths was allowed to compete in domestic competitions but was prevented from representing the UK in international competitions. This barred him from the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, where it is likely that Griffiths would have competed in the 800 metres and 4×400 metres relay.

===Life after athletics===

Griffiths retired from competitive running in 1929. He lost his job in the Great Depression that followed the Wall Street crash and was forced to sell most of his trophies and medals. Griffiths found employment again at the coal depot office of the London Co-operative Society in Edgware. On the outbreak of the Second World War, Griffiths joined his local Home Guard and reportedly saved the life of a comrade who dropped a live grenade by throwing it over a blast wall.

Griffiths died of heart failure in 1945 at Edgware railway station in London, leaving a widow and two sons. He was buried in St. Lawrence&#x27;s Church in London in an unmarked grave. In 2022 a headstone was installed at the grave.

==Personal life==
Griffiths met his wife, Gladys (May) Rees, at a junior running race in Neath in 1915. They were later formally introduced by May&#x27;s older brother. They married in St. David&#x27;s Parish Church in Neath on 25 July 1922 but spent all of their married life in London. Griffiths had two sons, John and Cecil (usually called Rees).

One of Griffiths&#x27; uncles, George Trick, was a captain of Neath RFC. A cousin, Kathleen Trick, is thought to be the first identifiable female depicted in rugby kit.

<text>Roderick McGregor VC (c. 1822 – 9 August 1888) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
McGregor was about 31 years old, and a private in the 1st Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own), British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

In July 1855 at the Quarries, Crimea, a bandsman going to fetch water from a well in front of the advanced trench, was killed. A number of men at once rushed out determined to drive the Russian riflemen from the pits which they occupied. Private McGregor and two others were the first to reach the Russians, whom they drove out, killing some. Private McGregor was employed as a sharpshooter in the advance trenches before Sebastopol. He crossed an open space under fire and, taking cover under a rock, dislodged two Russians who were occupying a rifle-pit.

The official citation was as follows:

<text>George Burdon McKean (4 July 1888 – 28 November 1926) was an English-Canadian soldier who served in World War I. McKean was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for valour in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
George Burdon McKean was born in Willington, County Durham, England on 4 July 1888. He came to Canada in 1902 and settled in Edmonton. He was a student at the University of Alberta and assistant minister at Robertson Church. Either just before his enlistment in January 1915 or sometime a few months after, he married Isabel Hall (and sometime later he married again). (A book he wrote after the war, Making Good - A Story of North-West Canada, was based on his knowledge of life in Alberta.)

==World War I==
In early 1915 McKean enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force. He was awarded three separate medals for outstanding valour. In the course of his military service, he received the Military Medal and the Victoria Cross and, after he was commissioned as an officer, the Military Cross. He was one of only a handful of people who have won all three and lived to peacetime.

As a corporal in 1917, he was awarded the Military Medal for rescuing wounded men under fire.

A year later, he was 29 years old, and a lieutenant in the 14th (The Royal Montreal Regiment) Battalion, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 27/28 April 1918 at the Gavrelle Sector, France, when Lieutenant McKean&#x27;s party was held up at a block in the communication trench by intense fire, he ran into the open, leaping over the block head first on top of one of the enemy. Whilst lying there, he was attacked by another with a fixed bayonet. He shot both of these men, captured the position, then sent back for more bombs, and until they arrived he engaged the enemy single-handed. He then rushed a second block, killing two of the enemy, capturing four others, and driving the remainder into a dug-out, which he then destroyed.

He later achieved the rank of captain.

In the closing months of the war, Canada&#x27;s Hundred Days, he led the capture of Cagnicourt near Arras, using, one historian wrote, &quot;little but courage and bravado.&quot; He won the Military Cross but was probably due another Victoria Cross as his actions were so incredible.

McKean wrote of his wartime experiences in &quot;Scouting Thrills: The Memoir of a Scout Officer in the Great War&quot; (1919, re-issued by CEF Books in 2003).

He remained with the army after the end of World War I, serving in Egypt. He left the army in March 1926.

==Later life==

After leaving the army he settled in England, finding work in a sawmill, but within a few short months, on 26 November 1926, he was killed in an industrial accident, leaving a widow who two days later bore him a daughter.

He is buried at Brighton Extra Mural Cemetery, Sussex, England.

==Legacy==
His Victoria Cross is stored at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

The Church Square of Cagnicourt, France was renamed &#x27;La Place Du Lieutenant George Burdon McKean&#x27; in his honour, displaying a plaque to his honour, on 6 September 2003. Cagnicourt is where he earned his Military Cross.

A mountain in the Victoria Cross Ranges is named in his honour.

His name is also present on the memorial wall located in Convocation Hall at the University Of Alberta.

On 29 April 2018, a memorial stone for McKean was unveiled in his birth town of Willington, County Durham.

<doc id="1221866" wikidata="Q52206" url="?curid=1221866" title="Lope de Rueda">
<text>Lope de Rueda (c.1505&lt;1510–1565) was a Spanish dramatist and author, regarded by some as the best of his era. A versatile writer, he also wrote comedies, farces, and pasos. He was the precursor to what is considered the golden age of Spanish literature.

His plays are considered a transitional stage between Torres Naharro and Lope de Vega.

==Early life==
He was born early in the sixteenth century in Seville, where, according to Cervantes, he worked as a metal-beater. His name first occurs in 1554 as acting at Benavente, taking mainly comic roles. Eventually he got to be, between 1558 and 1561, manager of a strolling company which visited Segovia, Seville, Toledo, Madrid, Valencia and Córdoba. Cervantes, a child at the time, recalled having seen him and his company perform.

==Works==
His works were issued posthumously in 1567 by Timoneda, who toned down certain passages in the texts. de Rueda&#x27;s more ambitious plays are mostly adapted from the Italian; in &quot;Eufemia&quot; he draws on Boccaccio, in &quot;Medora&quot; he utilizes Giancarli&#x27;s &quot;Zingara&quot; as well as Byzantine motives, in &quot;Arinelina&quot; he combines Raineri&#x27;s &quot;Attilia&quot; with Cecchi&#x27;s &quot;Servigiale&quot; to create a satirical work ridiculing the superstitions current among Andalusians, and in &quot;Los Engañados&quot; (&quot;The Deceived&quot;) he uses &quot;Gl&#x27;ingannati&quot;, a comedy produced by the Intronati, a literary society at Siena - itself ultimately derived from Plautus&#x27; &quot;Menaechmi&quot;. These follow the original so closely that they give no idea of de Rueda&#x27;s talent; but in his &quot;pasos&quot; or prose interludes he displays an abundance of riotous humour, great knowledge of low life, and a most happy gift of dialogue. His works in the genre include &quot;La Tierra de Jauja&quot; (&quot;Jauja Land&quot;), &quot;Las accitunas&quot; (&quot;The Olive Trees&quot;). &quot;Cornudo y contento&quot; (&quot;Cuckolded and Content&quot;), &quot;El condidado&quot; (&quot;The Guest&quot;), &quot;Los criados&quot; (&quot;The Servants&quot;), and &quot;Los lacayos lardones&quot; (&quot;The Thieving Lackeys&quot;).

&quot;Discordia y cuestion de amor&quot; (&quot;Discord and a Question of Love&quot;) is a rhymed pastoral play. &quot;Auto de Naval y Abigail&quot; (&quot;The Story of Naval and Abigail&quot;) is an Auto sacramental play based on the Bible.

He disdained the use of bombastic language and what he considered an excessive use of deus ex machina by other playwrights.
His predecessors mostly wrote for courtly audiences or for the study; de Rueda with his strollers created a taste for the drama which he was able to gratify, and he is admitted both by Cervantes and Lope de Vega to be the true founder of the national theatre.

His works have been reprinted by the marqués de Fuensanta del Valle in the &quot;Colección de libros raros curiosos&quot;, vols. xxiii. and xxiv.

===Modern adaptation===
Nineteen of the 26 pasos were translated into English between 1980 and 1990 by Joan Bucks Hansen, and staged by Steve Hansen and the St. George Street Players of St. Augustine,FL where they were performed nightly for five years in the city&#x27;s restored Spanish Quarter; and they presented seven of the translations in 1984 at the Ninth Siglo de Oro Festival at Chamizal.

== Personal life ==
He was twice married; first to actress, singer and dancer, Mariana, who had spent six years as a performer in service to the frail and infirm Don Gaston, Duke de Medinaceli, an avowed friar and cleric, whose estate was the subject of a lawsuit filed by Lope de Rueda on his wife&#x27;s behalf laying claim to six years of back wages. de Rueda&#x27;s second marriage was to Rafaela Angela, a Valenciana and woman of property, who bore him a daughter.

== Death ==
In Córdoba, de Rueda fell ill, and on 21 March 1565 made a will which he was too exhausted to sign; he probably died shortly afterwards, and is said by Cervantes to have been buried in Córdoba cathedral.

<text>A self-coup, also called an autocoup () or coup from the top, is a form of coup d&#x27;état in which a political leader, having come to power through legal means, stays in power illegally through the actions of themselves or their supporters. The leader may dissolve or render powerless the national legislature and unlawfully assume extraordinary powers. Other measures may include annulling the constitution, suspending civil courts, and having the head of government assume dictatorial powers.

From 1946 to the beginning of 2021, an estimated 148 self-coup attempts took place, 110 in autocracies and 38 in democracies.

<text>Guillermo Héctor Francella (born 14 February 1955) is an Argentine actor and comedian. Besides a long history of working as a television leading man, he also has a varied theatrical and film career. Francella is widely regarded by experts and critics of performance as one of the most influential and popular actors of his country.

==Biography==
Guillermo Francella is the second of two brothers children of Ricardo Héctor Francella, a bank employee, gym teacher and weightlifting coach at Racing Club and Adelina Redondo. He spent his first two years of life in Villa del Parque, Buenos Aires, Argentina and later the family moved to Béccar, a northern neighborhood of Greater Buenos Aires where Francella lived the rest of his childhood. The house was located next to that of his paternal grandparents, Domenico and Zaída; his grandfather was an Italian immigrant in Argentina who had arrived in Argentina from Falconara Albanese, Calabria and whose original last name was Frangella. He attended and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the Institute June 20 of San Isidro, Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1972. Later, although he wanted to study theater, he continued studying journalism. He got a journalist&#x27;s degree after studying three years and later started working for the magazine &quot;Gente&quot;, where he served as a journalist for three months before being fired. He also worked as clothing seller in a store, as an insurance salesman and as a member of a real estate company with his uncle. His father died when Francella was twenty-six years old, which was &quot;a very strong blow&quot; to his family. Francella is a catholic.

==Career==
His first approach to acting was after finishing high school when he made a play with some classmates, the comedy &quot;Charlatanes&quot; by Julio F. Escobar. In the early 1980s he acted in a commercial for &quot;Cinzano&quot;. He debuted on television in 1980, with &quot;Los hnos. Torterolo&quot; and then was part of &quot;Historia de un trepador&quot;. In 1985 he filmed his first film, &quot;El telo y la tele&quot;, also participated as an extra in the film &quot;Los caballeros de la cama redonda&quot; starring Alberto Olmedo. He participated in other television series of the 1980s, such as &quot;El infiel&quot;, playing the role of Felipe for a year. In 1986, he filmed three films, &quot;Camarero nocturno en Mar del Plata&quot; and &quot;Las colegialas&quot;. He also acted in television series, such as &quot;El lobo&quot; and &quot;Juegos prohibidos&quot;. His career as a television and film actor continued during the following years with films such as &quot;Los pilotos más locos del mundo&quot;, &quot;Paraíso relax&quot; and &quot;Bañeros II, la playa loca&quot;, which had its third part in 2006. His first big hit on television was telecomedy &quot;De carne somos&quot;, broadcast by Canal 13 in 1988. After this strip he starred in &quot;Dalo por hecho&quot;, broadcast by Canal 13, playing an Argentine &quot;chanta&quot; (a scammer). Francella also made two TV series that were very popular at the time, &quot;La familia Benvenuto&quot; and &quot;Un hermano es un hermano&quot;, with Javier Portales.

In 1989 he starred in one of his greatest successes on film, the action comedy &quot;Los extermineitors&quot;, which worked mainly as a spoof on the action films of the 1980s. The following year, he filmed &quot;Extermineitors II, la venganza del dragón&quot;, the sequel and second part of the &quot;Extermineitors saga&quot; of comedy films; that same saga eventually became spawned into the 1992 action-comedy series &quot;Brigada Cola&quot;, an &quot;Extermineitors&quot; spinoff where Francella played the protagonist, Francachella. &quot;Brigada Cola&quot; was a big rating success that even became a short-lived theater version of the show with the same cast. During the early 1990s, Francella starred in two more sequels for &quot;Los extermineitors&quot;, with the saga coming to an end with the fourth part in the southern summer of 1992. When he returned to work on TV his fame had grown exponentially, even internationally, which is why his next series, &quot;Naranja y media&quot; was translated into English and broadcast in several countries under the title &quot;My Better Halves&quot;. His next movie, &quot;Un Argentino en New York&quot;, was filmed in Spain and United States; starring alongside the Uruguayan actress/singer Natalia Oreiro, it became one of the greatest Argentine cinema hits.

1999 came with a new challenge as an actor, the series &quot;Trillizos, dijo la partera&quot; with the actress Laura Novoa. On this occasion, he had to play three Buenos Aires brothers, Luigi, Marcelo and Enzo, that integrated a classic family of Italian roots, but in turn, each with a different personality that characterized them. In 2000 he filmed &quot;Papá es un ídolo&quot; it was translated in English with the name of &quot;Daddy is My Idol&quot; in this movie Manuel Bandera and Millie Stegman. He returned to television in 2001, in one of the most definitive roles of his career, in the comic program &quot;Poné a Francella&quot;, where he took part in several sketches next to his cast. He had two seasons and aired until December 2002. There he shared the cast with Gabriel Goity, Alberto Fernández de Rosa, Roberto Carnaghi, Florencia Peña, Andrea Frigerio, Mariana Briski, Manuel Wirtz, René Bertrand, Toti Ciliberto and Cecilia Milone and with newly emerged models such as Pamela David, Luciana Salazar and Julieta Prandi. The repetitions were broadcast until 2006 during the weekends in Argentina, while in other countries of Latin America and United States it was televised until the end of 2004. In 2003, he filmed in Cuba, &quot;Un día en el paraíso&quot;, movie in which Guillermo Francella played two characters, Reynaldo and Roy. That year he starred in the unit comedy, &quot;Durmiendo con mi jefe&quot;, with Luis Brandoni broadcast by Canal 13.

His next movie, &quot;Papá se volvió loco&quot;, was released in 2005 and became a hit in theaters. From 2005 to 2006 he starred in the series &quot;Casados con Hijos&quot;, an Argentine remake of &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, playing the role of José &quot;Pepe&quot; Argento. For that role, in the first season, Asociación de Periodistas de la Televisión y la Radiofonía Argentinas awarded the Martín Fierro Award to the &quot;Best Leading Actor in Comedy&quot;, and in the second season, he was nominated again but lost to Facundo Arana. During these two years, he starred with Enrique Pinti at the Lola Membrives theater in Buenos Aires and then at the Auditorium Mar del Plata the musical comedy &quot;The Producers&quot;, a great success with both the public and critics. It was Francella&#x27;s debut in the musical genre.

In 2007 he starred in a new comic film, &quot;Incorregibles&quot;, together with comedian Dady Brieva and model Gisela Van Lacke. The film was a box-office success, but received negative reviews by the critics. In 2008, he made a special participation in the final chapter of the soap opera &quot;Vidas robadas&quot; which won the Martín Fierro de Oro Award 2008. At the end of the year, he traveled to Mexico to star &quot;Rudo y Cursi&quot; along with the Mexican actors Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna. In 2009, he starred alongside Ricardo Darín and Soledad Villamil in &quot;El secreto de sus ojos&quot; which sold approximately two million tickets and became the most watched movie of the year, as well as the second most successful national film of all time in its country. The movie won an Oscar for the best non-English speaking film.

In 2011, he returned to the small screen with the TV comedy &quot;El hombre de tu vida&quot;, where he played the role of Hugo, a man affected by a midlife crisis who decides to work professionally as a gigolo. In addition, along with Arturo Puig, he starred in the Ana Katz comedy film &quot;Los Marziano&quot;. In 2012 saw the premiere of the comedy film &quot;¡Atraco!&quot;, starring Francella alongside Nicolás Cabré and Amaia Salamanca under the direction of Eduard Cortés, playing a fictional Peronist named Merello. In addition, he had a small role in the film &quot;El vagoneta en el mundo del cine&quot;. In 2013, he starred in the Marcos Carnevale romantic film, &quot;Corazón de León&quot;, where he played León Godoy, a short-stature man who falls in love with Ivana Cornejo (Julieta Díaz) a divorced lawyer. For this interpretation he received his second nomination for Silver Condor Award, this time as Best Actor.

In 2014, he starred with Inés Estévez and Alejandro Awada in the comedy-drama &quot;El misterio de la felicidad&quot;, directed by Daniel Burman. Francella plays the role of a man looking for his missing friend while falling in love with his friend&#x27;s wife. In addition, Francella returned to the theater and starring along Adrián Suar in &quot;Dos pícaros sinvergüenzas&quot;, where he plays Lawrence Williams, a man who scams women together with his partner.

<text>Dioptrics is the branch of optics dealing with refraction, especially by lenses. In contrast, the branch dealing with mirrors is known as &quot;catoptrics&quot;. Telescopes that create their image with an objective that is a convex lens (refractors) are said to be &quot;dioptric&quot; telescopes. 

An early study of dioptrics was conducted by Ptolemy in relationship to the human eye as well as refraction in media such as water. The understanding of the principles of dioptrics was further expanded by Alhazen, considered the father of modern optics.

<text>Cambridge Assessment English or Cambridge English develops and produces Cambridge English Qualifications and the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). The organisation contributed to the development of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), the standard used around the world to benchmark language skills, and its qualifications and tests are aligned with CEFR levels.

Cambridge Assessment English is part of Cambridge Assessment, a non-teaching department of the University of Cambridge which merged with Cambridge University Press to form Cambridge University Press &amp; Assessment in August 2021.

== Current Cambridge English qualifications/exams ==
Each Cambridge English Qualifications focuses on a level of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR).

===Schools===
These English qualifications are to help school-age children and young people improve their English language skills.

===General and higher education===
These qualifications are designed for adult learners. A2 Key, B1 Preliminary and B2 First have the same exam format (e.g. number of papers, number of questions, time allowance) as the schools&#x27; versions of these qualifications, but use different topics and content suited to adult learners.

===Business===
These qualifications are designed for adult learners learning English for use in a business context.

===Multilevel tests===
Multilevel tests are used to find out which English learning programme or exam is right for a student. These cover multiple levels of the CEFR in one test.
Cambridge Exams Publishing, a joint venture with Cambridge University Press, produces Cambridge-branded IELTS resources and materials to help learners prepare and practise for their tests.

=== Teaching ===

==Partnerships and acquisitions==
In the 1980s Cambridge Assessment English, the British Council and IDP Education formed the international IELTS partnership which delivers the IELTS tests.

In 2010 Cambridge Assessment English and the English Language Institute Testing and Certificate Division of the University of Michigan agreed to form a not-for-profit collaboration known as CaMLA (Cambridge Michigan Language Assessments). Cambridge Assessment English owns 65% of the venture.

Since 2011 Cambridge Exams Publishing, a partnership between Cambridge Assessment English and the English Language Teaching (ELT) business of Cambridge University Press, develops official Cambridge preparation materials for Cambridge English and IELTS exams.

In 2013 Cambridge Assessment English formed a joint venture with the Box Hill Institute to deliver the Occupational English Test, known as OET.

In 2019 Cambridge Assessment English acquired English Language (ELiT), an artificial intelligence developed off technology from the University of Cambridge, to support new English language assessment products.

== Alignment with the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) ==
Cambridge Assessment English was involved in the early development of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) and all Cambridge English qualifications and tests are aligned with the levels described by the CEFR. Each Cambridge English Qualification targets specific CEFR levels but the exam also contains test material at the adjacent levels. For example, B2 First is aimed at B2, but there are also test items that cover B1 and C1. This allows for inferences to be drawn about candidates&#x27; abilities if they are a level below or above the one targeted. Candidates are encouraged to take the exam most suitable to their needs and level of ability.

==Research==
The Cambridge English EFL Evaluation Unit was established in 1989 and was the first dedicated research unit of its kind. This unit is now called the Research and Validation Group and is the largest dedicated research team of any English language assessment body. Research is published in the Studies in Language Testing (SiLT) series.

==Awards==
In 2015, Cambridge Assessment English was awarded the Queen&#x27;s Award for Enterprise in the &#x27;international trade&#x27; category.

== Qualification development==

===Cambridge University&#x27;s examination board (UCLES)===
The first Cambridge English exam was produced in 1913 by UCLES (University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate). UCLES had been set up in 1858 to provide exams to students who were not members of a university.

There was a growing concern in Britain with standards of school education and the transition from secondary to tertiary-level education. A number of schools &quot;petitioned the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge [to provide] means of comparing achievements of pupils across schools.&quot; The secondary education sector was still voluntary in nature. Without support from the state, it was logical to seek help from universities that were long established and widely admired. The University of Oxford and University of Cambridge, in particular, were &quot;regarded as viable sources of supervision.&quot;

UCLES was invited to set exams and inspect schools with the aim of raising educational standards. The University of Oxford also created its own examination board: the University of Oxford Delegacy of Local Examinations (UODLE). UODLE and its partner, the Association of Recognised English Language Schools, merged with UCLES in 1995.

The first UCLES examinations took place on 14 December 1858. The exams were designed to test for university selection and were taken by 370 candidates in British schools, churches and village halls. Candidates were required to &quot;satisfy the examiners&quot; in the analysis and parsing of a Shakespeare text; reading aloud; dictation; and composition (on either the recently deceased Duke of Wellington; a well-known book or a letter of application).

Female candidates were accepted by UCLES on a trial basis in 1864 and on a permanent basis from 1867. Cambridge University itself did not examine female students until 1882 and it was not until 1948 that women were allowed to graduate as full members of the university.

In the mid to late 19th century, UCLES exams were taken by candidates based overseas – in Trinidad and Tobago (from 1863), South Africa (from 1869), Guyana and New Zealand (from 1874), Jamaica (from 1882) and Malaysia (from 1891). Many of these candidates were children of officers of the British colonial service and exams were not yet designed for non-native speakers of English.

===The first Cambridge English exam===
In 1913 UCLES created the first exam for non-native speakers of English – the Certificate of Proficiency in English (CPE – now known as C2 Proficiency). This may have been prompted by the development of English exams &quot;for foreigners&quot; by other universities.

CPE was originally a qualification for teachers: &quot;the Certificate of Proficiency in English is designed for Foreign Students who desire satisfactory proof of their knowledge of the language with a view to teaching it in foreign schools.&quot; The exam was only available for candidates aged 20 or over.

In 1913 the exam could be taken in Cambridge or London, for a fee of £3 (approximately £293 in 2012 prices). The exam lasted 12 hours and included:

# Translation from English into French or German: 2 hours
# Translation from French or German into English, and English Grammar: 2.5 hours
# English Essay: 2 hours
# English Literature: 3 hours
# English Phonetics: 1.5 hours
# Oral test: dictation (30 minutes); reading aloud and conversation (30 minutes)

The main influence behind the design of the exam was the grammar-translation teaching approach, which aims to establish reading knowledge (rather than the ability to communicate in the language). In 1913, the first requirement for CPE candidates was to translate texts. Translation remained prominent in foreign language teaching up until the 1960s. It was a core part of CPE until 1975 and an optional part until 1989.

However, CPE was also influenced by Henry Sweet and his book published in 1900: A Practical Study of Languages: A Guide for Teachers and Learners, which argued that &quot;the most natural method of teaching languages was through conversation.&quot; Due to this influence, speaking was part of Cambridge English exams from the very beginning.

===Exam questions in 1913===
Candidates were required to translate from English into French/German and translate from French/German into English. Here is a short segment from one of the passages candidates were asked to translate from English into German: The sentiments which animated Schiller&#x27;s poetry were converted into principles of conduct; his actions were as blameless as his writings were pure. With his simple and high predilections, with his strong devotedness to a noble cause, he contrived to steer through life, unsullied by its meanness, unsubdued by any of its difficulties or allurements ... In the English Essay paper, candidates were asked to write an essay for two hours, on one of the following subjects: &quot;the effect of political movements upon nineteenth-century literature in England; English Pre-Raphaelitism; Elizabethan travel and discovery; the Indian Mutiny; the development of local self-government; or Matthew Arnold.&quot; The exam board provided little or no formal structure. Concepts such as audience and purpose, and the length of the essay, were left for the candidate to decide.

The questions in the English Literature section were borrowed from the university&#x27;s Language and Literature matriculation exams for native speakers and included questions on Shakespeare&#x27;s Coriolanus and Milton&#x27;s Paradise Lost. Here is an example question: &quot;explain fully and comment on the following passages, stating the connexions in which they occur and any difficulties of reading, phraseology or allusion: &quot;&quot;&quot; It was not until 1930 that a Literature paper was designed specifically for CPE candidates.

The grammar section contained questions about grammar and lexis, e.g. &quot;give the past tense and past participle of each of the following verbs, dividing them into strong and weak ...&quot;, and questions about grammar and lexis usage, e.g. &quot;embody each of the following words into a sentence in such a way as to show that you clearly apprehend its meaning: commence, comment, commend ...&quot; At the time, this mirrored the approach to learning grammar in Latin and Greek (as well as modern languages).

Finally, a Phonetics paper was included as it was thought to be useful in the teaching of pronunciation. The paper required candidates to make phonetic transcriptions of long pieces of continuous text; describe the articulation of particular sounds; explain phonetic terms, and suggest ways of teaching certain sounds. Here are two example questions: &quot;explain the terms: &quot;glide&quot;, &quot;narrow vowel&quot;, &quot;semi-vowel&quot; and give two examples of each in both phonetic and ordinary spelling&quot; and &quot;how would you teach a pupil the correct pronunciation of the vowel sounds in: fare, fate, fat, fall, far?&quot;

===Revisions to the 1913 exam===
The 1913 CPE exam was taken by just three candidates. The candidates &quot;were able to converse fluently, expressing themselves on the whole, with remarkable ease and accuracy.&quot; However, all three candidates failed the exam and none of them was awarded a CPE certificate.

In its second year (1914), CPE gained in popularity, with 18 candidates and four passing. However, for the next 15 years candidature remained static. Italian and Spanish were added as languages for the translation paper in 1926.

In 1928, CPE had only 14 candidates and by 1929 it was in danger of being discontinued. Jack Roach, Assistant Secretary to the Syndicate from 1925 to 1945, decided to &quot;save it from the scrapheap&quot; and introduced a number of changes. The Phonetics paper was dropped and the essay questions became more a test of writing proficiency rather than a test of knowledge about British culture. Questions such as &quot;The best month of the year&quot; were preferred to the more culture-bound topics set in 1913, such as &quot;Elizabethan travel and discovery.&quot; The target candidature was broadened beyond teachers, to &quot;all foreign students who desire to obtain evidence of their practical knowledge of the languages, both written and spoken, as of their ability to read with comprehension standard works of English literature.&quot;

In 1932 it was decided to establish overseas exam centres. The first overseas centres were set up in Hamburg, Paris and San Remo (1933), followed by further centres in Italy (Rome and Naples), the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Latin America also became an exam area in the 1930s, with centres in Argentina and Uruguay.

In 1935 CPE started providing alternatives to the Literature paper, with an Economic and Commercial Knowledge paper – an early forerunner of English for Specific Purposes.

Then, in 1937–38, the University of Cambridge and University of Oxford decided to accept CPE as representing the standard in English required of all students, British or foreign, before the entrance to their university. To this day, CPE still serves as a qualification for entry to higher education. Following these changes CPE candidate numbers instantly began to rise, reaching 752 by the outbreak of World War II.

===World War II===
From 1939 onwards, thousands of refugees from the Spanish Civil War and occupied Europe started arriving in the UK and began taking UCLES exams while stationed in the UK.

UCLES launched the &quot;Lower Certificate in English (LCE)&quot; to meet the demand for certification at a lower level than CPE. A &quot;Preliminary&quot; exam, at a lower level than LCE, was also offered in 1944 as a special test to meet the contingencies of war. These were the first steps toward developing language assessments at different levels.

Polish servicemen and women made up a large proportion of the candidature. In 1943, over a third of all LCE Certificates were awarded to candidates from the Polish army and air force. This pattern continued throughout the war and into the post-war period. On one single day in 1948, no fewer than 2,500 Polish men and women of the Polish Resettlement Corps took the LCE.

UCLES tests were made available for prisoners of war in Britain and in Germany. In Britain, 1,500 prisoners of war took the exams, almost 900 of them Italians. In Germany, the War Organisation of the British Red Cross and Order of St John of Jerusalem made arrangements for UCLES examinations to be offered at prisoner-of-war camps with many Indian prisoners of war, in particular, taking LCE or School Certificate exams.

Examiners were asked to report on &quot;disturbance, loss of sleep, etc., caused by air raids, and on any exceptional difficulties ... during the examination period.&quot; One report noted that the candidates had been spending &quot;most of each day in the air-raid shelter&quot;; that candidate 5224, a probationer nurse, had been showing strain caused by helping with &quot;rescue work&quot;; and that the house of candidate 5222 had been bombed, whilst she was at school, with fatalities. Such were the circumstances of wartime exam takers and administrators.

Exams were also maintained clandestinely in continental European exam centres, which frequently meant unusual measures, including acts of determination and courage. However, UCLES was unable to fund and support the growing international network of English language examination centres around the world. Meanwhile, the British Council had a brief to disseminate British culture and educational links. In March 1941 a formal &#x27;Joint Agreement&#x27; was signed between the two organisations to collaborate on the distribution of UCLES exams around the world. This started a long-lasting relationship, which continues to this day.

===Post-war===
By 1947, there were over 6,000 UCLES candidates, with LCE double the size of CPE. Exam centres had been set up in Europe (17), Latin America (9), the Middle East (8), Africa (4) and the USA (1). Candidate numbers continued to grow, reaching over 20,000 by 1955, 44,000 by 1965, and over 66,000 by 1975.

However, by the 1970s demand was growing for exams at more clearly defined levels of proficiency. This set the scene for the Council of Europe and the development of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), which was initiated in 1971.

===Qualification at different levels===
UCLES had a few attempts at developing language assessments at different levels. During the Second World War, there was a three-level system: the Preliminary English Test, LCE and CPE. After the war, a new three-level system was introduced: LCE, CPE and DES (The Diploma of English Studies). However, as an extremely advanced exam, DES candidature never rose beyond a few hundred and was later discontinued.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the levels stabilised and the suite of exams we recognise today became established. A five-level system was developed, which characterises Cambridge English&#x27;s general English exams to the present day and laid the foundations for the levels in the CEFR.

* Level 1: the Key English Test (KET) was launched in 1994. It is now known as A2 Key.
* Level 2: the Preliminary English Test (PET) was originally used during the Second World War years. It reappeared in 1980 under close monitoring and was fully launched in the 1990s. It is now known as B1 Preliminary.
* Level 3: LCE, operational since the Second World War, continued under a new name: the First Certificate in English. It is now known as B2 First.
* Level 4: the Certificate in Advanced English (CAE) was launched in 1991. It is now known as C1 Advanced.
* Level 5: CPE, operational since 1913, became Cambridge English&#x27;s highest level qualification. It is now known as C2 Proficiency.

During this period there were also substantial revisions to the existing exams: B2 First and C2 Proficiency. These revisions included improving the authenticity of texts and tasks; increasing the weight on Listening and Speaking; improving the balance between grammar and vocabulary items in the Reading paper; and adding a broader range of texts in the Composition and Use of English papers, (e.g. letter-writing, dialogues, speeches, note-taking, and discursive and descriptive compositions).

With increased weight on Listening and Speaking, UCLES joined forces with the BBC. However, in the BBC recording booths, there was tension between the BBC&#x27;s approach, which focused on dramatic potential, and UCLES&#x27; need for clarity of speech. For example, a man abseiling down a mountain was highly entertaining but unacceptable for test purposes. It was finally agreed that at least 35% of listening tests would comprise an original BBC recording, largely made up of programmes from World Service and &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; broadcasts.

===IELTS===
With learners increasingly requiring English language certification for their studies, UCLES, along with the British Council and the Australian International Development Programme (IDP), developed a test in the 1980s which focused specifically on English for academic purposes.

An English Language Testing Service (ELTS) test was first launched in 1980 with tasks based on language use in academic and occupational contexts in the &quot;real world&quot;. However, the ELTS test was very complex to administer and only two full versions were ever produced.

In 1989, a simplified and shortened test became operational under a new name: the International English Language Testing System (IELTS).

It was clear that different forms of the test would need to be equated. All IELTS materials were therefore pretested and calibrated to a common scale on the basis of the Rasch model. This was the first time that UCLES had used the Rasch model, which now forms the cornerstone of the level testing system.

===RSA and teaching qualifications===
In 1988, the EFL exams developed by The Royal Society of Arts (RSA) Examination Board were merged with those of UCLES. The RSA Examination Board had been established in 1754, long before UCLES, and by taking over the RSA TEFL schemes UCLES became responsible for &quot;the running of the world&#x27;s most respected and widely recognised schemes for validating training courses for teachers of English as a Foreign Language.&quot;

The two sets of qualifications were integrated and syllabuses for the revised qualifications were developed in consultation with the ESL sector, in order to re-integrate the ESL and EFL teacher communities. In 1999 the RSA Certificate in Teaching English as a Foreign Language to Adults (CTEFLA) and the RSA Diploma in Teaching English as a Foreign Language to Adults officially became known as the CELTA and DELTA qualifications. These qualifications were joined in 2004 by ICELT (a revised version of its predecessor, COTE) – which is a purely in-service professional qualification.

At the start of the 21st century, there was growing demand from government ministries and schools for a professional qualification without any in-service (teaching practice) component. This led to the introduction of the Teaching Knowledge Test (TKT), which focuses solely on core professional knowledge. Following consultations with worldwide teacher training institutions and trials with 1,500 English language teachers in Europe, Latin America and Asia, TKT went live in 2005. In the first six months thousands of candidates sat the test in 36 different countries. It was also incorporated into government plans, e.g. plans in Chile to retrain all in-service teachers, and was incorporated into state university teacher training programmes.

===China and Business English===
The early 1990s saw China developing its market economy very rapidly. Recognising the importance of English as a language of international business and trade, the Chinese government asked Cambridge Assessment English to develop a suite of Business English Certificates (BEC).

BEC Preliminary (now known as B1 Business Preliminary) examinations were first taken in 1993 by 5,000 candidates from seven cities across China. BEC Vantage (now known as B2 Business Vantage) was launched in 1994 and BEC Higher (now known as C1 Business Higher) in 1996. This was followed in 1997 by the launch of the Business Language Testing Service (BULATS) for companies.

===Young Learners===
In the 1990s, there was growing demand from Cambridge English centres in the Far East, Latin America and Europe for assessments designed specifically for younger learners. At the time, relatively little research had been carried out into the assessment of second language learning in children.

UCLES worked with Homerton College (a teacher training college within the University of Cambridge) to trial test questions with over 3,000 children in Europe, South America and South East Asia. The feedback was used to construct the first Young Learners English (YLE) tests, targeted at learners aged 6–12, which went live in 1997.

The YLE tests introduced a new level. The addition of the &#x27;breakthrough&#x27; level created a six-level system that was mirrored by the CEFR, published in 2001.

===Candidates===
In 1988, with just two established exams (B2 First and C2 Proficiency), exam candidature was around 180,000. By 2002, with a more comprehensive range of exams, the exam candidature was over 1 million; by 2007, it was over 2 million, by 2013, it was over 4 million; and by 2017, it was over 5.5 million.

===The Cambridge English Scale===
In January 2015, a new way of reporting results was introduced – the Cambridge English Scale. The scale aims to provide exam users with more information about their exam performance.

Candidates get more detailed results – receiving an overall score and a score for each skill/paper. In addition, the Cambridge English Scale makes it easier to see the progression and compare performance across different Cambridge English exams.

B2 First, C1 Advanced and C2 Proficiency have reported results on the Cambridge English Scale since January 2015. A2 Key and A2 Key for Schools, B1 Preliminary and B1 Preliminary for Schools and Business Certificates have reported results on the scale since February 2016.

<text>The Mercedes-Benz Citaro is a single-decker, rigid or articulated bus manufactured by Mercedes-Benz/EvoBus. Introduced in 1997, the Citaro is available in a range of configurations, and is in widespread use throughout Europe and parts of Asia, with more than 55,000 produced by December 2019.

==History==

The first generation Citaro was launched in 1997, as a successor to the Mercedes-Benz O405.

In 2005, an updated version of the Citaro to coincide with the introduction of Euro IV- (and later Euro V- and EEV-) compliant engines. Apart from minor technical alterations, mainly to accommodate the new generation of engines, the external design received a facelift to give the buses a less angular look, with internal panelling altered accordingly. Production of the old model ceased by autumn 2006.

In 2006 the Citaro received a much more substantial facelift, which can be seen from the outside by a revised front and rear design (analogous to the recently introduced low-entry buses). The hitherto characteristic feature of the first series, the &quot;washboard trim&quot; on the front of the vehicle, which was also available as a front advertising area and smooth surface without Mercedes star, accounted for a somewhat rounded front baffle. The lateral sweep of the front turn signals was reversed.

In May 2011, the second generation Citaro, referred to internally as the C2, was launched. From 2012, the C2 could also be equipped with Euro 6 engines. The C2 versions of the Citaro LE models were the last to be presented, at Busworld Kortrijk in October 2013.

==Models==

There are three basic versions of the Citaro available in 2019: The standard 12m Citaro, the shorter 10m Citaro K and the articulated 18m Citaro G. Hybrid versions of all three lengths and one full electric version with standard and articulated versions are also available.

===Specifications===

Operators are able to choose between two different front stylings: the standard design features an angled destination display, like a roof dome, and is primarily marketed for urban buses, while a version with a one-piece windscreen covering the destination display also is available and is primarily intended for interurban use. However, all models are available with either version.

With the introduction of second generation Citaro, the front destination display was slightly enlarged, which juts a bit out of the vehicle roof. As a result, Mercedes-Benz designed a small fairing at both sides of destination display. This fairing is available on all models by default. Later, after the introduction of Euro VI version, which results a complete structural change in engine compartment, also the rear destination display was enlarged and added with a fairing. However, afterwards, customers are also able to order a front display without fairing, whether urban or interurban versions.

Other customizations include the number and type of doors as well as the interior layout. Two types of seats are offered as part of the standard range, again with a basic model for urban use and an enhanced version for longer-distance routes, although both also are available on all models.

Aside from the usual diesel engines, the Citaro is also available with a powerful Euro VI natural gas engine M936G rated by 222 kW. It can be optionally combined with the new hybrid system of Mercedes-Benz, which helps to save more fuel and lower emissions.

===Non-standard bodies===

As a one-off, German operators üstra of Hanover and LVB of Leipzig took delivery of a batch of Citaros bodied to a special design by James Irvine for Expo 2000. Leipzig&#x27;s vehicles were lent to Hanover for the duration of the exhibition, but subsequently returned to normal service in their home city. All other Citaros bodied by Mercedes-Benz were to standard designs, however a number of chassis were bodied by independent manufacturers, most notably Hess of Switzerland. However, the Citaro has more recently only been sold as a complete product.

In 2007 the workshops of the Szeged (Hungary) bus operator SZKT converted a regular Citaro to a trolleybus. As of April 2010, five such buses are already serving as a trolley and more examples are in preparation in the near future.

In 2009, the Centre of Ambulance Services in Dubai took delivery of three Citaros, which had been modified to become the world&#x27;s largest ambulances.

In 2010, the French city Rennes ordered a longer version of the Citaro, the Citaro M, which is 13 meters long with an urban arrangement. 15 vehicles were built over the chassis of the Setra S416NF.

===Hydrogen fuel cell version===
Even though the usual Citaro models are powered by diesel or natural gas, there is also a hydrogen fuel cell-powered version, designated &quot;Citaro BZ&quot; or &quot;O530BZ&quot; (BZ stands for &quot;Brennstoffzelle&quot; in German, or &quot;fuel cell&quot; in English). During the combustion process, only water steam are produced, so the vehicle is very environmentally friendly. The hydrogen tanks are located in the roof, which results an increased vehicle height at . These buses have 3 doors, low floor configurations, and are capable for a top speed of . About 35 of these buses have been in service in a variety of different world cities in order to test the feasibility of hydrogen fuel cells in numerous countries or continents (including UK, Australia and China), different operating circumstances and different conditions, especially weather conditions.

===Hybrid electric version===
The Mercedes-Benz Citaro G BlueTec Hybrid is a series-hybrid articulated bus with a compact 450 kg, 4-cylinder, 4.8-litre, 160 kW, Euro 4 OM-924LA diesel engine providing power for a roof-mounted 19.4 kWh lithium-ion battery pack, and four 80 kW electric wheel hub motors located on the centre and rear axles. (Contrast a conventional bus diesel engine: 6-cylinder, 12-litre, 1,000 kg.) The battery pack is also charged by regenerative braking (recuperation). The manufacturer anticipates fuel consumption 20% lower than conventional diesel Citaros.
 In 2010, selected bendy buses were delivered in hybrid version to Wuppertal, Stuttgart, Krefeld, Hamburg and Mülheim. Other buses were also delivered to Essen, Duisburg, Munich, Mainz, Hamburg and Rostock are also in the rigid versions. The Dresden and Leipzig also delivered their Citaro hybrid buses in 2011.

Eventually, Daimler decided to not to upgrade &quot;BlueTec Hybrid&quot; variants to second generation of Citaro. Instead, in 2017, they launched Citaro Hybrid variants of Citaro (diesel) and NGT, which uses mild hybrid drive, much cheaper to manufacture than &quot;BlueTec Hybrid&quot; drive. It uses 14 kW, disc-shaped electric motor mounted between combustion engine and transmission for energy recuperation and can provide a torque of up to 220 Nm.

=== Battery version / eCitaro ===

Since 2015, Aachen Transport runs a battery-powered Citaro articulated bus as a test in scheduled operation. The vehicle was converted in 2014 from a hybrid bus to a battery bus. They removed all diesel components and installed 1300 traction batteries with a total capacity of approximately 180 kWh. The axle loads remained unchanged. The vehicle has four wheel hub motors with 60 kW continuous power on the second and third axle and has a range of more than . The conversion was carried out as part of the EU project Civitas (Cleaner and better transport in cities) and was funded by the Aachen Transport Association to 75 percent. The costs for the hardware (e.g. batteries) amounted to approximately 700,000 euros.

Mercedes-Benz tested prototypes of the Citaro with full electric drive. The bus features a modular battery pack design and use the same electric wheel hub motors as the Citaro G BlueTec Hybrid. It was launched at the IAA Commercial Vehicles show in Hanover in September 2018 as eCitaro. It uses modified bodywork of standard Citaro with front adopted from Daimler&#x27;s concept &quot;Future Bus&quot;. It was first launched as 12 m solo bus. Later, an articulated 18 m version of eCitaro (also known as eCitaro G) was added to offer.
On 15 November 2018, the first series of eCitaro was delivered to its first customer: Hochbahn AG, a public transport company in Hamburg, with a total of 20 at last. In year 2019, more customers started operating eCitaros, including Rhein-Neckar-Verkehr GmbH (RNV), Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG), Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe (ZVB), and Bus Ostschweiz (BOS). This was also followed with orders from Verkehrsbetriebe Hamburg-Holstein (VHH) with 16 buses, ESWE Verkehrsgesellschaft mbH from Wiesbaden with 56, and ÜSTRA from Hannover with 48. Mercedes-Benz also received orders from foreign countries, which contains Luxembourg, Norway, and Sweden. In addition, the eCitaro has been crowned to City Bus of the Year 2019 in Spain on 11 February 2019. In 2021, the national bus operator of Hungary, Volánbusz ordered 40 eCitaros, and in 2023, Transdev Blazefield in the United Kingdom ordered 35 eCitaros for their Harrogate Bus Company and Keighley Bus Company subsidiaries, the first 20 of which entered service with the former in November 2024.

In 2023, a version with a Toyota hydrogen fuel cell range extender will be offered, allowing a range of up to , compared to for the battery electric model.

On 15 September 2024, Mercedes-Benz launched a shorter 10.63-meter version at the IAA Commercial Vehicles show in Hanover. Called the eCitaro K, it featured a 4,398 mm wheelbase and a turning radius of just 17.28 meters, making it suitable for busy city routes. The eCitaro K is powered by a five high-voltage battery packs with a combined capacity of 491 kWh and delivers a range of 300 km under optimal conditions.

=== Overhead wire version ===

Because EvoBus itself does not offer trolleybuses, the transport companies of the Hungarian city of Szeged independently built six second-hand Citaro solo vehicles into trolleybuses between 2006 and 2010. This is expected to save on spare parts inventory - this can be done together with the same diesel buses of the dispenser series - as well as lower acquisition costs compared to standard production trolleybuses. The modified type designation is O-530 Tr12, the six wagons bear the operating numbers T-860 to T-865.

In 2012, two Citaro trolleybuses also went into operation in Polish Gdynia. The cars with the numbers 3053 and 3054 originated from used acquired diesel buses from Berlin, which had been delivered in 2002.

==CapaCity==
Mercedes-Benz CapaCity (also known as O530 GL) is a large-capacity articulated bus based on Citaro G, which was introduced in year 2007. The 1st generation CapaCity is 19.54m long and can carry up to 186 passengers. It features exactly the same turning circle as that of its shorter related Citaro G (17.94m length) thanks actively steered electro hydraulic fourth axle. The safety is guaranteed by Electronic Braking System (EBS), anti-lock brakes (ABS), acceleration skid control (ASR), and the passenger comfort is improved by independent front suspensions. It is both available with 3 and 4 doors. There are also CapaCitys with BRT-Design, which can be recognized by their changed exterior. These buses are currently in service in Istanbul, Turkey, and Bratislava, Slovakia.

The 2nd generation CapaCity was first presented in year 2014. However, it is the long version &quot;CapaCity L&quot; (21m) which became available at the beginning. The shorter version &quot;CapaCity&quot; with a length of 19.7m was added later. They are all based on the modular system of Mercedes-Benz Citaro. The new feature &quot;Articulation Turntable Controller&quot; (ATC) prevents additionally from jackknifing. CapaCity L can carry 191 passengers with standard equipment, CapaCity 182 passengers. They are offered with four doors by default, but with &quot;Metro Package&quot;, CapaCity L is also available with five doors, which is better constructed for BRT services. According to Daimler, CapaCity L is the diesel powered urban bus which uses the least fuel per passenger space.
==Conecto==

In year 2007, the 2nd generation Conecto was presented and is both available as standard 12m and articulated 18m version. They are however only available with 3 doors (solo version) and 4 doors (articulated version). Unlike its predecessor as an independent model series (a step-entrance bus derived from O405, model designation O345), it is a technically simplified version of Citaro or Citaro G, with low floor configuration and vertical engines. It is recognizable with the changed exterior design and small differences in interior&#x27;s design in opposition to Citaro and is mainly sold in eastern Europe, the Middle East and west Asia. The 3rd generation is, since 2018, also sold in Italy (when low-floor Conecto was never officially sold before).

Like previous step-entrance Conecto models, the low-floor Conecto is also produced at Mercedes-Benz Türk factory in Istanbul, Turkey.

In September 2016, the 3rd generation Conecto was presented in Warsaw, Poland. Several improvements were done for the new Conecto, as well as driving safety, passenger comfort, handling and Euro 6 engines, while the operation costs still stay low. Examples for high standard of safety are Electronic Stability Program (ESP) on solo versions and Articulation Turntable Controller (ATC) on articulated versions. Conecto and Conecto G NGT powered by natural gas are also available for the first time. Like the 2nd generation, the 3rd generation Conecto is solely available with 3 doors (solo version) and 4 doors (articulated version). In 3rd generation Conecto, only Euro VI-compliant engines are available (OM936 in 12 m, OM470 in 18 m and M936G in gas versions); the 2nd generation Conecto, with Euro V-compliant engines (OM926LA in 12 m and OM457LA in 18 m models), continues to be marketed in certain non-EU developing markets in eastern Europe, the Middle East and west Asia, alongside the 3rd generation Conecto.

==Production==
The Citaro is currently built in factories in Mannheim, Germany, and Ligny-en-Barrois, France. It was also built in Sámano in Spain.

The low-cost-variant Conecto is produced by Mercedes-Benz Türk A.Ş. in Hoşdere, Başakşehir, Istanbul, Turkey.

====Portugal====
In 2000, Companhia de Carris de Ferro de Lisboa (CCFL) acquired 39 diesel variants of the Citaro, with 3 doors, ZF 5HP502 and OM457hla chassis and, later that year, Sociedade de Transportes Colectivos do Porto (STCP) bought 75 bodywork-based Citaros, with Salvador Caetano CityGold bodywork, OM906hla chassis and Voith D851.3 gearbox, the only series in the world with a 3-speed gearbox. Afterwards, Transportes Colectivos do Barreiro (TCB) and Serviços Municipalizados dos Transportes Urbanos de Coimbra (SMTUC) purchased (since 2001) this model, the case of the first one between the Euro 2, Euro 3, Euro 4 and the Facelift versions, and the second company just the Euro 2 and Euro 3 variants. Both companies also acquired used Citaros, with TCB purchasing four ex-De Lijn vehicles with Euro 3 and SMTUC with a 1997 ex-Hochbahn Citaro (previously owned by Linhares, and also the first used Citaro to Portugal), four ex-Nobina with 3-door and anti-fire system (one already out due to fire) and one with vertical engine, originally a temporary bus, but since 2021 as theirs. In 2022, three Citaro Facelift, originated from TCB after staying out of service for a few years, along with five Volvo B7RLE with Marcopolo Viale Midi buses, both vehicle types from 2009, were purchased for additional service in Coimbra. These vehicles were bought with money originally used to buy a private vehicle for the city council, and they came in a very good condition, although their Voith gearbox have their reatrders always set off, since TCB did disable those on their buses with Voith.
Besides the ex-Hochbahn Citaro in Linhares, Rodoviária de Lisboa purchased the Uberland variant of the Citaro, being the second vehicle as second hand purchase.
In 2004, STCP tested three Citaro Fuel Cell models for two years, part of the CUTE project for the hydrogen tests through some European countries. Along with those, three Euro 3 Citaros were offered to the company to complement the Fuel Cell tests. One of the hydrogen buses is saved as part of a possible museum (this one has its engine removed) and two of the Citaros are still in circulation (one of them was burned down caused by the engine in December 2016). Since 2008, CCFL purchased the articulated variant of the Citaro Facelift (Citaro G) in two gearbox segments: Voith Diwa 5 and ZF EcoLife. These ones allowed to replace the older Volvo B10M articulated buses from 1991 through 1993 (20 at 2008 and 30 at 2010). In 2010, Empresa de Transportes Gondomarense bought five Citaro K (midi variant) for bus lines with small numbers of passengers. Since then, various Citaro models were second hand buses from Spain and Germany, mostly. In 2018, part of the PO-SEUR project from the Portuguese Government, CCFL acquired 40 Citaro C2G NGT (natural gas) buses to replace the 1995 and 1997 Volvo B10M articulated buses, along with 125 CaetanoBus bodied MAN 18.310 CNG. Besides these ones, Scotturb also acquired 1+20 Citaro C2K, 10 of them are hybrid, for the Circuito da Pena line. This is also from the time when second hand Citaro C2 are put in circulation, like in Rodoviária de Lisboa having 2013 C2 ex-Dr. Richard, from Vienna. In 2022, Área Metropolitana de Lisboa (AML) offered 633 Conectos, 157 Intouros and 50 Citaros (all with Euro 6 engines and Voith Diwa 6 gearbox). Maia transportes, an operator based in Portuguese city, Maia, in Porto, also bought some citaros second handed from Germany. Maia transportes also has 2 ex-Rodoviaria de Lisboa Citaro&#x27;s Ü.

Malta

In 2011, Arriva Malta received 81 ex-London Citaro C1 for service on busy urban routes and semi-express routes, these only ran for just about two years though, as the Government of Malta instructed the then operator to retire the bendy buses from service. In early 2015, the new operator Malta Public Transport loaned 25 ex-Heathrow airside Citaro C1 facelifts for use as city buses from Dawson Group. In early 2020, these buses were taken out of service due to demanded fleet reduction because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nowadays, ten of these buses are being used as driver trainers, some returned to the UK, and others are being used as school buses in Cyprus

====Italy====


In 2001, ATAC of Rome ordered 183 Citaro MU interurban model with a blue livery and two doors. This was followed by 301 Citaros urban and suburban model in the normal ATAC grey livery with 2 and 3 doors, in 2004. They operate on many routes, including 63, 88, 98, 443, 559, 775 and 881 and many lines around Ostia. ATAC have also introduced 100 new Citaro C2 Hybrid 12m buses entering service in June 2021.

This was followed by a batch of 2 Citaro G Hybrid in 2011 (2590 and 2591), only allocated to route 94, as well as 3 Citaro Hydrogen 12m in 2012 (2000 to 2002), allocated to route 84. More Citaros (C2 Hybrid 12m) are currently being delivered to Milan.

In 2008, ANM of Naples took delivery of 44 gas powered Citaro Facelift CNG 12m TPLITALIA.IT. These currently run on routes R2 and 151, but can often be seen on other routes operated from the Via delle Puglie depot (such as 601 and R5). Previously, some of these were branded for the ALIBUS route (Airport to City Centre) route until late 2018, when they got displaced by a new fleet of MenariniBus Citymood 10m buses. The buses were supplied by a regional order by Campania which included a total of 58 buses being ordered. The other 14 went to BusItalia of Salerno (at the time CSTP), fleet numbered CITA01-CITA14 TPLITALIA.IT. Once again by a regional order, a further 20 Citaro K C2 Euro 6 were delivered to Naples, fleet numbered N201 to N220.

Citaros are also operated in Venice (ACTV), Trieste (Trieste Trasporti), Cagliari (CTM and ARST) and Bologna (TPER), among other cities. Some of these companies also run Citaro U interurban buses.

In 2007, Thessaloniki local bus operator OASTH introduced 28 Citaro G buses, with 14 more coming in 2012. In 2009, a 12-meter Citaro was ordered for the cultural route of Thessaloniki. It is equipped with screens that display information about landmarks and comes with a microphone for the tour guide to speak. The citaro is also widely used in other cities of Greece. From 2020 to 2023 both Athens and Thessaloniki have rented used Citaro buses from PAPADAKIS BROS S.A. that were previously owned by several European bus operators including Connexxion, Qbuzz, BVG and more.

====United Kingdom====
=====London=====

Right-hand drive versions of the articulated Citaro G were introduced in London on 2 June 2002, on routes 507 and 521. They were eventually used on 12 routes across London, and were operated by various Transport for London operators including East London, First London, London Central, London General and Selkent.

In 2003 and 2004, four Citaro Gs caught fire, although there were no casualties involved. One was burnt on its delivery journey. Mercedes-Benz did address the problem, though the buses were withdrawn for some time which the saw the brief return of the just-retired AEC Routemasters. Unfortunately, the fires are said to have marred the reputation of articulated buses in the United Kingdom, and some people nicknaming them &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;. The final Citaro G in London was withdrawn in December 2011. Eighty-one of Arriva London&#x27;s examples were exported for use with Arriva Malta.

The first Citaros in London were 12 rigids introduced by First London on 27 April 2002 on route RV1. Others purchasers of rigids were London General for routes 507 and 521 in 2008, and Quality Line for routes X26 in 2011 and 413 in 2016.

=====Rest of the UK=====
Many of the former London Citaro Gs saw further service with various Arriva, FirstGroup, Go-Ahead Group, National Express and Stagecoach Group fleets outside of London.

===Asia===

====China====
In 2006, three hydrogen fuel cell-powered Citaros began trial operations in Beijing, China. They ran on an long circular line, which contains 11 stations and uses Summer Palace North Gate as departure/terminal station. The operating hours ranged from 9am to 3pm with a frequency of every 40 minutes. During the trial, these Citaros left a very positive impression on passengers.

====Japan====
In 2010, Keisei Bus ordered 15 articulated O530G Citaro G buses, primarily for service in east Tokyo.

Nishitetsu also operates several O530G Citaro G buses on the Fukuoka BRT.

====Singapore====
SMRT Buses trialed a Euro V demonstrator unit in 2010, which proved to be successful The trial bus was registered SMB136C and kept by SMRT after the trial concluded. As of January 2025, SMB136C serves as a training bus under SMRT&#x27;s Woodlands Depot. An additional 10 buses were purchased with a follow-up order of another 40. These buses were registered SMB139U - SMB188C, with slightly different specifications from that of SMB136C.

In 2010, SBS Transit had made an initial purchase of 300 buses to replace several of the remaining Volvo B10M Mark III, as well as a few Volvo B10M Mark IV (Duple Metsec and Walter Alexander Strider). Additional orders were being made to replace all Volvo B10Ms, with another order of 450 (increased to 474) in 2012 and a further 250 (increased to 330) in 2014. SBS Transit technical and interior specifications are quite different from that of SMRT Buses.

By 2017, a grand total of 1,155 Mercedes-Benz O530 Citaro buses have been registered under SBS Transit, SMRT Buses, Land Transport Authority’s Bus Services Enhancement Programme (BSEP) and Bus Contracting Model (BCM). Almost all public bus routes utilise O530 Citaros, with all public bus operators (including SMRT Buses) operating Citaros built to SBS Transit specifications.

In 2022, SBS Transit had redeployed several Ulu Pandan Bus Depot MAN NL323F (A22) buses and Mercedes-Benz O530 Citaro buses to replace Scania K230UB (Euro IV) buses on cross-border bus routes (160, 170 and 170X), which are the last diesel single-deck buses to use in Singapore. Those allocated under the Bus Contracting Model were redeployed to SBS Transit.

In March 2020, SBS Transit introduced a Mercedes-Benz O530 Citaro C2 hybrid, registered as SG4004B as part of a 1-year trial and transition to sustainable transport. It was deployed only on routes 93 and 272, and was returned to Mercedes-Benz in 2021, which is due to the subsequent transition to the electric Citaro fleet in the future. SG4004B was eventually exported to the United Kingdom in December 2023.

**** Supercritical fluid chromatography, a form of liquid chromatography using supercritical carbon dioxide as the mobile phase
***Supercritical water:
**** Supercritical steam generator, a steam generator operating above the critical point of water, hence having no water–steam separation
**** Supercritical water oxidation or SCWO, a process that occurs in water at temperatures and pressures above a mixture&#x27;s thermodynamic critical point
**** Supercritical water reactor (SCWR), a Generation IV nuclear reactor concept that uses supercritical water as the working fluid

===Flows===
* Supercritical flow, where flow velocity is larger than wave velocity
** Supercritical airfoil, an airfoil designed to delay the onset of wave drag in the transonic speed regime

===Nuclear physics===
* Supercritical mass, an amount of fissile material that will undergo a sustained nuclear chain reaction at an increasing rate

==Mathematics==
* Hopf bifurcation, in mathematics, a local bifurcation; when the first Lyapunov coefficient is negative, the bifurcation is called supercritical

<doc id="1221896" wikidata="Q6961945" url="?curid=1221896" title="Namli Mera Union Council">
<text>Namli Mera is a residential town and a mountainous rural area located in Abbottabad District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistan. Many outstanding families also belongs to Namli Mera . More over the kpk&#x27;s No1 physics teacher for the year (2024), Dr. Yaseen Akhtar also belongs to Namli Mera. 

It is one of the 51 union councils of Abbottabad District, and takes its name from the two largest hamlets in the Union Council, Namli and Mera. Its capital is New kalwan city . These settlements are nestled on mountain ridges about 20 kilometres from the city of Abbottabad, in the foothills of Miranjani, the highest peak in the district. A metalled road connects Namli Mera to the main Abbottabad—Nathia Gali road and is an alternate route to reach Nathia Gali from Abbottabad. Namli Mera is around 3 kilometres away Bagnotar on the main road.

== Climate and crops ==
Being at a high altitude, this region hosts extreme winters (starting October) and a temperate and slightly humid summer (April onwards) which temperatures reaching 30C. July and August also see the monsoon which cause a pleasant drop in temperature.

Farming is the main occupation of the population. The farming is done by oxen in remote areas but in villages with better accessibility the land is ploughed by machinery. The two crops grown there are rabi and Kharif crop. The major rabi crops grown in the area are potato and maize, and the kharif crop is only wheat, in a very small area of village. The wheat is used for cattle and for grain only. Some vegetables are also found here, including turnip, radish, peas, pumpkin, beans and mustard.

Fruits like pear, apple, black grapes, grapes, fig, peach, damson plum, mulberry, wild fig, lemon, apricot, charry are found in abundance in Namli Mera. As the hill people lack awareness of the markets, they are unable to get a proper return. These fruits are therefore used for subsistence.

Most of the area around these mountain villages is covered with trees. Peaks are covered with evergreen trees including pine, walnut, oak and maple trees. Herbs, shrubs, wild flowers and thorny bushes can be seen in abundance. Goats and other pet animals graze the pastures.

==Livelihood and economy==
The main occupation of the people is subsistence farming and cattle breeding. Farmers cultivate one crop per season as climatic conditions do not permit double cropping. The other occupation is cattle breeding. Cows, sheep and goats are kept to supply milk for daily use of the household. Bullocks are used to work the plough. Poverty has forced many people to seek economic opportunities in the plains. Besides earning livelihood doing jobs in nearby towns, many have joined the army and civil service. Hotels in the nearby hill towns of Nathia Gali, Ayubia and Murree provide another source of employment to the locals. After turmoil in Swat, Namli Mera is gradually becoming popular with tourists from down country.

Wood is the primary source of fuel and home construction, as there is no gas in Namli Mera. People go to forests and cut trees so that they can light fires for cooking and other activities. Those who can afford them use LPG gas cylinders.

==People==
The population of Namli Mera is Muslim, belonging to the Sunni sect. About 90% belong to the Karlal (Sardar) tribe. Other tribes in this area include Turks, Awan, Abbasi and a handful of Mughals.

The mother language of the people of Namli Mera is Pahari پہاڑی, which is slightly different from Pothwari. Locals also speak and understand Hindko, Urdu, Pashto and English. The elderly people of the area can also speak and understand Persian and Arabic.

== Education ==
Namli Mera village has one of the highest literacy rates for the district. The literacy rate of Namli Mera is about 92%. But some says its 99.99%. Government and private schools cater to the elementary educational needs of the residents. There are Primary schools for boys and girls, Government Boys High School and Girls High School. A number of private schools are also available. Habib Public School, Abaseen Public School, Model Public School are the oldest and famous school of the village. Al-falah Public School in Chanati and Iqra Public School in Upper Mera Kalan are the other private schools.

== Tourism ==
Since the earthquake of 2005 tourists prefer Nathi Gali and surrounding areas like Namli Mera, Kala Bagh, Thandiani and Mushkpuri. The approach to Namli Mera is the same from Murree and Abbottabad (32 km from either side). Miranjani (also known as &quot;Choki&quot;) is one of the most popular sites of Namli Mera. Mirajani stands approximately 9,000 feet above sea level. There is an old track adjacent to Mirajani which connects Nathia Gali to Thandiani. Along the track lies a British-era forest rest house, called Dagri Bangla by the locals. The location of the building, in the middle of thick forest, colonial style of construction and remoteness give it an aura of mystery.

==2005 earthquake==
On 8 October 2005, an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck the northern areas and Kashmir, causing significant damage to housing and a large number of deaths. Aftershocks were felt through December.

<text>Walter Richard Pollock Hamilton VC (18 August 1856 – 3 September 1879) was born in Inistioge, County Kilkenny and was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He is featured in M. M. Kaye&#x27;s epic novel &quot;The Far Pavilions&quot;.

==Details==
Hamilton was a great nephew of General Sir George Pollock who led the Army of Retribution in the First Afghan War. He was educated at Felsted. Hamilton was 22 years old, and a lieutenant in the Staff Corps and Corps of Guides, Indian Army during the Second Afghan War when the following deed took place on 2 April 1879 at Futtehabad, Afghanistan, 
for which he was awarded the VC:
The scene of Hamilton&#x27;s death was the Bala Hissar, an enclosure within the city of Kabul. He commanded a small force of 20 Cavalry and 50 Infantry, all from the Corps of Guides, which formed an escort for Sir Louis Cavagnari the Envoy who was to set up the Residency in Kabul following the Treaty of Gandamak. After a riot by mutinous Afghan troops, who were demanding arrears of pay, the Residency was attacked on 3 September 1879. Fierce fighting took place between the Guides and the attackers, during which Cavagnari and all the Guides were killed.

On 15 May 1879, six weeks after the action at Futtehabad, the Government in India forwarded a Victoria Cross recommendation for Hamilton to London which on 6 August determined that his act was not covered by the Victoria Cross regulations. There was a change of heart when the Secretary of State for India, Lord Cranbrook, noted that Hamilton&#x27;s actions were similar to those of Captain John Cook and Lieutenant Reginald Hart who had both been awarded the Victoria Cross two months earlier. By this stage Hamilton had been killed at Kabul on 3 September and in order to avoid the precedent of seeming to approve a posthumous award the submission to the Queen on 28 September was backdated to 1 September 1879. The award was gazetted on 7 October 1879, the 12th Victoria Cross recommendation approved after the death of the recipient.

==Memorials==

A slightly over-life-size statue of Hamilton striding over an Afghan threatening him with a knife was produced in bronze-painted plaster by Charles Bell Birch in Dublin in around 1880. It is now on display in the National Army Museum, Chelsea, as is a plaque to him (set up in the Punjab Frontier Force Chapel, then in the sanctum crypt of St. Lukes Chapel, Chelsea).

==In the media==

Walter Hamilton is a character in the novel &quot;The Far Pavilions&quot;, in the HBO-miniseries adaption he was portrayed by Benedict Taylor.

<doc id="1221919" wikidata="Q1632301" url="?curid=1221919" title="Sturm's theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Sturm sequence of a univariate polynomial is a sequence of polynomials associated with and its derivative by a variant of Euclid&#x27;s algorithm for polynomials. Sturm&#x27;s theorem expresses the number of distinct real roots of located in an interval in terms of the number of changes of signs of the values of the Sturm sequence at the bounds of the interval. Applied to the interval of all the real numbers, it gives the total number of real roots of .

Whereas the fundamental theorem of algebra readily yields the overall number of complex roots, counted with multiplicity, it does not provide a procedure for calculating them. Sturm&#x27;s theorem counts the number of distinct real roots and locates them in intervals. By subdividing the intervals containing some roots, it can isolate the roots into arbitrarily small intervals, each containing exactly one root. This yields the oldest real-root isolation algorithm, and arbitrary-precision root-finding algorithm for univariate polynomials.

For computing over the reals, Sturm&#x27;s theorem is less efficient than other methods based on Descartes&#x27; rule of signs. However, it works on every real closed field, and, therefore, remains fundamental for the theoretical study of the computational complexity of decidability and quantifier elimination in the first order theory of real numbers.

The Sturm sequence and Sturm&#x27;s theorem are named after Jacques Charles François Sturm, who discovered the theorem in 1829.

==The theorem==
The Sturm chain or Sturm sequence of a univariate polynomial with real coefficients is the sequence of polynomials formula_1 such that 
:formula_2
for , where is the derivative of , and formula_3 is the remainder of the Euclidean division of formula_4 by formula_5 The length of the Sturm sequence is at most the degree of .

The number of sign variations at of the Sturm sequence of is the number of sign changes (ignoring zeros) in the sequence of real numbers
:formula_6
This number of sign variations is denoted here . 

Sturm&#x27;s theorem states that, if is a square-free polynomial, the number of distinct real roots of in the half-open interval is (here, and are real numbers such that ).

The theorem extends to unbounded intervals by defining the sign at of a polynomial as the sign of its leading coefficient (that is, the coefficient of the term of highest degree). At the sign of a polynomial is the sign of its leading coefficient for a polynomial of even degree, and the opposite sign for a polynomial of odd degree.

In the case of a non-square-free polynomial, if neither nor is a multiple root of , then is the number of &quot;distinct&quot; real roots of .

The proof of the theorem is as follows: when the value of increases from to , it may pass through a zero of some formula_7 (); when this occurs, the number of sign variations of formula_8 does not change. When passes through a root of formula_9 the number of sign variations of formula_10 decreases from 1 to 0. These are the only values of where some sign may change.

==Example==
Suppose we wish to find the number of roots in some range for the polynomial formula_11. So

:formula_12

The remainder of the Euclidean division of by is formula_13 multiplying it by we obtain 
:formula_14. 
Next dividing by and multiplying the remainder by , we obtain 
:formula_15. 
Now dividing by and multiplying the remainder by , we obtain 
:formula_16.
As this is a constant, this finishes the computation of the Sturm sequence.

To find the number of real roots of formula_17 one has to evaluate the sequences of the signs of these polynomials at and , which are respectively and . Thus
:formula_18
where denotes the number of sign changes in the sequence, which shows that has two real roots.

This can be verified by noting that can be factored as , where the first factor has the roots and , and second factor has no real roots. This last assertion results from the quadratic formula, and also from Sturm&#x27;s theorem, which gives the sign sequences at and at .

==Generalization==
Sturm sequences have been generalized in two directions. To define each polynomial in the sequence, Sturm used the negative of the remainder of the Euclidean division of the two preceding ones. The theorem remains true if one replaces the negative of the remainder by its product or quotient by a positive constant or the square of a polynomial. It is also useful (see below) to consider sequences where the second polynomial is not the derivative of the first one.

A &quot;generalized Sturm sequence&quot; is a finite sequence of polynomials with real coefficients
:formula_19
such that
* the degrees are decreasing after the first one: formula_20 for ;
* formula_21 does not have any real root or has no sign changes near its real roots.
* if for and a real number, then .

The last condition implies that two consecutive polynomials do not have any common real root. In particular the original Sturm sequence is a generalized Sturm sequence, if (and only if) the polynomial has no multiple real root (otherwise the first two polynomials of its Sturm sequence have a common root).

When computing the original Sturm sequence by Euclidean division, it may happen that one encounters a polynomial that has a factor that is never negative, such a formula_22 or formula_23. In this case, if one continues the computation with the polynomial replaced by its quotient by the nonnegative factor, one gets a generalized Sturm sequence, which may also be used for computing the number of real roots, since the proof of Sturm&#x27;s theorem still applies (because of the third condition). This may sometimes simplify the computation, although it is generally difficult to find such nonnegative factors, except for even powers of .

==Use of pseudo-remainder sequences==
In computer algebra, the polynomials that are considered have integer coefficients or may be transformed to have integer coefficients. The Sturm sequence of a polynomial with integer coefficients generally contains polynomials whose coefficients are not integers (see above example). 

To avoid computation with rational numbers, a common method is to replace Euclidean division by pseudo-division for computing polynomial greatest common divisors. This amounts to replacing the remainder sequence of the Euclidean algorithm by a pseudo-remainder sequence, a pseudo remainder sequence being a sequence formula_24 of polynomials such that there are constants formula_25 and formula_26 such that formula_27 is the remainder of the Euclidean division of formula_28 by formula_29 (The different kinds of pseudo-remainder sequences are defined by the choice of formula_25 and formula_31 typically, formula_25 is chosen for not introducing denominators during Euclidean division, and formula_26 is a common divisor of the coefficients of the resulting remainder; see Pseudo-remainder sequence for details.)
For example, the remainder sequence of the Euclidean algorithm is a pseudo-remainder sequence with formula_34 for every , and the Sturm sequence of a polynomial is a pseudo-remainder sequence with formula_35 and formula_36 for every .

Various pseudo-remainder sequences have been designed for computing greatest common divisors of polynomials with integer coefficients without introducing denominators (see Pseudo-remainder sequence). They can all be made generalized Sturm sequences by choosing the sign of the formula_26 to be the opposite of the sign of the formula_38 This allows the use of Sturm&#x27;s theorem with pseudo-remainder sequences.

==Root isolation==

For a polynomial with real coefficients, &quot;root isolation&quot; consists of finding, for each real root, an interval that contains this root, and no other roots. 

This is useful for root finding, allowing the selection of the root to be found and providing a good starting point for fast numerical algorithms such as Newton&#x27;s method; it is also useful for certifying the result, as if Newton&#x27;s method converge outside the interval one may immediately deduce that it converges to the wrong root.

Root isolation is also useful for computing with algebraic numbers. For computing with algebraic numbers, a common method is to represent them as a pair of a polynomial to which the algebraic number is a root, and an isolation interval. For example formula_39 may be unambiguously represented by formula_40

Sturm&#x27;s theorem provides a way for isolating real roots that is less efficient (for polynomials with integer coefficients) than other methods involving Descartes&#x27; rule of signs. However, it remains useful in some circumstances, mainly for theoretical purposes, for example for algorithms of real algebraic geometry that involve infinitesimals.

For isolating the real roots, one starts from an interval formula_41 containing all the real roots, or the roots of interest (often, typically in physical problems, only positive roots are interesting), and one computes formula_42 and formula_43 For defining this starting interval, one may use bounds on the size of the roots (see ). Then, one divides this interval in two, by choosing in the middle of formula_44 The computation of formula_45 provides the number of real roots in formula_46 and formula_47 and one may repeat the same operation on each subinterval. When one encounters, during this process an interval that does not contain any root, it may be suppressed from the list of intervals to consider. When one encounters an interval containing exactly one root, one may stop dividing it, as it is an isolation interval. The process stops eventually, when only isolating intervals remain. 

This isolating process may be used with any method for computing the number of real roots in an interval. Theoretical complexity analysis and practical experiences show that methods based on Descartes&#x27; rule of signs are more efficient. It follows that, nowadays, Sturm sequences are rarely used for root isolation.

==Application==
Generalized Sturm sequences allow counting the roots of a polynomial where another polynomial is positive (or negative), without computing these root explicitly. If one knows an isolating interval for a root of the first polynomial, this allows also finding the sign of the second polynomial at this particular root of the first polynomial, without computing a better approximation of the root.

Let and be two polynomials with real coefficients such that and have no common root and has no multiple roots. In other words, and are coprime polynomials. This restriction does not really affect the generality of what follows as GCD computations allows reducing the general case to this case, and the cost of the computation of a Sturm sequence is the same as that of a GCD. 

Let denote the number of sign variations at of a generalized Sturm sequence starting from and . If are two real numbers, then is the number of roots of in the interval formula_41 such that minus the number of roots in the same interval such that . Combined with the total number of roots of in the same interval given by Sturm&#x27;s theorem, this gives the number of roots of such that and the number of roots of such that .

<doc id="1221930" wikidata="Q5294306" url="?curid=1221930" title="Donald Garland">
<text>Flying Officer Donald Edward Garland, VC (28 June 1918 – 12 May 1940) was a bomber pilot in the Royal Air Force and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Born in Ballinacor, County Wicklow, Garland was the son of Dr. Patrick Joseph Garland, CMG. He was a pupil at Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School, Holland Park, London from 1929 to 1935, and left with a good all-round School Certificate.

After spending some time at an insurance office, he joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) on a short-term commission. Mgr. Canon J. Vance, who became headmaster of Cardinal Vaughan School in 1928: &quot;In those days I questioned young men closely before recommending their applications for short-term commissions because of a lurking fear that they might be forced to start life again at an awkward age, for Donald I had no misgivings whatever. He could start his life again at any time and was bound to succeed because of his independence and of his resourcefulness. I salute Garland&#x27;s great heroism&quot;

==Victoria Cross==
Garland was 21 years old, and a flying officer in No. 12 Squadron during the Second World War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 12 May 1940, over the Albert Canal, Belgium, two bridges, Veldwezelt and Vroenhoven, were being used by the invading army, with protection from fighter aircraft, anti-aircraft and machine-guns. The RAF was ordered to demolish one of these vital bridges, and five Fairey Battle bombers were despatched, with Flying Officer Garland leading the attack. They encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire, and the bridge was hit but not put out of commission. Garland and his navigator, Sergeant Thomas Gray, attacked the bridge at Veldwezelt. They died either crashing in the village of Lanaken or in the hospital in Maastricht, Netherlands. Only one bomber managed to return to base. Sergeant Gray was also awarded the VC for this action in a joint citation with Garland.
Garland is buried at the Heverlee War Cemetery in Leuven, Belgium.

Both Garland and Gray were awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously. Leading Aircraftman Reynolds, the third member of the crew, did not receive a medal because he was not in a &quot;decision making&quot; position. Garland&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Air Force Museum London, England.

He had three brothers, all of whom served with the RAF and also died on service:
* Pilot Officer Desmond William Garland – killed in Belgium on 5 June 1942 aged 27
* Flight Lieutenant John Cuthbert Garland – died on 28 February 1943 aged 32
* Flight Lieutenant Patrick James Garland – killed in Holland on 1 January 1945 aged 36

===Victoria Cross citation===
The announcement and accompanying citation for the decoration was published in supplement to the London Gazette on 11 June 1940, reading

==Memorials==
A Vickers VC-10 Serial &#x27;XR807&#x27; of 101 Squadron was named &#x27;Donald Garland VC &amp; Thomas Gray VC&#x27;.

During 2005, to mark its 90th anniversary, No.12 Squadron RAF flew a Tornado GR4 with Flying Officer Garland&#x27;s and Sgt Gray&#x27;s name painted under the cockpit as a mark of respect.

There is a monument on the bridge to the operation.

<doc id="1221949" wikidata="Q641228" url="?curid=1221949" title="Minden Hills">
<text>Minden Hills is a township in and the county seat of Haliburton County, Ontario, Canada. It is an amalgam of the townships of Snowdon, Lutterworth, Anson, Hindon and Minden. It is usually referred to as Minden, after its largest community.

The township was formed on January 1, 2001, by combining the townships of Lutterworth, Snowdon, Anson, Hindon and Minden.

==Communities==
The primary residential and commercial centre of the township is Minden, located just off Highway 35 ().

The township also includes the smaller communities of Blairhampton, Brady Lake, Buller, Carnarvon, Deep Bay, Dutch Line, Gelert, Hindon Hill (abandoned community), Howland, Ingoldsby, Irondale, Kilcoo Harbour, Lochlin, Lutterworth, Miners Bay, and Moore Falls.

===Minden===
Minden, named after a town in the North Rhine–Westphalia federal state in Germany, was first surveyed in 1858. Before that, the settlement was called Gull River. Settlers were first drawn to the region (via the Bobcaygeon Road, an original colonization road), because of its timber resources. The town lies on the banks of the Gull River and during the 19th and 20th centuries, loggers used the river to move timber to sawmills downstream.

Since the 1940s the town has become an increasingly popular summer destination given its close proximity to larger cities in southern Ontario. The population grows dramatically during the summer months as a result of tourism. The &quot;Minden Times&quot; and &quot;The Highlander&quot; are the local newspapers, and the local post office on Water St. serves residents with lock boxes and three rural routes.

The Minden Hills Cultural Centre is home to the Agnes Jamieson Gallery, named after Dr. Agnes Jamieson, the first female coroner in Ontario. The Gallery houses the largest known collection of André Lapine&#x27;s work. Both Lapine and Jamieson lived in Minden during part of their lives. The Cultural Centre is also home to the Minden Hills Museum, which includes seven heritage buildings, including a school, a blacksmith shop and a church. R.D. Lawrence Place, an interactive learning centre celebrating Canadian author Ron Lawrence, is also located here.

== History ==
=== 2013 flood ===
The Gull River flooded in April 2013, leading to a state of emergency declaration on April 20. By May 3, officials were predicting another two weeks of abnormally high water levels in the Trent-Severn Waterway system. The excess water that was held back in the reservoir lakes north of Minden was being slowly released and moved through the village so as not to cause increased damage. The use of the reservoir lakes north of Minden to collect water was necessary to avert a threat to the essential utilities of water, hydro and sewage treatment. However, it extended the flood damage area north throughout the entire Gull River Watershed. Many of the properties on those lakes were damaged.

Residents of the area were evacuated from their homes on short notice and remained out until mid-May. Claims by residents to the Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program totaled 1.8 million dollars by November 2013, in addition to an estimated 2.2 million dollars in insured claims. The township spent $370,000 on flood related costs.

=== 2017 flood ===
Residents of Minden Hills were again affected by flooding only four years after the massive flood of 2013. Watershed flooding was at its maximum capacity in the reservoir lakes of the Trent Severn Waterway only to be hit with 129 millimeters of rain in late April, increasing flood levels. A state of emergency was put into place on May 6, 2017, for the town of Minden Hills. The Gull River through Minden recorded 5 centimeters lower than the record 2013 flood. A new automated sandbag machine was purchased earlier in March, helping with handling sandbags at a much faster rate for flood relief, with close to 40,000 sandbags being filled by the end of the weekend. Provincial aid was provided after Reeve Brent Devolin had been in contact with Premier Kathleen Wynne. The Ontario Disaster Relief Assistance Program offered reimbursement for homeowners affected.

===2015 Pan Am Games===

Minden Wild Water Preserve was a venue of the 2015 Pan Am Games, hosting canoe events.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Minden Hills had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

== Local government ==

The town&#x27;s council includes a mayor, deputy mayor, councillor at large and four councillors elected on the basis of two for Ward 1 and one each for Wards 2 &amp; 3, who are elected to join the mayor at meetings of Minden Hills Council. The members of council elected in 2022 are:
* Mayor: Bob Carter
* Deputy Mayor: Lisa Schell
* Councillors:
** At Large: Tammy McKelvey
** Ward 1: Ivan Ingram
** Ward 1: Shirley Johanessen
** Ward 2: Pam Sayne
** Ward 3: Bob Sisson

==Transportation==

Ontario Highway 35 is the major throughfare passing to the east and connects Minden to neighbouring areas and beyond.

A Heliport servicing Minden Hospital is the only airport in Minden. The closest airport is south in Peterborough, Ontario.

==Services==

Minden Hospital provides local health needs, with more advance care to the south in Peterborough or to the north-west in Bracebridge, Ontario.

Ontario Provincial Police Haliburton Detachment is located in Minden.

Fire services is provided by Minden Hills Fire Department and ambulance by Haliburton County Em&#x27;s, both located along highway 35.

<doc id="1221951" wikidata="Q5079533" url="?curid=1221951" title="Charles Melliss">
<text>Major General Sir Charles John Melliss, (12 September 1862 – 6 June 1936) was a British Army officer of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. A staff officer in the Mesopotamian Campaign of the First World War, he was captured after the Siege of Kut.

==Early life==
Melliss was born in Mhow, British India, on 12 September 1862, the son of Lieutenant General George Julius Mellis of the Indian Staff Corps. He was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, being commissioned into the East Yorkshire Regiment in September 1882.

==Military career==
Melliss transferred to the Indian Army in 1884. He served in East Africa 1895–96 and on the North-West Frontier of India 1897–98. This was followed by operations in the Kurram Valley in Tirah 1897–98. He served with the North Nigeria Regiment in West Africa 1898–1902, and in Ashanti during 1900, including at the relief of Kumassi in the War of the Golden Stool. He was wounded four times during these operations, once severely. It was for his actions while attached to the West African Frontier Force during the Third Ashanti Expedition that Mellis was to receive the Victoria Cross. On 30 September 1900 at Obassa, Ashanti, Captain Melliss gathered together a party of men and charged into the bush at the head of them into the thick of the enemy. Although wounded in a hand-to-hand encounter, his bold rush caused panic among the enemy who were at the same time charged by the Sikhs.

Meliss was promoted major on 10 July 1901, and for the same action that won him the Victoria Cross he was also awarded the brevet rank of lieutenant colonel on the following day. He vacated his appointment as second in command of the Northern Nigeria Forces in late 1902, and reverted to the Indian Army, where he was posted to the 1st Bombay Grenadiers. The regiment served in East Africa 1902–04, where he was badly mauled by a lion in 1903. He commanded the 53rd Sikhs (Frontier Force) 1906–10, was promoted to temporary brigadier general, and served on the North West Frontier operations (Zakka Khel) of 1908. In February 1907 he was promoted to brevet colonel and made a personal aide-de-camp to King Edward VII. He was placed in command of a brigade, taking over from Major General James Young, in January 1912 and was promoted to major general on 19 March.

===First World War===
Major General Melliss was attached to the 6th (Poona) Division of the British Indian Army as it moved into what was then the Ottoman province of Basra in 1914. In April 1915, he was instrumental in the British victory at Shaiba. Melliss also fought in the Battle of Ctesiphon, the furthest up the Tigris that the 6th Division would advance.

After Ctesiphon, General Townshend, commander of the 6th Division, ordered a retreat back down the Tigris. Ottoman forces pursued the division to Kut-al-Amara, where, on 7 December 1915, Townshend ordered it to dig in and await relief. Melliss fell ill during the siege; he was in hospital when Townsend surrendered on 29 April 1916.

Transported upriver to Baghdad by steamship, Melliss remained in hospital and unable to travel as the survivors of the 6th Division were marched north toward Anatolia. When Melliss was well enough to travel, he followed the same route north. As he was a general, Melliss was allowed a travelling party and better than average supplies. Along the way, they encountered dead and dying enlisted men who had fallen behind one of the columns of British and Indian prisoners. Melliss took any survivors he found with him; at each stop he insisted that the men he had rescued from the desert be put into hospital.

Melliss spent his captivity at Broussa in northwestern Anatolia. While there, he repeatedly wrote letters to Enver Pasha detailing the sad state of the enlisted prisoners and demanding better treatment. Most of the British other ranks (1,755 out of 2,592) captured at Kut-al-Amara died in captivity.

==Later life==
He retired from the Indian Army 24 February 1920. He was appointed Colonel of his old regiment, the 53rd Sikhs, Frontier Force on 31 May 1921, a position he held until November 1934.

Melliss is buried at St. Peter&#x27;s Churchyard, Frimley, Surrey, England. His VC is held by Wellington College.

==Family==
Mellis married in 1901 Kathleen Walker, youngest daughter of General J. M. Walker.

<text>Stanley Robert McDougall, (23 July 1889 – 7 July 1968) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award given to British and Commonwealth forces for gallantry in the face of the enemy.

==Early life==
The son of the sawmiller John Henry McDougall (1854–1910), and Susannah Ann McDougall (1856–1919), née Cate, McDougall was born on 23 July 1889 at Recherche Bay, Tasmania, where he was raised and educated.

In civilian life, he was an amateur boxer, and a blacksmith by trade, and was considered an excellent horseman, an expert marksman, and a competent bushman.

==War service==
Illness prevented him from enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force to fight in the First World War until 31 August 1915. He was 28 years old and a sergeant in the 47th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force when he performed the actions for which he was awarded the VC.

On 28 March 1918 at Dernancourt, France, when an enemy attack succeeded in securing a foothold in the Allied line, McDougall charged the second wave single-handedly, killing seven men and capturing a machine-gun, which he turned on the attackers, routing them and causing many casualties. He continued his attack until his ammunition ran out, when he seized a bayonet and charged again, killing three men and an officer. Then, using a Lewis gun, he killed many more of the enemy and made it possible for 33 prisoners to be taken. His prompt action saved the line and halted the enemy&#x27;s advance. The fighting ground where this took place was the location where his younger brother Wallace had been killed some nine months earlier.

Eight days later he repelled another enemy attack at the same spot, for which he was awarded the Military Medal.

==Later life==
On 19 August 1918, he was invested with the Victoria Cross at Windsor Castle by King George V. He returned to Australia and was discharged on 15 December 1918.

McDougall subsequently worked for the Tasmanian Forestry Department and became an inspector in charge of forests in the north-western part of Tasmania. He returned to London in 1956 for the celebration marking 100 years since the establishment of the Victoria Cross. He died on 7 July 1968 at Scottsdale, Tasmania, and was survived by his wife Martha (née Anderson-Harrison), whom he had married in 1926; they had no children. He is buried at Norwood Crematorium, Canberra.

A street in Canberra is named after him. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial.

<text>Narciso López de Urriola (November 2, 1797, Caracas – September 1, 1851, Havana) was a Venezuelan-born adventurer and Spanish Army general who is best known for his expeditions aimed at liberating Cuba from Spanish rule in the 1850s. His troops carried a flag that López had designed, which later became the flag of Cuba. Following his final failed attempt he was captured and garroted in Havana.

== Life in Venezuela, Cuba, and Spain ==
Narciso López was born in Caracas, Venezuela, to a wealthy merchant family of Basque origin; his father was Pedro Manuel López and his mother was Ana Paula de Oriola (sometimes spelled Urriola). He had one sister, Maria Asunción López. As a young teenager, he was forcibly recruited in 1814 by the ruthless Spanish General José Tomás Boves from the ranks of the defeated independence forces that had been abandoned by a fleeing Simón Bolívar at the city of Valencia.

When still a young man, he fought for the Spanish at the Battle of Queseras del Medio (1819) and Carabobo (1821) against the forces for independence led by Simón Bolívar, José Antonio Páez and others.

When the Spanish army withdrew in defeat to Cuba after the decisive Battle of Lake Maracaibo (1823), López, who had fought in this battle, left with them, as did many other survivors including Calixto García de Luna e Izquierdo, who would be grandfather of Cuban independence Major General Calixto García. In 1825, he married the sister of the Count of Pozos Dulces in Cuba, María Dolores, with whom he had a son. Narciso López, who had earned the rank of colonel of the Spanish Army in Venezuela at only 31, fought in the First Carlist War. After the war, López continued to serve the Spanish government in several administrative posts, including the Cortes for Seville and as military governor in Madrid. López moved to Cuba as an assistant to the new capitan general, but he lost his post when the governorship changed hands in 1843. After failing in a few business ventures, he became a partisan of the anti-Spanish faction in Cuba. In 1848, during a Spanish arrest of Cuban revolutionaries, López fled to the United States.

== Filibuster ==

Once arrived López began planning a filibustering expedition from the United States to liberate Cuba. He made contact with influential American politicians, including John L. O&#x27;Sullivan, an expansionist who coined the term &quot;manifest destiny.&quot; López recruited Cuban exiles in New York City and other adventurers to his cause, and in 1849, his expedition was poised to embark: a troop of 600 volunteers had gathered on Round Island, Mississippi, with three ships chartered (two in New York and one in New Orleans) to transport them. However, US President Zachary Taylor, who had renounced filibustering as a valid means of US expansion, took steps against López and ordered his ships to be blockaded and seized. By September 9, the &quot;roughnecks&quot; had all been talked into leaving Round Island.

López, his aide-de-camp Ambrosio José Gonzales, and most of the filibuster leadership were Freemasons who relied extensively on the international fraternity to accomplish their plans.

Undeterred by that setback, López decided to plan a new filibuster and to focus his recruiting effort on the Southern United States. As a supporter of slavery himself, López realized the advantages for the South of an independent Cuba. He and some Southerners hoped that Cuba would become a strong partner in slavery and perhaps, like Texas, join the Union as a slave state. He moved his headquarters to New Orleans and tried to gain popular support by recruiting influential men of the South to join his expedition. He solicited the military help of Senator Jefferson Davis, who had distinguished himself in the Battle of Buena Vista, by offering him $100,000 and &quot;a very fine coffee plantation.&quot; Davis, to the great relief of his wife, turned him down but recommended one of his friends from the Mexican–American War, Major Robert E. Lee. Lee thought seriously about López&#x27;s offer but eventually also decided not to become involved.

Although López failed to recruit either rising star, he won the financial and political support of many influential Southerners, including Governor John A. Quitman of Mississippi; former Senator John Henderson; and the editor of the &quot;New Orleans Delta&quot;, Laurence Sigur. López enlisted about 600 filibusters in his expedition and successfully reached Cuba in May 1850. His troops seized the town of Cárdenas, carrying a flag that López and Miguel Teurbe Tolón had designed, which later became the flag of Cuba. Nevertheless, the local support that he had hoped for failed to materialize when the fighting started. Much of the local population joined the Spanish against López, and he hastily retreated to Key West, where he disbanded the expedition within minutes of landing to avoid being prosecuted under the Neutrality Act of 1794.

In the aftermath of the expedition, López and many of his supporters were indicted by a federal grand jury. Although the indictments did not end in convictions, they forced Governor John Quitman to resign from his office and to face trial. Despite military and legal setbacks, López began planning another expedition, which met with the similar problems and even more disastrous consequences.

In August 1851, López once again departed for Cuba with several hundred men (mostly Americans, Hungarians, Germans and some Cubans). When he arrived, he took half of his expedition to march inland, and the other half, commanded by Colonel William Crittenden (a former US Army lieutenant), remained on the northern coast to protect supplies. As had occurred during his first attempt, the local support that López had counted upon did not answer his appeals. Outnumbered and surrounded by Spanish forces, López and many men were captured. Crittenden&#x27;s forces shared the same fate. The Spanish executed most of the prisoners and sent others to work in mining labor camps.

Those executed included many Americans, such as Crittenden, and López in Castle La Punta of Havana.

== Aftermath and significance ==
The execution of López and his soldiers caused outrage in both the Northern and the Southern United States. Many who did not support the expedition found the Spanish treatment of military prisoners to be brutal. The strongest reaction occurred in New Orleans, where a mob attacked the Spanish consulate. Despite its failure, López&#x27;s expedition inspired other filibusters to attack all over Latin America throughout the 1850s, most notably William Walker&#x27;s invasions of Nicaragua in 1855 to 1860. Had he been successful, López could have profoundly altered politics in the Americas by giving a strong Caribbean foothold to the United States and spurring its further expansion. Instead, the failure of López and other filibusters discouraged Americans, especially in the South, from adopting expansionist strategies. Faced with the inability of slavery to move southward, many Southerners turned away from expansion and talked instead of secession, which led to the American Civil War.

The flag of Cuba is adopted from López&#x27;s expeditionary banner.

<doc id="1221969" wikidata="Q374326" url="?curid=1221969" title="Mahāparinibbāna Sutta">
<text>The Mahāparinibbāna Sutta is Sutta 16 in the &quot;Dīgha Nikāya&quot;, a scripture belonging to the Sutta Piṭaka of Theravāda Buddhism. It concerns the end of Gautama Buddha&#x27;s life - his parinibbāna - and is the longest sutta of the Pāli Canon. Because of its attention to detail, it has been resorted to as the principal source of reference in most standard accounts of the Buddha&#x27;s death.

==Content==
The sutta begins a few days before the rainy retreat when Vassakara, the minister, visited the Buddha in Rajgir on the initiative of Ajātasattu, a king of the Haryanka dynasty of Magadha. The narrative continues beyond the three months of the rainy retreat and records the passing away of the Buddha, his cremation and the division of relics finally ending with the erection of eight cetiyas or monuments enshrining the relics of the Buddha. This shows the Indian origin of Buddhist funeral customs.

==Versions==
There are numerous versions of the &quot;Mahāparinibbāna Sutta&quot;. Among them, the Pali version is of an early date in respect of language and contents. The &quot;Mahāparinibbāna Sutta&quot; is of utmost historical and cultural value and therefore it has become a sourcebook for students of Buddhism, Buddha biography and history of Buddhist thought and literature. Other versions of the text exist in Sanskrit, Tibetan and Chinese.

==Date of Composition==
On the basis of philological evidence, Indologist and Pali expert Oskar von Hinüber says that some of the Pali suttas have retained very archaic place-names, syntax, and historical data from close to the Buddha&#x27;s lifetime, including the &quot;Mahāparinibbāna Sutta&quot;. Hinüber proposes a composition date of no later than 350-320 BCE for this text, which would allow for a &quot;true historical memory&quot; of the events approximately 60 years prior if the short chronology for the Buddha&#x27;s lifetime is accepted (but also reminds us that such a text was originally intended more as hagiography than as an exact historical record of events).

The contents of narratives about the First Buddhist Council follow closely the narrative presented in the &quot;Mahāparinibbāna Sutta&quot;, leading scholars like Louis Finot and Erich Frauwallner to conclude that they originally formed a single continuous narrative. These narratives of the First Council and found in part or in whole in all six extant Vinaya traditions, whose organization and basic contents are believed by many scholars to stem from before the earliest schisms in the Buddhist Sangha. In some versions, the contents of the Sutta are included before the narrative of the First Council that ends the Skandhaka section of the Vinaya Pitakas. In other cases, the sutta narrative and the council narrative are divided between the Sutta Pitaka and Vinaya Pitaka.

<text>Captain Philip John (&quot;Pip&quot;) Gardner (25 December 1914 − 16 February 2003) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was educated at Dulwich College between 1928 and 1932.

Gardner was 26 years old, and an acting captain in the 4th Royal Tank Regiment, attached to the 70th Infantry Division during the Second World War&#x27;s Siege of Tobruk. During Operation Crusader, an attempt by the Eighth Army to lift the siege, the following deed took place for which Gardner was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 23 November 1941 at Tobruk, Libya, Captain Gardner was ordered to take two tanks to the rescue of two armoured cars of the King&#x27;s Dragoon Guards, which were out of action and under heavy attack. While one of his tanks gave covering fire the captain dismounted from the other in the face of heavy fire, hitched a tow rope to one of the cars, then lifted into it an officer, both of whose legs had been blown off. The tow rope broke, so Captain Gardner returned to the armoured car, but was immediately wounded in the neck, arm and leg. Despite this he managed to transfer the wounded man to the second tank and returned to British lines through intense shell-fire.

He was captured after the Battle of Gazala and became a prisoner of war (POW) for the rest of the war. This, unfortunately, resulted in an injury that left him with a deformed toe.

His VC is on display at the Imperial War Museum in London.

<text>Euchloe olympia, the Olympia marble, is a butterfly in the family Pieridae. Its range is southern Canada and the Midwest, down into the southwestern United States. &quot;E. olympia&quot; is related to &quot;E. guaymasensis&quot;, but has a distinctive phenotype and genotype.

==Nectar source==

&quot;Euchloe olympia&quot; has been observed to use &quot;Lepidium virginicum&quot; as its main nectar source as a larval and as an adult the main nectar source was found to be &quot;Nuttallanthus canadensis&quot;. Based on a study done in a central Illinois sand prairie, &quot;Echloe olympia&quot; was observed to show consistency on the flowers it visits to obtain its nectar from.

==Conservation status==
The Olympia marble has been classified globally as G5/G4, meaning that globally it is a relatively stable species. The United States has not placed it under any watch as a country. However, it is in danger due to gypsy moth chemical control.

<text>Ha Ki-Rak (; 1912–1997) was a professor and major figure in Korean anarchism.

==Biography==
The political life of Ha Ki-Rak, a Korean anarcho-pacifist academic, writer, and philosopher, began in 1929, when he participated in student demonstrations in Kwangju, pre-dating the mass student demonstrations in 1980 by 51 years.

While a student at Waseda University in Japan, during the Japanese occupation of Korea, Ha Ki-Rak was an anti-imperialist activist and joined the &quot;Tokyo Dong-hung No-dong Dong-meng&quot; (Workers&#x27; League of Tokyo).

After the liberation from Japan in 1945, he helped form the first Korean anarchist organization, Ja-yoo sa-hoi kun-sul-ja yun-meng (League of Free Social Constructors), authoring its founding declaration and political program.

In 1946, when Korean anarchists returning from exile held a meeting at Kum-gang-sa in Kyung-sang Province, Ha Ki-Rak edited their journal, &quot;Ja-yu yun-hap&quot; (Libertarian Federation), and afterwards participated in the unified organization they decided to create in order to rebuild the country, the &quot;Dok-lip no-nong-dang&quot; (Independent Workers and Farmers Party).

In 1972, he founded the &quot;Han-kuk ja-ju-in yun-meng&quot; (Korean Anarchist Federation) in Seoul. In 1978, he published &quot;A History of the Korean Anarchist Movement&quot;. In 1987, he took part in the congress of the Korean Anarchist Federation, which was established by Korean anarchists Lee Jung-Kyu and Lee Eul-Kyu. In 1995, two years before his death, he was a leading organizer of the World Peace Conference in Seoul.

MacGregor was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. MacGregor served in the Canadian army in both world wars.

==Details==
Macgregor was born in Cawdor near Nairn, Scotland in 1889 and moved to Canada in 1909. He served in the army from 1915 to 1919. MacGregor was 29 years old, and a temporary captain in the 2nd Regiment, Canadian Mounted Rifles, Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War when the following deed during the Battle of the Canal du Nord took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

During the period 29 September/3 October 1918 near Cambrai, France, Captain MacGregor acted with most conspicuous bravery and leadership. He led his company under intense fire, and although wounded, located and put out of action enemy machine-guns which were checking progress, killing four and taking eight prisoners. He then reorganised his command under heavy fire and in the face of stubborn resistance continued the advance. Later, after a personal daylight reconnaissance under heavy fire, he established his company in Neuville St. Remy, thereby greatly assisting the advance into Tilloy.

<text>John Chipman Kerr VC (January 11, 1887 – February 19, 1963), was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

In 1912, after working as a lumberjack in the Kootenay district of British Columbia, he bought a homestead in Spirit River, Alberta, where he and his brother farmed until war broke out. Immediately they set out for Edmonton, leaving only a single note tacked to the door of their humble shed. It read: &quot;War is Hell, but what is homesteading?&quot;

He was 29 years old, and a private in the 49th (Edmonton) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force, during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 16 September 1916 at Courcelette, France, during a bombing attack, Private Kerr was acting as bayonet man and noting that bombs were running short, he ran along the parados under heavy fire until he was in close contact with the enemy when he opened fire at point-blank range, inflicting heavy losses. The enemy, thinking that they were surrounded, surrendered: 62 prisoners were taken and 250 yards of enemy trench captured. Earlier, Private Kerr&#x27;s fingers had been blown off, but he did not have his wound dressed until he and two other men had escorted the prisoners back under fire and reported for duty.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

Mount Kerr in the Victoria Cross Ranges in Jasper National Park, Alberta, was named in his honour in 1951, and in 2006 Chip Kerr Park in Port Moody, British Columbia, was dedicated.

After the war he returned to farm in Alberta and also worked in the oil patch and as a forest ranger in Alberta.

He was a great uncle of Greg Kerr, member of Parliament for West Nova 2008–15.

<text>Major General Sir John Carstairs McNeill (28 March 1831 – 25 May 1904) was a senior British Army officer and Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
McNeill was the son of Anne Elizabeth McNeill née Carstairs, and Alexander McNeill (1791–1850), brother of Duncan McNeill, Lord Colonsay and Sir John McNeill. His brother was Alexander McNeill. He was educated at the University of St Andrews and Addiscombe Military Seminary.

On 18 June 1850, he and Alexander survived the wreck of the &quot;Orion&quot;, in which their parents and two sisters lost their lives.

McNeill entered the Bengal Army in December 1850 as an Ensign in the 12th Bengal Native Infantry. During the Indian Mutiny, he served at the siege and capture of Lucknow, after which he gained the brevet of major. In 1861 he transferred to the 107th Regiment of Foot (Bengal Light Infantry) – later The Royal Sussex Regiment. Shortly afterwards he travelled to New Zealand as a staff officer, and was promoted brevet lieutenant-colonel in March 1864.

===VC action===
McNeill was 33 years old, and a lieutenant colonel in the 107th Regiment of Foot (Bengal Light Infantry), while serving as an  Aide-de-Camp to Lieutenant General Sir Duncan Cameron during the Invasion of Waikato (a campaign of the New Zealand Wars), when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.
===Later career===
From 1869 to 1872 McNeill was military secretary to Lord Lisgar, Governor General of Canada, and was on the staff of the 1870 Red River expedition under Sir Garnet Wolseley. He became a colonel in 1872 and served as Wolseley&#x27;s chief of staff in the Second Ashanti War (1873–4), where he was wounded and invalided home. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in March 1874, by which time he had also been appointed aide-de-camp to the commander-in-chief, the Duke of Cambridge. Establishing a close connection with the Royal Family, he was appointed equerry to Queen Victoria in November 1874, and accompanied the Queen&#x27;s son, Prince Leopold, to Canada – becoming a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1880.

He served in the 1882 Egyptian campaign, after which he was promoted to major-general, and made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in November 1882. Leading a brigade during the 1885 Suakin Expedition, he was in command at the Battle of Tofrek on 22 March, against Mahdist forces led by Osman Digna. The Mahdists attacked in force and, although they were finally driven off with heavy losses, McNeill was initially accused of being taken by surprise by the attack, while his superior, Lieutenant-General Sir Gerald Graham, was criticised for not giving him sufficient mounted troops. While Wolseley&#x27;s report largely exonerated McNeill, this was his last command in the field. He retired from the army in 1890.

His association with the royal household continued, and he accompanied the Queen&#x27;s son Prince Arthur on his world tour in 1890. In 1898 McNeill was appointed king of arms to the Order of the Bath and was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) in 1901, on the accession of Edward VII. He died, unmarried, on 25 May 1904 at St James&#x27;s Palace, London, and was buried at Oronsay Priory, Argyll.

<text>John Creyghton Ainsworth-Davis (23 April 1895 – 3 January 1976) was a Welsh surgeon and sprint runner who won a gold medal in the 4 × 400 m relay at the 1920 Summer Olympics.

== Biography==
John Ainsworth-Davis studied at Westminster School. During World War I he first served as a captain with the Rifle Brigade and then as pilot in the Royal Flying Corps.

At the 1920 Summer Olympics Ainsworth-Davis ran the third leg for the British 4 × 400 m relay team, which won the event. He also competed in the individual 400 m, to replace Cecil Griffiths who fell ill, and finished fifth.

After graduating from University of Cambridge Ainsworth-Davis studied medicine at St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital and played music at a nightclub to support his family. He could not make time for sport, and retired from competitions after placing fourth in the 440 yards at the 1921 AAA Championships. He became a respected urological surgeon and the Secretary of the Royal Society of Medicine (RSM). During World War II he was head of the surgical division of RAF Hospital Cosford. Later he served as Secretary and President of the Hunterian Society (1958) and Secretary of the RSM.

Ainsworth-Davis married Marguerite C. Wharry in 1920, with whom he had three children: Mary (1923), John Christopher (1924) (an actor/director/author who wrote under the pen name of Christopher Creighton and used the name John Ainsworth in the theatrical world), and Jennifer (1930).

<doc id="1222028" wikidata="Q732279" url="?curid=1222028" title="Pine tar">
<text>Pine tar is a form of wood tar produced by the high temperature carbonization of pine wood in anoxic conditions (dry distillation or destructive distillation). The wood is rapidly decomposed by applying heat and pressure in a closed container; the primary resulting products are charcoal and pine tar.

Pine tar consists primarily of aromatic hydrocarbons, tar acids, and tar bases. Components of tar vary according to the pyrolytic process (e.g. method, duration, temperature) and origin of the wood (e.g. age of pine trees, type of soil, and moisture conditions during tree growth). The choice of wood, design of kiln, burning, and collection of the tar can vary. Only pine stumps and roots are used in the traditional production of pine tar.

Pine tar has a long history as a wood preservative, as a wood sealant for maritime use, in roofing construction and maintenance, in soaps, and in the treatment of carbuncles and skin diseases, such as psoriasis, eczema, and rosacea. It is used in baseball to enhance the grip of a hitter&#x27;s bat; it is also sometimes used by pitchers to improve their grip on the ball, in violation of the rules.

==History==

=== Nordic Iron Age ===
Based on chemical analysis of organic residues, there are strong indications that cone-shaped pits discovered north of Uppsala, Sweden, have been used for pine tar production. Three of the pits have been radiocarbon dated. The oldest dates back to 540–380 BCE, which would make it the world&#x27;s oldest known, still existing tar production facility. The other dates from 230–390 CE.

=== Classical antiquity ===
In his encyclopedic work &quot;Natural History&quot; () the Roman naturalist and author Pliny the Elder (23/24–79 CE) describes how, in Europe, tar is produced through the destructive distillation of pine wood. The wood was chopped into small pieces (billets) and heated in a furnace. The tar was used &quot;for coating ships and for many other useful purposes.&quot;

=== 17th century ===

==== Finland ====
Pine tar has long been used in Nordic nations as a preservative for wood which may be exposed to harsh conditions, including outdoor furniture and ship decking and rigging. Tar demand surged in the 17th century as European nations began constructing naval and merchant fleets that required tar and pitch for ship waterproofing and caulking. In Finland, then a part of Sweden, large-scale tar production began in the early 17th century. By the late 17th century, tar was Sweden&#x27;s third most valuable export commodity.

==== North American colonies ====
Tar and pitch for maritime use was in such demand that it became an important export for the American colonies, which had extensive pine forests. North Carolinians became known as &quot;Tar Heels.&quot;

=== 18th–19th century ===

==== Sweden ====
In present-day Sweden, large-scale tar production started around 1700. Swedish pine tar was often called &quot;Stockholm tar&quot; since, for many years, a single company held a royal monopoly on its export out of Stockholm, Sweden. It was also known as &quot;Archangel Tar&quot;. Stockholm tar became synonymous with top-quality tar. Tar production peaked around the mid-1850s and gradually declined thereafter, largely due to new shipbuilding materials reducing the need for tar as a waterproofing agent, and to the decreasing use of hemp rope as sailing ships were phased out.

== Use ==
Pine tar was used as a preservative on the bottoms of traditional Nordic-style skis until modern synthetic materials replaced wood in their construction. It also helped waxes adhere, which aided such skis’ grip and glide.

Pine tar is widely used as a veterinary care product, particularly as an antiseptic and hoof care treatment for horses and cattle. It also has been used when chickens start pecking the low hen. Applying a smear of pine tar on the hens&#x27; wound acts as a natural germicidal/antibacterial agent that discourages continued attacks on the affected hen due to its foreign texture.

Pine tar is used as a softening solvent in the rubber industry, for treating and fabricating construction materials, and in special paints.

===As a wood preservative===
Pine tar is combined with gum turpentine and boiled linseed oil to create a wood preservative. First, a thin coat is applied using a mixture with a greater proportion of turpentine. This allows it to permeate deeper into the oakum and fibre of the wood and lets the tar seep into any pinholes and larger gaps that might be in the planks. The tar weeps out to the exterior and indicates where the boat needs the most attention. This is followed with a thicker standard mix. Such treatments, while effective, must be continually reapplied.

===Weatherproofing rope===
Traditionally, hemp and other natural fibers were the norm for rope production. Such rope would quickly rot when exposed to rain, and was typically tarred to preserve it. The tar would stain the hands of ship&#x27;s crews, and British Navy seamen became known as &quot;tars.&quot;

===Baseball===
Pine tar is applied to the handles of baseball bats to improve a batter&#x27;s grip.

Rule 1.10(c) of the 2002 Official rules of Major League Baseball restricts application to the lower 18 inches of a bat. The most famous example of the rule being applied is the Pine Tar Incident, which occurred during the July 24, 1983 game between the Kansas City Royals and New York Yankees which resulted in a George Brett go-ahead home run in the ninth inning being nullified and the game being protested.

Pine tar is also sometimes used illegally by pitchers to improve their grip on the ball in cold weather. This is not allowed due to a regulation prohibiting the application of any foreign substance to a ball (except grip-improving baseball rubbing mud applied by the umpires).

===Medical===
Pine tar has historically been used for treating skin conditions, usually as an additive in cold process solid soap or lotions. Due to the high presence of phenol in the early manufacturing of pine tar, it was deemed carcinogenic. However, now much of the phenol has been removed. Pine tar was banned by the FDA along with many other ingredients categorized as over the counter drugs, due to a lack of evidence of safety and effectiveness for the specific uses named. However, clinical tests in Australia in 2017 demonstrated that the greatest risk comes from acute sensitivity for those with severe dermatological conditions, and if it comes in contact with the eyes. The number of positive reactions for wood tars was not significantly greater than those for other common allergens. In addition, the concentration of pine tar in topical products available in Australia is up to 2.3%, which is up to four times less than that tested in these studies.

Pine tar has been used to cover peck wounds in captive bird flocks such as chickens, to prevent continued pecking on a wound and cannibalism. Pine tar is also used in veterinary medicine as an expectorant and an antiseptic in chronic skin conditions.

Following the successful conclusion of the expedition, Goodfellow was assigned to conduct an archaeological excavation at Adulis, the ancient harbor of the Kingdom of Aksum, on behalf of the British Museum. Goodfellow uncovered the remains of a building and stone columns, fragments of marble and alabaster on which crude drawings had been made, pottery and coins. These items were later sent to the British Museum. Goodfellow later achieved the rank of lieutenant general, and was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath.

<text>William Hackett VC (11 June 1873 – 27 June 1916) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Hackett was born 11 June 1873 to John and Harriet Hackett of Nottingham; he worked as a miner for 23 years. He was married to Alice née Tooby who received the medal on his behalf, and left two children, Arthur and Mary W. Hackett.
After being rejected three times by the York and Lancaster Regiment for being too old, Hackett enlisted in the British Army on 25 October 1915, despite having been diagnosed with a heart condition. He spent two weeks of basic training at Chatham, joining 172nd Tunnelling Company. He later served with 254th Tunnelling Company, Corps of Royal Engineers. He was 43 years old and a Sapper in British Army during the First World War when he performed a deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross on 22 June/23 June 1916 at Shaftesbury Avenue Mine, near Givenchy-lès-la-Bassée, France.
Hackett died in an attempt to help fellow miners when a tunnel collapsed at Shaftesbury Avenue Mine on 26 June 1916.

==Citation==
==Memorials==
Hackett&#x27;s name is recorded on the Ploegsteert Memorial to the Missing in Berks Cemetery Extension near Ploegsteert in Hainaut, Belgium. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum &quot;(Chatham, England)&quot;.

In Givenchy-lès-la-Bassée, the &quot;Tunnellers Memorial&quot; commemorates the action on 26 June 1916 for which Hackett was awarded the Victoria Cross. The memorial stands at the site of the Shaftesbury Shaft and the Red Dragon Crater. Its dimensions, high and wide, mirror the standard interior proportions of mine galleries constructed by the tunnelling companies in the Flanders clays. The memorial was designed by Peter Barton and unveiled on 19 June 2010.

== In fiction ==
A tunneller with the same name, also a miner during World War I, is the main character in the 2020 movie &quot;The War Below&quot;, though his eventual fate is different to that of the real Hackett.

<text>Charles Alfred Jarvis VC (29 March 1881 – 19 November 1948) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Jarvis was born in the Admiralty Buildings, Saltoun Place, Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire on 29 March 1881. His father was a coastguard and also called Charles Alfred Jarvis. He lived most of his early life in Carnoustie, Angus, where there is now a memorial to him. He was also honoured by Fraserburgh in 2014. He joined the Royal Engineers in 1899 and travelled with his unit to Singapore. He was transferred to the reserve in 1907. In civilian life, Jarvis was a metalworker and a member of the Walthamstow Branch of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers.

At the outbreak of World War I he was recalled to service. He was 33 years old, and a lance-corporal in the 57th Field Company, Royal Engineers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

Only three weeks into the war on 23 August 1914 at Jemappes, Belgium, Lance-Corporal Jarvis worked for 1½ hours under heavy fire, in full view of the enemy and finally succeeded in firing charges for the demolition of a bridge. He was wounded in the process. Private Samuel Heron of the first battalion Royal Scots Fusiliers was also awarded a DCM for his part in this action.

In 1915 he returned to Britain and was presented with his medal at Buckingham Palace. He was later promoted to second corporal and corporal before being discharged from the Army in 1917. He went on to work at the Naval Dockyard at Portsmouth. He returned to Dundee in 1941.

== Early life ==
Soon after he was born, his father was transferred to Rattray Head Coastguard Station where the family stayed for eight years while Charles went to Crimond School. The family then moved to North Berwick where his father received the Royal Humane Society medal for bravery for rescuing two boys. His father was then transferred to Carnoustie where Charles completed his education in Carnoustie School.

== Working life ==
After leaving school he was an apprentice plumber but was unable to complete due to the death of his mother and sister within a month and two years later his father died.

<text>Commander John Wallace Linton, (15 October 1905 – 23 March 1943) was a Royal Navy submariner and a Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Nicknamed &quot;Tubby&quot;, he was a fine Rugby football forward, playing for the Royal Navy, United Services, and Hampshire County teams.

==Naval career==
Acting Sub-Lieutenant Linton was promoted to sub-lieutenant on 15 July 1926 and then lieutenant on 15 July 1928, with his seniority in rank subsequently adjusted. Found suitable for further promotion, he was promoted lieutenant commander on 1 July 1936.

In 1940 Linton was commander of the submarine Pandora operating in the Far East and in May 1940 brought her to Alexandria and on to Malta, where she was destroyed in the bombing attacks by the Luftwaffe on 1 April 1942.

===Victoria Cross===
Linton was 37 years old, and a commander in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

From the outbreak of the war in September 1939 to March 1943, which was the month of HMS &quot;Turbulent&quot;″s last patrol in the Mediterranean, Commander Linton was responsible for sinking over 90,000 tons of enemy shipping, including a cruiser, a destroyer, a U-boat and 28 other ships. In addition &quot;Turbulent&quot; destroyed three trains by gun fire. In his last year Commander Linton spent 254 days at sea, submerged for nearly half the time, his ship was hunted 13 times and had 250 depth charges aimed at her.

&quot;Turbulent&quot; had sunk a huge amount of enemy shipping and endured numerous attacks. The Royal Navy states that:
In recognition of this achievement, and the gallantry of &quot;Turbulent&#x27;s&quot; crew, Linton was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross on 25 May 1943. The citation read: 

Linton was killed in action in La Maddalena Harbour, Italy, on 23 March 1943.This has not been proved and the wreck of the submarine has never been found. Until it is the cause and location of his death can only be surmised. 

==Honours and awards==
On 6 May 1941 Lieutenant-Commander John Wallace Linton of HMS &quot;Pandora&quot; was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross:
On 15 September 1942 Commander John Wallace Linton, DSC, was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order:
On 25 May 1943 Commander John Wallace Linton, DSO, DSC, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for valour in command of HM Submarines:

The convoy attack specified in the citation occurred off Libya on 28/29 May 1942.

==Legacy==
Linton&#x27;s body was not recovered and his name appears on the Portsmouth Naval Memorial, Portsmouth, Hampshire, England. Panel 72. Column 3. His Victoria Cross is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London. A JD Wetherspoon&#x27;s public house has been renamed in his honour in his hometown of Newport.

Linton was not the only member of his family to be lost aboard a Royal Navy submarine. His eldest son, Sub-Lieutenant William F. Linton, was among the 75 men who perished when the A-class submarine was lost in a training exercise on 16 April 1951.

<text>Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Mactier, VC (17 May 1890 – 1 September 1918) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was one of 64 Australians to receive the award for their actions during the First World War, receiving it as a result of deeds performed during the Battle of Mont St Quentin on 1 September 1918. That day, Mactier was a battalion runner serving with the 23rd Battalion, Australian Imperial Force. He was sent forward by an officer to determine the cause of a delay in the battalion moving into its jumping off position. The cause was a well placed enemy machine gun. On his own initiative, Mactier jumped out of the trench and charged the gun, killing its crew of six. He then charged two other machine guns, killing more crews and causing at least 40 enemy to surrender. He was killed by fire from a fourth machine gun, but not before enabling his battalion to form up on time.

==Early life==
Robert Mactier was born at Tatura, Victoria, on 17 May 1890, the seventh of ten children of Robert and Christina Mactier of &quot;Reitcam&quot; (&quot;Mactier&quot; spelt backwards), a nearby property. In his formative years, he was a keen sportsman. He went to school locally, and later worked on his father&#x27;s properties until he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force at Seymour on 1 March 1917. He sailed from Melbourne with the other 151 Victorians of the 23rd Battalion&#x27;s 19th Reinforcements aboard HMAT A11 &quot;Ascanius &quot; on 11 May. He arrived in France on 14 November, and joined the battalion on 23 November. Posted to B Company, he fought in all of the battalion&#x27;s subsequent battles until his death, including at Hamel, the August Offensive and Albert, where he was gassed. His brother, David, served with the 37th Battalion.

==Victoria Cross action==
He was 28 years old, and a private in the 23rd Battalion when the following deed took place for which he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. The full citation for the Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 13 December 1918:

Mactier was buried nearby at Clery but in 1924, he was reinterred in the Hem Farm Military Cemetery near Péronne, France. Mactier&#x27;s actions have been described as &quot;a remarkable one-man offensive&quot;. He was unmarried.

==Legacy==
Mactier has been commemorated in numerous ways. In his home town of Tatura there is a stained glass window in St Andrews Church dedicated to the memory of Mactier and his parents. The Robert Mactier VC Memorial Garden, commonly known as Mactier Park, is also named after him. In 1956, his two sisters represented him at the Victoria Cross centenary in London. The soldiers&#x27; club at Simpson Barracks, Watsonia was later named the &quot;Mactier VC Club&quot; in his honour. It also holds a bust of him by Wallace Anderson. Mactier&#x27;s Victoria Cross was presented to the Australian War Memorial, in Canberra by his family in 1983, where it is now on display. His name is recorded on panel 99 of the Roll of Honour in the Commemorative Area at the Australian War Memorial.

<doc id="1222092" wikidata="Q684439" url="?curid=1222092" title="Tarpeia">
<text>In Roman legend, Tarpeia (; mid-8th century BCE), daughter of the Roman commander Spurius Tarpeius, was a Vestal Virgin who betrayed the city of Rome to the Sabines at the time of their women&#x27;s abduction for what she thought would be a reward of jewelry. She was instead crushed to death by Sabine shields and her body cast from the southern cliff of Rome&#x27;s Capitoline Hill, thereafter called after her the Tarpeian Rock (&quot;Rupes Tarpeia&quot;).

==Legend==

The legend tells that while Rome was besieged by the Sabine king Titus Tatius, Tarpeia, a Vestal Virgin and daughter of the commander of the citadel, Spurius Tarpeius, approached the Sabine camp and offered them entry to the city in exchange for &quot;what they bore on their left arms&quot;. Greedy for gold, she had meant their bracelets, but instead the Sabines threw their shields—carried on the left arm—upon her, crushing her to death. Her body was then hurled from (or, according to some accounts, buried at) a steep cliff of the southern summit of the Capitoline Hill. The Sabines were however unable to conquer the Forum, its gates miraculously protected by boiling jets of water created by Janus.

The legend was depicted in 89 BC by Sabinus following the Civil Wars as well as on a silver denarius of the Emperor Augustus in approximately 20 BC. Tarpeia would later become a symbol of betrayal and greed in Rome. The cliff from which she was thrown was named the Tarpeian Rock, and would become the place of execution for Rome&#x27;s most notorious traitors. Traitors and murderers were reported to have been thrown off the Tarpeian Rock, which extended over a steep drop from the Capitol. The exact positioning of the rock is debated. Varro asserts that it was near the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, whereas Dionysius of Halicarnassus asserts that it was located in the southeast above the Roman Forum.

== Accounts ==

=== Livy ===
Livy’s account uses information from Fabius, Dionysius, and Piso, all of which had existing accounts of Tarpeia prior to Livy. The previous writers form the base story of the myth which is told in the legend. A unique detail that Livy adds is the suggestion that Tarpeia was not greedily looking for gold, but was trying to trick the Sabines into giving up their weapons once she let them in. Livy writes:

:There are some who say that, from the agreement of handing over what was on their left hands, what she really sought was their weapons and that, having appeared to act in fraud, she was undone by her own “wage”.

=== Varro ===
Varro’s account of Tarpeia is nearly the same as Livy’s, however, Varro includes that Tarpeia was a Vestal. Varro added this detail when Plutarch wrote that one of the first four Vestals was named Tarpeia. This added detail is significant since it is now accepted in the myth that Tarpeia was a Vestal. It also paved the way for writers such as Propertius to expand on this detail and add themes of Tarpeia being unchaste, hence why she was greedy.

=== Propertius ===
Propertius’ account is considered to be a production of art. The poem most notably introduced the love affair between Tatius and Tarpeia. This was used because of Varro&#x27;s addition of Tarpeia being a Vestal Virgin. Since Tarpeia was a Vestal Virgin, love (and therefore sexual desire) could be used as foreshadowing Tarpeia&#x27;s greed and betrayal to the city of Rome. This artistic approach to the myth makes the story more relatable to Romans and served as a greater symbol of what happens when greed overtakes someone.

=== Plutarch ===
Plutarch&#x27;s account offers a version of the story which is longer than Livy’s account but closely details the same events. However, compared to Livy, Plutarch only provides one version in which Tarpeia betrays Rome to the Sabines out of her lust for gold and subsequently dies under the weight of the Sabine shields placed upon her.

=== Piso ===
Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi, a 2nd century BCE Latin Historian, wrote a more favorable account of Tarpeia which reported that she had no intention of betraying Rome. However, Piso’s actual account of the event does not survive. Piso’s version survives through Dionysius of Halicarnassus’s work. Dionysius of Halicarnassus reports that Piso portrayed Tarpeia as innocent of any treachery, greed, or love for Tatius. He includes the untraditional detail that Tarpeia alerted Romulus about her deal with Tatius to demand the Sabines of their shields. Additionally, Tarpeia subsequently asked Romulus to send troops to the Capitol to correspond with her plan to capture their shields. Piso regarded Tarpeia’s public sacrifice at her tomb as a way to display her position as a national heroine, rather than traitor.

=== Simylos ===
Simylos (Σιμύλος), a Greek 4th century BCE poet, wrote about Tarpeia as well. Eight lines were preserved by Plutarch in which Plutarch criticizes Simylos’ version which details that Tarpeia betrayed Rome to the Gauls, rather than to the Sabines.

=== Antigonos ===
Antigonos (Ἀντίγονος), a 3rd century BCE Greek author, portrays Tarpeia as innocent of treacherous behavior and a model of filial virtue. She was identified as the daughter of Tatius who had been unwillingly made Romulus’ concubine and therefore betrayed Rome for her father.

=== Other Accounts ===
Roman historians Fabius Pictor and Lucius Cincius Alimentus also formulated their own versions of the story of Tarpeia.

Dionysius of Halicarnassus, rather than retelling his own version of the Tarpeia story, compares existing versions from Fabius Pictor, Cinicus, and Piso. In the end, he appears to show the most preference for Piso’s more positive and patriotic account.

== Tarpeia as a Vestal Virgin ==
Varro and Propertius most notably identify Tarpeia as a Vestal Virgin. However, her status as a Vestal Virgin is only explicitly established in the works of Varro and the &quot;Breviarium Vindobonense&quot; from the early 4th century CE. Livy does not explicitly call Tarpeia a Vestal, but he does call her a “virgo”. Roman historians typically say that this translates to her being a Vestal.

The Vestals performed the Parentalia or dies parentales (&quot;ancestral days&quot;) on February 13/Ides of February at the tomb of Tarpeia since she herself was considered to be a Vestal. Tarpeia’s status as a Vestal Virgin both positions her as a physical embodiment of religious protection and chastity of the Roman state. Additionally, treason committed by a Vestal Virgin appears to be even more sinful than if committed by an ordinary Roman. Therefore, scholars have debated if Tarpeia’s identity as a Vestal Virgin was invented to symbolically represent the unchaste nature of her act and was not actually an integral part of the story/legend.

== Iconography ==
Only three icons of Tarpeia survive from antiquity: the Basilica Aemilia (c. 1st century BCE), a Republican denarii minted by L. Titurius Sabinus (89 BCE), and an Augustan denarii issued by P. Petronius Turpilianus (c. 19 BCE). (&quot;See images above of &quot;Denarius 89 BCE,&quot; &quot;Denarius 18-19 BCE,&quot; and &quot;Basilica Aemilia&quot;&quot;)

The Basilica Aemilia provides the most complex portrayal out of the three. The frieze depicts Tarpeia in the center, surrounded by a soldier on each side of her preparing to overwhelm her with their shields. The two outer figures on each side are said to possibly be Titus Tatius and Mars Ultor, or alternatively Romulus himself.

The Sabinus Denarii closely resembles the Basilica Aemilia with an image of Tarpeia being surrounded by two Sabine soldiers with raised shields. The Turpilianus Denarii differs slightly from the prior two depictions. Tarpeia is the central and only figure on the reverse side of the coin. The shields have already been piled on top of her and her hands are lifted up in a stance which evokes surrender.

== Symbolism ==
A common metaphor used in ancient times was the association of water vessels and female sexuality. The female body is the container while the water inside represents her fertility. Since Tarpeia was a Vestal Virgin, it is very significant that she dropped her water vessel when first seeing Tatius in Propertius&#x27; account. Vestal Virgins were the embodiment of a perfect citizen of Rome. Their &quot;unpenetrated skin&quot; was a metaphor for Rome&#x27;s walls remaining standing. The dropped water is interpreted as Tarpeia not being chaste, connecting her greed with &quot;erotic transgression&quot;.

In Propertius’ version, the symbolism of water also occurs in Tarpeia’s dream where she sees herself as both an Amazon and Bacchante. The image of an Amazon refers to the river Thermodon in the mythical Amazon land in Pontus. The image of a Bacchante refers to the Strymon river in Thrace which is associated with Dionysius.

The myth of Tarpeia has been widely read as a cautionary tale about the evil of treachery, greed, and lust. Images of Tarpeia and the myth were later used during the Augustan age as exempla for the incorrect type of Roman woman and trickery. The Basilica Aemilia from the 1st century CE prominently features Tarpeia being overwhelmed by shields. The use of this image in the Augustan Age is tied to Augustan laws on sexual morality and his attempts to restore the empire. Therefore, the myth and image of Tarpeia was politically used to display the &quot;wrong&quot; kind of sexuality. Tarpeia is represented as the epitome of a traitorous Roman woman who betrayed her body to the state and was overcome by lust and greed. Additionally, the story of Tarpeia also points to the two-way loyalty that Sabine women had during this time in Roman history.

<text>Cecil John Kinross VC (17 February 1896 – 21 June 1957) was a Canadian soldier in World War I. Kinross was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was only nineteen when it was awarded to him, making him the second youngest Victoria cross recipient ever.

==Early life==
Kinross was born on 17 February 1896 at Dews Farm, Harefield, Middlesex. His father&#x27;s family originated in Perthshire. He moved to Lougheed, Alberta with his parents and siblings in 1912.
==Military career==
Kinross volunteered in Calgary, Alberta, on October 21, 1915, as a private in the 49th (Edmonton) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force. On 30 October 1917, at the Battle of Passchendaele during the First World War, Kinross performed an act of bravery for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

Kinross was wounded in the arm and head in 1917 and hospitalised in Orpington, England. He was subsequently presented with the Victoria Cross by King George V in March 1918. 

==Later life==
Kinross returned to Alberta after the war and was given a plot of land in Lougheed. He never married and died at the Lougheed Hotel in on 21 June 1957. He is buried in the Soldier&#x27;s Plot in Lougheed.

==Legacy==
Mount Kinross, 2560m, 24 km NW of Jasper, Alberta, in the Victoria Cross Ranges in Jasper National Park, was named after him in 1951.

His Victoria Cross medal is held by his family while the miniature is on display at The Loyal Edmonton Regiment Military Museum in Edmonton, Alberta.

<text>Kathleen Kylie Tennant AO (; 12 March 1912 – 28 February 1988) was an Australian novelist, playwright, short-story writer, critic, biographer, and historian.

==Early life and career==

Tennant was born in Manly, New South Wales; she was educated at Brighton College in Manly and Sydney University, though she left without graduating. She was a publicity officer for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, as well as working as a journalist, union organiser, reviewer (for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;), a publisher&#x27;s literary adviser and editor, and a member of the Commonwealth Literary Fund advisory board. She married L. C. Rodd in 1933; they had two children (a daughter, Benison, in 1946 and a son, John Laurence, in 1951).

Her work was known for its well-researched, realistic, yet positive portrayals of the lives of the underprivileged in Australia. In a video interview filmed in 1986, three years before her death, for the Australia Council&#x27;s Archival Film Series, Tennant told how she lived as the people she wrote about, travelling as an unemployed itinerant worker during the Depression years, living in Aboriginal communities and spending a short time in prison for research.

Two of Tennant&#x27;s novels, &quot;Battlers&quot; and &quot;Ride on Stranger&quot;, set in the 1930s, have been made into television mini-series. 
&quot;Kylie&#x27;s Hut&quot;, the author&#x27;s retreat in Crowdy Bay, was destroyed during the 2019–20 Australian bushfire season.

==Personal life==
Tennant was raised in a devout Christian Science family and her mother was a Christian Science practitioner. She converted to Anglicanism upon her marriage, which her family supported.

<doc id="1222108" wikidata="Q6131935" url="?curid=1222108" title="James Crichton (soldier)">
<text>James Crichton, VC (15 July 1879 – 22 September 1961) was an Irish-born soldier and a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that could be awarded at that time to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in 1879 in Ireland, Crichton served with the British Army during the Second Boer War, and later emigrated to New Zealand. Following the outbreak of the First World War, he joined the New Zealand Military Forces and served with the Army Service Corps during the Gallipoli Campaign and on the Western Front in a field bakery. He transferred to the infantry in May 1918. On 30 September 1918, during the Hundred Days Offensive, as well as carrying messages while under gunfire, he deactivated demolition charges set by German forces to destroy a bridge. For these actions, he was awarded the VC. He went to London in 1937 for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth and again nearly 20 years later for the VC centenary. He died in 1961, aged 82.

==Early life==
Crichton was born in Carrickfergus, in Ireland, on 15 July 1879. His family moved to the mining hamlet of Northrigg by Blackridge in what is now West Lothian, Scotland, when he was young. By the age of 10, he was working in a coal mine. Nicknamed &quot;Scotty&quot;, he joined the British Army by enlisting in the Royal Scots Regiment at the age of 18. Two years later, he transferred to the Cameron Highlanders. He remained with the Highlanders for five years, including a period in South Africa during the Second Boer War.

During the Boer War, Crichton served with the Highlander&#x27;s 1st Battalion, which saw action at the capture of Pretoria, the Battle of Diamond Hill, and the Battle of Nooitgedacht. In 1904, he returned to civilian life. He later moved to New Zealand and settled in Auckland. He took up employment as a cable splicer with the New Zealand Post &amp; Telegraph Department.

==First World War==

Following the outbreak of the First World War, Crichton volunteered for the New Zealand Military Forces and was sent to the Middle East with the main body of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in October 1914. Promoted to corporal, he was posted to the New Zealand Army Service Corps (NZASC) as a baker with a field bakery. For the Gallipoli Campaign, the field bakery was part of the NZASC Divisional Train of the New Zealand and Australian Division. The NZASC divisional train was landed at Anzac Cove on 26 April 1915, and Crichton served throughout the campaign. At its conclusion, he was promoted to quartermaster sergeant. Two months later, he was promoted again, to warrant officer, 2nd class, before being sent to the Western Front.

Crichton was now serving with the 1st Field Bakery, which was part of the NZASC Divisional Train supplying the New Zealand Division. The Field Bakery numbered 92 personnel, many of whom had no experience, and was initially stationed at Rouen. It was required to produce 25,000 bread rations. As the bakers gained expertise, their output increased. By 1917, the numbers of personnel had been reduced through sickness. With no reinforcements, the burden on the remaining bakers increased. They later moved to La Mengate and then L&#x27;Hallobeau to support the troops during the Battle of Messines.

In May 1918, having served with the 1st Field Bakery for over three years, Crichton wanted a transfer to serve with the infantry and experience frontline action. He relinquished his rank as a warrant officer and was posted to the infantry. He later stated that he had been selected for officer training with the NZASC, but a senior officer in the Auckland Infantry Regiment offered to arrange his transfer if permission was obtained. It was made clear to him that he would be reduced in rank if he proceeded with the transfer. Initially placed in the 3rd Entrenching Battalion, one of the training units of the New Zealand Division, he was transferred to the Auckland Infantry Regiment and posted to its 2nd Battalion with the rank of private in late August 1918.

On 30 September 1918, during the Hundred Days Offensive, Crichton&#x27;s platoon was trying to force a crossing of the Scheldt River, near Crèvecœur, when it came under machine-gun fire. With several men killed, including the platoon commander and senior non-commissioned officer, Crichton and the remnants of the platoon were trapped on an island in the middle of the river. The bridge leading to Crèvecœur was wired for demolition. Despite a foot wound, Crichton volunteered to inform company headquarters of the platoon&#x27;s situation.

Fully clothed, Crichton swam the river and despite being exposed to German gunfire as he made his way up the bank, he was able to make his report to the company&#x27;s commander. He then returned to the trapped platoon, carrying a message to hold on for reinforcements. While waiting assistance from other units, Crichton decided to deal with the demolition charges on the bridges and took out the fuses and detonators. While doing so, he was exposed to gunfire from German snipers.

After he returned to his company commander to report his successful deactivation of the demolition charges, Crichton attempted to re-join his platoon but was ordered to remain behind at company headquarters. He then assisted stretcher bearers transporting wounded soldiers before the gravity of his wounds became apparent and he was taken, despite his protests, to a field hospital. He was later evacuated to England for further treatment. Promoted to sergeant, he was still recovering from his wounds when the war ended.

Crichton was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) for his deeds of 30 September 1918. The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest gallantry award that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation for his VC read:

Crichton&#x27;s VC was the last to be earned by a serviceman of the NZEF during the First World War. Together with three other New Zealanders who had been awarded the VC, he received his medal from King George V in an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 27 February 1919. He returned to New Zealand in June 1919 and shortly afterwards was formally discharged from the NZEF.

==Later life and legacy==
After leaving the military, Crichton resumed his pre-war profession as a cable splicer. In 1919 he married Amy Watkins , a war widow. The couple had two daughters. Crichton was part of the New Zealand contingent sent to London in 1937 for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. At the time, he was working for the New Zealand Post &amp; Telegraph Department as a foreman. He retired two years later.

During the Second World War, Crichton served in the Home Guard and worked on merchant ships travelling between New Zealand and England. In 1953, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. At 76, he returned to London in 1956 as part of the VC centenary celebrations.

Crichton died at Auckland Hospital on 22 September 1961. Survived by his wife and a daughter, he was buried in Waikumete Cemetery in Auckland. Crichton&#x27;s family donated his VC to the Auckland War Memorial Museum, which continues to hold the medal along with his service medals from the Boer War and the First and Second World Wars.

Several memorials are dedicated to Crichton, including a plaque on the first house in which his family lived in Carrickfergus, his place of birth, in Northern Ireland. The town&#x27;s museum also has a plaque honouring Crichton and another VC recipient from Carrickfergus, Daniel Cambridge. His name is recorded on the Armadale &amp; District Roll of Honour, which included the Scottish village of Blackridge, where he had lived as a boy. At Blackridge school where he was a pupil, a replica VC memorial stone was installed in 2018. In New Zealand, there is a plaque dedicated to him in Queen&#x27;s Garden in Dunedin, and a street in the town of Hastings is named for him.
