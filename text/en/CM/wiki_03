<text>The ciscoes (or &quot;ciscos&quot;) are salmonid fish that differ from other members of the genus &quot;Coregonus&quot; in having upper and lower jaws of approximately equal length and high gill raker counts. These species have been the focus of much study recently, as researchers have sought to determine the relationships among species that appear to have evolved very recently. &quot;Cisco&quot; is also specifically used for the North American species &quot;Coregonus artedi&quot;, also known as lake herring.

In previous taxonomic classifications, the ciscoes have been identified as a subgenus &quot;Leucichthys&quot; of the genus &quot;Coregonus&quot;. Based on molecular data this is not a natural classification however, as the ciscoes are polyphyletic, comprising two different lineages within the freshwater whitefishes.

==Continental North American ciscoes: &quot;Coregonus artedi&quot; sensu lato==
Eight taxa of cisco have been recognized in the Laurentian Great Lakes and other interior lakes of the once-glaciated North America.

* †Longjaw cisco – &quot;Coregonus alpenae&quot;
* Cisco (lake cisco, northern cisco, or lake herring) – &quot;Coregonus artedi&quot;
* †Deepwater cisco – &quot;Coregonus johannae&quot;
* Bloater – &quot;Coregonus hoyi&quot;
* Kiyi – &quot;Coregonus kiyi&quot;
* †Blackfin cisco – &quot;Coregonus nigripinnis&quot;
* Shortnose cisco – &quot;Coregonus reighardi&quot; (thought to be possibly extinct, rediscovered)
* Shortjaw cisco – &quot;Coregonus zenithicus&quot;

Usually, several taxa of ciscoes are found in a single lake. They exhibit different habitat distributions, feeding and breeding habits and morphological adaptations e.g. in their gill raker numbers. In the Great Lakes, at least five ciscoes coexist.

According to genetic analyses, these cisco types do not represent unique, separate evolutionary lineages, but similar cisco morphs have evolved and attained their specific characteristics largely independently in each lake. Therefore, it has been suggested that they should not be recognized formally as distinct taxa, but all considered members of a single species, &quot;Coregonus artedi&quot; (sensu lato). or &quot;Coregonus artedi&quot; complex. Nevertheless, for conservation and management purposes the sympatric morphs in each lake should be considered ESUs, evolutionarily significant units. This taxonomic view is not widely accepted however, which has complicated discussions of the conservation status of some species.

Ciscoes have been exploited in commercial fisheries, particularly in the Laurentian Great Lakes where the deepwater forms were the basis of the so-called chub fishery. The chub fishery had nothing to do with the various cyprinid fish species known as chubs but was exclusively based on the various species of ciscoes. The fishery continued as cisco stocks fell and non-native species such as sea lamprey, rainbow smelt and alewife spread through the system and increased in abundance. Alewife, in particular, have been implicated as a predator of cisco eggs and larvae, and as a competitor with ciscoes. The fishery shifted focus from species to species as cisco numbers declined and has been largely defunct for some years.
==Ciscoes of northwestern North America==
Three species of cisco inhabit waters of the northwestern North America. These have been found to represent distinct evolutionary lineages, by genetic data. 
* Arctic cisco – &quot;Coregonus autumnalis&quot;
* Bering cisco – &quot;Coregonus laurettae&quot;
* Least cisco – &quot;Coregonus sardinella&quot;

==Eurasian ciscoes==
The ranges of the three cisco species above extend across Beringia to the Asian coasts. Of those the Arctic cisco and least cisco (=sardine cisco) are widespread through northern Siberia. In the inland waters of northern Europe, the European cisco or vendace (&quot;Coregonus albula&quot;) replaces the Siberian sardine cisco. Some of the cisco lineages are genetically very close, such as the European and sardine ciscoes. Within some species, geographically separated populations have been treated as distinct taxa, despite close genetic relationships, such as the vendace and the pollan (Arctic cisco) on the British Isles. The European cisco has also evolved into ecologically distinct sympatric populations or ecomorphs independently within several lakes (e.g. autumn and spring spawning populations, normal and dwarf morphs), which have been designated as distinct taxa, making the systematics complicated as with the North American &quot;Coregonus artedi&quot; complex.

* Bering cisco – &quot;Coregonus laurettae&quot; 
* Arctic cisco – &quot;Coregonus autumnalis&quot;
**Irish pollan - &quot;&quot;Coregonus pollan&quot;: an Irish subspecies or group of populations 
* Sardine cisco (= least cisco) – &quot;Coregonus sardinella&quot;
*Peled – &quot;Coregonus peled&quot;: part of the &quot;C. sardinella&quot; complex
* European cisco (=vendace) – &quot;Coregonus albula&quot;
** &quot;Coregonus vandesius&quot;&quot;: group of British populations
** Stechlin cisco – &quot;Coregonus fontanae&quot;: local sympatric spring spawning dwarfed sister species
** &quot;Coregonus trybomi&quot;: local sympatric spring-spawning sister species
** &quot;Coregonus lucinensis&quot;: local sympatric dwarfed sister species

==Phylogeny==
Based on molecular data from mitochondrial DNA, the ciscoes comprise two distinct, unrelated groups:
* The &quot;Coregonus artedi&quot; complex along with &quot;C. laurettae&quot; and &quot;C. autumnalis&quot; lineages
* The &quot;Coregonus sardinella&quot; complex, including &quot;C. peled&quot; and &quot;C. albula&quot;. This group is more closely related to the &quot;true whitefishes&quot; (e.g. the common whitefish &quot;C. lavaretus&quot;, lake whitefish &quot;C. clupeaformis&quot;) than to the &quot;C. artedi&quot; complex ciscoes.

<doc id="1191534" wikidata="Q533003" url="?curid=1191534" title="Ercole Consalvi">
<text>Ercole Consalvi (8 June 1757 – 24 January 1824) was a deacon and cardinal of the Catholic Church, who served twice as Cardinal Secretary of State for the Papal States and who played a crucial role in the post-Napoleonic reassertion of the legitimist principle of the divine right of kings, of which he was a constant supporter.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Consalvi was born in Rome, a descendant of the ancient noble family of the Brunacci of Pisa. The cardinal&#x27;s grandfather, Gregorio Brunacci, had taken the name and arms of the late Marquess Ercole Consalvi of Rome, as was required in order to inherit the large fortune the original Consalvi had left. 

Ercole was the son of Mario Giuseppe Consalvi, the Marquess of Toscanella, and Countess Claudia Carandini of Modena. At the death of his father in 1763, Ercole was entrusted to the care of Cardinal Andrea Negroni. He was educated at the college of the Piarists from 1771 to 1776. He then entered the seminary founded in Frascati by the English Cardinal Henry Benedict Stuart, who was also called Duke of York by Jacobites, thus often referred to as &quot;Cardinal York&quot;, and who was the Stuart pretender to the throne of Great Britain. He became a favorite of the Cardinal&#x27;s and was helped by him to obtain high office in the Roman Curia while still a young man.

At the completion of his seminary studies in 1776, Consalvi took minor orders, and was named a member of a congregation charged with the direction of municipal affairs. The years from 1776 to 1782 were devoted to the studies of jurisprudence and ecclesiastical history in the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in Rome, which trained students for the diplomatic corps of the Holy See. There he had among other professors the Jesuit scholar, Zaccaria. He then began studies in both civil and canon law at &quot;La Sapienza&quot; University, from which he received doctorates in both fields in 1789. He had become an official of the Papal Court in 1784, serving in various administrative offices (&quot;votante di segnatura&quot;; auditor of the Rota for Rome) for the next 14 years in Rome, where he was known as &quot;Monsignore Ubique&quot; on account of his taste for travelling and cultivating interesting people.

===Diplomat===
After the French Revolutionary Army invaded Italy in 1798, Consalvi was jailed in the Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo in connection with the death of General Duphot and condemned to deportation. As an &quot;enemy of the Roman Republic&quot; his property was confiscated. But he was soon released and joined Pope Pius VI in exile. An able diplomat, he was nominated after the death of that pope to be secretary of the conclave that met in Venice from November 1799 to March 1800 to choose his successor, and resulted in the election of Pope Pius VII.

Consalvi was created Cardinal-Deacon and named Cardinal Secretary of State by the new pope in the secret consistory of 11 August 1800, receiving the red hat from him in a public consistory on 14 August 1800. In this capacity Consalvi first endeavoured to restore better conditions in the Papal States. He introduced free trade, withdrew from circulation all depreciated money, and admitted a large number of laymen to Government offices.

On 20 October 1800, he was assigned the titular church of Sant&#x27;Agata dei Goti (later transferred to that of the Basilica of Santa Maria ad Martyres (Our Lady of the Martyrs), better known as the Pantheon, on 28 July 1817). In his new position of Secretary of State, he immediately left Rome for Paris in June 1801 to negotiate an understanding with the French, that resulted in the Catholic Church&#x27;s Concordat of 1801 with Napoleon. While not effecting a return to the old Christian order, the treaty did provide certain civil guarantees to the church, acknowledging &quot;the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman religion&quot; as that of the &quot;majority of French citizens&quot;. In Paris he enjoyed a considerable social success thanks to his personal charisma, to which even Napoleon was not immune. 

Consalvi was highly cultivated and a lifelong devotee of poetry, the arts and sciences, archaeology, and, in particular, music. He did much to embellish Rome and to make it an art-centre by designing public promenades along the Tiber, restoring the ancient monuments, and filling the museums with statues unearthed by excavations made under his direction. 

Consalvi was ordained to the subdiaconate and then to the diaconate on 20 and 21 December 1801, respectively. He was never elevated to the sacramental offices of priest or bishop. But he acted as virtual sovereign in Rome during the absence of Pius VII in Paris for the coronation of Napoleon as emperor.

Due to his firm stance against the Napoleonic government and his opposition to the participation of the Papal States in France&#x27;s Continental System, he was required to resign in June 1806 as Cardinal Secretary of State, from which he went on to serve in various functions of the Curia.

When the French entered Rome in 1808 and formally abolished the temporal power of the pope, Consalvi broke off all relations with the French. When France annexed the Papal States in 1809 and took the pope into exile in Savona, Cardinal Consalvi was forcibly taken to Paris. There he was met by Napoleon himself, who offered him an annual pension of 30,000 francs. This he refused. When he and twelve other cardinals refused to attend Napoleon&#x27;s marriage to Archduchess Marie Louise in 1810, they were stripped of their property and ecclesiastical status, becoming known as the &quot;black cardinals&quot;. Consalvi and the others were also forced to reside in various cities in France, in his case, Reims. This lasted until Pius VII signed the Concordat of Fontainebleau in January 1813. The cardinal was then allowed to leave his place of forced residence and joined the Pope. Consalvi then promptly persuaded Pius to retract the concessions he had made to Napoleon, which he began to do in March of that same year.

In consequence of his role in shifting Pius&#x27; position, the French authorities first barred Consalvi from seeing the Pope, then the following January again sent him into exile, this time in Béziers. This exile, however, lasted only a matter of weeks, as he was freed by the French government on 2 April 1814, shortly before Napoleon&#x27;s final abdication. He was then able to rejoin the Pope in Italy, at which time he was reappointed to the office of Secretary of State.

Cardinal Bartolomeo Pacca, who was kidnapped along with Pope Pius VII, took the office of Pro-Secretary of State in 1808 and maintained his memoirs during his exile. His memoirs, written originally in Italian, have been translated into English (two volumes) and describe the ups and down of their exile and the triumphant return to Rome in 1814.

==Policy of Papal Neutrality==
After the fall of Napoleon, he was papal plenipotentiary at the Congress of Vienna and was able to convince the victorious powers to restore the Papal States almost entirely (although the Papacy had been forced to accept the French annexation of the Comtat Venaissin). Pius VII and Consalvi realized that in the face of Metternich&#x27;s new international system, a neutral position for the pope might be a way for the increasingly marginalized Papal States to &quot;find relevance in a new system of bloc state power relationships&quot;. This position was first articulated by Consalvi at the time of the 1821 Neapolitan revolt. Consalvi wrote, &quot;The Holy Father, because of his position as Visible head of the Church, and as an essentially peaceful sovereign, will continue to maintain ...a perfect neutrality toward all nations&quot;. 

For the remainder of the pontificate of Pius VII, Consalvi was the virtual ruler of Rome. Consalvi went on to reform the administration of Rome and to some extent modernized the city. He was said to be so much in control of the pope that Pius would have to wait at the gates of paradise until the cardinal came from purgatory with the keys. He concluded another Concordat with France in 1817 and in 1818 was instrumental in the re-establishment of the English College. He retired when Pius died in 1823. At the time of his own death the following year, he headed the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith to which he had just been appointed a few days prior. Although a consummate diplomat and man of the world, Consalvi has been called &quot;one of the purest glories of the Church of Rome&quot;.

He secured the Protestant artist Thorvaldsen&#x27;s right to create the burial monument for Pope Pius VII in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome.

Consalvi died in 1824 and is buried in the Church of San Marcello al Corso.

<text>Byfield is a village and civil parish forming part of West Northamptonshire, England. The population (including Westhorp) of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 1,277.

== History ==
The villages name means &#x27;by the open land&#x27;. It has also been suggested that the first element is &#x27;river-bend&#x27;.

Byfield, with Westhorp, was mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;. It has been close to many of the important events in history. During the Wars of the Roses, in 1469 the battle of Edgecote took place, only three miles from Byfield. Likewise during the English Civil War, the battles of Edgehill in 1642 and Naseby in 1645 must have affected the local citizenry. In the Second World War the area around Byfield had numerous airfields and other military installations which would have had a considerable, and in some cases, long-lasting effect. One example of this is POW camp 87 which sits between Byfield and Upper Boddington, however the site is currently home to a scrap merchant; there are plans to convert the former camp into a recycling centre. 

Byfield once had a station on the Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway (later part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway), but this closed in April 1952. One of the platforms of the station is still visible on the original site, however it is heavily overgrown. The remains of the goods shed is still visible. Two of the three bridges are still in the village, one being on the Twistle and the other being on the main road towards Banbury on the A361. Byfield was also home to an ironstone railway; This railway closed in 1965 along with the SMJR network 

Byfield was also the home of British folk-rock singer-songwriter Sandy Denny, and her husband Trevor Lucas, from 1974 until her death in 1978. A number of Sandy&#x27;s demos issued since her death (most notably on the 2004 box set A Boxful of Treasures) were recorded at home in Byfield and in 2017 the BBC unveiled a plaque commemorating her last professional gig in Byfield Village Hall.

==Geography==
The village of Byfield is situated in the folds of the northern edge of the Cotswolds, in the south-western corner of Northamptonshire, some four miles east of the intersection with the boundaries of Oxfordshire and Warwickshire. Byfield also lies almost equidistant between Daventry to the north and Banbury to the south on the A361 road, each about nine to 10 miles distant. Northampton lies 19 miles east. Because of this geographic position, and the 50 mph speed limit in either direction, the residents of Byfield look to both Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire for fulfillment of many of their service needs. This is especially true of areas such as healthcare, shopping and major items of furniture, white goods, meals out, gym membership and the like.

==Governance==
Byfield has had a Parish Council continuously since 1894, and this continuity has meant that the parish is actively managed for the good of its residents.

==Demography==
Byfield has a population of around 1,200-1,250 (1,252 in the 2001 census), increasing to 1,277 at the 2011 census. 1,032 electors (2007 Electoral Register) plus children. The Parish still has a high level of agriculture, as it has some 10 or so working farms, although like all modern farming they employ very few people. The other areas of employment are the usual modern mix of commuting, self-employed and people who have locally based jobs, often part-time.

== Recreation ==
There are some 30 different clubs and organisations active in Byfield such as karate, over 60s club and the men&#x27;s breakfast club. Byfield has a large recreation ground, The Brightwell, which has bowls, cricket, football and tennis clubs as well as a children&#x27;s playground and other recreational space. The village hall is the venue for a number of weekly events as well as one-off theatres, shows, exhibitions, quiz evenings, dances, weddings, parties etc.

Byfield Village Club which was formerly known as Byfield Conservative Club has a membership of over 200 and is the venue for live music, social events and parties. There are active darts and skittles teams as well as a full-size snooker table in the upstairs games room. The Village Club is housed in a former school house; the building itself being several hundred years old. The club went out of business in early 2017 and the building is up for sale.

An active Scout Group exists in the village which was first founded in 1911. Today it provides activities for approximately 60 young people aged 6–14.

<text>The &quot;Malice at the Palace&quot; (also known as the Pacers–Pistons brawl) was a fight involving both players and fans that occurred during a National Basketball Association (NBA) game between the Indiana Pacers and the defending champion Detroit Pistons on November 19, 2004, at the Palace in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The Associated Press called it &quot;the most infamous brawl in NBA history&quot;.

Pistons center Ben Wallace attempted a layup shot but was fouled from behind by Pacers small forward Ron Artest. A furious Wallace then shoved Artest, and a fight broke out on the court between players from both teams. The players had been separated, game officials were discussing consequences, and Artest was lying on the scorer&#x27;s table pending an interview when a fan named John Green hit him with a drink thrown from several rows up in the stands.

Artest immediately charged into the crowd and grabbed another fan, Michael Ryan, whom he mistakenly believed was the culprit. Several Pacers teammates followed, more drinks and punches were thrown, and the incident escalated into a large brawl that spread from the stands to the court and involved fans and players from both teams. The game was never completed, as a massive police presence was called to the venue to restore order and, later, to allow the visiting Pacers to safely leave the building.

After the game, the NBA suspended nine players, including Artest and Wallace, for a total of 146 games, leading to the players losing $11 million in salary. Five players were charged with assault, and eventually sentenced to a year of probation and community service. Five fans also faced assault charges and were banned from attending Pistons home games for life. The fight also led the NBA to increase security between players and fans and limit the sale of alcohol at games.

==Background ==
The Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons had not met since the previous season&#x27;s Eastern Conference Finals, which the Pistons won in six games en route to their first NBA title since the &quot;Bad Boys&quot; era of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Coming off a two-game winning streak, the Pacers held a 6–2 record, while the defending champion Pistons had begun their season 4–3. The game was televised nationally on ESPN along with both teams&#x27; local broadcast affiliates, FSN Midwest and WDIV-TV.

The game, like many previous meetings between the two teams, was dominated by defense. The Pacers got off to a quick start, opening up a 20-point lead with seven minutes to go before halftime. The Pistons managed to cut into the lead, trailing by 16 points by halftime. The Pistons opened the third quarter with a 9–2 run, but the Pacers ended it with a buzzer-beating three-pointer and a layup from Jamaal Tinsley heading into the fourth quarter.

Richard Hamilton and Lindsey Hunter started the fourth quarter with consecutive three-point field goals, as the Pistons cut into the lead again, but Stephen Jackson&#x27;s back-to-back field goals gave the Pacers a 93–79 lead with 3:52 remaining, and essentially putting the game away. Despite the lopsided score near the end of the game, most key players on both teams remained in the game.

The Pacers were led by the 24-point effort of small forward Ron Artest, who scored 17 in the first quarter. Jermaine O&#x27;Neal notched a double-double with 20 points and 13 rebounds. Tinsley had 13 points, eight assists and a career-high eight steals. Hamilton led the Pistons with 20 points. Rasheed Wallace and Ben Wallace both recorded a double-double.

==Fight==

The brawl began with 45.9 seconds remaining in the final quarter of the game, when the Pacers led 97–82. Pistons center Ben Wallace was fouled from behind by Artest, who slapped him across the back of the head during a layup attempt. Wallace later said that Artest had warned him he would be hit. Wallace responded by shoving Artest in the face with both hands, causing players from both teams to quickly get in between them as they attempted to keep the two separated.

Pistons coach Larry Brown later said he was initially not concerned, because when altercations occur in NBA games, they usually last a few seconds. After breaking up the confrontation, referees discussed fouls and ejections before the game resumed. Sportscaster Mike Breen, calling the game for ESPN, believed Wallace would be ejected, while Bill Walton was of the opinion that Stephen Jackson should be ejected as well for shouting at the Pistons players and aggravating the situation. However, Breen expressed concern that, if Wallace got ejected, he would have to walk past the Pacers bench, which could have caused another incident.

As the referees huddled to discuss penalties, Artest went to the scorer&#x27;s table and lay down on it, putting on a headset to speak with Pacers radio broadcaster Mark Boyle, though the broadcast team did not activate his microphone. Boyle recalled that the broadcasting team knew Artest&#x27;s personality and &quot;there was no way we were going to put an open mic in front of Ron Artest in that situation&quot;. Pacers president Donnie Walsh later stated that Artest was following advice he had received on how to calm down and avoid trouble in a volatile situation.

Ninety seconds after Wallace shoved Artest, most of both teams&#x27; players and coaches were huddled at midcourt, attempting to calm down Wallace. Tayshaun Prince was the only player on either team to not leave the bench during the entire incident. Others became automatically eligible for one-game suspensions. While Artest was lying on the table, Wallace threw a towel at him, causing Artest to briefly stand up before being held back by coaches and fellow teammate Reggie Miller. A spectator, John Green, then threw a plastic cup of Diet Coke at Artest, hitting him in the chest. 

Artest immediately reacted to this by jumping off the table, charging into the stands, and grabbing another spectator, Michael Ryan, whom he mistakenly believed was responsible. Artest shouted at Ryan, &quot;Did you do it?&quot;, to which Ryan replied, &quot;No, man. No!&quot; Pacers play-by-play announcer Mark Boyle stood from his chair at the broadcast table in an attempt to hold back Artest and was knocked backwards and stepped on, suffering five fractured vertebrae and a gouge on his head. Afterwards, Artest apologized to Boyle and said he had not realized he had trampled him.

Jackson followed Artest into the stands and punched a fan, William Paulson, in the face in retaliation for the man throwing another drink in Artest&#x27;s face while he was being restrained by other spectators. Pacers players Eddie Gill, David Harrison, Reggie Miller (who did not play because of an injury), Fred Jones, and Jamaal Tinsley, the Pistons&#x27; Rasheed Wallace, and numerous personnel (including Pistons radio analyst and former player Rick Mahorn) also quickly entered the stands to get Artest and Jackson, and to break up the fighting. Green punched Artest twice in the head from behind, as did Ben Wallace&#x27;s brother, David. More fans then began throwing drinks, food, and other objects into the melee and some fans went on the court in the confusion.

As Artest walked out of the stands, he was confronted by two more fans, Alvin &quot;A.J.&quot; Shackleford and Charlie Haddad, who had gone down to the court. Artest punched Shackleford in the face, causing Haddad to intervene by pushing away Artest, before both fans fell over. While Haddad was on the floor, Anthony Johnson struck him in the back of the head. As Haddad stood up, Jermaine O&#x27;Neal punched him in the jaw after a running start, while slipping in liquid and falling backwards, causing witnesses Scot Pollard, ESPN sideline reporter Jim Gray, and Pistons executive Tom Wilson to briefly fear that O&#x27;Neal would kill Haddad.

William Wesley pulled Artest away from the fans, and Brown tried to calm Wallace. The scene became more chaotic as additional fans went onto the court and additional items were thrown, overwhelming arena security personnel as they tried to reestablish order. Although Auburn Hills police had plans to handle many disorders, and had three officers in the arena, they were unprepared for the possibility of players entering the stands or masses of fans going onto the court.

Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said, &quot;I felt like I was fighting for my life out there.&quot; One reporter who attempted to stop Tinsley from entering the stands recalled that the player &quot;went through me like I was butter&quot;, and NBA Commissioner David Stern, watching the game on television, recalled that he said, &quot;Holy [&quot;mouths a swear word&quot;].&quot; O&#x27;Neal later said, &quot;As bad as it looked on TV, it was at least 20 times worse in person.&quot; Pacers assistant coach Chuck Person compared the situation to being &quot;trapped in a gladiator-type scene where the fans were the lions and we were just trying to escape with our lives. That&#x27;s how it felt. That there was no exit. That you had to fight your way out.&quot; Players&#x27; children and others in the audience cried from fear and shock. Derrick Coleman stood near Brown and Brown&#x27;s ball boy son to protect them.

Referees ended the game with 45.9 seconds remaining, and awarded the Pacers with a 97–82 win. Pistons fans booed the Pacers players as they were escorted from the court by officials and security, and continued to throw beverages, popcorn and other objects (including a steel folding chair that nearly hit O&#x27;Neal) at them as they walked under the tunnel to the locker room. Brown tried to talk to the fans over the loudspeaker of the arena in an attempt to stop the debacle, but his pleas availed nothing, and he threw down the microphone in exasperation.

Pistons public address announcer John Mason implored the remaining crowd to leave the court and arena because the game was over, and pleaded with fans to not throw any objects or engage in fighting. No players from either team spoke to the media before leaving the arena. Eventually, police officers swarmed the arena, threatening to handcuff those who would not leave. Nine spectators were injured, and two were taken to the hospital.

In the Pacers&#x27; locker room, O&#x27;Neal and Carlisle nearly got into a fight, as O&#x27;Neal was upset that some coaches had tried to restrain players while they were defending themselves out on the court. After everyone calmed down, Artest asked Jackson, &quot;Jack, you think we going to get in trouble?&quot; Jackson replied, &quot;Are you serious, bro? Trouble? Ron, we&#x27;ll be lucky if we still have a freaking job!&quot; The conversation convinced an amazed Jackson and Pollard that Artest &quot;wasn&#x27;t in his right mind, to ask that question&quot;.

Auburn Hills police entered the locker room to make arrests, but the team rushed Artest onto the bus and refused to take him off. The police decided to protect the Pacers as they left the arena, delaying decisions about criminal charges and arrests until after reviewing videos of the incident. By the time the Pacers&#x27; team bus departed, dozens of police cruisers were stationed in the parking lot and lined the surrounding road.

==Charges==
===Suspensions===
On November 20, 2004, the NBA suspended Artest, Jackson, O&#x27;Neal, and Wallace indefinitely, saying that their actions were &quot;shocking, repulsive, and inexcusable&quot;. The following day, the NBA announced that nine players would be suspended for a total of what eventually became 146 games: 137 games for Pacers players and nine games for Pistons players. David Harrison was also seen fighting with fans, but the NBA stated that he would not be suspended because &quot;the incident occurred as the players were attempting to leave the floor&quot;.

Artest was given the longest suspension; he was suspended for the remainder of the 2004–05 NBA season, a suspension that eventually totaled 86 games (73 regular season and 13 subsequent playoff games), the longest suspension for an on-court incident in NBA history. The players suspended also lost in excess of US$11 million in salary due to the suspensions, with Artest alone losing almost US$5 million.

In the week following the announcement of the suspensions, the players&#x27; union appealed the suspensions of Artest, Jackson, and O&#x27;Neal, saying they thought that commissioner Stern had &quot;exceeded his authority&quot;. Jackson felt that despite losing millions the players were fortunate, as Stern could have expelled them from the league entirely.

A federal arbitrator upheld the full length of all suspensions, except that of O&#x27;Neal, which was reduced to 15 games. However, the NBA appealed the decision of the arbitrator to reduce O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s suspension in federal court, and on December 24, a judge issued a temporary injunction allowing O&#x27;Neal to play until a full hearing was held on the NBA&#x27;s appeal.

O&#x27;Neal played in two more games before the NBA&#x27;s case was brought before the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, New York, on December 30. The NBA argued that under the terms of the league&#x27;s Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), Stern had absolute authority to hand out suspensions and hear appeals for all on-court incidents. However, the judge ruled that because O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s behavior was an off-court incident, arbitration was allowed under the CBA and thus the arbitrator was within his rights to reduce the suspension. Despite O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s successful appeal, no further appeals were made to reduce Artest&#x27;s and Jackson&#x27;s suspensions.

===Legal charges===
Auburn Hills police obtained videotapes of media coverage of the fight. Green was identified by county prosecutor David Gorcyca, who had been his neighbor. On November 30, Palace Sports and Entertainment, the owner of the Pistons, banned Green and Haddad from attending any events at the Palace of Auburn Hills, including Pistons home games, and the DTE Energy Music Theatre revoked their season tickets and issued them refunds. Green had several previous criminal convictions, including counterfeiting, carrying a concealed weapon, felony assault, and three drunken driving convictions. He was on court-ordered probation from a DUI conviction at the time of the brawl.

In December 2004, five Pacers players and five Pistons fans (John Ackerman; John Green; Bryant Jackson; William Paulson; and David Wallace, Ben Wallace&#x27;s brother) were charged with varying levels of assault and battery. Indiana&#x27;s O&#x27;Neal, who also threw usher Melvin Kendziorski onto the scorer&#x27;s table when attempting to enter the stands, and Pistons fan/spectator Green, who Gorcyca said &quot;single-handedly incited&quot; the brawl by throwing the cup at Artest, were charged with two counts.

Artest, Harrison, Jackson, and Anthony Johnson were charged with one count of assault and battery each. Three of the fans, including David Wallace, received one count of the same charge. Bryant Jackson, who had prior criminal convictions, was charged with felony assault for throwing a chair, which nearly hit O&#x27;Neal during the brawl. Two fans, Haddad and Shackleford, who entered the court during the fight were charged with trespassing. All of the fans involved were banned from attending Pistons home games.

In March 2005, Bryant Jackson pleaded no contest to a felony assault charge for throwing the chair. In May 2005, he was sentenced to two years&#x27; probation and ordered to pay $6,000 in restitution. David Wallace was convicted, and sentenced to one year of probation and community service for punching Pacers player Fred Jones from behind.

All five players who were charged pleaded no contest to the charges. In September 2005, Artest, Jackson, and O&#x27;Neal were all sentenced to one year on probation, 60 hours of community service, a $250 fine, and anger management counseling. A week later, Harrison received the same sentence. In October 2005, Johnson, the last player to be charged, received a similar sentence. He was ordered to serve 100 hours of community service.

In March 2006, a jury found Green guilty on one count of assault and battery for punching Artest in the stands. They acquitted him of an assault charge for throwing the cup. In May 2006, Green was sentenced to 30 days in jail and two years&#x27; probation. In November 2006, the Pistons issued a letter to Green informing him that he was banned for life from attending any Pistons home games under orders from the NBA, and he would be subject to trespassing charges if he was found attending. In a revision from his initial punishment two years prior, the ban no longer extended to other events at the Palace.

==Aftermath==

===Public reaction===
Several NBA players and coaches said the brawl was the worst fight they had ever seen. Hockey player Chris Chelios, who attended the game with Kid Rock, described the fight as unbelievable. Pacers fans began to refer to their team as &quot;The Thugs&quot;. Pistons CEO Tom Wilson later stated that Artest&#x27;s action took away physical barriers, such as tables and benches, that normally separate fans and players, and &quot;Indianapolis Star&quot; reporter Mark Montieth made the statement: &quot;In a way, [Artest] provoked [the forthcoming assault] passively by lying down&quot;, even though Artest lying down was something he had done frequently to calm down. 

In the post-game commentary on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;NBA Shootaround&quot;, ESPN studio analysts blamed the Pistons&#x27; fans and not the players. John Saunders referred to the fans as &quot;a bunch of punks&quot;, and Tim Legler said that &quot;the fans crossed the line&quot;. Stephen A. Smith stated that, &quot;They should be ashamed of themselves and some of them [the fans] should be arrested as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&quot; Their commentary prompted ESPN vice president Mark Shapiro to place calls to host Saunders, as well as analysts Legler, Smith, and Greg Anthony, as Shapiro felt their commentary was biased. The following Tuesday, Shapiro stated, &quot;I wish the studio hadn&#x27;t laid the blame solely on the backs of the fans Friday night.&quot;

A significant portion of media criticism was directed at the Pistons fans. 46% of the voters in the SportsNation poll believed that the fans were to blame for the incident. Other commentators said that Artest and the other players involved were to blame.

===NBA reforms===
Some NBA teams immediately increased protection of players and arenas, while the NBA reminded teams of existing security procedures. The league imposed new security guidelines on February 17, 2005, for all of its arenas. These new policies included a size limit of for alcohol purchases, a hard cap of two alcoholic beverages per purchase for any individual person, and the discontinuation of alcohol sales after the end of the third quarter. The NBA also later ordered that each team put at least three security guards between the players and the fans.

===Events after the brawl===
The day following the brawl on November 20, 2004, another notorious incident of sports violence occurred at the 2004 Palmetto Bowl referred to as the Clemson–South Carolina football brawl, although unlike the Malice at the Palace, fans did not get involved. South Carolina and Clemson’s teams declined their bowl bids and received penalties from their respective conferences following the brawl. 

The Pacers and the Pistons played for the first time after the brawl on December 25 at the Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Indiana. The Pistons won 98–93 without incident. Neither Artest nor Jackson played due to their suspensions; O&#x27;Neal played in his first game back after the arbitrator reduced his suspension to 15 games.

On March 25, 2005, the Pacers played at the Palace for the first time since the brawl. The game was delayed 90 minutes after a series of bomb threats were aimed at the Pacers locker room, but the game eventually started after no explosives were found. Two of the key figures in the original incident missed the game, as Artest was still suspended and O&#x27;Neal had an injured shoulder. In the game, the Pacers stopped the Pistons&#x27; 12-game home winning streak with a 94–81 win.
In the 2005 NBA Playoffs, the Pistons entered as the second seed of the Eastern Conference, and the Pacers as the sixth. After the Pistons defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in five games, and the Pacers upset the third seed Boston Celtics in seven games, the two teams met in the second round. Although the Pacers went ahead two games to one, the Pistons clinched the series in six games with three straight wins. After eliminating Indiana, Detroit defeated the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals in seven games, then advanced to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs in seven games.

After serving his suspension of the rest of the 2004–05 season, Artest returned to the Pacers at the beginning of the . After playing 16 games, he demanded to be traded, and the Pacers put him on the injured list. The Pacers&#x27; Walsh said that Artest&#x27;s demands were &quot;the last straw&quot;, and many Pacers players who had fought in the brawl to help their teammate felt betrayed. Jackson later said, &quot;I put my career on the line for him, going into the stands and fighting ... I lost $3 million [but] there was no &#x27;thank you&#x27; or nothing.&quot; 

After more than a month of inactivity, the Pacers traded Artest to the Sacramento Kings for Peja Stojaković. Artest faced Ben Wallace for the first time after the fight in November 2006, and made his return to Detroit in January 2007. During the Kings&#x27; 91–74 loss to the Pistons, Artest was booed constantly, but there were no unusual incidents. After a year&#x27;s stop with the Houston Rockets in the 2008–09 season, Artest signed with the Los Angeles Lakers.

After winning his first NBA championship in , Artest apologized to Jackson and other Pacers for being &quot;so young and egotistical&quot;, stating &quot;sometimes I feel like a coward when I see those guys. I&#x27;m on the Lakers, but I had a chance to win with you guys. I feel almost like a coward.&quot; On September 16, 2011, Artest legally changed his name to Metta World Peace.

During the lockout-shortened , only one of the nine players who were suspended after the brawl was still with his original team: Ben Wallace, who signed with the Chicago Bulls as a free agent in 2006, later traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers, and rejoined the Pistons on August 7, 2009. Most of the players involved were traded to other teams, and since then, all of the players involved in the brawl have retired, with Artest being the last to do so in 2017. 

The Pistons advanced to four straight Eastern Conference Finals after the brawl, and six straight overall, making them the first team since the Lakers in the 1980s to advance to six straight conference finals though they only won the championship once in that streak. However, after losing to the Pistons in the 2005 playoffs, the Pacers failed to finish above .500 until the and missed the playoffs for four straight seasons from 2007 through 2010. Many Pacers from the 2004–05 season believe that the brawl and its consequences ruined a potential championship team, and that the referees did not assist the players well enough to be physically harmed by visitors.

On November 19, 2009, John Green, the fan who helped instigate the brawl, appeared on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;First Take&quot;, where he talked about the incident and the changes he had made since then. Green recounted that he had an alcohol problem at the time and had since made an effort to deal with that. He said that Artest had apologized to him several months earlier, and wished to work together in some type of community service in Detroit. On June 9, 2017, Artest (then known as Metta World Peace) appeared on &quot;The Rich Eisen Show&quot; and alluded to his friendship with Green. In a later interview, Artest revealed that Green had told him that he had thrown the drink at him after making a $50 bet with Ryan that he wouldn’t be able to hit Artest, and that Artest had charged Ryan because he had his hands up in celebration on winning the bet.

Almost four years after the incident, another similar incident happened also at the same arena, this time between the Los Angeles Sparks and the Detroit Shock (later the Tulsa Shock, now known as the Dallas Wings) of the WNBA. This gave it the nickname &quot;The Malice at The Palace II&quot;.

==Etymology==

The origin of the name Begusarai is subject to two primary etymological theories:

* Begum&#x27;s Sarai: Alternatively, it is suggested that the name originates from the combination of &quot;Begum&quot; (queen) and &quot;Sarai&quot; (inn). This theory proposes that a &quot;Begum&quot; from Bhagalpur regularly undertook a month-long pilgrimage to Simaria Ghat on the Ganges River, and the location of her temporary residence became known as Begum&#x27;s Sarai, eventually evolving into Begusarai.

<text>Beiuș (; ) is a city in Bihor County, Romania near the Apuseni Mountains. The river Crișul Negru flows through Beiuș, and the city administers a single village, Delani (&quot;Gyalány&quot;).

Between the late 18th and very early 20th centuries, Beiuș constituted one of the most important learning centres of the Romanian language in Crișana.

==Demographics==

At the 2011 census, the city had a population of 10,667; the ethnic structure of the population was: 89.8% Romanians, 7.3% Hungarians, 2.6% Roma, and 0.3% other. At the 2021 census, Beiuș had a population of 9,745; of those, 81.3% were Romanians, 5.03% Hungarians, and 4,88% Roma.

==History==
Beiuș&#x27;s earliest mention in recorded history was in the year 1263, where it was mentioned as being burned down during the Mongol invasion of 1241. After a period of Ottoman occupation, it was conquered in 1691 by the Habsburg Empire, as confirmed by the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699. After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the town was ruled by the Hungarian administration, until 1918.

After the collapse of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, and the declaration of the Union of Transylvania with Romania in December 1918, the Romanian Army took control of Beiuș in April 1919, during the Hungarian–Romanian War. The town officially became part of the territory ceded to the Kingdom of Romania in June 1920 under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon. During the interwar period, it became the seat of plasa Beiuș, in Bihor County. Following the administrative reform of 1950, the town became the seat of Beiuș Raion within Bihor Region (renamed Oradea Region in 1952 and Crișana Region in 1960). In 1968, the old territorial division into &quot;județe&quot; was reinstituted, and the town reverted to being part of Bihor County.

==Places to see==
Today, Beiuș is a peaceful place, combining few ethnicities and three times as many religions as in previous times. The city contains superb architectural edifices, including a few old churches and the &quot;Samuil Vulcan&quot; highschool, built in 1828, which obtained the &quot;National College&quot; designation in 1998. The city is a key point in reaching the Apuseni Mountains and their rich mines, or mountain resorts such as and Arieșeni through smaller but picturesque communities and villages like Budureasa and Vașcău. The nearby mountains are hosts to some of the most dense and spectacular limestone cave systems in the world. These caves contain remains of the extinct cave bear (&quot;Ursus speleus&quot;) and prehistoric humans, huge colonies of bats, subterranean lakes, striking calcareous formations and giant earthworms that live in the guano-flooded cave floor.

Beiuș has its own city museum which houses over 3,000 pieces. The museum exhibits reflect its natural history, military history and art, but most famous are its folkloric artifacts: peasant tools, pottery, garments and folk art gathered from the entire central and southern county of Bihor. The tunnels in the city are also famous, as they are believed to link together and act as escape routes used during the Medieval Age. Their construction began during the rule of Hungarian king Bela IV. The nearby landscape includes: agricultural hills with crops ranging from corn, wheat and potato to fruit orchards like apple, pears, plums and strawberries. A long stretch of wildlife depleted forest that is rich in flora begins in the north-east of the city. Industry is represented mainly through production of furniture and fashion destined for European markets. The nearby distillery and beverage factory of Sudrigiu also employs a large part of the city&#x27;s labour force.

Available or popular sports in or around Beiuș are: fresh water fishing (trout, catfish, carp, barbel, chub, dace, and at least a dozen other edible species), speleology (spelunking), soccer (Sunday soccer is a local ritual for all ages), skiing, snowboarding, sledding, tennis, hiking, camping, backpacking, and rock climbing. Hunting for species like: wild boar, roe deer, rabbit, pheasant, dove, partridge, and ducks (mainly mallards) is also popular.

==Sports==
Football is the most successful and loved sport in Beiuș, Bihorul Beiuș being the most representative team of the city, a club with a rather rich history, being founded in 1921.

<text>Colonel Sir Edward Talbot Thackeray (19 October 1836 – 3 September 1927) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

The son of Rev. Francis Thackeray and Mary Anne Shakespear, he was the first cousin of the novelist, William Makepeace Thackeray. He was educated at Marlborough College and Addiscombe Military Seminary.

Thackeray was 20 years old, and a second lieutenant in the Bengal Engineers, Bengal Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 16 September 1857 at Delhi, British India for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross 
He later achieved the rank of colonel, and was elected to the Athenaeum in 1876. Thackeray retired from the Army in 1888 and in 1898 he went to live in Italy where he spent the rest of his life.

His medal is currently displayed at the National Museum of Military History in Johannesburg, South Africa.

<doc id="1191599" wikidata="Q7694554" url="?curid=1191599" title="Teesdale">
<text>Teesdale is a dale, or valley, located principally in County Durham, North East England. It is one of the Durham Dales, which are themselves part of the North Pennines, the northernmost part of the Pennine uplands. 

The dale is named after its principal river, the Tees, which has its source below Cross Fell () in Cumbria. The upper dale is remote and high, but becomes gentler after it enters County Durham shortly downstream. The dale follows the river&#x27;s south-easterly course to Barnard Castle, at which point the landscape begins to flatten into the Tees Lowlands. The Cumbrian part of Teesdale was historically divided between Cumberland and Westmorland, and the County Durham area between the former and Yorkshire.

Large parts of Teesdale are within the North Pennines national landscape, and Upper Teesdale has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Parts of the local climate have been scientifically classified as &quot;Sub-Arctic&quot;, and snow has sometimes lain on Cross Fell into June.

==Geology==

Unusually for the Pennines, rock of igneous origin (the Whin Sill) contributes to the surface geology and scenery of Upper Teesdale. Around 295 million years ago upwelling magma spread through fissures and between strata in the earlier Carboniferous Limestone country rock. As it cooled (an event which is believed to have lasted 50 years) the rock contracted and caused itself to split into vertical columns. The heating of the limestone above the rock also caused it to be turned into a crumbly marble known as &quot;Sugar Limestone&quot;.

Economic deposits in Llandovery rocks include soft shales that were previously worked to be used as slate pencils.

More recently, Ice Age glacial activity shaped the valley, and much of the pre-glacial river course is now buried beneath glacial drift.

==Botany==

In places this impervious dolerite rock, with shallow soil above it, prevented the growth of scrub or trees: this enabled certain post-glacial Arctic / Alpine plants to survive here when elsewhere as a rule they were overgrown. The &quot;Sugar Limestone&quot; formed by thermal metamorphism of the limestone into which the Whin Sill was intruded also meets the requirements of some of these plants. Teesdale is famous among naturalists for the &quot;Teesdale Assemblage&quot; of plants found together here that occur widely separated in other locations, abroad or in the British Isles.

Part of Upper Teesdale near the Cow Green Reservoir is designated a National Nature Reserve; it contains the unique Teesdale Violet and the blue Spring Gentian as well as more common Pennine flowers such as rockrose, spring sandwort, mountain pansy, bird&#x27;s-eye primrose and butterwort. Hay meadows in the valley above High Force, some now carefully cultivated to ensure this, contain an extremely rich variety of flowering plants including globe flower, wood cranesbill and Early Purple Orchid. On the south bank of the Tees near High Force can be seen the largest surviving juniper wood in England.

==Geography==
Over ledges in the Whin Sill fall the famous waterfalls of High Force and Low Force and the cataract of Cauldron Snout. 
From the source to the Skerne, Teesdale&#x27;s principal town and most populous settlement is Barnard Castle, a historic market town. The area also includes the small town of Middleton-in-Teesdale and a number of villages, including Mickleton, Eggleston, Romaldkirk and Cotherstone. Middleton was a lead-mining centre, and plentiful traces of this industry can be seen round the adjoining slopes and side-valleys. On the south side of Teesdale is the Bronze Age burial site of Kirkcarrion. The other Durham Dales are on the northern side and to the south is the Yorkshire Dales, Swaledale with Richmond is the closest.

==Governance==
The dale was formerly divided into four with the north in the Darlington and Stockton wards and the south was in the Gilling and Langbaurgh wapentakes.

Both dales gave their names to the former Teesdale district and Weardale district of western County Durham. The south is within the historic county boundaries of the North Riding of Yorkshire, Startforth Rural District, it was transferred to ceremonial County Durham on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972. West Teesdale lies within the parliamentary constituency of Bishop Auckland (County Durham).

<doc id="1191600" wikidata="Q5287646" url="?curid=1191600" title="Document processing">
<text>Document processing is a field of research and a set of production processes aimed at making an analog document digital. Document processing does not simply aim to photograph or scan a document to obtain a digital image, but also to make it digitally intelligible. This includes extracting the structure of the document or the layout and then the content, which can take the form of text or images. The process can involve traditional computer vision algorithms, convolutional neural networks or manual labor. The problems addressed are related to semantic segmentation, object detection, optical character recognition (OCR), handwritten text recognition (HTR) and, more broadly, transcription, whether automatic or not. The term can also include the phase of digitizing the document using a scanner and the phase of interpreting the document, for example using natural language processing (NLP) or image classification technologies. It is applied in many industrial and scientific fields for the optimization of administrative processes, mail processing and the digitization of analog archives and historical documents.

==Background==
Document processing was initially as is still to some extent a kind of production line work dealing with the treatment of documents, such as letters and parcels, in an aim of sorting, extracting or massively extracting data. This work could be performed in-house or through business process outsourcing. Document processing can indeed involve some kind of externalized manual labor, such as mechanical Turk.

As an example of manual document processing, as relatively recent as 2007, document processing for &quot;millions of visa and citizenship applications&quot; was about use of &quot;approximately 1,000 contract workers&quot; working to &quot;manage mail room and data entry.&quot;

While document processing involved data entry via keyboard well before use of a computer mouse or a computer scanner, a 1990 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; regarding what it called the &quot;paperless office&quot; stated that &quot;document processing begins with the scanner&quot;. In this context, a former Xerox vice-president, Paul Strassman, expressed a critical opinion, saying that computers add rather than reduce the volume of paper in an office. It was said that the engineering and maintenance documents for an airplane weigh &quot;more than the airplane itself&quot;.

==Automatic document processing==
As the &quot;state of the art&quot; advanced, document processing transitioned to handling &quot;document components ... as database entities.&quot;

A technology called automatic document processing or sometimes intelligent document processing (IDP) emerged as a specific form of Intelligent Process Automation (IPA), combining artificial intelligence such as Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP) or Intelligent Character Recognition (ICE) to extract data from several types documents. Advancements in automatic document processing, also called Intelligent Document Processing, improve the ability to process unstructured data with fewer exceptions and greater speeds. 

=== Applications ===
Automatic document processing applies to a whole range of documents, whether structured or not. For instance, in the world of business and finance, technologies may be used to process paper-based invoices, forms, purchase orders, contracts, and currency bills. Financial institutions use intelligent document processing to process high volumes of forms such as regulatory forms or loan documents. ID uses AI to extract and classify data from documents, replacing manual data entry.

In medicine, document processing methods have been developed to facilitate patient follow-up and streamline administrative procedures, in particular by digitizing medical or laboratory analysis reports. The goal is also to standardize medical databases. Algorithms are also directly used to assist physicians in medical diagnosis, e.g. by analyzing magnetic resonance images, or microscopic images.

Document processing is also widely used in the humanities and digital humanities, in order to extract historical big data from archives or heritage collections. Specific approaches were developed for various sources, including textual documents, such as newspaper archives, but also images, or maps.

===Technologies===

If, from the 1980s onward, traditional computer vision algorithms were widely used to solve document processing problems, these have been gradually replaced by neural network technologies in the 2010s. However, traditional computer vision technologies are still used, sometimes in conjunction with neural networks, in some sectors.

Many technologies support the development of document processing, in particular optical character recognition (OCR), and handwritten text recognition (HTR), which allow the text to be transcribed automatically. Text segments as such are identified using instance or object detection algorithms, which can sometimes also be used to detect the structure of the document. The resolution of the latter problem sometimes also uses semantic segmentation algorithms.

These technologies often form the core of document processing. However, other algorithms may intervene before or after these processes. Indeed, document digitization technologies are also involved, whether in the form of classical or three-dimensional scanning. The digitization of 3D documents can in particular resort to derivatives of photogrammetry. Sometimes, specific 2D scanners must also be developed to adapt to the size of the documents or for reasons of scanning ergonomics. The document processing also depends on the digital encoding of the documents in a suitable file format. Furthermore, the processing of heterogeneous databases can rely on image classification technologies.

At the other end of the chain are various image completion, extrapolation or data cleanup algorithms. For textual documents, the interpretation can use natural language processing (NLP) technologies.

<text>John Thomas VC (10 May 1886 – 28 February 1954) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 31 years old, and a Lance-Corporal in the 2/5th Battalion, Prince of Wales&#x27;s (North Staffordshire Regiment), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.
On 30 November 1917 at Fontaine, France, Lance-Corporal Thomas saw the enemy making preparations for a counter-attack so with a comrade and on his own initiative decided to make a close reconnaissance. They went off in full view of the enemy and under heavy fire. His comrade was hit almost immediately, but Lance-Corporal Thomas went on alone and finally reached a building used by the enemy as a night post. He was able to see where their troops were congregating and after staying for an hour, sniping the enemy, returned with information of the utmost value, which enabled plans to be made to meet the counter-attack.

<text>George Thompson VC (23 October 1920 – 23 January 1945) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Thompson was born in Trinity Gask, Perthshire and educated at Portmoak Primary School and Kinross High School. After being apprenticed to a grocer in Kinross he joined the Local Defence Volunteers when the Second World War began. In January 1941 he joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, training as a ground crew wireless operator and serving in Iraq. He then volunteered for aircrew and was posted to RAF Bomber Command.

==Details of deed==
He was 24 years old and a Flight Sergeant in No. 9 Squadron when the deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 1 January 1945 in an attack on the Dortmund-Ems Canal, Germany, Lancaster bomber serial PD377, after releasing its bombs, was hit by two shells and a raging fire broke out. Flight Sergeant Thompson, who was the wireless operator, seeing that the mid-upper gun turret was ablaze, went at once through the smoke filled fuselage into the fire and exploding ammunition in the turret to help the gunner to a place of relative safety. He extinguished his burning clothing with his bare hands and in doing so sustained serious burns to his legs, hands and face.

He then went to the rear turret which was also ablaze and again used his already burnt bare hands to beat out flames on the gunner&#x27;s clothing. Then, despite his shocking state of burns and charred clothing, he returned through the burning fuselage to report to the pilot. The crippled aircraft finally crash-landed; the rear gunner survived and made a full recovery but the mid-upper gunner died. Flight Sergeant Thompson began to recover from his injuries in hospital but died of pneumonia three weeks later.

==Legacy==
Thompson&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed at the National War Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh Castle, Edinburgh, Scotland. George Thompson is commemorated on The Portmoak Parish War Memorial, which is located within the grounds of The Bishopshire Golf Club at Portmoak in the county of Perth &amp; Kinross, Scotland and on the Wall of Names at the international Bomber Command Centre, Lincoln

<text>KCMP (89.3 FM, &quot;89.3 the Current&quot;) is a radio station owned by Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) that broadcasts an adult album alternative (AAA) music format including a significant rotation of songs by local artists. Licensed to Northfield, Minnesota, and covering the Minneapolis-St. Paul market, the station&#x27;s studios are located at the MPR Broadcast Center on Cedar Street in downtown St. Paul, while its transmitter is located atop the Vermillion Highlands near Coates. The Current is also broadcast on stations in Rochester, Duluth-Superior, Pasadena-Los Angeles, translators around Minnesota, and online.

The Current, which has been broadcasting its AAA format since 2004, debuted after MPR purchased WCAL-FM, the radio station of St. Olaf College in Northfield, in 2004. St. Olaf had put WCAL-FM on the air in 1968 as an extension of WCAL, a part-time AM station established in 1922 and eventually shut down in 1991.

==Format==

The modern &quot;third service&quot; for MPR (the organization already operates &quot;news and information&quot; and classical music networks) programs a wide range of music. The KCMP &quot;anti-format&quot; was announced in December 2004, along with the station&#x27;s new program director Steve Nelson and music director Thorn Skroch. KCMP is modeled on noncommercial alternative stations established earlier, including KEXP (Seattle), KCRW (Los Angeles), the pioneering WXPN (Philadelphia),

==History==
===St. Olaf Era===
The station which would later become 89.3 FM began with physics experiments in 1918 when five students and a professor built a small radio transmitter at St. Olaf College, which used a wire antenna strung between the campus chapel and the college&#x27;s &quot;Old Main&quot; (the tallest nearby building). The college was issued a &quot;Technical and Training School&quot; license with the call sign 9YAJ for the experimental operations, which was picked up as far away as New Zealand. On May 6, 1922, the college was granted a broadcasting station license with the call sign WCAL. It would broadcast two programs per week during the school year at 770 kc. in the AM band. One notable achievement by the station in the next few years was the broadcast of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;As You Like It&quot;, apparently the first time a play had been broadcast on radio.

In 1924, a financial crunch meant that the station might be forced to close down. The St. Olaf senior class and local newspaper, The Northfield News, campaigned for donations. Money came in from across Minnesota and several nearby states. This made WCAL the first listener-supported station in the United States. From 1928-circa 1954, WCAL was entirely listener-supported and received no direct financial support from St. Olaf College. In 1949, the station&#x27;s card file held the names and addresses of over 60,000 donors. The station&#x27;s AM signal was heard as far as the western United States, Mexico, Florida, Alaska and Canada.

WCAL first experimented with FM broadcasts in 1948. Broadcasts on 89.3 FM were officially launched on October 1, 1967 as a sister to the established AM, which was one of the first radio stations in the state. A few years later in 1971, WCAL became one of 90 founding members of National Public Radio organized by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. WCAL-FM was operated by St. Olaf for over 37 years and was known as &quot;Classical 89.3&quot; later in its history, playing what many considered to be &quot;alternative&quot; classical music along with a variety of sacred music and religious programming.

Twenty-four-hour broadcasts began in 1984, and a new 100-kilowatt transmitter went on-air in 1991, meaning that the station could be picked up across most of the Twin Cities region (Northfield is on the southern edge of the area). The transmitter was placed on land owned by the University of Minnesota in exchange for WCAL turning over its time-share hours on 770 kHz, which had been shared with KUOM for many years. Because 770 kHz is an FCC-defined clear-channel frequency occupied by full-time station WABC in New York City, it could not be used by other stations at night; as daytime-only stations, WCAL and KUOM each broadcast an average of about six hours per day. The shutdown of WCAL allowed KUOM to broadcast the maximum amount of time allowed by the license.

WCAL&#x27;s radio format focused on European classical music radio programming and related musical genres. The &quot;Christmas at St. Olaf&quot; program was one of several annual events that were broadcast by the station. Over the years, the station regularly broadcast religious services, and expanded them into a number of different languages. Another first that WCAL takes credit for is the first play-by-play broadcast of a sporting event. The station eventually became affiliated with AMPERS, the independent public radio network in Minnesota.

===Sale of WCAL===
On August 11, 2004, St. Olaf College announced that it had decided to sell WCAL to enhance the institution&#x27;s endowment. At least eleven offers were reportedly received, but apparently only two were presented to the Board of Regents, including one from California-based EMF Broadcasting, a non-commercial religious broadcaster which originates the K-Love network.

St. Olaf announced in August that it had decided to sell WCAL to Minnesota Public Radio. MPR had made a bid for WCAL as early as 1971, shortly after NPR&#x27;s formation. The station was now even more attractive to MPR, as it was the most powerful noncommercial signal in the state that wasn&#x27;t a part of the MPR network. This prompted the formation of a group known as SaveWCAL that attempted to halt the sale to MPR. SaveWCAL argued that the station was a charitable trust held by St. Olaf, and the college should have at least asked a judge for permission to dissolve the trust before selling it to MPR. These efforts were unsuccessful.

The sale agreement for WCAL/KMSE was finalized by St. Olaf College and Minnesota Public Radio on Friday, November 19, 2004. The station ceased broadcasting from its Northfield studios at 10 p.m. two days later, and began simulcasting Minnesota Public Radio&#x27;s classical music stream. The two-day delay allowed for final broadcasts of Sunday religious services. A few WCAL employees were hired by MPR and some changes were made to MPR&#x27;s classical music service in an attempt to appeal to former WCAL listeners. On February 1, 2005, the WCAL call sign was sold by MPR to the student-run college radio station of California University of Pennsylvania. 

Continued activism from SaveWCAL, however, resulted in a state district court judge characterizing the transaction as an illegal sale of a charitable trust by an irresponsible trustee . SaveWCAL has since requested that the Minnesota Attorney General&#x27;s office declare the sale void and filed a Petition To Redress Breach of Trust in Rice County District Court on September 24, 2008. However, in 2009, another court ruled that SaveWCAL had waited too long to go to court.

===The Current===
MPR launched the new format at 9 a.m. on January 24, 2005, changing the call sign in the process. &quot;Say Shh&quot;, by the Minneapolis-based hip-hop group Atmosphere, was the first song to air under the KCMP banner. The station had an immediate impact, and after just three months, was voted &quot;Best Radio Station&quot; by readers of the local &quot;City Pages&quot; alternative weekly newspaper. However, a March 2008 &quot;City Pages&quot; article criticized the Current for repetitious programming and losing touch with the format that endeared listeners during its first two years.

==HD Radio and Web Streaming==
KCMP is licensed by the FCC to broadcast in the HD Radio format.

The Current operates several other music services, including &quot;Purple Current&quot;, which offers music inspired by Prince and music that likely inspired him; The Siren (women&#x27;s music and content); Local Current, focusing on Minnesota-made music; Radio Heartland (Americana and roots music); and Rock The Cradle, a children&#x27;s music stream. On June 16, 2022, the Current debuted another streaming service, &quot;Carbon Sound&quot;, focusing on black music including hip-hop, R&amp;B, afrobeat, and related genres. The new service streams online and is available on the HD 2 subchannel of KCMP.

==Notable presenters==
* Mary Lucia
* Steve Seel
* Mark Wheat (January 2005 – June 2, 2020)

==Broadcast reach==
The Current is heard on 89.3 FM in the Twin Cities metro area, reaching into western Wisconsin. The service is also heard on 88.7 FM KMSE in Rochester and in Duluth on KZIO at 104.3 MHz and 94.1 MHz. In addition, it is carried on an APM-managed station, KPCC in Pasadena, California via an HD Radio subchannel of that station. Additional translators have been periodically added in other cities. The Current&#x27;s programming originates from St. Paul; the other stations break away during one-minute windows throughout the day for local underwriting and weather, along with legal IDs at the top of each hour. KZIO has a small amount of locally-originated content.

<doc id="1191676" wikidata="Q105338" url="?curid=1191676" title="Geert Wilders">
<text>Geert Wilders (; born 6 September 1963) is a Dutch politician who has led the right-wing to far-right Party for Freedom (PVV) since he founded it in 2006. He is also the party&#x27;s leader in the House of Representatives. Wilders is best known for his right-wing populism, anti-immigration, opposition to Islam and Euroscepticism. His views have made him a controversial figure in the Netherlands and abroad. Since 2004, he has been protected at all times by armed police.

Raised a Roman Catholic, Wilders left the church at his coming of age. His travels to Israel and the Arab world as a young adult significantly helped form his political views. Wilders worked as a speechwriter for the conservative-liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD); he later served as parliamentary assistant to party leader Frits Bolkestein from 1990 to 1998. He was elected to the municipal council of Utrecht in 1997. The following year he was elected to the House of Representatives. Citing irreconcilable differences over the party&#x27;s position on the accession of Turkey to the European Union, he left the VVD in 2004 to form his own party, the Party for Freedom. 

Wilders has campaigned to stop what he views as the &quot;Islamisation of the Netherlands&quot;. He has compared the Quran to &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and has campaigned to have the book banned in the Netherlands. He advocates ending immigration from Muslim countries, and banning the construction of new mosques. His controversial 2008 film featuring his views on Islam, &quot;Fitna&quot;, received international attention and extreme criticism. He has been described in the media as populist and as a far-right politician. He was also described by the media as an Islamophobe. Wilders rejects being labelled as far-right and views himself as a right-wing liberal, saying he does not want to be &quot;linked with the wrong rightist fascist groups&quot;.

On 4 September 2020, a Dutch court convicted Wilders for group insults, following comments he made about Moroccans in the Netherlands.

== Early life and career ==
Wilders was born on 6 September 1963 in the city of Venlo, in the province of Limburg. He is the son of Johannes Henricus Andreas Wilders and Anne Maria (Ording) Wilders. He is the youngest of four children, and was raised Catholic. His father was Dutch; his mother Maria Anne Ourding was born at Sukabumi, the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) with a mixed Dutch and Indonesian background. His father worked as a manager for the printing and copying manufacturing company Océ, and had hidden from the Germans during the Second World War, an experience so traumatizing that he refused to physically enter Germany even forty years later.

Wilders received his secondary education at the Mavo and Havo middle school and high school in Venlo. Reflecting passions that came to the fore later in his career, Wilders took a course in health insurance at the Stichting Opleiding Sociale Verzekeringen in Amsterdam and earned several law certificates at the Dutch Open University.

Wilders&#x27; goal after he graduated from secondary school was to see the world. Because he did not have enough money to travel to Australia, his preferred destination, he went to Israel instead and volunteered for a year in a &quot;moshav&quot;, Tomer, on the West Bank. With the money he saved, he travelled to the neighbouring Arab countries, and was moved by the lack of democracy in the region. When he returned to the Netherlands, he retained Israeli ideas about counter-terrorism and a &quot;special feeling of solidarity&quot; for the country.

Living in Utrecht, Wilders initially worked in the health insurance industry. His interest in the subject led him into politics as a speech-writer for the Netherlands&#x27; People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). He started his formal political career as a parliamentary assistant to the party leader Frits Bolkestein, specialising in foreign policy. He held this job from 1990 to 1998. During this time Wilders travelled extensively, visiting countries all across the Middle East, including Iran, Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Israel. Bolkestein was the first Dutch politician to address the consequences of mass immigration for Dutch society, including a sharp criticism of Muslim immigrants. He set an example for Wilders not only in his ideas but also in his confrontational speaking style. Political analyst Anno Bunnik later described Wilders as a &quot;sorcerer&#x27;s apprentice&quot; to Bolkestein.

== Political career ==
In 1997, Wilders was elected for the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) to the municipal council of Utrecht, the fourth largest city of the Netherlands. He lived in Kanaleneiland, a suburb with cheap social housing and high apartment blocks, which has a relatively high number of immigrants. While a city councilor, Wilders was mugged in his own neighbourhood; some have speculated that this may have catalysed his political transformation.
A year later, he was elected to the Netherlands&#x27; national parliament, but his first four years in parliament drew little attention. However, his appointment in 2002 as a public spokesman for the VVD led Wilders to become more well known for his outspoken criticism of Islamic extremism. Tensions immediately developed within the party, as Wilders found himself to be to the right of most members, and challenged the party line in his public statements. He was expelled from the VVD parliamentary party, and in September 2004, Wilders left the VVD, having been a member since 1989, to form his own political party, Groep Wilders, later renamed the Party for Freedom. The crunch issue with the VVD party line was about his refusal to endorse the party&#x27;s position that European Union accession negotiations must be started with Turkey.

The Party for Freedom&#x27;s political platform often overlaps those of the assassinated Rotterdam politician Pim Fortuyn and his Pim Fortuyn List. After his death, Fortuyn&#x27;s impact remained, as more and more politicians sought to gain political mileage by directly confronting topics such as a ban on immigration that were, from a politically correct point of view, considered unmentionable in the Netherlands until Fortuyn came on the scene and upended the Dutch tradition of consensus politics with an anti-immigration stance. Wilders would position himself to inherit Fortuyn&#x27;s constituency. The Party for Freedom called for a €16 billion tax reduction, a far stricter policy toward recreational drug use, investing more in roads and other infrastructure, building nuclear power plants and including animal rights in the Dutch constitution. In the 2006 Dutch parliamentary election, their first parliamentary election, the Party for Freedom won 9 out of the 150 seats.

Polling conducted throughout March 2009 by Maurice de Hond indicated the Party for Freedom was the most popular parliamentary party. The polls predicted that the party would take 21% of the national vote, winning 32 out of 150 seats in the Dutch parliament. If the polling results were replicated in an election, Wilders would be a major power broker. Under such circumstances, there would also be some likelihood of him becoming Prime Minister of the Netherlands. This has been partially attributed to timely prosecution attempts against him for hate speech and the travel ban imposed on him by the United Kingdom, as well as dissatisfaction with the Dutch government&#x27;s response to the global financial crisis of 2008–2009.
The PVV only contested the March 2010 municipal elections in The Hague and Almere, because of a shortage of good candidates. The big gains that were scored indicated that the party and Wilders might dominate the political scene in the run-up to the parliamentary elections scheduled on 9 June 2010. The PVV won in Almere and came second to the Dutch Labour party in The Hague. In Almere, the PVV won 22 percent of the vote to Labour&#x27;s 18 percent. In The Hague, the PVV had 8 seats – second to Labour with 10 seats.

On 8 March 2010, Wilders announced that he would take a seat on the Hague city council, after it became clear he won 13,000 preference votes. Earlier he had said he would not take up a seat if he won.

In the parliamentary elections on 9 June 2010, the PVV increased its number of seats from 9 to 24 (out of 150), getting 15.5% of the vote. This made the PVV the third party in size. With a fragmented parliament, at least three parties were required for an absolute majority. A coalition of VVD and Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) was negotiated with parliamentary support by the PVV. The PVV did not become part of the government formed by VVD and CDA but actively participated in the negotiations and thus policy decisions and – as part of the outcome agreed that they would not support any motion to dismiss ministers concerning topics listed in a so-called &quot;support agreement&quot; – much like the Danish model where the Danish People&#x27;s Party had played a similar role.

On 21 April 2012, Wilders withdrew his support from the Rutte cabinet because of new austerity measures that were about to be taken. Commenting on his withdrawal Wilders blamed the &quot;European dictates&quot; pointing to the 3% rule on budget deficit for European countries although his party had supported these rules earlier on. The cabinet blamed Wilders for what they call his &quot;lack of political will&quot; and &quot;political cowardice&quot; in regards to addressing the economic woes of the Netherlands. Wilders&#x27; withdrawal from the negotiations led to new elections in September. Wilders and the PVV ran on a campaign to have the Netherlands withdraw from the European Union and for a return to the guilder. The PVV won 10.1% of the vote and 15 seats in parliament, a loss of 9 seats.

In the March 2014 local elections, Wilders&#x27; Party for Freedom only took part in two municipalities, The Hague and Almere, and suffered minor losses in both. Nevertheless, international news coverage of the elections was dominated by Wilders after he led his supporters in a provocative chant (calling for &quot;fewer, fewer ... Moroccans&quot;) at an election night party rally. This eventually led to a new trial against him (see ).

In the May 2014 elections for the European Parliament, the Party for Freedom received 17.0% of the vote and four seats, a slight gain compared to the 13.3% of the vote the party had received in the previous parliamentary elections. In the run-up to and aftermath of those European elections, Wilders worked with the French Front National&#x27;s Marine Le Pen to try to form a new parliamentary group in the European Parliament. They first announced their collaboration during a joint press conference in November 2013, where Wilders vowed that &quot;today is the beginning of the liberation from the European elite, the monster in Brussels&quot;. Wilders visited the Sweden Democrats party and spoke with the Austrian Freedom party&#x27;s leader Heinz-Christian Strache to help bring about the alliance, even while rejecting Hungary&#x27;s Jobbik and Germany&#x27;s NPD because he wanted to exclude &quot;right-wing extremist and racist&quot; parties. Three days after the elections finished, Le Pen and Wilders presented another press conference, this time with Matteo Salvini of Italy&#x27;s Northern League, Harald Vilimsky of Austria&#x27;s Freedom Party and Gerolf Annemans of Belgium&#x27;s Flemish Interest party, to promise that the parliamentary group would be formed. Eventually, however, the effort failed because it could only unite parties from six EU member states, one fewer than is required by parliamentary rules. This was in part due to a refusal to include the Greek Golden Dawn or Poland&#x27;s Congress of the New Right, and in part because parties like the Danish People&#x27;s party and the True Finns refused to join.

In the March 2015 provincial elections, the Party for Freedom received 11.7% of the vote nationally, slipping slightly from the 12.4% of the vote it had gotten in the 2011 provincial elections.

The PVV contested the 2017 general election with Wilders at its helm. Although the PVV led other parties in opinion polls most of the time, all major parties ruled out forming coalitions with the PVV, effectively locking it out from any chance of taking part in, let alone leading, the next government. This raised the prospect of the PVV being locked out of power even if it won the most seats. Wilders hinted that a &quot;revolution&quot; would occur if his party won the most seats and was still shut out of government.

The PVV ended up achieving second place after winning 20 seats, five more than in 2012.

In the 2021 Dutch general election the PVV received 10.79% of the total votes cast. This earned them 17 seats in the House of Representatives. Responding to reporters who asked what his reaction was to the election results, Wilders attributed the loss of three seats to a recent lack of important events involving Islam and immigration.

In January 2021, it was revealed by OpenSecrets that American Robert J. Shillman paid nearly $214,000 in 2017 to help Wilders pay for his successful legal defence in an indictment for hate speech against Muslims in general and Moroccans in particular. Wilders has included the points of views of this financier in his election manifesto.

=== Schoof cabinet ===
In the run-up to the 2023 Dutch general election on 22 November 2023, migration was the dominant theme. During the campaign, the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) did not rule out the possibility of forming a coalition with the Wilders&#x27; party, the PVV. Wilders positioned the PVV, previously perceived by a significant portion of the population as a right-wing radical party, as a centrist party with a clear stance on migration. In the week preceding the election day, Wilders took a more moderate tone and expressed willingness to set aside incompatible PVV themes. 

In the 2023 Dutch general election, the PVV won a quarter of the seats and became the largest party in the House of Representatives. The results of the election were described as &quot;one of the biggest political upsets in Dutch politics since World War II&quot;. 

During subsequent cabinet formation talks, Wilders announced that he was withdrawing his bid to become prime minister, citing a lack of support from potential coalition partners. The next day, he described his withdrawal as unfair and &quot;constitutionally wrong&quot;. The Party for Freedom (PVV) entered a coalition government with the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), New Social Contract (NSC), and the Farmer–Citizen Movement (BBB). Dick Schoof was selected to serve as prime minister, and his cabinet was sworn in on 2 July 2024. Wilders had initially proposed Ronald Plasterk for the position, but he withdrew over integrity concerns. The coalition parties called their migration policy the most stringent and extensive in history, and the agreement included plans to declare an asylum crisis, bypassing initial parliamentary approval. As questions surrounding the plan&#x27;s legal viability prompted NSC to become critical, Wilders stressed that the cabinet would be in trouble if no emergency law was enacted. Schoof facilitated negotiations between the coalition parties, and an agreement on asylum measures was reached in October 2024, which excluded the use of emergency powers.

In December 2024, Wilders visited Israel, where he toured an Israeli settlement in the West Bank and met with President Isaac Herzog and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The trip came weeks after the International Criminal Court (ICC) had issued an arrest warrant against Netanyahu and defence minister Yoav Gallant, which Wilders criticized, saying that &quot;the world has gone mad&quot;. Dutch foreign affairs minister Caspar Veldkamp commented that meeting with leaders of illegal settlements would violate the coalition agreement.

== Political positions ==

Wilders generally considers himself to be a right-wing liberal, with a specific mix of positions independent of the European political spectrum and peculiar to iconoclastic Dutch society. He has stated, &quot;My allies are not Le Pen or Haider ... We&#x27;ll never join up with the fascists and Mussolinis of Italy. I&#x27;m very afraid of being linked with the wrong rightist fascist groups&quot;, adding that his drive instead is such issues as freedom of expression and Dutch iconoclasm. Wilders views British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as his greatest political role model. People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy figure Frits Bolkestein also heavily influenced his beliefs. On foreign relations, Wilders has largely supported Israel and has criticized countries he perceives as enemies of Israel.

While best known for his anti-Islam views, Wilders had not yet developed these views as of 2001 when he spoke against Pim Fortuyn and said &quot;I have said from the beginning: Islam, there is nothing wrong with that, it is a religion to be respected. Most Muslims in the world, but also in the Netherlands, are good citizens and there is nothing wrong with that. It&#x27;s about that little bit of Muslim extremism.”

=== Domestic principles ===
Wilders strongly opposes the Dutch political system in general. He believes that there is a ruling elite of parliamentarians who only care about their own personal careers and disregard the will of the people. He also blames the Dutch system of multiparty coalition governments for a lack of clear and effective policies. In his view, Dutch society advocates rule by consensus and cultural relativism, while he believes that this should change so as &quot;not [to] tolerate the intolerant&quot;.

Wilders often mentions Henk and Ingrid in his speeches, fictitious ordinary Dutch subjects for whom he claims to work. Henk and Ingrid represent &quot;the Average Joe&quot; in Dutch political parlance, the &quot;heart and backbone of Dutch society&quot;. They have been compared to Joe the Plumber in Dutch media (though &quot;Joe&quot; is a real person). Henk and Ingrid live in a Vinex neighbourhood, have two school-attending children and a median income; both work outside the home. They used to vote for the PvdA but now vote for the PVV.

He has made some proposals in the Dutch Parliament inspired by Israeli policies: for example, he supports implementing Israeli-style administrative detention in the Netherlands, a practice heavily criticized by human rights groups but which Wilders calls &quot;common sense&quot;. Wilders has also revived the old idea of reuniting Flanders with the Netherlands. In a 2023 tweet and jibe against D66, Wilders wrote about the present Netherlands:

;&quot;Klare Wijn&quot;
Wilders published the version of his political manifesto called &quot;Klare Wijn&quot; (&quot;Clear Wine&quot;) in March 2006. The program proposed the implementation of ten key points:
* Considerable reduction of taxes and state regulations;
* Replacement of the present Article 1 of the Dutch constitution, guaranteeing equality under the law, by a clause stating the cultural dominance of the Christian, Jewish and humanist traditions;
* Reduction of the influence of the European Union, which may no longer be expanded with new member states, especially Turkey; the European Parliament would be abolished; Dutch financial contributions to the European Union would be reduced by billions of euros;
* A five-year moratorium on the immigration of non-Western foreigners who intend to stay in the Netherlands; foreign residents no longer would have the right to vote in municipal elections;
* A five-year moratorium on the founding of new mosques and Islamic schools and a permanent ban on preaching in any language other than Dutch; foreign imams would not be allowed to preach; radical mosques would be closed, and radical Muslims would be expelled;
* Restoration of educational standards, with an emphasis on the educational value of the family;
* Introduction of binding referendums and elected mayors, chiefs of police, and prime ministers;
* Introduction of minimum criminal penalties and higher maximum penalties; introduction of administrative detention for terror suspects; street terrorism would be punished by boot camps and denaturalisation and deportation of immigrant offenders;
* Restoration of respect and better compensation for teachers, policemen, health care workers, and military personnel;
* Instead of complicated reorganisation, a more accessible and humane health care system, especially for elderly citizens.

=== Views on Islam ===
Wilders is best known for his criticism of Islam, summing up his views by saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t hate Muslims, I hate Islam&quot;. His brother Paul claimed in an interview that, in his private affairs, Wilders has no problems with Muslims. Although identifying Islamic extremists as 5–15% of Muslims, he argues that &quot;there is no such thing as &#x27;moderate Islam and that the &quot;Koran also states that Muslims who believe in only part of the Koran are in fact apostates&quot;. He suggests that Muslims should &quot;tear out half of the Koran if they wished to stay in the Netherlands&quot; because it contains &quot;terrible things&quot; and that Muhammad would &quot;... in these days be hunted down as a terrorist&quot;. Wilders argues that Islam is not a religion, but rather a totalitarian political ideology such as communism and fascism.

On 8 August 2007, Wilders opined in an open letter to the Dutch newspaper &quot;De Volkskrant&quot; that the Koran, which he called a &quot;fascist book&quot;, should be outlawed in the Netherlands, like Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. He has stated that &quot;The book incites hatred and killing and therefore has no place in our legal order&quot;. He has also referred to Mohammed as &quot;the devil&quot;. In September 2009, Wilders proposed putting what he called a &quot;head rag tax&quot; on Hijab wearing by Muslim women; he suggested that women could purchase a license for €1000 and that the money raised could be used in projects beneficial to women&#x27;s emancipation.

He believes that all Muslim immigration to the Netherlands should be halted and all settled immigrants should be paid to leave. Referring to the increased population of Muslims in the Netherlands, he has said: 

In a speech before the Dutch Parliament, he stated: 

Nonetheless, Wilders has traveled widely in the Arab world and &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; has stated that Wilders will &quot;wax poetic&quot; over those &quot;magnificent countries&quot;. Wilders has also said that &quot;It&#x27;s a real shame that these places are so chaotic.&quot;

After the Dutch parliament turned down his request for an exhibition of cartoons depicting Muhammad be shown in parliament, Wilders vowed to show cartoons depicting him on television during time reserved for political parties.

After the November 2015 Paris attacks, Wilders, in an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, argued for a national referendum in the Netherlands to decide about the refugee crisis.

==== &quot;Fitna&quot; ====

&quot;Fitna&quot; is a 2008 short film written and commissioned by Wilders that explores Koranic-inspired motivations for terrorism, Islamic universalism, and Islam in the Netherlands. Its title comes from the Arabic word &quot;fitna&quot;, which means a &quot;test of faith in times of trial&quot;, or refers to a situation where one&#x27;s faith is tested.

It was the subject of an international controversy and debate on free speech, and drew condemation from Arabs. Despite the legal troubles surrounding the film, Wilders insists that before he released it, he consulted numerous lawyers in the field, who found nothing worth prosecution. The kingdom of Jordan has summoned Wilders to court, with the film deemed to &quot;incite hatred&quot;. Militant Sunni Islamist group Al-Qaeda issued a call to murder Wilders after its release.

=== Views on the European Union ===
Wilders is eurosceptic. In 2013, he along with Marine Le Pen teamed up in the European Parliament campaigning against the EU and the single currency, with Wilders calling the EU the &quot;monster in Brussels&quot;. He added &quot;We want to decide how we control our borders, our money, our economy, our currency.&quot; In a publicity stunt in 2014, Wilders vandalised the Flag of Europe with scissors in front of the Parliament in Brussels.

After the 2016 referendum in Britain, Wilders praised the result for the Brits and noted that the Netherlands should do the same; in a statement he said: &quot;The Party for Freedom consequently demands a referendum on NExit, a Dutch EU exit&quot;. During Dutch general and European elections, Wilders has campaigned for the right for the Dutch public to vote in a Nexit referendum on EU membership and has included this point in PVV election manifestos since the 2012 Dutch general election. Following the 2023 Dutch general election in which the PVV emerged as the largest party, Wilders stated that while he was still opposed to the European Union, he had suspended his call for Nexit during coalition talks with other political parties and would instead use his position to roll back and dismantle the powers of the EU from the inside.

=== Views on Israel and Palestine ===
Wilders lived in Israel for two years during his youth and has visited the country 40 times in 25 years, as of 2006. Wilders stated about Israel: &quot;I have visited many interesting countries in the Middle East – from Syria to Egypt, from Tunisia to Turkey, from Cyprus to Iran – but nowhere did I have the special feeling of solidarity that I always get when I land at Ben Gurion International Airport.&quot; Dutch public TV channel Nederland 2&#x27;s daily news programme &quot;Netwerk&quot; reported that numerous American supporters of Israel financially supported Wilders&#x27; Party for Freedom (PVV) and openly approved of his message towards Islam and Islamic terrorism. Wilders told an audience during the report that &quot;We [in the West] are all Israel&quot;. He has also said &quot;Israel is the West&#x27;s first line of defence&quot; against what he perceives to be a threat posed by Islam.

Following the 2010 Dutch general election, in which the PVV was the third biggest party, Wilders said Jordan should be renamed Palestine. The Jordanian government responded saying Wilders&#x27; speech was reminiscent of the Israeli right wing. His speech said &quot;Jordan is Palestine. Changing its name to Palestine will end the conflict in the Middle East and provide the Palestinians with an alternate homeland.&quot; He also said Israel deserves a special status in the Dutch government because it was fighting for &quot;Jerusalem&quot; in its name. &quot;If Jerusalem falls into the hands of the Muslims, Athens and Rome will be next. Thus, Jerusalem is the main front protecting the West. It is not a conflict over territory but rather an ideological battle, between the mentality of the liberated West and the ideology of Islamic barbarism. There has been an independent Palestinian state since 1946, and it is the kingdom of Jordan.&quot;

He called on the Dutch government to refer to Jordan as Palestine and move its embassy to Jerusalem. In December 2010, Wilders urged Israel to build more Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and subsequently annex the West Bank so that Israel could establish defensible borders. He blamed Arab countries for the suffering of Palestinian refugees and called on Jordan to open its borders to Palestinians.

The Dutch Intelligence Service (AIVD) investigated Wilders in 2009–2010 for his &quot;ties to Israel and their possible influence on his loyalty.&quot;

Wilders condemned Hamas&#x27;s October 2023 attack on Israel. After the attacks, he displayed an Israeli flag in his office alongside the Dutch one. During an election debate in October 2023, he criticized the Dutch government for not taking action against pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel protests. He once again reiterated his &quot;Jordan is Palestine&quot; comment.

=== Views on Russia and Ukraine ===
In 2016, Wilders described Vladimir Putin as a &quot;true patriot&quot; and an ally in the war against Islamic terrorism. In 2016, he opposed the Association Agreement between the European Union and Ukraine.

In November 2017, Wilders said there was &quot;hysterical Russophobia&quot; in the Dutch government that he wanted to counter. However, the PVV insisted on punishing the perpetrators of the downing of flight MH17. On 28 February 2018, four years after Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea, Wilders traveled to Moscow and met with senior Russian officials in the Duma. His trip sparked sharp criticism among relatives of Dutch victims of the MH17 disaster, who accused him of disregarding Moscow&#x27;s involvement in the tragedy. On 27 February 2018, Wilders tweeted, &quot;Russia. Moscow. Duma. Stop the Russiaphobia. It&#x27;s time for Realpolitik. Partnership instead of enmity!&quot;

On 24 February 2022, the day the Russian invasion of Ukraine started, Wilders tweeted &quot;Do not let Dutch households pay the price for a war that is not ours.&quot; Wilders and PVV backed an unsuccessful motion to declare Dutch neutrality in February 2022 and to end sanctions on Russia in June 2022. He linked sanctions against Russia with rising inflation and the energy crisis. In March 2022, Wilders tweeted, &quot;I have sympathy for the Ukrainians, but I have been elected by the 1 million Dutch people who have voted for me.&quot; He would temporarily accept a limited number of Ukrainian refugees and support European states accepting refugees from Ukraine.

Later in 2022, Wilders and the PVV verbally condemned the Russian invasion, although in 2023, Wilders argued against military aid to Ukraine. According to the PVV&#x27;s electoral manifesto, &quot;The Russian aggressor has unlawfully invaded Ukraine. But we do not send our money and defence equipment such as F16s to Ukraine but keep it for our own Armed Forces&quot;.

Documents leaked by Ukrainian hackers in October 2023 purported to show attempts by the Kremlin to cultivate connections with members of PVV.

=== Views on LGBT community ===
According to Wilders, the LGBT community in Europe is threatened by mass immigration from the Muslim world. He said that &quot;We were always one of the top parties that were supported by (the gay) community. We believe that like Christians and Jews and women and journalists, gay people are also one of the first to pay the price of ... Islamization.&quot; International commentators have documented that Wilders has typically promoted more moderate and socially liberal positions towards LGBT people when compared to other national-populist political leaders in Europe, which Wilders frames as being part of a Dutch traditional value of tolerance. In 2017, Wilders and the PVV voted in favour of including mandatory LGBT education in secondary vocational education while other Dutch conservative parties voted against. However, Wilders has criticized the promotion of &quot;woke indoctrination&quot; among young children, describing it as a &quot;woke dictatorship&quot;. Wilders asserts that the freedoms that homosexual people should ideally enjoy, such as the freedom to express affection, marry, and have children, are held back by Islam which opposes it, and actively resists against it.

In 2022, Wilders stated “If people are transsexual, they get all the respect from the PVV. We have no problem with that&quot; but argues transgender people should only be allowed to change gender with the approval of a doctor or psychiatrist. His party&#x27;s manifesto talks about schoolchildren being &quot;indoctrinated&quot; with &quot;gender insanity&quot;.

=== Other positions ===
In the 1990s while at the VVD, Wilders advocated for ethnic Hungarians, claiming that Hungarians in Romania, Slovakia, Serbia and Ukraine were being oppressed. In 1996, the VVD distanced itself from the Hungary working group after questions were asked by Slovakian diplomats.

Wilders supported Indian politician Nupur Sharma&#x27;s comments on Muhammad that caused controversy. He also supported the decision of India&#x27;s Hindu nationalist-led government to revoke the special status of Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir. He posted: &quot;India is a full democracy. Pakistan is a 100 per cent terror state. So the choice is easy. Welcome home Kashmir. #IndiaForKashmir.&quot;

Regarding climate change, Wilders has said &quot;We are not climate deniers. We have a climate problem, but we cannot solve it in the Netherlands. If you close a coal-fired power station in the Netherlands, ten will be added in China in the same week.&quot;

==Public reception==
===Image===
Wilders has become a controversial figure with polarized opinions on him from the world news media. Regarding his reputation in the Netherlands, Wilders stated in 2009, &quot;Half of Holland loves me and half of Holland hates me. There is no in-between.&quot; In 2005, the Dutch public expressed mixed reactions to Wilders&#x27; general agenda, with 53% calling it &quot;implausible&quot; and 47% more supportive.
He has been described as populist, labelled as both &quot;extreme right&quot; and far-right, and defended by others as a mainstream politician with legitimate concerns saying that such labels are shallow smear attempts. Wilders himself rejects the labels and has called such descriptions &quot;scandalous&quot;. A 2023 profile by the BBC claimed Wilders to be a &quot;firebrand and a radical&quot; in public who fiercely rejects the &quot;far-right&quot; label but &quot;affable&quot; in private and that he gets on well with many of his political opponents. Journalist and filmmaker Stephen Robert Morse who produced the documentary &quot;EuroTrump&quot; detailing Wilders&#x27; campaign during the 2017 Dutch general election described Wilders as holding strong opinions but also as a &quot;likable and normal guy&quot; outside of politics.

Wilders has been both accused of building his popularity on fear and resentment and vociferously defended for having the courage to talk openly about the problems unfettered immigration brings with it and the &quot;incompatibility&quot; of fundamentalist Islam with western values.

=== Domestic recognition ===
Wilders was respectively declared as &quot;Man of the Year&quot; in 22 December 2023 by Dutch magazine Panorama and &quot;Politician of the Year&quot; in 15 December 2007 by NOS-radio, a mainstream Dutch radio station. The parliamentary press praised his ability to dominate political discussion and to attract the debate and to get into publicity with his well-timed . The editors eventually gave the title to Wilders because he was the only one who scored high among both the press and the general public. In December 2009, Wilders came in second in two polls in the Netherlands for Politician of the Year. A panel of Dutch television viewers praised him as &quot;the second best&quot; politician this year (after his outspoken critic Alexander Pechtold), while his colleagues in parliament named him &quot;the second worst&quot; (after Rita Verdonk).

In February 2010, the trailer of a newly published online satirical video on the website of the Dutch radio station FunX, which targets a young urban audience, spoofed a murder attempt on Wilders.

On 2 October 2011 Radio Netherlands Worldwide reported that a retired Dutch politician of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) Frits Bolkestein, who is sometime called the &#x27;mentor&#x27; of Geert Wilders, &quot;does not share his views&quot;. He reportedly said that &quot;Wilders says things that are just not right and I think he totally exaggerates.&quot; While giving his opinion on burqa ban Mr Bolkestein said that he &quot;disagrees with the recent introduction of a burqa ban, an idea championed by Geert Wilders.&quot; The Netherlands, he said, is the third European country to introduce such a ban after France and Belgium. &quot;A ban makes martyrs of the few burqa wearers there are in the Netherlands&quot;, he said.

Wilders has also been compared to the assassinated fellow critic of Islam and filmmaker Theo van Gogh, but he does not see himself as taking on Van Gogh&#x27;s mantle.

=== Criticism ===

Some Muslim critics of Wilders accuse him of using Quranic verses out of context, and of manipulating verses to have a different meaning than the verses intended to. Wilders&#x27; views on Islam prompted the Mayor of Rotterdam, Ahmed Aboutaleb, to reprimand him. Wilders has stated that he supports the free speech rights of his critics, saying that &quot;An Imam who wants a politician dead is – however reprehensible – allowed to say so&quot;. He has responded to critics&#x27; comments of racism and Islamophobia by stating, &quot;I don&#x27;t hate Muslims. I hate their book and their ideology&quot;.

Editorials in &quot;The Montreal Gazette&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; have accused Wilders of hypocrisy given that, in their view, Wilders has called for the ban of the sale of the Quran while simultaneously arguing for his own personal freedom of speech. In a speech during a Dutch parliamentary debate, Wilders elaborated that he calls for the consistent application of Dutch laws restricting any act of expression that incites violence. Ideally, he would prefer to see nearly all such laws abolished.

In February 2012, Wilders was accused of anti-Polish sentiment after his party launched a &quot;hotline&quot; website for public complaints specifically about Poles and as well as Bulgarians, Romanians and other Eastern Europeans who are causing a &quot;nuisance&quot;. The website prompted the Polish embassy in the Netherlands to request the website to be shut down while the Romanian embassy called it &quot;discriminatory&quot;. Several politicians denounced the website, although prime minister Mark Rutte did not comment. Shortly after the website launch, a number of Poles in the Netherlands reported being targeted by vandalism or insulted for speaking Polish in public.

In March 2014 and during a party meeting in The Hague on the evening of local elections, he sparked widespread controversy when he asked his attending supporters &quot;Do you want, in this city, and in the Netherlands, more or fewer Moroccans?&quot;, after which they chanted &quot;Fewer! Fewer!&quot;. Wilders&#x27; response was &quot;Then we&#x27;ll fix it!&quot;. This action led several PVV representatives to resign, among whom two of the party&#x27;s members of Parliament (Roland van Vliet and Joram van Klaveren), the party&#x27;s leader in the European Parliament (Laurence Stassen), and a number of its provincial legislators and municipal councillors. Many politicians denounced what happened. In response, a number of young Moroccans launched a social media campaign called &#x27;Born here&#x27;, in which they posted pictures of themselves alongside their Dutch passports.

In May 2014, Dutch Foreign Minister Timmermans condemned Wilders&#x27; anti-Islam sticker, saying that &quot;The Netherlands cannot be held responsible for the adolescent behavior of a single parliamentarian.&quot; Timmermans said that Saudi Arabia is &quot;deeply offended by the sticker action.&quot;

=== International ===

Wilders was extensively discussed in leaked American diplomatic cables. In a briefing to president Barack Obama, he was described as &quot;no friend of the US: he opposes Dutch military involvement in Afghanistan; he believes development assistance is money wasted; he opposes NATO missions outside &#x27;allied&#x27; territory; he is against most EU initiatives; and, most troubling, he foments fear and hatred of immigrants.&quot;

In July 2011, Anders Behring Breivik, the man who carried out the 2011 Norway attacks, expressed admiration for Geert Wilders and the Party for Freedom. Wilders immediately distanced himself strongly from Breivik.

On 28 July 2015, Vienna&#x27;s prosecutors&#x27; office launched a probe and lodged calls for criminal proceedings against Geert Wilders for allegedly comparing the Quran to &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, after Tarafa Baghajati had accused him of hate speech and denigrating religious teachings.

In October 2020, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan sued Wilders after he posted a series of tweets against Erdoğan and urged NATO to take Turkey out of the bloc. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that a legal case &quot;against a Dutch politician that could possibly even lead to a curtailment of freedom of expression is not acceptable.&quot;

== Personal life ==
According to a profile in &quot;Elsevier Weekblad&quot; Wilders was in a short-lived marriage at the age of 20. He has since been married to Krisztina Wilders (née Márfai), a former diplomat from Hungary of Jewish origin, since July 1992. 

Wilders is an agnostic, but he has stated that he thinks Christians &quot;are my allies&quot; and that they fundamentally should want the same thing.

In June 2011, disclosure of Wilders&#x27;s personal finances indicated that he founded a self-administered company one year earlier without reporting this via the public records of the House of Representatives, which he, as a parliamentarian, should have done. The company is known as OnLiberty BV and is aimed at acquiring intellectual and property rights. Wilders later explained he had acted this way for security reasons and that the company had no connection to the PVV. OnLiberty BV has since been formally registered in Breda.

Wilders has been bleaching and dyeing his hair to peroxide-platinum blond since at least the mid-1990s having previously got his hair cut at a barber shop near Utrecht Central Station until this was stopped due to security concerns. As a result of hair graying, Wilders&#x27; dark roots show less. Wilders has acquired nicknames such as &quot;Mozart&quot; and &quot;Captain Peroxide&quot; because of his flamboyant platinum blond hairstyle. Radio Netherlands calls him &quot;the most famous bleach-blond since Marilyn Monroe&quot;.

=== Protection ===
On 10 November 2004, two suspected attackers were captured after an hour-long siege of a building in The Hague. They were in possession of three grenades and were accused of planning to murder Wilders as well as a fellow MP, Ayaan Hirsi Ali. The suspects were presumed to be members of what the Dutch intelligence agency, the General Intelligence and Security Service, has termed the Hofstad Network (&quot;Hofstadgroep&quot;). Since this incident Wilders has been under constant security protection because of frequent threats to his life. In September 2007, a Dutch woman was sentenced to a one-year prison term for sending more than 100 threatening emails to Wilders. In 2009, a rapper from Rotterdam was sentenced to 80 hours community service and a two-month suspended jail term for threatening Wilders in a rap song. Wilders was listed as the most threatened politician in the Netherlands in 2008.

Wilders was reported to have been &quot;deprived... of a personal life for his... hatred of Islam&quot;. He is constantly accompanied by a permanent security detail of about six plainclothes police officers, and does not receive visitors unless they are cleared in advance, thoroughly searched, and escorted at all times. He lives in a state-provided safe house which is outfitted to be bulletproof, is heavily guarded by police, and has a panic room. He is driven from his home to his offices in parliament in an armored police vehicle, and wears a bulletproof vest. His office is located in the most isolated corner of the Dutch Parliament building, and was chosen because potential terrorists can get to it through only one corridor, making it easier for his bodyguards to repel an attack. The restrictions on his life, he said, are &quot;a situation that I wouldn&#x27;t wish on my worst enemy&quot;.

In January 2010, Karen Geurtsen, a Dutch journalist from the magazine &quot;HP-De Tijd&quot;, revealed a painful breach of security. She spent four months working undercover, posing as an intern, for the PVV party. She claimed that she had had unchecked access to Wilders. &quot;I could have killed him&quot;, were the first words of the article that she published about this operation. According to her, she had &quot;dozens&quot; of opportunities to take his life. In July 2010, after Wilders complained that his security was inadequate, the Special Security Assignments Brigade, a special unit of Dutch military police, made four attempts to smuggle a firearm into the heavily guarded offices of Wilders&#x27; Freedom Party, two of which were successful. Following these breaches, security at the offices was increased.

=== Death threats ===
In September 2010, in an internet chat room, Australian Islamic fundamentalist preacher Feiz Mohammad urged his followers to behead Wilders. His rationale was his accusation that Wilders had &quot;denigrat[ed]&quot; Islam, and that anyone who &quot;mocks, laughs or degrades Islam&quot; as Wilders had must be killed &quot;by chopping off his head.&quot; The Dutch newspaper &quot;De Telegraaf&quot; released an excerpt of the talk, after Dutch intelligence officials received a tip about the threat. After the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, Wilders wrote:I am threatened for the simple reason that I am an Islam critic. But, make no mistake, I am not the only one who is in danger. The Tsarnaev brothers drew inspiration from Feiz Mohammed&#x27;s internet rants and decided to kill innocent onlookers at a marathon. Everyone is in danger.In July 2010 Anwar al-Awlaki published a &quot;death list&quot; in his &quot;Inspire&quot; magazine, including Wilders, Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Salman Rushdie along with cartoonists Lars Vilks and three &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; staff members: Kurt Westergaard, Carsten Juste, and Flemming Rose. Shortly before this publication, it was revealed in The Hague that Dutch law enforcement officers succeeded twice in smuggling a firearm into the parliament buildings and into the guarded headquarters of Wilders&#x27; party. This check was carried out by the Special Security Assignments Brigade BSB, a special unit of the Dutch Military Police. The test was carried out following a complaint from Wilders about his security being inadequate.

Pakistani male Junaid I. was arrested in the Den Haag Centraal railway station after having posted a video with threats against Wilders on Facebook the previous day. He had been enraged about a Muhammad cartoon contest announced by Wilders. In 2019, Junaid I was sentenced to ten years in prison as an attack on a parliamentarian constitutes an attack on Dutch rule of law, the convict had showed an interest in violent extremism and the great risk of recurrence. In February 2021, the appeals court came to the same verdict and sentence.

Wilders said he had received hundreds of death threats after he supported Indian politician Nupur Sharma&#x27;s comments on Muhammad that caused controversy. He remained defiant, claiming to stand for freedom. After the murder of a Hindu tailor by two Muslim men, he cautioned the people of India against &#x27;appeasement of Islam&#x27;.

=== Trials ===
====2009====

Several groups and persons in the Netherlands have called for legal action against Wilders, while others, including Christian fundamentalists, defended his right to free speech. On 15 August 2007, a representative of the Prosecutors&#x27; Office in Amsterdam declared that dozens of reports against Wilders had been filed, and that they were all being considered. Attempts to prosecute Wilders under Dutch anti-hate speech laws in June 2008 failed, with the public prosecutor&#x27;s office stating that Wilders&#x27; comments contributed to the debate on Islam in Dutch society and also had been made outside parliament. The office released a statement reading: &quot;That comments are hurtful and offensive for a large number of Muslims does not mean that they are punishable. Freedom of expression fulfils an essential role in public debate in a democratic society. That means that offensive comments can be made in a political debate.&quot; On 21 January 2009, a three-judge court ordered prosecutors to try him.

In late October 2010, the Dutch court approved a request from Geert Wilders to have new judges appointed forcing the court to retry the case. On 7 February 2011, Wilders returned to the court room in order that his legal team could present evidence from Islamic experts which the court rejected in 2010, including Mohammed Bouyeri, who murdered film-maker Theo van Gogh, and Dutch academic Hans Jansen.

On 23 June 2011, Wilders was acquitted of all charges. A Dutch court said that his speech was legitimate political debate, but on the edge. Because both the public prosecutor and the defence requested complete acquittal, the verdict will most likely not be appealed.

==== 2016 trial ====
On 18 March 2016, a second trial against Wilders began, this time on the accusation of inciting &quot;discrimination and hatred&quot; against Moroccans living in the Netherlands. On 17 November 2016, the Dutch Public Prosecution Service demanded a fine against him of €5,000 (£4,300). On 9 December 2016, he was convicted in a hate speech trial but no penalty was imposed. That verdict was overturned in 2020 when a higher court found that while Wilders&#x27;s remarks were insulting to an ethnic minority, they were found to be in the service of receiving political gains rather than inspiring discrimination.

== International initiatives ==

Wilders is regarded as part of the international counter-jihad movement and as &quot;the most successful counter-jihadist politician in the world&quot;. He is described as the &quot;main counter-jihad standard bearer across Europe ... feted by campaigning organisations in North America&quot;.

In the spring of 2009, Wilders launched the &quot;Facing Jihad World Tour&quot;, a series of screenings of &quot;Fitna&quot; to public officials and influential organizations, starting in Rome. In the US, Wilders showed the film to the United States Congress in February, having been invited by Arizona Republican Senator Jon Kyl. Around 40 people attended the screening. American Muslims protested, but said they supported his right of free speech while still condemning his opinions. Wilders appeared before the National Press Club and the Republican Jewish Coalition as well. Similar attempts in Britain led to a travel ban.

In July 2010, Wilders announced the International Freedom Alliance, a network of groups and individuals who &quot;are fighting for freedom against Islam&quot;. Wilders planned IFA branches in the United States, Canada, Britain, France and Germany by late 2010. &quot;The message, &#x27;stop Islam, defend freedom&#x27;, is a message that&#x27;s not only important for the Netherlands but for the whole free Western world&quot;, Wilders stated to reporters at the Dutch Parliament. Wilders stressed the group would not contain far-right extremists.

=== United States ===
In August 2010, Wilders, who had become a regular guest with American conservatives and libertarians, announced that he would speak at a rally on 11 September in New York to protest the plans for Park51, a Muslim community center with a prayer space to be built near the World Trade Center site. The rally, to be held on the ten-year anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks, was organised by Stop Islamization of America, which was supported by former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who was originally announced as a speaker at the event, but never confirmed and cancelled a video appearance. According to SIOA&#x27;s website world leaders, prominent politicians and 9/11 family members would speak at the rally, but Wilders was not mentioned by name, though he did attend as he had announced.

In political circles in The Netherlands, the announcement caused widespread irritation about his plan. Christian Democrat senator Hans Hillen remarked that Wilders&#x27; words could endanger Dutch interests. Former NATO general secretary Jaap de Hoop Scheffer advised Wilders not to make a speech, arguing that the international public does not know who is in the Dutch cabinet and who is in parliament and thus Wilders&#x27; speech could be mistaken as an official statement of the Dutch government. Later, Christian Democrat party leader and acting Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Maxime Verhagen issued a warning.

Also, the Dutch Foreign Ministry allegedly would have issued guidelines to its embassies on how to react to questions about the role being played by the PVV and Wilders in the formation of a new government. On 10 August 2010, the website of Dutch daily newspaper &quot;NRC Handelsblad&quot; published the ministry memo. The ministry itself however had declined &quot;to confirm or deny&quot; the authenticity of these guidelines. One question posed is how Wilders could be taking part in negotiations on forming a government coalition when he has been indicted for inciting hatred and discrimination, and for insulting a group of persons. Other questions covered possible bans on the building of new mosques, on the Quran and on Islamic schools in the Netherlands. The memo stressed that such bans would breach the Dutch constitution.

On 11 September 2010, 2,000 people gathered close by the site of a planned Muslim community center near the site of the World Trade Center attacks, on 11 September 2001, where they were addressed by Wilders who flew from The Netherlands to urge the crowd: &quot;This is where we have (to) draw the line. We must never give a free hand to those who want to subjugate us,&quot; Wilders added. &quot;Draw this line so that New York... will never become New Mecca.&quot;

Wilders spoke on Thursday, 12 May 2011, at Cornerstone Church in Madison, Tennessee, at the Tennessee Freedom Coalition inaugural Signature Series event.

In May 2015, Geert Wilders was invited to an art exhibit presented by Stop Islamization of America in Garland, Texas, that offered a $10,000 prize for the best drawing of Muhammad. Towards the end of the event, two gunmen opened fire outside, injuring a police officer before being shot dead by other police officers guarding the center.

Wilders, at the invitation of Tennessee state senator Bill Ketron, attended the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio in July 2016 where Donald Trump was chosen as the presidential candidate of the Republican Party, with Governor Mike Pence as running mate. He gave a speech at a party for gay Republicans (&quot;LBGTrump&quot;).

=== Australia ===
In 2012, Wilders was invited by the Q Society of Australia to visit Australia. In August 2012 he applied for a visa to give two speeches in October 2012. His staff and police protection officers were granted visas within three days, but Wilders was not. On 2 October 2012 Immigration Minister Chris Bowen, while stating that Wilders&#x27; views were offensive, stated that he would not block the visa application. Bowen stated: I have decided not to intervene to deny him a visa because I believe that our democracy is strong enough, our multiculturalism robust enough and our commitment to freedom of speech entrenched enough that our society can withstand the visit of a fringe commentator from the other side of the world.

On the same day, the Q Society put out a press release criticizing the delays in issuing a visa, saying that Chris Bowen&#x27;s announcement was &quot;too little, too late&quot; and announcing that Wilders&#x27; visit would be pushed back to February 2013 as there were still no visa documents available.

=== Germany ===
In March 2010, Wilders was told he is &quot;not welcome&quot; in the western German tourist resort of Monschau in the Eifel area, after he spent a weekend there, along with armed bodyguards. Mayor Margareta Ritter (CDU) said she was concerned that his presence tainted her town with the suspicion that it was sympathetic to his views. As a result, Monschau was said to have been unfairly connected with &quot;extremism&quot; in the European press. Anyone who pollutes the integration debate in the Netherlands with poisonous right-wing populism as Wilders has, and advocates prohibition of the Koran by a comparison with Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, is not welcome in Monschau. I wanted to distinguish Monschau from that.

Ritter did not say whether Wilders was enjoying a short vacation in her town or had been meeting with like-minded people. A demonstration to support Wilders was announced to take place in Berlin on 17 April.

The same year local Berlin politician for the CDU René Stadtkewitz was expelled from the CDU after he invited Wilders to Germany to hold a speech. In October 2010, Wilders supported the founding of Stadtkewitz&#x27;s new German Freedom Party. In April 2015, Wilders held a speech for Pegida in Dresden.

=== United Kingdom ===
;Ban on entering
Lord Pearson of Rannoch and Baroness Cox, members of the House of Lords (the upper chamber of the British Parliament), invited Wilders to a show of 12 February 2009 viewing of &quot;Fitna&quot; in the Palace of Westminster. Two days before the showing, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith banned Wilders from entering the United Kingdom, labeling him an &quot;undesirable person&quot;. Entry was denied under EU law, and reportedly supported under regulation 19 of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, an EU law which allows a member state to refuse entry to individuals if they are regarded as constituting a threat to public policy, security or health. A Home Office spokesperson elaborated that &quot;The Government opposes extremism in all its forms ... and that was the driving force behind tighter rules on exclusions for unacceptable behaviour that the Home Secretary announced in October last year&quot;.

Wilders defied the ban and took a British Midland Airways flight from Amsterdam to London Heathrow Airport on 12 February, accompanied by television crews. Upon arrival, he was quickly detained by UK Border Agency officials, and deported on one of the next flights to the Netherlands. He called Prime Minister Gordon Brown &quot;the biggest coward in Europe&quot; and remarked, &quot;Of course I will come back&quot;. Wilders had visited the United Kingdom in December 2008 without any problem. In response to the ban, both Pearson and Cox accused the government of &quot;appeasing&quot; militant Islam.

The &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; stated that the ban was broadly condemned in the British news media. The Dutch Foreign Secretary, Maxime Verhagen, called the decision &quot;highly regrettable&quot; and complained to his British counterpart. Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende complained to Gordon Brown about the &quot;disappointing&quot; decision. The Quilliam Foundation, a British think tank, criticised the ban, as did National Secular Society president Terry Sanderson. The Muslim Labour peer Lord Ahmed expressed support for Smith&#x27;s ban on Wilders entering the country; the Ramadhan Foundation and the Muslim Council of Britain also did so, the council labeling Wilders &quot;an open and relentless preacher of hate&quot;.

;Ban overturn
After being declared &quot;persona non grata&quot; by Jacqui Smith, then the Home Secretary, in February 2009, Wilders appealed the decision to Britain&#x27;s Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. In October 2009, the tribunal overturned the ban. Wilders subsequently praised the ruling as &quot;a triumph for freedom of speech&quot; and stated that he planned to visit the United Kingdom in the near future.

The ruling was criticized by the British Home Office, which stated that an appeal of the tribunal&#x27;s ruling is being considered. A spokesman stated: The Government opposes extremism in all its forms. The decision to refuse Wilders admission was taken on the basis that his presence could have inflamed tensions between our communities and have led to inter-faith violence. We still maintain this view.

;Visits
On 16 October 2009, Wilders arrived in the United Kingdom and was quickly forced to move his press conference due to protests by about forty members of the organization Islam4UK, an organization that was later shut down under the UK&#x27;s Terrorism Act 2000 on 14 January 2010. Although the Home Office had asserted that his entry into the country would not be blocked, a spokesman said his &quot;statements and behaviour during a visit will inevitably impact on any future decisions to admit him&quot;. His visit to the UK met with protest, but Wilders called it &quot;a victory&quot; in a press conference. On his outspoken views on Islam, he said: &quot;I have a problem with the Islamic ideology, the Islamic culture, because I feel that the more Islam that we get in our societies the less freedom we get.&quot; He opened the press conference with a quote from George Orwell&#x27;s preface to &quot;Animal Farm&quot;: &quot;If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they don&#x27;t want to hear&quot;. Lord Pearson, who had invited him, said his arrival was a celebration of the victory of freedom of speech over those who would prevent it in this country, particularly the Islamists, the violent Jihadists who are on the march across the world and in the UK.

In January 2010, Wilders was invited again to show his anti-Quran movie &quot;Fitna&quot; in the British House of Lords by UK Independence Party (UKIP) Lord Pearson, and cross-bencher Baroness Cox. Wilders accepted the invitation and was present for a showing of the movie in the House of Lords on 5 March. In his speech he quoted ominous words from Winston Churchill&#x27;s book &quot;The River War&quot; from 1899: Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. No stronger retrograde force exists in the World. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step ... the civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilization of ancient Rome.

At the ensuing press conferences, he called the Islamic prophet Muhammad a &quot;barbarian, a mass murderer, and a pedophile&quot; and referred to Islam as a &quot;fascist ideology&quot; that was &quot;violent, dangerous, and retarded&quot;. Wilders also reportedly called Turkish Prime Minister Erdoğan a &quot;total freak&quot;. Dutch Prime Minister Jan-Peter Balkenende called these comments &quot;irresponsible&quot;, and Maxime Verhagen, Dutch caretaker Minister of Foreign Affairs, publicly condemned Wilders&#x27;s remarks and behaviour: He incites discord among people in a distasteful manner. And in the meantime he damages the interests of the Dutch population and the reputation of the Netherlands in the world.

Bernard Wientjes, the president of the Dutch employers&#x27; organization Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers (VNO-NCW), also accused Wilders of &quot;seriously&quot; damaging Dutch interests abroad. He called it outrageous that Wilders had presented himself in London as &quot;the next Dutch prime minister&quot; and then derided Turkish Prime Minister Erdoğan. Emphasizing that three-quarters of the Dutch GDP comes from revenue earned abroad, according to Wientjes, Wilders poses &quot;a serious threat to the Netherlands and the Dutch economy&quot;.

==Historical evaluation in the Netherlands==
In the Netherlands, Wilders and his movement have been discussed in historical and psychological perspectives. 
Dutch philosopher characterised Wilders and his movement in 2010 as &quot;the prototype of contemporary fascism&quot; after having defined fascism itself as &quot;the politisation of the resentment of the man in the crowd&quot;, in line with previous definitions by Menno ter Braak, Albert Camus and Thomas Mann. 
Historian Robin te Slaa of NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies disagreed and concluded in 2012 that Wilders is no fascist in the historical sense. Wilders and his party do not formally subscribe to classical fascist tenets such as biological racism, social darwinism, an autocratic state, rejection of democracy and of individualism, a cult of autocratic one-man leadership and a Third Way economic policy, in between capitalism and Marxism. Instead, Wilders is seen as a libertarian proponent of laissez-faire economic policy, personal autonomy, women&#x27;s equality and the emancipation of homosexual people. However, te Slaa noted the extreme right-wing populism, the proposed discrimination of Muslims, the Islamophobia and the rejection of the legal state by Wilders. He cited Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte&#x27;s characterisation of Wilders as a &quot;political pyromaniac&quot; because of the absence of practical solutions in Wilders&#x27; disputed Islamophobic proposals.

<text>Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Shankaracharya Swamigal (born Subrahmanyam Mahadeva Iyer; 18 July 1935 – 28 February 2018) was the 69th Shankaracharya Guru and head or pontiff (Pïțhādhipati) of the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham. Subramanyam Mahadeva Iyer was nominated by his predecessor, Chandrashekarendra Saraswati, as his successor and was given the pontifical title Sri Jayendra Saraswathi on 22 March 1954.

Sri Jayendra Saraswati Swamigal succeeded Mahaperiyava Chandrashekara Saraswati Swamigal in 1960, a fact not many people know. He conducted all the activities of the mutt with the oversight of his Guru out of reverence. His successor was anointed by the then Senior Pontiff Mahaperiyava during his lifetime in the early 1980s.

==Early life==
Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Swamigal was born as Subrahmanyam to Mahadeva Iyer and Saraswathi Ammal on 18 July 1935. He completed schooling at Irulneeki primary school and at a middle school at nearby Adichapuram village. Then he shifted to a veda pathasala at Thiruvanaikoil in Trichy. He visited the village on holidays and used to play normal games such as marbles and &#x27;killi-thandu&#x27; like other children of his age. Chandrashekarendra Saraswathi selected him as his successor, when Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Swamigal was only 19 years old.

==Contributions==
Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal was head of the mutt established by Adi Shankaracharya in 482 BCE . He had His spiritual tutelage from &#x27;Maha Periyava&#x27; and travelled the length and breadth of the country with His guru. He delivered religious discourse besides involving Himself in various spiritual and social activities as well. Under His guidance, the mutt started several schools and hospitals. The Mahaswamigal ensured that the Mutt involved itself in various social activities. Thanks to His efforts, the mutt today runs several schools, eye clinics and hospitals. He also managed to establish a direct connect with the people.

Although the mutt is primarily a religious organisation, the Mahaswamigal, whose character was underpinned by a strident social consciousness, had both the conviction and courage to steer the mutt into territories into which it had not ventured before. The Mahaswamigal found strength from His own inner conviction and the need for both the mutt and the Hindu religion to reach out to the poor and downtrodden. He was still strong on religious practices and their understanding — it was one of the reasons He was handpicked as the 69th pontiff of Kanchi mutt when He was just 19 years of age. It took enormous amount of courage for Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal to renounce the world including His parents at the age of 19 in order to become true spiritual guru. He travelled with His senior initially and then, lead many more yatras across India barefoot to spread awareness on Sanatana Dharma.

But He could make the two unlike poles reside comfortably within him. And that is because He was also a Jagadguru of vision, who had a grasp of His own destiny. The previous Kanchi mutt head, Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal had a profile and presence that combined religious benevolence and spiritual sensitivity but He rarely spoke in public. But Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal liked to get involved in the current affairs of India, public life and liked to meet people across castes.

Jagadguru Sri Chandrashekarendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal had observed three unique qualities in His shishya (student) Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal : Jan Akarshanam, Dhan Akarshanam and Jal Akarshanam and hence chose Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal as His successor. Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal had the ability to attract people anywhere such that people used to call him to places where there was drought. He had the unique power of attracting rains anywhere. So people used to have great faith in Him. Any public project inaugurated by the Kanchi seer used to taste success.

He clearly understood the changing pulse of the socio-political, cultural-religious fabric of the country. In the 1980s, he was able to spot the churn and realized the need for both the mutt and its head to have a different profile other than being a sentinel of religious rites and rituals. It is this belief that made him openly take on the Hindu-baiter and former chief minister M Karunandihi on the language issue, by asserting that &#x27;Sanskrit was his father tongue and Tamil his mother tongue&#x27;. It is considered a bravura explanation.

Unlike His predecessors in Kanchi Sankara Mutt, Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal was involved in both spiritual and public life and was known for the efforts for a solution in the Ayodhya issue during the erstwhile period of Prime Minister AB Vajpayee, but it failed to fructify. Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal chose to bring warring factions into table and wrote a series of letters to All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) and the Vishwa Hindu Parishadh (VHP) to work out a solution.

He was instrumental in the Kanchi Math expanding directly into people&#x27;s service.

Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal visited Manasarovar and Kailash in 1998 and became the only Shankaracharya to do so after the Adi Shankara. There he installed the idol of Adi Shankara. One of his important contributions is founding of the Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi Viswa Mahavidyalaya, a deemed university in the name of his guru. Under Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal&#x27;s tenure, Kanchi Math ran the deemed university and dozens of schools and hospitals — territories previously not in the reach of Mutt — besides over 50 traditional Vedic schools and temples. Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal broke the restraining rules of the Math and reached out to the downtrodden. He went to Harijan bastis and attracted thousands of new followers and devotees. He transformed a spiritual and ritualistic Math into a socially vibrant one. This brought Him high popularity and also into interaction with a multitude of social and political leaders in the country.

The followers of the mutt call Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal a reformist saint and credit him with ensuring that the preachings of Adi Sankara were spread among people beyond the Brahmin community. This He did by encouraging the spiritual mutt to become more of a social service-oriented one and making it all-inclusive. But at the same time, he did not wish to go down in history merely as a religious figure. He had ambitions of being seen as a seer who understood politics and wanted to have a say in issues facing the nation. It is this approach that led to Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal playing a part in trying to resolve the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute during the NDA rule, by engaging with stakeholders from both communities and the government.
During his time as the head seer, Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal launched several charity initiatives such as the ‘Jana Kalyan, Jana Jagaran,’ a movement to &quot;serve the people and awaken the masses&quot;. The charity programme aimed to establish temples in Dalit colonies and engage Dalits in temple rituals to expand the Hindu collective beyond the Dravidian polity&#x27;s anti-brahmin stance. He also appointed Dalit trustees in temples such as Mylapore Kapaleeshwarar.

According to people who had been close to him during this period, Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal recognised the faultline in Hinduism that had triggered the conversions and embarked on an attempt to bring in Dalits and other socially oppressed classes into the mainstream Hindu fold. For months, he toured the state extensively, visiting villages, talking to Dalits and other communities. Departing from the usual convention of the mutt, which insisted that the pontiffs travel only by foot, Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal had got some of his devotees to donate a customised van that he used for his travel to these villages.

Under his tenure, The Kanchi Mutt started many schools, eye clinics and hospitals. Child Trust Hospital, Hindu Mission Hospital, Tamil Nadu Hospital and other public welfare institutions which are religious focused were developed by him.

He was seen as an avatar of the deity Shiva and promulgated concept of Santana Dharma.

He also conducted ‘Viswaroopa Yatra’ and ‘Sandarsanam’ at the Poranki Veda Pathasala. He played an important role in the establishment of the eye hospital – Sankara Nethrayala – between Vijayawada and Guntur in 2004. Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal&#x27;s primary motto was to promote spirituality among people and also spread the bhakti cult. He renovated or participated in ‘kumbhabhishekam’ of more than 100 temples in the State. The seer took part in the ‘kumbhabhishekam’ at the Kanaka Durga Temple in Vijayawada in the 90s. He also installed Lord Krishna&#x27;s idol at the Labbipet Venkateswara Swamy temple in 2015. The Kanchi Kamakoti Charitable Trust in Tenali is among the several institutions set up by him.
==Arrest and Acquittal==

In 2004, Jagadguru Sri Jayendra Saraswathi Mahaswamigal was arrested in connection with the Sankararaman murder case on Diwali day by Jayalalithaa government. The court said that the complainant failed to support the prosecution and he was given bail. The trial went on till 2013 when he was acquitted by the court.

== Sexual harassment allegations ==
Tamil writer Anuradha Ramanan said she was subjected to sexual harassment by the Mahaswamigal when she met him back in 1992, when she was taken to negotiate the release of the spiritual magazine &quot;Amma&quot; by the monastery. Anuradha Ramanan accused Saraswathi of making sexual advances. She said that during their first meeting, he spoke about the proposed journal and offered to make her its editor, Ramanan agreed to the offer. During their final meeting, she said, he began using indecent language, and when she looked up from the notebook, the woman who took her to him was in a sexually intimate position with him. She said that the Saraswathi &quot;approached&quot; her, and when she objected, the other woman tried to persuade her of her &quot;good fortune&quot;. When she left the place, the Shankaracharya allegedly asserted that she keep her mouth shut.

Ramanan said that she went to a woman police officer close to her to lodge a complaint, but did not do so because she feared for the future of her daughters. She reported that she was subjected to attempted murder when a truck hit her car in which she was traveling and another murder attempt was made on her life when she was admitted to the hospital. In December 2004, she said she would have met with the same fate as that of Sankararaman if she had made the disclosure 12 years ago when the alleged incident took place.

==Death and Samadhi==
On 27 February 2018, for doing the daily routine Pooja, Jayendra Saraswathi Swamigal asked Vijayendra Saraswathi to perform the routine poojas, which acted as a premonition that he wanted to hand over the reins to his successor. Jayendra Swamigal even did Sandhyavandhanam that same day. The 82-year old seer was admitted to a hospital near Kamakshi Amman Temple in Kanchipuram the following morning due to breathing problems. However, Jayendra Swamigal was perfectly in shape and even walked whilst being inside the hospital. A few hours later, hospital and mutt sources announced that he had died and issued statement &quot;The 69th Acharya of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam Jagadguru Pujyashri Jayendra Saraswathi Shankaracharya Swamigal attained Siddhi at 9.00 am today - Shukla Trayodashi - 28 Feb. 2018 at Sri Kanchi Kamakotii Peetam Sankara Matam, Kanchipuram.&quot;

As a sanyasi, Jayendra Saraswati was not cremated. He was instead interred in a tomb called a Samadhi, that is referred to as a &#x27;Brindavanam&#x27; or &#x27;adhishthanam&#x27;. A Tulasi tree was planted and a Shiva lingam was consecrated on top so that it will become a permanent shrine. The process of interment is called &#x27;Brindavana Pravesha Karyakramam&#x27;, which began on 1 March 2018 at 8am.

The priests started performing chanting of mantras and his body was kept for devotees to pay respects from 10 am of 28 February 2018 to 8am of 1 March 2018. Jayendra Saraswati&#x27;s body was placed in the hall of the Kanchi math in a seated position, for devotees to catch a final glimpse. Devotees from various places visited the mutt from the morning of 28 February and throughout the night and paid homage to the late Acharya till 8am of 1 March 2018. Abhishekam of Shiva linga, a ritual was performed with chanting of Rudram and Chamakam on 1 March from 8am. Kanchi Mutt manager said over 5 lakh people came to the shrine to pay respects. It was decided that Jayendra Sarawasthi would be laid to rest beside his guru, Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswathi and hence the seer&#x27;s ‘brindavanam’, or final resting place, was constructed right next to the one that serves as the brindavanam for the 68th pontiff Sri Maha Periyava.

Mutt officials stopped the public darshan by 8am on 1 March 2018 and initiated the installation of the brindavanam by reciting slokas. The final rites of Saraswathi began with an &#x27;abhishekam&#x27; ( bath) with milk and honey at 10am. A huge crowd had assembled in the small auditorium to watch the proceedings of the installation of the Brindavanam. The body of Saraswathi was later carried to the adjacent ‘Brindavan Annexe,’ for his Samadhi, where the mortal remains of his predecessor Sri Chandrasekerendra Saraswathi were interred in 1994. The rituals for lowering Jayendra Saraswathi&#x27;s body in the 7 x 7 ft burial pit in the Brindhavanam Annexe started after 11 am on 1 March 2018. The Mutt&#x27;s Pontiff Sri Vijayendra Saraswathi performed the poojas for his guru and predecessor. The 69th pontiff of the Kanchi Sankara Mutt Sri Jayendra Saraswathi was placed in the ‘samadhi’ within the Mutt premises in Kanchipuram.

=== Reactions, tributes and legacy ===
The Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Vice President Muppavarapu Venkaiah Naidu mourned the death of Saraswathi.

Notable dignitaries who offered condolences and paid homage following his demise include former Deputy Prime Minister of India LK Advani, former Union Minister and Pattali Makkal Katchi leader Anbumani Ramadoss, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader MK Stalin, Indian President Ram Nath Kovind, Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit, Union ministers D. V. Sadananda Gowda and Pon Radhakrishnan, Banwarilal Purohit, O. Panneerselvam, Sengottaiyan, and Ilayaraja.

Muslims from Kanchipuram and nearby places also visited the Kanchi Mutt after his death, to pay their respects to him. They offered prayers (Namaz) as a token of respect for the Swami. The Nawab of Arcot is also known to be very close to the Mutt and its Acharyas.

<doc id="1191678" wikidata="Q261387" url="?curid=1191678" title="Apple strudel">
<text>Apple strudel (; ; Yiddish: שטרודל) is a traditional Viennese strudel, a popular pastry in Austria, Switzerland, Bavaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Northern Italy, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and other countries in Europe that once belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1867–1918).

==Name==
&quot;Strudel&quot;, a German word, derives from the Middle High German word for &quot;swirl&quot;, &quot;whirlpool&quot; or &quot;eddy&quot;.

The apple strudel variant is called &quot;strudel di mele&quot; in Italian, &quot;strudel jabłkowy&quot; in Polish, &quot;jablečný štrúdl&quot; in Czech, &quot;strudel de mere&quot; in Romanian, &quot;jabolčni zavitek&quot; in Slovenian, &quot;štrudla od jabuka&quot; or &quot;savijača s jabukama&quot; in Croatian,&quot;almásrétes&quot; in Hungarian, &quot;strudel da mëiles&quot; in Ladin and &quot;Apfelstrudel&quot; in German.

==History==
The oldest known strudel recipe is from 1697, a handwritten recipe housed at the Wienbibliothek im Rathaus.

Whether as a type of sweet or savoury layered pastry with a filling inside, the strudel gained popularity in the 18th century through the Habsburg Empire (1278–1780). Austrian cuisine was formed and influenced by the cuisines of many different peoples during the many centuries of the Austrian Habsburg Empire&#x27;s expansion. Strudel is related to the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s pastry baklava, which came to Austria from Turkish via Hungarian cuisine.

Strudel is most often associated with the Austrian cuisine, but is also a traditional pastry in the whole area formerly belonging to the Austro-Hungarian empire. In these countries, apple strudel is the most widely known kind of strudel. Apple strudel is considered to be the national dish of Austria along with Wiener Schnitzel and Tafelspitz.

Strudel (in Yiddish, שטרודל, pron. &quot;shtrudl&quot;) is also associated with Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, particularly of German, Swiss, and Austrian Ashkenazi Jews. Apple and raisin filling is popular among Jews.

German and Austrian immigrants in the 19th century took the dish to southern Brazil, where it can be found in most bakeries. It usually keeps its original German name, &quot;Apfelstrudel&quot;, but - less often - is translated to &quot;&quot;Strudel de Maçã&quot; (Apple Strudel) or &quot;Folheado de Maçã&quot;&quot; (Apple Puff).

==Pastry==

Apple strudel consists of an oblong strudel pastry jacket with an apple filling inside. The filling is made of grated cooking apples (usually of a tart, crisp and aromatic variety, such as Winesap apples) sugar, cinnamon, and bread crumbs.

Strudel uses an unleavened dough. The basic dough consists of flour, oil (or butter) and salt although as a household recipe, many variations exist.

Apple strudel dough is a thin, elastic dough, consisting of many thin layers and known as &quot;Blätterteig&quot;, the traditional preparation of which is a difficult process. The dough is kneaded by flogging, often against a tabletop. Dough that appears thick or lumpy after flogging is generally discarded and a new batch is started. After kneading, the dough is rested, then rolled out on a wide surface, and stretched until the dough reaches a thickness similar to phyllo. Bakers claim that a single layer should be so thin that a newspaper can be read by peering through it. The dough is also stretched carefully to make it large enough to cover the kneading table.

The filling is arranged in a line on a comparatively small section of dough, after which the dough is folded over the filling, and the remaining dough is wrapped around until all the dough has been used. The strudel is then oven-baked, and served warm. Apple strudel is traditionally served in slices, sprinkled with powdered sugar.

In traditional Viennese strudel the filling is spread over 3/4 of the dough and then the strudel is rolled, incorporating the dough through the filling and making a swirl pattern when the strudel is cut across. Perhaps this is the origin of the name which means whorl or whirlpool.

==Serving==

Toppings of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, custard, or vanilla sauce are popular in many countries. Apple strudel can be accompanied by tea, coffee or even champagne, and is one of the most common treats at Viennese cafés.

<doc id="1191699" wikidata="Q1597549" url="?curid=1191699" title="Kizomba">
<text>Kizomba is a social dance and music genre that originated in Angola during late 1970s to early 1980s. Kizomba is a national heritage of Angola and means &quot;party&quot; in Kimbundu. Traditionally, kizomba was danced with family, friends, and acquaintances in social settings such as parties and weddings, but is nowadays also enjoyed in clubs as well as other settings such as Kizomba Na Rua (Kizomba on the street) that are popular in Luanda.

==Origin and evolution==

===Music genre===
The origins of kizomba can be traced to late-1970s Angola.Kizomba is characterized by a slower, romantic, more sensuous rhythm than the traditional Angolan semba music. Kizomba music emerged as a fusion of Angolan Semba with Antillean zouk, and further Angolan music influences: It slowed down the cadence of songs and added a stronger bass line to the composition of instruments. Eduardo Paím is internationally recognized as the &quot;father/creator of Kizomba music&quot;, as he and his band were taking a major role in the development of the music style creation. Most kizomba songs are sung in  Angolan Portuguese/Portuguese.

===Dance genre===

Semba, a dance and music genre, rose in popularity in Angola during the 1950s. This was as a result of the development of modern Angolan music which is attributed to the musical group Ngola Ritmos. After gaining independence from Portugal, Angola entered a civil war in 1975 that lasted to 2002. As few semba music was being released during this early period, Angolans started to look else where for musicality such as the Caribbean. In the 1980s, when the actual kizomba music was pioneered and got more and more popular, Angolans started to adapt their semba steps according to the tempo and flavour of the Kizomba beats. As such Kizomba (dance) has essentially remained to many Angolans to what is referred to as &quot;Semba Social&quot;, only that it is danced to a spectrum of various music genre such as semba, kizomba or zouk. The emphasis is &quot;Semba social&quot; as Semba is often misinterpreted as &quot;Semba Show&quot; which is a style of Semba that is characterized with fast semba or zouk music alongside various dance tricks. As Kizomba is essentially &quot;Semba Social&quot;, that left room for &quot;Semba Show&quot; to be marketed as Semba by Angolan teachers outside of Angola. 

The Kizomba dance is a couple dance, in which the torso and right arm of the leader will guide the follower across the dance floor. It is the goal to synchronize perfectly as a couple with the music and express it through elegant footwork, smooth body movement, and attitude, called &quot;Ginga&quot; (for women) and &quot;Banga&quot; (for men).

==Cultural influences==
The influence of kizomba is felt in most Portuguese-speaking African countries, but also in Portugal (especially in Lisbon and surrounding suburbs such as Amadora or Almada), where communities of immigrants have established clubs centered on the genre in a renewed kizomba style. The São Tomean kizomba music is very similar to the Angolan, Juka being the most notable among the Sãotomeans, and also one of the most notable performers in the genre.

==Popularity==
Kizomba is known for having a slow, insistent, somewhat harsh yet sensuous rhythm as the result of electronic percussion. It is danced accompanied by a partner, very smoothly, slowly and sensuously, and with neither tightness nor rigidity. There are frequent simultaneous hip rotations coordinated between dance partners, particularly in the quieter refrains of the music. Several individuals with a love of the Kizomba culture have been promoting it in other countries.

Famous Angolan teachers such as kota José N&#x27;dongala (founder of the Kizombalove Academy) and Mestre Petchu (founder of the Tradicional Kilandukilu Ballet) have been giving Kizomba and Semba teachers courses for years to further popularize their Angolan cultural values in Africa, Europe and in America.

===Brazil===
In Brazil, kizomba became famous when the pop artist Kelly Key released the album &quot;No Controle&quot;, on February 3, 2015. Key left the dance-pop/R&amp;B songs to introduce the kizomba in Brazil. In an interview Key said she sought originality and new styles: &quot;I&#x27;m running this responsibility of being predictable. I wanted to record Kizomba for 13 years! Now I feel mature and have knowledge of movement&quot;.

===China===
Kizomba is growing in popularity in some major Chinese cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. Some teachers of kizomba are Chinese while others are foreign. Every year, different Latin dance festivals are organized and presented such as Shanghai Bachata/Kizomba Festival.

===Ghana===
Kizomba in Ghana is one of the growing form of dance activity especially within the capital city of Accra were there are weekly dance sessions held at Afrikiko Leisure Centre or other bars and restaurants.

===List of traditional music instruments of Jammu and Kashmir===

*Rubab: The rabab, or rubab, is about three and a half feet long and has three strings. It is made of mulberry wood, while goat’s intestinal skin is used to make the strings. So, it is believed to bear someone’s soul and hence called Rabab. It came to the valley from Afghanistan. It creates soothing music and is an important part of Kashmir’s music culture.

*Surnai: This Kashmiri musical instrument is a wooden pipe around 18 inches in length with 7 outlet holes and one blowing hole and a bell-shaped outlet. There are two types of flutes found in the traditional music of Jammu and Kashmir. One is hollow from inside, has 7 holes for the 7 musical notes, and is played using two hands. The other type called Pi-Pi in Kashmiri, has 7 holes for the 7 swaras but does not have a blowing hole.
*Geger: It is a percussion instrument used as an accompaniment in the traditional music of Jammu and Kashmir. It is a brass or metal vessel on which sounds are created with the use of fingers or rings on fingers. It is often played in Chakri songs.
*Dokra: Also called Wasul or Dolke, was a percussion instrument used as an accompaniment in traditional Kashmiri music. Today, the tabla has taken its place. Tabla consists of two hand drums made of hollowed wood, metal or clay, where one drum is used to create treble and tonal sounds and the other is used to create bass. 
*Nagada: It is similar to Dhol and said to be a form of the ancient instrument Dundubhi. Sound is created by striking the nagada with a piece of wood. In Kashmir, this musical instrument is played at weddings and festivals.
*Shankh: It is an ancient Indian instrument which is used to add a religious element to ceremonies and festivals. In Kashmir, the shankh is played at Hindu weddings and at temples. It has been mentioned in the Vedas and the Bhagwat Gita.
*Swarnai: Known as Shahnai in Kashmiri music, it is wooden with nine holes and through a square near its mouth, air is blown to create sound. Swarnai music is melodious and the playing of this musical instrument is considered auspicious. Hindus as well as Muslims play this instrument at weddings and festivals.
*Khasya: At religious gatherings and weddings, two Khasya are played by striking them with each other.
*Thaluz: This traditional musical instrument is a part of the folk culture of Kashmir. It is mainly played at temples during prayers and kirtans.
*Nai Flute
: In Kashmiri language, the normal meaning of ‘Nai’ is related to flute. In Kashmiri folk music, the prevalence of Nai is older than two thousand years as we get its description in Nilamata Purana. 
&quot;Punyahved shabdin vansi venurvenaya sut magadh shabden tatha vandisvanenc&quot; 
Nilamata Purana described banshi as well as venu and in the modern era even the Kashmiri artists, especially of Anantnag, are proficient in playing two types of flutes.

1. The first type of flute is empty from inside and there are seven holes for seven musical notes. While playing it, fingers of both the hands are used. This type of flute is more prevalent in the folk life.

2. The second type of flute is also called &#x27;Pi-Pi&#x27; in Kashmiri language. This type of flute is made of walnut’s wood. Even this flute has seven holes but the hole from where the air is blown is absent, but its adjacent hole is put into the mouth and blown. The player sees the seven holes clearly. This instrument is used more conveniently and the player does not get tired soon. This type of flute is more famous in Kashmir.

===Ladishah===

Ladishah is one of the most important parts of the Kashmiri music tradition. Ladishah is a sarcastic form of singing. The songs are sung resonating to the present social and political conditions and are utterly humorous. The singers move from village to village performing generally during the harvesting period. The songs are composed on the spot on issues relating to that village, be it cultural, social or political. The songs reflect the truth and that sometimes makes the song a bit hard to digest, but they are totally entertaining.

===Hindustani classical===
Music and musical instruments find mention in the earliest texts like the Nilmatapurana and Rajatarangini by Kalhana. The very fact that it was a Kashmiri, Abhinavagupta (the great philosopher), who wrote a commentary called Abhinavabharati on Bharata&#x27;s &quot;Natyashatra&quot; shows how much importance was given to music in the ancient times. A favorite traditional instrument is the santoor (Shat-tantri-veena), a hundred string percussion instrument which is played by the goddess Sharada (the goddess of learning and art in ancient Kashmir).

Notable santoor players from Jammu and Kashmir include Shivkumar Sharma, from Jammu, and Bhajan Sopori from the Kashmir Valley.

<doc id="1191702" wikidata="Q1410645" url="?curid=1191702" title="Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance">
<text>The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (commonly known as the Rio Treaty, the Rio Pact, the Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, or by the Spanish-language acronym TIAR from Tratado Interamericano de Asistencia Recíproca) is an intergovernmental collective security agreement signed in 1947 in Rio de Janeiro at a meeting of the American states. 

The central principle contained in its articles is that an attack against one is to be considered an attack against them all; this was known as the &quot;hemispheric defense&quot; doctrine. Despite this, several members have breached the treaty on multiple occasions. 

The treaty was initially created in 1947 and came into force in 1948, in accordance with Article 22 of the treaty. The Bahamas was the most recent country to sign and ratify it in 1982.

==Background==
The United States maintained a hemispheric defense policy relative to European influence under the Monroe Doctrine from 1823 onward, and became increasingly interventionist following the 1904 promulgation of the Roosevelt Corollary. During the 1930s the United States had been alarmed by Axis overtures suggesting military cooperation with Latin American governments; apparent strategic threats against the Panama Canal were of particular concern. These were discussed in a series of meetings of the International Conference of American States and at the 1936 Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Peace. During World War II, the American government had been able to secure support for the Allies from all individual governments in the Americas except Uruguay (which remained neutral until 22 February 1945) and Argentina (which had difficult relations with the Allied powers from 1944 to 1945 but declared war on the Axis on 27 March 1945). Some countries had signed the Declaration by United Nations in early 1942 and more had signed by the end of 1945.

However, Latin American countries were largely sidelined from the Allied discussions of a postwar security order, held at Dumbarton Oaks from August to October 1944. The Brazilian Ambassador to Washington, Carlos Martins Pereira e Souza, &quot;protested the violation of inter-American norms of consultation in the preparation of postwar plans.&quot; These protests led to a series of consultations as well as to a Mexican proposal for an inter-American meeting. At the Inter-American Conference on the Problems of War and Peace, at Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City during February and March 1945, discussions of the post-war world order were held by the US Secretary of State and by the foreign secretaries of all the Latin American countries except El Salvador and Argentina, resulting in the Act of Chapultepec of 6 March 1945. The Act included a framework for the negotiation of a regional security treaty. It also shaped Latin American pressure during the United Nations conference in San Francisco for clauses in the UN Charter to facilitate regional collective defense, under Article 51.

Initially, the security conference was planned to be held in Rio de Janeiro in October 1945 but it was postponed to March 1946. The March 1946 date was also postponed indefinitely. Disputes between the United States and Argentina&#x27;s Juan Perón (President from 4 June 1946) led to the delays. The American concern, alongside that of some countries in South America regarding Peronism raised the possibility of including collective intervention to preserve democracy in the security conference. During the delay, global tensions between the United States and Soviet Union grew. In light of the developing Cold War and following the statement of the Truman Doctrine on 12 March 1947, the United States wished to make those new anti-communist commitments permanent, as did many anti-communist leaders in Latin America. 

The following year, in 1948, delegates gathered in Bogotá, Colombia, where they passed the charter of the Organization of American States (OAS). The OAS was created to oversee different functions beyond defense. The OAS functioned through debate and voting instead of the like-mindedness that characterized NATO.

==History==

===Signing===
The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance was the first of many so-called &quot;mutual security agreements&quot;, and the formalization of the Act of Chapultepec. The treaty was adopted by the original signatories on 2 September 1947 in Rio de Janeiro (hence the colloquial name &quot;Rio Treaty&quot;). It came into force on 3 December 1948 and was registered with the United Nations on 20 December 1948. With the exceptions of Trinidad and Tobago (1967) and the Bahamas (1982), no countries that became independent after 1947 have joined the treaty; Canada is yet to become a member, though it already has separate defense commitments with the United States.

===Cold War===
As revolutionary and nationalist governments spread through Latin America through the 1950s and 1960s, the fear of a shared enemy that was experienced during WWII dissipated and the idea of defensive cooperation became strained. According to Slater, many Latin American governments participating in the Treaty sought &quot;to insulate the hemisphere from rather than involve it in world conflict&quot;, though the United States pushed the smaller countries towards confrontation with its ideological adversaries. Latin American governments then began to view inter-American collaboration as bending to the will of the United States, forfeiting their sovereignty. In 1962 American states had found it necessary to break diplomatic relations with the Government of Cuba. The Report of the Inter-American Peace Committee to the Eighth Meeting of Consultation of Ministers of Foreign Affairs suggested that the activity the countries of the Sino-Soviet bloc and the Cuban government had with America was described as a serious violation of fundamental principles of the inter-American system.

Though the Cold War overtones of the Rio Treaty became increasingly evident, during the immediate post-war years, Long argues that it was more closely tied to pre-WWII regional antecedents and, even, Latin American diplomatic pressure. Long states, &quot;Despite many Latin American concerns about the United States&#x27; ultimately interventionist nature, Latin American diplomats cited the Monroe Doctrine and United States-led Pan-Americanism in support of a grand bargain that would extend and institutionalize US engagement while restricting unilateralism.&quot; However, the United States&#x27; often considered adherence to the Treaty&#x27;s principles of nonintervention as secondary to its Cold War concerns.

Though the action of the United States during the 1954 Guatemalan coup d&#x27;état and the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion raised questions among Latin American governments, the unilateral approach of the United States invading the Dominican Republic in 1965 during the Dominican Civil War, before the OAS&#x27;s Inter-American Peace Force was organized, caused many members to believe that the United States did not respect the ideals of multilateralism. Conversely during the Falklands War in 1982, the United States favored the United Kingdom arguing that Argentina had been the aggressor and because Argentina had not been attacked, as did Chile and Colombia. This was seen by most Latin American countries as the final failure of the treaty. Due to this, by the beginning of 1988 sixteen Latin American countries had become full members of the Nonaligned Movement, while another eight countries were observers and supported to different extents. The sixteen countries were Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, St. Lucia, Suriname, and Trinidad-Tobago. The eight that supported were Barbados, Brazil, Costa Rica, Dominica, El Salvador, Mexico, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

===21st century===
During a speech he made on 7 September 2001, the Mexican president, Vicente Fox Quesada, pointed out the necessity of having a multidimensional and modern security structure that responds to the real needs of the American hemisphere. He pointed out that when the TIAR was created in 1947 it was a result of the conditions from World War II. Since then it has been overtaken by a global system in which the vulnerability of nations does not lie solely in military or ideological threats. In September 2002, citing the Falklands example and anticipating the invasion of Iraq, Mexico formally withdrew from the treaty; after the requisite two years, in September 2004, Mexico ceased to be a signatory. In 2008, the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) created a new regional security council to manage their own defensive objectives. On 5 June 2012, Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA) countries Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, under the leadership of leftist governments, initiated the retirement from the TIAR, a decision which the Obama administration described as &quot;unfortunate&quot; but respected. The treaty was officially denounced by Nicaragua on 20 September 2012, Bolivia on 17 October 2012, Venezuela on 14 May 2013, and Ecuador on 19 February 2014.

==Invocations and considerations==
The treaty was invoked numerous times during the 1950s and 1960s, in particular the unanimous support of the United States&#x27; naval blockade during the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 2001, the United States invoked the Rio Treaty after the September 11 attacks.

In 2019, during a presidential crisis in Venezuela between incumbent President Nicolás Maduro and president of the opposition-led National Assembly of Venezuela Juan Guaidó, the latter opened talks on rejoining TIAR. On 11 May, Guaidó sent a letter to Organization of American States (OAS) secretary Luis Almagro requesting that Venezuela be reinstated. On 29 May 2019, the National Assembly approved its return to the Treaty in a preliminary discussion. The National Assembly reiterated its approval to return to the treaty in July 2019. As in 2024, due to the result of the elections in Venezuela, citizens have been collecting signatures to activate the TIAR in view of the crisis being experienced, which is being viewed as fraud.

<doc id="1191706" wikidata="Q12070994" url="?curid=1191706" title="Hugo Throssell">
<text>Hugo Vivian Hope Throssell, VC (26 October 1884 – 19 November 1933) was an Australian soldier in the First World War who was the first Western Australian and only Australian light horseman to receive the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for valour in battle that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces at the time.

==Early life==
Hugo Vivian Hope Throssell was born in Northam, Western Australia on 26 October 1884, the son of George Throssell, who was later briefly Premier of Western Australia, and his wife Anne, Morrell. Hugo was one of fourteen children born to the couple. He was educated at Prince Alfred College in Adelaide from January 1896 to December 1902, where, nicknamed &quot;Jimmy&quot;, he was a noted athlete, and captain of three intercollegiate sports teams.

On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, he joined the Australian Imperial Force and was allotted to the 10th Light Horse Regiment. His brother, Frank Erick Cottrell Throssell, known as &quot;Ric&quot;, also served in the war and died near Gaza. Hugo Throssell&#x27;s son, Richard Prichard &quot;Ric&quot; Throssell, shared the same family nickname as his uncle.

==First World War==
As a second lieutenant Hugo Throssell fought at Gallipoli, where he had landed on 4 August. He saw action in the desperate Battle of the Nek. According to the &quot;Australian Dictionary of Biography&quot;:


A few weeks later, he fought at Hill 60:

Whilst recuperating from his wounds in London he was introduced to Katharine Susannah Prichard, an Australian journalist who had recently won a significant novel competition and would go on to be a famous author and socialist. He eventually returned to active service, rejoining the 10th Light Horse in the Middle East where he fought in a number of engagements, and achieved the rank of captain. He returned home in 1918, and in 1919 married Prichard after the war ended.

==Post-war, socialism and death==
In the following years Throssell was an outspoken opponent of war, and claimed that the suffering he had seen had made him a socialist. His stance on the futility of war outraged many people, especially as it was being expressed by a national war hero and the son of a respected and conservative former premier. His very public political opinions badly damaged his employment prospects, and he fell deeply into financial debt. On 19 November 1933, he killed himself, while his wife was on a tour of the Soviet Union.

==Memorials==

Hugo Vivian Hope Throssell was buried with full military honours in the Anglican section of Karrakatta cemetery, Perth. In 2014 the grave was refurbished and a new grave stone placed.

In 1954 an octagonal stone gazebo was dedicated to Throssell in Greenmount at the intersection of Great Eastern Highway and Old York Road. It stands opposite the Katharine Susannah Prichard Writers&#x27; Centre.

A ward at the former Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood was temporarily named in his honour.

Throssell&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. In 1983 his son Ric Throssell presented it to People for Nuclear Disarmament. The Returned Services League of Australia bought the medal and presented it to the Australian War Memorial.

A statue of Throssell was unveiled in the Avon Mall in Northam on Anzac Day 2015.

<text>The Collective for Living Cinema was an outpost of avant-garde cinema located on White Street in Lower Manhattan in the United States. It regularly presented work by filmmakers such as Ken Jacobs, Nick Zedd, Johan van der Keuken, Yvonne Rainer, Christine Vachon, Dziga Vertov, and many others who created films that were outside of the commercial mainstream in the United States. It also published a number of scholarly journals on film. Many of the founders studied film at Binghamton University together, where they developed a particular interest in the avant-garde.

==Formation==
In 1973 a group of film students from the Binghamton University Cinema Department looking to create a contemporary and fertile context for their work found The Collective for Living Cinema, an artist-run cooperative that would serve both as an exhibition venue and a center for production and discourse. Above the first program note was a miniature manifesto stating their intention to &quot;overcome the economic, social and political burdens of an art in chains.&quot; Lasting for 19 years, The Collective came to embody the under-defined moment between the canonized generation of &quot;the essential cinema&quot; and the transfiguration of film as &quot;new media&quot; embraced by the institutional hierarchy of the art world and subject to the theoretical, critical and economic tidal forces therein. Run as a multi-disciplinary venue, The Collective continuously engaged in a recovery of the recent past, championing the marginal and positing alternative film histories. The screening room was seen as a workshop in which this culture became immersed in its own brand of cinematic delirium. Annette Michelson pointed out that The Collective &quot;attempted to break down distinctions between industrial film and avant garde film, between films that form part of a classical canon and those which are on the margins or periphery of canonical taste.&quot; By &quot;maintaining and constantly questioning an exploratory attitude rather than by embalming predigested classical canon&quot;, Michelson stated, The Collective emerged in the 1980s as the &quot;liveliest&quot; New York film venue of its time.

==Relocation==
In the late 1980s, the Collective was forced to move from its 52 White Street location (due to legal and financial issues related to the building&#x27;s certificate of occupancy and the NYC building codes for motion picture theaters) to a new space across the street. With rising costs and the gentrification of TriBeCa, and reductions in funding from the then-beleaguered National Endowment for the Arts and the New York State Council on the Arts, the Collective closed its doors in 1991, transferring much of its material to Anthology Film Archives. The last home of the Collective, at 41 White Street, was for some time The Flea Theater before they moved to their current location.

==Members==
Original founders included Ken Ross, Philip Weisman, Lushe Sacker, Mark Graff, Amy Halpern, Andrea Graff, Renée Shafransky. Many people affiliated with the Collective for Living Cinema were or have gone on to be quite influential in media, such the late Alf Bold, the former programmer of the Arsenal Kino in Berlin, Judith Shulevitz, the columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Slate&quot;, and John Sloss, the attorney and film producer who has produced more than 40 films, including &quot;Far From Heaven&quot;, &quot;Before Sunset&quot;, &quot;Personal Velocity&quot;, and &quot;The Fog of War&quot;. Others are noted artists such as the filmmaker Lizzie Borden, who taught film editing at the Collective.

<text>Edward Everett Tanner III (18 May 1921 – 6 November 1976), known by the pseudonym Patrick Dennis, was an American author. His novel &quot;Auntie Mame: An irreverent escapade&quot; (1955) was one of the bestselling American books of the 20th century. In chronological vignettes, the narrator — also named Patrick — recalls his adventures growing up under the wing of his madcap aunt, Mame Dennis. Tanner wrote a sequel, titled &quot;Around the World with Auntie Mame&quot;, in 1958. He based the character of Mame Dennis on his father&#x27;s sister, Marion Tanner. Tanner also wrote several novels under the pseudonym Virginia Rowans.

&quot;I write in the first person, but it is all fictional. The public assumes that what seems fictional is fact; so the way for me to be inventive is to seem factual but be fictional.&quot; All of Tanner&#x27;s novels employ to some degree the traditional comic devices of masks, subterfuge and deception.

==Early life==
Edward Everett Tanner III was born in Chicago, Illinois to Edward Everett Tanner II and Florence (née Thacker) Tanner, and grew up in Evanston, Illinois. He had one sister, Barbara, later Mrs. Hastings. His father nicknamed him Pat before he was born after the Irish heavyweight boxer Pat Sweeney, &quot;a dirty fighter known for kicking his opponents.&quot; When he was old enough to say so, he let it be known that he liked Pat better than Edward, and so Pat he became. He attended Evanston Township High School, where he was popular and excelled in writing and theater.

==Career==
In 1942, he joined the American Field Service, working as an ambulance driver in North Africa and the Middle East.

He worked as an administrative assistant for Eileen J. Garrett and he told her Auntie Mame was based in part on her, according to her granddaughter.

The first edition of &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; spent 112 weeks on the bestseller list, selling more than 2 million copies in five languages. The manuscript was turned down by 15 publishers before being accepted by the Vanguard Press. At the height of its popularity, it was selling more than 1,000 copies per day; throughout 1955 and 1956, it sold between 1,000 and 5,000 per week. In 1956, with &quot;Auntie Mame&quot;, &quot;The Loving Couple: His (and Her) Story&quot;, and &quot;Guestward Ho!&quot;, Tanner became the first writer to have three books on the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list at the same time.

Working with longtime friend, actor and photographer Cris Alexander, Tanner created two parody memoirs, complete with elaborate photographs. The first, titled &quot;Little Me&quot;, recounts the escapades through life and love of glamour girl Belle Poitrine &quot;as told to Patrick Dennis.&quot; His wife, Louise, appeared as Pixie Portnoy in the book&#x27;s photographic illustrations, which included their children, their friends, and their housekeeper as well. The second &quot;bio,&quot; titled &quot;First Lady&quot; (1964), is the life story of Martha Dinwiddie Butterfield, oblivious wife of a robber baron who &quot;stole&quot; the U.S. presidency for 30 days at the turn of the century.

==Personal life==
On December 30, 1948, Tanner married Louise Stickney, with whom he had two children. He led a double life as a conventional husband and father, and as a bisexual in later life, becoming a well-known participant in Greenwich Village&#x27;s gay scene.

==Later years and death==
Tanner&#x27;s work fell out of fashion in the 1970s, and all of his books went out of print. In his later years, he left writing to become a butler, a job that his friends reported he enjoyed. At one time, he worked for Ray Kroc, the CEO of McDonald&#x27;s. His employers had no inkling that their butler, &quot;Edwards,&quot; was the famous author Patrick Dennis.

He died from pancreatic cancer in Manhattan at the age of 55, on November 6, 1976. At the turn of the 21st century, there was a resurgence of interest in his work, and subsequently many of his novels are once again available. His son, Dr. Michael Tanner, wrote introductions to several reissues of his father&#x27;s books. Some of Tanner&#x27;s original manuscripts are held at Yale University, others at Boston University.

==Adaptations in other media==
The 1956 Broadway production of &quot;Auntie Mame&quot;, starring Rosalind Russell, and the highly successful 1958 screen adaptation that followed, inspired Jerry Herman&#x27;s 1966 musical &quot;Mame&quot;, with Angela Lansbury in the lead. A 1974 film version starred Lucille Ball and Bea Arthur.

&quot;Little Me&quot; was turned into a musical in 1962, with book by Neil Simon and score by Cy Coleman and Carolyn Leigh, and Sid Caesar playing all the male roles. Bob Fosse won the Tony Award for Best Choreography. There have been several revivals of &quot;Little Me&quot;, most recently in 1998 with Martin Short, who won a Tony Award for Best Actor.

Two of Tanner&#x27;s novels were transformed into television sitcoms: 
* &quot;House Party&quot; (1954), about a supposedly wealthy family who were actually dead broke, was the inspiration for &quot;The Pruitts of Southampton&quot; (1966–67), starring Phyllis Diller, Grady Sutton, Gypsy Rose Lee, and Richard Deacon.
* Dennis&#x27;s book &quot;Guestward Ho!&quot; (1956) became the sitcom &quot;Guestward Ho!&quot; (1960–61), about city folk trying to run a dude ranch in New Mexico. The show starred Mark Miller, J. Carrol Naish, and Joanne Dru.

<text>The Wooden Horse is a 1950 British World War II war film directed by Jack Lee and starring Leo Genn, David Tomlinson and Anthony Steel. It is based on the book of the same name by Eric Williams, who also wrote the screenplay.

The film depicts the true events of an escape attempt made by POWs in the German prison camp Stalag Luft III. The wooden horse in the title of the film is a piece of exercise equipment the prisoners use to conceal their escape attempt as well as a reference to the Trojan Horse which was also used to conceal men within.

&quot;The Wooden Horse&quot; was shot in a low-key style, with a limited budget and a cast including many amateur actors.

==Plot==

The somewhat fictionalised version of the true story is set in Stalag Luft III — the POW camp where the real events depicted in the film &quot;The Great Escape&quot; took place, albeit from a different compound – and involved Williams, Michael Codner and Oliver Philpot, all inmates of the camp. In the book and film the escapees are renamed Flight Lieutenant Peter Howard, Captain John Clinton and Philip Rowe.

The prisoners are faced with the problem of digging an escape tunnel despite the accommodation huts, within which the tunnel entrance might be concealed, being a considerable distance from the perimeter fence. They come up with an ingenious way of digging the tunnel with its entrance located in the middle of an open area relatively near the perimeter fence and using a vaulting horse (constructed largely from plywood from Canadian Red Cross parcels) to cover the entrance.

Recruiting fellow prisoners to form a team of vaulters, each day they carry the horse out to the same spot, with a man hidden inside. The prisoners begin gymnastic exercises using the vaulting horse while the concealed man digs down below it. At the end of the session the digger places wooden boards, cut to fit the aperture, in the hole and fills the space with sandbags and dry sand kept for the purpose – wet sand taken from below the surface would be darker and hence give away the tunnelling activity.

As the tunnel lengthens, two men are eventually hidden inside the horse while a larger group of men exercise. At the end of the day they conceal the tunnel entrance once more and hide inside the horse while it is carried back to their hut. They also devise a method of disposing of the earth from the tunnel. They recruit a third man, Phil, to assist them, with the promise that he will join the escape.

At the final break-out Clinton hides in the tunnel during an &quot;Appell&quot; (roll call) before three men are carried out in the horse: the third to replace the tunnel trap.

Howard and Clinton travel by train to the Baltic port of Lübeck; (in fact they travelled via Frankfurt an der Oder to Stettin). Phil elects to travel alone, posing as a Norwegian margarine salesman and travelling by train via Danzig (now Gdańsk). He was the first to get to neutral territory.

On the docks Howard and Clinton are forced to kill a German sentry who surprised the hiding men; and they contact French workers, through whom they meet &quot;Sigmund&quot;, a Danish resistance worker who smuggles them onto a Danish ship. They then have to transfer to a fishing boat and arrive in Copenhagen before being shipped to neutral Sweden. There they are reunited with Phil, who arrived earlier.

Some details from Williams&#x27; book were not used in the film, e.g. the escaped POWs discussing the possibility of visiting potentially neutral brothels in Germany, an idea that was abandoned because of the fear that it might be a trap.

==Production==
The film was based on a book by Eric Williams, which had been published in 1949. The book was reissued in 1980.

Ian Dalrymple and Jack Lee read the book and bought the film rights. They out-bid John Mills who also wanted to make it. &quot;I expect John would have been very good in it also,&quot; said Jack Lee &quot;probably better than Leo Genn, who was very stolid as an actor.&quot;

Leo Genn played the Eric Williams character while Anthony Steele played a character based on Michael Codner. Codner was killed in 1952 in an ambush during the Malayan Emergency.

&quot;We are not inventing anything,&quot; Lee said during filming. &quot;It isn&#x27;t necessary. The whole book is dynamite as a film script.&quot;

===Shooting===
Three-quarters of the film was shot in Germany. The Stalag was rebuilt in the British zone near where the Germans surrendered at Lüneburg Heath.

In the film the escapees go to Lübeck, not Stettin, which is what happened in real life. This was because the producers did not want to have to deal with the Russian Occupied Zone.

The film went over budget, for several reasons: the weather was poor and several scenes had to be done again. &quot;A lot of it was my fault, taking too long to shoot and shooting too much stuff,&quot; said Lee. He added &quot;there was indecision on my producer&#x27;s part about the ending; Ian said we should shoot things in two different ways. The ultimate ending was a perfectly reasonable one but I was off the film by then. Ian shot it himself.&quot;

Filming was finished in Germany by January 1950, after which studio work was done in London.

At least two future film directors, Bryan Forbes and David Greene, were in the supporting cast.

The film was a breakthrough role for Anthony Steel. &quot;Tony Steel was fine to work with – just a physical type, a young chap who could do certain things,&quot; said Lee. According to &quot;Filmink&quot; &quot;he is clearly meant to be &quot;the cute one&quot; of the trio, spending a considerable amount of the film’s running time walking around in shorts bare-chested.&quot;

The actor Peter Butterworth, who had been a prisoner in Stalag Luft III during the Second World War, and auditioned for a part in the film but the producers said he didn&#x27;t look convincing enough.

Producer Ian Dalrymple made the movie for Alexander Korda&#x27;s British Lion after a long association with the Rank Organisation. According to J. Arthur Rank&#x27;s biographer, the movie &quot;provided a particularly interesting example of the way Korda could help his directors in a way that Rank was not capable of doing; Ian Dalrymple showed him a rough cut and asked his advice, and they worked out an idea for re-takes which gave the film considerably more warmth.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical===
&quot;Variety&quot; said &quot;a commendable degree, of documentary fidelity has been established in this picturization of the escape of three prisoners of war from a German camp* The long and torturous period of preparation is faithfully recaptured. Inevitably, treatment rules out a fast-moving production, and although this won’t harm it as a boxoffice attraction at home, it may have a limiting appeal when it eventually reaches the US.&quot;

===Box office===
The film was the third most popular film at the British box office in 1950. According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; the &#x27;biggest winners&#x27; at the box office in 1950 Britain were &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot;, &quot;The Happiest Days of Your Life&quot;, &quot;Annie Get Your Gun&quot;, &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot;, &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;Odette&quot;, with &quot;runners up&quot; being &quot;Stage Fright&quot;, &quot;White Heat&quot;, &quot;They Were Not Divided&quot;, &quot;Trio&quot;, &quot;Morning Departure&quot;, &quot;Destination Moon&quot;, &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot;, &quot;Little Women&quot;, &quot;The Forsythe Saga&quot;, &quot;Father of the Bride&quot;, &quot;Neptune&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, &quot;The Dancing Years&quot;, &quot;The Red Light&quot;, &quot;Rogues of Sherwood Forest&quot;, &quot;Fancy Pants&quot;, &quot;Copper Canyon&quot;, &quot;State Secret&quot;, &quot;The Cure for Love&quot;, &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot;, &quot;Stromboli&quot;, &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;, &quot;Pinky&quot;, &quot;Three Came Home&quot;, &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; and &quot;Black Rose&quot;.

It led to a series of stories about POWs, including &quot;Albert R.N.&quot; (1953), &quot;The Colditz Story&quot; (1955), &quot;The One That Got Away&quot; (1957), &quot;The Camp on Blood Island&quot; (1958) and &quot;Danger Within&quot; (1959).

==Historical accuracy==
The &quot;Wooden Horse&quot; plan itself was previously thought to be conceived and entirely thought through by Williams and Michael Codner in equal measures. In Oliver Philpot&#x27;s later book, &quot;The Stolen Journey&quot;, the author made it clear that he initially thought the plan was &quot;crackers&quot;, telling its inventors &quot;I give it a couple of days!&quot; Nevertheless Philpot helped with the sand dispersal and later with the actual digging – at which point he was invited to take part in the escape.

However it has been argued that Flt Lt Dominic Bruce (the &#x27;Medium Sized man&#x27;) and Squadron Leader Peter Tunstall were the original innovators of the wooden-horse-escape technique. Along with Eustace Newborn and Peter Tunstall, Bruce came up with the escape plan now known as &quot;the Swiss Red Cross Commission&quot;. Tunstall wrote that in 1941, prior to him and Bruce planning an escape with the famed &#x27;Swiss Red Cross Commission&#x27;, he and Bruce had been digging an escape route with a wooden horse tunnel from inside the gymnasium, the wooden horse being placed roughly four feet from the wall that separated the gym from the moat. The digging was a very slow process. It required the removal of spoil, bricks and stonework and was aided by other prisoners distracting the guards. They were later joined by Douglas &#x27;Sammy&#x27; Hoare and a syndicate who were promised a second go if they escaped undiscovered. Other members of this syndicate were also named as Harry Bewlay, John Milner and Eustace Newborn.

When Bruce and Tunstall noted the slow process they began examining the rest of the castle and left the digging to the other team involving Sammy Hoare. The tunnel almost reached completion but unfortunately the digging team got caught when a guard become suspicious at the large stones that were accumulating outside the gym. The guard called a search and found the escape tunnel.[49] When the guards found the shaft they held an Appell and Hauptmann Schmidt confidently stated to the prisoners, &quot;It is impossible to escape by tunnel or any other way.&quot;

This wooden horse gym escape tunnel was two years prior to the famed Sagan wooden horse escape. Tunstall stated that he would like to think some of the watchers and workers who helped on their original wooden horse escape may have mentioned it from time to time and would like to think that their idea contributed to the success of the effort at Sagan.

<doc id="1191731" wikidata="Q6942249" url="?curid=1191731" title="Music of Punjab">
<text>Music of Punjab reflects the traditions of the Punjab region associated with Punjabi language. Punjab is currently divided into two parts: East Punjab, in India, and West Punjab, the most populous province of Pakistan. The Punjab has diverse styles of music, ranging from folk and Sufi to classical, notably the Patiala gharana. Contemporary Punjabi music has tended to include more modern hip-hop and R&amp;B sounds. While this style of music is obviously most popular in Punjab, it has seen popularity across the subcontinent and areas with large Punjabi diaspora populations, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

===Instruments===

During the past century, Punjabi folk musicians used 87 instruments, 55 of which are still used today. It is notable that the instruments used today serve a function that exceeds musical necessity in that they are closely tied to Punjabi culture and heritage. The dhol, for example, continues to be popular because it is important to special proceedings such as weddings and sporting events. Additionally, the popularity of certain instruments encourages people to continue learning to play them; therefore, maintaining their relevance in Punjabi events. The following instruments are the most popular within Punjabi music. 
Algoza:
The algoza “consists of two joined beak flutes, one for melody, the second for drone” and the “flutes are either tied together or may be held together loosely with the hands”. A continuous flow of air is necessary as the player blows into the two flutes simultaneously.

Dhol: 
Resembles much of the construction of a drum. It is a two-sided drum of mango wood, 48 cm long and 38 cm wide and is played using two slightly curved sticks. It is thought to have a much more significant value to the artisans such as the blacksmiths or the cobblers. It is usually played during neutral occasions and mostly by only men.

Chimta:
The chimta are similar to tongs and consist of 122 cm long iron strip that is bent in half and adorned with an iron ring set. The small metal discs called chaene are “attached on the inner side of the tongs so as to strike against each other like small cymbals when the arms of the chimta are struck”.

Dholki: 
The dholki is a smaller, feminine version of the dhol. It is played by women in marriages and religious gatherings. It is rarely decorated with tassels.

Kanjari:
This is a shallow one sided drum, round or sometimes octagonal, 18 to 28 cm in diameter and set with rattling discs around the rim- in essence of a tambourine. It accompanies singing, dances and religious activities.

Kato:
This a stick with a squirrel (galad) on top. Attached to the head of the squirrel is a cord, which jerks its head up, “producing a sharp click”. At the same time, bells attached to its tail jingles.

Dhad:
The Dhad has the hourglass shape of the damroo and but is slightly larger. The body of this instrument is made from mango, mulberry or sheesham wood and the heads are covered in goatskin held taut with cords. The fingers are used to tap and make sounds that can vary based on how tightly or loosely the strings are maintained.

===Dances===
Dance traditions of Punjab represent a collection of folk art forms that have evolved significantly and changed in meaning throughout the centuries. After the Partition of 1947, Punjab was marked by a period state-building efforts that sought to establish a national identity, which was intimately tied to the revival, folklorization, and ritualization of many of Punjab&#x27;s older dances. During this period, bhangra dance in particular became tokenized as the iconic emblem of the Punjab region as a whole, overshadowing other important and centuries-old folk dances of the region. Punjab&#x27;s rich repertoire of folk dances include jhummar, sammi, luddi, dandas, nachar, and giddha. There are prominent dances in Punjab, but are perhaps less familiar to a global audience. Jhummar is A widely established Punjabi dance, there was a decline in jhummar performances, through it was later revived as a conscious reaction to the over-commodified and over-sensationalized bhangra dance to invoke a more traditional notion of Punjab. The name jhummar stems from ghoomar, designated a performance done in a circular direction or group of individuals spinning. It is generally performed only be men, and the movement are generally “relatively slow and gentle, and often considered rather “feminine” when compared to other Punjabi dances. Dance movements are performed in unison.&quot; Musical accompaniment usually involves the dhol barrel drum. Summi is a simple female dominated dance traditionally performed by women in the Sandal Bar region of Punjab that has existed from at least the eighteenth century that was revived after the Partition of 1947. Giddha is a dance of the Malwa, Southeast region of Punjab that has both expression in men and women&#x27;s forms, and involves pairs of individuals dancing while others stand in a circle around them singing lyrical verses (boliyan).

==Devotional music==

===Gurbani Sangeet===
Gurbani sangeet (Gurmukhi: ਗੁਰਬਾਣੀ ਸੰਗੀਤ&quot;),&quot; also known as &quot;Gurmat Sangeet&quot; (Gurmukhi: ਗੁਰਮਤਿ ਸੰਗੀਤ)&quot;,&quot; is the classical music style that is practised with Sikhi. In this musical tradition, the Sikhs sing shabads which are hymns written by their SatGuru in raag. Instruments used in this art are known as “tanti saaj” (stringed instruments; ਤੰਤੀ ਸਾਜ਼). The majority of these instruments had been invented by the Sikh Gurus. They include: the &#x27;Firandia&#x27; Rabab, Saranda, Jori, Pakhaawaj, Taus, and the Dilruba. Etymologically , the word &quot; shabad&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit word Shabda which means sound or word. Preaching of Sikh Gurus is called bani or ‘’transcript of Sikh Satgurus, which is set to music in various Sikh scriptures called granths”. The most notorious granth is the Satguru, Sri Guru Granth Sahib. The Satguru, Sri Guru Granth Sahib is not only the Sikh’s eternal SatGuru (and so is given the utmost deference) it is also divided into chapters which are raags rather than aspects of life. The first Shabad in SatGuru Granth Sahib is the Mool Mantar. Examples of Shabad in other Sikh scriptures, include the hymn Deh Siva Var Mohe in Dasam Granth. The raags that are sung are common to Hindustani classical music. Some raags have also been created by the Sikh’s in SatGuru Sri Guru Granth Sahib for example, raag jaijaivanti was created by the 9th SatGuru Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib. Ghar is a musical sign, used at the top of the Shabad in the Satguru, Sri Guru Granth Sahib. It gives a hint to Raagees as to what musical clef (beat) to sing the Shabad in. In other words, &quot;Ghar&quot; binds music and poetry in their metrical-form. There are up to seventeen &quot;Ghar&quot; mentioned in the SGGS. Musicologists have different interpretations of this term. But the consensus seems to be that it denotes the parts of a Taal (beat). Gurmukhi script is used for the Shabad. “Ragees” are the Sikh singers of Gurmat Sangeet. Ragees form groups of three or more consisting of a percussionist, a backup singer and the main singer. Rababees are the main singers of Gurmat sangeet and are ancestors of the first rababee Bhai Mardana. Since the first SatGuru, the rababees have been the main singers of Gurmat Sangeet however, since the partition of India and Pakistan, rababees had been unable to perform Gurmat sangeet, with ragis taking the responsibility

===Sufi music===

Sufi music includes the singing of Sufi poetry in several genres. Some of the poets whose compositions are often sung include Baba Farid, Bulleh Shah, Shah Hussain, Waris Shah, and Mian Muhammad Bakhsh.

== Folk music ==

Folk music of the Punjab is the traditional music of Punjab produced using traditional musical instruments like Tumba, Algoza, Dhadd, Sarangi, Chimta and more. There is a wide range of folk songs for every occasion from birth to death including marriage, festivals, fairs and religious ceremonies.

Folk music is often perceived as the traditional music of Punjab and typically has communal authorship. This aspect of folk music has shifted with time but the older categories of folk begin with the dhadi genre, which does follow ideas of communal authorship. The folk dhadi genre emphasizes stories of heroism and love stories, as exemplified by the numerous ballads of the legendary romantic tales of Hir-Ranjha and Sahiba-Mirza. Folk music is also commonly used in various life-cycle events in the Punjab region. “In almost every wedding ceremony family members, friends, and professional folk musicians perform different sets of folk songs which use themes from a nostalgic past, but communicate themes of separation, joy, fear, and hope in the present.” The lyrical content of many of these wedding songs have the paternal home depicted as a source of love and nurture, while the in-laws home is a source of tyranny and torture. Folk music continues to be used as a modern tool and a way of locating identification.

===Ritual and life-cycle songs===
The notion of the traditional or folk music remains a critical part of Punjab society because it aids in the preservation of long-established customs. Life-cycle songs mostly “coincide with ritual occasions and they often mark stages in a ceremony” and can vary in topic ranging from birth to marriage. For example, family members and friends sing these songs during wedding festivities, by doing so help protect the traditional rituals associated with each step of the marriage. &quot;Suhag&quot; or &quot;ghorian&quot;, which are sung for the bride and groom respectively, typically give praise to God and ask for blessings from God. Women typically sing these songs in a choral fashion and may also focus on the ideal groom and bride. Both song genres celebrate the emotion of joy specifically surrounding the wedding process. The ghorian emotes feeling of “pure joy and desire”, while the suhag is a “mixture of joy and grief”. There are also songs that are associated with each night of the wedding starting as far back as five nights before to spread turmeric paste on the bride and groom. By having these songs, Punjabi people continue to celebrate the traditional cultural practices and have “transformed and even...revitalized” the way marriages are celebrated.

While folk songs exist to commemorate important moments in one&#x27;s life, they also “serve as a repository of local culture, beliefs, social structures, and response to historical change” because they reflect the current climate within local communities. With the subject of these songs varying from praising God to simply discussing the qualms of an agrarian lifestyle, they provide greater insight into Punjabi daily life. While folks song are “set in complex cultural context of a society” that is consumed by a strict social system influenced by social and economic status, they reveal that these “village people of all levels interact daily in a manner that demonstrates their mutual codependence”. Because of this, folk music serves as a way to further encourage this mixture that helps to break down social constructs.

===Short verse forms and entertainment songs===
These include Tappa, Mahia, and Dhola.

===Professional musicians and genres===
Professional performing communities in Punjab represent endogamous ethnic groups who generally occupy a lower-class status of service providers and are patronized by higher classes. Generally, men dominant professional music production and are trained in the ‘master-disciple’ system. Professional musicians are occupational speciationalists who inherit their professions through their musician ancestors. The most prominent group are the Mirasis, which an umbrella occupational label used to designate all hereditary musicians. Mirasis serve as genealogists and are responsible for committing to memory and singing the praises their lineages. Mirasis are generally Muslims (settled in West Punjab) who emerged from the “Dum” group and encompass many performing communities that “differ depending on kinship practices, musical sophistication, and sociomusical contexts.” Other professional performing communities include the tribal Bazigar group, performers of the dhadi and tumba-algoza genre.

Bazigar (Goaar) people: From their base in West Punjab in the pre-Partition era, Bazigar performers carried both traditions that were unique to their community and those that were typical of the local residents of that area. However, despite their contributions to the music world and performing sector of Punjab, they are poorly recognized by their neighbors and outsiders. mainstream Punjab classifies these people as the “acrobats” of the society. The Bazigar people have neither inclination nor the opportunity to remedy that situation. At present they are becoming more and more integrated into the mainstream society. Their performances consist of the display of a variety of physical feats- of strength, balance, agility, and courage. Performances were usually invited by big festivals and occasions. They would begin with the beating of the dhols in order to enhance excitement and call attention to the event.

Dhadi: Refers to both a genre of Punjabi music and the performers who play it. It is a distinctly composed ensemble of ballad-singers. The folk dhadi genre is subject to three main poetic forms namely baint, sadd, and kali. It has four main aspects: discourse, poetry, singing and music. The concerts were usually held outside of villages on the banks of a pond or in some other open space under the dense shade of a few large tree, or else the religious-camps of the village. A distinctive feature of the folk dhadi&#x27;s art has been a continuous and strict practice regimen. Usually these dhadis were completely illiterate or practically so. They would have to learn by hearing others, so their power of memory, would have to be very great. Their attire usually consisted of dazzling white, starched turbans with fan. The white color is a symbol of wisdom, learning and cleanliness. Another ballad-style form of music is the tumba-algoza genre based in the regions of Malwa and Majha.

==Popular music==

=== History of Popular Music Recording ===
Dhādī and Dāstāngo groups recorded the first records of Punjabi popular music in the 1930s. They chose to record arrangements of weighty ballads that were appropriate listening entertainment because they were often performed at a fair or at a wedding. Shortly afterward, cinema with sound became available in India, and throughout the 1930s-1950s film songs dominated the recordings of popular music in Punjab. These songs were accompanied by Indian instruments and Western instrumentation. Many of the most famous actor-singers in India came from Punjab, including Kundan Lal Saigal, Noor Jahan, and Shamshad Begum.

In the 1950s, commercial recordings of folk-style Punjabi music began. Lal Chand “Yamla Jatt” was among the prominent voices of these recordings. While his stage name suggested he belonged to the Jat ethnicity, Lal Chand was belonged to the Chamar community, which was marginalized as opposed to mainstream, like the Jat ethnicity. He also developed the &quot;tūmbī&quot;, a one-stringed instrument that is now iconic for Punjabi “folk” singers.

In the 1960s, a new type of popular “folk song” began to be recorded. The majority of these songs were not orally transmitted, anonymous compositions, and many were composed by contemporary songwriters, in a parallel to the folk movement in the UK and the United States. The songs themselves were considered “folk” because they were simple and in Punjabi language, but the accompaniments and musical settings mimicked film-song instead of rural music. An example of a singer in this style would be Singh Mastana, who really emphasized Punjabi identity. Another famous example is Surinder Kaur, who was born into a Sikh, Jat family that did not approve of singing, but who had a very successful career.

By the 1980s, the introduction of affordable cassette players made it possible for independent music labels to flourish in Punjab. These independent labels had lower operating costs, so they were able to offer more regional music. In contrast to previous music that only had explicitly Punjabi content in the songs in order to make the music Punjabi, this new music had a Punjabi instrumentation and rustic vocal tone to make the music sound Punjabi. Some examples of artists who made this style of music include K.S. Narula and Charanjit Ahuja. A popular format in the genre were duets recorded by artists like Chamkila and Amarjot.

===Bhangra evolution from folk to pop===
Bhangra is a music-oriented popular dance with Punjabi rhythms. The name refers to one of the traditional and folkloric Punjabi dances. Thus in bhangra music the emphasis is usually on the music (i.e. rhythm for dancing) and less on the singer and the lyrics. Shift from folk instruments to pop started to happen since the 1980s, since then Bhangra dance music developed into a popular pop genre appreciated all over the globe, specially among the Punjabi diaspora.

===Punjabi pop===

Punjabi songs in recent years have entered mainstream Indian culture, as well as in the UK and U.S., and its inclusion in Bollywood songs. The rise in popularity in Punjabi music in London and in the suburb of Southall, which has a sizeable South Asian population, can be attributed to the diaspora of immigrants from both the east and west Punjab to the United Kingdom in the 1970s. By the 1980s, Punjabi music, many types of which were now being referred to as “bhangra,” started to be played in discos.

In addition to the UK, Punjabi music has also gained popularity in the United States. This inclusion of Punjabi music in popular culture has continued and become more salient today, as exemplified by UK-based Panjabi MC&#x27;s “Mundian to Bach Ke” becoming a Top 40 hit in the United States, being listened to widely by non-Punjabis. Furthermore, second generation Indian American youth in major American cities such as New York and New Jersey have adopted elements of Punjabi music into their nightlife. The music that is popular amongst this Indian American subculture incorporates both Western and Eastern influences. Urban sounds including hip hop, R&amp;B, and reggae are mixed with the more traditional Indian genres of bhangra and Hindi film music.

Punjabi music has also made its mark in mainstream Hindi cinema. It has typically been characterized as “an ethnocultural signifier of Panjabi celebration,” and more recently, “a national signifier of fun.”

====Diaspora developments====

Although the diaspora of Punjabi music to western countries such as the United Kingdom first became popular in the 1980s, the trend continued into the 1990s. In the UK in particular, Punjabi music became intertwined with American and British popular music, as Punjabi youth connected their western experience with their cultural roots. It became an important medium through which Punjabi youth could navigate their unique identities as British Indians. The British press sporadically became aware of trends in Punjabi music, especially with the rise of popular artists such as Panjabi MC and Apache Indian; that said, however, the diaspora of Punjabi music was primarily a local phenomenon, limited to Punjabi communities in the UK.

The 1990s marked a significant shift in Punjabi music pertaining to production styles and lyrical content. The decade was marked by a musical style that contained consistent elements of traditional music including instruments such as the dhol, tumbi, and algoza. However, the 90s were the first time that elements from other genres such as reggae and disco/club type of instrumentals were incorporated in the music. This is seen as the decade that produced the birth of what is commonly referred to today as “fusion” Punjabi music.

One prime example of a breakthrough artist that exemplified this new fusion style was Apache Indian. His song “Arranged Marriage,” produced by British Indian Punjabi brothers Simon and Diamond and released on the album titled No Reservations (1993), combined a reggae lyrical style, traditional dhol elements, and a Punjabi background chorus. Many more prominent Punjabi artists and producers broke through into mainstream Punjabi music during this time. They included Bally Sagoo, Sukshinder Shinda, and Jazzy B. Bally Sagoo became famous for his productions and remix. Shinda became renowned for his production ability and inclusion of vigorous dhol beats, while Jazzy B exemplified the influence hip-hop had in Punjabi music in his image and tough lyrics.

====Global Punjabi music industry====

Diaspora music has been spread back to India through media, including radio, cassettes and the TV channels MTV and ETC Panjabi. The 2000s Diaspora music was a reflection of the evolution that took place in Punjabi music in the 1990s. Artists began to develop and build upon the styles and foundations that were previously established as popular and successful musical styles abroad.

With the mixture of styles of both Punjabi and Western culture, there became a fusion in both the music and the identity formation of those living abroad. Because samples of famous Hindi and Punjabi music have been included in the club scene, youth are able to “inculcate an Indian identity.” Youth of the Diaspora can use these fusions to help establish their hybrid identities. These identities could include urban American culture or British culture alongside Indian culture. While this new identity has been created by the Diaspora youth the same ideas of identity do not hold for older generations, causing divides between the two.

The artists of this time period and the music they produced had a large effect on the popularity and transformation of Punjabi music into a type of genre that became an enjoyable and popular component of nightlife for South Asians. Dr. Zeus for example produced club-friendly instrumentals and collaborated with established Punjabi artists to take the fusion sound to a higher and more sophisticated level. His song “Kangna” reflects a fusion between club, hip-hop, and Punjabi musical styles. While Punjabi MC became famous in the late 1990s for his hit “Mundian tho Bachke Rahin,” he has continued to produce music that reflects a similar style and is extremely popular with the first and second generation South Asian population. These styles continue to progress into the present decade.

By 2016, Punjabi music grew by 80% over two to three years in Canada, where Punjabi folk hop artists, such as Jaz Dhami, credit Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for his contribution for &quot;promoting Indian culture and Punjabi music ... leader who understands the importance of Punjabi music in his country&#x27;s music space.&quot;

The post-2020 Punjabi music scene saw a surge of new stars like Shubh, AP Dhillon, Karan Aujla alongside Diljit Dosanjh. Shubh&#x27;s debut album “Still Rollin” and its title track both razed through Billboard Canada Albums Chart and Billboard Hot 100 Chart. AP Dhillon&#x27;s global hit &#x27;Excuses&#x27; topped Spotify India &amp; reached millions worldwide. Punjabi superstar Diljit Dosanjh made a memorable debut on &#x27;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,&#x27; performing his hit tracks &#x27;G.O.A.T&#x27; and &#x27;Born To Shine.&#x27; Introduced by Fallon as &quot;the biggest Punjabi artist on the planet&quot;. To explore new-age popular punjabi hits popular music streaming services like spotify offers music playlists dedicated to contemporary Punjabi music.

<doc id="1191735" wikidata="Q1093540" url="?curid=1191735" title="Magnolia macrophylla">
<text>Magnolia macrophylla, the bigleaf magnolia, is a deciduous magnolia native to the southeastern United States and eastern Mexico. This species boasts the largest simple leaf and single flower of any native plant in North America.

==Classification==

&quot;Magnolia macrophylla&quot; has three subspecies; some botanists treat these plants as three separate species:

*&quot;Magnolia macrophylla&quot; subsp. &quot;macrophylla&quot;. Bigleaf magnolia. Southeastern United States. Secure. Tree to 65 foot; leaves 20-35 inch long, fruit 1.5–4 inch long with more than 50 carpels.
*&quot;Magnolia macrophylla&quot; subsp. &quot;ashei&quot; (Wetherby) Spongberg. Ashe magnolia. Northwest Florida. Shrub or small tree to 40 foot; leaves 10–23 inch long, fruit 1.5–2.3 inch long with less than 50 carpels. Considered by some botanists to be a distinct species, &quot;Magnolia ashei.&quot;
*&quot;Magnolia macrophylla&quot; subsp. &quot;dealbata&quot; (Zuccarini) J. D. Tobe. Mexican bigleaf magnolia, Cloudforest magnolia, or eloxochitl. Mexico (Hidalgo to Oaxaca and Veracruz, in cloud forests). Tree to 65 foot; leaves 11–24 inch long, fruit 3–6 inch long with more than 70 carpels. Considered by some botanists to be a distinct species, &quot;Magnolia dealbata.&quot;

==Description==
The bigleaf magnolia is a medium-sized understory tree 50–65 feet tall. This species is distinguished from other magnolias by the large leaf size, 10–32 inch long and 4–35 inch broad. The largest leaf to be reported by a credible source is 3 ft 8 in (110 centimeters) in length. in addition to a six inch (15 centimeter) petiole. The leaf&#x27;s width can be up to eighteen inches (45 centimeters). The tree&#x27;s branches often bend under the weight of this heavy foliage. The flowers are typically six or nine-petaled (two or three whorls of three petals each, the larger ones with a dime-sized purple blotch at the base). The flower has as many as 580 stamens and 
is typically about sixteen inches (41 centimeters) wide, although there have been specimens as large as 21.5 inches (55 centimeters) in width. It is the largest temperate (non-tropical) flower in the world. This, like all Magnolias, is beetle pollinated. The fruit is a cone-like cluster of achenes. The mature seeds, each covered with an orange aril, hang down from the cone on silk-like threads. making themselves readily available to passing birds.

===Bee Mortality===
At the Arnold Arboretum, dead bees have been observed inside Bigleaf magnolia flowers.

==Distribution and habitat==
Bigleaf magnolia is found in rich mesic woods; any disturbance that lets more light reach the ground is beneficial to the establishment of bigleaf magnolia, but despite its relatively fast growth-rate when stimulated by more light, other understory and canopy trees/seedlings are usually able to outgrow and out-compete it. This suits the plant just fine as it is tolerant of low light levels; it does not need full sun to survive once established (however, it does not tolerate full shade). Natural regeneration is quite limited due to the scarcity of mature, seed-bearing plants and the fact that this tree&#x27;s population mostly consists of widely scattered individuals. In addition, this species is plagued by poor seed set (most likely from limiting factors mentioned above) and low seed viability, a trait shared by its cousin and frequent associate in the wild in Appalachia, the &quot;Fraser magnolia.&quot;

The Ashe magnolia is a rare shrub, exceptionally a small tree, that is found only along the bluffs and ravines adjacent to the Apalachicola River in Florida, along with several other rare plants unique to the area, such as Florida Yew and Florida torreya. It resembles the typical subsp. &quot;macrophylla&quot;, but has shorter, broader leaves, smaller flowers, and longer fruits. The flowers bloom in late spring, and are white with rose-purple blotches on the inner tepals. The fruit is eaten by wildlife, but because of the plant&#x27;s scarceness, it does not form a significant portion of any creature&#x27;s diet.

In the southeastern United States, especially Alabama and surrounding areas, &quot;Magnolia macrophylla&quot; is sometimes called the &quot;cowcumber magnolia,&quot; in contrast with the much smaller-leaved cucumber-tree magnolia, &quot;M. acuminata.&quot;

==Threats==
Collection, both legal and illegal, may have an adverse impact on this tree&#x27;s population due to low population density, and high collection pressure can extirpate this species locally. Bigleaf magnolia is listed as threatened in North Carolina and endangered in Arkansas and Ohio. The Florida Department of Agriculture lists the Ashe magnolia as endangered, due to its small population and restricted range. The Mexican bigleaf magnolia is also endangered, by loss of habitat.

==Cultivation==
Bigleaf magnolia is often short-lived under cultivation unless its rather demanding requirements are met. This tree likes loose, undisturbed rich mesic soil (or mulch and compost substitutes) in full sun or part shade with moist, well-drained soil and a low pH. This tree will likely succeed in sites that closely mimic its natural habitat and where it is protected from strong wind that can tatter its large foliage. It can be grown farther north than its southerly range suggests, but needs watering during extended dry periods. This plant is generally problem-free.

<text>Frederick Albert Tilston VC (June 11, 1906 – September 23, 1992) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Tilston attended De La Salle College &quot;Oaklands&quot;, an all-boys military prep school in Toronto, Ontario and was a graduate of the University Of Toronto and the Ontario College of Pharmacy. He got a job in pharmaceutical sales in Toronto.

==Military service==
Tilston served in the Essex Scottish Regiment in an administrative role. By early 1945, he held the rank of acting Major. During the Battle of the Rhineland, he volunteered to go forward and lead an infantry company in an attack on German positions in the Hochwald Forest just west of the Rhine River.

On 1 March 1945, near Uedem, Germany, he led &quot;C&quot; Company in a 500-yard attack across muddy terrain soaked by recent rain and snow, through barbed wire and enemy automatic weapons fire. After being slightly wounded by shell fragments in the head, he personally destroyed one enemy machine gun position with a hand grenade, and led the men of C company on to a second German line of resistance when he was wounded for the second time in the hip. He struggled to his feet and led his men forward where the Essex Scottish overran the enemy positions with rifle butts, bayonets and knives in close hand-to-hand combat. While consolidating the Canadian position against German counterattacks and on his 6th trip from a neighbouring unit bringing ammunition and grenades to his company, which had been depleted to about 25% of its usual strength or 40 men, Tilston was wounded for the 3rd time in the leg. He was found almost unconscious in a shell hole and refused medical attention while he organized his men for defence against German counter-attacks, emphasized the necessity of holding the position at all cost, and ordered his one remaining officer to take command. For conspicuous gallantry and steadfast determination in the face of battle, Tilston was awarded the Victoria Cross.

==Later life==
Due to his wounds sustained in the fighting, he lost both his legs and an eye. He joined The War Amps Association (a non-profit organization of &quot;amputees helping amputees&quot; in 1945.

He returned to his former place of business as vice-president in charge of pharmaceutical sales.
In 1957, he became president and CEO of Sterling Drug in Windsor, Ontario, overseeing its move to Aurora, Ontario in 1958. He served as president until 1970. He later moved from Aurora to Kettleby, Ontario before returning to Toronto.

He resided in Toronto, Ontario until his death on 23 September 1992. He was buried at Mount Hope Cemetery, Erskine Avenue, Toronto, Ontario, Canada in the Roman Catholic section. His headstone is located in Plot 23 in the north west corner.

==Legacy==
Even into retirement Tilston was active throughout York County where a number of honours and memorials bear his name:
* The Aurora Royal Canadian Legion Branch 385 is named Colonel Fred Tilston VC Legion in his honour.
* The Cenotaph in Sharon, Ontario was unveiled by Tilston and bears his name.
* St. Andrew&#x27;s College (Aurora, Ontario) gives out Tilston Awards each year, to students who have &quot;shown courage in the face of adversity&quot;.
* The De La Salle Cadet Corps at De La Salle College (Toronto) &#x27;Oaklands&#x27;, Tilston&#x27;s alma mater, has named its primary body of cadets the &#x27;Tilston Platoon&#x27;.
* The Fitness and Sports Instructor 2011 senior cadet course in Cold Lake, Alberta has A1 Platoon named &#x27;Tilston Platoon&#x27;.

A joint training facility for the Essex Kent Scottish Regiment and the Windsor Police Service at 4007 Sandwich Street, Windsor, Ontario, is a first-of-its-kind in Canada partnership with the federal government Department of National Defence (DND). In recognition of his service to the Essex Kent Scottish Regiment, the training centre is named the Major F Tilston Armoury and Police Training Centre.

Tiltson&#x27;s Victoria Cross is currently held by the Royal Canadian Military Institute in Toronto.

A portrait of Tilston, painted by Canadian artist Brenda Bury, hangs in the Memorial Room at the Soldiers&#x27; Tower war memorial, University of Toronto.

<text>The Division of Forde is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland. The current MP is Bert van Manen of the Liberal Party.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

The division was created in 1984 and is named after Frank Forde, who was Prime Minister of Australia for seven days in 1945 following the death of John Curtin. When it was created it was a marginal seat in the southern suburbs of Brisbane, but it now has no territory in common with the original seat and is located in exurban and semi-rural areas south of the city, including Beenleigh and Loganlea.

It was a fairly safe seat for the Liberal Party after the 2004 election. Kay Elson announced that she would not re-contest her seat in the 2007 election. Wendy Creighton, a Boonah resident and editor of the local newspaper, the &quot;Fassifern Guardian&quot;, contested Forde as the Liberal candidate instead. She was defeated at the Federal election by Brett Raguse, the opposing Labor Party candidate, making Forde the safest Liberal Party seat to be claimed by the Labor Party at the 2007 election. The seat returned to the LNP with Bert van Manen in 2010. Incumbent van Manen then held on to the seat during the 2013, 2016 &amp; 2019 elections.

Ahead of the 2016 federal election, ABC psephologist Antony Green listed the seat in his election guide as one of eleven which he classed as bellwether electorates. Roy Morgan Research found the Division of Forde to be the least politically involved electorate in Australia, with only 7% of voters interested in political analysis as a type of media content.

<doc id="1191748" wikidata="Q223112" url="?curid=1191748" title="3-Pentanone">
<text>3-Pentanone (also known as diethyl ketone) is a simple, symmetrical dialkyl ketone. It is a colorless liquid ketone with an odor like that of acetone. It is soluble in about 25 parts water, but miscible with organic solvents.

==Uses==
3-Pentanone is primarily used as starting material in chemical synthesis. A major application is in the industrial synthesis of vitamin E. It has also been used in the synthesis of Oseltamivir (Tamiflu).

3-Pentanone itself finds some use as a specialty solvent in paint, although it is less common than butanone.

==Syntheses==

===Ketonic decarboxylation route===
3-Pentanone is produced by ketonic decarboxylation of propanoic acid using metal oxide catalysts:
:2 CH3CH2CO2H → (CH3CH2)2CO + CO2 + H2O

in the laboratory, the reaction can be conducted in a tube furnace.

===Carbonylation route===
It can also be prepared by combining ethylene, CO, and H2. When the reaction is catalyzed by dicobalt octacarbonyl, water can be used as a source of hydrogen. A proposed intermediate is the ethylene-propionyl species [CH3C(O)Co(CO)3(ethylene)] which undergoes a migratory insertion to form [CH3COCH2CH2Co(CO)3]. The required hydrogen arises from the water shift reaction. For details, see
If the water shift reaction is not operative, the reaction affords a polymer containing alternating carbon monoxide and ethylene units. Such aliphatic polyketones are more conventionally prepared using palladium catalysts.

==Safety==
The TLV value for 3-pentanone is 200 ppm (705 mg/m3). 3-pentanone can be hazardous if it comes in contact with the skin or eyes, and can cause irritation of the skin and redness, watering, and itching of the eyes. This chemical can also cause nervous system or organ damage if ingested. Although considered stable, 3-pentanone is extremely flammable if exposed to flame, sparks, or another source of heat. For safety, it should be stored in a flammable materials cabinet away from heat or sources of ignition, preferably in a cool, well-ventilated area.

<doc id="1191750" wikidata="Q507080" url="?curid=1191750" title="Ciudad Guayana">
<text>Ciudad Guayana () (English: Guayana City) is a city in Bolívar State, Venezuela. It stretches 40 kilometers along the south bank of the Orinoco river, at the point where it is joined by its main tributary, the Caroní river. The Caroní flows through the city from south to north, dividing it into its predominant halves — the old town of San Félix, to the east, and the newer area of Puerto Ordaz (), to the west. 

Ciudad Guayana was officially founded in 1961 by the unification of two former settlements, but the modern history of San Félix can be traced back to the eighteenth century. Located within the city limits are Cachamay Falls (part of Parque Cachamay) and Llovizna Falls. There are three bridges across the Caroní, and another crossing over the Orinoco, the Orinoquia Bridge, which was inaugurated in 2006. With approximately one million people in the greater metro area, Ciudad Guayana is Venezuela&#x27;s fastest-growing city with its important iron, steel, aluminum and hydroelectric industries. Additionally, Ciudad Guayana is one of Venezuela&#x27;s top-five most vital shipping locations (especially for most of the goods produced in Bolívar state), as ships and barges can easily access the port from the Atlantic Ocean via the Orinoco River.

Due to its planned nature, the city has a drastically different feel from many other South American cities. The towers of the Alta Vista district recall Barranquilla, and many of the residential neighborhoods have architecture and landscaping that are similar to suburbs in the United States from the 1950s through 1980s, such as subdivisions and &#x27;cookie-cutter&#x27; homes, neatly-paved sidewalks, and manicured, patterned lawns. This is partly due to the presence, in the 1960s and early 1970s, of US Steel, an American company with ironworks operations in the region. US Steel built housing for hundreds of its American immigrant workers and their families, who lived in Puerto Ordaz (and other communities) until the nationalization of the Venezuelan steel industry forced the company and its workers to cease operations.

Ciudad Guayana is located in a very strategic spot for the country of Venezuela. Many international visitors have traveled there throughout its young history, from Pope John Paul II to many former American presidents, such as G.W. Bush; various musicians, artists, and even filmmakers, like Steven Spielberg, have visited, utilizing the scenic landscaping and city parks for movies. 

Ciudad Guayana is served by Manuel Carlos Piar International Airport in Puerto Ordaz.

== History ==

The first explorations of Diego de Ordaz were organized in 1531. An expedition led by Juan González Sosa discovered previously unknown jungles and plains on the banks of the Orinoco River. In 1535, another expedition into the region was led by Lieutenant Alfonso Herrera. It was after the movements of conquest and colonization, when in 1591 Antonio de Berrio founded Santo Tome de Guayana at the confluence of the Caroni and Orinoco, in the country of Carapana near the Indian village of Cachamay.

The city was founded multiple times in different places, due to the continuous attacks of pirates and conquerors which destroyed it as they went down the Orinoco River in search of El Dorado.

In 1618, when he was near the old Guiana, an English expedition sent by Walter Raleigh sacked and destroyed the city entirely. In 1764, the residents were relocated to Angostura, now Ciudad Bolivar, due to the continuous attacks of English and Dutch pirates. The last foundation took place at its original site on July 2, 1961 and was called Ciudad Guayana. West of the city is the Matanzas Industrial Zone, the urban area of Puerto Ordaz in the middle east and San Felix.

For the design and city planning Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana requested the participation of the then Harvard–MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies (USA). The large and extensive program of building highways and avenues, residential areas, schools, hospitals and recreational facilities, continues with the same intensity since its inception, ready to house 2.5 million people in 2020. Since 1961, the city has been known as one of the fastest growing in the world.

Ciudad Guayana and the surrounding site have special interest to visitors. Within the city, the Caroni park consists of Drizzle, Cachamay and Loefling, which are a representative sample of the majesty and beauty of the Rio Caroni. Other amusement park attractions include the Foundation and Paseo Malecon San Felix. For those interested in the basic industries of Venezuela some of these have a visitation schedule that could be found through their respective managements of Public Relations. Nearby, less than 100 kilometers away it is Ciudad Bolívar, the historic site of Bolivar state. On the other side of the river is the Mission of Caroni (Caroni ruins), the Castillos de Guayana and forest plantations.

The Puerto Ordaz area was built and planned by the Companies Orinoco Mining Company and the Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana in the mid-twentieth century.

On November 13, 2006 the Orinoquia Bridge, the second largest in the country, opened. This facilitates communication between Ciudad Guayana and the opposite bank of the Orinoco in Anzoátegui and Monagas states.

== Geography ==
The city is located at the confluence of the Caroní and Orinoco River on a high plain situated approximately 200-300 feet above sea level. 

Ciudad Guayana is hot and humid most of the year, having a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: &quot;Aw&quot;) with a dry season from January to March.

==Economy==
Many of Venezuela&#x27;s prime industries are based in Puerto Ordaz. These include Alcasa, Venalum, Bauxilum, Carbonorca (primary aluminium manufacturers and anode suppliers for the aluminium industry), Ferrominera (iron ore processing), and Sidor (Orinoco Steelmaking). The country&#x27;s main electricity producer, Corpoelec, and the regional development office, CVG (Corporación Venezolana de Guayana), are also located in Puerto Ordaz.

===Port===
The port of Puerto Ordaz is a combination of piers (&quot;muelles&quot;), all under the control of CVG, of which only one is allocated for public use. The others are directly related to the CVG production companies; primarily all for aluminum-related endeavors, nine in-total. Two of the most frequently-used piers are Ferrominera (at the mouth of the Caroní river) and Ternium Sidor (recently nationalised into a CVG company, and the only steel works) at mile 197.

===Hydroelectricity===
The city hosts the headquarters of CVG Electrificación del Caroní (CVG Edelca), Venezuela&#x27;s main electricity producer, which manage several hydroelectric power plants along the Caroní river basin. Two of them, Macagua and Caruachi, are located within city limits. The easy of access to Macagua from the city center makes it a tourist and educational destination, and a public park and museum were added to the complex.

Edelca also builds and administers two more dams upstream from the city: Tocoma and Guri. The latter is currently (as of 2018) the fourth-biggest hydroelectric power station in the world in terms of generation capacity, and gave origin to the Guri reservoir, the second biggest lake in Venezuela.


==Transportation==

Puerto Ordaz is criss-crossed from north to south and east to west by numerous avenues. Some of them are:

*Guayana Avenue — the main thoroughfare of the city, it crosses the city from start to end. It begins at the toll on the Ciudad Bolívar-Ciudad Guayana Highway and goes all the way through Puerto Ordaz, including the industrial zones, airport, commercial zones, residential areas, and Parque Cachamay.
*Atlántico Avenue runs through Puerto Ordaz from west to east on the south side of the city. It intersects with Las Americas Avenue and Leopoldo Sucre Figarella Ave. This gives a high importance to this thoroughfare.
*Las Américas Avenue connects the Altavista sector (north of the city) with the city centre.
*Paseo Caroní Avenue starts on the west side of the city and ends at Atlántico Avenue.

On December 3, 2006, the Orinoquia Bridge, which crosses the Orinoco river, was inaugurated.

The area is served by Manuel Carlos Piar Guayana Airport.

==Recreation==

In Puerto Ordaz the principal recreation centers are:
*Natural: Llovizna park, Cachamay park, Loefling park.
*Shopping centers: Orinokia Mall, Altavista Mall, Atlántico Mall.
*Family: Macagua Eco Museum, Christmas Park and the Italian-Venezuelan Club.

Ciudad Guayana is home to two football clubs that play in the Venezuelan Primera División, namely LALA FC and Mineros de Guayana. Both clubs play their home games in the CTE Cachamay stadium, which also hosts games of the national team and numerous concerts.

==Notable people==

*Kervin Andrade (born 2005), Venezuelan footballer
*Eugenio Suárez (born 1991), Major League Baseball player
*Freddy Fermin (born 1995), Major League Baseball player

==Education==

Puerto Ordaz is also well known for having one of the best engineering schools in Latin America. The main universities are:

Regional hubs:
* Andrés Bello UCAB (Catholic University) 
* UDO (East University)
* Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho (UGMA) University
* Bicentenaria de Aragua (UBA) University

Puerto Ordaz is headquarters of colleges like:

* UNEXPO (National Experimental Polytechnic University)
* UNEG (National Experimental University of Guayana)

Technical Institutes
* U.E.E.T.I. Fundación &quot;La Salle&quot; (San Félix)
* I.U.T. Antonio José de Sucre 
* I.U.T. Pedro Emilio Coll
* I.U.P. Santiago Mariño

==Tourism==

Inside the city both the Llovizna and Cachamay Parks are located displaying their picturesque waterfalls. Other local attractions are the Caroní Ecomuseum located at the Macagua Dam. Near the city from the Angosturita bridge to the San Félix port the union of the Caroní and Orinoco rivers can be seen; the different colors of the water of both rivers make a very distinct demarcation line. Taking Puerto Ordaz as a starting point, the Orinoco Delta can be visited as well as Canaima&#x27;s National Park and Guri&#x27;s reservoirs. Other points of interest are the colonial castles at the Orinoco riverside and the &quot;Cerro del Elefante&quot; (Elephant&#x27;s hill) which can be reached in a 4x4 vehicle. The Castles of Guayana are located at the right side of the Orinoco River, about 35 kilometers from San Félix.

<text>Aglets is a Java-based mobile agent platform and library for building mobile agents based applications. They are able to autonomously and spontaneously move from one host to another in a computer network carrying a piece of code with it. It can be programmed to execute at a remote host and show different behaviours at different hosts. Java based security implementations take care of authorised access to local resources at the remote hosts. A development kit, IBM Aglets Workbench (AWB), provided the API and the platform to run aglets.

Aglets was originally developed by Mitsuru Oshima (&quot;&quot;) and Danny Lange at the IBM Tokyo Research Laboratory. IBM was responsible for most of the 1.x release. However the project is now hosted at SourceForge.net as an open source project, where it is distributed under the IBM Public License. In the beginning, the SourceForge releases had been only bug-fix ones, but 2.x series (most of which came from open source community only) had better security and thread management. It now includes a log4j based logging system and a few bug-fixes of the older versions.

<doc id="1191752" wikidata="Q7848086" url="?curid=1191752" title="Trust-preferred security">
<text>A trust-preferred security is a security possessing characteristics of both equity and debt. A company creates trust-preferred securities by creating a trust, 
issuing debt to it, and then having it issue preferred stock to investors. Trust-preferred securities are generally issued by bank holding companies. The preferred stock securities issued by the trust are what are referred to as trust-preferred securities.

The security is a hybrid security with characteristics of both subordinated debt and preferred stock in that it is generally very long term (30 years or more), allows early redemption by the issuer, makes periodic fixed or variable interest payments, and matures at face value. In addition, trust preferred securities issued by bank holding companies will usually allow the deferral of interest payments for up to 5 years.

The principal advantages of these hybrid characteristics are favorable tax, accounting, and credit treatment. Trust preferred securities have an additional advantage over other types of hybrid securities (such as similar types of debt issued directly to investors without the intervening trust), which is that if they are issued by a bank holding company, they will be treated as capital (equity/own funds) rather than as debt for regulatory purposes. This is why trust preferred securities are issued overwhelmingly by bank holding companies, even though any company can issue them. However, the Dodd-Frank Act changes this benefit.

==Structure==
The issuing company forms a Delaware trust (a Connecticut trust is also common) and holds 100% of the common stock of the trust. The trust then issues preferred stock to investors. All of the proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock are paid to the company. In exchange, the company issues junior subordinated debt to the trust with essentially the same terms as the trust&#x27;s preferred stock. All steps except the formation of the trust occur simultaneously. If the issuing company is a bank holding company, it will also usually guarantee the interest and maturity payments on the trust preferred stock.

==Advantages==
Trust preferred securities are used by bank holding companies for their favorable tax, accounting, and regulatory capital treatments. Specifically, the subordinated debt securities are taxed like debt obligations by the IRS, so interest payments are deductible. Dividends on preferred stock, by comparison, are paid out of after-tax income. The company may therefore enjoy a significantly lower cost of funding.

If issued by a bank holding company, they are treated as capital rather than liabilities under banking regulations, and may be treated as the highest quality capital (tier 1 capital) if they have certain characteristics. Since the amount of liabilities (such as deposits) that a banking institution may have is limited to some multiple of its capital, this regulatory treatment is highly favorable and is why the trust preferred structure is favored by bank holding companies.

To be eligible as Tier 1 capital, such instruments must provide for a minimum five-year consecutive deferral period on distributions to preferred shareholders. In addition, the intercompany loan must be subordinated to all subordinated debt and have the longest feasible maturity. The amount of these instruments, together with other cumulative preferred stock a bank holding company may include in Tier 1 capital, may constitute up to 25 percent of the sum of all core capital elements, including cumulative perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred stock. Non-financial companies are more likely to use less complex structures, such as issuing junior subordinated debt directly to the public.

==Disadvantages==
The principal disadvantages of trust preferred securities is cost. Because the trust preferred securities are subordinated to all of the issuer&#x27;s other debt and typically have features like early redemption and optional deferral of interest payments, investors demand high interest rates. These rates will be much higher than ordinary senior debt or subordinated debt. Offering costs are high as well. Investment banks will take a large underwriting fee to sell the securities to the public, and legal and accounting fees will also be high. They have also been blamed for the failure of a few banks during the recent financial crisis.

== Colin&#x27;s amendment ==
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act included a provision which would &quot;exclude trust-preferred securities from the regulatory capital of bank holding companies&quot;, although it has several exceptions intended to allow these holding companies to transition into compliance with the law, including an exception for bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009 and an exception for small bank holding companies under the Board of Governors’ Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement.

<text>Princess Gryzelda Konstancja Wiśniowiecka &quot;née&quot; Zamoyska of clan Jelita (27 April 1623 – 17 April 1672) was a Polish noblewoman, known as the mother of King Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki.

==Life==
She was the daughter of Tomasz Zamoyski, voivode of Podole and Chancellor and Princess Katarzyna Ostrogska. Gryzelda married Prince Jeremi Michał Wiśniowiecki h. Korybut on 27 February 1639 in Zamość and had one son, Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki, King of Poland. 

She became involved in a lengthy legal dispute with Marie Casimire Sobieska. She became involved in domestic politics after her son was elected to the throne, although over time her relationship with him soured. She contributed to her son&#x27;s marriage to Eleanor of Habsburg, attempting to strengthen his weak authority and striving for an agreement with his political opponents. She probably arranged the marriage of Dymitr Wiśniowiecki with Sobieski&#x27;s niece, but she failed to bring about a real agreement; over time, she began to lose influence over her son, who reportedly even avoided her company. She died in Zamość on April 17, 1672. According to the wish expressed in her will, she wanted to be buried in the Zamość church, but she was buried in St. John&#x27;s Cathedral in Warsaw.

<text>West Wickham is an area of South East London, England, in the London Borough of Bromley. It lies south of Park Langley, Eden Park, Beckenham and Bromley town centre, west of Hayes and north of Coney Hall, east of Spring Park and Shirley. It is south-east of Charing Cross on the line of a Roman road, the London to Lewes Way. Before the creation of Greater London in 1965, West Wickham was in Kent.

==History==

The Roman site near West Wickham, possibly an open-air market with slight long-term settlement, is probably the site of Noviomagus Cantiacorum.

West Wickham is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 with the following entry: &quot;In lordship 2 ploughs. 24 villagers have 4 ploughs. 13 slaves; a church; a mill at 20d.; a wood at 10 pigs. Value before 1066 8; later 6: now 13. Godric son of Karl held it from King Edward&quot;. The name dates to Anglo-Saxon and is possibly a corruption of the Latin &quot;vicus&quot;, denoting an earlier Roman settlement. The &#x27;West&#x27; was added in the 13th century to differentiate it from East Wickham, situated some distance away to the north-east.

In Tudor times, the manor house, Wickham Court, was expanded by the Boleyn family and the area was popular for deer hunting. The Grade I listed building was built by Sir Henry Heydon in 1469. His wife was Anne Boleyn (Bullen), a daughter of Sir Geoffrey Boleyn, who was Lord Mayor of London in 1469. She was the great-aunt of Queen Anne Boleyn, second wife of Henry VIII. The house was later sold to the Lennard family in 1580. In 1935, it was sold and adapted for use as an hotel. After World War II, it was sold to the Daughters of Mary and Joseph, an International Congregation of Religious Sisters, and became Coloma College (a teacher training college). This was run by the Daughters of Mary and Joseph until 1978. From 1978 to 1996 it was occupied by Schiller International University. It later became home to Wickham Court Preparatory School until 2023 and is now occupied by the St Mary and St John Coptic Orthodox &amp; Centre.

Until the 1900s West Wickham remained a small village. The inter-war period saw rapid development and the transformation of the area into a suburb of London, facilitated by the arrival of the railway station, which opened in 1882. Much of the formerly extensive West Wickham Common was built over, though a small tract was purchased and preserved by the Corporation of London in 1892. At the crossroads by the Swan pub formerly stood the Stocks Tree, a large elm tree so named as it lay behind the village stocks. It was damaged during the laying down of sewerage pipes in the 1930s and was moved to Blake Recreation Ground in 1935, but later blew down in a storm. The tree is commemorated in the village sign and a plaque, both of which stand outside the library, with a piece of the tree on display inside.

Modern-day West Wickham is an affluent suburb of Greater London, after the London Government Act 1963, which came into effect in 1965, with West Wickham absorbed into the London Borough of Bromley. The area is a fairly typical London suburb, consisting of predominantly 1930s housing, with a row of shops, restaurants and a library along the High Street and another set around the train station area. There are four pubs in the area - The Swan and the Wheatsheaf on the High Street, The Railway by the station and The Real Ale Way micropub, opened in 2021 in Station Road. There are also several parks, such as West Wickham playing fields (McAndrews), Wickham Park and Blakes Recreation ground.

==Education==
West Wickham (including Coney Hall as it is a district of West Wickham) has four state schools (all primary schools). They are Oak Lodge, Wickham Common, Pickhurst and Hawes Down. St David&#x27;s Prep and Wickham Court (serving as a nursery, primary school and secondary school) are private schools. In 2012, Wickham Common won a hockey gold medal when they represented Bromley in the London Youth Games.

There are no secondary schools in West Wickham, but there are some in neighbouring areas. Langley Park School for Boys and Langley Park School for Girls are located in Beckenham, Hayes School is located in Hayes, and Ravens Wood School is located in Keston.

All Saints&#x27; Catholic School was a secondary school located on Layhams Road, West Wickham, London Borough of Bromley which closed in 2007 a few years after a major fraud scandal.

==Transport==
===Rail===
West Wickham railway station TfL travel card zone 5, serves the area with services to London Charing Cross, and Hayes.

===Buses===
West Wickham is served by several Transport for London buses connecting it with areas including Beckenham, Bromley, Croydon, Hayes, Penge, Sydenham and Thornton Heath. Services include routes, 119 (which runs 24/7), 138, 194 and 352. While Superloop London Superloop SL5 will not stop in West Wickham it will stop near to the town&#x27;s boundary at both Westmoreland Road, BR2 and Bethlem Royal Hospital, BR3.

==Sport and leisure==

West Wickham has a non-League football club Glebe F.C. who play at Oakley Road.

West Wickham is home to Beccehamians RFC a rugby union club founded in 1933 which plays competitive rugby at Sparrows Den at the bottom of Corkscrew Hill.

Other clubs nearby include Croydon RFC (formerly Shirley Wanderers), a club that currently competes in Surrey 1, that has a rugby pitch used often for county matches.

West Wickham is well served by green spaces, including Spring Park and Sparrows Den, which are connected to Threepenny Woods. The London Loop walking trail and cycling track go through here. Kelsey Park in the Langley area of neighbouring Beckenham is also considered a local park, as is Addington Park.

== Arts and popular culture ==

Since 1958 the area has had an Arts association and since 1967 it has had its own community theatre known as &quot;Theatre 62&quot; / &quot;West Wickham Theatre centre&quot;.

On 1 August 1964, Blakes Recreation Ground hosted a concert featuring Manfred Mann (featuring Paul Jones), The Merseybeats and the Johnny Dankworth Orchestra.

The town appeared in the 2000 UK television series &quot;The 1940s House&quot;, with 17 Braemar Gardens taking the starring role as a family lived a World War II experience in a typical London suburb.

<text>The Invergowrie rail accident happened in Invergowrie, Scotland, on 22 October 1979. The accident killed five people and injured 51 others.

==Accident==
The 08:44 passenger service from Glasgow Queen Street to Dundee, despite running late and experiencing technical difficulties, left Invergowrie station without incident. However, the brake on the leading bogie of locomotive 25083 was binding, although the driver carried on as Dundee was only a few miles away. As the train was running along Invergowrie Bay a traction motor caught fire and the train (with five carriages) was stopped.

Approximately ten minutes later, the stationary train was run into at around by the seven-coach 09:35 express from Glasgow to Aberdeen hauled by locomotive 47208. The impact threw the last four coaches of the Dundee train over the sea wall. The last two broke away completely and ended up in the Firth of Tay while the tide was out. The Class 47 locomotive was subsequently scrapped due to damage. Both passengers in the rear carriage and the driver and secondman of the Aberdeen train were killed instantly. A further passenger died later and a total of 51 people were injured.

It was reported the next day that the dead included engine drivers Robert Duncan and William Hume. Robert Duncan was 60 years old, lived in Tayport and was a church elder and a special constable. He had a 19-year-old son. His widow stated that Driver Duncan had worked for British Rail since he was 16. William Hume was a trainee driver aged 20 and resided in Fintry, Dundee. He had only worked for British Rail for four months. Both were in the cab of the Glasgow to Aberdeen train. The other two immediate fatalities were passengers Dr James Preston, a community health officer aged 65, and Mr Kazimierz Jedrelejczyk, a Polish marine engineer. The fifth death was that of passenger Mrs May Morrison who died in hospital as a result of injuries she had sustained in the crash. Footballer Dougie Wilkie was among the seriously injured and was left paralysed from the waist.

==Investigation==
The signalman at Longforgan signal box stated that he put the mechanical starting signal correctly back to Danger behind the Dundee train. Around ten minutes later, the Aberdeen train arrived at his box and drew up to the Home signal, which was then cleared for it. The train continued to move slowly towards the Starting signal but, after a few moments, began to accelerate. It passed the Starting signal which, as far as the signalman could see, was still at Danger. He went down onto the track and saw that the arm of the Starting signal was slightly raised; about 4°. Subsequent investigations showed that it was possible for the arm to have been raised roughly 8°.

The guard of the Aberdeen train said that he had looked out of the window of the rear coach at Longforgan as the train picked up speed. He saw the starting signal giving &quot;a poor off&quot; (in other words, somewhere between the &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; positions), estimating that it was raised 7.4°, but assumed that it had already been put back to Danger after the locomotive had passed it and perhaps had not quite returned to the horizontal position. It is not clear if the guard could have seen the starting signal exactly as the driver would have seen it. The subsequent public inquiry found that the guard was not to blame.

Why the driver passed the signal remained a mystery. The inquiry speculated that he may have been looking back towards the signal box, or checking that the train was clear of the level crossing. As he then looked up towards the signal he might have concluded that it had moved since he had last seen it and that it had, therefore, been cleared by the signalman. From a position below the signal and fairly close to it, he may also have overestimated the angle of the arm.

Various operating staff who saw the signal before and after the accident also gave evidence that the arm was not properly horizontal, including some who said that the degree of elevation appeared to increase as they got closer to it. It was later found that the signal post bracket was badly bent. The bracket may have been struck by a chain hanging from a wagon, or perhaps by engineers&#x27; machinery working on the lineside.

In addition, the signalling at Longforgan was basic and lacking in many safety features. The Starting signal had no AWS that would have warned the driver of the Aberdeen train, nor was there an adjuster for the pull wire. There was also no repeater in the signal box, nor was a detonator placer provided.

<doc id="1191762" wikidata="Q1074129" url="?curid=1191762" title="Division of Griffith">
<text>The Division of Griffith is an electoral division for the Australian House of Representatives. The division covers the inner southern suburbs of Brisbane, Queensland. The current MP is Max Chandler-Mather of the Australian Greens.

==History==

The division is named after Sir Samuel Griffith, former politician and a principal author of the Constitution of Australia.

Griffith was created in 1934, replacing the seat of Oxley which had been established in 1900.

Historically, the seat has been highly marginal and has alternated between the Labor Party and Liberal Party. The 1939 Griffith by-election was nearly the sight of an upset, with the UAP/Country coalition government coming within five votes of taking the seat from the incumbent opposition Labor party. Apart from 1920, the rare feat of a Government winning a seat from the Opposition in a by-election would only be achieved in 2023 when Labor won the 2023 Aston by-election. 

Close contests ensued, with the seat being decided by just 118 votes in 1954, 21 votes in 1958, and 182 votes in 1972. In 1977, the seat was won by future Hawke-Keating government minister Ben Humphreys under whose nearly 20-year tenure the seat became much safer for Labor. However, on Humphreys&#x27; retirement and as Labor lost government in 1996, future Prime Minister Kevin Rudd failed to win the seat to the Liberal Party&#x27;s Graeme McDougall by 1.5%. Rudd would later emerge victorious in 1998, winning the seat with 52.4% of the two-candidate-preferred vote. Rudd steadily increased his margin at each successive election until 2010, reaching a peak of 62.3% of the vote in 2007 as he led Labor to government. Rudd suffered an under average two-party-preferred swing in 2010 having been deposed as Prime Minister two months earlier.

Rudd suffered a further swing against him in 2013 with the seat becoming marginal once more. He retired following the election and bequeathed a 3% margin to his successor Terri Butler who narrowly retained the seat at the ensuing 2014 Griffith by-election with a 1.8% margin, 1.6% in 2016, and 2.9% in 2019 – one of the few swings to Labor in Queensland. However, during Butler&#x27;s tenure, Labor&#x27;s primary vote saw itself become cannibalized to its left flank, with the Greens winning five booths on primary votes at the 2019 federal election with a further four booths in which the party came at a close second. The Greens also achieved their strongest favourable swing in 2019 within this seat (at 6.67%). Similarly in 2020, the Greens won the state seat of South Brisbane from Labor, which overlaps with part of the electorate. Subsequently Greens candidate Max Chandler-Mather winning the seat in the 2022 federal election, with 60.5% of the two-party preferred vote and 34.6% of the first preference vote, Labor being pushed into third place.

==Boundaries==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee administered by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

Griffith covers the inner southern Brisbane suburbs of Balmoral, Bulimba, Camp Hill, Carina Heights, Coorparoo, Dutton Park, East Brisbane, Greenslopes, Highgate Hill, Hawthorne, Kangaroo Point, Morningside, Norman Park, Seven Hills, South Brisbane, Stones Corner, West End and Woolloongabba, as well as parts of Annerley, Cannon Hill, Carina, Holland Park, Holland Park West, Mount Gravatt East, Murarrie, and Tarragindi.

<doc id="1191764" wikidata="Q6649646" url="?curid=1191764" title="Little Cottonwood Canyon">
<text>Little Cottonwood Canyon lies within the Wasatch-Cache National Forest along the eastern side of the Salt Lake Valley, roughly 15 miles from Salt Lake City, Utah. The canyon is part of Granite, a CDP and &quot;Community Council&quot; designated by Salt Lake County. The canyon is a glacial trough (U-shaped canyon), carved by an alpine glacier during the last ice age, 15,000 to 25,000 years ago. A number of rare and endemic plant species are found in the canyon&#x27;s Albion Basin. Introduced Mountain goats inhabit the surrounding mountains.

The Salt Lake Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was built of blocks of quartz monzonite, granite, and granodiorite which Latter Day Saint pioneers quarried from the Little Cottonwood Stock near the mouth of the canyon.

State Route 210 is the primary access road to the canyon, running from the canyon mouth up to Alta. Little Cottonwood Creek runs down the length of the canyon, beginning at Cecret Lake at Alta and flowing westward.

== Geology ==
The Little Cottonwood stock is a granitic intrusion that extends from the mouth of the canyon almost to Snowbird ski resort. It is Oligocene in age, roughly 30.5 to 29 million years old, composed primarily of granodiorite, quartz monzonite, and granite, with some mafic enclaves. The Little Cottonwood stock is intruded in its northeast corner by another unit called the White Pine intrusion, and other smaller igneous units, collectively about 27-26 million years old, which are the source of the inactive White Pine molybdenum ore deposit in White Pine fork.

The intrusion and its associated ore deposit have several interesting features, including quartz-bearing porphyry, pebble dikes, and other features related to hydrothermal ore deposit processes, and possibly volcanism, that occurred during intrusion.

The intrusion is also the footwall of the East Traverse Mountain Mega-Landslide, and its presence is probably a second-order control on the cause of the landslide, in addition to the elevation gradient caused by the nearby Wasatch Fault.

== Hydrology ==
The Little Cottonwood Canyon watershed provides drinking water to much of Salt Lake County. The National Forest Service considers Little Cottonwood Canyon a protected watershed area. In order to prevent contamination of the watershed by fecal runoff, no dogs (except service animals and avalanche search dogs) are permitted in the canyon.

== Recreational activities ==
Recreational activities in Little Cottonwood Canyon include hiking, camping, fishing, mountain biking, rock climbing, Bouldering, skiing, snowboarding, and backcountry use. There are two resorts in the canyon, Alta and Snowbird, providing both summer and winter recreational opportunities. The Utah Native Plant Society often conducts wildflower walks at Albion Basin and in other locations in the canyon. The road is approximately 8.3 miles from the base of the canyon to the top with an average grade of 9.2%, making it a popular road cycling challenge.

=== Skiing and snowboarding ===

Little Cottonwood Canyon is home to two ski areas, Snowbird and Alta. Both areas are well known for the amount of snow they receive each year with Alta averaging around 550 inches per year. The canyon is also well known for its backcountry skiing access, with over 300 named backcountry runs including one of the most prominent peaks in the canyon, Mount Superior.

=== Rock climbing ===
The lower third of the canyon is strewn with quartz monzonite, granite, and granodiorite outcroppings, mostly consisting of smooth steep faces, some up to several hundred feet high. Local climbers informally refer to the rock as granite, which is a close relative to quartz monzonite.

The earliest recorded climbing activity dates from the 1930s, when Harold Goodro put up some routes before shifting to predominantly climbing on the quartzite of Big Cottonwood Canyon and elsewhere. Many of the major routes in Little Cottonwood were established in the early 1960s by the Alpenbock Club, some in conjunction with well-known visitors including Fred Beckey, Layton Kor, and Royal Robbins. The Lowes – George Lowe, Greg Lowe, and Jeff Lowe – came to prominence through the rest of the 1960s and early 1970s. More recent climbers have pushed the standards to the highest levels, establishing several 5.13 routes.

Access can be a problem. On the north side, the &quot;Church Buttress&quot; above the Granite Mountain Records Vault, and the Black Peeler Buttress, are on private land and not legally accessible, as are parts of the south side. This still leaves some 20-odd named buttresses and gullies available for climbing, mostly on the north side. Approaches involve parking alongside the road and hiking a short distance up through scrub oak, sometimes scrambling through fields of enormous boulders.

Face climbing is the predominant technique, typically using bolts and cracks for protection, but there are many notable crack climbs as well. Most routes are 2-4 pitches in length, with walkoffs involving still more scrub oak.

The highest-quality face routes are to be found on The Fin, an almost-featureless expanse high above the canyon. Its route The Dorsal Fin (5.10d) is a classic of the Wasatch; first ascended by George Lowe and Mark McQuarrie in 1965, the bolts of this four-pitch were all drilled on the lead.

The canyon also includes Gate Buttress, whose 80+ routes include the aptly named Schoolroom (5.6), a five-pitch route requiring a wide variety of techniques, along with routes ranging up to 5.12a in difficulty. Below the buttress and near the road is the Gate Boulder, a popular gathering spot shaded by large trees.

The Pfeifferhorn is one of the highest peaks to climb in the Wasatch. The peak is usually climbed from the Red Pine Lake area, a ten-mile roundtrip climb that gains 3,700 feet. The peak was named after Chuck Pfeiffer, a Wasatch Club leader from long ago.

With 529 climbs currently established, Little Cottonwood Canyon has the second most bouldering routes in Utah. These routes vary in difficulty, from V0 to V16. Some of the most commonly climbed areas throughout the canyon include Secret Garden, 5 Mile, and White Pine.

== Gondola Controversy ==
On August 31, 2022, the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) announced &quot;Gondola Alternative B&quot;, a plan to build a Gondola transit system connecting the base of Little Cottonwood Canyon with Alta and Snowbird ski areas. A coalition of environmental groups opposed to the gondola have filed lawsuits against UDOT to block the gondola, claiming UDOT exceeded its authority and violated the National Environmental Policy Act .

<text>Claudia María Poll Ahrens (born 21 December 1972) is a Costa Rican-Nicaraguan former swimmer who competed in the 200 m to 800 m freestyle events. She is Costa Rica&#x27;s only Olympic gold-medalist, having won the country&#x27;s first Olympic gold medals at the 1996 Olympics in the 200 meter freestyle. Claudia also competed at the 2000 Olympics, where she won two bronze medals. She is a multiple national record holder in the freestyle events.

She is the first person from Central America to win an Olympic gold medal. She was the only to do so until the 2008 Olympic Games when long jump athlete Irving Saladino of Panama won a gold medal.

==Career==
Claudia Poll began swimming in 1979 under coach Francisco Rivas and quickly became one of the best in Central America, winning many regional titles.

At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics she won the gold medal in the 200 m freestyle event. The win was the first gold medal for Costa Rica in the Summer Olympic Games. It was a surprising win because she beat the favorite German Franziska van Almsick. Dagmar Hase from Germany won the bronze.

In 1997, she was named by &quot;Swimming World Magazine&quot; as the Female Swimmer of the Year.

At the Sydney 2000, Poll continued with her medal run and won two bronze medals. In Athens 2004, she just missed out on the 400 m freestyle final, finishing ninth in the heats.

In 2002, she was given a four-year doping ban after a failed test for norandrosterone, a metabolite the steroid nandrolone. Her ban was later reduced by FINA (International Swimming Federation) to two years. Poll claimed that the test and sampling methods were flawed and protested her innocence.

At the 2006 Central American and Caribbean Games, she set the Games Records in the 200 and 400 freestyles (2:00.19 and 4:15.01), bettering the time her sister Silvia set at the 1986 Central American and Caribbean Games.

Poll served as a swimming analyst for the U.S. Telemundo network&#x27;s Spanish-language coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, though she and most of the Telemundo broadcast crew performed their duties at the network&#x27;s studios in Hialeah, Florida, accompanied by video provided by Olympic Broadcasting Services.

==Personal life==

Claudia’s parents are both German, but they moved to Nicaragua before starting a family. Claudia and her sister Silvia were both born in Managua, Nicaragua, but moved shortly after Claudia’s birth in 1972. The family had decided that rising political tensions and the 1972 Nicaragua earthquake meant it would be safer to live in Costa Rica. Claudia is not related to Marlene Ahrens, another Olympic athlete and medalist and another Latin American of German descent.

Claudia graduated in Business Administration from the Universidad Internacional de las Américas, San José, Costa Rica, in 1998. She had her first child, a daughter named Cecilia, on August 8, 2007. Claudia&#x27;s older sister, Silvia Poll, won Costa Rica&#x27;s first Olympic medal, a silver medal, at the 1988 Games. As of 2021, Claudia and Silvia are the only Costa Ricans to have won a medal at an Olympics. 

== Honors ==
*Declared &quot;Honor Citizen&quot; by the Costa Rican Congress in 1996 ;
*Costa Rican Sportswoman of the Year in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000;

<doc id="1191771" wikidata="Q7440692" url="?curid=1191771" title="Seaman (video game)">
<text>is a virtual pet video game developed and published by Vivarium for the Dreamcast. It was originally released in Japan in 1999, with a North American release by Sega in 2000. It is one of the few Dreamcast games to take advantage of the microphone attachment. The game developed a cult following for its dark humor, bizarre aesthetics, and innovative gameplay.

&quot;Seaman&quot; was released multiple times, including a limited edition demo version titled &quot;Christmas Seaman&quot; that was released in Japan in 1999, alongside a limited edition red Dreamcast and a PlayStation 2 version in 2001, titled &quot;Seaman: Kindan no Pet - Gaze Hakushi no Jikken Shima,&quot; the first edition of which came with a microphone. 

A sequel called &quot;Seaman 2&quot; was released in Japan for the PlayStation 2 in 2007. Additionally, a PC spin-off called &quot;SeaMail&quot; was released for Microsoft Windows, with the Seaman being able to interact with the user&#x27;s applications from the desktop. 

A version of &quot;Seaman&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS was also planned, however it was cancelled during development.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Seaman&quot; is considered a unique video game because it contains limited action. The player&#x27;s goal is to feed and care for the Seaman while providing him with the company that he needs. The mechanic operates in real time, so the player is required to check on the Seaman every real-time day or he could die. A portion of the Seaman&#x27;s knowledge is random trivia. When he asks what the player&#x27;s birthday is (and the player responds via the microphone input), the Seaman will share significant events that happened on that date.

Although the Seaman becomes fairly domesticated, it does not stop insulting the player or making less-than-friendly remarks.

At the beginning of the game, the player is provided with an unhatched Seaman egg and develops and interacts with it through various stages of development. Through various buttons on the Dreamcast controller, the player controls all the machinery and physical contact with the mysterious creature. The player is also provided with multiple Seamen for breeding and interaction purposes. Over the course of the game, the player is required to evolve their Seaman to different stages in its life cycle, eventually transforming into a frog-like creature outlined on the disc&#x27;s cover.

The Seaman begins its first days of life as a &quot;Mushroomer&quot;, a form which consists of a well-developed optic organ and a flagellum. The Seaman lacks a face and any verbal means of communication. As a Mushroomer, the Seaman is essentially a parasite. After being eaten by a nautilus, it overruns its predator and consumes it from the inside out. Mushroomers tend to stick to one side of the tank by the ends of their flagellum if left alone. In this stage, the player&#x27;s interaction is somewhat minimal and plays similar to a tutorial, allowing the player to learn to control the heat in the fish tank, direct the Mushroomers, and clean out any filthy water that has accumulated over time.

After emerging from the deceased body of the nautilus, the organism enters a stage called the &quot;Gillman&quot;, which resembles a cyprinid fish with a human face and a tentacle-like tube atop its forehead. During this stage, the Seaman becomes capable of speech but can only communicate in gibberish by reiterating comments made through microphone input. At this point, the player will begin the communication process and continue maintaining the aquarium as the Gillman grows larger, developing scales and a larger vocabulary. As the Gillmen mature, they develop scales and more advanced speaking abilities, but they will soon kill one another until only two remain. Their genders are indeterminate until they mature to the point of being able to be named. Once one is named, it will change its color and sex.

In its next stage, the Podfish, the Seaman is still fish-like in appearance and is similar to the Gillman but has gained frog-like legs. After mating, the male Podfish dies. The aquarium is also transformed into a terrarium: most of the water is gone, there is new land, and new breathable oxygen. The female then lays its eggs on the shore. Shortly after depositing the eggs, the female also dies, leaving the player a new generation of Seamen in a new evolutionary stage.

Instead of the introduction of hatching as Mushroomers like the first generation, the player began the game with a new form, the Tadman. They superficially resemble the baby Gillman but instead of a fish-like appearance, they resemble tadpoles. In addition, they still retain the same deep voice that their parents had. As they age, their bodies grow larger and small limbs begin to form. The Tadman eats their fellow siblings until their number is reduced to two. When this happens, the siblings will climb ashore and walk on land, ushering them into their next evolutionary stage.

The Frogman is the Seaman&#x27;s final stage of its maturity process. It is an amphibious creature resembling a frog and like the Gillman, it has a human face and a tentacle-like tube atop its forehead. Now able to co-exist between the habitats of water and dry land, the Frogman is now capable of powerful leaps and the consumption of insectoid organisms; however, like the real-world frog, the creature still requires the moisture of water to stay alive. The player is provided with a sprinkler system to remedy this. It is also at this stage where the player releases the seaman into the wild. While anything concerning metamorphosis and reproduction is left to speculation while the Frogmen are in the wild, it can be assumed the Seaman will eventually lay Mushroomer eggs and start the cycle over. This is similar to the reproductive cycle of real-world fungi, which the name Mushroomer may allude to.

==Story and setting==

As a new pet owner, the player is given the responsibility of caring for and learning about the enigmatic &quot;Seaman&quot; species using a replica of the discoverer&#x27;s laboratory. The player must figure everything out by themselves, such as appropriate care, with some guidance from the narrator, Leonard Nimoy.

The game&#x27;s manual goes into further detail about the backstory of the seaman species. The manual on page 3 &amp; 11 says to visit the website &quot;www.meetseaman.com&quot; for more information, between 2000 and 2004, it redirected to Yoot.com which expanded on the story in the manual.

During the 1930s, Dr. Jean-Paul Gassé was a member of a special team of French biologists sent to Egypt by the French government. During that time, Dr. Gassé was determined to research a creature that was an &quot;omnipotent messenger of the gods&quot; among the ruins of the Third Dynasty. In March 1932, in the city of Alexandria, Dr. Gassé met a local resident, who, while fishing, caught a Seaman. Dr. Gassé obtained a sample of some of the Seaman eggs, and went back to France with the egg samples in his possession.

When Dr. Gassé returned to France, he attempted to raise the eggs, but the Seamen died in his care. Shortly after this, he published a thesis of his work. His hypothesis suggested that the Seaman was responsible for transferring knowledge that increased during the Third Dynasty across oceans and other lands. Leading academics, however, dismissed him and his work as a PR stunt, leveraging the complaint against him that he lacked the proper evidence to support these outlandish findings. As a result, the work was ignored, and no one believed him. Despite its controversy, his theory became the basis for &quot;anthro-bio-archaeology&quot;, a highly valued field of study.

Shortly after publishing his thesis, Dr. Gassé was fired from his post. After his dismissal, news of Gassé&#x27;s whereabouts and activities were unknown, and details during those times were sketchy. Rumors began circulating that Dr. Gassé&#x27;s trail traced to some remote islands in Southeast Asia. It is known, however, that he escaped the horrors of World War II and met up with his Japanese colleague, Kimo Masuda. It became clear that sometime during these years they were able to conduct further research on the Seaman&#x27;s evolution, quite possibly even up to the creature walking on all fours. Unfortunately, there was very little hard data or evidence that substantiated these findings.

In March 1996, the French government established the Anthro-Bio-Archeological Research Institute (ABARI), headquartered in Paris. The institute is based on the work of Dr. Gassé, and most of the modern day research of the Seaman specimens has taken place there. In 1997, the ABARI announced there was a strong possibility that these Seaman species were closely related to the origins of ancient civilizations in Egypt. On October 6, 1998, one of Gassé&#x27;s formaldehyde specimens is discovered at the University of Paris.

On February 15, 1999, parts of Gassé&#x27;s journal and note entries were found in the Masuda family storehouse in the city of Matsusaka in Mie Prefecture, Japan. Professor Kendare Takahashi, who was directing the Japanese branch of the ABARI, successfully managed to breed Seaman eggs in captivity in July the same year. Soon after, Seamen were presented in aquariums across Japan. In July 2000, an expedition team embarked for Egypt in the first major research of Seamen in the wild.

==Development and release==
&quot;Seaman&quot; is one of the few Dreamcast games to take advantage of the microphone attachment. The narration is voiced by Toshiyuki Hosokawa in the original Japanese-language version and by Leonard Nimoy in the English-language version. The face of the Seaman creature is modeled after the game&#x27;s producer, Yoot Saito. In the Japanese version, Saito himself provides the voice of the Seaman, while the baby Seaman&#x27;s voice is provided by his daughter, and the young Seaman&#x27;s voice by the daughter of one of the programmers. During development, Sega had requested that a celebrity be used if possible, but Saito was hesitant, but later said that the fact that he played the role himself was &quot;the key to success&quot; because it gave him the advantage of being able to rerecord lines as many times as he wanted, so it was no longer a question of money.

&quot;Seaman&quot; was developed by Vivarium. It was conceived and designed by Saito, who originally came up with the concept of a joke when one of his coworkers was creating a tropical fish simulator. When Saito told his wife of the concept, she supported the idea despite considering it gross and strange. Saito also shared the concept with Shigeru Miyamoto who also liked the concept and was credited as someone important to the development of the game. &quot;Seaman&quot; was intended to be developed for the Nintendo 64DD, but was instead made for the Dreamcast. The decision to develop the game for the Dreamcast was made when he was introduced to the vice president of Sega, Shoichiro Irimajiri, who thought it could make the console a market leader. The prototype was initially developed on a Macintosh computer, with a year-and-a-half spent on converting it into a Dreamcast game. Near completion of the game, test players attempted to use long sentences to play the game. This caused the Seaman creature to say &quot;Can you say that again?&quot; repeatedly. To fix the issue, Yoot Saito changed the phrasing to say, &quot;You talk too long, I don&#x27;t understand&quot; in order to inform players they need to use shorter and simpler sentences to interact with the Seaman creature.

Localization was handled by Sega of America and spent a total of nine months, where multiple changes to comments were made regarding sex, politics, and slang based on cultural differences. In the Japanese version, the in-game Seaman creature would make comments based on the player&#x27;s content saved on their memory card but this feature was removed in the English version due to privacy concerns. The creature&#x27;s personality was different from the English version being more casual and negative.

A limited-edition demo version titled &quot;Christmas Seaman&quot; was released in Japan on December 16, 1999, and available for only ten days either through the Sega Direct online store or as part of an exclusive red Dreamcast pack-in. The title came with two discs, one for sending messages and one for receiving messages, allowing players to connect to the online servers and exchange Christmas wishes and messages, while a Santa themed Seaman shares some of his trademark &quot;Seaman wisdom&quot;.

In 2001, &quot;Seaman&quot; was re-released in Japan for the PlayStation 2 as , the first edition of which came with a microphone. A PC version for Microsoft Windows was planned, with the Seaman being able to interact with the user&#x27;s applications. No release date was specified, and it was later cancelled.

==Reception==
As of February 1, 2004, the Dreamcast version of &quot;Seaman&quot; sold 399,342 copies in Japan, making it the third best-selling Dreamcast game in the region at the time. The PlayStation 2 version of the game sold 305,632 in Japan as of November 2, 2008. It received an Excellence Award for Interactive Art at the 1999 Japan Media Arts Festival and received the Original Game Character of the Year award at GDC 2002. In 2008, &quot;Game Informer&quot; named the game one of the top ten weirdest games of all time.

Greg Orlando reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, praising the game and stating, &quot;the gentle art of conversation meets &quot;Resident Evil&quot; – and the Dreamcast gets its most bizarre title ever&quot;.

The Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Seaman&quot; for the &quot;Console Innovation&quot; award during the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

<text>The 5th Royal Irish Lancers was a cavalry regiment of the British Army. It saw service for three centuries, including the First World War. It amalgamated with the 16th The Queen&#x27;s Lancers to become the 16th/5th Lancers in 1922.

==History==
===Early wars===

The regiment was originally formed in 1689 by Brigadier James Wynne as James Wynne&#x27;s Regiment of Dragoons. It fought at the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690 and at the Battle of Aughrim later that month under King William III. Renamed the Royal Dragoons of Ireland in 1704, it went on to fight under the Duke of Marlborough at the Battle of Blenheim in August 1704 during the War of the Spanish Succession. At the Battle of Ramillies in May 1706 the regiment helped capture the entire French &quot;Regiment du Roi&quot;, after which it fought at the Battle of Oudenarde in July 1708 and at the Battle of Malplaquet in September 1709.
In 1751, it was retitled 5th Regiment of Dragoons and in 1756 it became the 5th (or Royal Irish) Regiment of Dragoons. As such, it served in Ireland and had the honour of leading the charge against the rebels at the Battle of Enniscorthy in May 1798 during the Irish Rebellion of 1798. However, its troops were accused of treachery: their accusers claimed their ranks had been infiltrated by rebels. Following an investigation, it was found that a single individual, James M&#x27;Nassar, had infiltrated the regiment: he was ordered to be &quot;transported beyond the seas&quot;. According to &quot;Continental Magazine&quot;:

The circumstance was commemorated in a curious way. It was ordered that the 5th Royal Irish Light Dragoons should be erased from the records of the army list, in which a blank between the 4th and 6th Dragoons should remain forever, as a memorial of disgrace. For upward of half a century this gap remained in the army list, as anybody may see by referring to any number of that publication of half-a-dozen years back.

The regiment was reformed in 1858, keeping its old number and title, but losing precedence, being ranked after the 17th Lancers. It was immediately converted into a lancer regiment and titled 5th (or Royal Irish) Regiment of Dragoons (Lancers). In 1861, it was renamed the 5th (or Royal Irish) Lancers and then the 5th (Royal Irish) Lancers. The regiment served in India between November 1863 and December 1874 and a contingent joined the Nile Expedition in autumn 1884. It then fought against the forces of Osman Digna near Suakin in 1885 during the Mahdist War. The regiment again left for India in November 1888, serving there for ten years until they were posted to South Africa in February 1898. They were stationed at Ladysmith until October 1898, when they went to Pietermaritzburg, where they remained until the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899.

===Second Boer War===

As one of two cavalry regiments stationed in South Africa on the outbreak of war, the regiment consequently took part in the early fighting. They fought at the Battle of Elandslaagte on 21 October 1899, at the Battle of Rietfontein on 24 October 1899, and was part of the besieged garrison of Ladysmith during the Siege of Ladysmith November 1899 to February 1900. After the relief of that town, they were re-horsed, and formed part of General Sir Redvers Buller′s army, taking part in all his actions until his Natal army joined with the main army at Belfast. They accompanied Buller in his advance into the Lydenburg district, and then, under General John Brocklehurst, made the forced march through the Dulstroom Valley to join General Ian Hamilton. Later they formed part of General Smith-Dorrien′s flying column. In January 1901, still under General Smith-Dorrien, they covered the left of General Sir John French′s big movement down to the Swaziland border. They then served under General Sir Bindon Blood, and operated in the Carolina district until July 1901, when they travelled by rail to Cape Colony. Here they formed part of Colonel Hunter-Weston′s mobile column. The regiment thus stayed in South Africa throughout the hostilities, which ended with the Peace of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902. Following the end of the war, 340 officers and men of the regiment left South Africa on the SS &quot;City of Vienna&quot;, which arrived at Southampton in October 1902.

The regiment, as part of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, was also involved in the Curragh incident in March 1914.

===First World War===

The regiment then returned to England, where it stayed until the outbreak of World War I, when it became part of the British Expeditionary Force, sailing from Dublin to France as part of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade in the 2nd Cavalry Division in August 1914 for service on the Western Front. It saw action during the Battle of Mons in August 1914. During the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917 George William Burdett Clare received the Victoria Cross posthumously. The 5th (Royal Irish) Lancers also has the grim honour of being the regiment of the last British soldier to die in the Great War. This was Private George Edwin Ellison from Leeds, who was killed by a sniper as the regiment advanced into Mons a short time before the armistice came into effect.

The regiment was renamed 5th Royal Irish Lancers and disbanded in 1921, but a squadron was reconstituted in 1922 and immediately amalgamated with the 16th The Queen&#x27;s Lancers to become the 16th/5th Lancers.

<doc id="1191776" wikidata="Q5033399" url="?curid=1191776" title="Canons Ashby House">
<text>Canons Ashby House (previously known as Canons Ashby Hall) is a Grade I listed Elizabethan manor house located in the village of Canons Ashby, about south of the town of Daventry in the county of Northamptonshire, England. It has been owned by the National Trust since 1981 when the house was close to collapse and the gardens had turned into a meadow. &quot;The Tower&quot; of the building is in the care of the Landmark Trust and available for holiday lets.

==Design==
The interior of Canons Ashby House is noted for its Elizabethan wall paintings and its Jacobean plasterwork. It has remained essentially unchanged since 1710 and is presented as it was during the time of Sir Henry Edward Leigh Dryden (1818–1899), a Victorian antiquary with an interest in history.

The house sits in the midst of a formal garden with colourful herbaceous borders, an orchard featuring varieties of fruit trees from the 16th century, terraces, walls and gate piers from 1710. There is also the remains of a medieval priory church (from which the house gets its name).

==History==
The house was the home of the Dryden family since its construction in the 16th century; the manor house was built in approximately 1550 with additions in the 1590s, in the 1630s and 1710.

One John Dryden had married Elizabeth Cope, daughter of Sir John Cope, in 1551 and inherited, through his wife, an L-shaped farmhouse which he gradually extended. John Dryden and Elizabeth Cope had a daughter, Bridget Dryden (1563-1645), born at Canons Ashby. She became the second wife of cleric and teacher Francis Marbury; their daughter Anne Hutchinson (1591-1643) emigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1634. Anne&#x27;s strong religious convictions were at odds with the established Puritan clergy in the Boston area, and her popularity and charisma helped create a theological schism that threatened to destroy the Puritans&#x27; religious community in New England. She was eventually tried and convicted, then banished from the colony with many of her supporters. To 19th century America, she was a crusader for religious liberty; in the 20th century, she became viewed as a feminist leader for her staunch defence of individual freedom of thought. Today, a statue of Anne Hutchinson stands in front of the State House in Boston, Massachusetts.

In the 1590s John&#x27;s son, Sir Erasmus Dryden, 1st Baronet completed the final north range of the house which enclosed the Pebble Courtyard. He also acquired a baronetcy and added several decorative elements to the interior, including the chimneypiece in the drawing room and the murals in Spenser&#x27;s room. His son Sir John Dryden, 2nd Baronet inherited in turn, and further decorated the drawing room with an elaborate plasterwork ceiling. A later descendent, Edward Dryden (son of the 6th baronet) turned his attention to the garden, creating a formal baroque garden across a series of terraces. 

Sir Henry Edward Leigh Dryden inherited the house upon his father&#x27;s death in 1837, and his efforts focused on the creation of the book room, which held the archives of the house as well as the county of Northamptonshire. His daughter, the historian and photographer Alice Dryden (1866–1956) was born in the house and lived there for 33 years, capturing a valuable visual record of the property. She moved away after her father died, since a woman could not inherit the estate and it went to her uncle, Sir Alfred Erasmus Dryden (1821–1912).

During World War II, the London offices of 20th Century Fox films were evacuated to Canons Ashby House; the evacuee staff lived in the nearby village of Moreton Pinkney. After the war, the family moved to Rhodesia and leased the house to a succession of tenants.

Louis Osman (1914–1996), an architect and accomplished British goldsmith lived at Canons Ashby from 1969/70 to 1979. Whilst there, Osman made the crown, with his enamellist wife, Dilys Roberts, which was used at the investiture of Charles, Prince of Wales in 1969. They also made the gold enamelled casket that held the Magna Carta which was on view in the United States Capitol, Washington, DC in 1976 for the United States Bicentennial.

Gervase Jackson-Stops, who was the Architectural Adviser to the National Trust for over twenty years, broke fresh ground when he fought for the rescue of the then decaying manor-house in the 1980s. This was the first time that the Trust used its charitable funds rather than the traditional family endowment to save a historic house.

==Interior==
===Great Hall===

This room was part of the original 1550s house build by John Dryden, then expanded in the 17th century. In the early 18th century, Edward Dryden restyled the room in medieval fashion with armour and heraldry, along with a martial overmantel painting by Elizabeth Creed, a cousin of the family. Creed also painted a dummy board of a Scots Guardsman which can be seen in the room. The room also contains a large green textile panel with the arms of William and Mary, which was associated with the Board of Green Cloth.

===Dining room===
This room was redecorated by Edward Dryden in 1710, who added sash windows and oak panelling. A series of family portraits line the walls, including the poet laureate John Dryden by Godfrey Kneller and Elizabeth Cornwallis (Edward&#x27;s mother-in-law) as Diana by John Michael Wright. The bespoke walnut-framed mirror that hangs over the fireplace was installed at the same time as the panelling.

===Book room===

Sir Erasmus Dryden expanded the house in the 1590s, adding this room with its paneling and a chimneypiece with Doric columns. The overmantel panels refer to the marriage of Sir John Cope and Margaret Thame, possibly originating from the original Cope family home, Copes Ashby. Sir Henry Dryden (known as &quot;the antiquarian&quot;) restyled this room in the mid 19th century as a place to read books, rather than as a library from which books are borrowed. Much original collection, which included a First Folio of Shakespeare, was sold at auction during the 20th century, however the National Trust has since reacquired many books associated with the house. A a pastel self-portrait by Elizabeth Creed also hangs in this room. Creed also decorated the adjacent withdrawing room known as the Painted Parlour.

===Drawing room===
Part of the original Elizabethan house, the rich decoration of this room illustrates several campaigns of embellishment. The huge fireplace and overmantel were installed in the 1590s and painted to resemble marble. Sir John added the domed ceiling and the coat of arms above the chimneypiece upon inheriting in the 1630s. The panels installed above the mantel were added in 1710 by Edward Dryden illustrating the family arms. A series of watercolours by Clara Dryden, sister of Arthur (6th Bt.), portray scenes from Canons Ashby in the 1890s.

===Spenser&#x27;s Room===

This bedroom was named for the poet Edward Spenser, Sir Erasmus&#x27; cousin by marriage, who allegedly wrote part of &quot;The Faerie Queen&quot; during a visit. During the restoration of the house in the 20th century, a series of rare Elizabethan grisaille murals were discovered behind 18th century panelling. The well-preserved images represent the story of Jeroboam from the biblical Book of Kings, warning of the perils of venerating false gods.

===Tapestry Room===
The room originates from the 1560s, but was modified several times during its history. The Flemish tapestries which hang around the room date from the 17th century. The bed was created in the 19th century by Sir Henry and incorporates Jacobean carving. The room also features an early 18th century embroidered settee, produced for Edward Dryden by Thomas Phill; sold by the family between the wars, it was reacquired by the National Trust in 1983 through the support of an anonymous benefactor.

===Servants&#x27; hall===
Created in the 1580s, this room served as a private family dining room, separate from the more-formal dining space of the Great Hall. When Edward Dryden created his new dining room in 1710, this room was repurposed as a dining space for servants. Most notable are the painted panels in the room, added in the 1590s by Sir Erasmus, depicting coats of arms as well as a series of moral inscriptions in Latin. The crests represent a range of family connections as well as prominent nearby families.

<doc id="1191780" wikidata="Q7739539" url="?curid=1191780" title="The Hidden Curriculum">
<text>The Hidden Curriculum (1970) is a book by the psychiatrist Benson R. Snyder (March 29, 1923, in Glen Ridge, N.J. – September 4, 2012, in Cambridge, Mass.), the then-Dean of Institute Relations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Snyder advances a thesis that much of campus conflict and students&#x27; personal anxiety is caused by unstated academic and social norms. These hidden norms affect the ability to develop independently or think creatively, and form what Snyder calls the hidden curriculum. He illustrates his thesis with psychological studies and other research conducted at MIT and Wellesley College.

==Summary==
The phrase &quot;hidden curriculum&quot; was coined by Philip W. Jackson in his 1968 book entitled &quot;Life in Classrooms&quot;, in a section about the need for students to master the institutional expectations of school. Snyder develops this with observations of particular institutions. Snyder then addresses the question of why students — even or especially the most gifted — turn away from education. Even honest efforts to enrich curricula frequently fail, says Snyder, thanks to the importance of the tacit and unwritten understanding. He says, that while some students do not realize there is a disjunction between the two curricula, in a demanding environment, students develop strategies to cope with the requirements they face.

Many students find they can not possibly complete all the work assigned them; they learn to neglect some of it. Some student groups maintain files of past examinations, which only worsen this situation.

The difference between the formal and real requirements produced considerable dissonance among the students and resulted in cynicism, scorn, and hypocrisy among students, and particular difficulty for minority students. No part of the university community, writes Snyder, neither the professors, the administration nor the students, desires the end result created by this process.

The &quot;Saturday Review&quot; said the book &quot;will gain recognition as one of the more cogent &#x27;college unrest&#x27; books&quot; and that it presents a &quot;most provocative thesis.&quot;

The book has been cited many times in studies.

<text>The Division of Groom is an Australian Electoral Division in Queensland.

Groom is an agricultural electorate located on the Darling Downs in southern Queensland. It includes the regional city of Toowoomba and rural communities to the west and south.

The current MP is Garth Hamilton, a member of the Liberal Party.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

The division was created in 1984 as essentially a reconfigured version of the old Division of Darling Downs, which had existed since Federation. It is named in honour of Sir Littleton Groom, who represented Darling Downs with only one short break from 1901 to 1936 and served as Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives.

It is located in the rural areas west of Brisbane and is centred on the city of Toowoomba, Australia&#x27;s second largest inland city. Other centres include Oakey and Pittsworth.

Groom&#x27;s electors have historically been socially conservative. In 2017, it was one of only three electorates in Queensland to vote against the Marriage Survey. However, sentiment is shifting. The 2022 federal election showed a strong increase in votes for independent candidates, with the two-candidate preferred result indicating local independent candidate, Suzie Holt, securing 41.33% of the vote, following distribution of preferences. Issues such as the cost of living and housing affordability are current priorities among voters. The local Liberal MP, Garth Hamilton, has consistenly voted against housing affordability. Mr Hamilton voted against the Housing Australia Future Fund Bill 2023, the Build to Rent program 2024, and the Help to Buy Bill 2023. Mr Hamilton has also voted against increasing funding for university education, which has negatively impacted the local University of Southern Queensland, and its students. Mr Hamilton also voted against making TAFE education fee-free, negatively impacting education, trades, and skill development in the Toowoomba region. https://theyvoteforyou.org.au/people/representatives/groom/garth_hamilton

<doc id="1191796" wikidata="Q261286" url="?curid=1191796" title="African finfoot">
<text>The African finfoot (Podica senegalensis) is an aquatic bird from the family Heliornithidae (the finfoots and sungrebe). The species lives in the rivers and lakes of western, central, and southern Africa.

==Description==
The African finfoot is an underwater specialist with a long neck, a striking sharp beak, and bright red, lobed feet. The plumage varies by race, generally pale underneath and darker on top. The males are usually darker than the females. It superficially resembles South America&#x27;s torrent duck.

==Habits and range==

The African finfoot can be found in a range of habitats across Africa, in areas where there are rivers, streams, and lakes with good cover on the banks. This range includes forest, wooded savannah, flooded forest, and even mangrove swamps.

The finfoot feeds on aquatic invertebrates, including both adults and larval mayflies, dragonflies, crustaceans, also snails, fish and amphibians. They are thought to be highly opportunistic and take some of their prey directly off the waters surface. They are adept out of water and will forage on the banks as well, unlike the grebes, which they resemble but are not related to.

Finfoots are usually seen singly or in pairs. They are very secretive. Even experienced ornithologists see them very rarely, making them a prized sighting for birders and twitchers. Because they are so elusive, it is not known if they spend most of their time in the water, where they are almost always seen, or on land.

Their time of breeding varies by area, usually coinciding with the rainy season. They build a nest, nothing more than a mess of twigs and reeds, on a fallen tree above the water. Two eggs are laid and incubated solely by the female. The chicks leave the nest a few days after hatching.

==Relationships==
The African finfoot belongs to a family, Heliornithidae, whose only other members are the masked finfoot and the sungrebe. Their relationships between this family and other birds are poorly understood.

==Status and conservation==
The African finfoot&#x27;s conservation status is hard to determine, given its elusive nature. It is not considered threatened, as it is not persecuted or targeted by hunters, and while scarce, it is very widespread. However, there is concern that it may become threatened, as wetlands are cleared and watercourses altered and polluted. It is also thought to tolerate only minimal disturbance. This and increased habitat fragmentation mean that the species needs to be monitored to safeguard it. There are currently no African finfoots in captivity.

<text>The Division of Herbert is an Australian electoral division in the state of Queensland. Eligible voters within the Division elect a single representative, known as the member for Herbert, to the Australian House of Representatives. It covers the city of Townsville. The current MP is Phillip Thompson of the Liberal Party.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==
The division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions at the first federal election. It is located in northern Queensland, and is named after Sir Robert Herbert, the first Premier of Queensland (1859–1866). It has always been based around the city of Townsville.

On its original boundaries, it covered most of north-eastern Queensland, stretching from Mackay to the Torres Strait. Much of its northern portion, including Cairns and the Cape York Peninsula, transferred to Kennedy in 1934 (these areas are now part of Leichhardt. Its south-eastern portion, including Mackay, became Dawson in 1949. By 1984, successive redistributions cut back the seat to little more than Townsville and its inner suburbs.

The seat had long been one of Australia&#x27;s noteworthy bellwether seats. It was won by the party of government for all but two terms from the 1966 election until the 2007 election, where it was hotly contested with local identity and businessman George Colbran pre-selected by Labor to contest Herbert, however Liberal incumbent Peter Lindsay managed to retain the seat with a wafer-thin 50.2 percent two-party vote from a 6 percent two-party swing while his party lost government. Ewen Jones of the merged Liberal National Party succeeded Lindsay and retained the seat at the following two elections with increased margins.

Herbert featured the closest result of any division at the 2016 federal election. Following a recount, the Australian Electoral Commission confirmed on 31 July that Labor&#x27;s Cathy O&#x27;Toole defeated the LNP incumbent by 37 votes, becoming the first Labor member to win the seat since 1996. The LNP considered a legal challenge to the result. The LNP regained the seat with a big swing to them in 2019, part of a large swing to the LNP in Queensland, and in 2022 the seat again swung to the Coalition, bucking the national and statewide swing to Labor.

<doc id="1191804" wikidata="Q1616178" url="?curid=1191804" title="Heterarchy">
<text>A heterarchy is a system of organization where the elements of the organization are unranked (non-hierarchical) or where they possess the potential to be ranked a number of different ways. Definitions of the term vary among the disciplines: in social and information sciences, heterarchies are networks of elements in which each element shares the same &quot;horizontal&quot; position of power and authority, each playing a theoretically equal role. In biological taxonomy, however, the requisite features of heterarchy involve, for example, a species sharing, with a species in a different family, a common ancestor which it does not share with members of its own family. This is theoretically possible under principles of &quot;horizontal gene transfer&quot;.

A heterarchy may be orthogonal to a hierarchy, subsumed to a hierarchy, or it may contain hierarchies; the two kinds of structure are not mutually exclusive. In fact, each level in a hierarchical system is composed of a potentially heterarchical group.

The concept of heterarchy was first employed in a modern context by cybernetician Warren McCulloch in 1945. As Carole L. Crumley has summarised, &quot;[h]e examined alternative cognitive structure(s), the collective organization of which he termed heterarchy. He demonstrated that the human brain, while reasonably orderly was not organized hierarchically. This understanding revolutionized the neural study of the brain and solved major problems in the fields of artificial intelligence and computer design.&quot;

==General principles, operationalization, and evidence==
In a group of related items, heterarchy is a state wherein any pair of items is likely to be related in two or more differing ways. Whereas hierarchies sort groups into progressively smaller categories and subcategories, heterarchies divide and unite groups variously, according to multiple concerns that emerge or recede from view according to perspective. Crucially, no one way of dividing a heterarchical system can ever be a totalizing or all-encompassing view of the system, each division is clearly partial, and in many cases, a partial division leads us, as perceivers, to a feeling of contradiction that invites a new way of dividing things. (But of course the next view is just as partial and temporary.) Heterarchy is a name for this state of affairs, and a description of a heterarchy usually requires ambivalent thought, a willingness to ambulate freely between unrelated perspectives.

However, because the requirements for a heterarchical system are not exactly stated, identifying a heterarchy through the use of archaeological materials can often prove to be difficult.

In an attempt to operationalize heterarchies, Schoenherr and Dopko use the concept of reward systems and Relational models theory. Relational models are defined by distinct expectations for exchanges between individuals in terms of authority ranking, equality matching, communality, and market pricing. They suggest that discrepancies in the kind of reward that is used to assign merit and differences in merit assigned to specific groups of individuals can be used as evidence for heterarchical structure. Their study demonstrates differences in the number of women assigned PhDs, the number of women receiving academic appointments in high status academic institutions, and scientific awards.

Examples of heterarchical conceptualizations include the Gilles Deleuze/Félix Guattari conceptions of deterritorialization, rhizome, and body without organs.

==Information studies==
Numerous observers in the information sciences have argued that heterarchical structure processes more information more effectively than hierarchical design. An example of the potential effectiveness of heterarchy would be the rapid growth of the heterarchical Wikipedia project in comparison with the failed growth of the Nupedia project. Heterarchy increasingly trumps hierarchy as complexity and rate of change increase.

Informational heterarchy can be defined as an organizational form somewhere between hierarchy and network that provides horizontal links that permit different elements of an organization to cooperate whilst individually optimizing different success criteria. In an organizational context the value of heterarchy derives from the way in which it permits the legitimate valuation of multiple skills, types of knowledge or working styles without privileging one over the other. In information science, therefore, heterarchy, responsible autonomy and hierarchy are sometimes combined under the umbrella term Triarchy.

This concept has also been applied to the field of archaeology, where it has enabled researchers to better understand social complexity. For further reading see the works of Carole Crumley.

The term heterarchy is used in conjunction with the concepts of holons and holarchy to describe individual systems at each level of a holarchy.

== Brain science ==
A heterarchical network could be used to describe neuron connections or democracy, although there are clearly hierarchical elements in both.

==Sociology and political theory==
Anthropologist Dmitri Bondarenko follows Carole Crumley in her definition of heterarchy as &quot;the relation of elements to one another when they are unranked or when they possess the potential for being ranked in a number of different ways&quot; and argues that it is therefore not strictly the opposite of hierarchy, but is rather the opposite of homoarchy, itself definable as &quot;the relation of elements to one another when they possess the potential for being ranked in one way only&quot;.

David C. Stark (1950- ) has been contributing to developing the concept of heterarchy in the sociology of organizations.

Political hierarchies and heterarchies are systems in which multiple dynamic power-structures govern the actions of the system. They represent different types of network structures that allow differing degrees of connectivity. In a (tree-structured) hierarchy every node is connected to at most one parent node and to zero or more child nodes. In a heterarchy, however, a node can be connected to any of its surrounding nodes without needing to go through or to get permission from some other node.

Socially, a heterarchy distributes privilege and decision-making among participants, while a hierarchy assigns more power and privilege to the members &quot;high&quot; in the structure. In a systemic perspective, Gilbert Probst, Jean-Yves Mercier and others describe heterarchy as the flexibility of the formal relationships inside an organization. Domination and subordination links can be reversed and privileges can be redistributed in each situation, following the needs of the system.

Researchers have also framed higher-education staff as operating in a heterarchical structure. Examining sex-based discrimination in psychology, Schoenherr and Dopko identify discrepancies between the number of women awarded PhDs, the number of professorships held by women, and the number of scientific awards granted to women in the behavioral sciences and by the American Psychological Association. They argue that this data supports difference reward systems, representing heterarchies. They go on to connect the notion of heterarchy to contemporary models of relational structures in psychology (i.e., relational models theory). Schoenherr has argued that this is also reflected in divisions within professional psychology, such as those between clinical psychologists and experimental psychologists. Using the history of professional psychology in Canada and the United States, he provides quotations from professional organization to illustrate the disparate identities and reward-systems. Rather than just reflecting a feature of psychological science, these case studies were presented as evidence of heterarchies in academia and in social organizations more generally.

<text>The domain names example.com, example.net, example.org, and example.edu are second-level domain names in the Domain Name System of the Internet. They are reserved by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) at the direction of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as special-use domain names for documentation purposes. The domain names are used widely in books, tutorials, sample network configurations, and generally as examples for the use of domain names. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) operates websites for these domains with content that reflects their purpose.

==Purpose==
The domains &quot;example.com&quot;, &quot;example.net&quot;, &quot;example.org&quot; and &quot;example.edu&quot; are intended for general use in any kind of documentation, such as technical and software documentation, manuals, and sample software configurations. Thus, documentation writers can be sure to select a domain name without creating naming conflicts if end-users try to use the sample configurations or examples verbatim. The domains may be used in documentation without prior consultation with IANA or ICANN.

In practice, these domain names are also installed in the Domain Name System with the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and IPv6 of a web server managed by ICANN. The domains are digitally signed using Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC).

The zone files of each domain also define one subdomain name. The third-level domain name &quot;www&quot; resolves to the IP addresses of the parent domains.

==History==
The second-level domain label &quot;example&quot; for the top-level domains com, net, and org have been reserved and registered since at least 1992. The IETF established the authority of this use in 1999.

In 2013, the status and purpose of the domains was restated by the IETF as belonging to a group of &quot;special-use domain names&quot;.

<text>Lady Washington was a row galley in the Continental Navy, named in honor of Martha Washington. It was the first U.S. military ship to be named in honor of a woman (and of a future First Lady) and the first named for a person while the person was still alive (see also List of U.S. military vessels named after living Americans).

&quot;Lady Washington&quot; was built in New York City in the spring of 1776 at the behest of General George Washington after he transferred his forces from Boston to New York. Constructed with New York funds for the defense of the Hudson River, the galley remained active under Washington through June 1777. During the next year the New York fleet captured about a dozen prizes before the permanent British occupation of the city caused the State to abandon naval activities.

<text>Freda Warrington is a British author, known for her epic fantasy, vampire and supernatural novels. 

== Career ==
Born in Leicester, Warrington grew up in Leicestershire. Early influences included Hammer horror films and classic vampire novels like Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; and J.S. Le Fanu&#x27;s &quot;Camilla&quot;. She was also inspired by local history and the art of the Pre-Raphaelites.

After completing high school, Warrington trained at the Loughborough College of Art and Design, and afterward held a job at the Medical Illustration Department of Leicester Royal Infirmary. She eventually moved to full-time writing, pursuing a love she had had since childhood. In addition to her writing, Warrington works part-time in the Charnwood Forest. 

Four of her novels (&quot;Dark Cathedral&quot;, &quot;Pagan Moon&quot;, &quot;Dracula the Undead&quot;, and &quot;The Amber Citadel&quot;) have been nominated for the British Fantasy Society&#x27;s Best Novel award. 
&quot;Dracula the Undead&quot; won the Dracula Society&#x27;s 1997 &quot;Children of the Night Award&quot;. Her novel, &quot;Elfland&quot;, won the Romantic Times Reviewers&#x27; Choice Award in the Fantasy Novel category for 2009. Warrington has also seen numerous short stories published in anthologies and magazines.

Some of her books are set in Leicestershire, such as the &quot;Aetherial Tales&quot; series, depicting the lives, loves and adventures of magical people living hidden in this region, passing for - and sharing many cultural traits with - ordinary English people.

==Asbāb al-nuzūl==
Asbāb al-nuzūl (أسباب النزول), meaning occasions or circumstances of revelation, refers to the historical context in which Quranic ayaat were revealed. Regarding the timing and contextual background of the revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;), it is an earlier &quot;Meccan surah&quot;, which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, rather than later in Medina. Alī ibn Ahmad al-Wāhidī (d. 468/1075), is the earliest scholar of the branch of the Qur&#x27;anic sciences known as Asbāb al-Nuzūl. He records that 
==Summary==
This surah urges the Quraysh tribe who dominated Mecca to serve God, who had protected them, for the sake of their own future. It is one of two suras containing 4 ayat; the other is Al-Ikhlas. It forms a pair with the preceding sura, al-Fil, reminding the Quraysh of the favors that Allah had bestowed upon them.

The Kaaba was central to the life of the Quraysh, being a center of pilgrimage which brought much trade and prestige. Sura al-Fil describes how God saved the Kaaba from destruction, while Sura Quraysh describes God as Lord of the Kaaba. It also urges the Quraysh to worship God so that, among other things, he would protect them on their trading journeys.

<text>Chileka International Airport is an international airport in Malawi. It is located approximately , by road, northwest of Blantyre, the second largest city in the Republic of Malawi and the country&#x27;s commercial and financial capital. Chileka is Malawi&#x27;s second international airport, the other being Kamuzu International Airport, in Lilongwe, the nation&#x27;s capital city.

== Facilities ==
The airport&#x27;s geographical coordinates are:15°40&#x27;52.0&quot;S, 34°58&#x27;18.0&quot;E (Latitude:-15.681111; Longitude:34.971667). The airport is at an elevation of above mean sea level.

The airport has two asphalt paved runways: 10/28 measures and 15/33 measures .

==Renovations==
In April 2019 scheduled renovations and extensions to the main runway were commenced, resulting in the temporary closure of runway 10/28. The renovations were initially scheduled to last for three months, with operations expected to resume in July 2019. However, several delays caused the project to take longer than anticipated, and the reopening date was pushed back at least three times.

The airport continued to be operational during this time, handling arrivals and departures of smaller aircraft on runway 15/33. During the closure, all arrivals and departures on medium range and larger aircraft operated from Kamuzu International Airport, with onward transfers to and from Chileka International Airport, on smaller aircraft.

The renovation works were finally completed in December 2019, and normal operations with both runways were resumed on 1 January 2020.

<text>Rancid is the eponymously titled debut extended play by the American punk rock band Rancid. It was released in January 1992 through Lookout! Records, home of Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman&#x27;s prior band, Operation Ivy. It is a recording of the band in its earliest days as a three-piece. Although the correct title of the extended play is simply &quot;Rancid&quot;, it is commonly referred to as &quot;I&#x27;m Not the Only One&quot; or &quot;The Bottle&quot; (because of the cover) among Rancid collectors and fans.

Only released on seven-inch vinyl, the songs from the extended play have never been re-recorded for future albums. As of June 2008, it is out of print and has not been domestically released on CD, however, its contents appear as bonus tracks on the Japanese release of &quot;B Sides and C Sides&quot;. In May 2024, it was made available on streaming platforms.

A common bootleg recording from these sessions exists entitled &quot;Demos from the Pit&quot;. It contains nearly twenty more songs, half of which are unreleased, the others are different versions of songs from its debut studio album, &quot;Rancid&quot;. Many feature completely different lyrics, and music.

<text>The AGO system is the industrial process for manufacturing stitchless (glued) shoes. 

The first effective and reliable adhesive was invented and patented in 1909 by the Italian chemist Francesco Rampichini, who also developed the whole manufacturing process and the relevant machinery in 1910–13.

The name AGO (from the Greek &quot;ago&quot;, meaning &quot;attract&quot;, &quot;fasten&quot;), still used in the industry, was chosen by Rampichini for the glue and the process in 1910.

<doc id="1191870" wikidata="Q292488" url="?curid=1191870" title="AGM-28 Hound Dog">
<text>The North American Aviation AGM-28 Hound Dog was a supersonic, turbojet-propelled, nuclear armed, air-launched cruise missile developed in 1959 for the United States Air Force. It was primarily designed to be capable of attacking Soviet ground-based air defense sites prior to a potential air attack by B-52 Stratofortress long range bombers during the Cold War. The Hound Dog was first given the designation B-77, then redesignated GAM-77, and finally AGM-28. It was conceived as a temporary standoff missile for the B-52, to be used until the GAM-87 Skybolt air-launched ballistic missile was available. Instead, the Skybolt was cancelled within a few years and the Hound Dog continued to be deployed for a total of 15 years until its replacement by newer missiles, including the AGM-69 SRAM and then the AGM-86 ALCM.

==Development==
During the 1950s the US became aware of developments regarding the Soviet Union&#x27;s surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), notably at large installations being constructed around Moscow. At the time, the entire nuclear deterrent of the United States was based on crewed strategic bombers, both with the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy. The deployment of large numbers of SAMs placed this force at some risk of being rendered ineffective. One solution to this problem is to extend the range of the bomb, either through glide bomb techniques, or more practically, by mounting them in a short-to-medium-range missile. This allows the weapon to be fired while the bomber remains outside the range of the enemy&#x27;s defensive missiles.

Since the Soviet air-defenses were static and easy to spot from aerial reconnaissance or satellite reconnaissance photos, the Air Force planned to use a long-range cruise missile to attack the air-defense bases before the bombers got within their range. The SA-2 Guideline missile had a maximum range of about 30 kilometers at that time. Since the bombers would be approaching the sites as the weapon flew towards it, their own guided missiles would have to be launched well before it entered this range. The weapon needed to fly fast enough and far enough that the bomber was at a safe distance when the weapon reached the target. If the American missile was to be used to attack enemy air bases as well, an extended range of several hundred kilometers would be needed due to the much longer range of the fighters compared to the SAMs.

A missile with these capabilities was called for in General Operational Requirement 148, which was released on March 15, 1956, known as WS-131B. GOR 148 called for a supersonic air-to-surface cruise missile with a weight of not more than (fully fueled and armed) to be carried in pairs by the B-52 Stratofortress. Each B-52 would carry two of the missiles, one under each wing, on a pylon located between the B-52&#x27;s fuselage and its inboard pair of engines.

Both Chance Vought and North American Aviation submitted GAM-77 proposals to the USAF in July 1957, and both based on their earlier work on long-range ground-launched cruise missiles. Vought&#x27;s submission was for an air-launched version of the Regulus missile, developed for the US Navy, while North American&#x27;s was adapted from their Navaho missile. On August 21, 1957, North American Aviation was awarded a contract to develop Weapon System 131B, which included the Hound Dog missile.

The importance of Hound Dog in penetrating the Soviet air-defense system was later described by Senator John F. Kennedy in a speech to the American Legion convention in Miami, Florida, on October 18, 1960: &quot;We must take immediate steps to protect our present nuclear striking force from surprise attack. Today, more than 90 percent of our retaliatory capacity is made up of aircraft and missiles which have fixed, un-protectable bases whose location is known to the Russians. We can only do this by providing SAC with the capability of maintaining a continuous airborne alert, and by pressing projects such as the Hound Dog air-ground missile, which will enable crewed bombers to penetrate Soviet defenses with their weapons&quot;.

==Design==

The Hound Dog missile&#x27;s airframe was an adaptation of technology developed in the SM-64 Navaho missile, adapted for launching from the B-52. The Hound Dog&#x27;s design was based on that of the Navaho G-38 missile, which featured small delta wings and forward canards.

A Pratt &amp; Whitney J52-P-3 turbojet propelled the Hound Dog, instead of Navaho&#x27;s ramjet engine. The J52 engine was located in a pod located beneath the rear fuselage. The J52-P-3 used in the Hound Dog, unlike J52s installed in aircraft like the A-4 Skyhawk or the A-6 Intruder, was optimized to run at maximum power during the missile&#x27;s flight. As a result, the Hound Dog&#x27;s version of the J52 had a short operating lifetime of only six hours. However, in combat, the Hound Dog was expected to self-destruct in less than six hours.

A derivative of the Navaho&#x27;s NAA Autonetics Division N-6 inertial navigation system (INS), the N5G, was used in the Hound Dog. A star tracker manufactured by Kollsman Instruments Co. and located in the B-52&#x27;s pylon was used to correct inertial navigation system orientation errors with celestial observations while the Hound Dog was being carried by the B-52. The INS could also be used to determine the bomber&#x27;s position after the initial calibration and &quot;leveling&quot; process, which took about 90 minutes. The Hound Dog had a circular error probable (CEP) of , which was acceptable for a weapon equipped with a nuclear warhead.

The thermonuclear warhead carried by the Hound Dog was the W28 Class D. The W28 warhead could be preset to yield an explosive power of between 70 kilotons and 1.45 megatons. Detonation of the Hound Dog&#x27;s W28 warhead could be programmed to occur on impact (ground burst) or air burst at a preset altitude. An air burst would have been used against a large area, soft target. A surface impact would have been used against a hard target such as a missile site or command and control center.

The Hound Dog could be launched from the B-52 Stratofortress at high altitudes or low altitudes, but not below in altitude. Initially, three different flight profiles for the Hound Dog were available for selection by the commander and the bombardier of the bomber (though other options were added later):

*High-altitude attack: The Hound Dog would have flown at a high altitude (up to depending on the amount of jet fuel on board the missile) all the way to the immediate area of its target, then diving to its nuclear warhead&#x27;s preset detonation altitude.
*Low-altitude attack: The Hound Dog would have flown at a low altitude – below (air-pressure altitude) to its target where its nuclear warhead would have detonated. In this mode of operation, the Hound Dog had a shortened range of about when this flight profile was used. The missile would not carry out terrain following in this flight profile. No major terrain obstructions could exist at the preset altitude along the missile&#x27;s flight path.
*Low-altitude attack: The GAM-77B (later AGM-28B) could fly a low radar altitude, from above the ground. As mentioned above in the GAM-77A model description, this shortened range. However, the improvement of &quot;flying in the weeds&quot;, was such that the missile could be flown down in ground clutter (radar) thus nearly invisible to radar detection. Eventually, all A model GAM-77s were given this modification as well.
*A dogleg attack: The Hound Dog would have flown along a designated heading (at either high or low altitudes) to a preset location. At that location the missile would have turned left or right and then proceeded to its target. The intention of this maneuver was to attempt to draw defensive fighter planes away from the missile&#x27;s target.

The first air-drop test of a dummy Hound Dog was carried out in November 1958. 52 GAM-77A missiles were launched for testing and training purposes between April 23, 1959, and August 30, 1965. Hound Dog launches occurred at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, and at the White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.

The Hound Dog missile&#x27;s development was completed in only 30 months. North American received a production contract to build Hound Dogs on October 16, 1958. The first production Hound Dog missile was then delivered to the Air Force on December 21, 1959. 722 Hound Dog missiles were produced by North American Aviation before its production of them ended in March 1963.

In May 1961, an improved Hound Dog missile was test-flown for the first time. This upgrade incorporated improvements to reduce its radar cross-section. The Hound Dog already had a low head-on radar cross-section because of its highly swept delta wings. This low radar cross-section was lowered further by replacing its nose cap, engine intake spike, and engine duct with new radar-absorbent material components that scattered or absorbed radar energy. It has been reported that these radar cross-section improvements were removed as Hound Dogs were withdrawn from service.

The GAM-77A version of the GAM-77 also included a new Kollsman Instruments KS-140 star tracker that was integrated with the N-6 inertial navigation system. This unit replaced the star tracker that had been located in the B-52&#x27;s wing pylon. The fuel capacity of the GAM-77A was increased during this upgrade. A radar altimeter was added to the missile to provide (vertical) terrain-following radar capability to the Hound Dog. 428 Hound Dog missiles were upgraded to the GAM-77A configuration by North American.

66 GAM-77A Hound Dog missiles were launched for testing and training up through April 1973.

In June 1963 the GAM-77 and GAM-77A were re-designated AGM-28A and AGM-28B, respectively.

In 1971, a Hound Dog missile was test-flown with a newly developed Terrain Contour Matching (TERCOM) navigation system. Reportedly, the designation AGM-28C was reserved for this version of the Hound Dog if development had been continued. While a Hound Dog with TERCOM was never deployed, this technology, with much better electronics and digital computers, was later used in both the Air Force&#x27;s Air Launched Cruise Missile and the Navy&#x27;s Tomahawk.

In 1972, the Bendix Corporation was awarded a contract to develop an anti-radiation missile passive radar seeker to guide the Hound Dog missile to antennas transmitting radar signals. A Hound Dog with this radar seeker was test-flown in 1973, but never mass-produced.

==Operational history==
On December 21, 1959, General Thomas S. Power, the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Strategic Air Command (SAC), formally accepted the first production Hound Dog missile. Just two months later in February, SAC test-launched its first unarmed Hound Dog at Eglin Air Force Base.

In July 1960, the Hound Dog reached initial operational capability with the first B-52 unit. In November 1960, the 97th Bombardment Wing at Blytheville Air Force Base, Arkansas became the first combat wing in SAC to be equipped with the missile. The first test flight at the base took place on November 16, 1960. The Hound Dog was used on airborne alert for the first time in January 1962. In 1962, SAC activated missile maintenance squadrons to provide maintenance for both the Hound Dog and the ADM-20 Quail decoy missile. Full operational capability was achieved in August 1963 when 29 B-52 bomber wings were operational with the Hound Dog.

In 1960, SAC developed procedures so that the B-52 could use the Hound Dog&#x27;s J52 engine for additional thrust while the missile was located on the bomber&#x27;s two pylons. This helped heavily laden B-52s fly away from their airbases faster, before enemy nuclear weapons obliterated them. The Hound Dog could then be refueled from the B-52&#x27;s wing fuel tanks.

One Hound Dog missile crashed near the town of Samson, Alabama, when it failed to self-destruct after a test launch from Eglin Air Force Base. In 1962, a Hound Dog was accidentally dropped to the ground during an underwing systems check.

In May 1962, operation &quot;Silk Hat&quot; was conducted at Eglin Air Force Base. During this exercise, a Hound Dog test launch was conducted before an audience of national and international dignitaries headed by President John F. Kennedy and Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson.

On September 22, 1966, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara recommended retiring all of the remaining Hound Dog missiles within a few years. The Hound Dogs would be retained pending the outcome of the Terrain Contour Matching (TERCOM) guidance system development program. Secretary McNamara&#x27;s recommendation was not acted upon, and the Hound Dog remained in service.

After thirteen years of service with the Air Force, the last Hound Dog missile was removed from alert deployment on June 30, 1975. The Hound Dog missiles were kept in dead storage for a number of years. The last Hound Dog was retired for scrapping on June 15, 1978, from the 42nd Bomb Wing at Loring Air Force Base, Maine.

No Hound Dog missile was ever used in combat, since it was strictly a weapon for nuclear warfare.

<text>Radio Radio Radio is an EP by the American punk rock band Rancid. The EP was released on August 26, 1993, through Fat Wreck Chords with the catalog number FAT 509. It was also their only release on Fat Wreck Chords.

It is the first Rancid release with four members, with the inclusion of Lars Fredriksen on guitar and vocals. Previously a three-piece, Rancid was in need of a second guitar player to refine their sound. They had briefly performed live with Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day as their second guitar player, but Billie Joe decided to stay with Green Day rather than become a full member of Rancid. &quot;Radio&quot; was written in the short time that Billie Joe was in the band, and he therefore was a co-writer of the song. After Billie Joe decided to leave, Frederiksen filled the spot. Frederiksen had previously been a member of the British punk rock band the U.K. Subs.

&quot;Radio&quot; and &quot;Dope Sick Girl&quot; were both re-recorded for the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;, which was released the next year. The versions on the EP, &quot;Radio&quot; in particular, are arranged differently than the versions on &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;.

Fat Wreck Chords reissued the EP on January 15, 2009, on white vinyl.

<text>Golden Years (also referred to as Stephen King&#x27;s Golden Years) is an American television science fiction thriller miniseries that aired in seven parts on CBS from July 16 to August 22, 1991 as a part of its 1991 schedule.

==Plot==
Harlan Williams, an elderly janitor, is caught up in an explosion at the top-secret laboratory where he works. After surviving but discovering he is now &quot;aging&quot; in reverse, he ends up on the run from an operative of &quot;The Shop&quot;.

==Cast==
;All episodes
* Keith Szarabajka as Harlan Williams
* Felicity Huffman as Terry Spann
* Frances Sternhagen as Gina Williams
* Ed Lauter as Gen. Louis Crewes
* R. D. Call as Jude Andrews
* Bill Raymond as Dr. Richard X. Toddhunter

* Erik King as Burton
* John Rothman as Dr. Ackerman
* Harriet Sansom Harris as Francie Williams
* Matt Malloy as Redding
* Margo Martindale as Thelma
* Stephen King (&quot;cameo/episode 5&quot;) as a bus driver

==Production==
King called &quot;Golden Years&quot; a &quot;novel for television&quot;; it originated as an idea for a novel that sat in his notebook for years. He &quot;wrote the first five episodes and outlined the last two.&quot; King credited &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; for making it possible for &quot;Golden Years&quot; to be produced:
&quot;Up until &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; came on, the only sort of continuing drama that TV understood was soap opera, &quot;Dallas&quot;, &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, that sort of thing. To some degree David Lynch gave them that. But he turned the whole idea of that continuing soap opera inside out like a sock. If you think of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; as a man, it&#x27;s a man in delirium, a man spouting stream-of-consciousness stuff. &quot;Golden Years&quot; is like &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; without the delirium.&quot;

The miniseries was intended to lead into a regular series, and therefore ended on a cliffhanger. CBS, however, decided not to pick up the option on the full series, and it was never realized. King asked for four hours of airtime in the following spring to finish the story, but CBS denied him this as well. The home video version changes the last few minutes of the final episode to give the story an optimistic ending.

<text>José Manuel Guillén (pronounced ; born May 17, 1976) is a Dominican former professional baseball outfielder. Guillén played for ten Major League Baseball (MLB) teams in his career.

==Professional career==

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
Guillén was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates as an amateur free agent on August 19, . He made his MLB debut on April 1, and was the team&#x27;s everyday right fielder. Guillén made the jump to the Majors having played the entire 1996 campaign in High-A.

===Tampa Bay Devil Rays===
On July 23, , Guillén was traded, along with Jeff Sparks, to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for Joe Oliver and Humberto Cota. On November 27, , after two injury-plagued seasons with the Devil Rays, the team released him.

===Arizona Diamondbacks===
On December 18, , Guillén signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He played in only 54 games for the Diamondbacks before being released on July 22, .

===Colorado Rockies===
Guillén was signed by the Colorado Rockies on July 29, , but was released just three days later on August 1, before playing in any games.

===Cincinnati Reds===
On August 20, 2002, Guillén signed with the Cincinnati Reds.

===Oakland Athletics===
On July 30, , Guillén was traded by the Reds to the Oakland Athletics for Aaron Harang, Joe Valentine, Kyle Wallace, and Jeff Bruksch. While he was hitting home runs in 2003, he was not taking many walks. He is one of only six players who have concluded a 30-homer season with more homers than walks (31 HR, 29 BB), the others being Alfonso Soriano (39–23 in 2002), Garret Anderson (35–24 in 2000), Iván Rodríguez (35–24 in 1999), Joe Crede (30–28 in 2006), and Ryan Braun (34–24 in 2007) After the 2003 season he became a free agent.

===Anaheim Angels===
On December 20, 2003, Guillén was signed by the Anaheim Angels.

In 2004, he hit .294 with 27 home runs and 104 RBIs for the Angels, but he was suspended the last two weeks of the regular season and during the postseason for &quot;inappropriate conduct&quot; in publicly expressing his displeasure with Angels manager Mike Scioscia following Scioscia&#x27;s removal of Guillén in favor of a pinch runner during a crucial game against the Oakland Athletics.

===Washington Nationals===
On November 19, 2004, he was traded to the Washington Nationals for shortstop Maicer Izturis and outfielder Juan Rivera. The move sent Guillén to his sixth team in just five seasons.

In 2005, Guillén began his season strongly. In April, he batted .303 with 6 home runs and 14 RBIs. The Nationals were impressed and on April 29, they exercised his option for 2006.

On June 14, 2005, the Nationals began a three-game series against the Angels, who were still helmed by Mike Scioscia. This marked Guillén&#x27;s first return to Anaheim since being traded. Going into the series, both Guillén and Scioscia kept a civil tone publicly, each indicating that the past was behind them and claiming that they held no hard feelings toward each other. However, the tensions below the surface were exposed when, during the second game of the series, Angels pitcher Brendan Donnelly was found with illegal substances on his glove.

Donnelly was ejected from the game, and Scioscia came out of the dugout and exchanged hostile words with Nationals manager Frank Robinson, who had instigated the search of Donnelly&#x27;s glove. The confrontation led to both teams&#x27; benches being cleared as all of the players streamed out on to the field. As he was being restrained by fellow Nationals players, Guillén shouted angry words at the Angels, a number of whom made it clear that they felt their former teammate had been the one who told Robinson to have Donnelly&#x27;s glove examined. (Several weeks later, Guillén would acknowledge that he had indeed done so.)

In the eighth inning of the same game, Guillén hit a two-run home run to tie the game, and the Nationals went on to win. After the series&#x27; final game, Guillén blasted Scioscia and acknowledged that despite his earlier statements to the contrary, he was in fact still hurt over what had happened at the end of the 2004 season.

Nevertheless, Guillén remained as a crucial ball player for the Washington Nationals. In 2005, he hit .283 with 24 home runs and 76 RBI for Washington.

In 2006, he was involved in an incident with Pedro Martínez. Martinez hit him with a pitch twice, and after the second time Guillén charged the mound, only to be held back by Paul Lo Duca and umpire Ted Barrett. Guillén appeared in only 69 games and hit only .216 with 9 homers and 40 RBI. On July 25, 2006, he was diagnosed with a tear of the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow, which would require ligament replacement surgery.

===Seattle Mariners===

Before the 2007 season Guillén signed with the Seattle Mariners. His swing, which is very balanced and natural, moved him up in the Mariners&#x27; lineup to hit in the coveted third spot during May 2007. Guillén helped the Mariners return to the playoff hunt in 2007 after not making the playoffs since 2001.

In 2007 it was reported that in 2003 Guillén had had performance-enhancing drugs sent directly to him in the Oakland Coliseum.

===Kansas City Royals===
On December 4, 2007, Guillén signed a 3-year, $36 million contract with the Kansas City Royals. His signing moved Mark Teahen to left field, and Billy Butler to first base. He was suspended for the first 15 days of the 2008 season on December 6, 2007, just hours after passing his physical exam. His 15-day suspension was rescinded on April 11, 2008; after the MLB Players&#x27; Association and MLB owners agreed on modifications to the current drug testing program. As a result of the agreement, all players implicated in the Mitchell Report were given amnesty.

In a game on August 26, 2008, in Kansas City against the Texas Rangers, Guillén was involved in a confrontation with a fan in the stands just past the Royals dugout down the first base line. He made vulgar gestures and yelled profanity at the fan who had reportedly been heckling him for his lack of hustle. His coaches and teammates had to restrain him as he made his way towards the fan. The fan was removed from his seat.

On May 21, 2010, Guillén got his 1,500th career hit in Kauffman Stadium against the Colorado Rockies.

On August 5, Guillén was designated for assignment.

===San Francisco Giants===
On August 13, 2010, Guillén was traded to the San Francisco Giants for cash and a player to be named later which turned out to be Kevin Pucetas. But shortly after joining the Giants, he was placed on their restricted list for postseason eligibility because he was being investigated for performance-enhancing drugs.

==Alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs==
Guillén was linked to performance-enhancing drugs in the Mitchell Report. He was suspended for fifteen games in 2007, but was granted amnesty like all other players mentioned in that report. In 2009, he acknowledged that he had worked &quot;for many years&quot; with Angel Presinal, a personal trainer closely linked to performance-enhancing drugs and who is currently banned from major league clubhouses. But he claimed he hadn&#x27;t worked with Presinal since 2004 although they were still friends, and continues to claim that he has never used (or even been offered) performance-enhancing drugs.

In 2010, MLB began an inquiry on shipments of human growth hormone received by Guillén, and directed the Giants to keep him off their postseason roster. On November 14, it was revealed that the DEA had intercepted a package of fifty HGH syringes en route to Guillén&#x27;s house.

<doc id="1191896" wikidata="Q240113" url="?curid=1191896" title="Marie Casimire d'Arquien">
<text>Marie Casimire Louise de La Grange d&#x27;Arquien (, ; 28 June 1641 – 30 January 1716), known also by the diminutive form &quot;Marysieńka&quot;, was a French noblewoman who became the queen consort of Poland and grand duchess consort of Lithuania from 1674 to 1696 by her marriage to King and Grand Duke John III Sobieski of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. She had great influence upon the affairs of state with the approval of her spouse, and acted in effect as regent during his absence.

==Early life==
Marie Casimire and her sister Louise Marie were the only surviving children of Henri de la Grange, Marquis d&#x27;Arquien and his first wife, Francoise de la Chastre (1613-1648). She came to Poland at the age of five years as a lady in waiting to Marie Louise Gonzaga, the French-born Queen of Poland and Grand Duchess of Lithuania from 1645 to 1672, wife and consort to two Polish kings and Lithuanian grand dukes — Władysław IV Vasa and later his brother (who succeeded him) John II Casimir Vasa. Marie Louise was rumored to be Marie Casimire&#x27;s real mother, although unproven, they certainly had a close relationship. The harsh climate of Poland did not prove healthy for Marie Casimire, and she developed a persistent cough and recurring fever. 

At the court, she met and fell in love with John Sobieski, who arrived there in 1656, but she was first married off to Jan &quot;Sobiepan&quot; Zamoyski in 1658, with whom she had four children, all of whom died in early childhood. Jan Zamoyski died on 2 April 1665 and the widowed Marie Casimire married Jan Sobieski just over three months later, on 14 July of the same year. The couple had thirteen children together, but only four of them reached adulthood— Jakub, Aleksander, Konstanty and Teresa (who later became &quot;Kurfürstin&quot; of Bavaria and mother to Emperor Karl VII).

==Queen of Poland and Grand Duchess of Lithuania==

John Sobieski was elected King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania in 1674, not without the influence of his wife. As the Queen of Poland and Grand Duchess of Lithuania, Marie Casimire quickly became unpopular, as she supported the proposed Polish–French alliance, while simultaneously striving to gain privileges for her family from the French king Louis XIV, whom she greatly admired. Like Marie Louise Gonzaga, Marie Casimire was a strong supporter of an absolute monarchy, for which she was reviled by certain spheres of the Szlachta. The nobility were scandalized at the queen&#x27;s political meddling, believing that no foreign woman should interfere. Marie Casimire also opposed the Commonwealth&#x27;s policy of religious toleration and supported the Edict of Fontainebleau. 

Her influence is exemplified in an incident in 1678, when the Chancellor of Nowogrod, Mikołaj Władysław Przeździecki, came to the king as the leader of an unofficial delegation to present him with evidence that the Pac family were his enemies. According to Mikolaj Wladyslaw Prze Dziecki, &quot;The Queen knocked on the doors until the King asked for them to be opened and then took the monarch by the hand, leading him to the side, with great force, speaking in French&quot;, which the Chancellor viewed with disgust. 

In the 1670s, the king of France wished to close a treaty between France, Sweden, Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Turkey. The French ambassador recommended working with Marie Casimire since &quot;only the Queen Consort of Poland can convince the King, her husband, to close a treaty&quot;. 
Queen Marie Casimire gave her support to this issue, and a secret treaty was signed in Jaworowo on 11 June 1675, and completed by a treaty between Poland and Sweden in 1677. 
Her Pro-French policies were however discontinued in 1678, when France had not fulfilled the terms promised her for her services, such as making her father a Peer of France, combined with the fact that Marie Casimire became concerned with the threat of the Turks.

Queen Marie Casimire sent her lady-in-waiting and confidante Malgorzata Korowska as her political agent to the emperor in 1679 to find out his view concerning an alliance between the emperor and Poland against Turkey, and on 1 April 1683, Poland signed the military alliance with the emperor which she had supported. 
She also played an important role during the war against Turkey, when she was credited with having convinced her spouse to support the emperor when Vienna was attacked in 1683. The French ambassador Michelle de Mongrillon described her influence when he commented: 
&quot;She could move her husband first of all, then she moved the huge, lethargic corps of the Commonwealth that is so difficult to set in motion&quot;. 

Poland and Lithuania joined the Holy League in 1684, an act which had been promoted by Marie Casimire. 
When king John Sobieski was absent in Wallachia and Moldova in 1686 and 1691 and at the Battle of Kamenets, queen Marie Casimire are acknowledged to have ruled in effect as regent in his absence. 
As such she had the authority to negotiate the military and trade treaty with France in September 1692, which restored the relations between Paris, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Warsaw known as the &quot;Crown of the North Alliance&quot;. 
She worked with the French ambassador Robert Le Roux d&#x27;Esenval and his successor Melchior de Polignac to settle unsettled affairs within the Crown of the North Alliance as well as the Peace treaty with Turkey. 

In 1695 she successfully solved the conflict between the King&#x27;s backer, the Bishop of Vilnius, Konstanty Brzostowski, and Kazimiers Jan Sapieha, as she wished to win the Sapieha party to support her son&#x27;s candidacy as king and grand duke. 

Queen Marie Casimire herself commented concerning the great political influence she had during the reign of her spouse in a letter in retrospect: 
:&quot;I bear the burden of all the matters at hand, as my late husband loved me more than I deserved. Therefore, he did anything that pleased me and that I allowed for, as he considered me smarter than I am&quot;.

==Later life==

Marie Casimire was described as hard, arrogant, and self-centered. She was widowed in 1696. She remained in Poland for three years. In 1699, she departed for a distinguished exile in Rome. 

She was expected to be accepted with the same respect and prestige as Christina, Queen of Sweden, a well-known art patron and founder of the Academy of Arcadia. But Marie Casimire was not considered to possess Queen Christina&#x27;s virtues, neither her nobility, nor her intellect. She believed that her devoted support of Catholicism vis-a-vis the Turks would receive an enthusiastic reception from the church in Rome, but that the Swedish queen, who had converted from Protestantism to Catholicism, had also elevated her status in the eyes of the Vatican. Nevertheless, Marie Casimire was well received and became a music patron who was mainly patronized by Domenico Scarlatti. In his role as maestro di Capella, he composed and produced seven operas with her, as a continuation of the operas written by his father, Alessandro. 

Marysieńka spent the last one and a half years of her life in her native France, where in January 1716 she died after a rinsing of the stomach administered by a doctor. The coffin was moved to the chapel of St. Eustace in the church of St. Savior in Blois. On the other hand, the heart was put in a casket in the local Jesuit church (it was later lost during the French Revolution). Then in 1717, the coffin with Marysieńka&#x27;s body was buried in the Capuchin church in Warsaw, next to John III. In 1733, both bodies were transported to the Wawel Cathedral in Krakow.

==Legacy==
The royal couple became famous for their love letters, most of which were written from 1665 to 1683, when they were parted either due to John III Sobieski&#x27;s military engagements or her travels to Paris. The letters give insight not only into the authentic feelings of the loving couple, but also their reflections on contemporary issues and difficulties, as well as down-to-earth matters concerning the royal household and little day-to-day decisions made by the monarch, who often consulted his wife about them. Published long after the death of both of them, they can be credited with popularizing the King&#x27;s way of addressing the Queen by the very diminutive form of her first name — &quot;Marysieńka&quot;. She is widely remembered and referred to in Poland that way.

==Issue==

Marie Casimire first married Jan &quot;Sobiepan&quot; Zamoyski (1627–1665) on March 3, 1658 in Warsaw. They had four children, all of whom died in early childhood:
* Ludwika Maria (April 1659 – May 1659).
* Son (born and died January 1660).
* Katarzyna Barbara (5 December 1660 – December 1662).
* Daughter (May 1664 – August 1664).

Zamoyski himself died April 2, 1665. Marie Casimire quickly remarried in July of that year to the future John III Sobieski. This marriage was famously happy, and the couple had thirteen children, nine of whom died in childhood:
*Jakub Ludwik Henryk (2 November 1667 – 19 December 1737), Crown Prince of Poland and Lithuania, married Countess Palatine Hedwig Elisabeth of Neuburg and had issue.
* Twin Daughters (9 May 1669), stillborn or died shortly after birth.
* Teresa Teofila (October 1670), was a frail child and failed to survive for more than a month. The child was born and died while her mother was in France.
* Adelajda Ludwika (15 October 1672 – 10 February 1677), called &quot;Barbelune&quot;, died at the age of four after a long and painful illness.
* Maria Teresa (18 October 1673 – 7 December 1675), called &quot;La Mannone&quot;, died at the age of two, less than two months before her parents&#x27; coronation. The death of their beloved daughter plunged the royal couple into deep despair, which is expressed in the letters written by the spouses during this period. Marie Casimire wrote in a letter to her husband: &quot;I&#x27;m so devastated by worry that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever recover. May God allow me to forget this.&quot; During this time, Marie Casimire was herself ill, suffering from serious coughing, fainting, and fever. 
* Daughter (October 1674), stillborn or died shortly after birth.
* Teresa Kunegunda (4 March 1676 – 10 March 1730), married Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria and had issue.
* Aleksander Benedykt (6 September 1677 – 19 November 1714), died unmarried.
* Daughter (13 November 1678), stillborn or died shortly after birth.
* Konstanty Władysław (1 May 1680 – 28 February 1726), married Maria Józefa Wessel but had no issue.
* Jan (4 June 1683 – 1 January/12 April 1685), died at the age of one.
* Daughter (20 December 1684), stillborn or died shortly after birth.

Marie Casimire also had at least one miscarriage at the turn of 1681 and 1682.

<doc id="1191901" wikidata="Q241472" url="?curid=1191901" title="Forever Your Girl">
<text>Forever Your Girl is the debut studio album by American singer Paula Abdul. It was released on June 13, 1988, through Virgin Records. The album was Abdul&#x27;s breakthrough into the music industry after being a choreographer for high-profile clients including the California Raisins, George Michael, ZZ Top, Duran Duran and most notably Janet Jackson. At the time of the album&#x27;s release it was the most successful debut album of all time and was the first time that a female artist scored four US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one singles from a debut album. It is currently certified 7× platinum by the RIAA.

== Background ==
In 1987, Abdul, who had built up her professional reputation as a choreographer for the Los Angeles Lakers and high-profile artists including George Michael, ZZ Top, Duran Duran and most notably Janet Jackson, recorded a demo using her savings. Soon thereafter, she was signed to Virgin Records by Jeff Ayeroff, who had worked in marketing at A&amp;M Records with Janet Jackson. Although she was a skilled dancer and choreographer, Abdul&#x27;s vocal abilities were unimpressive, and with Ayeroff&#x27;s support, she underwent training until her singing range was rated mezzo-soprano. Ayeroff recalled signing Abdul to a recording contract years later, stating: &quot;She said, &#x27;I can sing, you know. I want to do an album.&#x27; Paula&#x27;s in our industry. Here&#x27;s someone with a personality and she&#x27;s gorgeous, and she can dance. If she can sing, she could be a star. So she went into the studio and cut a demo record and she could sing.&quot; The album was made on a budget of $72,000.

==Release and reception==

On October 7, 1989, 64 weeks after its July 23, 1988 debut on the chart, &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot; hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album sales chart, the longest an album has been on the market before hitting number one. The album was eventually certified seven times Platinum in the US by the RIAA and has sold over 12 million copies worldwide. It also includes four number one &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles: &quot;Straight Up&quot;, &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot;, &quot;Cold Hearted&quot;, and &quot;Opposites Attract&quot;, which places &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot; in a tie (with several other artists) for second most number-one songs from a single album, and ties it for the most number ones in a debut album. &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot; is also one of nine albums to have a minimum of four songs reach number one on the U.S. charts. She was the first female artist to have four number one singles from a debut album. &quot;The Way That You Love Me&quot; reached number three, and &quot;Knocked Out&quot; reached number 41.

The album also reached number four on the R&amp;B album chart, while &quot;Straight Up&quot;, &quot;Opposites Attract&quot;, &quot;Knocked Out&quot;, and &quot;(It&#x27;s Just) The Way That You Love Me&quot; all reached the top 10 of the R&amp;B tracks chart.

After a slow start, the album&#x27;s third single &quot;Straight Up&quot; helped the album breakout in spring/summer 1989 after its initial summer 1988 release. &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot; hit number one for the first time on October 7, 1989. After the release of the single &quot;Opposites Attract&quot;, the album shot to number one again on February 3, 1990, and stayed there for nine consecutive weeks.

By 1998, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine reported that &quot;Forever Your Girl&quot; was the most successful album released by the Virgin Records label, with all five of its top 20 hits also appearing on the same chart ranking Virgin&#x27;s singles.

The &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; called the album &quot;a fine starmaker vehicle&quot;, stating that Abdul &quot;applies a come-hither whisper to a likable batch of melodies... What&#x27;s frustrating is that Abdul&#x27;s voice is buried beneath bustling arrangements on tunes like &#x27;Opposites Attract&#x27; and &#x27;Knocked Out&#x27;.&quot;

<text>Tividale is a district of the Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell, West Midlands.

It straddles the borders of the towns of Dudley, Tipton, Oldbury.

== History ==
Tividale Park has been known as Derygate (Deer Gate) Park; it can be traced back as far as 1327 when Tividale was known as Derickton Cross.

Tividale was largely developed from the mid 19th century around the main road from Oldbury and Dudley, on the border of Dudley and Tipton. Coal mining and stone quarrying increased and canals were built across the area, and Tividale became a centre for industries such as iron and brick manufacture, and several terraced streets were built between Tividale Road and Tipton Road, as well as new houses being built along both of these roads.
Rattlechain Brickworks were opened in the 1890s on a site near Sedgley Road East, in the shadow of the New Main Line Canal which links Wolverhampton with Birmingham. Quarrying of land next to the brickworks led to a section of the Main Line Canal into the marl hole of the Brickworks in 1899, emptying out six miles of canal and causing thousands of pounds worth of damage, although nobody was injured. Another marl hole was created in 1948 and despite the subsequent closure and demolition of the brickworks, the marl hole remained in use as a disposal site for local factories, and is still known locally as Rattlechain Lagoon. Since the late 1990s, there has been growing local concern over Rattlechain Lagoon, with numerous dead birds being found at the site. Their death was linked to poisoning from chemicals disposed of in the water, which included white phosphorus. Nearby residents, including those of a housing development built in 2006, feared that the proximity of their homes to Rattlechain Lagoon could render them unsellable.

Tividale Tram workshops opened along the main Tividale Road (a tram route) in 1907 and operated until 1930. The tramway closed in 1939, as trams were phased out in favour of motorised buses.

The Birmingham New Road (linking Birmingham with Wolverhampton and also providing a direct road link with Dudley, Tipton, Sedgley, Coseley and Oldbury) opened in November 1927, dividing the Dudley and Tipton sections of Tividale, and was quickly followed by housing developments along the route and in the areas surrounding it.

Tividale began to expand rapidly soon after the completion of the Birmingham New Road, namely with the Grace Mary Estate, which was built by Dudley County Borough Council in the mid 1930s. After the Second World War, further housing developments, mostly by the local authority, saw these two housing estates effectively merged. Private houses began to spring up along the Birmingham New Road during the mid 1930s, and were followed soon afterwards by the Tividale Hall Estate, construction of which was halted around 1940 due to the war effort. Further council housing was built during the 1950s to link the Tividale Hall Estate with Oakham Road.

City Road Infant and Junior Schools (later renamed Oakham Primary School) opened in 1939, followed in 1953 by Tividale Hall Infant and Junior Schools, and around 1960 Grace Mary Primary School. Burnt Tree Primary School relocated to its current site in Hill Road during the 1960s.

There were several air raids on Tividale during the Second World War, including a landmine which on 12 August 1941 destroyed a pair of recently built semi-detached houses on Birch Crescent, killing a six-year-old girl in a house opposite, as well as three people in the two destroyed houses; a 49-year-old woman in a second, and a married couple in a third. Several more people were injured in Birch Crescent. The houses were later rebuilt in the same style, while several surrounding houses suffered damage from the impact of the bombing and were repaired.

On 19 November 1940, a landmine was dropped in City Road, devastating a section of council houses. Four houses were completely reduced to rubble and several others suffered severe damage. A total of 10 people died, including all five members of the Roberts family; 11-year-old Ada her 33-year-old mother Mary 37-year-old father Sidney, eight-year-old brother Geoffrey and nine-year-old brother Sidney junior. Samuel and Beatrice Millington, a married couple in their forties, also died at the scene; their 20-year-old son Samuel junior was pulled alive from the rubble but died in hospital from his injuries the next day. The only surviving member of the family was the youngest son, 17-year-old Sidney. Also killed were a 17-year-old man and five-year-old boy, both from different families. According to one source, the bodies of some of the nine people killed outright were never found and one victim&#x27;s body was reportedly blown into a nearby tree. Two residents of one badly damaged house escaped injury despite standing on the doorstep of his house when it was half demolished by the landmine. Several other people survived injuries in this attack. The wrecked houses were later rebuilt in the same style.

The Luftwaffe are believed to have targeted these areas of Tividale due to their proximity to the &quot;Big Bertha&quot; anti-aircraft gun which was located near City Road and had been erected at the beginning of the war in 1939 to tackle the impending threat of enemy bombers.

On 21 December 1940, the Boat Inn on Dudley Road East was struck by a stray anti-aircraft shell from &quot;Big Bertha&quot;, resulting in the deaths of 12 people who were attending a wedding reception there. A 15-year-old boy, along with his 26-year-old brother a 36-year-old woman, 28-year-old man, a married couple and a 38-year-old man died at the scene. A 16-year-old girl died just after arriving at hospital, as did a 19-year-old man. A 30-year-old woman died in hospital from her injuries the next day,
and a 19-year-old woman died in hospital from her injuries two days later, as did a 20-year-old woman. A 20-year-old man in a neighbouring house was also injured as a result of the explosion and died in hospital the next day. The Boat Inn was rebuilt several years afterwards but demolished in 2004.

A total of 27 people died as a result of air raids at Tividale during the Second World War, and dozens more were injured.

The Netherton Tunnel runs under Tividale. Evidence of the tunnel is shown by the &#x27;pepperpots&#x27; that can be seen near the site of the former Hangsmans Tree site and in Aston Road, Regent Road and Packwood Road on the Tividale Hall Estate.

Several quarries on the edge of the Tividale area were a source of stone known as the &#x27;Rowley Rag&#x27;. Turner&#x27;s Hill is the site of the only remaining quarry.

In 1966, most of Tividale became part of the Warley, although the section between Tividale Road and Burnt Tree was added to an expanded West Bromwich borough which took in the bulk of Tipton. Since 1974, it has been part of Sandwell Metropolitan Borough in the West Midlands county.

The Oakham Green housing estate was built around Oakham Road and Darby&#x27;s Hill Road in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with all of these houses being privately owned.

== Quarrying ==

On the southern and eastern slopes of Turner&#x27;s Hill, which straddles the border of Tividale and Rowley Regis, a huge quarry exposes the brown and grey igneous rock, called dolerite, which covers less than one square mile. It is one of the most distinctive minor regions within the Black Country. The dolerite can be seen as a building stone in the older cottages around Rowley Regis. The dark brown, shapeless rock was used to create walls around the windy fields on the summit of Turners Hill.

The use of the Rowley dolerite (known as Rowley Rag) as a building stone ceased over two centuries ago after bricks (made from the clays within the coal measures) became the universal building material of the Black Country. The rise of the quarry industry on a commercial scale dates from the 1820s; the hard smooth rock was used for the paving stones of new streets in Birmingham and the rapidly growing Black Country towns. Today the quarries serve as a source of road metal. Quarrying in other areas of Tividale, such as Darby&#x27;s Hill, Warren&#x27;s Hall and Blue Rock, has ceased; and the quarries are used for landfill. Only Turner&#x27;s Hill quarry remains.

== Housing ==
Housing estates around Tividale include Tividale Hall, Castle View, Grace Mary and Brades Hall.

Dudley Golf Course has existed at Oakham since the early 20th century, originally being split in two by the Oakham Road. In the mid 1960s, however, the section of the course on Darby&#x27;s Hill was sold and part of it was used to build a private housing estate known as Oakham Green. The roads on this estate are all named after golf courses; St Andrews Drive, Muirfield Crescent, Gleneagles Drive, Hoylake Drive, Sunningdale Drive, Birkdale Drive and Wentworth Drive.

Grace Mary was built in the 1930s between Oakham and the recently completed Birmingham New Road, mostly as council housing. Expansions took place in the 1950s to merge it into Tividale Hall.

Tividale Hall was developed as private housing during the mid-1930s to early 1940s and the final area around Pine Road immediately after the war in the Dudley section of Tividale, but was extended in the 1950s with council housing. Most of the roads in this area are named after trees, including Elm Terrace, Birch Crescent, Pine Road and Ash Terrace.

Brades Hall (not to be confused with nearby Brades Village in Oldbury) is situated in the north of Tividale off the A457 road between Tipton and Oldbury. The first development took place with private housing during the 1960s, with further private and council housing being added in the 1970s and 1980s. Further sections of private housing were added in 2006 and 2017. Most of the roads are named after former prime ministers and high-profile politicians; including Peel Way, Macdonald Close, Asquith Drive, Palmerston Drive, Gaitskell Terrace, Macmillan Close and Callaghan Drive.

Oakham Green was built around Oakham Road and Darby&#x27;s Hill Road in the late 1960s on part of Dudley Golf Course.

Castle View is an extension of Tividale Hall and was built during the 1970s, mostly as private housing, but also with several low-rise blocks of council flats. Most of the roads are named after castles; including Stokesay Close, Arundel Close, Clun Close and Pendennis Drive.

In the early 1990s, the area of Tipton around the Birmingham Canal - site of the Long established REVO factory until the late 1970s, was developed as a private housing estate called Tividale Quays.

Although located within the original Dudley and Tipton council areas, most of Tividale is classified within the Oldbury B69 postal district, with the remainder falling into Tipton DY4. All of it is within the borough of Sandwell. The area surrounding Elm Terrace and Trafalgar Road is often known locally as &quot;Lower Oakham.&quot;

== Religion ==
St Michael&#x27;s C of E Church, once the most prominent landmark in the village, was completed in 1878 on Tividale Road. Contributions to its costs were made by local industrialists and especially by the Earl of Dudley. The large, brick building became known as the &quot;Cathedral of the Black Country&quot; and earned a reputation for advanced Anglo-Catholicism early in its history. Several vicars became very well known and loved: one, Wynn Griffiths, is commemorated in a street name in the Tividale Quays development.

The growing parish produced two mission churches: one, St Augustine&#x27;s (a corrugated iron construction now demolished) on Oldbury Road and a second, Holy Cross, on the Grace Mary Estate to the west of the Birmingham New Road. The Parish Church was earmarked for demolition in 1982 after an inspection revealed that the buildings were riddled with damp and woodworm which would have been very expensive to remedy. It was decided to demolish the church and rebuild it, rather than improve the original building. Consequently, the church was demolished in 1984 and a new, smaller church was later opened in 1991, using what had been the substantial parish hall as its core. There is another church, Oakham Evangelical, sitting on the brow of the hill in City Road.

Tividale is home to a Sikh Temple (Gurdwara) called Gurdwara Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji. Guru Hargobind Sahib Ji was the Sixth &#x27;Teacher&#x27; (or in Punjabi Guru) of the Sikh Religion. The Gurdwara is the place of worship for Sikhs, the followers of Sikhism. A Gurdwara can be identified from a distance by a tall flagpole bearing the Nishan Sahib, the Sikh flag. There are estimated to be around 300 Sikhs currently living around Tividale.

Today, Tividale is also the home of the new Hindu Temple which is an exact replica of Tirupati Balaji Temple in Southern India.

== Education ==
The area has been served by a secondary school since 1956, when Tividale Comprehensive School opened in Lower City Road to serve the 11–18 age range, at the time being one of the first comprehensive schools in Britain. It was renamed Tividale High School in September 1997, and Tividale Community Arts College in 2005 before becoming Ormiston Sandwell Community Academy in September 2009.
Tividale Hall Primary School opened in Regent Road in 1953.

The closest higher education institution is the University of Wolverhampton.

==Manufacturing==
Vono beds set up business at Tividale in 1896 and remained present in the area for some 100 years afterwards, until relocating from their Groveland Road factory to a new site in Wednesbury during the 1990s.

== Public houses ==
The majority of Tividale&#x27;s pubs today are situated on Tividale Road and Dudley Road West near Tividale&#x27;s northern border. The Wonder, The Albion, The Plough and The George are all within walking distance of each other. The Wheatsheaf stands alone at the southern edge of the area on the junction of Turner&#x27;s Hill, Portway Hill, City Road and Oakham Road.

Since around the year 2000, numerous pubs, especially the housing estate-based establishments, have gone. The Hangman&#x27;s Tree (demolished 2007), Barley Mow (demolished 2010), Red Lion (demolished 2010), The Huntsman (converted into an Indian restaurant, the &#x27;Red Mango&#x27;), The Waggon &amp; Horses (now a branch of the Co-Operative food store) and the Cottage Spring no longer exist as pubs, if at all.

The Hangman&#x27;s Tree Public House was named after an elm tree that grew opposite the public house; it was said to have been used for at least one public execution in the 18th or 19th century. The elm tree contracted Dutch elm disease in the early 1970s and was later struck by lightning; Warley council had to take down the tree and all trace has now been removed.

== Governance ==

Tividale was historically divided between the boroughs of Dudley and Tipton, which meant that it was also divided between the counties of Worcestershire and Staffordshire. In 1966 most of it became part of the County Borough of Warley, and in 1974 it became part of Sandwell borough. The current Tividale ward covers the housing estates south of the A4123, while most of the former Tipton section of Tividale is in the Oldbury ward.
Elm terrace and Trafalgar road are sometimes referred to as lower Oakham

== Politics ==
Since 1997 Tividale has been in the parliamentary constituency of West Bromwich West, prior to this it was in Warley West which was abolished for that election. A notable MP for the latter constituency was the former Solicitor General Peter Archer. The first MP for Tividale in its present seat was the then-Speaker of the House Betty Boothroyd. Its present member, since December 2019 is Shaun Bailey. of the Conservative Party.

== Sport ==
Tividale Football Club play in the West Midlands (Regional) League Premier Division. Their ground, The Beeches, is located on Packwood Road and was built during the 1970s.

<doc id="1191914" wikidata="Q1879714" url="?curid=1191914" title="Holwick">
<text>Holwick is a hamlet and civil parish in Teesdale, County Durham (district), England. Located in the Pennine hills, the hamlet consists of a few houses spread along a road in the pattern of a linear settlement. The population of the parish taken at the 2021 Census was 75.

Being south of the River Tees, Holwick lies within the historic boundaries of the North Riding of Yorkshire. Along with the rest of the former Startforth Rural District it was transferred to County Durham for administrative and ceremonial purposes on 1 April 1974, under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972. In May 2013, the newly registered flag of the North Riding was first unveiled at the village, owing to its being one of the most northerly settlements in Yorkshire.

It has a public house, the &quot;Strathmore Arms&quot;, named after local landowner, Lord Strathmore, who owned Holwick Hall. New York businessman Harry Payne Whitney leased Holwick Hall for a grouse shooting party on the moors in 1911, while in 1923 the future King George VI and Queen Elizabeth holidayed at the hall.

== Geography ==
Holwick sits not far from the south bank of the River Tees, about 2 miles north-west of Middleton-in-Teesdale and opposite Newbiggin, both villages on the other side of the river. The village itself is situated along Holwick Beck, a tributary of the Tees. The Tees forms almost all the northern parish boundary; the River Lune its eastern and Blea Beck its western. Bleabeck Force is a series of waterfalls along Blea Beck before it joins the Tees opposite Force Garth Quarry. Nearby are the High Force and Low Force waterfalls. The surrounding landscape is high moorland and fells.

==History==
The earliest evidence of habitation in the area comes from Mesolithic microliths dating back at least 6000 years. The people who left them, however, were not settled in the area, but hunted there during the summer. Agriculture began in the Neolithic period, and the remains of a Bronze Age hut circle and burial cairns are on Holwick Fell. Evidence of a native settlement in Roman times in the form of groups of circular huts and field system has been found west of the Wynch Bridge. The present-day village of Holwick was first recorded in 1235. The origin of the name is uncertain, but believed to mean either &quot;dairy farm in a hollow&quot; or &quot;in the holly&quot;. In addition to hill farming of sheep, lead mining and iron smelting was conducted in the mediæval period, with lead mining and stone quarrying increasing in importance throughout Teesdale in the 18th century. The Wynch Bridge, thought to be the first suspension bridge in Britain, was built across the Tees near Holwick in 1704, and collapsed in 1802, killing one. It was repaired but finally replaced in 1830. A map of the area surveyed in 1854 notes a chapel of ease and school as well as a Primitive Methodist chapel. There are also wells, a pinfold, and two foot bridges over Holwick Beck. The surrounding area contains numerous sheep pastures as well as several limestone and sandstone quarries and lead mines. The names of nearby farms include Cross House, Pikestone House, Castle House, Mizzes House, Mire House, Hield House, Westclose House, Low Way, and Hungry. Substantial quarrying and lead mining did not continue into the 20th century, and the economy of the village has since returned to sheep farming.

==Administration==
Holwick has a parish meeting rather than a parish council, owing to its small electorate. 

The parish falls within the Barnard West electoral division of County Durham district and Bishop Auckland UK Parliament constituency.

The local police force is Durham Constabulary. Holwick is in the Wear and Tees division and its nearest police station is in Barnard Castle.

<text>Ali Adnan Menderes (; 1899 – 17 September 1961) was a Turkish politician who served as Prime Minister of Turkey between 1950 and 1960. He was one of the founders of the Democrat Party (DP) in 1946, the fourth legal opposition party of Turkey. He was tried and hanged under the military junta after the 1960 coup d&#x27;état, along with two other cabinet members, Fatin Rüştü Zorlu and Hasan Polatkan. One of the accusations brought against him was of him ordering the Istanbul pogrom against citizens of Greek ethnicity. He was the last Turkish political leader to be executed after a military coup and is also one of the four political leaders of the Turkish Republic, along with Kemal Atatürk, Süleyman Demirel and Turgut Özal, to have had a mausoleum built in his honour.

==Early life and career==
Adnan Menderes was born in 1899 in Koçarlı, Aydın Province, as a son of a wealthy landowner of Crimean Tatar origin. After primary school, Menderes attended the American College in İzmir. He fought against the invading Greek army during the Turkish War of Independence and was awarded a medal of honour. He graduated from the Law School of Ankara University. In 1930, Adnan Menderes organized a branch of the short-lived Liberal Republican Party (Turkish: &quot;Serbest Cumhuriyet Fırkası&quot;) in Aydın. After the party dissolved itself, he was invited by Atatürk himself to join the ruling Republican People&#x27;s Party and was selected by the party leaders as a deputy of Aydın in 1931. In 1945, he was expelled from the party with two other colleagues due to inner-party opposition to the nationalization policies of İsmet İnönü.

== Rise to power ==

In June 1945, Menderes, together with Celâl Bayar, Fuat Köprülü and Refik Koraltan demanded more political and democratic freedom in their Motion with four signatures. The motion was not approved by any member of the Turkish parliament except for the four who brought the motion to parliament, and by September 1945, Menderes, Köprülü and Koraltan were all stripped of their membership of the CHP due to their opposition to the Turkish government. Bayar then resigned from parliament and later also the party. On 7 January 1946, the four formed the Democratic Party (DP) and in the 1946 elections Menderes was elected deputy of the Democratic Party representing Kütahya. When the DP won 52% of the votes in the first free elections in Turkish history on 14 May 1950 in which votes were cast in secret and counted openly, Menderes became prime minister, and in 1955 he also assumed the duties of foreign minister. He later won two more free elections, one in 1954 and the other in 1957.

During the 10 years of his term as prime minister, the Turkish economy was growing at a rate of 9% per annum. He supported an eventual military alliance with the Western Bloc and during his tenure, Turkey participated in the Korean War, and was admitted to the NATO in 1952. With the economic support of the United States via the Marshall Plan, agriculture was mechanized; and transport, energy, education, health care, insurance and banking progressed.

Other historical accounts highlight the economic crisis in the mid-1950s, during Menderes&#x27;s term, which saw Turkey&#x27;s economy contract with an 11% GDP per capita decrease in 1954, as one of the reasons for the government&#x27;s orchestration of the Istanbul pogrom against the Greek ethnic minority.

==Istanbul pogrom==

In 1955, the Menderes government is believed to have orchestrated the Istanbul pogrom, which targeted the city&#x27;s substantial Greek ethnic minority. In September 1955 a bomb exploded close to the Turkish consulate in Greece&#x27;s second-largest city, Thessaloniki, also damaging the Atatürk Museum, site of Atatürk&#x27;s birthplace. The damage to the house was minimal, with some broken windows. In retaliation, in Istanbul thousands of shops, houses, churches and even graves belonging to members of the ethnic Greek minority were destroyed within a few hours, over a dozen people were killed and many more injured.

The ongoing struggle between Turkey and Greece over control of Cyprus, and Cypriot intercommunal violence, formed part of the backdrop to the pogrom. The United Kingdom invited Turkey and Greece to a conference in London, which started on 26 August 1955. The day before the Tripartite London Conference (29 August – 7 September 1955) began, Menderes claimed that Greek Cypriots were planning a massacre of Turkish Cypriots. Seeing the opportunity to extricate Britain, Prime Minister Anthony Eden advised the Turkish delegates that they should be stern. Foreign Minister Fatin Rüştü Zorlu paid heed to Eden and launched a harsh opening salvo, stating that Turkey would reconsider its commitment to the Treaty of Lausanne unless Greece reconsidered its position on Cyprus. The Greek delegates, surprised by the harshness of the speech, held the British responsible for the change in Turkish attitudes.

Deflecting domestic attention to Cyprus was politically convenient for the Menderes government, which was suffering from an ailing economy. Although a minority, the Greek population played a prominent role in the city&#x27;s business life, making it a convenient scapegoat during the economic crisis in the mid-1950s. The DP responded first with inflationary policies, then when that failed, with authoritarianism and populism. DP&#x27;s policies also introduced rural-urban mobility, which exposed some of the rural population to the lifestyles of the urban minorities. The three chief destinations were the largest three cities: Istanbul, Ankara, and İzmir. Between 1945 and 1955, the population of Istanbul increased from 1 million to about 1.6 million. Many of these new residents found themselves in shanty towns (), and constituted a prime target for populist policies.

Finally, the conference fell apart on 6 September, the first day the subject of Cyprus would be broached at the conference, when news broke of the bombing in Thessaloniki.

The 1961 Yassıada trials after the 1960 coup d&#x27;état accused Menderes and Foreign Minister Fatin Rüştü Zorlu of planning the riots, finding that the supposed assault was in fact a provocation organised by the Menderes government, which planted the bomb in Thessaloniki and also bussed infuriated villagers from Anatolia into Istanbul with the aim of &quot;punishing&quot; Greeks. Menderes subsequently apologized and offered compensation to those affected.

==Plane crash survival==

On 17 February 1959, the Turkish Airlines aircraft Vickers Viscount Type 793, registration TC-SEV, carrying Adnan Menderes and a party of government officials on a flight from Istanbul to London Gatwick Airport crashed a few miles short of the runway, near Rusper, Sussex, in heavy fog and caught fire. Nine of the sixteen passengers and five of the eight crew lost their lives. Menderes, sitting in the back part of the plane, survived the accident almost uninjured and was hospitalized at the London Clinic 90 minutes after receiving first aid from Margaret Bailey, a local resident who rushed to the crash site.

He was on his way to sign the London Agreements on the Cyprus issue with British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan and Greek Prime Minister Constantine Karamanlis, which gave the three sides the right to intervene in Cyprus in case peace is broken by any of the parties.

Menderes signed the London Agreement on 19 February 1959 in the hospital. He returned home on 26 February 1959 and was welcomed by even his arch-rival İsmet İnönü and a large crowd.

==Political style and beliefs==

Menderes became quite famous for selling or distributing most of the estate he had inherited to small shareholders. He was more tolerant towards traditional lifestyles and different forms of practice of Islam than Atatürk and his party had been – he campaigned in the 1950 elections on the platform of legalizing the Arabic Islamic call to prayer (&quot;adhan&quot;), which had been banned in order to extirpate Arabic influences. He opened thousands of mosques across the country and as such, he was blamed by his political opponents for using religion as a tool for political gain. One of his first political moves was to exclude the pictures of İsmet İnönü on Turkish banknotes and stamps and instead put Atatürk pictures back, which were taken off when Inönü became president in 1938. Thanks to the public support and the legacy of Atatürk, it was a successful move, even if the Turkish law under the former president stated that the image of the president of the country would be placed on the banknotes (in this case Celâl Bayar). In one of his speeches, he said that members of parliament could bring back the caliphate if they so desired.
While remaining pro-Western, he was more active than his predecessors in building relations with Muslim states. Menderes had a more liberal economic policy than earlier prime ministers, and allowed more private enterprise. In general, his economic policies of high agricultural spending, especially in infrastructure meant that the peasants of Turkey appreciated his premiership.

He was most intolerant towards criticism, so he instituted press censorship and had journalists arrested, as well as attempting to oppress the opposing political parties and take institutions such as universities under his control. Menderes who was well liked by the people in general and also had the support of the Army Chief of Staff General Cemal Gürsel who, in a personal patriotic memorandum, had advocated that Menderes should become the president of the republic to secure the national unity, became increasingly unpopular among the intellectuals, university students and a group of radical young officers in the military, who feared that Kemalist ideology was in danger.

The most important event that brought his fall from power was probably the establishment of Commission of Inquiries (Turkish: &quot;Tahkikat Komisyonu&quot;). The commission, composed only of Democratic Party MPs and bestowed those MPs with the powers of public and military prosecutors along with the right to give a verdict. This was against the principle of separation of powers and gave the MPs the power to both prosecute and judge. Furthermore, the commission&#x27;s verdicts could not be taken to the appeal courts.

==Coup, trial, and execution==
A military coup on 27 May 1960, organized by 37 &quot;young officers&quot;, deposed the government, and Menderes was arrested along with Bayar and all the leading party members. They were charged with violating the constitution, and embezzling money from state funds, and ordering the Istanbul pogrom, in which dozens of Greeks were killed.

Menderes and other leading figures of the DP were put on trial by a military court on the island of Yassıada, see Yassıada trials. Along with Bayar and two former cabinet ministers, Menderes was sentenced to death. He delayed his execution with a suicide attempt by taking an overdose of sleeping pills. Despite pleas for forgiveness by Head of State Cemal Gürsel and even from İsmet İnönü, in addition to similar pleas from several world leaders, including John F. Kennedy and Queen Elizabeth II, Menderes was executed by the junta at the gallows on the island of İmralı on 17 September 1961. The sentence of ex-President Bayar was commuted to imprisonment.

Two months later, İsmet İnönü formed a new government under military tutelage, in coalition and with the help of the newly emerging Justice Party (Turkish: &quot;Adalet Partisi&quot;), after these two major parties among themselves took the majority of the votes in 1961 elections. Adalet Partisi, the successor of the heritage of Menderes, would win victories in later elections especially under the leadership of Süleyman Demirel.

== Legacy ==
On 17 September 1990, the 29th anniversary of Menderes&#x27; execution, he was posthumously pardoned by the Turkish Parliament and his grave was moved to a mausoleum named after him in Istanbul. Fatin Rüştü Zorlu and Hasan Polatkan, who were the foreign affairs minister and finance minister, respectively in the last Menderes administration, and who were hanged with Menderes by the junta in 1961, were also posthumously cleared of any misconduct. Adnan Menderes University in Aydın and Adnan Menderes Airport in İzmir are named after him. Two high schools, Istanbul Bahcelievler Adnan Menderes Anadolu Lisesi and Aydın Adnan Menderes Anadolu Lisesi, also adopted his name. There are numerous city districts, boulevards and streets named after him by city councils in cities large and small, all across Turkey.

In 2006, Mehmet Feyyat, the attorney general of Istanbul at the time, suggested that &quot;İsmet İnönü and Cemal Gürsel placed phone calls to the prison&#x27;s administration to halt Menderes&#x27; execution, but the Communications Office of the junta cut off the lines.&quot;

In March 2023, a monument to Adnan Menderes was unveiled at the Akhmet Yassawi International Kazakh-Turkish University in Turkistan.

==Film and television==
* The last period of Menderes&#x27; life beginning with his 1959 aircraft crash survival until his execution was depicted in the television series &quot;Hatırla Sevgili&quot; () as background events.

He was played by actor Mehmet Aslantuğ.

<text>Yenta or Yente () is a Yiddish woman&#x27;s given name. It is a variant form of the name Yentl (), which ultimately is thought to be derived from the Italian word &quot;gentile&quot;, meaning &#x27;noble&#x27; or &#x27;refined&#x27;. The name has entered American English only in the form yenta in the senses of &quot;meddler, busybody, blabbermouth, gossip&quot; and is not only used to refer to women. Both the forms &quot;yenta&quot; and &quot;yente&quot; are used in Yinglish (Jewish varieties of English) to refer to someone who is a gossip or a busybody.

The use of &quot;yenta&quot; as a word for &#x27;busybody&#x27; originated in the age of Yiddish theatre. During and after World War I, Yiddish-language discs recorded in New York by theatre actors such as Clara Gold and Gus Goldstein portrayed the characters Mendel and Yente Telebende and sold so well that dozens of copycat recordings were made. The popularity continued in the 1920s and 1930s as the humorist Jacob Adler, writing under the pen name B. Kovner for &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot;, wrote a series of comic sketches featuring the characters, with Yente as a &#x27;henpecking wife&#x27;. The popularity of the character led to the name developing its colloquial sense of &#x27;a gossip&#x27;.

There is a mistaken belief that the word for a Jewish matchmaker is &quot;yenta&quot; or &quot;yente&quot;. In reality a Jewish matchmaker is called a &quot;shadchan&quot; (שדכן). The origin of this error is the 1964 musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, in which a character named Yente serves as the matchmaker for the village of Anatevka.

<text>Jan &quot;Sobiepan&quot; Zamoyski (1627–1665) was a Polish nobleman (szlachcic) and magnate.

Jan was the 3rd Ordynat of the Zamość Ordynacja estates. He was General of Podolia from 1637, Krajczy of the Crown from 1653, Podczaszy of the Crown from 1655, voivode of Kijów Voivodeship (Kyiv, also Kiev) from 1658, voivode of Sandomierz Voivodeship from 1659, starost of Kałusz and Rostoki.

He married Marie Casimire Louise de la Grange d&#x27;Arquien on 3 March 1658 in Warsaw. In spite of their loveless marriage, they had four children, all of whom died in early childhood:

* Ludwika Maria (April 1659 – May 1659).
* Son (born and died January 1660).
* Katarzyna Barbara (5 December 1660 – December 1662).
* Daughter (May 1664 – August 1664).

Jan died on 2 April 1665, and his widow married her lover Jan Sobieski just over three months later, on 14 July of the same year. As Zamoyski had no surviving children, Ordynat of the Zamość Ordynacja estates eventually passed to his distant relative Marcin Zamoyski, who came from a younger branch of the family.

<doc id="1191936" wikidata="Q4941836" url="?curid=1191936" title="Bongard problem">
<text>A Bongard problem is a kind of puzzle invented by the Soviet computer scientist Mikhail Moiseevich Bongard (Михаил Моисеевич Бонгард, 1924–1971), probably in the mid-1960s. They were published in his 1967 book on pattern recognition. The objective is to spot the differences between the two sides. Bongard, in the introduction of the book (which deals with a number of topics including perceptrons) credits the ideas in it to a group including M. N. Vaintsvaig, V. V. Maksimov, and M. S. Smirnov.

==Overview==
The idea of a Bongard problem is to present two sets of relatively simple diagrams, say &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. All the diagrams from set &quot;A&quot; have a common factor or attribute, which is lacking in all the diagrams of set &quot;B&quot;. The problem is to find, or to formulate, convincingly, the common factor. The problems were popularised by their occurrence in the 1979 book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot; by Douglas Hofstadter, himself a composer of Bongard problems. According to Hofstadter, &quot;the skill of solving Bongard problems lies very close to the core of &#x27;pure&#x27; intelligence, if there is such a thing&quot;. 

=== In popular culture ===
Bongard problems form the heart of the game Zendo.

<doc id="1191941" wikidata="Q1851961" url="?curid=1191941" title="National Liberal Party (Lebanon)">
<text>The National Liberal Party (NLP, , &quot;Ḥizb Al-Waṭaniyyīn Al-Aḥrār&quot;) is a nationalist political party in Lebanon, established by President Camille Chamoun in 1958. It is now under the leadership of Camille Dory Chamoun, his grandson, who is the MP for the Maronite seat in Baabda, elected in the 2022 Lebanese parliamentary elections allied with the Lebanese Forces Party.

==Policies==
The party has adopted a hard line in regard to the preservation of Lebanese independence, and to the safeguard of the distinctive liberal practices in Lebanon with respect to freedom of expression and opinion and religious freedoms. Most Lebanese political parties have a sectarian basis; although the NLP during the civil war was mainly supported by Christians, the NLP is a non-sectarian, national, liberal, political party that adopted the Chamoun&#x27;ism (الفكر الشمعوني) that transcends sectarianism and has support among Lebanese citizens of different religions or sects.

==History==

=== Formation ===
While in England and the United States, Camille Chamoun developed an appreciation for political, economic, and social liberalism, particularly in the media. After his presidential career ended, he set up the National Liberal Party to represent his views. Politically, he was anti-French and pro-British, and strongly supported independent action. The ideology of the National Liberal Party was primarily focused on allegiance to Chamoun and support for Lebanese independence. It distinguished itself from other parties mainly by its support for democratic governance and a free enterprise system.

=== Early politics and the Lebanese civil war ===

In 1968, the party joined The Helf Alliance formed with the two other big mainly Christian parties in Lebanon: the Kataeb of Pierre Gemayel, and National Bloc of Raymond Eddé. During the Lebanese Civil War of 1975–90, the NLP was aligned with the mainly Maronite Christian alliance who fought the Lebanese National Movement (LNM). It had its own armed militia, the Tigers. In 1976, the NLP joined with the Kataeb Party (Phalange) and the Lebanese Renewal Party (LRP) to form the Lebanese Front, a political coalition. This was paralleled by the joining of the militias under a central command, the Lebanese Forces, headed by Phalange leader Bashir Gemayel. In 1980, Gemayel turned on the Tigers, and in a surprise attack in Safra eliminated the militia. The NLP has survived as a party, however. Nevertheless, with the death of Camille Chamoun in 1987 and the assassination of his successor and son Dany in 1990, combined with the rise of the Lebanese Forces as political party, it seems that the NLP&#x27;s political influence has considerably declined comparing to the 1960s and 1970s.

=== Modern politics ===
Following an ambush in Tabarja of a minibus carrying Syrian workers in which the driver was killed, 18 December 1996, and a number of attempted bombings, forty members of the NPL were detained by the security services. Some of those detained were later charged with offences such as having contacts with Israel, inciting Lebanese soldiers to disobey orders and “disturbing Lebanon’s relations with a friendly country”.

In 2005 the NLP was part of the Qornet Shehwan Gathering, opposed to the Syrian occupation of Lebanon, but later &quot;took a long break&quot; from activities in the March 14 Alliance but did not withdraw their membership.

During the 2022 Lebanese General election, Camille Dory Chamoun announced his candidacy along with two others in the districts of Matn, Baabda and Chouf, in alliance with Lebanese Forces Party and the PSP. On April 9, Chamoun participated in launching the list in Abadieh. On May 1, during the opening of its commission headquarters in Keserwan district headed by Chamoun, the party presented its electoral points, which included: sovereignty, positive impartiality, independence of the judiciary, expanded administrative decentralization, restoring confidence in the banking sector, and the return of refugees and displaced persons. The National Liberal Party was able to secure a single seat through Camille Chamoun in Baabda with 1,876 votes.

<text>Tomasz Zamoyski (1594 – 7 January 1638) was a Polish-Lithuanian nobleman (szlachcic) and magnate.

He travelled to London in July 1615 and was invited to hunt with King James at Theobalds. The master of ceremonies at the English court Lewis Lewknor hired two coaches with four horses each to bring Zamoyski to audiences with the King, Anne of Denmark, and Prince Charles.

Tomasz was the 2nd Ordynat of the Zamość estates. He was voivode of Podole Voivodeship in 1618, voivode of Kijów Voivodeship (Kyiv, also Kiev) in 1619, starost of Kraków in 1628, Deputy Chancellor of the Crown in 1635, as well as starost of Knyszyn, Sokal, Nowy Targ, Rabsztyn, Kałusz, Goniądz and Rzeczyce. The town of Tomaszów was named after him.

He married Katarzyna Ostrogska in 1620 and had three children with her.

<text>Glycated hemoglobin, also called glycohemoglobin, is a form of hemoglobin (Hb) that is chemically linked to a sugar. Most monosaccharides, including glucose, galactose, and fructose, spontaneously (that is, non-enzymatically) bond with hemoglobin when they are present in the bloodstream. However, glucose is only 21% as likely to do so as galactose and 13% as likely to do so as fructose, which may explain why glucose is used as the primary metabolic fuel in humans.

The formation of excess sugar-hemoglobin linkages indicates the presence of excessive sugar in the bloodstream and is an indicator of diabetes or other hormone diseases in high concentration . A1c is of particular interest because it is easy to detect. The process by which sugars attach to hemoglobin is called glycation and the reference system is based on HbA1c, defined as beta-N-1-deoxy fructosyl hemoglobin as component.

There are several ways to measure glycated hemoglobin, of which HbA1c (or simply A1c) is a standard single test. HbA1c is measured primarily to determine the three-month average blood sugar level and is used as a standard diagnostic test for evaluating the risk of complications of diabetes and as an assessment of glycemic control. The test is considered a three-month average because the average lifespan of a red blood cell is three to four months. Normal levels of glucose produce a normal amount of glycated hemoglobin. As the average amount of plasma glucose increases, the fraction of glycated hemoglobin increases in a predictable way. In diabetes, higher amounts of glycated hemoglobin, indicating higher of blood glucose levels, have been associated with cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy.

==Terminology==
Glycated hemoglobin is preferred over glycosylated hemoglobin to reflect the correct (non-enzymatic) process. Early literature often used &quot;glycosylated&quot; as it was unclear which process was involved until further research was performed. The terms are still sometimes used interchangeably in English-language literature.

The naming of HbA1c derives from hemoglobin type A being separated on cation exchange chromatography. The first fraction to separate, probably considered to be pure hemoglobin A, was designated HbA0, and the following fractions were designated HbA1a, HbA1b, and HbA1c, in their order of elution. Improved separation techniques have subsequently led to the isolation of more s.

==History==
Hemoglobin A1c was first separated from other forms of hemoglobin by Huisman and Meyering in 1958 using a chromatographic column. It was first characterized as a glycoprotein by Bookchin and Gallop in 1968. Its increase in diabetes was first described in 1969 by Samuel Rahbar &quot;et al.&quot; The reactions leading to its formation were characterized by Bunn and his coworkers in 1975.

The use of hemoglobin A1c for monitoring the degree of control of glucose metabolism in diabetic patients was proposed in 1976 by Anthony Cerami, Ronald Koenig, and coworkers.

==Damage mechanisms==
Glycated hemoglobin causes an increase of highly reactive free radicals inside blood cells, altering the properties of their cell membranes. This leads to blood cell aggregation and increased blood viscosity, which results in impaired blood flow.

Another way glycated hemoglobin causes damage is via inflammation, which results in atherosclerotic plaque (atheroma) formation. Free-radical build-up promotes the excitation of Fe2+-hemoglobin through into abnormal ferryl hemoglobin (Fe4+-Hb). Fe4+ is unstable and reacts with specific amino acids in hemoglobin to regain its Fe3+ oxidation state. Hemoglobin molecules clump together via cross-linking reactions, and these hemoglobin clumps (multimers) promote cell damage and the release of Fe4+-hemoglobin into the matrix of innermost layers (subendothelium) of arteries and veins. This results in increased permeability of interior surface (endothelium) of blood vessels and production of pro-inflammatory monocyte adhesion proteins, which promote macrophage accumulation in blood vessel surfaces, ultimately leading to harmful plaques in these vessels.

Highly glycated Hb-AGEs go through vascular smooth muscle layer and inactivate acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation, possibly through binding to nitric oxide (NO), preventing its normal function. NO is a potent vasodilator and also inhibits formation of plaque-promoting LDLs (sometimes called &quot;bad cholesterol&quot;) oxidized form.

This overall degradation of blood cells also releases heme from them. Loose heme can cause oxidation of endothelial and LDL proteins, which results in plaques.

==Principle in medical diagnostics==
Glycation of proteins is a frequent occurrence, but in the case of hemoglobin, a nonenzymatic condensation reaction occurs between glucose and the N-end of the beta chain. This reaction produces a Schiff base (, R=beta chain, CHR&#x27;=glucose-derived), which is itself converted to 1-deoxyfructose. This second conversion is an example of an Amadori rearrangement.

When blood glucose levels are high, glucose molecules attach to the hemoglobin in red blood cells. The longer hyperglycemia occurs in blood, the more glucose binds to hemoglobin in the red blood cells and the higher the glycated hemoglobin.

Once a hemoglobin molecule is glycated, it remains that way. A buildup of glycated hemoglobin within the red cell, therefore, reflects the average level of glucose to which the cell has been exposed during its life-cycle. Measuring glycated hemoglobin assesses the effectiveness of therapy by monitoring long-term serum glucose regulation.

A1c is a weighted average of blood glucose levels during the life of the red blood cells (117 days for men and 106 days in women). Therefore, glucose levels on days nearer to the test contribute substantially more to the level of A1c than the levels in days further from the test.

This is also supported by data from clinical practice showing that HbA1c levels improved significantly after 20 days from start or intensification of glucose-lowering treatment.

==Measurement==
Several techniques are used to measure hemoglobin A1c. Laboratories may use high-performance liquid chromatography, immunoassay, enzymatic assay, capillary electrophoresis, or boronate affinity chromatography. Point of care (e.g., doctor&#x27;s office) devices use immunoassay boronate affinity chromatography.

In the United States, HbA1c testing laboratories are certified by the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program to standardize them against the results of the 1993 Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT). An additional percentage scale, Mono S has previously been in use by Sweden and KO500 is in use in Japan.

===Switch to IFCC units===
The American Diabetes Association, European Association for the Study of Diabetes, and International Diabetes Federation have agreed that, in the future, HbA1c is to be reported in the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) units. IFCC reporting was introduced in Europe except for the UK in 2003; the UK carried out dual reporting from 1 June 2009 until 1 October 2011.

Conversion between DCCT and IFCC is by the following equation:

:formula_1

==Interpretation of results==
Laboratory results may differ depending on the analytical technique, the age of the subject, and biological variation among individuals. Higher levels of HbA1c are found in people with persistently elevated blood sugar, as in diabetes mellitus. While diabetic patient treatment goals vary, many include a target range of HbA1c values. A diabetic person with good glucose control has an HbA1c level that is close to or within the reference range.

The International Diabetes Federation and the American College of Endocrinology recommend HbA1c values below 48 mmol/mol (6.5 DCCT %), while the American Diabetes Association recommends HbA1c be below 53 mmol/mol (7.0 DCCT %) for most patients. Results from large trials in suggested that a target below 53 mmol/mol (7.0 DCCT %) for older adults with type 2 diabetes may be excessive: Below 53 mmol/mol, the health benefits of reduced A1c become smaller, and the intensive glycemic control required to reach this level leads to an increased rate of dangerous hypoglycemic episodes.

A retrospective study of 47,970 type 2 diabetes patients, aged 50 years and older, found that patients with an HbA1c more than 48 mmol/mol (6.5 DCCT %) had an increased mortality rate, but a later international study contradicted these findings.

A review of the UKPDS, Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD), Advance and Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trials (VADT) estimated that the risks of the main complications of diabetes (diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, diabetic neuropathy, and macrovascular disease) decreased by about 3% for every 1 mmol/mol decrease in HbA1c.

However, a trial by ACCORD designed specifically to determine whether reducing HbA1c below 42 mmol/mol (6.0 DCCT %) using increased amounts of medication would reduce the rate of cardiovascular events found higher mortality with this intensive therapy, so much so that the trial was terminated 17 months early.

Practitioners must consider patients&#x27; health, their risk of hypoglycemia, and their specific health risks when setting a target HbA1c level. Because patients are responsible for averting or responding to their own hypoglycemic episodes, their input and the doctors&#x27; assessments of the patients&#x27; self-care skills are also important.

Persistent elevations in blood sugar (and, therefore, HbA1c) increase the risk of long-term vascular complications of diabetes, such as coronary disease, heart attack, stroke, heart failure, kidney failure, blindness, erectile dysfunction, neuropathy (loss of sensation, especially in the feet), gangrene, and gastroparesis (slowed emptying of the stomach). Poor blood glucose control also increases the risk of short-term complications of surgery such as poor wound healing.

All-cause mortality is higher above 64 mmol/mol (8.0 DCCT%) HbA1c as well as below 42 mmol/mol (6.0 DCCT %) in diabetic patients, and above 42 mmol/mol (6.0 DCCT %) as well as below 31 mmol/mol (5.0 DCCT %) in non-diabetic persons, indicating the risks of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, respectively. Similar risk results are seen for cardiovascular disease.

The 2022 ADA guidelines reaffirmed the recommendation that HbA1c should be maintained below 7.0% for most patients. Higher target values are appropriate for children and adolescents, patients with extensive co-morbid illness and those with a history of severe hypoglycemia. More stringent targets (&lt;6.0%) are preferred for pregnant patients if this can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia.

=== Factors other than glucose that affect A1c ===
Lower-than-expected levels of HbA1c can be seen in people with shortened red blood cell lifespans, such as with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, sickle-cell disease, or any other condition causing premature red blood cell death. For these patients, alternate assessment with fructosamine or glycated albumin is recommended; these methods reflect glycemic control over the preceding 2-3 weeks. Blood donation will result in rapid replacement of lost RBCs with newly formed red blood cells. Since these new RBCs will have only existed for a short period of time, their presence will lead HbA1c to underestimate the actual average levels. There may also be distortions resulting from blood donation during the preceding two months, due to an abnormal synchronization of the age of the RBCs, resulting in an older than normal average blood cell life (resulting in an overestimate of actual average blood glucose levels). Conversely, higher-than-expected levels can be seen in people with a longer red blood cell lifespan, such as with iron deficiency.

Results can be unreliable in many circumstances, for example after blood loss, after surgery, blood transfusions, anemia, or high erythrocyte turnover; in the presence of chronic renal or liver disease; after administration of high-dose vitamin C; or erythropoetin treatment. Hypothyroidism can artificially raise the A1c. In general, the reference range (that found in healthy young persons), is about 30–33 mmol/mol (4.9–5.2 DCCT %). The mean HbA1c for diabetics type 1 in Sweden in 2014 was 63 mmol/mol (7.9 DCCT%) and for type 2, 61 mmol/mol (7.7 DCCT%). HbA1c levels show a small, but statistically significant, progressive uptick with age; the clinical importance of this increase is unclear.

=== Mapping from A1c to estimated average glucose ===
The approximate mapping between HbA1c values given in DCCT percentage (%) and eAG (estimated average glucose) measurements is given by the following equation:
:eAG(mg/dL) = 28.7 × A1C − 46.7&lt;br&gt;eAG(mmol/L) = 1.59 × A1C − 2.59&lt;br&gt;(Data in parentheses are 95% confidence intervals&gt;)

===Normal, prediabetic, and diabetic ranges===
The 2010 American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes added the HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol (≥6.5 DCCT %) as another criterion for the diagnosis of diabetes.
==Indications and uses==
Glycated hemoglobin testing is recommended for both checking the blood sugar control in people who might be prediabetic and monitoring blood sugar control in patients with more elevated levels, termed diabetes mellitus. For a single blood sample, it provides far more revealing information on glycemic behavior than a fasting blood sugar value. However, fasting blood sugar tests are crucial in making treatment decisions. The American Diabetes Association guidelines are similar to others in advising that the glycated hemoglobin test be performed at least twice a year in patients with diabetes who are meeting treatment goals (and who have stable glycemic control) and quarterly in patients with diabetes whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals.

Glycated hemoglobin measurement is not appropriate where a change in diet or treatment has been made within six weeks. Likewise, the test assumes a normal red blood cell aging process and mix of hemoglobin subtypes (predominantly HbA in normal adults). Hence, people with recent blood loss, hemolytic anemia, or genetic differences in the hemoglobin molecule (hemoglobinopathy) such as sickle-cell disease and other conditions, as well as those who have donated blood recently, are not suitable for this test.

Due to glycated hemoglobin&#x27;s variability (as shown in the table above), additional measures should be checked in patients at or near recommended goals. People with HbA1c values at 64 mmol/mol or less should be provided additional testing to determine whether the HbA1c values are due to averaging out high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) with low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) or the HbA1c is more reflective of an elevated blood glucose that does not vary much throughout the day. Devices such as continuous blood glucose monitoring allow people with diabetes to determine their blood glucose levels on a continuous basis, testing every few minutes. Continuous use of blood glucose monitors is becoming more common, and the devices are covered by many health insurance plans, including Medicare in the United States. The supplies tend to be expensive, since the sensors must be changed at least every 2 weeks. Another useful test in determining if HbA1c values are due to wide variations of blood glucose throughout the day is 1,5-anhydroglucitol, also known as GlycoMark. GlycoMark reflects only the times that the person experiences hyperglycemia above 180 mg/dL over a two-week period.

Concentrations of hemoglobin A1 (HbA1) are increased, both in diabetic patients and in patients with kidney failure, when measured by ion-exchange chromatography. The thiobarbituric acid method (a chemical method specific for the detection of glycation) shows that patients with kidney failure have values for glycated hemoglobin similar to those observed in normal subjects, suggesting that the high values in these patients are a result of binding of something other than glucose to hemoglobin.

In autoimmune hemolytic anemia, concentrations of HbA1 is undetectable. Administration of prednisolone will allow the HbA1 to be detected. The alternative fructosamine test may be used in these circumstances and it also reflects an average of blood glucose levels over the preceding 2 to 3 weeks.

All the major institutions such as the International Expert Committee Report, drawn from the International Diabetes Federation, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, and the American Diabetes Association, suggest the HbA1c level of 48 mmol/mol (6.5 DCCT %) as a diagnostic level. The Committee Report further states that, when HbA1c testing cannot be done, the fasting and glucose-tolerance tests be done. Screening for diabetes during pregnancy continues to require fasting and glucose-tolerance measurements for gestational diabetes at 24 to 28 weeks gestation, although glycated hemoglobin may be used for screening at the first prenatal visit.

==Modification by diet==
Meta-analysis has shown probiotics to cause a statistically significant reduction in glycated hemoglobin in type-2 diabetics. Trials with multiple strains of probiotics had statistically significant reductions in glycated hemoglobin, whereas trials with single strains did not.

==Standardization and traceability==
Most clinical studies recommend the use of HbA1c assays that are traceable to the DCCT assay. The National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) and IFCC have improved assay standardization. For initial diagnosis of diabetes, only HbA1c methods that are NGSP-certified should be used, not point-of-care testing devices. Analytical performance has been a problem with earlier point-of-care devices for HbA1c testing, specifically large standard deviations and negative bias.

==Veterinary medicine==
HbA1c testing has not been found useful in the monitoring during the treatment of cats and dogs with diabetes, and is not generally used; monitoring of fructosamine levels is favoured instead.

<doc id="1191957" wikidata="Q648081" url="?curid=1191957" title="Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway">
<text>The Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway was a railway company that operated in the U.S. states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia. It began as the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, chartered in Nashville on December 11, 1845, built to gauge and was the first railway to operate in the state of Tennessee.
By the turn of the twentieth century, the NC&amp;StL grew into one of the most important railway systems in the southern United States.

==History==
The Nashville &amp; Chattanooga Railway, predecessor to the NC&amp;StL Railway, was organized in 1848 by a group of prominent Nashville businessmen. The line&#x27;s first president was Vernon K. Stevenson, who was connected to wealth from the Grundy and Bass families of Nashville and was a vigorous promotor of a line between Nashville and Chattanooga; he would serve for 16 years. The first locomotive in Nashville arrived in December 1850 on the steamboat &quot;Beauty&quot; along with 13 freight cars and one passenger car. The train made its first trip the following spring: to Antioch, Tennessee. It took nine years to complete the of line between Nashville and Chattanooga, made difficult by the steep elevations of the Highland Rim and Cumberland Plateau between them. The Cowan Tunnel near Cowan, Tennessee, was considered an engineering marvel of the time. Due to terrain difficulties, the rail line crossed into Alabama and Georgia for short distances. Towns sprang up during construction, including Tullahoma and Estill Springs.

During the Civil War, the rail line was strategic to both the Union and Confederate armies. The Tennessee campaigns of 1862 and 1863 saw Union troops force the Confederates from Nashville all the way to Chattanooga, down the line of the railroad. The tracks and bridges were repeatedly damaged and repaired, and the rolling stock was largely destroyed. At different times the trains carried supplies for both armies. In 1885, the railroad successfully defended itself before the Supreme Court in &quot;Nashville, C. &amp; St. L. R. Co. v. United States&quot; from repaying postage payments for mail in 1861 that was not delivered because of the war.

After the war. the company purchased the Nashville and Northwestern Railroad and the Hickman and Obion Railroad to Hickman, Kentucky, to reach the Mississippi River. In 1873, it was reincorporated as the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway (NC&amp;StL); the company&#x27;s tracks never actually reached St. Louis, Missouri, in the north. In early 1877, the NC&amp;StL bought the bankrupt Tennessee and Pacific Railroad from the state government and operated it as a connection to Lebanon, Tennessee.

The company also took full control of the Duck River Valley Narrow Gauge Railway in 1888, converting it to standard gauge the following year. It had already leased the line, which linked Columbia, Lewisburg, and Fayetteville, Tennessee from its owners in 1879, when they had difficulty completing the final stretch into Fayetteville.

The railroad&#x27;s only heavy repair shops for locomotives and cars were located in Nashville, Tennessee. The first roundhouse and machine shop were built in 1850, which were expanded by Confederate troops during the Civil War. By 1888 the shops had become obsolete and inadequate, so they were moved to a larger tract of land two miles west, below Charlotte Avenue. The new shops featured a full-circle roundhouse and a dozen shop buildings served by two transfer tables.

The Louisville and Nashville Railroad, an aggressive competitor of the NC&amp;StL, gained a controlling interest in 1880 through a hostile stock takeover that caused much rancor between the cities of Nashville and Louisville.
However, the railroads continued to operate separately until finally merging in 1957. The company gave up steam operations in 1953. After the 1880 takeover, the NC&amp;StL acquired branch lines in Kentucky and Alabama, and expanded from Nashville to Memphis. In 1890 the tracks reached Atlanta, Georgia, by leasing the state-owned Western and Atlantic Railroad.

In 1902, the L&amp;N was acquired by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in a takeover similar to that of the NC&amp;StL, but continued to operate as a separate company. In 1982, the L&amp;N&#x27;s corporate existence ended when it was merged into ACL&#x27;s successor, the Seaboard System Railroad. After several other mergers, in 1986 the Seaboard System was renamed CSX Transportation, which continues to use the original NC&amp;StL route between Nashville, Chattanooga, and Atlanta. Other portions of the system, such as the route to Hickman, have been abandoned.

==Mileage and revenues==
At the end of 1925 NC&amp;StL operated 1,259 miles of road on 1,859 miles of track; at the end of 1956, mileages were 1,043 and 1,791.


==Passenger trains==
The railroad&#x27;s named passenger trains included:

*&quot;City of Memphis&quot; (Memphis - Nashville)
*&quot;Dixie Express&quot; (once the coach section of the all-Pullman &quot;Dixie Flyer&quot; and at another time the interim name of the &quot;Dixie Limited&quot;) (Chicago - New Orleans)
*&quot;Dixie Flyer&quot; (Chicago and St. Louis - Florida)
*&quot;Dixie Limited&quot; (formerly the &quot;Dixie Express&quot;, formerly the &quot;Chicago and Florida Limited&quot;) (Chicago and St. Louis - Florida)
*&quot;Dixieland&quot; (winter season only until the early 1950s) (Chicago and St. Louis - Florida)
*&quot;Dixiana&quot; (Chicago and St. Louis - Florida)
*&quot;Dixie Flagler&quot; (ran every third day; later renamed the &quot;Dixieland&quot;) (Chicago and St. Louis - Florida)
*&quot;Dixie Mail&quot; aka &quot;Dixie Flyer - Mail and Express&quot; (Chicago and St. Louis - Florida)
*&quot;Lookout&quot; (Memphis - Jackson, TN - Nashville - Chattanooga)

The railroad came to be advertised as the &quot;Dixie Line&quot;, beginning in the 1920s. The railroad also operated the &quot;Quickstep&quot; (name dropped before 1910, then known as Nos. 3 and 4), &quot;Georgian&quot;, &quot;City of Memphis&quot;, &quot;Volunteer&quot;, an unnamed night train (formerly the &quot;Memphis Limited&quot;), a Nashville-Hickman local, plus a through sleeping car from the &quot;Tennessean&quot; on Nos. 3 and 4, a Chicago-to-Augusta, Georgia, train. Another part of the train split at Chattanooga and continued as a Southern Railway operation through eastern Tennessee, and onward to Washington and the Northeast Corridor.

The railroad also operated unnamed trains between Nashville and Atlanta via Chattanooga, between Memphis and Paducah, Kentucky, between Dickson and Hohenwald, between Nashville and Hickman, Kentucky, via Union City, between Decherd and Huntsville, Alabama, and other short routes.

==Surviving equipment==
Two 4-4-0 locomotives from the NC&amp;StL&#x27;s predecessor road, the Western and Atlantic are on display in museums: The General and The Texas are in the Atlanta suburbs of Kennesaw and Buckhead.

In 1953, the NC&amp;StL donated its last steam engine, No. 576, to the city of Nashville. Originally known as a &quot;Yellow Jacket,&quot; the J3-57-class 4-8-4 locomotive was manufactured by the American Locomotive Company (&quot;Alco&quot;) in 1942. The NC&amp;StL referred to their 4-8-4s as &quot;Dixies&quot;, while most other railroads called them &quot;Northerns&quot;. It has been on display in Centennial Park since then. In 2016, the city of Nashville allowed the Nashville Steam Preservation Society to take out a 23-year renewable lease on the locomotive. The locomotive is currently at the Tennessee Central Railway Museum under restoration to working order and use for weekend excursion runs from downtown Nashville east to Watertown.

Two other NC&amp;StL steamers survive, 0-4-0Ts that used to work in the shops. They are stored in Taylorsville and are in either private ownership or abandoned. They appear to still have yellow-painted handrails.

In 2004, a former NC&amp;StL EMD GP7 diesel locomotive, No. 710, was restored to its original paint scheme by the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum. The TVRM also has the tail car from the city of Memphis on display at its Grand Junction Yard in Chattanooga.

In 2007, Huntsville terminal switcher No. 100, a former NC&amp;StL GE 44-ton Diesel (1950) was moved from Mt. Pleasant to the Cowan Railroad Museum in Cowan. Though subsequently an L&amp;N engine (number 3100), she was cosmetically restored to original scheme and number. In the process, the locomotive was found to be runnable. It is important as the first transistorized remote-control locomotive in the U.S. (converted in 1962).

<text>Antigone Costanda () (, born on 1934 in Nicosia, Cyprus) is an Cypriot-Egyptian designer, model and beauty queen who won Miss World 1954. The pageant took place on October 18, 1954, in London, England, with the participation of 16 contestants. In addition to Arabic, Costanda is fluent in Greek, English, Italian and French. The Cypriot-Egyptian beauty was the first Miss Egypt candidate to win the title of Miss World for Egypt.

According to Eric Morley&#x27;s 1967 book, &quot;The Miss World Story&quot;, Costanda was positively beaming as she claimed that her victory was also for the Miss World 1953 second runner-up status of Marina Papaelia, also from Egypt.

The following year, during the 1955 Miss World beauty pageant held in London, Costanda did not attend the event because of political hostilities between Egypt and Britain over the Suez Canal. British actress Eunice Gayson crowned Miss Venezuela, Susana Duijm, as the new Miss World.

Prior to winning Miss World, Costanda was gaining experience in the modelling profession and was appearing in numerous publications. Winning Miss World further helped her to reach the top of her profession, becoming a successful model in the Middle East, France, Italy and Greece. Her career in later years moved into interior design. She ran a company designing the interior of business buildings. She was one of the judges at the Miss Egypt 2006 contest.

<text>Monyane Moleleki (born 5 January 1951) is a Mosotho politician who served as a Deputy Prime Minister of Lesotho, as well as Minister of Parliamentary Affairs, from 2017 to 2020. As a leading figure in the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD), Moleleki was Minister of Natural Resources from 1993 to 1994, Minister of Information from 1996 to 1998, Minister of Natural Resources from 1998 to 2004, Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2004 to 2007, and Minister of Natural Resources from 2007 to 2012. After breaking with the LCD, Moleleki served as Deputy Leader of the Democratic Congress and was Minister of Police from 2015 to 2016. He left the Democratic Congress and launched a new party, the Alliance of Democrats, in 2017.

Moleleki has three children, named; Limpho Moleleki, Mohlomi Moleleki and Liepollo Moleleki, as well as two grand-children.

==Political career==
Appointed to the government as Minister of National Resources in 1993, Moleleki was briefly kidnapped along with three other ministers by soldiers on April 14, 1994; another minister, Deputy Prime Minister Selometsi Baholo, was killed in this incident. Police then went on strike in May 1994, and Moleleki resigned and left the country for Botswana, saying that he thought he was likely to be targeted for assassination next. In March 1995 he returned to Lesotho and was detained by members of the National Security Service on March 29. He was elected as Deputy Secretary General of the governing Basutoland Congress Party at a party conference in March 1996. In December 1996 he became Minister of Information and Broadcasting following the death of the previous minister, Pakane Khala, in November, and in June 1998 he was again appointed Minister of Natural Resources.

After serving for several years as Minister of Natural Resources, Moleleki became Minister of Foreign Affairs in November 2004 and served in that position until March 2007, when he became Minister of Natural Resources again.

He was said to have been shot and wounded in the arm in an attack at his home at night on January 29, 2006. 

Moleleki was viewed by some as a possible candidate to eventually take over from Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili. When Mosisili returned to office in 2015, this time as leader of the Democratic Congress, he appointed Moleleki, the party&#x27;s deputy leader, as Minister of Police.

Amidst reports that Moleleki was talking to opposition leader Tom Thabane about forming an alliance, Mosisili removed Moleleki from his post as Minister of Police in November 2016 and instead appointed him to a post in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. Later in the same month, Moleleki and Thabane announced an agreement to remove Mosisili and install Moleleki as prime minister. He was suspended from the Democratic Congress in December 2016 and launched a new party, the Alliance of Democrats, in January 2017. The new party and its allies defeated Mosisili in a vote of confidence on 1 March 2017 and proposed Moleleki as the new prime minister; however, Mosisili opted not to step aside and called an early election instead, despite an opposition effort to obstruct the move.

In the June 2017 parliamentary election, the parties opposed to Mosisili, including the Alliance of Democrats, won a majority of seats, and Tom Thabane became prime minister. Thabane&#x27;s cabinet was sworn in on 23 June 2017, including Moleleki as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Parliamentary Affairs.

He is also known as &quot;Mahaletere&quot; because of his halter-like beard and mustache.

He is famous for a short video clip, that went viral, where he continuously kept say “Leqe” during a press conference. He was describing to a journalist what should happen when international donas give Lesotho money, he insinuated that it should be “chowed” and after it is depleted ask for more. The phrase “Leqe Leqe” means to “spoil” yourself with money that was donated to the country. The viral video inspired a song by a Lesotho Rapper named Sep Dz.

<text>Sayyid Abdul Majid al-Musawi al-Khoei ( ; ; 16 August 1962 – 10 April 2003) was an Iraqi Shia cleric and the son of grand Ayatollah Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei.

==Life==

al-Khoei was born in Najaf. He lived and studied under his father in Najaf until 1991. During the Shia uprising of 1991 he took part in the fighting against Saddam&#x27;s Ba&#x27;ath Party but also acted as a force of moderation attempting to minimize revenge killings. When the uprising was crushed he was forced to leave Iraq. His father died a year later in 1992 at the age of 93, while still under house arrest in Iraq.

In exile in London, he worked for the al-Khoei Foundation, a charitable foundation set up by his father in 1989. He became its head in 1994 when his brother, Mohammed Taqi, was killed whilst driving back to Najaf from a visit to Kerbala.

He was a critic of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s rule: &quot;The regime&#x27;s criminal acts, beginning in 1968, have been never-ending. Executions, the closing of schools, mosques and shrines sacred to Shia worshipers; the burning of old religious scriptures; looting the sacred sites of gifts left by presidents and kings.&quot; He did, however, also call for unity. Speaking in December 2002, al-Khoei said, &quot;We are looking for a new Iraq in which everyone has a share... we want to forget the past and shake the hand of everyone&quot;.

==Assassination==
He returned to Iraq in April 2003 after the fall of Saddam despite being warned of the dangers. He arrived in Najaf on 3 April. Speaking to &quot;The Times&quot; upon his arrival to the city, he said everyone &quot;wanted news on Baghdad because they see that as the key test to whether this will be 1991 all over again.&quot; Though assigned protection, the protective unit could not follow him into the Imam Ali Shrine in Najaf on 10 April 2003. Here he was attacked and hacked to death by a mob.

According to witnesses, at the mosque he was walking with Haydar Al-Killidar Al-Rufaye, the custodian of the shrine under Saddam, and they were confronted by an angry mob, some of whom shouted &quot;Rufaye is back&quot; and others &quot;Long live al-Sadr&quot;. The mob killed Al-Rufaye with bayonets and knives; al-Khoei, who was critically injured by this time, was killed later.

Muqtada al-Sadr was suspected by U.S. and Iraqi authorities of ordering the assassination. He was later removed as a suspect after no evidence led to him attempting to assassinate al-Khoei.
