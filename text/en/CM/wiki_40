<text>The New Caledonia men&#x27;s national football team is the national team of New Caledonia and is controlled by the Fédération Calédonienne de Football. Although they were only admitted to FIFA in 2004, they have been participating in the OFC Nations Cup since its inception. They have been one of this relatively small region&#x27;s strongest teams, finishing second in 2008 and 2012, and third in 1973 and 1980. They were the top ranked OFC nation at number 95 in September 2008, making them only the fourth country from the confederation to have reached the global top 100.

==History==

The New Caledonian Football Federation, although created in 1928, did not join FIFA or the OFC until 2004, becoming the 205th member of the former.

Previously the New Caledonian selection, due to the attachment of local institutions to the French Football Federation, could only line up during friendly matches or regional competitions, such as the Pacific Games, as well as the Oceania Football Cup, but only as a guest.

The &quot;Cagous&quot; distinguished themselves during these competitions, winning the Pacific Games on several occasions, and finishing in third place, during the first two editions of the OFC Nations Cup.

After failing to qualify for the 2004 OFC Nations Cup, the New Caledonian Football Federation hired Didier Chambaron as the team&#x27;s new coach. During the 2007 South Pacific Games in Apia, the &quot;Cagous&quot; were placed in group A and won over their great rival Tahiti (1–0), this meeting was the first of the playoffs for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. They then won against Tuvalu and the Cook Islands (1–0) and (3–0). For their last group match, they draw against Fiji (1–1). The New Caledonians finished second in their group, and then beat the Solomon Islands (3–2), then in the final won the trophy against Fiji (1–0).

The Pacific Games football tournament serving as the first qualifying round for the World Cup in South Africa, the team found themselves qualified for the second round, where New Zealand blocked their way by taking first place. The &quot;Cagous&quot; however finish second in front of Fiji and Vanuatu.

In May 2011, the selection faced Reunion twice in Nouméa, matches counting for the preparation of the games of the islands of the Indian Ocean in the Seychelles of the Reunionese. The New Caledonians lost both matches. However, a few months later, during the 2011 Pacific Games, New Caledonia won in the final against the Solomon Islands, with the score of (2–0), after a victory against Tahiti (3–1).

In June 2012, on the occasion of the OFC Nations Cup, the &quot;Cagous&quot; succeeded in beating New Zealand in the semi-finals, with a score of 2–0 (goals from Bertrand Kai and Georges Gope-Fenepej), but failed in the final against their Tahitian rivals (1–0). Nevertheless, the competition serving as a second qualifying round for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, New Caledonia found itself, along with Tahiti and the semi-finalists New Zealand and the Solomon Islands qualified for the next round.

==Rivalries==

A historical sporting rivalry exists between the two French Pacific overseas collectivities, New Caledonia and Tahiti. They compete regularly in regional and, since 2006, international competitions. In 2012, Tahiti led the number of titles won (1 OFC Nations Cup, 5 gold medals at the South Pacific Games, 2 at the South Pacific mini-games, against 6 gold at the South Pacific Games for New Caledonia). As of their last match in 2018, out of the 62 matches played since 1953, the New Caledonia has 28 wins against 25 for Tahiti and 9 draws.

==Kit==
Givova are the current kit provider for the national team since 2022. As of 2012, the national team&#x27;s home kit is a grey jersey with red shorts and red socks. The away kit is a red jersey with red shorts and white socks.

<doc id="1206018" wikidata="Q6801406" url="?curid=1206018" title="McGowan v. Maryland">
<text>McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.S. 420 (1961), was a United States Supreme Court case that affirmed the Maryland State Supreme Court&#x27;s decision that the state&#x27;s Sunday closing laws did not have a religious purpose to aid religion and that the secular purpose of the legislation to set aside a day of rest and recreation did not violate the Establishment Clause.

==Background==
A large discount store in Anne Arundel County, Maryland was fined for selling goods on a Sunday, in violation of a local blue law. The Court rejected an establishment clause challenge to laws saying that most large-scale commercial enterprises remain closed on Sundays. The Court&#x27;s review of the history demonstrated that Sunday closing laws were originally efforts to promote church attendance. &quot;But, despite the strongly religious origin of these laws, non religious arguments for Sunday closing began to be heard more distinctly.&quot;

The Court said that the Constitution does not ban federal or state regulation of conduct whose reason or effect merely happens to coincide with the tenets of some or all religions. It concluded that, as currently written and administered, most Sunday closing laws are of a secular rather than religious character. They provide a uniform day of rest for all citizens. To say that the State cannot prescribe Sunday as a day of rest for these purposes solely because centuries ago such laws had their genesis in religion would give a constitutional interpretation of hostility to the public welfare rather than one of mere separation of church and state.

==Constitutional text==
The relevant clauses of the 1st and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution:

===The 1st Amendment===

:Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

===Section 1 of the 14th Amendment===

:All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

==The court&#x27;s decision==
The Court held that Maryland&#x27;s laws did not violate the First Amendment. 

Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Warren explained that the appellants did not have standing for their free exercise claim because they claimed only economic injury and their religious beliefs were not a matter of record.

Since the general rule is that &quot;a litigant may only assert his own constitutional rights or immunities,&quot; &quot;United States v. Raines&quot;, 362 U.S. 17, 22. we hold that appellants have no standing to raise this contention.&quot;

The Court found that appellants did have standing as taxpayers for their Establishment claim based on &quot;Everson v. Board of Education&quot;:

Appellants here concededly have suffered direct economic injury, allegedly due to the imposition on them of the Christian religion. We find that, in these circumstances, these appellants have standing to complain that the statutes are laws respecting an establishment of religion.

The Court also held that the law did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment. Chief Justice Warren again:

...the Court has [previously] held that the Fourteenth Amendment permits the States a wide scope of discretion in enacting laws which affect some groups of citizens differently than others. The constitutional safeguard is offended only if the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State&#x27;s objective. State legislatures are presumed to have acted within their constitutional power [even when], in practice, their laws result in some inequality.

In reaching their conclusion, the Court also examined the wider question of whether laws proscribing or limiting Sunday trading were constitutional. They held that such laws did not violate the division between church and state, because - no matter the historical roots of such laws - the laws existed as constituted in order to fulfill a secular objective. In other words, even if Sunday trading laws were originally intended to facilitate and encourage church attendance in the colonial United States, the laws as presently constituted were intended to improve the &quot;health, safety, recreation, and general well-being&quot; of citizens. The present purpose of the laws is to provide a uniform day of rest for all; the fact that this day is of particular significance for one or more religions does not bar the State from achieving its secular goals in this manner.

In a dissent, Justice Douglas argued that the Sunday closing laws were an attempt by the Protestant majority to impose its beliefs on the country. He wrote:

The Court picks and chooses language from various decisions to bolster its conclusion that these Sunday laws, in the modern setting, are &quot;civil regulations.&quot; No matter how much is written, no matter what is said, the parentage of these laws is the Fourth Commandment, and they serve and satisfy the religious predispositions of our Christian communities. (Also:) “The First Amendment commands government to have no interest in theology or ritual; it admonishes government to be interested in allowing religious freedom to flourish — whether the result is to produce Catholics, Jews, or Protestants, or to turn the people toward the path of Buddha, or to end in a predominantly Moslem nation, or to produce in the long run atheists or agnostics. On matters of this kind government must be neutral.”

<text>The Fleece Inn is a pub in Bretforton, in the Vale of Evesham, Worcestershire, England: the half-timbered building, over six hundred years old, has been a pub since 1848, and is now owned by the National Trust. The inn was extensively damaged by fire on 27 February 2004, and after repairs and rebuilding were completed the Fleece officially reopened on 18 June 2005.
The pub holds an annual asparagus festival and auction while there are three morris sides based at the pub: Pebworth, Belle d&#x27;Vain and Elemental. There is a regular folk night plus concerts and weddings in the medieval barn.

==History==
Owned by the National Trust, The Fleece Inn was originally built in the early 15th century as a longhouse (an early type of farmhouse accommodating both livestock and humans) by a prosperous yeoman farmer called Byrd. It later became a pub, which was rebuilt in the 17th century and remained in the Byrd family until 1977, when Lola Taplin bequeathed it to the National Trust. Lola was a direct descendant of Mr Byrd, and lived her entire life at the Fleece. She died at 77, having run the pub on her own for the last 30 years of her life. The Inn suffered serious fire damage after a fire broke out in the thatch in February 2004, and the business temporarily moved to a nearby barn during the 14 month long restoration.

Reputedly Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s pewter dinner service was exchanged on the way to the battle of Worcester and this is on display at the pub. Even if this account is not true, it is an example of 17th-century Jacobean English pewter ware.

A curious medieval tradition also survives at the Fleece, preserved in accordance with Lola&#x27;s wishes. This is the practice of chalking &quot;witch circles&quot; on the floor in front of each hearth to prevent witches from getting in through the chimneys. There are also &quot;witch marks&quot; on the inside of the door, to keep evil spirits out.

==Culture==

The BBC used The Fleece Inn and the surrounding village green for its 1994 production of Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;; the pub was renamed the &quot;Blue Dragon&quot; for the duration of shooting

<text>&quot;Black Perl&quot; is a code poem written using the Perl programming language. It was posted anonymously to Usenet on April 1, 1990, and is popular among Perl programmers as a piece of Perl poetry. Written in Perl 3, the poem is able to be executed as a program. 

&quot;Black Perl&quot; has been discussed in several scholarly works, and is considered an example of generative literature, a genre of electronic literature.

== Attribution ==
When posted to the codice_1 newsgroup the poem was attributed to &quot;a person who wishes to remain anonymous&quot;. Sharon Rauenzahn (née Hopkins), another Perl poet, has been suspected to be the author but has since denied the claim.

== Result of program execution ==
When executed, &quot;Black Perl&quot; exits on line one, upon reaching the function exit. The remaining lines are parsed by the Perl interpreter but never actually executed. The program produces no output.

Though it will not parse under Perl 5, multiple independent updates to &quot;Black Perl&quot; to make it parsable in Perl 5 have been published.

<doc id="1206045" wikidata="Q552328" url="?curid=1206045" title="Mannaea">
<text>Mannaea (, sometimes written as Mannea; Akkadian: &quot;Mannai&quot;, Biblical Hebrew: &quot;Minni&quot;, (מנּי)) was an ancient kingdom located in northwestern Iran, south of Lake Urmia, around the 10th to 7th centuries BCE. It neighbored Assyria and Urartu, as well as other small buffer states between the two, such as Musasir and Zikirta.

== Etymology of name ==
The name of Mannaea and its earliest recorded ruler Udaki were first mentioned in an inscription from the 30th year of the rule of Shalmaneser III (828 BC). The Assyrians usually called Manna the &quot;land of the Mannites&quot;, Manash, while the Urartians called it the land of Manna.

Describing the march of Salmanasar III in the 16th year (843 BC), it was reported that the king reached the land of Munna, occupying the interior of Zamua. However, the chronicle does not mention any march or taxation on the state of Mannaea. It is possible that the Assyrians either failed to conquer Mannaea, or advanced only to the border of Mannaea, and then changed course and marched on the neighboring country of Allarabia.

In the Bible (Jeremiah 51:27), Mannaea is called &quot;Minni&quot;, and is mentioned with Ararat and Ashkenaz as some of the future destroyers of neo-Babylon. &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; (1906), identified &quot;Minni&quot; with Armenia:

It can also relate to one of the regions of ancient Armenia, such as Manavasean (Minyas). Together with Ararat and Ashkenaz, this is probably the same Minni from the Assyrian inscriptions, corresponding to Mannea. The name &quot;Armenia&quot; has been theorized by some scholars as possibly deriving from &quot;ḪAR Minni,&quot; meaning, the “mountains of Minni.”

According to examinations of the place and personal names found in Assyrian and Urartian texts, the Mannaeans, or at least their rulers, spoke a non-Semitic and non-Indo-European language related to Urartian, with no modern language connections. However, after assessing the genetics of individuals found at Hasanlu Tepe, recent scholarship has suggested the possibility of the presence of Indo-Europeans, who perhaps spoke a language related to Armenian.

==Location==
Their kingdom was situated east and south of the Lake Urmia. Excavations that began in 1956 succeeded in uncovering Ziwiyeh and its branches the fortified city of Hasanlu, once thought to be a potential Mannaean site. More recently, another branch of Ziwiyeh, the site of Qalaichi has been linked to the Mannaeans based on a stela with this toponym found at the site.

After suffering several defeats at the hands of both Scythians and Assyrians, the remnants of the Mannaean populace were absorbed by the Matieni and the area became known as Matiene. It was then annexed by the Medes in about 609 BC.

==Ethnicity==
According to the Encyclopædia Iranica:

According to Robert H. Dyson, Jr.
After examining the genetics of individuals associated with Hasanlu Tepe during the Bronze and Iron Ages, Iosif Lazaridis et al. (2022) concluded the inhabitants of Hasanlu may have spoken a language related to Armenian, or perhaps a non-Indo-European language.

==History==
The Mannaean kingdom began to flourish around 850 BC. The Mannaeans were mainly a settled people, practicing irrigation and breeding cattle and horses. The capital was a fortified city called Izirtu (Zirta).

By the 820s BC, Manneaea had expanded to become a large state. By this time they had a prominent aristocracy as a ruling class, which somewhat limited the power of the king.

Beginning around 800 BC, the region became contested ground between Urartu, which built several forts on the territory of Mannaea, and Assyria. In the mid-8th century BC, during the open conflict between the Assyrians and the Urartians, Mannaea seized the opportunity to enlarge its holdings. The Mannaean kingdom reached the height of its power during the reign of Iranzu (c. 725–720 BC).

In 716 BC, king Sargon II of Assyria moved against Mannaea, where the ruler Mannaea, Aza, the son of Iranzu, had been deposed by Ullusunu with the help of the Urartians. Sargon took Izirtu, and stationed troops in Parsua (Parsua was distinct from Parsumash located further southeast in what is today known as Fars province in Iran.). The Assyrians thereafter used the area to breed, train and trade horses.

According to one Assyrian inscription, the Cimmerians (&quot;Gimirru&quot;) originally went forth from their homeland of &quot;Gamir&quot; or &quot;Uishdish&quot; in &quot;the midst of Mannai&quot; around this time. The Cimmerians first appear in the annals in the year 714 BC, when they apparently helped the Assyrians to defeat Urartu. Urartu chose to submit to the Assyrians, and together the two defeated the Cimmerians and thus kept them out of the Fertile Crescent. The Cimmerians again rebelled against Sargon by 705 BC, and he was killed while driving them out. By 679 BC the Cimmierians migrated to the east and west of Mannaea.

The Mannaeans are recorded as rebelling against Esarhaddon of Assyria in 676 BC, when they attempted to interrupt the horse trade between Assyria and its colony of Parsua.

The Mannaean king Ahsheri, who ruled until the 650s BC, continued to enlarge the territory of Mannaea, although paying tribute to Assyria. However, Mannaea suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the Assyrians around 660 BC, and subsequently an internal revolt broke out, continuing until Ahsheri&#x27;s death. Also in the 7th century BC, Mannaea was defeated by the advancing Scythians, who had already raided Urartu and been repelled by the Assyrians. This defeat contributed to the further break-up of the Mannaean kingdom.

Ahsheri&#x27;s successor, Ualli, as an ally of Assyria, took the side of the Assyrians against the Medes (&quot;Madai&quot;), who were at this point still based to the east along the southwest shore of the Caspian Sea and revolting against Assyrian domination. The Medes subjugated by Assyria. However, the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which had dominated the region for three hundred years, began to unravel, consumed by civil war after the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BC. The upheavals in Assyria allowed the Medes to free themselves from Assyrian vassalage and make themselves the major power in Iran. At the battle of Qablin in 616 BC, the Assyrian and Mannaean forces were defeated by Nabopolassar&#x27;s troops. This defeat laid open the frontiers of Mannaea, which fell under the control of Media between 615 BC and 611 BC.

<doc id="1206053" wikidata="Q1952542" url="?curid=1206053" title="Monster Movie (Can album)">
<text>Monster Movie is the debut studio album by German rock band Can, released in August 1969 by Music Factory and Liberty Records.

== Background and recording ==
In 1968, Can had recorded an album entitled &quot;Prepared to Meet Thy PNOOM&quot;, which no record company agreed to release; these recordings were eventually released in 1981 as &quot;Delay 1968&quot;. &quot;Monster Movie&quot; was the group&#x27;s subsequent attempt at a more commercial record. The album is credited to &quot;The Can&quot;, a name suggested by vocalist Malcolm Mooney and adopted by democratic vote. Previously the band had been known as &quot;Inner Space&quot;, which later became the name of their recording studio. Some copies of the LP bore the subtitle &quot;Made in a castle with better equipment&quot;, referring to Schloss Nörvenich, the 14th-century castle in Nörvenich, North Rhine-Westphalia, where the band recorded from 1968–69.

&quot;Monster Movie&quot; was mastered at Studio for Electronic Music (WDR) in Cologne by Can&#x27;s engineer Holger Czukay, the former student of Karlheinz Stockhausen.

===Artwork===
The image on the cover is a retrace of Galactus, as originally depicted by Jack Kirby (inked by Vince Colletta) in Marvel&#x27;s Thor #134 - page 3, released in 1966. The original sleeve art, produced by Music Factory and designed by artist Helge Bauch, features a large orange circle against a white background containing a printmaking drawing. The head of the Music Factory, Karlheinz Freynik, described the drawing as &quot;mystical from Greek myths that fits to the music&quot;. Rob Young, Can&#x27;s biographer, saw a naked old man on the drawing &quot;peering into what looks like the flaming portal of hell. He is surrounded by demons and a goat-headed man gnawing on a limb&quot;.

== Content ==
&quot;Monster Movie&quot; brings together elements of psychedelic rock, blues, free jazz, world music and other styles, the influence of the Velvet Underground being particularly obvious on the opening track &quot;Father Cannot Yell&quot;. The use of improvisation, experimentation, tape editing and layering of sounds set a standard for Can&#x27;s subsequent albums in the early 1970s, which helped form the style labeled &quot;krautrock&quot; by the British music press. The 20-minute closing track &quot;Yoo Doo Right&quot; was edited down from 6 hours of improvisation. The lyrics of &quot;Mary, Mary So Contrary&quot; are based on the English nursery rhyme &quot;Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary&quot;.

&quot;Monster Movie&quot; was the last Can album on which Malcolm Mooney performed all of the vocals until &quot;Rite Time&quot;, recorded in late 1986 and issued in 1989.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Monster Movie&quot; initially came out in late August 1969 on a small German label &quot;Music Factory&quot;. Kalle Freynik, the head of the label, as a part of his contract with the band had a goal to &quot;promote the product as good as the label can, and when there&#x27;s any reaction the label will try to get it on a major label&quot;. The initial pressing was five hundred copies, distributed by Freynik &quot;in carefully selected head shops and underground shops to boost the band&#x27;s reputation by word of mouth&quot;. The first pressing quickly sold out, and Freynik approached Liberty Records/United Artists signing a distribution deal for &quot;Monster Movie&quot;. Liberty&#x27;s issue released in May 1970 with an updated cover.

Richard Williams, writing for &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, identified the Velvet Underground influence on the album&#x27;s shorter tracks, but admitted &quot;they have a lot of themselves to offer, mainly in the field of electronics, which they use with sparing brilliance, and the interplay between the Morse-code organ and the machine-gun drums on &quot;You Do Right&quot; is extremely startling&quot;. Williams praised Malcolm&#x27;s performance—&quot;wailing and screaming fits perfectly where a less reticent singer would obtrude. In fact they use another of the Velvets&#x27; favourite tricks, putting the voice beneath the instruments so that it tantalises the listener unbearably.&quot;

The tip of the leaf is pointed, usually fairly sharply but sometimes with a blunt tip, particularly on slow-growing shoots on older trees. The cones are long and broad, with about 150–200 scales, each scale with an exserted bract and two winged seeds; they disintegrate when mature to release the seeds.

It is also closely related to Nordmann fir to the east in northern Turkey.

==Uses==
Greek fir was important in the past for wood for general construction, but it is too rare to be of significant value now. It is also grown as an ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, though in areas that often get late frosts it is prone to frost damage, as it is one of the first conifers to open fresh growth in spring.

== Etymology ==
The generic name Abies, already used by the Latins, could, according to an etymological interpretation, derive from the Greek word ἄβιος = long-lived. The specific name cephalonica derives from the Greek Cephallenia and refers to the largest of the Ionian islands, which falls within the range of the species.

== Description ==
=== Carriage ===
The Cephalonian fir has a conical shape, it rarely exceeds 25 m, even if it can reach 35 m. The branches are arranged in regular whorls and the small branches are shiny brown, close together and glabrous. Among the fir trees it is one of those with the thickest crown.

=== Leaves ===
They are 2-3 cm long, needle -like, prickly and bright green on the upper face; they have two silvery white streaks separated by a green vein below. They are arranged radially around the branches.

<text>The 2002 Olympic Winter Games bid scandal was a scandal involving allegations of bribery used to win the rights to host the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. Prior to its successful bid in 1995, the city had attempted four times to secure the games, failing each time. In 1998, members of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) were accused of taking gifts from the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) during the bidding process. The allegations resulted in the expulsion of several IOC members, and the adoption of new IOC rules. Although nothing strictly illegal had been done, it was felt that the acceptance of the gifts was morally dubious. Soon four independent investigations were underway: by the IOC, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), the SLOC, and the United States Department of Justice. Both Tom Welch and David Johnson resigned their posts as the head of the SLOC. Many others soon followed. The Department of Justice filed fifteen charges of bribery and fraud. Investigations were also launched into prior bidding process by other cities, finding that members of the IOC received gifts during the bidding process for both the 1998 Winter Olympics and 2000 Summer Olympics.

==Winning bid==
Ogden-born lawyer Tom Welch and a Utah Economic Development Professional, David Johnson, were in charge of the Salt Lake Bid Committee. From 1986 through 1995, they worked on supporting Salt Lake City&#x27;s bid in Europe, Latin America, and Africa, meeting with the IOC Members and International Sport organizations.

Despite their efforts, the 1998 Games went to Nagano, Japan, in a 46-to-42 vote. Many felt the reason was that the US had recently been awarded the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. Others, including Welch, believed it was because Nagano had better wined and dined the officials. A Salt Lake Olympic Bid Committee member complained about competing with the Japanese bid committee for the 1998 Olympic Winter Games: &quot;We were giving out saltwater taffy and cowboy hats, and they were giving out computers. IOC members who came to inspect Nagano were put up in ritzy hot spring resorts, where they washed down expensive sushi with sake poured by kimono-clad geisha. They went home laden with souvenir gifts and expensive paintings.&quot;

The Nagano Olympic bid committee had spent approximately $14 million on entertaining the 62 IOC Members and many of their companions. The precise figures are not known since Nagano destroyed the financial records after the IOC asked that the entertainment expenditures not be made public. The Melbourne bid committee for the 1996 Summer Olympics discovered the &quot;quid pro quo&quot; expectations of IOC delegates when they received requests from six African IOC delegates for new cars and sexual favors from local brothels. The requests were denied and the 1996 Summer Olympics went to Atlanta.

More than $16 million was spent on Utah&#x27;s Olympic bidding. The high costs related to bringing IOC Members to Salt Lake City to see the venues proposed for the Games. This was a priority for the Bid Committee and more than 70 of the 100 Members of the IOC personally visited the city at the Bid Committee&#x27;s expense. Community Leaders were fully behind the bid. Opportunities were created by Spencer Eccles, Salt Lake Olympic Bid Committee Executive Board Member, for IOC family members to be employed at First Security Corporation Bank. Jim Jardine, Legal Advisor to the Bid Committee, assisted the relatives of IOC Members in gaining admission to the University of Utah, and Intermountain Health Care made medical facilities and treatment available to IOC Members during their visits.

Jon Huntsman, a committee leader, hosted Juan Antonio Samaranch at his lavish Park City home and together with Tom Welch presented President Samaranch with a commemorative Browning Pistol.
In June 1995, 50,000 people gathered outside the Salt Lake City Mayor&#x27;s office to receive the result of the final announcement.

==Scandal==
Access to budget documents was routinely denied, Salt Lake City reporters say. In April 1998, the board attempted to safeguard its aura of secrecy by amending its bylaws to stipulate that any member providing the press with confidential information could be dismissed. Frank Joklik was president of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee.

The scandal broke on 24 November 1998, when a report came out showing a letter directed to a child of an IOC member indicating the SLOC was paying the child&#x27;s tuition. Swiss IOC member Marc Hodler, head of the coordination committee overseeing the organization of the 2002 games, made the accusation that a group of members of the IOC had taken bribes since the start of the bidding process in 1990 for the 1996 Olympic games. Soon, four independent investigations were underway, by the IOC, the USOC, the SLOC, and the United States Department of Justice.

Before any of the investigations could even get under way, both Welch and Johnson resigned their posts as the head of the SLOC. Many others soon followed, including Joklik in January 1999. The Department of Justice filed charges against the two: fifteen charges of bribery and fraud. Johnson and Welch were eventually acquitted of all criminal charges in December 2003. 

As part of the investigation, the IOC recommended expelling six IOC members, while continuing the investigation on several others. The six members were Agustin Arroyo of Ecuador, Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir of Sudan, Jean-Claude Ganga of the Republic of Congo, Lamine Keita of Mali, Charles Mukora of Kenya, Sergio Santander Fantini of Chile, and David Sikhulumi Sibandze of Swaziland, though Sibandze resigned during the investigation. Each person was accused of receiving money from the SLOC, either in direct payments, land purchase agreements, tuition assistance, political campaign donations or charitable donations for a local cause.

Ten members of the IOC were expelled and another ten were sanctioned. This was the first expulsion or sanction for corruption in the more than a century the IOC had existed. Although nothing strictly illegal had been done, it was felt that the acceptance of the gifts was morally dubious. Stricter rules were adopted for future bids, and ceilings were put into place as to how much IOC members could accept from bid cities. Additionally, new term and age limits were put into place for IOC membership, and fifteen former Olympic athletes were added to the committee.

In 2006, a report ordered by the Nagano region&#x27;s governor said the Japanese city provided millions of dollars in an &quot;illegitimate and excessive level of hospitality&quot; to IOC members, including US$4.4 million spent on entertainment alone.

==Aftermath==
Bain Capital founder and CEO Mitt Romney was brought in in February 1999 to head the SLOC. Romney aided in reorganizing the committee, renewed sponsor enthusiasm, and helped to begin fixing the budget, which at the time was short . The federal funding accounted for infrastructure improvements only. Romney&#x27;s successful leadership of the SLOC was seen as helpful to his future political career, in which he would go on to become the Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007, the 2012 Republican Presidential candidate, and a United States Senator from Utah from 2019 to 2025.

<text>Milton Abramowitz (19 February 1915 in Brooklyn, New York – 5 July 1958) was a Jewish American mathematician at the National Bureau of Standards who, with Irene Stegun, edited a classic book of mathematical tables called &quot;Handbook of Mathematical Functions&quot;, widely known as &quot;Abramowitz and Stegun&quot;. Abramowitz died of a heart attack in 1958, at which time the book was not yet completed but was well underway. Stegun took over management of the project and was able to finish the work by 1964, working under the direction of the NBS Chief of Numerical Analysis Philip J. Davis, who was also a contributor to the book.

The major work of producing reliable mathematical tables, as described above, was part of the WPA project of Franklin Roosevelt.

== Legacy ==
The Abramowitz Award is granted by the University of Maryland, College Park to students &quot;for superior competence and promise in the field of mathematics and its applications.&quot; Winners of this award include Charles Fefferman and Sergey Brin.

<text>John Henry George Devey (26 December 1866 – 11 October 1940) was an English football player and a first-class cricketer. He is considered one of Aston Villa&#x27;s greatest captains.

==Football career==
Devey was born in Birmingham and signed for Aston Villa in March 1891; A skilful inside right/centre-forward and an England international with two caps, he was exceptionally clever with head and feet in front of goal and a prolific goalscorer. He was Villa&#x27;s top goal scorer in 6 of his 12 seasons with the club.

For eight years, Devey captained Aston Villa during which time they won the League championship five times between 1894 and 1900 and the FA Cup twice. Including the famous &#x27;Double&#x27; in the 1896–97 season. 

In October 1896 Devey was awarded a benefit match against Derby County, after which he was presented with an illuminated address from the club with the following words: 

William McGregor said this about Devey: 

He retired as a player in April 1902 and was an Aston Villa director for the next 32 years, during which time he was actively involved with training and scouting new players.

==Cricket career==
Jack Devey was also a Warwickshire cricketer, first appearing for the county side in 1887, though matches were only rated as first-class from 1894. He was a right-handed batsman who batted in the middle order until around 1900, but then opened the innings until his final retirement from the game in 1907. He also bowled occasional right-arm medium pace.

==Professional baseball==

In 1890 Devey played professional baseball for Aston Villa in the National League of Baseball of Great Britain. He was a gifted two-way player player, who led the statistical categories at the end of the year, including being the league&#x27;s batting champion. Devey was inducted into the British Baseball Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Family==
He was one of five brothers who all played professional football, Ted and Will for Small Heath and John, Harry and Bob for Aston Villa. Another brother, Abel, was a cricketer with Staffordshire.

==Death==
Devey stood down as a Villa director in 1934. He died 11 October 1940. The pall bearers at his funeral were six former Villa players: Billy Walker, Richard York, Arthur Dorrell, Jimmy Gibson, George Brown and Frank Barson ― all old international players.

==Honours==

<text>Ren &amp; Stimpy &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot; is an American adult animated comedy television series created by John Kricfalusi and produced by Spümcø for TNN / Spike TV. The series was developed as a more &quot;extreme&quot; revamp and spin-off of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, whose first two seasons were produced by Spümcø.

The series premiered on June 26, 2003, and was removed from the network on July 24, after airing only three episodes; the remaining episodes were released on DVD. During its short run, &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot; was heavily panned by critics, audiences and fans of the original series. It has been referred to as one of the worst animated series of all time.

==History==
The original &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; premiered alongside &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;Doug&quot; as one of the original Nicktoons on children&#x27;s network Nickelodeon in 1991. The show&#x27;s creator, John Kricfalusi, had many altercations with the network, eventually culminating in his termination. The series continued until 1995 at Games Animation, with issues prevalent during Kricfalusi&#x27;s tenure still present; it eventually ended with a single episode airing on MTV in 1996. In 2002, about a decade after Kricfalusi&#x27;s termination, Viacom (which owns Nickelodeon) contacted him to produce a new version of his series for an updated version of sister network TNN/Spike TV, which was devoted to programming for male audiences. Kricfalusi said that TNN wanted an &quot;extreme&quot; version of &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;. TNN gave Kricfalusi greater control of the writing and contents of the episodes, and he produced six &quot;new&quot; episodes aimed at adult audiences; of the episodes, only &quot;Altruists&quot; was not a leftover from the original series, being an original idea from Eric Bauza. As in the original series, Kricfalusi ran into problems with meeting production deadlines and budgetary limits, with only three out of the nine episodes ordered by the network being completed on time at the cost of the entire nine-episode budget initially allocated by Spike.

Several alumni from the original series returned to work on the new episodes, most notably co-developer Jim Smith, director and writer Vincent Waller as well as production assistant and writer Richard Pursel. Animation studio Carbunkle Cartoons returned to provide animation services, with Bob Jaques serving as animation director. Most &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; alumni who had joined Games Animation in the wake of Kricfalusi&#x27;s 1992 firing, most notably series developer Bob Camp, had become estranged from Kricfalusi and thus were not involved with the revival; Vincent Waller, having joined the studio after the original series ended, was an exception. Some of the original voice cast members returned, with the exception of Billy West, original voice of Stimpy and second voice of Ren and Mr. Horse, who turned down offers to reprise his role as Stimpy as he did not consider the series to be funny and felt that participating in it would damage his career. Eric Bauza was hired to replace West as Stimpy, while Kricfalusi reprised his roles as Ren and Mr. Horse. Cast members Harris Peet and Cheryl Chase also returned, and Kricfalusi&#x27;s father Mike Kricfalusi and long-time childhood friend Tom Hay provided some voices. 

Pursel, who worked on the series as a storyboard artist and writer, despised the work experience and considering it to be his worst; Kricfalusi refused to communicate with him directly and would add unnecessary shock value to his stories.

The new series began airing in June 2003 as part of an animation block also featuring &quot;Gary the Rat&quot;, &quot;Stripperella&quot;, and digitally remastered episodes of the original &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; series, subtitled &quot;Digitally Remastered Classics&quot;. Kricfalusi directed the first episode, &quot;Onward and Upward&quot;, based on requests from fans from the Nickelodeon era; Vincent Waller wrote the episode for the original series but was rejected. The episode portrayed the characters as bisexual. Advertisers objected to some of the new show&#x27;s content, particularly that of the risqué episode &quot;Naked Beach Frenzy&quot;, which did not air in the show&#x27;s original run, causing trouble with scheduling. The show stopped airing after three episodes when TNN&#x27;s animation block was &quot;put on hold&quot;.

The remaining episodes were set to resume in August 2004 along with the premiere of Spike&#x27;s new animated series &quot;Immigrants&quot; (developed by fellow Nickelodeon partner Klasky Csupo) but both shows were pulled and never aired.

Kricfalusi shut down Spümcø shortly on July 18, 2005, thereafter following a lawsuit filed by Carbunkle Cartoons for failing to pay the animation studio for their services. In 2005, he announced that all of the &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot; episodes that were fully produced were coming to DVD, which was released on July 18, 2006.

==Episodes==
All episodes of the series were directed by series creator John Kricfalusi, credited as &quot;John K.&quot; for the first five episodes and &quot;M. John Kricfalusi&quot; for the final episode.

A scrapped episode called &quot;Life Sucks&quot; was going to be on the DVD, but it was never produced on time. Only the first half was finished, while the other two acts remain unproduced. In the episode, Ren states his dislike of life, much to Stimpy&#x27;s horror. After that, they have an extensive look at their lifes&#x27; past tragedies, such as Ren&#x27;s experience with the Children&#x27;s Crusade. According to John Kricfalusi, this was going to be the prequel episode to &quot;Ren Seeks Help&quot;. This was the cause of Ren and Stimpy&#x27;s argument, as it is never stated in &quot;Ren Seeks Help&quot; what Ren had done exactly. Production had begun on this episode, with some voice work and roughly a third of the storyboard completed at the time of the show&#x27;s cancellation.

===Broadcast and DVD release===
The episode &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; was originally set to air in the original series&#x27; second season, but the episode was rejected by Nickelodeon due to disturbing violence, a brief joke about feces and references to tobacco. The episode did not air on television until 2003.

== Reception and legacy ==
Unlike its predecessor, &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot; was universally panned by critics and audiences, as well as fans of the original series. Rob Owen of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; described it as &quot;just plain gross. ... They don&#x27;t pay me enough to watch cartoon characters eating snot.&quot; Charles Solomon of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; criticized the show as &quot;&#x27;adult&#x27; only in the sense that you wouldn’t want kids watching them.&quot; &quot;Tucson Weekly&quot; and &quot;Exclaim!&quot; both labeled it &quot;disastrous&quot;. DVD Talk praised the show&#x27;s animation, &quot;but the weak stories epitomize empty, heavy-handed shock value.&quot; Matt Schimkowitz of Splitsider opined that the show&#x27;s intended audience was &quot;the 16-year-olds who grew up on the [original] show and are ready to handle such hilarious topics as spousal abuse and eating boogers.&quot;

&quot;PopMatters&quot;, however, was more favorable, writing: &quot;With snot as side dishes and vomit as gravy, the foulness is overwhelming, yet also clever. Kricfalusi&#x27;s satire may be obvious, but he&#x27;s not just making puke jokes for nausea&#x27;s sake.&quot; Thad Komorowski, a historian on the original series and this series, noted that the reboot&#x27;s poor performance originated from too many factors at play, and its reputation as one of the worst animated series of all time as an exaggeration; he stated that the lack of involvement from individuals like Bob Camp and Chris Reccardi as well as its utilization of rejected episodes from the series contributed to its downfall.

<text>Montfort-sur-Risle (, literally &quot;Montfort on Risle&quot;) is a commune in the Eure department in Normandy region in northern France.

==History==

In Gallic times the river Risle delimited the territories of the tribes of Veliocasses and the Lexovii. Between 980 and 1204, when it passed into the hands of the King of France with its castle, Montfort-sur-Risle was a lordship. The most famous Lord of Montfort was Hugues II de Montfort (died 1083), who joined in the Norman conquest of England, for which he received 114 English manors.

==Geography==

The commune along with another 69 communes shares part of a 4,747 hectare, Natura 2000 conservation area, called Risle, Guiel, Charentonne.

<doc id="1206095" wikidata="Q2538152" url="?curid=1206095" title="WaRP Graphics">
<text>WaRP Graphics, later Warp Graphics, is an alternative comics publisher best known for creating and being the original publisher of the &quot;Elfquest&quot; comic book series. It was created and incorporated in 1977 by Wendy and Richard Pini. The company title is an acronym formed from the founding couple&#x27;s name: Wendy and Richard Pini (in later years the capitalization was changed from WaRP to Warp, a mostly aesthetic move).

In addition to &quot;Elfquest&quot;, Warp also published several other comic book series, including &quot;MythAdventures&quot; and related titles by Robert Asprin, and &quot;Thunder Bunny&quot;, created by Martin Greim.

Warp was also the original publisher of &quot;A Distant Soil&quot; by Colleen Doran, until Doran left under acrimonious circumstances, alleging that WaRP attempted to claim copyright on her work, which WaRP denied. Warp sued licensee publisher Starblaze Graphics for, among other issues, publication of unauthorized &quot;Elfquest&quot; reprints, inaccurate reporting of royalties, but primarily for tortious interference in Warp&#x27;s contract with Doran (who was also named in the Donning lawsuit), by attempting to assume the rights to &quot;A Distant Soil&quot;. Starblaze countersued; the dispute was settled out of court by Donning and Doran in 1988. All rights previously licensed to Donning in &quot;Elfquest&quot; reverted to Warp; Warp reverted all rights in &quot;A Distant Soil&quot; to Doran.

==History==

=== Apple Comics ===
From 1978 through 1984, Warp Graphics published the 20-issue original &quot;Elfquest&quot; series. When Elfquest subsequently went on hiatus to allow artist Wendy Pini to recuperate from hip replacement surgery, publisher Richard Pini began to contract the work of other writers and artists, to establish a line of generally fantasy-oriented comics titles. In 1986, Pini turned Warp&#x27;s publishing and marketing duties over to Michael Catron&#x27;s Apple Comics so that Warp could concentrate on editing its comics titles. Titles packaged by Warp for Apple included the anthology series &quot;FantaSci&quot;, &quot;Vietnam Journal&quot;, and Lee Marrs&#x27;s &quot;Unicorn Isle&quot; (which ran to #5 of a projected 12 issues).

In 1987, Apple Comics took over editing duties on all the other titles, and Warp concentrated solely on producing new &quot;Elfquest&quot; series. In 1990 Warp and Apple parted ways. In 1992 Warp launched the first of several new Elfquest spin-off series (&quot;Hidden Years&quot;). Shortly thereafter, Warp for the first time invited other writers and artists to join in the creation of new &quot;Elfquest&quot; material. Beginning in 1997, WaRP also published a few &quot;Elflord&quot; comics by Barry Blair and Colin Chan, who had also written for &quot;Elfquest&quot;. From 1992 to 2002 Warp Graphics worked with a number of free-lance artists and writers to produce and publish several &quot;Elfquest&quot; related titles. In 2002, the company downsized to its original owners, Wendy and Richard Pini in order to concentrate solely on producing canonical &quot;Elfquest&quot; material.

=== Father Tree Press imprint ===
Warp also launched a book publishing imprint, Father Tree Press (named after the Wolfriders&#x27; original tree-home in &quot;Elfquest&quot;), primarily reprinting &quot;Elfquest&quot; stories. The imprint also appeared on &quot;Chroma&quot;, a book on the artwork of Alex Schomburg, and &quot;Law and Chaos&quot;, a chronicle of Wendy Pini&#x27;s early attempt to adapt Michael Moorcock&#x27;s Stormbringer saga into an animated film. Warp and Father Tree Press still exist; while they are not currently publishing new Elfquest books in printed comic or book format, they continue to publish both existing and new Elfquest material digitally online. They also published, from 2007 to 2010, both in print and digitally, Wendy Pini&#x27;s non-Elfquest graphic novel &quot;Masque of the Red Death&quot;, a futuristic reimagining of the Edgar Allan Poe short story.

=== Partnership with DC ===
In 2003 the Pinis licensed the worldwide publication and media rights in &quot;Elfquest&quot; to DC Comics. DC put out two series of &quot;manga-style&quot; digest reprints (now complete), the first four volumes of an archive reprint series, one new graphic novel, and a four-part comic series entitled &quot;Discovery&quot;, which has since been collected. DC and Warp parted ways in 2007, when Warp opted not to renew the DC contract.

===Partnership with Warner Bros. ===
In 2008, Warp Graphics licensed the media rights in &quot;Elfquest&quot; to Warner Bros. with the aim of turning the comic book series into a motion picture. A director and screenwriter, Rawson Thurber, were attached to the project and several versions of a script, as well as some production artwork, were completed. The option expired in 2009.

===Partnership with Dark Horse Comics ===
In 2012, Warp licensed worldwide publication rights in &quot;Elfquest&quot; to Dark Horse Comics making the title the only independent comic to have been published by all of the &quot;Big Three&quot; comics companies in the US. To date, Dark Horse has published the complete &quot;Final Quest&quot; story arc, as well as several volumes in the &quot;Complete Elfquest&quot; collection. More volumes are planned at least into 2020.

<text>In a number of Christian traditions, including Eastern Orthodoxy, Catholicism, Lutheranism and Anglicanism, a confessor is a priest who hears the confessions of penitents and pronounces absolution.

== History ==

During the Diocletianic Persecution, a number of Christians had, under torture or threat thereof, weakened in their profession of the faith. When persecutions ceased under Constantine the Great, they wanted to be reunited with the church. It became the practice of the penitents to go to the Confessors, who had willingly suffered for the faith and survived, to plead their case and effect their restoration to communion.

Over time, the word came to denote any priest who had been granted the authority to hear confessions. Historically, priests were sometimes tested by officers of the church called examiners, before being granted this authority.

== As spiritual advisor ==

An individual may have a regular confessor, sometimes called a &quot;spiritual advisor&quot; or &quot;spiritual father&quot;, to whom they turn for confidential and disinterested advice, especially on spiritual matters. Historically, this has been a common practice for Christian monarchs.

It is standard practice for a religious community of women, whether enclosed or just very large, to have one or several priests serving their spiritual needs, including being their confessor.

<doc id="1206101" wikidata="Q7378526" url="?curid=1206101" title="Ruger 10/22">
<text>The Ruger 10/22 is a series of semi-automatic rifles produced by American firearm manufacturer Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co., chambered for the .22 Long Rifle rimfire cartridge. It uses a patented 10-round rotary magazine, though higher capacity box magazines are also available. The standard carbine version of the Ruger 10/22 has been in production continuously since 1964, making it one of the most successful rimfire rifle designs in history, with numerous third party manufacturers making parts and accessories for upgrading and customization. The 10/22&#x27;s aftermarket is so prolific that a complete 10/22 can be built without using any Ruger-made components.

A magnum version of the 10/22, known as the 10/22 Magnum, chambered for the .22 WMR cartridge, was made from 1998 to 2006. A .17 HMR version, the 10/17, was announced in 2004, but was only listed in the catalog for two years.

==Design==

The 10/22 is popular for small-game hunters and those who want an inexpensive rifle for firing inexpensive ammunition for target, plinking and survival use. This popularity has led to many after-market modifications being available to improve performance, augment the rifle&#x27;s looks, or increase its magazine capacity, making the 10/22 one of the most customizable firearms ever made.

Custom manufacturers also make &quot;clones&quot; of the 10/22, which are similar in design (most parts will interchange) but built to much higher specifications and costs. The 10/22 barrel uses a unique two-screw, V-block system to attach the barrel to the receiver, allowing for removal or replacement of the barrel, which would ordinarily require the work of a gunsmith.

===Magazines===

There are many types of magazines for the Ruger 10/22. The standard 10/22 ships with a black 10-round polymer rotary magazine, the BX-1. Ruger has also introduced a transparent polycarbonate version (&quot;40th-anniversary edition&quot;) of the BX-1 called the BX-1CLR, as well as a 1-round version for training and a 5-round version for states or countries that restrict magazine capacities. In 2011–2012, Ruger came out with the BX-25, a curved 25-round box magazine with a black composite frame and steel feed lips, as well as the 15-round BX-15 box magazine for states that restrict magazine capacities. Aftermarket options include 25-, 30-, and 50-round box magazines; 50-round teardrop-shaped rotary magazines, and 50- and 110-round drum magazines.

The standard BX-1 rotary magazine stores the cartridges in a cogwheel-like holder, rather than stacked as seen in a box magazine. This allows the magazine to be compact and fit flush into the rifle without protruding from the stock at the natural balance point for one-handed carry. The bolt of the rifle pushes a cartridge from the metal feeding lip of the magazine with each shot, allowing the next cartridge to feed into place. The rotary magazine is also used by the Ruger&#x27;s American Rimfire series bolt-action rifles, as well as the 10/22-footprinted &quot;Summit&quot; toggle-action rifles produced by Primary Weapon Systems/Volquartsen.

Not all Ruger 10/22 magazines are interchangeable, and firing a magazine with the wrong type of ammunition can result in a malfunction.

==Variants==


The 10/22 is available in a wide variety of configurations. In 2015, the Ruger 10/22 came in 11 different models, not counting distributor exclusives. The Carbine came in three models; the Tactical, Takedown and Target each had two models; the Sporter and Compact each had one model. The discontinued &quot;10/22 International&quot; model was fitted with a Mannlicher stock. Standard barrel lengths are 20&quot; in the &quot;10/22 Rifle&quot;, 18&quot; in the &quot;10/22 Carbine&quot;, and 16&quot; in the &quot;10/22 Compact Rifle&quot; which is also fitted with a shorter stock. All .22 Long Rifle versions use an aluminum receiver, while the discontinued .22 Magnum version used a steel receiver with integral scope bases.

The rifle also has an enhanced semi-auto chamber, BX-Trigger, heat-treated and nitrided CNC-machined match bolt, 16-1/8&quot; cold hammer-forged bull free-floating barrel which is fluted to reduce weight and dissipate heat and is also threaded with a 1/2&quot;-28 pattern to accommodate the included muzzle brake or other barrel accessories.

==== 50th Anniversary Rifle ====
In 2014 to mark the 50th anniversary of the Ruger 10/22 a contest was held to design an anniversary model.

===10/22 Takedown===
On March 28, 2012, Ruger introduced the 10/22 Takedown model. This model disassembles into barrel and action/buttstock components. It is shipped in a backpack style case that has room for the rifle, ammunition, and accessories. The MSRP is higher than the basic carbine models. The standard Takedown model has a brushed aluminum receiver made to resemble stainless steel and 18.5&quot; barrel with a black synthetic stock. Also offered in a black alloy receiver and 16.12&quot; threaded barrel with a flash suppressor or with a threaded, fluted target barrel.

====10/22 Takedown Lite====
The Takedown Lite models are similar to the other Takedown models but has a lightweight target barrel design.

===SR-22 Rifle===

In 2009, Ruger released the &quot;SR-22 Rifle&quot; model, a 10/22 receiver embedded in a chassis that mimics the dimensions of an AR-15 style rifle such as their own SR-556. The SR-22 Rifle uses standard 10/22 rotary magazines, in addition to most aftermarket 10/22 magazines. The positions of the magazine release, the safety and the charging handle are all more similar to a standard 10/22 than an AR-15. The SR-22 Rifle competes directly with other AR-15 style rimfire rifles such as those made by Colt and Smith &amp; Wesson. The SR-22 rifle boasts an aluminium handguard, adjustable six position stock, and a top receiver rail. Threaded holes on the handguard provide the customization of optional attachment rails.

===22 Charger Pistol===
The &quot;22 Charger&quot; pistol, first introduced in late 2007, is a pistol based on the 10/22 action. The 22 Charger originally came with a black laminated wood pistol stock with forend, a matte blued heavy barrel, a bipod, and a Weaver style scope base in lieu of iron sights. Overall length is just under , making it quite large for a handgun. As it has an included bipod it is likely to be used from a shooting bench or table. The bipod attaches to a sling swivel on the stock fore-end and is easily removable. Due to technical features, such as the magazine being outside the pistol grip, the Charger is not legally available in some U.S. states. The 22 Charger was later discontinued. It was reintroduced in December 2014, with a brown laminate stock with a M16A2 style pistol grip, 10-inch threaded barrel, picatinny rail, 15-round magazine and adjustable bipod. At the same time a &quot;Takedown&quot; model was introduced with a green laminate stock. Both models were later offered from September 2015 with black polymer stocks.

===10/22 Magnum===
The 10/22 Magnum was produced from 1998 to 2006 and was chambered for the .22 Magnum cartridge.

===10/17===
The 10/17 was announced in 2004 and was chambered for the .17 HMR cartridge. It was never actually released and sold to the public.

===Silent-SR ISB===
The Silent-SR ISB is a barrel assembly offered by Ruger in 2016, which is available for any 10/22 Takedown, 10/22 Takedown Lite rifles and the 22 Charger Takedown pistol.

==Modifications==

A wide variety of aftermarket modification kits are offered for the 10/22, including conversions to bullpup configuration and cosmetic alterations to replicate the appearance of weapons like the M1 Carbine, Thompson submachine gun, FN P90, and AR-15.

===AWC Ultra II===
The &quot;AWC Ultra II&quot; is a modified version of the Ruger 10/22 made by AWC Systech and has an integrally-suppressed shortened barrel. The sound suppressor encloses a ported stainless barrel and is made of 300 series stainless steel having a 1&quot; diameter which closely resembles a bull barrel. The barrel length is 16.5&quot; with an overall weapon length of 34&quot; and the weight is 6 lbs. Due to the integral suppressor, this model is a Title II weapon in the U.S.

===AT 10/22 QD===
The &quot;AT 10/22 QD&quot; is a short-barreled modified version of the 10/22 made by Arms Tech Limited. It features a six-inch barrel, a folding stock, and is designed to accept Arms Tech&#x27;s own QD-223 suppressor. It comes in at a mere 5 pounds without the suppressor. Due to its extremely short barrel, it is considered a Title II weapon in the U.S.

== Copies ==
=== AMT Lightning 25/22 ===
=== Thompson/Center T/CR22 ===
The Thompson/Center T/CR22 is a .22 LR-caliber clone of the Ruger 10/22 semi-automatic rifle manufactured by Thompson/Center Arms.

=== Bergara BXR ===
The Bergara BXR is a .22 LR-caliber clone of the Ruger 10/22 semi-automatic rifle manufactured by Bergara in Spain. It can take Ruger 10/22 magazines.

== Military users ==
*: The Ruger 10/22 has seen limited use by the Israel Defense Forces in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict as a &quot;less than lethal&quot; weapon for security and crowd or &quot;riot&quot; control purposes in the Palestinian territories. The IDF uses a modified carbine rifle version with a scope and a suppressor, which would allow for quiet operation with no loud noises to indicate the shot&#x27;s origin. The use of the rifle by the IDF as a less lethal weapon has been (and remains) controversial. In 2001, its use as a less lethal weapon was banned by the Military Advocate General Menachem Finkelstein, but in 2009, it was reintroduced to service. It has since continued to be responsible for multiple fatalities, especially among younger Palestinians, with the latest victim having been killed in December 2020.

<doc id="1206106" wikidata="Q938617" url="?curid=1206106" title="High Voltage (1929 film)">
<text>High Voltage (1929) is an American pre-Code film produced by Pathé Exchange and directed by Howard Higgin. The film stars William Boyd, Diane Ellis, Owen Moore, Phillips Smalley, Billy Bevan, and Carole Lombard in her feature-length &quot;talkie&quot; debut, billed as &quot;Carol Lombard.&quot;

This film is in the public domain.

==Plot==
The film begins with a bus driving along a snow-covered roadway in the Sierra Nevada between Nevada City, California, and Reno, Nevada. Soon the vehicle gets hopelessly stuck in deep snow forty miles from the nearest town. Needing shelter, the driver &quot;Gus&quot; (Billy Bevan) and his four passengers find refuge in an isolated one-room log church. The passengers include &quot;Billie&quot; (Carole Lombard), who is an escaped criminal being escorted back to jail in New York by a deputy sheriff, &quot;Dan Egan&quot; (Owen Moore); a young woman, &quot;The Kid,&quot; (Diane Ellis) on her way to Chicago to meet her boyfriend; and &quot;Hickerson,&quot; a pompous, ill-tempered banker. In the church the group finds &quot;Bill&quot; (William Boyd), a self-described &quot;hobo,&quot; who had found shelter there earlier. Tensions quickly arise in the group over their general plight, petty jealousies, and concerns about how six people are going to share the small supply of food that Bill had brought with him.

After a few days being stranded, the group sees a passing mail plane high in the sky. They try to attract the pilot&#x27;s attention, but he is too far away to see them. More days pass, and the group continues to ration their dwindling supplies and battle the subfreezing temperatures. To keep warm they begin to break up the church&#x27;s pews and other furnishings to use as firewood in the room&#x27;s potbelly stove. The group&#x27;s desperation intensifies, as does a romance between Bill and Billie. Soon Bill confides to her that he too is a wanted criminal, a fugitive from Saint Paul, Minnesota. As conditions worsen, The Kid collapses from hunger and become delirious; and the church&#x27;s interior becomes almost bare as more furnishings—even the church&#x27;s pulpit and pump organ—are consigned to the stove. Bill and Billie finally commit to leaving to avoid being imprisoned if the group is somehow rescued. They quietly depart during the night, hoping to reach a ranger station ten miles away. Everyone else is sleeping except Dan, the deputy sheriff, who sees the two leaving; but he does nothing to stop them. After walking a short distance through snowdrifts, Bill and Billie hear and then see a search plane slowly circling overhead at low altitude. Realizing that the others inside the church will not hear the plane&#x27;s engine, they rush back and awaken them. The group hurriedly builds a signal fire, which the plane&#x27;s pilot sees. He parachutes a box of provisions to them with a note saying that help will be sent immediately.

The next day the group sees a rescue party heading toward the church. While awaiting their rescuers, Dan observes Bill and Billie sitting together on the floor. From his coat pocket Dan pulls out Billie&#x27;s extradition papers and a &quot;wanted&quot; notice that includes a photograph of Bill and information about his being a fugitive from Saint Paul. Dan walks over to the stove, now cold from no fires, and tosses both papers into it. Bill and Billie see him discard the papers, and they look at one another. Bill then gets up, retrieves the papers from the stove, gives them back to Dan, and asks him to drop him off in Saint Paul on his way back to New York with Billie.

==Cast==
*William Boyd as &quot;The Boy&quot; (Bill)
*&quot;Carol&quot; Lombard as &quot;The Girl&quot; (Billie Davis)
*Owen Moore as &quot;The Detective&quot; (Dan Egan)
*Phillips Smalley as &quot;The Banker&quot; (J. Milton Hendrickson)
*Billy Bevan as &quot;The Driver&quot; (Gus)
*Diane Ellis as &quot;The Kid&quot;

===Cast notes===
*The opening credits of &quot;High Voltage&quot; give Carole Lombard&#x27;s first name as &quot;Carol,&quot; her preferred spelling for her name up until that time. However, the year after the release of &quot;High Voltage&quot; she performed in Paramount Pictures&#x27; production &quot;Fast and Loose.&quot; In her credits for that film, the studio mistakenly added an &quot;e&quot; to Carol. Lombard liked the spelling, so she decided to keep &quot;Carole&quot; permanently as her screen name.

==Reception==
In July 1929, the entertainment trade paper &quot;The Film Daily&quot; gave a generally positive review to the &quot;All-Talker Version&quot; of &quot;High Voltage&quot;, as well as high marks to William Boyd&#x27;s performance. With regard to &quot;Carol Lombard&quot;, the New York publication identifies her only in the film&#x27;s cast listing; it never refers to her by name within the body of its review, just as either &quot;the blonde prisoner&quot; or &quot;the girl&quot;:

<doc id="1206114" wikidata="Q219363" url="?curid=1206114" title="NetFlow">
<text>NetFlow is a feature that was introduced on Cisco routers around 1996 that provides the ability to collect IP network traffic as it enters or exits an interface. By analyzing the data provided by NetFlow, a network administrator can determine things such as the source and destination traffic, class of service, and the causes of congestion. A typical flow monitoring setup (using NetFlow) consists of three main components:

* Flow exporter: aggregates packets into flows and exports flow records towards one or more flow collectors.
* Flow collector: responsible for reception, storage and pre-processing of flow data received from a flow exporter.
* Analysis application: analyzes received flow data in the context of intrusion detection or traffic profiling, for example.

== Protocol description ==

Routers and switches that support NetFlow can collect IP traffic statistics on all interfaces where NetFlow is enabled, and later export those statistics as NetFlow records toward at least one NetFlow collector—typically a server that does the actual traffic analysis.

=== Network flows ===

Cisco standard NetFlow version 5 defines a &quot;flow&quot; as a unidirectional sequence of packets that all share seven values which define a unique key for the flow:
# Ingress interface (SNMP ifIndex)
# Source IP address
# Destination IP address
# IP protocol number
# Source port for UDP or TCP, 0 for other protocols
# Destination port for UDP or TCP, type and code for ICMP, or 0 for other protocols
# IP Type of Service

Note that the Egress interface, IP Nexthop or BGP Nexthops are not part of the key, and may not be accurate if the route changes before the expiration of the flow, or if load-balancing is done per-packet.

This definition of flows is also used for IPv6, and a similar definition is used for MPLS and Ethernet flows.

Advanced NetFlow or IPFIX implementations like Cisco Flexible NetFlow allow user-defined flow keys.

A typical output of a NetFlow command line tool (codice_1 in this case) when printing the stored flows may look as follows:

 Date flow start Duration Proto Src IP Addr:Port Dst IP Addr:Port Packets Bytes Flows
 2010-09-01 00:00:00.459 0.000 UDP 127.0.0.1:24920 -&gt; 192.168.0.1:22126 1 46 1
 2010-09-01 00:00:00.363 0.000 UDP 192.168.0.1:22126 -&gt; 127.0.0.1:24920 1 80 1

=== Export of records ===

The router will output a flow record when it determines that the flow is finished. It does this by flow aging: when the router sees new traffic for an existing flow it resets the aging counter. Also, TCP session termination in a TCP flow causes the router to expire the flow. Routers can also be configured to output a flow record at a fixed interval even if the flow is still ongoing.

==== Packet transport protocol ====

NetFlow records are traditionally exported using User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and collected using a NetFlow collector. 
The IP address of the NetFlow collector and the destination UDP port must be configured on the sending router. A common value is UDP port 2055, but other values like 9555 or 9995, 9025, 9026 etc. can also be used.

For efficiency reasons, the router traditionally does not keep track of flow records already exported, so if a NetFlow packet is dropped due to network congestion or packet corruption, all contained records are lost forever. The UDP protocol does not inform the router of the loss so it can send the packets again.
This can be a real problem, especially with NetFlow v8 or v9 that can aggregate a lot of packets or flows into a single record. A single UDP packet loss can cause a huge impact on the statistics of some flows.

That is why some modern implementations of NetFlow use the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) to export packets so as to provide some protection against packet loss, and make sure that NetFlow v9 templates are received before any related record is exported. Note that TCP would not be suitable for NetFlow because a strict ordering of packets would cause excessive buffering and delays.

The problem with SCTP is that it requires interaction between each NetFlow collector and each router exporting NetFlow. There may be performance limitations if a router has to deal with many NetFlow collectors, and a NetFlow collector has to deal with many routers, especially when some of them are unavailable due to failure or maintenance.

SCTP may not be efficient if NetFlow must be exported toward several independent collectors, some of which may be test servers that can go down at any moment.
UDP allows simple replication of NetFlow packets using Network taps or L2 or L3 Mirroring. Simple stateless equipment can also filter or change the destination address of NetFlow UDP packets if necessary. Since NetFlow export almost only use network backbone links, packet loss will often be negligible. If it happens, it will mostly be on the link between the network and the NetFlow collectors.

==== Packet headers ====

All NetFlow packets begin with version-dependent header, that contains at least these fields:
*Version number (v1, v5, v7, v8, v9)
*Sequence number to detect loss and duplication
*Timestamps at the moment of export, as system uptime or absolute time.
*Number of records (v5 or v8) or list of templates and records (v9)

=== Records ===

A NetFlow record can contain a wide variety of information about the traffic in a given flow.

NetFlow version 5 (one of the most commonly used versions, followed by version 9) contains the following:
*Input interface index used by SNMP (ifIndex in IF-MIB).
*Output interface index or zero if the packet is dropped.
*Timestamps for the flow start and finish time, in milliseconds since the last boot.
*Number of bytes and packets observed in the flow
*Layer 3 headers:
**Source &amp; destination IP addresses
**ICMP Type and Code.
**IP protocol
**Type of Service (ToS) value
*Source and destination port numbers for TCP, UDP, SCTP
*For TCP flows, the union of all TCP flags observed over the life of the flow.
*Layer 3 Routing information:
**IP address of the immediate next-hop (not the BGP nexthop) along the route to the destination
**Source &amp; destination IP masks (prefix lengths in the CIDR notation)

For ICMP flows, the Source Port is zero, and the Destination Port number field codes ICMP message Type and Code (port = ICMP-Type * 256 + ICMP-Code) .

The source and destination Autonomous System (AS) number fields can report the destination AS (last AS of AS-Path) or the immediate neighbor AS (first AS of AS-Path) depending on the router configuration. But the AS number will be zero if the feature is not supported, the route is unknown or not announced by BGP, or the AS is the local AS. There is no explicit way to distinguish between these cases.

NetFlow version 9 can include all of these fields and can optionally include additional information such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) labels and IPv6 addresses and ports,

By analyzing flow data, a picture of traffic flow and traffic volume in a network can be built. The NetFlow record format has evolved over time, hence the inclusion of version numbers. Cisco maintains details of the different version numbers and the layout of the packets for each version.

=== Interfaces ===

NetFlow is usually enabled on a per-interface basis to limit load on the router components involved in NetFlow, or to limit the amount of NetFlow records exported.

NetFlow usually captures all packets received by an ingress IP interface, but some NetFlow implementations use IP filters to decide if a packet can be observed by NetFlow.

Some NetFlow implementations also allow the observation of packets on the egress IP interface, but this must be used with care: all flows from any ingress interface with NetFlow enabled to any interface with NetFlow enabled could be counted twice.

=== Sampled NetFlow ===

Standard NetFlow was designed to process all IP packets on an interface. But in some environments, e.g. on Internet backbones, that was too costly, due to the extra processing required for each packet, and large number of simultaneous flows.

So Cisco introduced sampled NetFlow on Cisco 12000, and that is now used in all high-end routers that implement NetFlow.

Only one packet out of &quot;n&quot; is processed, where &quot;n&quot;, the sampling rate, is determined by the router configuration.

The exact selection process depends on the implementation:
* One packet every &quot;n&quot; packet, in Deterministic NetFlow, as used on Cisco&#x27;s 12000.
* One packet randomly selected in an interval of &quot;n&quot; packet, in Random Sampled NetFlow, used on modern Cisco routers.

Some implementations have more complex methods to sample packets, like per-flow sampling on Cisco Martinez Catalysts.

The sampling rate is often the same for all interfaces, but can be adjusted per interface for some routers.
When Sampled NetFlow is used, the NetFlow records must be adjusted for the effect of sampling - traffic volumes, in particular, are now an estimate rather than the actual measured flow volume.

The sampling rate is indicated in a header field of NetFlow version 5 (same sampling rate for all interfaces) or in option records of NetFlow version 9 (sampling rate per interface)

==Versions==

=== NetFlow and IPFIX ===

NetFlow was initially implemented by Cisco, and described in an &quot;informational&quot; document that was not on the standards track: RFC 3954 – Cisco Systems NetFlow Services Export Version 9. The NetFlow protocol itself has been superseded by Internet Protocol Flow Information eXport (IPFIX). Based on the NetFlow Version 9 implementation, IPFIX is on the IETF standards track with RFC 5101 (obsoleted by RFC 7011), RFC 5102 (obsoleted by RFC 7012), etc. which were published in 2008.

=== Equivalents ===

Many vendors other than Cisco provide similar network flow monitoring technology. NetFlow may be a prevalent name in the area of flow monitoring, because of Cisco dominant market share in the networking industry. NetFlow is thought to be a Cisco trademark (even though as of March 2012 it is not listed in Cisco Trademarks):
* Argus - Audit Record Generation and Utilization System
* Jflow or cflowd for Juniper Networks
* NetStream for 3Com/HP
* NetStream for Huawei Technologies
* Cflowd for Nokia
* Rflow for Ericsson
* AppFlow Citrix
* sFlow vendors include: Alaxala, Alcatel Lucent, Allied Telesis, Arista Networks, Brocade, Cisco, Dell, D-Link, Enterasys, Extreme, F5 BIG-IP, Fortinet, Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi, Huawei, IBM, Juniper, LG-Ericsson, Mellanox, MRV, NEC, Netgear, Proxim Wireless, Quanta Computer, Vyatta, Telesoft, ZTE and ZyXEL

Also flow-tools collection of software allows to process and manage NetFlow exports from Cisco and Juniper routers.

== Variants ==

=== Cisco&#x27;s NetFlow Security Event Logging===

Introduced with the launch of the Cisco ASA 5580 products, NetFlow Security Event Logging utilizes NetFlow v9 fields and templates in order to efficiently deliver security telemetry in high performance environments. NetFlow Security Event Logging scales better than syslog while offering the same level of detail and granularity in logged events.

=== Monitoring based on standalone probes ===


NetFlow collection using standalone NetFlow probes is an alternative to flow collection from routers and switches. This approach can overcome some limitations of router-based NetFlow monitoring. The probes are transparently connected to the monitored link as a passive appliance using the TAP or SPAN port of the appliance.

Historically, NetFlow monitoring is easier to implement in a dedicated probe than in a router. However, this approach also has some drawbacks:
* probes must be deployed on every link that must be observed, causing additional hardware, setup and maintenance costs.
* probes will not report separate input and output interface information like a report from a router would.
* probes may have problems reporting reliably the NetFlow fields related to routing, like AS Numbers or IP masks, because they can hardly be expected to use exactly the same routing information as a router.

The easiest way to address the above drawbacks is to use a packet capture appliance inline in front of the router and capture all of the NetFlow output from the router. This method allows for storage of large amount of NetFlow data (typically many years worth of data) and does not require reconfiguration of the network.

NetFlow collection from dedicated probes is well suited for observation of critical links, whereas NetFlow on routers provides a Network-wide view of the traffic that can be used for capacity planning, accounting, performance monitoring, and security.

==History==
NetFlow was originally a Cisco packet switching technology for Cisco routers, implemented in IOS 11.x around 1996.
It was originally a software implementation for the Cisco 7000, 7200 and 7500, where it was thought as an improvement over the then current Cisco Fast Switching. Netflow was invented by Darren Kerr and Barry Bruin from Cisco (U.S. patent # 6,243,667 ).

The idea was that the first packet of a flow would create a NetFlow switching record. This record would then be used for all later packets of the same flow, until the expiration of the flow. Only the first packet of a flow would require an investigation of the route table to find the most specific matching route. This is an expensive operation in software implementations, especially the old ones without Forwarding information base. The NetFlow switching record was actually some kind of route cache record, and old versions of IOS still refer to the NetFlow cache as ip route-cache.

This technology was advantageous for local networks. This was especially true if some of the traffic had to be filtered by an ACL as only the first packet of a flow had to be evaluated by the ACL.

NetFlow switching soon turned out to be unsuitable for big routers, especially Internet backbone routers, where the number of simultaneous flows was much more important than those on local networks, and where some traffic causes many short-lived flows, like Domain Name System requests (whose source port is random for security reasons).

As a switching technology, NetFlow was replaced around 1995 by Cisco Express Forwarding. This first appeared on Cisco 12000 routers, and later replaced NetFlow switching on advanced IOS for the Cisco 7200 and Cisco 7500.

As of 2012, technologies similar to NetFlow switching are still in use in most firewalls and software-based IP routers. For instance the conntrack feature of the Netfilter framework used by Linux.

<text>Abies nebrodensis, the Sicilian fir, is a fir native to the Madonie mountains in northern Sicily.

==Taxonomy==
It is closely related to silver fir, &quot;Abies alba&quot;, which replaces it in the Apennine Mountains of Italy and elsewhere further north in Europe; some botanists treat Sicilian fir as a variety of silver fir, as &quot;Abies alba&quot; var. &quot;nebrodensis&quot;. Needle morphology and Genetic studies showed ancient relationships of Abies nebrodensis with southern Italy Abies alba, Abies cephalonica and Abies numidica.

==Description==
It is a medium-size evergreen coniferous tree growing to 15–25 m tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 1 m.

The leaves are needle-like, flattened, 1.5–2.5 cm long and 2 mm wide by 0.5 mm thick, glossy dark green above, and with two greenish-white bands of stomata below. The tip of the leaf is blunt with a notched tip, but sometimes with a pointed tip, particularly on shoots high on older trees. The cones are 10–16 cm long and 4 cm broad, with about 150 scales, each scale with an exserted bract and two winged seeds; they disintegrate when mature to release the seeds.

==Distribution==
Despite its scientific name, the species is of Mt. Scalone in the Madonie Mountains in the north-central part of Sicily.

==Ecology==
It occurs at altitudes of 1400–1,600 metres. It is limited to the steep, dry slopes.

==Conservation==
As a result of deforestation, it is now extremely rare, with only 27 mature trees and a few seedlings are surviving in situ; replanting programmes are meeting with limited success due to heavy grazing pressure by livestock belonging to local farmers.
Anyway, assisted migration programmes are being carried out by the University of Palermo as well as by the CREA Research Centre for Forestry and Wood of Arezzo in order to preserve the gene pool from the effect of the climatic belt shift.
It has been classified as &#x27;critically endangered&#x27; in the IUCN Red List in 2017. In the European Union it has been designated as a &#x27;priority species&#x27; under Annex II of the Habitats Directive, which means areas in which it occurs can be declared Special Areas of Conservation, &quot;if&quot; these areas belong to one of the number of habitats listed in Annex I of the directive.

<text>Colonial Spanish horse is a term for a group of horse breed and feral populations descended from the original Iberian horse stock brought from Spain to the Americas. The ancestral type from which these horses descend was a product of the horse populations that blended between the Iberian horse and the North African Barb. The term encompasses many strains or breeds now found primarily in North America. The status of the Colonial Spanish horse is considered threatened overall with seven individual strains specifically identified. The horses are registered by several entities.

The Colonial Spanish horse, a general classification popularized by D. Philip Sponenberg, is not synonymous with the Spanish Mustang, the name given to a specific standardized breed derived from the first concerted effort of conservationists in the United States to preserve horses of Colonial Spanish Type. Colonial Spanish horse blood markers have been found in some mustang populations. Small groups of horses of Colonial Spanish horse type have been located in various groups of ranch-bred, mission, and Native American horses, mostly among those in private ownership.

==Characteristics==

Colonial Spanish horses are generally small; the usual height is around , and most vary from . Weight varies with height, but most are around . Their heads vary somewhat between long, finely made to shorter and deeper, generally having straight to concave (rarely slightly convex) foreheads and a nose that is straight or slightly convex. The muzzle is usually very fine, and from the side the upper lip is usually longer than the lower, although the teeth meet evenly. Nostrils are usually small and crescent shaped. They typically have narrow but deep chests, with the front legs leaving the body fairly close together. When viewed from the front, the front legs join the chest in an &quot;A&quot; shape rather than straight across as in most other modern breeds that have wider chests. The withers are usually sharp instead of low and meaty. The croup is sloped, and the tail is characteristically set low on the body. From the rear view they are usually &quot;rafter hipped&quot; meaning the muscling of the hip tapers up so the backbone is the highest point. Hooves are small and upright rather than flat.

==History in the Americas==

Horses first returned to the Americas with the conquistadors, beginning with Columbus, who imported horses from Spain to the West Indies on his second voyage in 1493. Domesticated horses came to the mainland with the arrival of Cortés in 1519. By 1525, Cortés had imported enough horses to create a nucleus of horse-breeding in Mexico. Horses arrived in South America beginning in 1531, and by 1538 there were horses in Florida. From these origins, horses spread throughout the Americas. By one estimate there were at least 10,000 free-roaming horses in Mexico by 1553.

In 2010, the Colonial Spanish mustang was voted the official state horse of North Carolina.

==Modern horses==

Many gaited horse and stock horse breeds in the United States descend from Spanish horses, but only a few bloodlines are considered to be near-pure descendants of original Spanish stock. Though many are described as horse breeds, it can be debated they are separate breeds or multiple strains of a single large breed. The Livestock Conservancy lists them as one breed, but also calls them &quot;a group of closely related breeds&quot; Various bloodlines or groups of Colonial Spanish horses are registered a number of different Associations.

While some bands of modern mustangs have evidence of ancestry from the original Spanish imports, genetic analysis indicates that many free-ranging horses in the Great Basin descend from later breeds of draft horse, cavalry mounts, and other saddle horses. Where they have been found to have descended from the original Spanish horses, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and other agencies attempt to preserve them. Blood typing, along with phenotype and historical documentation have been used to confirm significant Spanish ancestry of a few BLM managed herds. In 1985, the BLM awarded a grant to the University of California, Davis, to conduct a three-year study on mustang genetics, including the percentage of original Spanish blood. Ann T. Bowling and R. W. Touchberry did not find much evidence of Spanish genetics in the Great Basin horses tested, but follow up work by Gus Cothran, then of University of Kentucky, carried on the study and found Spanish markers in the Pryor Mountain and Cerbat herds outside the Great Basin, and Sulphur Springs herd within it, later confirming the findings for the Sulphur Springs herd through mtDNA sequencing analysis. Some breeders and horse associations have used blood typing results to prove or disprove horses being of Spanish ancestry, but some horses of Spanish phenotype may not carry the expected Iberian blood markers. Conversely, some horses that lack Spanish type, such as certain strains of the American Quarter Horse, may have blood markers but not the proper phenotype.

Colonial Spanish horses include numerous strains, which may be feral populations or standardized breeds:

*Abaco Barb (extinct since 2015)
*Banker horse (eastern US; Corolla and Shackleford Islands)
*Carolina Marsh Tacky
*Florida Cracker Horse
*Baca-Chica
*Belsky horse
*Havapai (Grand Canyon Strain) 
*Spanish Mustang.
*Santa Cruz Island horse
*Wilbur-Cruce Mission horse
* Populations of mustangs considered to be Colonial Spanish strains:
**Kiger mustang
**Pryor Mountain mustang
**Sulphur Springs mustang
**Cerbat mustang
*Tribal Horses
**Chickasaw horse
**Choctaw horse
*Chincoteague pony (Assateague horse) – dubious, but widely asserted
*Gila Bend mustang
A number of breeds in Latin America with Iberian DNA markers are of Spanish type and origin. Many of these breeds come from different North American foundation bloodstock, and some have haplotypes not found in North America.

<text>Paul Damien Phillip Scally (born ) is a London-born businessman who served as the chairman of Gillingham Football Club between 1995 and 2022.

==Career==
Scally became wealthy through the sale of his Metronote photocopier business in South London and retired to study part-time for a law degree at Greenwich University. Prior to starting Metronote he &quot;owned a motor racing team, flew his own plane in his own flying club, ran &quot;LBC&quot;&#x27;s eye-in-the-sky traffic monitor and operated companies which dealt in everything from computers to champagne&quot;.

Scally bought Gillingham F.C. for the sum of £1 in 1995. In doing so, he took the Kent side out of administration, taking on debts of £1.5m to £2m shortly before they would have been placed into liquidation. His tenure is the most successful period in the club&#x27;s history, with three promotions, three Wembley play-off finals, four FA Cup victories over top division opponents, their furthest FA Cup run (quarter-final in 1999–2000), their joint-furthest League Cup runs (fourth round in 1996–97 and 2022-23) and their highest league finish of 11th in the Championship. At the time of his departure from the role Scally&#x27;s 27 years in charge of Gillingham made him second-longest serving Chairman in English football after Steve Gibson of Middlesbrough.

He has also overseen the radical redevelopment of the club&#x27;s Priestfield Stadium, adding a banqueting suite and a total of four new stands, three permanent and one temporary, transforming it into an all-seater arena. However the club&#x27;s fortunes both on and off the pitch took a downhill turn from about 2004, arising mainly from his overspending on the new stands and facilities, and also the loss of anticipated income following the collapse of ITV Digital.

Scally is the sole owner of Priestfield Developments Ltd., a company formed in 2007 with the sole purpose of purchasing Gillingham&#x27;s Priestfield Stadium for £9.8m as part of the restructuring of the club&#x27;s debts.

Having sought investment into the club for a number of years, he told &quot;BBC Sport&quot; in December 2021 that he had not &quot;yet come across anyone who will come in and take the club over - unless I stay and run it for them, or with them&quot;. In August 2022 Scally announced that he would taking an “extended break” and appointed the club&#x27;s former Finance Director Paul Fisher as co-chairman and chief executive, to handle the day to day running of the club. 

On 23 December 2022, US-based property magnate Brad Galinson purchased the majority shareholding in Gillingham Football Club Ltd, with Scally retaining a minority shareholding in the club and remaining a board member. Scally continued to serve as a director until he was voted out of the position by the shareholders in October 2024.

==Controversy==
Scally expressed desire to relocate the club from the town of Gillingham, possibly to a location away from the Medway Towns though still somewhere within the county of Kent, claiming &quot;The future of this football club is not at this stadium and everyone, if they are not stupid, accepts that is a fundamental point.&quot; 

He summarily dismissed manager Tony Pulis immediately after he had led the team to a Wembley Stadium play-off final in 1999, which brought about a protracted legal dispute over Pulis&#x27; contract. 

He has also become involved in a number of public disputes, most notably with several other Football League clubs over player transfers, the Kent Messenger Group of local newspapers (whose reporters he banned from the ground for several years for supposedly criticizing poor team performances), and Alan Liptrott, chairman of the Gills Independent Supporters Club, with whom he had several public disagreements, the largest over the ownership of an internet domain name, which led to Scally imposing a lifetime ban from Priestfield on Liptrott. However, on 8 February 2007, Scally unexpectedly rescinded the ban after approximately six years.

==Personal life==
Scally grew up in Blackheath, and prior to buying Gillingham had been a fan of Millwall.

As of 2009, Scally was non-resident in the UK for tax purposes, and resided in Dubai. 

He has been married three times and has had seven children. One of his sons died after a fall at the age of one, and another of a heart defect in 2003 at the age of 16 weeks. His surviving children comprise two daughters and three sons, one of whom was imprisoned for two years in January 2009 having been found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm to a 15 year old boy; another son, Adam, has been employed by the club as editor of Gillingham&#x27;s matchday programme.

<doc id="1206151" wikidata="Q6767537" url="?curid=1206151" title="Mark Essex">
<text>Mark James Robert Essex (August 12, 1949 – January 7, 1973) was an American serial sniper and black nationalist known as the &quot;New Orleans Sniper&quot; who killed a total of nine people, including five police officers, and wounded twelve others, in two separate attacks in New Orleans on December 31, 1972, and January 7, 1973. Essex was killed by police in the second armed confrontation.

Essex is believed to have specifically sought to kill white people and police officers due to racism he had previously experienced while enlisted in the Navy. His increasingly extremist anti-police, black supremacist, and anti-white views are believed to have solidified following a November 1972 violent clash between Baton Rouge sheriff&#x27;s deputies and student civil rights demonstrators, during which two young black demonstrators were shot and killed.

==Early life==
Mark James Robert Essex was born in Emporia, Kansas, the second of five children born to Mark Henry and Nellie (née Evans) Essex. He was raised in a close-knit and religious household. His father was a foreman in a meat-packing plant and his mother counseled preschool-age children in a program for disadvantaged children.

Emporia, the community in which Essex was raised, consisted of 19,000 people and prided itself in a long tradition of racial harmony. As a child and adolescent, Essex had numerous friends of all races and seldom, if ever, encountered any form of racism.

As a child, Essex developed a passion for the Cub Scouts and an aptitude for playing the saxophone in his high school band. He also developed a passion for hunting and fishing in the rivers and streams within and around the city, and developed ambitions to become a minister in his teens.

===Adolescence===
Essex was popular among his high school peers, and refrained from trouble as a teenager. His sole brush with Emporia police occurred in 1965, when an officer incorrectly assumed Essex—who stood just () tall—was too young to drive. He is known to have dated both black and white girls in high school, on one occasion telling his mother he did not &quot;see much difference&quot; between girls of different races. An average student who performed best in technical subjects, Essex graduated from Emporia High School in 1967.

Shortly after graduating from high school, Essex briefly enrolled at Emporia State University. He dropped out after just one semester, and briefly worked in the same meat-packing plant as his father as he considered his next career or educational move. Concluding his horizons were limited in Emporia, shortly after his 19th birthday, Essex decided to enlist in the United States Army. Upon the advice of his father, a World War II veteran, he instead opted to join the Navy and seek vocational training.

==Navy==
Essex enlisted the Navy on January 13, 1969, committing himself to a four-year contract at advanced pay. Within three months, he was assigned to the Naval Air Station at Imperial Beach, California. His family would later reflect that, as Essex prepared to enlist, he was &quot;happy go lucky&quot;.

Initially, Essex&#x27;s experiences in the Navy were positive. He performed his compulsory training at the Naval Training Center with exemplary results. His superiors recommended he enroll in the Navy Dental Center. Essex accepted this advice and was apprenticed as a dental technician in April 1969, specializing in endodontics and periodontics. He soon formed a close and ongoing friendship with his white supervisor, Lieutenant Robert Hatcher. However, Essex soon learned that bigotry from many of the white servicemen towards blacks (both overt and discreet) was a general everyday occurrence for blacks serving within the Navy. Shortly after his enlistment, Essex obtained a job as a bartender at an enlisted men&#x27;s club named the Jolly Rotor, where he discovered that certain rooms were off-limits to blacks. In one letter to his mother, Essex wrote his experiences of racial relations within the Navy were &quot;not like [he] thought [they] would be. Not like Emporia. Blacks have trouble getting along here.&quot;

Throughout 1969, Essex suffered these indignities quietly—apparently believing what he had been told by other black sailors: that he would be treated better once he achieved a higher rank. Within a year, he had risen to the rank of seaman, although the harassment continued, and he began taking sedatives. Shortly thereafter, Essex formed a close friendship with a black colleague named Rodney Frank; a self-described black militant who worked in the Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department. The two regularly socialized in their off-duty hours, and by the summer of 1970, Essex had become markedly radicalized. Frank also encouraged Essex to read literature about individuals such as Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, who together had founded the Black Panther Party.

Several months after Essex&#x27;s acquaintance with Frank, in August 1970, he became involved in a physical altercation with a white NCO moments after hearing the individual state his belief &quot;how beautiful&quot; it must have been in decades past when &quot;a nigger went to sea it was below decks, in the galley&quot;. Although Essex and his adversary agreed to a compromise to avoid either being admonished for the altercation, the fact he had struck a white sailor of senior rank increased the level of harassment and intimidation he was subjected to from white personnel. Two months later, on the morning of October 19, Essex went absent without leave (AWOL) from the Navy. He phoned his mother from a bus station, informing her: &quot;I&#x27;m coming home. I&#x27;ve just got to have some time to think.&quot;

===AWOL===
Essex returned via a Greyhound bus to Emporia, and remained AWOL until November 16, 1970. While AWOL, he repeatedly described to his family his experiences of overt discrimination at the hands of many of the white Navy sailors, his overt bitterness, and his resultant growing hatred towards the white race. Although his family attempted to reason with Essex against this viewpoint, Essex exclaimed: &quot;What else is there? They take everything from you. Your dignity, your pride. What can you do but hate them?&quot;

One month after his desertion from the Navy, Essex&#x27;s family persuaded him to return to Imperial Beach. Prior to doing so, Essex ensured he spoke to Lieutenant Hatcher, to whom he explained his reasons for his desertion. Hatcher&#x27;s official notes state Essex informed him: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to have anything more to do with the Navy. It wouldn&#x27;t be fair, not to you or the (dental) patients. The bad atmosphere would affect my work. The work is the only thing on this base I like.&quot; He then agreed to plead guilty to the charge of desertion.

At the subsequent hearing, Hatcher provided a vigorous defense of his protégé, praising his work ethic and stating the decision for his desertion had been influenced solely by ongoing racial discrimination. The judge conceded these factors were the cause and sentenced Essex to a lenient punishment of thirty days&#x27; restriction to base and forfeiture of $90 of his pay (the equivalent of about $ as of 2023) for two months.

==Military discharge==
===Radicalization===
Essex was given a general discharge from the Navy for general unsuitability on February 11, 1971, at the age of 21. This experience embittered Essex as he felt he had been unfairly stigmatized by the Navy, who had known only too well the discrimination he had endured. This led him to continue exploring Black Panther ideology. He soon began referring to himself as &quot;Mata&quot;, and embraced the extremist content of the 1968 book &quot;Black Rage&quot;.

===Emporia===
Sometime around late-April 1971, Essex returned to his family in Emporia. Two months later, he purchased a Ruger .44-caliber semi-automatic carbine via mail-order from an Emporia Montgomery Ward outlet. Upon receiving the weapon several weeks later, he began incessantly target shooting in the countryside around Emporia in efforts to improve his marksmanship. That August, he abruptly left his family home without even informing his parents and drove to Louisiana. The precise reason for his relocation is unknown, although he may have chosen to relocate to this city to become reacquainted with Rodney Frank.

===New Orleans===
Essex moved home four times between 1971 and 1972 before relocating to a two-room apartment at 2619 Dryades Street in Central City in early November 1972, and saw first-hand the poverty of those living in the city&#x27;s housing projects. On August 22, 1972, he applied for admittance into the Total Community Action (TCA) federally funded program. He was accepted into the program, and chose to enroll in classes specializing in vending machine repair. Essex quickly rose to the top of his class. He also began a course of African studies in 1972, and would memorize African terms and dialects as he sat alone in his apartment. Many of the words, phrases and hate slogans he familiarized himself with—in English, Swahili, and Zulu—would be daubed across the walls and ceilings of his apartment.

By the summer of 1972, Essex had acquired a further firearm: a Colt .38-caliber revolver. He was also living an increasingly solitary existence, and battling severe depression.

In September 1972, the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) announced the formation of the Felony Action Squad, aimed at reducing the number of violent crimes in the city. In a press statement, Superintendent Clarence Giarrusso stated that, if threatened in any way, members of this action squad were authorized to shoot to kill. The following month, Essex paid a surprise visit to his family in Emporia. His demeanor was upbeat and enthusiastic, leading his parents to believe he had recovered from his bitter experiences in the Navy.

===Southern University civil rights shootings===
On November 16, Essex learned that two 20-year-old African American students, Leonard Douglas Brown and Denver A. Smith, had been shot to death by East Baton Rouge Parish sheriff&#x27;s deputies during a campus demonstration at Southern University (a historically black university) in the Scotlandville neighborhood of Baton Rouge. Essex was disturbed and outraged by the harsh response of police to this student civil rights demonstration. This incident is believed to be that which fueled his decision to act against police oppression.

Shortly after this incident, Essex penned a letter to his mother in which he wrote: &quot;Africa, this is it, mom. It&#x27;s even bigger than you and I, even bigger than God. I have now decided that the white man is my enemy. I will fight to gain my manhood or die trying. Love, Jimmy.&quot; On Christmas Day, he ate dinner with the family of a fellow student from the TCA program. That evening, Essex phoned his family. He made a specific point of talking to each family member in succession, and conveyed no sense of distress. Over the following days, Essex gave away most of his possessions to acquaintances and neighbors, falsely claiming he intended to return to Emporia.

Days before New Year&#x27;s Eve, Essex wrote a letter addressed to WWL-TV, signed &quot;Mata&quot;, in which he described his intentions to attack the New Orleans Police Department on December 31. He cited the primary justification for his impending attack as being vengeance for the deaths of the &quot;two innocent brothers&quot; killed in the Southern University civil rights demonstration the previous month.

==Sniper attacks==
===New Year&#x27;s Eve 1972===
At approximately 10:55 p.m. on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1972, Essex parked his car and walked along Perdido Street, a block from the NOPD, armed with his Ruger .44-caliber semi-automatic carbine, his .38-caliber revolver, a large supply of ammunition, a gas mask, wire cutters, lighter fluid, matches, and a string of firecrackers all stashed inside a green duffel bag. He hid behind parked cars in a poorly illuminated parking lot across from the busy central lockup and began firing at a 19-year-old cadet, named Bruce Weatherford, as he walked toward the gatehouse to report for duty. Weatherford instinctively dove for cover behind a parked car, and then turned to see the fellow cadet he was relieving, 19-year-old Alfred Harrell, run across the sally port to his aid. Essex then shot Harrell once through the chest. He also wounded Lt. Horace Pérez in the attack; Pérez was wounded in the ankle by the same bullet which struck Harrell and ricocheted off a wall. Harrell was black; before beginning his attacks, Essex had specifically stated his intention to kill &quot;just honkies.&quot;

Having fired six rounds in this initial stage of his attack, Essex fled by climbing a chain link fence and running across the I-10 expressway, having detonated several firecrackers as a diversion. He ran into an industrial area of Gert Town; an area known for high crime and hostility towards police. There he first attempted to gain entrance to a building located at 4100 Euphrosine Street by shooting four .44 rounds from his carbine at the door before successfully breaking into the Burkart Manufacturing Building; a warehouse and manufacturing plant on the corner of Euphrosine and South Gayoso. Intentionally or otherwise, this action activated an alarm that alerted police to this break-in. A K-9 unit, led by Officers Edwin Hosli Sr. and Harold Blappert, responded to the call. Neither realized this incident was connected to the earlier attack on central lockup.

The two officers circled the building, looking for signs of forced entry before parking in front of the building. As Officer Hosli exited his vehicle to retrieve his German Shepherd from the car&#x27;s back seat at 11:13 p.m., Essex shot him once in the back. Officer Hosli would die of his injuries on March 5.

Essex then fired several further rounds at the car, shattering the windshield. Officer Blappert reached for the radio on the front seat and called for back-up. Blappert then fired four shots at the spot where he saw muzzle flashes from Essex&#x27;s rifle and pulled his partner onto the front seat, waiting for back-up. Within minutes of Blappert&#x27;s call, over thirty armed police officers arrived at the warehouse; they sent two dogs into the building to search for Essex, but he had already escaped. Spots of blood on the ground beside a discarded Colt .38 revolver, multiple discarded rounds of live ammunition, and a bloody hand print found upon a window sill within the Burkart Building indicated Essex had received a wound—likely not a serious one—in his exchange with Blappert.

===Initial manhunt===
Although police extensively searched the neighborhood for the sniper(s), and conducted house-to-house searches, their quarry had escaped. The search ended shortly after 9 a.m. on January 1, 1973, following complaints from several local residents pertaining to officers&#x27; heavy-handed tactics.

The decision to terminate the search for the perpetrator(s) was made moments after police discovered two carefully placed live rounds pointing at the doors of the 1st New St. Mark Baptist Church (approximately two blocks from the Burkart Building).

===January 1–6, 1973===
At 9 p.m. on January 1, the pastor of the 1st New St. Mark Baptist Church entered his place of worship to find a young, armed black male inside. The pastor fled to a neighbor&#x27;s house and called police, although by the time police arrived, the individual had fled. A subsequent police investigation would determine Essex later returned to the church and remained at this site until January 3. He was observed by a 33-year-old local grocer named Joseph Perniciaro entering his premises, Joe&#x27;s Grocery, with a bloodstained bandage on his left hand on the evening of January 2. Perniciaro sold several provisions including food and a razor to Essex. Convinced Essex was involved in nefarious behavior, Perniciaro then ordered his stock boy to follow him. The stock boy reported Essex had walked across the street and into the local church.

Perniciaro reported this information to police. When police arrived to search the premises on the evening of January 3, Essex had fled, although bloodstains and food wrappings indicated a wounded individual had been living in the premises for a short period of time. A bag containing several .38 caliber cartridges was also found hidden in a bathroom alongside a letter penned by Essex to the minister apologizing for breaking into the church.

Essex&#x27;s movements between the evening of January 3 and the morning of January 7, 1973, are unknown, although an official police investigation later concluded he had not returned to his apartment and was most likely hiding at an unknown location close to the church.
===January 7, 1973===
At 10:15 a.m. on January 7, 1973, Essex returned to Joe&#x27;s Grocery and shouted to Joseph Perniciaro, &quot;You! Come here!&quot; When Perniciaro attempted to flee, Essex shot and severely wounded him with his .44 Magnum carbine. He then carjacked a 30-year-old black motorist named Marvin Albert as he sat in his 1968 Chevrolet Chevelle outside his house on South White Street, shouting: &quot;Hi brother. Get out [of] the car. I don&#x27;t want to kill you, but I&#x27;ll kill you too!&quot;

Essex drove Albert&#x27;s vehicle to the 17-story Downtown Howard Johnson&#x27;s Hotel at 330 Loyola Avenue in New Orleans&#x27; Central Business District, across the street from City Hall and Orleans Parish Civil District Court. He parked the vehicle on the fourth level of the hotel&#x27;s garage and climbed the fire escape stairs directly across from the garage in an effort to gain illegal entry via an unlocked door, but each successive door he attempted to open, he discovered to be locked. As Essex attempted to enter the eighth floor via this method, he exclaimed to two hotel maids: &quot;Let me in, sisters. I&#x27;ve got something to do.&quot; The two women refused, citing hotel regulations. As Essex ran up the stairs to the ninth floor, the two women observed the rifle in his hands and ran to alert management of the impending threat.

Gaining entry to the hotel via a door on the 18th and top floor which had been propped open with a stack of linen, Essex first encountered three African American employees of the hotel. He immediately said to one of these individuals: &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, sister. We&#x27;re only shooting whites today.&quot; These employees also ran to notify authorities.

In the hallway by room 1829, Essex encountered 28-year-old Dr. Robert Steagall, who observed Essex and exclaimed, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; As Essex raised his rifle, Steagall lunged at him. Following a brief struggle in which he was shot through the arm, Steagall was knocked to the floor and fatally shot through the chest. His 25-year-old wife, Elizabeth, screamed &quot;Please don&#x27;t kill my husband!&quot; As she attempted to cradle her husband&#x27;s body, Essex shot her once through the base of her skull, killing her almost instantly.

Essex then entered the Steagalls&#x27; room; he soaked telephone books with lighter fluid and set them ablaze beneath the curtains before dropping a Pan-African flag onto the floor beside the bodies of the couple as he ran toward one of the hotel&#x27;s interior stairwells.

On the 11th floor, Essex entered several vacant rooms and ignited more fires—likely by burning bedding within the rooms (the draperies within the hotel rooms were fire retardant). He also shot and killed the hotel&#x27;s assistant manager, 62-year-old Frank Schneider, who had proceeded to the 11th floor to investigate employees&#x27; reports of an armed intruder on this floor. Immediately prior to encountering Essex, Schneider and a porter named Donald Roberts had exited an elevator before a hysterical black maid named Beatrice Greenhouse attempted to warn the two men of the intruder&#x27;s intentions. As both turned to run, Essex raised his rifle and fatally shot Schneider in the back of the head; Roberts reached the safety of a nearby stairwell. He ran to a payphone and notified police.

Essex then ignited another fire on the 11th floor before descending to the 10th floor, where he encountered the hotel&#x27;s general manager, Walter Collins, attempting to warn guests about the spreading fires. Essex shot and fatally wounded Collins, who shouted to a guest to shut her door and call the police. Collins then crawled to a stairwell. He would die of his injuries on January 26.

===Police response===
Shortly after 11 a.m., two young patrolmen named Michael Burl and Robert Childress arrived at the hotel in response to initial reports of an armed individual roaming the premises. The two began an ascending floor-to-floor search. On one of the lower floors, they encountered Beatrice Greenhouse, who informed them the perpetrator was on one of the upper floors. In an error of judgment, the two ascended to the 18th floor in an elevator, which halted close to the top floor due to smoke in the elevator shaft. At about the same time, Essex shot 43-year-old hotel guest and broadcasting executive Robert Beamish in the stomach as he walked close to the eighth-floor swimming plaza. Beamish fell into the swimming pool, but he realized he was not badly hurt. He remained in the water for almost two hours before he was rescued.

By 11:20 a.m. scores of police officers and firefighters had converged at the hotel, and Superintendent Giarrusso had established a command post on the ground floor of the hotel. Giarrusso ordered marksmen deployed at various strategic positions around the hotel. Within the hour, he ordered a room-by-room search for the perpetrator. Several firefighters attempted to rescue guests who had fled to the hotel balconies to escape both the gunman and the numerous fires he had started; efforts to rescue these individuals were hampered both by Essex pinning down emergency responders to the scene with his firearm, and conflicting descriptions as to his height and clothing which led responders to believe there may be more than one gunman.

One of the first firemen to arrive at the hotel, 29-year-old Timothy Ursin, attempted to ascend to a balcony to rescue guests; he was followed by two patrolmen—one of whom observed Essex lean from a balcony and shoot Ursin through the shoulder. Ursin fell into the arms of one patrolman as his colleague—further down the ladder—returned fire at Essex. Ursin would survive, although he would lose one of his arms. As paramedics placed Ursin in an ambulance, Essex wounded 20-year-old Christopher Caton, the driver, with a shot in the back.

Minutes later, a patrolman named Charles Arnold obtained a strategic position offering a prime view of the hotel from an office complex across the street. As Arnold opened a window to afford a clear view, a single bullet tore into his jaw, sending him sprawling backwards onto a desk. Arnold pressed a towel against his wound and walked to the nearby Charity Hospital to seek treatment for his wound. He would also survive his injury. Shortly thereafter, Essex shot and wounded a 33-year-old sheriff&#x27;s deputy named David Munch in the leg and neck as he also took aim at the hotel from the eighth floor of the nearby Rault Center.
At 11:55 a.m., patrolmen Kenneth Solis and David McCann attempted to dispel a crowd of spectators from a plaza north of the hotel. As the two walked from beneath a canopy of trees to reach a crowd of onlookers, Solis was shot in the right shoulder, with the bullet exiting beneath his lower rib cage. McCann immediately carried Solis back beneath the view of the tree canopy and out of Essex&#x27;s view. As Solis fell, a 43-year-old police officer named Emanuel Palmisano ran to his aid, only to be shot in his arm and back. A 26-year-old patrolman named Phillip Coleman—responding to Palmisano&#x27;s cries for help—drove his patrol car onto the plaza. As Coleman rolled out of the driver&#x27;s seat and opened the rear door in order that Palmisano and Solis could be transported to Charity Hospital, Essex fatally shot him in the head.

Essex then descended to the fourth floor parking lot, possibly with intentions to flee the hotel in the vehicle he had stolen that morning. Here he shot at, and missed, two police officers he observed standing guard inside the hotel&#x27;s parking lot. He then returned to the 16th floor where he observed a 33-year-old traffic officer named Paul Persigo attempting to divert onlookers to safety outside the hotel. Essex fatally shot Persigo in the mouth. According to several eyewitnesses, Persigo staggered several feet before falling to the sidewalk. He was pronounced dead on arrival at Charity Hospital.

Shortly after noon, Deputy Superintendent Louis Sirgo organized a rescue party of three men to free patrolmen Burl and Childress, who were believed still to be trapped inside an elevator shaft close to the 18th floor. At approximately 1:07 p.m., while approaching the 16th floor, Sirgo and his colleagues heard what they believed to be a police whistle sourcing from this floor. Believing this whistling sound to source from the two trapped patrolmen, the four officers ascended further. As Sirgo turned the final corner of the staircase, Essex shot him once at almost point-blank range through the chest, exposing his spine and causing Sirgo to fall backwards onto his colleagues. Essex immediately turned and ran in the direction of the hotel roof. Sirgo would be pronounced dead on arrival at Charity Hospital.

==Final standoff==
At approximately 2 p.m., Essex—by this stage having depleted his portable cache of firecrackers and ammunition—took cover in a concrete cubicle on the southeast side of the hotel roof. Over the following hours, he repeatedly shot at a CH-46 military helicopter piloted by Lt. Colonel Charles Pitman, a pilot in the United States Marine Corps who, without obtaining prior clearance, had flown to the location to assist police in their efforts to kill the sniper or snipers. Pitman first landed the helicopter near the hotel, allowing five police sharpshooters to board. This helicopter subsequently performed several strafe runs over the hotel roof over the following hours, and Pitman later stated his hope to at least strike Essex with a ricochet, although it is unknown whether Essex was wounded in any of these exchanges. In each instance Pitman flew away from the hotel to reload, Essex returned fire at the helicopter.
Initially, Superintendent Giarrusso was reluctant to place any further officers at risk of injury or death by deploying them to the hotel roof. His strategy was to keep the sniper pinned in the cubicle in an effort to erode his morale. After several hours, in a last-ditch effort to persuade Essex to surrender, Giarrusso ordered a black police officer to communicate with Essex via a battery-operated bullhorn. This officer attempted to persuade Essex to surrender for several minutes, ending his efforts by saying: &quot;What do you say, brother? Why not save yourself? Give up before it&#x27;s too late. If you&#x27;re wounded, we can get you medical help.&quot; In response, Essex screamed, &quot;Power to the people!&quot;

Although this intermediary officer responded to this gesture by saying &quot;Come on down, man. Don&#x27;t die. Don&#x27;t make us kill you&quot;, Essex refused to speak any other words.

Shortly before 9 p.m., after almost seven hours crouched in the cubicle, Essex suddenly charged into the open with his rifle at waist height and his right fist aloft, shouting &quot;Come and get me!&quot; before being almost immediately shot by police sharpshooters positioned on the roofs of adjacent buildings. The military helicopter, which had just approached to begin a further strafe operation, also fired scores of rounds into Essex&#x27;s body. The momentum of the bullets propelled his body vertically several feet before Essex fell on his back approximately twenty feet from the cubicle, having failed to kill or wound any further officers in this final act. The barrage of gunfire would continue for almost four minutes. An autopsy later revealed Essex had received more than 200 gunshot wounds.

An examination of Essex&#x27;s rifle revealed he had only two remaining bullets at the time of his dash from the cubicle, indicating his final act was likely one of symbolic suicide.

In part due to conflicting reports as to the possibility of a further sniper or snipers, twenty-eight hours would elapse between the beginning of Essex&#x27;s siege at the hotel and police determining no further assailants remained at the scene. Ballistic tests upon Essex&#x27;s rifle would determine his weapon was the same as that used in the December 31 NOPD central lockup and Burkart Manufacturing Building shootings.

==Funeral==
Days after Essex&#x27;s death, his body was returned to his family in Kansas. His funeral was held at the St. James Church in Emporia on 13 January. His family authorized two wreaths to be placed upon his coffin. One wreath simply bore his childhood name: &quot;Jimmy&quot;. The second wreath bore the slogan &quot;Power to the People&quot;.

Shortly before Essex&#x27;s funeral, Essex&#x27;s family granted an interview to the media in which they stated the seeds of Essex&#x27;s rage lay in the discrimination he had endured while serving in the Navy, whom they accused of ultimately causing the radicalization in their son and brother. Furthermore, his mother stated that, although the family had been aware of extreme radical changes in Essex&#x27;s attitude towards white people following his experiences in the Navy, they had not been aware of his plans, although his actions revealed he had viewed himself as something of a martyr for his cause. According to his younger sister, Penny Fox: &quot;He didn&#x27;t want to see kids grow up to be oppressed by the white man. He really believed in the Black Power Revolution. He wanted to change it himself now, not wait another five hundred years.&quot;

==Victims==
In both incidents, Essex shot a total of 21 people, nine of whom died. Two patrolmen were also hospitalized due to smoke inhalation received prior to and during their climbing down an elevator shaft to escape from a smoke-filled elevator stranded close to the 18th floor of the hotel. Seven other officers were slightly injured in crossfire in the final standoff with Essex.

In total, ten of those shot in both incidents were policemen, five of whom died. All but one of those shot were Caucasian or Hispanic.

==Aftermath==
Two days after Essex&#x27;s death, police visited the two-room apartment in which he had resided in the two months prior to his death. Officers discovered Essex had painted across all windows to the apartment and further covered the windows with bedding in order that no natural light could penetrate into the apartment. The sole source of light into both rooms was provided by a single red bulb, and the sole remaining furniture was a single waterbed. A map of New Orleans with a large circle drawn around the police headquarters and the Howard Johnson&#x27;s Hotel was found on the floor. The walls of both rooms were covered in bold red and black lettering depicting racial and revolutionary slogans in both the English and several Bantu languages. Other slogans simply listed beasts from African folklore. Beneath one rallying slogan, Essex had painted the words: &quot;My destiny lies in the bloody death of racist pigs.&quot; Another inscription read: &quot;The Third World – Kill Pig Nixon and his Running Dogs.&quot;
In the weeks following Essex&#x27;s massacre, several prominent individuals within New Orleans&#x27; black community were interviewed with regards to the underlying motives behind his murders. Louisiana State Representative Louis Charbonnet would later reflect that the general media questioning of New Orleans&#x27; black community made several individuals feel people &quot;wanted to hear the black community of New Orleans apologize for [Essex&#x27;s actions].&quot; Charbonnet elaborated: &quot;Here was a boy from Kansas who came here and vented his frustration in a suicide mission. What could I say about him? The black community in New Orleans did not invite him here; nor did we send him up to that rooftop.&quot;

Several months after Essex&#x27;s death, an eminent sociologist would state Essex&#x27;s idyllic upbringing in Emporia—a community which had prided itself in a long history of racial harmony—had left Essex ill-prepared to encounter intolerance and continuous racial discrimination as a young adult as he had not been &quot;vaccinated&quot; against the harsh realities of bigotry as a youngster.

One of the police officers killed in Essex&#x27;s attack at the Downtown Howard Johnson&#x27;s Hotel, Deputy Superintendent Louis Sirgo, had previously and publicly proclaimed that the most effective way to eliminate extremism within New Orleans was to end the social conditions that nourished social discontent within the black community. Just months prior to his death, Sirgo had described the mistreatment of black people in the city and nationwide as &quot;the greatest sin of American society.&quot;

For decades after her husband&#x27;s death, Sirgo&#x27;s wife, Joyce, annually presented the Louis Sirgo Memorial Award to the most promising recruit of the NOPD academy, selected by his or her fellow recruits.

The Downtown Howard Johnson&#x27;s Hotel is now a Holiday Inn hotel.

<doc id="1206157" wikidata="Q7790829" url="?curid=1206157" title="Thomas Horton (soldier)">
<text>Colonel Thomas Horton, January 1603 to October 1649, was a member of the minor gentry from Leicestershire who served in the Parliamentarian army during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. Like many other of those who approved the Execution of Charles I in January 1649, Horton was a religious Independent. His family was closely connected to Sir Arthur Haselrig, one of the Five Members whose attempted arrest by Charles I in January 1642 was a major step on the road to the First English Civil War.

During the 1648 Second English Civil War, Horton played a significant role in ending the revolt in South Wales, and was rewarded with grants of land in Pembrokeshire. In August 1649, his regiment was selected for service in Ireland; he died of disease at Wexford in October, and has no known grave.

==Personal details==
Thomas Horton was born in Gumley, Leicestershire, second son of William Horton (1576-1638) and Isabell Freeman (died after 1649). In 1608, William purchased lands in Gumley, and thus ranked as a member of the minor gentry. Thomas was one of eight surviving children, including his elder brother John (died before 1664), James, Andrew (died after 1662), Robert (died before 1649), William (1613-after 1651), Elizabeth and Mary. Based on legal documents, with the exception of Robert, all were still alive in 1649, but there are few other details available. 

In 1645, he married the daughter of John and Margaret St Loe; she presumably died soon after, as unlike her parents, she is not mentioned in his will, who are named as guardians of his son Thomas. It is suggested this is the Thomas Horton who emigrated to Milton, Massachusetts, and died in Rehoboth, Massachusetts in 1710. 

==Career==
Little is known of Horton&#x27;s career prior to 1642, except for the fact he was connected to the local magnate, Sir Arthur Haselrig. It is often suggested he served him as a falconer, but documents relating to property transactions confirm his status as a minor landowner. Along with Oliver Cromwell, John Pym, and other prominent Puritans, Haselrig was associated with the Saybrook Colony, established in what is now Connecticut. Based on Thomas&#x27; 1649 will, it appears Horton advanced his youngest brother William £50 to emigrate there in 1635.

===First English Civil War===
One of the Five Members whose attempted arrest in January 1642 led to the First English Civil War, Haselrig raised a regiment when war began in August. Known as the &#x27;London Lobsters&#x27;, due to their distinctive armour, Horton was commissioned into this regiment as a cornet, and fought at Edgehill in October 1642. Promoted captain-lieutenant in 1643, he served in William Waller&#x27;s army throughout 1643 and 1644, including the major battles of Lansdowne, Roundway Down, Cheriton, and Second Newbury.

When the New Model Army was formed in 1645, Haselrig&#x27;s unit became Colonel John Butler&#x27;s Regiment of Horse, with Horton as his deputy. He was badly wounded at the Battle of Naseby in June, but returned to serve in the 1645-1646 Western Campaign, including the battles of Langport and Torrington. The war ended in June 1646, with the surrender of Oxford.

===Second English Civil War===
Arguments over the settlement with Charles led to internal conflict between Parliamentarian moderates, mostly socially conservative Presbyterians, and radicals, many of whom were religious Independents. This included Baptists, a sect that was particularly prominent in the New Model; both Horton and his close friend, Colonel John Phillips, were members of a Baptist congregation established in Cardiff in 1649. 

The economic cost of the war, a poor 1646 harvest, and recurrence of the plague meant Parliament could not meet all of its obligations. One reason the New Model favoured the radicals was because they supported full payment of their wage arrears, which by March 1647 had reached the then enormous sum of £3 million. Horton signed his regiment&#x27;s &#x27;Petition of Grievances&#x27; in May, and after Butler resigned in June, replaced him as Colonel.

The relationship between Parliament and the Army Council continued to deteriorate, leading to the eviction of the Eleven Members in July, and the occupation of London by the New Model. Another area of concern was Wales, then held by the Western Association army, under John Poyer and Rowland Laugharne, who supported the Parliamentarian moderates. By early 1647, there were considerable doubts over their reliability. 

From 1642 to 1646, most of the area had been Royalist, while Harlech Castle only surrendered in March 1647. Concerns over its security increased when secret messages between Charles and the Irish Confederacy were intercepted, since Cardiff and Milford Haven could be used to transfer troops from Confederacy ports like Wexford. At the end of July 1647, Horton and a small New Model detachment was sent to South Wales, to monitor the situation.

By March 1648, Poyer&#x27;s troops had not been paid for eighteen months, and he refused to hand over Pembroke Castle until their arrears had been settled. As Horton reported to London, the local populace were also furious at having to pay taxes to support an unwanted army in their area. What began as a wage dispute led to open revolt in April, when Poyer, Laugharne and Rice Powell declared their support for restoring Charles, beginning the Second English Civil War. They assembled an army of around 8,000, hoping to destroy Horton&#x27;s smaller force of 3,000 before he could be reinforced by Cromwell. In contrast to Horton&#x27;s experienced veterans, most of the Royalist troops were untrained and poorly armed; he won an easy victory at St Fagans on 8 May.

Shortly after this victory, Cromwell arrived in Wales with another 6,500 men, and besieged Pembroke Castle; after capturing Tenby, Horton joined him there at the end of May. The siege was delayed by a month while they waited for the artillery train to arrive; once it did, Poyer surrendered soon after, on 11 July.

===War in Ireland===
In 1645, Laugharne had been rewarded for his service with lands confiscated from a Welsh Royalist, John Barlow of Slebech; these were now given to Horton and Phillips, along with several others. The two were also put in charge of collecting a fine of £20,000, levied on Welsh Royalists. In January 1649, Horton was appointed to the High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I, and signed the warrant for his execution.

Shortly after this, he was appointed Commissioner for South Wales, but in July, his regiment was one of those chosen to fight in Ireland. He landed in Dublin in September, and took part in the siege of Wexford, from 2 to 11 October. In a letter dated 25 October, Cromwell wrote Horton &#x27;is lately dead of the country-disease&#x27;, usually thought to refer to dysentery, a common disease caused by poor hygiene. His grave has since been lost.

In 1654, Parliament approved a payment to his executors of £1,454 in back pay; as a regicide, his heirs were deprived of their estate at the 1660 Restoration, although this could not have been substantial, while it seems likely his son had already emigrated.

According to a Metal Hammer article on the band; &quot;Error came about when Atticus realised his cocking about in the studio had produced something along the lines of actual songs.&quot; Atticus recruited his younger brother Leopold Ross to play drums and Bad Religion member and Epitaph Records owner Brett Gurewitz to play guitar and bass.

Dillinger Escape Plan frontman Greg Puciato was also recruited to perform vocals on the band&#x27;s first release, but he is only considered to be a temporary member. The band released its first record, a self-titled EP, in 2004. The EP features The Locust&#x27;s keyboardist Joey Karam playing a Moog synthesizer on the track &quot;Jack The Ripper&quot;. Prior to the EP&#x27;s release, Error released a remix of the Transplants&#x27; song on Punk-O-Rama 8 in 2003 entitled &quot;Quick Death (Error Remix)&quot;.

Error was reported to be looking for a full-time vocalist for touring and for an upcoming album, however the future of the band has been a topic for discussion on many internet message boards. No further news has been released on the status of the new album, however as the first EP was created with virtually no outside knowledge, the album may be similarly produced behind closed doors.

Around 2005, Error recorded a new song, titled &quot;Wild World&quot;, that appears on a tribute album to The Birthday Party called &quot;Release the Bats: The Birthday Party as Heard Through the Meat Grinder of Three One G&quot;, which was released on April 4, 2006. The song is available on iTunes. Leo Ross is the vocalist on this release, the track was also mixed by Atticus&#x27;s long-time engineer Doug Trantow.

As of 2009, it is unlikely that Error will return anytime in the future. Gurewitz has continued touring and making records with Bad Religion and the Ross brothers have been busy with their own projects. In a 2011 interview with Greg Puciato, he discussed the possibility of doing a second EP with Error, however, Puciato later contradicted this statement, confirming in 2012 that Error is &quot;dead as of now&quot;.

<text> (; Northern Bavarian: &quot;Wåuṉsieḏl&quot; or &quot;Wousigl&quot;) is the seat of the Upper Franconian district of in northeast Bavaria, Germany. The town is the birthplace of poet Jean Paul. It also became known for its annual Festival and the Rudolf Hess Memorial March held there by Neo-Nazis until 2005.

== Geography ==

== History ==

 was first mentioned in 1163 as the seat of a , Adelbertus or Albert. The name probably originates from (&#x27;glades&#x27;) and (&#x27;noble seat&#x27;). In 1285, Burgrave Friedrich III of Nuremberg received the fiefdom of the town from King Rudolph I of Habsburg. In 1326, was given town rights by Burgrave Friedrich IV and this was confirmed in 1328 by Emperor Louis the Bavarian. In 1430 Hans of defeated the Hussites in the Battle of , a low mountain immediately south of , and in 1652 Jobst of beat the Bohemians also on the .

In the Middle Ages, was a centre of tin mining and achieved great economic importance through the manufacture of tin plate. In 1613, it became capital of the  — an area comparable in size to the modern district . The bailiffs () in , , , and were all subordinated to the high bailiff () in .

 was a part of the Principality of Bayreuth until 1791/92 when the last margrave, Karl Alexander, abdicated and the region was placed under Prussian administration. It was occupied for four years by Napoleon&#x27;s troops and, in 1810, became part of the Kingdom of Bavaria.

Fires in 1476, 1547, 1607, 1636, 1644, 1646, 1657 and 1731 destroyed various parts of the town. After the last major fire in 1834, which razed two-thirds of , the town was rebuilt in a classicist style.

Birthplace of the nationalist student (October 5, 1795) who later went on to assassinate , a famous conservative German playwright. Kotzebue&#x27;s death was a direct result of his published ridicule of the student associations in general, however focusing harshest comments on the newly formed , student organizations that supported free institutions, a national German state, uncensored press. In addition, the affluent writer was appointed as Russia&#x27;s &quot;ambassador&quot; (by Russia) making his death a certainty. In his role as ambassador, Kotzebue was accused as being a &quot;spy&quot; while his role as editor of a literature review magazine brought him accusation of outright plagiarism. In 1817 at the Wartburg Castle, during a gathering of students, the burning of his published works with those of other &quot;enemies&quot; brought him to the attention of the young Karl Sand. In retrospect, a case for post traumatic stress syndrome, as a complicating factor, could probably be made as Karl Sand witnessed, helplessly, the drowning of his good friend just months prior to the murder.

After World War II, was part of the American Zone and a was installed at the at the .

=== Wunsiedel and Rudolf Hess ===

In the late 1980s, the cemetery of became rather infamous after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s deputy Rudolf Hess, who had died in a Berlin prison on 17 August 1987, was buried there. In the years that followed, neo-nazi groups organized memorial marches on each 17 August. The number of participants rose from 120 in 1988 to more than 1,100 in 1990. The gatherings faced protests from anti-fascist groups. Neo-Nazi marches were banned in 1991.

Under the impression that the situation had &quot;cooled down&quot;, the Bavarian Administrative Court permitted the gatherings again in 2001. The result was unexpected: neo-nazi groups managed to amass more and more people, the peak being reached in 2004, when over 4,500 participants from all over Europe assembled in . The anti-fascist initiative &quot;&quot; (&#x27; is colourful, not brown&#x27;) organised a counter-demonstration with about 800 participants, decorating the city with rainbow flags and spraying the marchers with confetti. The initiative later received the for commitment and bravery awarded by the German federal ministers and .

In 2005, the memorial march was banned for the first time on the basis of article 130 of the German criminal code, which outlaws incitement of the people. A complaint against the ban was rejected by the Federal Constitutional Court. Nevertheless, more than 2,500 people met on August 20, 2005, to celebrate a &quot;Day of Democracy&quot; in .

The town decided to have the Hess grave removed in 2011. The family of Rudolf Hess arranged with the cemetery to have Hess’s remains exhumed, cremated and scattered at sea to deter any further pilgrimages to his grave. The gravestone with the words &quot;&quot; (&#x27;I have dared&#x27;) was removed and destroyed. Smaller neo-Nazi marches continued afterward, leading the human-rights group to organise a charity drive whereby a certain sum of money would be donated to the organisation , which helps neo-Nazis leave the movement, for each meter marched.

<text>4-Acetoxy-DET (4-Acetoxy-&quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-diethyltryptamine), also known as ethacetin, ethylacybin or 4-AcO-DET, is a psychedelic tryptamine. It was first synthesized in 1958 by Albert Hofmann in the Sandoz lab.

It is expected that the compound is quickly hydrolyzed into the free phenolic 4-HO-DET by serum esterases, but human studies concerning the metabolic fate of this drug are lacking.

==Dosage==
4-Acetoxy-DET is orally active, and dosages of 10–25 mg are common. Effects last 4–6 hours. The free base is also active when smoked in a dose range of 5–20 mg. Smoking 4-acetoxy-DET greatly speeds up the onset; peak effects are experienced within 10 minutes, and are usually over within 1 hour.

==Drug prohibition laws==

===Sweden===
&quot;Sveriges riksdags&quot; health ministry &quot;Statens folkhälsoinstitut&quot; classified 4-AcO-DET as &quot;health hazard&quot; under the act &quot;Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor&quot; (translated &quot;Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health&quot;) as of Nov 1, 2005, in their regulation SFS 2005:733 listed as 4-acetoxi-N,N-dietyltryptamin (4-AcO-DET), making it illegal to sell or possess.

<doc id="1206180" wikidata="Q5156007" url="?curid=1206180" title="Comparison of synchronous and asynchronous signalling">
<text>Synchronous and asynchronous transmissions are two different methods of transmission synchronization. Synchronous transmissions are synchronized by an external clock, while asynchronous transmissions are synchronized by special signals along the transmission medium.

==The need for synchronization==
Whenever an electronic device transmits digital (and sometimes analogue) data to another, there must be a certain rhythm established between the two devices, i.e., the receiving device must have some way of, within the context of the fluctuating signal that it&#x27;s receiving, determining where each unit of data begins and where it ends.

==Methods of synchronization==
There are two ways to synchronize the two ends of the communication.

The synchronous signalling methods use two different signals.
A pulse on one signal indicates when another bit of information is ready on the other signal.

The asynchronous signalling methods use only one signal.
The receiver uses transitions on that signal to figure out the transmitter bit rate (&quot;autobaud&quot;) and timing, and set a local clock to the proper timing, typically using a phase-locked loop (PLL) to synchronize with the transmission rate.
A pulse from the local clock indicates when another bit is ready.

===Synchronous transmission===
In synchronous communications, the stream of data to be transferred is encoded as fluctuating voltage levels in one wire (the &#x27;DATA&#x27;), and a periodic pulse of voltage on a separate wire (called the &quot;CLOCK&quot; or &quot;STROBE&quot;) which tells the receiver &quot;the current DATA bit is &#x27;valid&#x27; at this moment in time&quot;.

Practically all parallel communications protocols use synchronous transmission. For example, in a computer, address information is transmitted synchronously—the address bits over the address bus, and the read or write strobes of the control bus.

A logical one is indicated when there are two transitions in the same time frame as a zero. In the Manchester coding a transition from low to high indicates a one and a transition from high to low indicates a zero. When there are successive ones or zeros, an opposite transition is required on the edge of the time frame to prepare for the next transition and signal.

===Asynchronous transmission===
The most common asynchronous signalling, asynchronous start-stop signalling, uses a near-constant &#x27;bit&#x27; timing (+/- 5% local oscillator required at both ends of the connection). Using this method, the receiver detects the &#x27;first&#x27; edge transition... (the START bit), waits &#x27;half a bit duration&#x27; and then reads the value of the signal. A further delay of one &#x27;whole bit duration&#x27; is executed before the next data bit is &#x27;read&#x27; - repeating for the length of the whole serial word (typically 7/8-data bits). An optional PARITY bit follows the data bits and precedes the stop bit(s). Finally, one or more STOP bits are appended to identify the end of the data word and to make sure there is a bit transition when the next START bit is transmitted.

The word structure used in typical asynchronous serial communications is START-DATA[0:7]-PARITY[optional;0]-STOP[0:1]. These formatting variables are specified when configuring the transmit and receive nodes before communications take place. The bit duration is determined from the nominated bit rate in bits per second (bit/s) e.g. 300, 1200, 9600, 19200, 115200 etc.

Special level and timing conditions are detected to identify an open-circuit condition (BREAK).

<doc id="1206181" wikidata="Q737181" url="?curid=1206181" title="Teitur Lassen">
<text>Teitur Lassen (, 4 January 1977) is a Faroese musician, composer, singer-songwriter and producer. He is a winner of multiple Danish Music Awards and has toured globally since his debut release, &quot;Poetry &amp; Aeroplanes&quot;, in 2003.

Teitur was born in Hoyvík. Since 2001 he has dedicated himself to playing and writing music in English full-time, and has released six studio albums as a solo artist. He has additionally produced, written for, or worked with multiple international artists including Seal, Corinne Bailey Rae, Netherlands Wind Ensemble, Emilie Simon, International Contemporary Ensemble (ICE), Holland Baroque Society, Nolwenn Leroy, Nico Muhly, and Ane Brun. His songs have appeared on major motion picture soundtracks and numerous compilations. 

== Studio albums ==
=== &quot;Poetry and Aeroplanes&quot; ===
After finding both a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific and a record contract with Universal Records in the United States, the Faroe Islands awarded him its 2004 &quot;Businessman of the Year&quot; award. His first major album, &quot;Poetry &amp; Aeroplanes&quot;, released in 2003, was recorded in Los Angeles and Spain and featured a number of prominent studio musicians such as Pino Palladino, Matt Chamberlain and the production of Rupert Hine.

Within months of its debut, the record found a following among many of popular music&#x27;s inner circle. Extensive touring in the US and Canada and rave reviews and industry/musician buzz led to opening slots on tours with Suzanne Vega, Glen Phillips, Rufus Wainwright, Aimee Mann, and John Mayer. John Mayer later described the album in his &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine article: &quot;it may be one of the best albums to come around in the last five years...Music like this is jet fuel on the fire of a broken heart. Even if you think the flame has died, there&#x27;s at least one lyric that&#x27;ll hit that last hot spot, and then you&#x27;ll find yourself as fucked as you were the day you lied and said you never wanted to see her again. Enjoy.&quot;

Teitur was featured on MTV&#x27;s &quot;You Hear it First&quot; program. While not picked up by mainstream radio, several of the songs on &quot;Poetry &amp; Aeroplanes&quot; found airplay on major television and motion picture soundtracks, most recently in the 2006 films &quot;Aquamarine&quot; and &quot;My Super Ex-Girlfriend&quot;. Teitur continued to tour extensively in over 20 countries, building a firm following and respect amongst media and the musician community, despite the lack of commercial marketing by Universal Records.

=== &quot;Stay Under the Stars&quot; ===
On 20 April 2006, Teitur&#x27;s management issued a statement that he had dropped Universal as his record label following months of legal problems and creative differences, and from then on his records would be released on Arlo and Betty Recordings, a new label, run by his manager, and named after his two vintage Gibson guitars.

His second studio record &quot;Stay Under the Stars&quot;, produced by Martin Terefe (Jason Mraz, Ron Sexsmith, KT Tunstall, Train), was released in May 2006 in Scandinavia on Arlo and Betty, licensed to the indie label Playground Music. After spending several months in the Danish Top-40, the album was released in the U.S. and Canada on 5 September 2006 on the newly formed Equator Records, and on iTunes on 8 September 2006 and Edel Records in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

The songs circle around the question asked in The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; lyric, &quot;All the lonely people, where do they all come from?&quot; and are written in first person about characters such as hitchhikers, burglars, night shift workers, star gazers and a carousel attendant. Also included is a re-arrangement of the Jerry Lee Lewis classic &quot;Great Balls of Fire.&quot;

=== &quot; Káta Hornið&quot; ===
In 2007, Teitur released an album performed entirely in his native Faroese language under the title &quot;Káta Hornið&quot;. It was initially released in the Faroe Islands and Iceland, and Teitur toured throughout the Faroe Islands in its support. The album was recorded in a summer vacation house in Tisvildeleje, Denmark, in January 2007 and mixed in Santa Barbara, California, later in the year.

=== &quot;The Singer&quot; ===
In October 2007, Teitur started recording a new album, &quot;The Singer&quot;. The recording studio was set up in the barn of the famous house &quot;Fridhem&quot; on the island of Gotland, former home and dying place of world-renowned director Ingmar Bergman. The album was produced by Teitur and recorded and engineered by his long-time live sound engineer Jonas Bloch Danielsen, with arranger collaborator Tróndur Bogason. The album was released in Scandinavia on 11 February 2008, and a few months later in the rest of world. In 2009, he was awarded &quot;Danish singer/songwriter Album of the Year&quot; for &quot;The Singer&quot; at the Danish Music Awards 2009 and Albums of the Week in the UK&#x27;s &quot;Guardian&quot; and &quot;Independent&quot;.

=== &quot;Let the Dog Drive Home&quot; ===
Teitur recorded his next album, &quot;Let the Dog Drive Home&quot;, in early 2010 in Copenhagen, with some of his regular musicians and collaborators, arranger Tróndur Bogason, drummer Derek Murphy (Atlanta, Georgia), bass player Mikael Blak (Faroe Islands), and Nikolaj Torp Larsen (London), and a host of guest musicians, and backing singers. Teitur once again produced the album, which was recorded and engineered by his regular cohort Jonas Bloch Danielsen and mixed by George Tandero (Norway) who also recorded and mixed &quot;Stay Under the Stars&quot;. The song title that spawned the album title is a metaphor for relaxing and letting things just happen. The artwork for the album, is based on a series of drawings by Teitur of a dog character, reflecting some of the lyrics in the album; the graphic design being handled, as on all his albums, by London-based Bob McKie with direction by Christian Ulf-Hansen.

The album was released in October 2010 in Scandinavia, reaching the top 10 in Denmark, preceded by the single &quot;You Never Leave L.A.&quot; and in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Benelux and Italy, also charting in the Netherlands; the single&#x27;s animated video based on the dog character of the album artwork, directed by Alex Lee, took nearly six months to make. The first single in the UK and Ireland was the track &quot;Betty Hedges&quot;, and the album was released on 11 April 2011 there, to great reviews, including &quot;Album of the Week&quot; in &quot;The Independent&quot;.

=== &quot;Story Music&quot; ===
In 2013, Teitur released his fifth studio album in English. The album written, produced and arranged by Teitur is the first one recorded on the Faroe Islands, and it features 78 local musicians from the age of 7 to 83. The recording took place in Studio Bloch, the first professional recording studio on the Faroes, built by long-time collaborator Jonas Bloch Danielsen, who also engineered and recorded the album. The style is described as world music, and it features many references to Faroese culture and traditions such as ring dance, folk music, monotony and nature. The song &quot;It&#x27;s Not Funny Anymore&quot; was arranged for orchestra by Van Dyke Parks and recorded in the Eindhoven Concertgebouw by Reyn Ouwehand, performed by members of the Holland Baroque Society and additional musicians. The first single &quot;Rock and Roll Band&quot; was playlisted on 120 American radio stations. The album was awarded Artistic Achievement of the Year on the Faroe Islands. An interactive film about the album recordings is in production.

=== &quot;I Want To Be Kind&quot; ===
In 2018, Teitur released his album &quot;I Want To Be Kind&quot;, recorded and mixed in Reservoir Studios in New York, USA. The album was produced by well known musician/producer Thomas Bartlett (aka Doveman), with additional production by Teitur, and mixed by Patrick Dillett. Teitur sang all the vocals and Teitur and Thomas played most of the instruments on the album, with some additional bass clarinet by Doug Wieselman.

=== &quot;Cazador de Ostras&quot;===
Released in September 2021, the Cazador de Ostras album, produced by Teitur was recorded in late 2019 in Mawi Road Studios in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with local guest musicians playing on the record with Teitur and Mariana Paraway features as guest vocalist with Teitur on the track &quot;Broken Stars&quot;. The album was later edited in his studio in the Faroes in 2020 and then mixed by Dave Izumi Lynch at Echo Zoo in Eastbourne, UK. Half the album is in English and half in Faroese. 

== Other works ==
In 2005, Teitur sang the track &quot;Syner&quot; on the 2005 &quot;Andersen&#x27;s Drømme&quot; album, produced and compiled by Danish producer Nikolaj Nørlund. Norlund went on to produce Teitur&#x27;s version of &quot;Happy Xmas (War Is Over)&quot; for the Danish Christmas album, &quot;Fra Danske Hjerter&quot; (translated as &quot;From Danish Hearts&quot;) in 2010.

In 2006 Grammy winner Corinne Bailey Rae released a song she co-wrote with Teitur &quot;Choux Pastry Heart&quot; on her debut album which sold 4 million copies worldwide and debuted at number one in the British charts.

In 2008 Teitur collaborated with composer Nico Muhly for the piece &quot;Confessions&quot; for the Holland Baroque Society. &quot;Confessions&quot; is a 14-piece song cycle for baroque instruments and voice. The music accompanies a series of mundane internet videos. &quot;Confessions&quot; was performed four times in 2008 and an additional nine shows around Holland in 2010 including at the famous Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. The album was released by Nonesuch Records in 2016.

Teitur produced and arranged the album &quot;Le Cheshire Cat et Moi&quot; in 2009 for French superstar Nolwenn Leroy, in addition to co-writing five of the songs.

In 2010, the legendary Italian singer Mina recorded Teitur&#x27;s song &quot;You Get Me&quot; as a duet with Seal, which was the first single from her album &quot;Caramella&quot;, which went top 3 in Italy. Seal went on to record the song again, with David Foster producing, for Seal&#x27;s album &quot;Commitment&quot;, which charted in 12 countries, also recording it as a duet with Concha Buika (Spain), TinkaBelle (Switzerland) and Anna Eriksson (Finland).

In 2011, Teitur wrote a seven-piece song cycle for choir and orchestra called &quot;Weekdays&quot;, which was performed in late 2011 by the Danish National Symphony Orchestra and the DR Girls choir in Copenhagen.

In 2012, Teitur performed live across the Netherlands with the Netherlands Wind Ensemble, while a film was shown which he commissioned and composed the score to, directed by Thomas Koba, under the title &quot;Everyday Song&quot;, with additional music composed for the live show by Trondur Bogason. They also performed as part of the Copenhagen International Documentary Festival (CPH:DOX). During 2012, Teitur composed the music for the yet to be released indie film &quot;The Load&quot; directed by Kristian Sonderby.

In 2013, he wrote music to the sonnet requiem &quot;Sommerfugledalen&quot; by Inger Christensen for full choir, piano and strings. The 30-minute piece was premiered in Holstebro with 100 young choristers in celebration of the 75th birthday of the Holstebro Gymnasium og HF, where Teitur was a student. The same year, Teitur appeared as a singer with the Danish National Symphony Orchestra in a new Danish requiem by composer John Frandsen with words by Simon Grotian. Teitur sang six songs solo with organ. The requiem premiered in Koncerthuset in April 2013.

In 2015, Teitur wrote &quot;Romeo Answers (Songs from Juliet Letters)&quot; for Messer Quartet. The piece for voice, string quartet and computer voices is 23 songs based on Juliet Letters, letters administered by Juliet Club (Club di Giulietta) that writers send to Shakespeare&#x27;s Juliet in Verona. The concept is influenced by Juliet Letters an album by Elvis Costello and Brodsky Quartet released in 1993. The piece was premiered with electric strings in Engelsholm castle, Denmark in August, 2015.

In 2017, eight of Teitur&#x27;s songs were integrated in the hymnal of Church of Denmark, Kirkesangbogen.

In 2017, the album &quot;Ich bin das Chaos&quot; was released by Judith Holofernes. Teitur was the co-writer of nine songs and co-produced and arranged the album as well as playing guitar, piano and synths. The album debuted at no. 13 in the German chart.

In 2018, Teitur released &quot;Running Music&quot; together with Mads Bjørn which is electronic music for running, fitness and movement. The album went to no. 1 on Danish Electronica charts on iTunes.

In 2019, Teitur appeared in the Danish TV series &quot;Toppen af Poppen&quot;, performing songs by six other well known artists, who also performed songs originally recorded by Teitur. In September 2019 the success of the show fueled Teitur&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Poetry &amp; Aeroplanes&quot; going to no. 1 on the Danish iTunes charts, with three other of his releases in the top 20.

In 2020, Teitur released a four track EP, &quot;Modern Era&quot;, with visuals based on photos by Simon Harsent

<text>Alternatív Közgazdasági Gimnázium (&quot;Alternative Secondary School of Economics&quot;), known as AKG by its students, is a six-year high school in Budapest, Hungary.

The basic educational principle of the school is that a child is not preparing for life but is living it. The school has given up the traditional instruments of institutional regulation, including house rules, systems of punishment and reward. These have been replaced with the free flow of information and the freedom of choice, emphasising the individual personalities of students, and taking into account their personal needs and concerns. The nature of this freedom changes along with the different stages of the students&#x27; life in the school.

== Address ==
AKG can be found at 1035, Raktár utca 1.

== History ==
AKG has the distinction of being the first non-state school in Hungary (established in 1988). Hungary had no private education since the collectivization that followed the second World War. It was established as an independent teachers&#x27; workshop. Its founders and organizers were all practicing educators, who created and developed the curriculum over two years.

== Educational system ==
In Hungary, students typically apply to a high school in either 6th or 8th grade. Hungarian students in public education are in high school for 6 and 4 years respectively, depending on when they started, with everybody graduating in 12th grade. AKG has 7-year and 5-year programs available for students, due to the language year, delaying graduation by a year.

=== Years 7–10 ===
The purpose of this period is to provide students with basic education in a wide variety of subjects, to ensure literacy and familiarity in any field they may go into later. Classes are organized into epochs with the epoch-system.

Briefly summarized, the epoch system allows students to focus on specific subjects for extended periods of time. Students have two epoch classes every day, with each lasting 80 minutes. Each class &quot;slot&quot; has a dedicated subject. Epochs are cyclical, with small tests every week and epoch-ending tests after three weeks. Traditionally, there are no pop-quizzes in this system. Epoch slots shift after every end of unit test. For example, a student could have a mathematics and a history epoch. Every Monday, they would write a test in these subjects. After three weeks, they would write the end of unit test and move on to literature and science epochs. Once those are done, they go back to mathematics and history, until the school year ends. A year has 5 epoch cycles.

Critical to AKG is the &quot;patronal system&quot;, which runs parallel to the epoch system. The largest unit of community in AKG is the school year, consisting of individuals who started in the same year. &quot;Years&quot; are divided into &quot;stacks&quot;, which learn epochs together. A stack is roughly 30 people, with a year being made of 2 or 3 stacks. Students of AKG pick the name of their community, so they aren&#x27;t categorized into sterile, alpha-numerical systems. The name of a year is composed of the names of its stacks. For example, year &quot;King-Kong&quot; would have stacks named King and Kong, and a year named &quot;Veni-Vidi-Vici&quot; would have stacks named Veni, Vidi and Vici. Stacks are further subdivided into patronal groups. Patrons are (usually) the individuals who teach epochs to the students. PGs are the smallest unit of community in AKG, being designed as ready-made communities for students in the first few years, but they usually give way to organically formed friend-circles and lose relevance over time.

Students are mandated to pick at least one extracurricular activity every year during this period.

School doesn&#x27;t start immediately with classes, instead, there is an opening activity every day. The activity is decided upon the patrons of that year. This acts as a buffer zone between classes and home life, so students don&#x27;t just drop into a busy environment. This can be discussing important world news, upcoming school events, playing a game, or anything else that engages the students but isn&#x27;t related to the curriculum.

=== Year 11/language ===
During this year, students learn a third language. During the previous years, all students typically reach at least mid-level competency in English. In this year, they have to drop English and learn a new language. German, Spanish, or French are the usual choices. Students are given the option to organize additional languages themselves but this is rare.

The goal of this year is for students to achieve at least B2 level competency in their language of choice. They spend 18 hours every week learning with a native speaker. Education is closely tied to the culture of the language&#x27;s nation, and so this doubles as cultural education as well. Students also have two media-studies classes every week and physical education. Extracurricular activities are available but not mandatory. School days are relatively short this year to let students work on their year-long-project and to explore what interests them, because next year they have to pick a subject to specialize in.

=== Years 11–12 ===
In the final period, AKG shifts back to traditional 45-minute classes, because there is no time for the deep engagement of epochs, as the students are working on their &quot;maturity exam&quot;, the points of which are used when applying to higher education at home and abroad. Students pick a subject they would like to specialize in, and are sorted into classes based on the level they want to pursue it on (All subjects can be basic, middle, or advanced. Students don&#x27;t bother with basic training because it is essentially worthless, middle is the common choice with advanced being chosen by ambitious students applying to schools abroad. The difficulty correlates with the amount of material students have to learn. This is the same across all of Hungary.). Stacks stop existing, as students are now sorted into specializations, not arbitrary groups.

== Projects ==
In AKG, students take part in a variety of subjects over the years. In the first few years, students work on short term projects that last 1–3 weeks, either alone or in groups. This can be anything from assembling a poetry collection to creating a model of a scientist&#x27;s laboratory.

Additionally, students must work on two year-long projects. The first, the &quot;Family History&quot;, is done over the course of the entirety of the 10th grade. Students must perform original research, assemble materials (such as letters and photographs) and create an in-depth documentation of the history of their family in the 20th century.

The second year-long project, during the language year, is freely chosen by the students (but approved by the patrons). It is usually some sort of synthetic activity, with an end result, although this is not always the case. Students also have to pick a mentor who is an expert and can help them with their project. For example, if a student is writing music as a project, their mentor could be their music teacher. Family and friends are usually not allowed to be mentors, to ensure that they don&#x27;t do the project instead of the student. The students receive a grade for this work, and must meet certain standards to pass and move on to the 11th grade. Although the presentation of the project and the work itself are important in the grading, the most valued component is the documentation of the student&#x27;s work, because the point of the project is to get students used to working on long time scales, not just a few weeks at a time.

== Extracurricular activities ==
AKG offers its students a wide variety of extracurricular activities. They can be graded or non-graded. Once a student picks one, they have to do it for the whole year. An extracurricular activity can only begin if at least 8 people apply. If at least 8 people come together with an activity they would like to do, the school assists them with organizing it and finding a teacher

Student&#x27;s in AKG can partake in the following extracurricular activities, among many others: hosting a radio show which is broadcast across the school, taking part in drama clubs themed around world cultures, video and photo clubs, writing for the school newspaper. Students can also join clubs themed around things they like studying or would like to study later, like marketing, biology, physics, mathematics, etc. Students can also get experience working with lab equipment in the laboratory club, or with basic medicine in the first aid club.

AKG has a robotics club, renowned in Hungary for its great success in many competitions. It deals with designing, building and programming robots using Lego Mindstorms sets, as well as 3D design and printing. Currently, the club is mentored by Gergely Nádori and Judit Pásztor. Students who have been in the club for at least a year can go to the FIRST LEGO League.

Students can also work with more advanced robotics platforms, such as Arduino, ESP, Micro:Bit and Lego EV3.

== Theme-week ==
In AKG, a theme week is a whole week of school in which students have no classes and each year has one specific theme based on which they create projects. All years have their theme week at the same time.

AKG has 5 theme weeks every year. One at the start of the school year, one a week before winter break, two during spring, and one in June. Three of them are held within the school, two of them are held outside of the school. There are recurring themes, such as the science-themed natural excursions, and some are one time, such as visiting a rural village.

== Little-epochs ==
Little-epochs are short, but important, topics that don&#x27;t warrant an entire theme-week. This can be something like first aid, or how to study effectively. Little epochs replace one of the epoch slots for a week, and on average occur every 5 weeks.

== Structure of social spaces ==
Physically, AKG can be interpreted as a sum of many &quot;little schools&quot;. A LS is a self contained social space with a classroom for each stack, a kitchen, a central social area, bathrooms and a teacher&#x27;s lounge. Students are allowed to make the space their own with changes and decorations, but the physical integrity and cleanliness of the space must be maintained. Students leave the LS for things like clubs and classes that require special equipment (music, P.E., science, etc.) but they spend the vast majority of their days here. Whenever a year graduates, their LS is renovated, to make way for the next year coming in September.

Students in AKG frequently have in-school sleepovers, either with their patronal group or their club. During the night, the school is almost completely empty, and students can do whatever they want (within reason, of course). Common favorites are playing hide and seek in the labyrinthine halls, watching movies, or playing dodgeball. One teacher has to be in the building with the students for supervisory purposes. Students bring their own sleeping bags, and sleep on lobby-couches, or gym mats. The robotics team frequently does sleep-ins before competitions for additional crunch time, so much so that a running joke amongst students is that the robotics team lives in the building and never leaves.

=== Patron picking ===
First year students have a special introductory camp, the purpose of which is to let them get to know the other students and the patrons. At the end of the camp, students rank the patrons on a scale, according to how much they want to be their student. On the last night, the patrons are up all night sorting people into patronal groups. On the final morning, students learn of their patronal group for the next few years during a ceremony, which is usually designed by the patrons.

Once the groups are made, they eat breakfast together to get to know each other even better.

=== Science Night ===
Science Night is a 4–5 hour program in October, completely open to the public. Guests can get to know various fields of science, experiments, and the lives of important intellectuals. Activities are organized either by relevant clubs, or vetted outsiders. Anything from electronics to chemistry can be found on Science Night. There are several comforts offered to guests, such as a room-sized wardrobe for coats and a snack shop run by students. The event&#x27;s primary function is marketing and PR for AKG.

=== Christmas in AKG ===
A theme-week precedes Christmas every year, but years themselves organize gifting events according to the desires of students. &quot;Secret Santa&quot; is popular with young students, but the older members of AKG prefer less scripted holidays and usually don&#x27;t bother with gifting

== Response to the coronavirus crisis ==
AKG has been transitioning to digital education for many years, so the switch to long-distance schooling in March 2020 was easier than for most but not without hurdles. In September, special protocols were developed to ensure that as much time could be spent in school as possible, while also containing infections locally. The central idea is that one year is one self-contained community, and contact between years must be minimized and eliminated wherever possible. The protocols are as follows:

* Vertically integrated extracurricular activities have been disbanded for the foreseeable future.
* If a student receives a positive test result, their year goes into quarantine for two weeks (counting from when the test was performed). Students take part in digital education for the duration of their isolation.
* The school cafeteria is closed. Meals from the kitchen are delivered directly to years in crates, and the snack shop has time slots for each year.
* Students may not leave and enter the building freely once their classes have started. They can leave permanently for something like a dentist appointment, or wait until their classes are over to go shopping.
* Students must wear masks during classes, but not in social spaces. Masks may be taken off for eating and drinking.
These rules were current as of October 2020.

In November 2020, AKG went into permanent lockdown following government mandates, and such restrictions lasted until nearly the end of the school year in May 2021. However, by September, more than 95% of the student population and 98% of the staff had been fully vaccinated, leading to more lenient protocols.

As of September 2021, the government of Hungary has no official COVID-19 restrictions regarding education, so everything AKG does is self-imposed. Students must wear masks at all times and have to get tested weekly. The cost of the tests is shouldered by students. Years go into a ten day quarantine when more than three of their students test positive in a given week. Food is available at the cafeteria again and the rule regarding leaving the building has returned to its pre-pandemic state. The state of school policy is changing rapidly as the situation evolves.

<text>Van Jacobson is an American computer scientist, renowned for his work on TCP/IP network performance and scaling. He is one of the primary contributors to the TCP/IP protocol stack—the technological foundation of today’s Internet. Since 2013, Jacobson is an adjunct professor at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) working on Named Data Networking.

==Early life and education==
Jacobson studied Modern Poetry, Physics, and Mathematics and received an M.S. in physics and a B.S. in mathematics from the University of Arizona. He did graduate work at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.

==Career==
His work redesigning TCP/IP&#x27;s congestion control algorithms (Jacobson&#x27;s algorithm) to better handle congestion is said to have saved the Internet from collapsing in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He is also known for the TCP/IP Header Compression protocol described in RFC 1144: &quot;Compressing TCP/IP Headers for Low-Speed Serial Links&quot;, popularly known as Van Jacobson TCP/IP Header Compression.

He is the co-author of several widely used network diagnostic tools, including traceroute, tcpdump, and pathchar. He was a leader in the development of the multicast backbone (MBone) and the multimedia tools vic, vat, and wb.

Jacobson worked at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory from 1974 to 1998 as a Research scientist in the Real-time Controls Group and later group leader for the Network Research Group. He was Chief Scientist at Cisco Systems from 1998 to 2000. In 2000 he became Chief Scientist for Packet Design, Inc. and in 2002 for a spin-off, Precision I/O. He joined PARC as a research fellow in August 2006.

In January 2006 at Linux.conf.au, Jacobson presented another idea about network performance improvement, which has since been referred to as &quot;network channels&quot;. Jacobson discussed his ideas on Named data networking (NDN), the focus of his work at PARC, in August 2006 as part of the &quot;Google Tech Talks&quot;. Van Jacobson is now working with the NDN Consortium funded by the National Science Foundation to explore and create the future of the internet.

==Awards and memberships==
Van Jacobson together with his colleague at LBL, Steven McCanne, won R&amp;D Magazine&#x27;s 1995 R&amp;D 100 Award for development of a software toolpack that enables multiparty audio and visual conferencing via the MBone (Multicast Backbone).

For his work, Jacobson received the 2001 ACM SIGCOMM Award for Lifetime Achievement &quot;for contributions to protocol architecture and congestion control&quot;, the 2002 IEEE Koji Kobayashi Computers and Communications Award, and was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2004 for his &quot;contributions to network protocols, including multicasting and the control of congestion.&quot;

In 2012, Jacobson was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.

<doc id="1206189" wikidata="Q4711815" url="?curid=1206189" title="1989 Alberta Senate nominee election">
<text>The 1989 Alberta Senate nominee election, formally the 1st Alberta Senate nominee election of Alberta was held on October 16, 1989, to nominate appointments to the Senate of Canada. The Senate nominee election was held in conjunction with Alberta municipal elections under the &quot;Local Authorities Election Act&quot;, and resulted in the first Canadian Senator appointed following a popular election.

The vote was held along municipal electoral boundaries, but conducted by Elections Alberta. Candidates were registered with provincial parties.

Stan Waters, nominated by the Reform Party, won the election, and was subsequently appointed to the Senate.

==Background==
The Government of Alberta under Premier Peter Lougheed had taken a position on Senate reform through balanced provincial membership and elected representatives as a mechanism to balance regional interests. In 1983, the Legislative Assembly of Alberta established the Select Special Committee on Upper House Reform, the committee&#x27;s 1985 report &quot;Strengthening Canada: Reform of Canada&#x27;s Senate&quot; served as the basis for provincial calls for reform in the 1980s.

The Government of Alberta under Premier Don Getty had made vailed statements in the late-1980s about holding a province-wide election to select nominees for the Senate with the expectation that Meech Lake Accord would be ratified and the Prime Minister would make appointments to the Senate on the basis of names submitted by each province&#x27;s premier. Additional credibility for the Senate nominee election came when sitting Solicitor General Marvin Moore announced he was leaving politics in February 1989 to contest the Senate nominee election prior to the 1989 Alberta general election, this announcement was followed by a similar announcement by Deputy Premier Dave Russell. The Senate nominee election was featured in the Speech from the Throne in February 1989 for the fourth session of the 21st Alberta Legislature, but died on the order paper when the legislature was dissolved to hold an early provincial election. The Progressive Conservative government campaigned on Senate reform during the election in the face of waning popularity with Alberta&#x27;s financial difficulties relating to the drop in oil prices, collapse of the Principal Group and concerns over Getty&#x27;s leadership.

The Progressive Conservative government was re-elected with a lower portion of the popular vote, while Premier Don Getty lost in his own riding and was subsequently elected to the legislature in a by-election. The bill was reintroduced in the June 1989 during the 22nd Alberta Legislature and received royal assent on August 18. The bill which permitted the vote to take place during the October 1989 Alberta municipal elections.

While Prime Minister Brian Mulroney was supportive of provincially nominated Senators, he did not support the concept of an election that would provide only a single name for the Prime Minister to consider.

===Candidates===

The Reform Party of Canada was eager to participate in the Senate nominee election, and federal party leaders created the Reform Party of Alberta in 1989 with the purpose of participating in the Senate nominee election, and not the Alberta general elections. A nomination meeting was scheduled in Red Deer for August 28, 1989 with each of the 26 federal constituency associations of the Reform Party in Alberta eligible to send 10 voting delegates to suggest names of candidates. The nomination was a major success for the Reform Party as a majority of the 26 constituency associations sent the maximum of 10 candidates. Retired Lieutenant-general Stan Waters gave a passionate speech criticizing out of control federal spending and announced his goal in the Senate would be to &quot;carve into the hearts of every Ottawa politician the words &#x27;Cut Spending&#x27;&quot;. Waters won the Reform Party nomination on the first ballot, defeating Edmonton Alderman Robert Matheson and Calgary lawyers Murray Smith and Victor Burstall. The Reform Party was well organized with Diane Ablonczy, Jim Denis and Preston Manning guiding the campaign, and the party budgeting for the Senate nominee election exceeded $250,000, with $80,000 destined for television advertising. The results of this effort were the Reform Party candidate Waters receiving a majority of the votes in rural Alberta and Calgary, and finishing second in Edmonton. University of Lethbridge political scientist Faron Ellis credits the 1989 Senate nominee election with lending creditability to the upstart Reform Party prior to the 1993 Canadian general election.

The Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta had three candidates contest the party&#x27;s nomination, former Solicitor General Marvin Moore, Triple-E Senate campaigner Bert Brown and Brian Heidecker. The nomination convention was scheduled for September 16, and Moore dropped out to support Brown who won the nomination when 10,000 party members voted. Brown&#x27;s candidacy was undermined by Progressive Conservative Party of Canada Members of Parliament urging Albertans not to participate in the election. Furthermore, Brown&#x27;s popularity was hurt through his conservative association with Mulroney&#x27;s government which was in the process of introducing the Goods and services tax.

The Liberal Party of Alberta saw Bill Code acclaimed as the candidate in mid-September when sitting MLA Nicholas Taylor declined to contest the nomination, which would have required him to resign from the legislature. Code described himself as centralist who saw the importance of a &quot;strong central government&quot; but also believed &quot;regions should be strong&quot;. Code was a former Liberal Party candidate in the 1984 Canadian federal election, and served as the head of the inquiry into the Principal Group, a group of financial companies based in Edmonton which failed in 1987 resulting in losses to 67,000 people.

The New Democratic Party of Alberta decided not to field a candidate in the Senate nominee election.

Three independent candidates participated in the Senate nominee election. Former Progressive Conservative MLA Tom Sindlinger, an economist known for being expelled from the Progressive Conservative Party by Premier Peter Lougheed over his views on constitutional reform in 1980. The second independent, Kenneth Paproski a physician, and former Progressive Conservative MLA for 11 years. The third independent was Irricana newspaper publisher Gladys Taylor.

== Aftermath ==
On October 17, 1989, one day after the Senate nominee election, Mulroney stated he was not bound to appoint a Senator by the results of the election, and instead intended to follow the process in the Meech Lake Accord. Getty responded to the comments by Mulroney by stating he would provide a list to the Prime Minister with a single name, Waters. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney had criticized the electoral process, although he nonetheless made a public announcement agreeing to advise Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn to appoint Waters to the Canadian Senate on June 11, 1990.

Mulroney&#x27;s decision came after pressure from Premier Getty and Reform Party Member of Parliament Deborah Grey. The agreement struck between Mulroney and Getty to appoint Waters to the Senate included a promise that Alberta would not hold another Senate nominee election for at least five years, and a newly established commission would study Senate reform. This agreement was despite the fact Alberta Senator Martha Bielish was set to hit mandatory retirement age in October 1990. Mulroney stated he would not appoint another elected Senator in Canada until after the commission had completed its study on Senate reform.

The appointment was celebrated by opposition parties including New Democratic MP Ross Harvey (Edmonton East), and Liberal Senator Joyce Fairbairn as the first Senator elected in a free and fair manner.

Waters time in the Senate was cut short when he was diagnosed with brain Cancer in the Summer of 1991, and died months later in Calgary on September 25, 1991, at the age of 71, four years before the mandatory retirement age for Canadian Senators.

After appointing Waters, Mulroney went on to appoint two more Senators from Alberta, neither of which participated in the Senate nominee election. Walter Patrick Twinn was appointed September 27, 1990 to replace Martha Bielish who retired at the age of 75. Ron Ghitter was appointed on March 25, 1993, to replace Waters after his death.

Prime Minister Jean Chrétien appointed four Senators from Alberta prior to the 1998 Alberta Senate nominee election, including Nicholas Taylor on March 7, 1996, Jean Forest on May 17, 1996, Thelma Chalifoux on November 26, 1997, and Douglas Roche. Roche, a former Member of Parliament for the Progressive Conservative Party was appointed to the Senate on September 17, 1998, one month before the 1998 Alberta Senate nominee election was held. Former Prime Minister Joe Clark criticized the appointment as a &quot;cynical, provocative and wrong&quot;. Alberta Premier Ralph Klein penned an open letter to Chrétien criticizing the appointment and calling for Senate reform. Klein went on to criticize Chrétien stating &quot;the prime minister of this country is saying that democracy is a joke&quot;.

<text>Reaktor is a graphical modular software music studio developed by Native Instruments (NI). It allows musicians and sound specialists to design and build their own instruments, samplers, effects and sound design tools. It is supplied with many ready-to-use instruments and effects. In addition, free instruments can be downloaded from the User Library. All of Reaktor&#x27;s instruments can be freely examined, customized, or taken apart, encouraging reverse engineering. The free, limited version called Reaktor Player allows musicians to play NI-released Reaktor instruments, but not edit or reverse-engineer them.

==Development history==
===Early development===
In 1996, Native Instruments released Generator version 0.96 - a modular synthesizer for PC, requiring a proprietary audio card for low-latency operation. By 1998, Native Instruments redesigned the program to include a new hierarchy, and integrated third-party drivers for use with any standard Windows sound card. By 1999, Reaktor 2.0 (a.k.a. Generator/Transformator) was released for Windows and Macintosh. Integrated real-time display of filters and envelopes and granular synthesis are among the most notable features. Plug-in support for VST, VSTi, Direct Connect, MOTU, and DirectX formats is integrated by 2000 (software version 2.3).

With version 3.0 (released in 2001), Native Instruments introduced a redesigned audio engine and new graphic design. Further expansion of synthesis and sampling modules, addition of new control-based modules (XY control) and data management (event tables) greatly expands the abilities of the program. The earliest version to really resemble the modern incarnation of the software is version 3.5, which improved greatly in VST performance and sample handling. Reaktor 3.5 is the first release that features full cross-platform compatibility.

Reaktor 4 enhanced stability, instrument library, GUI, and VSTi ease-of-use in external sequencers. It shipped almost six months behind schedule.

===Version 5===
In 2003 Native Instruments hired Vadim Zavalishin, developer of the Sync Modular software package. Zavalishin ceased the development of his software, yet integrated a deeper DSP-level operation within Reaktor, known as Reaktor Core Technology. His contributions, along with those of Reaktor Core developer Martijn Zwartjes, were released within Reaktor 5 in April 2005. Core Technology initially confused a lot of instrument designers because of its complexity, but is now steadily making its way into new instruments and ensembles.

Reaktor 5.1, released on 22 December 2005, features new Core Cell modules, and a new series of FX and ensembles. A number of bug fixes was also implemented.

The release of Reaktor 5.5 was announced for 1 September 2010. It features a revised interface as well as other changes.

===Version 6===
Reaktor 6.0 was released on September 9, 2015. It features many new improvements for advanced programmers. A new &quot;Blocks&quot; feature allowed for the development of rackmount style modular &quot;patches&quot; for creating synthesizers and effects. VST3 support was added with version 6.5.0.

==Functionality==
From the end-user standpoint, Reaktor can behave as a sound creation/manipulation tool with a modular interface, provided there is enough CPU to manage its sample decryption processes. Its patches consist of modules, connected by lines to provide a visual interpretation of signal flow. The building blocks used give Reaktor users freedom of choice to help shape their sound design. The modules are categorized into particular hierarchy to aid clarity in patching.

The patcher window allows one to navigate the inner structure of user&#x27;s models. Many factory-shipped objects within Reaktor can be accessed and edited, and new objects can be generated on the fly, expansion thereof to the users&#x27; specification coming with relative ease.

The objects that are available within Reaktor range from simple math operators to large sound modules. Implementation of Core Technology with version 5 enables user to view and edit the structure of any &quot;Core Module&quot; building block, although successful manipulation of Core Cells with predictable results requires in-depth knowledge of algorithmic implementation of signal generation and processing. Native Instruments promote this functionality with online side-by-side comparison of Core implementation of simple DSP algorithm against C++ pseudocode.

Provided adequate CPU is available, Reaktor enables a user to implement variables (static or dynamic) which are used as defining properties of the patch. Users have an ability to generate a GUI of their own to provide dynamic control to their systems. Starting with version 4, Reaktor supports user-generated graphical content, enabling users to customize their instruments.

Depending on the available processing power, a finished Reaktor ensemble may be loaded into a host sequencer (such as Steinberg Cubase or Ableton Live), and used in a similar manner to a stand-alone software plug-in for audio generation or processing (a multi-format proprietary loader is included with the software). Unlike truly stand alone devices, like VST plug-ins, Reaktor ensembles must be loaded in host sequencers using the Reaktor platform, which requires about 10 times the CPU processing power of more sophisticated VST. Each panel control in the ensemble is capable of MIDI automation in the host sequencer.

==Reaktor Ensembles==
The Reaktor Library is one of the prominent features of the software, featuring a large variety of sound generators and effects that can be used as stand-alone instruments, or as an educational resource for reverse engineering. Reaktor 4 featured a library of 31 Reaktor ensembles. The fifth generation of software came with 32 new modules (though some were upgrades of Reaktor 4 Library tools). The libraries provide a mixture of conventional implementation of software synthesizers, samplers, and effects, along with a few ensembles of experimental nature, with emphasis on parametric algorithmic composition and extensive sound processing. Due to complete backwards-compatibility between later versions of the software, Reaktor 5 users have access to all 63 proprietary ensembles in Reaktor Library.

Furthermore, home-brew Reaktor ensembles can be shared by its users. Such exchange is encouraged by Native Instruments, providing web-based tools and webspace for individual and third-party Reaktor extensions (this includes user Ensembles and presets for Reaktor Instruments and Effects).

<doc id="1206204" wikidata="Q180860" url="?curid=1206204" title="Pervis Ellison">
<text>Pervis Ellison (born April 3, 1967) is an American former National Basketball Association (NBA) player. Nicknamed &quot;Never Nervous Pervis&quot; for his clutch play with the University of Louisville, after leading Louisville to a national championship, Ellison was the first overall pick in the 1989 NBA Draft. His professional career was largely hindered by injuries, though he won the NBA Most Improved Player Award in 1992.

==Collegiate career==
At , , he started all four years as the center under coach Denny Crum. In his freshman year he led Louisville to its second national championship, scoring a game-leading 25 points and adding 11 rebounds in the 72-69 championship win over Duke, and was then named the Most Outstanding Player—the second time a freshman had ever been awarded that honor, after Arnie Ferrin in 1944 for Utah.

==Professional career==
Ellison was made the first overall pick in the 1989 NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings. Teammate Danny Ainge gave Ellison the nickname &quot;Out of Service Pervis&quot; for the many injuries that would plague him during his professional career. An injury kept him on the sidelines for 48 of 82 games of his rookie year, after which he was traded to the Washington Bullets in a three-team trade involving the Utah Jazz that also sent Jeff Malone to the Jazz and Eric Leckner, Bob Hansen, and draft picks to the Kings. On April 6, 1991, Ellison scored a career-best 30 points while adding 12 rebounds in a win over the Indiana Pacers. Although he sometimes played as a backup in 1990–1991, the following year he became a full time starter and earned Most Improved Player honors after averaging 20.0 points, 11.4 rebounds and 2.68 blocks per game. Among the best games of Ellison&#x27;s NBA career occurred on January 31, 1992, when he recorded 19 points, 19 rebounds, 6 assists, 5 blocked shots and 2 steals against the Knicks.

Assorted injuries plagued his career, including two knee problems that kept him benched for 29 games in 1992–93 and 30 games in 1993–94. Ellison signed with the Boston Celtics after he was released by Washington in April 1994, but did not play until midway through the following season because he was still rehabilitating from knee problems. A broken toe suffered while moving furniture kept him out of most games between 1996 and 1998. After participating in 69 out of a possible 246 games over the final three seasons with the Celtics, he joined the Seattle SuperSonics in 2000 but retired after playing nine games. He once coached basketball for Life Center Academy in Burlington, New Jersey and is a resident of Voorhees Township, New Jersey. His son Malik played for him at Life Center Academy and is a professional basketball player.

<text>Van Jacobson TCP/IP Header Compression is a data compression protocol described in RFC 1144, specifically designed by Van Jacobson to improve TCP/IP performance over slow serial links. Van Jacobson compression reduces the normal 40 byte TCP/IP packet headers down to 3–4 bytes for the average case; it does this by saving the state of TCP connections at both ends of a link, and only sending the differences in the header fields that change. This makes a very big difference for interactive performance on low speed links, although it will not do anything about the processing delay inherent to most dial-up modems.

Van Jacobson Header Compression (also VJ compression, or just Header Compression) is an option in most versions of PPP. Versions of Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) with VJ compression are often called CSLIP (Compressed SLIP).

<doc id="1206234" wikidata="Q7659974" url="?curid=1206234" title="Sydney Horler">
<text>Sydney Horler (18 July 1888 – 27 October 1954) was a prolific British novelist specialising in thrillers. He was born in Leytonstone, Essex, and educated at Redcliffe School and Colston School in Bristol.

His first job was with &quot;Western Daily Press&quot; and Allied Newspapers in Bristol started in 1905. This lasted until 1911 when he left to become a special writer on the staff of Edward Hulton and Co. in Manchester. He moved to London to work on the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Daily Citizen&quot; in Fleet Street, although he also worked in the propaganda section of Air Intelligence towards the end of the First World War. When it ended he joined the editorial staff of George Newnes Ltd as a sub editor of the &quot;John O&#x27;London&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. He didn&#x27;t see eye to eye with the editor and after a big row in 1919 his employment was terminated.

He decided to become a full-time writer. He became a popular author with the publication, in 1925, of his first crime novel, &quot;The Mystery of No.1&quot;, and with novels such as &quot;Checkmate&quot; (1930). Horler&#x27;s work was influenced by other popular thriller writers such as Edgar Wallace and &quot;Sapper&quot;. His main hero was &quot;Tiger&quot; Standish, a character similar to Sapper&#x27;s Bulldog Drummond. Horler&#x27;s work began to be commercially successful after being serialised in the &quot;News of the World&quot;. By the 1930s, Horler&#x27;s books had sold an estimated two million copies.

==Political views==
Horler frequently used his work to put forward his opinions. He was a supporter of the British Monarchy and the Church of England (of which he was a member). Horler&#x27;s works also incorporated his own prejudices. Watson notes both his fiction and non-fiction regularly express negative sentiments about non-English peoples. Horler&#x27;s heroes, such as Tiger Standish, regularly use derogatory terms like &quot;wogs&quot; and &quot;stinking Italianos&quot;, and Horler also expressed contempt for both the Americans and the French in his diaries. Writers such as Bill Pronzini and Malcolm Turnbull have noted that Horler&#x27;s novels regularly featured negative depictions of Jews as criminals and racketeers, and he made denigrating comments about the Jewish community in his memoirs, &quot;Excitement: An Impudent Autobiography&quot;. Not even the rise of Nazism made any change to Horler&#x27;s antisemitism; Turnbull points out Horler subscribes to &quot;wartime slanders of Jew-Nazi collaboration and Jewish wartime profiteering in his 1940s titles&quot;. Horler&#x27;s book &quot;Nighthawk Mops Up&quot; (1944) features a Jewish villain, Wilfred Abrahams, who collaborates with the Nazis. A 2021 review by Anthony Daniels of Horler&#x27;s 1944 book &quot;Virus X&quot;, however, found the book &quot;strongly anti-anti-Semitic,&quot; and stated that &quot;[m]any times in the book the Nazis are denounced for their anti-Semitism.&quot;

Horler also expressed a disapproval of casual sex, especially homosexuality. Horler wrote to the British police demanding a crackdown on what he saw as &quot;the alarming increase in sex perversion&quot; in London, claiming the city&#x27;s streets were full of male prostitutes. In his fiction, Horler spent a large amount of time emphasising how &quot;virile&quot; and &quot;masculine&quot; his heroes are. One of Horler&#x27;s characters, the gentleman thief &quot;Nighthawk&quot;, only steals jewels from women he sees as sexually immoral, pausing in his work to scrawl the word &quot;Wanton&quot; on their pillowcases.

==Critical reception==
Literary reviewers of the time, such Dorothy L. Sayers and Compton Mackenzie, generally gave negative opinions on Horler&#x27;s fiction. Horler&#x27;s novels have not been popular since his death. Critics have taken issue with Horler&#x27;s plots, described by William L. DeAndrea as &quot;unbelievable&quot;&#x27; (Horler himself claimed to &quot;give old man coincidence&#x27;s arm a frightful twist&quot;) and characters seen as clichéd. David Stafford describes Horler as &quot;among the worst&quot; of British thriller writers.

A digital successor to the Handbook was released as the &quot;Digital Library of Mathematical Functions&quot; (DLMF) on 11 May 2010, along with a printed version, the &quot;NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions&quot;, published by Cambridge University Press.

==Overview==
Since it was first published in 1964, the 1046-page &quot;Handbook&quot; has been one of the most comprehensive sources of information on special functions, containing definitions, identities, approximations, plots, and tables of values of numerous functions used in virtually all fields of applied mathematics. The notation used in the &quot;Handbook&quot; is the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for much of applied mathematics today.

At the time of its publication, the &quot;Handbook&quot; was an essential resource for practitioners. Nowadays, scientific calculators, numerical analysis software packages, and computer algebra systems have replaced the function tables, but the &quot;Handbook&quot; remains an important reference source. The foreword discusses a meeting in 1954 in which it was agreed that &quot;the advent of high-speed computing equipment changed the task of table making but definitely did not remove the need for tables&quot;.

Michael Danos and Johann Rafelski edited the &quot;Pocketbook of Mathematical Functions&quot;, published by Verlag Harri Deutsch in 1984. The book is an abridged version of Abramowitz&#x27;s and Stegun&#x27;s Handbook, retaining most of the formulas (except for the first and the two last original chapters, which were dropped), but reducing the numerical tables to a minimum, which, by this time, could be easily calculated with scientific pocket calculators. The references were removed as well. Most known errata were incorporated, the physical constants updated and the now-first chapter saw some slight enlargement compared to the former second chapter. The numbering of formulas was kept for easier cross-reference.

A digital successor to the Handbook, long under development at NIST, was released as the “Digital Library of Mathematical Functions” (DLMF) on 11 May 2010, along with a printed version, the &quot;NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions&quot;, published by Cambridge University Press.

<text>USS &quot;Sennet&quot; (SS-408) was a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, a ship of the United States Navy named for the sennet, a barracuda.

&quot;Sennet&quot; was laid down on 8 March 1944 by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, launched on 6 June 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Roscoe W. Downs, and commissioned on 22 August 1944.

&quot;Sennet&quot; was fitted out by 18 September. She held training exercises and torpedo-tube testing off the coast of Connecticut and Rhode Island until 22 October. The submarine then tested mines and torpedoes for the Mine Warfare Test Station, Solomons Island, Md. On 11 November, &quot;Sennet&quot; proceeded to the operations area off Balboa, C. Z. and conducted further training exercises. The submarine departed Balboa on 29 November for Pearl Harbor and arrived there on 16 December 1944.

&quot;Sennet&quot;&#x27;s topside armament was increased to two guns, two 40 millimeter guns, and three .50 caliber machine guns before departing Pearl Harbor for her first war patrol on 5 January 1945.

== First and second patrols, January–March 1945 ==

&quot;Sennet&quot; patrolled north of the Bonin Islands until 28 January. She made two attacks on a large tanker with three escorts on 21 January but scored no hits. The following week, the submarine sank one 500-ton picket boat and damaged another.

&quot;Sennet&quot; refitted at Saipan from 31 January to 7 February, when she began her second war patrol off southern Honshū, Japan. On 13 February, two 300-ton picket boats were sunk by the combined gunfire of &quot;Sennet&quot;, , and .

Three days later, the submarine attacked the minelayer &quot;Nariu&quot; with an offset spread of torpedoes from her stern tubes, then went deep to . Two torpedoes were heard to explode. While going deep, &quot;Sennet&quot; was rocked hard by two aircraft bombs which exploded beneath her. The submarine surfaced an hour later and saw a large oil slick and approximately 40 Japanese clinging to debris but no trace of the &quot;Nariu&quot; which had sunk.

== Third and fourth patrols, April–August 1945 ==

&quot;Sennet&quot; was refitted by in Apra Harbor, Guam, 9 March – 2 April. Patrolling off Honshū again from 3 April to 16 May, she was twice straddled by torpedoes fired from patrol boats while she was surfaced off Miki Saki on 16 April. Three days later, the submarine torpedoed and sank the cargo ship &quot;Hagane Maru&quot;. On 22 April, &quot;Sennet&quot; attempted to save a P-51 pilot who had bailed out near her but the man went under only from the ship. Attempts to find him were in vain.

A repair ship was attacked on 28 April with two electrical torpedoes. The first blew the bow off and the second hit under the mainmast. &quot;Hatsushima&quot; sank by her stern. On 1 May, &quot;Sennett&quot; fired five steam torpedoes at an &quot;Asashio&quot;-class destroyer but it maneuvered and avoided them. At the end of this patrol, the submarine sailed to Pearl Harbor for upkeep and leave.

&quot;Sennet&quot;&#x27;s most profitable patrol was from 1 July to 9 August in the Sea of Japan. During the patrol, she sank one passenger-cargo ship, two cargo ships, and one tanker totaling 13,105 tons.

== 1945–1951 ==

When the war ended in the Pacific, &quot;Sennet&quot; was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet and operated from New London, Conn. In June 1946, she was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 6 (SubRon 6) at Balboa, C.Z. From 10 December 1946 to 13 March 1947, &quot;Sennet&quot; participated in Operation Highjump, the third Byrd Antarctic Expedition. &quot;Sennet&quot; used the first basic under-ice sonar to establish the feasibility of United States under-ice operations.

&quot;Sennet&quot; operated from Balboa until 1949 when she was assigned to operate from Key West, Fla., as a unit of Submarine Squadron 12 (SubRon 12). The ship conducted training for submarine and antisubmarine personnel at Key West and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In 1951, &quot;Sennet&quot; was converted to a Fleet Snorkel submarine at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and returned to her homeport.

== 1954–1973 ==

On 4 November 1954, &quot;Sennet&quot; departed Key West on her first deployment to the Mediterranean and service with the 6th Fleet. From her return on 30 January 1955 until 1 August 1959, the submarine conducted training, local, and fleet operations with her squadron. On 1 August, &quot;Sennett&quot; was reassigned to SubRon 4 and stationed at Charleston, S.C. For the next nine years, the submarine operated from Charleston with the Atlantic Fleet. She operated along the east coast, in the Caribbean, and in the Atlantic with her squadron until mid-1968.

In November 1968, the submarine was found unfit for further Naval service. &quot;Sennet&quot; was struck from the Navy list on 2 December 1968. On 18 May 1973, her hulk was sold to Southern Scrap Material Co. Ltd., New Orleans, La.

<text>Curettage ( or ), in medical procedures, is the use of a curette (French, meaning &quot;scoop&quot;) to remove tissue by scraping or scooping.

Curettages are also a method of abortion. It has been replaced by vacuum aspiration over the last decade.

Curettage has been used to treat teeth affected by periodontitis.

Curettage is also a major method used for removing osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma.

Curettage with subsequent culture is more accurate than ulcer base swan culture or aspiration and culture for diabetic foot ulcers.

Curettage is also used when excising a chalazion of the eyelid.

<text>Barczewo (until 1946 &quot;Wartembork&quot;; ) is a town in Olsztyn County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, Poland. It is situated 20 km northeast of Olsztyn, in the historic region of Warmia. As of December 2021, the town has a population of 7,483.

==Name==
The German name of the town (&quot;Wartenburg&quot;) has its origins from the town of Wartenburg (Elbe). In Polish the town was known historically as Wartembork, Wartenberg, Wartenbergk, Wathberg, Bartenburg, Warperc, Wasperc, Wartbór or Wartbórz.

In the aftermath of World War II, the town was transferred from Germany to Poland. The Commission for the Determination of Place Names decided to change the town&#x27;s name. It was briefly named &quot;Nowowiejsk&quot;, after local composer Feliks Nowowiejski, in September 1946. In December that year the Commission settled on another name, &quot;Barczewo&quot;, honouring Polish national activist who fought against Prussian oppression of Poles in Warmia, Walenty Barczewski (1865–1928).

==History==
The town was first located in 1325 but was soon after destroyed by Lithuanians. The rebuild town was granted city rights in 1364. It was known at the time as &quot;Wartberg&quot;.

In 1440 the town joined the Prussian Confederation, at the request of which Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon signed the act of incorporation of the region to the Kingdom of Poland in 1454. In 1466, after the Second Peace of Toruń, the town was confirmed as part of Kingdom of Poland. It was the place of fights of the Polish–Teutonic War of 1519–1521. In April 1520 a battle was fought in the vicinity, in November 1520 the town was successfully defended by the Poles, and in January 1521 the Teutonic Knights came back and launched artillery fire on the town, but eventually withdrew. During the Deluge, Brandenburg forced occupied the town in 1656. During the Great Northern War, Polish and Swedish troops marched through the town. In 1772, after the First Partition of Poland it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1807, the town was occupied by France.

According to German statistics Poles constituted 72% of population in 1825 and 62% in 1861; Gerard Labuda and August von Haxthausen give the number of 1500 Poles and 590 Germans living in the town in 1825. The local monastery was secularised in 1810, in 1819/1820 Prussian authorities decided to close down the monastery that has been described as &quot;the stronghold of Polishness.&quot; After the death of Father Tyburcjusz Bojarzynowski, last leader of the monastery, in 1834 it has been converted into a state prison. According to this was part of Prussian repressions against Poles as the monastery was seen as particularly problematic by Prussian authorities for being a center of Polish resistance.

A Jewish Synagogue was built in 1847, and a Jewish cemetery from the 19th century exists as well. During the January Uprising in 1860s in the Russian Partition of Poland, the town was the local centre of supplying medicine, food and even firearms to Polish rebels, with the Polish society in the town becoming active in war effort and led by . In 1885 a mass rally was organised by Poles, demanding among others that Polish children should be allowed to use their language in education In 1886 a bookstore with Polish books and publications was opened in the town and came into conflict with German authorities who wanted it to remove Polish language signs.

In the plebiscite of 1920 3,020 inhabitants voted to remain in Weimar German East Prussia, 140 votes supported reborn Poland. In the interwar era the town was the residence of the fictional Kuba spod Wartemborka, a pseudonym of a figure in Polish press in Warmia created by which ridiculed Germanisation efforts against Poles in the region. Polish organisations continued to thrive in the town, up until Second World War; as Nazi Party was elected to power in Germany, repressions intensified, eventually many Polish activists were either imprisoned or, like Pieniężny, murdered in Nazi concentration camps and prisons. During that war, the remaining Jewish community was murdered in the Holocaust. During the war, the Germans operated a Nazi prison in the town, with several forced labour subcamps in the region, including one in the town itself. Many inhabitants fled the town since 21 January 1945, and the last German units withdrew during the night of 30–31 January. The town was occupied by Soviet troops without a fight on 31 January 1945. The Russians then plundered the town and carried out mass deportations of remaining people into the USSR, especially to Siberia. On 22 May 1945 the town, now destroyed at 60%, was handed over to Polish officials.

As part of territorial changes demanded by the Soviet Union, Polish rule was accepted at the Potsdam Conference, however, on preliminary terms. After 173 years, the town was reintegrated with Poland. On 9 March 1946 the prison in Barczewo has also been transferred to Polish authorities. Between 1965 and his death in 1986 it held the former Gauleiter and President of East Prussia Erich Koch. After introduction on Martial law in Poland Barczewo prison also seen opposition activists detained including Władysław Frasyniuk, Adam Michnik, Stefan Niesiołowski, Leszek Moczulski, Romuald Szeremietiew and Józef Szaniawski.

<text>Gracie Mansion (also Archibald Gracie Mansion) is the official residence of the mayor of New York City. Built in 1799, it is located in Carl Schurz Park, at East End Avenue and 88th Street in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan. The federal-style mansion overlooks Hell Gate in the East River and consists of the original two-story house and an annex built in 1966. The original house is a New York City designated landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The house&#x27;s site was previously occupied by Belview Mansion, built in 1770 for local merchant Jacob Walton and destroyed during the American Revolutionary War. In 1799, Archibald Gracie built a new house on the same site, which he used as his country home until 1823. The family of merchant Joseph Foulke used the house from 1823 to 1857, and the family of builder Noah Wheaton used it from 1857 to 1896, when the municipal government made its grounds part of Carl Schurz Park. During the early 20th century, the mansion was used as public restrooms, an ice cream stand, and classrooms. Gracie Mansion housed the Museum of the City of New York from 1924 to 1936, and it was a historic house museum until 1942, when it became a mayoral residence. Since then, each mayor except for Michael Bloomberg has lived at Gracie Mansion at some point during their tenure; most mayors redecorated the house upon taking office. A reception wing, named for New York City first lady Susan Wagner, was completed in 1966. Further major renovations took place in 1983–1984 and in 2002.

The facade is composed of clapboard panels with shutters. The original mansion&#x27;s first floor includes parlors, a dining room, a kitchen, and a library; the annex also includes a ballroom and reception rooms. The second floor has been traditionally used as bedrooms, while the basements contain offices. The mansion&#x27;s upkeep is partially overseen by the Gracie Mansion Conservancy, although the city government continues to own it. In addition to governmental business and special events, Gracie Mansion hosts public tours. Over the years, the house has been the subject of commentary, and it has also received accolades and has been depicted in numerous media works.

== Site ==
Gracie Mansion, also known as Archibald Gracie Mansion, is located in Carl Schurz Park (at East End Avenue and 88th Street) in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. The mansion faces northeast toward Hell Gate, a channel in the East River. By the early 21st century, it was the only remaining country estate in Yorkville. Gracie Mansion sits atop Carl Schurz Park&#x27;s highest point.

=== Previous site usage ===
The Europeans established their first settlements in modern-day New York City in the 17th century. From that point until the end of the 19th century, only six men owned the site. The first European owner of Gracie Mansion&#x27;s site was Sybout Claessan, who received either or from the Dutch West India Company in 1646. Claessan&#x27;s land, which includes Carl Schurz Park, was initially known as Hoorn&#x27;s Hook or Horn&#x27;s Hook, after the city of Hoorn in North Holland. The site was alternately known as Horen Hook, Harris&#x27; Hook, or Harris&#x27; Point. Dutch immigrant Resolved Waldron obtained the land in 1690 after Claessan died; it passed through three other members of the Waldron family over the next eight decades and was subdivided after William Waldron&#x27;s death in 1769.

Jacob Walton, a merchant from what is now Flatbush in Brooklyn, obtained around Hoorn&#x27;s Hook and built a house, Belview Mansion, on the site in 1770. He moved into the house with his wife Polly Cruger. Drawings indicate that the earlier mansion was composed of a two-story central section and one-story wings on either side. Ornamentation on that house included quoins at its corners; keystones above the windows; a weather vane and finials at the roof; and a triple bay of windows at the end of each wing. The Waltons were forced to leave the house in February 1776, during the American Revolutionary War, and the site became a Continental Army fort, which was completed in April 1776. The house was severely damaged by cannonball fire on September 8 or September 15, 1776. British troops controlled the site until 1783.

The Waltons never went back to Belview; their four children did not receive the land until 1791. Belview Mansion included a hidden tunnel to the East River, which still existed when Gracie Mansion was developed on the same site. The brick tunnel ran north from the mansion&#x27;s basement and then turned east toward the river. It is not known why the tunnel was built, but one newspaper said the tunnel could have been used as an escape route during the American Revolution or as a secret lover&#x27;s entrance. For more than two centuries, there was little documentation on Belview Mansion&#x27;s existence. One of the cannonballs that destroyed the mansion was later displayed.

==Early history==

=== Gracie occupancy ===
The merchant Archibald Gracie, at the time one of New York City&#x27;s richest men, bought Walton&#x27;s land in two phases in December 1798 and January 1799. At the time, the Gracies&#x27; city residence was a house that they rented from New York City mayor Richard Varick. Gracie built a new country estate on the Walton site in 1799, though there is disagreement over whether Gracie destroyed or reused the remains of Belview Mansion. In either case, Gracie removed the Revolutionary War-era earthworks and landscaped the gardens. Gracie&#x27;s mansion was abutted to the west by the house of banker Nathaniel Prime, which later became St. Joseph&#x27;s Orphan Asylum. Other houses along the East River included those of the Rhinelander family, Alexander Hamilton, John Jacob Astor, and Isaac Chauncey, which have long since been demolished. Gracie Mansion, at the time, was accessible only via the East River and was several miles from the developed parts of Lower Manhattan. There was a dock and a stone stable just south of the house.

In 1801, Gracie hosted a meeting of New York Federalists at the mansion to raise funds for the establishment of the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot;, which eventually became the &quot;New York Post&quot;. During the city&#x27;s 1803 yellow fever epidemic, the house&#x27;s isolated position allowed Gracie to avoid infected people in the city. Although the house originally faced southeast, it was expanded in 1804 to face northeast toward Hell Gate. The mansion was valued at $5,200 by 1809. Further expansions were completed in 1811; the work included relocating the main entrance, adding a pantry and parlor at ground level, and adding two bedrooms upstairs. Cannons were installed during the War of 1812 to defend the house&#x27;s elevated site, and the house itself may have served as a military post.

The house entertained up to fifty guests at a time. Gracie hosted guests such as Hamilton, Astor, future French king Louis Philippe I, U.S. president John Quincy Adams, and writers James Fenimore Cooper and Washington Irving. The Riker, Rhinelander, and Schermerhorn families were also guests, as were the poet Thomas Moore, U.S. Army general Winfield Scott, and New York governor DeWitt Clinton. Future Boston mayor Josiah Quincy III, who also stopped by the mansion, described the house as &quot;elegant&quot; and the grounds as having a tasteful layout. Irving may have written part of his novel &quot;Astoria&quot; while at the house, and he wrote in 1813 that &quot;I cannot tell you how sweet and delightful I found this retreat, pure air, agreeable scenery and profound quiet&quot;.

Gracie continued to maintain a residence in Lower Manhattan; he bought a new city residence at 1 State Street in 1805 and moved to another house at 15 State Street in 1813. Gracie was so wealthy that, when he lost $1 million in 1807 due to naval blockades, his net worth was unaffected. Although Gracie&#x27;s firm lost more than $1 million during the War of 1812, he used the house as his country home until 1823. Ultimately, the aftermath of the war depleted his finances. Two of U.S. Founding Father Rufus King&#x27;s sons married two of Gracie&#x27;s daughters, and King bought the mansion prior to 1823. King placed the mansion for sale in April 1823, and Gracie&#x27;s company, Archibald Gracie &amp; Son, was dissolved the next month.

=== Foulke use ===
The same year as Gracie&#x27;s firm was dissolved, the house was sold to Joseph Foulke, a merchant who had gained his wealth from trading largely in Central America and the Caribbean. Foulke paid $20,500 for the house and about of land, which became known as Foulke&#x27;s Point. Initially, the Foulke family used Gracie Mansion only as a summer mansion, but they eventually used the house as their primary residence. The Foulkes added a fireplace mantel in the parlor but are not known to have made any other modifications. When Foulke died in 1852, the mansion and estate were passed to his seven children, and the land was subsequently divided.

=== Wheaton use ===
Foulke&#x27;s family sold the house in 1857 to a builder named Noah Wheaton, who also purchased 12 adjacent lots. By then, many of the estates on the East River were being replaced with industrial development. Wheaton added a two-story brick stable north of the mansion, built a kitchen in the mansion itself, and added gas lighting. One of the Wheatons&#x27; guests wrote that they used to swim at Gracie&#x27;s old mansion, where &quot;there was comparatively deep water on the North side&quot;.

Wheaton declared bankruptcy in 1859, and the house went into foreclosure two years later, although the family was allowed to remain there. The Great Western Insurance Company, who had foreclosed on the house, resold it to Wheaton in 1870. The 1870 census describes Wheaton as living in the house with his wife, their three daughters, and two servants; by then, his affluent neighbors had moved toward the middle of Manhattan. Wheaton&#x27;s daughter Alice Hermione Wheaton Quackenbush and her husband Lambert S. Quackenbush lived in the mansion for five years in the 1870s; the Quackenbushes&#x27; two oldest children, Amalie and Daniel, were also born in the mansion.

Wheaton took out several mortgages on the house and frequently encountered business troubles. His entire family may have left the house for a short time in the 1870s during one such business failure. Wheaton established a business on Broadway in 1878, but the business is not listed in an 1879 directory. In directories for subsequent years, listings for Wheaton mention only that he lived at Gracie Mansion, although he is recorded as being a &quot;merchant&quot; in 1882 and 1883. The house continued to be affected by Wheaton&#x27;s business failures until his youngest daughter, Jane, married the lawyer Hamlin Babcock in 1884. Babcock moved into the house and remained there until 1896.

== Parks Department takeover ==
The New York City government took over the land northeast of 86th Street and East End Avenue in 1891, converting it into what would later become Carl Schurz Park. The house itself was not acquired by the city until 1896, when the city government added it to Carl Schurz Park. According to Susan Danilow, who directed the Gracie Mansion Conservancy in the 2000s, the city government took over the mansion because the taxes had not been paid. The mansion served various functions as part of the park, including an ice cream stand, storage rooms, classrooms, and as a public toilet where, for five cents, people could use the house&#x27;s bathrooms.

In 1911, the mansion was outfitted with steam heat; at the time, the house was being used as a clubhouse for girls&#x27; clubs. The porch began to sag, while the paint was peeling. The house was in such disrepair that local residents wanted the mansion demolished, although a group led by Mrs. Graeme Elliot advocated for its preservation.

=== Museum of the City of New York use ===

The Patriotic New Yorkers—led by the writer May King Van Rensselaer, one of Gracie&#x27;s descendants—had been contemplating taking over the mansion and opening an American history museum there in 1920. King Van Rensselaer and 20 other upper-class women wanted the museum to depict &quot;the guests who had been entertained there, in the costumes of the beginning of 1800&quot;. The group wrote a letter to the Manhattan park commissioner in March 1922, requesting that Gracie Mansion be converted into a public museum. The next month, a bill to transfer control of the mansion to the Patriotic New Yorkers was introduced in the state legislature. At the time, the house was characterized as tan with red trimmings, and there was a piazza in front of the house. By 1923, the Museum of the City of New York (MCNY), led by Henry Collins Brown, also wanted to take over the house. Although NYC Parks had not awarded control of the house to either organization, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that MCNY officials were already marking their letters as having come from Gracie Mansion.

Ultimately, the city and state governments gave the MCNY control over the mansion; the 1924 &quot;Valentine&#x27;s Manual&quot; said the home &quot;is exactly the place&quot; for a history museum. As part of the agreement, the city government maintained the house, and the city&#x27;s park commissioners were also permitted to rent it to civic groups for meetings. The MCNY furnished Gracie Mansion with objects gifted or loaned by other institutions. The MCNY opened within the mansion in November 1924 with exhibits spread across two floors. Following further restoration, Gracie Mansion formally opened to the public as the MCNY&#x27;s exhibit space in March 1927, although the museum was already planning a new building. When the MCNY occupied the house, the ground floor was arranged as a reception room, music room, and dining room. Three of the second-floor rooms were open to the public: a bedroom, a theatrical history room, and a drawing room, the last of which was dedicated to May King Van Rensselaer in 1927. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in the late 1920s that the house&#x27;s presence &quot;helps to sustain the old-fashioned atmosphere&quot; of the surrounding blocks, where apartments were quickly being built.

The mansion had 130,000 visitors within a year of its rededication. After the United States Department of War set off explosives in Hell Gate to dredge it, the house&#x27;s ceiling partially collapsed in June 1928, and the house was closed for repairs. The ceiling could not be repaired while blasting continued, but the secretary of war denied that the building had sustained structural damage. In 1929, the city authorized $12,000 in bonds to repair the mansion and add a fence. When the MCNY&#x27;s new building on Fifth Avenue was completed in 1931, the museum moved almost all staff to the new structure. The MCNY moved out of the mansion completely in August 1932, as the museum&#x27;s director said that it had outgrown the house. The empty house was guarded only by a watchman, and NYC Parks had no plans for the mansion.

=== Historic house museum use ===
A renovation of the house commenced in September 1934. Park commissioner Robert Moses had hired Aymar Embury II to design a new porch and redesign the interior, in advance of the house&#x27;s conversion into a historic house museum. Works Progress Administration (WPA) workers added new window sills, roof, clapboard, porch, and heating and lighting systems. None of the original furniture remained, but several organizations agreed to lend furniture to the house, and the Colonial Dames of America redecorated a room. The MCNY gave some musical instruments; the Metropolitan Museum of Art provided 10 paintings and 19 pieces of furniture, and lawyer Francis Patrick Garvan lent 61 pieces of furnishings. Central heating and electricity were also added.

The renovation was completed in April 1936. The ground floor contained a porch, hall, living room, dining room, sitting room, and curator&#x27;s room, while the second floor included a child&#x27;s bedroom, three master bedrooms, and a caretaker&#x27;s apartment. The rooms displayed items such as paintings, four-poster beds, drawers, Chippendale chairs, a piano, and other furniture from the early 19th century. The house attracted relatively few visitors, as the only nearby public transportation was the 86th Street Crosstown Line, a trolley (and later bus) line. A reporter for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; wrote in 1940 that the house &quot;cannot hide from modern visitors its lack of running water and adequate heat&quot; despite the ornate decorations.

Early plans for the East River Drive (now FDR Drive) called for a double-deck section of the parkway to be built straight through the mansion&#x27;s lawn. At the urging of Manhattan borough president Stanley M. Isaacs, this segment was changed to a tunnel in 1938. The tunnel&#x27;s design was intended to preserve the slope of the hill between the mansion and the waterfront, as well as the views from the mansion. Even so, the parkway effectively cut off the mansion from the waterfront. Work on a double-deck section of tunnel, which traveled within of Gracie Mansion, began in February 1940, and the tunnel was finished that June. During the construction of the tunnel, many of the mansion&#x27;s artifacts had to be placed in storage. Members of the public suggested converting the house for other purposes, including a nightclub or a tea room.
== Use as mayor&#x27;s residence ==
Robert Moses had first proposed acquiring an official New York City mayoral residence in 1935. At the time, the city&#x27;s mayors typically lived in their own houses after they were elected; the only indication that a building served as a mayor&#x27;s residence was a special streetlight outside the home. In 1936, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia rejected the idea of acquiring the Charles M. Schwab House as a mayoral residence. In June 1941, Moses received a letter offering to furnish Gracie Mansion as a historic house museum. Moses opposed this proposal and instead suggested this site as a mayoral residence to La Guardia, to which the latter eventually agreed. Moses, in a November 1941 letter to La Guardia, predicted it would cost $25,000 to rebuild the mansion for the mayor.

=== Conversion and La Guardia use ===

A plan to convert Gracie Mansion into New York City&#x27;s mayoral residence was drafted in December 1941, and the New York City Board of Estimate approved the plan unanimously the next month. This made Gracie Mansion one of a few official mayoral residences in the U.S. To convince La Guardia, Moses proposed closing the house&#x27;s restrooms and evicting Carl Schurz Park&#x27;s caretaker from the second floor. Henry Stern, who served as the city&#x27;s park commissioner in the late 20th century, said that Moses&#x27;s proposal was &quot;a great idea, with great foresight&quot;, because it placed the mansion under the purview of the city&#x27;s park department. Conversely, the Citizens Union of New York opposed the plan because it would be inconvenient for city officials and future mayors to travel there from outer boroughs. Another opponent objected to the closure of the historic house museum.

Three museums agreed to lend furnishings for the house, but the Board of Estimate would not pay $5,000 () to borrow these items, although private citizens agreed to provide furnishings. Numerous companies wrote letters to the city government, offering to provide material for the house. WPA workers started renovating the mansion and surrounding grounds on January 22, 1942; although the project was supposed to last three months, it was delayed by labor and material shortages. As part of the project, a master bedroom, kitchen, servants&#x27; rooms, and offices for the park supervisor and the mayor&#x27;s security detail were constructed. In addition, new electrical outlets, a driveway, and an iron fence were added. The only access to the mansion was via the driveway, which was guarded by a police booth. The renovation involved up to 300 workers at once, and the project was completed on May 21. The La Guardia family moved into the mansion on May 27, 1942, when the mayor himself was out of town. La Guardia preferred to call the residence &quot;Gracie Farm&quot;, as he wanted to downplay the house&#x27;s grandeur.

The La Guardia family lived on the second floor. La Guardia&#x27;s wife Marie recalled that her husband often had appointments in the front hall, as a proper reception room would not be added for another two decades. Due to a lack of money and wartime constraints, the La Guardias rarely hosted guests at the mansion. Those they did included George II of Greece (the first monarch to meet with a mayor at the mansion), Cuban president Fulgencio Batista, Czechoslovak president Edvard Beneš, and U.S. General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower. After moving into Gracie Mansion, La Guardia used it as a &quot;summer city hall&quot;. In mid-1942, there were proposals to melt down the mansion&#x27;s iron fence for the World War II effort, although Moses claimed the fence had no salvage value and was essential for security. The businessman Walter Hoving claimed in 1943 that the city could save $100,000 by giving up the mansion and the WNYC radio station, to which Moses claimed that NYC Parks was entirely responsible for the mansion&#x27;s upkeep and that the city did not subsidize the mayor&#x27;s residence at all. The La Guardias moved to Riverdale, Bronx, after La Guardia left office at the end of 1945.

=== 20th century ===

==== O&#x27;Dwyer and Impellitteri use ====
When William O&#x27;Dwyer was elected in 1945, he initially said he would not relocate from his Brooklyn residence. O&#x27;Dwyer reversed his previous decision after determining that the mansion offered more privacy than his own house. The mansion was repainted and refurnished, and the O&#x27;Dwyers moved into the house at the end of January 1946. To give the mayor&#x27;s family more privacy, the lawn to the south and east of the mansion was expanded by in mid-1946. An elevator was installed for O&#x27;Dwyer&#x27;s wife Kitty, who had Parkinson&#x27;s disease, although she did not use the elevator, instead staying on the upper stories with her nurses and housekeeper. Kitty O&#x27;Dwyer died less than a year after moving in. The O&#x27;Dwyers&#x27; official guests included Mexican president Miguel Alemán Valdés (the first head of state to attend an official function there) and U.S. president Harry S. Truman. After O&#x27;Dwyer remarried Elizabeth Sloan Simpson in late 1949, Sloan Simpson indicated that she did not intend to renovate the house. O&#x27;Dwyer and his wife left the mansion after he resigned in August 1950 to become the U.S. ambassador to Mexico.

New York City Council president Vincent R. Impellitteri became the city&#x27;s acting mayor at the beginning of September 1950, and he and his wife Betty moved in shortly after. Betty Impellitteri said she would not redecorate or refurnish the house; the family also kept their old apartment on 16th Street. Even though Impellitteri had been appointed to a four-month term and could not live in the mansion if he lost that year&#x27;s special mayoral election, he decided to use the mansion to receive official visitors. Over the next several years, few people were invited to the house. Impellitteri, who would serve as mayor until 1953, recalled that he did not host any guests overnight, and a &quot;New Yorker&quot; columnist said that the mansion&#x27;s gates were often closed and that the lights were frequently off. During Impellitteri&#x27;s tenure, an Israeli artist&#x27;s oil painting and a portrait of his wife were added to the mansion.

==== Wagner use, development of annex ====

Robert F. Wagner Jr. was elected in 1953, and he and his family moved into the house at the end of January 1954 from their nearby apartment on 86th Street. The facade was repainted, and some of the interior rooms were refurnished; several pieces of art and furniture were placed into storage. Other artifacts, including paintings, tables, and chests, remained in place. The mayor&#x27;s wife Susan asked city workers to seal up the elevators so their young sons, Duncan and Bob, would not play with them. The Wagners added wallpaper and draperies to the rooms, and they added three portraits of women to the living room. but others have claimed that it was an excuse for Adams not to move.

<text>Scipio Africanus (c. 1702 – 21 December 1720) was a former slave born to unknown parents from West Africa. He was named after Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus (236/235–183 BC), the famous Roman general who defeated the Carthaginian military leader Hannibal.

==Life==
Very little is known of Africanus&#x27; life. He was a former slave (since as the courts were to hold in Somersett&#x27;s Case (1772), slavery did not exist in Great Britain under English common law) in the household of Charles William Howard, 7th Earl of Suffolk, who lived in the &quot;Great House&quot; in Henbury, Bristol. It is not clear how he came to the household; historians believe that he may have been born into the household as the son of an enslaved West African woman, and named by Howard. One biographer has suggested that Africanus&#x27; name implies that Howard intended to free him for loyal service because the Roman historian Polybius wrote about how the Roman general Africanus freed people he had enslaved who promised to work hard.

Africanus died in the Great House aged eighteen.

==Grave==

He is remembered because of the elaborate grave, consisting of painted headstone and footstone, in the churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s in Henbury. The grave is grade II* listed. Both stones feature black cherubs and the footstone bears the epitaph:

It is thought that 10,000 black slaves and servants were in Britain in the early 18th century, but this is one of the very few memorials to them. Despite the quality of the memorial, there is no record of his burial in the church registers.

=== 2020 Vandalism ===

Sometime between 16 and 17 June 2020 the headstone was smashed in two, with a message left nearby in chalk suggesting that the vandalism was in retaliation for the pulling down of the statue of Edward Colston by Black Lives Matter protestors, as well as the proposed removal of the gravestone of music hall blackface artist G H Elliott:

The memorial was restored and put back in place in 2021.

==Legacy==
The author Eugene Byrne featured Scipio Africanus in his 2001 alternative history novel &quot;Things Unborn&quot;. In this novel people who had suffered an untimely death were reincarnated in an England recovering from a nuclear war; Scipio Africanus was a famous war hero and a detective inspector in the Metropolitan Police.

The Bristol-based reggae band Black Roots wrote a song about Scipio Africanus which they performed live at Trinity Hall, Bristol on Channel 4&#x27;s 10-part series &quot;Rockers Roadshow&quot;, produced by Mike Wallington and hosted by Mikey Dread in the 1980s. They featured a short scene of the grave.

<doc id="1206283" wikidata="Q4071522" url="?curid=1206283" title="File association">
<text>In computing, a file association associates a file with an application capable of opening that file. More commonly, a file association associates a class of files (usually determined by their filename extension, such as codice_1) with a corresponding application (such as a text editor).

==Associations and verbs==
A single file extension may have several associations for performing various actions, also known as verbs. Some of the common verbs are:
* &quot;open&quot; to open a file
* &quot;edit&quot; to open a file for editing
* &quot;print&quot; to print a file
A picture, for example, may be associated with these words so that &quot;open&quot; opens the picture in an image viewer, &quot;edit&quot; opens up an image editing program and &quot;print&quot; sends the picture to a printer.

==Implementations==
Most operating systems support file associations in some form or the other. For example, opening a file from a file manager usually invokes the &quot;open&quot; verb in order to open the file with its associated application. The &quot;open&quot; verb invokes the associated application program, which reads the file or document and presents it to the user for viewing, and possibly for editing or other action. 

Additional actions such as &quot;print&quot; are usually accessed via a right-click context menu. A mechanism for modifying associations is also usually present. An example for this is the &quot;Open With&quot; option in the Windows Shell.

===Microsoft Windows===
The Microsoft Windows series of operating systems, beginning with Windows 3.x supports file extension-based associations. Associations are stored in registry as sets of verbs for each file extension. Older versions supported &quot;open&quot; associations stored in WIN.INI.
File associations can be displayed and edited using the codice_2 command and with the help of the codice_3 command it is possible to create association between file type and application which will open files of this type.

The Windows shell invokes file association actions through COM, drag and drop, command line calls or through Dynamic Data Exchange. Advanced features of Microsoft Windows file associations included manually defining a new file extension with any number of associated actions, a primary &quot;default action&quot;, showing extensions only for specific file types, customizing the file type icon and description and customizing associated MIME type and their handling (how to handle file types for files downloaded or directly opened from within the Internet Explorer browser). The ability to configure advanced file association functionality, however, was removed in Windows Vista and later operating systems.

===Linux===
Linux-based GUIs, such as KDE and GNOME, support MIME type-based associations. For example, the MIME type codice_4 would be associated with a text editor. This association is generally accomplished through the freedesktop.org Shared MIME database (for determining the MIME type of a file) and the Desktop Entry specification (for determining which application to open the file with).

===Mac OS===
The Classic Mac OS used type codes and creator codes to associate each file with its corresponding application, regardless of file extension. The more recent macOS also supports file extension–based associations.

Application bundles in macOS declare supported file types in their Info.plist file. For each of these specified types, a Uniform Type Identifier is given, along with a list of &#x27;tags&#x27; which define how a file or data of this type could be identified. For example, the JPEG type is defined with a UTI of &#x27;public.jpeg&#x27;, and tagged with the extensions &#x27;jpg&#x27; and &#x27;jpeg&#x27;, the MIME type &#x27;image/jpeg&#x27; and the type code &#x27;JPEG&#x27;.

The operating system uses this information to generate a list of applications which are able to open each type. Within Finder (software) each file will be identified with a UTI and open with the default application for that type. The user may also select from a list of other applications which support the type.

Using this system, types are also associated with data for which there is no file name or the file extension is missing. This includes pasteboard data and data streaming over a protocol such as HTTP where a MIME type has been given.

<text>William Joel Bryan (December 14, 1815 – March 3, 1903) was a Texas soldier and planter.

==Biography==
===Early life===
William Joel Bryan was born on December 14, 1815, at Hazel Run in Sainte Genevieve County, Missouri. His father was James Bryan and his mother, Emily Austin Perry. He was the grandson of Moses Austin and Mary Brown Austin. Stephen F. Austin was his uncle. He had two brothers, Moses Austin Bryan and Guy Morrison Bryan, and a half-brother, Stephen Samuel Perry.

He attended school in Potosi, Missouri, until 1830. In 1831, his mother (Emily) and stepfather, James Franklin Perry, followed his uncle, Stephen F. Austin, to Texas. They settled in the eastern part of Brazoria County, Texas. In 1832, the family moved to the Peach Point Plantation in Jones Creek, Texas, where Bryan was instructed by a governess and his parents together took care of the plantation, cattle and other such property of Bryan&#x27;s uncle. The estate of Stephen F. Austin went in whole to Emily Austin Perry and remained her separate property until she died in 1851.

===Career===
Shortly after Texas declared its independence from Mexico in 1835, Bryan took his part in the siege of Bexar at his uncle&#x27;s side among the Brazoria County Volunteers. He also served with Sam Houston in the retreat of the army across Texas. However, he became ill with the measles shortly before the Battle of San Jacinto.

From 1836 to 1839, he served in a managerial capacity at the Peach Point Plantation. Upon getting married, he became the owner of the Duranzo Plantation in Jones Creek. During the American Civil War of 1861–1865, he fed Confederate troops stationed at the mouth of the Brazos at his own expense.

Shortly after the war, in 1865, he granted the Houston &amp; Texas Central Railroad a right-of-way through his land in Brazos County. A projected townsite, Bryan, Texas, was named in his honor. He gave the town financial assistance and helped to establish its bank.

He was a member of the Texas Veteran&#x27;s Association.

===Personal life===
He married Lavinia Perry, his stepfather&#x27;s niece, in April 1840. The Duranzo Plantation, an extension of Peach Point Plantation, was given to them as dowry. The couple had seven children, four of whom served in the Confederate States Army during the Civil War.

===Death===
He died on March 3, 1903.

==Legacy==
The Brazos County Historical Commission erected an Historical Marker for William Joel Bryan.

<text>SATB is an initialism that describes the scoring of compositions for choirs or consorts of instruments. The initials are for the voice types: S, soprano, A, alto, T, tenor and B, bass. It can also describe a choir, collectively for SATB music. 

==Choral music==
Four-part harmony using soprano, alto, tenor and bass is a common scoring in classical music, including chorales and most Bach cantatas.

The letters of the abbreviation are also used by publishers to describe different scorings for soloists and choirs other than four-part harmony. For example, the listing &quot;STB solos, SATB choir&quot; of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme&quot;, BWV 140, indicates that a performance needs three soloists: soprano, tenor and bass, and a four-part choir. &quot;SATB/SATB&quot; is used when a double choir is required, as in Penderecki&#x27;s &quot;Polish Requiem&quot;. or SSATB, with divided sopranos, is a typical scoring in English church music. A listing for Bach&#x27;s &quot;Mass in B minor&quot; includes the maximum of SSATB soloists and SSAATTBB eight-part choir and also indicates that it contains choral movements for SATB, SSATB, SSATBB and SATB/SATB, as well as arias for individual soloists, and duets for SS, ST and SA.
Other letters of abbreviation, however with less consistency, have been used by publishers, such as &quot;Tr&quot; for treble (boy soprano), &quot;Mz&quot; for mezzo-soprano, &quot;Ba&quot;, &quot;Bar&quot; or &quot;Bari&quot; for baritone, &quot;C&quot; for both canto (the highest part) and contralto, and &quot;Ct&quot; for countertenor. &quot;SATB div.&quot; indicates that parts are sometimes divided (divisi) during a piece, often sharing the same staff.

Moreover, multiple parts can be assigned; first tenors, second basses, and so on.

==Notation==
When the soprano and alto are notated in one staff, all stems for the soprano go up, and all for the alto go down. Similarly, when the tenor and bass are notated in one staff, the upper voice is marked by stems up, and both voices are written in bass clef, while the tenor is usually written in treble clef marked an octave down if it has its own staff.

The rules of voice leading apply to SATB notations.

==Instrumental music==
In a broader sense, choirs of instruments can also be described by the abbreviation SATB, often for members of the same family of instruments, such as consorts of recorders, viola da gamba, saxophones and trombones. The abbreviations are also a common way to describe which &quot;voices&quot; perform in instrumental compositions such as fugues, including Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot; and &quot;The Musical Offering&quot;, written without indicating specific instruments.

<doc id="1206319" wikidata="Q7263961" url="?curid=1206319" title="Pyuntaza">
<text>Pyuntaza (; also spelt Pyuntasa) is a small town located in Nyaunglebin Township, Bago District, Bago Region, Myanmar. It is about from Bago (formerly Pegu).

The dominant ethnic group is Bamar, although there is a substantial number of Karen. The town&#x27;s main economy consists of rice cultivation and distribution.

==Etymology==
The name Pyuntaza comes from the Mon language term &quot;plaem sotchaek&quot; (, ), which means &quot;to break vows.&quot;

==History==
In the colonial era, Pyuntaza was administered as a township of Pegu District in Lower Burma, covering an area of and consisting of 232 villages. The township&#x27;s population in 1901 was 52,952 persons, having more than doubled since 1891 (23,132). The western flank of the former Pyuntaza Township is hilly, while the eastern half is a flat rice-producing area.

From 1920 to 1931, with the emergence of a national railway system extending north–south, Pyuntaza emerged as a railway center town, along with neighbouring Daik-U. By rail, Pyuntaza was from Rangoon (now Yangon).

During World War II, prominent Burmese barrister U Chan Htoon retreated to Pyuntaza as his place of retirement.

<doc id="1206320" wikidata="Q1862021" url="?curid=1206320" title="Henbury, Bristol">
<text>Henbury is a suburb of Bristol, England, approximately north west of the city centre. It was formerly a village in Gloucestershire and is now bordered by Westbury-on-Trym to the south; Brentry to the east and the Blaise Castle Estate, Blaise Hamlet and Lawrence Weston to the west. To the north lie the South Gloucestershire village of Hallen and the entertainment/retail park Cribbs Causeway.

The Hazel Brook (also known as the Hen), a tributary of the River Trym, flows through Henbury and crosses Henbury Road in a small ford near The Henbury Arms carvery restaurant. The ford is more than a foot deep relatively often and a small bridge exists as a main route for motor vehicles a few metres away.

Henbury is also the name of a council ward for Bristol City Council that includes both Henbury and Brentry.

Henbury Golf Club sits on the south border.

== History ==
Henbury was first mentioned in 692 as &quot;Heanburg&quot;. The name is from the Old English &quot;hēan byrig&quot;, meaning &#x27;high fortified place&#x27;. It was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Henberie&quot;.

By a charter purported to date from the 690s Æthelred, king of Mercia, granted land at Henbury to Oftfor, bishop of Worcester, but the authenticity of the charter has been disputed. An 8th century charter grants land at &quot;Heanburu&quot; to the church at Worcester, but the reference may be to Hanbury in Worcestershire. There is more secure evidence that by the 790s Henbury was held by the Bishop of Worcester.

Henbury was historically a very large parish and the centre of a hundred of the same name. The parish extended to the River Severn and included King&#x27;s Weston, Lawrence Weston, Hallen, Charlton, Pilning, Northwick and Aust. When the civil parish was created in 1866, parts of the ancient parish were separated to form the civil parishes of Redwick and Northwick (later Pilning and Severn Beach) and Aust. The parish of Compton Greenfield, including the village of Easter Compton, was added to the civil parish of Henbury in 1885.

In 1901, part of the civil parish was absorbed into Bristol, and further parts were absorbed into Bristol between then and 1933. In 1935, the civil parish was abolished, when the remaining parts were absorbed into the civil parishes of Pilning and Severn Beach, and Almondsbury. In 1931 the parish had a population of 2823.

&quot;Botany Bay&quot; is an old name for the area of Henbury centred on the modern Marmion Crescent believed to derive from the nineteenth-century name of a row of cottages. The Great House, Henbury was the home of the Astry family, and of the slave or manservant Scipio Africanus (see below). Nearby Henbury Court was built by Thomas Stock to replace the Great House. Henbury Court was demolished in the 1950s.

A large council housing estate was built in the area during the 1950s and 1960s to clear slums in central areas of Bristol such as Easton and St Paul&#x27;s, that at the time, was extremely overpopulated and were considered as slums. A landmark of the skyline in Henbury is the two high-rise tower blocks that overlook the estate.

== Churches ==

The parish Church of St Mary the Virgin dates from approximately 1096. The tower is from the early 13th century. The north chapel was built, and further restoration work undertaken by Thomas Rickman in 1836, with further restoration by G. E. Street in 1875–7. It is a grade II* listed building.
The churchyard contains the grave of Scipio Africanus, the west African 18th-century manservant of Charles William Howard, 7th Earl of Suffolk, notable for its brightly painted gravestones.
Emmanuel Chapel Henbury is an independent evangelical church located on Satchfield Crescent.

St Antony&#x27;s Church is a Catholic church which was built in the 1950s and is also located on Satchfield Crescent.

== Schools ==
List of schools in Henbury, Bristol:

* Henbury Court Primary School
* Blaise Primary School
* Blaise High School
* Woodstock Special School

== Other buildings ==

Henbury Village Hall is a Grade II listed building.

Henbury Leisure Centre is home to a 25-metre swimming pool, fitness suite, full-size all-weather pitch and a variety of fitness programmes and classes. It is located on the site of Henbury Secondary School.

The Henbury Lodge Hotel is operated by Best Western. The building itself is believed to have been built around 1600 as two cottages, before being combined into one dwelling in 1712.

== Location and transportation links==

Henbury is served by buses of First West of England, routes 1, 2, 4 and 76.

Henbury provides good access to major trunk roads such as the A4018, M4 and M5 motorways. It is located approximately two miles away from M5 junction 17 and five miles from the M4/M5 interchange. Bristol city centre is approximately five miles south east of Henbury.

Henbury station on the Henbury Loop railway between St Andrews Road and Filton Junction was opened in 1910 and closed in 1964. The station is scheduled to reopen in 2021 as part of MetroWest&#x27;s Phase Two, with trains calling at Bristol Temple Meads railway station.

<doc id="1206324" wikidata="Q1637816" url="?curid=1206324" title="Shōbōgenzō">
<text>is the title most commonly used to refer to the collection of works written in Japan by the 13th-century Buddhist monk and founder of the Sōtō Zen school, Eihei Dōgen. Several other works exist with the same title (see above), and it is sometimes called the Kana Shōbōgenzō in order to differentiate it from those. The term &quot;shōbōgenzō&quot; can also be used more generally as a synonym for Buddhism as viewed from the perspective of Mahayana Buddhism.

==Source of the title==

===Shōbōgenzō as a general term===
In Mahayana Buddhism, the term &quot;True Dharma Eye Treasury&quot; () refers generally to the Buddha Dharma; and in Zen Buddhism, it specifically refers to the realization of Buddha&#x27;s awakening that is not contained in the written words of the sutras.

In general Buddhist usage, the term &quot;treasury of the Dharma&quot; refers to the written words of the Buddha&#x27;s teaching collected in the Sutras as the middle of the Three Treasures of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. In Zen, however, the real treasure of the Dharma is not to be found in books but in one&#x27;s own Buddha Nature and the ability to see this Correct View (first of the Noble Eightfold Path) of the treasure of Dharma is called the &quot;Treasure of the Correct Dharma Eye&quot;.

In the legends of the Zen tradition, the Shōbōgenzō has been handed down from teacher to student going all the way back to the Buddha when he transmitted the Shobogenzo to his disciple Mahākāśyapa thus beginning the Zen lineage that Bodhidharma brought to China.

The legend of the transmission of the Shōbōgenzō to Mahākāśyapa is found in several Zen texts and is one of the most referred to legends in all the writings of Zen. Among the famous koan collections, it appears as Case 6 in the Wumenguan (&quot;The Gateless Checkpoint&quot;) and Case 2 in the Denkoroku (&quot;Transmission of Light&quot;). In the legend as told in the Wumenguan, the Buddha holds up a flower and no one in the assembly responds except for Arya Kashyapa who gives a broad smile and laughs a little. Seeing Mahākāśyapa&#x27;s smile the Buddha said, 
&quot;I possess the Treasury of the Correct Dharma Eye, the wonderful heart-mind of Nirvana, the formless true form, the subtle Dharma gate, not established by written words, transmitted separately outside the teaching. I hand it over and entrust these encouraging words to Kashyapa.&quot;
===Dahui&#x27;s Shōbōgenzō and Dōgen&#x27;s Shinji Shōbōgenzō===
Dahui Zonggao, the famous 12th-century popularizer of koans in Song dynasty China, wrote a collection of kōans with the Chinese title &quot;Zhengfa Yanzang&quot; (正法眼藏). In Japanese this is read as &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot;, using the same kanji for its title as Dōgen&#x27;s later work. When Dōgen visited China in 1223, he first studied under Wuji Lepai, a disciple of Dahui, which is where he probably first came into contact with Dahui&#x27;s &quot;Zhengfa Yanzang&quot;. In his book &quot;Dogen&#x27;s Manuals of Zen Meditation&quot;, the modern scholar Carl Bielefeldt acknowledges that Dōgen likely took the title from Dahui for his own kōan collection, known now as the Shinji Shōbōgenzō. He later used the same title again for what is now his most well-known work, the Kana Shōbōgenzō (now almost always referred to simply as &quot;the Shōbōgenzō&quot;): Indeed the fact that Dōgen styled his effort &quot;Shōbō genzō&quot; suggests that he had as his model a similar compilation of the same title by the most famous of Sung masters, Ta-Hui Tsung-kao [Dahui Zonggao]. Unlike the latter, Dōgen was content here simply to record the stories without interjecting his own remarks. A few years later, however, he embarked on a major project to develop extended commentaries on many of these and other passages from the Ch&#x27;an literature. The fruit of this project was his masterpiece--the remarkable collection of essays known as the kana, or &quot;vernacular&quot;, Shōbō genzō.

==Compilation of the Shōbōgenzō==

The different component texts—referred to as fascicles—of the Kana Shōbōgenzō were written between 1231 and 1253—the year of Dōgen&#x27;s death (Dōgen, 2002, p. xi). Unlike most Zen writings originating in Japan at that time, including Dōgen&#x27;s own Shinji Shōbōgenzō and Eihei Koroku, which were written in Classical Chinese, the &quot;Kana Shōbōgenzō&quot; was written in Japanese. The essays in Shōbōgenzō were delivered as sermons in a less formal style than the Chinese language sermons of the Eihei Koroku. Some of the fascicles were recorded by Dōgen, while others were recorded by his disciples.

Dōgen rearranged the order of the fascicles that make up the Shōbōgenzō several times during his own lifetime, and also edited the content of individual fascicles. After his death, various editors added and removed fascicles to make different versions of the Shōbōgenzō. In pre-modern times there were four major versions that consisted of 60, 75, 12, and 28 fascicles, with the 60-fascicle version being the earliest and the 28-fascicle version the latest. The first two were arranged by Dōgen himself, with the 75-fascicle version containing several fascicles that had been edited from the earlier 60-fascicle version. Several copies of both the 60- and 75-fascicle versions exist, including one containing Dōgen&#x27;s handwriting and that of his student, Koun Ejō. On the other hand, the 12-fascicle version, also known as the Yōkōji manuscript after the temple where it was found in 1936, is known from only two examples, one copied in 1420 and the other recopied from that in 1446. This version contains 5 fascicles not found in the older versions, including the only surviving manuscript of &quot;Ippyakuhachi Hōmyō Mon&quot;&#x27;. It also contains a note at the end of &quot;Hachi Dainin Gaku&quot; written by Koun Ejō indicating that it was to be the last fascicle of a 100-fascicle version; this was never completed due to Dōgen&#x27;s illness near the end of his life. It is unclear which chapters this 100-fascicle version would have included and in what order. Finally, the 28-fascicle version, also known as the Eihei-ji manuscript or the &quot;Secret Shōbōgenzō&quot; (), dates from the mid-1300s and actually only contains 26 fascicles because &quot;Shin Fukatoku&quot; appears twice and &quot;Butsudō&quot; is included twice in two different versions. The fascicles of the Eihei-ji manuscript were taken from the 75- and 12-fascicle versions and still retain the numbering system used from their source collections. &quot;Yoibutsu Yobutsu&quot; is an exception and is numbered as fascicle 38, which does not correspond to any extant version.

Other pre-modern versions of the Shōbōgenzō exist, all of which were rearrangements of the four main versions discussed above, often with additional material from Dōgen that he did not intend to include. Bonsei, who died in the early 15th century, created an 84-fascicle version consisting of the 75-fascicle version plus 9 books from the 60-fascicle version. Four copies of Bonsei&#x27;s collection survive, with the oldest dating from 1644. An 89-fascicle version called the Daijōji manuscript was put together in 1689 by Manzan Dōhaku based on Bonsei&#x27;s version of 84 plus 5 additional fascicles, including &quot;Bendōwa&quot;, &quot;Jūundō Shiki&quot;, and &quot;Jikuin Mon&quot;, which were not previously considered part of the Shōbōgenzō. He also ordered the books based on the date they were written and not on the order Dōgen intended, suggest he likely believed the ordering was a later decision not made by Dōgen himself. Hangyo Kōzen, aiming to make the most comprehensive version of the Shōbōgenzō, compiled a 96-fascicle version called the Komazawa University Library manuscript containing every known book from previous versions except &quot;Ippyakuhachi Hōmyō Mon&quot;. It also included more additional writings, including the apocryphal &quot;Chinzo&quot; and several variant versions of other chapters. Kōzen&#x27;s version became the basis for the first printed version of the Shōbōgenzō, the Honzan edition. Finally, a 78-book version was made by Tenkei Denson while he was preparing his commentary, &quot;Benchū&quot;, on the text. He thought that the 60-fascicle version was compiled by Giun and was the oldest, most correct version, and as result his version is identical for the first 59 fascicles except for two replacements from other versions and one combination of two fascicles into one. The remainder is added from the 12- and 75-fascicle versions with 10 fascicles from those being specifically excluded.

Modern editions of Shōbōgenzō contain 95 fascicles based on the late-17th-century 96-fascicle version of Hangyo Kozen, the 35th abbot of Dōgen&#x27;s monastery Eihei-ji. This began as a 90-fascicle version, the first to be printed on woodblocks rather than hand copied, beginning in 1815 and known as the &quot;Honzan&quot; edition. The six fascicles that were removed included the inauthentic &quot;Chinzo&quot; as well as five chapters regarded as secrets of the Sōtō School. The original woodblocks are now stored at Eihei-ji. In 1906 the revised Honzan version of 95 fascicles including the five &quot;secret&quot; chapters was published. The only chapter originally intended to be part of the Shōbōgenzō missing from the revised Honzan version at this stage was &quot;Ippyakuhachi Hōmyō Mon&quot; because it was not discovered until 1936. In 1929, the &quot;Sōtōshū Zensho&quot; edition was released adding back &quot;Chinzo&quot;. It was removed again in a revised edition in 1970, and then added again in the 1974 &quot;Zoku Sōtōshū Zensho&quot; along with &quot;Ippyakuhachi Hōmyō Mon&quot;. Many other versions were made in the 20th century, some of which indiscriminately combined sections from different manuscripts. Today, arguably the most faithful printed version in Japanese is the 1988 edition compiled by Kōdō Kawamura consisting of the original 75-fascicle version from the single 1547 Ryūmonji manuscript, the 12-fascicle 1446 Yōkōji manuscript, nine uncollected works not originally intended for the Shōbōgenzō, and initial drafts of seven chapters.

==History of textual analysis==
The earliest commentaries on the &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot; were written by two of Dōgen&#x27;s disciples, Yōkō Senne and Kyōgō. Kyōgō compiled two commentaries on the 75-fascicle version of Dōgen&#x27;s &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot;, the first of which is called &quot;Shōbōgenzō shō&quot; (正法眼蔵抄) and the second &quot;Shōbōgenzō gokikigaki&quot; (正法眼蔵御聴書). Collectively, they are called &quot;Gokikigakishō&quot; (御聴書抄), which is usually abbreviated as &quot;Goshō&quot; (御抄). Senne is believed to be the author of the Shōbōgenzō &quot;Gokikigaki&quot; due to the use of the honorific modifier go (御), which would not normally be used to refer to one&#x27;s own writing. The &quot;Gokikigaki&quot; contains a date of 1263, suggesting Senne may have completed it around that time. Kyōgō began his Shōbōgenzō shō in 1303 and completed it in 1308. There is no evidence that these commentaries were widely read at the time they were produced. In fact, the first time the &quot;Goshō&quot; is known to be mentioned in historical documents is in 1586, when it was saved from a fire at Senpuku-ji, a temple in Oita Prefecture in Kyushu. The Buddhist studies scholar Genryū Kagamishima has written that Senne and Kyōgō&#x27;s commentaries form the doctrinal core of the modern Sōtō Zen school.

Within a few generations of Dōgen&#x27;s death, the historical record becomes mostly silent on textual engagement with Dōgen&#x27;s work, including the &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot;. Although most important Sōtō Zen temples had copies of one or more fascicles of the &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot;, access was restricted to senior monks at that particular temple, making textual comparisons or compilations virtually impossible. Due to the many different recessions of the text—the 60-, 75-, 12-, 25-fascicle versions discussed above—scribal errors, and variant versions of individual fascicles, the Shōbōgenzō was thought to possibly be inauthentic at the beginning of a Tokugawa Era. In 1700, Manzan Dōhaku appealed to the authority of the &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot; when petitioning the government&#x27;s Agency of Temples and Shrines to abolish the temple-dharma lineage system (&quot;garanbō&quot;) which had arisen several generations after Dōgen&#x27;s death and tied a monk&#x27;s lineage not to his teacher, but to a temple. In 1703 the government not only agreed with Manzan, but proclaimed that the Sōtō school must base its practices on Dōgen&#x27;s teachings. From this point, study and analysis of &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot; greatly increased.

One of the earliest commentaries on the Shōbōgenzō was written by a monk named Tenkei Denson (1638–1735) in opposition to the emerging pro-Dōgen movement led by Manzan. Tenkei&#x27;s commentary, called &quot;Benchū&quot;, was written from 1726 to 1729 using the 60-fascicle version. In it, he harshly criticized the text, rejected several fascicles altogether, and made extensive &quot;corrections&quot; and revisions to the source text. Mujaku Dōchū (1653–1744), a Rinzai monk, wrote a commentary from 1725 to 1726 that made many of the same points. Both Tenkei and Mujaku argued for a unity of all schools of Zen, but the Shōbōgenzō harshly criticized some approaches to Zen practice, especially those found in Rinzai lineages in China during Dōgen&#x27;s life. Tenkei and Mujaku both also argued that Dōgen did not understand Chinese grammar based on his unusual interpretation of Chinese quotations. Tenkei also consulted Senne and Kyōgō&#x27;s &quot;Goshō&quot; commentary discussed above, but rejected it.

Around the same time Menzan Zuihō was dedicating much of his life to analyzing the Shōbōgenzō in order to uncover Dōgen&#x27;s source material. Menzan&#x27;s student Fuzan and his students put this extensive study into writing in the 1770s. Menzan also made extensive use of Senne and Kyōgō&#x27;s &quot;Goshō&quot; commentary in when studying the Shōbōgenzō, and he criticized Tenkei for having rejected it. Within a few years the monk Honkō made a commentary on the text and translated it into what was at the time the more respectable language of Classical Chinese. Commentaries were also made by the monks Zōkai and Rōran. An abridged collection of a variety of Dōgen&#x27;s work appeared at this time called &quot;The Record of Eihei Dogen&quot;, which the famous poet Ryōkan wrote a verse on.

<doc id="1206328" wikidata="Q3646473" url="?curid=1206328" title="Budokwai">
<text>in London is the oldest Japanese martial arts club in Europe. It was founded in 1918 by Gunji Koizumi and initially offered tuition in jujutsu, kendo, and other Japanese martial arts. It was the first judo club in Europe.

==Name and symbol==
The full name of the society is the Budokwai (The Way of Knighthood Society) but it is normally called The Budokwai. The name Budokwai was chosen by the society&#x27;s founder Gunji Koizumi as a combination of the Japanese words bu (武) meaning military or martial, do (道) meaning the way or code, kwai (会) meaning public building or a society/club. This translates into English as Society of the Martial Way.

The symbol of the Budokwai is a stylised version of the kanji 武 in white on a blue cherry blossom, Koizumi said he chose the design as the character bu is made from the components 止, meaning stop, and 戈, meaning spear or fighting because &quot;the aim of martial training is to stop fighting.&quot;

==History==
Gunji Koizumi created the Budokwai as a society to teach judo, kendo and other Japanese arts to members of the public. He founded a dojo at 15 Lower Grosvenor Place, Victoria, London SW1 and the club official opened on Saturday 26 January 1918 with 12 members, making it the oldest judo club in Europe. It is also the oldest Japanese martial arts club in Europe. The first 36 members were Japanese, the first English man didn&#x27;t join until March and the first English woman, Katherine Cooper-White, becoming the 60th member. Koizumi became the first president of the Budokwai and Yukio Tani the first chief judo instructor.

In July 1920, Dr. Jigoro Kano (the founder of judo) visited Britain and the Budokwai for the first time, he was accompanied by Hikoichi Aida who stayed in Britain and instructed at the Budokwai for two years. A member named Tanabe received his first &quot;Dan&quot;, becoming the Budokwai&#x27;s first home-grown black belt. Tani and Koizumi were promoted to &quot;nidan&quot;. The club held annual shows between 11 May 1918 and 1968 after which shows were only held on special occasions.

The Budokwai was instrumental in the formation of the first British national and European wide judo organisations. Koizumi discussed his idea of forming a British nation Judo organisation and a European organisation with the Budokwai committee and in 1948 the chairman of the Budokwai, John Barnes, invited all British Judo clubs and all the Judo and Jujitsu clubs in Europe to a conference hosted by the Budokwai. The British Conference was held on 24 July 1948 at the Imperial College Union, London and during that three-hour meeting the British Judo Association was founded. This was the first ever amateur national judo association. The international conference took place on 26 and 28 July 1948 with four voting countries, Austria, Britain, the Netherlands and Italy, and one non-voting country, France, attending. The Budokwai&#x27;s Trevor Leggett was elected the conference&#x27;s chairman and a constitution drafted by the Budikwai was tabled. After alterations and discussion of the constitution a unanimous vote formed the European Judo Union.

In 1953 Teizo Kawamura, then a 6th Dan, came from the Kodokan in Japan to become chief instructor. After thirty-five years, the Budokwai moved to 4 Gilston Road, South Kensington, London, SW10 9SL. The new premises were officially opened in September 1954 by the Japanese Ambassador H.E. Matsumoto throwing Kawamura. In 1955 Charles Palmer and Geof Gleeson became chief instructors at the Budokwai. In the 1960s the club began teaching karate with links to the Japan Karate Association with a number of Japanese instructors teaching at the Budokwai, including Keinosuke Enoeda 1963 All-Japan champion, who became the chief instructor. In the same decade aikido began to be practiced at the club. With the growth of international Judo competition and especially when judo became an Olympic sport in 1964 the emphasis of judo at the Budokwai moved towards sport and competition judo. Three Budokwai members made were part of the first British Olympic team, Brian Jacks, Syd Hoare and Tony Sweeney.

==Activities==
In 2017 The Budokwai ran classes in Judo, Karate, Aikido, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Pilates, Hontai Yōshin-Ryū Ju-Jutsu and activities for babies and toddlers. Judo is taught every day with separate classes held for children of different ages, adult beginners and experienced judoka. Separate grading events take place once a month on Sundays. As of 2013, the chief instructor is Peter Blewett who has held the post since 1986 and the head junior instructor is Larry Stevenson.

Shotokan Karate is practiced five days a week at the Budokwai with both children&#x27;s and adult classes. The chief karate instructor is Yoshinobu Ohta who holds a karate 7th Dan. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is run by Ray Stevens. Hontai Yōshin-ryū ju-jutsu takes place once a week with instructor Dr. Mike McClure 6th Dan.

==The Budokwai in the media==
The Budokwai had a showreel filmed in 2014, directed by actor/director Lucy Charles and shot by WhitePartridge Media. In recent years, The Budokwai has also featured on BT Sport&#x27;s &quot;Beyond the Octagon&quot;, BBC One&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot; and most recently in a short film for The British Open. The film was commissioned by the British Judo Association, and starred Peter Blewett and Kyle Perry. The film, &quot;Hard Lesson The Gentle Way&quot; was produced and directed by Lucy Charles, The Sports Presentation Company and Six More Than Forty.

&quot;The Pyjama Game&quot; a book by Mark Law was described by the Observer as &quot;A fascinating journey in which he unravels this most opaque of sports with humour, verve and style. Part travelogue, part history, part chronicle of midlife discovery, &quot;The Pyjama Game&quot; is an illuminating exposition of an enigmatic and marginal sport.&quot; Independent on Sunday &quot;A fantastic voyage, beautifully written, through this most challenging of sports.&quot; Matthew d&#x27;Ancona in The Spectator called it &quot;a brilliant exploration of judo&quot;. The Pyjama Game, which tells the story of judo from its Samurai origins through its development by Jigoro Kano and adoption across the world, includes accounts of the careers of some of the greatest champions including Yasuhiro Yamashita, Neil Adams, Katsuhiko Kashiwazaki and Tamura Ryoko Tani. Mark Law has trained at the Budokwai in Chelsea, London since 1994 where he has studied under Tony Sweeney, Ray Stevens, Peter Blewett, Winston Gordon and Roger Gracie.

A portrait painting of Yukio Tani by George Lambourn, in the ownership of The Budokai, was restored by Lucia Scalisi during an August 2018 episode of the BBC Television programme &quot;The Repair Shop&quot;.

==Governance==
The Budokwai is a democratic non-profit making organisation with full, associated and honorary members. Only full members have financial responsibility and voting rights in the club and there can only be 45 full members. Peter Blewett is the current Chairman of the Executive Committee.

==Notable members==
The budokwai&#x27;s membership has included a number of notable individuals. In March 1936 Sarah Mayer became the first non-Japanese woman to gain a Dan grade (black belt) in Judo. She had started practicing judo at the Budokwai in the 1920s before traveling independently to Japan in 1934 with a letter of introduction from the Budokwai to train in judo. As of 2013 Olympian judoka Raymond Stevens and Winston Gordon are active members, other Olympian members have included Neil Adams, Brian Jacks and Angelo Parisi.

<text>In cryptography, residual block termination is a variation of cipher block chaining mode (CBC) that does not require any padding. It does this by effectively changing to cipher feedback mode for one block. The cost is the increased complexity.

==Encryption procedure==
If the plaintext length &quot;N&quot; is not a multiple of the block size &quot;L&quot;:
*Encrypt the ⌊&quot;N&quot;/&quot;L&quot;⌋ full blocks of plaintext using the cipher block chaining mode;
*Encrypt the last full encrypted block again;
*XOR the remaining bits of the plaintext with leftmost bits of the re-encrypted block.

==Decryption procedure==
*Decrypt the ⌊&quot;N&quot;/&quot;L&quot;⌋ full encrypted blocks using the Cipher Block Chaining mode;
*Encrypt the last full encrypted block;
*XOR the remaining bits of the ciphertext with leftmost bits of the re-encrypted block.

==Short message==
For messages shorter than one block, residual block termination can use an encrypted initialization vector instead of the previously encrypted block.</text><links>

<doc id="1206343" wikidata="Q7042978" url="?curid=1206343" title="No. 149 Squadron RAF">
<text>No. 149 Squadron RAF was a Royal Air Force Squadron between 1918 and 1956. Formed 1918 in the Royal Flying Corps as a night-bomber unit, it remained in that role for the rest of its existence which spanned three periods between 1918 and 1956.

==History==

===World War I===
Formed on 3 March 1918 at Royal Flying Corps Station Ford, near Yapton, West Sussex, as No. 149 (NB) Squadron RFC, the squadron soon moved to France for night bombing missions above occupied France and Belgium, flying Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2s. After the war the squadron for three months took part in the occupation force in Germany, being stationed at Bickendorf, moving to Ireland in March 1919 where the squadron was disbanded on 1 August 1919.

===World War II===
====Vickers Wellington====

The squadron was reformed from &#x27;B&#x27; Flight of No. 99 Squadron RAF on 12 April 1937 under No. 3 Group RAF at RAF Mildenhall, Suffolk where it remained until April 1942. Initially equipped with Heyford biplane bombers, the squadron converted to Vickers Wellingtons in January 1939. On 4 September 1939 L4259 was flown on &quot;Ops Brunsbüttel 4/500 GP&quot;, the day after the declaration of war against Germany by Great Britain. (Source Pilot&#x27;s Logbook).

====Target for Tonight====
During the last two weeks of March and the first two weeks of April 1941, Wellingtons and their crews of No. 149 Sqn were used for the making of the film &quot;Target for Tonight&quot;. Filmed on location at RAF Mildenhall, the Station took the fictitious name of Millerton Aerodrome in order so not to give away valuable operational information to the enemy, and several other aspects were altered involving the day-to-day operations. The film, produced by the Crown Film Unit, focused on the planning and execution of an air raid on Germany, as seen by the crew of Vickers Wellington OJ-F &#x27;F for Freddie&#x27;. The exception to this was Percy Pickard who was at that time Squadron Leader with No. 311 (Czechoslovak) Squadron. Pickard played the part of Sqn Ldr Dickson, the captain of &#x27;F for Freddie&#x27;.

====Short Stirling====
After being re-equipped with the Short Stirling in November 1941, the squadron took part in the first 1,000 bomber raid. The squadron also formed No. 149 Squadron Conversion flight on 21 January 1942 to train new Stirling crews and on 7 October this was formed into 1657 Heavy Conversion Unit together with 7, 101 and 218 Squadron Conversion Flights. In August 1944, the Stirlings gave way to Avro Lancasters, which served the squadron until 1949. At the end of the war no. 149 squadron participated in Operation Manna, to drop food to the starved Dutch population still under German occupation, and Operation Exodus, to return former prisoners of war back to the UK.

===Post war===
After the war no. 149 squadron continued to fly with RAF Bomber Command, moving to RAF Tuddenham in April 1946 and then later in November on to RAF Stradishall. In February 1949 the squadron returned to RAF Mildenhall, where the Lancasters were replaced with Avro Lincolns. The squadron remained at Mildenhall until disbanding on 1 March 1950.

Retirement was short though, because on 14 August 1950 the squadron was reformed as the RAF&#x27;s first Boeing Washington bomber unit, moving to RAF Coningsby in October of that year. The Washingtons were on loan by the RAF from the USAF as an interim nuclear bomber pending the arrival of the RAF&#x27;s own jet bomber, the Canberra. The squadron reequipped with the Canberra in March 1953 and in August 1954 it relocated to RAF Ahlhorn in West-Germany, where it joined 125 wing of Royal Air Force Germany. The following month it moved again, this time to RAF Gutersloh, where it the unit had its final disbandment two years later on 31 August 1956.

<doc id="1206356" wikidata="Q1277369" url="?curid=1206356" title="Macedonian Struggle">
<text>The Macedonian Struggle was a series of social, political, cultural and military conflicts that were mainly fought between Greek and Bulgarian subjects who lived in Ottoman Macedonia between 1893 and 1912. The conflict was part of a wider guerrilla war in which revolutionary organizations of Greeks, Bulgarians and Serbs all fought over Macedonia. Gradually the Greek and Bulgarian bands gained the upper hand. Though the conflict largely ceased by the Young Turk Revolution, it continued as a low intensity insurgency until the Balkan Wars.

==Background==

Initially the conflict was waged through educational and religious means, with a fierce rivalry developing between supporters of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (Greek-speaking or Slavic/Romance-speaking people who generally identified as Greek), and supporters of the Bulgarian Exarchate, which had been recognized by the Ottomans in 1870.
As Ottoman rule in the Balkans crumbled in the late 19th century, competition arose between Greeks and Bulgarians (and to a lesser extent also other ethnic groups such as Serbs, Aromanians and Albanians) over the multi-ethnic region of Macedonia. The Bulgarians founded in 1893 the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (initially known as Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Revolutionary Committees) which coordinated the majority of Bulgarian actions in the region. The defeat of Greece in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 was a loss that appalled Greeks which led to the dissolution of the Ethniki Eteria, by Prime Minister Georgios Theotokis. With little prospect of liberation by Greece, the Macedonian Greeks took their fate into their own hands and began to form various armed bands that would ultimately fall under the control of the Hellenic Macedonian Committee. The region quickly became a constant battleground among various armed groups, with hostilities peaking in 1904-1908. The Ottoman Army was also involved in the conflict and perpetuated atrocities against the Christian population in attempt to quell the unrest. Due to the Christian population of Macedonia, whether Greek, Serb, Bulgarian or Aromanian, engaging in more or less constant rebellion against the Ottoman Empire, in conjunction with the revolutionary activities of Armenian nationalists in Anatolia, many Ottoman officers believed that all Christians of the empire were disloyal and treasonous.

==Bulgarian activity==
=== Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation ===

In 1893, Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) had been founded in Thessaloniki. Initially its membership was allowed only for Bulgarians, but later it opened itself to all ethnic groups in Macedonia and Adrianople regions. Earlier on, IMRO claimed that it was fighting for the autonomy of Macedonia and not for annexation to Bulgaria. However, later it became an agent serving Bulgarian interests in Balkan politics with the aim of eventually uniting the entirety of Macedonia with Bulgaria, first in struggles against the Ottoman Empire and later against the Serbian-led Yugoslav successor state controlling the territory of Vardar Macedonia and the Greek state which controlled the southern portion of the region. One major event representing the culmination of these actions is the assassination of the Serbian King of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes during the inter-war period by an IMRO sniper. In practice, most of the followers of the IMRO were native Macedonian Bulgarians, though they also had some Aromanian allies, like Pitu Guli, Mitre The Vlach, Ioryi Mucitano and Alexandru Coshca. In April 1903, a group known as the &quot;Boatmen of Thessaloniki,&quot; with assistance from the IMRO, blew up the French ship &quot;Guadalquivir&quot; and the Ottoman Bank in Thessaloniki. In August 1903, the IMRO organised the Ilinden Uprising in Macedonia and the Adrianople Vilayet which led to the formation of the short-lived Kruševo Republic. The uprising was ultimately suppressed by the Ottoman Army with the subsequent destruction of many villages and the devastation of large areas in Western Macedonia and around Kırk Kilise near Adrianople. The IMRO ultimately weakened due to a split into a left-wing faction (federalist) and a right-wing faction (centralists) following the failed Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising. Many of the members of the organization saw Macedonian autonomy as an intermediate step to unification with Bulgaria, but others saw as their aim the creation of a Balkan federal state, with Macedonia as an equal member.

=== Bulgarian efforts ===
Already from 1895 the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committees were formed in Sofia in order to reinforce the Bulgarian actions in Ottoman Empire. One of Komitadjis&#x27; first activities was the capture of the predominantly Greek town of Meleniko (today Melnik, Bulgaria), but they couldn&#x27;t hold it for more than a few hours. Bulgarian bands destroyed the Pomak village of Dospat where they massacred local inhabitants. This kind of activity alerted Greeks and Serbians, who made a farce of the slogan &quot;Macedonia to Macedonians&quot;, being against the constitution of Macedonia as separate state.
 As Bulgarian efforts intensified, they started to affect European public opinion.

==Greek activity==
=== Hellenic Macedonian Committee ===

In order to strengthen Greek efforts for Macedonia, the Hellenic Macedonian Committee was founded in 1903 by Stefanos Dragoumis and functioned under the leadership of wealthy publisher Dimitrios Kalapothakis. Its members included many Greek notables in addition to the fighters. Among its members were Ion Dragoumis and Pavlos Melas. Its fighters were known as &quot;Makedonomachoi&quot; (&quot;Macedonian fighters&quot;).

Under these conditions, in 1904 a vicious guerrilla war broke as response of IMRO activities between Bulgarian and Greek bands within Ottoman Macedonia. The Bishop of Kastoria, Germanos Karavangelis, who was sent to Macedonia by Nikolaos Mavrokordatos, the ambassador of Greece, and Ion Dragoumis, the consul of Greece in Monastir, realised that it was time to act in a more efficient way and began to organise the intensification of the Greek opposition.

While Dragoumis concerned himself with the financial organisation of the efforts, the central figure in the military struggle was the very capable Cretan officer Georgios Katechakis. Bishop Germanos Karavangelis travelled to raise morale and encourage the Greek population to take action against the IMRO. Many committees were also formed to promote the Greek national interests.

Katechakis and Karavangelis succeeded in the recruitment and organization of guerrilla groups that were later reinforced with volunteers from Greece. Volunteers often came from Crete and the Mani area of the Peloponnese. They even recruited former IMRO members, taking advantage of their political and/or personal disputes within the organisation. Additionally, officers of the Hellenic Army were encouraged to join the struggle to provide experienced leadership, as many had served in the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. The officers who elected to join provided a logistical advantage to the Makedonomachoi. The Macedonian Greeks, however, would form the core of the fighting force and proved to be the most important fighters due to their knowledge of the region&#x27;s geography and some possessing knowledge of the Bulgarian language. Many local Greeks, such as Periklis Drakos, were also involved in the smuggling and stashing of weapons and ammunition around the region.
=== Greek efforts ===
The Greek state became concerned, not only because of Bulgarian penetration in Macedonia but also due to Serbian interests, which were concentrated mainly in Üsküp and Monastir area. The rioting in Macedonia, especially the death of Pavlos Melas in 1904, caused intense nationalistic feelings in Greece. This led to the decision to send more volunteers to reinforce and better organise the armed bands and thwart the Bulgarian efforts to bring all of the Slavic-speakers of Macedonia on under their influence.

The Greek General Consulate in Thessaloniki, under Lambros Koromilas, became the centre of the struggle, coordinating the Greek bands, distributing, and nursing the wounded. Fierce conflicts between the Greeks and Bulgarians started in the area of Kastoria, in the Giannitsa Lake area, and elsewhere. During 1905, guerrilla activity increased and the Makedonomachoi gained significant advantage within 10 months, extending their control towards the areas of Mariovo and East Macedonia, Kastanohoria (near Kastoria), the plains north and south of Florina and the routes around Monastir. However, from early 1906 the situation became critical and the forces of the Makedonomachoi were forced to withdraw from various areas. Nevertheless, the groups of Tellos Agras and Ioannis Demestichas had some success in the marsh of Giannitsa. There were great advances of the Serb forces, joined by Muslim Slavs, in summer of 1906 in the northern areas of the Sanjak of Üsküp.

While the armed bands confronted the Ottoman Army, the Ottoman administration often ignored the activities of the Greek guerrillas, and according to Dakin assisted them against the Bulgarians outright. However, once the subversive potential of the Bulgarians had been neutralised, Ottoman policy ended the favourable neutrality to the Greek side and embarked upon relentless persecutions against the Greeks. During the course of the conflict Greek armed bands numbered 2,000 men. Of whom over 700 were killed in action along with 1,250 pro-Greek civilians.

==Aromanian activity==

The Greek–Romanian conflict concerning the Aromanians reached its climax during the Macedonian Struggle, with Aromanians being no longer divided into pro-Greek and pro-Romanian factions but into &quot;Greeks&quot; and &quot;Romanians&quot; proper. The pro-Greek faction was the largest and most powerful.

=== Pro-Greek Aromanians ===
Most Aromanians during the Macedonian Struggle were pro-Greek, supporting the Greek revolutionaries and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. These Aromanians escaped or resisted the influence of Romanian interventionism, in which a considerable amount of money was spent on by the Romanian state. They were indifferent or even hostile to their national movement. In the archives of the Greek Foreign Ministry there are numerous testimonies from Aromanian communities denouncing Romanian &quot;propaganda&quot; and proclaiming their Greekness.
In Veria, there was a small local unit which was under the leadership of a pro-Greek Aromanian, Tasos Koukotegos. This unit, being small and somewhat isolated, had been operating without definite objectives, but it proved to be very important for the Greek cause as it helped in fights against local Turkish chiefs, pro-Romanian Aromanians, and Bulgarian &quot;komitadjis&quot;. Additionally, local support from pro-Greek Aromanians in Kastoria empowered Greek activity in the region. A notable Greek &quot;makedonomachos&quot; of Aromanian descent was Anastasios Pichion.

In Pelagonia, the pro-Greek sentiments of Aromanians during the Macedonian Struggle contributed to their displacement. When they migrated to Greece, they were already financially ruined.

=== Pro-Bulgarian Aromanians ===

Many Aromanians were also pro-Bulgarian, joining their efforts in the struggle. They were aligned with the Bulgarian Exarchate rather than the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and sympathized with the goals and aspiration of the Bulgarian cause. Some notable pro-Bulgarian Aromanians include Pitu Guli and Mitre Pangiaru.

=== Pro-Romanian Aromanians ===
As the Bulgarians had managed to introduce their language in church services and education in the Ottoman Empire, so did the pro-Romanian Aromanians start demanding the same rights. The Greek Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople reacted strongly to this however amid increased rivalry in the region and eight Aromanian churches were closed by his personal order in 1875. This produced protests from the pro-Romanian Aromanians to the Ottoman and Romanian government, and also increased tensions between the pro-Romanian Aromanians and the Greeks as well as with pro-Greek Aromanians, which led to physical violence that often ended in fatalities.

In 1903, following the failure of the Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising in which many pro-Romanian Aromanian and Bulgarian soldiers had fought with the aim of creating a Macedonian autonomy, the Ottoman Empire allowed the intervention of Greek militias, known as antartes and formed within Greece with commanders from the Greek state, to suppress potential renewed attempts of this objective. These commanders began to threaten the leaders of various Romanian schools in Aromanian villages, warning them that if they did not close down their activities, they would be attacked. Given this, some pro-Romanian Aromanian fighters referred to as armatoles (, in singular) began to take up arms, the first ones being Mihail Handuri from Livadia ( or ) and Hali Joga from (), who having been joined by various young pro-Romanian Aromanian fighters, began to attack Greek bands in the area of Edessa and Veria. These pro-Romanian Aromanian bands were allied with Bulgarian bands in Ottoman Macedonia. In 1906, under Ioryi Mucitano, they were organized into two committees, one in Bucharest led by Alexandru Coshca and Sterie Milioru and the other in Sofia led by Mucitano. He decided to divide their area of operations into districts led by a so-called voivode. These bands were allowed free passage by Bulgarian villages.

=== Clashes ===
Starting from summer of 1904, clashes between pro-Romanian Aromanian and ethnic Greek or pro-Greek Aromanian bands, be it only between themselves or with other combatants involved, erupted in the village of Condusula (between Edessa and Naousa), Ano Grammatiko, Pyrgoi and Dervent. Pro-Greek schools and churches were destroyed by the pro-Romanian Aromanians and pro-Greek Aromanians retaliated by doing the same to pro-Romanian schools and churches. The two factions expelled each other and even murdered opponent schoolteachers and clergy. One such case took place in 1911, when komitadjis and pro-Romanian Aromanians murdered , . Another example is , an Aromanian priest murdered in 1914 by Greek antartes.

Greeks and pro-Greek Aromanians suffered attacks from Turkish troops and &quot;bashibazouks&quot; who killed 41 of them and destroyed 366 and 203 of their houses and shops respectively.

==Albanian activity==
=== Conflict with Serbian Chetniks ===
In 1907, Idriz Seferi came into conflict with Serbian Chetniks that were operating in Eastern Kosovo. Radivojević and his Serbian Chetnik band were sent across Kosovo as aid to fight the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization at Vardar, they were all wearing Albanian clothes with the plan to reach Poreče disguised as Albanian kachaks. However, they were discovered and in July Idriz fought and killed Dragoljub Nikolić and Rade Radivojević, both high ranking Serbian Chetniks, along with their entire Četa in Pasjane and Gjylekar.

=== Conflict with the Ottomans ===

In July, during the Albanian revolt of 1912, the Albanian rebels gathered their forces in Kosovo after successfully capturing major cities in the region, including Pristina, Ferizaj, and Gjakova, which were previously under control of the Ottoman Empire. As early August approached, Albanian troops embarked on a southwards march to the provincial capital, Üsküp (Skopje). A four-day battle ensued, which ended in an Albanian Victory and the capture of Üskup by Albanian rebels. Following this battle, Albanian rebels from the Karadak Mountains (Skopska Crna Gora), under Idriz Seferi, marched on Kumanova and Preševo, liberating both of them. 

==Crimes==
War crimes were committed by both sides during the Macedonian struggle. According to a 1900 British report compiled by Alfred Biliotti, who is considered to have heavily relied on Greek intelligence agents, starting from 1897, the members of the Exarchist committees had embarked upon a systematic and extensive campaign of executions of the leading members of the Greek side. Moreover, Bulgarian Komitadjis, pursued a campaign of extermination of Greek and Serbian teachers and clergy. On the other hand, there were attacks by Greek Andartes on many Macedonian Bulgarian villages, with the aim of forcing their inhabitants to switch their allegiance from the Exarchate back to the Patriarchate and accept Greek priest and teachers, but they also carried out massacres against the civilian population, especially in the central parts of Macedonia in 1905 and in 1906. One of the notable cases was the massacre at the village Zagorichani (today Vasiliada, Greece), which was a Bulgarian Exarchist stronghold near Kastoria on 25 March 1905, where between 60 and 78 villagers were killed by Greek bands.

According to British reports on political crimes (including the above-mentioned Biliotti report), during the period from 1897 to 1912 over 4000 political murders were committed (66 before 1901, 200 between 1901 and 1903, 3300 between 1903 and 1908 and 600 between 1908 and 1912), excluding those killed during the Ilinden Uprising and the members of the Bulgarian and Greek bands. Of those who were killed, 53% were Bulgarians, 33.5% were Greeks, Serbs and Aromanians together 3.5% and 10% were of unknown ethnicity.

These conflicts decreased their intensity after the revolution of Young Turks in July 1908, as they promised to respect all ethnicities and religions, and to provide a constitution.

==Consequences==

The success of Greek efforts in Macedonia was an experience that gave confidence to the country. It helped develop an intention to annex Greek-speaking areas, and bolster Greek presence in the still Ottoman ruled Macedonia.
The events in Macedonia, specifically the consequences of the conflicts between Greek and Bulgarian national activists, including Greek massacres against the Bulgarian population in 1905 and 1906, gave rise to pogroms against the ca. 70,000–80,000-strong Greek communities that lived in Bulgaria, who were considered to share responsibility for the actions of the Greek guerrilla groups.

Nevertheless, the Young Turk movement resulted in a few instances of collaboration between Greek and Bulgarian bands, while this time the official policy in both countries continue to support the penetration of armed fighters into Ottoman Macedonia, but without having fully ensured that there would be no attacks on each other.

== Commemoration and historiography ==
Many museums have been dedicated to the conflict, including:
* Museum for the Macedonian Struggle in Thessaloniki, which is housed in the former Greek consulate
* Museum of the Macedonian Struggle in Kastoria
* Museum of the Macedonian Struggle in Chromio
* Museum of the Macedonian Struggle in Skopje.

There have been fiction and non-fiction accounts of the events of the struggle and its participants, including:
* Greek writer Penelope Delta wrote the novel [; The Secrets of the Swamp] about the fighting around the Giannitsa Lake. 
* Germanos Karavangelis published his memoirs as [The Macedonian Struggle].
* The 1973 Greek film &quot;Pavlos Melas&quot; depicts the life and death of Pavlos Melas.
* Albert Sonnichsen, an American volunteer in the IMRO depicted Bulgarian activities in the book &quot;Confessions of a Macedonian Bandit: A Californian in the Balkan Wars&quot;.

<text>Dundas is a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Dundas is located 21 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Parramatta, and the electoral division of Bennelong. Dundas is a leafy green suburb, notably due to its centrepiece The Ponds Walk, which follows the Ponds Subiaco Creek. Dundas&#x27;s postcode is part of the Northern Sydney region.

==History==
Dundas and surrounding areas were originally known as &quot;The Ponds&quot;, a name still reflected in The Ponds Creek. The first private land grants in Sydney made in 1791 were in what is now North East Dundas and adjoining Dundas Valley and Ermington. This consisted of land grants to 14 former convicts and their families along the Ponds and Subiaco Creeks.

Reverend Samuel Marsden selected an area of 100 acres in the Field of Mars Parish, and named his farm &quot;Dundas Farm&quot; in honour of Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville., who was also the Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department. The area, nonetheless, was not known as Dundas until almost a century later.

The name Dundas came from one of the &quot;hundreds&quot; in which the County of Cumberland was divided into. The Hundred of Dundas was a county division that stretched from the Field of Mars Parish in the south to Berowra and surrounding parishes to the far north. The Field of Mars including the modern-day suburbs of Marsfield, Macquarie Park, Carlingford, Epping and Dundas.

When the Dundas Post Office on Kissing Point Road opened on 1 March 1861, it was called the Pennant Hills Post Office, but this changed to Field of Mars in 1867. In 1890 it was finally called Dundas Post Office. In this interim period, the area was known as Pennant Hills within the Field of Mars, a name reflected in the notable Pennant Hills (Quarry), visited by Charles Darwin, that operated in the area for some time.

<text>Viterbo University is a private Catholic university in La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States. Founded in 1890 by the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration, Viterbo is home to three colleges with nine schools offering 48 academic programs at the associate, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral levels.

Viterbo is one of 23 Franciscan universities in the United States, with 2,521 undergraduate and graduate students and over 23,000 alumni. As of 2020, Viterbo&#x27;s endowment was a record $55.7 million. Viterbo is a member of the NAIA and the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference; its athletic teams are known as the V-Hawks.

==History==
In 1890, the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration founded St. Rose Normal School to prepare religious sisters to teach in elementary schools. College courses were later introduced in 1923 as Viterbo began laying the foundation to evolve into a four-year degree-granting institution. About 10 years later, Viterbo developed a four-year college program, and by the 1931-32 school year became known as St. Rose Junior College with authorization from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. By 1939, Viterbo received approval as a four-year degree-granting institution for the preparation of teachers for elementary schools Around this time, the school was renamed Viterbo College, reflecting its evolving and expanding educational offerings. In 1940, Viterbo College held its first commencement exercises with certification from the State Department of Public Instruction.

During the 1950s, Viterbo continued to expand its liberal arts offerings and in 1952 it received accreditation from the University of Wisconsin Committee on College Accreditation, becoming a four-year liberal arts college. Since 1954, Viterbo had been accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. Today it is fully accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, among many other commissions and groups.

On September 4, 2000, the college was renamed Viterbo University to reflect its growth into a comprehensive university with robust graduate and undergraduate offerings, including outreach programs. In 2013, the university&#x27;s first doctoral program was introduced, in nursing practice.

==Campus==


Viterbo&#x27;s campus is on 21 acres of land in the Midtown district of La Crosse, Wisconsin, minutes from the city&#x27;s downtown. The urban, 18-building campus is landlocked within the city&#x27;s Washburn neighborhood. Viterbo also has a satellite campus in Des Moines, Iowa.

Centered around the historic St. Rose of Viterbo Convent, originally built in 1871 and rebuilt in 1923 after a fire, Viterbo&#x27;s campus is compact. The first building to bear the Viterbo name hosted its first classes in January 1942. In 1972, the building was named Murphy Center in honor of W. Leo Murphy, a longtime Viterbo supporter and the first chair of the Board of Advisors.

In 1971, Viterbo&#x27;s Fine Arts Center was completed. In 1987, the Varsity Athletic Center was built. In 2004, the D.B. and Marge Reinhart Center for Ethics, Science, and Technology was completed, and in 2005 the Amie L. Mathy Center expansion to the 1987 athletics building was completed. The Mathy Center is a collaboration between Viterbo and the local Boys and Girls Clubs of La Crosse—the first such effort in the country. A remodeling of the Todd Wehr Memorial Library within the main academic building, Murphy Center, was completed in 2006, and the school bookstore was remodeled in the summer of 2006. Between 2009 and 2011, the Student Union was remodeled at the expense of the Student Government Association, in collaboration with the Residence Hall Council. The remodel included upgrades to the security desk, flooring, computer area, television, and furniture.

The School of Nursing Building, which opened in 2011, has simulation labs dedicated to critical care, medical/surgical, maternal newborn care, child health care, nutrition and dietetics. Since 2013, Viterbo has shared space at the Weber Center for the Performing Arts, a 30,000-square-foot facility in downtown La Crosse, and the newest university facility.

<doc id="1206398" wikidata="Q959639" url="?curid=1206398" title="Jay Jay the Jet Plane">
<text>Jay Jay the Jet Plane is an American live-action/CGI-animated musical children&#x27;s television series created by David and Deborah Michel and first aired on TLC and later moved to PBS Kids, with reruns on Qubo and TBN&#x27;s Smile, which were both shut down. The series aired for a total of 4 seasons and has 62 episodes.

==Premise==
The series is centered on a group of anthropomorphic aircraft that live in the city of Tarrytown, taking place at the Tarrytown Airport. The episodes were commonly distributed in 25-minute-long (without commercials) pairs, with one header sequence and one end credit for each pair. Each episode contains one or more songs.

The series was intended to be educational to teach moral and life lessons to young-aged children.

==Music==
The theme song and all of the other songs were written by the famous children&#x27;s singer/songwriter Stephen Michael Schwartz and sung by his popular musical group, Parachute Express. The end credits music during the original airings of seasons 1-3 was a reprise of &quot;Gee, How I Love to Fly&quot;, which was changed to a new instrumental tune for repeats from late 2001 onwards.

==History==
===Original series===
====Early episodes using physical models (as &quot;Pilot Series&quot;)====
In late 1994, a short live-action series was produced at AMS Production Company in Dallas, Texas, with real model plane characters and handcrafted human characters; they had the same personalities as in the later series. This original series was narrated similarly to the first twelve seasons of the original &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;, or &quot;Theodore Tugboat&quot;. Three videos were released: &quot;Jay Jay&#x27;s First Flight&quot; in December 1994, &quot;Old Oscar Leads the Parade&quot; in February 1995, and &quot;Tracy&#x27;s Handy Hideout&quot; in early October of that same year. This original series was narrated by and features the voices of John William Galt. These three were known as the &quot;pilot series&quot;.

====CGI and live-action-based episodes====
On November 2, 1998, the CGI-animated/live-action series premiered on TLC as part of the &quot;Ready Set Learn!&quot; block. Voice actress Mary Kay Bergman provided the original voice of Jay Jay, Savannah, and Revvin&#x27; Evan. After her death, Debi Derryberry and Donna Cherry replaced her.

In 2005, new episodes were produced featuring additional characters, including the red Latina monoplane Lina. Each episode begins with a &quot;Jay Jay&#x27;s Mysteries&quot; segment in which Jay Jay and Lina explore things that might be mysteries to the intended age group, such as how planes fly, and how the five senses are used. The &quot;Mysteries&quot; segment is followed by a story that comes from the third season episodes of the series, so in effect, the new season&#x27;s repackages previously broadcast content on two subchannel networks Qubo and Smile, which were both shut down (as mentioned above).

===Revival===

A new revival of the series, titled &quot;The New Adventures of Jay Jay the Jet Plane&quot; (originally titled &quot;The New World of Jay Jay the Jet Plane&quot;) has been confirmed through Trilogy Animation Group&#x27;s website. The first trailer for the show was released in July 2022. Until the day of launching, it is still currently in development and in production. The characters&#x27; were fully redesigned, and made to look more cartoony, newer, and like the original series, it will be CGI-animated.

==Episodes==

==Characters==
In the CGI-animated/live-action television series, the planes and ground vehicles are CGI characters, while the humans are live-action actors.

Relationship words for the airplane characters refer to being in loco parentis for purposes of upbringing, and education, not to biological parenthood. The story says that (some of) the airplane characters were made in factories.

Some of the stories describe characters as doing actions off-screen that would need foldaway arms (e.g. Big Jake digging holes); however, those arms are never seen on-screen.

===Young planes===
* Jay Jay (voiced by Mary Kay Bergman in the first to second seasons, Debi Derryberry in the third season, and Donna Cherry in &quot;Jay Jay&#x27;s Mysteries&quot;) is a small brown, now blue 6-year-old jet plane and the titular main protagonist of the series.
* Tracy (voiced by Gina Ribisi in the first to second seasons and Sandy Fox in the third season and &quot;Jay Jay&#x27;s Mysteries&quot;) is a small purple, later pink 6-year-old Trinidadian jet plane who is Jay Jay&#x27;s twin sister and best friend. She has normal hearing, but understands American Sign Language pretty well.
* Snuffy (voiced by Gina Ribisi in the first to second seasons and Sandy Fox in the third season, and &quot;Jay Jay&#x27;s Mysteries&quot;) is a small lime green propeller-driven 4-year-old monoplane who is good friends with Jay Jay and Tracy. He is equipped for skywriting. In episode consistency, one episode says that he has not flown further away from Tarrytown than Lightning Bug Lake, but other episodes show him flying much further. In &quot;Grumpy O&#x27;Malley&quot;, Snuffy has still not gotten rid of his initial shyness, but in many other episodes, he no longer shows any sign of shyness.
* Herky (voiced by Mary Kay Bergman in the first to second seasons, Debi Derryberry in the third season, and Donna Cherry in &quot;Jay Jay&#x27;s Mysteries&quot;) is a small fluent Mexican yellow 5-year-old Italian-accented, later German-accented helicopter. In the pilot series, he spoke with a stutter, while in the CGI series, he rolls his &quot;R&quot;s whenever he speaks, and often pronounces stressed &quot;er&quot; as long vocalic &quot;r&quot; (), e.g. &quot;I&#x27;m Herky&quot; as , with a strong high-rising pitch accent on the last &quot;-y&quot;. Herky has skids, and is the only member of the group to be shown as incapable of taxiing on the ground.
* Lina (voiced by Ashley Whittaker) is a red propeller-driven monoplane who is Jay Jay&#x27;s Spanish-speaking Latina friend and Old Oscar&#x27;s niece from Mexico. She serves as the supporting character of the &quot;Jay Jay&#x27;s Mysteries&quot; segments and is exclusively in CGI.
* Ricky Rescue (voiced by Josh Keaton) is a yellow and red helicopter who appears in the upcoming revival and acts as an older brother figure. He is Herky&#x27;s twin brother.

===Adult planes===
* Big Jake (voiced by Chuck Morgan in the first to second seasons and Michael Donovan in the third season) is a dark gray propeller-driven transport plane who acts as a fatherly role model to the young planes. He is the biggest, strongest and second-oldest plane in the fleet.
* Savannah (voiced by Mary Kay Bergman in the first to second seasons and Debi Derryberry in the third season) is a silver Southern-accented supersonic jet who acts as a motherly role model to the young planes. She was made at Savannah, Georgia, hence her name. 
* Old Oscar (voiced by Chuck Morgan in the first to second seasons and Michael Donovan in the third season, and &quot;Jay Jay&#x27;s Mystreries&quot;) is an old gray, later emerald biplane who acts as a grandfather figure. He is the oldest plane in the fleet.
* Montana (voiced by Donna Cherry) is a purple propeller-driven safari plane who is exclusively in CGI.

===Ground vehicles===
Both of these ground vehicle characters are exclusively in CGI.
* Revvin&#x27; Evan (voiced by Mary Kay Bergman in the first to second seasons, Debi Derryberry in the third season, and Donna Cherry in &quot;Jay Jay&#x27;s Mysteries&quot;) is a red 6-7-year-old fire engine and is the cousin of Tuffy.
* Tuffy (voiced by Sandy Fox) is the cousin of Revvin&#x27; Evan who is a confidential blue and orange tow truck. She has a speech impediment.

===Humans===
* Brenda Blue (played by Eve Whittle in the US version and Vanessa Stacey in the UK version) is a woman in blue clothing and usually wears either a red or a blue cap, as well as a pair of red high top Converse. She is in charge of the airport and is the airplane mechanic. She does not use the airport&#x27;s control tower but communicates with the planes by a portable two-way radio from the ground.
* Miss Lee is a deaf and silent librarian at Tarrytown Library who knows American Sign Language.
* E.Z. O&#x27;Malley (played by Brian Nahas) is the founder of E.Z. Airlines, and his cousins are Grumpy O&#x27;Malley, Pierre O&#x27;Malley, and Tex O&#x27;Malley. (Note: here the letter &#x27;Z&#x27; is pronounced &#x27;zee&#x27;, not &#x27;zed&#x27;.)
* Mrs. Blue is Brenda Blue&#x27;s mother, who sometimes visits Tarrytown Airport.

==Broadcast and home media==
&quot;Jay Jay the Jet Plane&quot; premiered on The Learning Channel as part of the Ready Set Learn block. Later, it aired on PBS Kids beginning June 11, 2001, with reruns until May 31, 2009. It aired on PBS Kids Sprout (now Universal Kids) from September 26, 2005 until September 2, 2008.

In 2012 until 2014, it aired in Spanish on Telemundo as part of &quot;MiTelemundo&quot;. In 2021, it also aired on Qubo for a short time until Scripps&#x27; closure and is currently airing on Smile until its closure on January 12, 2025. Outside of the series&#x27; home country, It aired on Channel 5, Discovery Kids, Tiny Pop and S4C&#x27;s Cyw block in the UK, Canal+ and Piwi in France, Discovery Kids in Latin America, TV Cultura in Brazil and Nickelodeon in the Middle East.

In the early-mid 2000s, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (formerly Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment) released the series on both VHS and DVD. Later, it released two of &quot;Jay Jay&#x27;s Mysteries&quot; episodes by Paramount in 2007 as part of PBS Kids&#x27; DVDs.

Religious-based Tommy Nelson also released the series with a new dub on both VHS and DVD.

In 2019, Yippee TV became the exclusive streaming service of &quot;Jay Jay the Jet Plane&quot;.

==Reception==
Common Sense Media gave the series a four out of five stars, saying, &quot;Parents need to know that this series offers young fans life lessons such as valuing friends, overcoming shyness, and learning to like yourself. Kids will enjoy the often funny antics of 6-year-old Jay Jay and his friends. Don&#x27;t be surprised if you catch your preschooler singing along with the show&#x27;s simple songs.&quot;

Retrospective viewers have noted that the character designs for the show often fall into the uncanny valley, and the show is often the subject of ironic memes.

== Cast ==
== Production ==
In late 2000, producer Ravichandran signed on Saran to make a film titled &quot;J!J!&quot; with Vijay in dual lead roles as the characters Jaishankar and Jesudas. The team were also ready to approach Aishwarya Rai to play the lead role, before the venture was shelved and the producer and director moved on to make a different film with the same title. R. Madhavan was signed on and the film was later titled &quot;Jay Jay&quot;, after the two lead characters Jagan and Jamuna. The film was said to feature Mandira Bedi in the lead role, though she was later left out due to unknown reasons. Then Saran wanted to cast Simran for the role as they worked together before. But her unavailability led him to find another actress for the cast. Priyanka Kothari made her debut in the film under the stage name of Amogha, while the film also marked the debut of another heroine, Pooja, who had already signed up to feature in Jeeva&#x27;s &quot;Ullam Ketkumae&quot; at the time. &quot;Thappu Thaalangal&quot; Sundar Raj, a popular Kannada actor, returned to the Tamil screen after a gap of 15 years, while Ceylon Manohar also too returned to acting after 23 years and played the main villain. Malavika Avinash of &quot;Anni&quot; fame and Giri from the &quot;Sahana&quot; serial also made their entry into the big screen, with Giri playing the role of Madhavan&#x27;s friend. Bengali actress Sharmila Ghosh was also in the cast. Reemma Sen, shot at the Visakhapatnam Railway Station with 40 models from Mumbai for a song in the film. Two further songs were picturised in Greece, with the team conducting shoots in the island of Milos and at Santornini. A week&#x27;s shoot was also held at the Institute for the Dumb and Deaf at Ramavaram, while multiple locations in Kolkata were chosen to depict a sequence in the city.

== Release and reception ==
The film was originally slated to release on Deepavali but its release was postponed due to the presence of other releases on same day. The film&#x27;s plans to release on 7 November also failed and it eventually released on 14 November. The film opened to mixed reviews, with Malathi Rangarajan from The Hindu noting &quot;Saran seems to have been carried away by the protracted route of the 100-rupee note and the hide and seek game between the lovers that he lets his screenplay go haywire&quot;. Karthiga Rukmanykanthan of &quot;Daily News&quot; noted, &quot;The movie also reminds of &quot;Kadhal Kottai&quot; at many instances but &quot;Jay Jay&quot; has not made itself as poignant as this movie. The costumes and the music are the only consolation for the producer of this boring and fruitless movie&quot;. A critic from &quot;Deccan Herald&quot; wrote that &quot;Music, songs and Madhavan’s performance are the highlights of the movie&quot;. Visual Dasan of &quot;Kalki&quot; wrote hats off to director for creating fantasy characters, but with real emotions that stick to the mind without any pretense. &quot;Chennai Online&quot; wrote &quot;Charan has done a fairly good job on re-working &#x27;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&#x27;, turning it into a fairly enjoyable &#x27;Parthen Rasithen&#x27;. This time the director has had to work on &#x27;Serendipity&#x27; and &#x27;Training Day&#x27; too (for the Pooja-Madhavan track). And blending these two films of different genres into one film is indeed a tough task! What keeps the film going are Madhavan&#x27;s lively performance and the numerous twists and turns that prevent the hero and heroine from meeting and uniting&quot;. &quot;Indiainfo&quot; wrote &quot;Madhavan has delivered another disappointing fare. JJ or JAY is rehashed from Hollywood hit SERENDIPITY. But the original had its moments and believable characters. This film lacks those essentially. One can’t understand why the talented Madhavan has been selecting films that don’t suit to his image&quot;.

Despite the mixed reviews, the film ran for seventy five days across Chennai. The film was later dubbed and released under the same name in Telugu by producers Seetharam Reddy and Hema Babu.

== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack was composed by Bharadwaj, with lyrics by Vairamuthu. The audio was launched on 2 October 2003 at Sathyam Cinemas with K. Balachander and Kamal Haasan gracing the event. The songs &quot;Unnai Naan&quot; and &quot;Kadhal Mazhaiye&quot; became popular. The song &quot;May Maasam&quot; was the first venture of Suchitra as a playback singer.

<text>Melrose is a mostly residential neighborhood in the southwestern section of the New York City borough of the Bronx. It adjoins the business and one-time theater area known as The Hub. Melrose is rectangular-shaped, being bordered by Saint Anns Avenue on the east, 149th Street on the south, Park Avenue on the west, and 163rd Street to the north. Melrose Avenue and Third Avenue are the primary thoroughfares through Melrose.

The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community Board 1, and its ZIP Codes include 10451, 10455, and 10456. The area is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 40th Precinct. New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) property in the area is patrolled by P.S.A. 7 at 737 Melrose Avenue.

Predominantly German American in the 19th century it was home to Haffen Brewing Company. The German population waned especially post-World War II. The neighborhood until the 1960s was mostly Irish and Italian. It is now primarily Latino.

Grupo TACA operates a Bronx-area TACA Satellite at 570 Melrose Avenue. Melrose is considered part of the socioeconomic South Bronx.

==History==

Melrose was a village in the town of Morrisania, in the county of Westchester before being incorporated into New York City in 1874 as part of the Twenty-Third Ward. Originally a dense working-class neighborhood, the housing that was often hastily built to capitalize on the turn of the 20th century immigrant escape from Manhattan soon became unsuitable to all but the poorest. A mass exodus soon took place as New York City policy–induced arson soon ravaged the neighborhood throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In 1973, the City of New York dismantled the Third Avenue El (an original draw to the neighborhood) due to low ridership. By the 1980s the neighborhood had decayed severely, and much of the original housing stock was lost. Vacant buildings and then lots became commonplace.

Since the mid-1990s, but especially in the 2000s, significant renewal has taken place. A prominent player in the revitalization efforts has been the group Nos Quedamos which in English means &quot;we stay&quot;. Many abandoned structures have been renovated and many lots have been constructed on. In most recent years the area has seen a significant &quot;Green&quot; construction boom. Leading the borough in the number of LEED certified apartment buildings, the largest being Via Verde, winner of the 2013 Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence silver medal. Melrose is also home to The Bronx campus of Boricua College. Despite lingering social problems due to a continued significant poverty presence, Melrose has come a long way from a previously &quot;forgotten&quot; neighborhood.
Four historic Melrose churches date to before 1900. The German Methodist Church (1878) 790 Elton Ave., The German Reformed Church (1885) (seen in the distance with white steeple picture above) 744 Elton Ave., Immaculate Conception Church (1887) 389 E. 150th St. and the German Lutheran Church (1895) 376 E. 156th St.

The Melrose neighborhood has grown since Jimmy Carter&#x27;s famous visit to the Bronx in 1977 and will continue to do so as the city&#x27;s last parcels are sold for development. Many parcels are still in the development phase but will skyrocket the Melrose population.

In 2012, residents expressed concern regarding the Melrose Metro-North station in the neighborhood. Residents would like to see more frequent service, but track and capacity limitations hinder the amount of service available for the stop. Other concerns regarded the lack of handicap access, and the past closure of the main entrance to the stop. The main entrance was closed when the community was at the height of its turmoil, but as the community has regained its footing the desire to have the station open to the primary commercial street, East 161st Street, has grown.

<text>Dohna is a town in the Sächsische Schweiz-Osterzgebirge district, Saxony, Germany. It is located south of Heidenau, in the Müglitz valley and lies at the northeastern foot of the Eastern Ore Mountains. It is accessed by the Pirna interchange of highway A17, and by the &quot;Dohna (Sachs)&quot; and &quot;Köttewitz&quot; stations of the Müglitz Valley Railway.

==History==

Dohna is one of the oldest towns in Saxony. Traces of settlement dating back to the 16th century BC (Bronze Age) have been found. The Dohna Castle on a strategic hill at the entrance to the Müglitz valley was probably already built in the middle of the 10th century. The town Dohna was first documented as &quot;Donin&quot; in 1040. The name comes from &quot;Property of Doň&quot; from the Bohemian first name Zdoň.

The town and its castle controlled two roads from Saxony to Bohemia: one through the Müglitz valley, and one over the heights to Kulm. The burgraves of Dohna controlled a large territory between the Margraviate of Meissen and the Kingdom of Bohemia, stretching from Rabenau in the west to Gottleuba in the east. The burgraves of Dohna were defeated in 1402 in the Dohna Feud, and the town was given to vassals of the Wettin Margrave of Meissen. After 1460, when the seat of administration moved to Sonnenstein Castle in Pirna, the castle fell into ruins.

In 1587 Fabien I, Burgrave of Dohna, was involved in the French Wars of Religion - commanding Protestant mercenaries which were funded by Elizabeth I of England and the King of Denmark and confronting the Catholic forces of King Henry III of France at the Battle of Vimory.

The city of Dohna was devastated by French and Russian troops during the Napoleonic Wars (1813).

The primary and secondary school was opened in 1891. It was named after Marie Curie in 1969. In 1994, Köttewitz and Krebs joined Dohna. In 1999, Meusegast and Röhrsdorf joined Dohna. In January 2000, Dohna became the seat of &quot;Verwaltungsgemeinschaft&quot; &quot;Dohna-Müglitztal&quot;, which also includes the municipality Müglitztal.

<doc id="1206433" wikidata="Q909763" url="?curid=1206433" title="Niwa Nagashige">
<text>was a Japanese &quot;daimyō&quot; who served the Oda clan. Nagashige was the eldest son of Niwa Nagahide and married the 5th daughter of Oda Nobunaga. He took part in his first campaign in 1583, assisting his father in the Battle of Shizugatake against Shibata Katsuie. In 1584, the Battle of Nagakute, at the age of thirteen, Nagashige led a troop of the Niwa clan in place of his father, who was ill.

In 1585, upon Nagahide&#x27;s death, Nagashige received his father&#x27;s fief of 1,230,000 &quot;koku&quot; (spanning Echizen, Wakasa, and parts of Kaga).

During the Siege of Toyama against the forces of Sassa Narimasa, Hideyoshi accused the Niwa clan with collaboration, and seized most of their territories, leaving the clan with only Wakasa Province at 150,000 koku. This is believed to have been Hideyoshi&#x27;s effort to reduce the Niwa clan&#x27;s strength.

During the subsequent Kyūshū Campaign in 1589, one of the Niwa clan retainers was again accused of collaboration with the enemy, and the clan was reduced further to a small 40,000 koku holding around Komatsu in Kaga Province. However, Toyotomi Hideyoshi was mercurial in his moods, and in response to Nagashige&#x27;s efforts at the Siege of Odawara, his status was brought back to 120,000 koku.

In 1600, at the Battle of Sekigahara, Nagashige took part in Ishida Mitsunari&#x27;s force and fought against Maeda Toshinaga of Kaga at Battle of Asai; he consequently had his holdings briefly confiscated. His daimyo status was restored in 1603, when the Tokugawa family granted him 10,000 &quot;koku&quot; at Futsuto, in Hitachi Province.

At the siege of Osaka from 1614 to 1615, Nagashige fought on Tokugawa Ieyasu&#x27;s side. For his service in battle, he had his stipend increased; his fief was transferred to the Edosaki Domain (20,000 &quot;koku&quot;). Nagashige was promoted again in 1622 with a move to the Tanagura Domain and a stipend increase to 50,000 &quot;koku&quot;. His rise culminated in 1627, when he was granted the Shirakawa Domain (worth 100,700 &quot;koku&quot;) and built Shirakawa Castle.

Nagashige&#x27;s successor was his son, Niwa Mitsushige.

==Corporate governance==

As a non-share capital corporation, Nav Canada has no shareholders. The company is governed by a 15-member board of directors representing the four stakeholder groups that founded Nav Canada. The four stakeholders elect 10 members as follows:

These 10 directors then elect four independent directors, with no ties to the stakeholder groups. Those 14 directors then appoint the president and chief executive officer who becomes the 15th board member.

This structure ensures that the interests of individual stakeholders do not predominate and no member group could exert undue influence over the remainder of the board. To further ensure that the interests of Nav Canada are served, these board
members cannot be active employees or members of airlines, unions, or government.

==History==

The company began operations on November 1, 1996, when the government sold and moved the country&#x27;s air navigation services from Transport Canada to the new not-for-profit private entity for CAD$1.5 billion.

The company was formed in response to a number of issues with Transport Canada&#x27;s (TC) operation of air traffic control and air navigation facilities. While TC&#x27;s safety record and operational staff were rated highly, its infrastructure was old and in need of serious updating at a time of government restraint. This resulted in system delays for airlines and costs that were exceeding the airline ticket tax, a directed tax that was supposed to fund the system. The climate of government wage freezes resulted in staff shortages of air traffic controllers that were hard to address within a government department. Having TC as the service provider, the regulator and inspector was a conflict of interest. Pressure from the airlines on the government mounted for a solution to the problem that was hurting the air industry&#x27;s bottom line.

A number of solutions were considered, including forming a crown corporation, but rejected in favour of outright privatization, the new company being formed as a non-share-capital not-for-profit, run by a board of directors who were initially appointed and now elected.

The company&#x27;s revenue is predominantly from service fees charged to aircraft operators, which amount to about CAD$1.2B annually. Nav Canada also raises revenues from developing and selling technology and related services to other air navigation service providers around the world. It also has some smaller sources of income, such as conducting maintenance work for other ANS providers and rentals from the Nav Centre in Cornwall, Ontario.
To address the old infrastructure it purchased from the Canadian government, the company has carried out projects such as implementing a wide area multilateration (WAM) system, replacing 95 Instrument Landing System (ILS) installations with new equipment, new control towers in Toronto, Edmonton and Calgary, modernizing the Vancouver Area Control Centre and building a new logistics centre

===Late 2000s recession===
Nav Canada felt the impact of the late-2000s recession in two ways: losses in its investments in third party sponsored asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) and falling revenues due to reduced air traffic levels. In the summer of 2007, the company held $368 million in ABCP, which had become illiquid. On 12 January 2009, final Ontario Superior Court of Justice approval was granted to restructure the third party ABCP notes. The company expects that the non-credit related fair value variances from face value on restructured and non-restructured ABCP (amounting cumulatively to $33 at November 30, 2013) will be recovered by the time the notes mature in fiscal year 2017. By fiscal year end 2013, the company&#x27;s revenues reached $1,231 million, which exceeded its pre-recession level and fiscal year 2014 saw further revenue growth to $1,272 million. During the period 2005-15, the company held service charge rates steady.

===Hudson Bay ADS-B deployment===
In the mid-2000s, the company decided to address the lack of radar coverage in the Canadian north, especially in the area of Hudson Bay where airliners transition from the North Atlantic Tracks system to Canadian Domestic Airspace by deploying a ground-based Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) network. The five station network was operational on 15 January 2009, filling a gap in radar coverage which allowed reduced separation of airline flights by ADS-B tracking over procedural separation. In January 2009, Nav Canada estimated that the ADS-B system would save its customers 18 million litres of fuel per year and reduce and equivalent emissions by per year.

In November 2010, a second set of six ground-based ADS-B transceivers was later deployed along the coast of Labrador and Nunavut, providing an additional . In March 2012 four more stations were added in Greenland, increasing the area covered by .

===Space-based ADS-B===
In 2012, Nav Canada and the satellite communications company Iridium Communications Inc. launched a joint venture that offers air traffic control authorities the ability to track aircraft around the globe in real time.

The joint venture, called Aireon LLC, uses Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) receivers installed as an additional payload on 66 Iridium NEXT second-generation satellites launched between 2017 and 2019.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAV Canada/Iridium join forces for global aircraft tracking&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Nav Canada invested $150 million for a 51% stake in Aireon.

The cross-linked Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites make it possible, for the first time, to track aircraft from pole-to-pole, including oceanic airspace and remote regions, facilitating fuel savings, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, and enhanced safety and efficiency for airspace users. The added surveillance that Aireon will provide will enable air traffic control to significantly reduce the separation standard in oceanic and other unsurveilled airspace from approximately 80 nautical miles (nm) to 15 nm or less. This will allow more aircraft to fly at optimum altitudes and to benefit from the prevailing winds such as the jet stream, further saving fuel and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Aireon CEO Don Thoma estimated that this would result in an average fuel savings of $400 per flight for the three-and-a-half-hour trip across the North Atlantic. The annual fuel cost savings for airlines in the North Atlantic alone would be on the order of $125 million.

In December 2013, ANSPs from three additional countries joined Nav Canada as partners in Aireon. Enav of Italy, the Irish Aviation Authority and Denmark&#x27;s Naviair signed on for a combined investment of $120 million resulting in a new ownership structure for the company with Nav Canada holding 51 per cent, Iridium with 24.5 per cent, Enav at 12.5 per cent and the Irish Aviation Authority and Naviair each holding 6%.

In September 2014, Aireon announced plans to offer ALERT (Aircraft Locating and Emergency Response Tracking), a free supplementary service for emergency tracking of aircraft in trouble. Aireon&#x27;s ADS-B receivers on Iridium&#x27;s satellites will already include ALERT&#x27;s capabilities and the company has decided to make it available free of charge “as a public service.” Aireon ALERT could be activated by any certified air-safety organization to request the last known location and flight path of any aircraft carrying an ADS-B transponder, even if the operator does not subscribe to Aireon.

==Fleet==
Nav Canada operates a small fleet of aircraft. These aircraft are mainly used for flight inspection of navigation equipment and procedures. As of February 2023, Nav Canada had two Bombardier CRJ 200 registered with Transport Canada and operate as ICAO airline designator NVC, and telephony NAV CAN.

Nav Canada previously operated, for the same purposes, two Bombardier Challenger 601-1A and a Bombardier Dash-8 Series 100 inherited from Transport Canada until April 2019.

<text>ChorusOS is a microkernel real-time operating system designed as a message passing computing model. ChorusOS began as the Chorus distributed real-time operating system research project at the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation (INRIA) in 1979. During the 1980s, Chorus was one of two earliest microkernels (the other being Mach) and was developed commercially by startup company Chorus Systèmes SA. Over time, development effort shifted away from distribution aspects to real-time for embedded systems.

In 1997, Sun Microsystems acquired Chorus Systèmes for its microkernel technology, which went toward the new JavaOS. Sun (and henceforth Oracle) no longer supports ChorusOS. The founders of Chorus Systèmes started a new company called Jaluna in August 2002. Jaluna then became VirtualLogix, which was then acquired by Red Bend in September 2010. VirtualLogix designed embedded systems using Linux and ChorusOS (which they named &quot;VirtualLogix C5&quot;). C5 was described by them as a carrier grade operating system, and was actively maintained by them.

The latest source tree of ChorusOS, an evolution of version 5.0, was released as open-source software by Sun and is available at the Sun Download Center.

<text>Colin Anderson McNab (born 3 February 1961) is a Scottish chess player. He is Scotland&#x27;s second player to be awarded the title of Grandmaster (GM), fulfilling its requirements in 1992 just after Paul Motwani. After achieving his three norms, he strained to get his rating up to the required 2500 level, and is possibly unique among Grandmasters in only achieving a published rating of 2500 some six years after being awarded the title. The FIDE regulations in force at the time stated that an &#x27;intermediate&#x27; rating at any stage during an event would suffice, and that ratings between 2498.5 and 2500 would be rounded up, which is indeed what happened in 1992. He is also an International Master of correspondence chess since 1993 and International Master of chess problem solving since 2007.

McNab played for Scotland in eighteen Chess Olympiads between 1980 and 2016, and won the Scottish Chess Championship in 1983, 1991, 1993 and 1995. He was also the Commonwealth champion in 1992. In 2012 and 2013 McNab won the British Problem Solving Championship.

His opening repertoire is noted for its seemingly quiet fianchetto systems, and he has written a book on the fianchetto variation of the King&#x27;s Indian Defence, and co-authored a book about the Pirc Defence with John Nunn. He is renowned as an expert on the endgame and has written a regular column for Scottish Chess magazine for a number of years.

McNab is a doctor of Mathematics, having studied for a DPhil at the University of Oxford under the supervision of Peter Neumann.

<doc id="1206475" wikidata="Q413945" url="?curid=1206475" title="Carborane">
<text>Carboranes (or carbaboranes) are electron-delocalized (non-classically bonded) clusters composed of boron, carbon and hydrogen atoms. Like many of the related boron hydrides, these clusters are polyhedra or fragments of polyhedra. Carboranes are one class of heteroboranes.

In terms of scope, carboranes can have as few as 5 and as many as 14 atoms in the cage framework. The majority have two cage carbon atoms. The corresponding C-alkyl and B-alkyl analogues are also known in a few cases.

==Structure and bonding==
Carboranes and boranes adopt 3-dimensional cage (cluster) geometries in sharp contrast to typical organic compounds. Cages are compatible with sigma—delocalized bonding, whereas hydrocarbons are typically chains or rings.

Like for other electron-delocalized polyhedral clusters, the electronic structure of these cluster compounds can be described by the Wade–Mingos rules. Like the related boron hydrides, these clusters are polyhedra or fragments of polyhedra, and are similarly classified as &quot;closo-&quot;, &quot;nido-&quot;, &quot;arachno-&quot;, &quot;hypho-&quot;, &quot;hypercloso&quot;-, &quot;iso&quot;-, &quot;klado&quot;-, &quot;conjuncto&quot;- and &quot;megalo&quot;-, based on whether they represent a complete (&quot;closo-&quot;) polyhedron or a polyhedron that is missing one (&quot;nido-&quot;), two (&quot;arachno-&quot;), three (&quot;hypho-&quot;), or more vertices. Carboranes are a notable example of heteroboranes.
The essence, these rules emphasize delocalized, multi-centered bonding for B-B, C-C, and B-C interactions.

Structurally, they can be considered to be related to the icosahedral (&quot;I&quot;h)  via formal replacement of two of its fragments with CH.

===Isomers===
Geometrical isomers of carboranes can exist on the basis of the various locations of carbon within the cage. Isomers necessitate the use of the numerical prefixes in a compound&#x27;s name. The &quot;closo&quot;-dicarbadecaborane can exist in three isomers: 1,2-, 1,7-, and 1,12-.

==Preparation==
Carboranes have been prepared by many routes, the most common being addition of alkynyl reagents to boron hydride clusters to form dicarbon carboranes. For this reason, the great majority of carborane have two carbon vertices.

===Monocarba derivatives===
&quot;Mono&quot;carboranes are clusters with cages. The 12-vertex derivative is best studied, but several are known.

Typically they are prepared by the addition of one-carbon reagents to boron hydride clusters. One-carbon reagents include cyanide, isocyanides, and formaldehyde. For example, monocarbadodecaborate () is produced from decaborane and formaldehyde, followed by addition of borane dimethylsulfide.
Monocarboranes are precursors to weakly coordinating anions.

===Dicarba clusters===
Dicarbaboranes can be prepared from boron hydrides using alkynes as the source of the two carbon centers. In addition to the &quot;closo&quot;- series mentioned above, several open-cage dicarbon species are known including &quot;nido&quot;- (isostructural and isoelectronic with ) and &quot;arachno&quot;-.

Syntheses of icosahedral &quot;closo&quot;-dicarbadodecaborane derivatives () employ alkynes as the source and decaborane () to supply the unit.

==Classification by cage size==
The following classification is adapted from Grimes&#x27;s book on carboranes.

===Small, open carboranes===
This family of clusters includes the nido cages . Relatively little work has been devoted to these compounds. Pentaborane[9] reacts with acetylene to give &quot;nido&quot;-1,2-. Upon treatment with sodium hydride, latter forms the salt [1,2-.

===Small, closed carboranes===
This family of clusters includes the closo cages . This family of clusters are also lightly studied owing to synthetic difficulties. Also reflecting synthetic challenges, many of these compounds are best known as their alkyl derivatives. 1,5- is the only known isomer of the five-vertex cage. It is prepared from the reaction of pentaborane(9) with acetylene in two operations beginning with condensation with acetylene followed by pyrolysis (cracking) of the product:
: &quot;nido&quot;-2,3-
: &quot;closo&quot;-2,3-

===Intermediate-sized carboranes===

====Structures====
This family of clusters includes the closo cages and their derivatives.
Isomerism is well established in this family: 
*2,3- and 2,4-
*2,3- and 2,4-
*1,2- and 1,6-
*1,10-, 1,6-, and 1,2-
*1,2 and 1,3-. 

====Syntheses====
Carboranes of intermediate nuclearity are most efficiently generated by degradations from larger clusters. In contrast, smaller carboranes are usually prepared by building-up routes, e.g. from pentaborane + alkyne, etc.
For example ortho-carborane can be degraded to give , which can be manipulated with oxidants, protonation, and thermolysis.
:

Chromate oxidation of 11-vertex clusters results in deboronation, giving . From that species, other clusters result by pyrolysis, sometimes in the presence of diborane: .

In general, isomers having non-adjacent cage carbon atoms are more thermally stable than those with adjacent carbons. Thus, heating tends to induce mutual separation of the carbon atoms in the framework.

===Icosahedral carboranes===

The icosahedral charge-neutral &quot;closo&quot;-carboranes, 1,2-, 1,7-, and 1,12- (informally &quot;ortho&quot;-, &quot;meta&quot;-, and &quot;para&quot;-carborane) are particularly stable and are commercially available. The ortho-carborane forms first upon the reaction of decaborane and acetylene. It converts quantitatively to the meta-carborane upon heating in an inert atmosphere. Producing meta-carborane from ortho-carborane requires 700 °C, proceeding in ca. 25% yield.

 is also well established.

==Reactions==
The metalation of carboranes is illustrated by the reactions of &quot;closo&quot;- with iron carbonyl sources. Two &quot;closo&quot; Fe- and -containing products are obtained, according to these idealized equations:
:

Base-induced degradation of carboranes give anionic &quot;nido&quot; derivatives, which can also be employed as ligands for transition metals, generating metallacarboranes, which are carboranes containing one or more transition metal or main group metal atoms in the cage framework. Most famous are the dicarbollide, complexes with the formula , where M stands for metal.

== Research ==
Dicarbollide complexes have been investigated for many years, but commercial applications are rare. The bis(dicarbollide) has been used as a precipitant for removal of from radiowastes.

The medical applications of carboranes have been explored. C-functionalized carboranes represent a source of boron for boron neutron capture therapy.

The compound is a superacid, forming an isolable salt with protonated benzene cation, (benzenium cation). The formula of that salt is . The superacid protonates fullerene, .

<doc id="1206479" wikidata="Q281911" url="?curid=1206479" title="Hello, Goodbye">
<text>&quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; (sometimes titled &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot;) is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon–McCartney. Backed by John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;, it was issued as a non-album single in November 1967, the group&#x27;s first release since the death of their manager, Brian Epstein. The single was commercially successful around the world, topping charts in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, Canada, Australia and several other countries.

McCartney later said that the lyrics take duality as their theme. The song originated when, in response to a question from Beatles aide Alistair Taylor about songwriting, McCartney sat down at a harmonium and asked Taylor to say the opposite of whatever he said. The completed song includes a musical coda, which was improvised by the Beatles when they were recording the track in October 1967. Unimpressed with the composition, Lennon pushed for &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; to be the single&#x27;s A-side, before reluctantly accepting that &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; was the more commercial-sounding of the two sides. The Beatles produced three promotional films for the song, one of which was shown on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in America. Due to the regulations against lip-syncing on British television, none of the clips were aired there.

&quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; has traditionally received a varied response from music critics. While some reviewers praise the song for its classic pop qualities, others deem it unadventurous by the Beatles&#x27; standards, and inconsequential. The track was included on the expanded US release of the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; soundtrack EP, and later appeared on compilation albums such as &quot;1967–1970&quot; and &quot;1&quot;. McCartney has often performed &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; in concert, beginning with his Driving World Tour in 2002. James Last, Bud Shank, Allen Toussaint, the Cure and the cast of &quot;Glee&quot; are among the acts who have also recorded the song.

==Background==

Although &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; is credited to Lennon–McCartney, the song was written solely by Paul McCartney. The composition came about through an exercise in word association between McCartney and Alistair Taylor, an assistant of the Beatles&#x27; manager, Brian Epstein. It originated during a period when, following the completion of their album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; in April 1967, the Beatles typically embraced randomness and simplicity as part of the creative process.

According to Taylor&#x27;s recollection, he was visiting McCartney at his home in St John&#x27;s Wood, London, and asked the Beatle how he went about writing a song. In response, McCartney took Taylor into the dining room, where they both sat at a harmonium; McCartney then began playing the instrument and asked Taylor to call out the opposite to each word he happened to sing. Author Steve Turner writes of the result: &quot;And so it went – black and white, yes and no, stop and go, hello and goodbye.&quot; Taylor later reflected: &quot;I&#x27;ve no memory at all of the tune ... I wonder whether Paul really made up [the melody to] that song as he went along or whether it was running through his head already.&quot;

Talking in the 1990s to his official biographer, Barry Miles, McCartney said that the lyrics address duality, reflecting his astrological sign of Gemini. He added: &quot;It&#x27;s such a deep theme in the universe, duality – man woman, black white, ebony ivory, high low, right wrong, up down, hello goodbye – that it was a very easy song to write.&quot; McCartney also said that, in &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;, he was promoting &quot;the more positive side of the duality&quot;.

Among Beatles biographers, Ian MacDonald dates the composition to late September 1967, while Bob Spitz says it was written in time for the &quot;Our World&quot; international television broadcast, in June that year. According to Spitz, McCartney suggested &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; as the Beatles&#x27; contribution to &quot;Our World&quot;, an honour that instead went to the John Lennon-composed &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;.

==Composition==
&quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; is in the key of C major and in time. MacDonald describes the musical structure as &quot;characteristically scalar&quot; and founded on &quot;a descending sequence in C&quot;, with &quot;a brief touchdown on A flat as its only surprise&quot;. Musicologist Walter Everett writes that the bassline in the chorus is an inverted form of the descending scale, which is accentuated on the Beatles&#x27; recording by the lead guitar part.

In Everett&#x27;s estimation, much of &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; references previous Lennon–McCartney compositions: over the verses, the parallel thirds in the vocal recall the band&#x27;s unreleased song &quot;Love of the Loved&quot;, among others; melodically, the chorus is similar to the keyboard part on &quot;For No One&quot;; and the complementary vocal parts in the final verse recall &quot;Help!&quot; Everett also suggests that, early in &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;, McCartney appears to be imitating the V–VI chord &quot;ambivalence&quot; of &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;. Everett describes the composition as &quot;derivative McCartney&quot;, for the most part, &quot;freshened up&quot; primarily through the use of phrase lengths that deviate from a standard eight bars.

Consistent with the song title, the lyrics comprise a series of antonyms – such as yes–no, high–low and stop–go. With the narrative perspective alternating between first and second person, the composition also recalls George and Ira Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Call the Whole Thing Off&quot;.

Following the third chorus, at 2:36 on the released recording, the bassline descends chromatically to mark the start of what musicologist Alan Pollack terms the &quot;first outro&quot; and Everett calls a &quot;codetta&quot;. After this false ending, the song returns with a 45-second coda, which MacDonald identifies as a &quot;Maori finale – a mistake for &#x27;Hawaiian&#x27; (&quot;aloha&quot;)&quot;. The coda consists of a repeated musical phrase over a pedal point in C major, accompanied by the vocal refrain &quot;Helaheba-hello-a&quot;.

==Recording==
The Beatles began recording &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in October 1967, towards the end of filming for their &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; television special. The latter was a film project that McCartney had initiated in an effort to focus the group in the wake of Epstein&#x27;s death that August. Under the working title &quot;Hello Hello&quot;, the Beatles taped the basic track for the song on 2 October, with George Martin producing the session and Geoff Emerick and Ken Scott as engineers. Author Richie Unterberger comments that the production and recording was unusually straightforward, relative to the experimentalism that had characterised much of the Beatles&#x27; studio work since completing &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. The line-up on the take selected for overdubs, take 14, was McCartney on piano, Lennon on Hammond organ, George Harrison on maracas, and Ringo Starr on drums.

The band members then added tambourine, conga drum and bongos over the coda. This last section of the song came about while the group were working in the studio. Lennon, who was otherwise highly critical of &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;, approved of the addition, saying: &quot;The best bit was the end, which we all ad-libbed in the studio, where I played the piano. Like one of my favourite bits on &#x27;Ticket to Ride&#x27;, where we just threw something in at the end.&quot; In McCartney&#x27;s recollection, the coda &quot;didn&#x27;t sound quite right&quot; until Emerick increased the reverberation on the tom-tom drums, at which point, &quot;it just came .&quot; Everett cites the &quot;Maori finale&quot; as an example of the Beatles&#x27; pioneering use of codas in their recordings; in this instance, they provided &quot;the cold ending followed by an unrelated coda&quot;, having similarly pioneered the &quot;fade-out–fade-in coda&quot; at the end of &quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;.

The Beatles returned to the song on 19 October, two days after attending a memorial service for Epstein at the New London Synagogue on Abbey Road. At this session, Harrison added his lead guitar parts (treated with Leslie effect), McCartney recorded the lead vocal, and Lennon, McCartney and Harrison supplied backing vocals; handclaps were also overdubbed. With two reduction mixes having been carried out since 2 October, to free up space on the four-track tape for these and later overdubs, the master take was now nominally take 16. This version of the song appeared on the 1996 outtakes compilation &quot;Anthology 2&quot;. In his book &quot;The Unreleased Beatles&quot;, Unterberger writes that take 16 features a more &quot;active&quot; guitar line from Harrison, who answers McCartney&#x27;s vocal phrasing over the opening verse with a series of descending fills. Also present on this version is a short guitar solo, which would be replaced on the official release by what Unterberger terms &quot;some inspired Paul scat-tinged singing&quot;. Unterberger speculates that the removal of these guitar parts may have caused tension between McCartney and Harrison, anticipating the pair&#x27;s disagreements regarding the lead guitarist&#x27;s role on McCartney compositions such as &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and &quot;Two of Us&quot; over 1968–69.

Two violas were added to &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; at Abbey Road on 20 October. These string parts were played by classical musicians Kenneth Essex and Leo Brinbaum, and scored by Martin, who based the arrangement on a melody McCartney supplied on piano. McCartney overdubbed bass guitar on 25 October and, following a trip to Nice in France to film his &quot;Fool on the Hill&quot; segment for &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, added further bass to the track on 2 November. A mono mix of &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; was completed that same day, and the stereo version on 6 November.

==Release==

&quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; was selected as the Beatles&#x27; single for the 1967 Christmas season, their first release since Epstein&#x27;s death. Lennon pushed for his composition &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; to be the A-side instead, but then ceded to McCartney and Martin&#x27;s insistence that &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; was the more commercial of the two tracks. Lennon remained dismissive of the song; he later said: Hello, Goodbye&#x27; beat out &#x27;I Am the Walrus&#x27; ... Can you believe that? I began to submerge.&quot; Everett writes that, had &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; been the A-side, &quot;[it] would probably have encouraged Lennon to lead the Beatles to new heights&quot;, whereas the decision to choose &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; was &quot;one more nail in the Beatles coffin&quot;.

In Britain, Parlophone issued &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; backed by &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; on 24 November 1967, with the catalogue number R 5655. Within a day of its release, the record had sold over 300,000 copies there. It went on to top the national chart compiled by &quot;Record Retailer&quot; (later the UK Singles Chart) for seven weeks, through to 23 January 1968, giving the Beatles their longest run at number 1 on that chart since &quot;She Loves You&quot; in 1963. In the process, the song became the group&#x27;s fourth Christmas number 1 single in five years. For three weeks from 27 December 1967, the band held the top two positions in the UK, with the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; soundtrack EP trailing &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;.

The single was released on 27 November in the United States, as Capitol 2056, and in the issue dated 30 December replaced the Monkees&#x27; &quot;Daydream Believer&quot; at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100, where it remained for three weeks, becoming the band&#x27;s fifteenth American chart-topper. The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on 15 December 1967. It was later listed by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine as the band&#x27;s seventh biggest US chart hit. The single was successful in many other countries, topping charts in Australia, Canada, West Germany, Holland and Norway. It also peaked at number 2 in Ireland, Austria, Belgium and Switzerland.

&quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; was included on the American &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; album, which Capitol Records compiled by adding five non-album singles tracks from 1967 to the six songs issued in most other countries on the double EP. In the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; film, which aired on British television on 26 December 1967, the song&#x27;s coda plays over the end credits. &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; subsequently appeared on Beatles compilation albums such as &quot;1967–1970&quot; and &quot;1&quot;. As part of EMI&#x27;s policy of celebrating the 20th anniversary of each Beatles single, &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; was reissued in the UK in November 1987 and peaked at number 63 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Promotional films==

The band made three promotional clips for &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;. Filmed on 10 November 1967 at the Saville Theatre in London, a theatre leased by Epstein since 1966, the clips were directed by McCartney. The first one shows the Beatles dressed in their &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; uniforms, apart from a brief cut-away where the group are wearing their 1963-era matching collarless suits. In author John Winn&#x27;s description of the three clips, this version shows the Beatles performing the song against a psychedelic backdrop, while over the coda they are joined on the stage by female hula dancers. Starr is seen playing a miniature drum kit and, unusually, Lennon appears without his granny glasses. In the second clip, the Beatles mime to the song dressed in more conventional attire and with the stage backdrop depicting a rural setting. The third version combines footage shot during these two scenes with the band playing the song before what Winn terms a &quot;glittery pastel backdrop&quot;.
In the US, the first promo for &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; was premiered on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on 26 November. Author Mark Hertsgaard describes the film as &quot;a slapdash affair featuring the hula dancers that was salvaged only by some ludicrously spastic dancing by Lennon&quot;. Music critic Robert Christgau was also unimpressed; speculating in the May 1968 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot; on the content of the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; film, which had yet to air in America, Christgau wrote: &quot;But if Paul McCartney&#x27;s work on the film clip of &#x27;Hello Goodbye&#x27; is any indication, we would be wise not to hope for too much.&quot; In his book &quot;Rock, Counterculture and the Avant-Garde&quot;, author Doyle Greene finds it significant that Starr&#x27;s miniature bass drum lacks the familiar Beatles logo, and he interprets the band&#x27;s waving to the viewer while dressed in their 1963 stage attire as the Beatles &quot;waving &#x27;goodbye&#x27; to the mop-top era and &#x27;hello&#x27; to the counterculture&quot;.

In Britain, the Beatles ran foul of the Musicians Union&#x27;s ban on miming on television. With the first clip scheduled to premier on the 23 November edition of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, George Martin mixed a version of the track without violas, since no musician was seen to be playing those instruments; the Beatles then allowed the BBC to film them at work editing &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; on 21 November, in the hope that this new footage would replace any sections that contravened the ban. Instead, &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; aired the song over scenes from the band&#x27;s 1964 film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. For the 7 December edition of the same show, the BBC ran a clip comprising still photographs mixed with some of the editing-suite film – a combination that served as the promo for &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; throughout the remainder of its UK chart run.

The clip included in the 1996 &quot;Beatles Anthology&quot; video release consists of the Beatles&#x27; first Saville Theatre film, until the song&#x27;s coda, which incorporates footage from all three of the original promo films. The first of the original promos was included in the Beatles&#x27; 2015 video compilation &quot;1&quot;, and all three were included in the three-disc versions of the compilation, titled &quot;1+&quot;. The BBC-compiled clip appeared as a bonus feature on the 2012 DVD reissue of &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, under the title &quot;Top of the Pops 1967&quot;. In May 2013, a Vox electric guitar used by Lennon during part of the filming for &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; sold for US$408,000 at an auction in New York.

==Critical reception==
Writing in December 1967, Richard Goldstein of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; &quot;sounds like a B-side&quot; and described it as &quot;interesting but subordinate&quot;. In his single review for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Nick Jones wrote: &quot;Superficially it&#x27;s a very &#x27;ordinary&#x27; Beatles record without cascading sitars, and the involved, weaving hallucinogenic sounds that we&#x27;ve grown to love so much. However, all the Beatles soul and feeling is shining through ...&quot; Derek Johnson of the &quot;NME&quot; welcomed the simplicity of &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;, describing it as &quot;Supremely commercial, and the answer to those who feel The Beatles are going too way out&quot;. &quot;Cash Box&quot;″s reviewer said that the song&#x27;s closing section was &quot;brilliant&quot; and wrote: &quot;Minimum of words, minimum of melody and practically no subject at all, yet the Beatles have a new side that packs a panchromatic rainbow of sound into the narrow limits that Lennon &amp; McCartney have chosen to work with …&quot;

In his book &quot;Revolution in the Head&quot;, Ian MacDonald views the track as &quot;blandly catchy&quot; and comments that its long stay at number 1 in Britain &quot;says more about the sudden decline of the singles chart than the quality of the song itself&quot;. Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; considers that, at this stage in their career, &quot;the Beatles didn&#x27;t need to push – they could have hit #1 with a tape of themselves blowing their noses&quot;, which, he suggests, &quot;would have been catchier&quot; than both &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; and the band&#x27;s next single, &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;. Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham describes &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; as a &quot;harmless, facile word and chord-play that kept the far more challenging &#x27;Walrus&#x27; from being the A-side of the [Beatles&#x27;] first post-Epstein single&quot;. In the opinion of cultural commentator Steven D. Stark, the song has &quot;the catchiest of tunes&quot; but &quot;insipid&quot; lyrics, which, had the Beatles&#x27; two principal songwriters been collaborating in the manner of previous years, Lennon would have insisted that McCartney rework. Peter Doggett labels it &quot;commercial but rather inconsequential ... three minutes of contradictions and meaningless juxtapositions, with a tune that was impossible to forget&quot;.

In a 2005 review of the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; album, Sputnikmusic lauded the song for &quot;encapsulating everything that made the Beatles such a great pop band&quot;, and praised its piano line, Starr&#x27;s drumming, and the coda. Writing for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger names &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; as one of the &quot;huge, glorious, and innovative singles&quot; on &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, while &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Chris Payne rates the track among the band&#x27;s &quot;most perfect pop songs&quot;. Scott Plagenhoef of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; cites it as an example of how McCartney &quot;excelled at selling simplistic lyrics that risk seeming cloying&quot;, although he adds: &quot;the kaleidoscopic, carnival-ride melody and interplay between lead and backing vocals ensure it&#x27;s a much better record than it is a song.&quot;

In the &quot;NME&quot;″s 2015 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot; as selected by other musicians, &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; was chosen by the Cure and ranked 91st. &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; website places the track at number 45 on its list of the &quot;Top 50 Beatles Songs&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranks it last on the magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot; list, with the editor remarking: &quot;McCartney never claimed that the irresistibly bouncy &#x27;Hello, Goodbye&#x27; was his most profound songwriting moment.&quot; In 2006, the track appeared at number 36 in a similar list compiled by &quot;Mojo&quot;, accompanied by commentary from Alan McGee, who described it as &quot;the greatest-ever pop song, bar none&quot;. &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; is ranked 76th by Stephen Spignesi and Michael Lewis in their book &quot;100 Best Beatles Songs&quot;, where the authors call it a &quot;classic&quot; and a &quot;fine, fresh, fun piece of pop&quot;.

==Cover versions and Paul McCartney live performances==
James Last, the Hollyridge Strings, Bud Shank and the Soulful Strings were all among the artists who covered &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; in the year following its release in 1967. Allen Toussaint, with whom McCartney worked briefly on his and Wings&#x27; 1975 album &quot;Venus and Mars&quot;, released a version of the song in 1989. More recent covers include recordings by Dwight Twilley and the band Ash, and a novelty version by &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters credited to &quot;Bugs &amp; Friends&quot;.

The cast of the US television show &quot;Glee&quot; released a recording of &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; as the opening track of their 2010 album &quot;&quot;. This version became a hit when issued as a single. In 2014, the Cure recorded the song with McCartney&#x27;s son James, for inclusion on the multi-artist compilation &quot;The Art of McCartney&quot;. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine described it as &quot;Sufficiently clattery and &#x27;Love Cats&#x27;-ish to escape comparisons with the original&quot;. Evanescence&#x27;s co-founder and lead vocalist Amy Lee included a cover of &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; on her 2016 children&#x27;s album &quot;Dream Too Much&quot;.

McCartney has performed &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; on many of his tours as a solo artist. These include 2002&#x27;s Driving World Tour and 2003&#x27;s Back in the World Tour, when he opened his concerts with the song, and the On the Run Tour in 2011–12. In addition, throughout his 1989–90 world tour, McCartney segued the coda onto the end of &quot;Put It There&quot;. This medley was included on McCartney&#x27;s 1990 triple album &quot;Tripping the Live Fantastic&quot;, while a full live rendition of &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; appeared on &quot;Back in the U.S.&quot; in 2002.

<doc id="1206485" wikidata="Q14679477" url="?curid=1206485" title="Southside (Birmingham)">
<text>The historic Southside community is situated on the hilly and forested slopes of Red Mountain just south of Birmingham, Alabama&#x27;s central business district. The neighborhood includes the landscape from Railroad Park to the crest of Red Mountain, and from Interstate 65 to U.S. Highway 31 (or &quot;Red Mountain Expressway&quot;). It is one of the most densely populated residential neighborhoods in the city and home to the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and its adjacent hospitals, the state&#x27;s second-largest employer. The Birmingham Business Journal anticipated Southside to have the highest income growth of any zip code in the metro area.

==Characteristics==
Southside is one of the most cosmopolitan neighborhoods in Birmingham, and was historically known for its counterculture. Five Points South in particular has long been a popular nightlife and entertainment district. Because of the international draw of UAB, Southside is the most racially and ethnically diverse neighborhood in Birmingham and is also considered one of its main &quot;gayborhoods&quot;, playing host to the city&#x27;s annual gay pride parade each June. With its college town atmosphere, the community has a high percentage of bicycle commuters, and according to walkscore.com, has two of the top three most walkable zip code neighborhoods in the metropolitan area. Southside has several local businesses, and many residents are employed in the medical, research, and banking industries that anchor Birmingham&#x27;s economy, or at one of the law firms located in Five Points South. George Ward Park, Vulcan Trail, Magic City Rotary trail, and Railroad Park afford residents with opportunities for outdoor recreation and scenic views. The Vulcan statue, Birmingham&#x27;s city symbol, crowns the crest of Red Mountain and is visible from most areas of the neighborhood. Other attractions include Good People Brewery, Dreamland Bar-B-Que, the Frank Fleming Storyteller Fountain, the Alys Stephens Center and the Regions Field baseball stadium.

==History==
Much of Southside was established in the 1890s by John Phelan and Robert Jemison Sr. (of the South-Side Land Co. and the Jemison Real Estate &amp; Insurance Co., respectively) as a leafy streetcar suburb for Birmingham&#x27;s middle and upper class residents similar to Atlanta&#x27;s Inman Park neighborhood. The proximity of UAB and the magnet school Ramsay High School stabilized the community during white flight in the late 20th century, and the area continues to maintain some of the lowest crime rates in the city. As one of Birmingham&#x27;s oldest residential neighborhoods, it has recently experienced a revival in demand for housing options with historic character, as well as the construction of new apartments and condominiums. The neighborhood contains seven historic districts subject to design review under the neighborhood association subcommittee; these districts include an eclectic mix of houses built between 1890 and 1920, primarily representing the Prairie, Craftsman, Neoclassical, and Victorian styles, with a few examples of Queen Anne and Colonial Revival. The network of sidewalks, tree-lined streets and rear-access alleys recently served as a conceptual model for the new urbanism community of Mt. Laurel located thirty minutes south by car. Southside residents have organized into three neighborhood associations (Five Points South, Glen Iris, and Southside) which meet monthly. Most residences are within city council district 3, currently served by Councilor Valerie Abbott, though district 5 and 6 are also represented.

<doc id="1206490" wikidata="Q3266681" url="?curid=1206490" title="IKA-Renault Torino">
<text>The IKA Torino, later renamed as Renault Torino, is a mid-sized automobile made by Industrias Kaiser Argentina (IKA) between 1966 and 1981, under an agreement with American Motors Corporation (AMC). The 1966 Torino was IKA&#x27;s first national product. IKA was eventually bought out by Renault in 1975 to form Renault Argentina S.A.

The Torino was built on the same hybrid AMC platform through 1981 in both two-door hardtop and four-door sedan variants. It has been described as &quot;Argentina&#x27;s national car&quot;.

== Background ==
In 1961, IKA (Industrias Kaiser Argentina) was looking for a car that could break into the Argentinian market, a car that could combine American reliability with European elegance. The automaker provided two 1965 Rambler Americans (a coupe hardtop and a sedan) to Pininfarina seeking styling updates. The new design largely maintained the general shape of the original Rambler with a completely new interior and facelifted &quot;European&quot; grille and rear end.

The car was presented on 30 November 1966, at the Autódromo Juan y Oscar Gálvez and was marketed as the quintessential Argentinian car. The Torino proved popular throughout the 1960s and the 1970s. It continued to be produced after IKA was bought out by Renault.

Renault continued the production until the early 1980s. In 1978 the Argentinian automobile market began to slow down considerably and this also coincided with the relaxation of trade restrictions and the introduction of foreign-made cars. The Torino was unable to compete with the newer, cheaper, more reliable foreign models. Production of the Torino line ended in 1982.

A total of 99,792 two and four-door IKA Torinos were built.

All engines were manufactured in Argentina.

== Racing ==
A marketing effort was established by IKA, known as the &quot;Argentine Mission of 1969&quot; with coordination by engineer Oreste Berta and under the leadership of Juan Manuel Fangio because competing in auto racing was viewed as an investment in brand image.

The IKA Torino&#x27;s most notable international success was in the Marathon de la Route race of 1969, with a Torino finishing in fourth place.

The factory modified three cars by reducing their weight from and increasing the engine output to at 5200 rpm to give them a top speed of as well as suspension adjustments using wider tires. The three cars were shipped to Germany and given numbers 1, 2, and 3 due to Fangio&#x27;s renown in Europe as well as a special classification due to the car&#x27;s larger engine displacement.

After the three and a half days of racing, the No. 3 Torino that was driven by Eduardo Copello, Alberto Rodriguez Larreta, and Oscar Mauricio Franco, had covered the most laps of all – 334, but lost the top position because they accumulated various penalties during the race. The IKA Torino became &quot;the pride and joy of Argentine car enthusiasts&quot; when their country&#x27;s team &quot;showed that it could run with the best of Europe on Europe’s toughest circuit.&quot; This became &quot;one of the great feats of Argentine motorsport having managed to gather the support of the entire national industry in a feat that showed the world the potential of this model built entirely in the country.&quot;

The No. 3 car is displayed in the Juan Manuel Fangio Museum located in Balcarce, Buenos Aires Province, the birthplace of Argentina&#x27;s Fangio who dominated the first decade of Formula One racing. When not competing on race tracks, Fangio&#x27;s daily diver was a 1970 IKA Torino 380S four-door sedan. The car was a gift after the 1969 Nürburgring 84-hour race and Fangio drove it until he became president of Mercedes-Benz Argentina in 1974. the car remained in Fangio&#x27;s name until his death in 1995 and then kept within his family until 2013. The car was auctioned with no reserve at the Silverstone NEC Classic Motor Show Sale in Birmingham, England for £28,175, or about $45,000.

The IKA Torino won the Turismo Carretera, a popular touring car racing series in Argentina in 1967 with Eduardo Copello, 1969 with Gastón Perkins, 1970 and 1971 with Rubén Luis di Palma and 2022 with José Manuel Urcera.

The Torino is still being raced, albeit in silhouette form with Jeep Cherokee engines, in the Argentinian Turismo Carretera and other series.

== Legacy ==
By the late 1970s, the Torino was the only non-Renault product manufactured by the French company. It could also be considered the last front-engine, rear-wheel drive Renault, a rarity in itself.

Many Argentines think of the Torino as the national car. Parts are still available and there are fan clubs.

The appeal of the IKA Torino to collectors outside of Argentina is limited because exporting one is difficult due to numerous registration and ownership regulations.

<doc id="1206516" wikidata="Q146641" url="?curid=1206516" title="Zander">
<text>The zander (Sander lucioperca), sander or pikeperch, is a species of ray-finned fish from the family Percidae, which also includes perch, ruffe and darter. It is found in freshwater and brackish habitats in western Eurasia. It is a popular game fish and has been introduced to a variety of localities outside its native range. It is the type species of the genus &quot;Sander&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The zander was first formally described in 1758 as &quot;Perca lucioperca&quot; by Carolus Linnaeus in volume 1 of the tenth edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; and he gave the type locality as &quot;European lakes&quot;. When Lorenz Oken (1779–1851) created the genus &quot;Sander&quot; he made &quot;Perca lucioperca&quot; its type species. The zander is part of the European clade within the genus &quot;Sander&quot; which split from a common ancestor with the North American clade, which the walleye (&quot;S. vitreus&quot;) and the sauger (&quot;S. canadensis&quot;) belong to, around 20.8 million years ago. Within the European clade the Volga pikeperch (&quot;S. volgaensis&quot;) is the most basal taxon and shares features with the North American clade, such as being a broadcast spawner. In contrast in the zander and the estuarine perch (&quot;S. marinus&quot;) the males build nests and the female spawn into these nests and the males then guard the eggs and fry. The lineage leading to the zander is thought to have diverged from the common ancestor with the Volga pikeperch circa 13.8 million years ago while the split from the estuarine perch took place around 9.1 million years ago.

Fossil remains of &quot;S. lucioperca&quot; are known from the Late Miocene and Pliocene of Ukraine. They appear to have coexisted with the extinct pikeperches &quot;Sander svetovidovi&quot; and &quot;Leobergia&quot;.

==Description==
The zander is the largest member of the Percidae and it usually has a long and muscular body which bears some resemblance to a Northern pike (&quot;Esox lucius&quot;), hence the alternative English common name of pikeperch. The upper part of its body is green-brown in colour and this extends onto the sides as dark vertical bars, in a pattern not dissimilar to that of the European perch (&quot;Perca fluviatilis&quot;) while the lower part of the body is creamy-white. Their caudal fin is dark and the pectoral, pelvic and anal fins are paler off-white in colour. The dorsal and caudal fins are marked with rows of black spots on the membranes between the spines and rays, these are largest and most obvious on the first dorsal fin. The juveniles are silvery in colour, becoming darker as they age. They have powerful jaws which are armed with many sharp teeth with two long canines in the front of each jaw. They have large bulbous eyes which are opaque when the fish is living in particularly turbid conditions, an adaptation to low light. There is a single flat spine on the operculum. Like other members of the perch family the zander has a split dorsal fin with the first dorsal fin having 13–20 spines and 18–24 soft rays, while the anal fin has 2–3 rays and 10–14 soft rays. The caudal fin is long and forked.

The zander has a maximum published standard length , although they are more commonly found at around . This species can reach of weight, although typical catches are considerably smaller. The IGFA All-Tackle world record zander was caught in Lago Maggiore, Switzerland in June 2016 weighing . Zander reach an average length of with a maximum length of .
==Distribution==
The zander is very widely distributed across Eurasia, occurring in the drainages of the Caspian, Baltic, Black, Aral, North and Aegean Sea basins. The northern boundary of its distribution is in Finland. It has been introduced to Great Britain, southern Europe, and continental Europe west of the Elbe, Ebro, Tagus and Jucar drainages, as well as to Anatolia, North Africa, Siberia, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan.

In the UK, zander was originally introduced in 1878 by Francis Russell, 9th Duke of Bedford, into lakes on his Woburn Abbey estate and soon after that into the Great Ouse Relief Channel in The Fens. British Waterways included zander among a &quot;dirty dozen&quot; non-native species most likely to harm native wildlife along rivers in Great Britain.

Their success in establishing themselves was owed to a number of factors, one of which is that they are particularly well adapted to life in the slow-flowing, sparsely vegetated, rather murky waters that comprise so many of the British lowland rivers. Zander thrive in water with rather low visibility, unlike pike, which often dominate the predator fish niche in clear water. However, zander need plenty of oxygen and soon disappear from eutrophic areas.

Zander were stocked in Spiritwood Lake, North Dakota in 1989 and have remained ever since. Ecologists believe that if establishment occurs in the Great Lakes they will compete with game fish such as the closely related Walleye or the Yellow perch for food and habitat. Therefore the Government of Ontario is preemptively treating zander as a future invasive species.

In the Netherlands, zander may be found (natively) in many major waterways, including the Waal, Hollands Diep, and other distributaries or estuaries of the Rhine, and are also particularly common in the canals of Amsterdam.

==Habitat and biology==

===Habitat===
Zander inhabit freshwater bodies, especially large rivers and eutrophic lakes. They can tolerate brackish water and will make use of coastal lakes and estuaries. Individuals living in brackish water habitats migrate upriver, as far as for spawning.

===Diet===
Zander are carnivorous and the adults feed on smaller schooling fish. Studies around the Baltic Sea have found them to prey on the European smelt (&quot;Osmerus eperlanus&quot;), ruffe (&quot;Gymnocephalus cernua&quot;), European perch, vendace (&quot;Coregonus albula&quot;) and the common roach (&quot;Rutilus rutilus&quot;), They were also found to be cannibalistic on smaller zanders. They have also been recorded feeding on smolts of sea trout (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot; morph. &quot;trutta&quot;) and Atlantic salmon (&quot;Salmo salar&quot;). In the United Kingdom zander thrive in canals where the water is turbid due to the boat traffic and although their favoured prey in these waters is common roach they have a high impact on the populations of gudgeon (&quot;Gobio gobio&quot;).

===Reproduction===
The zander spawns over gravel in flowing water, the males defend a territory in which they dig shallow depressions in sand or gravel which are roughly across and in depth in sand or gravel. They will also nest among exposed plant roots and the eggs are laid onto these roots. The nests are normally at depths of in turbid water. Spawning takes place in pairs, at night and at daybreak. When they are spawning the female is stationary above the male&#x27;s nest and the male rapidly swims around her, keeping a distance of around from the nesting depression. The male then orients himself perpendicular to the substrate and the pair swim around swiftly, releasing the eggs and sperm. The female departs after releasing her eggs. The male remains at the nest and defends it, fanning the eggs using the pectoral fins. Each female lays all of her eggs at once and only spawns once a year. The larvae are attracted to light and after they leave the nest they feed on zooplankton and small pelagic animals. They normal spawning season is in April and May, although exceptionally they may spawn from late February through to July, and the actual period depends on latitude and altitude. The determining factor is that it needs temperatures to reach before spawning starts.

===Life history===
Zander have a maximum lifespan of 17 year and they are sexually mature at 3–10 years old, with 4 years old being typical.

===Parasites and predators===
A large number of parasites are known to infect the zander&#x27;s skin, eyes and internal organs. Its gastrointestinal tract can host the nematode &quot;Anisakis&quot;, which can be transmitted to humans if the fish is smoked, fried or otherwise cooked at temperatures lower than . The zander is also a vector of the trematode &quot;Bucephalus polymorphus&quot; and may have been responsible for spreading the parasite to some French river systems during the 1960s and 1970s, leading to decreases in populations of native cyprinids.

Recorded predators of the zander include other zanders, as well as European eels (&quot;Anguilla anguilla&quot;), Northern pike, European perch, the wels catfish (&quot;Silurus glanis&quot;) and the Caspian seal (&quot;Phoca caspia&quot;).

==Use by humans==
The zander is considered one of the most valuable food fish native to Europe. It is esteemed for its light, firm but tender meat with few bones and a delicate flavour. Although it is not generally bred for food, its adaptability makes zander fishery quite sustainable. Indeed, in some regions release of young zanders is restricted, as natural stocks already provide a sufficient supply for the market, while boosting the population of this large predator would have an adverse effect on populations of its prey. Zander is especially well suited for fish fillets. It can also be served whole, baked, smoked or cooked. In some culinary circles, zander is appreciated even more highly than salmon. Even the offals can be cooked into consommé.

In 2004, it was revealed that some restaurants in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area of Minnesota were serving imported zander instead of the closely related North American walleye (the state fish, and a popular food in the region). While zander and walleye are almost indistinguishable by taste, the restaurants were selling the European fish under the name &quot;walleye&quot;, which is an illegal practice. An investigation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration followed.

In Ohio, many restaurants were caught using juvenile zander fillets in the 40 to 80 gram range in place of the Lake Erie yellow perch. Shortages of the perch along with skyrocketing prices caused wholesalers and restaurants to use the juvenile zander for popular &quot;pike perch fillets&quot;.
In Finland, as a conservation measure, the law regulates the minimum size of zander considered mature enough to be eaten.

In July 2009, in a rare occurrence, a zander bit bathers swimming in the Swiss part of Lake Maggiore, sending two people to the emergency room; the worst bite inflicted a wound about 10 centimeters long. The 70-cm 8-kg fish was later caught by the local police who cooked it and offered it to the tourists for the trouble it caused.

As the largest member of the perch family, zander is a popular game fish in the United Kingdom. However, it is legally a non-native invasive species; any zander caught by anglers must be destroyed.

=== Aquaculture ===
Increasing demand for zander for human consumption has attracted great attention of fish farmers. Today, elaborated protocols for the reproduction and on-growing of zander are available. Throughout Europe, an increasing number of aquaculture facilities produce zander for stocking or human consumption, mainly in recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Production volume remains low, but is expected to increase. High investment and maintenance costs of RAS require farming of high value species with good market acceptance such as zander.

<text>Baldwin Hills is a neighborhood within the South Los Angeles region of Los Angeles, California.

Often referred to as the &quot;Black Beverly Hills&quot;, Baldwin Hills is home to Kenneth Hahn State Regional Park and to Village Green, a National Historic Landmark.

==History==
===19th century===
Baldwin Hills and surrounding areas were part of Rancho La Cienega o Paso de la Tijera and later owned by the 19th century L.A. pioneer Elias &quot;Lucky&quot; Baldwin. The Sanchez Adobe de Rancho La Cienega o Paso de la Tijera was once the center of the rancho. In the 1920s, an addition was built linking the structures and the building was converted into a larger clubhouse for the Sunset Golf Course.

===1930s===
The 1932 Los Angeles Olympics housed athletes at the Olympic Village in Baldwin Hills. It was the site of the very first Olympic Village ever built, for the 1932 Los Angeles Summer Olympic Games. Built for male athletes only, the village consisted of several hundred buildings, including post and telegraph offices, an amphitheater, a hospital, a fire department, and a bank. Female athletes were housed at the Chapman Park Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard. The Olympic Village was demolished after the Summer Olympic Games.

===1950s===
In 1950, new homes in Baldwin Hills were designed by Paul W. Trousdale &amp; Associates (of Trousdale Estates fame) and advertised as being near the &quot;$30 million Crenshaw-Santa Barbara Shopping Center.
===1960s===
On December 14, 1963, a crack appeared in the Baldwin Hills Dam impounding the Baldwin Hills Reservoir. Within a few hours, water rushing through the crack eroded the earthen dam, gradually widening the crack until the dam failed catastrophically at 3:38 p.m. When the crack was discovered, police with bullhorns urged the evacuation of the area, but six people were killed. Two hundred homes were completely wiped out, and an additional 1500 to 2000 houses and apartment buildings were damaged, and most of Baldwin Vista and the historic Village Green community were flooded. The dam&#x27;s failure was ultimately determined to be the result of subsidence, caused by overexploitation of the Inglewood Oil Field. The dam&#x27;s failure prompted the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power to close and drain other small local reservoirs with similar designs, such as the Silver Lake Reservoir. The Baldwin Hills Dam was not rebuilt—instead, the empty reservoir was demolished, filled with earth, landscaped, and converted to Kenneth Hahn Regional Park.

===1980s===
During the summer of 1985, a brush fire along La Brea Avenue spread up the canyon towards the homes along Don Carlos Drive in Baldwin Hills Estates. Many homes were destroyed despite the efforts of the Los Angeles Fire Department to suppress the flames. The fire killed three people and destroyed 69 homes; the arsonist was never caught.

In 1985, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that Baldwin Hills is &quot;now often called the Black Beverly Hills&quot;.

==Geography==

Baldwin Hills is bounded by La Cienega Boulevard to the west, Crenshaw Boulevard to the east, Stocker Street to the south and Obama Boulevard to the north with Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard forming the northeast dividing line between Baldwin Hills and Crenshaw Manor. It is bordered on the west by Culver City and it shares the eastern border of Crenshaw Boulevard with Leimert Park.

The namesake mountain range is part of the neighborhood.

===Neighborhoods===
Neighborhoods within Baldwin Hills include:
* Baldwin Hills Estates is locally known as &quot;The Dons&quot;, because all but one street begins with the formal title of the city&#x27;s original land holders. The oldest two streets in the neighborhood are Don Luis Drive and Don Mariano Drive. Old maps show those streets with the names Sprague Drive and Maryann Drive. Susan Miller Dorsey High School has called its school mascot &quot;The Dorsey Dons and Donnas&quot; after this neighborhood. The neighborhood is east of La Brea, southwest of Santo Tomas Drive, south of the Jim Gilliam Recreation Center and north of Stocker Street). It is sometimes called &quot;the Black Beverly Hills&quot;. The neighborhood is characterized by hillside houses with swimming pools, and modern condominiums (the latter often jut out from steep hillsides, perched on stilts).
* Baldwin Village - In 1988, Baldwin Village became be a distinct community in the city&#x27;s General Plan, and signs were to be posted to identify the area. It is bounded by La Brea Avenue, Marlton Avenue, Obama Boulevard, Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Santo Thomas Drive. The neighborhood is the most densely populated part of Baldwin Hills, made up of many midcentury apartment complexes. Built before 1973, the area&#x27;s apartments are subject to Los Angeles&#x27; rent stabilization ordinance and have been an important source of affordable housing in the otherwise very expensive Westside. One of the largest single complexes, the 669-unit Baldwin Village Apartments, has been acquired by the Housing Authority and converted into deed-restricted affordable housing.
* Baldwin Vista is bounded by La Cienega Boulevard to the West, La Brea Avenue to the East, Coliseum Street to the North, and Kenneth Hahn Park to the South.
* Village Green, originally named Baldwin Hills Village, is located north of Baldwin Vista. It is a historic Mid-Century modern &quot;garden city&quot; developed by Walter H. Leimert (1877–1970) multi-family residential. It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 2001. The units are now condominiums on very spacious grounds, attracting seniors, young families, and design professionals as residents.

===Climate===
==Parks and recreation==
* Baldwin Hills Scenic Overlook State Park - The entrance to the park is located at 6300 Hetzler Road in Culver City, CA. The park is open daily from 8 a.m. to sunset. The park includes an amphitheater, the Evan Frankel Discovery Center, picnic tables, and walking paths. 
* Kenneth Hahn State Regional Park is located at 4100 South La Cienega Boulevard. It is a 401 acre recreation and sports area.
* Norman O Houston Park: is located at 4800 South La Brea Avenue.
* Jim Gilliam Park &amp; Recreation Center is located at 4000 South La Brea Avenue. It is home to the Jim Gilliam Senior Citizen Center.

==Government==
===Police department===
* Southwest Community Police Station - Law enforcement services in Baldwin Hills are provided by the Southwest Community Police Station.

===Neighborhood council===
* Empowerment Congress West - The neighborhood council for Baldwin Hills is Empowerment Congress West.

===Library===
* Baldwin Hills Branch Library - Operated by Los Angeles Public Library, the branch is located at 2900 La Brea Avenue.

==Education==

Baldwin Hills is served by Los Angeles Unified School District. Baldwin Hills also has a charter school. The schools operating within Baldwin Hills borders are:
* Baldwin Hills Elementary School
* Audubon Middle School
* Susan Miller Dorsey High School
* Windsor Math/Science/Aerospace Magnet
* Hillcrest Drive Elementary School.
* Marlton School
* New Designs Charter School

New LA Elementary School, a charter school, is on the grounds of Baldwin Hills Elementary. A California law called Proposition 39 allows New LA to occupy space on the grounds of Baldwin Hills Elementary. In 2022, area community members advocated for the charter school to move to another location since they believed that it meant there would not be enough space for the public elementary to operate efficiently.

==Media==
===Literature===
* &quot;Magic Street&quot; - Orson Scott Card&#x27;s urban fantasy novel set in Baldwin Hills.

===Television===
* &quot;Baldwin Hills&quot; - A reality show about several African-American teenagers living in Baldwin Hills.

==Notable people==

* Danny Elfman
* Mike Love

<text>A prayer rug or prayer mat is a piece of fabric, sometimes a pile carpet, used by Muslims, some Christians, especially in Orthodox Christianity and some followers of the Baháʼí Faith during prayer.

In Islam, a prayer mat is placed between the ground and the worshipper for cleanliness during the various positions of Islamic prayer. These involve prostration and sitting on the ground. A Muslim must perform (ablution) before prayer, and must pray in a clean place.

Prayer rugs are also used by some Oriental Orthodox Christians for Christian prayer involving prostrations in the name of the Trinity, as well as during the recitation of the Alleluia and Kyrie eleison. Its purpose is to maintain a cleanly space to pray to God and shoes must be removed when using the prayer rug. Among Russian Orthodox Christians, particularly Old Ritualists, a special prayer rug known as the Podruchnik is used to keep one&#x27;s face and hands clean during prostrations, as these parts of the body are used to make the sign of the cross.

Many new prayer mats are manufactured by weavers in a factory. The design of a prayer mat is based on the village it came from and its weaver. These rugs are usually decorated with many beautiful geometric patterns and shapes. They are sometimes even decorated with images. These images are usually important Islamic landmarks, such as the Kaaba, but they are never animate objects. This is because the drawing of animate objects on Islamic prayer mats is forbidden.

For Muslims, when praying, a niche, representing the mihrab of a mosque, at the top of the mat must be pointed to the Islamic center for prayer, Mecca. All Muslims are required to know the qibla or direction towards Mecca from their home or where they are while traveling. Oriental Orthodox Christians position their prayer rugs so that they face east, the direction of prayer towards which they offer prayer.

== History and use==

=== In the Baháʼí Faith ===
In the Baháʼí Faith, prayer rugs or prayer mats are not required, though may sometimes be used as a way to fulfill the instruction written in the Baháʼí mother-book The Most Holy Book mentioning to &quot;prostrate yourselves on any surface that is clean&quot;.

=== In Christianity ===
Prayer rugs are used in some traditions of Oriental Orthodox Christianity and Western Orthodox Christianity, to provide a clean space for believers to offer Christian prayers to God.

During the seven fixed prayer times of Oriental Orthodox Christians, believers incorporate prostrations in the praying of the canonical hours that are performed facing east, with Copts &quot;prostrating three times in the name of the Trinity; at the end of each Psalm[...] while saying the &#x27;Alleluia&#x27;; and multiple times during the more than forty Kyrie eleisons&quot; (cf. &quot;Agpeya&quot;). Indian Orthodox Christians prostrate thrice during the Qauma prayer, at the words &quot;Crucified for us, Have mercy on us!&quot;, thrice during the recitation of the Nicene Creed at the words &quot;And was incarnate of the Holy Spirit...&quot;, &quot;And was crucified for us...&quot;, and &quot;And on the third day rose again...&quot;, as well as thrice during the Prayer of the Cherubim while praying the words &quot;Blessed is the glory of the Lord, from His place forever!&quot; (cf. &quot;Shehimo&quot;). These prayer rugs are often blessed by Christian clergy in the church before ever being used; in this way, when a Christian prays at home, it is as if they are praying in their local church. Additionally, carpets cover the floors of parishes in denominations such as the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church on which Christians prostrate in prayer. Among Russian Orthodox Old Ritualists, a special prayer rug known as the Podruchnik is used to keep one&#x27;s face and hands clean during prostrations, as these parts of the body are used to make the sign of the cross. In the Middle East and South Asia, where Christian missionaries are engaged in evangelism, some converts to Christianity use prayer rugs for prayer and worship in order to preserve their Eastern cultural context. In modern times, among most adherents of Western Christianity, kneelers placed in pews (for corporate worship) or in prie-dieus (for private worship) are customary; historically however, prayer rugs were used by some Christian monks to pray the canonical hours in places such as Syria, Northumbria, and Ireland well before the arrival of Islam.

The Armenian Apostolic Church, an Oriental Orthodox Christian denomination, has a long tradition of prayer rugs with Christian symbols woven in them; these have been found in places as far as Shirvan. One of the oldest is the Saint Hrip&#x27;sime Rug, which was woven in 1202 A.D. and originates in the village of Banants, located in what is now Gandja.

=== In Islam ===
==== Significance ====
While not explicitly mandated in the Quran or &quot;Ḥadīt̲h&quot;, prayer rugs, known in one source as &quot;sad̲j̲d̲j̲āda&quot;, are nonetheless deeply embedded in Islamic practice and material culture. They represent a physical and symbolic delineation of sacred space, allowing the worshiper to create a ritually pure area for prayer. The presence of the &quot;miḥrāb&quot;—a stylized representation of the prayer niche found in mosques—visually orients the individual towards the Kaaba in Mecca, the direction Muslims face during prayer. Prayer rugs, particularly those from the Safavid and Qajar periods, offer a window into broader cultural and intellectual trends in the Islamic world. During the Safavid era, prayer rug designs emphasized explicitly Islamic themes and specifically Shi&#x27;a Islam, with inscriptions reinforcing religious identity. Conversely, Qajar prayer rugs reflect a growing focus on the individual, with patron&#x27;s names, images of kings and heroes, and motifs inspired by contact with the West, signaling a shift in the understanding of the rug&#x27;s purpose and meaning. Ultimately, the prayer rug, while a simple object in form, embodies the connection between the material and the spiritual, the individual and the communal, and historical trends and artistic expression in the Islamic world.

==== Background ====

In Islamic world there are two basic types of prayer rug, one designed with a single and meant for individual worship, the other with multiple niches and intended for a place of public prayer such as a mosque. This second type is known as .

A prayer rug is characterized by a niche at one end, representing the mihrab in every mosque. The &quot;mihrab&quot; represents not just the direction of prayer but also a gateway to the divine or a symbolic connection to the mosque architecture. Many rugs also show one or more mosque lamps, a reference to the Verse of Light in the Qur&#x27;an. Additionally, the use of floral and tree motifs, particularly the tree of life, can be linked to concepts of paradise, eternity, and immortality. Occasionally, prayer rugs depict specific mosques, such as those in Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem, further emphasizing the symbolic connection between the prayer rug and the physical space of the mosque as a place of communal worship. After the advent of Islam, Muslims often depicted the Kaaba in order to distinguish themselves from Christian carpets. Decorations not only play a role in imagery but serve the worshipper as aids to memory. Some of the examples include a comb and pitcher, which is a reminder for Muslims to wash their hands and for men to comb their hair before performing prayer.

Prayer rugs are typically produced in the towns or villages where they are used, reflecting local weaving traditions and cultural aesthetics. The exact pattern will vary greatly by original weavers and the different materials used. Some may have patterns, dyes and materials that are traditional to the region in which they were made. The varied patterns, dyes, and materials used in prayer rugs reflect not only regional aesthetics but also the desire to create a sensory experience that enhances the act of prayer. During prayer, the individual kneels at the base of the rug and performs sud̲j̲ūd, prostrating with their forehead, nose, hands, knees, and toes touching the ground, towards the niche representing the direction of Mecca.

==== Regional Variations of Prayer Rugs ====
Using some type of floor covering for prayer was known early in Islamic history. Though there is evidence that carpets may have been produced in Anatolia before Turkish invasions in the 11th century, no examples survive. The oldest surviving prayer rugs, discovered in mosques in Konya and Beyşehir, are believed to be from the 14th century, and were woven entirely of wool with geometric designs. From the 14th century onward, European paintings increasingly depict Anatolian prayer rugs that were exported to Europe, leading to the use of European painter&#x27;s names to classify prayer rug types.

The design of prayer rug varies in different regions. Turkish prayer rugs are known for their balanced geometric patterns and floral elements. Persian rugs, in contrast, often display a more graceful aesthetic with elegant miḥrābs and realistic floral decorations. The “Tree of Life” is another common motif in Persian rugs, sometimes incorporated within the miḥrāb.

Indian prayer rug traditions highlight the intersection of religious and cultural influences. While pile-woven carpets and prayer rugs gained popularity during the Mughal period, the region also has a long tradition of using darī, flat-woven cotton rugs. The 18th-century cotton prayer rugs from Bīd̲j̲āpūr, with their floral patterns and uniquely Indian domed minarets rising from the miḥrāb, show this cultural fusion.

====Interactive prayer mats====

Interactive prayer mats, also known as smart prayer mats or digital prayer rugs, are a recent development in the field of prayer rugs. These mats are designed to enhance the spiritual experience of Muslims during prayer by incorporating technology into the traditional practice of prayer, and for educational purposes.

===Islamic rugs in Lutheran Churches===
The Saxon Lutheran Churches, parish storerooms and museums of Transylvania safeguard about four hundred Anatolian rugs, dating from the late-15th to early 18th century. They form the richest and best-preserved corpus of prayer-format rugs of Ottoman period outside Turkey.

Transylvania, like the other Romanian principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, never came under direct Turkish occupation. Until 1699 it had the status of an autonomous Principality, maintaining the Christian religion and own administration but paying tribute to the Ottoman Porte. By contrast, following the Battle of Mohacs in 1526, part of Hungary was designated a Pashalik and was under Turkish occupation for over a century and a half.

Rugs came into the ownership of the Reformed Churches, mainly as pious donations from parishioners, benefactors or guilds. In the 16th century, with the coming of the Reformation, the number of figurative images inside the churches was drastically reduced. Frescoes were white-washed or destroyed, and the many sumptuous winged altar-pieces were removed maintaining exclusively the main altar piece. The recently converted parishioners thus perceived the church as a large, cold and empty space, which required at least some decoration. Traces of the mural decoration were found during modern restorations in some Protestant Churches as for instance at Malâncrav.

In this situation the Oriental rugs, created in a world that was spiritually different from Christianity, found their place in the Reformed churches which were to become their main custodians. The removal from the commercial circuit and the fact that they were used to decorate the walls, the pews and the balconies but not on the floor was crucial for their conservation over the years.

After the Siege of Vienna of 1682 the Ottomans suffered several defeats by hand of the Habsburg army. In 1687 the rulers of Transylvania recognized the suzerainty of the Habsburg emperor Leopold I. Generally the end of the Turkish rule in Transylvania is associated with the Peace Treaty of 1699, but in fact this happened more than a decade earlier. The last decades of the 17th century marked a decline of the rug trade between Transylvania and Turkey which affected the carpet production in Anatolia. Shortly after the turn of the century the commercial rugs based on Lotto, Bird or Transylvanian patterns ceased to be woven.

<text>Roy Michael Joseph Dupuis (; born April 21, 1963) is a Canadian actor best known in America for his role as counterterrorism operative Michael Samuelle in the television series &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;. In Canada, specifically Quebec, he&#x27;s known for numerous leading roles he&#x27;s played in film. He portrayed Maurice Richard on television and in film and Roméo Dallaire in the 2007 film &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot;.

==Early life and education==

Dupuis was born in New Liskeard, Ontario to French-Canadian parents. From early infancy until he was 11 years old, Dupuis lived in Amos, Quebec in the Abitibi Regional County Municipality. Over the next three years he lived in Kapuskasing, Ontario, where he learned to speak English. His father was a travelling salesman for Canada Packers; his mother was a piano teacher. He has a younger brother and an older sister. When he was 14, after his parents divorced, his mother moved the family to Sainte-Rose, Laval, where he finished high school. After high school, he studied acting in Montreal, at the National Theatre School of Canada (&quot;L&#x27;École nationale de théâtre du Canada&quot;), from which he graduated in 1986.

==Personal life==
Dupuis lives southeast of Montreal, in an 1840 farmhouse located on of land which he bought in 1996 and which he has restored and renovated. He enjoys sports, particularly hockey, skydiving, and golf. His hobbies include astronomy and physics (his interests in high school). He learned to play the cello as a boy and, at times, still plays, sometimes in dramatic roles. In recent years, between television and film projects, he has been occupied with learning to sail; he owns a couple of sailboats, and he is custom-outfitting the larger aluminum-keeled vessel in preparation for extended ocean voyages.

==Career==
Dupuis is a celebrity in French-speaking areas of Canada and is also well known in anglophone areas due to his English-language and bilingual projects. He has performed in many theater productions, movies, and television series. Among the stage roles that he has performed so far are: Luc in Michel Marc Bouchard&#x27;s &quot;Les Muses orphelines&quot; (&quot;The Orphan Muses&quot;), directed by André Brassard in 1985; Roméo in a Québécois adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (&quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;), directed by Guillermo de Andrea in 1989; and Jay in Jean-Marc Dalpé&#x27;s &quot;Le Chien&quot; (&quot;The Dog&quot;), Adrien in Jeanne-Mance Delisle&#x27;s &quot;Un Oiseau vivant dans la gueule&quot; (&quot;A Live Bird in Its Jaws&quot;), and Lee in a Québécois version of Sam Shepard&#x27;s &quot;True West&quot;, all three productions directed by Brigitte Haentjens, in 1987-89, 1990, and 1994, respectively.

Dupuis gained popularity in Quebec as Ovila Pronovost in the series &quot;Les Filles de Caleb&quot; (also known as &quot;Emilie&quot;) when it premiered on Radio-Canada (1990–91), and he co-starred as the journalist Michel Gagné in four seasons of &quot;Scoop&quot; (1992–95). He was introduced to the American public on television as Oliva Dionne in &quot;Million Dollar Babies&quot; (1994)--&quot;Les jumelles Dionne: La véritable histoire tragique des quintuplées Dionne&quot; (&quot;The Dionne &quot;Twins&quot;: The True Tragic Story of the Dionne Quintuplets&quot;). In the United States, he also debuted on the big screen in such film roles as Becker in &quot;Screamers&quot; (1995) and as John Strauss in &quot;Bleeders&quot; (1996), also known as &quot;Hemoglobin&quot; (1997) in the UK. In 1997 he began appearing as Michael Samuelle in the television series &quot;La Femme Nikita&quot;, also known as &quot;Nikita&quot;. Recently, he won a MetroStar Award for his role as Ross Desbiens in &quot;Le Dernier Chapitre: La Vengeance&quot; (2003), the sequel to &quot;Le Dernier Chapitre&quot; (2002), both filmed simultaneously in dual-language versions broadcast in French and English on Radio-Canada and the CBC, respectively.

Dupuis&#x27;s first appearance on film was in a 1987 short experimental work inspired by the 1926 avant-garde film &quot;Anémique Cinéma&quot;, by Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray, featuring the same title.

Among Dupuis&#x27; film performances are Yves, in &quot;Being at Home with Claude&quot; (1991; Cannes, Un Certain Regard 1992)--his first major screen role—directed by Jean Beaudin, adapted from a screenplay by Johanne Boisvert, based on the 1986 stage play by René-Daniel Dubois; and Kevin Barlow, in &quot;Manners of Dying&quot; (2004), the first feature film directed by Jeremy Peter Allen, adapted from his own screenplay based on the short story first published in the 1993 collection &quot;The Facts Behind the Helsinki Roccamatios and Other Stories&quot; by Yann Martel. His performance as Alexandre Tourneur in &quot;Looking for Alexander (Mémoires affectives)&quot; (2004), directed by Francis Leclerc, who co-wrote the screenplay with Marcel Beaulieu, received awards.

In &quot;The Rocket (Maurice Richard)&quot;, directed by Charles Binamé (&quot;Séraphin: Heart of Stone&quot;) and released in late November 2005, Dupuis stars as French-Canadian ice hockey icon Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard, who played for the Montreal Canadiens from 1942–60, and whom he portrayed previously on Canadian television in 1997 and 1999. Dupuis&#x27; own experience playing hockey and his ability to perform on the ice on authentic period hockey skates were useful for this film, in which several professional hockey players were cast in supporting roles.

The film was nominated for the Jutra Award 2006 in fourteen categories, including Dupuis for Best Actor, but he did not win it. Leading the nominations for a Genie Award in thirteen categories, it won nine of the twenty-two awards on February 13, 2007, at the Carlu Event Theatre in Toronto, including Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for Dupuis.

In December 2005, Dupuis completed filming &quot;That Beautiful Somewhere&quot;, based on the 1992 novel &quot;Loon&quot; by Bill Plumstead, its executive producer. It was set and filmed on location in North Bay, Ontario. The film, directed by Robert Budreau, is produced by Lumanity Productions. Its world premiere was on August 26, 2006, at the Montreal World Film Festival (August 24-September 4, 2006); it was presented at Cinéfest Sudbury International Film Festival (September 16–24, 2006), at the Calgary International Film Festival (September 22-October 1, 2006), and at other film festivals, as well as broadcast on Canadian pay cable television, before it was released commercially in Canada in April 2007.

On location in Kigali, Rwanda, in mid-June 2006, Dupuis began filming the dramatic feature film &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot;, in which he performs the principal role of Lieutenant-General Roméo Dallaire, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) during the Rwandan genocide. The film is based on Dallaire&#x27;s autobiographical book &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil: The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda&quot;. After two months in Kigali, filming continued in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in August 2006. Prior to its release, a &quot;draft of the film&quot; was screened as a courtesy by the producer, Laszlo Barna, to Paul Kagame, the President of Rwanda, and his cabinet, who found it emotionally very moving.

The film was a &quot;special presentation&quot; at the Toronto International Film Festival on 9 September 2007, and opened the 27th Atlantic Film Festival on September 13, 2007. &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot; opened in theaters on September 28, 2007. For his performance as Dallaire, Dupuis won his second Jutra Best Actor award; in accepting it, &quot;Dupuis dedicated his award to his mother, who died recently, as well as to Dallaire and the people of Rwanda.&quot;

In October 2006, along with Gabriel Byrne, Christopher Plummer, Max von Sydow, and Susan Sarandon, he filmed &quot;Emotional Arithmetic&quot;, directed by Paolo Barzman and adapted by Barzman and Jefferson Lewis from the novel by Canadian writer Matt Cohen (1942–1999), who had written several drafts of a screenplay adaptation himself before his death. Dupuis plays Benjamin Winters, the &quot;embittered&quot; son of Melanie Lansing Winters (Sarandon) and her husband, David Winters (Plummer). The film closed the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival on September 15, 2007.

In winter 2007, he participated in the improvisational short film directed by Francis Leclerc, entitled &quot;Revenir&quot; (&quot;Return&quot;), which was filmed and screened during the 11th edition of Festival Regard, a festival of short films, held in Saguenay, Quebec.

Later in 2007 and 2008, Dupuis began working on several new film projects, including: as Charles in &quot;Truffe&quot;, directed by Kim Nguyen, produced by Renée Gosselin and distributed by Christal Films, whose world premiere opens the Fantasia Film Festival in Montreal on July 3, 2008; as Jean-Paul Mercier in &quot;Mesrine: Killer Instinct&quot;; as Mr. Turcotte in &quot;A No-Hit No-Run Summer (Un été sans point ni coup sûr)&quot;, a feature film about baseball set at the beginning of the 1960s adapted from the novel of that title by Marc Robitaille, directed by Francis Leclerc; as Scully in &quot;The Timekeeper (L&#x27;Heure de vérité)&quot;, an English-language feature film directed by Louis Bélanger; as an Irishman named Liam Hennessy in André Forcier&#x27;s &quot;Je me souviens&quot; and as another character named Charles in &quot;Sticky Fingers (Les doigts croches)&quot;, directed by Ken Scott.

On March 18, 2008, after a fourteen year absence, Dupuis returned to the stage for a limited run as Ian in a French translation of &quot;Blasted&quot;, the controversial first play by British playwright Sarah Kane (1971–1999). Jean-Marc Dalpé&#x27;s French version, &quot;Blasté&quot;, directed by Brigitte Haentjens for her company Sybillines Inc., also featured Céline Bonnier and Paul Ahmarani.

<doc id="1206534" wikidata="Q1893231" url="?curid=1206534" title="Steve Ogrizovic">
<text>Steven Ogrizovic (born 12 September 1957) is an English football coach, former professional footballer and cricketer.

As a player, he was a goalkeeper from 1977 until 2000, the last 16 years of which were at Coventry City. Nicknamed &quot;Oggy&quot;, he holds the record at Coventry City for the most appearances as a player (601 in all competitions, 507 in the league) and he played in the winning FA Cup team of 1987. He also played for Chesterfield, Liverpool and Shrewsbury Town. Since retiring he remained with the Sky Blues for the next 20 years in a host of different positions including reserve team manager and goalkeeping coach. In both 2002 and 2004 he had spells as caretaker manager of the first team.

Between 1983 and 1984, Ogrizovic played cricket for Shropshire as a right-arm medium-fast bowler. He completed four games for the club, taking five wickets.

==Playing career==
He started his professional career at Chesterfield before moving to Liverpool. His time at Liverpool was frustrating as he was unable to displace Ray Clemence. He made his debut on 8 March 1978 in a 4–2 defeat at Derby County. He managed a few more team appearances before moving to Shrewsbury Town. In 1984 he joined Coventry for £72,500. He was also selected to play for the Football League vs The Rest of the World at Wembley in 1987.

He was still Coventry&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper in the 1997–98 season, when at the age of 40 he was the oldest player to play a Premier League game that season. In order to gain his final playing contract Ogrizovic had to give up smoking as one of the conditions. He was the club&#x27;s second choice goalkeeper for the next two seasons following the arrival of Magnus Hedman, and finally retired at the end of the 1999–2000 season.

In 16 seasons at Coventry, he collected an FA Cup winner&#x27;s medal, but never played in European competition, as Coventry were unable to compete in the Cup Winner&#x27;s Cup due to the ban on English teams in European competitions following the Heysel disaster, and the highest position Coventry attained in this period was seventh in the 1988–89 First Division. On no fewer than seven occasions in Ogrizovic&#x27;s time at the club, they came close to relegation from the top flight. They were finally relegated from the Premier League one season after his retirement.

During his time at Coventry, Ogrizovic scored in a 2–2 draw at Sheffield Wednesday in the First Division on 25 October 1986. He is also one of four players to have played top-flight football in four different decades, along with Peter Shilton, John Lukic and Sir Stanley Matthews and holds the club record of 209 consecutive League appearances for a Coventry City player, from August 1984 to September 1989. Overall, he made 604 professional league appearances in a playing career spanning 23 years from 1977 to 2000.

His final appearance for Coventry came on 6 May 2000 against Sheffield Wednesday. The keeper had not been first choice for much of that season, alternating the number 1 position with Magnus Hedman, but was awarded the jersey for the club&#x27;s final home game in recognition of his outstanding service to the club.

==International career==
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Ogrizovic was generally considered to be the best goalkeeper never to have won a full England cap. However, he did come on as a second-half substitute for Peter Shilton, in the English Football League XI vs Rest of the World XI in 1987. This match was to start the English football league celebrations, and was hosted at Wembley stadium. Ogrizovic played for 45 minutes. Although frequently considered for selection during this period by a number of England managers including Bobby Robson and Graham Taylor, he was never selected for the full squad. He was once considered to be selected for the Yugoslavian national side (due to his Yugoslavian parentage), in the late eighties, but he declined the offer.

==Coaching career==
Ogrizovic was caretaker manager in conjunction with Trevor Peake at the end of the 2001–02 season, between Roland Nilsson&#x27;s departure and Gary McAllister&#x27;s appointment, and for a couple of days towards the end of the 2003–04 season. During Iain Dowie&#x27;s spell as manager, Ogrizovic was the manager of the Coventry City reserve team, and he continued to hold this role under Chris Coleman. He was Coventry City&#x27;s goalkeeping coach from 2008 to 2019.

==Personal life==
Ogrizovic is the son of Nikola Ogrizović (), a Yugoslav (Serb) prisoner of war in Italy during World War II, who sought refuge in the United Kingdom after being liberated by British troops. Ogrizovic served both as a Police Cadet and as a Police Officer at Mansfield Police Station in Nottinghamshire prior to signing as a professional footballer. In 2003 Ogrizovic was the subject of a hoax that said that he had been kidnapped in Kazakhstan and an online petition was set up to campaign to get him released. This was proved to be false when the &quot;Coventry Evening Telegraph&quot; interviewed him at Coventry City&#x27;s training ground at Ryton-on-Dunsmore.

==Cricket career==

Ogrizovic was also a cricketer, reaching Minor Counties level as a medium-fast bowler. He played three List A matches for Shropshire County Cricket Club in the NatWest Trophy, and a further game for Minor Counties in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup. Amongst the players who he got out at this level were Chris Broad, Martyn Moxon and Alvin Kallicharran, all international cricketers

<text>Fenelon Falls is a village in Ontario, Canada, part of the city of Kawartha Lakes. Nicknamed the &quot;Jewel of the Kawarthas,&quot; it has a population of 2,500 permanent inhabitants, which swells in the summer due to tourism and holiday cottages. Fenelon Falls is home to lock 34 on the Trent-Severn Waterway between Sturgeon Lake and Cameron Lake. It is primarily a tourist town and therefore is most active during the summer season. The main street of Fenelon Falls is called Colborne Street.

The eponymous falls are hidden from plain view, because the main road crosses over the river just upstream; however, the falls are easily viewed from a nearby restaurant or from a path on the north bend of the Fenelon River. The falls power a hydro-electric dam, which diverts some of the water flow.

==History==

Fenelon Falls, originally named &quot;Cameron&#x27;s Falls&quot;, was renamed after the township, which was named after François de Salignac de la Mothe-Fénelon (not to be confused with his more famous half-brother of the same name), who founded a mission on the Bay of Quinté.

The village of Fenelon Falls was incorporated in 1874. In 1876, the Victoria Railway reached Fenelon Falls. This line was taken over by the Midland Railway of Canada circa 1880, then absorbed into the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR) in 1893. In 1885, construction of the lock between Cameron and Sturgeon lake began. In 1923, CN took over the former GTR, operating the line until the burning of McLaren&#x27;s Creek bridge near Lindsay in 1980 cut off the north end of the Haliburton Subdivision. In 1983, the line was abandoned with the track being removed by 1984. The line eventually became a public multi-use trail.
The Fenelon Falls Museum, open seasonally from May through October, is housed in the 1837 squared-timber home of James Wallis.

<doc id="1206547" wikidata="Q955754" url="?curid=1206547" title="Carl Brashear">
<text>Carl Maxie Brashear (19 January 1931 – 25 July 2006) was a United States Navy sailor. He was a Master Diver, rising to the position in 1970, despite having his lower left leg amputated in 1966. The 2000 film &quot;Men of Honor&quot; was based on his life.

==Early life and education==
Brashear was born on 19 January 1931, in Tonieville, LaRue County, Kentucky, the sixth of 16 children to sharecroppers McDonald and Gonzella Brashear. In 1935, the family settled on a farm in Sonora, Kentucky. Brashear attended Sonora Grade School from 1937 to 1946.

==Career==

Brashear enlisted in the United States Navy on 25 February 1948, four months before the military was desegregated by President Harry S. Truman. He graduated from the United States Navy Diving &amp; Salvage School in 1954, becoming the first African-American to attend and graduate from the Diving &amp; Salvage School and one of the first African-American United States Navy Divers.

While attending diving school in Bayonne, New Jersey, Brashear faced hostility and racism. He found notes on his bunk saying, &quot;We&#x27;re going to drown you today, nigger!&quot; and &quot;We don&#x27;t want any nigger divers.&quot; Brashear received encouragement to finish from Boatswain&#x27;s Mate First Class Harry M. Rutherford, and graduated 16 out of 17.

Brashear first worked as a diver retrieving approximately 16,000 rounds of ammunition that fell off a barge which had broken in half and sunk. On his first tour of shore duty in Quonset Point, Rhode Island, his duties included the salvaging of airplanes (including one Blue Angel) and recovering multiple dead bodies from the sea.

Brashear was assigned to escort the presidential yacht the &quot;Barbara Anne&quot; to Rhode Island. He met President Eisenhower and received a small knife that said, &quot;To Carl M. Brashear. From Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1957. Many, many thanks.&quot; After making Chief Petty Officer in 1959, e stayed at Guam for three years doing mostly demolition dives.

In January 1966, in an accident now known as the Palomares incident, a B28 nuclear bomb was lost off the coast of Palomares, Spain, after two United States Air Force aircraft of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), a B-52G Stratofortress bomber and a KC-135A Stratotanker aerial refueling aircraft, collided during aerial refueling. Brashear was serving aboard when it was dispatched to find and recover the missing bomb for the Air Force. The warhead was found after two and a half months of searching. For his service in helping to retrieve the bomb, Brashear was later awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, the highest navy award for non-combat heroism.

During the bomb recovery operations on 23 March 1966, a lifting cable snapped, causing a pipe to swing across the deck of the USS &quot;Hoist&quot;. Brashear darted to push a shipmate out of the object&#x27;s path. It consequently struck Brashear&#x27;s left leg below the knee, nearly shearing it off. The impact flipped him in the air, almost casting him overboard before he landed on the deck. He was evacuated to Torrejon Air Base in Spain, then to the USAF Hospital at Wiesbaden Air Base, Germany; and finally to the Naval Hospital in Portsmouth, Virginia. Beset with persistent infection and necrosis, his lower left leg was eventually amputated.

Brashear remained at the Naval Regional Medical Center in Portsmouth from May 1966 until March 1967 recovering and rehabilitating from the amputation. From March 1967 to March 1968, Brashear was assigned to the Harbor Clearance Unit Two, Diving School, preparing for return to full active duty and diving. In April 1968, after a long struggle, Brashear was the first amputee diver to be recertified as a United States Navy diver. In 1970, he became possibly the first African-American master diver, (debated between him and John Henry Turpin) and served nine more years beyond that, achieving the rating of master chief boatswain&#x27;s mate in 1971. Brashear was motivated by his beliefs that &quot;It&#x27;s not a sin to get knocked down; it&#x27;s a sin to stay down&quot; and &quot;I ain&#x27;t going to let nobody steal my dream.&quot;

==Retirement==
Brashear retired from the United States Navy on 1 April 1979, as a Master Chief Petty Officer (E-9) and master diver. He then served as a civilian employee for the government at Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia, and retired in 1993 with the grade of GS-11.

==Personal life==
Brashear married and divorced three times: Junetta Wilcoxson (1952–1978), Hattie R. Elam (1980–1983), and Jeanette A. Brundage (1985–1987). He had four children: Shazanta (1955–1996), DaWayne, Phillip, and Patrick. Brashear&#x27;s grand-nephew is a retired professional ice hockey player Donald Brashear.

Brashear died of respiratory and heart failure at the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia, on 25 July 2006. He is buried at Woodlawn Memorial Gardens in Norfolk, Virginia.

==Carl Brashear Foundation==
After his death, his sons DaWayne and Phillip Brashear started the Carl Brashear Foundation in his honor.

==Decorations and awards==
*8 gold service stripes.

===Navy and Marine Corps Medal citation===

The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy and Marine Corps Medal to Chief Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Carl Maxie Brashear, United States Navy, for heroism while serving aboard U.S.S. HOIST (ARS-40), which was operating in support of Task Force 65 on 23 March 1966, in connection with salvage operations of great importance to the United States. While engaged in transferring stores from a landing craft to HOIST in heavy seas off the coast of Spain, Chief Brashear saw the bowline of the landing craft part. Realizing that a shipmate standing in the stern of the landing craft was in serious jeopardy if the heavily strained stern line also parted, he unhesitatingly pushed his shipmate to safety, but was seriously injured himself when the stress from the remaining line caused a portion of the craft to carry away and hit him in the leg. By his prompt and courageous actions in saving another man from injury or possible death, Chief Brashear, at the risk of his own life, upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

==Honors==
Brashear was honored with the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service in October 2000 for 42 years of combined military and federal civilian service. The award was presented by Secretary of Defense William Cohen.

On 24 October 2007, the Newport News Fire Department dedicated a high-speed fireboat named &quot;Carl Brashear&quot; to be used by their Dive and Marine Incident Response Teams.

The &quot;Lewis and Clark&quot;-class dry cargo ship USNS &quot;Carl Brashear&quot; (T-AKE-7) was christened in his honor in San Diego, California, on 18 September 2008. General Dynamics delivered the completed ship to the Navy on 4 March 2009.

On 21 February 2009, Nauticus, a science and maritime museum in downtown Norfolk, Virginia, opened a new exhibit called &quot;Dream to Dive: The Life of Master Diver Carl Brashear.&quot; It is the first full-scale museum exhibit dedicated to Brashear.

In 2009 the Chief Petty Officer Club onboard Naval Station Little Creek VA was renamed The Carl Brashear Center. Carl&#x27;s son and several friends gave speeches at and attended the renaming ceremony. Carl was known to frequent the CPO Club onboard Little Creek up until the time of his death.

On 9 November 2017, the Commonwealth of Kentucky dedicated the &quot;Carl M. Brashear Radcliff Veterans Center&quot; in honor of BMCM (MDV) Carl Brashear. Construction on the new center, which is located about 30 miles from Brashear&#x27;s hometown of Sonora, was completed about a year before the dedication ceremony. On hand was his son Phillip, Founder of the Brashear Foundation, Kentucky Lt. Gov. Jenean Hampton, Veterans Center Administrator Israel Ray, members of the Brashear family, along with members of the Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association who nominated and worked to collect over 7,000 signatures in support of naming the center after Brashear.

On 25 July 2018, Lincoln Parkway bridge, just outside Tonieville, KY was renamed the &quot;Master Chief Petty Officer Carl Maxie Brashear Memorial Bridge.&quot;

Brashear&#x27;s Dress Uniform is on display at the Hardin County History Museum in Elizabethtown, Kentucky as part of the &quot;We Were There&quot; Military Tribute and Exhibit.

Oris SA released the Oris Carl Brashear Cal. 401 Limited Edition dive watch to commemorate Brashear. 

==In popular culture==

<text>Laura S. Walker State Park is a state park in the U.S. state of Georgia. Located near Hoboken and the Okefenokee Swamp, the park is named after Laura S. Walker, a Georgia writer, teacher, civic leader, and naturalist (she is most famous as the latter). The park&#x27;s location near the Okefenokee makes it home to many exotic plant and animal species, including alligators, great blue herons, and pitcher plants. The park includes a lake and a championship 18-hole golf course with a pro shop.

==History==
In the 1930s an effort was made to recognize Waycross, Georgia, conservationist Laura S. Walker for her work promoting forestry and other civic activities. At the urging of Georgia&#x27;s senators, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a proclamation to establish the Laura S. Walker National Park in her honor. She was the only living person for whom a state or national park was named. In 1937, the federal government purchased distressed farmland for the park under a federal land utilization program authorized by the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act. Work on the park was undertaken by the Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps. In 1941, the national park was deeded over to Georgia, becoming the state&#x27;s 13th state park.

<doc id="1206582" wikidata="Q925418" url="?curid=1206582" title="Hungarian Communist Party">
<text>The Hungarian Communist Party (, , abbr. MKP), known earlier as the Party of Communists in Hungary (, , abbr. KMP), was a communist party in Hungary that existed during the interwar period and briefly after World War II.

It was founded on November 24, 1918, as Party of Communists in Hungary, and was in power between March and August 1919 when Béla Kun ran the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic. The communist government was later overthrown by the Romanian Army, Kun was exiled to Vienna and later he and many other communists moved to Moscow. During those years, membership was becoming smaller every year. During World War II the party changed its name to the Peace Party, but only a year later in 1944, they embraced a new name which they would hold until 1948. After the war, they regained power, and their membership rose up quickly, which led to Mátyás Rákosi suppressing other parties in the country besides the social democrats (which were aligned with them) to form a one-party state. In 1948, the party merged with the social democrats to form the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party which became the next ruling party of Hungary. It was also a member of Comintern and its successor Cominform.

== Foundation and early years ==

The Communist Party of Hungary (KMP) was first established as The Party of Communists in Hungary in late 1918 by Béla Kun, a former journalist who fought for Austria-Hungary in World War I. After spending time in a Russian POW camp, Kun, along with several associates, set up the initial workings of the KMP in the downtown of Moscow in October 1918. These first members returned to Hungary in November, and on the 24th officially created the KMP. The Communist Party chose &quot;The Party of Communists in Hungary&quot; (Hungarian: Kommunisták Magyarországi Pártja) as its name, instead of &quot;Hungarian Communist Party&quot;, since the vast majority of its represented social class, the factory workers, still did not have ethnic Hungarian roots in Budapest, and ethnic Hungarians were only a minority in the newly founded party. Initially, the group was small in number and boasted only its founders and a handful of leftist Social Democrats. Nonetheless, the political instability of the government under Mihály Károlyi and the growing popularity of the Bolshevik movement prompted the Social Democrats to seek a coalition with the KMP. For the Social Democrats, an alliance with the KMP not only increased its standing with the common people but also gave it a potential link to the increasingly powerful Russian Communist Party, as Kun had ties with prominent Russian Bolsheviks.

After the establishment of the Hungarian Soviet Republic in March 1919, Kun set about nationalising private industry while embarking on a massive agricultural collectivization project. He also took steps towards normalising foreign relations with the Triple Entente powers in an effort to gain back some of the land that Hungary was set to lose in the postwar negotiations. For the 133 days that the Hungarian Soviet Republic existed, the KMP concentrated mostly on trying to fix the widespread economic chaos that had resulted from Hungary&#x27;s defeat in World War I. Unfortunately, Kun&#x27;s economic policy created higher inflation and led to food shortages across the land. Opposition began to grow, led by Miklós Horthy, and in June, an attempted coup made the KMP launch a violent terror campaign through its secret police. The Soviet Republic fell on August 1, 1919, after the Hungarian Army&#x27;s crushing defeat by Romania. The invading Romanians seized Budapest from the Communists, exiled Kun to Vienna and forced the KMP to hand over power to the Social Democrats.

== Interwar period and exile ==
The fall of the Soviet Republic was followed by a year-long anticommunist purge, known as the White Terror, by the new nationalist government under István Bethlen in which anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people were killed, and thousands more were imprisoned and tortured. Much of the old KMP leadership was executed or exiled, primarily to Vienna. There, remnants of the KMP Central Committee, once again led by Kun, reformed into a Provisional Central Committee, which attempted to keep the party together despite its illegal status in Hungary.

Throughout the 1920s, many Hungarian Communists moved to Moscow, with Kun among them. Kun&#x27;s actions in Russia, most notably the organization of a massacre of White Russian prisoners-of-war in 1921, drew censure from the Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin and other prominent Bolsheviks. Nonetheless, Kun maintained a prominent position with Comintern until 1937, when he was arrested and executed during one of Joseph Stalin’s purges. Furthermore, Kun was the unquestioned leader of the KMP during the interwar period, with his main rival, Jenő Landler, dying in 1927.

The party also organised a legal cover party, the Socialist Workers Party of Hungary (MSzMP), to act as its representative in Hungary. However, the Hungarian government soon took steps to abolish the MSzMP, and by 1927, the party existed in name only.

For the remainder of the interwar period, the internal leadership of the KMP beyond Kun fluctuated tremendously, and membership was minuscule. After the deadly derailment of a passenger train at Biatorbágy by Szilveszter Matuska in 1931, the government declared martial law and used the opportunity to arrest suspected communists. Two of those arrested, and the leading party members Imré Sallai and Sándor Fürst, were executed the following year. The KMP was damaged to the point that the Comintern dissolved it in 1936.

Further throwing the communists into disarray were the inconsistent policies of the Comintern throughout the 1930s, which culminated in the 1939 Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact and the abandonment of the Popular Front tactic, which had marked communist ideology for the last decade. Besides, Stalin&#x27;s purges in the late 1930s had taken a heavy toll on the Hungarian émigrés in Moscow.

== World War II and Communist takeover ==

The KMP entered the 1940s a shell of what it once was. In late 1941, following Germany&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union, the Central Committee advised Party members to work with non-Communist resistance groups in order to present a united anti-German front. This prompted the KMP to attempt to re-establish itself as a legal entity in Hungary, despite the Horthy&#x27;s government&#x27;s alliance with Nazi Germany. This movement was quickly put to an end, however, as mass arrests in 1942 effectively destroyed the leadership of the KMP. This, coupled with the dissolution of Comintern in 1943, spelled the end of the KMP as a functioning party for the time being.

In an effort to continue their actions, Hungarian Communists under János Kádár founded a new party, dubbed the Peace Party, as a replacement for the KMP. This designation lasted until late 1944, at which point the Peace Party reverted to its designation as the Communist Party. By this point, Horthy was frantically trying to end Hungary&#x27;s role in the war. Attempts to scale back the involvement on the German end failed, and so, with the Red Army approaching the country&#x27;s borders, Horthy tried to declare Hungary a neutral state. The move backfired horrendously; the Arrow Cross Party forces seized the capital, took power, and set the stage for a four-month battle that claimed thousands of lives and left Budapest in ruins. The city was finally liberated in February 1945.

Despite rapid growth in membership immediately following the war, the party refounded under the name MKP received 17 percent in the elections, equal to the Hungarian Social Democratic Party. But the appointment of party secretary László Rajk as Minister of the Interior, coupled with the presence of the Red Army in the country and strong support for the MKP within other parties, allowed the Hungarian Communists time to whittle away their political opponents. Party leader Mátyás Rákosi implemented a strategy of pressuring the non-Communist parties to gradually push out their more courageous elements as &quot;fascists&quot; or fascist sympathizers, a strategy he later called salami tactics.

Within two years, the MKP had broken the power base of the Independent Smallholders Party (FKGP), the majority party in the new government, and by 1948, every party but the Social Democrats had either vanished or taken over by fellow travelers willing to do the Communists&#x27; bidding. The Social Democrats were eliminated in 1948 by a forced merger with the Communists in June 1948 which formed the Hungarian Working People&#x27;s Party (MDP). However, the few independent-minded Social Democrats were quickly shunted aside, leaving the MDP as essentially the MKP under a new name. In 1949, elections were held in which voters were presented with a single list from the Communist-controlled Independent Democratic Front.
