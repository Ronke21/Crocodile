<text>Renato Canova (born 21 December 1944) is an Italian athletics coach. He is known to have coached numerous athletes who have won medals in top international middle- and long-distance competitions, and who have set world records.

Over 50 of Canova&#x27;s athletes have won Olympic or World Championship medals.

== Career ==
Prior to becoming a coach, Canova used to be an active athlete, competing in various disciplines, but realized he did not have the talent to become a professional athlete.

From 1975 to 1985, Canova was the national Italian coach of multi-events.

In 1987, Canova began training Italian middle and long distance athletes. Here he trained, among others, Maria Curatolo and Ornella Ferrara. During this time, he worked with Luciano Gigliotti, who was responsible for the male middle and long distance athletes. In 1996, in addition to coaching Italian runners, Canova also began training Kenyan athletes in Italy. He justified this by saying that at that time the level of Italian runners was falling because there weren&#x27;t enough new athletes coming up. In 1998 he traveled to Kenya for the first time.

Beginning in 2003, Canova became the national coach of the Qatari national athletics team. In 2004, one of Canova&#x27;s athletes, Stephen Cherono, changed his citizenship from Kenyan to Qatari. This position enabled him to train more intensively with his athletes, who were of Qatari nationality but most of whom came from Kenya. He relocated to Iten, located at approximately 2,400 m (7,870 ft), for most of the year because he considered the training conditions there to be most suitable. Due to disagreements with the association, he gave up this activity in 2011, which the year after the 2010 Asian Games, when he resigned and returned to Italy. After Canova rejected an offer from the Chinese Athletics Association in 2011, he trained athletes such as Anna and Lisa Hahner.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics, one of Canova&#x27;s athletes won a silver medal (Abel Kirui in the marathon), and two of Canova&#x27;s athletes won bronze medals (Wilson Kipsang in the marathon and Thomas Longosiwa in the 5000 m).

In September 2013, an agreement was reached with the Chinese Athletics Association, where Canova was appointed as the national head coach for middle- and long-distances. Canova agreed to work with the association until the 2016 Olympic Games. However, he did not manage to bring about the desired turnaround for the Chinese runners. He attributed this to China&#x27;s poorly organized and overly regional system. At the beginning of November 2015, he resigned from this position, in spite of having a contract until the end of 2016.

At the beginning of 2016, Canova returned to Kenya to create a new running group.

European record holder Julien Wanders has been trained by Canova since 2020.

== Coaching philosophy ==

Canova&#x27;s training system is based on increasing race-specific endurance. His fundamental period begins with high volume and low-intensity running along with uphill sprints and technical exercises. During the special period, training sessions move toward speeds that are closer to the athlete&#x27;s goal race pace but still relatively far away. In the final specific period, all sessions focus on speeds only slightly slower and faster than race pace but with a goal of performing more and more work in each session. Throughout the training cycle, more and more recovery sessions are included as hard sessions become longer and more fatiguing. Because of this, Canova has very rarely used weekly or bi-weekly training cycles in favor of adapting to the effect of each individual session.

Canova has lectured for World Athletics (formerly IAAF), speaking about training methodology.

Canova believes that a doping agent such as erythropoietin (EPO) would not work on his top athletes because pure aerobic training could increase the capacity of blood in their cardiovascular system to such an extent that EPO would no longer would be beneficial. If this were not the case, EPO could have an effect, but this would not be the case in its athletes. Canova attributes this to the fact that these athletes spend their entire lives at high altitudes.

Canova sees the reason for the success of his athletes in their training and in their talent and motivation. He maintains that all the athletes he knows and trains are clean. He attributes the fact that the Europeans and Americans fall in level compared to the East African runners to the different approaches to training. Non-African athletes would not train intensively enough.

== Criticism ==
Canova is often confronted with criticism that his athletes are doped. These claims are often attributed to doping bans for individual athletes who were trained by him, along with reports of widespread doping in relation to running in Kenya. Canova commented that no fewer than ten doping tests were carried out on his athletes every week.

== Personal life ==
Canova was married to Daniela Gregorutti, who was a middle-distance runner and was trained by him. Gregorutti died in February 2021.

<text>Second Lieutenant Sidney Clayton Woodroffe VC (17 December 1895 − 30 July 1915) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Woodroffe was born in Lewes, East Sussex and was educated at Marlborough College.

He was 19 years old, and a second lieutenant in the 8th Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 30 July 1915 at Hooge, Belgium, when the enemy had broken through the centre of our front trenches, Second Lieutenant Woodroffe&#x27;s position was heavily attacked with bombs from the flank and subsequently from the rear, but he managed to defend his post until all his bombs were exhausted. He then skillfully withdrew his remaining men and immediately led them forward in a counter-attack under intense rifle and machine-gun fire, and was killed whilst in the act of cutting the wire obstacles in the open.

2nd Lt. Woodroffe has no known grave and is commemorated at the Menin Gate in Ypres. His entry is possibly unique, in that the postnomial VC appears before his name, and was most likely added at a later date. He is also listed on the Lewes War Memorial.

==The medal==
This medal is in the Lord Ashcroft V.C. Trust Collection in the Imperial War Museum.

==Further information==
War poet Charles Sorley, a contemporary of Woodroffe at Marlborough, dedicated a poem to Woodroffe entitled &#x27;In Memoriam SCW VC&#x27;
He was the brother of Kenneth Woodroffe, a cricketer who played for Hampshire and Sussex. Kenneth was also killed in 1915 whilst serving with the Rifle Brigade.

<doc id="1190545" wikidata="Q9079137" url="?curid=1190545" title="Queenstown, Singapore">
<text>Queenstown is a planning area and satellite residential town situated on the south-westernmost fringe of the Central Region of Singapore. It borders Bukit Timah to the north, Tanglin to the northeast, Bukit Merah to the east and southeast, as well as Clementi to the northwest and west. Its southern and southwesternmost limits are bounded by the Pandan Strait.

Developed by the Singapore Improvement Trust in the 1950s and subsequently by the Housing and Development Board in the 1960s, Queenstown was the first satellite town to be built in the country. Most apartments within the township consists of simple one, two, or three-room flats, typically in low-rise, walk-up blocks. Major development work was carried out during the first Five-Year Building Programme between 1960 and 1965. A total of 19,372 dwelling units were constructed between 1952 and 1968.

The headquarters of Grab, Razer and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) are located in Queenstown.

==Etymology==
Queenstown was named after Queen Elizabeth II to mark Her Majesty&#x27;s coronation in 1953. The area was previously known by the Mandarin Chinese name &quot;Wu-wei-gang&quot; (Wade Giles: Wu-wei-kang), or in Hokkien as Boh Beh Kang. The arterial road Queensway was officially named in 1954.

==History==
Previously, the area which Queenstown currently occupies was a large swampy valley with a channel running through in a southeastern direction. On either side of this agricultural area were hills – &quot;feng xing&quot; and &quot;feng ling&quot;. The former was a rubber plantation and the latter, a cemetery also known as &quot;boh beh kang&quot;. The village in the area, with mainly Hokkien and Teochew-speaking dwellers was also the area was inhabited by hundreds of people in attap-roofed huts, cultivating vegetables, growing fruits and rearing pigs and chickens. Buller Camp, a British military camp, was also set up there until 1953 when it was cleared for the new housing estate.

During World War II, Pasir Panjang Ridge became a battleground during the Japanese Invasion of Singapore, where a fierce battle was fought between the defending Malay Regiment and the Japanese troops in February 1942. Despite its valiant efforts to defend Bukit Chandu (Opium Hill in Malay), a key strategic defence position, the Malay Regiment was eventually defeated as it was greatly outnumbered. In 2002, a war museum was opened in Bukit Chandu to commemorate the Battle of Pasir Panjang.

In 1947, the Housing Committee of Singapore highlighted the problem of inadequate housing in Singapore. The report proposed the decentralisation of the population away from the city with the building of self-contained residential areas in the suburbs. This proposal was believed to be an influence of the New town movements in post-war Britain.

The area was subsequently chosen by Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) as a site for housing development due to its proximity to the successful first public housing scheme in Tiong Bahru. Plans for the development of the area were first announced to the general public on 27 September 1953, with construction of Queenstown&#x27;s first estate, Princess Margaret Estate (named after HM Elizabeth II&#x27;s younger sister) having already begun last in July last year. By late 1953, a preliminary batch of 3-room flats was ready for occupation. By 1956, work on the Princess Margaret Estate (later shortened to Princess Estate) had more than 1,000 flats comprising one, two and three-room units and 68 terrace houses. A ceremony was held in October that year for Forfar House, a 14-storey block which was a prominent landmark in those days as it was the tallest HDB flat at that point of time.

The area continued to develop as a self-contained community. Some of the facilities and amenities developed included the Town Centre and the Swimming and Sports Complex. The former was fully completed in 1969 with three cinemas and a variety of outlets including an emporium, a fresh food market, a maternity and child health centre, a bowling alley and a nightclub cum restaurant. The swimming complex was completed in August 1970.

In the 1970s, the success of the new town led to the development of Buona Vista and Holland Village, using the older neighbourhoods of Queenstown as a model. However, by the 1980s, the area had become a mature estate with a higher proportion of senior citizens residing in the area than elsewhere, and a gradual migration of the younger generation into other HDB new towns.

==Geography==


Queenstown is bounded by the Ulu Pandan Canal, Ghim Moh Housing Estate and the former Tanglin Camp area to the north, Alexandra Road to the east, Clementi Road to the west and the sea to the south. It covers an area of approximately 2,188 ha. The total population (1990 census) is 126,071 with 31,131 housing units. It consists of 16 subzones, namely Ghim Moh, Holland Drive, Commonwealth, Tanglin Halt, Margaret Drive, Mei Chin, Queensway, Portsdown, Buona Vista, Singapore Polytechnic, Dover, National University, Kent Ridge, Pasir Panjang, Pasir Panjang II, and the Port.

Pasir Panjang lies to the south of Queenstown (&quot;Pasir Panjang&quot; in Malay means &quot;long sandy beach&quot;). The coastline was dotted with Malay villages, the main economic activities being fishing and small-scale agriculture. Only after the war, did the development of the area begin, with bungalows along the coastline being built in the 1950s. Today, Pasir Panjang is a popular recreational area for sea sports and attractions such as the Haw Par Villa.

==Main housing estates==

The main housing areas within Queenstown include:
* Princess Estate is the first subdistrict of the Queenstown District consists of several precincts like Strathmore and Dawson. It is also the first rebuilt estate under SERS.
* Duchess Estate is the second subdistrict of Queenstown district which consists of Queenstown Centre and Margaret Drive. Several blocks of 2-storey and 3-storey flats are located in this area. It is also the second rebuilt estate under SERS.
* Tanglin Halt consists of rows of ten storey flats. The remaining HDB flats at Tanglin Halt will be demolished by 2021. It is also the third rebuilt estate under SERS.
* Commonwealth Estate is located near Commonwealth MRT station and consists of precincts like Commonwealth Close and Commonwealth Crescent. It is best known for having a fantastic view of Singapore&#x27;s Downtown. It is also the fourth rebuilt estate under SERS, to be demolished together with Tanglin Halt.
* Queen&#x27;s Close is a cluster of flats bounded by Mei Ling district, Portsdown Road and Alexandra Road. Queen&#x27;s Crescent is now demolished and redevelopment will only begin in 2021.
* Mei Ling/Mei Chin is built from the excavation of two hills, Hong Lim and Hong Yin Hill which are used for cemetery purposes. It is also where Queenstown district got its name Boh Beh Kang, or a river with no source.
* Buona Vista is the last district built in Queenstown. However, it has developed a distinct and unique identity today that is commonly not linked with Queenstown.
* Dover is a small neighbourhood located in the south of Buona Vista. It is also commonly not associated with Queenstown despite being under its planning area. Dover is known to have many schools around its neighbourhood and National University of Singapore and Singapore Polytechnic is also located in this region.
* Ghim Moh is an estate located beside Buona Vista known for its attractive food. It consists of 28 blocks.

===Forfar Heights===
Forfar House, or Block 39, was built in 1956 by the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) as a 14-storey block (which at that time was the tallest residential building in Singapore, holding the record until the building of a 20-story block at Selegie in 1963). Also known as &quot;Chap Si Lao&quot;, it was an early part of the mixed height development of the area. The new blocks at Forfar Heights are featured with blue glazing and blue floodlights at the roofline, reminiscent of the early days, where many units were characterised by the blue glass in their windows, by which the district was acquired its Hokkien name &quot;Lam Po Lay&quot;.

Block 39, Forfar Square, had 106 three-room-flats, four shops, and an eating house, until it was demolished in the early 2000s together with the surrounding SIT blocks under the Selective &quot;en bloc&quot; Redevelopment Scheme (SERS). Currently, the new Forfar Heights consists of two 40-storey blocks (Blk 48, 52) and three 30-storey blocks (Blk 49–51). Residency was offered to residents from the old Forfar House and Blocks 6A &amp; 6B Margaret Drive in 1996, and residents from Block 172–175 Stirling Road &amp; Block 96 Margaret Drive in 2001. The new blocks were launched on &quot;Tree Planting Day 2005 and SERS Completion Ceremony&quot; on 6 November 2005 with guest of honour, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and Member of Parliament for Tanjong Pagar GRC.

The name for Forfar Heights had its origin from Forfar Square, which like most Queenstown street names, was connected to the British Royal Family. The name &quot;Forfar&quot; comes from &quot;The Royal Burgh of Forfar&quot;, a Scottish town near the childhood home of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother.

==Demographics==
Being the first satellite HDB town in Singapore, Queenstown has one of the highest proportions of elderly aged 65 and above. Many of the residents live in smaller 2-room and 3-room flats. As a result, Queenstown earned its reputation as an &quot;elderly town&quot;.

Further developments in Dawson located in Princess Estate have attracted many young Singaporeans to this area in the 2000s as part of the urban renewal efforts. It was announced in 2006 that Margaret Drive will be developed into a modern district with amenities.

Due to the comparatively longer heritage of Queenstown district, local community has flourished. Various online communities such as MyQueenstown have been introduced by the local, independent parts of the district. This has certainly changed the image of the district.

==Transportation==


=== Mass Rapid Transit ===
There are 9 Mass Rapid Transit stations that serve the planning area, across 2 lines, the East West Line and the Circle Line. Both lines have an interchange station at Buona Vista station. The 9 stations are:

* Queenstown

=== Bus ===
There are 3 bus terminals within the planning area. Buona Vista Bus Terminal is located along Holland Drive while Ghim Moh Bus Terminal is located along Ghim Moh Road. Both of which are near to the Buona Vista MRT Station. Kent Ridge Bus Terminal is located within the vicinity of the Kent Ridge campus of the National University of Singapore, at the western portion of the planning area.

All three bus terminals within the planning area are anchored by Clementi Bus Package under Bus Contracting Model.

=== Roads ===
Queenstown planning area is connected by road to the rest of Singapore via the Ayer Rajah Expressway, a major expressway connecting western Singapore to the Central Area, and also to Johor via the Tuas Second Link. Major roads in the planning area include Queensway, which is part of the Outer Ring Road System (ORRS), a semi-expressway, together with Portsdown Avenue. Queensway intersects with Commonwealth Avenue, a major road that parallels the East West Line and continues into Commonwealth Avenue West at Buona Vista. At the southern portion, the West Coast Highway is a major arterial road that links the district of Pasir Panjang to the Jurong Industrial Estate to the west and the Central Area to the east. At the eastern border with Bukit Merah, Alexandra Road is a major road that connects Pasir Panjang Road with Ayer Rajah Expressway, Queensway and Commonwealth Avenue.

<text>Sørkedalen is a valley located in the northwestern part of Oslo municipality, northwest of Oslo&#x27;s western suburbs, in Norway.

The valley stretches from the suburb of Røa to Skansebakken. The valley is frequently used as an entry point to Nordmarka, the large wilderness recreational area to the north of Oslo.

Sørkedalen is an agricultural valley with several small farms, and stables for recreational horse riding. The valley is a popular destination for outdoor activities like skiing, riding and golfing for the population of West End Oslo and Bærum. Sørkedalen Church is a stone church from 1865 which was built of brick and has 250 seats. The church is in neo-Gothic style.

In the southern part of this valley is the old manor of Bogstad, which was owned by Peder Anker. On the manor grounds there are the lake &quot;Bogstadvannet&quot; and the Oslo Golf Club (&quot;Oslo Golfklubb&quot;) which was the first golf club to be established in Norway. The Sørkedalselva river runs through the valley and into the Bogstadvannet.

==The name==
The Norse form of the name was &quot;Surkudalr&quot;. The first element is the genitive of the rivername &quot;Surka&quot; (now Sørkedalselva), the last element is &quot;dalr&quot; m &#x27;dale, valley&#x27;. The meaning of the river&#x27;s name is unknown (maybe &#x27;the dark one&#x27;).

<doc id="1190554" wikidata="Q1241117" url="?curid=1190554" title="Eustace Percy, 1st Baron Percy of Newcastle">
<text>Eustace Sutherland Campbell Percy, 1st Baron Percy of Newcastle (21 March 1887 – 3 April 1958), styled Lord Eustace Percy between 1899 and 1953, was a British diplomat, Conservative politician, public servant, and aristocrat from the Percy family. He most notably served as President of the Board of Education under Stanley Baldwin between 1924 and 1929.

==Background and education==
Percy was born at 25 Grosvenor Square, Mayfair, into a noble family: he was the seventh and youngest son of Henry Percy, 7th Duke of Northumberland, and Lady Edith, daughter of George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll. Henry Percy, Earl Percy, and Alan Percy, 8th Duke of Northumberland, were his elder brothers. His uncle, the ninth Duke of Argyll, was married to Princess Louise, daughter of Queen Victoria. A niece Lady Diana Percy later married the sixth Duke of Sutherland.

He was educated at Eton and Christ Church, Oxford. He won the Stanhope essay prize in 1907 and took first-class honours in Modern History.

==Political career==
Percy served in the Diplomatic Service between 1911 and 1919. From 1919–22, he represented Holborn on the London County Council as a Municipal Reform Party councillor. In 1921, he was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Hastings, a seat he held until 1937. In March 1923, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education by Bonar Law. When Stanley Baldwin became Prime Minister in May of the same year, Percy was moved to the post of Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health, which he remained until the fall of the government in January 1924.

When the Conservatives returned to power in November 1924, he was appointed President of the Board of Education by Baldwin, with a seat in the cabinet, and sworn of the Privy Council. He continued as head of the Board of Education until the government fell in June 1929.

Percy did not serve in the National Government of Ramsay MacDonald between 1931 and 1935, but when Baldwin returned as Prime Minister in June 1935 he again became a member of the cabinet as Minister without Portfolio, a post he held until 1936. Given charge of policy direction for the government in the latter role, he was often dubbed the &quot;Minister for Thought&quot; by the Press. In the 1930s, he called for regional government for the North East of England, specifically wishing to be the minister for the region.

In his 1944 Riddell Lecture, Percy made a call for the law to be changed radically to recognise companies as associations of productive employees, rather than as associations of shareholders. These were his words: &quot;Here is the most important challenge to political invention ever offered to the jurist or the statesman. The human association which in fact produces and distributes wealth, the association of workmen, managers, technicians and directors is not an association recognised by law. The association which the law does recognise – the association of shareholders, creditors and directors – is incapable of producing and distributing and is not expected to perform these functions. We have to give law to the real association and withdraw meaningless privilege from the imaginary one.&quot;

In 1945, Percy chaired the committee on Higher Technological Education that resulted in the Percy Report. He also chaired a Royal Commission that reviewed mental health legislation in the 1950s and was Rector of King&#x27;s College, Durham (now Newcastle University) between 1937 and 1951, in which role he also alternated in the post of Vice-Chancellor of Durham University. In 1953 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Percy of Newcastle, of Etchingham in the County of Sussex.

==Family==
Percy married Stella Katherine, daughter of Major-General Laurence George Drummond, in 1918. They had two daughters. He died in April 1958, aged 71, in Etchingham. As he had no sons the barony became extinct on his death.

<text>The freak scene was originally a component of the bohemian subculture which began in California in the mid-1960s, associated with (or part of) the hippie movement. The term is also used to refer to the post-hippie and pre-punk period of the early to mid-1970s. It can be viewed as encompassing a range of disparate groups including hippies, pacifists, politicized radicals, as well as psychedelic and progressive rock fans. Those connected with the subculture often attended rock festivals, free festivals, happenings, and alternative society gatherings of various kinds.

==Origins==
In the United States of the 1960s, especially during the heyday of the hippie counterculture on the west coast, many teens and young adults that were disillusioned with the austere confines of the postwar, suburbanite American way of life, and some of the resultant countercultural and New Left movements defined themselves as &quot;freaks&quot;. During the early 1960s, painter, sculptor and former marathon dancing champion Vito Paulekas and his wife Szou established a clothing boutique on the corner of Laurel Avenue and Beverly Boulevard in Hollywood, close to Laurel Canyon. Paulekas and his later associate Carl Franzoni (known as &quot;Captain Fuck&quot;) were known for their sexual appetites and unconventional behavior. They and an expanding troupe of associates called themselves &quot;freaks&quot; or &quot;freakers&quot;, and became well known in the area by about 1963 for their eccentric free-form dancing in Sunset Strip nightclubs, being described as &quot;an acid-drenched extended family of brain-damaged cohabitants&quot;.

Barry Miles wrote: &quot;The first hippies in Hollywood, perhaps the first hippies anywhere, were Vito, his wife Zsou , Captain Fuck and their group of about thirty-five dancers. Calling themselves Freaks, they lived a semi-communal life and engaged in sex orgies and free-form dancing whenever they could.&quot; Frank Zappa said of Vito&#x27;s freaks: &quot;As soon as they arrived they would make things happen, because they were dancing in a way nobody had seen before, screaming and yelling out on the floor and doing all kinds of weird things. They were dressed in a way that nobody could believe, and they gave life to everything that was going on.&quot;

Musicians and others who became associated with the scene at the time included Zappa, his later wife Gail Sloatman, Kim Fowley, Arthur Lee, David Crosby, Don Van Vliet (Captain Beefheart), and The GTOs. Zappa and The Mothers of Invention became central to the freak scene in Los Angeles, and the term &quot;freak&quot; appeared throughout the liner notes of the 1966 Mothers of Invention album &quot;Freak Out!&quot;. At the first Mothers of Invention concerts, audience members were invited to &quot;freak out!&quot;, which meant to express themselves freely, be it through dancing, screaming, or letting a band member spray them with whipped cream. In terms of concert culture, the freak mentality influenced similar bands of subsequent musical generations. The freaks, by Zappa&#x27;s reckoning, resisted the binaries of right versus left, dominant culture versus counterculture, or squares versus hippies, preferring instead to align themselves with an aesthetic not narrowly defined by fashion or political leanings. The concept also allowed The Mothers to celebrate the freak identity, which until then was used to describe perversions of nature or carnivalesque sideshows. &quot;Bearded and gross and filthy, entirely obscene, they...were freaks. They were meant to be. They were playing the same old game again, &quot;épater la bourgeoisie&quot;, but this time round it wasn&#x27;t called Dada or Existentialism or Beat, it was Freak-Out. &#x27;On a personal level&#x27;, wrote Zappa, &#x27;Freaking out is a process whereby an individual casts off outmoded and restricted standards of thinking, dress and social etiquette in order to express CREATIVELY his relationship to his environment and the social structure as a whole.

==Wider use of the term==
The term &quot;freaks&quot; became much more widely and generally used in the late 1960s and early 1970s, often as a synonym for &quot;hippies&quot; (although Zappa, in particular, regularly drew a clear distinction between the two subcultures). The freaks, with their aggressively anti-social stance, came in for much criticism, not only from conventional culture but from within the counterculture itself, for their &#x27;pretext of a theoretically total but actually quite false revolt against the &quot;conventional lies of civilization&quot;&#x27;. John Lennon sang how &#x27;&quot;freaks on the phone won&#x27;t leave me alone&quot;&#x27;, explaining how he was &#x27;sick of all these aggressive hippies or whatever they are, the Now Generation...demanding my attention as if I owed them something...under a delusion of awareness by having long hair and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m sick of&#x27;. Bob Dylan also suffered from &#x27;Dylan freaks...once more trying to force him to live up to their concept of what he should be&#x27;. In a not atypical exchange, he&#x27;d be told &#x27;&quot;you&#x27;ve got to live up to your responsibility as a culture hero – you&#x27;re DYLAN, man, every freak has a soft spot in their heart for ya...you&#x27;re DYLAN, DYLAN, DYLAN.&quot;&#x27; only for him to reply &#x27;&quot;I&#x27;m not Dylan, you&#x27;re Dylan&quot;&#x27;.

Members of the Weather Underground drafted their manifesto and on the U.S. state with the sentence: &quot;Freaks are revolutionaries and revolutionaries are freaks&quot;.

Freaks&#x27; hairstyles were mostly long and unkempt. The clothing of the freaks used elements of roleplay such as headbands, cloaks, frock coats, and kaftans, suggesting either a romantic historical era or a distant region. These were combined with cheap, hardwearing clothes such as jeans and army surplus coats.

==Music and culture==
Freak scene music was an eclectic mixture based around progressive rock and experimentalism. There were crossover bands bridging rock and jazz, rock and folk, rock and sci-fi (space rock). BBC radio presenter John Peel presented a nightly show that featured the music. In 1967, The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band&#x27;s album parodied the expression in the sleeve notes for the song &quot;Cool Britannia&quot;, which said &quot;Someone letta Freak-Out? What do you think Reader?&quot; Another musical reference is in Joni Mitchell&#x27;s 1971 song &quot;Carey&quot;: &quot;A round for these freaks and these soldiers / A round for these friends of mine...&quot; Ian Gillan of Deep Purple often referred to himself as a freak, such as in the song &quot;Space Truckin&#x27;&quot; (with the lyric &quot;The Freaks said &#x27;Man those cats could really swing&#x27;&quot;) and the song &quot;No No No&quot; (with the line &quot;Looking at them all it feels good to be a freak&quot;).

J. R. R. Tolkien novels were big influences on lyrics of bands like Led Zeppelin, which created interest in the novels among followers of the bands.

The freak scene made inroads into the underground comix movement in &quot;The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers&quot; by Gilbert Shelton in 1968. Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers comics, an original underground comix scene, over three decades had influenced thousands of people and thousands of new readers yearly.

Following the success of the 1978 smash hit &quot;Le Freak&quot; by Chic, the term enjoyed somewhat of a resurgence on the funk scene by the early 1980s, thanks to artists like Rick James, Whodini and Midnight Star. In 1981, Was (Not Was) released &quot;Out Come the Freaks&quot;. The 1988 album &quot;Bug&quot; by Dinosaur Jr includes the song &quot;Freak Scene&quot;, which in turn has given its name to restaurants owned by chef Scott Hallsworth.

<text>Herbert Ralph Kohl (born August 22, 1937) is an American educator best known for his advocacy of progressive alternative education and as the author of more than thirty books on education. He founded the 1960s Open School movement and is credited with coining the term &quot;open classroom&quot;.

== Early life ==
Born into a Jewish household, Kohl attended the Bronx High School of Science and studied philosophy and mathematics at Harvard University from 1954 to 1958. At Harvard he was president of the Signet Society and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, graduating with an AB degree in 1958. During the 1958–59 academic year he attended University College, Oxford on a Henry Fellowship, and in 1959–1960 he studied philosophy at Columbia University with a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship.

Deciding against an academic career, Kohl entered Teachers College, Columbia University, in 1961 and, in 1962, received an MA in teaching, while qualifying for a permanent K-8 teaching certificate in New York City public schools. In 1962 Kohl became a sixth-grade teacher in the New York City public schools, something he had dreamed of doing since childhood.

== Early career ==
Kohl has been teaching and writing for over 45 years. During that time, he has taught every grade from kindergarten through graduate school but not in that order.

His career as a teacher began in 1962 in Harlem, where he continued to work for six years. From September 1964 to June 1967, under a grant from the National Institute of Education, he ran a storefront school for junior high and high school students, taught high school psychology and writing, and worked as curriculum coordinator for the Parent Board of the I.S. 201 Community School District.

In 1967, he became the founding director of the Teachers &amp; Writers Collaborative, a project intended to transform the teaching of writing in the schools. He is still a board member of the Collaborative.

In 1964, Kohl&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Age of Complexity&quot;, about analytic and existential philosophy, was published at the same time that he was teaching sixth grade. His first writings on education, &quot;Teaching the Unteachable&quot; (New York Review of Books, New York, 1967) and &quot;The Language and Education of the Deaf&quot; (The Urban Review Press, New York, 1967), set the themes for much of his future work. They centered on advocating for the education of poor and disabled students and critiquing and demystifying the stigmatization of students who are perfectly capable of learning.

In 1967, 36 Children (New American Library, New York, 1967) was also published, and Kohl was drawn into national debates on the education of African American and other minority student and into conversations on school reform and the nature of teaching and learning. He is still engaged in them now having lived through cycles of reform and reaction, none of which succeeded in creating excellent education for the children of the poor. The problems persist, and he still believes that by hard, imaginative effort, they can be solved.

In 1968, Kohl moved to Berkeley, California, where his family lived for the next nine years. He was a Visiting Associate Professor, half time in the English Department and half in the School of Education, at the University of California, Berkeley during the spring semester of 1968. Then, he received a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York (September 1968 to June 1969) to work with Allan Kaprow, the &quot;happener&quot; who was a Professor of Art at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, on teacher education and the development of creative curriculum that crossed disciplinary and artistic boundaries. Working with Kaprow freed him to cross boundaries, work with students in theater, and experiment with interactive media. The unlikely marriage, made by Margaret Mahoney of Carnegie, had a profound influence on Kohl&#x27;s teaching and thinking about learning.

An alternative high school, Other Ways emerged during that collaboration and it was supported, in 1969, by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation (September 1969 to June 1970) and then the Ford Foundation (September 1970 to June 1971). It was one of the first attempts to create a series of alternative educational options within public school systems and part of the free school movement. An assessment by the Scientific Analysis Corp. documents that during Kohl&#x27;s tenure, Other Ways offered no basic skills, focusing instead on subjects such as Taoist Science, the Unconscious and Decision Making, Guerrilla Theatre, Urban Survival, Seamanship, etc. For that reason, students were simultaneously enrolled at one of the regular secondary schools, where they also took classes. In Spring 1971, Other Ways became part of the Berkeley Experimental Schools Project (BESP), leading to Kohl&#x27;s resignation, due to loss of the school&#x27;s independence as well as staff and student conflict. BESP was one of eight projects funded nationally by the federal Experimental Schools Program (ESP), which was launched in 1970 as part of the U.S. Office of Education. The announced federal aim of the program was to effect “comprehensive change” within local school districts. Kohl&#x27;s perspective on Other Ways can be found in &quot;Half the House&quot; (Dutton, New York, 1974). One student&#x27;s experience at the school, including a tumultuous sexual relationship with an Other Ways teacher and administrator that began during Kohl&#x27;s tenure, is documented in the voluminous diary writings of Tammy Bellah that appear in Melanie Bellah&#x27;s &quot;Tammy: A Biography of a Young Girl&quot; (Aten Press, 1999). Tammy Bellah was the eldest daughter of sociologist Robert N. Bellah. She committed suicide in 1973.

In 1972, Kohl became co-director of the teacher education program at the Center for Open Learning and Teaching, and he taught a combined kindergarten–first grade at a Berkeley public elementary school while he was acting as a master teacher for its teacher education students.

For ten years (1970 to 1982), he wrote a monthly column for &quot;Teacher Magazine&quot;, and he contributed many reviews and articles for publications such as &quot;The New York Times, The Times, The Nation, and The New York Review of Books&quot;. Kohl also wrote a number of books during that period including &quot;The Open Classroom, Golden Boy as Anthony Cool, Reading, How to, A Book of Puzzlements, Mathematical Puzzlements, On Teaching, Growing With Your Children, and Half the House.&quot;

Kohl&#x27;s writing had significant influence on other education writers and theorists including John Holt, Jonathan Kozol, Richard Farson, Ivan Illich, Paul Goodman, George Dennison, James Herndon, Charles E. Silberman, John Taylor Gatto, Neil Postman and others.

In 1976, Herbert and Judith Kohl, his wife, wrote &quot;The View from the Oak&quot;, which won the 1978 National Book Award, Children&#x27;s Literature.

In 1977, they moved to Point Arena, California, and established the Coastal Ridge Research and Education Center. Over the years, it has sponsored a summer camp, where he taught theater, and hosted a number of seminars on education and social justice. Such seminars have involved educators such as Myles Horton and Septum Clarke of the Highlander Center, Joseph and Helen Featherstone, William Ayers, Len Solo, Ira Glaser, Norm Fruchter, Asa Hilliard, Courtney Cazden, Phillip Lopate, Cynthia Brown, and Ron Jones. The Center also worked with Amnesty International developing a curriculum on conscience and human rights and with the ACLU developing a Bill of Rights curriculum.

Kohl also spent a year (1985–1986) teaching in a one-room schoolhouse in Point Arena, and he created, under a grant from the Agency for International Development and the University of Massachusetts Amherst (June 1986 – January 1986), a month-long residential session and a semester&#x27;s internship in the New York City schools for the heads of teachers&#x27; colleges from Botswana sponsored by UMass Amherst.

During the 1980s, Kohl also spent time working with a number of pioneers in the computer world. He was on the Board of the Atari Education Foundation and consulted with Alan Kay&#x27;s Vivarium Project of Apple Computers. His work with computers also involved being a games columnist for &quot;Recreational Computing Magazine and Publish!&quot;, spending several years (1983–1985) as Director of Software Development for &quot;Scientific American&quot;, co-authoring four books on computer programming and games for Reston Publishing Company, and editing a series of books on games and computers for them as well. Also during that period, as a member of the Executive Board of PEN, American Center, he established the PEN American Center West.

Kohl continued writing over these years and teaching occasionally as a Research Fellow at the University of San Francisco. He was the Gordon Sanders Professor of Education at Hamline University in St. Paul in 1988–1989 and then later spent more time in the Twin Cities area, as Benedict Professor of Educational Studies at Carleton College in 1995. Meanwhile, he was engaged with developing pedagogical content and structure that would take advantage of the strengths and experiences of poor and minority students.

Throughout the 1980s, Herb and Judith Kohl worked with Myles Horton on his autobiography, &quot;The Long Haul&quot; (Doubleday, New York, 1990). It won the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award in 1991.

From September 1994 to June 1997, Kohl had the opportunity to work, through a grant from the Aaron Diamond Foundation, with the Fund for New York City Public Education September. The goal of the project was to design structures for the development of small, theme-based and community-oriented schools of choice within the city&#x27;s public school system. The Fund morphed into New Visions Schools and is engaged in implementing that work.

In 1997, Kohl was appointed a Senior Fellow at the Open Society Institute, the US foundation that is part of the Soros Foundation Network. From September 1997 to June 1999, he worked towards planning a funding strategy in education for the Foundation, and in the process, he managed to support a number of projects that promise effective school reform.

Kohl has found himself both teaching and writing throughout his adult life. He feels that writing is a private matter, education a public one. They play off each other, nurturing and informing each other. Both are a source of energy and give him a feeling of being of use to others. His books published from 1982 to 1999 include &quot;Basic Skills&quot; (Little Brown, Boston, 1982), &quot;Growing Minds&quot; (Harper and Row, New York, 1986), &quot;Making Theater&quot; (Teachers and Writers Collaborative, New York, 1988), &quot;I Won&#x27;t Learn from You&quot; (The New Press, New York, 1994), and &quot;Should We Burn Barbar?&quot; (The New Press, New York, 1995), and &quot;The Discipline of Hope&quot; (Simon and Schuster, New York, 1998).

==Later life==
In the spring of 2000, after his Fellowship at the Open Society Institute was completed, Kohl accepted the challenge of building a small, autonomous teacher education program centered on equity and social justice at the University of San Francisco (USF). The Center for Teaching Excellence and Social Justice opened with 25 students in the fall of 2000. The first year was supported by a special innovative grant from the President of USF (January 2000 to January 2001). The next three years were supported by a grant from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation (September 2001 to June 2004). Under the terms of the grant, the Center also worked on reform in the Oakland and San Francisco school districts.

Meanwhile, Kohl published a book of essays, &quot;Stupidity and Tears&quot; (The New Press, New York, 2003) and &quot;She Would Not be Moved&quot; (The New Press, New York, 2005).

In 2005, he left the program at USF after five years and accepted a year&#x27;s appointment as Eugene Lang Visiting Professor for Issues of Social Change at Swarthmore College during the academic year of 2005–06.

Kohl returned to his home in Point Arena in the summer of 2006. Storms and water damage during the spring destroyed his study and many of his books and resources. It took months to rebuild, and some of the work is still going on. Nevertheless, he continued to write, and his book &quot;Painting Chinese&quot; (Bloomsbury, New York, 2007) was finished in Point Arena and published in 2007. In addition, a collection of his works, &quot;The Herb Kohl Reader&quot; (The New Press, New York, 2009) was published in 2009.

He continues to work with educators across the country. In particular he&#x27;s currently collaborating with Kevin Truitt, formerly principal of Mission High School and currently Associate Superintendent of the San Francisco Unified School District, on a book about the complex, demanding, and often heart breaking lives of urban high school principals. The book proposes a way of supporting principals that is a cross between psychotherapy and dramaturgy, which they tried out for three years and decided to call edutherapy.

In 2012, Kohl published a collaborative book with Tom Oppenheim and the Stella Adler Acting Studio, of which he is Director, on advocating support for the arts, as necessary components of any decent public education. In conjunction with this book, &quot;The Muses Go to School: Inspiring Stories about the Importance of Arts in Education,&quot; he interviewed artists such as Phylicia Rashad, Rosie Perez, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Moises Kaufman, Bill T. Jones, and Whoopi Goldberg, and educators such as Maxine Greene, Frances Lucerna, Lisa Delpit, and Steve Seidel.

Kohl is also currently teaching an essay writing class in Point Arena and working on a book of personal essays.

At the center of all of his work is the belief that a quality education for all children is a pedagogical imperative and a social justice issue.

<doc id="1190561" wikidata="Q477371" url="?curid=1190561" title="Kitchen sink realism">
<text>Kitchen sink realism (or kitchen sink drama) is a British cultural movement that developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s in theatre, art, novels, film and television plays, whose protagonists usually could be described as &quot;angry young men&quot; who were disillusioned with modern society. It used a style of social realism which depicted the domestic situations of working-class Britons, living in cramped rented accommodation and spending their off-hours drinking in grimy pubs, to explore controversial social and political issues ranging from abortion to homelessness. The harsh, realistic style contrasted sharply with the escapism of the previous generation&#x27;s so-called &quot;well-made plays&quot;.

The films, plays and novels employing this style are often set in poorer industrial areas in the North of England, and use the accents and slang heard in those regions. The film &quot;It Always Rains on Sunday&quot; (1947) is a precursor of the genre and the John Osborne play &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1956) is thought of as the first of the genre. The gritty love-triangle of &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot;, for example, takes place in a cramped, one-room flat in the English Midlands. Shelagh Delaney&#x27;s 1958 play &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; (which was made into a film of the same name in 1961) is about a white teenage schoolgirl who has an affair with a black sailor, gets pregnant and then moves in with a gay male acquaintance; it raises issues such as class, ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation. The conventions of the genre have continued into the 2000s, finding expression in such television shows as &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

The term &quot;Kitchen Sink School&quot; was first used in the visual arts, where the art critic David Sylvester used it in 1954 to describe a group of painters who called themselves the Beaux Arts Quartet, and depicted social realist–type scenes of domestic life.

==History==
The cultural movement was rooted in the ideals of social realism, an artistic movement expressed in the visual and other realist arts which depicts working class activities. Many artists who subscribed to social realism were painters with socialist political views. While the movement has some commonalities with Socialist Realism, another style of realism which was the &quot;official art&quot; advocated by the governments of the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries, the two had several differences. While social realism is a broader type of art that realistically depicts subjects of social concern, Socialist realism is characterized by the glorified depiction of socialist values, such as the emancipation of the proletariat, in a realistic manner.

Unlike Socialist realism, social realism is not an official art produced by or under the supervision of the government. The leading characters are often &#x27;anti-heroes&#x27; rather than part of a class to be admired, as in Socialist realism. Typically, protagonists in social realism are dissatisfied with their working class lives and the world, rather than being idealised workers who are part of a Socialist utopia in the process of creation. As such, social realism allows more space for the subjectivity of the author to be displayed.

Partly, social realism developed as a reaction against Romanticism, which promoted lofty concepts such as the &quot;ineffable&quot; beauty and truth of art and music and even turned them into spiritual ideals. As such, social realism focused on the &quot;ugly realities of contemporary life and sympathized with working class people, particularly the poor.&quot; (The quotation is from George Shi, of the University of Fine Arts, Valencia).

==Features==
Kitchen sink realism involves working class settings and accents, including accents from Northern England. The films and plays often explore taboo subjects such as adultery, pre-marital sex, abortion, and crime.

==Origins of the term==
In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;kitchen sink&quot; derived from expressionist paintings by John Bratby that contained an image of a kitchen sink. Bratby did various kitchen and bathroom-themed paintings, including three paintings of toilets. Bratby&#x27;s paintings of people often depicted the faces of his subjects as desperate and unsightly. Kitchen sink realism artists painted everyday objects, such as trash cans and beer bottles. The critic David Sylvester wrote an article in 1954 about trends in recent English art, calling his article &quot;The Kitchen Sink&quot; in reference to Bratby&#x27;s picture. Sylvester argued that there was a new interest among young painters in domestic scenes, with stress on the banality of life. Other artists associated with the kitchen sink style include Derrick Greaves, Edward Middleditch and Jack Smith.

==1950s to 1960s==
Before the 1950s, the United Kingdom&#x27;s working class were often depicted stereotypically in Noël Coward&#x27;s drawing room comedies and British films. Kitchen sink realism was seen as being in opposition to the &quot;well-made play&quot;, the kind which theatre critic Kenneth Tynan once denounced as being set in &quot;Loamshire&quot;, of dramatists like Terence Rattigan. &quot;Well-made plays&quot; were a dramatic genre from nineteenth-century theatre which found its early 20th-century codification in Britain in the form of William Archer&#x27;s &quot;Play-Making: A Manual of Craftmanship&quot; (1912), and in the United States with George Pierce Baker&#x27;s &quot;Dramatic Technique&quot; (1919). Kitchen sink works were created with the intention of changing that. Their political views were initially labeled as radical, sometimes even anarchic.

John Osborne&#x27;s play &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1956) depicted young men in a way that is similar to the then-contemporary &quot;Angry Young Men&quot; movement of film and theatre directors. The &quot;angry young men&quot; were a group of mostly working and middle class British playwrights and novelists who became prominent in the 1950s. Following the success of the Osborne play, the label &quot;angry young men&quot; was later applied by British media to describe young writers who were characterised by a disillusionment with traditional British society. The hero of &quot;Look Back In Anger&quot; is a graduate, but he is working in a manual occupation. It dealt with social alienation, the claustrophobia and frustrations of a provincial life on low incomes.

The impact of this work inspired Arnold Wesker, Shelagh Delaney, and numerous others, to write plays of their own. The English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre, headed by George Devine and Theatre Workshop organised by Joan Littlewood were particularly prominent in bringing these plays to public attention. Critic John Heilpern wrote that &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; expressed such &quot;immensity of feeling and class hatred&quot; that it altered the course of English theatre. The term &quot;Angry theatre&quot; was coined by critic John Russell Taylor.

This was all part of the British New Wave—a transposition of the concurrent &quot;nouvelle vague&quot; film movement in France, some of whose works, such as &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; of 1959, also emphasised the lives of the urban proletariat. British filmmakers such as Tony Richardson and Lindsay Anderson (see also Free Cinema) channelled their vitriolic anger into film making. Confrontational films such as &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; (1960) and &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; (1961) were noteworthy movies in the genre. &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; is about a young machinist who spends his wages at weekends on drinking and having a good time, until his affair with a married woman leads to her getting pregnant and him being beaten by her husband&#x27;s cousins to the point of hospitalisation. &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; is about a 16-year old schoolgirl with an abusive, alcoholic mother. The schoolgirl starts a relationship with a black sailor and gets pregnant. After the sailor leaves on his ship, Jo moves in with a homosexual acquaintance who assumes the role of surrogate father. &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; raises the issues of class, race, gender and sexual orientation.

Later, as many of these writers and directors diversified, kitchen sink realism was taken up by television directors who produced television plays. The single play was then a staple of the medium, and &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; (1956–68), produced by the ITV contractor ABC, &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; (1964–70) and &quot;Play for Today&quot; (1970–84), both BBC series, contained many works of this kind. Jeremy Sandford&#x27;s television play &quot;Cathy Come Home&quot; (1966, directed by Ken Loach for &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; slot) for instance, addressed the issue of homelessness.

Kitchen sink realism was used in the novels of Stan Barstow, John Braine, Alan Sillitoe and others.

==Since the 1960s==
The influence of kitchen sink realism has continued in the work of other more recent British directors such as Ken Loach (whose first directorial roles were in late 1960s kitchen sink dramas) and Mike Leigh. Other directors to continue working within the spirit of kitchen sink realism include Shane Meadows, Andrea Arnold, Clio Barnard, and Lynne Ramsay. The term &quot;neo kitchen sink&quot; has been used for films such as Leigh&#x27;s 2004 &quot;Vera Drake&quot;.

<doc id="1190566" wikidata="Q2734905" url="?curid=1190566" title="Toa Payoh">
<text>Toa Payoh ( or , , ) is a planning area and mature residential town located in the northern part of the Central Region of Singapore. Toa Payoh planning area borders Bishan and Serangoon to the north, the Central Water Catchment to the northwest, Kallang to the south, Geylang to the southeast, Novena to the west and Hougang to the east. Toa Payoh New Town is situated in the western portion of the Toa Payoh planning area. The latter occupies a much larger area, encompassing estates such as Potong Pasir and Bidadari. 

Toa Payoh planning area consists of 12 subzones: Bidadari, Boon Teck, Braddell, Joo Seng, Kim Keat, Lorong 8 Toa Payoh, Pei Chun, Potong Pasir, Sennett, Toa Payoh Central, Toa Payoh West and Woodleigh. 

==Etymology==
Toa Payoh, in Hokkien, translates as &quot;big swamp&quot; (with &quot;toa&quot; meaning &quot;big&quot; and &quot;payoh&quot; meaning &quot;swamp&quot;). The Malay word for swamp is &quot;paya&quot;. It is the Chinese equivalent of Paya Lebar, which translates to &quot;big swamp land&quot;.

Toa Payoh&#x27;s old Chinese name, was known as &quot;Ang Chiang San&quot; (alternatively &quot;An Xiang Shan&quot;) or &quot;burial hill&quot;. The area was called as such because of the presence of an old cemetery located in the area.

John Turnbull Thomson, a government surveyor, refers to Toa Payoh in his 1849 agricultural report as &quot;Toah Pyoh Lye&quot; and &quot;Toah Pyoh&quot;.

Unique to housing estates in Singapore, roads in Toa Payoh are given Malay-language street prefixes, (e.g. &quot;&quot;Jalan Toa Payoh&quot;, &quot;Lorong Satu Toa Payoh&quot;&quot;) as when the town was conceived, Singapore was a state of Malaysia.

==History==
Toa Payoh was once an extensive and notorious squatter district. Most squatters were engaged in farming and rearing pigs. The others were hawkers, factory workers, mechanics or domestic helpers.

The squatters started moving out in 1962 as a result of increased compensation rates and other practical inducements offered by the Government. Clearance work was able to commence and the redevelopment started in early 1964.

Toa Payoh New Town is Singapore&#x27;s second oldest satellite town and the first to be built by the Housing and Development Board after the development of Queenstown by the Singapore Improvement Trust in the late 1950s. Before its time as a residential town, Toa Payoh was a squatter district, with a prominent agricultural heritage in the area.

Throughout the 1960s up till the beginning of the 1980s, the town, much like Geylang today, was infamous for its vice, being home to some of Singapore&#x27;s largest crime syndicates and gangs. Notable cases such as the horrific Toa Payoh ritual murders of 1981, in which people were murdered and stuffed into barrels, brought the town widespread attention. As such, Toa Payoh has also been coined by the media as the &quot;Chicago of the East&quot; and the &quot;Chicago of Singapore&quot;.

British Queen Elizabeth II visited the area in the years 1972 (Block 53, Toa Payoh) and 2006 (Block 7, Toa Payoh).

==Infrastructure==
The layout of the new town follows urban planning principles of the time. The housing estate is self-contained and has a town centre acting as a focal point for the shopping and entertainment needs of the residents.

Industrial developments were also built within the town to provide residents with job opportunities close to home while schools were built within the neighbourhoods.

===Toa Payoh Central===
The town centre was the first prototype in Singapore. It is surrounded by separated neighbourhoods, each with its own shopping amenities and community centres, well served by a network of vehicular roads and generous open space separating them. The result, as in the English new towns of the 1950s, is that residents tend less to travel to the main town centre but rather to shop within their neighbourhood; if they travel, they would go to the city via the MRT system, at the Toa Payoh and Braddell MRT stations, or public bus services at Toa Payoh Bus Interchange.

Nevertheless, with time, the Toa Payoh Town Centre has become increasingly popular. It has a busy atmosphere because, as with many shopping malls of the time, all commercial activities are concentrated along a single mall with high point blocks on either side and major department stores at each end. The shopping mall is actually L-shaped and there are two plazas, one with a branch library and cinema, the other with an area office and a post office. Each plaza has a department store at either end.

The commercial development, HDB Hub, located at the Toa Payoh Town Centre was completed in 2002. The Housing and Development Board relocated its headquarters from its premises at Bukit Merah to the HDB Hub on 10 June 2002. The HDB Hub comprises two wings, an atrium, four commercial building blocks, a leisure and learning centre and a three-storey basement parking lot. The building also accommodates Singapore&#x27;s first fully air-conditioned Toa Payoh Bus Interchange and integrates it with the existing Toa Payoh MRT station.

Another landmark of Toa Payoh is the facility of Royal Philips Electronics (the Dutch multinational making medical and electronics equipment). Philips established an extensive facility, parts of which are now owned by Jabil and NXP. The facility has been used by Philips for developing, amongst others, televisions and DVD players for years.

An interesting landmark in Toa Payoh Central is a small tree shrine known as Ci Ern Ge Temple. This shrine goes back to the kampong days before the town was set up. It is currently managed by Toa Payoh Central Merchants’ Association (TPCMA).

===Toa Payoh Town Park===
The Housing and Development Board decided to allocate a large area of Toa Payoh for a garden-landscaped park, the Toa Payoh Town Garden, despite the pressure on land here for housing.

The town garden used to be popular with visitors who came from near and far to enjoy the display of willows, bamboos and the brilliant reds and yellows of the &quot;Delonix regia&quot; trees. At the heart of the garden is a 0.8 ha carp pond which contains a waterfall and a cluster of islands linked by bridges. The islands are arranged to provide a sequence of delightful walking experiences not only by day but also by night when the garden is lit. The garden is buffered from the noise and night-time glare of passing traffic along Jalan Toa Payoh by an elevated slope planted with thick rows of Angsanas. There are also a children&#x27;s playground, seating areas and outdoor chessboard, a tea kiosk and a 27-metre high viewing tower.

Toa Payoh Town Park was partially closed in 1999 to make way for a temporary bus interchange. After the new Toa Payoh Bus Interchange at the HDB Hub was completed in June 2002, the temporary bus interchange was converted to a landscaped park. Toa Payoh Town Garden was subsequently renamed as Toa Payoh Town Park.

===Toa Payoh Sensory Park===
Located along Lorong 5 Toa Payoh, the Toa Payoh Sensory Park covers an area of . Designed to engage visitors&#x27; senses, the park is divided into five zones based on the five senses. Designed by Surbana International and Yoshisuke Miyake, and inspired by similar parks in Japan, the park was first announced in December 2007, and was completed in October 2009 at a cost of .

==Sports and recreation==
The sporting facilities are based in the southern central part of Toa Payoh, which is located near the town centre. It includes the 3,500-seat Toa Payoh Stadium, where Singapore Premier League club Balestier Khalsa FC plays its home games. Toa Payoh Sports Hall is located besides the stadium, as well as the Singapore Table Tennis Association Academy. Meanwhile, there is also Toa Payoh Swimming Complex, where national swimming athletes train.

Besides these facilities located in the centre of the town, there are also street football courts, gym facilities and basketball courts available at various neighbourhoods of Toa Payoh. Meanwhile, SAFRA clubhouse is located besides Toa Payoh Stadium.

==Politics==
Toa Payoh is entirely located within the Bishan-Toa Payoh Group Representation Constituency, while a portion of Lorong 8 Toa Payoh was in the Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency prior to 2020. The section which is part of Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC is divided into three divisions — Toa Payoh Central, Toa Payoh East and Toa Payoh West-Thomson. The members of parliament are Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, Saktiandi Supaat and Chee Hong Tat of the People&#x27;s Action Party, the ruling party of Singapore.

<text>A pocket park (also known as a parkette, mini-park, vest-pocket park or vesty park) is a small park accessible to the general public. While the locations, elements, and uses of pocket parks vary considerably, the common defining characteristic of a pocket park is its small size. Typically, a pocket park occupies one to three municipal lots and is smaller than in size.

Pocket parks can be urban, suburban or rural, but they customarily appear in densely urbanized areas, where land is very expensive and space for the development of larger urban parks is limited. They are frequently created on small, irregular pieces of public or private land, such as in vacant building lots, in brownfields, beside railways, beneath utility lines, or in parking spots.

Pocket parks can create new public spaces without the need for large-scale redevelopment. In inner-city areas, pocket parks are often part of urban regeneration efforts by transforming underutilized or blighted spaces into vibrant community assets. They may also be created as a component of the public space requirement of large building projects.

Pocket parks can serve as focal points of activity and interest in urban areas. Common elements of pocket parks include benches, tables, fountains, playgrounds, monuments, historic markers, art installations, barbecue pits, flower beds, community gardens, or basketball courts. Although they are often too small for many space-intensive physical activities, pocket parks provide communities with greenery, a place to sit and rest, and an ecological foothold for urban wildlife.

== History ==

The first pocket parks appeared in Europe in the aftermath of World War II. As cities began to recover from the large-scale physical damage incurred by warfare, such as from bombings, limitations in capital, labor, and building materials necessitated cheap, easy, and minimalistic solutions to restore urban landscapes. These constraints promoted the conversion of heavily damaged sites into small public parks which echoed the neighborhood&#x27;s original peacetime identities.

By the 1950s, the first pocket parks appeared in the United States as an adaptation of these small European parks. Inspired by this readaptation of urban space, landscape architect and professor Karl Linn proposed the transformation of vacant lots in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. into neighborhood commons. These small urban spaces served as low-cost interventions to improve the quantity and quality of community gathering spaces and recreational facilities in dense urban areas.

In 1964, Whitney North Seymour Jr. advocated for the creation of pocket parks in New York City during his tenure as president of the Park Association of New York. Congressman John Lindsay endorsed the creation of pocket parks in his 1965 campaign for New York City mayor, and Paley Park, a premier privately owned public space and prominent example of a pocket park, opened during his mayoralty in 1967.

One of the first municipal programs to fund and structure the creation of pocket parks in the United States occurred in Philadelphia. In 1967, a $320,000 urban beautification campaign encouraged community groups to identify and nominate disused parcels for development into pocket parks. Upon approval, the city provided technical knowledge and financial support to residents, who would collaborate with city officials to design, construct, and maintain the new parks. From their onset, these pocket parks were well received by municipal workers and residents. To this day, the City of Philadelphia manages over 150 neighborhood parks.

== Development and design ==

Pocket parks typically develop on small, solitary, irregularly shaped, and physically damaged lots. Because these parcels may not be conducive to commercial development, the land on which they are situated is often relatively cheap to acquire, and transforming the neglected parcel into public or green space may be the only viable opportunity for redevelopment. Thus, the placement and creation of pocket parks tends to be an opportunistic product of environmental circumstance rather than through deliberate master planning.

Due to their small size, pocket parks typically serve a hyperlocal population, and the limited opportunities for park form and function are closely tied to these local community needs. For example, a pocket park in a business district may prioritize tables and seating for employees to take a lunch break, while a pocket park in a residential area may prioritize a structure for children to play on.

Consequently, the development of pocket parks generally entails extensive public participation and collaboration between community members, landscape architects, municipal officials, and local institutions such as businesses or schools. Through this community organization, the development of pocket parks promotes grassroots planning and strengthens relationships between residents and local authorities.

Unlike larger parks, pocket parks are sometimes designed to be fenced and locked when not in use.

== Community impact ==

Despite their small footprint, pocket parks can dramatically enhance the quality of life of their surrounding communities.

Pocket parks prevent overdevelopment in dense neighborhoods and vary the form of the built environment with islands of shade, quiet, and privacy, which may otherwise be difficult to find in urban areas. Well-maintained pocket parks can deter visual signs of urban neglect by discouraging the vandalism which occurs in otherwise abandoned lots. The beautification efforts of pocket parks can increase a neighborhood&#x27;s aesthetic appeal and shape a distinct, positive visual identity for a city as a whole.

The creation of pocket parks encourages public participation and residential collaboration towards a meaningful long-term improvement to the community. In turn, this community participation can foster community pride and empower residents to tackle additional neighborhood improvement projects.

Unlike a singular large scale urban park, numerous pocket parks can be distributed throughout a single neighborhood, and multiple pocket parks can be spaced close together. This distribution increases the usefulness and accessibility of green urban spaces by decreasing the distance and time between parks and their users, especially for users who have difficulty travelling long distances, such as children, the elderly, or individuals with mobility impairments. This close proximity can also generate strong personal attachments and positive associations of place identity, especially among children who grow up in neighborhoods containing pocket parks.

These positive impacts are magnified in neighborhoods with low-income or racial minority populations, where green space may be scarce and the new development of larger-scale parks may be infeasible due to spatial or financial constraints. These benefits also particularly improve the quality of urban life for women, who are more likely to use pocket parks than men.

=== Economic impact ===
One study conducted in Greenville, South Carolina, found that &quot;attractively maintained small and medium parks have a positive influence on neighboring property values.&quot; Despite this potential to inflate local housing costs, pocket parks are less likely to contribute to environmental gentrification than larger urban parks.

=== Ecological impact ===
Patches of green landscaping and permeable surfaces within pocket parks can mitigate the urban heat island effect, aid in stormwater management, and help control microclimates. This greenery can also attract and harbor urban wildlife, especially birds. However, pocket parks are typically designed for human use and therefore may only provide limited ecological benefits to non-human species.

The establishment of local pocket parks can reduce the stress upon larger urban parks, such as by eliminating overcrowding. The use of local pocket parks instead of more distant large urban parks reduces the traffic, pollution, and energy consumption associated with automobile travel and can allow larger parks to dedicate more space to uses beyond what a pocket park can offer, such as for large-scale natural habitats.

=== Public health and safety impact ===
Pocket parks can deter the accumulation of unsanitary and potentially biohazardous waste, promoting positive externalities on public health.

A study in Los Angeles concluded that pocket parks were more effective than larger existing parks and playgrounds at promoting moderate to vigorous physical activity in low-income neighborhoods. This is likely due to increased pedestrianism, for the short distance between user&#x27;s homes and pocket parks encourages users to walk to access outdoor public spaces.

The creation of pocket parks can improve resident perceptions of public safety. One study from the University of Pennsylvania concluded that converting vacant lots into pocket parks reduces crime rates. In Los Angeles, where there are restrictions on how close registered sex offenders can live to parks, local officials planned three pocket parks to drive &quot;undesirables&quot; from a given area.

==Around the world==

=== Chile ===
In Santiago, Chile, the first pocket park (&quot;plaza de bolsillo&quot;) was created beside of Palacio La Moneda at Morandé Street. It was an initiative of Architecture Department of the Ministry of Public Infrastructure and Regional Government of Santiago.

===Mexico===

In Mexico City, there is a city program to facilitate the creation of up to 150 pocket parks of 400m2 or less on vacant lots and former road intersections, such as Jardín Edith Sánchez Ramírez and Condesa pocket park.

=== Poland ===
In Krakow, the Municipal Green Areas Management Board launched a 2018 initiative to improve the quality of public space and the quantity of green space by creating eighteen new pocket parks, which were modeled after the successes of New York City&#x27;s Paley Park and Philadelphia&#x27;s John F. Collins Park.

===United Kingdom===
In England, a 1984 project to involve the local community in the creation and running of small, local parks has fostered several pocket parks in Northamptonshire, and was later developed by the Countryside Commission into the Millennium Green and Doorstep Green projects.

<text>In physics, critical opalescence refers to the dramatic increase in scattering of light in the region of a continuous, or second-order, phase transition. Near the critical point, the properties of the liquid and gas phases become indistinguishable. The resulting density fluctuations are on such a large scale that they scatter visible light, giving the substance a cloudy or opalescent look. This phenomenon is an indicator of critical phenomena in fluids and can be observed in various materials under the right conditions.

== History ==
Originally reported by French physicist Charles Cagniard de la Tour in 1823 in mixtures of alcohol and water, its importance was recognised by Irish chemist Thomas Andrews in 1869 following his experiments on the liquid-gas transition in carbon dioxide; many other examples have been discovered since. In 1908 the Polish physicist Marian Smoluchowski became the first to ascribe the phenomenon of critical opalescence to large density fluctuations. In 1910 Albert Einstein showed that the link between critical opalescence and Rayleigh scattering is quantitative.

== Examples ==

=== Binary fluid mixtures ===
The phenomenon is most commonly demonstrated in binary fluid mixtures, such as methanol and cyclohexane. As the critical point is approached, the sizes of the gas and liquid region begin to fluctuate over increasingly large length scales (the correlation length of the liquid diverges). As the density fluctuations become of a size comparable to the wavelength of light, the light is scattered and causes the normally transparent liquid to appear cloudy. Tellingly, the opalescence does not diminish as one gets closer to the critical point, where the largest fluctuations can reach even centimetre proportions, confirming the physical relevance of smaller fluctuations.

Approaching the critical point from the opposite direction, in case of liquid-gas transition, the gas phase may contain drops of liquid as mist and spray, and the boiling liquid phase bubbles of gas phase as foam. Far from the critical point the gravity causes liquid drops and gas bubbles to rapidly settle towards the interface and surface tension causes drops and bubbles to rapidly merge to larger ones, which settle even faster. But as critical point is approached, the density difference between liquid and vapour diminishes and so does the surface tension. These effects will slow down settling of drops and bubbles and their merger, such that boiling liquid forms increasingly refractory to settling and fine mist and foam around the interface.

In case of liquid-liquid critical point, again the liquids of limited solubility precipitate out as emulsions which far from critical point on the immiscible side readily settle to interface. As critical point is approached, density difference decreases along with the interfacial surface tension, so that precipitation takes place as increasingly fine and refractory to settling emulsion.

Since liquid-gas critical point occurs at pressures over 30 bar for all substances except some cryogenic gases, demonstrating it requires a transparent vessel safe under over 30 bar, while liquid-liquid critical point for many systems can be demonstrated at ambient pressure and modest temperatures.

=== Other examples ===
Ferromagnetic material has large fluctuations of magnetic domains near the Curie point. And since neutron scattering is affected by magnetic moments of atoms, this creates critical opalescence. Specifically, if a beam of neutrons is fired at a ferromagnetic material, then as it approaches the Curie point, it would start scattering the neutrons as if it is turning opaque to neutrons.

<text>George D. Gollin (born May 6, 1953) is an American physics professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Besides his work on particle physics and the International Linear Collider, he has since 2003 made numerous efforts in fighting institutions which are considered to be diploma mills, which has caused him to receive significant public attention. Gollin placed second in the 2014 Democratic primary for Illinois&#x27;s 13th congressional district.

==Areas of research and teaching==
Gollin has worked on particle physics experiments studying muon scattering (1975–1981, intended to test the ideas of &quot;Quantum Chromodynamics&quot;), neutral K meson decay parameters (1980–1993, measuring things relating to &quot;CP violation&quot;), and electron-positron annihilation (1993–2005, measuring production and decay properties of heavy quarks). His current research focuses on technical issues associated with the design and construction of the &quot;International Linear Collider&quot;, a very large electron-positron colliding beams facility intended to shed light on the origins of the masses of the fundamental particles.

His teaching has spanned the entire physics curriculum, from elementary algebra-based courses for students in the life sciences to classical electrodynamics at the graduate level.

==Other public service==
The University of Illinois is a public university and &quot;land grant school&quot;; as such, Gollin&#x27;s responsibilities include faculty public service in addition to his teaching and research obligations. Since 2003, Gollin has been documenting the practices of alleged diploma mills, which are believed to sell meaningless academic degrees without providing education or assessment to/of their customers. In this capacity, he has worked with a number of state and federal agencies, including the State of Washington Office of the Attorney General, the U.S. Dept. of Education, the U.S. Secret Service, and the Swedish National Agency for Higher Education. It was reported in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; that &quot;Alan Contreras, administrator for the Oregon Office of Degree Authorization, called the professor&#x27;s work &#x27;superb&#x27;.&quot; He has, for example, assisted with the federal investigation of the operation of an alleged diploma mill, Saint Regis University. This investigation resulted in closing down the large operation and the conviction on federal criminal charges of eight individuals who were involved.

In 2006 he was elected to the board of directors of the Council for Higher Education Accreditation for a three-year term. He was reelected to a second term in 2009. Also in 2009 Gollin was named a Guggenheim Fellow by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. George Gollin said of the fellowship, &quot;I will use the term of the Fellowship to write a book about the nine-year trajectory and spectacular immolation of St. Regis, and the resulting increase in international attention to the problem of diploma mills.&quot;

==2014 U.S. House campaign==

Gollin announced in July 2013 his intention to run for the Illinois 13th Congressional District. He faced Ann Callis and David Green in the Democratic Party primary on March 18, 2014. Gollin was endorsed by the &quot;News-Gazette&quot;, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and the &quot;State Journal-Register&quot;. According to &quot;The Hill&quot;, Gollin &quot;isn&#x27;t seen by Washington Democrats as a strong candidate.&quot;

<text>Roy Jacobsen (born 26 December 1954) is a Norwegian novelist and short-story writer. Born in Oslo, he made his publishing début in 1982 with the short-story collection &quot;Fangeliv&quot; (Prison Life), which won Tarjei Vesaas&#x27; debutantpris. He is the winner of the Norwegian Critics Prize for Literature and two of his novels have been nominated for The Nordic Council&#x27;s Literature Prize: &quot;Seierherrene&quot; (The Conquerors) in 1991 and &quot;Frost&quot; in 2004. &quot;The Burnt-Out Town of Miracles&quot; was published in Britain in 2008. Jacobsen lives in Oslo.

== Early life and authorship ==
Jacobsen grew up in a suburb of Oslo located in the Groruddalen valley. In his teens, Jacobsen was a member of the criminal &quot;Årvoll gang&quot;. At age 16 he was arrested by the police and kept in solitary confinement for 35 days. He was subsequently convicted of among other things weapons offences and theft, and given a six-month suspended sentence.

He has held a number of occupations, even after his debut as a novelist in 1982. Since 1990 he has been a full-time author. From 1979 to 1986 he lived at his mother&#x27;s homestead at Solfjellsjøen in Dønna Municipality in the northern Norwegian county of Nordland, and both the background of his mother as well as his upbringing in Groruddalen were central themes of his breakthrough novel &quot;Seierherrene&quot; from 1991.

He is a member of the Norwegian Academy for Language and Literature.

<doc id="1190586" wikidata="Q321631" url="?curid=1190586" title="Robert Morton (composer)">
<text>Robert Morton (also &quot;Mourton&quot;, &quot;Moriton&quot;; c. 1430 – after 13 March 1479) was an English composer of the early Renaissance, mostly active at the Burgundian court. He was highly regarded at the time. Only secular vocal music, all rondeaux for three voices, survive.

==Life==
Little can be reconstructed with certainty about his life except where his activity intersects with the Burgundian court. He was born in England, but no details of his early life are known. From 1457 until 1476 he was a &quot;clerc&quot; or &quot;chappellain&quot; in the chapel choir, and unusually he never was promoted to a higher position. By 1460 he was a priest, since he was given that title &quot;Messire&quot; in chapel documents.

The long relatively peaceful period at the court under Philip the Good&#x27;s reign ended with Philip&#x27;s death in 1467, and under his successor Charles the Bold, the musical activities of the court were seriously disrupted; many of the singers and composers, including Hayne van Ghizeghem, took part in his many futile military campaigns. Morton must have known Hayne rather well, for an anonymous piece survives which describes the virtuosic singing and playing of the two of them together at Cambrai.

Payment records for Morton end in 1476, and it was long assumed that he died then; however more recent evidence from the Vatican archive shows that he was alive as late as 1479, since he resigned a Dutch parish then.

There is a possibility, never established or fully investigated, that he may be the same Robert Morton who became Bishop of Worcester, and who died in 1497. Evidence for this connection includes the complete lack of documentation for the bishop between 1456 and 1476, when Morton was active in the Burgundian court, and the presence of Cardinal John Morton, uncle of the future bishop, in Burgundy at exactly the time when Robert disappears from the payment rolls.

==Music==
Given the almost complete elimination of 15th century music manuscripts in England, largely by Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s, it is not surprising that most of Morton&#x27;s music survives in sources from the Continent, and if he was ever active as a musician in his native land, all trace is lost. Eight pieces survive, all rondeaux. One of the most famous of them is the earliest known setting of the tune l&#x27;homme armé, which was used by many early Renaissance composers as a cantus firmus for the Mass. This piece, a quodlibet, is probably datable to May 1464; it seems to have been written as a departure gift for another court composer, Simon le Breton.

Another of his rondeaux, &quot;Le souvenir de vous me tue&quot;, was exceedingly famous, and copies of this piece were widely disseminated in Europe.

All of Morton&#x27;s surviving music is in French, not surprising since it all dates from his time in Burgundy. Melodically it is somewhat simpler than the music of his contemporaries such as Hayne or Antoine Busnois.

The music theorist and writer Johannes Tinctoris wrote glowingly of Morton, mentioning that he was &quot;world-famous&quot;. Even though much of his music must have been lost—including any sacred music—he seems to have been influential on other composers at the court of Burgundy, and several of his compositions were used as source material for masses by later composers, including Josquin des Prez.

<doc id="1190590" wikidata="Q1258295" url="?curid=1190590" title="Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo">
<text>Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo is a 1944 American war film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The screenplay by Dalton Trumbo is based on the 1943 book of the same name by Captain Ted W. Lawson. Lawson was a pilot on the historic Doolittle Raid, America&#x27;s first retaliatory air strike against Japan, four months after the December 7, 1941, Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The raid was planned, led by, and named after United States Army Air Forces Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle, who was promoted two ranks, to Brigadier General, the day after the raid.

Sam Zimbalist was the film&#x27;s producer and Mervyn LeRoy directed. The picture stars Van Johnson as Lawson; Phyllis Thaxter as his wife, Ellen; Robert Walker as Corporal David Thatcher; Robert Mitchum as Lieutenant Bob Gray; and Spencer Tracy as Lieutenant Colonel—and soon General— Jimmy Doolittle.
Tracy&#x27;s appearance in the film is more in the nature of a guest star; he receives special billing rather than his usual top billing and has considerably less screen time than star Van Johnson.

In the book, Lawson gives an eyewitness account of the intensive training, the mission, and the aftermath as experienced by his crew and by others who flew the mission on April 18, 1942. Lawson piloted &quot;The Ruptured Duck&quot;, the seventh of 16 B-25s to take off from the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Hornet&quot;. The film depicted the raid accurately and used actual wartime footage of the bombers.

==Plot==
Not long after the Pearl Harbor attack, United States Army Air Forces Lieutenant Colonel James Doolittle orders 24 North American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers—with volunteer crews—to report to Eglin Field, Florida, for a secret three-month-long mission. They arrive on March 1. Among them is the craft piloted by Ted Lawson. His crew consists of Lt. Dean Davenport, co-pilot; Lt. Charles McClure, navigator, Lt. Bob Clever, bombardier, and Corporal David Thatcher, gunner-mechanic.

Doolittle warns them: This work is top-secret. He offers them the chance to opt out, particularly if they have wives and families. Lawson&#x27;s wife, Ellen, drives to Eglin Field to join him. She is pregnant. They are very much in love, but giving up never occurs to them.

The intensive training includes learning how to take off on a runway only 500 feet long as taught by an instructor Naval Aviator from nearby Pensacola Naval Air Station. They are not told why, and those who guess keep quiet. Lawson&#x27;s plane acquires the nickname &quot;Ruptured Duck&quot; and nose art to match. One dark morning, Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle sends them off to fly cross-country at hedge-hopping height to Naval Air Station Alameda, California. The planes are immediately loaded aboard the aircraft carrier .

At last, Doolittle reveals the mission: Bomb Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, Kobe and Nagoya. The carrier will get them within 400 miles of mainland Japan. After dropping their payloads, they will continue to designated landing spots in parts of China controlled by Nationalist forces and regroup in Chungking.

The call to battle stations comes twice daily, at dawn and dusk, when the enemy &quot;pig boats&quot; (submarines) come up. When an enemy surface vessel does discover the convoy, the crews assemble to take off immediately—12 hours earlier than planned. It will be daylight over Japan and night when they reach China. Doolittle leads the raid, dropping incendiary bombs to mark key targets. The Ruptured Duck is the seventh flight. Flying low over the ocean and into Tokyo, through the smoke of burning targets, dropping their bombs as planned. Flak bursts around them, but fighters ignore them.

The Ruptured Duck continues on until running low on fuel approaching the Chinese coast. Lawson crashes in the surf while trying to land on a beach in darkness and heavy rain. With the exception of Thatcher, the entire crew is badly injured in the crash. Lawson&#x27;s left leg is laid open to the bone, and McClure&#x27;s shoulders are broken. Friendly Chinese soldiers help them, and the Americans face hardships and danger while being escorted through Japanese-held territory. In the absence of any medical supplies, the injured men endure terrible pain, and Lawson&#x27;s leg becomes infected. Delirious, he dreams of Ellen.

There is a Red Cross banner in the village of XingMing. Doctor Chung arrives with good news and bad. He will take them to his father&#x27;s hospital, some 19 miles farther. The bad news is that the Japanese have captured an American crew. Hurrying into the hills, they look back: XingMing is burning.

There is no surgeon at the elder Dr. Chung&#x27;s hospital, but Lt. Smith&#x27;s crew is on its way with Lt. &quot;Doc&quot; White, who volunteered as gunner. The Japanese approach, and the able-bodied Americans leave, except for Doc. He amputates Lawson&#x27;s leg well above the knee, using the single dose of spinal anesthesia in their possession. It wears off too soon. Lawson passes out and dreams of Ellen.

A chorus of Scouts singing &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, in Mandarin, celebrate Lawson&#x27;s first day out of bed. When the elder Dr. Chung gives Lawson an heirloom bracelet for his wife, Lawson is puzzled. He does not remember talking about her. When he totters on his crutches, he becomes distraught at the idea of Ellen seeing him without a leg. They hurry to Ch&#x27;ang Chou to rendezvous with an American plane that takes them home.

General Doolittle visits Lawson in the hospital and tells him he has work for him to do. Lawson doesn&#x27;t want to see Ellen until he obtains a prosthetic leg and learns to walk properly. Ellen arrives unannounced. Lawson forgets his missing leg and stands; he falls and Ellen rushes to him and the two embrace on the floor, overjoyed to see each other.

==Production==
There is an error in the onscreen credits, perpetuated in many sources, including the &quot;Variety&quot; review. They list Ted W. Lawson and Robert Considine as authors of both &quot;the book&quot; and a &quot;story&quot; in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine. There was no such story. Lawson was the sole author of the book &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;, and the word &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; was crossed off in the credits of the copyright cutting continuity.
The film is known for its accurate depiction of the raid and use of actual wartime footage of the bombing aircraft. The production crew worked closely with Captain Ted Lawson and other members of the raid to make the film as realistic as possible. Filming at Hurlburt Field and Peel Field near Mary Esther, Florida, and Eglin Field (the actual base where the Doolittle Raiders trained), and operational USAAF B-25C and B-25D bombers were used (closely resembling the B-25B Mitchells used in 1942). Auxiliary Field 4, Peel Field, was used for the short-distance take off practice scenes.

Dean Davenport was a technical adviser and stunt flyer for the film. He flew a B-25 bomber off a pier in Santa Monica, Calif., for a scene showing the takeoffs from the Hornet.

Although an aircraft carrier was not available, due to wartime needs (USS &quot;Hornet&quot; itself had been sunk in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on October 27, 1942 only six months after launching the raid), a mix of realistic studio sets and original newsreel footage recreated the USS &quot;Hornet&quot; scenes. Principal photography took place between February and June 1944. 

==Reception==
The film received favorable reviews. &quot;Look&quot; magazine praised it as one of the five best films of the year, and the National Board of Review ranked it as eighth-best film of the year. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reviewer called it &quot;one of the greatest war pictures ever made&quot;. Film critic and author &quot;James Agee&quot; praised it in 1944: &quot;&quot;30 Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; is in some respects the pleasantest of current surprises: a big-studio film, free of artistic pretension, it is transformed by its not very imaginative but very dogged sincerity into something forceful, simple, and thoroughly sympathetic in spite of all its big-studio, big-scale habits.&quot;

&quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; was recognized as an inspirational, patriotic film with great value as a morale builder for wartime audiences. &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1944 summed the production, &quot;our first sensational raid on Japan in April 1942 is told with magnificent integrity and dramatic eloquence.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; focused on the human elements, &quot;inspired casting ... the war becomes a highly personalized thing through the actions of these crew members...this pleasant little family.&quot;

Later reviewers have considered &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; the finest aviation film of the period. The film is now considered a &quot;classic aviation and war film.&quot; The actual Raiders considered it a worthy tribute.

===Box-office===
According to MGM records, the film made $4,297,000 in the US and Canada and $1,950,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $1,382,000.

===Awards and honors===
In the 1945 Academy Awards, the &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; team of A. Arnold Gillespie, Donald Jahraus and Warren Newcombe (photography) and Douglas Shearer (sound) won the Oscar for Best Special Effects. Robert Surtees, A.S.C. and Harold Rosson, A.S.C. were nominated in the category of Black and White Cinematography.

==In popular culture==

* &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; star Van Johnson appeared in a 1970 commercial for Post Fortified Oat Flakes breakfast cereal on a set evoking an aircraft carrier flight deck with B-25s on board. He ended with the line that the cereal would &quot;take me to Tokyo – and back!&quot;
*Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s second live album, &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Winterland&quot; (1973), and experimental rock band Pere Ubu&#x27;s 1975 debut single, &quot;30 Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;, are named after the film. 
*The film &quot;The Purple Heart&quot; (1944) is a fictionalized account of the fates of American airmen from the Doolittle raid who are placed on trial in a Japanese court. 
*The film &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; (2001) includes a fictionalized version of the raid.
*The opening scene of the film &quot;Midway&quot; (1976) uses footage from &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot; to launch the film&#x27;s plot with the Doolittle Raid.
*In the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; season 3 episode &quot;The Keys&quot;, Kramer mentions to Jerry that he is watching the film.
* The title of &quot;Thirty Minutes over Tokyo&quot;, an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, is a reference to &quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;.
*Part II of &quot;War And Remembrance&quot; uses the same footage as &quot;Midway&quot;.

<doc id="1190591" wikidata="Q6501598" url="?curid=1190591" title="Sirloin steak">
<text>In American butchery, the sirloin steak (called the &quot;rump steak&quot; in British butchery) is cut from the sirloin, the subprimal posterior to the short loin where the T-bone, porterhouse, and club steaks are cut. The sirloin is divided into several types of steak. The top sirloin is the most prized of these and is specifically marked for sale under that name. The bottom sirloin, which is less tender and much larger, is typically marked for sale simply as &quot;sirloin steak&quot;. The bottom sirloin, in turn, connects to the sirloin tip roast.

In a common British, South African, and Australian butchery, the word &quot;sirloin&quot; refers to cuts of meat from the upper middle of the animal, similar to the American short loin, while the American &quot;sirloin&quot; is called the rump. Because of this difference in terminology, in these countries, the T-bone steak is regarded as a cut of the sirloin.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;sirloin&quot; derives from the Middle English &quot;surloine&quot;, itself derived from the Old French word &quot;surloigne&quot; (variant of &quot;surlonge&quot;), that is, &quot;sur&quot; for &#x27;above&#x27; and &quot;longe&quot; for &#x27;loin&#x27;. In Modern French, the cut of meat is called &quot;aloyau&quot; or &quot;faux-filet&quot;.

A fictitious etymology explains the name as being derived from an occasion when a king of England knighted the loin of beef as &quot;Sir loin&quot;. In fact, though the pun is reported as early as 1630, and the notion of a king knighting it dates to 1655, the name predates any of the kings who are mentioned. The story at most influenced the spelling &quot;sir&quot; rather than &quot;sur&quot;.

<doc id="1190592" wikidata="Q7873424" url="?curid=1190592" title="USS Revenge (1806)">
<text>The third Revenge was a schooner in the United States Navy during the years preceding the War of 1812.

==Early service==
The Navy purchased the Baltimore-built schooner &quot;Ranger&quot; at New Orleans in December 1806. She was renamed and commissioned as &quot;Revenge&quot;. In 1807 she was ordered to the Atlantic coast under the command of Lt. Jacob Jones, joining Commodore John Rodgers&#x27; New York Flotilla, which assembled shortly after the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair to protect shipping in the vicinity of the Hampton Roads. With the passage of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s Embargo Act on 22 December 1807, the flotilla established a blockade of the US coast to prevent foreign commerce.

==Later service==
In 1809, Lt. Oliver Hazard Perry relieved Jones in command of &quot;Revenge&quot;. The passage of the Non-Intercourse Act on 1 March 1809 had removed most restrictions on foreign commerce (excepting France and Britain, which were at war with each other), and the ship widened her area of operation, cruising south to the tip of Florida and north to the coast of New England.

In April 1810, the schooner entered the Washington Navy Yard for repairs. The following July, while cruising off Charleston, South Carolina, &quot;Revenge&quot; was ordered to Amelia Island, Florida, then Spanish territory, to free an American ship, &quot;Diana&quot;, which had been seized in Spanish waters and placed under British colors. Undaunted by the presence of two British warships, Perry boarded the ship, manned her with a prize crew, and sailed away.

==Wreck==
That winter, &quot;Revenge&quot; was charting coastal waters and harbours near Newport, Rhode Island, New London, Connecticut, and Gardiners Bay, Long Island, New York. On 9 January 1811, she ran aground on a reef off of Watch Hill, Rhode Island, while attempting to navigate a hazardous stretch of water known as &#x27;The Race&#x27; in heavy fog. Cargo was unloaded onto other ships, and &quot;Revenge&quot; was pulled off the rocks. However, the tow rope parted and she began to drift, foundering, and eventually sank. The records maintained by the Department of the Navy consider her to have been abandoned.

Perry was cleared of responsibility for loss of the ship during the consequent court-martial proceedings. The court held the ship&#x27;s pilot responsible for the wreck, as he had assured Perry of his ability to navigate Block Island Sound.

==Possible discovery==

On 7 January 2011, local divers Charles Buffum and Craig Harger announced the discovery of a shipwreck that matched the location and size of the sunken &quot;Revenge&quot;, including the sighting of cannons and an anchor. They had not, as of that date, been able to recover any artifact establishing the identity of the discovered vessel.

In February 2012, the US Navy sent researchers to map the wreck, along with experts from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The Navy declined to speculate on whether the ship really was &quot;Revenge&quot;, but a representative said that if it were, the ship would be &quot;an incredibly important part of American history.&quot;

<doc id="1190593" wikidata="Q17027946" url="?curid=1190593" title="HumanLight">
<text>HumanLight is a Humanist holiday celebrated annually on December 23. HumanLight was first celebrated in 2001, and was created to provide a specifically Humanist celebration during the western world&#x27;s holiday season. The New Jersey Humanist Network founded the holiday in 2001 to aid secular people in commemorating the December holiday season without encroaching on other adjacent events—both religious ones such as Christmas and secular ones such as Solstice. The inaugural event involved only the founding organization, but is now celebrated by many secular organizations and individuals across the United States and other countries. Various organizations have recognized the holiday, including the American Humanist Association in 2004. The HumanLight Committee maintains the official HumanLight webpage and engages with humanist organizations and the media about the holiday.

HumanLight is a secular holiday that focuses on the &quot;positive, secular human values of reason, compassion, humanity and hope&quot;. While there are no universally accepted ways to commemorate the holiday, modern celebrations typically involve a communal meal among a family or group. The use of candles to symbolize reason, hope, compassion, and humanity has become widespread among those celebrating. Groups today also observe the holiday using charity work, gift exchanges, and other ideas associated with holidays and celebrations.

==Etymology and meaning==
The name HumanLight comes from a non-supernatural emphasis on humanity with &quot;Light&quot; pointing to human reason. The event is designed to celebrate the &quot;positive human values of reason, compassion, humanity and hope&quot;.

==Origins and history==
HumanLight&#x27;s origins stem from members of the New Jersey Humanist Network asking in the late 1990s how secular people could best participate in the December holiday season. The inaugural event occurred at the Verona Park Boathouse in Verona, New Jersey on December 23, 2001, and was attended by nearly 100 people, including prominent Humanist Paul Kurtz.

Celebration of the holiday has expanded since its inaugural event. By 2010, there were at least thirty known public celebrations, and multiple secular organizations—including the American Humanist Association—had endorsed the holiday. The ceremonies themselves have also evolved. The first event involved a meal among its participants, along with artistic performances and other activities. Over the years, additional traditions have been added.

The December 23 date allows HumanLight to connect itself to the December holiday season without interfering with other winter holidays which many Humanists may also celebrate, such as Christmas. This was by design, as Patrick Colucci of the HumanLight Committee has stated that &quot;We&#x27;re not out to take Christmas away from anyone who wants to celebrate it.&quot;

==Symbols==

The HumanLight symbol was designed by a volunteer artist; the initial symbol appeared with a single figure, but was adjusted to include three figures in 2009 to reflect the &quot;community nature&quot; of the holiday. The current symbol &quot;depicts the light of the sun, and human figures celebrating with arms outstretched. The font characters composing HumanLight are of a festive, decorative nature.&quot;

There are no universal traditions, but over time the use of candles has become significant. Candles and decorations have at times used the colors blue, red, and yellow/gold, to represent both the colors of the HumanLight symbol as well as reason, compassion, and hope. There are no set colors for candle-lighting ceremonies, and both three and four candle ceremonies have been seen, with a fourth candle representing humanity.

==Observance==
Although the first HumanLight celebration was with a large group at a public location, HumanLight is also celebrated as families or individuals, and can be in public or private venues, such as homes. There are no firm requirements for HumanLight celebrations. Even the date of celebration is flexible. For example, although HumanLight Day is December 23, if that date in a particular year falls on a weekday, organizers can schedule the celebration on the previous weekend, if needed.

Although there are no requirements, there are a wide variety of possible themes and events to include in a HumanLight ceremony or celebration. These include &quot;science book exchanges,&quot; music, and children&#x27;s activities, among others. Charitable works and donations are also common parts of HumanLight celebrations. Private events at home tend to involve more disparate activities, but frequently involve a meal with family and friends. The HumanLight Committee recommends keeping three principles central in any event: (1) promoting the positive values of Humanism, (2) avoiding negative messages related to religions, and (3) keeping it family and children-friendly.

<text>Hide and Seek is a 2005 American psychological thriller film starring Robert De Niro and Dakota Fanning. It was directed by John Polson. Albert Hughes was initially set to direct, making his debut as a solo director, but left due to creative differences.

The film opened in the United States on January 28, 2005, and grossed $127 million worldwide. Rotten Tomatoes cited praise for De Niro and Fanning for their performances, though its consensus called the film &quot;derivative, illogical and somewhat silly&quot;. Fanning received an MTV Movie Award for Best Frightened Performance in 2005.

==Plot==
Following his discovery of the body of his wife Alison in a bathtub after her apparent suicide, Dr. David Callaway, a psychologist, decides to move with his 9-year-old daughter Emily to upstate New York. There, Emily makes an imaginary friend she calls &quot;Charlie&quot;. Her friendship with Charlie begins to disturb David when he discovers their cat dead in the bathtub, who Emily claims was a victim of &quot;Charlie&quot;. David has nightmares of the New Year&#x27;s Eve party that occurred the night before Alison&#x27;s death.

When a family friend, Dr. Katherine Carson, comes to visit David, Emily reveals that she and Charlie have a shared desire to upset her father. David meets Elizabeth Young, a local woman, and her niece, Amy, who is the same age as Emily. Hoping to cultivate a healthy friendship for Emily, David sets up a play date. Amy is eager to become friends and gives one of her dolls to Emily but the play date is spoiled when Emily cuts up Amy&#x27;s doll&#x27;s face. Emily tells David she doesn&#x27;t need any friends.

David invites Elizabeth over to dinner one night, where Emily acts hostile toward her. Elizabeth later tries to make peace with Emily. When Emily tells her that she is playing hide-and-seek with Charlie, Elizabeth indulges her by pretending to look for Charlie. When she opens the closet, someone bursts out and pushes her out the window to her death.

David asks Emily what happened. Emily claims Charlie killed Elizabeth and forced Emily to help him move the body. She tells David the location of the body. David discovers Elizabeth in the bathtub full of blood (similar to how Alison died). Armed with a knife, he goes outside, where he meets their neighbor and assumes that his neighbor is Charlie. He cuts the neighbor and the neighbor calls the police.

Back in the house, David finds that, although he has been in his study many times, the boxes were actually never unpacked after the move. He realizes that he has dissociative identity disorder and Charlie is not imaginary at all: &quot;Charlie&quot; is David himself. Whenever &quot;Charlie&quot; would emerge, David would be in his study. He also finally recalls the New Year&#x27;s Eve party the night before his wife&#x27;s death. He had caught Alison making out with another guest. &quot;Charlie&quot; was created as a way to express David&#x27;s rage so that he could murder his wife, something the docile David was too decent to do. Emily knew the entire time about her father&#x27;s split personality but did not tell him because she was unsure which personality murdered her mother until &quot;Charlie&quot; killed Elizabeth.

Once David realizes the truth, he becomes completely consumed by Charlie, leading him to murder the local sheriff, who arrives to investigate the neighbor. Emily calls Katherine for help, tricks Charlie, and escapes into the cave where she originally met Charlie. Katherine takes the gun from the dead sheriff and finds Charlie in the cave. He pretends to be David and attacks Katherine. Katherine begs for David to fight his murderous other personality. Charlie says David no longer exists. Emily emerges, begging Charlie to let Katherine go. Her distraction allows Katherine to shoot Charlie, killing him at last.

Later, Emily is preparing for school in her new life with Katherine. But Emily&#x27;s drawing of herself with two heads suggests that she might also have dissociative identity disorder.

==Endings==

This film has a total of five different endings, The US theatrical version had the following ending:

Preparing for school while living a new life with Katherine, Emily draws a picture of herself and Katherine, looking happy. But when the camera cuts back to Emily&#x27;s drawing, Emily has two heads suggesting she now has dissociative identity disorder. This ending is included as an alternate ending on DVDs featuring the International theatrical ending.
Another four were included on the DVD:

Happy Drawing: The same as the ending in the US theatrical version, except that the drawing Emily makes of herself has only one head, suggesting that she does not have dissociative identity disorder.

One Final Game: Emily is shown seemingly in a new apartment bedroom, and Katherine&#x27;s actions mirror that of her mother&#x27;s at the beginning of the film. She reassures her love to Emily and begins to leave the room. Emily asks Katherine to leave the door open, but Katherine insists she cannot. As the door shuts, a protected window is visible on the door. The next cut is of Katherine locking the door from the outside, revealing this assumed apartment bedroom is actually a hospital room in a children&#x27;s psychiatric ward. Emily gets out of bed and does a hide-and-seek countdown. She nears the closet, opens, and smiles at her own reflection in the mirror.

Emily&#x27;s Fate (International theatrical ending): Same as above in the psychiatric ward, but without the Hide and Seek countdown. This ending was featured in the international theatrical version.

Life with Katherine: An ending similar to that in the psychiatric ward, but in this ending Emily is not in a ward but her new home. After Katherine shuts the door, Emily gets out of bed to play Hide and Seek with her own reflection.

On the DVD, the main menu enables you to watch the film with any one of the five endings.

==Reception ==
=== Box office===
In its opening weekend in US theaters, the film grossed $21 million. The film grossed $51.1 million in the U.S. and $71.5 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $122.7 million.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 12% based on 156 reviews, and an average rating of 3.9/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Robert De Niro and especially Dakota Fanning have earned some praise for their work in &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;, but critics have called the rest of the film derivative, illogical and somewhat silly.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 35 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Paul Arendt of BBC Movies gave the film two stars out of five, commenting that &quot;Robert De Niro continues his long slide into mediocrity with yet another charmless psycho-thriller.&quot; John Monaghan of &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; gave the film a scoring of two out of four, saying, &quot;The second half gets downright silly as the country home turns into a slaughterhouse. What could have been a &quot;Sixth Sense&quot;-style intelligent thriller heads straight for the drive-in, though it&#x27;s still handled with considerable skill.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two stars out of four: &quot;There was a point in the movie when suddenly everything clicked, and the Law of Economy of Characters began to apply. That is the law that says no actor is in a movie unless his character is necessary.&quot; According to the&quot; New York Times&quot; the film was hampered by budgetary restrictions and the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot; said it was one of De Niro&#x27;s worst.

<doc id="1190598" wikidata="Q7175943" url="?curid=1190598" title="Peter Moore (serial killer)">
<text>Peter Howard Moore (born 19 September 1946) is a British serial killer who managed cinemas in Bagillt, Holyhead, Kinmel Bay and Denbigh in North Wales at the time of his arrest. He murdered four men in 1995. Due to his trademark attire of a black shirt and tie, he was dubbed the &quot;man in black&quot;.

==Crimes==
Between September and December 1995, he stabbed to death and mutilated four men &quot;for fun&quot;. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in November 1996 with a recommendation that he never be released. He also committed 39 sex attacks on men in North Wales and the Merseyside area over a 20-year period.

==Victims==
*Henry Roberts, a 56-year-old man who lived in Anglesey; stabbed to death in September 1995
*Edward Carthy, a 28-year-old man whom Moore met in a gay bar; stabbed to death in Clocaenog Forest in October 1995
*Keith Randles, a 49-year-old traffic manager; stabbed to death in November 1995 on the A5 road in Anglesey
*Anthony Davies, a 40-year-old crematorium worker; stabbed to death on Pensarn Beach, Abergele in December 1995

==Trial==
During his trial, Moore told the jury the crimes were committed by a fictitious homosexual lover he nicknamed &quot;Jason&quot; after the killer in the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; horror films. The jury found him guilty on all counts.

==Imprisonment==
During his time in Wakefield Prison, Moore befriended fellow serial killer Harold Shipman (known to acquaintances as Fred Shipman). Shipman died of suicide in his cell in January 2004.

In June 2008, Moore was told by the High Court that he would spend the rest of his life in prison. On 3 March 2011, Moore challenged the ruling in the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), with a view to having his sentence quashed and such whole life order sentences outlawed throughout Europe. On 17 January 2012, it was announced that his appeal had failed. However, on 9 July 2013, it was announced the ECHR had ruled there had to be both a possibility of release and review to be compatible with human rights.

In February 2015, the ECHR upheld the lawfulness of whole life orders, on the ground that they can be reviewed in exceptional circumstances, following a fresh challenge by murderer Arthur Hutchinson, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment for a triple murder in Sheffield more than 30 years earlier. Another legal challenge to the court by Hutchinson was rejected in January 2017. A fresh challenge by another &quot;whole life&quot; prisoner, Jamie Reynolds, who murdered a teenage girl in Shropshire in 2013, is now reportedly pending with the ECHR. By this stage, there were believed to be more than 70 prisoners in England and Wales serving whole life sentences.

==Other==

On 13 October 2011, it was falsely reported that Moore had died at Broadmoor hospital on 30 July 2011.

Moore talked to police and said that he knew the identity of Clocaenog Forest Man. It was reported that this theory was discounted due to conflicting dates.

<doc id="1190612" wikidata="Q182943" url="?curid=1190612" title="Bible John">
<text>Bible John is the moniker given to an unidentified serial killer who is believed to have murdered three young women between 1968 and 1969 in Glasgow, Scotland.

The victims of Bible John were all brunettes between the ages of 25 and 32, all of whom met their murderer at the Barrowland Ballroom, a dance hall and music venue in the city. The perpetrator has never been identified and the case remains both unsolved and one of the most extensive manhunts in Scottish criminal history. The case was the first time in Scotland in which the Crown Office authorised publication of a composite drawing of a person suspected of murder.

This unidentified serial killer became known as &quot;Bible John&quot; due to his having repeatedly quoted from the Bible and to have condemned any form of adultery while in the company of his final victim. The known movements and &quot;modus operandi&quot; of convicted serial killer and rapist Peter Tobin gave rise to speculation that he might be Bible John, after his conviction for three murders in the late 2000s, but police later eliminated him as a suspect.

==First murders==
===Patricia Docker===

On 23 February 1968, the naked body of 25-year-old auxiliary nurse Patricia Docker was discovered in the doorway of a lock-up garage in the alleyway behind 27 Carmichael Place, Battlefield, Glasgow. The location of her body was a few streets away from her home in Langside Place. Her body bore evidence of extensive blunt force trauma, particularly to the face and head. She had been strangled to death with a strong ligature, possibly a belt. Docker&#x27;s handbag, watch, clothes and jewellery (other than her wedding ring) were missing from the crime scene; her shoes were recovered at the scene. Her clothing was never found, but her handbag was later recovered from the River Cart by an underwater search unit just west of the Langside Drive bridge; underpants and some lipstick that were also believed to be Docker&#x27;s were additionally found at this location. Docker&#x27;s watch casing and bracelet were recovered from water close to the murder scene.

Extensive door-to-door inquiries in the area produced a witness who recalled possibly hearing a female twice briefly shout &quot;Let me go&quot; the previous evening. This witness stated she could not detect if the female was in distress as she heard no screams or sounds of commotion. Furthermore, the attendees of a party in a flat overlooking the alleyway also informed investigators they had seen and heard nothing unusual. Little hard evidence was discovered at the crime scene; Docker&#x27;s father identified his daughter&#x27;s body the following day.

A postmortem conducted by Gilbert Forbes at the University of Glasgow Medical School confirmed that the cause of death had been strangulation, and that Docker&#x27;s body bore no clear evidence of sexual assault. Furthermore, the stage of &quot;rigor mortis&quot; upon her body at the time of discovery indicated she had likely died several hours prior to the discovery of her body.

Docker was a married mother of one, estranged from her husband. On the night of her murder her parents had been under the impression she would spend the evening dancing at the Majestic Ballroom on Hope Street, although for unknown reasons, she is believed to have chosen to spend the majority of the evening at the Barrowland Ballroom, probably because of the &#x27;Over-25s&#x27; night which the venue hosted each Thursday. Ten days into police inquiries, a witness was found who stated he had seen Docker at the Barrowland. Police were, however, ultimately unable to find any reliable or detailed witness sightings of Docker at either the Majestic or Barrowland Ballroom that evening. When Docker failed to return home that evening, her parents assumed she had spent the night with a friend.

Investigators theorised Docker may have been killed elsewhere and her body discarded at the location of her discovery. The general gradient of Carmichael Place would have allowed a car to enter the location quietly and without the driver using the engine, and the use of a vehicle would have enabled the killer to discreetly take the missing clothing and jewellery from the crime scene without being seen.

Police believed Docker&#x27;s murder had occurred at around midnight. A sighting of a white Ford Consul 375 driving in the adjacent roads shortly before midnight was ruled out when the occupants came forward; a sighting of a woman entering a light-coloured Morris 1000 Traveller driven by a man at a bus stop on Langside Avenue at approximately 11:10 p.m. was not discounted from police inquiries, as these people were never traced.

By March, 700 of the city&#x27;s 1,300 taxi drivers had been questioned, as it was unclear how Docker had actually travelled home on the night of her murder. A few weeks into the investigation, an anonymous letter was posted from the north of England by a woman police believed may have been in Glasgow city centre on the night of Docker&#x27;s death and who may have known the identity of the killer. Details of the letter were released to the press and police publicly appealed for the woman to come forward, saying the information in the letter was &quot;vital&quot;, but she never did.

===Jemima MacDonald===
On Saturday 16 August 1969, a 31-year-old mother of three named Jemima MacDonald also opted to spend the evening dancing at the Barrowland Ballroom. MacDonald was a regular attendee of the Barrowland and, according to family custom, her sister, Margaret O&#x27;Brien, took care of her three children in her absence. As midnight approached, she was seen by several people in the company of a young, well-dressed and well-spoken man of slim build, aged between 25 and 35 and between and in height. The man had short hair variously described by witnesses as being fair, ginger, or dark brown with fair streaks.

MacDonald was seen leaving the Barrowland at approximately 12:30 a.m. on 17 August in the company of this individual, walking towards either Main Street or Landressy Street, in the general direction of her home. The last confirmed sighting of her was made by a neighbour at 12:40 a.m.; she was standing with the man at the entrance to the derelict property where her body was later discovered, and the neighbour observed she appeared to have been quite unconcerned, waving nonchalantly.

Margaret O&#x27;Brien became concerned when her sister failed to return home. Later the same day, she began hearing local rumours that young children had been seen leaving a derelict tenement building in MacKeith Street discussing a body in the premises. By Monday morning, O&#x27;Brien was so concerned that she herself, fearing the worst, walked into the old building, where she discovered her own sister&#x27;s extensively battered body lying face down, with her shoes and stockings lying beside her.

A postmortem revealed that MacDonald had been extensively beaten, particularly about the face, before she had been strangled to death, possibly with her own stockings. Her murder had occurred approximately 30 hours before the discovery of her body. Like Docker, MacDonald had been menstruating at the time of her death, although unlike Docker, MacDonald&#x27;s body was discovered fully clothed.

Investigators were unable to conclusively determine whether MacDonald had engaged in sexual activity—consensual or otherwise—prior to her murder, and although her other clothing was somewhat disrupted, the two pairs of pants she was wearing appeared to have been undisturbed.

Police inquiries into MacDonald&#x27;s movements on the night of her murder produced several eyewitnesses who were able to accurately describe the man in whose company she had been seen at the Barrowland. Door-to-door inquiries on MacKeith Street also produced a woman who remembered hearing female screams on the evening of MacDonald&#x27;s murder, but she could not recall the precise time. Consequently, police considered this information of little use to their inquiry.

==Initial investigation==
The City of Glasgow Police noted several striking similarities between the murders of Docker and MacDonald, including that both women had attended the Barrowland Ballroom on the evening of their murder, been beaten before being strangled to death with a ligature, were menstruating, and had their handbags taken from the crime scene, but initially both murders were not considered to be the work of the same perpetrator.

Despite extensive public appeals, the investigation into the murder of Docker had quickly become a cold case. Police had little information, owing to both a lack of witnesses and hard evidence. The investigation had also been severely hindered by investigators not discovering until three days after her death that Docker had attended the Barrowland on the evening of her murder. Eighteen months later, following the discovery of MacDonald, police became aware of remarkable similarities to the murder of Docker. Police did not conclusively link both murders to the same perpetrator, but they could not completely discount this theory. In addition, police were certain the perpetrator(s) held a high degree of local geographical knowledge. However, they may have been a stranger to the district, as none of the eyewitnesses investigators spoke to knew the man or men seen in the company of either woman prior to her murder.

For the first time in a Scottish murder hunt, a composite drawing of the man MacDonald had last been seen alive with was given to the press, being widely distributed via both newspapers and upon television throughout Scotland in efforts to identify the suspect. Male and female undercover police officers performed discreet surveillance at the Barrowland Ballroom in efforts to identify the suspect. Police surveillance at the Barrowland Ballroom was terminated in late October 1969 due to the initiative failing to produce any suspects. Detectives were also blamed by proprietors for a sharp decrease in attendance figures.

===Helen Puttock===
On 31 October 1969, a man walking his dog discovered the body of 29-year-old Helen Puttock behind a tenement in the Scotstoun district of Glasgow. Her body was found beside a drainpipe in the back garden of her Earl Street flat. She had been stripped partially naked, extensively beaten about the face before being raped, then strangled to death with one of her own stockings. The contents of her handbag had been scattered close to her body; the handbag itself was missing from the crime scene. Grass and weed stains upon the soles of Puttock&#x27;s feet and shoes indicated that she had engaged in a ferocious struggle with her killer. She had evidently at one point attempted to scale a nearby railway embankment. Her body also bore a deep bite mark on her wrist. As had been the case with the two previous victims, Helen had been menstruating at the time of her murder. Her murderer had placed her sanitary towel beneath her left armpit.

The evening prior to the murder, Puttock and her sister Jean Langford had been to the Barrowland Ballroom, where both had become acquainted with two men, both named John. One of them had said he worked as a slater and resided in Castlemilk, while the other had been a well-spoken man who did not disclose where he lived. After being in the company of these two men for more than an hour, all four left the Barrowland to head home. The man named John who had been Jean&#x27;s dance partner walked to George Square to board a bus, while Langford, Puttock, and the man who had been Puttock&#x27;s dance partner hailed a taxi. The trio set off from Glasgow Cross, making a 20-minute westward journey towards Langford&#x27;s Knightswood home. During the trio&#x27;s conversation in the cab, most of the crucial information pertaining to the killer&#x27;s psychological profile became apparent.

==Suspect==
The suspect was described by Puttock&#x27;s sister Jean Langford as being a tall, slim, and well-dressed young man wearing a well-cut brown &quot;Reid and Taylor&quot; brand suit, with reddish, sandy or fair hair rounded neatly at the back. His wristwatch had a military-style broad leather strap, and, unusually, he was wearing unfashionable leather half-boots. He was aged between 25 and 30, approximately to in height, and had blue-grey eyes. She noticed that two of his front top teeth overlapped, and that one of his teeth at the back right-hand side of his mouth was missing. She said that she thought he had said his surname was something like &quot;Templeton,&quot; &quot;Sempleson,&quot; or &quot;Emerson,&quot; and he had been polite and well-spoken. Langford had also observed that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t the Barrowland type&quot; as the majority of men who frequented the dance hall were somewhat rougher, and she said that he also wasn&#x27;t a particularly good dancer.

Before they left the dance hall, Langford had attempted to use an &quot;Embassy&quot; cigarette machine which had jammed and failed to dispense her purchase. This incident caused a sudden change in the suspect&#x27;s previously polite demeanour; he demanded to see the manager, with whom he argued aggressively, and asked to know who the local MP was. He then turned and infamously told the group: &quot;My father said these places are dens of iniquity. They once set fire to this place to get the insurance money and did it up with the money they got.&quot; Langford then witnessed the man show Puttock an identity card, which seemed to impress her; however, when Langford asked to see the ID herself, the man declined and said while tapping his nose: &quot;You know what happens to nosey folk.&quot;

Much of the information about the suspect came from the conversations the trio had on their 20-minute taxi ride home. The man said he disapproved of married women going to the Barrowland Ballroom, and when the women told him they were married he responded with a reference to the Bible, saying &quot;you know what happens to the adulterous wife? She gets stoned to death&quot;. He also commented to the women &quot;I don&#x27;t drink at Hogmanay; I pray&quot;, although he said that he was familiar with several drinking premises in the Yoker district of Glasgow. He said he was an only child but contradicted this soon after by saying he had a sister, adding that alcohol was not allowed in his home and that when his sister came home drunk once she was refused entry to the house. Langford was of the impression that the man regretted mentioning his sister and tried to redirect the conversation to foster homes and foster children. He revealed that he knew the fares, and possibly the times, for both the buses and the Blue Train services north of the River Clyde. As the taxi travelled along the Kingsway the man said he recognised the high-rise flats and said something about his father or another relative having worked there, and that a children&#x27;s home had once been there. Langford said that the man appeared to be evasive when asked some questions. He had a Glasgow accent.

When Langford asked the man whether he supported Rangers or Celtic, the man responded saying &quot;I&#x27;m agnostic&quot;. He made reference to, although didn&#x27;t specifically quote, the Bible. Langford also recalled his mentioning he had at one stage worked in a laboratory, that his family had a caravan in Irvine, and that although he played golf badly, his cousin had recently scored a hole in one. Even though the man seemed to say he didn&#x27;t smoke during the earlier &quot;Embassy&quot; cigarette machine incident, he then revealed his own packet of &quot;Embassy&quot; cigarettes and offered one to Puttock, although he did not offer any to Langford and took none himself. Langford stated that it had become increasingly clear to her as the trio had ridden in the taxi that this man had considered her presence in the vehicle to be an inconvenience. The man insisted that the taxi took Langford home first before Puttock, even though she lived further away.

Langford last sighted the pair being driven off in the taxi after she was dropped off at her home in Kelso Street. The taxi driver, Alexander Hannah, was later traced and provided further details of the last part of the journey, explaining that the man had been unable to pay the fare when they arrived in Earl Street (even though he had said he would pay earlier), so Puttock had given him the money to pay the taxi driver out of her purse. The taxi driver was unfamiliar with the route and made some wrong turns during the last part of the journey, causing Puttock had become frustrated and ask him to stop on Earl Street. The driver also noted that after paying the fare, the suspect had caught up with Puttock and grabbed her, causing Puttock to resist; however, Hannah had assumed the two were simply &quot;lovers having a tiff&quot;.

===Final sighting===
The last possible sighting of the suspect was made by the driver, conductor and passengers of a night service bus, who noticed a man matching the description given by Langford &quot;walking quickly ... in a determined manner&quot; along Dumbarton Road and then boarding their bus at approximately 2:00 a.m. on 31 October. He was in a particularly dishevelled state, with mud stains on his jacket and a livid red mark or scratch on his cheek just beneath one eye. These witnesses also recalled his repeatedly tucking a short cuff of one sleeve into his jacket sleeve (a man&#x27;s cufflink had been found alongside the body of Helen Puttock). He had also paid for the fare from a distinctive red purse likely belonging to Puttock, whose red purse was missing from the crime scene. The man got off the bus at the junction of Argyle Street and Derby Street/Gray street.

Contemporary police records show that investigators gave particular credence to these sightings because the physical description of this individual was markedly similar to Langford&#x27;s description of Puttock&#x27;s companion at the Barrowland. It was initially believed that the man may have used the nearby Govan ferry to cross the River Clyde to the south of the city, but the ferrymen working that night could not remember such an individual.

===Link to series===
The murder of Helen Puttock held remarkable similarities to the two previous murders, further raising suspicions that all three murders had been committed by the same person. Each of the victims had been the mother of at least one child and had met her murderer at the Barrowland Ballroom. The handbag of each woman was missing. Each victim had been strangled to death, and at least two of these women had been raped prior to their murders. Each of the three women had been escorted home by her killer and murdered within yards of her door. Additionally, all had been menstruating at the time of death and had their sanitary towel or tampon placed upon, beneath, or near their body. This led to speculation that the women had been murdered for their refusal to engage in intercourse with their murderer, due to their periods.
==Ongoing investigation==
Within hours of the discovery of the body of Helen Puttock, an additional composite drawing of the suspect was created using the detailed description provided by her sister. Langford saw the earlier image created after the murder of Jemima MacDonald and believed it was an excellent likeness. Detective Superintendent Joe Beattie asked the public to closely study this composite drawing, should it resemble anyone they knew. Due to the suspect&#x27;s hair being unfashionably short for the era, over 450 hairdressers in and around Glasgow were shown the updated drawing of the suspect, and all dentists in and around the city were asked to examine their records to determine whether they held records of a male patient with overlapping incisors and a missing tooth in the upper right jaw. Both lines of inquiry proved fruitless. The police also produced an artist&#x27;s impression portrait, created by Lennox Patterson, Registrar of the Glasgow School of Art, based on the recollections of Puttock&#x27;s sister. In June 1970, police employed the photofit system in an attempt to produce a better likeness of the suspect. This was the first instance this method of identifying a murder suspect was used in Scotland.

More than 100 detectives were assigned to work full-time on the case, and 50,000 witness statements were taken in door-to-door inquiries. Ultimately, more than 5,000 potential suspects were questioned in the first year of the inquiry alone, and Jean Langford was required to attend over 300 identity parades, but she was adamant none of those required to participate in these identity parades had been the man with whom she had last seen her sister, and all were cleared of any involvement. Fearing that the perpetrator would strike again, a team of 16 detectives was instructed to mingle with dancers at all dance halls in Glasgow. In particular, these detectives frequented the Barrowland on Thursday and Saturday nights at the over-25s events, where each victim was presumed to have met her murderer.

Despite the extensive manhunt, no further developments arose and the investigation into the three murders gradually became cold, with many officers assigned to the case believing that the perpetrator had either died, been jailed for an unrelated offence, had been incarcerated at a mental hospital, or that senior police officers had known his actual identity but had been unable to prove he had committed the murders. Others speculated that he may have simply moved away from the Glasgow district, or murdered whenever in the vicinity; this possibility prompted police to circulate multiple copies of the composite drawing at all British Army, Navy, and Air Force bases in the United Kingdom, Europe, and the Middle and Far East; this line of inquiry failed to produce any significant leads.

==Potential suspects==
===John Edgar/&quot;John White&quot;===
Les Brown, who worked on the Bible John case as a junior detective, claimed in 2005 that he had identified a likely suspect at the time but that he was dismissed simply because he did not have notably overlapping front teeth. The man had been found arguing with a young woman in the Barrowland, and Brown said that he closely resembled the facial composite of Bible John. The man subsequently supplied police with a false name and address before revealing his true name and address in the Gorbals. The man&#x27;s real name was John Edgar.

Several years later, Brown spoke at length to a detective who had taken the same man to a hospital after arresting him outside the Barrowland Ballroom at the time of the murders. The suspect had needed several stitches in his head following an altercation, and as soon as his handcuffs had been released, he escaped from the hospital. At the time of this incident, he had also falsely given his name to medical personnel as John White. In addition to this basic circumstantial evidence, the &quot;whole demeanour&quot; of the man had led Les Brown and several of his colleagues to believe he may have been the perpetrator.

After Brown wrote of his suspicions in his 2005 autobiography, the man came forward and offered to provide a DNA sample in order to clear his name. This led to his elimination as a suspect. Author Paul Harrison has also criticised the theory, pointing to how Brown contradicted himself by voicing his opinions that Peter Tobin may have been responsible.

===David Henderson===
In 1983, a Lanarkshire contractor named Harry Wyllie contacted Strathclyde Police; he claimed to conclusively know that his friend David Henderson had been Bible John, adding that both he and Henderson had been raised in the Cranhill district of Glasgow and both had frequented the Barrowland Ballroom in the 1960s. Wyllie had, he claimed, read an article in the &quot;Evening Times&quot; five years previously before suddenly realising his friend had been the perpetrator of the murders. The alleged suspect was traced living in the Netherlands, married to a Dutch woman. Subsequently, police quizzed Henderson and eliminated him as a suspect. Jean Langford also told police that Henderson did not look like the killer.

===Hannah Martin rapist===
In the years following the Bible John murders, several women came forward to claim that they had been sexually assaulted after an evening at the Barrowland. One of these women, Hannah Martin, claimed that she had been assaulted and raped by Bible John and had subsequently given birth to his child in January 1970; a daughter she initially named Isobel.

In April 1969, Martin had left the Barrowland in the company of a tall man with whom she then had sex, and then accepted his offer of a lift home. However, during the drive, the man&#x27;s sexual demeanour became more aggressive, and Martin, drunk and terrified she may be attacked, vomited in the man&#x27;s car. He then bundled her out of the car and drove off, leaving her standing on the pavement. One author, David Leslie, has claimed that Martin&#x27;s daughter could be the one indubitable link to the identity of Bible John.

===John Irvine McInnes===
In 1996, Strathclyde Police exhumed the body of John Irvine McInnes from a graveyard in Stonehouse, South Lanarkshire. McInnes, who had served in the Scots Guards, had died by suicide in 1980 at the age of 41, by severing the brachial artery in his upper arm. He was the cousin of one of the original suspects in the Bible John investigation and related to a senior police officer. However, Jean Langford had not picked him out in numerous identity parades, and she continued to insist in 1996 that McInnes was not Bible John. A DNA sample was taken from McInnes&#x27;s body for comparison with semen samples found on the stockings belonging to Helen Puttock and which had been used to strangle her.

The results of the testing conducted proved inconclusive, with then-Lord Advocate Lord Mackay stating insufficient evidence existed to link McInnes with the murder of Helen Puttock. The Crown officially cleared McInnes of any involvement in the Bible John murders in July 1996.

Strathclyde Police and the McInnes family pathologist confirmed in 2005 that further advancements in DNA testing had now enabled a match between McInnes&#x27;s DNA and the killer&#x27;s to be fully disproven.

===Peter Tobin===
Some have speculated that convicted serial killer Peter Tobin may have been Bible John. He had lived in Shettleston in Glasgow in the late 1960s; he then relocated to England in August 1969 (before the final two murders committed by Bible John) after marrying his first wife, who he had met at the Barrowland Ballroom in 1968. The amount of violence Tobin inflicted on his known victims between 1991 and 2006 and his level of organisation did not suggest the work of an amateur, leading some to believe he may have killed prior to his first known victims. However, one discrepancy is that Bible John displayed his victims&#x27; bodies in public places, whereas Tobin buried all his known victims.

Some contemporary visual similarities exist between Peter Tobin when aged in his 20s and the 1969 composite drawing of Bible John, although the composite drawing showed Bible John with red hair and contemporary pictures of Tobin show he did not have this hair colour. In addition, all three of Tobin&#x27;s former wives have given accounts of being repeatedly imprisoned, throttled, beaten, and raped by him, and each has stated he had been driven to extreme physical violence by the female menstrual cycle (a factor long suspected by investigators as being the perpetrator&#x27;s motive behind the murders). In addition, Tobin is known to have been a staunch Roman Catholic with strong religious views, and the alias Bible John may have given to Jean Langford and Helen Puttock in 1969 is similar to one of the pseudonyms known to have been regularly used by Tobin: John Semple.

Criminologist David Wilson strongly believes the available evidence supports his theory that Tobin is Bible John; others have criticised his theory. He has stated that the moment he believed Tobin was Bible John occurred during Tobin&#x27;s trial for the 1991 murder of 18-year-old Dinah McNicol, in which a witness&#x27;s trial testimony of what Tobin had said in the company of herself and McNicol on the evening of McNicol&#x27;s abduction contained notable similarities to things reportedly said by Bible John. Some important points of overlap were both men mentioning they did not drink at Hogmanay and having a cousin who had once scored a hole-in-one in a golf match. This information, alongside other circumstantial evidence, led Wilson to state: &quot;I didn&#x27;t set out to prove Tobin was Bible John, but I would stake my professional reputation on it.&quot;

Operation Anagram

As a result of a police investigation named Operation Anagram, which was initiated in 2006 to trace the movements of Tobin throughout the decades and to determine his potential culpability in any other crimes, a woman informed investigators she had been raped by Tobin after she had met him at the Barrowland Ballroom in 1968, shortly after the first of the murders believed to have been committed by Bible John. However, Operation Anagram found no other evidence to support the theory that Tobin was Bible John.

Elimination as a suspect

Tobin has since been eliminated as a suspect by police. Although often reported that Tobin moved from Glasgow to Brighton after the 1969 murders, he in fact relocated from Glasgow to Brighton with his fiancée, Margaret Mountney, before the second murder attributed to Bible John. Operation Anagram discovered that Tobin was in Brighton at the time of the final two Bible John murders. He had married his first wife in Brighton on 6 August 1969, 10 days before the 16 August murder of Jemima MacDonald, as recorded on their marriage certificate. Tobin&#x27;s wife testified the pair were still on their honeymoon in Brighton at the time of the murder of the second victim, and she insists he was with her at the time. She has strongly criticised the theory that Tobin is Bible John. Tobin was in police custody regarding an unrelated crime when another of the killings occurred. He was also still living in Brighton at the time of the third murder, meaning he would have had to travel without his wife&#x27;s knowledge to Glasgow and back from Brighton to have committed the murder of Helen Puttock.

Tobin&#x27;s DNA was checked against the semen sample for Bible John as part of Operation Anagram. The results of this analysis conclusively proved the bodily fluid did not source from Tobin. Wilson has questioned the DNA evidence, but the police also have a record of the bite mark that was found on Helen Puttock&#x27;s wrist which they can cross-check with Tobin&#x27;s dental records, as had been done with John McInnes when he was exhumed and subsequently eliminated as a suspect in 1996. Tobin also had a distinctive scar under his left eye at the time, and no witnesses report Bible John as having such a scar, and Tobin was also 5 ft 6 in, much shorter than the witness accounts of Bible John. The key witness with Bible John in the taxi, Jean Langford, also insisted that Tobin was nothing like the man.

David Swindle, the senior investigating officer in charge of Operation Anagram, has stated that there is no evidence to link Tobin to the Bible John murders, and Operation Anagram eventually discounted the theory. Swindle had previously presided over the 2002 review of the Bible John murders, four years before the initial discoveries of Tobin&#x27;s murders.

In his 2010 book &quot;The Lost British Serial Killer&quot;, author David Wilson claimed that Peter Tobin was Bible John, but his co-writer for the book, Paul Harrison, later recanted on the claims they made in the book. In 2013, Harrison published a new book, instead claiming Bible John was a police officer. Harrison concluded: &quot;the obnoxious little pervert that Tobin has been proven to be is not the killer referred to as Bible John&quot;.

===Domestic violence theory===
A former crime editor for the &quot;Daily Record&quot; newspaper, Jane Hamilton, has since stated that detectives she has interviewed who had reviewed the Bible John case files in the 1980s were of the belief that two of the murders linked to Bible John were actually domestic incidents.

Patricia Docker&#x27;s estranged husband Alex had been an early suspect in her murder. The two had married in 1963, but their marriage had been an unhappy one and the issue of divorce had been raised between them more than once. The marriage further deteriorated shortly after a posting to Cyprus – where Docker is believed to have conducted at least one affair – followed by a brief move to Digby, Lincolnshire, where Alex Docker was an RAF corporal. Docker had decided to return to Glasgow with their son (b. 1964) in April 1967; she and her son lived with her parents at the time of her murder.

Alex–who claimed to have last seen Docker at her home in October 1967 when the two had met to discuss divorce—was considered by police to have had a possible motive to kill his estranged wife. He had sought a hasty divorce in order to marry his new partner, with whom he is known to have signed a hotel register on the day after Patricia&#x27;s murder as &#x27;husband and wife&#x27;. Furthermore, investigators discovered that he had also been on leave from RAF Digby in Scotland at the time of the murder. The pair were actively contemplating divorce at the time of Docker&#x27;s murder, having corresponded about the issue in early 1968.

Shortly after Docker&#x27;s murder, her husband had taken their son from his grandparents to live with him and his new partner in Lincolnshire.

Jemima MacDonald had also recently separated from her husband at the time of her murder, and had likewise moved back to Glasgow the year prior to her death. Her former husband stated in 2022 that police had considered him a suspect and that he had been repeatedly questioned regarding her murder.

Contemporary police reports indicate MacDonald had visited the Barrowland for three successive nights in the week prior to her murder, and that she was &quot;in receipt of public funds, plus maintenance from the fathers of her children&quot;. Reflecting the attitudes of the time, following MacDonald&#x27;s murder, the press devoted extensive focus on the fact MacDonald had borne three children by two different men; her two youngest with a man described as a &#x27;West Indian&#x27;, and her eldest with a man described only as a Yugoslav national she had reportedly met in Liverpool.

Helen Puttock&#x27;s husband, George, was conclusively eliminated as a suspect in his wife&#x27;s murder in 1996 after his DNA was tested against the semen samples discovered upon his wife&#x27;s stockings and was found not to match. Castings of his teeth were also found not to match the bite mark the killer had left upon her wrist.

==Aftermath==
No further murder victims killed in Scotland or elsewhere in the United Kingdom have ever been conclusively attributed to Bible John, and the manhunt for this murderer was one of the most extensive manhunts in Scottish criminal history. The murders of the three women remain unsolved, but the case remains open, with many investigators remaining certain that the perpetrator(s) of these crimes were highly likely to have been shielded by one or more individuals he or they had known.

No uniform consensus exists that the three killings were actually the work of the same person. It has been claimed that the gap of 18 months between the first two killings is unusual for a serial killer, and that the later two murders may have either been copycat killings, or the sole two committed by the same perpetrator. Criticism has also been levelled against the police for potentially hampering their own investigation by prematurely jumping to the conclusion that all three murders had been committed by the same person.

In 2004, police announced their intentions to genetically test several men in a further attempt to identify the perpetrator, with all concerned being requested to submit blood samples. This followed the previous discovery of an 80% genetic match from the semen samples retrieved from the final crime scene attributed to Bible John with a DNA sample retrieved at the site of a minor crime committed two years earlier. The sample was enough of a match to lead officers to believe that the person who committed the offence was related to the killer.

The sole witness ever to have engaged in a lengthy conversation with Bible John, Jean Langford, died in September 2010 at the age of 74. Langford had given police the description used to form the second composite drawing created of the suspect, which remains the most significant clue as to the perpetrator&#x27;s physical appearance. Despite Professor Wilson&#x27;s assertion that Peter Tobin may have been Bible John, when Jean Langford discussed her sister&#x27;s murderer many decades later, she dismissed this theory, stating emphatically that Tobin had not been the man she had shared a taxi with on the night of her sister&#x27;s murder.

<doc id="1190615" wikidata="Q6562298" url="?curid=1190615" title="List of Arrested Development characters">
<text>&quot;Arrested Development&quot; is an American television sitcom that originally aired on Fox from November 2, 2003 to February 10, 2006. A fourth season of 15 episodes was released on Netflix on May 26, 2013, and a fifth season was released in two parts on May 29, 2018 and March 15, 2019. Created by Mitchell Hurwitz, the show centers the Bluth family. The Bluths are formerly wealthy and a habitually dysfunctional family. It is presented in a continuous format, and incorporates hand-held camera work, narration, archival photos, and historical footage. The series stars Jason Bateman, Portia de Rossi, Will Arnett, Michael Cera, Alia Shawkat, Tony Hale, David Cross, Jeffrey Tambor, and Jessica Walter. In addition, Ron Howard serves as the series narrator and an executive producer on the show.

The main characters of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; can be divided into the Bluth ( ) and Fünke ( ) families.

==Bluth family tree==



==Cast table==


==Primary characters==

===Michael Bluth===

Michael Bluth (played by Jason Bateman) is the second oldest Bluth son and the main protagonist of &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. He is the father of George Michael Bluth and widower to Tracey Bluth. In season 3, it is revealed that there is a typo on his birth certificate, which reads &quot;Nichael Bluth&quot;. Michael&#x27;s wife Tracey died of ovarian cancer two years prior to the first season. Possibly as a result of this, he is very close to his son, George Michael, which is shown partly because, whenever an opportunity to spend more time with his son presents itself to him, he will jump at it (although this time is almost always immediately interrupted). Michael is often reluctant to date, thinking that his son would disapprove, and most of his relationships have featured misunderstandings or outright deception. His wife&#x27;s death is usually the subject of tasteless and unaware jokes made by his family members. His role in the story is that he is the one son who has no choice but to keep the family together, and he serves as the straight man in the comedy series. Throughout the original run of the show, Michael is consistently the &quot;de facto&quot; president of the Bluth Company after his father&#x27;s arrest. He is the only main character who appears in every episode of season 4, making him the only character to appear in every episode of the series.

===Lindsay Bluth-Fünke ===
Lindsay Bluth-Fünke (Portia de Rossi) is the adopted daughter of George Sr. and Lucille Bluth, as well as half-sister of Lucille, who raised her and Michael to believe that they were twins. She is unhappily married to Tobias and together they are the neglectful and self-absorbed parents of Maeby.

Lindsay never finished college, believing herself to be a dedicated activist, though she is actually vain, greedy, selfish, and materialistic (much like the rest of her family), mainly supporting current trendy causes for the social status and regularly holding extravagant charity drives that waste more money than they make. These causes have included opposing circumcision, anti-Iraq War protests, the removal of the 10 Commandments from a courthouse, the right to die (specifically regarding her brother Buster), and awareness about graft-versus-host disease (which her husband was afflicted with due to unnecessary hair transplants). Despite her outward confidence, Lindsay has rather low self-esteem as a result of her mother&#x27;s constant hints and cruel jokes that she is overweight, which are untrue. Lindsay is portrayed as extremely resentful towards her sexually uninterested husband Tobias, with whom she ultimately agrees to an open marriage. During this time, Lindsay flirts and pursues relationships with many other men, with little or no success. She sometimes dates successful actors, such as Moses Taylor and Tom Jane. In season 3, Lindsay becomes interested in the family&#x27;s new lawyer Bob Loblaw.

In the last episode of season 3, it is revealed that Lindsay is not actually Michael&#x27;s twin sister, or even a Bluth at all; she was adopted by the Bluth family to &quot;stick it&quot; to the Bluth family&#x27;s rivals, the Sitwell family. Had Lindsay been adopted as the daughter of Stan Sitwell, she would have been named Nellie. She also discovers that she is 40 years old, three years older than she had previously believed herself to be. Feeling that her youthful allure has now escaped her, she becomes desperate to marry a successful man, and divulges to Michael that they are not biological siblings, hoping (with no luck) that she can seduce him.

Creator Mitchell Hurwitz came up with Lindsay as the family&#x27;s politically liberal figure, but Lindsay is also meant to represent a liberal who personally benefited from her politics more than she sacrificed, due to the image she built. This motif is continued in the series&#x27; revival and fourth season, in which Lindsay travels to India in an attempt to connect to her spiritual side and then tumultuously dates Marky Bark, another (albeit a true) liberal activist, while still married to Tobias. She later unwittingly becomes the call girl of politically conservative politician Herbert Love, eventually abandoning her long-held liberal views and finally realizing her closer affinity for conservative ones. When Love falls into a coma, Lindsay at the last minute takes up his mantle in his campaign to run for U.S. Congress.

In the show&#x27;s fifth season, Lindsay goes missing after no longer being able to tolerate her supposed mother&#x27;s controlling attitude, but reemerges in the final scene. The season&#x27;s penultimate episode reveals through a Ron Howard documentary about the Bluth family shown to the court, that Lindsay is in fact Lucille&#x27;s half sister, being the daughter of Lucille&#x27;s mother who put her up for adoption.

Having previously appeared in &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, de Rossi said that she was looking for a new series like it. De Rossi was also attracted to &quot;Arrested Development&quot; for what she thought was a &quot;fresh new perspective on comedy.&quot; She played Lindsay as someone who &quot;doesn&#x27;t have much of a clue but... has a pretty good heart.&quot; She explained her approach by saying that, &quot;with &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, we were very rehearsed and staged. But this is a lot looser.&quot; Hurwitz felt that de Rossi made the character somewhat similar to Lucille.
===Gob Bluth===

George Oscar &quot;Gob&quot; Bluth II (known by his initials &quot;G.O.B.&quot;, ; played by Will Arnett) is the oldest child of George Sr. and Lucille Bluth.

By trade a part-time magician, he is a founding member of the &quot;Magicians&#x27; Alliance&quot;, a group that was formed to preserve magicians&#x27; secrets; however, he was later blacklisted by them for revealing such a secret in the pilot episode. He is known for incorporating over-the-top theatrics into his magic shows, including pyrotechnics, dance routines, wind machines, and Europe&#x27;s &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;. Gob&#x27;s illusions (which he adamantly never calls &quot;tricks&quot;) rarely work and he often shoots lighter fluid accidentally from his shirt sleeve or collar.

George Sr. paid little attention to Gob as a child and has no respect for him as an adult; his mother Lucille openly loathes him. Gob&#x27;s desperate and unsuccessful attempts to win his father&#x27;s approval and become the Bluths&#x27; &quot;favorite&quot; son is a major theme of his character. As Michael&#x27;s older brother, Gob believes he is inherently entitled to more respect, and feels threatened and insulted by the fact that he is less successful than Michael. On several occasions, Gob and Michael realize that their rivalry has been nurtured by their father and mother&#x27;s manipulations. Gob is known to be the womanizer of the Bluth family, though he often exaggerates his romantic encounters in what he believes is an intense competition with Michael (though Michael does not reciprocate these competitive feelings). In fact, Gob loves Michael more than anyone else in his family, and constantly seeks his respect despite their one-sided rivalry. Eventually, Gob discovers that he is the father of the teenage jock Steve Holt. Toward the end of season 1, Gob, in a series of escalating dares, marries a woman who deals in trained seals (played by then-real-life wife Amy Poehler). The two immediately and permanently become estranged from each other and she later becomes infatuated with Tobias Fünke, Gob&#x27;s brother-in-law, and joins the army in the hopes of avoiding her attraction. A running joke throughout the series is that Gob never learns his wife&#x27;s name.

Any time his self-esteem is shattered or challenged, Gob will burst into tears and cry with self-loathing, or take extreme and often self-destructive measures to cease the self-disgust he feels. He recurringly ingests &quot;forget-me-now&quot; pills (i.e. roofies) in order to forget these emotionally damaging activities. When upset or excited, Gob often fails to use articles or prepositions in his sentences, saying things like &quot;Look at Banner!&quot; and &quot;Still mad me, Michael?&quot; He also sometimes has difficulty pronouncing words that begin with the letter &quot;c&quot;. Despite Gob&#x27;s &quot;womanizing&quot; abilities, he has no real friends; his closest friends are the Hot Cops, a group of gay strippers that Gob once worked with. He uses the Hot Cops in many situations, including a fake drug bust and for fake friends at a bachelor party. He desperately desires to be liked but his habits of treating people poorly and lack of any real self-awareness prevent him from ever forming bonds. He wants to be looked to for decisions but is completely unwilling to accept any responsibility and most of his family regard him as an idiot.

He is also the original creator and inspiration for the Mr. Bananagrabber character. Although he retains most of the rights to the character, he gave away the animation rights to Michael. It was later made into an animated television series that became an infrequent background joke. He also briefly had a ventriloquist act with a stereotyped African-American doll named Franklin Delano Bluth. Gob and Franklin produce an album together, &quot;Franklin Comes Alive&quot;. He is frequently seen throughout the series getting around on a Segway which has a pouch that says &quot;Gob&quot; on it. Gob&#x27;s often repeated lines are &quot;Come on!&quot; and, &quot;I&#x27;ve made a huge mistake&quot; which are also used in various forms by himself and later by other characters as well. In the fourth (revival) season of the show, Gob prepares to marry his nephew George Michael&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, Ann, though he escapes the wedding during a botched magic trick. He then attempts to thwart his long-time magician rival, Tony Wonder, though the two find themselves experiencing surprising romantic feelings for each other and even have a sexual liaison.

Gob&#x27;s character has been well received and Arnett was nominated for a number of awards for his performance as Gob including the Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 2006 as well as the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series (shared with the entire cast).

===George Michael Bluth===
George Michael Bluth (also known as George-Michael Bluth during the fourth season) (born March 3, 1990; played by Michael Cera and in flashback sequences by Christian Lavery) is the son of Michael Bluth. He begins the series as a student at Balboa High School, and works at the family frozen banana stand, where he is &quot;Mister Manager.&quot; He is straight-laced, quiet, awkward, and obedient.

He is reunited with his cousin Maeby in the first episode, and develops a crush on her after she forcibly kisses him (to teach their parents a lesson for not letting them spend more time together, although it fails because their parents are entirely oblivious to it). His nervousness around Maeby and his wrestling with his sexual emotions for her become one of the main recurring themes of the show. In the second season, he starts dating a girl named Ann, a devout Christian whom his father and Maeby dislike. Season 2 ends with George Michael and Maeby kissing, to his delight. After the incident, the two try to avoid each other for much of the third season. Later in the season, he and Maeby accidentally get married during what they believed was a fake wedding to cheer up Alzheimer&#x27;s patients in a hospital in &quot;Fakin&#x27; It&quot;.

They also kiss passionately after getting drunk off fake wine when George Michael, suspecting Maeby may be adopted, tells her they might not be related by blood. When his uncle Tobias, oblivious to their secret, proves to them both that Maeby was their naturally born daughter it becomes more cause for consternation to George Michael for the remainder of the original series until the final episode when it is revealed his aunt Lindsay was herself adopted, thus eliminating any blood ties between the two erstwhile cousins. He ultimately decides to escape to Newport by stealing his uncle Gob&#x27;s boat, feeling he doesn&#x27;t belong there anymore. Upon learning of Lindsay&#x27;s origins, he reconciles with his father and finally reveals his feelings for Maeby. Both realizing that further contact with their dysfunctional family is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth, he and Michael escape to Cabo with $500,000 and a house waiting for them, not knowing that George Senior has escaped to the same destination with the same plan. Besides his crush on his cousin, George Michael is also shown to be extremely close to his father, Michael, presumably with the two bonding more after his mother&#x27;s death.

In season 4, George Michael is now in his early twenties and in college at the University of California, Irvine. He works on new software called &quot;FakeBlock&quot;, together with his roommate Paul &quot;P-Hound&quot; Huan, which was initially intended to be a wood block app but, through several lies he has told, is now believed to be an anti-piracy and anti-hacking software, or &quot;anti-social media&quot;. George Michael is dismayed when his father moves into his college dorm room with him to attend college, through an online university. It is revealed that George Michael and Maeby have agreed not to further their relationship, though their feelings are still strong for each other; however, when George Michael is assigned to tutor Maeby in mathematics, he takes the opportunity to try and seduce her, but fails. After Maeby, now desperate for money, tried to kickstart his FakeBlock business, she puts too much pressure on him (since she has lost her own job at the film studio), and his first decision with his new business is to fire her. Meanwhile, P-Hound threatens with taking legal action regarding the ownership of FakeBlock. George Michael, ultimately, under the alias &quot;George Maharis&quot; (also the public name of the man behind FakeBlock) begins a relationship with Rebel Alley, Ron Howard&#x27;s daughter, only to find out that she is also dating his father. The father and son nearly reconcile when they realize this, but when Michael inadvertently reveals that he had known about the relationship for a while, George Michael angrily punches his father in the face.

===Maeby Fünke===
Mae &quot;Maeby&quot; Fünke (born September 22, 1990; played by Alia Shawkat) is the overlooked yet independent, sarcastic, and crafty daughter of Lindsay and Tobias. Maeby attends a progressive school before she and her parents move in with her uncle Michael. Maeby immediately becomes unmotivated and disengaged when she enters the public school system. She frequently directs her efforts at new ways to shock her woefully neglectful parents, which inadvertently turn her into a rather successful con artist. In one instance, Maeby swindles her peers out of charity money by pretending to be a disabled girl named &quot;Surely&quot; who suffers from a rare, debilitating illness called &quot;B.S.&quot; In the third season, Maeby actually prospers professionally despite her academic failures, conning her way into a job as a movie executive and maintaining the charade (with astounding and increasing success) for several months. She gets fired only when George Michael sends invitations for her 16th birthday party to all the other studio executives in her address book, who suddenly realize how young she really is. Her boss, Mort Meyers, though, wants her back when he realizes what a celebrity she has become as a result of this scandal.

Many storylines featuring Maeby involve a mutual but heavily restrained sexual attraction shared with her first cousin, George Michael. Because the model home is so cramped, the two are forced to share a bedroom. This forced proximity and the American remake of &quot;Les Cousins Dangereux&quot; lead to their first real kiss, after which the mortified cousins start avoiding each other, though not always successfully. Maeby legally marries George Michael when a &quot;fake&quot; wedding ceremony to entertain Alzheimer&#x27;s patients goes wrong. On her marriage certificate, her birthday is stated to be . George Michael is the only character to remember Maeby&#x27;s 16th birthday and arrange a celebration for her. Maeby is touched by the kindness George Michael has shown her; when George Michael explains how she may not be related to the Bluths at all, the two share a passionate kiss (and, it is mentioned, reach &quot;second base&quot;). In the final episode of the original run, &quot;Development Arrested&quot;, it is confirmed that they are indeed not blood related at all (her mother, Lindsay, was actually adopted), allowing the two to be finally together, but George Michael has second thoughts after Michael explains that despite not being blood relatives, they are still family. Again, the two anguish over their doomed relationship. In the end, Maeby pitches her life story as an idea for a television show to producer Ron Howard (who is also the narrator of the series). Howard tells her that her story may be better as a movie.

Maeby&#x27;s knack for unwittingly stumbling into potentially incestuous situations is a running joke throughout the series. In the second season, she sings an unintentionally provocative duet with her uncle Michael and kisses George Michael in a futile attempt to shock her parents and, similarly, kisses Annyong, her adoptive uncle, to shock George Michael. During her estrangement from George Michael, Maeby distracts herself by dating Steve Holt, who turns out to be Gob&#x27;s illegitimate son and therefore another one of Maeby&#x27;s first cousins. Maeby ends up slipping Steve one of Gob&#x27;s &quot;forget-me-nows&quot; to avoid having sex while tricking Steve into thinking they had. In the season 4 revival of the series, Maeby has stayed in high school for five extra years, vowing to continue this routine until her parents finally notice. She begins a relationship with Lucille Austero&#x27;s adopted son, Perfecto Telles, who she thinks is an undercover cop at the high school but is actually merely a student and whose age is young enough that her sexual relationship with him can be considered statutory rape. She is last seen being arrested on such charges.

Maeby is portrayed by Alia Shawkat. Shawkat tried out for the part with Michael Cera, who plays George Michael, in Los Angeles, and the creators thought they both did well. The two were the first to join the cast. For her role as Maeby, Shawkat won a Young Artist Award in 2005. Creator Mitchell Hurwitz named the character after his daughters Maisy and Phoebe. Hurwitz acknowledged the peculiar result of this blending, saying &quot;It just seemed like crazy extra fun to think of weird names. I don&#x27;t want us to become too self-conscious about it but, yes, we do have some strange names.&quot; Incidentally, she is often described as George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Cousin Maeby&quot;, a play on words making reference to the fact that they may not be related. Maeby was initially imagined as a pseudo-conservative, to be a deliberate foil to her activist mother Lindsay, but eventually re-imagined to be a troublemaker in other ways. In making Maeby an opposite to George Michael (she is bolder and not at all reverent towards her parents), Hurwitz thought this also contributed to the idea of George Michael and Maeby developing a romance.

===Buster Bluth===
Byron &quot;Buster&quot; Bluth (born 1973; played by Tony Hale) is the youngest son of George Sr. and Lucille, though it is later revealed that his biological father is actually George Sr.&#x27;s identical twin brother, Oscar.

As indicated by the narrator in season 2, despite being typically childish, Buster is probably more intelligent than his siblings Gob and Lindsay. He has frequent panic attacks, hates both closed and open spaces, is terrified of sheep, seals, and birds, and is wrathfully rivalrous toward his Korean-born adopted brother, Annyong. Buster demonstrates various childlike nutritional sensitivities as well: for instance, he becomes hyperactive from the sugar in juice and irritable after eating cheese; he also takes frequent naps. He has an unhealthy attachment to his domineering mother Lucille; one of the running gags throughout the series is his quasi-incestuous, Oedipal complex. For her part, Lucille won&#x27;t let him go in the sun, swim in the ocean, or stand on their balcony in windy weather. George Sr. makes reference to the &quot;claw marks&quot; left on Lucille&#x27;s womb after she gave birth to Buster. He sometimes tries to assert his independence by defying his mother&#x27;s orders, as when he dates her rival, Lucille Austero. He has an alienating habit of greeting people with shoulder massages, and commonly addresses his relatives by their relation to him (for example, Gob and Michael are greeted with &quot;Hey, brother&quot; and Oscar is greeted with &quot;Hey, uncle-father Oscar.&quot; Steve Holt is greeted with &quot;Hey, possible nephew&quot;). Buster seems to have inherited many personality quirks from his biological father Oscar, such as his cluelessness, doughiness, and propensity to give shoulder massages. Despite his obvious personality flaws, Buster does care about the rest of his family more than many of the other Bluths, shown when he, unlike the rest of his siblings, does not sell the company stocks at Michael&#x27;s request and fakes a coma so that he wouldn&#x27;t have to testify against his family.

In the second-season premiere, Lucille spontaneously enlists Buster in the United States Army at the urging of a Michael Moore impersonator. Although Buster&#x27;s training is poor, his possible deployment to Iraq is a recurring fear of his and his mother&#x27;s. This possibility is abruptly nullified when Buster&#x27;s left hand is bitten off by a &quot;loose seal&quot; (pun on &quot;Lucille&quot;), when he impulsively gets the courage to jump into the ocean one day after years of being afraid to swim. In subsequent episodes he wears a trans-radial prosthetic on his left arm that is sometimes a hook and other times a prosthetic hand.

In season 4, Buster reenlists in the Army for a sense of purpose after his mother Lucille is arrested and Lucille Austero rejects him for being unable to have a relationship rather than view her as a surrogate mother. In the Army, Buster is unwittingly made a UAV pilot (thinking he is merely playing a video game), but is &quot;wounded&quot; after falling out of his chair, receiving several commendations and being fitted with an oversized robotic hand that makes more powerful motions than he can control. Realizing for the first time that he has been killing people as a UAV pilot, he fakes failing his physical therapy, eventually failing the &quot;Q Test&quot; (cute test) in which he proves he is able to control his prosthetic when he delicately holds a kitten. After being discharged from the Army, he meets Herbert Love&#x27;s wife, Ophelia, who takes pity on him and convinces her husband to let him stay with the family, suggesting he could be useful to the campaign as a poster child against wasteful government spending. She later sleeps with Buster in retaliation for photos she finds of Herbert and Lindsay, but then breaks it off with him after Herbert ends his affair and wants to make the marriage work. At Cinco de Cuatro, Buster knocks Herbert unconscious with his prosthetic hand after being told by Perfecto Telles (an anti-bullying squad member defending Maeby) that Herbert is a bully. His storyline in the fourth season ends with him being arrested for Lucille Austero&#x27;s murder after being seen around the staircar where her body went missing.

In season 5, Buster is arrested for the murder of Lucille Austero. He participates in a float parade participating as an inmate. Oscar breaks Buster out of jail by escaping from the parade and leads Buster to believe that this is part of the parade and later tells him that they are on the run from the police and must remain in hiding. Buster is not told that he has already been cleared for release from jail after the charges against him were dropped because of a lack of evidence, namely Lucille Austero&#x27;s body was not found. He later reveals that he figured out that he was not on the run from the police. At the end of season 5, a cement wall used by GOB for a magic trick is broken open where Buster had placed a mannequin. When the wall is broken open, Lucille Austero&#x27;s body falls out while the entire Bluth family looks at Buster who finally confesses that he did it; he murdered Lucille Austero and says that she reminds him of his own mother.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; selected Buster as the uncle for &quot;The Perfect TV Family&quot;.

===Tobias Fünke===
Tobias Onyango Fünke ( ; played by David Cross) is the husband of Lindsay, father of Maeby Fünke, and uncle of George Michael Bluth. He was the chief resident of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital until he lost his license for giving CPR to a man who was not actually having a heart attack. At one point, he was licensed as both an analyst and a therapist, supposedly making him the first licensed &quot;analrapist&quot; ( ), which he later changes to &quot;theralyst&quot;. Tobias is very fond of awkwardly rolling or somersaulting into and out of certain situations mainly to show his supposedly catlike agility and balance, though this often backfires.

At the beginning of the series, Tobias decides that his destiny is to become an actor, and he pursues this career throughout the series with very little success. Highlights of his &quot;career&quot; include being turned down for the role of &quot;Dr. House&quot;; landing the part of &quot;frightened inmate number two&quot; in a prison film, only to get fired for not being able to do the shower scene due to his never-nude condition (see below); portraying George Sr. in the poorly narrated series, &quot;Scandalmakers&quot;; and attempting to join the Blue Man Group as a standby understudy and, as a consequence, spending part of the second season covered in blue make-up. In a move inspired by the film &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;, Tobias masquerades as a British housekeeper/nanny named &quot;Mrs. Featherbottom&quot; in an attempt to spend time with his wife and daughter after Lindsay kicks him out of the model house. While the disguise fools no one, the family humors him since this gets the housework done. In season 4, he receives an audition for &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, but never hears the answering machine message saying so.

Tobias suffers from &quot;never-nude&quot; syndrome (which, as the narrator states, is &quot;exactly what it sounds like&quot;) and wears denim cut-off shorts under his underwear (and underneath that, a tube sock) at all times in order to avoid anyone (including himself and his wife) seeing his genitalia. The condition is similar to severe gymnophobia, although it is portrayed humorously. In the episode &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, he attempts to reach out to his nephew George Michael during his tenure in the &quot;Adam&quot; muscle-suit for the &quot;Living Classics Pageant&quot; mistakenly assuming they have the same phobia (in reality, George Michael is trying to impress his cousin, Maeby). He conquers this for a time in the middle of Season 1, but after a close-up picture of his genitalia is shown on the evening news (where it has been mistaken for a photo showing evidence of WMDs in Iraq), he is driven back to the cut-offs.

Although he is heterosexual, he has said many things that make people question his sexuality. The hints come in the form of subtle innuendos and sexual double-entendres, to which he seems completely oblivious. In season 2, Michael advises him to record what he says for a day, after which Tobias acknowledges that he is a &quot;blowhard&quot; (in &quot;Ready, Aim, Marry Me!&quot;). Lindsay, who married Tobias to spite her parents, is convinced that her husband is gay. His self-help book, &quot;The Man Inside Me&quot;, is a success, though only in the gay community, due to the fact that he replaced all gender-related pronouns with only male pronouns, to avoid confusion. He has experienced sexual difficulties with his wife. This leads to their joint decision to try an &quot;open&quot; marriage, even though Tobias himself acknowledges that this path never works. Tobias doesn&#x27;t really follow through with the &quot;open relationship&quot;, and often stalks his wife covered in Blue Man Group blue paint, following her around on her attempted dates hiding in areas that are blue in color in order to remain unseen. Although he continually takes very expensive acting lessons from Carl Weathers, he mainly gets tips on frugality from Mr. Weathers. Lindsay continually pokes fun at Tobias&#x27; desperation to become an actor, and they split up and reconcile many times over the course of the series.

As of season 4, Tobias is also a registered sex offender in Orange County, California after inadvertently appearing on &quot;To Entrap a Local Predator&quot;, a pedophile sting operation hosted by John Beard, similar to &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;″s &quot;To Catch a Predator&quot;. Eager to see his daughter and remove his rock monster costume, Tobias enters the house and proclaims, &quot;Is there a little girl here all by herself?&quot; and equally incriminating, &quot;Daddy needs to get his rocks off.&quot; Tobias drives a Volkswagen Cabriolet with a vanity plate intended to say &quot;A New Start!&quot;, which is abbreviated as &quot;ANUSTART&quot;. This becomes a recurring nickname in season four. During this season, he falls in love with the hardcore drug addict and recovering actress DeBrie Bardeaux (Maria Bamford).

The Russo brothers asked Cross to make a cameo appearance as Tobias in their 2018 superhero film &quot;&quot;, but he was unavailable for filming; however, Tobias can still be seen in the film as one of the alien Collector&#x27;s specimens, played instead by an uncredited extra covered in blue paint.

===George Bluth Sr.===
George Oscar Bluth Sr. (born August 25, 1947; portrayed by Jeffrey Tambor and in flashback sequences during season four by Seth Rogen, and in flashback sequences during season five by Taran Killam), called &quot;Pop-Pop&quot; by his grandchildren, is the husband of Lucille Bluth, and father of Gob, Lindsay, Michael, and Buster (and, much later, the adopted Annyong). George Sr. was born in Cleveland, Ohio. He was the original CEO of the Bluth Company, which he founded; however, after years of &quot;creative accounting&quot; practices, he became the subject of an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and was imprisoned or in hiding during the first three seasons of the show.

While in prison, George Sr. continues to try to exert control over the company, often using his son Gob to undermine his more competent son Michael&#x27;s authority. At the end of season 1, George Sr. escapes to Mexico with a briefcase filled with evidence of his dealings with Saddam Hussein in Iraq. In season 2, George Sr. fakes his death in Mexico and returns to America to hide in the attic of the Bluth model home. Early in season 3, after being discovered among the Blue Man Group in Reno, Nevada, he is placed under house arrest. He tells Michael that he has been set up to build homes in Iraq by a group of British contractors operating out of &quot;Wee Britain&quot; in Orange County, California, but ultimately admits that he may be guilty of &quot;light treason.&quot; By the end of the series, however, it is revealed that he is under the control of his wife, Lucille, and that the CIA have in fact set him up as a &quot;patsy&quot;. He escapes to Cabo with Michael and George Michael following the party at the conclusion of season 3. In season 4, George Sr. and Lucille pretend to be separated while he establishes a sham sweat lodge for wealthy CEOs on the border of Mexico, while planning his larger project of building a wall on the border of Mexico and the US, with the support of politician Herbert Love. His separation with Lucille becomes a real one when she realizes he has been appeasing her sexual needs by swapping himself with his identical twin brother, Oscar; Lucille consequently announces her desire for an actual divorce.

Before the events of the show, George Sr. was also the inventor of the Cornballer, a faulty product which has been banned in numerous countries. He has a religious awakening twice on the show, once becoming Jewish after a period of isolation and selling a video series entitled &quot;Caged Wisdom&quot;, and once becoming a devout Christian after reading a pamphlet in a garbage bag while hiding in the attic.

===Lucille Bluth===
Lucille Bluth (née Jenkins; played by Jessica Walter, in flashback sequences during season four by Kristen Wiig, and in flashback sequences during season five by Cobie Smulders) is the matriarch of the Bluth family. She is the mother of Gob, Michael, Buster, and the adoptive mother of Lindsay and Hel-loh &quot;Annyong&quot; Bluth, as well as wife to George Sr. Her grandchildren are George Michael Bluth, Maeby Fünke, and Steve Holt (Gob&#x27;s son), with the former two affectionately calling her &quot;Gangie&quot; . She carries on an affair with George Sr.&#x27;s identical twin brother Oscar.

Lucille is accustomed to an opulent and decadent lifestyle, which she funds with misappropriated Bluth Company money. She treats herself to repeated spa treatments and face lifts, and is known to abuse alcohol and prescription drugs. She is condescending and verbally abusive towards her long-suffering housekeepers, and she has never made eye contact with a waiter. Lucille is extremely manipulative, narcissistic, amoral, domineering, and emotionally abusive to her children—some more than others. She furtively wrests control of the Bluth Company board from Michael. She has a tight emotional grip on her youngest son Buster, who, as a result of his mother&#x27;s dominance and sheltering, is unstable, socially inept, and prone to panic attacks. She frequently insinuates that her daughter Lindsay is fat and lazy, and makes no attempt to hide her dislike for Gob. She repeatedly lies to her children to keep them fighting amongst themselves, fearing they will turn on her if they are getting along. In the finale, George Sr. reveals that she is the mastermind behind the Bluth Company&#x27;s illegal actions.

At the end of season 3, Lucille makes a run from the SEC on board the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, after Annyong turns in evidence against her. The ship consequently capsizes and she is arrested in season 4. Due to negligence or sudden excuses, none of the rest of Lucille&#x27;s family ends up attending her trial. She is sent to a country-club-like prison for women, where her prison identification number is &quot;07734&quot; (which upside down reads &quot;hELLo&quot;, a reference to Annyong&#x27;s real name).

===Narrator===
The Narrator (voiced by executive producer Ron Howard, who went uncredited in the role for the first three seasons) narrates much of the Bluth family&#x27;s lives, and often interjects quick explanatory (and sometimes humorous) comments before, after, or while characters speak. He frequently brings up past footage to illustrate his points, and along with the cameramen can be excluded from the events of the story at times, in the style of a documentary narrator. The Narrator&#x27;s personal feelings often inform his narration, for example in the episode &quot;Spring Breakout&quot;, the narrator repeatedly criticizes the narrator of the television show &quot;Scandalmakers&quot; for having no talent and paying no heed to facts. Likewise, Howard&#x27;s own career is occasionally referenced. In the season 1 episode &quot;Public Relations&quot;, the publicist Jessie insultingly calls George Michael &quot;Opie&quot; (Howard&#x27;s character on &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;) to which the Narrator responds &quot;Jessie had gone too far, and had best watch her mouth.&quot; In the season 3 episode &quot;S.O.B.s&quot;, he begs the audience to &quot;please tell your friends about this show&quot; after George says that begging is &quot;sometimes… the only way to stay in the game.&quot; The narrator has implied that he knows Maeby from her time as a studio executive. In season 4, Maeby receives a lifetime achievement award at a ceremony called &quot;The Opie Awards&quot;, on which the narrator comments that &quot;it&#x27;s nice to have an award named after you&quot;.

==Secondary characters==

===Ann Veal===
Ann Paul Veal (primarily played by Mae Whitman) was the on-again/off-again girlfriend of George-Michael Bluth, even though their relationship was little more than his means of distracting himself from Maeby. Her first appearance was in the episode &quot;Let &#x27;Em Eat Cake&quot;, where she was played by Alessandra Torresani. In every subsequent appearance, she was portrayed by Mae Whitman.

She comes from an extremely religious family, and her father (played by Alan Tudyk) is a pastor. In &quot;Meat the Veals&quot;, Ann&#x27;s mother (played by Ione Skye) kisses Michael, which she believes to be making love to him. The kiss leads to a brawl between Michael and her husband at the end of the episode.

With the exception of George-Michael, the Bluths all struggle to remember Ann&#x27;s name. In the high school yearbook, she is identified as &quot;Not Pictured&quot; under her photograph, although they did print a retraction in the spring supplement. Michael disapproves of his son&#x27;s relationship with Ann, believing his son to be setting his dating standards too low, and refers to her variously (and always accidentally) as &quot;Bland&quot;, &quot;Egg&quot;, &quot;Annabel&quot;, &quot;Yam&quot;, &quot;Ham&quot;, &quot;Plant&quot;, &quot;Plain&quot;, and &quot;Ann Hog&quot;. He once abandons her in Mexico accidentally. Maeby takes pleasure in referring to Ann as &quot;Bland&quot;. George-Michael tells Maeby that Ann is &quot;not bland&quot; when forced to defend his love interest.

Ann is attracted to George-Michael&#x27;s Star Wars kid-like lightsaber demonstration, which leads to their reconciliation after a breakup midway through the second season. George-Michael wanted to get pre-engaged to Ann at the end of the second season, lost his resolve at the last moment, and was then asked by Ann to teach her his secular ways.

Ann&#x27;s strict conservatism serves as a foil for Maeby&#x27;s commitment to rebellion. Ann leads the protest at Maeby&#x27;s premiere of the English remake of &quot;Dangerous Cousins&quot;, originally a French movie about a sexual relationship between two cousins.

Ann moves on from George-Michael after coming in third place in an &quot;Inner Beauty&quot; pageant. Gob, who admits a penchant for third-place pageant winners, later reveals that he is dating a Christian girl, who eventually turns out to be Ann.

In season 4, Ann and Gob get engaged after he takes her virginity, but she decides to break up with him after he botches a magic trick that ruins their wedding. Shortly after, Tony Wonder sleeps with and impregnates Ann when she is vulnerable. Several years later, after she has her baby, Ann tricks Wonder into sleeping with Gob to get revenge on both of them.

===Annyong Bluth===
Hel-loh &quot;Annyong&quot; Bluth (Justin Lee) is the adopted Korean son of Lucille and George Sr.

Lucille adopts Annyong midway through the first season in order to teach Buster a lesson. Apparently knowing no English, the youth greets his adoptive family by saying &quot;&quot; (안녕), the Korean word for &quot;hello.&quot; When they repeat the word, so does he. This causes Lucille to assume his name is &quot;Annyong&quot;. Annyong is often neglected and finds himself in conflict with Buster. He also develops a crush on Maeby in the season one finale after she kisses him to make George Michael jealous. He is apparently sent to the Milford School (a school where students&#x27; silence is encouraged) by Lucille, who is attempting to teach him a lesson that she does not even remember. She never hears from him at the school and, apparently, she promptly forgets his existence altogether. Annyong returns only much later in the series; he is found to be hiding in the walls of Lucille&#x27;s apartment with mysteriously obtained surveillance equipment. In the third-season finale it is revealed that Hel-loh (meaning &quot;One Day&quot; in Korean, finally revealing his name after his usual greeting of &quot;Annyong&quot;, prompting further ironic confusion among the Bluths) orchestrated the second SEC raid on the Bluth Company. He explains that his grandfather &quot;one day&quot; promised vengeance upon the Bluths, revealing that his grandfather originated the banana stand idea which the Bluths stole (thus launching the Bluth corporate empire while leaving the grandfather penniless) before Lucille quietly arranged the grandfather&#x27;s deportation. Now Annyong has come to the United States, patiently waiting to avenge his grandfather by financially ruining the Bluths: sneaking his way into their family and reporting their corporate misdoings to the SEC. This act of revenge at the end of season 3 causes Lucille to attempt to flee the SEC aboard the &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. She is imprisoned for this in season 4, during which Annyong makes only one brief cameo appearance, spitefully trying to charge an expensive food item to the Bluth account, only for it to be declined to his horror.

His actual name, &quot;&quot;, means &quot;a single day&quot; in Korean, but is more accurately romanized as H&quot;aru&quot; or H&quot;alu&quot; as opposed to &quot;Hel-loh.&quot;

:Appears in: &quot;Shock and Aww&quot;, &quot;Staff Infection&quot;, &quot;Justice Is Blind&quot;, &quot;Missing Kitty&quot;, &quot;Best Man for the GOB&quot;, &quot;Not Without My Daughter&quot;, &quot;Let &#x27;Em Eat Cake&quot;, &quot;The One Where Michael Leaves&quot;, &quot;¡Amigos!&quot;, &quot;Mr. F&quot;, &quot;Development Arrested&quot;, &quot;Red Hairing&quot;

===Barry Zuckerkorn===
Barry Zuckerkorn is the sluggish and bumbling attorney for the Bluth family. He is played by Henry Winkler, with Max Winkler playing the younger Zuckerkorn in flashbacks.

Zuckerkorn represents George Sr., the family patriarch, who has been arrested and charged with defrauding investors, and &quot;light treason&quot; (George Bluth Sr., had built homes in Iraq with Saddam Hussein). Zuckerkorn often appears languid and distracted in his handling of the case. Unfortunately for the Bluth family, he does not seem particularly adept in the courtroom.

He is invariably ill-prepared, which he usually blames on long meetings the night before. In fact, most of his nights are spent hanging out at rest stops, a behavior that is frequently mentioned and accompanied by a fast cut to an establishing shot of a dark, shady rest-stop facility. In addition, he had not caught up with the status of George Sr.&#x27;s case and comments that he went on a date with &quot;a woman who works two jobs&quot;, cutting to images of his mugshots (implying he attempted to hook up with a prostitute that was actually an undercover cop).

His sexual leanings are ambiguous although it appears that he may prefer the company of male transvestite prostitutes; it is possible that he is outwardly homophobic (often making mildly negative references and comments about &quot;the homosexuals&quot; and then regretting his comments) while secretly homosexual. Like Tobias Fünke, Barry makes many colorful references that seem to allude to his exclusive attraction to men. They aren&#x27;t explicit enough, however, to be conclusive. He has been with the Bluths for a long time and was kept only because Lucille considers him to be &quot;part of the family.&quot; His reputation is stronger with the elder Bluths than with the children.

Despite his parents&#x27; dependence on Barry, Michael Bluth fired him on the first episode of the third season, which ended his law career (as the Bluth family was his only client). Since then, he has been acting as a transvestite prostitute, and Lindsay seeing her husband Tobias retaining Barry&#x27;s &quot;services&quot; has prompted her to seek a divorce. Zuckerkorn was replaced as the Bluths&#x27; attorney by Bob Loblaw, but returned to represent them following the events of &quot;Development Arrested&quot;.

:Appears in: &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, &quot;Beef Consommé&quot;, &quot;Altar Egos&quot;, &quot;Justice Is Blind&quot;, &quot;Not Without My Daughter&quot;, &quot;Let &#x27;Em Eat Cake&quot;, &quot;The One Where Michael Leaves&quot;, &quot;Good Grief&quot;, &quot;Sad Sack&quot;, &quot;Queen for a Day&quot;, &quot;Out on a Limb&quot;, &quot;Hand to God&quot;, &quot;Motherboy XXX&quot;, &quot;Righteous Brothers&quot;, &quot;The Cabin Show&quot;, &quot;Flight of the Phoenix&quot;

===Kitty Sanchez===
Kitty Sanchez (Judy Greer) is George Bluth Sr.&#x27;s fiercely loyal and independent assistant. She has herpes, as Gob reveals in &quot;Righteous Brothers&quot;.

Kitty maintained a long-term affair with George Sr. and a fevered yet brief liaison with Gob, despite the fact he is disgusted by her. After George Sr. was imprisoned, Kitty stayed on to work for Michael.

Despite her intense loyalty to George Sr., she did not demonstrate the same toward Michael. Michael finally got fed up and fired her, but Kitty and Michael&#x27;s father both insisted he didn&#x27;t have that power, the latter of whom insisting, upon Michael&#x27;s observation on her sanity, that, &quot;You don&#x27;t fire crazy.&quot; Michael attempted to rehire Kitty, but her obstinacy forced him to immediately fire her again. Kitty subsequently vanished with potentially damaging information concerning her sexual history with her boss. In actuality, she did not disappear, but was working with the police in an effort to gain control of the Bluth company. After arranging a meeting with Michael, she inadvertently admitted that she had proof that George Sr. had built homes overseas without paying taxes. Michael downplayed the importance of the revelation and Kitty dropped out of sight.

Kitty re-emerged in &quot;Let &#x27;Em Eat Cake&quot; to rescue George Sr. from the hospital. They escaped to Mexico together but were separated again when he was pronounced dead. Kitty caught up with him in &quot;Spring Breakout&quot; and blackmailed him into staying with her, and giving her the son he had promised her (prompting George Sr. to comment, &quot;Never promise crazy a baby&quot;). Michael and Gob managed to rescue their father while Lucille had a showdown with her rival. The Bluth matriarch put her years of alcohol abuse to good use by besting Kitty in a drinking contest. Seemingly defeated, the hung over mistress returned to her hotel room to discover the Bluths had inadvertently left behind the ransom she&#x27;d been asking for: &quot;250cc&#x27;s of George Sr.&quot; in a cooler.

Kitty returned later, claiming she had reformed, gotten into AA, and even has a famous sponsor. She won&#x27;t say who it is, but she drops some pretty obvious hints of it being an ex-&quot;Night Court&quot; star; (&quot;It&#x27;s not Bull. It&#x27;s not Harry Anderson. And he&#x27;s white.&quot;), a reference to actor John Larroquette as show creator Mitchell Hurwitz was once a writer for &quot;The John Larroquette Show&quot;, and Larroquette himself is a recovering alcoholic. At the end of Season 2 she and Tobias, the state of his marriage still up in the air, had jetted off to Reno, Nevada so he could pursue a plum spot in the Blue Man Group. As we learn in season 3, the part has already been taken by George Sr., who then proceeds to steal Kitty from his son-in-law as well. A final reference to Kitty is made when Tobias masquerades as her in an effort to win back Lindsay&#x27;s affection.

Kitty has the habit of attempting to bribe people with sexual appeal by baring her breasts, usually with the comment, &quot;Take a good look, &#x27;cuz it&#x27;s the last time you&#x27;re gonna see these&quot; or &quot;say goodbye to these, Michael.&quot; Michael&#x27;s reaction tends to be one of vague horror, and based on his claim to have seen &quot;seven nipples&quot; in one day after witnessing Gob and Kitty exposing their chests, Kitty may have had botched plastic surgery.

In season 4, Kitty works for Imagine Entertainment, where she continues to undermine Michael. She had previously sabotaged Maeby&#x27;s career in the film business.

===Lucille Austero===
Lucille Austero (Liza Minnelli), often referred by members of the Bluth family as &quot;Lucille 2&quot;, is the friend, neighbor, and chief social rival of Lucille Bluth.

Lucille Austero lives in the apartment next to Lucille and Buster Bluth in the Balboa Towers. In season 1, she and Buster end up dating after an incident at a country club auction when Buster bids on the wrong Lucille. Their relationship is looked down upon by the other Bluths. Her chronic case of vertigo often causes some difficulty for the klutzy Buster.

In season 2, she becomes the majority shareholder of the Bluth company after the family members sell their shares. To ensure the company&#x27;s safety, Gob romances Lucille, who in turn names Gob the president of the Bluth Company in place of Michael. Although continuously stating that he is disgusted by her, it is seen in various clips that he is in fact infatuated with Lucille 2. Buster at the time is dating Starla, the Bluth Company receptionist. After learning his older brother is dating his ex-girlfriend, Buster leaves Starla to pursue Lucille. Eventually, Lucille leaves both of them for Stan Sitwell.

By season 4, Lucille 2 has come into control of the Bluth Company (now the Austero Bluth Company) after the entire family sells their stocks, and the season ends with Lucille 2 mysteriously going missing, leaving only a bloody scene during the Cinco de Cuatro festivities. Buster is arrested for her (suspected) murder. Throughout the season, she is shown to aggravate the majority of the Bluth family with her political and business plans, making the circumstances of her disappearance ambiguous. 
In the last episode of season 5, a cement wall used by Gob for a magic trick is broken open where Buster had placed a mannequin. When the wall is broken open, Lucille Austero&#x27;s body falls out while the entire Bluth family looks at Buster who finally confesses that he did it; He murdered Lucille Austero and says that she reminds him of his own mother.

===Lupe===
Lupe (B.W. Gonzalez) is Lucille Bluth&#x27;s Hispanic housekeeper. Lucille is frequently abusive towards her. Lupe, and at one time the rest of her family, has been tricked into working for other members of the Bluth family (specifically Lindsay) on a number of occasions. In the second season, Lucille fires Lupe when she catches her in bed with Buster (whom Lupe refers to as &quot;retardo&quot; in &quot;¡Amigos!&quot;), comforting him about the loss of his hand. Lupe is replaced by a robotic vacuum cleaner (specifically a Roomba), which is also caught in bed with Buster. Lupe returns as the family housekeeper without explanation in season 3, and appears very briefly as one of the women posing as Lucille and Lindsay in rehab. Lupe is the sister of Luz (played by Lillian Hurst), Lucille&#x27;s original maid who was fired for supposedly taking a day off to take her daughter to the hospital.

===Oscar Bluth===
Oscar George Bluth (Jeffrey Tambor) is George Sr.&#x27;s identical twin.

Oscar can usually be distinguished from the balding George by his flowing &quot;lion&#x27;s mane&quot; hair, apparently due to lack of stress in his life. He is a frequent user of marijuana. He served as a &quot;croc spotter&quot; on a swift boat in the Vietnam War (yelling out &quot;Croc!&quot; whenever he saw a crocodile), and once wrote a song for David Cassidy, &quot;All You Need Are Smiles&quot;, that made Joan Baez call him &quot;the shallowest man in the world.&quot; In season 2 it is revealed that he is Buster&#x27;s father, which he makes frequent and heavy-handed references to, but Buster only realizes the truth through an unintentional turn of phrase. Oscar resides most often in a trailer outside Camp Pendleton. He owns about of lemon groves and sells lemonade to the troops when their maneuvers pass by. He sells the land to Michael, who is unaware that the government has an easement on it so they can drive their tanks through it. Lucille takes advantage of Oscar&#x27;s feelings for her and convinces him to buy the land back.

According to Michael, Oscar has lived on handouts all his life. According to his brother, he has never had to work for a living, leading to his full head of shoulder-length hair that Lucille finds irresistible. Oscar&#x27;s persistence with Lucille—whom he met when she was working a USO tour—leads to a rekindling of their once torrid romance. This disturbs Buster, who discovers the adulterous pair &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot; multiple times. After George Sr. escapes confinement, Oscar is arrested because police assume he is George. The police also impound Oscar&#x27;s trailer, leaving him even more indigent than usual. Lucille allows him to live with her and Buster. Oscar&#x27;s presence allows Buster to develop the many talents he&#x27;d discovered with Lucille. He lovingly brushes Oscar&#x27;s hair, a ritual once reserved for Lucille. In return, Buster is treated to several uncomfortable silences upon witnessing Oscar&#x27;s penchant for living loose and literally, &quot;letting it all hang out.&quot; Oscar&#x27;s shameless exhibitionism is a product of the proximity he shares with his dream woman. Once confined to a single residence, the illicit pair revive the past.

In the second-season finale, to clear up his legal difficulties and punish his brother for cuckolding him, George Sr. shaves Oscar&#x27;s head and turns him in. The stress of being imprisoned and mistaken for George Sr. causes Oscar&#x27;s hair to not grow back. This, paired with the fact that his fingerprints have been burned off by the family Cornballer, prevents him from establishing his identity. To convince the world of his true identity, Oscar sets up www.imoscar.com, a blog of sorts that details his life in prison while continually asserting that he is Oscar. A real-life version of the site was maintained by Fox Broadcasting until mid-2006. 

In the third season, Oscar manages to get out of prison when George Sr. is placed under house arrest and leaves town. He returns occasionally, but these visits are usually ended when George Sr. knocks him out and switches places so he can escape again. In the series finale, George invites Oscar to the Bluth Company function to unwittingly take his place, a fact Oscar learns as soon as Lucille refers to him as George (&quot;Oh God Oscar! When are you going to learn there&#x27;s no such thing as free shrimp!&quot;) Oscar again plays a larger role in the fourth (revival) season, where he and his brother continually switch identities to defraud wealthy CEOs looking for spiritual enlightenment in the desert between California and Mexico.

:Appears in: &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot;, &quot;Not Without My Daughter&quot;, &quot;The One Where Michael Leaves&quot;, &quot;The One Where They Build a House&quot;, &quot;¡Amigos!&quot;, &quot;Good Grief&quot;, &quot;Sad Sack&quot;, &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot;, &quot;Switch Hitter&quot;, &quot;Queen for a Day&quot;, &quot;Burning Love&quot;, &quot;Out on a Limb&quot;, &quot;Hand to God&quot;, &quot;Sword of Destiny&quot;, &quot;Meat the Veals&quot;, &quot;Spring Breakout&quot;, &quot;Righteous Brothers&quot;, &quot;The Cabin Show&quot;, &quot;Prison Break-In&quot;, &quot;Development Arrested&quot;

===Steve Holt===
Steve Holt (Justin Grant Wade) is a senior (taking the year for the third time) and football star at the high school George Michael and Maeby attend, who often shouts his name, &quot;Steve Holt!&quot;, while pumping his fists in the air.

Described as a &quot;moron jock&quot; by George Michael and &quot;basically a young Gob&quot; by Michael, Steve Holt portrays Beatrice when Tobias bungles the school&#x27;s production of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, briefly dates Lindsay (after Maeby convinces him that Lindsay is transsexual), and is student body president for four years (he declines a fifth term in order to concentrate on finding his real father). His campaign posters often read &quot;Volt for Steve Holt.&quot; The crowd at his re-election rally can be heard chanting &quot;Four more years.&quot;

In the season 2 episode &quot;The Immaculate Election&quot;, it is revealed that Steve Holt is the son of Gob Bluth and Eve Holt (Charleigh Harmon Stelly), the product of one of Gob&#x27;s many one-night stands in high school. Before realizing that she is supposedly a blood-relation, Steve has a brief relationship with his cousin, Maeby, which results in his being given a roofie to avoid any kind of intimacy. After learning of his parentage, he bonds with both his father and &quot;Uncle Mike&quot;. He has worked as a gift-basket delivery boy, boil-in-bag meal delivery boy, Bluth Banana Stand employee, and cameraman for his father&#x27;s magic act.

In season 4, Steve Holt is slightly overweight and balding, and works in pest control. He wishes to reconnect with his father and run a father-son business, but he is again left alone.

===Tony Wonder===
Tony Wonder (Ben Stiller) is a professional magician who commonly works at the Gothic Castle and is known for baking himself into a loaf of bread and emerging. Many of his tricks are direct mocking references to David Blaine. He has a tendency to make dramatic entrances when the word &quot;wonder&quot; is spoken, and the narrator mentions this makes it difficult for him to hide during a conversation when &quot;wonder&quot; is spoken.

Gob idolizes Wonder, but he believes that he came up with the idea for being baked into food first (he had the idea of being boiled into a chowder ten months earlier). As a result, Gob (a pitiful magician in comparison) believes Tony Wonder to be his greatest rival. Tony Wonder has a &quot;W&quot; for a goatee, and seems to specialize in illusions featuring food. He is also producing a DVD, which he dubbed &quot;Use Your Allusion 2&quot; after discovering his preferred title, &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot;, was unavailable due to copyright issues. Gob claims in season 3 that Tony Wonder lost a testicle to a live dove in his pants.

Tony Wonder returns in the season 4 series revival, in which he pretends to be a no-longer-closeted gay man, in order to seduce Gob for information-gathering purposes. Gob in turn attempts to seduce Tony for similarly deceptive reasons. Instead, the two begin to actually feel a mutually romantic connection and even have sex, though they both wear ridiculous masks.

==Other recurring characters==

===Throughout the series===

====Bob Loblaw====
Bob Loblaw (played by Scott Baio) is the new family attorney, replacing Barry Zuckerkorn.

Bob Loblaw first appears in the third episode of season 3, claiming this is not the first time he&#x27;s been brought in to replace Barry, and that he can do anything Barry can do, plus skew younger, alluding to Baio&#x27;s experience with Henry Winkler (Zuckerkorn) on the 1970s sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot;.
Contrasting Zuckerkorn&#x27;s incompetence, Loblaw is a no-nonsense attorney who is always in the company of his stenographer, and frequently overbills.

He advertises his services with slogans such as &quot;Why should you go to jail for a crime someone else noticed?&quot; and &quot;You don&#x27;t need double talk; you need Bob Loblaw.&quot; As is evidenced by this, his name is meant to sound like &quot;&quot;. Underneath his commercial advertisement is the phrase &quot;Bob Loblaw No Habla Español&quot;.

Adding to the tongue twister-like aspect of the character&#x27;s name, the third-season episode &quot;S.O.B.s&quot; includes a newspaper headline that reads &quot;Bob Loblaw Lobs Law Bomb&quot; and later in the season &quot;Bob Loblaw Launches Law Blog&quot; (viz. &quot;The Bob Loblaw Law Blog&quot;).

He has a daughter named Hope.

:Appears in: &quot;Forget-Me-Now&quot;, &quot;Notapusy&quot;, &quot;Mr. F&quot;, &quot;Making a Stand&quot;

====Carl Weathers====
Actor Carl Weathers portrays himself as a thrifty, mooching Hollywood movie star whom Tobias hires to teach him his craft.

Tobias meets Carl Weathers on an air porter destined for Los Angeles International Airport. Tobias once traveled to San Francisco to attend Carl Weathers&#x27; stage-fighting workshop. The actor failed to show because, as he informed Tobias, he was bumped from the flight. However, he discovered that they pay $300 to people who are inconvenienced in this manner. Carl Weathers called this &quot;a crazy loophole in the system that the wrong guy discovered.&quot; Ever since then, Carl Weathers has been getting himself deliberately bumped from flights and subsequently cashing in.

Carl Weathers does not enjoy paying very much for anything. He is obsessed with thrift, exemplified by his claims that he acquires all of his cars from police auctions and his seeming obsession with &quot;getting a stew going&quot; using leftover pieces of food. He takes Tobias on as a client and is thereby introduced to the Bluth experience. Lucille Bluth uses Carl Weathers to get back at her youngest son, Buster, who has become involved romantically with her chief rival, Lucille Austero. She simply introduces Carl Weathers to Lucille 2 and suggests that they should have dinner together with Buster. Buster, however, reminds his mother that he has class that day. Lucille suggests that Carl Weathers and Lucille 2 would just have to dine alone, in that case. When Buster finally decides to move in with Lucille II, he discovers her and Carl Weathers &quot;getting a stew going&quot; and is greatly disturbed.

In the episode &quot;Motherboy XXX&quot;, Weathers meets with Tobias at Burger King, and explains he is directing an episode of &quot;Scandalmakers&quot; and needs Tobias to sign over the rights for the story of his family. The whole scene satirizes product placement, as Burger King is a major sponsor of both the real &quot;Arrested Development&quot; and the fictitious &quot;Scandalmakers&quot;. Weathers joyfully remarks that all soft drink refills at Burger King are totally free. Tobias praises Burger King as &quot;a wonderful restaurant&quot;, of which narrator Ron Howard agrees.

At one point, Weathers appears dressed to play the role of ICE in the &quot;Scandalmakers&quot; documentary.

Years later, Michael enlists Weathers to appear as himself in a movie to be based on Michael&#x27;s life.

:Appears in: &quot;Public Relations&quot;, &quot;Marta Complex&quot;, &quot;Motherboy XXX&quot;, &quot;The B. Team&quot;

====Doctor Fishman====
Doctor Fishman (also called Doctor &quot;Wordsmith&quot; and the Literal Doctor; played by Ian Roberts) is a doctor who has a tendency to be too literal in his pronouncements. He has, for example, said that Buster would be &quot;all right&quot;, when he lost his left hand. Also, that &quot;it looks like he&#x27;s dead&quot;, when he in fact means that Tobias (covered at the time in blue paint) literally looks as if he is dead, but is in fact alive, and that it &quot;looked like they&#x27;d lost&quot; George Sr. when he&#x27;d actually escaped through the window. His frequent misleading statements anger the Bluth family after several visits, and Lucille claims in season 4 that this tendency has caused him to constantly move hospitals.

:Appears in: &quot;Let &#x27;Em Eat Cake&quot;, &quot;The One Where Michael Leaves&quot;, &quot;Hand to God&quot;, &quot;Sword of Destiny&quot;

====Gene Parmesan====

Gene Parmesan (Martin Mull) is a mediocre private detective occasionally hired by Lucille Bluth. Despite his professional incompetence, he is shown to be a master of quick-change. She hires him to find George Sr. in the second-season episode, &quot;¡Amigos!&quot;. Parmesan always reports to Lucille by approaching her in a disguise and then dramatically revealing himself; Lucille screams in delight every time, and never recognizes him. He is highly regarded as one of the best detectives by Lucille but is said in the narration, however, to be &quot;far from the best&quot;.

The episode &quot;Out on a Limb&quot; has Michael talking briefly to Gene on his cellphone, having hired him to investigate Maggie.

Appears In: &quot;¡Amigos!&quot;, &quot;Queen B.&quot;, &quot;A New Attitude&quot;, &quot;Off the Hook&quot;

====J. Walter Weatherman====
J. Walter Weatherman (Steve Ryan) is a one-armed man used by George Bluth to frighten his children into good behavior.

Weatherman is a former employee of George Sr. who lost one arm in a Bluth Company construction accident. George Sr. recruited Weatherman repeatedly to fake accidents in which he loses his &quot;arm&quot; (a fake arm and blood) due to misbehavior from the young Bluth children. The lesson ends with J. Walter turning to the children and saying &quot;and that&#x27;s why you ...&quot;, finishing the sentence with whatever action George Sr. is trying to promote. Examples include: leaving notes and not yelling. When Michael asks his father put him in touch with Weatherman to teach George Michael a lesson, George Sr. tells him that he &quot;killed him when he left the door open with the air conditioner on.&quot; (a reference to an unseen &#x27;lesson&#x27;) This is shown to be untrue when George Sr. hires Weatherman back to teach Michael a lesson about teaching lessons to his son. Buster later uses the same trick on both Michael and George Sr. as well as Gob, using his fake hand, to teach them a lesson about not using amputees to teach lessons.

====John Beard====
John Beard (himself) is the news anchor for the fictional Fox 6 news station, which often covers the Bluth family&#x27;s problems on the news, and in one case (&quot;Missing Kitty&quot;) almost became &quot;part of the story&quot;. His announcements of news stories often end with &quot;what that means for your weekend&quot;, regardless of whether the story would actually affect the general public&#x27;s weekend. Beard was news anchor at KTTV, the real-life Fox affiliate for Los Angeles, at the time the show was on Fox; during the first season on Netflix, he was working at WGRZ (an NBC affiliate) in Buffalo, New York and would commute between Buffalo and Los Angeles for filming.

====Mort Meyers====
Mort Meyers (Jeff Garlin) is a studio executive who works with Maeby. Although he has a wife, Mort often hits on Maeby, believing that she is older than she really is.

====Officers Taylor and Carter====
Officers Taylor (Jay Johnston) and David Carter (Jerry Minor), are two police officers who frequently appear, memorably at George Bluth&#x27;s hearings, and at the Bluth Company in search of Kitty Sanchez after her disappearance. They, like Michael Bluth, practice bring-your-daughter-to-work day, mentioning their daughters as named Tammy and Monica who are unseen, having apparently run off (demonstrating their lack of good attention, implying their incompetence in their search mission for Kitty). They are revealed to be a gay couple in the episode &quot;Hand to God&quot;, in which lawyer Maggie Lizer pretends to be pregnant, having hired her to have their baby. The baby is in fact carried by Maggie&#x27;s pregnant client, who gives birth to the child later in the episode.

====Sally Sitwell====
Sally Sitwell (Christine Taylor) is Stan Sitwell&#x27;s daughter and Michael&#x27;s childhood sweetheart. In adulthood, she is briefly Michael&#x27;s girlfriend. Sally and Lindsay were always competitive rivals, as they ran against each other for student body president in high school, and in adulthood Sally was campaign manager for Lucille Austero&#x27;s run for Congress, while Lindsay worked for her opponent Herbert Love. (Season 4 ends with Lindsay and Sally taking over as the candidates after their employers&#x27; incapacitation and disappearance, respectively, mirroring their high school rivalry.) Also in season 4, Sally is in a relationship with Tony Wonder (Christine Taylor and Ben Stiller are married in real life). It is also revealed that she suffers from alopecia, like her father.

:Appears in: &quot;Burning Love&quot;, &quot;Out on a Limb&quot;, &quot;Flight of the Phoenix&quot;, &quot;A New Attitude&quot;

====Stan Sitwell====
Stan Sitwell (Ed Begley, Jr.) is a real estate tycoon who runs the company Sitwell Enterprises, which competes with the Bluth Company.

He has a disease that prevents him from growing hair on his body, alopecia universalis. Lucille incorrectly refers to him as an alpaca, which turns out to be partially correct when he acknowledges his wig is alpaca hair. Stan Sitwell begins dating Lucille Austero. His outlandish wigs and fake facial hair are a bit of an inside joke, since in real life Ed Begley Jr. is known for his mane of thick blonde hair. Because of his condition he can&#x27;t actually drive the Corvette that Michael Bluth gave him in return of making a bid on his daughter Sally Sitwell at the Country Club auction because it is a convertible, which causes him to lose his wig and fake eyebrows. When Stan Sitwell fires Gob Bluth from his company, Gob gets revenge on Sitwell by stealing his fake dressy eyebrows. He runs his business in a very straight forward, professional manner in contrast to the lying and manipulation of the Bluths. He is also a generous philanthropist and contributes to numerous charities, contrary to the Bluths as well.

====Starla====
Starla (Mo Collins) is the Bluth company secretary that Gob hires as his &quot;business model&quot; in season two after seeing her at a boat show. Starla often proves to be quite incompetent as a secretary, and claims that she had an affair with producer Quincy Jones, a claim backed up with the display of several of his gold records along the walls of Starla&#x27;s house but disputed by spokespersons for Mr. Jones. On trying to gain entrance to his grounds, she is supposedly attacked by guard dogs, and is subsequently treated for rabies. Near the end of Season 2, Buster and Starla have a brief relationship, which abruptly ends when Buster misses his old flame Lucille Austero.

====Stefan Gentles====
Stefan Gentles (James Lipton) takes over as the prison warden where George is being detained after the previous warden, James Buck, leaves. He is less strict (though one of his favorite punishments involve beating people with a pillowcase full of batteries), and is a lover of the arts.

Gentles allows Tobias to research his role as Frightened Inmate Number 2 and enthusiastically encourages it. Gentles suggested that shadowing feared prisoner White Power Bill would help Tobias find the inspiration for the role. The warden&#x27;s enthusiasm for acting is a metafictional joke, since the actor James Lipton is famous as the host of the real-world television series &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;.

Gentles writes a screenplay called &quot;The New Warden&quot;, which is rejected by everyone including Maeby while she works as a film executive. With some editing by Lucille Bluth, he is able to get an elementary school to perform the adult-themed story as a school play.

====Tom Saunders====
Tom Saunders (Tom Saunders) is an employee of the Bluth Company. His sad-sack personality and downtrodden looks (appearing to be a middle-aged man despite only being thirty years old as of season three) are frequently the butt of jokes. In season 4, Tom is revealed to be one of the many registered sex offenders living in Sudden Valley.

====Wayne Jarvis====
Wayne Jarvis (John Michael Higgins) is a lawyer who can describe himself in one word: &quot;professional&quot;. Michael tries to hire Wayne to replace Barry Zuckerkorn but Wayne refuses once Michael and Lindsay try to use him to get back at their mother. Later Wayne becomes the prosecutor of the Bluth Company; when confronted with an accusation of a conflict of interest he replies, &quot;It&#x27;s called the PATRIOT Act, read it.&quot; Wayne Jarvis is &quot;almost always&quot; serious, a fact that caused him to once be called &quot;the worst audience participant Cirque du Soleil ever had&quot; because he &quot;did not find their buffoonery amusing&quot;.

:Appears in: &quot;In God We Trust&quot;, &quot;Sad Sack&quot;, &quot;Righteous Brothers&quot;, &quot;Fakin&#x27; It&quot;, &quot;Exit Strategy&quot;

====Wife of Gob====
Wife of Gob (Amy Poehler) is a certified seal salesperson who married Gob as part of an evening of escalating dares (meant to be a one-night stand). He never learned her name, which was a running joke. She is portrayed by Amy Poehler, who was, at the time, married in real life to Will Arnett, who plays Gob. Ironically, they would later divorce. Poehler&#x27;s real name is used in a scene where Gob talks about the fact that he doesn&#x27;t know her name and, when he learns it, he will mock it: &quot;Bad example, if her name is Amy, I&#x27;ll call her Blamey.&quot; He guesses her name as &quot;Crindy&quot; and &quot;Saul Zentsman&quot; (the latter turning out to be her lawyer), and when he meets her again misreads the &quot;U.S. Army&quot; label on her uniform as being her name, calling her &quot;Usarmy&quot;. She sells trained seals (selling sick ones to third-world countries) and convinces Gob to wear bright, colorful sweaters. Possibly the only fan of &quot;Dr. Fünke&#x27;s 100% Natural Good-Time Family Band Solution&quot;, she saw their show in the late &#x27;90s and was comforted by the fact that they sang about every side effect she was going through. When she realizes she is in love with Tobias, she decides to end her marriage to Gob to join the United States Army to make use of her propensity for daring behavior. She frequently takes photos while smoking and pointing at crotches, a clear parody of Lynndie England, a central figure in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. She is seen in season one and does not appear again until the 13th episode of season two in her final appearance. In this appearance, she returns to break up with Gob and to reclaim the seals that she &quot;gave&quot; to him while in the army but is told that he does not have them because he set them free. One of the loose seals recently bit off Buster&#x27;s left hand. She and Gob finally consummate their marriage just minutes before signing the divorce papers.

====Rebel Alley====
Rebel Alley (Isla Fisher) is the illegitimate daughter of Ron Howard, introduced in the fourth season. She is an actress whose work consists primarily of Public Service Announcements, directed by her father, advising against her own misdeeds (shoplifting, texting while driving, etc.); however, she has also worked with Terrence Malick and Woody Allen as well as the American remake of &quot;Dangerous Cousins&quot;. Michael is attracted to Rebel due to her resemblance to his deceased wife Tracey. Despite not knowing her name, after meeting her Michael tries to impress her by bragging that he is a producer. Michael also mistakenly believes her to be the girlfriend rather than daughter of Ron Howard, and only realises the truth when he reveals his feelings for her in front of Ron and Tobias. Meanwhile, Rebel takes interest in George-Michael, intrigued by his Fakeblock software, unaware that he is Michael&#x27;s son (he goes by the name &quot;George Maharis&quot;). Rebel spends the night with George-Michael when he invites her to his dorm and continues to lie about his fake software. In his own pursuit of Rebel, Michael learns that he and his son are seeing the same woman. When he thinks that they had broken up he runs into George-Michael on his way to see Rebel and they are forced to be honest with each other. She has a son named Lem Depardieu, who lives in France and only stays with her during French pilot season.

====Adelaide====
Adelaide (Bronwen Masters) falls in love with Buster Bluth for his &quot;limp form&quot;, while he is pretending to be in a coma in season 3. She has an Australian accent and has fallen in love with other male coma and paralyzed patients in the past. Adelaide appears in the earlier Season 3 episode &quot;Notapusy&quot; where she and Tony Hale are shown in a scene from the 1941 fake British wartime film &quot;A Thoroughly Polite Dustup&quot;. The film is used to explain that, in Britain, calling someone a &quot;Pussy&quot; used to be a term of endearment, and therefore once differed in context to its American use as an insult. The word &quot;Fag&quot; is also used in the film short, which means &quot;cigarette&quot; in the UK. This film is also later parodied in the episode &quot;Exit Strategy&quot; with both actors playing the main characters, Nurse Adelaide and Buster Bluth.

:Appears in: &quot;Notapusy&quot; (as 1941 wartime Nurse), &quot;Fakin&#x27; It&quot;, &quot;Family Ties&quot;, &quot;Exit Strategy&quot;

====Larry Middleman====
Larry Middleman (Bob Einstein) is a professional surrogate, hired by George Sr. to act as his eyes and ears so that he can continue influencing the family&#x27;s dealings while under house arrest. &quot;The Surrogate&quot;, as Larry is called, is always on the job, wearing a suit and tie at all times, with a baseball cap displaying the word &quot;Surrogate&quot;. The cap carries a small camera and microphone, which transmit audio and video feeds in real-time to George Sr&#x27;s computer and/or television. George Sr. has a voice feed back to the surrogate, so that he can tell Larry what to do, what to say on his behalf, where to go, etc. At one point, he also misinterprets George Sr.&#x27;s sarcasm as a compliment (&quot;Another brilliant idea, Einstein&quot;).

Larry is a consummate professional, never allowing his own persona to come through except on rare occasions, such as when he sometimes inserts self-promoting comments (&quot;He&#x27;s worth every penny&quot;) among George Sr.&#x27;s actual words, and another occasion where he hit GOB for insulting him. Larry does occasionally misinterpret George Sr.&#x27;s instructions, usually with amusing consequences, and is challenged when Buster takes control of the microphone in an attempt to reconnect with Gob.

Larry appeared at the beginning of season three in the episode, &quot;Forget-Me-Now&quot; and stayed on for several episodes before being fired remotely in front of a mirror by George Sr. after a very poor judgement call regarding what was meant to have been a sotto voce comment, or perhaps unspoken altogether. He reappeared in &quot;S.O.B.s&quot; as a surrogate for a business associate of George Sr.

====Maggie Lizer====
Maggie Lizer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), an attorney who pretends to be blind, is considered to be the most feared prosecuting attorney in all of Orange County, not because she is a particularly skilled prosecutor, but because her faked disability often won the sympathy of both the judge and defendant.

Maggie makes her first appearance in &quot;Altar Egos&quot;, which aired on March 17, 2004.

Michael Bluth meets Maggie in a bar. When she introduces herself, she says her name is Maggie Lizer, as in &quot;Maggie &quot;lies her&quot; ass off&quot;. After she mistakes Michael for an attorney, he awkwardly claims that his name is Chareth Cutestory and that he practices maritime law, a reference to a role as a lawyer that Michael held in a school musical, &quot;The Trial of Captain Hook&quot;. Maggie and Michael return to her home after drinking at the bar. He spends the night and wakes up perplexed as how to proceed. When he realizes she is blind, Michael decides to continue seeing her out of guilt.

Maggie is prosecuting the government&#x27;s case against the Bluths; Maggie knew who Michael was but chose not to reveal this. Instead she gave him what she described as &quot;a summary of everything the government has against the Bluths so far&quot;, which was actually a wish list, in an attempt to manipulate him. Michael continues seeing her despite the conflict of interest. When her guide dog, Justice, is revealed to be actually blind, Michael realizes that she is not blind, but had been faking the condition to pass her law school exams and gain sympathy during trials. As a result of the deception, Maggie is taken off the case.

Maggie returns for two episodes in season 2, eight-and-a-half months pregnant—eight-and-a-half months after her relationship with Michael. She later admits the child is not Michael&#x27;s, having volunteered to be a surrogate for two homosexual police officers—though this also turns out to be a deception, as she &quot;outsourced&quot; the pregnancy to a client who was suing a restaurant for making her fat. Realizing that the two of them cannot be in a relationship as they crave complications in their lives, they decide to part ways after a final fling. Ironically, a throwaway gag at the end of the episode reveals Maggie became pregnant as a result.

====Marta Estrella====
Marta Estrella is the Colombian soap opera star of &quot;El Amor Prohibido&quot; that Gob dates in season one. In her first two appearances, Marta was played by Leonor Varela. She was played by Patricia Velásquez for all following episodes with one minor exception: during a flashback in the episode &quot;Forget-Me-Now&quot; of Michael&#x27;s past experiences with women, she is played by a third actress. She has two sons: Amable (played by Oliver Patrick Sandino) and Cortesio (played by Casey Sandino). Marta is attractive, moral, and holds family to be very important. Although Marta was dating Gob, she and Michael Bluth soon develop feelings for each other. Marta eventually chooses Michael over Gob, but she ends up leaving both of them after she catches them fighting over her.

*&quot;Uncredited Actress&quot;, &quot;Forget-Me-Now&quot;

====Rita Leeds====
Rita Leeds (Charlize Theron) is an English woman to whom Michael Bluth was attracted and briefly engaged.

Rita first appeared in the second episode of Season 3, &quot;For British Eyes Only&quot;.

Rita is later revealed to be a wealthy heiress and owner of all Wee-Britain (and the Wee-Britain in Cleveland)—a fictional town that runs on GMT time and where one drives on the left.

There are a number of somewhat subtle indications that she may have a mental or learning disability throughout episodes 2, 3 and 4 of season 3; however, Michael either misinterprets this as charming eccentricity (attributing certain behavior to her being British) or does not seem to have noticed. Some of these indications include the fact she spends her days at &quot;Slow Brook&quot;, a private school, in &quot;Notapusy&quot; she is seen casually walking out of a men&#x27;s bathroom, and also carries around various stuffed animal-shaped backpacks, including a duck and a seal. In &quot;Forget-Me-Now&quot; Rita is drugged by Gob and left on a bus bench. The bench had an advert for Wee Britain, and the letters covered up by Rita&#x27;s body leaves the clue that she has a &quot;Wee Brain&quot;.

Rita is heavily involved in the &quot;Mr. F&quot; plot arc, wherein the family hears through their new lawyer, Bob Loblaw, that the CIA have a mole inside the Bluth family feeding them information whom they call &quot;Mr. F.&quot; Rita wears a bracelet that says &quot;MR F&quot;, and unintentionally implies to Michael that Mr. F is her uncle Trevor, who Michael believes is stalking him. At the conclusion of &quot;Mr. F&quot;, it is revealed that Mr. F was actually a blunderous Tobias and that &quot;MR F&quot; is in fact an abbreviation for Mentally Retarded Female, confirming that Rita was mentally handicapped. She also was given a proposal of marriage by Michael Bluth.

In &quot;The Ocean Walker&quot;, Michael, upon discovering Rita&#x27;s mental handicap, ends his relationship with her. In the same episode, Trevor tells Rita, &quot;It&#x27;s not your fault your parents were cousins, but here we are. I&#x27;ve been charged with taking care of you, and I’m bloody well gonna do it.&quot;; a tongue-in-cheek reference to George Michael and Maeby&#x27;s relationship.

It is later revealed that Rita finds a job at a competing movie studio from Maeby&#x27;s, producing a project called &quot;The Ocean Walker&quot;, although the film&#x27;s development status is arrested. The project name is a result of Rita&#x27;s belief that people can walk (presumably from America) to England. In one episode, Rita walks across a pool, not knowing that Gob rigged the pool with clear platforms for one of his illusions.

She was last seen in the series finale on the cover of a newspaper.

:Appears in: &quot;For British Eyes Only&quot;, &quot;Forget-Me-Now&quot;, &quot;Notapusy&quot;, &quot;Mr. F&quot;, &quot;The Ocean Walker&quot;

====Uncle Trevor====
Trevor Leeds (Dave Thomas) is an English man and the uncle of Rita Leeds. He helped raise Rita, whose parents were cousins, which he implied might be a cause for her intellectual disability.

Uncle Trevor first appeared in the second episode of Season 3, &quot;For British Eyes Only&quot;, in which he is first seen not letting Michael access legal files which are &quot;for British eyes only&quot;. After Michael meets Rita, he is seen swerving his Austin-Healey into the Bluth&#x27;s staircar, threatening Michael with regard to his prior interaction with Rita. Michael misinterprets the threat, thinking it has to do with the search for information regarding his father, and that Trevor has been stalking him.

He is last seen in &quot;The Ocean Walker&quot;, the sixth episode of Season 3. In this episode, after learning of Rita&#x27;s intention to attend a &quot;sleepover&quot; with Michael, he visits the Bluth residence and informs them of Rita&#x27;s &quot;millions&quot; and her ownership of Wee Britain. He later leaves for England with Rita at the end of the episode.

He also appears to be a fan of cricket, having apparently collected cricket magazines and even being in possession of a cricket bat, which was also seen in the cover of his secret magazine, &quot;Bumpaddle&quot;.

:Appears in: &quot;For British Eyes Only&quot;, &quot;Forget-Me-Now&quot;, &quot;Notapusy&quot;, &quot;Mr. F&quot;, &quot;The Ocean Walker&quot;

====White Power Bill====
White Power Bill (David Reynolds) is a massive, bald, white supremacist inmate with George Bluth Sr. at the Orange County Prison.

White Power Bill is incensed when confronted with George&#x27;s jailhouse conversion to Judaism. He is particularly upset at George&#x27;s gesture of giving Little Justice, an inmate of the prison, a kippah for protection and giving him the new name, &quot;David Ben-Avram&quot;. He responds by hitting Little Justice with a pipe, knocking off his kippa. George diplomatically states that .&quot;..both of our religions have a lot to offer. There&#x27;s the Jewish notion of heaven, and that it can be obtained here on earth, and there is your belief in the cleansing power of the pipe.&quot;

When Gob incarcerates himself in Orange County Prison (to break out as his greatest trick) he performs an &quot;illusion&quot; on Bill and pulls a quarter out of Bill&#x27;s ear, thus giving him his new nickname: &quot;Dirty Ears&quot; Bill. Bill becomes furious and later stabs Gob (right after he is finally able to have a game of catch with his father in a prison yard), yelling &quot;White Power&quot;, which gets the necessary response of, &quot;...but...&quot;I&#x27;m&quot; white...&quot; from Gob.

Upon meeting Tobias, Bill refers to him as a &quot;little kike.&quot; Tobias, oblivious (&quot;It&#x27;s been quite a while since anyone called me a tyke!&quot;), is at the prison researching the role of &quot;Frightened Inmate #2&quot; in a prison drama. He leads Bill in a counseling session which unintentionally culminates in Bill&#x27;s suicide after Tobias suggests that Bill&#x27;s inner rage stems from a hatred of himself (&quot;You hate White Power Bill&quot;); Bill jumps from the cell-block landing, saying &quot;I hate White Power Bill...&quot; and dies.

====Argyle Austero====
Argyle Austero (Tommy Tune) is the flamboyant brother of &quot;Lucille 2&quot; Austero and runs her rehab clinic, Austerity, where he is introduced to Tobias. Tobias, after initially refusing her offer, had decided it would be best to go on a work release program than stay in prison for a sex offense. Tobias convinces Argyle to make a Musical of the Fantastic 4 (written and directed by Tobias) in order to be with his girlfriend DeBrie who had recently joined the rehab group. Argyle was unable to resist the idea of producing a musical and in order to pay for it is he helps his sister by threatening Michael to pay his debt of $700,000. Ultimately, Argyle is forced to step in for DeBrie as the Invisible Girl and performed the musical with Tobias on Cinco de Quatro. In Season 5, Argyle appears as the leader of the &quot;Gay Mafia&quot;, and threatens Gob for pretending to be gay, and hints that they killed Tony Wonder for doing the same.

:Appears in: &quot;Smashed&quot;

==== Marky Bark ====
Marky Bark (Chris Diamantopoulos), introduced in season 4, is an environmental/political activist Lindsay meets when accompanying Tobias to a methadone clinic he thinks is an acting class. Falling in love with his ideals, Lindsay runs away with him, learning later that he suffers from &quot;face blindness&quot;, causing him to be unable to remember what Lindsay looks like, and that he runs an ostrich farm with his mother (Debra Mooney), a lifestyle Lindsay has trouble getting used to. Marky&#x27;s goal is to bring down right-wing politician Herbert Love. He first creates a blue &quot;glitter bomb&quot; that he intends to go off at a political fundraiser; unfortunately, Lindsay fails to help him get out of the podium he&#x27;s hiding in, resulting in the bomb going off on him and covering him in blue glitter, after which he is arrested. After he is released from jail, he plans to make an actual bomb to explode near Love at Cinco de Cuatro; however, he plants it in Lindsay&#x27;s suitcase, and since Lindsay and Tobias have matching luggage, he takes the wrong suitcase and the bomb explodes on the boat he and Tobias are on.
He is the son of environmental activist Johnny Bark (Clint Howard).

:Appears in: &quot;Indian Takers&quot;

==== Debrie Bardeaux ====
Debrie Bardeaux (Maria Bamford), introduced in season 4, is a recovering drug addict Tobias meets and falls in love with at a methodone clinic he thinks is an acting class. She is a former actress who played Sue Storm in an ultra-low-budget movie adaptation of the Fantastic Four, and Tobias tries to convince her to get back into acting. However, after no success at this, she leaves him and relapses. They meet again at the Austerity rehab center, where Tobias is a court-appointed counselor. Tobias tries to cast her as Sue Storm in his musical adaptation of Fantastic Four, to be staged at Cinco de Cuatro, but her stage fright (and the drugs she sees floating in the harbor the night of the show) lead to her not participating in the end.

:Appears in: &quot;Indian Takers&quot;

====Herbert Love====
Herbert Love (Terry Crews), introduced in season 4, is a conservative candidate for the House of Representatives who is running against Lucille Austero. He is a parody of 2012 U.S. Republican Party presidential candidate Herman Cain.

====Ron Howard====
In addition to voicing The Narrator, Ron Howard has appeared on the show as himself several times. Howard is among the individuals in Maeby&#x27;s contact list to whom George Michael sends an invitation to her birthday. In his first on-screen appearance at the end of the final episode of season 3, Howard informs Maeby, with a hint of irony, that her life story would be better off being made into a movie as opposed to a TV series. Howard has a more substantial role in season four, in which he hires Michael to help produce a fictional movie based on the Bluths&#x27; story.

==== Dr. Norman, China Garden and Heartfire ====
Dr. Norman, China Garden and Heartfire, introduced in season 4, are friends of Oscar Bluth&#x27;s who live with him on a commune at the U.S./Mexico border. George Sr. meets them while running his &quot;sweat and squeeze&quot; scam with Oscar.

Dr. Norman (John Slattery) is a disgraced anesthesiologist who often gives advice under the influence of ether. Trying to help George Sr. with his impotence, he advises him to get on an MRI machine and &quot;ride it to climax&quot;, which George interprets to mean masturbate. Norman later denies ever giving such advice, saying it&#x27;s something he&#x27;d say &quot;with my thinking cap on.&quot;

China Garden (Karen Maruyama) is Dr. Norman&#x27;s girlfriend, whom he met via a prison pen-pal program. She is loud and has a heavy accent. Her mother, Olive Garden, is in prison with Lucille.

Heartfire (Mary Lynn Rajskub) is a mute spiritualist who communicates telepathically through her thoughts, though no one ever interprets her thoughts correctly or hears her. Her thoughts are seen as floating subtitles.

===Franklin Delano Bluth===
Franklin Delano Bluth is Gob&#x27;s black puppet.

The character is first introduced in the season 2 episode &quot;Meat the Veals&quot;, in a flashback to a Bluth family gathering years before. In an effort to hip-up his act, Gob briefly introduced the puppet in a poorly executed ventriloquist act (Gob&#x27;s mouth moves every time Franklin speaks, even when Gob abandons actual ventriloquism in favor of an audio recorder hidden in Franklin&#x27;s mouth). Franklin is a fiery-tempered, adulterous, obscenity-spewing, street-wise puppet.

Gob discarded Franklin up in the attic, most likely due to the severe beating Gob received in a night club in Torrance after performing a show with Franklin. During &quot;Meat the Veals&quot;, Gob digs up his old friend and uses Franklin in a kidnapping plot with George Sr. Gob soaks Franklin&#x27;s lips with ether, so that a kiss will incapacitate his mother, and any witnesses (in this case, Buster). Franklin is again soaked in ether two episodes later in &quot;Righteous Brothers&quot; in order to incapacitate George Sr. It&#x27;s also revealed in &quot;Meat the Veals&quot; that whoever is in possession of Franklin begins speaking like him (cf. when George Sr. finds Franklin in the attic, he blurts, &quot;Hey, man, you&#x27;re gonna get your sorry white ass thrown in jail!&quot; and &quot;Get your loser hand out of my ass!&quot; when Gob finds Franklin, and when Buster uses Franklin as a hook replacement and Lucille tells him he can&#x27;t take Franklin to the country club). This phenomenon appears to be involuntary, and surprises the person holding Franklin as much as those around them, evidenced by the quizzical stare which Buster directs at the puppet following the aforementioned outburst by the usually reserved Buster.

Then Gob records a music CD with Franklin called &quot;Franklin Comes Alive&quot;, which he hoped would &quot;break down racial barriers and maybe be a crossover hit.&quot; The song tracks include &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Easy Bein&#x27; White&quot; and Gob&#x27;s cover of Bryan Adams&#x27; song &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do It for You&quot; which Gob performed especially for Michael. Unfortunately Franklin&#x27;s musical career is cut short during &quot;Righteous Brothers&quot; when a laundry accident results in Franklin getting bleached. Franklin says, in what is now a stiff, slightly British accent, &quot;You&#x27;ve ruined the act, Gob&quot;, and as Gob later tells Michael, Franklin has become &quot;all puckered and white.&quot;

Franklin returns in some season 3 episodes, most prominently in &quot;Fakin&#x27; It&quot;, after he is re-dyed and rested; as a publicity stunt, Gob manages to get Franklin on the witness list for George Sr.&#x27;s trial. (A deleted scene reveals that Gob legally adopted Franklin as his son to achieve this.) Gob also finds a way to give Franklin a voice without moving his lips by using voice promos from a magazine advertisement for &quot;Mock Trial with J. Reinhold&quot;. At the end of the episode, Franklin&#x27;s dramatic testimonial on the witness stand effectively ends the prosecution&#x27;s case against the Bluths. Franklin also appears in the next episode &quot;Family Ties&quot; as &quot;Frank&quot;, a pimp for whom Nellie works.

Franklin is a portrayal of the 1950s–1980s stereotype of blacks. As part of the political satire, Franklin also wears a &quot;George Bush doesn&#x27;t care about black puppets&quot; T-shirt in &quot;Fakin&#x27; It&quot;, a reference to Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;George Bush doesn&#x27;t care about black people&quot; remark. No matter who is controlling him, Franklin often curses and uses racial slurs to describe others in the Bluth Family.

The name Franklin Delano Bluth borrows from the 32nd President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt, but the reason for this is that in the 1970s &quot;Sesame Street&quot; introduced what some claimed to be an &quot;insultingly stereotypical African-American&quot; puppet named Roosevelt Franklin (though the puppet&#x27;s actual intended ethnicity was ambiguous and its &#x27;skin&#x27; was purple); the character was eventually dropped from the show&#x27;s line-up. Franklin could also be another tribute to the &quot;Peanuts&quot; cartoons, as this show also featured an African-American character named Franklin. It is also probable Franklin is inspired at least in some way by Chuck&#x27;s dummy Bob on the television show &quot;Soap&quot; shown on ABC from 1977 to 1981.

The running gag with Franklin is that despite being a mere puppet, he is actually treated as a real person. This can be seen in &quot;Meat the Veals&quot;, where the Security Guard treats him with respect, George Sr. attacks him for kissing Lucille, and the police regarded him as threat despite being immobile at the vehicle in the same episode.

:Appears in: &quot;Meat the Veals&quot;, &quot;Spring Breakout&quot;, &quot;Righteous Brothers&quot;, &quot;Forget-Me-Now&quot;, &quot;Prison Break-In&quot;, &quot;Fakin&#x27; It&quot;, &quot;Family Ties&quot;

===Mr. Bananagrabber===
Mr. Bananagrabber is a Hamburglar-inspired character invented by Gob.

Mr. Bananagrabber was conceived by Gob after his brother, Michael Bluth, told him that he could not have a free Bluth Banana. Dejected, Gob decides to get a candy apple at one of the other shops on the boardwalk. When Gob bites into the candy apple, it breaks his tooth and Gob develops a whistle anytime he says a word with an &quot;s&quot; in it (a key characteristic of Bananagrabber). Gob and Michael then meet again, and Michael says Gob can have a free Bluth Banana and in exchange, Gob gives Michael the animation rights to Mr. Bananagrabber (Michael makes Mr. Banana Grabber look a lot like Gob from his hair, to his missing-tooth whistle, to his Segway. When Gob sees the commercial, he says &quot;I never should have given up animation rights.&quot;).

Mr. Bananagrabber appeared on the episode of &quot;Sit Down, Shut Up!&quot; in a nightmare/flashback sequence.

Michael Bluth discussing the Mr. Bananagrabber character: &quot;I guess it would just be a guy who, you know, grabs bananas and runs. Or a banana that grabs things. I don&#x27;t know. Why would a banana grab another banana? I mean those are the kind of questions I don&#x27;t want to answer.&quot;

Mr. Bananagrabber&#x27;s first appearance was in &quot;Charity Drive&quot;. At the end of the episode, we see the first incarnation of Mr. Bananagrabber as an animated character. The short animation clip scene was designed and animated by Evan Spiridellis, one half of the animation duo JibJab.
Mr. Bananagrabber also appears briefly in the episodes &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot;, &quot;The Immaculate Election&quot; and &quot;Spring Breakout&quot;, as well as a brief cameo in the main titles of the &quot;Scandalmakers&quot; program, as seen in season 2. Although images do not exist, a Mrs. and Baby-Bananagrabber are mentioned by Gob.

Like Gob, Mr. Bananagrabber rides around on a Segway human transporter, which is referred to as &quot;Gob&#x27;s scooter&quot; on the show.

:Appears in: &quot;Charity Drive&quot;, &quot;Whistler&#x27;s Mother&quot;, &quot;The Immaculate Election&quot;, &quot;Spring Breakout&quot;

===Mrs. Featherbottom===
Phylidia Featherbottom is an alter-ego of Tobias Fünke, dressed in drag and speaking in falsetto with an English accent.

Tobias, having moved out of the model home due to his marital problems with Lindsay, returns disguised (poorly) as a British nanny to spend time with his daughter and prove to his wife that he has what it takes to become an actor. The disguise fools no one, and the performance is comically unrealistic, but the Bluths play along with the charade because Mrs. Featherbottom is an excellent cleaner, working for free.

Narration explains that the idea behind Mrs. Featherbottom is lifted directly from the film &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot;, with elements of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. She comes from the fictional Blackstool (a play on the English town Blackpool, Lancashire) and has previously worked for &quot;the Roger Moores&quot;. Mrs. Featherbottom&#x27;s faux-British speech combines with Tobias’ penchant for homosexual innuendo: &quot;Who&#x27;d like a banger in the mouth?&quot;

Mrs. Featherbottom is introduced in &quot;The Immaculate Election&quot; and is seen additionally working for Lucille at her home at the end of this episode. At the beginning of &quot;Sword of Destiny&quot;, Tobias&#x27;s &quot;desire to be discovered as himself was becoming bothersome&quot;, and he was pretending to be Mrs. Featherbottom while unshaven and without makeup. However, Lindsay is still reluctant to expose him, because Mrs Featherbottom &quot;is the only one who can hand-wash [her] delicates&quot;. In &quot;Meat the Veals&quot;, Mrs. Featherbottom injures her ankle by &quot;attempting an entrance that he hoped would enchant his daughter&quot;, jumping from the halfway down the staircase to the ground floor with an umbrella in his hand, collapsing and destroying the coffee table. Mrs. Featherbottom loses her wig and is finally exposed at the conclusion of &quot;Meet the Veals&quot;, to no one&#x27;s surprise.

The name &#x27;Featherbottom&#x27; is also used by Maeby and Lindsay in season 4.

:Appears in: &quot;The Immaculate Election&quot;, &quot;Sword of Destiny&quot;, &quot;Meat the Veals&quot;

===Surely Fünke/Woolfbeak===
Surely Fünke is Maeby Fünke&#x27;s imaginary twin and second identity that she uses to raise sympathy from the public and thus swindle money from them at fraudulent fundraising events.

In Maeby&#x27;s many schemes she often uses the alter-ego, Surely (the word being an antonym of &quot;maybe&quot;), to fool schoolmates and the community, in an attempt to make money from fundraisers for Surely, who Maeby presents as an ill wheelchair user, suffering from the imaginary rare, debilitating illness, &quot;B.S.&quot; Posters are seen at the school in episode &quot;Shock and Aww&quot;, but it isn&#x27;t until several episodes later that Maeby&#x27;s grift is revealed. In &quot;Altar Egos&quot;, George Michael attends the fundraiser for Surely Fünke, where he discovers that Maeby has been posing as the fictional dying girl. Maeby says she plans to kill Surely to give the students something to be sad about at the end of the year.

In &quot;Notapusy&quot;, Maeby pretends to be Surely Woolfbeak and enters an inner beauty pageant to prove there really is no such thing as a true inner beauty pageant. Surely Woolfbeak was essentially the same as Surely Fünke (who was apparently &quot;killed off&quot; two seasons earlier, as per Maeby&#x27;s plan). The only real difference between them was that as Woolfbeak, Maeby wore the ugly prosthetic nose worn by Nicole Kidman in &quot;The Hours&quot; that actor Jamie Kennedy had purchased for her at an auction, in hopes that she would use him in a remake of a film she was producing.

==Brief characters==

These are more or less minor characters, appearing usually for only one episode or so.

===Cindi Lightballoon===

Cindi Lightballoon (Jane Lynch) is an undercover agent working for the federal government to uncover George&#x27;s secret dealings. Posing as a fan of his Torah videos (which she actually is), she eventually falls in love with George, who only enjoys tweaking her nipples.

:Appears in: &quot;Shock and Aww&quot;, &quot;Altar Egos&quot;, &quot;Justice Is Blind&quot;

===Ice===
Ice (Malik Yoba) is a bounty hunter and professional caterer.

Ice is initially employed by Gob to follow Michael, although a recurring joke is that Gob views Ice as his friend. (Michael later pays Ice to spend the weekend with Gob).

Ice commits a series of blunders and is easily persuaded by money. He first follows Michael to Mexico while under the employment of Gob, and then is hired by Michael to find George Sr. Ice is given a blueprint with a picture of George Sr. on it, but is confused and tackles Tobias because he is wearing blue paint, and thus resembles the blue tint of the picture. ICE then returns to tracking Michael until Michael finally pays him to spend time with Gob and resume the search for George Sr. In the following episode, Ice ascertains that George Sr. was killed by a prison guard in Mexico.

Throughout these events, Ice consistently ignores or is oblivious to Lindsay&#x27;s attempts to attract him. At one point, Lindsay pretends to be talking to George Sr. on the phone so that Ice will follow her to get to George Sr., but this plan proves futile.

When Ice notifies the family of George Sr.&#x27;s plight, he displays his party-planning talents by catering the event and leaves a business card with them to help jumpstart his alternate career of party-planning, referred to as his &quot;first love.&quot;

Carl Weathers mentions to Tobias in season 2 that, in a show called Scandal Makers that he was directing to portray the Bluths, he had decided to play Ice.

:Appears in: &quot;¡Amigos!&quot;, &quot;Good Grief&quot;

===&quot;Uncle&quot; Jack===

&quot;Uncle&quot; Jack Dorso (Martin Short) is not related to the Bluth family, and was actually a friend of George Sr.&#x27;s dad. He gave George Sr. the money to buy the first tract of land for the Bluth development company in exchange for what is implied to be sexual favors from Lucille.

Jack Dorso achieved stardom as the sidekick in the radio show &quot;Red McGibbon and Bullet: Nazi Hunters.&quot; After his partner was imprisoned for being a communist sympathizer, Jack was unable to get work as an actor. He opened a chain of fitness centers, and came to be known for his annual &quot;Birthday Feats of Strength.&quot; He lost the use of his legs on his 70th birthday when he attempted to squat 350 lb (5 lb for each year of his life).

Now a 90-year-old paraplegic fitness buff, he refuses the use of a wheelchair. Instead he gets around by being carried like a child by a large man named Dragon who is hard of hearing. Dragon&#x27;s hearing impairment causes him difficulty in following Jack&#x27;s directions.

Uncle Jack agrees to give the Bluth family more money in exchange for a date with Lindsay, a woman more than half a century his junior. Lindsay was convinced to go on the date by Michael telling her the date was with Dragon, but that Dragon has to work, thus explaining Jack&#x27;s presence.

:Appears in: &quot;Ready, Aim, Marry Me!&quot;

===James Buck===

James Buck (Rocky McMurray) is warden of George&#x27;s prison until he is replaced by Stefan Gentles. Buck is aggressive and unappreciative of the Bluths, though he allows Gob to try to perform an escape act from the prison, which largely fails, leading Gob to write a &quot;strongly worded letter&quot; to Buck, for which he is detained against the trailer George Sr. and Lucille are having sex in.

:Appears in: &quot;Key Decisions&quot;, &quot;Visiting Ours&quot;

===Phillip Litt===
Phillip Litt (Zach Braff) is the director of the film series &quot;Girls With Low Self-Esteem&quot; (a parody of &quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot;); while the series is often referenced in the show, Litt only appears after Gob&#x27;s failed magic act is included in the newest release. He, along with Tobias, is a never-nude. Braff was likely cast due to his resemblance to Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Francis.

:Appears in: &quot;Spring Breakout&quot;, &quot;S.O.B.s&quot; (briefly)

===Frank Wrench (Moses Taylor)===
Frank Wrench (Rob Corddry) is the protagonist of &quot;Wrench&quot;, a fictional television series about a rule-abiding police detective. He is played by actor Moses Taylor, who is also a vocal gun activist, frequently brandishing a realistic prop gun that shoots out a flag imprinted with the Second Amendment. Lindsay briefly begins an affair with Taylor which is interrupted when she is tranquilized. From the perspective of a group of onlookers, Taylor, who is holding his prop gun, looks like he has murdered her; he quickly carries her to a bench where he leaves her and flees the scene. His voice is later heard outside the door to the bathroom on the set of &quot;Wrench&quot;, which Tobias has entered, believing it to have a real, functioning toilet.

:Appears in: &quot;Burning Love&quot;, &quot;Sword of Destiny&quot;

===Tracey Bluth===
Tracey Bluth is Michael&#x27;s deceased wife, and George Michael&#x27;s deceased mother. She died of ovarian cancer before the series. She is briefly seen in a flashback/fake ad in season 4, played by Maria Thayer.

:Appears in: &quot;It Gets Better&quot;

===Nellie===
Nellie, played by Justine Bateman, is a prostitute who Michael mistakes for his sister. He also mistakenly believes that she is a business consultant (her job title, if read carefully, is &quot;con&quot;slut&quot;ant&quot;) and hires her to work at the Bluth Company.

Although Michael and Nellie turn out not to be related, Jason and Justine Bateman are siblings in real life.

<doc id="1190619" wikidata="Q7680922" url="?curid=1190619" title="Tamaroa people">
<text>The Tamaroa were a Native American people in the central Mississippi River valley of North America, and a member of the &quot;Illiniwek&quot; or Illinois Confederation of 12 or 13 tribes. The name &quot;Tamaroa&quot; is a derivative of the word &quot;tamarowa&quot; meaning &quot;cut tail&quot; in Illiniwek and relates to a totemic animal such as bear or wildcat. An Algonquian-speaking group, like the rest of the Illiniwek, they lived on both sides of the Mississippi River in the area of the confluence with the Illinois and Missouri Rivers. Tamaroan culture is presumed to be similar to that of the Kaskaskia, Peoria, and other Illinois tribes.

==History==
An estimated 3000 Tamaroa lived along the Mississippi River, near the confluences with the Missouri and Illinois Rivers, but soon moved to a site near present-day Cahokia, Illinois. In 1682, their village, also called Tamaroa, had about 600 lodges. A Catholic mission was founded near Tamaroa in 1689, which attracted the Cahokia, another Illinois tribe, who settled among the Tamaroa. After they combined, the two tribes had only 90 dwellings, indicating a rapid decline of the Tamaroas.

The Tamaroas united with the Kaskaskia tribe in 1703 at the mouth of the Kaskaskia River, where the French had already established a community of the same name. The tribe was further reduced by its exposure to &quot;...European diseases and liquor and by warfare with the Chickasaw and Shawnee.&quot; In 1803, the U. S. government recognized the surviving Tamaroas as members of the Kaskaskia tribe.

Five leaders of the Tamaroa were among those who signed the Treaty of Edwardsville (1818), by which the various groups of the Illiniwek ceded about half of the present state of Illinois to the United States. Descendants of the Tamaroa later merged with other, larger tribes of the Illiniwek, such as the Peoria. As a consequence of the forced Indian removal in the 1830s, their descendants are to be found mostly in Oklahoma, as the Confederated Peoria Tribe.

The group later joined the Peoria tribe and moved to what would become the Kansas Territory. The consolidated Peoria were given land in Indian Territory. Thus, an unknown number of Tamaroa descendants were included in the Peoria reservation residents who were allotted land, beginning in 1889. The reservation was in present-day Ottawa County, Oklahoma.

<doc id="1190626" wikidata="Q3354915" url="?curid=1190626" title="Operation Pacific">
<text>Operation Pacific is a 1951 black-and-white World War II submarine war drama from Warner Bros. Pictures, produced by Louis Edelman, and written as well as directed by George Waggner. John Wayne and Patricia Neal star and Ward Bond and Philip Carey play supporting roles.

Much of the film is set aboard a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine. The technical advisor was World War II Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, Commander, Submarine Forces, Pacific (COMSUBPAC).

==Plot==
During World War II, the submarine USS &quot;Thunderfish&quot;, under the command of Commander John T. &quot;Pop&quot; Perry, while on a special mission to the Philippines, is charged with rescuing a group of nuns and children, including a newborn infant nicknamed &quot;Butch&quot;, and transporting them to Pearl Harbor. On their way, the sub sights a Japanese aircraft carrier and attacks, but its torpedoes malfunction, exploding halfway to the target. Attacked and pursued by the carrier&#x27;s escorting destroyers, &quot;Thunderfish&quot; manages to escape.

While in Pearl Harbor, the ship&#x27;s Executive Officer, Lieutenant Commander Duke E. Gifford goes to visit Butch at the base hospital, and runs into his ex-wife, Lieutenant (j.g.) Mary Stuart, a Navy nurse, and they kiss passionately. Unfortunately, Mary is now romantically involved with Navy pilot Lieutenant (j.g.) Bob Perry, Pop&#x27;s younger brother. Duke pursues Mary anyway, but is sent to sea again before anything is settled.

As the sub returns from the patrol, they spot a Japanese freighter, but again their torpedoes fail to explode. The enemy ship raises the white flag, and &quot;Thunderfish&quot; surfaces and approaches. The freighter turns out to be a heavily armed Q-ship that opens fire on the sub. Mortally wounded, Commander Perry orders the boat to crash dive, knowing that he will not be able to get below before she submerges.

Duke, now in command, orders a &quot;battle surface&quot; behind the ship. On surfacing, Gifford orders the boat&#x27;s deck guns and anti-aircraft guns, as well as numerous portable light and mountable heavy machine guns operated by the deck crew, to fire at will. After the Q-ship&#x27;s bridge is disabled and the ship set afire, Duke orders flank speed, ramming the sub into the Japanese ship, holing and sinking the Q-ship.

&quot;Thunderfish&quot; limps home for repairs to her damaged bow. Back at Pearl Harbor, Bob Perry believes that Duke&#x27;s order to dive the boat killed his brother, and he refuses to listen to Duke&#x27;s explanation. Mary tries to comfort Duke, but he rejects her attempts, declaring he only did his duty and feels no regret.

Working with the sub base&#x27;s torpedo specialists, Duke and the crew of the &quot;Thunderfish&quot; investigate why the torpedoes are not exploding. When they finally discover the answer, Duke goes to Mary to celebrate, but she rejects him. Since he would not let her into his life when he was at his lowest, she feels that they cannot have a real relationship. Her superior, Commander Steele, overhears the conversation and castigates Mary for throwing away her chance for happiness with Duke.

Once again &quot;Thunderfish&quot; heads to sea, this time as part of a scouting line searching for a Japanese fleet heading for Leyte to attack the American invasion force there. &quot;Thunderfish&quot; finds the enemy. Even though it will reveal their presence, Duke broadcasts the fleet&#x27;s position. Once Pearl Harbor acknowledges the message, Duke salvoes his torpedoes and makes a run for it, throwing the attacking Japanese warships into chaos. Despite enduring a battering from Japanese depth charges, &quot;Thunderfish&quot; manages to sink a Japanese aircraft carrier.

In the next phase of the battle, American carrier aircraft arrive and attack the Japanese fleet. &quot;Thunderfish&quot;, now assigned to lifeguard duty, helps to rescue shot-down American flyers, and does so while under attack from Japanese fighters. While rescuing the wounded Bob Perry, the Chief of the Boat and Junior, a seaman from a Navy family, are killed and Duke is wounded by a strafing Japanese Zero.

When the &quot;Thunderfish&quot; returns to Pearl Harbor after the patrol, Mary is waiting for Duke. The two, reconciled, head to the hospital, intending to adopt Butch.

==Production==
John Wayne and Patricia Neal did not get along during filming. Nearly fourteen years later, however, they worked together on &quot;In Harm&#x27;s Way&quot; (1965) where she noted that he had mellowed a lot, possibly because he was seriously ill with lung cancer at the time.

The film&#x27;s opening foreword and dedication states: &quot;When the Pacific Fleet was destroyed by the Japanese sneak attack on Pearl Harbor, it remained for the submarines to carry the war to the enemy. In the four years that followed, our undersea craft sank six million tons of Japanese shipping including some of the proudest ships of the Imperial Navy. Fifty-two of our submarines and thirty-five hundred officers and men were lost. It is to these men and the entire Silent Service that this picture is humbly dedicated.&quot;

The special mission shown at the beginning of the movie, in which Navy submarines ran war supplies into the Philippines and evacuated civilians, while idealized is a matter of historic record. By the time of the invasion of the Philippines in 1944, these supply runs had enabled American and Philippine Army officers who had refused to surrender to build a military organization in the islands that was the size of an army corps.

The numerous problems with the Mark 14 torpedo and its Mark VI exploder depicted in the film are accurate. A poorly designed and tested firing pin could malfunction on a good hit (that is, a torpedo striking within about 45 degrees of perpendicular to the side of the target). Poor hits (at a very sharp angle to the side of the ship) could often produce more reliable explosions. Diagnosing the problem actually did occur in a similar manner after 20 months of repeated failures in combat. Submarine crews were involved in the testing, although not in the capacity shown in the film.

The scene where Commander Perry (Bond) is killed in a surface action is a combination of two incidents involving Commander Howard W. Gilmore, captain of . Mortally wounded on the bridge, Gilmore gave the order &quot;Take her down!&quot;, sacrificing himself to save his submarine and crew, for which he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. The ramming and sinking of the armed freighter depicted in the scene occurred in the same action, just prior to Gilmore&#x27;s death.

The sequence where the &quot;Thunderfish&quot; discovers the Japanese fleet of aircraft carriers, battleships, and cruisers steaming through Surigao Strait was inspired by the actions of and in the opening phase of the Battle of Leyte Gulf.

During &quot;Operation Pacific&quot;″s action sequences, for the film&#x27;s music score composer Max Steiner incorporated dramatic music stances from his classic score for RKO&#x27;s &quot;King Kong&quot;. Warner Brothers also recycled Steiner&#x27;s main theme music from the 1948 movie &quot;Fighter Squadron&quot;, &quot;We Watch The Skyways,&quot; as the main theme for &quot;Operation Pacific&quot;. This march was first used as the main title for the 1941 movie &quot;Dive Bomber&quot;. It would be heard again in the 1959 submarine movie &quot;Up Periscope&quot;, and even in a Daffy Duck cartoon, &quot;Yankee Doodle Daffy&quot;, in 1943. It appears yet again in Bugs vs. Daffy: Battle of the Music Video Stars, a 1988 animated television special.

Two previous Warner Brothers features are cited within this film: &quot;George Washington Slept Here&quot; (1942) is traded to another submarine in exchange for &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot; (1943), of which a few seconds of footage is seen as the crewmen watch it.

Although Ward Bond&#x27;s character is presented as several years older than John Wayne&#x27;s, in reality Bond was only four years older than Wayne. Longtime friends, this was the 12th film they had done together.

The submarine &quot;Corveena&quot; was an actual submarine, albeit spelled slightly differently. was commissioned on August 6, 1943, and was torpedoed and sunk by the Japanese submarine on her first war patrol south of Truk Atoll on November 16, 1943. &quot;I-176&quot; outlived her victim by exactly six months, being depth-charged and sunk off Buka Island in the Solomon Islands on May 16, 1944.

==Box office performance==
According to Warner Bros&#x27; accounts the film earned $2,563,000 domestically and $1,300,000 in foreign countries.

<doc id="1190634" wikidata="Q2598218" url="?curid=1190634" title="Apocynum cannabinum">
<text>Apocynum cannabinum (dogbane, amy root, hemp dogbane, prairie dogbane, Indian hemp, rheumatism root, or wild cotton) is a perennial herbaceous plant that grows throughout much of North America—in the southern half of Canada and throughout the United States. It is poisonous to humans, dogs, cats, and horses. All parts of the plant are toxic and can cause cardiac arrest if ingested. Some Lepidoptera feed on this plant, such as the hummingbird moth.

==Description==
&quot;Apocynum cannabinum&quot; grows up to tall. The stems are reddish and contain a milky latex. The leaves are opposite, simple, broad, and lanceolate, long and broad, entire, and smooth on top with white hairs on the underside. It flowers from July to August, has large sepals, and a five-lobed white corolla. The flowers are hermaphrodite, with both male and female organs.
==Taxonomy==
===Etymology===
&quot;Apocynum&quot; means &quot;poisonous to dogs&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;cannabinum&quot;, and the common names hemp dogbane and Indian hemp refer to its similarity to &quot;Cannabis&quot; as a source of fiber. It likely got its name from its resemblance to a European species of the same name. It is called qéemu in Nez Perce and in Sahaptin. The Maidu Concow people call the plant pö (Konkow language).

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Apocynum cannabinum&quot; grows in open wooded areas, ditches, and hillsides. It is found in gravelly or sandy soil, mainly near streams in shady or moist places. It is native to much of North America—in the southern half of Canada and throughout the United States.

==Ecology==

The plant serves as a larval host for the snowberry clearwing (&quot;Hemaris diffinis&quot;), which is a pollinator that resembles a small hummingbird. It is also a host plant for the dogbane tiger moth (&quot;Cycnia tenera&quot;) and the zebra caterpillar (&quot;Melanchra picta&quot;). The larvae of &quot;Marmara apocynella&quot; feed on the stems, making a &quot;long whitish serpentine mine&quot;.

==Toxicity==
It is poisonous to humans, dogs, cats, and horses. All parts of the plant are toxic, and the plant contains cardiac glycosides. The plant is toxic both green and dried. The stems contain a white sap capable of causing skin blisters.

==Uses==
===Fiber===
Much like flax and hemp, &quot;Apocynum cannabinum&quot; contains long fibers in the stems, known as bast fibers, which can be extracted and used to create textiles. The fibers are very fine and strong, with a silky texture, and easier to process than hemp. The stalks of this plant have been used as a source of fiber by Native Americans to make bows, fire-bows, nets, tie-down straps, hunting nets, fishing lines, bags, and clothing. According to Craig Bates of the Yosemite Museum, five stalks of the plant are needed to make one foot of cordage. A large bag used for storing roots would take one to three months to complete. The stems should be harvested in the fall, after the leaves have fallen and the stalks have turned a deep reddish-brown color. Since cutting the stalks promotes regrowth in the spring, as much as possible should be harvested. Unused stems are traditionally cleared away by burning, which causes the plant to grow back taller and straighter in spring.

===Food===
The seeds have an edible use as a meal (raw or cooked) when ground into a powder.

===Chewing gum===
The plant&#x27;s latex sap can be squeezed from the plant and allowed to stand overnight to harden into a white gum which can be used (sometimes mixed with clean clay) as chewing gum.

===Phytoremediation===
&quot;Apocynum cannabinum&quot; can be used to sequester lead in its biomass by taking it up from the soil through its roots. This process, called phytoremediation, could help clean sites contaminated with lead.

===Medicinal===

It is used in herbal medicine to treat fever and to slow the pulse. &quot;Apocynum cannabinum&quot; has been employed by various Native American tribes to treat a wide variety of complaints including rheumatism, coughs, pox, whooping cough, asthma, internal parasites, diarrhea, and to increase lactation. The root has been used as a tonic, cardiotonic, diaphoretic, diuretic, an emetic (to induce vomiting), and an expectorant. It is harvested in the autumn and dried for later use. The fresh root is medicinally the most active part. A weak tea made from the dried root has been used for cardiac diseases and as a vermifuge (an agent that expels parasitic worms). The milky sap is a folk remedy for genital warts.

<text>The Minister of Supply was the minister in the British Government responsible for the Ministry of Supply, which existed to co-ordinate the supply of equipment to the national armed forces. The position was campaigned for by many sceptics of the foreign policy of the National Government in the 1930s before ultimately being created in 1939.

During World War II there was a separate Ministry of Aircraft Production; the first minister Beaverbrook later became Minister of Supply. When W. A. Robotham was Chief Engineer of Tank Design in the Ministry of Supply, he demanded sound manganese steel castings for tank tracks, as a broken track could be a death warrant for the crew. The Beaver &quot;rightly&quot; accused him of holding up production, and took a poor view of Robotham&#x27;s observation &quot;that they had enough unreliable tanks to last us the rest of the war!&quot;. In July 1941, 25% of British tanks were immobilised from mechanical failure, although there was no enemy action in the theatres of war! 

The Ministry of Aircraft Production was amalgamated into the Ministry of Supply in July 1945.

In the post-war governments, the Ministry became increasingly unpopular with economy-minded Conservatives, who objected to it as a redundant middle-man. This point of view was shared by Reginald Maudling, who served as the Minister under Anthony Eden and refused to continue in office under Harold Macmillan, who had served in a junior role in the Ministry and believed in it. Nevertheless, he agreed to wind it up in 1959.

<doc id="1190648" wikidata="Q4669317" url="?curid=1190648" title="Abraham–Minkowski controversy">
<text>The Abraham–Minkowski controversy is a physics debate concerning electromagnetic momentum within dielectric media. Two equations were first suggested by Hermann Minkowski (1908) and Max Abraham (1909) for this momentum. They predict different values, from which the name of the controversy derives. Experimental support has been claimed for both. 

The two points of view have different physical interpretations and thus neither need be more correct than the other.
David J. Griffiths argues that, in the presence of matter, only the total stress–energy tensor carries unambiguous physical significance; how one apportions it between an &quot;electromagnetic&quot; part and a &quot;matter&quot; part depends on context and convenience.

Several papers have claimed to have resolved this controversy.

The controversy is still claimed to have importance in physics beyond the Standard Model where electrodynamics gets modifications, like in the presence of axions.

<doc id="1190651" wikidata="Q383528" url="?curid=1190651" title="Andrew G. Vajna">
<text>Andrew G. Vajna (born András György Vajna; 1 August 1944 – 20 January 2019) was a Hungarian film producer whose films include the first three entries in the &quot;Rambo&quot; series, &quot;Total Recall&quot;, &quot;Tombstone&quot;, &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot;, &quot;Evita&quot;, and &quot;Terminator 3&quot;. He founded the now-defunct production companies Carolco Pictures, Cinergi Pictures, and C2 Pictures, frequently in collaboration with Mario Kassar.

==Biography==
===Early life and first business successes===
Andrew G. Vajna was born in Budapest to György Vajna (born Weidmann), a merchant, and his wife, Klára. His family was Jewish. In 1956 at the age of 12, he fled from Hungary and with the support of Red Cross he made his way alone to Canada. He arrived having no friends and speaking no English. Later on he reunited with his parents in Los Angeles, USA, who fled Hungary separately. He studied cinematography at University of California, Los Angeles and then joined the university&#x27;s Educational Motion Picture Department where he worked on different projects.

Preferring independence Vajna left UCLA to set up his own photo studio, but that venture soon came to end when he broke his leg in a ski accident and business could not operate for 9 months. After his recovery he became a hairdresser and teamed up with a boyhood friend, Gábor Koltai, a wig stylist in Hollywood, to produce high quality wigs. Vajna moved to Hong Kong where he established his own wig manufacturing company, called Gilda Fashion. Finally Vajna sold the firm in 1973. By that time the company employed more than 3,000 people.

===Entering the film industry – The Carolco times===
Vajna launched his career in the entertainment industry with his purchase of motion picture theatres in the Far East. He founded Panasia Films Limited in Hong Kong, a highly profitable venture in the distribution, acquisition and representation of films. After Vajna negotiated the sales of Panasia to Raymond Chow&#x27;s Golden Harvest Company in 1976, and met Mario Kassar at the 1975 Cannes Film Festival, he and the film producer and industry executive formed Carolco, specializing in sales, financing and distribution of films worldwide. Vajna and Kassar had rented a small office on Melrose Avenue where their desks faced each other in the office and Vajna&#x27;s wife and Kassar&#x27;s girlfriend were their secretaries. In less than four years, Carolco became one of the top three foreign sales organizations in motion pictures industry.

In 1982, Vajna was a founder and then president of the American Film Marketing Association. During that same year, Vajna and Kassar made their film production debut with &quot;Rambo: First Blood&quot;, starring Sylvester Stallone. &quot;First Blood&quot; was a success, grossing $120 million internationally. &quot;&quot; was released in 1985, generating more than $300 million worldwide.

Vajna was executive producer with Mario Kassar on such films such as Alan Parker&#x27;s &quot;Angel Heart&quot;, and &quot;Rambo III&quot;. Other projects include &quot;Music Box&quot;, &quot;Mountains of the Moon&quot;, &quot;Total Recall&quot;, &quot;Air America&quot;, &quot;Narrow Margin&quot; and &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;.

===Cinergi Productions Inc.===
In December 1989, Vajna sold all his interest in Carolco for $106 million and formed Cinergi Productions, Inc. to engage in the financing, development, production and distribution of major event motion pictures. As part of its business plan, Cinergi formed an alliance with The Walt Disney Company for distribution of Cinergi motion pictures in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Vajna&#x27;s strategy was to develop long-term relationships with certain talent and produce a steady supply of two to four event motion pictures per year. John McTiernan directed Cinergi&#x27;s first production, &quot;Medicine Man&quot;. Christmas 1993 saw the release of &quot;Tombstone&quot;, the Wyatt Earp/Doc Holliday legend. In 1994, Cinergi released &quot;Renaissance Man&quot; and &quot;Color of Night&quot;.

The summer of 1995 saw the release of two Cinergi productions. The first was &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot;. To date, the film has grossed over $365 million worldwide. The second release was &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;. Also in 1995, Cinergi released two more films: &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; and &quot;Nixon&quot;. Nixon received four Academy Award nominations.

Another Cinergi release was Alan Parker’s adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice’s rock opera &quot;Evita&quot; starring Madonna and Antonio Banderas in 1996. Nominated for five Academy Awards, the film was also a commercial success, grossing $141 million worldwide and winning Golden Globes for Best Picture, Best Actress and Best Original Song.

===Back to his roots, entering the Hungarian film industry===
Vajna never forgot his Hungarian roots and always tried to help the Hungarian film industry. He had a major role in many films being shot in Budapest, such as &quot;Evita&quot;, &quot;Escape to Victory&quot; and &quot;Red Heat&quot;.

He also participated in the distribution of Motion Pictures in Hungary eventually having a 70% share of the Hungarian box office. In 1989 Vajna founded InterCom that has become a market-leader and a distributor of many Hollywood studios, including 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., Sony Pictures, Disney and MGM.

He was a producer of the record-breaking Hungarian comedy &quot;Out of Order&quot; aired in 1997. With 750,000 viewers in cinemas and several million on television it broke Hungarian box office records.

In 1998, Vajna took Cinergi private by buying out the public stockholders. Thereafter, he joined with his former partner, Mario Kassar, and started C2 Pictures. Their first return venture into big budget Hollywood was &quot;I Spy&quot; (2002), starring Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson, which was shot in Budapest.

In 2002 he founded DIGIC Pictures in Hungary which is an animation studio specializing in full 3D animation and visual effects.

In 2003, he and Kassar produced &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

In 2005 Vajna was, together with Quentin Tarantino and Lucy Liu, the executive producer of a feature-length documentary called &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Fury&quot;, created by Colin Keith Gray and Megan Raney Aarons, which showed his renewed interest in the story of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. The film called &quot;The Children of Glory&quot;, which showed the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, was Hungary&#x27;s most successful movie in 2006 having been viewed by more than half a million people.

===Reformer of the Hungarian film funding system===
From 2011 Vajna worked as the Government Commissioner in charge of the Hungarian film industry. In the same year Vajna conceived Hungarian National Film Fund with the mission to contribute to the production of Hungarian films or co-productions that provide art and entertainment for moviegoers and bring significant success both domestically and on an international level. Under Vajna&#x27;s supervision, the money spent on film production in Hungary had doubled between 2011 and 2014.
The Film Fund provides transparent financial and professional support as well as creative cooperation, marketing support, professional expertise and international industry contacts, handling festivals, sales activity and apprentice program.

One of the recent films that received financial support from Hungarian National Film Fund was the hard-hitting drama &quot;Son of Saul&quot;, which premiered at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival where it won the Grand Prix. It also won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film, becoming the first Hungarian film to win the award. As its biggest achievement, &quot;Son of Saul&quot; was the 2016 Academy Award winner in the foreign language category.

During the Vajna era Hungarian movies financed by the Hungarian National Film Fund won altogether more than 130 international awards while the number of foreign films produced in Hungary increased significantly.

=== Media holdings and links with Viktor Orbán&#x27;s government ===
Following his return to his native country, Vajna played an important role in Viktor Orbán&#x27;s government&#x27;s influence on the media. In 2015 he bought the Hungarian TV2 Group, the country&#x27;s second-biggest commercial channel. The state-owned lender Eximbank, which usually supports export companies, helped Vajna&#x27;s acquisition. In 2015, TV2 won nearly a fifth of state advertising spending, four times more than its nearest rival, according to the independent Hungarian watchdog Mérték Media Monitor. Under Vajna&#x27;s ownership, the channel&#x27;s editorial stance was strongly in favour of the government. From 2016 until his death he also owned the Rádió 1 radio station. In 2017 he bought Lapcom Zrt. which includes the tabloid Bors, and the regional dailies Délmagyarország and Kisalföld.

===Death===
Vajna died of a heart attack at his home in Budapest on 20 January 2019 at age 74. Andrew had a son named Justin Andrew Vajna who was born in 1980 but he committed suicide on March 2, 2007 at the age of 26. Justin was suffering from schizophrenia.

<text>Sir Andrew Rae Duncan (3 June 1884 – 30 March 1952) was a British businessman who was brought into government during World War II, serving twice as both President of the Board of Trade and Minister of Supply.

Duncan was a Director of the Bank of England and of Imperial Chemical Industries. He was chairman of the Central Electricity Board from 1927 to 1935, and chairman of the British Iron and Steel Federation from 1935 until 1945. He was elected as a &quot;National&quot; Member of Parliament (MP) for the City of London in a 1940 by-election and was made a member of the Cabinet and a Privy Counsellor. He was re-elected at the 1945 election, and stepped down at the 1950 general election.

During his time in the ministerial office, there was some concern that someone so closely involved with the iron, steel and chemical industries was in charge of their regulation. However, wartime pressures kept Duncan in the post and he was undamaged. He returned to the Iron and Steel Federation after the war, working to resist the Labour government&#x27;s nationalisation plans with Aubrey Jones, his assistant, later a Conservative minister.

He was knighted in 1921 and appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in 1938. He was also awarded the Italian Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus.

In addition to his service in the United Kingdom, Duncan was appointed in 1926 by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in response to the Maritime Rights Movement to chair the Royal Commission on Maritime Claims, which was thus nicknamed the &quot;Duncan Commission&quot;.

In 1916, he married Anne Jordan. They had two sons, one of whom was killed in action in 1940. He died in his sleep on 30 March 1952, aged 67.

<text>Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI, originally High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager or HESSI or Explorer 81) was a NASA solar flare observatory. It was the sixth mission in the Small Explorer program (SMEX), selected in October 1997 and launched on 5 February 2002, at 20:58:12 UTC. Its primary mission was to explore the physics of particle acceleration and energy release in solar flares.

The spacecraft re-entered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere at 00:21 UTC on 20 April 2023, 21 years after its launch.

== Spacecraft ==
HESSI was renamed to RHESSI on 29 March 2002 in honor of Dr. Reuven Ramaty, a pioneer in the area of high energy solar physics. RHESSI was the first space mission named after a NASA scientist. RHESSI was built by Spectrum Astro for Goddard Space Flight Center and was operated by the Space Sciences Laboratory in Berkeley, California. The principal investigator from 2002 to 2012 was Robert Lin, who was succeeded by Säm Krucker.

The entire spacecraft rotated to provide the necessary signal modulation. The four, fixed solar panels were designed to provide enough gyroscopic moment to stabilize rotation about the solar vector. This largely eliminated the need for attitude control. The instrument detectors were nine high-purity germanium crystals. Each was cooled to cryogenic temperatures by a mechanical cryocooler. Germanium provided not only detections by the photoelectric effect, but inherent spectroscopy through the charge deposition of the incoming ray. The crystals were housed in a cryostat, and mounted with low-conductivity straps. A tubular telescope structure formed the bulk of the spacecraft. Its purpose was to hold the collimators above the Ge crystals at known, fixed positions.

The satellite bus consisted of the structure and mechanisms, the power system (including the battery, solar panels, and control electronics), the attitude control system, thermal control system, command and data handling system (C&amp;DH), and telecommunications system. The spacecraft structure provided support for the telescope and other components. It was manufactured out of aluminum parts to be light weight but strong. The equipment platform had a honeycomb structure to further reduce the weight. The spacecraft was manufactured in Gilbert, Arizona by Spectrum Astro, Inc.

The Imaging Telescope Assembly consisted of the telescope tube, grid trays, Solar aspect system (SAS), and Roll angle system (RAS). It was constructed, assembled, aligned, and tested at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland. The front and rear grid trays were attached to the telescope tube. It maintained the separation and alignment of the trays. Nine grids were mounted on a grid tray at each end of the telescope tube. The grid pairs modulated the transmission of solar flare X-ray and gamma ray emissions through to the detectors as the spacecraft spins around the axis of the telescope tube. The modulated count rates in the nine detectors were used in computers on the ground to construct images of solar flares in different energy bands. The five coarse grids (square) were constructed by Van Beek Consultancy in Netherlands. The four fine grids (round) were constructed by Thermo Electron Tecomet in Massachusetts. All grids were characterized both optically and with X-rays at Goddard Space Flight Center before being shipped to the Paul Scherrer Institute for integration into the imaging telescope assembly.

The spectrometer contained nine germanium detectors that were positioned behind the nine grid pairs on the telescope. These artificially grown crystals, pure to over one part in a trillion, were manufactured by the ORTEC division of Perkin Elmer Instruments. When they were cooled to cryogenic temperatures and a high voltage was put across them (up to 4000 volts), they converted incoming X-rays and gamma-rays to pulses of electric current. The amount of current was proportional to the energy of the photon, and was measured by sensitive electronics designed at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Space Sciences Laboratory, at Berkeley, California. The detectors were cooled with an electromechanical Stirling-cycle cryocooler built by SunPower Inc., and flight qualified at Goddard Space Flight Center. It maintained them at the required operating temperature of , or 75° above absolute zero).

== Mission concept ==
RHESSI was designed to image solar flares in energetic photons from soft X-rays (~3 keV) to gamma rays (up to ~20 MeV) and to provide high resolution spectroscopy up to gamma-ray energies of ~20 MeV. Furthermore, it had the capability to perform spatially resolved spectroscopy with high spectral resolution.

== Scientific objectives ==
Researchers believe that much of the energy released during a flare is used to accelerate, to very high energies, electrons (emitting primarily X-rays) and protons and other ions (emitting primarily gamma rays). The new approach of the RHESSI mission was to combine, for the first time, high-resolution imaging in hard X-rays and gamma rays with high-resolution spectroscopy, so that a detailed energy spectrum could be obtained at each point of the image. This new approach enabled researchers to find out where these particles are accelerated and to what energies. Such information will advance understanding of the fundamental high-energy processes at the core of the solar flare phenomena.

The primary scientific objective of RHESSI was to understand the following processes that take place in the magnetized plasmas of the solar atmosphere during a flare:
* Impulsive energy release
* Particle acceleration
* Particle and energy transport

These high-energy processes play a major role at sites throughout the Universe ranging from magnetospheres to active galaxies. Consequently, the importance of understanding these processes transcends the field of solar physics; it is one of the major goals of space physics and astrophysics.

The high energy processes of interest include the following:
* The rapid release of energy stored in unstable magnetic configurations
* The equally rapid conversion of this energy into the kinetic energy of hot plasma and accelerated particles (primarily electrons, protons and ions)
* The transport of these particles through the solar atmosphere and into interplanetary space
* The subsequent heating of the ambient solar atmosphere

These processes involve:
* Particle energies to many GeV
* Temperatures of tens or even hundreds of millions of degrees
* Densities as low as 100 million particles per square cm
* Spatial scales of tens of thousands of kilometers, and
* Magnetic containment times of seconds to hours

It is impossible to duplicate these conditions in laboratories on the Earth.

The acceleration of electrons is revealed by hard X-ray and gamma-ray bremsstrahlung while the acceleration of protons and ions is revealed by gamma-ray lines and continuum. The proximity of the Sun means not only that these high-energy emissions are orders of magnitude more intense than from any other cosmic source but also that they can be better resolved, both spatially and temporally.

== Imaging ==
Since X-rays are not easily reflected or refracted, imaging in X-rays is difficult. One solution to this problem is to selectively block the X-rays. If the X-rays are blocked in a way that depends on the direction of the incoming photons, then it may be possible to reconstruct an image. The imaging capability of RHESSI was based on a Fourier transform technique using a set of 9 Rotational Modulation Collimators (RMCs) as opposed to mirrors and lenses. Each RMC consisted of two sets of widely spaced, fine-scale linear grids. As the spacecraft rotated, these grids blocked and unblocked any X-rays which may have come from the Sun modulating the photon signal in time. The modulation could be measured with a detector having no spatial resolution placed behind the RMC since the spatial information was now stored in the time domain. The modulation pattern over half a rotation for a single RMC provided the amplitude and phase of many spatial Fourier components over a full range of angular orientations but for a small range of spatial source dimensions. Multiple RMCs, each with different slit widths, provided coverage over a full range of flare source sizes. Images were then reconstructed from the set of measured Fourier components in exact mathematical analogy to multi-baseline radio interferometry. RHESSI provided spatial resolution of 2 arcseconds at X-ray energies from ~4 keV to ~100 keV, 7 arcseconds to ~400 keV, and 36 arcseconds for gamma-ray lines and continuum emission above 1 MeV.

RHESSI could also see gamma rays coming from off-solar directions. The more energetic gamma rays passed through the spacecraft structure, and impacted the detectors from any angle. This mode was used to observe gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The incoming gamma rays were not modulated by the grids, so positional and imaging information was not recorded. However, a crude position could still be derived by the fact that the detectors had front and rear pickups. Also, the detectors near the burst shielded the ones away from the burst. Comparing signal strengths around the nine crystals, and front-to-back, then gave a coarse, two-dimensional position in space.

When combined with high-resolution time stamps of the detector hits, the RHESSI solution could be cross-referenced on the ground with other spacecraft in the IPN (Interplanetary Network) to provide a fine solution. The large area and high sensitivities of the germanium crystal assembly made RHESSI a formidable IPN component. Even when other spacecraft could provide burst locations, few could provide as high-quality spectra of the burst (in both time and energy) as RHESSI. Rarely, however, a GRB occurred near the Sun, in the collimated field of view. The grids then provided full information, and RHESSI was able to provide a fine GRB location even without IPN correlation.

== Experiment ==
=== Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) ===
RHESSI was intended to image at high resolution solar flares in X-rays and gamma rays. The X-rays and gamma rays covered an energy range of 3 keV-20 MeV with an energy resolution of about 1 keV and a spatial resolution of just a few seconds of arc. The imaging was accomplished by a tube containing nine pairs (one behind the other, spaced apart) of tungsten or molybdenum wire grids of width mounted parallel to the rotation axis of the tube pointing at the Sun. The tube rotated about its axis as the spacecraft spun at a rate of 15 rpm. During a rotation, a photon from any point on the Sun could either pass through a grid-pair or be blocked by one or other of the grids. This caused a modulation of the intensity of photons emanating from that point. The depth of modulation was zero for the photons arriving exactly along the spin axis and gradually increases to the off-axis photons. Behind each grid-pair was a cryogenic (75 K) germanium detector of 7.1 cm diameter and thickness. The output from each of the nine detectors, at any given energy, could be Fourier-analyzed to provide a full two-dimensional spatial spectrum of an extended source region on the Sun. The full spatial spectrum was possible because each wire grid pair had a different slit width, spacing and wire thickness. Data accumulation was about 16 Gb during a 10-minutes rotation. The telemetry data was collected at Berkeley (California), Wallops Flight Facility (WFF), Virginia, Santiago, Chile and Weilheim, Germany. Science analysis of the data involved close collaboration with many dedictated ground based and satellite based solar observatories. A secondary goal of RHESSI was to observe astronomical sources such as Crab Nebula.

== Results ==
RHESSI observations changed our perspective on solar flares, particularly on high-energy processes in flares. Its observations led to numerous publications in scientific journals and presentations at conferences. Through 2017, the satellite was referenced in 2,474 publications, books, and presentations. The collection &quot;High-Energy Aspects of Solar Flares: A RHESSI Inspired Monograph&quot; contains reviews of RHESSI solar flare research up to 2011. 

* RHESSI was the first satellite to image gamma rays from a solar flare.
* It was the first satellite to accurately measure terrestrial gamma-ray flashes that come from thunderstorms, and it found that such flashes occur more often than thought and the gamma rays have a higher frequency on average than the average for cosmic sources.

Following communication difficulties, RHESSI ceased science operations on 11 April 2018 at 01:50 UTC. It was decommissioned on 16 August 2018 and remained in a stable low Earth orbit which gradually decayed due to atmospheric drag.

<text>Poldhu is a small area in south Cornwall, England, UK, situated on the Lizard Peninsula; it comprises Poldhu Point and Poldhu Cove. Poldhu means &quot;black pool&quot; in Cornish. Poldhu lies on the coast of Mount&#x27;s Bay and is in the northern part of the parish of Mullion; the churchtown is to the south-east. On the north side of Poldhu Cove is the parish of Gunwalloe and the village of Porthleven is a further to the north.

Poldhu Point became the site of one of the main technological advances of the early twentieth century when, on 12 December 1901, a wireless signal was sent by Thomas Barron in Poldhu to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, and received by Guglielmo Marconi. The technology was a precursor to radio, television, satellites and the internet, with the earth station at Goonhilly Downs a nearby example.

The beach at Poldhu was heavily mined during World War II to prevent any prospect of a German force landing there. As an unfortunate result, on 24 April 1943, Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve members Mair Myfannwy Richards and Reginald Thomas Smith both died instantly when Mair trod on an unmarked mine.

In January 2016, Poldhu Cove was inundated with thousands of pink plastic bottles, brought onto the beach with successive tides. The National Trust, which organised the clean-up, thought they had likely come from a container ship, and had been washed overboard in recent storms.

==Marconi&#x27;s Poldhu Wireless Station==

The site is famous as the location of Poldhu Wireless Station, Guglielmo Marconi&#x27;s transmitter for the first transatlantic radio message on 12 December 1901. Marconi received the transmission on Signal Hill, St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. The station was built partly on cliff top pastures that had been enclosed in 1871 and partly on medieval fields belonging to a nearby settlement, Angrouse. The fifty acre (200,000 m2) plot was bought in 1900 and building work ran from October 1900 to January 1901. During the work two Bronze Age barrows were flattened and a bronze dagger and urn were recovered.

To design the spark transmitter, the first high power radio transmitter in the world, Marconi hired Prof. John Ambrose Fleming, University College, London. The original twenty mast circular aerial was destroyed in a storm on 17 September 1901. Marconi hastily built a temporary aerial of 50 wires suspended in a fan shape from a cable between two 200 foot (61 m) masts. Fleming estimated the transmitter&#x27;s radiated power was around 10–12 kW. The frequency used is not known precisely, as Marconi did not measure wavelength or frequency, but it was between 166 and 984 kHz, probably around 500 kHz. After the experiment the original mast layout was not rebuilt, it was replaced with a four mast design, 215 feet (66 m) high and forming a 200-foot (61 m) square.
Marconi later used the site for his shortwave experiments, with transmissions by Charles Samuel Franklin to Marconi on the yacht in the Cape Verde Islands in 1923 and in Beirut in 1924. The groundbreaking results of these experiments took the world by surprise and quickly resulted in his development of the Beam Wireless Service for the British General Post Office. The service opened from the Bodmin Beam Station to Canada on 25 October 1926, from the to Australia on 8 April 1927, from the to South Africa on 5 July 1927, to India on 6 September 1927 and shortly afterwards to Argentina, Brazil and the United States.

The station closed in 1934 and was demolished in 1937. Six acres (24,000 m2) were given to the National Trust in 1937 with the rest of the site added in 1960. The site has a stone monument pillar, erected in November 1937 by the Marconi Company, and a number of concrete foundations and earth structures also remain. In 2001 the &quot;Marconi Centre&quot;, a new museum / meeting building, was opened close to the site by the efforts of the Poldhu Amateur Radio Club, the National Trust, and Marconi plc.

The substantial building near the site, originally the Poldhu Hotel, built in 1899, is currently a care home. The visitors&#x27; book shows that Marconi stayed there in May and August 1901.

Marconi also built an earlier, smaller, experimental wireless station nearby at Housel Bay – The Lizard Wireless Station.

== In popular culture ==
Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are staying &quot;together in a small cottage near Poldhu Bay&quot; in &quot;The Adventure of the Devil&#x27;s Foot&quot;, a 1910 short story by Arthur Conan Doyle.

In the first episode of the 2018 female-led adaptation &quot;Miss Sherlock&quot;, &quot;Poldhu&quot; is the name of a brand of wireless medical telemetry devices in the form of a capsule that is swallowed by the user, which the murderer exploits as triggers for liquid bombs that destroy the abdominal cavities of her victims.

<doc id="1190670" wikidata="Q944865" url="?curid=1190670" title="Transparency (data compression)">
<text>In data compression and psychoacoustics, transparency is the result of lossy data compression accurate enough that the compressed result is perceptually indistinguishable from the uncompressed input, i.e. perceptually lossless.

A transparency threshold is a given value at which transparency is reached. It is commonly used to describe compressed data bitrates. For example, the transparency threshold for MP3 to linear PCM audio is said to be between 175 and 245 kbit/s, at 44.1 kHz, when encoded as VBR MP3 (corresponding to the -V3 and -V0 settings of the highly popular LAME MP3 encoder). This means that when an MP3 that was encoded at those bitrates is being played back, it is indistinguishable from the original PCM, and the compression is transparent to the listener.

The term &quot;transparent compression&quot; can also refer to a filesystem feature that allows compressed files to be read and written just like regular ones. In this case, the compressor is typically a general-purpose lossless compressor.

==Determination==
Transparency, like sound or video quality, is subjective. It depends most on the listener&#x27;s familiarity with digital artifacts, their awareness that artifacts may in fact be present, and to a lesser extent, the compression method, bit rate used, input characteristics, and the listening/viewing conditions and equipment. Despite this, sometimes general consensus is formed for what compression options &quot;should&quot; provide transparent results for most people on most equipment. Due to the subjectivity and the changing nature of compression, recording, and playback technology, such opinions should be considered only as rough estimates rather than established fact.

Judging transparency can be difficult, due to observer bias, in which subjective like/dislike of a certain compression methodology emotionally influences their judgment. This bias is commonly referred to as &quot;placebo&quot;, although this use is slightly different from the medical use of the term.

To scientifically prove that a compression method is &quot;not&quot; transparent, double-blind tests may be useful. The ABX method is normally used, with a null hypothesis that the samples tested are the same and with an alternative hypothesis that the samples are in fact different.

All lossless data compression methods are transparent, by nature.

=== In image compression ===
Both the DSC in DisplayPort and the default settings of JPEG XL are regarded as &quot;visually lossless&quot;. The losslessness is usually determined by a &quot;flicker&quot; test: the display initially shows the compressed and the original side-by-side, switches them around for a tiny fraction of a second and then goes back to the original. This test is more sensitive than a side-by-side comparison (&quot;visually almost lossless&quot;), as the human eye is highly sensitive to temporal changes in light. There is also a &quot;panning&quot; test that is purportedly more representative of sensitivity in the case of moving images than the &quot;flicker&quot; test.

== Difference from a lack of artifacts ==
A perceptually lossless compression is always free of compression artifacts, but the inverse is not true: it is possible for a compressor to produce a signal that appears natural but with altered contents. Such a confusion is widely present in the field of radiology (specifically for the study of diagnostically acceptable irreversible compression), where &quot;visually lossless&quot; is taken to mean anywhere from artifact-free to being indistinguishable on a side-to-side view, neither being as stringent as the &quot;flicker&quot; test.

<text>Dalneigh (; ) is an area in the city of Inverness in Scotland. Located in the west of the city, it lies between the River Ness and the Caledonian Canal. The name is derived from the Gaelic word &quot;Dail an Eich&quot;, meaning &#x27;Field of the horse&#x27;. As hinted by the name, it was originally a farm, but following the end of the Second World War, it was turned into a residential area to provide housing for the expected increase in demand. Over the following fifty years, successive waves of development saw Dalneigh transformed from farmland into home for thousands of people.

In 1937, Inverness High School was opened in the east of Dalneigh and is still the main secondary school for the area&#x27;s children; the school roll has declined from over one thousand in the 1950s to just under half that today. Dalneigh Primary School is one of Inverness High&#x27;s feeder primaries and is situated in central Dalneigh.

Prior to their merger with Inverness Thistle F.C. in 1994, Caledonian F.C. played at Telford Street Park in the north of Dalneigh, and drew a lot of their support from the area.

Politically, Dalneigh is part of the Highland Council ward of Inverness Central. For elections to the Scottish Parliament, Dalneigh is part of the Inverness and Nairn constituency, and is part of the Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey constituency for elections to the UK Parliament.

<text>Reuven Ramaty (1937—2001) was a Hungarian astrophysicist who worked for 30 years at NASA&#x27;s NASA Goddard Space Flight Centre. He was a leader in the fields of solar physics, gamma-ray line spectrometry, nuclear astrophysics, and low-energy cosmic rays. Ramaty was a founding member of NASA&#x27;s High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager which has now been renamed the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager in his honour. This was the first space mission to be named after a NASA scientist and was operational from 2002 until 2018. The Online Archive of California holds over 400 entries for documents, papers and photographs published by and of Ramaty and his work. Ramaty made many contributions in the field of astrophysics and solar physics. He was given the Goddard Lindsay Award in 1980 and had a tribute dedicated to his work at the University of Maryland in 2000.

== Early life ==
Ramaty was born on February 25, 1937, to two Hungarian parents Michael Miki Reiter and Eliz Ramaty, living in Timișoara, Romania. In 1948, when he was 11 years old, he moved with his family to Israel to escape growing cultural tensions and economic difficulties following the Second World War. He became the stepson of Gizi Reiter after her marriage to his father. Ramaty remained in Israel for 16 years, where he finished his secondary education and graduated from Tel Aviv University in 1961 with a Bachelor of Science in physics. Ramaty taught physics at a secondary level in Israel before his move to Los Angeles. During his life, Ramaty learnt a total of 8 languages (Hebrew, English, French, Romanian, Hungarian, German, Japanese and Italian).

== Education ==
In 1964 Ramaty enrolled into the University of California, Los Angeles where he pursued his PhD on planetary and space physics. Ramaty completed his PhD from UCLA in the record time of two years in 1966. Ramaty then joined the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in 1967 as a post-doctoral research associate. During his career, Ramaty remained active in tertiary education institutions as he was an adjunct professor of physics at the University of Maryland from 1983, where he served as a PhD advisor for six students. Other roles in tertiary education include his time on the doctoral dissertation committee at both the University of Paris (1992) as well as the Pierre and Marie Curie University (1997). Ramaty was also a visiting professor at Nagoya University (1993) and a visiting scientist at California Institute of Technology, Stanford University, University of California Berkeley, University of California San Diego, University of Pennsylvania and Washington University in St. Louis.

== Notable work ==
Ramaty was a postdoctoral research associate (Laboratory for High-Energy Astrophysics), Astrophysicist (Laboratory for High-Energy Astrophysics), Head of Theory Office (Laboratory for High-Energy Astrophysics), Associate Editor for Physical Review Letters, chairman of the American Physical Society (Astrophysics division), Chairman of the American Physical Society (High-Energy Astronomy Division) and Divisional counselor for astrophysics for the American Physical Society (APS). His most notable work was carried out at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, where he worked for over 30 years.

Ramaty was one of the leading scientists in the field of gamma-ray line astronomy and solar flare physics, cosmic rays and flare-accelerated particles. His work has contributed a wealth of information to the literature in the astrophysical field with over 200 published works under his name and with over 5,000 citations to his works as of 2001, He is credited with studies regarding the observation of high-energy nuclear reactions in solar flares, as well as the use of gamma-ray line observations of flare-accelerated particles to determine their specific properties. The use of gamma-ray line astronomy at the time was new to the field, as it had not been a tool for observing low-energy cosmic rays in interstellar space. With the help of Ramaty&#x27;s work and his contributions to the field, the observation of Doppler broadening and shape details in nucleosynthesis events are now possible with the RHESSI solar imager and The Compton Observatory. In addition to this, his work on flare-accelerated particles from energetic solar particle events built the foundation for the magnetohydrodynamic simulations which are used to resolve new paradoxes regarding these particles. Having used these simulations. Ramaty&#x27;s findings have been successfully compared with today&#x27;s observations. Recent observations within the NASA RHESSI project show his early calculations on low-energy cosmic ray lines and theories on solar flare emissions to be accurate and consistent.

Following the initial discoveries of these observations, Ramaty spent 30 years refining his findings with the Solar Maximum Mission along with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. This effort was carried out mainly with the help of Benz Kozlovsky of Tel Aviv University, Ramaty&#x27;s alma mater. Their discoveries would then lead to Ramaty&#x27;s theory on the origin of low-energy cosmic rays, now generally accepted within the physics community.

Another notable field of study which Ramaty engaged in was the field of gamma-ray line astronomy, where he published seminal works regarding positron annihilation radiation and studies into nucleosynthetic decay and nuclear de-excitation lines. More of this work, with detailed analysis and presentations of his findings, can be found in the article &quot;Gamma Ray Lines: A New Window to the Universe&quot;, co-authored by Ramaty. The study of positron annihilation radiation and nucleosynthetic decay is used in order to understand band structure and Fermi surfaces in metals.

Ramaty&#x27;s observations of low-energy cosmic rays follow the findings of R. M. Hjellming in order to build upon our understanding of their origins and how they may be observed and imaged with the RHESSI mission and observatories across the world. Ramaty&#x27;s findings have greatly contributed to the literature in this field of science and current work credits his papers as crucial research.

Richard E. Lingenfelter says,

&quot;The most notable of those studies was their prediction of interstellar gamma-ray emission in the 1.809-MeV line from the decay of supernova-produced aluminium-26, which was subsequently found with instruments on HEAO-C in 1982 to be the most intense nucleosynthetic line in the Galaxy.&quot;

Ramaty&#x27;s work has been recognized by NASA through his continual efforts and dedication to the field and has honored him with the renaming of the HESSI mission to RHESSI, making it the first NASA mission to be named after a researcher. Ramaty was a crucial part in starting the initiative, and his colleagues note that without his presence, the mission would never have been founded or put into action. RHESSI is the sixth Small Explorer mission from NASA and was launched on February 5 in 2005. [1] NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center Laboratory for Astronomy &amp; Solar Physics review from July 2001 to June 2002 has also mentioned Ramaty&#x27;s work and states:

&quot;Reuven Ramaty, a GSFC astrophysicist who died in March 2001. Ramaty had a long and distinguished career in the Laboratory for High-Energy Astrophysics developing much of the theoretical framework for solar gamma-ray line spectroscopy. He was a founding member of the original HESSI team, and his active involvement and enthusiastic support were critical to the realization of HESSI and its selection by NASA for launch during the current maximum in solar activity. This is the first time that a spacecraft has been named after a NASA scientist, and this great honor was recognized at a GSFC ceremony on May 17, 2002.&quot;

== Achievements ==
During his life, Ramaty received a number of significant awards for his work in physics. In 1975 he was awarded the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation the Senior U.S. Scientist Award, the Exceptional Scientific Achievement Award in 1980 from Nasa, Lindsay Award from Goddard Space Flight Centre in 1981 and the 2001 Yodh lifetime Prize just a week before his death. These awards were given mainly for his work with Cosmic Rays and the efforts he put into the literature itself as well as the expansion of knowledge in the field. On December 11, 2000, the University of Maryland hosted &quot;A tribute to Reuven Ramaty&#x27;s Contributions to High- Energy Solar Physics and Astronomy&quot; which celebrated his works in the field of solar physics as well as acknowledging contributions to his work with solar flare emissions throughout his time at the university.

== Notable academic papers and reception ==
The Online Archive of California holds a collection of Ramaty&#x27;s papers. These documents serve as a documentation of his professional career and the work that he carried out as an astrophysicist for the Goddard Space Flight Centre for over 30 years. These works include scientific writings, articles, books, research proposals and proposals for scientific research missions. Beyond his scientific work at Goddard Space Flight Center, the archive also documents conferences organised by Ramaty. As of 2020, there are over 400 documents in The Online Archive of California on Ramaty&#x27;s work and remains readily accessible to those who visit the Library of Congress institutions across the U.S.

Ramaty&#x27;s most notable work includes the early predictions and observations of low energy metagalactic cosmic rays which were first published in 1971 and co-authored by Lennard A. Fisk at the Goddard Space Flight Centre. The paper is a foundation on which later findings on low-energy cosmic rays was built on as Ramaty applied previous understandings of universal cosmic ray models produced by Giancarlo Setti. Using this work, Ramaty continued to pursue his studies in low energy cosmic rays and has published multiple papers on the subject, five of which are available on The Online Archive of California. His early work in the field has been credited by Richard Lingenfelter, Neil Gehris and Thomas L. Cline as essential for the current discoveries being made through the RHESSI project. In 1973 Ramaty published his first paper on solar flare nuclear gamma rays where he discussed the observations of gamma-ray line emissions from solar flares and gave estimations in spectrum quantity and proton counts from solar flares through these observations. This work in solar flare emissions is reflected in his later papers from 1973 to 1989, which allowed for closer observations to be made following the launch of the RHESSI project in 2002.

== Death ==
Ramaty died on April 8 2001 (age 64) in his home in Silver Spring, Maryland, due to complications with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Reuven now rests at the Rockville Judean Cemetery near Olney, Maryland. His wife, two children and extended family lives in Silver Spring, Maryland.

<text>The Minister of Food Control (1916–1921) and the Minister of Food (1939–1958) were British government ministerial posts separated from that of the Minister of Agriculture. In the Great War the Ministry sponsored a network of canteens known as National Kitchens. In the Second World War a major task of the Ministry was to oversee rationing in the United Kingdom arising out of World War II. The Minister was assisted by a Parliamentary Secretary. The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Food and Animal Welfare (2018–present; vacant since 2019) was appointed at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to ensure the continued supply of sufficient food during the Brexit process.

The ministry&#x27;s work was transferred in 1921 to the Board of Trade which had a small Food Department between the wars. This became its Food (Defence Plans) Department in 1937 and was then constituted as the Ministry of Food on the outbreak of war in 1939.

&quot;Jamie&#x27;s Ministry of Food&quot; was a 2008 UK TV programme featuring celebrity chef Jamie Oliver that aimed to recreate the successes of the Ministry of Food in encouraging healthy eating.
==Second World War==

In April 1940 Lord Woolton, a prominent businessman, was appointed Minister of Food by Neville Chamberlain, one of a number of ministerial appointments from outside politics. Woolton retained this position until 1943. He supervised 50,000 employees and over a thousand local offices where people could obtain ration cards. His ministry had a virtual monopoly of all food sold in Britain, whether imported or local. His mission was to guarantee adequate nutrition for everyone. With food supplies cut sharply because of enemy action and the needs of the services, rationing was essential. Woolton and his advisors had one scheme in mind but economists convinced them to try point rationing. Everyone would have a certain number of points a month that they could allocate any way they wanted. They tried an experiment and it worked very well. Indeed, food rationing was a major success story in Britain&#x27;s war.

In the dark days of late June 1940, with a German invasion threatened, Woolton reassured the public that emergency food stocks were in place that would last &quot;for weeks and weeks&quot; even if the shipping could not get through. He said &quot;iron rations&quot; were stored for use only in great emergency. Other rations were stored in the outskirts of cities liable to German bombing. When the Blitz began in late summer 1940 he was ready with more than 200 feeding stations in London and other cities under attack.

Woolton was faced with the task of overseeing rationing due to wartime shortages. He took the view that it was insufficient to merely impose restrictions but that a programme of advertising to support it was also required. He warned that meat and cheese, as well as bacon and eggs, were in very short supply and would remain that way. Calling for a simpler diet, he noted that there was plenty of bread, potatoes, vegetable oils, fats and milk. He asked the mathematician Martin Roseveare to design the ration books.

In 1940 Woolton set up Advice Centres throughout the country, with cookery demonstrations and recipe leaflets showing how to make the best use of rations. As imported wheat became scarce, the cartoon character &#x27;Potato Pete&#x27; encouraged people to eat more potatoes.

By January 1941 the usual overseas food supply had fallen to half what it had been. However, by 1942 ample food supplies were arriving through Lend Lease from the U.S. and a similar Canadian programme. Lend Lease was a gift and there was no charge. Most food was now rationed. Worried about children, Lord Woolton made sure that by 1942 Britain was providing 650,000 children with free meals at schools; about 3,500,000 children received milk at school, in addition to priority supplies at home. The bad news was that his &quot;national loaf&quot; of mushy grey wholemeal bread replaced the ordinary white variety, to the distaste of most housewives. Children were sad to learn that supplies of sweets were reduced to save shipping space on sugar and chocolate.

Woolton kept food prices down; eggs and other items were subsidised. He promoted recipes that worked well with the rationing system, most famously the meatless &quot;Woolton pie&quot; which consisted of carrots, parsnips, potatoes and turnips in oatmeal, with a pastry or potato crust and served with brown gravy. Woolton&#x27;s business skills made the Ministry of Food&#x27;s difficult job a success and he earned a strong personal popularity despite the shortages.

<doc id="1190681" wikidata="Q4711055" url="?curid=1190681" title="Albert R.N.">
<text>Albert R.N. is a 1953 British war film directed by Lewis Gilbert and starring Jack Warner, Anthony Steel and Robert Beatty. It was based on the 1952 play of the same title by Guy Morgan and Edward Sammis.

==Plot==
An escape tunnel for the naval officer prisoners during the Second World War at a German prisoner-of-war camp is discovered.

Lieutenant Ainsworth devises a scheme with the escape committee to use the components of a mannequin named Albert to convince the Germans that all prisoners sent outside the camp for a bathhouse wash up are returned to the camp. A piece of Albert is smuggled with the prisoners going to the bathhouse and reassembled for the return. Ainsworth also has a woman pen pal he has never seen; he plans to marry her once he is free. Though the originator has the right to try out his own idea, Ainsworth insists that his hut mates draw cards for the privilege; Erickson wins and gets away.

After waiting a while, they decide to reuse the ploy. This time, Ainsworth&#x27;s friend, after hearing that his pen pal has not written in a while, sees to it that the draw is rigged so that he wins. Ainsworth auctions his place, only to have Captain Maddox, the senior prisoner of war, order him to go. Ainsworth is recaptured the same day. Later, the camp commandant informs the men that Erickson was shot while resisting arrest by the Gestapo; his ashes are handed over.

When SS Schultz expresses interest in American Lieutenant &quot;Texas&quot; Norton&#x27;s chronometer, Norton notes Schultz is in charge of the camp&#x27;s boundary lights and asks him to see that they malfunction during the next Allied night bombing raid in exchange for the chronometer, but it is a trap. Schultz signals his men to turn the lights back on while Norton is cutting through the barbed wire fence, then shoots him down in cold blood.

Schultz tries to suborn Ainsworth but Ainsworth tells him he will see to it he is prosecuted for murder after the war. When Schultz becomes the new , Ainsworth insists on trying to escape again, using Albert. He gets away but waits at night to confront Schultz outside the camp. After a struggle, he gets Schultz&#x27;s pistol. When Allied bombs drop uncomfortably close by, Schultz runs for it. Ainsworth is unable to bring himself to shoot the fleeing German in the back but a bomb kills him. Ainsworth takes back Norton&#x27;s chronometer from the dead man and walks away.

==Historical background==
The film is based on a true story. &quot;Albert R.N.&quot; was a dummy constructed in Marlag O, the prisoner of war camp in northern Germany for naval officers. The head was sculpted by war artist John Worsley (1919–2000), the body by Lieutenant Bob Staines RNVR, and Lieutenant-Commander Tony Bentley-Buckle devised a mechanism enabling Albert&#x27;s eyes to blink and move, adding realism to the dummy. &quot;Albert&quot; was used as a stand-in for a head count while a prisoner escaped and was used on two occasions. In the first attempt Lieutenant William &quot;Blondie&quot; Mewes RNVR escaped from the camp shower block and the skilful use of &quot;Albert&quot; during roll-calls gave him four days head start before a missing PoW was reported. Mewes was recaptured in Lübeck and returned to Marlag camp. The second occasion failed when the escaping PoW was discovered hiding in the camp shower block and &quot;Albert&quot; was discovered in the subsequent searches.

Worsley made a new &quot;Albert&quot; for use in the film. Senior Commissioned Gunner (TAS) Lieutenant John William Goble RN aided Worsley in the development of &quot;Albert&quot; in the POW camp, Marlag O and acted as technical adviser for the film. Worsley made a third &quot;Albert&quot; for the retrospective exhibition of his work held in Brighton College&#x27;s Burstow Gallery. After the show, it was donated to the Royal Naval Museum Portsmouth. Guy Morgan and Edward Sammis, who were British POWs, wrote a play based on the story on which this film was based. This was subsequently adapted into a screenplay.

==Production==
The film was first planned as a project for Romulus Productions and star Sonny Tufts (as an American film star), Trevor Howard, Anton Walbrook and Ralph Richardson. Jack Warner and Anthony Steel were both leased to producer Daniel Angel by the Rank Organisation. Both had previously appeared in POW movies, &quot;The Captive Heart&quot; (1946) and &quot;The Wooden Horse&quot; (1950) respectively, and had just made &quot;Emergency Call&quot; together. Steel frequently made war films in support of an older British actor. A POW camp was built on Headley Heath. At one stage the film was going to be called &quot;The Spare Man&quot;.

==Release==
Lewis Gilbert said the film earned its money back in the United Kingdom. &quot;Variety&quot; on 21 October 1953, page 181, described it as &quot;Well-done British-made prison meller, lacks names for U.S. market&quot;, and went on to say, &quot;A solid all-round cast admirably fits into the plot. Anthony Steel handsomely suggests the young artist responsible for the creation of &#x27;Albert&#x27; and Jack Warner is reliably cast as the senior British officer who maintains discipline with understanding in the camp. Robert Beatty, William Sylvester and Guy Middleton are among the principal POWs. Frederick Valk is a sympathetic camp commandant, but Anton Diffring suggests the typical ruthless Nazi type.&quot;

<text>Wheatley Provincial Park is a protected area in the municipality of Chatham–Kent in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. It is located on Lake Erie near the community of Wheatley and occupies an area of . Visitors to nearby Point Pelee National Park often camp at the park.

A number of small creeks flow through the park which provide opportunities for canoeing and viewing waterfowl, though over the past 10 years the inlet and creeks that dominate the park have mostly dried up. The park has four campgrounds: Boosey Creek, Highlands, Middle Creek and Two Creeks, offering both electrical and non-electrical campsites as well as group camping and radio-free camping.

<text>The Ministry of Information (MOI), headed by the Minister of Information, was a United Kingdom government department created briefly at the end of the First World War and again during the Second World War. Located in Senate House at the University of London during the 1940s, it was the central government department responsible for publicity and propaganda. The MOI was dissolved in March 1946, with its residual functions passing to the Central Office of Information (COI); which was itself dissolved in December 2011 due to the reforming of the organisation of government communications.

==First World War==
Before the Lloyd George War Cabinet was formed in 1917, there was no full centralised coordination of public information and censorship. Even under the War Cabinet, there were still many overlapping departments involved. The Admiralty, War Office and Press Committee (AWOPC) had been formed in 1912 as a purely advisory body, chaired initially by the Secretary of the Admiralty Sir Graham Greene, the press having agreed to self-censor accordingly in matters of defence and secret intelligence. When war was declared, other newly formed departments overlapped with it and with each other.

These included the British Board of Film Censors for films, the Propaganda Bureau for overseas information and propaganda (to counter the existing German equivalent), the National War Aims Committee for internal information and propaganda, the Neutral Press Committee dealing with neutral countries, and the Press Bureau (absorbing but not totally replacing many of the AWOPC functions and practices, albeit with much wider focus).

The Propaganda Bureau, situated in Wellington House and chaired by Charles Masterman, opened in 1914 and recruited 25 well-known authors for its work, including John Buchan, but in 1917 it was re-formed into the Department of Information under Buchan, with Masterman retaining responsibility for books, pamphlets, photographs and war paintings. Later that year that department was renamed as a ministry and placed initially under the then Minister without Portfolio, Sir Edward Carson, and subsequently in early 1918 under a senior press figure, Lord Beaverbrook. This was widely perceived and criticised, in politics and the press, as an excessive attempt by Lloyd George to control the press, as was political use of the Defence of the Realm Act 1914.

Wrangling between different interests continued for the remainder of the war and even afterwards, the Press Bureau becoming the main focus of discontent and negotiation between owners/editors and ministers. The Press Bureau did eventually in 1918 formulate guidelines for handling information in wartime, which were later used in 1938 in creating the Second World War Ministry of Information. Some forms of wartime censorship continued until 1920, by when the became again the main interface for political/press publication of defence and secret intelligence matters.

=== Ministers of Information 1918–1919 ===
Colour key (for political parties):

==Second World War==
The Ministry of Information (MOI) was formed on 4 September 1939, the day after Britain&#x27;s declaration of war, and the first minister was sworn into Office on 5 September 1939.

The ministry&#x27;s function was &quot;To promote the national case to the public at home and abroad in time of war&quot; by issuing &quot;National Propaganda&quot; and controlling news and information. It was initially responsible for censorship, issuing official news, home publicity and overseas publicity in Allied and neutral countries. These functions were matched by a responsibility for monitoring public opinion through a network of regional information offices. Responsibility for publicity in enemy territories was organised by Department EH (later part of the Special Operations Executive).

=== Pre-War planning, 1935–38 ===
Secret planning for a Ministry of Information (MOI) had started in October 1935 under the auspices of the Committee of Imperial Defence (CID). Draft proposals were accepted on 27 July 1936 and Sir Stephen Tallents was appointed as Director General Designate. Tallents drew together a small group of planners from existing government departments, public bodies and specialist outside organisations.

The MOI&#x27;s planners sought to combine experience gained during the First World War with new communications technology. Their work reflected an increasing concern that a future war would exert huge strain on the civilian population and a belief that government propaganda would be needed to maintain morale. However it was hindered by competing visions for the ministry, a requirement for secrecy which disrupted the making of key appointments, and the reluctance of many government departments to give up their public relations divisions to central control.

=== The Ministry of Information and the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, 1938–39 ===
The shadow Ministry of Information came into being briefly between 26 September and 3 October 1938 after the Nazi annexation of the Sudetenland (German occupation of Czechoslovakia) heightened international tensions. The 71 officials who were assembled in temporary accommodation had responsibility for censoring press reports surrounding the Munich Agreement.

The week-long experiment was not regarded as a success. Instead it highlighted the extent to which questions over appointments, accommodation, links to the media and the relationship with other government departments had been left unresolved. The confusion had been made worse by tensions between the shadow MOI and the Foreign Office News Department. This tension spilled over into the Committee for Imperial Defence which considered proposals to abandon plans for the Ministry of Information.

Tallents left his post as Director General Designate on 2 January 1939 (with responsibility for the MOI assumed by the Home Office). Planning efforts would increase again after Nazi troops moved into Prague on 15 March 1939 (German occupation of Czechoslovakia). The British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain publicly announced his government&#x27;s intentions for the MOI in a parliamentary speech on 15 June 1939. Home Office officials were privately given until 31 December 1939 to complete their plans.

=== The Phoney War, 1939–40 ===
The Ministry of Information (MOI) was formed on 4 September 1939, the day after Britain&#x27;s declaration of war, and Lord Macmillan was sworn in as its first minister on 5 September 1939. The MOI&#x27;s headquarters were housed within the University of London&#x27;s Senate House and would remain there for the rest of the war.

The MOI was initially organised in four groups. A &quot;Press Relations&quot; group was responsible for both the issue of news and censorship. A &quot;Publicity Users&quot; group (split into &quot;foreign&quot; and &quot;home&quot; sections) was responsible for propaganda policy. A &quot;Publicity Producers&quot; group (split according to media) was responsible for design and production. These were overseen by a &quot;Co-ordination and Intelligence&quot; group responsible for administration. This structure had only been finalised in May–June 1940 and senior officials were often unsure about their responsibilities.

The press reacted negatively to the MOI. Initial confusion between the MOI and service departments led to accusations that the MOI was delaying access to the news, and a newspaper campaign against censorship was started. Other commentators pointed to the ministry&#x27;s large staff and satirised it as ineffective and out of touch. The MOI&#x27;s first publicity campaign also misfired with a poster bearing the message &quot;Your Courage, Your Cheerfulness, Your Resolution, Will Bring Us Victory&quot; criticised for appearing class-bound. These factors led to political scrutiny and resulted in the removal of the Press Relations Group on 9 October 1939 (which became an autonomous Press and Censorship Bureau) and an announcement on 25 October 1939 that the MOI&#x27;s staff was to be cut by a third.

Lord Macmillan was replaced as minister by Sir John Reith on 5 January 1940. Reith sought to improve the MOI&#x27;s governance, expanded its network of regional information offices and introduced a Home Intelligence division. He also sought to secure the reintegration of the Press and Censorship Division in the belief that the decision to separate this function had been &quot;obviously and monstrously ridiculous and wrong&quot;. These changes were announced by Neville Chamberlain on 24 April 1940 but were not fully operational until June 1940.

=== The Battle of Britain, 1940 ===
Chamberlain&#x27;s resignation and replacement by Winston Churchill on 10 May 1940 resulted in Reith being sacked and the appointment of Duff Cooper. Cooper was closely allied to Churchill and had openly criticised the previous government&#x27;s approach.

Nazi advances in Western Europe encouraged the Ministry of Information (MOI) to increasingly focus on domestic propaganda after May 1940. A Home Publicity Emergency Committee was set up to issue public instructions about air raids, parachute raids and what to do in the event of an invasion. Concurrent campaigns extolled the public to &quot;Avoid Rumour&quot; and join a &quot;Silent Column&quot; so that they would avoid passing information to spies. However, as the situation stabilised, these campaigns were increasingly criticised for treating the public with contempt.

The MOI was subject to further criticism in July 1940 when it was accused of using &quot;Gestapo&quot; tactics to spy on the British public. Popular newspapers seized on reports about MOI-sponsored opinion polling and denounced the department&#x27;s staff as &quot;Cooper&#x27;s Snoopers&quot;. Home Intelligence reports recorded complaints from those who felt that the British state was &quot;becoming dangerously akin to the one we are fighting&quot;. The cost of such activities was also queried in Parliament.

Cooper was forced to confront further questions regarding the news and was dogged by accusations that he wanted to enforce a system of compulsory censorship. His failed attempt to increase the MOI&#x27;s control over public relations divisions in other departments also drew him into conflict with Churchill. After two months of internal wrangling, it was reported that Cooper was to be replaced as Minister by Brendan Bracken on 17 July 1941.

=== Later stages of the War, 1941–45 ===
The Ministry of Information (MOI) settled down during Bracken&#x27;s tenure. Supported by Churchill and the press, Bracken remained in office until after Victory in Europe Day.

One of Bracken&#x27;s main achievements was to promote a closer working relationship with other government departments. Plans to increase control over public relations divisions in other departments were duly dropped and closer co-operation sought in their place. Bracken&#x27;s experience as a newspaper proprietor encouraged a similar approach with regard to the press and he maintained that the MOI should not impinge upon the right to free speech.

Bracken was keen to promote a more limited role in the field of domestic propaganda. He insisted that the MOI should stop &quot;lecturing&quot; the public and publicly questioned its ability to &quot;stimulate British Morale&quot;. The MOI was instead encouraged to provide background information to particular events whilst providing technical support to other departments. Bracken also insisted that the MOI should be dissolved at the end of the war with Germany and that its activities made it inappropriate to peacetime conditions.

=== Post War, 1945–46 ===
The MOI was dissolved in March 1946, with its residual functions passing to the Central Office of Information (COI), a central organisation providing common and specialist information services.

=== Campaigns ===
Campaigns carried out included themes such as the following:
*The Home Front
*Production – Salvage
*Allied Unity
*The Fighting Forces
*Personalities

=== Working practices ===
For home publicity, the ministry dealt with the planning of general government or interdepartmental information, and provided common services for public relations activities of other government departments. The Home Publicity division undertook three main types of campaigns: those requested by other government departments, specific regional campaigns, and those it initiated itself. Before undertaking a campaign, the MOI would ensure that propaganda was not being used as a substitute for other activities, including legislation.

The General Production Division (GPD), one of the few divisions to remain in place throughout the war, undertook technical work under Edwin Embleton. The GPD often produced work in as little as a week or a fortnight, when normal commercial practice was three months. Artists were not in a reserved occupation and were liable for call up for military service along with everyone else. Many were recalled from the services to work for the ministry in 1942, a year in which £4 million was spent on publicity, approximately a third more than in 1941. £120,000 of this was spent on posters, art and exhibitions. Of the many officially employed war artists, several, including Eric Kennington, Paul Nash and William Rothenstein, were war artists during both World Wars. Many extra designs were prepared to cope with short lead-times and the changing events of war. Through the Home intelligence Division, the MOI collected reactions to general wartime morale and, in some cases, specifically to publicity produced.

Dylan Thomas, frustrated at being declared unfit to join the armed forces, contacted Sir Kenneth Clark, director of the films division of the Ministry of Information, and offered his services. Although not directly employed by the MOI, he scripted at least five films in 1942 with titles such as &quot;This Is Colour&quot; (about dye); &quot;New Towns for Old&quot;; &quot;These Are the Men&quot;; &quot;Our Country&quot; (a sentimental tour of Britain), and &quot;The Art of Conversation&quot;.

===Current research===
A major four-year Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) funded research project on the &quot;Communications History of the Ministry of Information&quot; began in January 2014. The project is led by Professor Simon Eliot of the School of Advanced Study at the University of London and Paul Vetch of the Department of Digital Humanities at King&#x27;s College London. A project website called MOI Digital was launched on 24 June 2014.

Henry Irving and Judith Townend have drawn parallels between information censorship in Britain during World War II and contemporary restrictions in reporting trials that relate to terrorism offences, such as the case of &quot;R v Incedal and Rarmoul-Bouhadjar&quot; (2014).

<text>The Isle of Wight Central Railway (IoWCR) was a railway company on the Isle of Wight, United Kingdom. It was formed in 1887 by the merging of three earlier railways, the Cowes and Newport Railway (opened 1862), the Ryde and Newport Railway (opened 1875) and the Isle of Wight (Newport Junction) Railway (opened in stages 1875 and 1879).

Its network ran from near Ryde to Cowes and from Sandown to Newport. It also worked the Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway until 1913, and in that year it purchased the Newport, Godshill and St. Lawrence Railway.

The was always short of money, and operated with antiquated equipment. The heavily seasonal traffic and, later, competition from buses and cars limited profitable income.

In 1923, it was absorbed by the new Southern Railway, and the new owner put financial resources into worthwhile modernisation, but by the 1960s the financial situation became difficult and the whole of the former network was closed in 1966. The Isle of Wight Steam Railway now operates on part of the line.

==First railways==
Early in the nineteenth century, the Isle of Wight was chiefly involved in agriculture; there was industrial activity in Newport, and Ryde was an established town. Cowes and Ryde both had ferry services from the mainland, but Cowes, on the River Medina, was dominant because of the better harbour there.

During the railway mania of the 1840s, it was proposed that railways should be built on the island to develop tourism, which was then beginning to become an important economic activity, as well as to handle the agriculture and other produce of the island. A number of schemes were put forward but failed to gain support, until in 1858 bills for three railway projects were submitted to Parliament; they were:

* The Isle of Wight Railway (Eastern Section), intended to run from Ryde to Upper Bonchurch, with branches to Brading and Shanklin, and a tramway to Ryde Pier;
* The Isle of Wight Railway; to run from Cowes to Ryde via Newport, with branches to Ventnor and Ryde Pier;
* The Cowes and Newport Railway.
The first two were rejected in the House of Lords&#x27; Committee, and only the Cowes and Newport Railway was authorised. The (22 &amp; 23 Vict. c. xciv) obtained royal assent on 8 August 1859.

===Cowes and Newport Railway===
The Cowes and Newport Railway (C&amp;NR) was to be in length, running north to south along the west side of the River Medina. The authorised share capital was £30,000 ().

A construction contract was let to Albert H. Fernandez, and the first sod was cut on 15 October 1859. The construction had been thought to be simple, but in fact the nature of the ground and the wet weather made the work extremely difficult. In December 1861, the contractor had to give up the work, and the company continued for a period managing the work directly. The itself had financial difficulties as the authorised share issue was considerably undersubscribed. The Cowes station abutted Cross Street, where there was a level crossing, over which the line continued as a tramway; engine run-round movements had to cross the level crossing and use the tramway, contrary to stipulations in the Cowes and Newport (Isle of Wight) Railway Act 1859 (22 &amp; 23 Vict. c. xciv). (The was later authorised to enlarge the station and close Cross Street. This work was done in early 1879).

Captain Tyler of the Board of Trade inspected the line for passenger operation in May 1862, but found numerous deficiencies and recommended that the authorisation for opening be declined. He returned on 14 June 1862 and this time everything was in order; the line opened on 16 June 1862; passenger traffic only was carried for some time after opening; there were eight trains each way on weekdays. Notice boards at the Newport station made it clear that onward conveyance to London, via Cowes and Southampton, was a primary objective.

The line was operated by a contractor, Henry Martin, for 50% of gross receipts at first, later 50% of net receipts.
A wharf known as Medina Wharf was built adjoining the river between Cowes and Newport in 1877–78. Writing in 1962 Rickard said that the Medina Wharf was then the sole means of entry for coal to the island.

===Isle of Wight Railway===

The business interests on the east coast of the island continued to put forward a scheme based in Ryde. The Cowes and Newport Railway proposed an extension from Newport, Isle of Wight to Ryde and Ventnor, forming a large triangle, and to rename their company the Isle of Wight Railway. The promoters of the Isle of Wight (Eastern Section) Railway (IoW(ES)R) resubmitted their scheme too. The Cowes and Newport bill failed standing orders, and although there was some opposition to it, the was authorised by the Isle of Wight Eastern Section Railway Act 1860 (23 &amp; 24 Vict. c. clxii) on 23 July 1860. In 1863, by the Isle of Wight Railway&#x27;s (Extensions) Act 1863 (26 &amp; 27 Vict. c. ccxxxii), it changed its name to the Isle of Wight Railway (IoWR); it opened between St John&#x27;s Road station in Ryde and on 23 August 1864 and on to on 10 September 1866.

This had a significant effect in shifting the route for trade access to the island: in February 1868 the Cowes and Newport Railway directors reported that their company&#x27;s earnings were static following the opening of the ; travellers forsook the Southampton and Cowes route in favour of Portsmouth and Ryde. Cowes railway station was inconveniently up a steep hill from the ferry port.

===Isle of Wight (Newport Junction) Railway===
From 1861, the pace of proposing further railways on the island accelerated. Some accepted that only one further line was commercially viable, but there was little agreement about its possible course. Nonetheless connecting Newport to the east coast was considered an important objective.

In 1868, three bills came to Parliament; they were considered to be mutually exclusive, and over a very lengthy hearing evidence was given in favour of each, and against its presumed competitors. The dominance of the Portsmouth–Ryde ferry route had not yet been established, and in any case Cowes was assumed to be the port of entry for goods and minerals. The (31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. clxxxi) was given royal assent on 31 July 1868, to build a line from Newport to the Sandown station of the Isle of Wight Railway.

The competing proposals were rejected; those who favoured a line from Newport to Ryde were disappointed, and continued the struggle.

====Building the Isle of Wight (Newport Junction) Railway====
The authorised capital of the Newport Junction line was £84,000, but it was not planned to pass through any major population centre that was not already rail-connected, and the company found it difficult to raise the money it needed for construction. Moreover, successive resignations of directors made continuity of progress difficult. The first sod was finally cut at Shide on 14 October 1870. Early in 1871, a prospectus was published offering preference shares, although the company was not authorised to issue these, and this was soon followed by acrimonious and public name-calling between the company and the Corporation of Newport.

In 1872, the line between Sandown and Horringford was thought to be ready for opening, and on 20 June Colonel Yolland of the Board of Trade visited the line to carry out the inspection for passenger operation; as well as finding a considerable number of detail shortcomings, he was very critical of the rails. There were second-hand double-headed rails formerly in use on the London and South Western Railway. They had been inverted on the LSWR line, using the second running table. The rails were badly galled by the chairs and there were splits and bulges in the head. They had been cropped to , and the head wear was not matched, so that the joints were uneven. The fishplate bolts were not long enough in many cases.

Approval to open the line to passenger traffic was refused; the company tried to appeal against this, but failed; subsequent inspection visits took place on 31 July, 28 August and 26 September 1872, without success. Creditors demanded payment, and one unfortunate contractor went into bankruptcy, having accepted the company&#x27;s shares in payment: those shares were now worthless. In December 1872 it was calculated that the company had expended £77,490 and had nothing to show for it; and the line was now estimated to require £90,548 to complete.

Against this background the Isle of Wight (Newport Junction) Railway (IoW(NJ)R) had obtained a further act of Parliament, the (35 &amp; 36 Vict. c. clxix), in August 1872, authorising additional capital as well as certain deviations and extensions. Somehow work proceeded, and in July 1874 Colonel Rich of the Board of Trade visited the Sandown to Horringford line; the bad rails seem to have been changed but Rich again refused sanction to open the line due to other faults. Further attention was given and in January 1875 Colonel Rich inspected the line from Sandown to Shide and found it satisfactory,

The company opened its line on 1 February 1875; in public announcements the company referred to the Shide station as &quot;Newport&quot;. The company started running passenger trains on to Pan Lane at Newport, from 11 August 1875, but this was without permission from the Board of Trade: in effect illegally; Colonel Hutchinson visited for the necessary inspection on 6 October 1875, and on the company promising to rectify a number of issues, the running to Pan Lane continued. (The company sometimes used Pan Mill as the station name at first.) There were nine trains each way on weekdays.

===Ryde and Newport Railway===

The operation of the Isle of Wight Railway enhanced the importance of Ryde as the port of entry to the island, and it soon became more important than Cowes, particularly for passengers. 300,000 people travelled between Newport and Ryde annually, and the road coaches were not convenient. The necessity of connecting Newport revived the idea of a railway between them, and on 25 July 1872 the Ryde and Newport Railway (R&amp;NR) was authorised by an act of Parliament, the (35 &amp; 36 Vict. c. cxxxv). The share capital was £65,000.

The Isle of Wight Railway (IoWR) agreed to the using its line to get access to Ryde, and to its station there, in exchange for running powers for the between Ryde and Newport.

A contract for the construction was awarded to Barnett and Gale on 1 October 1872. Instead of building its own line into Ryde, it arranged with the Isle of Wight Railway to join it at Smallbrook, a little over south of St John&#x27;s Road; trains were to run to Ryde on track provided by the .

A temporary connection was laid in at Smallbrook to assist in the delivery of materials for construction purposes. Work continued rapidly, but early in 1874 Barnett and Gale got into financial difficulties, and the contract was transferred to J &amp; G Taylor. The construction and land acquisition expended much of the company&#x27;s available cash, and a director, George Young, personally made money available to continue. In 1875, the railway company obtained authorisation to raise additional share capital (in fact, the £30,000 of preference shares could only be sold at a 30% discount).

The original Cowes and Newport Railway station at Newport had been a very basic construction, and it had always been the intention to construct a new station for the use of the , the and the ; this involved agreeing on the crossing of the Medina at Newport with the borough corporation, and apportioning the costs. This took some time and the bridge, to be a swing bridge, was agreed in January 1875. By this time the line had been completed to the end of the bridge location. When completed, the bridge was operated manually by windlass; the two tracks could be opened individually and there was a long approach viaduct.

The laid a second track alongside its own from Smallbrook to Ryde. There was to be no operational junction at this stage, and the two companies each were to work over one of the two single lines.

Lt Colonel Hutchinson visited the in November 1875, but refused to sanction the opening of the line to passenger traffic as the station accommodation, in particular, was incomplete. On 17 December he visited again, and although some matters were imperfect, the desired sanction for opening was given.

The Ryde and Newport Railway opened on 20 December 1875, and like the Cowes and Newport it ran seven passenger trains each way on weekdays. The intermediate stations probably did not open until March 1876.

The paid the a rental for the use of the Ryde station. The arranged with the Cowes and Newport Railway for their two lines to be worked jointly, an arrangement that was ratified by Parliament in the (38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. lx), which also authorised the to build Medina wharf on the River Medina. The wharf was much more suitable for handling heavy goods and minerals, and it quickly became the chief port of entry to the island for that traffic.

====Ashey racecourse====
There was a racecourse adjacent to the line at Ashey, and excursion trains to the race meetings were popular. The Isle of Wight Railway had running powers to Newport and exercised them for the purpose of running to Ashey on race days.

A southwards tramway ran from the station to a chalk pit, running closely past the track and the grandstand. Some authorities state that there was an Ashey Racecourse station, used only for race meetings, on the tramway, in use from April 1882 to about 1930. It seems likely that this is a mistake: the empty rolling stock for the excursions was stabled on the tramway during the racing, but there was no passenger station. The tramway is clearly shown on the mapping of the period, but no station is marked on any Ordnance Survey map in the relevant period. Writing in 1946, Jones describes the route from Newport to Ryde and states

==Collaborative working, but disputes over costs==
The and the had always intended to operate collaboratively, and on 1 July 1876 the Ryde, Newport and Cowes Joint Committee was established to manage operational matters. This was successful so far as day-to-day running was concerned, but the difficult financial situation of the companies led to continuing failure to work together over completion of the line.

The was still heavily indebted and was struggling to pay off the outstanding sums. The too needed some time to increase its income, although on 28 June 1876, the anniversary of the coronation of Queen Victoria, thirteen-coach trains were run between and ; rolling stock had to be hired in from the IoWR. Cheaply-constructed wooden platforms were opened at , , and , probably just in time for Coronation Day 1876.

A vexatious dispute arose over the apportionment of contributions to the cost of the Newport viaduct and bridge, and resort to arbitration, and then a parliamentary bill to revive expired powers delayed opening. An inspection by Major General Hutchinson in October 1878 resulted in the design strength of the bridge girders being questioned.

This seems to have been resolved and in March 1879 he approved the bridge but objected to the junction connection between the two railways&#x27; lines. On 1 May 1879, the directors reported at a shareholders&#x27; meeting that the junction had been made and used for goods trains, and it seems to have been opened for all traffic on 1 June 1879.

Meanwhile, relations with the IoWR, which had been working the , broke down completely, and that arrangement was terminated at the beginning of 1879. The was steadily descending into heavy indebtedness, with many landowners still waiting for their money, and debenture interest payments being left unpaid, and important track improvements being left undone. Against this background the Joint Committee took over the working of the on 1 April 1879.

===Extension to Ryde Pier===
The ran over the IoWR into Ryde; the station was at St John&#x27;s Road and the distance from there to Ryde Pier was a serious inconvenience to through passengers to Portsmouth on the mainland. The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and the London and South Western Railway together decided to build the missing link, and the line from to the IoWR&#x27;s St John&#x27;s Road station opened on 12 July 1880. At first there was limited accommodation at Ryde so the Newport trains were not admitted to the extension until October 1880.

==Amalgamation as the Isle of Wight Central Railway==

The three central lines, the Cowes and Newport Railway, the Isle of Wight (Newport Junction) Railway and the Ryde and Newport Railway, were all in financial difficulties, but they had common cause. By common consent there were too many companies running the limited extent of the network, and they agreed on amalgamation as a way forward, and a combined company called the Isle of Wight Central Railway was authorised by the (50 &amp; 51 Vict. c. cxvi) on 19 July 1887, retrospectively applicable from 1 July 1887.

The combined company was of course no better resourced financially than the three smaller companies. Charles Conacher, its General Manager, wrote that it

No extensions of the small network were planned. In fact, the did not pay a dividend until 1913, and after that only on first preference shares.

The was impecunious throughout its existence, and the generally improving expectations of society: interlocking, the block system and continuous brakes, workmen&#x27;s compensation, and improvements to working hours, coupled with the need to replace worn-out track and to repair bridges, all combined to ensure that the company never managed to escape from this plight.

==Later development==

===Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway===

The western part of the island remained untouched by railways, but Yarmouth was a ferry terminal, with the ferry to Lymington operated by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR). The LSWR encouraged the formation of a scheme for a railway that became the Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway (FY&amp;NR), authorised by the Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway Act 1880 (43 &amp; 44 Vict. c. clxxxvi) on 26 August 1880. It opened for goods traffic on 10 September 1888, and for passengers on 20 July 1889. There were eleven passenger trains each way on weekdays. The new line joined the at Newport, but the layout at the junction did not enable trains to run into the station directly; they were not permitted to propel to and from the station, so that they had to run around their train in both directions. The line was worked by the .

===Newport, Godshill and St Lawrence Railway===

Notwithstanding the existence of the route through Sandown, the member companies of the had long felt that a direct line from Cowes or Newport to Ventnor, independent of the IoWR, was desirable, and a number of schemes had been proposed.

In 1889, one of these schemes was authorised: the Newport, Godshill and St Lawrence Railway got its act of Parliament, the Newport, Godshill and St. Lawrence Railway Act 1889 (55 &amp; 56 Vict. c. ccxl) on 12 August. Long comments that constructing it was &quot;probably the greatest economic folly of the Isle of Wight&#x27;s railway network&quot;. The was to work the line for 55% of gross receipts. It would leave the IoWCR Sandown line at , and follow a southerly course from there. This Act was followed by a second act of Parliament in 1892 authorising an extension to . However the location available for the terminus there was, like the IoWR&#x27;s own station, somewhat inconvenient. It proved very difficult to persuade investors to subscribe in the railway, with corresponding shortages of cash for construction; there were also solvency problems for the contractor.

Eventually the section from Merstone to was ready and the Board of Trade inspector was critical of the tunnel, but sanctioned opening. There was a publicity demonstration run on 17 July 1897 and a public ceremonial opening on 19 July 1897, with normal public opening the following day. There were nine trains daily each way, and the line was worked by the . The terminus was described as Ventnor (St Lawrence), although the station was from the town. F. Baker of Ventnor operated a horse omnibus over the distance, for a fare of sixpence.

Although the original contractor had failed financially, it proved possible to continue the extension to Ventnor, and Lt Colonel von Donop visited on 21 May 1900. Although there were some deficiencies he authorised the opening of the extension. A press run took place on 31 May 1900 and public services started on 1 June 1900. The Ventnor station was described as Ventnor Town, and it was stated that &quot;In eight or nine minutes passengers can walk to the centre of the town.&quot;

There were now five trains each way daily, generally running through to Cowes trains on the Sandown former main line now made a connectional stop only at Merstone—and offering onward ferry connections via Southampton. From June 1901, it was arranged that the London and South Western Railway would run a train from London Waterloo to Southampton Royal Pier, making a swift connection to a ferry to Cowes and thence to Ventnor by train. This did not prove the commercial success that had been hoped. The preference of the Ventnor line over the Sandown line for the through trains was considered to be a mistake, and from 1 October 1903 the arrangement was reversed.

====Bus competition====
In 1905, the first motor bus service started work on the island. The primitive vehicles and poor roads of the day did not make for efficient travel, but the future threat was there. The considered the adoption of railmotors—single-coach rail vehicles incorporating a small locomotive within the coach chassis. These vehicles offered lower operating costs, but still required a crew of three; and they did not have the power to haul additional vehicles at busy times. However they avoided the necessity of running round at the end of journeys. One was ordered from Hurst Nelson in October 1905. It was delivered a year later, on 4 October 1906. It went into service on the Ventnor line, but there were a succession of technical problems.

===IoWCR finances===
When the agreed to work the Newport, Godshill and St Lawrence Railway, it guaranteed a minimum income of £2,000 to that company&#x27;s shareholders. It anticipated that ordinary income would pay that sum off but the poor custom on the line failed to achieve that. The IoWCR preference shareholders were not getting dividends—the ordinary shareholders had no hope of that—and there was shareholder criticism of the payments. The issue came to a head at the shareholders&#x27; meeting of 1 March 1911, and several directors resigned, with new replacemnts then installed. One of the new men was Harry Willmott, who had long experience as a senior railway manager, including much in reviving the fortunes of the impecunious Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway. He was installed as the new chairman, and he soon brought in new managers and introduced more streamlined systems in the company. Incidentally, he negotiated with the Board of Trade about 1912 that Freshwater trains could be propelled to and from Newport station, overturning the old prohibition which required running around on every trip.

The guarantee to the remained a difficulty, and could hardly be negotiated away. The solution arrived at was the purchase of that company by the . The Isle of Wight Central Railway (Godshill Transfer) Act 1913 (3 &amp; 4 Geo. 5. c. xiii) of 4 July 1913 authorised the change, and it became effective on 1 October 1913. Godshill ordinary shareholders got fivepence in the pound (just over 2%); their railway had cost more than £250,000 to construct.

===Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway working its own line===
The Freshwater, Yarmouth and Newport Railway (FY&amp;NR) had long been worked by the . In 1910, the agreement needed to be renewed, and the noted that major modernisation work was needed on the Yarmouth line infrastructure, and imposed less favourable financial terms. For a time this was accepted, but in April 1913 the was informed that the would work its own line from 1 July 1913. As well as suddenly needing to acquire rolling stock, the had to provide its own station at Newport, just short of the convergence with the . In fact two locomotives had to be acquired; the small number indicates how limited the train service was. The new independent arrangement started on 1 July 1913; passengers now had to change stations at Newport, and the inferior service and higher costs eventually pushed the FY&amp;NR into bankruptcy. The had its locomotives overhauled by the Isle of Wight Railway at Ryde, and the charged a toll of £3 to pass them through Newport. The problem of the station at Newport was resolved in August 1914.

==Grouping of the railways==
The outbreak of World War I resulted in government control of the railways; this resulted in infrastructure improvements being deferred and the income of the company was hit. A national strike and post-war Government control of fares, as well as much-improved bus competition and improved wage rates and working conditions for staff all attacked the financial situation of the line.

Under the terms of the Railways Act 1921, the main line railways of Great Britain were &quot;grouped&quot; into four large companies; all of the Isle of Wight lines were absorbed into the new Southern Railway from 1 January 1923. The ordinary shareholders of the got £3 for each £100 share (The absorption of the was delayed until 1 August 1923 due to negotiations over the financial terms; during the period from 1 January, when the refused the offered settlement, the company&#x27;s trains were again barred from the main Newport station).

The Southern Railway brought capital to the island to pay for improvements. The two single lines between Smallbrook and St John&#x27;s Road were converted to a conventional double track by the installation of crossovers at Smallbrook in 1926; the arrangement was applied in the summer months, and the Smallbrook Junction signal box was closed in winter, when line capacity was not an issue. A peak train service of 27 trains each way daily was run on the Newport to Cowes section by 1925.

The antiquated locomotive fleet was improved, by retaining the A1X &#x27;Terrier&#x27; class and bringing in some LSWR O2 class 0-4-4T engines that had been displaced by the electrification of London suburban services; the four-wheel coaches were also abolished, and bogie coaches brought in. The improvements brought about a marked increase in business, but it was of course highly seasonal, and the buses running on improved roads were far more convenient for many travellers. The short distances on the island meant that goods traffic was at a serious disadvantage against road competition.

A new passing place was created at Havenstreet about 1926, as that was a more convenient crossing point on the line; Ashey and Whippingham loops were reduced to goods status only, and passenger trains did not cross there. Ventnor Town station had its name changed to .

Weekly tickets for unlimited travel on the island were introduced and proved very popular with holidaymakers on the island. In the summer of 1932, new through trains were run: six coaches were labelled &quot;East and West Through Train&quot; and ran Mondays to Fridays from to and back, calling only at , , , and Yarmouth. An E1 class engine worked this train between Shanklin and Newport, and an A1X from Newport to Freshwater. The old railcar had been rebuilt several years before as an open third saloon with wooden slat seats was now rebuilt into a third-class corridor observation coach to run in the through train.

This was immediately popular, and additional through trains were run in the 1933 summer service between the Ryde–Ventnor line and the Freshwater branch. The original through train, now starting from Ventnor with an accelerated timing, and became the first named train, each coach carrying a board with &quot;The Tourist&quot; in gold on a red background. A second through fast train was also included in the programme between and Freshwater, the first for twenty years.

In this period it was the practice at Cowes for the coaches to be gravitated into platform 1 (which was generally used) after the arriving engine had been released; this practice continued until closure. The facilities at Medina Wharf were modernised, with a large concrete pier structure being provided, equipped with two massive transporter cranes. Rolling stock brought in to modernise the island&#x27;s fleet was generally brought in here. There was a staff halt on the main line.

In 1932–33, the Southern Railway brought in four E1 tank engines to operate heavier freight trains.

==Nationalisation==
On 1 January 1948, the railways passed into nationalised ownership under British Railways, following the Transport Act 1947. World War II had caused further decline in the competitive position of the railways on the island, and the minimal carryings on the Merstone to Ventnor line resulted in its closure on 13 September 1952. The Newport to Freshwater line was closed on 21 September 1953. The Newport to Sandown line continued for a while, but on 6 February 1956 it too closed. The former line from Smallbrook to Cowes via Newport, carrying a passenger train service from Ryde to Cowes, was the only residual part of the IoWCR now extant.

The decision was taken to retain only the Ryde to Shanklin section on the island, and the Ryde–Newport–Cowes service, and the route from Smallbrook to Cowes closed on 21 February 1966, bringing about the end of the network.

==Stock==

===Locomotives===


Between 1898 and 1905, the railway purchased four London, Brighton and South Coast Railway A1 &quot;Terrier&quot; class locomotives to operate its trains. One of these had been sent by the LBSCR to the Paris Exhibition of 1878, where it won a gold medal. In 1901, this locomotive was bought by the and was numbered 11, then brought to the island on 8 January 1902. This locomotive is preserved at the Isle of Wight Steam Railway.

===Coaching stock===
At the grouping, the had 37 passenger coaches and 12 non-passenger coaching stock vehicles. The passenger coaches comprised sixteen third-class (allotted SR numbers 2441–2456), eleven composites (6347–6357), six brake thirds (4098–4103), three brake composites (6987–6989) and one first-class saloon (7995). The non-passenger coaching stock comprised six guard&#x27;s vans (979, 990–994), six open carriage and baggage boxes (4385–4390) and one horse box (3369).

==Heritage railway==

The last steam trains on the Isle of Wight ran on the residual Ryde to Shanklin line on 31 December 1966. The steam locomotive W24 &quot;Calbourne&quot; and some carriages were purchased by an enthusiast group, and in 1971, the Isle of Wight Railway Co Ltd was formed to buy the length of track between Wootton and Havenstreet, operating steam trains as a heritage railway. In 1991 the line was extended to on the Ryde–Shanklin line, where a new interchange station was built, enabling passengers to interchange with Island Line trains.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Burges, VC, DSO (1 July 1873 – 24 October 1946) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
Burges was born in Bloomsbury, London, on 1 July 1873 and educated at Winchester College. He was commissioned on 21 October 1893 as a second lieutenant into the Gloucestershire Regiment, and was promoted to lieutenant on 8 July 1897. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899, Burges was with the 2nd battalion of his regiment as they were sent to South Africa in January 1900. He participated in the Relief of Kimberley, operations in the Orange Free State, actions at Poplar Grove, Driefontein, Vet River, Zand River, the operations in the Transvaal, Rhenoster Kop, operations in Orange River Colony and in Cape Colony. For his service in the war, he received the Queen&#x27;s South Africa Medal with four clasps, and the King&#x27;s South Africa Medal with two clasps. At the end of the war Burges returned to Southampton on the SS &quot;Orcana&quot;, arriving in November 1902.

Burges was promoted to captain on 25 October 1903. From 1908 to 1913 he was adjutant of the Punjab Volunteer Rifles. At the start of World War I he was with the 2nd Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment with which he served at the Second Battle of Ypres where he was wounded and Mentioned in dispatches. After recovering from his wound he was appointed Temporary Lieutenant-Colonel to command the 10th (Service) Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment (the &#x27;Hull Commercials&#x27;) on 11 November 1915. The battalion had just arrived at Fovant on Salisbury Plain to undergo intensive battle training with 31st Division before embarking for service overseas. It served in Egypt, guarding the Suez Canal from December to February 1916, when it was transferred to the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front.
Over the forthcoming weeks the battalion took its turn in the routine of trench holding, working parties, patrolling and trench raiding. The 10th Battalion was to be in support of 31st Division&#x27;s assault on the first day of the Battle of the Somme (1 July). It held the front line trenches during the British bombardment in the days leading up to the battle, suffering significant casualties from the German counter-bombardment (about 100 killed and wounded for 10th Bn alone).

It is alleged that Lt-Col Burges was removed from his command the day before the battle for refusing to risk any more men after two failed attempts to recover the body of an officer (a son of a well-known politician) from No man&#x27;s land during the bombardment. Burges left 10th Bn East Yorks on 30 June to become an instructor at the Senior Officers&#x27; School. In September 1917 he took command of the 7th Bn South Wales Borderers at Salonika, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in May 1918. 

==VC award==
He was a 45 years old temporary lieutenant-colonel in The Gloucestershire Regiment commanding the 7th (Service) Battalion, The South Wales Borderers, British Army, during the First World War at the Battle of Doiran when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

He was made a brevet Lieutenant Colonel in January 1919 while still in hospital with his VC injuries. In retirement Burges served as Resident Governor and major of the Tower of London from 1 July 1923 to 1 July 1933. He later joined the British Fascists. He moved to Durdham Down, near Bristol, and from 1943 to 1945 he was county director of the British Red Cross.

Burges died in Bristol on 24 October 1946, aged 73, and was cremated at the Arnos Vale Cemetery, Bristol. A marble plaque was unveiled at the cemetery on 24 October 2006 (60 years to the day after he died).

==Family==
Burges married Katherine Blanche Fortescue, second daughter of the late Captain Edmund Fortescue of the Rifle Brigade, in 1905. They had no children, and she died in 1931. In 1932 he married Mrs Florence Wray Taylor, daughter of the late W.G. Cox of Nutgrove, Rathfarnham, Dublin.

<doc id="1190708" wikidata="Q6555763" url="?curid=1190708" title="Lionel Queripel">
<text>Captain Lionel Ernest Queripel VC (13 July 1920 − 19 September 1944) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Lionel Queripel came from a well established and highly decorated military family; his father, Colonel L. H. Queripel, was appointed CMG and awarded the DSO, having served during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 and later in Mesopotamia, France and Russia during World War I. His grandfather (appointed CB) and great-grandfather were also soldiers. He was born in Winterborne Monkton, Dorset, England. He was educated at Marlborough College.

==World War II==
Queripel, intent on pursuing a military career, entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in January 1939. On 22 October, just a few weeks after the outbreak of World War II, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Royal Sussex Regiment. He was posted to the regiment&#x27;s 2nd Battalion, a Regular Army unit then commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Manley James, a Victoria Cross (VC) recipient of World War I. The battalion was serving in Northern Ireland on internal security duties before moving to England in December where it became part of the 133rd Infantry Brigade, itself one of three brigades forming Major General Edmund Osborne&#x27;s 44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division. Together with the rest of his battalion, Queripel went to France in April 1940, only to return less than two months later, after the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), despite fighting bravely in the Battle of France, was forced to retreat to Dunkirk, from where they were evacuated to England. Almost two years of home defence, spent mainly in Kent, were to pass before Queripel, who on 22 April 1941 was promoted to lieutenant, and his battalion were to see further action.

In May 1942 Queripel&#x27;s battalion, along with the rest of the 44th Division, now under Major General Ivor Hughes, left England, destined for North Africa. On 27 July Queripel was promoted to the temporary rank of captain. After participating in the Battle of Alam el Halfa and the Second Battle of El Alamein (the latter where they sustained heavy casualties) the battalion was one of several to provide candidates for selection to form a new battalion of the Parachute Regiment. Originally, when the 2nd Battalion was scheduled for conversion it was known as ‘S’ Battalion. However, the War Office then decreed that a regular unit could not be transferred to the Army Air Corps and the battalion remained on strength bolstered by men of the 4th and 5th Battalions. There were 200 or so men of the 2nd Battalion who qualified and progressed to parachute training and they formed the basis of the 10th Parachute Battalion at Kabrit under Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Smyth, of the South Wales Borderers. The battalion eventually became part of Brigadier John Hackett&#x27;s 4th Parachute Brigade, which in June 1943 became part of Major General George Hopkinson&#x27;s 1st Airborne Division. The 4th Para Brigade was held in reserve and unused during the Allied invasion of Sicily but participated in Operation Slapstick, part of the Allied invasion of Italy, in September 1943, and fought briefly in the early stages of the Italian Campaign before returning, with the rest of the division, to England in December 1943. As in Sicily, the division was held in reserve for the D-Day landings and unused during the subsequent Normandy Campaign, before being selected to take part in Operation Market Garden.

===Battle of Arnhem===
Queripel was 24 years old, and a Captain in the 10th Battalion, Parachute Regiment, 4th Parachute Brigade, 1st Airborne Division during this battle when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. By 1400 hrs on 19 September the confusion and heavy casualties saw Captain Queripel acting as commander of a company composed of the men of three parachute battalions. As they advanced along a main road on an embankment towards Arnhem they came under continuous machine-gun fire. At one point, the fire became so heavy that the company was split up on either side of the road and suffered considerable losses. Captain Queripel immediately began to reorganise his troops, crossing and recrossing the road while doing so, under extremely heavy and accurate fire from a strong point consisting of a captured British anti-tank gun and two machine guns. Whilst carrying a wounded sergeant to the regimental aid post under fire he was himself wounded in the face. Having reorganised his force, Captain Queripel personally led a party of men against the strong point holding up the advance. Despite the extremely heavy fire directed at him, Captain Queripel succeeded in killing the crews of the machine-guns and recapturing the anti-tank gun enabling the advance to continue. Later Captain Queripel was ordered to defend some woodland near the Wolfheze level crossing which was vital to the allied advance (Wolfheze is about 12 km to the northwest of Arnhem Bridge but only a few hundred metres from the Drop and Landing Zones used). By this time he had received further wounds in both arms, was cut off with a small party of men and took up a position in a ditch. Disregarding his injuries and the heavy mortar and machine gun fire, he continued to inspire his men to resist with hand grenades, pistols, and the few remaining rifles. On at least one occasion he picked up and threw back an enemy stick grenade which had landed in the ditch. As the enemy pressure increased, Captain Queripel decided that it was impossible to hold the position any longer and ordered the men to withdraw. Despite their protests, he insisted on remaining behind to cover their withdrawal with his automatic pistol and a few remaining hand grenades. This was the last occasion on which he was seen.

==Victoria Cross citation==

The full citation for Queripel&#x27;s Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 1 February 1945, reading:War Office, 1st February, 1945.

The KING has been graciously pleased to approve the award of the VICTORIA CROSS to:—

Captain Lionel Ernest Queripel (108181), The Royal Sussex Regiment. (1st Airborne Division) (Dorchester).

In Holland on the 19th September, 1944, Captain Queripel was acting as Company Commander of a composite Company composed of three Parachute Battalions.

At 14.00 hours on that day, his Company was advancing along a main road which ran on an embankment towards Arnhem. The advance was conducted under continuous medium machine-gun fire which, at one period, became so heavy that the Company became split up on either side of the road and suffered considerable losses. Captain Queripel at once proceeded to reorganise his force, crossing and recrossing the road whilst doing so, under extremely heavy and accurate fire. During this period he carried a wounded Sergeant to the Regimental Aid Post under fire and was himself wounded in the face.

Having reorganised his force, Captain Queripel personally led a party of men against the strong point holding up the advance. This strong point consisted of a captured British anti-tank gun and two machine-guns. Despite the extremely heavy fire directed at him, Captain Queripel succeeded in killing the crews of the machine-guns and recapturing the anti-tank gun. As a result of this, the advance was able to continue.

Later in the same day, Captain Queripel found himself cut off with a small party of men and took up a position in a ditch. By this time he had received further wounds in both arms. Regardless of his wounds and of the very heavy mortar and spandau fire, he continued to inspire his men to resist with hand grenades, pistols and the few remaining rifles.

As, however, the enemy pressure increased, Captain Queripel decided that it was impossible to hold the position any longer and ordered his men to withdraw. Despite their protests, he insisted on remaining behind to cover their withdrawal with his automatic pistol and a few remaining hand grenades. This is the last occasion on which he was seen.

During the whole of a period of nine hours of confused and bitter fighting Captain Queripel displayed the highest standard of gallantry under most difficult and trying circumstances. His courage, leadership and devotion to duty were magnificent, and an inspiration to all. This officer is officially reported to be wounded and missing.

==Legacy==
Queripel is buried in the Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery. Following the custom of the British Army, his gravestone is marked with the regimental badge of the regiment he was first commissioned into rather than that of his serving unit, The Parachute Regiment.

As is often the case with posthumous VC recipients, there are many Regimental memorials to Lionel Queripel, these include: the Parachute Regiment Roll of Honour which used to be in St Martins-in-the-Fields Church, London but is now in Aldershot; Queripel House the site of 10 PARA’s HQ at Duke of York’s in London; Leicestershire where 10 PARA emplaned; the Royal Sussex Book of Remembrance in Chichester Cathedral; the entrance porch to the village church at Somerby and of course the Airborne Forces Museum and the Royal Sussex museum at Duxford, Aldershot and Oosterbeek. Recently, Captain Queripel’s school, Marlborough College, has unveiled a VC/GC memorial on which his name is commemorated; it had already been commemorated on the walls of the school&#x27;s Memorial Hall.

Recently his home town of Tunbridge Wells (to where the family moved in 1926) added his name to the Town War Memorial but he had already been included in a unique VC Memorial in Dunorlan Park in Tunbridge Wells. Ten VC recipients had lived in Tunbridge Wells including the very first VC to be awarded to Charles Lucas, who as a mate on ] during the Crimean War in 1854 picked a live shell with a burning fuse from the deck and threw it overboard.

In February 1945 when the award of the Victoria Cross was announced, Tunbridge Wells Council commissioned a poem by Herbert Hope Campbell. At the time Lionel Queripel was posted as missing, it was not until after the war that it was confirmed he was killed:

We who are burghers of your native town&lt;br&gt;
Hail you today with your illustrious name,&lt;br&gt;
Your knightly valour wins for you renown;&lt;br&gt;
We glory in your courage and your fame!&lt;br&gt;
May we be worthy of your daring deed&lt;br&gt;
Performed by you in England’s hour of need.

On 19 September 2007, Lionel Queripel&#x27;s sword, which had been held with B Coy the London Regiment, was presented to the Royal Sussex Regiment Museum in Eastbourne. His surviving sister, her family and Regimental representatives were present. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum.

<text>Charles Edward Haydon Parker (10 March 1870 – 9 August 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==

Parker was born in Woolwich to a William (a Crimean War veteran) and Louisa Parker. He was 30 years old, and a sergeant in &#x27;Q&#x27; Battery, Royal Horse Artillery, British Army, during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

On 31 March 1900 at Sanna&#x27;s Post (aka Korn Spruit), South Africa, &#x27;Q&#x27; and &#x27;U&#x27; Batteries of the Royal Horse Artillery were ambushed with the loss of most of the baggage column and five guns of the leading battery. When the alarm was given, &#x27;Q&#x27; Battery went into action 1150 yards from the spruit, until the order to retire was received, when Major Edmund Phipps-Hornby, commander of &#x27;Q&#x27; Battery, ordered the guns and their limbers to be run back by hand to a safe place. This most exhausting operation was carried out by, among others, Sergeant Parker, Gunner Isaac Lodge and Driver Horace Glasock, and when at last all but one of the guns and one limber had been moved to safety, the battery was reformed. The citation reads:
Parker was elected by the non-commissioned officers as described above.
He returned to the United Kingdom in early 1901, and received the VC from King Edward during an investiture at Marlborough House 25 July 1901.

Lieutenant Francis Maxwell also earned the VC in this action.

==Later life==
After 21 years of service in the Royal Horse Artillery, he retired and settled in Coventry. On the outbreak of the Great War, he initially worked in a munitions factory, but soon decided to rejoin and was posted to France with the Royal Field Artillery as a Battery Sergeant Major. In 1918, the father of two was badly wounded and forced to return home. Sadly, he never recovered from his wounds, and died aged 48 on 9 August 1918. He was buried in London Road Cemetery, Coventry, and now has a Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstone.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Artillery Museum, Larkhill Wiltshire, England.

<doc id="1190717" wikidata="Q7866266" url="?curid=1190717" title="USCGC Tamaroa (WMEC-166)">
<text>USCGC &quot;Tamaroa&quot; (WAT/WMEC-166), originally the United States Navy &quot;Cherokee&quot;-class fleet tug , was a United States Coast Guard cutter. Following the U.S. Coast Guard custom of naming cutters in this class of ship after Native American tribes, she was named after the Tamaroa tribe of the Illiniwek tribal group.

==Construction and U.S. Navy operational history==
The ship was one of 70 of her class built for the U.S. Navy. As the fleet tug USS &quot;Zuni&quot;, she saw action in World War II, including in the Marianas, Philippines, and Iwo Jima operations. After the war, she was transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard in 1946.

==U.S. Coast Guard operational history==
The bulk of &quot;Tamaroa&quot;′s U.S. Coast Guard career was spent patrolling, working in drug interdiction, and fisheries protection. She was the first Coast Guard cutter to arrive at the sinking ocean liner &quot;Andrea Doria&quot; in 1956.

&quot;Tamaroa&quot; was involved in the landmark 1969 tort case, Ira S. Bushey &amp; Sons, Inc. v. United States, 398 F.2d 167 (2d Cir. 1968), which held the United States vicariously liable for the damage caused by &quot;Tamaroa&quot; to a drydock after an intoxicated U.S. Coast Guard seaman returning to his bunk aboard &quot;Tamaroa&quot; on 14 March 1963 opened drydock water valves, flooding and sinking the drydock and causing &quot;Tamaroa&quot; to list and slide off her blocks. In its ruling, the court found that an employer (in this case, the United States Government) will be held liable under &quot;respondeat superior&quot; if the actions of the employee (in this, a U.S. Coast Guard seaman) arise out of the course of his or her employment (in this case, as a U.S. Coast Guard seaman returning to his ship after leave) and cause damage (in this case, to Bushey &amp; Sons′ drydock). The court held that &quot;the ship is liable for anything ship-connected persons cause it to do.&quot;

&quot;Tamaroa&quot; is perhaps most famous for a rescue described in the 1997 book &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot; (by Sebastian Junger) and depicted in the 2000 movie &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;; on October 31, 1991, &quot;Tamaroa&quot; (led by Commander Lawrence Brudnicki) had been attempting to rescue the crew of the sailing vessel &quot;Satori&quot; the previous day when the cutter was diverted to assist the Air National Guard aircrew, she rescued four out of the five crewmen of a downed New York Air National Guard helicopter. The fifth aircrewman was never found and presumed drowned.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
After the Coast Guard decommissioned her in 1994, &quot;Tamaroa&quot; was donated to the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum in New York City. She was noticed tied up next to the museum ship in 1994 by a former crewman who began a campaign to restore her. After several unsuccessful attempts, the Zuni Maritime Foundation, a non-profit organization in Richmond, Virginia, formed. The foundation attempted to preserve the ship in an operational condition, and use her to educate the public. This ultimately proved unsuccessful.

Prior to scuttling, parts of the &quot;Tamaroa&quot; were removed by the Black Dog Salvage company for two episodes of the TV show &quot;Salvage Dawgs&quot;. Her main mast was repurposed as a flagpole for the Ballast Point microbrewery in Roanoke, VA. Having been tied up in Norfolk, Virginia, and environmentally cleaned, she was selected in 2016 for use as an artificial reef. Her sinking, originally scheduled for 30 October 2016, was delayed by rough seas and related issues. She finally was scuttled at 13:00 on 10 May 2017 in the Atlantic Ocean about 33 nautical miles (61 km) from Cape May, New Jersey, at a depth of 120 feet, forming an artificial reef. Her wreck is now a recreational dive site, part of the Del-Jersey-Land Inshore Reef.

<text>James Bulmer Johnson VC (31 December 1889 – 23 March 1943) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was a Second Lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion, The Northumberland Fusiliers, British Army, attached to 36th Battalion during the First World War and 28 years old when on 14 October 1918 south west of Wez Macquart, France, he performed the act for which he was awarded the VC.

During operations by strong patrols, Second Lieutenant Johnson repelled frequent counter-attacks and for six hours, under heavy fire, he held back the enemy. When at length he was ordered to retire he was the last to leave the advanced position carrying a wounded man. Three times subsequently this officer returned and brought in badly wounded men under intense enemy machine-gun fire.

After World War I, Johnson served in the Auxiliary Division of the Royal Irish Constabulary.

He died in Plymouth, Devon, in 1943 aged fifty-three, and was cremated at Efford Crematorium, Plymouth.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Fusiliers Museum of Northumberland, Alnwick, Northumberland.

== Memorial ==

In 2018, on the hundredth anniversary of Johnson&#x27;s VC award, a memorial erected by Widdrington Station and Stobswood Parish Council and Northumberland County Council, and provided by the Department of Communities and Local Government, was unveiled at Widdrington Station.

A dispute subsequently arose over the siting of the memorial stone. Widdrington Station and Stobswood Parish Council asserted that Johnson was born in Stobswood on 31 December 1889, and used the name &quot;James Bulmer Johnson&quot;. However a local resident, and Widdrington Village Parish Council, claimed that Johnson was born in 1882 at the then Widdrington Colliery, and had no middle name. The latter parish council requested the memorial be moved to their parish. The County Council defended the location and details on the memorial stone, and referred the matter to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.

<text>Vrindavan (; ), also spelt Vrindaban and Brindaban, is a historical city in the Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh, India. It is located in the Braj Bhoomi region and holds religious importance for Hindus who believe that Krishna, one of the main Gods in Hinduism, spent most of his childhood in this city. Vrindavan has about 5,500 temples dedicated to the worship of Krishna and his chief consort, Radha. It is one of the most sacred places for Vaishnava traditions. 

Vrindavan forms a part of the &quot;Krishna pilgrimage circuit&quot; under development by the Indian Ministry of Tourism. The circuit also includes Mathura, Barsana, Gokul, Govardhan, Kurukshetra, Dwarka and Puri.

== Etymology ==
The ancient Sanskrit name of the city, (), comes from its groves of &quot;vṛndā&quot; (holy basil) and &quot;vana&quot; (grove, forest).

== History ==

Vrindavan has an ancient past, associated with Hindu culture and history, and was established in the 16th and 17th centuries as a result of an explicit treaty between Muslims and Hindu Emperors, and is an important Hindu pilgrimage site since long.

In contemporary times, Vallabha Charya, aged eleven visited Vrindavan. Later on, he performed three pilgrimages of India, barefoot giving discourses on Bhagavad Gita at 84 places. These 84 places are known as Pushtimarg Baithak and since then have the places of pilgrimage. Yet, he stayed in Vrindavan for four months each year. Vrindavan thus heavily influenced his formation of Pushtimarg.

The essence of Vrindavan was lost over time until the 16th century when it was rediscovered by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. In the year 1515, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu visited Vrindavan, with the purpose of locating the lost holy places associated with Krishna&#x27;s life.

In the last 250 years, the extensive forests of Vrindavan have been subjected to urbanisation, first by local Rajas and in recent decades by apartment developers. The forest cover has been whittled away to only a few remaining spots, and the local wildlife, including peacocks, cows, monkeys and a variety of bird species has been virtually eliminated.

== Geography ==

<doc id="1190730" wikidata="Q7875780" url="?curid=1190730" title="USS Zuni">
<text>USS &quot;Zuni&quot; (AT/ATF-95), a fleet tugboat, formerly called , was a ship of the United States Navy named for the Zuni, the popular name given to a tribe of Pueblo Indians indigenous to the area around the Zuni River in central New Mexico near the Arizona state line.

&quot;Zuni&quot; (AT-95) was laid down on 8 March 1943 at Portland, Oregon, by the Commercial Iron Works; launched on 31 July 1943; sponsored by Mrs. J. J. O&#x27;Donnell; and commissioned on 9 October 1943.

==1943==
&quot;Zuni&quot; completed shakedown training late in October and on the 28th reported for duty with the Western Sea Frontier, The following day, she departed Puget Sound, bound for Kodiak, Alaska. On 10 November, she stood out of the harbor at Kodiak with two barges in tow. In extremely heavy weather during the voyage south, the towlines to both barges parted; and &quot;Zuni&quot; experienced great difficulty in keeping herself afloat. Though she managed to maintain contact with the second barge after it broke loose, she ultimately received orders to abandon it and make for Seattle, Washington.

On 1 December, the tug was reassigned to Service Squadron 2 (ServRon 2) and departed Seattle that same day with a barge in tow, bound for Oakland, California. After repairs at Oakland, the tug headed west for the New Hebrides on 27 December 1943, in company with four cargo ships, and arrived in Espiritu Santo at the end of January 1944.

==1944==
Early in February, the tug left Espiritu Santo, set her course for Hawaii, and arrived in Pearl Harbor on 17 February. She performed routine missions at Oahu for about a month, getting underway on 21 March for a round-trip voyage to Canton Island. She returned to Oahu on 9 April towing two barges from Canton Island. On 20 April, she stood out of Pearl Harbor, pulling three barges bound for Majuro Atoll, and returned to Hawaii on 11 May. On 15 May 1944, she was redesignated a Fleet Ocean Tug, ATF-95.

A week later, she began an extended tour of duty in the Central Pacific. Towing the floating dry dock , the tug arrived in Kwajalein lagoon on 2 June. Reassigned to ServRon 12, &quot;Zuni&quot; served as a harbor tug at Kwajalein until mid-July when she again took &quot;ARD-16&quot; in tow and got underway for the Mariana Islands. There, she participated briefly in the 24 July assault on Tinian before settling into a routine of shuttle voyages between Eniwetok and the Marianas. Late in September, she towed a different floating dry dock, , to the Palau Islands where, during the first 18 days of October, she provided support services to the combined forces invading Peleliu. At that point, she received urgent orders to rendezvous with after that light cruiser had been damaged by two torpedoes during a Japanese aerial blitz to answer Task Force 38&#x27;s raids on Okinawa and Formosa. She relieved of the light cruiser and towed her into Ulithi lagoon on 27 October. After serving at the anchorage there for five days, the tug returned to sea with a group of oilers. Soon another set of urgent orders sent her to aid another light cruiser, , which had been torpedoed in the Philippines, off the San Bernardino Strait, on 3 November by Japanese submarine . Though the cruiser nearly capsized, the ships’ companies of &quot;Zuni&quot; and &quot;Reno&quot; combined efforts to meet the threat; and the tug succeeded in towing the cruiser 1,500 miles (2,800 km) back to Ulithi.

The tug remained in Ulithi for the rest of November and throughout most of December. During the latter month, she towed the disabled merchantman into Ulithi and conducted a solitary cruise to eastward of the Philippines. On 29 December, &quot;Zuni&quot; put to sea with Task Group 30.8, the replenishment group for TF 38, and cruised for almost a month off Luzon. She returned to Ulithi on 28 January 1945 for engine repairs.

==1945==
She moved back out to sea in February and arrived off Iwo Jima three days after the initial assault. For 31 days, she performed yeoman service for the warships in the area. She pulled a transport off a sand bar. She provided engine partial power to , which had lost one engine, as &quot;LST-944&quot; made her run for the beach, and &quot;Zuni&quot; remained alongside &quot;LST-944&quot; to assist the vessel to remain in position on the beach against the very high surf to land the US Army 506th 90 mm AAA Battalion, which was attached to the 3rd Marine Division. The use of a tug to help power an LST (Landing Ship, Tank) to the beach was a Navy first in amphibious landings. Her more routine missions consisted of assisting broached landing craft and laying submerged fuel pipes.

Work in the shallows, however, was as dangerous to her as to others. While attempting to save on 23 March 1945, &quot;Zuni&quot; was stranded on Yellow Beach on Iwo Jima when a broken towline fouled her anchor and propeller. She lost two crewmen, Frederick Francis Palkovics, 18, of Elizabeth, N.J., and James Michael Byrnes, in the disaster, and suffered a broken keel and holed sides. She was pulled off the beach by and , temporarily repaired, and towed to Saipan. After further temporary repairs, &quot;Zuni&quot; was towed to Pearl Harbor where she arrived at the end of May. During the more than 14 weeks of repairs she underwent there, World War II ended.

&quot;Zuni&quot; resumed active duty on 15 September and served with the Pacific Fleet until early in 1946, when she was transferred to the Atlantic Fleet. She served in the 8th Naval District until she was decommissioned on 29 June 1946 and transferred to the United States Coast Guard. &quot;Zuni&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 19 July 1946.

&quot;Zuni&quot; earned four battle stars for her World War II service. Admiral William Halsey awarded the Legion of Merit to her skipper, Lt. Ray E. Chance. From the time of her commissioning &quot;Zuni&quot; was underway 80% of the time.

==USCGC &quot;Tamaroa&quot;==


The ship was renamed , after the Tamaroa tribe of the Illiniwek tribal group. She was later reclassified a Medium Endurance Cutter, WMEC-166. As &quot;Tamaroa&quot;, she is best known for her rescue work during the &quot;Perfect Storm&quot; of 1991. She was decommissioned by the Coast Guard on 1 February 1994.

From 2009 till 2011 &quot;Tamaroa&quot; had been undergoing restoration work at Little Creek in preparation to its move to its future home port in the City of Portsmouth. In 2011 she was moved to the Nauticus on the waterfront in downtown Norfolk where she remained for a brief stay. She was then moved to a private shipyard across the Elizabeth river where she awaits her final fate. In late 2011 or early 2012 she suffered a major leak during a storm. Her owner decided that it was no longer worth keeping and turned her over to the shipyard owner. The Zuni Maritime Foundation was able to remove the property that they had acquired to outfit the ship and has transferred to other museum ships.

==Scuttling and use as reef==
Prior to scuttling, parts of the Tamaroa were removed by the Black Dog Salvage company for two episodes of the TV show &quot;Salvage Dawgs&quot;. Her main mast was repurposed as a flagpole for the Ballast Point microbrewery in Roanoke, Virginia. In 2017 the hull of the ship was scuttled off the coast of Cape May, New Jersey to add to an existing artificial reef. New Jersey and Delaware acquired the Tamaroa for $300,000, mostly raised through non-profit groups. It joins the Navy destroyer USS &quot;Arthur W. Radford&quot; 120 feet below the ocean’s surface on the Del-Jersey-Land Reef, which is managed by Delaware, New Jersey and Maryland.

<doc id="1190731" wikidata="Q945692" url="?curid=1190731" title="Smooth green snake">
<text>The smooth green snake (Opheodrys vernalis) is a species of North American nonvenomous snake in the family Colubridae. The species is also referred to as the grass snake. It is a slender, &quot;small medium&quot; snake that measures as an adult. It gets its common name from its smooth dorsal scales, as opposed to the rough green snake, which has keeled dorsal scales. The smooth green snake is found in marshes, meadows, open woods, and along stream edges, and is native to regions of Canada, the United States, and northern Mexico. A non-aggressive snake, it seldom bites and usually flees when threatened. It mates in late spring to summer, and females lay their eggs from June to September. The smooth green snake will often bob its head in order to mimic vegetation blowing in the wind.

==Description==
The smooth green snake is slender. In size, it is classified as a &quot;small medium&quot; snake, reaching to in total length (including tail) as an adult. The longest smooth green snake was measured as being in total length. The tail makes up about 1/4 to 1/2 the total length of the snake; males have longer tails than females.

It is uniform light green on its back, with a yellow or white belly, and has smooth dorsal scales, unlike those of the rough green snake, which are keeled. Its smooth dorsal scales are arranged in 15 rows at midbody.

At birth, its dorsal coloration is different from that when it matures. At first, it can be olive green, blue-gray, or even brown, but after it sheds its skin for the first time, it becomes the characteristic bright green. The dorsal coloration can also vary depending on location: bluish in Kansas, olive-tinted light brown in southeastern Texas, and bronze in northern Wisconsin.

It uses its tongue, red with a black end, by flicking it in and out of its mouth to &quot;smell&quot; what is around it.

==Subspecies==
*Eastern smooth green snake, &quot;Opheodrys vernalis vernalis&quot; 
*Western smooth green snake, &quot;Opheodrys vernalis blanchardi&quot; 
*Northern smooth green snake, &quot;Opheodrys vernalis borealis&quot; 

&quot;Nota bene&quot;: A trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the subspecies was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Opheodrys&quot;.

==Etymology==
The subspecific name, &quot;blanchardi&quot;, is in honor of American herpetologist Frank N. Blanchard.

==Geographic range==

The smooth green snake is native to the Nearctic region. The range spreads through southeastern Canada, west to Saskatchewan, and south through Illinois and Virginia. It can also be found in other areas, such as in Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Iowa, Missouri, Texas, and Northern Mexico.

==Threats==
&quot;O. vernalis&quot; is hunted by various predators, including the red-tailed hawk, great blue heron, rough-legged buzzard, bears, raccoons, foxes, and the common house cat. Humans also find this snake in the wild and keep it for a pet. It is subjected to commercial collection because of its attractive skin coloration, passive nature, and small size. However, this snake is not known to survive well in captivity. Because its populations are usually isolated and small in size, this commercial collection can greatly affect the overall population.

The smooth green snake population is also declining due to the use of pesticides, as well as destruction of habitats. Pesticides are particularly harmful to the snake when used in riparian areas, mountain foothills and meadows. Because the smooth green snake&#x27;s diet consists mainly of insects, insecticides put the snake at great risk in areas where they are applied. The reduction of its prey is a major cause of the death of the snakes, as well as one of the most important natural threats to its population.

Habitat destruction is caused by road building, logging, cattle grazing, and the draining of streams. Logging and mining conducted in a smooth green snake habitat can be a source of snake mortality. Roads and highways are a major cause of deaths, especially those near streams or other habitats the snake occupies. Livestock grazing has been found to reduce snake populations in some areas, where five times the amount of snakes were found on ungrazed areas, compared to grazed areas. The effects of livestock grazing include the reduction of grass, changes in tree species, compaction of soil, and more erosion, which affect the reptile population in these areas. Flooding, freezing, and destruction of dens can destroy large numbers of smooth green snakes, as well as other species of snake with which it may hibernate.

Human recreational activities, such as off-road vehicles near wetlands, are also damaging its habitat. Lakes and streams are enjoyable areas for recreation, but human activity in these areas can degrade them. The use of off-road vehicles in or around wetlands, however, is the most damaging recreational activity. Mud bogging significantly damages and destroys these areas. Also, oil and gasoline from off-road vehicles has been found in snake habitats.

==Conservation status==
The smooth green snake is of least concern in terms of conservation, but the concern is increasing in the U.S. with some states citing anecdotal evidence of fewer sightings and residential sprawl.
While there is some research showing the population of the snake is declining, only a small number of states (Iowa, Missouri, Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado and Texas) protect the smooth green snake with conservation laws. This law prohibits commercial collection of the snake and collection by individuals.

==Habitat==
&quot;O. vernalis&quot; can be found in many different habitats, including marshes, meadows, the edges of streams, and open woods. It prefers to be on the ground, in open areas without a lot of shrubs. During hibernation, the smooth green snake looks for burrows, ant hills, and other dug-out underground areas, normally gathering in large numbers. It prefers moist habitats and areas near permanent water sources, usually staying in green areas for camouflage. Being cold blooded, it prefers warm areas, lying in the sun on rocks and logs, also using them for hiding.

==Behavior==
The smooth green snake relies on an environment matching its green scales for camouflage to protect itself from predators. If threatened, a smooth green snake will usually flee. It is a docile snake, seldom biting and usually allowing humans to come close. If provoked, it can secrete a substance from its anal gland, causing a foul smell. When handled by humans, it usually shows excited behavior and calms down after wrapping itself around a finger. When it hunts, it turns its head from side to side, finding prey with its tongue. The flicking of the tongue gathers air near the snake&#x27;s head, and the Jacobson&#x27;s organ (on the roof of its mouth) interprets the airborne pheromones and chemical signals. The green snake has no ears, relying on vibrations to figure out its surroundings. Its sight is relatively strong, at least over short distances. Due to the stretchy ligaments in its jaw, it can swallow prey whole, even prey that is larger than its own body diameter. It can shed its skin as often as every four to five weeks, allowing for new growth.

During months when the weather is warmer, the smooth green snake tends to be active both day and night; in the colder, winter months, it hibernates in social groups. Ant hills and burrows of other animals are used during hibernation as part-time homes.

==Diet==
The smooth green snake mostly eats insects and spiders, including spineless caterpillars, harvestmen, moths, ants, snails, worms, and slugs. While hunting, it uses both chemical and visual clues to find prey, and kills with a strike instead of constriction.

==Reproduction==
Sexually mature smooth green snakes mate in the late spring or summer, and gravid females lay eggs from June to September. Usually, two clutches are laid, each containing four to six eggs. Females usually lay their eggs in rodent burrows, mounds of rotting vegetation, sawdust piles, or rotting logs. In the northern habitats of this species, communal nesting has been observed. Smooth green snake eggs are white and oval; they have thin shells and are about one inch (2.5 cm) in length. Each egg has an average mass of 2.6 grams. The eggs hatch four to 23 days after being laid.

<doc id="1190736" wikidata="Q7004730" url="?curid=1190736" title="Neville Howse">
<text>Major General Sir Neville Reginald Howse, (26 October 1863 – 19 September 1930) was an Australian Army officer, medical doctor, and politician. He was the first Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces.

Howse was born in Somerset, England, and followed his father into the medical profession. He emigrated to Australia in 1889 and eventually settled in Orange, New South Wales. During the Boer War, Howse served with the Australian medical corps. He was awarded the VC for his rescue of a wounded man at Vredefort in July 1900, while under heavy rifle fire. During the First World War, Howse served in New Guinea, Gallipoli, and on the Western Front. He oversaw the medical services of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and finished the war with the rank of major-general. He was elected to parliament in 1922, and was subsequently appointed to cabinet by Stanley Bruce. He served as Minister for Defence (1925–1927), Health (1925–1927; 1928–1929), and Home and Territories (1928).

==Early life==
Howse was born in Stogursey, Somerset, England, the son of Lucy Elizabeth (née Conroy) and Alfred Howse. He was educated at Fullard&#x27;s House School in Taunton. He chose to follow his father (a surgeon) into the medical profession, studying medicine at London Hospital. He attained the qualifications MRCS and LRCP in 1886, and subsequently became a demonstrator in anatomy at the University of Durham.

In 1889, Howse immigrated to Australia for health reasons. He initially settled in Newcastle, New South Wales, but later moved to Taree. He returned to England in 1895 for further studies, obtaining the rank of FRCS in 1897. He moved back to Australia in 1899 and bought a medical practice in Orange, which would remain his primary residence for the next 30 years except during his overseas military service.

==Military service==
===Boer War===
Howse served in the Second Boer War with the Second Contingent of the New South Wales Army Medical Corps, Australian Forces, arriving at East London, Eastern Cape, in February 1900 as a lieutenant.

On 24 July 1900, during the action at Vredefort, South Africa, Howse saw a trumpeter fall, and went through very heavy cross-fire to rescue the man. His horse was soon shot from under him, but he continued on foot, reached the casualty, dressed his wound, and then carried him to safety. For this action, Howse was awarded the Victoria Cross. The award was gazetted on 4 June 1901 and the original citation reads:
He thus became the first recipient of the Victoria Cross serving in the Australian armed forces; his medal is on display at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. Howse was subsequently promoted to captain on 15 October 1900.

The Second Contingent left South Africa via Cape Town on 13 December 1900 on the S.S. &quot;Orient&quot;, however Howse had been invalided to Britain on 28 November 1900. Howse subsequently returned to Australia at the end of February 1901. Following the gazetting of his VC, Howse was presented with the medal in a ceremony at Victoria Barracks, Sydney on 4 December 1901. Also at the ceremony were Captain A. Heathcote and Sergeant J. Paton, prior recipients of the VC for actions during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, who had subsequently migrated to New South Wales.

Howse returned to South Africa as a major with the Australian Army Medical Corps (AAMC) in command of the Bearer Company, arriving at Durban in Natal on 17 March 1902. Following service in Natal, Orange River Colony and Western Transvaal (attached to Colonel A.W. Thornycroft&#x27;s Mounted Infantry Column), at the conclusion of the war he became seriously ill. He was again invalided to Britain on 6 July 1902, with the remainder of the AAMC contingent departing for Australia on 8 July 1902. Howse eventually returned to Australia in November 1902.

In 1905 Howse married Evelyn Pilcher in Bathurst, and was twice elected to serve as mayor of the City of Orange.

===First World War===

When the First World War began, Howse was appointed principal medical officer to the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force to German New Guinea, with the rank of lieutenant colonel.

Following his time in New Guinea, he was appointed Assistant Director of Medical Services 1st Australian Division. During the Gallipoli campaign he took charge of evacuating wounded men from the beach in the campaign’s opening days. In 1917 at the Dardanelles commission, he described the arrangements for dealing with wounded men at Gallipoli as inadequate to the point of &#x27;criminal negligence&#x27;. He was Mentioned in Despatches for his service in this campaign.

In September 1915 he was given command of ANZAC medical services and in November became director of the AIF’s medical services, with the rank of surgeon-general. When the Australian Imperial Force moved to France, Howse took up a position in London, overseeing medical services in France, Egypt and Palestine. At the beginning of 1917 he was promoted to major general.

Howse was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1915 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours, was promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on 22 January 1917, and appointed Knight of Grace of the Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem and Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1919. From 1921 to 1925 he was Director-General of Medical Services.

==Politics==

In 1922, Howse resigned his army commission to enter politics, as regulations at the time forbade political campaigning by members of the regular army. He was elected to the House of Representatives, standing for the Nationalist Party in the Division of Calare. He subsequently represented Australia at the League of Nations Assembly in 1923. In January 1925, Howse was elevated to cabinet by Prime Minister Stanley Bruce as Minister for Defence and Minister for Health. In the defence portfolio his primary responsibility was for repatriation. He was a member of the Australian delegation to the 1926 Imperial Conference in London, but was taken ill and had to resign his portfolios in April 1927. He was kept on in the ministry as an honorary minister without portfolio.

In February 1928, Howse was reappointed Minister for Health and also made Minister for Home and Territories. He relinquished the latter portfolio in November 1928 after that year&#x27;s election. Howse made a significant impact during his two periods as health minister. He helped establish the Federal Health Council of Australia, supported the formation of the Australian College of Surgeons and the first conference of Australian cancer organisations, and was instrumental in the decision to site the Australian Institute of Anatomy in Canberra. In 1928, he convinced cabinet to spend the considerable sum of £100,000 to establish one of the world&#x27;s first radium banks, allowing Australia to become a centre of radiological research. He was also credited with inspiring public confidence in Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and the government&#x27;s immunisation programs, at a time when a series of fatalities – including the Bundaberg tragedy of 1928 – had led to a distrust of immunisation among the general population.

Howse lost his seat in parliament in the Labor landslide at the 1929 election.

==Death and legacy==

In February 1930, Howse travelled to England for medical treatment for cancer, but died on 19 September 1930, and is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London. His son, John Howse, was member for Calare from 1946 to 1960.

A statue by Peter Dornan depicting Howse&#x27;s act of bravery is on display at the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, Melbourne.

A postage stamp commemorating Howse was issued by Australia Post in 2000.

A one dollar coin designed by Wojciech Pietranik commemorating the centenary of Howse&#x27;s feat of arms was issued by the Royal Australian Mint in 2000.

He was a freemason.

<text>John Berryman VC (18 July 1825 – 27 June 1896) was a British Army non-commissioned officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Dudley, England, the son of a pub landlord, he enlisted in the 17th Lancers in May 1848 and served with the regiment throughout the Crimean War.

==Victoria Cross action==
Berriman was a 29 years old Troop Sergeant-Major in the 17th Lancers (Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Own) during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 25 October 1854 at Balaclava, Crimea, (&quot;see&quot; Charge of the Light Brigade) Troop Sergeant-Major Berryman, whose horse had been shot under him, stopped on the field with a wounded officer amidst a storm of shot and shell. Two sergeants (John Farrell and Joseph Malone) came to his assistance and between them they carried the wounded officer out of range of the guns. On a previous occasion Berryman had captured three Russian prisoners.

Berryman was invested with his VC by Queen Victoria in Hyde Park, London on 26 June 1857.

==Further career==
After serving in the Indian Mutiny in 1858, Berryman was made Regimental sergeant major of the 17th lancers in 1860, and commissioned as a lieutenant and quartermaster in 1864. He was with the regiment during the Zulu War in 1879. In May 1880 he transferred to the 5th lancers as quartermaster, receiving promotion to honorary captain in July 1881. He retired with the rank of honorary major in July 1883.

He died at Woldingham, Surrey in 1896 and is buried there in St Agatha&#x27;s Churchyard.

His VC is not publicly owned.

<doc id="1190753" wikidata="Q849804" url="?curid=1190753" title="British Rail Class 309">
<text>The British Rail Class 309 &quot;Clacton Express&quot; electric multiple units (EMUs) were built by British Rail (BR) York Carriage Works from 1962 to 1963. They were initially classified as Class AM9 before the introduction of TOPS. These units were the first express 25 kV alternating current (AC) units to be built by British Rail and were their first EMUs capable of 100 mph.

==Description and design==
Twenty-four units were built in three different configurations:
*601–608 – Two-car units (309/1)
*611–618 – Four-car units containing a griddle car (309/2)
*621–627 – Four-car units (309/3)
Each unit had identical electrical equipment. The original concept called for increasing the power-to-weight ratio when strengthening trains from eight to ten cars in peak periods using the 2-car units, in order to make the peak timetable more resilient.

Due to problems that had been encountered with the BR1 bogie design then current for Mk1 loco-hauled coaches, the Class 309s were built with Commonwealth bogies, much heavier than the more modern design, but more robust. The exception to this is vehicle E19608 which was originally a BR Class 123 Buffet Vehicle No. W59831. This was converted to a 309 griddle car but retained its B4 bogies, becoming the only vehicle in the class with this type. This vehicle also had 36 seats in the Buffet area compared to 24 in the other units.

More unusual was the front end design, incorporating the drivers cab but retaining passenger access between units via a pullman gangway, particularly necessary to allow access to the griddle car from all coaches. The design was based on the front end of the Class 303 but with the gangway placed centrally and also incorporating a headcode box. Also notable was the curved wrap-around glass on the cab windows, but these proved expensive to replace and later an additional pillar was inserted so that flat glass could be used. The units were originally class AM9 (AC Multiple Unit) pre-TOPS, and were painted in the BR standard coaching stock maroon livery lined black &amp; yellow, with the driving end gangway doors painted warning panel yellow.

Units 605-608 were expanded to 4 coaches in 1973 by the addition of a Corridor Second (SK) and a Corridor Composite (CK) and reclassified 309/4. In 1981 units 601-608 were again altered so that the formation became MBS-TC-DMS, and numbers 605-608 were reclassified back to 309/1.

==Operations==
When built, units were originally planned to be used on the Original Proposed East Coast Main Line Electrification Scheme, however, when this was abandoned the units were deployed on Great Eastern Main Line (GEML) express services from London Liverpool Street to Clacton-on-Sea and Walton-on-the-Naze (also marketed as the Sunshine Coast Line) which is what gained them the class nickname &quot;Clacton Express&quot;. Trains would be formed of three units in a ten-car formation (i.e. one two car unit, and two four car units). The train would divide at Thorpe-le-Soken, with one of the 4-cars units used on the Walton section, and the remaining six cars continuing to Clacton. The Clacton portion usually included the griddle car unit, and was always the second to leave Thorpe-le-Soken, being the rear (London end) portion of the coastbound train. The choice of building units with only two coaches may seem unusual, but these were intended only for use in strengthening pairs of four coach units at peak times to produce a ten coach train, and with this in mind they only had second class accommodation.

The Class 309 units were considerably more powerful than the Britannia pacifics that they replaced with a typical 10-coach formation (2 x 4-car units plus 1 x 2-car unit) producing 3,384 hp for tare. However, from 1971 it was found that additional capacity was required for the evening peak and the 17.40 departure from Liverpool Street station was increased to 12 coaches by the addition of a second 2-car unit bringing the power output up to 4,512 hp from a train of tare.

In the 1970s many of the units were reformed. The two-car units were augmented to four-car units.
In 1973-74 units 605–608 with the addition of TSK with TCK converted former Mk1 SK and CK coaches which formed in to 4 car sets. 
In 1978 units 601–604 with the addition of TCK and TSOL converted former Mk1 CK and TSO coaches which formed in to 4 car sets.
In the early 1980s units 611-618 had the griddle cars were taken out of use and replaced by TSOL from 601 to 604 and TSK from 605 to 608. 
601-608 were augmented to 3-car units until refurbishment work in 1985–86 
In 1986-87 refurbishment work required the addition of 8 Mk1 TSO coaches to be converted to TSO trailers for units 611–618 with the borrowed TSOL and TSK trailers all being converted to TSOL trailers and reformed back into 601–608.

The entire fleet was refurbished in the period 1985–1987, with the single-glazed wooden framed windows replaced by aluminium-framed double-glazed units with hopper ventilators. Another change was 2 + 2 seating in open saloons replacing the second class compartments, this change producing an increase in seating capacity.

The first refurbished units outshopped were painted in the bold new London and SouthEastern &quot;Jaffa Cake&quot; livery. However, this was soon superseded by the equally bold Network SouthEast livery, which was introduced in 1986. Coinciding with the refurbishment work, in 1985 electrification spread north from Colchester to Ipswich, and later to Harwich and Norwich. This meant the Class 309 units were soon introduced on fast trains to Ipswich and Harwich.

In 1989, new Class 321/3 units were introduced onto GEML services partially replacing both class 309 and Class 312 diagrams. The &quot;Clacton Express&quot; units however continued until May 1992 in main service and then a reduced fleet operated a few rush hour services until January 1994. The last units were withdrawn on 22 January 1994, despite their recent and expensive refurbishment. After working a final railtour (15 January 1994) and the week of normal services a final Saturday diagram was run with 309626/613/616 ending on the 1800 Liverpool Street - Clacton. However, not all units were immediately scrapped, and seven were retained for possible reuse around Manchester on suburban trains. These units were stored at Blackpool.

In 1994, North West Regional Railways (NWRR) acquired the seven redundant units stored at Blackpool. The units, nos. 309613/616/617/624/626/627, were quickly put to use on suburban passenger services from Manchester Piccadilly to Crewe and Stoke-on-Trent. Six of the units were repainted in NWRR blue livery with a green stripe. The seventh, no. 309624, was repainted in a special blue livery to commemorate the opening a new railway line to Manchester International Airport in 1996. Upon privatisation, the units passed to the North Western Trains (NWT) franchise. This was later renamed First North Western (FNW) following FirstGroup taking 100% ownership of Great Western Holdings.

By the late 1990s, the seven units saw continued use around Manchester. They also saw some use on longer distance services, with one booked daily Manchester Piccadilly-Birmingham International service and return. On occasion, units were used on NWT&#x27;s Manchester-London Euston service, deputising for a non-available Class 322 unit. At one point, it was planned to use the units on a new - stopping service, but this did not happen. However, the end was in sight, because as part of their franchise commitment, FNW had to replace their slam-door rolling stock, including the Class 309 units. New Class 175 diesel multiple units were introduced in 2000, and FNW discontinued its Manchester-Euston service. This meant that the &quot;Clacton Express&quot; units were surplus to requirements. As a farewell gesture, three units were used on a final railtour from Manchester to their old haunt of via London Liverpool Street. Following this tour, all seven units were withdrawn in late 2000, and sent for storage at MoD Pig&#x27;s Bay near Shoeburyness. Two of the units later saw further use in departmental service, whilst the remaining five were scrapped in 2004.

==Further use==
Following withdrawal from normal service, three units were transferred to Eastleigh works: numbers 616, 617 and 624. In 2001, two of these units were converted to Class 960 departmental units for cab-signalling tests at the Old Dalby test track. They were reduced in length to 3 cars and painted in a blue and white livery. The new units&#x27; designations were 960101 (ex-309616), named &quot;West Coast Flyer&quot;, and 960102 (ex-309624), named &quot;New Dalby&quot;. They were withdrawn in 2004, following completion of the tests and were stored at MoD Pig&#x27;s Bay, near Shoeburyness, Essex, until early 2009 when they entered preservation. The third unit, 617, was used as a spares donor and sat derelict at Eastleigh until it was scrapped in August 2004.

Finally, one vehicle from 309623 survives; its TSO was purchased by West Coast Railways in 2003 for eventual spares use. It has, however, remained unrestored at Carnforth MPD, still in its Regional Railways livery.

==Preservation==
Several attempts since their original withdrawal from the London to Clacton route in 1994 have been made to preserve a Class 309 by a number of organisations that have never come to much more than attempts. Preservation actions have included trying to originally preserve 309605 and 309606 at Ilford in spring 1994, an attempt around their completion of First North Western services to preserve a unit (309623), then and at least one other time all not coming to any fruition. However, once no further work was found for them in test train use, units 309616 and 309624 were successfully preserved by AMPSRail Limited in 2009, and went to the Electric Railway Museum, Warwickshire. However, when this was forced to close in 2018, the sale of 624 was used to fund transport costs for 616, and the two sets were split up, both going to different homes.

616, still in the care of AMPSRail, ended up at the Tanat Valley Light Railway in Oswestry. Here it has remained as a static exhibit with the interior now used as a Cafe and tea room, titled &quot;The Clacton Cafe&quot;

624 was sold to the Lavender Line and arrived in 2018. Minor conservation work was carried out, but due to changing priorities at the railway, the set was put up for sale in 2021. In March 2022, the unit was purchased by the CEPG, funded by a private benefactor. It remained at the Lavender line in storage while options for future preservation were explored.

In May 2024, it was announced that the long term future of 624 had been secured. BDTC 75965 and MBS 61928 have been donated to the East Anglian Railway Museum, where a full restoration of both vehicles has been committed to. Due to a lack of space at the EARM DTS 75972 has been donated to the Rushden, Higham and Wellingborough Railway who intend to restore it to operational condition.

<text>Silicate minerals are rock-forming minerals made up of silicate groups. They are the largest and most important class of minerals and make up approximately 90 percent of Earth&#x27;s crust.

In mineralogy, the crystalline forms of silica (silicon dioxide, ) are usually considered to be tectosilicates, and they are classified as such in the Dana system (75.1). However, the Nickel-Strunz system classifies them as oxide minerals (4.DA). Silica is found in nature as the mineral quartz, and its polymorphs.

On Earth, a wide variety of silicate minerals occur in an even wider range of combinations as a result of the processes that have been forming and re-working the crust for billions of years. These processes include partial melting, crystallization, fractionation, metamorphism, weathering, and diagenesis.
Living organisms also contribute to this geologic cycle. For example, a type of plankton known as diatoms construct their exoskeletons (&quot;frustules&quot;) from silica extracted from seawater. The frustules of dead diatoms are a major constituent of deep ocean sediment, and of diatomaceous earth.

==General structure==
A silicate mineral is generally an inorganic compound consisting of subunits with the formula [SiO2+&quot;n&quot;]2&quot;n&quot;−. Although depicted as such, the description of silicates as anions is a simplification. Balancing the charges of the silicate anions are metal cations, M&quot;x&quot;+. Typical cations are Mg2+, Fe2+, and Na+. The Si-O-M linkage between the silicates and the metals are strong, polar-covalent bonds. Silicate anions ([SiO2+&quot;n&quot;]2&quot;n&quot;−) are invariably colorless, or when crushed to a fine powder, white. The colors of silicate minerals arise from the metal component, commonly iron.

In most silicate minerals, silicon is tetrahedral, being surrounded by four oxides. The coordination number of the oxides is variable except when it bridges two silicon centers, in which case the oxide has a coordination number of two.

Some silicon centers may be replaced by atoms of other elements, still bound to the four corner oxygen corners. If the substituted atom is not normally tetravalent, it usually contributes extra charge to the anion, which then requires extra cations. For example, in the mineral orthoclase , the anion is a tridimensional network of tetrahedra in which all oxygen corners are shared. If all tetrahedra had silicon centers, the anion would be just neutral silica . Replacement of one in every four silicon atoms by an aluminum atom results in the anion , whose charge is neutralized by the potassium cations .

==Main groups==
In mineralogy, silicate minerals are classified into seven major groups according to the structure of their silicate anion:

Tectosilicates can only have additional cations if some of the silicon is replaced by an atom of lower valence such as aluminum. Al for Si substitution is common.

==Nesosilicates or orthosilicates==

Nesosilicates (from Greek &#x27;island&#x27;), or orthosilicates, have the orthosilicate ion, present as isolated (insular) tetrahedra connected only by interstitial cations. The Nickel–Strunz classification is 09.A –examples include:

*Phenakite group

==Sorosilicates==

Sorosilicates (from Greek &#x27;heap, mound&#x27;) have isolated pyrosilicate anions , consisting of double tetrahedra with a shared oxygen vertex—a silicon:oxygen ratio of 2:7. The Nickel–Strunz classification is 09.B. Examples include:

*Thortveitite –

**Dollaseite-(Ce) – 
*Vesuvianite (idocrase) – 

==Cyclosilicates==


Cyclosilicates (from Greek &#x27;circle&#x27;), or ring silicates, have three or more tetrahedra linked in a ring. The general formula is (Si&quot;x&quot;O3&quot;x&quot;)2&quot;x&quot;−, where one or more silicon atoms can be replaced by other 4-coordinated atom(s). The silicon:oxygen ratio is 1:3. Double rings have the formula (Si2&quot;x&quot;O5&quot;x&quot;)2&quot;x&quot;− or a 2:5 ratio. The Nickel–Strunz classification is 09.C. Possible ring sizes include:

Some example minerals are:
* 3-member single ring
** Benitoite – 
* 4-member single ring
** Papagoite – .
* 6-member single ring
**Beryl – 
**Bazzite – 
**Sugilite –

**Osumilite – 
**Cordierite – 
**Sekaninaite – 
* 9-member single ring
** Eudialyte – 
* 6-member double ring
**Milarite – 

The ring in axinite contains two B and four Si tetrahedra and is highly distorted compared to the other 6-member ring cyclosilicates.

==Inosilicates==

Inosilicates (from Greek [genitive: ] &#x27;fibre&#x27;), or chain silicates, have interlocking chains of silicate tetrahedra with either , 1:3 ratio, for single chains or , 4:11 ratio, for double chains. The Nickel–Strunz classification is 09.D – examples include:

<text>The Isle of Wight Railway was a railway company on the Isle of Wight, United Kingdom; it operated of railway line between Ryde and Ventnor. It opened the first section of line from Ryde to Sandown in 1864, later extending to Ventnor in 1866. The Ryde station was at St Johns Road, some distance from the pier where the majority of travellers arrived. A tramway operated on the pier itself, and a street-running tramway later operated from the Pier to St Johns Road. It was not until 1880 that two mainland railways companies jointly extended the railway line to the Pier Head, and IoWR trains ran through, improving the journey arrangements.

An independent company built a branch line from Brading to Bembridge, and the IoWR operated passenger trains on the line from 1882, and later absorbed the owning company. The IoWR was itself absorbed into the Southern Railway in the &quot;grouping&quot; of 1923.

The Bembridge branch closed in 1953, and in 1966 the Ryde Pier Head to Ventnor line was truncated to terminate at Shanklin. This was electrified, and former London Underground tube train stock was brought into use on the line; this arrangement continues to the present day.

==First proposals==
In the first years of the 19th century, the Isle of Wight was established as a successful agricultural base, and there was some fishing. Cowes, on the River Medina, was the principal port, and Newport was the main industrial town. Ryde was an established town, but Shanklin had a population of 355 (in 1851) and Sandown was only a village.

The idea of visiting the Isle of Wight for reasons now described as tourism began to take hold, but these activities were limited by the poor internal transport facilities on the island. The easy money of the middle years of the 1840s encouraged the promotion of railway schemes, and in May 1845 public support was sought for an &quot;Isle of Wight Railway&quot;, which was proposed to build from West Cowes and Ryde to Newport and Ventnor. Capital of £300,000 was said to be necessary, but notwithstanding local support, the landowners to be affected were hostile and the scheme failed to gain approval.

Nevertheless, and in October of the same year a &quot;Direct Ryde and Ventnor Railway&quot; was proposed; requiring only £120,000 in capital it would follow much easier ground and claimed that landowners would not object to it; this scheme fared equally badly and was almost immediately abandoned. The end of the Railway Mania resulted in the cessation of railway scheme promotion for some time, and it was not until 1852 that further railways were proposed, but these too failed to gain support.

In 1858 three viable schemes were developed and their bills were deposited in Parliament; they were

* The Isle of Wight Railway (Eastern Section); to run from Ryde to Upper Bonchurch, with branches to Brading and Shanklin, and a tramway to Ryde Pier; electric telegraphs were also included;
* The Isle of Wight Railway; to run from Cowes to Ryde via Newport, with branches to Ventnor and Ryde Pier;
* The Cowes and Newport Railway.

Of these, only the Cowes and Newport Railway was passed, as the Cowes and Newport (Isle of Wight) Railway Act 1859 (22 &amp; 23 Vict. c. xciv), on 8 August 1859, the other two being rejected in the Lords&#x27; Committee.

==A viable scheme==

The promoters of the Eastern Section railway reconsidered the route they had proposed, and determined to improve on it by taking the line through Wroxall and ending it in Ventnor. They submitted a fresh bill for the 1860 session; the line was now to be named the Isle of Wight (Eastern Section) Railway. The Cowes and Newport Railway also submitted a bill, seeking to extend their railway and rename it &quot;The Isle of Wight Railway&quot;; the extensions were to be to Ryde and Ventnor, with a long line connecting the other two and forming a triangle. However this bill failed standing orders and was rejected. A number of objections to the IoW(ES)R Bill were heard, but none was effective and the bill secured the royal assent on 23 July 1860 as the (23 &amp; 24 Vict. c. clxii).

The railway authorised was from Melville Street (at the south end of the later tunnel at Ryde) to Ventnor, with branches to Brading and Sandown Bay; the authorised share capital was £125,000. Melville Street was the nearest the railway could get to the pier without expensive tunnelling and a station was planned there. A street-running tramway was to reach the pier from there. (The Sandown Bay line and the extension north from St Johns Road to Melville Street were not built. The &quot;branch to Brading&quot; was a short line to a wharf on the river.)

The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway and the London and South Western Railway were authorised to raise £20,000 each and to subscribe that sum to the . Captain Mark Huish, formerly the ruthless and successful General Manager of the London and North Western Railway had retired and lived near Ventnor, and he was invited to assist the directors in planning their railway construction. Huish suggested that the railway contractor Thomas Brassey could be persuaded to build the line if the LBSCR and LSWR would subscribe their £20,000 and one of them would agree to work the line. The Directors were relieved to have Huish&#x27;s experience on board—none of them had experience of railway construction. On 5 February 1861 Brassey&#x27;s company undertook to build the railway for £123,000, but this was for a single track of railway and exclusive of land acquisition, legal costs, and stations. The sum would exhaust the company&#x27;s share capital. Worse was to follow: the LBSCR and the LSWR were in a state of competitive hostility, and the idea of collaboration was impossible.

Negotiations dragged on for some time; the board earnestly hoped that Brassey could be persuaded to build the line, but without the guarantees Brassey feared that the company as his client would become insolvent, and he declined.

Early in 1862 tenders were considered by the board; none of them were acceptable or affordable. On 20 March 1862 the engineer John Fowler was appointed as Engineer to the Company. He was asked to review the design and specification for the line&#x27;s construction, and on 4 November 1862 a quotation from Henry Bond was put to the board with Fowler&#x27;s support. For £126,000 he would build the line from Ryde to Ventnor with a Brading branch. In the first days of 1863 this, the largest construction project on the island, started work. A further contract for £17,500 with Bond was later concluded for stations and signalling.

The Isle of Wight Eastern Section Railway Act 1860 had authorised an extension northwards from St Johns Road to Melville Street, in order to make a terminal there for a street-running tramway to the pier. Much controversy had been generated in Ryde over the adverse effect on amenity in the area, and the company decided on 12 March 1863 to abandon the attempt to extend to Melville Street. Discussions took place with the Ryde Pier Company with a view to joint construction of a railway to the pier, but the talks broke down and in 1864 the idea was dropped. The Sandown Bay branch, also authorised in 1860, was abandoned.
The company name was changed to the &quot;Isle of Wight Railway&quot; by the (26 &amp; 27 Vict. c. ccxxxii) of 28 July 1863. The name was considered to be more in keeping with the status of the company, as the bill had proposed a branch to Newport, there to join with the Cowes and Newport Railway. However negotiations with that company over the arrangements proved impossible, so that although the proposal had appeared in the bill, it was deleted before it was enacted.

Optimistic statements were made about early completion and opening of the line, but on 18 February 1864 a shareholders&#x27; meeting was informed that some land remained to be acquired for the line. Nevertheless, on 1 June 1864 the company secretary wrote to the Board of Trade giving notice that the railway would open in a month. There was then a delay with the rolling stock but Colonel Yolland made the Board of Trade inspection on 19 August. In fact this was only for the section from Ryde to Shanklin. Yolland found a number of detail points—the track ballast was chalk—but recommended approval for opening the line. The line opened from Ryde to Shanklin on 23 August 1864.

Carryings on the first section were encouraging, but constructing the tunnel at Ventnor was proving difficult. In fact the contractor was unable to complete it and went into administration, under its creditor, the finance company Warrant Finance. Eventually the work was substantially ready, although much cost-cutting had taken place. Colonel Yolland made an inspection in August 1866, but this time there were many deficiencies, including defective track. Receiving his report, the Board of Trade declined to approve the opening. Although the company was desperately short of money, it appears that some directors personally funded direct action by the contractor to rectify the problems, and Yolland reported again on 8 September 1866, this time recommending approval for the opening.

On Monday 10 September 1866 the extension to Ventnor opened for passenger traffic; goods traffic did not require Board of Trade approval and had already been started. The station at Ventnor was reported to be &quot;far from complete&quot;, and it was above sea level. Ventnor tunnel was 1,312 yards in length.

During the 1860s the IWES built a short spur railway at Brading to a wooden wharf on the River Yar; the river was badly silted but small vessels could work on it.

The finances of the company had been severely strained; a shareholders&#x27; committee reported, &quot;Your committee regret to have to state that the available assets at the disposal of the company are practically nil.&quot;

==Operation and traffic==
There were eleven journeys each way on weekdays and two on Sundays when the line opened as far as Shanklin. The journey time was typically 25 minutes. By November 1864, the weekday service was reduced to seven trains each way. Passenger business was better than expected, although that at Brading was disappointing. When the line was extended to Ventnor, the same number of trains ran, and the journey time Ryde to Ventnor was 30 minutes.

The passenger accommodation at Ryde was extremely limited, and within two years a second platform was provided to handle a more frequent train service than had been envisaged. During this period a turntable was put out of use, as the entire locomotive stock was tank engines. At Shanklin the line originally ended in a turntable used for engine release purposes, but this too was removed when the line was extended to Ventnor.

The line was operated in two signal sections, from Ryde to Sandown and from Sandown to Ventnor, and the train staff and ticket system was used. Sandown was the only intermediate station at which passenger trains could cross, but the loop was on the north side of the station and only one platform was provided there. Ventnor station opened with a single narrow platform, but by 1872, a second platform face was provided there too.

By this time Ryde Pier (the second structure) was 745 yards in length, and travellers using it had a long walk to the shore; this was a serious competitive disadvantage compared to Cowes, where no such difficulty existed. A horse tramway started operation on the pier itself on 27 August 1864, but the gap from the pier to the station at St Johns Road had no railway connection, and for some time was a source of inconvenience.

Much of the seasonal traffic came from the mainland, and despite the inconvenience of the gap from the pier to the station, the traffic was buoyant. In 1867 it was decided to run 14 trains each way on weekdays, and this put a strain on the engine power available to the line. Goods traffic was run at night to free up the resources for passenger trains, but the goods traffic was important to the island economy; much of it came in through Brading Harbour. This included considerable volumes of building materials, feeding the development of residential and boarding house building.

In 1867, 384,000 passenger journeys were made, with goods traffic receipts amounting to about 10% of the passenger income. However, in that year working expenses had ballooned due to unspecified exceptional expenditure, and slightly exceeded the gross income. In subsequent years working expenses settled down to 65% (1869) and 63% (1870) of gross receipts.

Maycock states that during the summer of 1867 there were extensive military manoeuvres in Sandown Bay and a temporary halt was opened, named either Yarbridge or Morton Common, but this is not confirmed by other sources.

The nuisance of the long gap between the pier and the IoWR station continued to be objectionable; a connection had long been proposed. A major difficulty was that local residents objected to the degradation of the view at the sea front by any tramway construction, as the gradients into the town would require substantial engineering works; moreover the foreseen smoke nuisance from locomotives was objected to. However on 7 August 1871, a street-running horse tramway was opened by the Ryde Pier Company between the pier and the station. The tramway terminated on the north side of St Johns Road and the railway was extended across the road to meet it. The station platforms were lengthened, and engine release movements from the platforms now had to cross the road twice to complete the manoeuvre. The tramway passed through an archway on the ground floor of a house (17 The Strand) at the junction of The Strand and Cornwall Street in Ryde; the archway has now been closed and a bay window installed.

Although business was brisk, the Company was perpetually short of capital, and some dubious measures were adopted; income rose during 1872 but it was swallowed up by pre-existing cash liabilities. The Board negotiated a bank loan of £1,500 to pay interest on other loans, and this loan had to be guaranteed by a director personally. That year the Board declared a dividend on its preference stock, although payment had to be made by the issue of additional preference stock.

An accident took place on 15 April 1871 when two trains collided head on in the single line section near Sandown. It emerged that the train staff and ticket regulations for operating single lines safely were frequently ignored by the signalmen.

==IoWR rolling stock==
At the outset, the Isle of Wight Railway ordered a fleet of standardized tank engines from Beyer Peacock, as well as 24 passenger carriages, four of which had brake compartments, and 30 open wagons from the Oldbury Carriage and Wagon Company. In 1865, the railway ordered 10 more wagons and bought two carriages from the Ryde Pier Company. In 1872, a luggage van was also added to the stock. In 1873 five third class coaches were ordered. Three second class coaches were purchased in 1875 and another luggage van in 1876. In 1882, two composite coaches and four seconds were ordered, the last new carriages bought for the railway. In 1885, three carriages were bought from the Oldbury Company; they had originally been built for the Golden Valley Railway in 1881 but returned when that company was unable to pay for them. These were two saloons, one first class and one second class; the third vehicle was a brake van. Between 1897 and 1898, the IWR purchased ten second-hand North London Railway carriages. Six were first class and four second. The first class vehicles entered service as a first (later converted to a composite), a composite and four seconds. Of the NLR carriages bought as seconds three became thirds while the fourth and two Oldbury carriages were rebuilt at Ryde to passenger luggage vans. In 1914 eighteen former Metropolitan Railway carriages were acquired, enabling scrapping of many of the earliest vehicles. Two more were withdrawn in 1920 with the remaining 49 lasting to grouping in 1923. At the grouping, the IWR had 38 passenger coaches and 19 non-passenger coaching stock vehicles. The passenger coaches comprised twenty third-class (allotted SR numbers 2421–40) and eighteen composites (SR nos. 6329–46). The non-passenger coaching stock comprised ten passenger guard&#x27;s vans (SR 980–9), seven open carriage trucks (4378–84). one luggage van (2231) and one horse box (3368).

There were 221 goods vehicles lasting to grouping in 1923. These comprised 189 open goods wagons (allotted SR numbers 27787–27975), thirteen flat trucks (SR nos. 59011–23), twelve covered goods wagons (SR 46975–86), three cattle wagons (53377–9), two tar tanks (61381–2) and two brake vans (56033–4). In addition to these, there were three in departmental stock: two travelling cranes (SR nos. 425S and 426S) and a match truck (SR no. 426SM). The open goods wagons were also used for coal, and had carrying capacities ranging from . The flat trucks included five designated as timber trucks – these had a transverse bolster to support the load. The two cranes were both hand-operated, and could lift respectively; and the match truck was used to support the jib of crane no. 426S when travelling.

==Other railways==
The Cowes and Newport Railway had been the first line to be opened on the Isle of Wight, in 1862.

A connection to Ryde was made by the Ryde and Newport Railway, which met the IoWR at Smallbrook, south of Ryde. The IoWR constructed a second track alongside its own from Smallbrook to Ryde and the R&amp;NR used that track and the IoWR Ryde station, paying a rental for the purpose. The R&amp;NR opened to traffic from a station near Newport on 20 December 1875. The RNR asked the IoWR to work their line and that belonging to the Cowes &amp; Newport Railway, but the IoWR shareholders voted the proposal down. The RNR was worked by locomotives loaned by Henry Martin, the contractor working the CNR; six months later a Joint Committee of the two companies took over the operation of their railways.

The Isle of Wight (Newport Junction) Railway constructed a line between Sandown, on the IoWR, and Newport. The company experienced difficulties in finalising the access to Newport, and the line opened between Sandown and Shide on 1 February 1875, later extending to Newport on 1 June 1879. In 1880 the line was purchased by the Cowes and Newport company.

==Proposed unification of island railways==
The idea that the Island railways should be worked as one entity by a joint committee of the LSWR and LBSCR was gaining support. In December 1875 Herapath&#x27;s Railway Journal reported a story that the mainland companies had offered to work the Isle of Wight railways for 50 per cent of gross receipts and claimed that such a course would be profitable to all concerned. Maycock and Silbury say, &quot;They reckoned without the IoWR shareholders who knew their company already cost less than 50 per cent to operate and, being the most profitable of the Island railways, an agreement of this nature would benefit other companies at their expense.&quot; They quote 47% (on page 86) but 73% in 1871 and 50% in 1880.

==Extending to Ryde Pier==
The horse tramway from Ryde Pier to the IoWR St John&#x27;s Road station was overwhelmed by the numbers of passengers during the summer months, and many proposals were put forward for the construction of a railway. Delegations of local people in the island attended meetings with a joint committee of the LSWR and LBSCR, and they demanded a proper railway at Ryde. The two mainland companies had collaborated in forming a joint connection to Portsmouth on the mainland and saw that their business to the Isle of Wight was limited by the poor connection at Ryde, so they acceded to the idea, and agreed to construct the link themselves.
A bill was submitted to the 1877 session of Parliament for powers to build a widened pier and a railway to St John&#x27;s Road, in tunnel for much of the way from the Esplanade. The mainland companies intended to operate the trains themselves as far as St Johns Road; the island companies would take them on from there. The (40 &amp; 41 Vict. c. cvii) passed on 23 July. On further consideration it was agreed that the IWR and R&amp;NR would have running powers to the Pier Head and work their own trains through; they would pay a toll of 3d per passenger booked to or from Ryde, including St Johns Road. Construction began during 1878 and took two years to complete; the St Johns Road level crossing was replaced by a bridge. The difficulty of passing the new line under the Esplanade, considered an important beauty spot in Ryde, led to the line being built with a low headroom (at 12 ft 3in); this was to limit the introduction of some traction designs in later years. IoWR trains began working to Ryde Esplanade station on 5 April 1880 and to Ryde Pier Head on 12 July 1880; the horse tramway was shortened to serve the length of the pier only. The new railway did not carry goods traffic.

The pier was unique in the United Kingdom in having a complete railway station at its seaward end; the railway on the pier formed a single signalling section, from Pier Head to Esplanade.

Five or six steamers could berth at the pier simultaneously. The Port of Portsmouth and Ryde United Steam Packet Company operated the ferry between Portsmouth and Ryde, but in 1879 the LSWR and LBSCR secured an act of Parliament, the South Western and the Brighton Railway Companies (Steam Vessels) Act 1879 (42 &amp; 43 Vict. c. xxx) authorising the raising of £50,000 each to begin a competing service. In fact the ferry company decided to sell its business to the railway companies, and it did so in 1880.

At Ryde, the opening of the LSWR/LBSCR joint railway in 1880 at least meant that passengers could board a through carriage there for Ventnor or Newport. The IoWR claimed compensation for the &#x27;injurious&#x27; effects of the railway on its property at St John&#x27;s Road. A refreshment room at St Johns Road would suffer loss of business, they claimed, The issue went to arbitration and the IoWR was awarded £1,033. The change revolutionised passenger transport to the island and Portsmouth became the principal mainland access point.

The pier tramway was converted to electric traction in 1886; the electricity was generated by an Otto gas engine and a Siemens dynamo, an arrangement that continued until 1927.

==Financial situation improved==
The IWR&#x27;s financial performance improved in the 1880s. The company acquired additional locomotives and rolling stock; stations were enhanced and track renewals were carried out. There was opposition from some shareholders who saw the expenditure as money that should be distributed to them as dividends.
Shareholder dissatisfaction with the management of the IoWR continued to simmer despite the declaration of the highest-ever dividend on the ordinary stock. At a shareholders&#x27; meeting on 21 February 1883, a shareholder complained that running costs were too high, at 53% of gross receipts. In fact shareholders could expect a regular dividend as high as any paid by a railway company in Great Britain, but the differing classes of stock, with preference and debenture issues, which had differing levels of dividend distribution, continued to generate dissatisfaction. In 1889 the company placed a bill before Parliament to consolidate and rearrange the capital: it received royal assent as the (53 &amp; 54 Vict. c. cxxxvii) on 25 July 1890. The authorised capital was £402,312 and borrowings amounted to £196,911.

==Safety improvements==
The absence of modern safety devices became an issue for practically all the railways of Great Britain in the 1870s, and in October 1875 a proposal had been put forward for the introduction of block signalling. Preece&#x27;s Block Instruments were installed between Ryde and Sandown, and a new signal box was commissioned at Brading in 1882. The trains staff and ticket system was still in use, but in April 1891 trials began with the Webb and Thompson Electric Train Staff; by September 1891 the whole line from Ryde to Ventnor was equipped. Continuous brakes too were now a necessity and in January 1892 the board decided to fit the Westinghouse air brake at an estimated cost of £1,740.

The layout at Shanklin was considerably altered to allow trains to cross at the station; the use of a second passenger platform required a subway.

==Passenger timetable==
The popularity of Ventnor as a winter resort for invalids led to the introduction of a special train in the Autumn of 1891. The LBSCR operated a fast train that left London Victoria station at noon. After the ferry crossing an IoWR train left Ryde Pier Head at 15:15 and ran non-stop to Ventnor in 21 minutes.

In the winter of 1894-1895 there were 12 return workings to Ventnor, increasing to 16 on Saturdays in summer.

==Bembridge branch==

===Brading Harbour Improvement Company===

Brading Harbour was located at Bembridge, a few miles from the village of Brading, and the harbour was doing good business. On 7 August 1874, the Brading Harbour Improvement Railway and Works Company obtained an authorising act of Parliament, the (37 &amp; 38 Vict. c. cxcv), to build an embankment between St Helens and Bembridge, quays near St Helens Mill and a railway along the north edge of the harbour to join the short IoWR Brading wharf goods branch. The authorised capital was £40,000. The company evidently found it difficult to raise the cash as the company was soon mortgaged to the House and Land Investment Trust Company Limited. The line appears to have opened for goods traffic on 29 August 1878, probably only between Brading IoWR and St Helens.
Completion of the harbour barrier proved difficult, partly due to damage by storms, and a further act of Parliament, the (44 &amp; 45 Vict. c. xxiv), had to be secured for an extension of time. This act also permitted the company to operate steam vessels between Brading Harbour and mainland ports. By June 1881 the BHIR was in the hands of a receiver. That month a Sunday School excursion train took local children to Ryde; a temporary platform was erected. Now in serious financial difficulties, the BHIR gave notice that its goods service between St Helens and Brading would be discontinued; whether the IoWR immediately took over working the goods trains in 1881 is not clear.
In an agreement of 28 February 1882 the Brading company and the IoWR arranged that the latter would work the line as part of its system for 50% of gross receipts. The IoWR used two BHIR locomotives, named St Helens and Bembridge, but provided rolling stock, station and maintenance staff itself. On 25 May 1882 Colonel Yolland inspected BHIR line, as well as the enlarged IoWR junction station at Brading and the IoWR goods branch to Brading Quay. Except for some attention to fencing, he found the BHIR line in good condition for the opening to passenger trains; there were stations at St Helens and Bembridge. The IoWR line was 43 chains in length; Brading station had been altered to provide a bay platform for the branch and a run-round loop; there was a level crossing near Brading Quay. The railway opened to passenger traffic on 27 May 1882. Because of lack of space at Bembridge station a sector plate was installed to give access to the run-round loop. It was of 16 ft 5 in length, but in 1936 it was replaced by a 25 ft turntable, for the introduction of the larger O2 class engines.

The BHIR&#x27;s primary interest had been developing the harbour and reclaiming land, but a general decline in agricultural land values wiped out that benefit. In April 1883 the IoWR Board decided to charge interest at % on the cost of enlarging Brading station for the BHIR. Steamers from the mainland started calling at Bembridge, and although this competed with the IoWR&#x27;s traffic at Ryde, the company agreed to operate trains in connection with those steamers.

===A train ferry===
The North British Railway had long been operating a train ferry for crossing the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Tay, and in 1881 Samuel L. Mason, former General Manager of the NBR, promoted the idea of a train ferry between the mainland and the Isle of Wight at St Helens. When the Tay crossing ceased operation in 1881, Mason purchased one of the vessels, the paddle steamer &quot;Carrier&quot;, as well as the approach ramps and winching gear, for £3,400. He made agreements with the LBSCR and the BHIR to construct transfer equipment at St Helens and at Langstone near Havant. On 14 February 1884 the &quot;Isle of Wight Marine Transit Company Limited&quot; was formed with capital of £30,000. The Transit company took over the agreements and the Carrier and the shore equipment for £28,425. Carrier could carry up to 14 wagons on two tracks, each having a maximum load of four tons.

The transfer ramps were installed at St Helens and Langstone, and services began on 1 September 1885, used by the LBSCR. In practice Carrier had difficulties in operating in the exposed waters of the Eastern Solent, but the LBSCR was persuaded that the undertaking was a worthwhile investment and bought the company in 1886. The service operated at a considerable loss until it ended on 31 March 1888. The gear at St Helens was sold for scrap in 1900.

===Brading Harbour Company===
The had long been in receivership and as part of a capital reconstruction it changed its name to the &quot;Brading Harbour and Railway Company&quot; (BHR) by the &#x27; (59 &amp; 60 Vict. c. ccxliii) of 14 August 1896. The railway part of the business was not much affected, but the United Realisation Company, a finance house which now owned the BHR, offered to sell the railway and quays to the IoWR. A price was agreed and the &#x27; (61 &amp; 62 Vict. c. cxcviii) of 2 August 1898 session authorised the transfer.

===Bembridge branch under the IoWR===
The IoWR had to expend considerable sums on improving the poor state of its branch line. A steam crane, station improvements, and extensive track modernisation were all on the list of work to be done. Later dredging too was added to the list.

Golf became a popular pastime in the 20th century, and several courses were established adjacent to the branch railway, bringing in significant passenger income.

The Bembridge steamers continued to work during the summer months, but they were never financially successful, and the outbreak of World War I resulted in the end of the service. The pier at Bembridge was condemned and removed in 1928.

==Rail motors==
In the first years of the twentieth century, railway companies sought for cheaper means of carrying passengers on lightly used lines. One solution was the railmotor, a combined small steam engine and passenger coach. The Isle of Wight Central Railway introduced such a vehicle on 4 October 1906 and it operated into Ryde. The inability to convey additional coaches or goods vehicles was a limitation, and the IoWCR discontinued the use of the vehicle in 1910.

==Electrification proposals==
From December 1908, a group calling itself the &quot;Electric Railways Syndicate&quot; pressed the supposed advantages of electrification of the Island&#x27;s railways. For £1.2 million all the railways of the island were to be purchased and electrified, using an overhead ac system similar to that being installed on the London Brighton and South Coast Railway suburban system. The electrification work itself was to cost about a quarter of the sum. A 4 MW power station would have been provided at Newport. The scheme included a number of line extensions and other improvements which inflated the cost; a frequent passenger service was planned.

The Electric Railways Syndicate did not bring any capital to the scheme; they needed others, including the local authorities, to provide that. No one else saw any advantage for the necessary outlay and in the first half of 1910 the scheme was abandoned.

==World War I==
During World War I the railways were taken under Government control; the owning companies were to be compensated, but in practice the money failed to address the deterioration of the physical assets. In December 1919 the IoWR reverted to its own control, and it was urgently necessary to modernise; the IoWR did not have much cash available for the purpose, and it was not possible to carry out all that was necessary. The Island continued to enjoy an increase in visitor numbers, and the railway benefited but was unable to cary the traffic with the desired level of efficiency; goods traffic had fallen off during the war and continued to fall afterwards, as road transport proved competitive over the short distances on the island.

==Grouping==
The Railways Act 1921 directed that the main line railways of Great Britain were to be &quot;grouped&quot; into four large companies; the new Southern Railway was to be created, and the London Brighton and South Coast Railway and the London and South Western Railway were to be constituents of it. The Isle of Wight lines were to be absorbed into it. Negotiations began over the terms so far as the IoWR was concerned; they were led by Sir Herbert Walker, General Manager of the LSWR. The IoWR claimed that it would be able to make significant savings in operating costs in the larger group. However it was obvious that radical economies would be necessary, and the IoWR lacked any reserve fund to pay for renewals. In fact the Isle of Wight Railway, in common with some other small lines, was absorbed by the LSWR on 31 December 1922, immediately before the LSWR was itself taken into the SR on the following day. Finally a settlement was agreed in which shareholders would receive Southern Railway dividends at the same rate as they received from the IoWR in 1921. The Directors were voted £3,600 out of IoWR funds as compensation for loss of office.

The Isle of Wight increased in popularity for holidaymakers and the Portsmouth to Ryde ferry route, owned by the Southern Railway, was the main route to the island. The traffic was highly seasonal; in 1929 two million people used the ferry annually. There were 26 trains per day on the line on the busiest summer days in 1929, and this was increased to three per hour in 1930. By 1936 this was again enhanced to 38 trains running throughout, as well as nine between Ryde and Sandown or Shanklin.

The Southern Railway inherited a disparate fleet of eighteen locomotives and rolling stock from the five companies on the island. Early in 1923 two Adams O2 class 0-4-4T locomotives were sent to Eastleigh Works and fitted with Westinghouse brake, and then sent to the Island for working on the Ryde - Ventnor line, for which they were found very suitable. Two more followed the next year. Many of the island passenger coaches were obsolescent; some did not have electric lighting and none had heating. Over the next years 10 to 12 coaches annually were transferred to the Island from the mainland, having been converted to Westinghouse brake operation. On the Ventnor line former London, Chatham and Dover Railway six-wheel coaches were converted to four-wheelers for easier running on the Island&#x27;s curved track and made up into close coupled four-coach sets.

The Southern Railway implemented a number of improvements to the line as well; the section between Brading and Shanklin was doubled; this was brought into use on 23 June 1927.

The two single lines of the old IoWR and the IoWCR, ran side by side to Smallbrook, where they diverged. The Southern Railway provided junction points at the point of divergence, which became Smallbrook Junction, and double line working applied from Ryde to that point. In the quieter winter months the signalbox was closed and the signals removed, and the two lines reverted to single line operation. The new junction was commissioned in 1926. It was claimed in 1935 that Smallbrook Junction was the busiest single line junction in the country with 12 trains per hour in summer.

Wroxall station was provided with a second platform and passing loop in 1925.

In the late 1920s passenger carryings in the summer increased strongly, and a 20-minute service was planned for the Ventnor line on summer Saturdays; two more O2 locomotives were brought to the Island as well as a further A1X and several ex-LCDR coaches. With some coach conversions this enabled the discontinuation of the use of non-bogie passenger vehicles on the Island.

It was discovered that some of the piles on Ryde Pier required replacement and the Southern Railway took the opportunity to construct a fourth platform there as part of the work, ready for the 1933 season. Meanwhile, the electric traction system used on the pier tramway was discontinued in 1927, and 2 petrol-driven tram units built by Drewry Car Co. The former electric unit trailers were retained and the trams operated as two-car units. The petrol engines were replaced by diesels in 1959 - 1960.

To allow the O2 locomotives to stay in service throughout the day at busy times, a bigger coal bunker was fitted in 1933, doubling the capacity to three tons.

==From 1948==
At the beginning of 1948 the railways of Great Britain passed into nationalised ownership under British Railways. The holiday traffic soon resumed its buoyant volumes after World War II, but the railway carryings were far surpassed by the use of buses (3 million and 17 million respectively in 1951).
The Bembridge branch was lightly patronised and was closed on 21 September 1953. The harbour at Bembridge (Brading Harbour) was of course still extant, and a toll road across the harbour mouth continued to be operated by British Railways. The harbour, by then renamed to Bembridge Harbour, was transferred from British Rail to the Bembridge Harbour Improvements Company by the (c. xxiii).

The Isle of Wight Central Railway had taken over the Ryde and Newport Railway and the Isle of Wight (Newport Junction) Railway in 1887, and it too had been absorbed into the Southern Railway in 1923 and now British Railways. On 6 February 1956 the IoWCR line from Sandown to Newport closed.

==The Beeching plan==

The railways of Great Britain were incurring large and increasing financial losses in the late 1950s and government became concerned about the impact on the economy. In 1963 a report was published, &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot;, recommending radical changes. The report has become known as &quot;The Beeching Report&quot;, after the Chairman of British Railways at the time, Dr Richard Beeching.

Many rural branch lines considered to be loss-making were to be closed, in hand with a major reduction in unremunerative wagonload goods traffic and many other changes. In March 1964, BR announced that all of the lines on the Isle of Wight were planned to be closed, but vigorous local protest secured the retention of the Ryde to Shanklin section of the former Isle of Wight Railway, despite controversy that the TUCC inquiry stated that closing the Ryde to Ventnor line would cause severe hardship but British Rail then suddenly proposed curtailing the line at Shanklin, which was accepted by the Minister of Transport, Barbara Castle

The southern extremity, from Shanklin to Ventnor, closed on 18 April 1966. Much of the trackbed survives but it has been severed at the Shanklin end and Ventnor station has become an industrial estate.

The former IoWCR line from Smallbrook Junction to Newport closed on 21 February 1966, although goods trains continued to run as required for a while.

On 17 September 1966 regular steam train operation at Ryde Pier Head ceased, the service being temporarily cut back to Esplanade.

==Electrification==
Up to this time the island&#x27;s train services were exclusively steam operated, and thought had been given to how the short residue of the island network would be run. The line was closed between 1 January and 19 March 1967 for completion of third-rail electrification and raising of the track at stations so that platform step heights conformed to the tube stock.

The third rail electrification was at 630V DC, and power was taken from the 33kV public supply through three new 33kV/630V DC substations, located at Ryde St John&#x27;s, Roxborough, and Sandown. Because of the low headroom in the Ryde tunnel, no British Railways electric train stock was suitable, and 43 second hand tube cars were purchased from London Transport. Goods traffic would not be conveyed. 19 of the UCC and MCCW cars dated from 1927 to 1934, 14 Cammell-Laird cars were from 1927 and 10 MCWF cars were from 1925. All were from the Piccadilly and Northern lines, although some had run on the Northern City Line. They were altered to have running rail traction current return instead of fourth rail. They were made up into four-car sets (Motor – trailer – trailer – motor) and three-car sets (control trailer – trailer – motor).

The basic train service was half-hourly, but the peak service was five trains an hour. This frequency was sufficient to handle the pier tramway system&#x27;s traffic, and that was discontinued from January 1969.

Mitchell and Smith remark that at Brading, &quot;the 13 elegant swan-neck gas lamps survive in 1985, controlled by automatic time clocks as the station is no longer staffed. We believe that Ilkley is the only other station on BR to have platforms gas lit.&quot;

A new station called Lake was opened in 1987.

==Surviving original rolling stock== 
Seven original IoWR carriage bodies have survived: 4w 4-comp second no. 5-8, built 1864, (not completely known) is preserved on the Isle of Wight Steam Railway and is currently inside their exhibition shed, awaiting restoration, 4w 3-comp composite no. 10, built 1864, has returned to operational condition on the Isle of Wight Steam Railway in 2017 as part of Channel 4&#x27;s &#x27;Great Rail Restorations with Peter Snow&#x27;, 4w 3-comp first no. 21, built 1864, is awaiting restoration on the Isle of Wight Steam Railway, 4w second no. 35 built in 1875 is awaiting restoration on the Isle of Wight Steam Railway, 4w composite no. 38, built 1882, is awaiting restoration on the Isle of Wight Steam Railway in their exhibition shed and 4w 4-comp second no. 39, built 1882, is also awaiting restoration on the Isle of Wight Steam Railway. These carriages are considered to be of the greatest significance for the IoWSR&#x27;s collection, along with other carriages that previously ran on the original Isle of Wight Railway.

Three goods vans, nos. 57, 86 and 87 on the Isle of Wight Steam Railway. It is also planned that these will be restored. No. 57 is currently inside the IoWSR&#x27;s exhibition shed.

Many carriages that also ran on the Isle of Wight Railway that were purchased from previous railways also survive on the Isle of Wight Steam Railway; multiple LCDR &amp; LB&amp;SCR, SECR, one MSJAR, etc. Many of these have been returned to service on PMVY underframes.

The body of one of the Isle of Wight Railway&#x27;s carriages is in use on the island as of January 2017. It was acquired from the North London Railway in December 1897 although it did not arrive until the following year. It is numbered 6336, and runs on the converted underframe of a parcels van.

==Present day==

Passenger services on the line between Ryde Pier Head and Shanklin are operated as the Island Line, by South Western Railway.

==Future==
On 23 May 2020, the Department of Transport announced that approval had been given to investigate the possible reinstatement of some or all of the tracks between Shanklin and Ventnor and Ryde and Newport. It was one of ten schemes across UK approved for more study under an &quot;Ideas Fund&quot;.

==Heritage railway==
In 1991 a new station was opened at Smallbrook Junction. It provides a connection with the Isle of Wight Steam Railway, a heritage railway operating part of the former IoWCR between Smallbrook Junction and Wootton.

<text>Xavier High School is an American independent university-preparatory high school for boys run by the USA East Province of the Society of Jesus, in the Chelsea neighborhood of the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York.

Named for St. Francis Xavier (1506–1552), it was founded by John Larkin in 1847 as the College of St. Francis Xavier and also known as St. Francis Xavier College.

== History ==
The school was founded in 1847 by John Larkin, a professor at St. John&#x27;s College in Rosehill Manor, then in Westchester County, now a part of the Borough of the Bronx, and which later became Fordham University. It taught boys from the age of eight to twenty-one. The Regents of the University of the State of New York chartered Xavier in 1861.

A military-training unit began at the school in 1886 under the direction of the National Guard, and membership became mandatory in 1892. Five years later, collegiate and secondary studies were separated into different departments, and the college-level department was closed in 1912. The student regiment became a Junior ROTC unit in 1935, and the school was declared a military institute in 1968, offering four years of military science and training which would be recognized upon enrollment in any branch of the United States military. Participation in military studies was declared optional in 1971.

The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools since 1927.

In 2008, Xavier High School announced that then President Daniel James Gatti would be retiring. Gatti&#x27;s retirement was pushed back until the end of the 2009 school year. He was succeeded by Hoboken School Superintendent, Jack Raslowsky, the school&#x27;s 33rd president and the first time in history that the position would be held by a lay person. Upon ascending to the role, Raslowsky oversaw a development operation that leading to a significant physical expansion of the Xavier High School campus.

In March 2021, Xavier High School announced that following a nationwide search, Kim Smith, vice president of Boston College High School, was chosen to take over as headmaster starting July 1. Smith, who would be replacing Headmaster Michael LiVigni, was to become the first female headmaster in the over 170-year history of the school.

==Demographics==
As of 2021–22, the school had an enrollment of 1,063 students and 95 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11:1.

The school&#x27;s student body was 70.3% White, 3.9% Black, 12.0% Hispanic, 3.7% Asian, and 10.1% two or more races.

== Academics ==

The school offers courses under the categories of religion, English, history, modern and classical languages, mathematics, science, fine arts, computer science and technology, military science, health and physical education, and a guidance department program.

Xavier&#x27;s courses prepare students to embrace the five goals of the Profile of a Graduate of a Jesuit School at Graduation (the &quot;Grad at Grad&quot;). These goals—being open to growth, intellectually competent, religious, loving, and committed to doing justice—are the foundation of Xavier&#x27;s curriculum and prepare students to live a life of competence, conscience, and compassion.

== Athletics ==

Xavier, a Catholic High School Athletic Association (CHSAA) member, houses teams including baseball, basketball, bowling, cross-country, football, fencing, golf, hockey, indoor/outdoor track and field, rugby, soccer, lacrosse, swimming and diving, tennis, volleyball, and wrestling. Other extracurricular activities include boxing club, choir, speech and debate, chess team, anime, film, science fiction, and skiing /snowboard clubs, school newspaper, &quot;The Review&quot;, drama productions, UNICEF Club, and the Blue Knight Jazz Band. The Blue Knight Band won best trombone section at the 2010 Villanova University Big Band Festival.

Xavier&#x27;s current mascot is a knight, and all of its athletic teams are referred to as the Knights. However, for many years, the teams were called the Cadets, a reflection of Xavier&#x27;s military program, while a terrier was used as a mascot. After a variety of replacements, including the 1980s Bruins, the nickname of the Knights was decided upon in the early 1990s and has been official since.

=== Football ===
The Xavier Football program began in the late 19th century. It has a continued rivalry with the Bronx&#x27;s Fordham Preparatory School. The two schools compete in an annual &quot;Turkey Bowl&quot;, the oldest high school football rivalry in New York City. Their very first game against one another took place in the late 19th century when the game was called off due to darkness, ending in a tie. Many of these football matches were played at Manhattan&#x27;s famed Polo Grounds, until its demolition.

=== Rugby ===
Rugby is a popular sport at Xavier. Rugby has varsity status, and fields four teams with over 125 players. Xavier has fielded one of the top rugby teams in the United States since the club&#x27;s founding in 1976.

=== Track ===
The Freshman Track and Field team won the indoor and outdoor 2009 CHSAA Intersectional Championships, the first time in team history. In 2010, the team defended their outdoor victory as sophomores. The Track and Field team competed in the Nationals track meet in Greensboro, North Carolina and finished fifth in both the 4 by 100 and 4 by 200 meter relay, earning Emerging Elite Metals. 

=== Other sports ===
In 1859 the College of St. Francis Xavier and St. John&#x27;s College (now Fordham University) played the first collegiate level baseball game, featuring the new nine-man team style of play. Fordham won the game 33–11.

Xavier High School&#x27;s JV Soccer team won the CHSAA Intersectional Championship in 2008 and 2009.

==Buildings==
In 2016, the school acquired space inside a 25-story building, 35 West 15th Street, to house Fernandez-Duminuco Hall, occupying of space in the basement and six floors. The other floors house condominiums, and both the school campus and the condominiums have separate entrances.

The building has allowed for the expansion of the arts at Xavier. The expansion includes a new band room, music practice rooms, small ensemble room, recording studio, theater, and STEAM classroom, which houses an expanded computer science and technology department, and a student activities space.

<text>The debye ( , ; symbol: D) is a CGS unit (a non-SI metric unit) of electric dipole moment named in honour of the physicist Peter J. W. Debye. It is defined as statcoulomb-centimetres. Historically the debye was defined as the dipole moment resulting from two charges of opposite sign but an equal magnitude of 10−10 statcoulomb (generally called e.s.u. (electrostatic unit) in older scientific literature), which were separated by 1 ångström. This gave a convenient unit for molecular dipole moments.

Typical dipole moments for simple diatomic molecules are in the range of 0 to 11 D. Molecules with symmetry point groups or containing inversion symmetry will not have a permanent dipole moment, while highly ionic molecular species have a very large dipole moment, e.g. gas-phase potassium bromide, KBr, with a dipole moment of 10.41 D. A proton and an electron 1 Å apart have a dipole moment of 4.8 D.

The debye is still used in atomic physics and chemistry because SI units have until recently been inconveniently large. The smallest SI unit of electric dipole moment is the quectocoulomb-metre, which corresponds closely to 0.3 D.

<text>The Guam national football team represents Guam, an overseas territory of the United States, in international football and is controlled by the Guam Football Association. They are affiliated with the Asian Football Confederation&#x27;s East Asian Football Federation region.

Guam reached its highest ever position in the FIFA World Ranking at 146th in 2015 after victories over Turkmenistan and India. Guam&#x27;s first FIFA World Cup qualification match was played against Iran national football team at Tabriz.

==History==

=== Beginnings (1960s–1990s) ===

Football in Guam began in the 1960s, on the initiative of two pioneers: an Irish priest, Tony Gillespie, and an owner of a construction company, Charles Whang, who settled in Guam and created the Guam Soccer Cup before becoming the first president of the Guam Football Association in 1975.

Guam played its first international match at the 1975 Pacific Games against Solomon Islands, losing 5–1. This result was followed by an 11–0 loss to Fiji, eliminating them from the competition. In the 1979 Games, Guam again lost twice to New Caledonia 11–1 and New Hebrides 5–0. Progressing to the Consolation Tournament, Guam registered their first victories, beating Western Samoa 4–2, and Tuvalu 7–2 before losing again to New Hebrides, 5–1.

=== AFC and FIFA Member (1991–2011) ===
Despite being considered part of Oceania, and having never faced an Asian team to that point, Guam became an associate member of the AFC in 1991 but continued to participate in the Pacific Games. In 1996, Guam became both a full member of the AFC and of FIFA.

As a full member of the AFC and FIFA, Guam played its first matches against Asian teams as part of the 1996 AFC Asian Cup qualification losing all three matches against South Korea (9–0), Vietnam (9–0), and Chinese Taipei (9–2).

In 1998, Guam played in the Micronesian Games, though the tournament was a 9-a-side competition with 80 minute matches. Guam finished top of the group stage but lost 3–0 to Northern Mariana Islands in the final. Guam entered the 2000 Asian Cup qualification but finished last in their group again, losing to Vietnam (11–0), China (19–0), and Philippines (2–0).

Guam became one of the founding members of the East Asian Football Federation in 2002 and participated in the qualifiers for the inaugural 2003 East Asian Football Championship, finishing last again without registering a goal. The same is true for the 2004 AFC Asian Cup qualification, beaten by Bhutan and Mongolia. For the 2006 World Cup qualifiers, Guam entered and was scheduled to face Nepal in the first round but both Nepal and Guam withdrew for financial reasons before their first match.

In the 2005 East Asian Football Championship qualifiers, Guam lost all four matches heavily, against Chinese Taipei (9–0), Hong Kong (15–0), Mongolia (4–1), and North Korea (21–0). Following these defeats, Guam entered the 2006 AFC Challenge Cup, a competition designed for &quot;emerging nations&quot; to help develop their football. Guam again lost all three matches to Palestine (11–0), Bangladesh (3–0), and Cambodia (3–0).

Guam advanced to the second stage of qualifying in the 2008 East Asian Football Championship by beating Northern Marianas 12–2 over two legs but they were eliminated in the next round by Chinese Taipei (10–0), and Hong Kong (15–1). In the 2010 East Asian Football Championship qualifiers, Guam managed to get its first victory over a FIFA member, beating Mongolia 1–0. They would go on to top the group before being eliminated at the next stage. Guam returned to the 2011 Pacific Games after a sixteen-year absence, but only managed to beat American Samoa 2–0, finishing second last and failing to advance to the knock-out stages.

=== Building the football structure (2012–present) ===

Gary White became Guam&#x27;s manager in 2012 and called-up players of Guamanian origin based in the United States like Ryan Guy and A. J. DeLaGarza to improve the level of his team. In the 2013 EAFF East Asian Cup, &quot;Matao&quot; managed to advance past the first round by beating Northern Marianas (3–1) and Macao (3–0). Guam then participated in the 2012 Philippine Peace Cup, replacing Hong Kong, losing against Philippines (1–0) and Chinese Taipei (2–0) but beat Macao (3–0) in its final group game to finish third. Guam advanced to the second qualifying stage of both the 2015 and 2017 EAFF Championship finishing third and fourth respectively and failing to advance the final competition.
In 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification, Guam beat Turkmenistan (1–0) and India (2–1), finishing fourth in their group and qualifying for the 2019 Asian Cup third round qualifiers, although Guam withdrew before the draw took place. Guam then failed to progress past the first qualifying round for the 2019 EAFF Championship.

During the 2022 World Cup qualifiers, Guam beat Bhutan 5–1 over two legs but lost all eight of their second round matches and finished bottom of their group, scoring two goals and conceding 32.

After nearly not playing an international match for a year, Guam participated in the first round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification against Singapore, where they would ultimately lose 3–1 on aggregate.

==Nickname==
Until 2011, the nickname of the Guamanian selection was &quot;Chamorros&quot;, in reference to the local population of Guam. When Gary White took charge of Guam, the team has changed their nickname to &quot;Matao&quot;, referring to highest social class in ancient Chamorro society in the Chamorro language. White also promoted the use of the Guam pledge before each match of the selection, referred to as the &quot;Inifresi&quot;.

<text>The Nuxalk Nation is the band government of the Nuxalk people of Bella Coola, British Columbia. It is a member of the Wuikinuxv-Kitasoo-Nuxalk Tribal Council, and until March 2008 was a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Nuxalk&quot; is singular; &quot;Nuxalkmc&quot; is plural.

== Community ==
Q&#x27;umk&#x27;uts&#x27;, a Nuxalk community that is located at the confluence of the Bella Coola River and the Pacific Ocean is currently home to the majority of the Nuxalk population, is located in the Bella Coola Valley, in British Columbia. It is on the Nation&#x27;s primary reserve (which is much smaller than the Nation&#x27;s traditional territory), adjacent to the Bella Coola &quot;townsite&quot;, the Central business district for the Valley. Nuxalk Hall is a community center, where potlatches and social events are held. The Nuxalk Basketball Association hosts games in the hall.

The Nuxalkmc were wrongfully categorized as Coast Salish. Today the Nuxalkmc are classified under their own distinct category.

== Language ==
The Nuxalk Nation traditionally has spoken the Nuxalk language. Today there are an estimated 5 fluent speakers, 80 conversational speakers, and 140 learning speakers. Nuxalk-language radio programming and work towards an expanded Nuxalk-English dictionary and a new online phrasebook started in 2014.

== History ==
Located at the mouth of the Bella Coola River, the nation was only accessible by foot, air, or boat until 1953, when a road was constructed. Nuxalk people have lived in the region for millennia. Norwegian people settled in the area in the 1890s. It is estimated the population of the Nuxalkmc people were in the thousands amongst different villages. Stories suggest there were approximately ten thousand to thirty thousand spanning the whole Bella Coola Valley and surrounding inlets.

In February 2023, a Nuxalk Nation totem pole was returned to the nation by the Royal British Columbia Museum. The totem pole was stolen from the nation in 1913 and sold to the museum for $45.

== Ethnobotany ==
The Nuxalk apply a poultice of pounded roots of &quot;Ranunculus acris&quot; to boils. They take a decoction of &quot;Antennaria howellii&quot; leaves for body pain, but not pain in the limbs.

A full list of their ethnobotany can be found at http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/21/ (387 documented plant uses).

<text>My Life Story are an English pop group formed in London, England, in 1984. The group&#x27;s success peaked in the mid to late 1990s as part of the Britpop era. Fronted by singer/songwriter Jake Shillingford, the group inherited their name from an earlier group in which Shillingford had appeared. A cross between a pop group and a chamber orchestra, the band&#x27;s sound was heavily oriented toward orchestral instruments.

My Life Story&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;World Citizen&quot; was released in September 2019.

In 2020 Shillingford and co-writer Nick Evans were signed to Mute Song in a worldwide publishing deal which included rights to World Citizen as well as much of the band&#x27;s back catalogue from the Britpop era, formerly held by Universal Music Publishing.

==History==
At the time of their debut single, &quot;Girl A, Girl B, Boy C&quot; (1993) produced by Giles Martin, son of George, the group had a regular line-up of twelve members. Though the membership fluctuated continually, it rarely dipped into single figures until 1999, when their third album credited just four regular members, though most of the former line-up were still used as session musicians. Their orchestral sound led them to be compared to groups such as Tindersticks and especially The Divine Comedy. Their debut album, &quot;Mornington Crescent&quot; was released on 10 January 1995. My Life Story enjoyed the most success at the time of their second album &quot;The Golden Mile&quot;, which was released on 10 March 1997. It spawned five singles that entered the lower half of the UK Top 40, but the group finally disbanded after a series of farewell concerts in December 2000.

On 26 May 2006 the band reformed with the full line-up of thirteen members, to play at the Mean Fiddler (LA2) on Charing Cross Road in London, in support of their forthcoming Best Of album. The gig got a review rating of 10/10 from Planet Sound. A second reunion show took place at the Astoria in London on 8 December 2006. Further reunions have taken place every two years on 13 December 2007 at the O2 Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire, and Koko on 26 November 2009, where the band performed their debut album, &quot;Mornington Crescent&quot;, for the first time in its entirety. In 2009, it was announced that, to mark 15 years since their debut album, the group would reform and perform the album in full, together with later songs. This concert took place at KOKO which is next door to Mornington Crescent tube station.

My Life Story announced that they were to reunite again to perform &quot;The Golden Mile&quot; at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire on 3 March 2012 to celebrate fifteen years since the album&#x27;s release.

In mid-2013 the group announced their first UK tour in 14 years. Singer Jake Shillingford is reported to have said: &quot;For many years we have only been able to play a big London show due to the sheer size and scale of the band. Now I am able to take my songs out on the road with a stripped down tight rocking outfit.

&quot;I will be joined by various members of My Life Story along my journey around the UK, culminating in our traditional annual London concert with the original bunch, I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing everyone again, expect a big, bold and brash performance, all foxy horns and horny foxes.&quot;

In September 2016 My Life Story released their first single in 16 years, &quot;24 Hour Deflowerer&quot;. The launch was marked with a two-night residency at The Borderline in London on 14–15 October, with all audience members receiving a numbered limited edition 7&quot; vinyl of the single.

My Life Story performed in the Star Shaped Festival, a Britpop revival tour, alongside The Bluetones, Space, Dodgy and Salad, in July/August 2017 and again in August/September 2018 together with Echobelly, Black Grape and The Supernaturals. The band&#x27;s current five-piece line-up features Jake Shillingford (vocals), Nick Evans (guitar), Chris Hardwick (drums), Jack Hosgood (bass) and Aimee Smith (keys).

The fourth My Life Story studio album, &quot;World Citizen,&quot; was crowd-funded with pre-orders from fans and was released on 6 September 2019. Described as &quot;the best My Life Story album ever&quot;, &quot;World Citizen&quot; received review scores of 4/5 in The Express, 85% in Hi Fi News and 7/10 in Uncut.

The band released their fifth Studio album, &quot;Loving You is Killing Me&quot; in February 2024.

==Other projects==
The spirit of the band lived on in Shillingford&#x27;s next project, ExileInside, which drew its influences from 1980s electronica, replacing the lush orchestral sounds of My Life Story with a quirky retro synth based sound. Former band members Aaron Cahill and Mal Campbell appear in the line-up, and the material is engineered by George Shilling. Shilling also produced many My Life Story tracks, including most of the &quot;Golden Mile&quot; album. ExileInside was created in 2002 thanks to a fan-funded investor model.

Shillingford released an acoustic solo album in 2009 called &quot;Written Large&quot;, which featured two new tracks, plus acoustic versions of My Life Story and ExileInside songs.

In 2014 Shillingford formed the production music company Choppersaurus along with writing partner and multi-instrumentalist Nick Evans. Debut single &quot;Motel 66&quot; was released on 27 January 2017, from the album &quot;Herx&quot;. Tracks &quot;Motel 66&quot; and &quot;Did You Come Alone?&quot; from the album appear in the first series of &quot;The Grand Tour&quot;. The duo has also composed a trailer for &quot;Homeland&quot; Series 5 (&quot;Dystopia&quot;) and has written toplines for &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; and &quot;Live on Dreams&quot; by house DJ Mason. Two Choppersaurus tracks were nominated in the UK Music Production Awards 2016 – &quot;Trouble in the Delta&quot; for Best Rock Production Music Track and &quot;In Limbo&quot; for Best Trailer Production Music Track. Choppersaurus won Best Electronic Production Music Track in the 2018 UK Production Music Awards for &quot;Blast Radius&quot; and in the same year composed the score for US comedy horror movie &quot;Blood Fest.&quot;

In 2019 Choppersaurus track &quot;Treasure&quot;, used in a Ponds For Men TV advertisement, won Best Use of Production Music in Online, Viral &amp; Ambient Advertising (Ponds For Men advert) in the &quot;Music &amp; Sound Awards 2019&quot;. In 2020 &quot;Get On Your Feet&quot; featured in the end credits of hit Netflix original movie &quot;Dangerous Lies&quot;.

Shillingford has also presented an electronica music show on the Essex based community radio station Phoenix FM.

Dan Turner the band&#x27;s keyboard player went on to form the band MacArthur with singer Dom Chapman after the group split in 2000. He landed a recording contract with Artist Network and recorded the Northern Soul influenced album &quot;MacArthur&quot; working with musicians such as Gary &quot;Mudbone&quot; Cooper (Funkadelic) and Chris Sharrock (The La&#x27;s, World Party, Robbie Williams, Oasis). As the band were about to release their first single the record company went bankrupt. The music has now been taken on by Fairwood Music.

Original drummer Jason Cooper went on to greater notice as a member of The Cure. He has also collaborated on film and television soundtracks with another former MLS member, cellist Oliver Kraus.
