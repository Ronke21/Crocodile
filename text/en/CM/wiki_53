<text>In professional wrestling, a manager is a supporting character paired with a wrestler (or wrestlers) for a variety of reasons. A woman accompanying, or &quot;seconding&quot;, a male wrestler to a match is sometimes referred to as a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#valet|valet]].

Performers who assume this role may be non-wrestlers, occasional wrestlers, older wrestlers who have retired or are nearing retirement, the tag team partner of the wrestler they are managing, or new wrestlers who are breaking into the business (or a specific company) and need experience in front of the crowds. The wrestler who is paired with a manager may be referred to as their charge, client, or ward. A professional wrestling manager&#x27;s portrayal as a wrestler&#x27;s decision-maker is usually fictional and has nothing to do with a wrestler or promotion&#x27;s real-world counterpart or road agent.

== Role ==

Managers are akin to storyline agents for an actor or an athlete; they help their client to book matches and appearances, and otherwise work to further and guide their career. Within the context of storylines, the manager positions their client for title opportunities, generally acts as a mouthpiece on their behalf, decides whom to trust as an ally, or serves as an exposed Achilles&#x27; heel to be exploited by their client&#x27;s opponents. Managers could be utilized by a promotion&#x27;s booker to instigate and strengthen storylines; their involvement could form the center of a controversy, for instance if they double-cross their clients or inadvertently cause the loss or forfeiture of their clients&#x27; championship titles.

Outside of storylines, a manager&#x27;s job is to help the wrestler they are paired with get over. The manager would cut promos on behalf of clients who may not be as charismatic (or had gimmicks depicting them as silent, or with limited ability to speak English). As such, successful managers almost invariably had the &quot;gift of the gab&quot;, though it was not unheard of to see managers paired with wrestlers who had no trouble cutting their own promos. A notable example of this would be CM Punk, who was managed by Paul Heyman from 2012 to 2013. Punk had no trouble cutting his own promos, but Heyman would also cut his own promos alongside Punk in support of his client&#x27;s act.
While the basic goal of a manager to give their wrestlers a push does not change, the tactics depend on several factors, especially alignment. Managers, when used judiciously, can completely change the tone and inner workings of a wrestling match. A heel manager, for example, may instruct their clients to constantly duck tougher opponents or interfere in their matches to secure a win by cheating. A face manager, on the other hand, may spend the majority of their interview time talking about how tough their client is and going out of their way to find bigger and better opponents to challenge, or rally the audience to chant and cheer in support of their client during matches. Often the very act of aligning with a manager, or conversely breaking away from a manager they&#x27;ve worked with, can change a wrestler&#x27;s alignment, making them a sudden fan favourite face or a heel.

Certain wrestlers employ a specific kind of manager known as a &quot;handler&quot;. If a wrestler&#x27;s character calls for it, a handler is the only person who can manage the behavior of a &quot;wild&quot; wrestler who is prone to &quot;go out of control&quot;. A classic example of this was The Undertaker, who in his early Deadman persona could only be controlled by Paul Bearer, through an urn which was said to have all of the Undertaker&#x27;s powers. A legitimate example is Arnold Skaaland, who not only managed Andre The Giant for a time but was once assigned by promoter Vince McMahon Sr. as his real life handler. Skaaland was responsible for keeping Andre, known for his alcoholism, out of serious trouble and to ensure that he would reach a venue in time to wrestle a scheduled match.
A few managers, like Paul Ellering, are legitimate managers in the truest sense of the word, taking care of the day-to-day needs of their clients by dealing with travel arrangements, rentals, lodgings and even contractual negotiations. Others, such as Jim Cornette or Gary Hart, participate as real-life bookers and/or road agents for their promotions behind the scenes while performing concurrently as managers.

== History ==
In the early years of pro wrestling, the vast majority of professional wrestling managers were men, and female managers were rare. A number of prominent women like Miss Elizabeth, Sherri Martel and Woman made their debuts during the 1980s professional wrestling boom and went on to have storied careers in several wrestling promotions as wrestling managers.

Up until the mid-1990s, managers were very common because they served a secondary purpose: &quot;getting heat&quot;. During the territorial era, most managers did not travel from territory to territory, but instead remained in one territory to provide instant heat to the promotion&#x27;s new heel acts. Notable examples include &quot;The Mouth of The South&quot; Jimmy Hart in Memphis, Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan in the American Wrestling Association, Sunny and the &quot;Three Wise Men&quot; (Lou Albano, Freddie Blassie, and The Grand Wizard) in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (now the WWE).
By the 2000s, major promotions like the WWE have favoured elevating the careers of wrestlers who are able to speak for themselves. As a result, the previously ubiquitous role of a manager has declined in favor of either female valets who occasionally get involved in wrestling matches, or by people who hold on-screen power as General Managers, Commissioners or various corporate officer positions. However, contemporary wrestling personalities such as Paul Heyman and Vickie Guerrero have demonstrated that managers are still effective at drawing heat, and when used judiciously, are capable of changing the tone and inner workings of a wrestling match by contributing drama and tension.

== Nomenclature ==

Although &quot;manager&quot; and &quot;valet&quot; are terms sometimes used interchangeably for a woman who accompanies a wrestler to the ring, a major point of difference is that the former is specifically depicted as a professional spokesperson who crafts and/or guides a wrestler&#x27;s career, while the latter may serve as little more than eye candy and/or as a distraction to opposing wrestlers or referees.
The role of a valet is a significant part of professional wrestling history, at least within the context of North American industry. Historically, North American women wrestlers often received less attention or recognition compared to their male counterparts and often did not enjoy the same exposure compared to their Japanese or Mexican counterparts. As a result, the purpose of a valet role is to provide female talent more opportunities as well as visibility within the industry. It is thought that a valet, by virtue of her presence and/or the dynamics of her relationship with her associated wrestler, could contribute an element that amplifies their personas and get their act over. Many valets are not required to cut promos on their associated wrestler&#x27;s behalf and generally have rather passive roles, since their physical appearance tend to be emphasized at the exclusion of all other traits; other valets may deviate from convention and assert a dominant role over their wrestlers, if their characters call for it.

In spite of their limited wrestling ability, perceived or otherwise, valets are more likely to participate in the occasional wrestling match in comparison to managers, and are frequently booked in mixed tag team matches against rival valets and their associated wrestlers as part of storyline angles. There are also numerous examples of female performers in the wrestling industry who started off as valets and went on to be recognized as marquee competitors in their own right, such as Lita, Trish Stratus, and The Fabulous Moolah.

Male supporting characters who fit the original definition of a valet are uncommon in professional wrestling; a recent example was Ricardo Rodriguez, who performed as Alberto Del Rio&#x27;s on-screen attendant and personal ring announcer during his tenure in the WWE. A male performer who accompanies a prominent female wrestler to the ring could be considered a valet as well, though this is exceptionally rare.
While they are not managers in the traditional sense, enforcers—full-time wrestlers who accompany another wrestler to the ring—also serve both in and out of storylines to further the interests of a wrestler in their care. They are named after Arn Anderson&#x27;s nickname, The Enforcer, whose career has been highlighted by his association with Ric Flair and various members of The Four Horsemen stable. Enforcers appear in storylines where wrestlers need to have their back watched by keeping outside interference from taking place in a match, to serve as outside interference themselves, or to further a storyline without actually recording a real match by defending their associates from ambushes outside the ring by other wrestlers. The Acolytes Protection Agency (APA) had a unique gimmick where instead of a long-term association with one wrestler, tag team or stable, they would be hired by different wrestlers each week to act as their bodyguards or to prevent outside interference.

<doc id="1211200" wikidata="Q753497" url="?curid=1211200" title="Exciter (Depeche Mode album)">
<text>Exciter is the tenth studio album by English electronic music band Depeche Mode. It was first released on 14 May 2001 in the United Kingdom by Mute Records and a day later in the United States by Reprise Records. The album was produced by Mark Bell, and was supported by the Exciter Tour, one of the band&#x27;s most successful tours.

&quot;Exciter&quot; debuted at number nine on the UK Albums Chart and number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 115,000 copies in its first week in the United States. It was the only Depeche Mode album to debut higher in the United States than in the United Kingdom. As of April 2006, &quot;Exciter&quot; had sold over 426,000 copies in the US, and has been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); it has also been certified gold in Canada for shipments of 50,000 units.

The plant that appears on the cover is the &quot;Agave attenuata&quot;, a species of agave sometimes known as the &quot;lion&#x27;s tail&quot;, &quot;swan&#x27;s neck&quot;, or &quot;foxtail&quot; for its development of a curved stem, unusual among agaves.

==Background and composition==
Lyrically, the album covers many different subjects. Martin Gore said that &quot;The Dead of Night&quot; was inspired by a club in London where there were a lot of drugs and mayhem. Gore told MTV Europe that &quot;I Feel Loved&quot; is about when you &quot;feel absolutely like shit, and you feel the worst you&#x27;ve ever felt in your life. Then somehow you think: &#x27;the universe must like me, for making me feel like this&#x27;&quot;.

Musically, &quot;Exciter&quot; can be described as a very atmospheric and electronic album. Gore had stated that he had been listening to more abstract electronic music in the lead up to recording &quot;Exciter&quot;, which could have influenced some of the more experimental soundscapes on the album. The group also often cited producer Mark Bell as a major inspiration in the making of &quot;Exciter&quot; as Gahan states that Mark Bell helped make him a more confident vocalist. The band also worked with Paul Freegard and long-time collaborator Gareth Jones, who were involved with pre-production and programming.

On top of the electronic soundscapes, Depeche Mode also added elements of traditional blues, retro funk, progressive rock, and orchestral pop to its arrangements. Bell told &quot;Keyboard&quot; magazine that they treated the acoustic and electronic sounds on the track &quot;Dream On&quot; the same. Gore felt that many songs of the album including &quot;When the Body Speaks&quot; have a 1950s or 1960s sound to them. &quot;Comatose&quot; was massively stripped down from the original demo since the band wanted a more minimalistic arrangement. &quot;Freelove&quot; was one of the final tracks to be completed on the album. &quot;The Dead of Night&quot; features a harsher sound compared to other tracks on the album, making heavy use of analogue synths such as the EMS Synthi AKS; the practice of largely using analogue synths would become common on later albums by the band. 

Bell found working with the group fun but strange, stating he had listened to the group when he was 12 and found the band asking him for days off or &quot;what they should eat&quot;. According to an interview with Gahan in 2003, Gore&#x27;s lack of involvement with the production led to Bell feeling frustrated and that he was essentially creating the album for the band.

== Tour ==

The tour began with a North American leg on 4 June 2001; the group performed one rehearsal show and two &quot;warm-up&quot; concerts before the official tour began in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in mid-June 2001. The leg continued until mid-August, concluding with two shows in Anaheim, California.

In late August 2001, the group began a European leg, which started in Tallinn and culminated in early November in Mannheim, Germany. This was the final show of the tour; a second European leg had been planned for the summer of 2002 but this never happened. In total, the band played 84 concerts, performing to over 1.5 million people in 24 countries.

The concerts in Paris were filmed and issued in May 2002 on a DVD release entitled &quot;One Night in Paris&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Exciter&quot; received generally positive reviews. While many critics praised the album&#x27;s experimental and digital soundscapes, many felt it was one of the weakest Depeche Mode albums. 

In a positive review, &quot;NME&quot; wrote that &quot;Not many long-running groups could make an album this fresh and confident in their 20th year, never mind one which bridges timeless soulman crooning and underground techno&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; complimented the album&#x27;s minimal arrangements, comparing them to early Kraftwerk. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; complimented Mark Bell&#x27;s production on the album, stating that &quot;Bell&#x27;s subtle, inventive knob-twiddling pairs perfectly with Martin Gore&#x27;s new batch of somber, subdued songs&quot;.

In contrast, &quot;Q Magazine&quot; was much more negative in their interpretation of the project, writing: &quot;This time it&#x27;s Martin Gore who&#x27;s out of puff. No amount of fashionable tweaking can hide the flimsiness of his offerings&quot;. 

Despite some mixed reviews, &quot;Exciter&quot; still appeared on several EOY 2001 lists such as &quot;Magic&quot;, &quot;MusikExpress&quot;, &quot;Rocksound&quot;, &quot;Rumba&quot;, &quot;Visions&quot;, and &quot;Woxy&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Re-release==
On 2 October 2007 (3 October in North America), &quot;Exciter&quot; was re-released as a two-disc set, along with &quot;Ultra&quot;, in the fourth and final set of Depeche Mode reissues. The first disc was a remastered version of the original, on an SACD/CD hybrid (only a CD in the US). The second disc is a DVD which features the album in DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 and PCM Stereo. The B-sides from &quot;Exciter&quot; as well as the single version of &quot;Freelove&quot; are included. There are also audio versions of all the live &quot;Exciter&quot; tracks played during the &quot;One Night in Paris&quot; film.

Like the other reissues, there is a documentary on the making of &quot;Exciter&quot; titled &quot;Depeche Mode 1999–2001 (Presenting the Intimate and Delicate Side of Depeche Mode)&quot;. The documentary begins with the talks of Gore&#x27;s writer&#x27;s block and what they did about it. It also discusses the first three singles, the recording, the cover art and the &quot;Exciter&quot; tour (including one of the opening acts, Fad Gadget). The documentary is around 30 minutes long. The three members of the band are interviewed along with Daniel Miller, Christian Eigner, Peter Gordeno, Anton Corbijn, and Mute label representatives. The documentary ends with a &quot;To Be Continued...&quot;

Producer Mark Bell does not appear, and although they discuss the fact that the band decided not to have Corbijn direct &quot;Exciter&quot;&#x27;s music videos, they do not interview the two who did direct them. However, John Hillcoat, who directed &quot;I Feel Loved&quot;, &quot;Freelove&quot; and &quot;Goodnight Lovers&quot;, is mentioned in passing.

<doc id="1211204" wikidata="Q7057753" url="?curid=1211204" title="Northcote, Auckland">
<text>Northcote ( or ) () is a suburb of Auckland in northern New Zealand. It is situated on the North Shore, on the northern shores of Waitematā Harbour, northwest of the Auckland City Centre. The suburb includes the peninsula of Northcote Point where the northern approaches to the Auckland Harbour Bridge are located, and Northcote Central, the commercial centre of Northcote. Northcote features two volcanic maars.

Northcote was settled by Tāmaki Māori in the 13th and 14th centuries, and was constructed as a headland pā to protect the wider communities. Europeans settled Northcote in the 1840s, and a community developed around the ferry terminal. Early industries included the brickworks, sulfur works and orchards, and by the 1880s Northcote beaches had become local attractions. By 1908, the area had grown enough that Northcote became a borough. After the Auckland Harbour Bridge opened in 1959, Northcote Central rapidly developed, while Northcote Point became isolated.

Northcote Borough was merged into the North Shore City in 1989, which in turn merged into the Auckland &quot;super city&quot; in 2010. In the late 2010s and 2020s, Northcote began an urban regeneration and housing intensification project.

==Etymology==

Northcote is named after British Conservative politician Stafford Northcote, 1st Earl of Iddesleigh, an idea put forward by resident Major Benton. The name that dates from 1880 when the post office and school committee decided to use the name. The first name used for the peninsula on European maps was Rough Point, named after Captain David Rough, first harbourmaster of Auckland, in 1841. In 1848 it was renamed Stokes Point, after Captain John Lort Stokes of the survey vessel HMS &quot;Acheron&quot;, who named the peninsula after himself due to another location named Rough Rock near Rangitoto Island. Stokes Point was the common name for the suburb until it was renamed in 1880. The name Stokes Point remains in use for the southern headland of the peninsula.

==Geology and natural history==

The North Shore is primarily uplifted Waitemata Group sandstone, that was deposited on the sea floor during the Early Miocene, between 22 and 16 million years ago. There are two volcanic craters found on the eastern coastline of the suburb: Tank Farm, also known as Tuff Crater or , joined to the south by Onepoto (also known as ). Onepoto and Tank Farm erupted an estimated 187,600 and 181,000 years ago respectively.

Prior to human settlement, the inland North Shore was a mixed podocarp-broadleaf forest dominated by kauri. Pōhutukawa trees dominated the coastal margins of Birkenhead. Smiths Bush in the Onewa Domain is a remnant native forest, dominated by kahikatea and taraire trees.

==Geography==

Northcote is composed of two suburban areas: Northcote (aka Northcote Central) to the north, and Northcote Point, the peninsula south of Onewa Road. The suburb is bound by Ocean View Road and Northcote Road in the northwest, the Auckland Northern Motorway in the northeast, and Shoal Bay in the east.

The highest point in the suburb is an hill to the west on Pupuke Road, referred informally by residents in the early 20th century as Clay Hill. The hill is the location of the Pupuke Road Reservoir and Pump Station. The southern headland of the Northcote Point peninsula is called Stokes Point.

Onepoto Stream flows east through the suburb from Birkenhead, entering Shoal Bay south of Onewa Road. Hillcrest Creek flows east through the north of Northcote, entering the Waitematā Harbour at Shoal Bay, east of the Auckland Northern Motorway. Until the 1970s, the upper reaches of the creek were primarily swampland. A traditional recorded name for Hillcrest Creek is &quot;The Drifting Canoe&quot;, a name which recalls an incident where a tapu waka drifted into the stream at high tide. A tributary of Hillcrest Stream, Awataha Stream, flowed through Northcote Central until the 1950s, when the stream was undergrounded. In 2019, work began to daylight the stream.

Two beaches were formerly located in Northcote along the western shores of Shoal Bay: the City of Cork Beach and Sulphur Beach. These locations were reclaimed in the 1950s, and are now located beneath the Auckland Northern Motorway.

Little Shoal Bay is found to the west of Northcote Point, which is the location of Halls Beach.

== History ==
===Māori history===
Māori settlement of the Auckland Region began around the 13th or 14th centuries. The &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory canoe visited Northcote, stopping at , a sacred tree on the cliffs south-east of Tank Farm. The North Shore was settled by Tāmaki Māori, including people descended from the &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory canoe and ancestors of figures such as Taikehu and Peretū, and many of the early Tāmaki Māori people of the North Shore identified as Ngā Oho. The Shoal Bay area was used to harvest shellfish, and the volcanic soil at Northcote allowed for kūmara cultivation.

The warrior Maki migrated from the Kāwhia Harbour to his ancestral home in the Auckland Region, likely sometime in the 17th century. Maki conquered and unified many the Tāmaki Māori tribes as Te Kawerau ā Maki, including those of the North Shore. After Maki&#x27;s death, his sons settled different areas of his lands, creating new hapū. His younger son Maraeariki settled the North Shore and Hibiscus Coast, who based himself at the head of the Ōrewa River. Maraeariki&#x27;s daughter Kahu succeeded him, and she is the namesake of the North Shore, (&quot;The Greater Lands of Kahu&quot;). Many of the iwi of the North Shore, including Ngāti Manuhiri, Ngāti Maraeariki, Ngāti Kahu, Ngāti Poataniwha, Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki and Ngāti Whātua, can trace their lineage to Kahu.

====Te Riri a Mataaho====

Northcote is part of the setting of (&quot;The Wrath of Mataaho&quot;), a Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki traditional story () that describes the creation of the two volcanic craters of Northcote, and , collectively called (&quot;The Two Deep Pools&quot;). Two tupua (children of the Fire God Mataaho), Matakamokamo and his wife Matakerepo, lived on Te Rua Maunga, a mountain located at Lake Pupuke. The couple argued over some flax clothing that Matakerepo had made for her husband, and the argument became so heated that the fire outside their dwelling died out. Matakamokamo cursed Mahuika, Goddess of the Fire, for allowing this to happen. Mahuika was furious at the couple, and asked Mataaho to punish them. Mataaho destroyed their mountain home, and in its place left Pupuke Moana (Lake Pupuke), while at the same time he formed the mountain Rangitoto. The couple fled to the newly formed island, where Mataaho formed three peaks on the mountain, so that the couple can view the ruins of their former home. Matakamokamo and Matakerepo later returned to the mainland, which led to Mataaho further punishing them. He turned the couple into stone and caused them to link beneath the earth, forming the two volcanic craters.

====Te Onewa Pā====

, also known as , is a defensive pā that was located at the Stokes Point headland. The name refers to the ditch that separated the pā from the mainland, and is also the name of a dark grey stone tool () used for digging trenches. The site has traditional importance to Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki, Te Kawerau ā Maki and Ngāti Paoa, and was located on the opposite shore to Point Erin, where a pā called or was located. Both pā sites were used as bases for summer fishing, especially shark fishing.

 site was originally occupied by Tāmaki Māori who descended from the &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory waka and developed the tribal identity Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki. It was prized for its strategic location and view over the Waitematā Harbour, and protected fisheries and kūmara gardens of the nearby volcanic soil. The pā was repeatedly attacked in the 17th and 18th centuries. Ngāti Paoa attacked and took ownership of Onewa, who in turn were attacked by Ngāti Whātua. After Ngāti Whātua&#x27;s conflict with the Waiohua paramount chief Kiwi Tāmaki in the mid-18th century, was occupied by the Ngāti Whātua chief Tarahawaiki.

During the early 1820s, most Māori of the North Shore fled for the Waikato or Northland due to the threat of war parties during the Musket Wars, and was left unoccupied. Some members of Ngāi Tai returned to the Northcote area in the 1830s, led by Hetaraka Takapuna. The pā was occupied until the mid-1850s, and Hetaraka Takapuna&#x27;s descendants lived on the shores of Tank Farm into the 1890s.

===Early European settlement===

The Northcote area was a part of the Mahurangi Block, an area purchased by the Crown on 13 April 1841. Land at Northcote Point was subdivided into eight lots in 1843. The Callan family settled in the same year, and Phillip Callan established a brickyard at Sulphur Beach. In the next few years, other settlers including James Kelly, William Nicholson, Patrick Heath moved to Northcote. While some settlers relocated from other parts of Auckland, many of the new settlers moved from Hokianga. The greater Northcote area was purchased by the New Zealand Company in 1844, intending to develop a colonial settlement. As there was little interest in the settlement, the individual land blocks were sold. From 1848, a soap and candle factory was established on Sulphur Beach, and other early industries included timber milling and kauri gum digging.

In 1848, the Catholic Church purchased of land near Northcote, building St Mary&#x27;s School and the Awataha Catholic Mission. Opening in 1851, the school taught Māori and Pākehā students from across the country.

In 1852, the Crown granted land at Barry&#x27;s Point / Awataha to Ngāpuhi chief Eruera Maihi Patuone, in order to create a shield for the City of Auckland against potential invasion from Ngāpuhi and other northern tribes. Patuone&#x27;s people lived in the area until the 1880s.

The Northcote ferry service began in 1854, run by James Reed. The regular ferry service led to the development of Northcote. In 1859, Philip Callan constructed the Northcote Tavern, likely using bricks from his Sulphur Beach brickworks. The hotel became an early focal point of the community, and led to Northcote becoming a gateway to the north. Many people would leave their horses at the tavern while visiting Auckland city. The first ferry service from Northcote Wharf began operating from May 1860. Three months later, St John&#x27;s Anglican Church was established as the earliest church in Northcote, serving both the Northcote and Birkenhead areas. The church is the oldest currently existing building on the North Shore.

In 1878, Auckland Chemical Works was established at Northcote, on the beach next to the brickworks. The factory processed sulfur from Moutohora Island in the Bay of Plenty, but was unprofitable, as the amount of sulfur estimated to be on the island was overestimated.

===Suburban development and Awataha Catholic Mission===

Northcote developed suburban housing between 1880 and 1910, with many of the 1880s villas still standing today. Takapuna and Northcote grew significantly during this period, despite the effects of the Long Depression. Northcote Point grew to become a commuter suburb for people working in Auckland, due to the ferry service. Many wealthy Aucklanders built homes in the Northcote area, including Mr. Caughey of Smith &amp; Caughey&#x27;s department store. Hall&#x27;s Beach and Sulphur Beach became popular spots for tourists and picnickers.

From 1880 to 1910, Northcote was known for fruit production, and in 1886 the Birkenhead and Northcote Fruitgrowing Association was formed. In addition to orchards, major crops in Northcote included strawberries, peas and cucumbers. In 1885, a slaughterhouse was constructed in Northcote, serving Takapuna and the surrounding rural areas, and farms in the Northcote area specialised in providing milk supplies for Auckland.

In 1891, St Mary&#x27;s School and the Awataha Catholic Mission gave permission for Māori led by Te Hemera Tauhia to resettle church lands at Awataha, some of whom were Te Kawerau ā Maki. This community established on the northern shores of Tank Farm over the next twenty years. The Catholic church, needing to raise funds to establish Hato Petera College, leased out these lands to engineer and land developer Harry Hopper Adams. Adams saw opportunity for developing the area, and trespassed the Māori of Awataha in 1916. In 1920, the whare was torn down, and residents of Awataha made petitions to parliament to stop the evictions, arguing that Awataha was not included in the Mahurangi Purchase. Some members of the Awataha community were given lifetime leases of Catholic land at Awataha, while others were arrested.

===Borough status and growth===

In 1908, Northcote had grown enough to be proclaimed a borough, which allowed Northcote to have its own council and mayor. To celebrate this, the Stoke Point headland was proclaimed to be a public reserve. A flagstaff was erected at Stoke Point, a memorial tōtara tree was planted at the site, named Tainui by Māori local to the North Shore, and the Stokes Point headland gained the name (&quot;The Single Tōtara Tree&quot;). The tree was later damaged in a storm.

In 1903, the Northcote Athenaeum Society was established, which organised pleasurable literary and musical evenings for residents, including recitals poetry readings and plays. In 1912, the Northcote Masonic Lodge was constructed. From the 1920s, Chinese market gardeners had begun operating in the Northcote area.

Northcote grew significantly as a suburb in the 1920s, with development focused around the Queen Street area at Northcote Point, close to the ferry terminal. A new concrete road and bus barns were constructed in 1927, joined in the same year by a cinema called the Onewa Picture Drome. Renamed the King&#x27;s Theatre in the 1930s, it was renamed Bridgeway after the construction of the Auckland Harbour Bridge. By the 1920s, the gas works at Little Shoal Bay, first established in 1902, had become the biggest single employer in the Northcote Borough.

In 1942, during World War II, the United States Army established bulk fuel storage tanks at the northern of the two volcanic craters, which led to its common name Tank Farm. As a part of this construction, the Awataha (cemetery ground) was removed.

In the 1950s, a small state housing development was constructed in central Northcote. The Northcote War Memorial Library, designed by Thorpe, Cutter, Pickmere and Douglas, was formally opened on 10 March 1956. The library was funded through local carnivals and grants from the New Zealand Government.

===Auckland Harbour Bridge===

A bridge across the Waitematā Harbour between Auckland and the North Shore had been discussed since the 1860s. Plans for a bridge crossing were formalised in the 1940s, with construction in Northcote beginning in the mid-1950s.

Construction of the harbour bridge and the Auckland Northern Motorway led to major changes in the environment. Much of on Stokes Point was destroyed to make way for the harbour bridge landing, as well as parts of the Onewa Domain including the pine trees and ensign. The eastern coastline beaches were reclaimed to make way for the motorway. During the 1960s, the Onepoto Basin, formerly open to the harbour, was drained and redeveloped into recreational facilities.

The harbour bridge was officially opened on 30 May 1959. Northcote Shopping Centre was opened by the Borough council on 19 June 1959, which led to northern Northcote becoming the commercial centre of the suburb and a growth hub. Former farmland was suburbanised, and an industrial area developed at Barry&#x27;s Point. While Northcote Central grew, the Northcote Point community suffered after the opening of the bridge. The ferry service was stopped, shops at Northcote Point closed, and Queen Street, once a major road, became a side street.

===Later developments and urban regeneration===
In 1966, the North Shore Teachers College moved to a new campus at Northcote. In 1971, a feature seafood restaurant called Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf was built by restaurateur Bob Sell, adjacent to Northcote wharf. While the restaurant closed two years later, the building is currently known as The Wharf, an events centre.

In 1989, Northcote Borough was merged into the North Shore City. By the 1990s, Asian communities had begun to develop at Northcote. In the 2000s, the Chinese New Zealander community of Northcote started holding annual Chinese New Year parades in the suburb.

In the late 1990s, the former Smale family farm was redeveloped into Smales Farm, a commercial complex adjacent to the motorway. This was joined by the Akoranga Business Park, developed adjacent to the headquarters for The Warehouse Group.

Under the Auckland Unitary Plan, Northcote was identified as a key area for planned intensification. Gentrification became a more prominent issue in Northcote during this period. 1,700 new homes are planned to be constructed in Northcote in the 2020s, while at the same time a new greenway reneration project was established in Northcote. Te Ara Awataha is an urban renewal project which includes a series of urban parks, native plant regeneration, and daylighting the Awataha Stream, which had been undergrounded in stormwater pipes in the 1950s.

==Local government==
The first local government in the area was the North Shore Highway District, which began operating in 1868 and administered roading and similar projects across the North Shore. From 1876, Northcote was also a part of the Takapuna Riding of Waitemata County; a large rural county north and west of the city of Auckland. In 1908 after the population reached 1,000, Northcote separated from Waitemata County and formed the Borough of Northcote.

In 1989, Northcote was merged into the North Shore City. North Shore City was amalgamated into Auckland Council in November 2010.

Within the Auckland Council, Northcote is a part of the Kaipātiki local government area governed by the Kaipātiki Local Board. It is a part of the North Shore ward, which elects two councillors to the Auckland Council.

===Mayors of Northcote Borough===
During its existence, from 1908 to 1989, Northcote Borough had 15 mayors. The following is a complete list:

==Amenities==
*The Northcote Shopping Centre, the commercial centre of the suburb, which features aWoolworths supermarket as an anchor store.
*Smiths Bush in the Onewa Domain is a remnant native forest, dominated by kahikatea and taraire trees. Originally purchased by Alexander Mackay, his son-in-law Thomas Drummond preserved the forest from milling. The park became a public reserve in 1942, and received its name from James and Catherine Smith, the owners of the land who preserved it in the early 20th century. A large section of the forest was felled in 1959, during the construction of the Auckland Northern Motorway.
*Northart is a gallery and community centre located in Northcote, which focuses on exhibiting artists from the North Shore.
*Kauri Glen is a steep area of remnant native bush that was reserved in 1907.
* Northcote Tavern was first built in the late 1850s by Irish immigrant Philip Callan, the building was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in 1888. Originally a hotel, the building became a tavern after the opening of the Auckland Harbour Bridge in 1959 meant that fewer people needed overnight stays on the North Shore.
* St John the Baptist (Anglican Church)
*Stokes Point Reserve, the location of . Established as a reserve in 1908, the area became less inviting after the construction of the Auckland Harbour Bridge in the 1950s. In 2015, the reserve was redeveloped as an area celebrating heritage, including designs by Lucy Tukua of Ngāti Pāoa.

==Notable people==
*George Graham, New Zealand ethnographer, lived at Northcote Point in the early 1900s.

==Education==
The first school in Northcote was Stokes Point School (later Northcote School), established in 1873. Located at the site of Northcote College, the schoolhouse was built in 1878. By the 1920s, the school had developed a reputation for strict teaching methods and harsh discipline, leading many families to send their children to Wellesley Street School in central Auckland. In 1924, the school became a junior high school.

Northcote College is a coeducational secondary (years 9–13) school with a roll of . It was established in 1877. Northcote Intermediate is an intermediate (years 7–8) school with a roll of . It celebrated its 50th jubilee in 2008. Onepoto School is a contributing primary (years 1–6) school with a roll of . It shares a site with Northcote Intermediate.

During its early years, the College incorporated Standards five and six (Forms one and two) which were transferred to Northcote Intermediate School when that was established as a separate entity on its present site in Lake Road in Northcote Central in 1958.

Northcote Primary School is a coeducational contributing primary (years 1–6) school with a roll of . It was established on its present site in 1918. The Northcote area war memorial stands at the front of the school, on the corner of Lake and Onewa Roads.

St Mary&#x27;s School is a primary school with a roll of . It is a state integrated Catholic school, which provides education for both boys and girls in years 1–6, and for girls only in years 7–8. It celebrated its 75th Jubilee in 2008.

Rolls are as of 

Auckland University of Technology has its North Campus on Akoranga Drive.

Hato Petera College was a secondary (years 9–13) school. It opened as Saint Peter&#x27;s Catechist School in 1928 and changed its name in 1972. It was a state integrated Catholic Māori school, and offered full-time boarding for enrolled students until the end of 2016, when it became a day school. It closed in 2018.

==Sport and recreation==

The suburb is also home to the Northcote Tigers rugby league club, which was founded in 1910. The Northcote and Birkenhead Rugby Union Club was founded 1929.

==Transport==
Northcote is adjacent to the Auckland Northern Motorway, which runs along the east of the suburb. Auckland ferry services run by Fullers Group stop at Northcote Point, near the northern end of the Auckland Harbour Bridge.

In the year 2000, a Northern Busway station was proposed for Northcote, located on Stafford Road. This proposed station was cancelled in December 2000, after lobbying by residents, who were concerned about increased traffic and public transport in the area.

<doc id="1211220" wikidata="Q2575275" url="?curid=1211220" title="Les Savy Fav">
<text>Les Savy Fav ( ) is an American indie rock band based in New York City. Their style is influenced by art punk and post-hardcore. The group is known for the stage presence of lead singer Tim Harrington. The band is signed to Frenchkiss Records, which is owned by the band&#x27;s bassist, Syd Butler.

==History==
The group&#x27;s original 1995 line-up all met while attending the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, Rhode Island. Live shows are punctuated by the antics of frontman Harrington, including interacting with audience members and on-stage wardrobe changes. The rest of the band continues to play as if nothing out of the ordinary is happening. Guitar player Gibb Slife left the band after their second LP. Drummer Mahoney was replaced by Harrison Haynes.

The band started a planned hiatus in mid-2005, which led to speculation that they might have broken up, but Harrington confirmed that Les Savy Fav would return and indeed they did, playing a live performance at the British All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in May 2007. Andrew Reuland joined the band in 2006 as the second guitar player. The band booked studio time in November of that year to record their fourth full-length album, &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Friends&quot;, which was released September 18, 2007. They performed &quot;Patty Lee&quot; live on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; on January 31, 2008. Their song &quot;Hold Onto Your Genre&quot; is featured in the soundtrack to &quot;MLB 2K7&quot;, as well as commercials for the game. Furthermore, their song &quot;Raging in the Plague Age&quot; is featured on an in-game radio station in GTA IV.

Bass player Syd Butler is also the owner of Frenchkiss Records. Seth Jabour is also known for his work as an illustrator and graphic designer. Former drummer Pat Mahoney also played in LCD Soundsystem.

The Derry/London based band Jetplane Landing included a song on their 2007 album &quot;Backlash Cop&quot; entitled &quot;Why Do They Never Play Les Savy Fav On The Radio?&quot;

The song &quot;The Sweat Descends&quot; appears in the commercial for the Cartoon Network movie, &quot;Fire Breather&quot;, as well as the soundtrack for College Hoops 2K7.

The 2011 &quot;True Blood&quot; episode &#x27;Let&#x27;s Get Out of Here&#x27; was named for the band&#x27;s song, which is featured in the episode.

In December 2011, the band co-curated the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties &quot;Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; festival in Minehead, England alongside Battles and Caribou.
The song &quot;The Equestrian&quot; is featured on the soundtrack for NHL 2K8.
Some of the band&#x27;s members are now in the house band for Late Night With Seth Meyers.

In 2020, the band was booked to play at Primavera Sound&#x27;s twentieth anniversary.

In February 2024 the band released its first new single in 14 years, &quot;Legendary Tippers&quot;. Later in the month it announced their sixth album, and first for over a decade, &quot;Oui, LSF&quot;. They also released the single &quot;Guzzle Blood&quot;.

==Musical style==
Initially, their music featured an abrasive sound fitting in the noise rock genre and reminiscent of the music of Fugazi and Jawbox. Later, their music became more idiosyncratic, shifting to a more radio-friendly sound close to that of befriended bands Bloc Party and Enon. Kele Okereke of Bloc Party wrote of Les Savy Fav&#x27;s influence on his band for an article in The Observer in 2005, and members of Enon have contributed to several Les Savy Fav tracks.

<text>The British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) was the British Commonwealth taskforce consisting of Australian, British, Indian, and New Zealander military forces in occupied Japan, from 1946 until the end of occupation in 1952.

At its peak, the BCOF committed about 40,000 personnel, that comprised 25% of the occupation force, which was equal to about a third of the number of US military personnel in Japan.

==History==
===Background===
Following the dropping of the atomic bombs and the entry of the Soviet Union into the war against Japan, the Japanese Empire surrendered to the Allies on 15 August 1945, with their government accepting the Potsdam Declaration. The formal surrender was signed on 2 September in Tokyo Bay. Unlike in the occupation of Germany, the Soviet Union had little to no influence over the occupation of Japan, leaving the Americans, British, and Commonwealth Forces responsible for occupation duties.

Whilst United States Forces Japan was responsible for military government, BCOF was responsible for supervising demilitarisation and the disposal of Japan&#x27;s war industries. The BCOF was also responsible for the occupation of the western prefectures of Shimane, Yamaguchi, Tottori, Okayama, Hiroshima, and Shikoku Island. BCOF headquarters was at Kure, a naval port near Hiroshima. At the height of its involvement, the British Commonwealth Occupation Force was responsible for 20 million Japanese citizens in an area of around 57,000 km2.

===Occupation===
The participation of BCOF in the Allied occupation of Japan was announced on 31 January 1946, but had been planned since the end of the war. On 21 February 1946, the initial contingent arrived at the former Imperial Japanese Navy base at Kure, near the devastated city of Hiroshima, which became the main base for Australian and British warships. A Royal Navy shore party took control of the port and facilities and these were commissioned as HMS &quot;Commonwealth&quot; on 3 June 1946.

For most of the occupation period, Australia contributed the majority of the BCOF&#x27;s personnel. The initial BCOF presence included the Australian 34th Brigade; the 9th Brigade, 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (J Force); and the British Indian Division (BRINDIV) (later known as BRINJAP), a composite British and Indian division made up of the British 5th Infantry Brigade Group (from 2nd Infantry Division in India), and the 268th Indian Infantry Brigade. BCOF was supported by the Women&#x27;s Auxiliary Service (Burma) (which derived its name from its formation during the Second World War, to provide amenities to Commonwealth forces in the Burmese campaign).

The British Pacific Fleet initially provided most of the naval forces, with it consisting of primarily British ships alongside contingents of Commonwealth and US ships. The air component, known as the British Commonwealth Air Forces (BCAIR), initially comprised the Royal Australian Air Force&#x27;s No. 81 Fighter Wing, four Spitfire squadrons (including No. 11 and No. 17 of the Royal Air Force and No. 4 of the Indian Air Force), and No. 14 Squadron of the Royal New Zealand Air Force.

During 1947, the BCOF began to wind down its presence in Japan. By 1948, BCOF was solely staffed by Australian military personnel, with all British, Indian, and New Zealand troops withdrawn from the occupation. From 1950 onwards, however, BCOF bases provided staging posts for Commonwealth forces deployed to the Korean War. The BCOF was effectively wound-up in 1951, as control of Commonwealth forces in Japan was transferred to British Commonwealth Forces Korea.

==Organisation==

* British Indian Division

* Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson (June 1946 to November 1951); and
* Lieutenant General William Bridgeford (November 1951 to April 1952)

<text>Reform Democrats in the United States are members of the Democratic Party who are opposed to the Democratic political machines of their respective cities, counties, or U.S. states, or to analogous machine politics at a national level. Reform Democrats are generally associated with the good government traditions that arose out of the progressive movement of the early 20th century, and are usually, but not always, on the left wing of the Democratic Party. The lines between anti-machine Reform Democrats and pro-machine Regular Democrats are not always clear: often, once reformers achieve office, they take advantage of patronage to establish a machine in their own right. An example of this is the rise of the &quot;Reform machine&quot; of Jim Brennan in the wake of his triumph over the more traditional machine of Meade Esposito in Brooklyn, New York, in the 1980s.

Reform Democrats were contrasted with machine-affiliated regular Democrats. Noted Reform Democrats included Massachusetts&#x27;s Michael Dukakis, and New York&#x27;s John J. B. Shea and Arnold Fein. Although the term has somewhat fallen out of use since the 1970s, it still has some currency in Greater New York area, such as the Hudson County Reform Democratic Organization in New Jersey. One of the best-known Reform Democrat clubs is the Village Independent Democrats, based in Greenwich Village, which toppled Carmine DeSapio and the might of Tammany Hall.

<text>The M1 was a class of steam locomotive of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). It was a class of heavy mixed-traffic locomotives of the &quot;Mountain&quot; arrangement, which uses four pairs of driving wheels with a four-wheel guiding truck in front for stability at speed and a two-wheel trailing truck to support the large firebox needed for sustained power. Although built for both passenger and freight work, they spent most of their service lives hauling heavy high-speed freight trains. Many PRR men counted the M1 class locomotives as the best steam locomotives the railroad ever owned.

==History==
A single prototype, #6699, was built in 1923 at the railroad&#x27;s Altoona Works. It spent three years in testing, including all kinds of main line service as well as a session on the railroad&#x27;s static test plant. Having received favorable reports, a further 200 were ordered from commercial locomotive builders; 175 from the Baldwin Locomotive Works and 25 from Lima Locomotive Works. Breaking with the PRR tradition of random locomotive numbering, these were numbered in a solid block from #6800-#6999.

In 1930, 100 more were ordered; this class M1a had several improvements. Instead of separate cylinder block and smokebox saddle castings, the M1a had a one-piece casting (first seen on the K5 Pacific) with inside steam delivery pipes, instead of the outside, visible pipes of the M1. A Worthington feedwater heater was installed, with a boxlike mixing chamber behind the stack. Twin cross-compound air compressors were hung next to each other on the left side, instead of the single compressor of the M1. The M1a locomotives had larger tenders than the previous locomotives.

The M1a locomotives were intended for passenger as well as freight service, and some bore decorative gold-leaf lining on tender and cab sides, but they proved better suited to freight work, and extensive electrification saw a surplus of K4s locomotives available for passenger trains. While they were mostly used on freight, their dual service purpose entitled them to have smokebox mounted keystone shaped numberplates. Freight engines on the Pennsy had circular numberplates.

Like most PRR steam locomotives, the M1 and M1a featured the square-shouldered Belpaire firebox. The square-topped section continued ahead of the firebox proper, revealing the presence of a combustion chamber - an extended firebox, giving more room for complete combustion of burning gases. The standard M1/M1a boiler used a working pressure of . 40 locomotives were later converted into class M1b; the differences were all in the boiler, those being the addition of firebox circulators—large tubes carrying water passing through the firebox space, increasing water circulation and heating area, and thus steam generation—and an increase in boiler pressure to . The only externally visible difference was extra cleaning plugs in the firebox sides, for washing out the circulators. The M1b had greater tractive effort, thanks to the greater pressure, and more power at speed.

All were fitted with driving wheels, two cylinders, and cast-steel KW pattern trailing trucks, similar to those fitted to K4s Pacifics. M1 and M1a tractive effort was while that of the M1b was . Weight was . PRR standard small steel cabs were used. A spotting feature was a large cross-mounted air tank at the front of the locomotive above the pilot. There was a family resemblance with other PRR locomotives. After World War II, the M1 locomotives underwent similar front-end changes to those made to the K4s, including sheet steel drop-coupler pilots, the moving of the headlight to the smokebox top in front of the stack, the moving of the steam-driven generator to the smokebox front for easier maintenance, and the addition of a wide step above the air tank to service the air compressor.
A variety of tenders were fitted to M1 locomotives, of steadily-increasing size. During later years some hauled sixteen-wheel 210-F-75B tenders almost as long as the locomotives themselves. All were fitted with scoops to pick up water from track pans. On the rear tender decks, all were later fitted with &quot;doghouses&quot; for the head-end brakeman on freight trains, giving him a view backward over the train and placing him out of the way of the engineer and fireman. Many had railing-like trainphone antennas added during the 1940s.

As dieselization progressed, the M1 locomotives were assigned to heavier trains, while the diesels were assigned the high-speed freight trains that were previously the M1s&#x27; preserve. Their final years of service saw them hauling heavier trains than ever. Many remained in service until the withdrawal of steam from the PRR in mid-1957.

==Preservation==
One locomotive, M1b #6755, was saved from the scrapper&#x27;s torch for the PRR&#x27;s historical collection housed at Northumberland, Pennsylvania. It is now in the possession of the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania, in Strasburg, PA. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as Locomotive No. 6755.

The tender of M1 #6659, minus the engine, has also been preserved and was purchased by the Pennsylvania Railroad T1 Steam Locomotive Trust in August, 2017. The tender will be restored for eventual use behind the new-build T1 class locomotive #5550.

<doc id="1211239" wikidata="Q838733" url="?curid=1211239" title="Riodinidae">
<text>Riodinidae is the family of metalmark butterflies. The common name &quot;metalmarks&quot; refers to the small, metallic-looking spots commonly found on their wings. The 1,532 species are placed in 146 genera. Although mostly Neotropical in distribution, the family is also represented both in the Nearctic, Palearctic, Australasian (&quot;Dicallaneura&quot;), Afrotropic (&quot;Afriodinia&quot;, &quot;Saribia&quot;), and Indomalayan realms.

== Description ==

The family includes small to medium-sized species, from 12 to 60 mm wingspan, often with vibrant structural colouring. The wing shape is very different within the family. They may resemble butterflies in other groups, some are similar to Satyrinae, some are bright yellow reminiscent of Coliadinae and others (examples &quot;Barbicornis&quot;, &quot;Rhetus arcius&quot;, &quot;Helicopis&quot;, &quot;Chorinea&quot;) have tails as do Papilionidae. The colouration ranges from muted colours in the temperate zone species to iridescent blue and green wings and transparent wings in tropical species. The golden or silvery metallic spots on the wings in many species of the Americas gave them the English common name &quot;metalmarks&quot;. A number of species mimic poisonous moths of several families and there are often extensive mimicry rings of similar-looking species, grouped around a model. Mimicry causes often closely related species to have completely different wing patterns, for example the genus &quot;Thisbe&quot;. Many species mimic the stain and stripe pattern of toxic Nymphalidae. Batesian mimicry seems to be more common than in any other insect family of similar size. Reasons for this are unknown. Another example is &quot;Ithomeis&quot; where different subspecies resemble the species they mimic in different parts of the geographic range more than they resemble each other.

The delimitation from the closely related Lycaenidae by morphological autapomorphy is difficult. The first pair of legs of the males, which arises on the prothorax, is less than half as long as the legs of the pterothorax and they are not used for walking. The individual segments of the tarsus are sometimes fused together and fused with the tibia, and the pretarsi have no claws. This feature is also found in some Lycaenidae (and also the Monotrysia), but in these the legs are always much longer. The sensory hairs on the tarsi of the female forelimbs are arranged in a group. These groups which are arranged in pairs can be found in the other taxa of the Papilionoidea. The third problematic apomorphy is the absence of the rear projections (apophyses) of the female genitalia. This feature (absence) is found as well in some species of the subfamily of Poritiinae.

In almost all Riodinidae, the coxae of the front legs are extended on males jutting out over the trochanter (only hinted at in &quot;Styx infernalis&quot; and &quot;Corrachia leucoplaga&quot;). If there are similar projections in Lycaenidae (in genera &quot;Curetis&quot;, &quot;Feniseca&quot; and &quot;Poritia&quot;), they are built differently in detail and may be, for example, dorsally convex. In addition, almost all Riodinidae in contrast to the Lycaenidae have a humeral vein in the hindwings and the costa is thickened (exceptions in the subfamily Hamearinae). The head in relation to the eyes is wider than in Lycaenidae, making the antennal bases further away from the eye. The relatively long antennae often reach half of the front wing length.

Riodinidae have an unusual variety in chromosome numbers, only some very basal groups have the number typical for butterflies (between 29 and 31) or the number characteristic of Lycaenidae (23 to 24). Numbers between 9 and 110 occur. In some cases, representatives of a morphologically indistinguishable cryptospecies have different chromosome numbers and are reproductively isolated.

== Distinguishing features ==

Like the lycaenids, the males of this family have reduced forelegs while the females have full-sized, fully functional forelegs. The foreleg of males is often reduced and has a uniquely shaped first segment (the coxa) which extends beyond its joint with the second segment, rather than meeting it flush. They have a unique venation on the hindwing: the costa of the hindwing is thickened out to the humeral angle and the humeral vein is short.

== Taxonomy and systematics ==

Riodinidae is currently treated as a distinct family within the superfamily Papilionoidea, but in the past they were held to be the subfamily Riodininae of the Lycaenidae. Earlier, they were considered to be part of the now defunct family Erycinidae, whose species are divided between this family and the subfamily Libytheinae.

Today, most systematists prefer to accept an independent family even if there are counter arguments. Based on morphological studies Ackery et al. in the manual of zoology (Kristensen 1998, cf. literature) placed Riodininae within the Lycaenidae. Kristensen et al. accepted the updating of the manual in 2007 raising the classification to family rank at least on a provisional basis.

Molecular phylogenetics (based on homologous DNA sequences) establishes a sister group relationship between the Riodinidae and the Lycaenidae accepted almost unanimously.

=== Subfamilies ===

The family Riodinidae has been historically been classified using a two subfamily (Stichel, 1928) or three subfamily (Callaghan and Lamas, 2004) system. Genetic data from Seraphim &quot;et al.&quot; (2018) supports the two subfamily interpretation, with the subfamily Euselasiinae being subsumed entirely within the Old World Nemeobiinae.

Two subfamily model (Stichel, 1928)
* Nemeobiinae
* Riodininae

Three subfamily model (Callaghan and Lamas, 2004)
* Euselasiinae
* Nemeobiinae
* Riodininae

The fossil genus &quot;Lithopsyche&quot; is sometimes placed here but sometimes within the Lycaenidae.

== Biology ==

Species occur in a variety of habitats, but have a unique distribution focus in the tropical rain forests of South America. Many species are rarely found and have a relatively small distribution area. Species of the genus &quot;Charis&quot; were therefore used to reconstruct the history of the forest of the Amazon basin: each of the 19 species has a vicariant distribution area, three originally separate forests (upper, lower Amazonas, Guyana) can be derived from the relationship between the species.

The food plants for the caterpillars total more than 40 plant families. Mostly young leaves or flowers are used, and rarely fallen, dead leaves or lichen are eaten. The larvae feed mostly individually not gregariously. However, gregarious caterpillars are found within the Euselasiinae (&quot;Euselasia&quot;), Riodinini (&quot;Melanis&quot;) and Emesini (&quot;Emesis&quot;), with some species demonstrating processionary behaviours. Available evidence from &quot;Euselasia&quot; and &quot;Hades&quot; suggests the gregarious trait may be widespread among members of the subfamily Euselasiinae.

The larva of &quot;Setabis lagus&quot; (Riodininae: Nymphidiini), is predatory. There are records of predation on larvae of &quot;Horiola&quot; species (family Membracidae) as well as scale insects (Coccidae). Predatory feeding has also been shown in &quot;Alesa amesis&quot;. A number of species associate with and are protected by ants during one or more stages of their life cycle.

A study in Ecuador based on adult male feeding records for 124 species in 41 genera of Riodinidae (out of a total of 441 species in 85 genera collected in the study) demonstrated that rotting fish and other carrion was the most frequently used food source in terms of numbers of individuals and taxa, attracting 89 species from 32 genera. Other food substrates visited in this study included flowers, damp sand or mud-puddling.

== Life cycle ==

The eggs vary in shape, but often appear round and flattened, some have the shape of a dome or turban. They are similar to the eggs of the Lycaenidae. The caterpillars are usually hairy and plump, and are the common overwintering stage. The caterpillars are usually longer than those of the Lycaenidae except in the myrmecophilous species. Pupae are hairy and attached with silk to either the host plant or to ground debris or leaf litter. No cocoon is seen.

Several genera of Riodinidae have evolved intimate associations with ants, and their larvae are tended and defended by ant associates. This also is the case with several lineages of Lycaenidae and contributed to arguments for the uniting the two families. It is now recognized that myrmecophily arose several times among Riodinidae and Lycaenidae clades.

Like their sister family Lycaenidae, numerous species of Riodinidae are myrmecophiles (involving about 280 ant species). The larvae of many species have special organs, which have a soothing or tempting effect on ants. Many Riodinidae larvae have so-called &quot;tentacle nectary organs&quot; on the eighth segment of the abdomen that secrete a fluid which is eaten by ants. Other tentacle organs on the third thoracic segment have been shown to emit allomones which influence ants. Studies suggest caterpillar acoustic signals are used to enhance their symbioses with ants (see singing caterpillars). The location of riodinid organs that function in caterpillar-ant symbioses differs from those found in the Lycaenidae, suggesting that the organs in these two families of butterflies are not homologous in origin.

=== Food plants ===

The larvae feed on plants of the families Araceae, Asteraceae, Bromeliaceae, Bombacaceae, Cecropiaceae, Clusiaceae, Dilleniaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Lecythidaceae, Loranthaceae, Malpighiaceae, Marantaceae, Melastomataceae, Myrtaceae, Orchidaceae, Rubiaceae, Sapindaceae, Zingiberaceae as well as bryophytes and lichens.

== Economic significance ==

The importance of Riodinidae species considered pests is very low. Some species of Euselasiinae feed on Myrtaceae of economic importance such as guava. A few Riodininae are specified as harmful to farmed Bromeliaceae or Orchidaceae.

<text>Super Troopers is a 2001 American comedy film directed by Jay Chandrasekhar and written by and starring the Broken Lizard comedy group (Chandrasekhar, Kevin Heffernan, Steve Lemme, Paul Soter and Erik Stolhanske). Marisa Coughlan, Daniel von Bargen and Brian Cox co-star while Lynda Carter has a cameo appearance. In total, Fox Searchlight paid $3.25 million for distribution rights of the film and it grossed $23 million at the box office.

A sequel, &quot;Super Troopers 2&quot;, was released on April 20, 2018.

== Plot ==
In the fictional town of Spurbury, Vermont, four Vermont state troopers patrol a section of highway and compete for prominence with the local police department. Although they are warned that their station risks being shuttered due to low productivity, the troopersLieutenant Arcot Ramathorn, &quot;Rabbit&quot; Roto, &quot;Mac&quot; Womack, and Carl Fosterdelight in playing practical jokes on unsuspecting motorists and each other, rather than enforcing the law. They particularly enjoy tormenting fellow trooper Rodney Farva, a cocky and overzealous officer who has been suspended from the road for an unspecified incident.

The troopers, led by Captain John O&#x27;Hagen, are called to investigate an abandoned Winnebago off the highway, only to find the Spurbury police have already arrived: by claiming the investigation, the Spurbury police chief, Bruce Grady, hopes to force the closure of the troopers&#x27; station, thereby securing increased funding for his agency. The animosity leads to a brawl between the assembled officers, during which the body of a murdered woman is discovered inside the Winnebago. The troopers observe a tattoo on the dead woman depicting a monkey. During a routine traffic stop of a semi-truck shortly after, Foster and Womack discover a large shipment of marijuana marked with stickers depicting the same monkey. The troopers suspect the dead woman and the marijuana are related. However, Chief Grady laughs off the claim and refuses Captain O&#x27;Hagen&#x27;s suggestion that the troopers and local police cooperate on the investigation.

Foster begins a relationship with Spurbury police officer Ursula Hanson and, while attempting to have sex with her in the now-impounded Winnebago, discovers hidden bundles of marijuana, all bearing the same monkey sticker. Foster conspires with Ursula, who hates her coworkers and is stuck manning the front desk, to reveal the bust at an upcoming visit by the governor, thereby proving the troopers&#x27; suspicions and embarrassing the local police. Meanwhile, Farva is reinstated to patrol and partnered with an exasperated Ramathorn. However, Farva attacks a restaurant cashier and is arrested by the Spurbury police. Chief Grady offers Farva a job with his department in exchange for information about the drug investigation, but Farva refuses. Farva is subsequently reprimanded by an infuriated O&#x27;Hagen, who re-suspends Farva.

The governor arrives in Spurbury; Ramathorn and Foster break into the police impound and steal the Winnebago, planning to reveal the marijuana discovered by Foster at a press conference. They barely make it in time, only to discover the marijuana has already been seized by the Spurbury police, with Chief Grady claiming credit. Foster accuses Ursula of revealing the location of the marijuana in exchange for a favorable assignment. Having nothing to show for their efforts, the state troopers expect their station to be shut down.

Back at the station, the troopers find Farva dressed in a Spurbury police uniform; Foster realizes that it was Farva, not Ursula, who betrayed the location of the marijuana. The troopers, including Captain O&#x27;Hagen, handcuff Farva to a toilet and drunkenly vandalize Chief Grady&#x27;s house. Ursula offers to help the troopers get back at Grady and tips them off to intercept a drug-running truck. As they attempt to pursue it, the troopers encounter an escaped Farva, who holds them at gunpoint and berates them for not taking him seriously as a cop. O&#x27;Hagen intervenes and the troopers convince Farva to help them stop the drug smugglers. Following the truck to a nearby airfield, the troopers observe it being loaded with marijuana from a Canadian-marked plane. Chief Grady and several Spurbury officers then arrive, and the troopers realize that the local police are running protection for the smugglers. After creating a diversion, the troopers brawl with the Spurbury officers and smugglers, ultimately arresting them.

Some days later, the governor sends Captain O&#x27;Hagen a letter thanking him for his efforts, but telling him the station will still be shut down. Three months later, Ramathorn and Rabbit, as deliverymen, find themselves bringing a keg of beer to a party hosted by underage college students they previously arrested. As the teenagers torment the seemingly powerless ex-troopers, they remove their deliverymen&#x27;s uniforms to reveal that they are Spurbury police officers, having replaced their corrupt predecessors.

== Production ==
Broken Lizard member Steve Lemme stated that the idea for the film came from road-tripping to various weddings in his friend and fellow BL member Jay Chandrasekhar&#x27;s car and frequently getting pulled over by cops. As they were frequently under the influence of drugs, the gang began to wonder what would happen if the cops were aware of the situation and &quot;had a sense of humor&quot;. Theorizing that if they did that they &quot;could have fucked with us so much.&quot;

The opening chase scene that ended at Thin Queen Tavern, was actually The Golden Rail Ale House, located in Newburgh, New York.

The syrup-chugging scene was filmed in M&#x27;s Cozy Corner located in Fishkill, New York, which has since closed.

Kevin Heffernan reported the film’s directors wanted to cast Bill Murray for the role of Captain John O&#x27;Hagen. They reached out to Murray’s agent and made an offer of $100,000, but instead pivoted to casting Brian Cox.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
 On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 48 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Film critic Roger Ebert awarded the film stars out of 4, saying &quot;I can&#x27;t quite recommend it — it&#x27;s too patched together — but I almost can; it&#x27;s the kind of movie that makes you want to like it&quot;. A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a negative review and opined that the film is &quot;bad and tasteless&quot;.

=== Box office ===
Overall, the film grossed $18.5 million in the United States and a total of $23.2 million worldwide. The film would eventually become a cult film with &quot;Esquire&quot; describing it as &quot;shaggy-dog classic for Generation Y.&quot; It made $60 million from VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray rentals, and as of December 2006 another $10.6 million from sales.

<text>Matic Osovnikar (born January 19, 1980, in Kranj) is a former Slovenian athlete specializing in the 100 metres. Osovnikar competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics where he achieved third place in his 100 metres heat, thus making through to the second round but narrowly missed out on a placing in the semi-finals after achieving fourth place in his second round heat.

He was the bronze medalist in the 100 m at the 2006 European Athletics Championships, setting a new national record (10.14 s).

He finished 7th in the 100 m final at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka with a time of 10.23 s.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Osovnikar competed at the 100 metres and placed 3rd in his heat after Samuel Francis and Marc Burns in a time of 10.46 seconds. He qualified for the second round in which he improved his time to 10.24 seconds. However, he was unable to qualify for the semi-finals as he finished in 6th place of his heat. He also took part in the 200 metres finishing fourth with a time of 20.89 seconds in his first round heat. With 20.95 seconds in the second round he only placed eighth in his heat, which was not enough for the semi-finals.

<text>New Zealand Steel Limited is the owner of the Glenbrook Steel Mill, a steel mill located 40 kilometres south of Auckland, in Glenbrook, New Zealand. The mill was constructed in 1968 and began producing steel products in 1969. Currently, the mill produces 650,000 tonnes of steel a year, which is either used domestically or exported. Over 90% of New Zealand&#x27;s steel requirements are produced at Glenbrook, while the remaining volume is produced by Pacific Steel, a steel recycling facility in Ōtāhuhu, Auckland. The mill is served by the Mission Bush Branch railway line, which was formerly a branch line to Waiuku. Coal and lime trains arrive daily. Steel products are also transported daily. The mill employs 1,150 full-time staff and 200 semi-permanent contractors.

New Zealand Steel is notable due to its unique utilization of ironsand as its ore. Because ironsand is a low grade ore with many contaminants, the mill&#x27;s primary plants&#x27; operations and equipment are unusual.

==History==
The west coast beaches of the North Island of New Zealand between Kaipara Harbour and Whanganui contain ironsand deposits rich in the mineral titanomagnetite. From the late 19th century to the 1950s, there were many unsuccessful attempts to smelt steel from the ironsands. A prize offered by the Taranaki Provincial Government was never claimed, mostly due to problems encountered by people attempting to process the iron sand, such as a viscous slag of titanium carbides and nitrides that forms and blocks equipment when heat is applied to the sand. In 1954, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research began investigating smelting from the ironsands. In 1959, The New Zealand Government established the NZ Steel Investigating Company under the Iron and Steel Industry Act 1959 as a vehicle for the investigations.

New Zealand Steel Limited was incorporated by the New Zealand Government in 1965. In 1967, construction started on a mill at Glenbrook. Glenbrook was chosen as the site due to the area&#x27;s proximity to the Waikato North Head ironsand mine and Huntly Power Station. Commercial operations began in 1968, with imported feed coil being used to produce steel for domestic and Pacific Island markets. The company pioneered the direct reduction process for reducing iron oxide (ironsand) into metallic iron. This culminated in the commissioning in 1970 of iron and steelmaking facilities to produce billets for domestic and export markets. Expansion continued with the commissioning of a pipe plant in 1972 and a prepainting line in 1982. Total output at this time averaged 300,000 tonnes a year.

The steel company ran at a loss during the 1970s, until 1981 when a more optimised, commercially viable method for extracting iron was implemented, leading to an expansion of the Glenbrook facilities.

In the Think Big era of New Zealand industrialisation, the mill was upgraded. In 1987, New Zealand Steel was acquired by Equiticorp. Equiticorp was bankrupted in the New Zealand sharemarket crash of 1987. In 1989 New Zealand Steel was acquired by Helenus Corporation, which consisted of Fisher &amp; Paykel, Steel &amp; Tube, ANZ Bank and BHP. In 1992, BHP took up a controlling interest with an 81% shareholding by acquiring the shares of Fisher &amp; Paykel and Steel &amp; Tube. The company was initially renamed BHP New Zealand Steel Limited, then in 2002 was renamed New Zealand Steel when BHP Steel was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange as BlueScope.

On 21 May 2023, Prime Minister Chris Hipkins announced that the New Zealand Government would provide funding of up to $140 million for an initiative to halve the consumption of coal at the Glenbrook plant and reduce carbon emissions. The project involves installation of an electric arc furnace to replace coal as the heat source for recycling scrap metal.

==The ore==
The ironsand ore is mined at an opencast mine at Waikato North Head. The ironsand is then mixed to form a slurry and transported to the mill by an 18 kilometre long pipeline. Approximately, 1.2 million tonnes of ironsand ore are delivered to the mill annually. The area is estimated to contain over a billion tonnes.

==The processes==
Glenbrook&#x27;s iron plant contains four multiple hearth furnaces, four rotary kilns, and two melters. The kilns directly reduce the ore to metallic iron. This process is unusual as most mills use blast furnaces for the reduction process.

In the steelmaking plant, vanadium recovery and removal is done due to the high vanadium content of the ironsand ore. The sand also contains aluminium, manganese and titanium. Oxidation of the molten metal and contaminants is achieved by a basic oxygen steelmaking facility. The process used in the converter is the second unusual piece of equipment: oxygen is blown on both top and bottom of the converter (Klöckner Oxygen Blown Maxhütte process, or KOBM converter), whereas oxygen is only blasted at the top of the converter in most steelmaking plants.

<text>The Aerocar IMP (for Independently Made Plane) was an unconventional light aircraft designed by Moulton Taylor and marketed for homebuilding. The IMP and its various derivatives were developed by Taylor&#x27;s Aerocar business after he had already established himself in the homebuilt market with the Coot amphibian, and at the time of the energy crisis in the United States, were designed to be economical to build and operate.

The IMP was unconventional in configuration in having a pusher propeller powered by a long driveshaft from an engine mounted midway within the fuselage of the aircraft. This provided an aerodynamic advantage over more traditional pusher arrangements by allowing greater streamlining of the fuselage – giving the IMP the appearance of an elongated teardrop. The aircraft&#x27;s most visually striking feature, however, is its inverted V-tail.

Originally designed as a four-seat aircraft, the original IMP design proved to be too complex and expensive for the market that Taylor was aiming for, and although it was awarded a type certification by the FAA, development was abandoned in favour of scaled-down, single-seat version dubbed the Mini-IMP.

<text>The Aerocar Mini-IMP (Independently Made Plane) is a light aircraft designed by Moulton Taylor and marketed for homebuilding by Aerocar International. It is a scaled-down derivative of his original Aerocar IMP design. A two-seat version called the Bullet was also built. The Mini-IMP follows the same unconventional layout as its larger predecessor, with a center mounted engine, long driveshaft to a tail propeller, and inverted-V rudder/elevators.

The aircraft is available in the form of plans for amateur construction. Following Taylor&#x27;s death, the plans and licensing for the Mini-IMP have been marketed by the Mini-IMP Aircraft Company of Weatherford, Texas.

==Design and development==
The aircraft features a cantilever high-wing, a single-seat enclosed cockpit, fixed or retractable tricycle landing gear or conventional landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration.

The aircraft is made from riveted aluminum sheet. Its span wing is mounted well behind the pilot and employs a NASA GA(PC)-1 airfoil. The engine is mounted behind the pilot&#x27;s seat driving the propeller through an extension shaft. Engines used include the Volkswagen air-cooled engine four-stroke.

Taylor claimed the Mini-IMP was not an original design, but an updated version of the 1912 Edson Fessenden Gallaudet Bullet, a design that was capable of 110 mph in the earliest days of flight.

In the late 1970s inquiries were made concerning a military version of the Mini-IMP, skinned with Kevlar, armed with two 7.62-millimeter machine guns, and with room in the baggage compartment for a considerable quantity of ammunition. Nothing came of the proposal.

<text>Great Portland Street is a road in the West End of London which links Oxford Street with the A501 Marylebone Road. A commercial street, it divides Fitzrovia, to the east, from Marylebone to the west. It delineates areas with contrasting identities, the west at strongest in grandiose Portland Place and Harley Street, the east at strongest in artists&#x27; and independent businesses of Fitzrovia. 

==Overview==

Long sections of Great Portland Street fall in two Westminster City Council conservation areas, named after Harley Street and East Marylebone. 

The street was gradually developed by a senior branch of the Cavendish-Bentinck family, the Dukes of Portland, who owned most of the eastern half of Marylebone in the 18th and 19th centuries. It was first rated as John Street in 1726.

Great Portland Street then went on to have some prominence with the arts, the motor, garment and broadcast industries.

A campaign to add to its trees began in 2009.

==Historic influences==
Different owners and interests influenced development; these shaped the street&#x27;s layout and character. Edward Harley – Earl of Oxford and Mortimer, who married Lady Henrietta Cavendish – was responsible for the development of the Portland Estate, building up Cavendish Square in 1717 then the rest of its land to the north and east. Great Portland stresses the descent of the land and buildings through Dukes&#x27; successive ownerships. Many local street names reflect their overall ownership, albeit less obviously.

Development up to Great Titchfield Street was through the Portland Estate, competing against adjoining estates. The Berners family owned land to the east; they developed Wells Street and Rathbone Place in the mid-18th century. At the same time the Middlesex Hospital expanded on land on a 99-year lease around Mortimer Street, encroaching on Riding House and Cleveland Streets. These unrelated developers with different designs explains the asymmetrical street grid using the street as a basis; from the street many others start or end.

Great Portland Street runs straight, north-south. The layout, combined with its width and the concentration of shops along its length, means it has for a long time been a local centre and thoroughfare, connecting the residential areas around Regent&#x27;s Park with the West End. It has also resulted in it becoming a divider, emphasising the contrasting areas to either side. To the east, are artistic areas such as Fitzrovia, which have historically been less well-to-do than the west, with its grand parade of Portland Place, residential areas for the gentry, and doctors and medical institutions on Harley Street.

==Development and redevelopment==

Development of the estate was gradual but particularly so on Great Portland Street. This had an effect during its redevelopment in the late-19th/early-20th centuries when rebuilding was dictated by the expiration of individual 99-year leases, and is evident in the buildings in existence today.

The most coherent element to the architecture is the predominance of Edwardian buildings to the north and Victorian buildings towards Oxford Street, particularly noticeable when there has been occasional consolidation of plots, leading to consistent façades above street level such as in the block between Clipstone and Carburton Streets. The trend of period groupings is another result of the slowness of the first development. As buildings in the south were built earlier than those in the north, their leases expired earlier, setting off a wave of redevelopment which meant that rebuilding in the south took place in the late-Victorian era, whilst that in the north was delayed until the Edwardian period.

The Blitz made it necessary for further re-building after the war, although the damage incurred along the street was not particularly extensive so there are few modern buildings, and although the aesthetic today is a jumble of architectural styles and eras, the overall feel is that of an historic street.

===Development over time===
Maps from close to the outset of building help to identify the street&#x27;s changes.

==== 1746 (John Rocque&#x27;s Map) ====
:The southern end of Great Portland Street (then shown as Portland Street) has been built as part of the development begun by Edward Harley and Lady Cavendish. With the exception of small villages at Mary Le Bone and Tottenham Court, the rest of the area to the north of Oxford Street is largely open fields. To the south, the street patterns which were the inspiration for the new development of formal squares and streets can be seen in places such as Soho Square.

==== 1793 (Richard Horwood&#x27;s Map) ====

:The street pattern of the whole area has been laid out almost exactly as it is today, with the appearance of Marylebone Road providing the northern boundary to the grid. Notable differences are the presence of Foley House where Langham Place is today, and Portland Place shown in its original design as a close of grand houses. Also, the line of Great Portland Street has been established but the buildings at the northern end have not been built, a curious gap as the streets parallel have largely been built up at this stage. One other curiosity in the planning of Great Portland Street, which still remains today, is its abrupt widening just north of Clipstone Street.

:The impetus for the social pattern of affluence to the west and poverty to the east which has long-defined the area has been established with the houses along Portland Place and west of there being much larger than those to the east. These houses, clearly designed for the gentry have their own individual gardens and frequently mews, whilst the houses along Great Portland Street and the surrounding streets are noticeably smaller and would have accommodated the working classes involved in local trades.

==== 1827 (Christopher Greenwood&#x27;s Map) ====

:Great Portland Street&#x27;s buildings are still not complete at the northern end, although the rest of the area&#x27;s present-day street pattern is now completely in place. This includes the appearance of Park Crescent and the transformation of Portland Place into a grand parade with the disappearance of Foley House. These two prominent features were part of Nash&#x27;s scheme for the Prince Regent when the land to the north was returned to the Crown. This included the laying out of Regent&#x27;s Park, which had previously remained an area of fields, and the creation of a &#x27;royal mile&#x27;, beginning at Park Crescent and leading down to Carlton House in the south.

==== 1870 (Ordnance Survey Map) ====
:The whole street has been built up and is now united as one street under the name of Great Portland Street whereas previously it had gone by the name of John Street in the few blocks before Oxford Street and Portland Road at the north end. However, the slight widening of the street which used to mark the beginning of Portland Road is still visible at the corner of Weymouth Street. This feature probably would have contributed to the very northern end of the street being more heavily trafficked in comparison to the middle stretch, as is still the case today.

:There are signs of the demolition and rebuilding which was beginning to occur in this period and which continued through into the early years of the 20th century. The most noticeable evidence of this on the map is the large gap on the west side between Weymouth and New Cavendish Streets, where the modern synagogue is today. Otherwise, the street pattern and buildings remain largely the same in their layout.

==== 1889 (Booth&#x27;s Poverty Map) ====

:Booth&#x27;s map shows Great Portland Street and the immediately parallel streets as middle-class/well-to-do whilst the accompanying notes describe it as a &quot;mixed st., shops, restaurants, many curio and antique shops, many doubtful massage establishments&quot;. This vibrant description indicates that it is already something of a local centre, with a distinct catchment area made up of those &quot;comfortable&quot; households in the neighbouring streets. The mixed nature of the street described by Booth is not surprising given the general picture this map gives. The movement from &#x27;wealthy&#x27; to &#x27;poor&#x27; – and even some &#x27;very poor&#x27; households – is striking as one travels west to east from Harley Street and Portland Place to Great Titchfield Street and beyond.

==== 1916 (Ordnance Survey Map) ====

:The great redevelopment of this street has largely come to an end by this time. There are slight changes in some of the plots along the street, showing the further rebuilding and consolidation which had taken place in the previous few decades but otherwise, this street and its surrounding streets remain unchanged in their layout.

==== 1945 (London Council Bomb Damage Maps) ====

:A few buildings along Great Portland Street were destroyed by bombing which explains some of the modern developments such as the synagogue opposite Clipstone Street, which was originally built in the late 19th century but damaged beyond repair in the Blitz. The street was cited in 28 separate A.R.P. bomb incident reports dated between September 1940 and 1944. Despite this, much of the street escaped with little or no damage although there was some bad damage nearby in Langham Place and further east around Fitzrovia, with several buildings in those areas being completely destroyed or requiring demolition.

==Broadcasters and media entities==

The BBC Trust was based at №180 until 2017 BBC Radio 1&#x27;s headquarters were also on Great Portland Street in Yalding House until 2012. Similarly, Radio 2 and 6 Music were also on the street at № 99 (Wogan House) until 2024. Virgin Media (including Virgin Mobile) was based at № 160 Great Portland Street, which also at one time housed UKTV, Virgin Media Television and IDS during Virgin&#x27;s presence on the street. Discovery Channel Europe and Mac 7 TV, among some other TV channels that were also based here. Double Negative (VFX), a British full-service motion picture company, is located on the Great Portland Street.

==Motor cars==

Great Portland Street, also known as &quot;Motor Row&quot;, was a primary street for cars and related accessories in the early years of the 20th century. The Benz Motor dealership was located in the very early 20th century on the street at its intersection with Weymouth Street where Villandry Restaurant was located (now Sixes Cricket). By the mid-Twenties Great Portland Street had become a dominant motor vehicle trading venue—with no less than 33 showrooms located along the street. Other manufacturers, including the big names of Vauxhall, Jaguar, Austin, Auto-Union DKW, and the DORT Motor Company were also represented on the street in the first decades of the last century. Other manufacturers with offices and or showrooms on Great Portland Street included Beardmore Motors Limited as well as the Le Zebre, Maxwell, Morgan Motor and Phoenix Car companies. The Indian Motorcycle Company opened its showroom at №s 168-202 in 1908.

Coach builders in Great Portland Street were a crucial prerequisite for the development of the motor trade on the street. They were represented by the Carlton Carriage Co; and well-established firms included light car specialists Mebes &amp; Mebes, founded in 1893 amongst numerous others.

Speedometer House, built in 1913 at №179, was a London motor industry landmark. Its top two floors were devoted to the production of Smiths speedometers, gauges and other instruments, while the basement was given over to the production of carburettors. John Donald &quot;Jack&quot; Barclay, after leaving the Royal Flying Corps at the end of the First World War, set up the Barclay &amp; Wyse partnership at №91 in 1922 to sell Vauxhall automobiles. The head offices of the UK&#x27;s Retail Motor Industry Federation was located at №201 until 2024.

==The arts==
The German composers Felix Mendelssohn (1809–1847) and Carl Maria von Weber (1786–1826) both lived and worked on Great Portland Street. №103 is cited as one of &quot;London&#x27;s 50 Outstanding Classical Music Landmarks&quot; because Felix Mendelssohn lodged there during the premiere of Fingal&#x27;s Cave. Other notables living on the street include James Boswell, 9th Laird of Auchinleck, biographer at №122, Leigh Hunt the essayist and poet at №98, and the artist David Wilkie at №117 (1808–09). Sir Charles Barry, the architect, lived at №94 Great Portland Street from 1828 to 1841.

Pagani&#x27;s restaurant, with its art nouveau frontage by Beresford Pite, was a favourite gathering place for many artists and musicians. This was perhaps due in part to the restaurant&#x27;s proximity to Queen&#x27;s Hall on Langham Place. Its &quot;Artist Room&quot; walls were decorated by over 5,000 notes and signatures of its many important artists of the period who included Paderewski, Puccini, Chaminade, Chevalier, Calvé, Piatti, Plançon, De Lucia, Melba, Menpes, Tosti, Sarah Bernhardt, Whistler amongst numerous others. Pagani&#x27;s was bombed during the Blitz but survived for a time after the war. It had first opened in 1871. The Philharmonic Hall was erected on the site of the new St. James Hall on Great Portland Street in 1907. Sir Ernest Shackleton appeared in person there in 1920 when he presented a film of his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. Some of the artistic and entertainment energy of the area dissipated after Queen&#x27;s Hall was destroyed by incendiary bombs in May 1941.

==Clothing trade==
Great Portland Street still hints at its past when it was a major centre for London&#x27;s women&#x27;s clothing industry. During the late 1950 and 1960s, garment related businesses could be found all along the length of the street.

The clothing trade took to this street, setting up small stock and workrooms in the early 1900s. Over time, these grew into larger showrooms which represented the English textile industry to many West End stores. The sector&#x27;s activities were most pronounced where the street intersects with Mortimer Street and Margaret Street. Its proximity to buying officers working for the big stores on Oxford Street gave businesses in the area a competitive edge.

The sector&#x27;s local presence declined in the late 1970-80s with the disappearance of both the UK&#x27;s independent retailer and the British textile industry. The growing dominance of UK chain stores, with their requirement for supply chain efficiencies from foreign low-cost suppliers, meant that new orders by-passed the showrooms and manufacturer&#x27;s agents on the street and its vicinity.

Major names of the garment industry associated with the street include Shubette of London, Coppernob, Alfred Young, Hildebrand and French Connection. The sector is now mainly represented on the street by a few garment importers.

==Buildings and companies==
The street is split among Westminster Council&#x27;s Harley Street Conservation and East Marylebone Conservation Areas. The street has a commercial character with a majority of its buildings dating from the late Victorian or Edwardian period. The street has four Grade II listed buildings, the most common category:

*№78/80 - in free Flemish-Jacobean style built in 1904
*№94 (fronts east side) - of the late 18th Century
*№126 (fronts east side) - in free Queen Anne style with Baroque accents built 1898
*Great Portland Street Underground Station, W1 - cream, faience tile faced with slate mansard roof - built 1912

Most of the remaining structures on Great Portland Street have been designated as &#x27;Unlisted Buildings of Merit&#x27; by Westminster.
;Other buildings of note
The Portland Hospital for Women and Children (at first, from 1858, the Ami Portland Hospital for the same), at №s 205-209.

The street has larger Edwardian buildings in the Marylebone Conservation Area such as №s 160-180; №206; and №228 (The Armitage). The latter building was the headquarters of the Royal National Institute of Blind People from 1914 to 2002.

№s45-49 host the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

№229 houses International Students House, London, where the John F. Kennedy memorial bust adorns the lobby.

==Transport==

The street is served at the northern end by Great Portland Street station and at the southern end by Oxford Circus station.

Great Portland Street station opened as Portland Road on 10 January 1863 as a station on London&#x27;s then Metropolitan Railway. The station was renamed Great Portland Street in March 1917. The present station building, designed by Charles Clark, is of 1930 date and is constructed from cream faience tile with a slate mansard roof.

Regent&#x27;s Park tube station is also close to the north end of the street. Buses numbered 88, 18, 27, 30, 205, 189, 3, 12 and 55 stop on or within a close distance of the road.

<text>Idrissa Sanou (born June 12, 1977) is a Burkinabé athlete specializing in the 100 metres. Sanou holds the national records in both 100 metres, 200 metres and 4 x 100 metres relay.

Sanou won a bronze medal at the 2002 African Championships in Radès, and a silver medal two years later in Brazzaville. Participating in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, he achieved fourth place in his 100 metres heat, thus qualifying on due to time to the second round where he lost the race. He finished seventh at the 2006 African Championships and fourth at the 2008 African Championships. Sanou represented Burkina Faso at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He competed at the 100 metres sprint and placed 6th in his heat without advancing to the second round. He ran the distance in a time of 10.63 seconds.

<doc id="1211293" wikidata="Q4162504" url="?curid=1211293" title="Legal system of Macau">
<text>Macau law is broadly based on Portuguese law, and therefore part of the civil law tradition of continental European legal systems. Portuguese law is itself highly influenced by German law. However, many other influences are present, including Chinese law, Italian law, and some narrow aspects of common law.

Macau&#x27;s legal code is written in Portuguese; therefore law students at University of Macau take their classes in Portuguese.

==Constitutional law==
The apex of the legal system is the Basic Law of the Macau SAR, a Chinese law approved in accordance with and due to the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau (an international treaty that is officially deposited at the UN) and with article 31 of the Constitution of the PRC. Within Macau, the Basic Law has constitutional rank. The Basic Law of Macau is modelled upon the Basic Law of Hong Kong, although it is not totally equal, as it namely is influenced by the Portuguese Constitution in some points as, for example, in some norms concerning fundamental rights. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights applies in Macau.

==The transfer of power==
The legal system of Macau was not substantially modified in 1999, as a result of the transfer of power from Portugal to the PRC, given that there is a principle of continuity of the pre-existing legal system, according to which all sources in force prior to the transfer of sovereignty continued to apply, with some minor exceptions that were specified in December 1999.

==Judicial system==
The courts of the Macau SAR are structured in three levels and have final power of adjudication, except in very narrow areas. The Court of Final Appeal has three judges, and the Court of Second Instance has five judges. Trial by jury is foreseen in the law, but is not used.

Prior to 1991, Macau judicial system was a sub-judiciary district (&quot;Comarca de Macau&quot;) of the judicial framework of the Portuguese legal system and was affiliated to the Judiciary District of Lisbon (&quot;Distrito Judicial de Lisboa&quot;).

By 2018 none of the criminal court judges were Portuguese. In 2018 Reuters stated: &quot;Courts have largely stopped providing Portuguese translations.&quot;

==High Court==

The Higher Court of Justice (Superior Court of Justice) of Macau replaced the role of Court of Appeal of the Judiciary District of Lisbon. This highest court would be replaced by the current Court of Appeal in 1999.

The courts prior to the handover in 1999:

* Superior Council of Magistrates
* Superior Council of Public Prosecutors
* Court of Justice of Macau
* Criminal Preliminary Hearing Court of Macau
* Administrative Court of Macau
* Constitutional Court of the Republic of Portugal
* Supreme Administrative Court of the Republic of Portugal
* Supreme Court of Justice of the Republic of Portugal
* Audit Court of the Republic of Portugal

The courts of Macau consist of:

* Court of Final Appeal – 終審法院/Tribunal de Ultima Instância
* Court of General Competence
* Administrative Court (Tribunal Administrativo)
* Criminal Preliminary Hearing Court – (Juizos de Instrução Criminal)
* Audit Court
* Higher Court of Justice
* Judiciary Council of Macau (Tribunal Judicial de Base)
* Court of Second Instance or Court of Appeal (Tribunal de Segunda Instância)
* Court of First Instance (Tribunais de Primeira Instância)
* Primary Court of Macau – 初級法院/(Tribunal Judícial de Base)
* Judiciary Council of Macau (Conselho dos Magistrados Judíciais)

==Macau as a civil law legal system==
Macau is typically a civil law legal system, in that legislation is the main source of law and case law, while clearly relevant, is not a major source of law. Macau has the five &#x27;classic&#x27; codifications: the Civil Code, the Commercial Code, the Civil Procedure Code, the Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code. In addition, there are a number of other smaller codifications (e.g., in the field of administrative law).

==Private law==
Private law in Macau is basically codified in two separate codes: the 1999 Civil Code and the 1999 Commercial code. A number of other pieces of legislation, such as the law on standard contract terms, are also of importance. The Commercial Code has been translated into English and is freely available in the website of the Macau Official Printing House (see link below). For a partial translation of the Civil Code, see the bibliography below.

==Legal education==
The Faculty of Law of the University of Macau was created in the late 1980s and currently offers law degrees and master programmes conducted in Chinese and Portuguese languages. It also offers two master and postgraduate programmes in English, one in EU, international and comparative law, and the other in international business law . In addition, it offers PhD programs in law.

==Legal Department==
The Public Prosecutions Office (檢察院; Ministério Público) is the judicial authority of Macau. It is led by a prosecutor general and assisted by an assistant-prosecutor general. Day to day legal activities are performed by general prosecutors.

==Gaming law==
Macau gaming law is discussed in a separate entry.

==Law field employees==
In 2018 Macau had 49 jurists, with ten percent being Portuguese. Reuters stated in 2018 that according to &quot;experts&quot;, &quot;the government was increasingly hiring only Chinese for jobs as lawyers, advisers and jurists.&quot;

<text>The Aerocar Micro-IMP was a light sportsplane developed from the successful Mini-IMP homebuilt. Designed by Moulton Taylor and Jerry Holcomb in 1978, it was finished in 1981 and demonstrated at Oshkosh the following year.

A unique feature of the aircraft was that it was built out of fibreglass-reinforced paper – it was intended that the aircraft &quot;kit&quot; would be marketed printed on paper. The builder would cut out the parts and laminate them between fibreglass mats to build up the structure of the aircraft.

The Micro-IMP was ultimately a disappointment because its powerplant (taken from the Citroën 2CV) proved unsuitable, and a projected higher-powered version of the engine did not eventually become available. Holcomb later built a refined version with a different powerplant as the Ultra-IMP.

The river flows through the municipal territories of Horní Brusnice, Pecka, Borek, Tetín, Miletín, Rohoznice, Červená Třemešná, Hořice, Jeřice, Cerekvice nad Bystřicí, Hněvčeves, Benátky, Sovětice, Sadová, Dohalice, Mžany, Mokrovousy, Třesovice, Nechanice, Kunčice, Boharyně, Puchlovice, Roudnice, Kratonohy, Kosičky, Kosice, Písek, Nové Město and Chlumec nad Cidlinou.

==Bodies of water==
There are 377 bodies of water in the basin area. The largest of them is the Třesický pond with an area of . There are no fishponds or reservoirs built directly on the Bystřice.

==Protection of nature==

A survey conducted in 2010 showed that the Bystřice River was inhabited by a total of 21 species of aquatic molluscs, out of which 11 were gastropods and the remaining 10 were bivalves. Most of the recorded species were common ones. Although previous researches had shown the river to have an even higher number of species, the most notable find of the research in 2010 was the increase in the alien New Zealand mud snail and European physa species. On the other hand, there was also the discovery of the presence of the endangered thick shelled river mussel, with an increased population density of the species as compared to a few years ago. Due to the presence of the thick shelled river mussel, the river bed between Hořice and Boharyně is protected as a nature monument. It has an area of .

The river in the valley to the west of Hořice, along with its immediate surroundings, is protected as the &quot;Údolí Bystřice&quot; nature monument. It has an area of . The reason for the protection is the natural flow of the river, riparian vegetation and hygrophilous meadows with the occurrence of protected species of plants and animals.

The river valley on its upper course is protected as the &quot;Kalské údolí&quot; nature monument. It has an area of and the reasons for protection are the same as in the case of Údolí Bystřice.

<text>The Berkeley Carroll School is a coed independent college prep school in New York City. Located in Park Slope, Brooklyn, it has a Lower School (preK – grade 4), Middle School (grades 5–8) and Upper School (grades 9–12).

== History ==

The Berkeley Carroll School was officially chartered by the New York state government on April 12, 1886, as a school for &quot;the education of young ladies&quot; under the name Berkeley Institute. Within a decade, boys were being admitted to the kindergarten through fourth grade. The school went fully co-educational in 1974.

== Academics ==
The school has three educational divisions, from preschool through high school. The Lower School focuses on the fundamentals of reading, writing, math, science, technology, the arts, and social studies. In 2012, the Lower School started a Spanish partial-immersion program, in which all classes are partially taught in Spanish to help students become comfortable hearing and speaking Spanish at an early age.

The Middle School has an academic program that includes science, humanities, math, physical education, the arts, Spanish, and speech and debate. Every fifth and sixth grader learns to play a wind and/or string instrument and performs in concerts for the community. In 2016, the Middle School math team (the Quantifyin&#x27; Lions) won the Brooklyn MathCounts competition and the Middle and Upper School speech &amp; debate teams won many awards at the state and local level.

In the Upper School, academic programs include English, science, math, history, computer science, the arts, world language, and speech and debate. Additionally, the Upper School has partnerships with NYU&#x27;s Tandon School of Engineering, which provides engineering classes for Berkeley Carroll students, and Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s Center for Talented Youth, which offers students online Mandarin and Arabic courses.

==Athletics==
The school is a member of the New York State Association of Independent Schools Athletic Association. The 2006–2007 girls varsity basketball team beat Dwight to become the champions of the ACIS (Athletic Conference of Independent Schools) league. On May 20, 2009, Berkeley Carroll won its first NYSAISAA baseball title, beating defending state champion Poly Prep 4–1.

Berkeley Carroll promotes fitness, sportsmanship, leadership, and responsibility through their athletic programs. Their athletic facilities include a 75-foot swimming pool, two full-size gyms, a mezzanine area for fitness and strength-training, and two play yards. 82% of Middle School students and 72% of Upper School students play a sport.

Interscholastic sports competition begins in 7th grade; the school fields more than 40 varsity and JV teams over three seasons including: 
*Basketball
*Baseball
*Soccer
*Volleyball
*Swimming
*Cross Country
*Tennis
*Track
*Softball
*Ultimate Frisbee
*Flag Football

The school belongs to three competitive leagues at the Upper School level: ACIS, PSAA and AAIS. Some of Berkeley Carroll peer institutions are Saint Ann&#x27;s, Packer Collegiate, Poly Prep, Brooklyn Friends, Friends Seminary, Horace Mann, Spence, Brearley, Dalton and others.

Lower and Middle School students have intramural sports programs including:
*Tennis
*Fencing
*Swimming
*Soccer
*Judo
*Bowling
*Gymnastics

==Recognition==
Berkeley Carroll was named a School of the Future by the National Association of Independent Schools in 2012.

In 2016, &quot;New York Magazine&quot; called Berkeley Carroll &quot;the Harvard of Brooklyn&#x27;s K-12 institutions.&quot;

Berkeley Carroll&#x27;s STEAM initiative and focus on the role of technology in education has received national attention. In 2016, Mashable called its visit to a sixth grade coding class “a riveting experience” and in 2014, &quot;The New York Times&quot; quoted Middle School Director Jim Shapiro on helping students unplug occasionally.

The GRAMMY Foundation chose Berkeley Carroll Arts Director Peter Holsberg as the only NYC semifinalist for its 2016 Music Educator Award.

<doc id="1211313" wikidata="Q689723" url="?curid=1211313" title="Army Combat Uniform">
<text>The Army Combat Uniform (ACU) is the current combat uniform worn by the United States Army, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Space Force and some elements of the U.S. Coast Guard. Within the Air Force and Space Force, it is referred to as the OCP ([[Operational Camouflage Pattern]]) Uniform, rather than the Army Combat Uniform.

First unveiled in June 2004, it is the successor to the Battle Dress Uniform (BDU) and Desert Camouflage Uniform (DCU) worn from the 1980s and 1990s through to the mid-2000s, respectively. It is also the successor to the Airman Battle Uniform for the U.S. Air Force. Initially, it was made with the Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), but due to its ineffectiveness it was replaced by the Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP). 

==History==
===Development===
In early 2004, some U.S. Army soldiers in Iraq were issued the &quot;Close Combat Uniform&quot;, a variant of the Desert Camouflage Uniform (DCU) that featured new features such as shoulder pockets affixed with hook-and-loop fasteners, chest-worn rank insignia, and a new collar. The experimental features used on the CCU were eventually incorporated into the ACU, which was publicly announced in June 2004.

===Initial fielding===
The process of replacing the U.S. Army&#x27;s BDUs and DCUs with the ACU was set to begin in April 2005. However, the fielding process began two months earlier through the Rapid Fielding Initiative. Soldiers from the Georgia Army National Guard&#x27;s 48th Infantry Brigade Combat Team were the first in the U.S. Army to receive the ACU, subsequently deploying with them into Iraq in May 2005. Early ACUs can be distinguished by OG-green name tapes, combat and skill badges, and shoulder sleeve insignia. Due to the increased use of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), a flame-resist version of the ACU was developed for soldiers deploying overseas, especially to Iraq.

===Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP)===
The ACU originally used the Universal Camouflage Pattern (UCP), which used a pixelated pattern of tan, gray and green (Desert Sand 500, Urban Gray 501 and Foliage Green 502) and was intended to work in desert, woodland, and urban environments. In 2010, the ACU received some improvements to pockets and such.

For uniforms, the pattern was fully phased out and replaced by the Operational Camouflage Pattern on 30 September 2019, though UCP remains in service in limited capacities such as on some cold weather overgear and older body armor.

===Operation Enduring Freedom Pattern (MultiCam)===

Beginning in late 2010 U.S. Army soldiers deployed to Afghanistan (starting with the 173rd Airborne Brigade) were issued ACUs made in Crye Precision&#x27;s MultiCam pattern, referred to by the army as the Operation Enduring Freedom Pattern (OEF, OEF-CP, or OCP), which was far more effective for use in Afghanistan&#x27;s terrain. The flame-retardant variants of the uniforms are designed to prevent third-degree burns, along with up to thirty percent of second degree burns. Additionally, all uniforms are treated with the chemical permethrin to help protect soldiers from ticks and insects. Some U.S. Army soldiers during the latter stages of the Iraq War also wore the OEF-patterned ACU; some were seen wearing them as late as December 2011, when the United States withdrew its military forces from the country at the end of the war. The MultiCam-patterned ACUs were retired in 2019 with the UCP-patterned ones.

===Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP)===

In May 2014, the Army unofficially announced that the Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP) would replace UCP on the ACU. The original &quot;Scorpion&quot; pattern was developed at United States Army Soldier Systems Center by Crye Precision in 2002 for the Objective Force Warrior program. Crye later modified and trademarked their version of the pattern as MultiCam, which was selected for use by U.S. soldiers and airmen in Afghanistan in 2010 as the Operation Enduring Freedom Pattern. After talks to officially adopt MultiCam broke down over costs in late 2013, the Army began experimenting with the original Scorpion pattern, creating a variant code named &quot;Scorpion W2&quot;. The pattern resembles MultiCam with muted greens, light beige, and dark brown colors, but uses fewer beige and brown patches and no vertical twig and branch elements. On 31 July 2014, the Army formally announced that the pattern would begin being issued in uniforms in summer 2015. The official name is intended to emphasize its use beyond Afghanistan to all combatant commands. The OCP pattern fully replaced the UCP pattern on the ACU by 1 October 2019. ACUs printed in OCP first became available for purchase on 1 July 2015, with deployed soldiers already being issued uniforms and equipment in the new pattern.

The U.S. Air Force has also adopted the ACU, which they call the OCP uniform, from 2018 onward, and it replaced the Airman Battle Uniform by April 2021. The Air Force version differs only in name tapes and rank being embroidered in spice brown thread instead of black. The U.S. Space Force has also adopted the OCP Uniform, but with blue thread for ranks and tapes.

==Components==
===Jacket===
The ACU jacket originally used hook-and-loop fasteners, also known by the genericized trademark Velcro, on its sleeve pockets, and to secure attachments such as name tapes, rank insignia, shoulder patches and tabs, as well as recognition devices like the U.S. flag patch and the infrared (IR) tab. Originally only pin-on skill badges were authorized for wear on the ACU, with no more than five at any one time, from 2006 until 2011.

In the summer of 2011, regulations were changed to allow for wearing of sew-on embroidered skill badges, similar in cut to the kind worn on the Battle Dress Uniform (BDU). The five-badge limit remained in effect, and there could be no mixing of sew-on and pin-on badges. At the same time, the branch tape, name tapes, and rank insignia could be sewn-on at the wearers preference. Skill tabs, such as the President&#x27;s Hundred Tab, Special Forces, Ranger, and Sapper are worn on the left sleeve pocket flap, and are subject to a three-tab-only rule. A tab that is an integral part of a unit patch, such as the &quot;Mountain&quot; or &quot;Airborne&quot; tab, is not counted against the rule. The U.S. Army Chaplain insignia is the only authorized army branch insignia to be worn on the ACU. It is centered  inch above the right name tape. The insignia may be the metal pin-on variety or the black embroidered insignia on digitized fabric with Velcro fasteners.

Near Infrared (NIR) Signature Management Technology is incorporated to minimize the infrared silhouette. Permanent IR IFF squares are sewn to each shoulder to help identify friendly personnel when night vision devices are used, and are protected by Velcro tabs in garrison or when not in use. Three U.S. flag insignia are authorized for wear with the ACU: full-color, full-color infrared, and subdued infrared. The U.S. flag insignia is worn on the right shoulder pocket flap of the ACU coat. The subdued version is only worn as directed under tactical or field conditions in the Army, while the Air Force only authorizes the subdued flag. Subdued shoulder sleeve insignia are worn. The flag&#x27;s stars appear in the top right as a symbolic gesture; the insignia &quot;flies&quot; in that direction because the soldier is moving forward and not retreating.

The jacket&#x27;s Mandarin collar was intended to be worn up in combat to fit with the Interceptor body armor outer tactical vest (OTV) to keep out debris, and worn in the down position otherwise. With the change of pattern to OCP, the Velcro tab that closed the Mandarin collar was removed, along with other Velcro closures. The front closure is zippered and reinforced with Velcro, designed for use with OTV. The tilted chest pockets, cuffs, and elbow pad insert pockets also utilize hook-and-loop closure. There is a three slot pen pocket on the left arm of the jacket, and blouse bellows for increased mobility. The jacket is worn so that its bottom is between the bottom of the pocket and the top of the cargo pocket. In the field, the jacket may be replaced by the flame resistant Army Combat Shirt when worn directly under the IOTV.

===Trousers===
The ACU trousers (or ACU pants) are worn with a two-inch nylon web belt, and feature Velcro pouches for knee pad inserts, two forward-tilted thigh storage pockets with elastic drawstring and Velcro for closure during movement, and two calf storage pockets one on each pant leg with a Velcro closure. ACU trousers with flame resistant materials are being issued for use in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The updates to the ACU trousers in late 2010 included removal of Velcro fasteners from forward-tilted thigh cargo pocket flaps which were replaced with 3 buttons. This change was introduced gradually from 2009 onward and is now in full effect. Two buttons are standard (same function as on BDU trouser cargo pockets), while the third button located at the very end of the pocket can be used to allow for more load and extra volume in cargo pockets. On the small calf pockets the 3-piece Velcro (2 square hook on pocket and one rectangular loop patch on the flap) have been replaced with a single button in 2012. Buttons were re-introduced and replaced Velcro on pockets after numerous complaints from soldiers in the field.

The belt loops are of new design. The width has doubled, and there are now 8 of them compared to 7 in the past. The waist adjustment cord has been removed and replaced by the Velcro waistband fine-adjusters, one at each hip. Instead of a knee pocket which could only accommodate soft knee inserts in the past, the knee area now features multi-layered comprehensive design which allows external hard-type knee pads to be inserted and secured. Back of the knee area has Velcro hook and loop patches to further secure knee inserts around the knee area. Cuffs at the bottom of the trousers do not use drawstrings anymore for blousing; those have been again replaced by the Velcro cuff adjusters. Further changes as part of the transition to OCP removed the pockets for insertable knee pads altogether, along with the replacement of more Velcro with buttons. To be able to differentiate the Fire-Retardant ACU (FRACU) from the regular ACU at a distance, a small one-square-inch tan patch is affixed to the left sleeve cuff on the jacket and the middle of the left cargo pocket flap on the trousers.

===Headgear===

Typically, the ACU is worn with the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH), a patrol cap, or a boonie hat and/or fleece cap as appropriate in winter months. The patrol cap is a kepi-styled straight-sided, flat-topped soft cap, with a double thick bill and internal pocket. When in garrison, the maroon, tan, brown, and green berets may be worn by paratroopers, rangers, advisors, and special forces respectively. The green micro fleece cap is authorized for field and garrison use outside of unit PT, per local command. A name tape is worn on the back of the patrol cap. Sew-on rank is recommended but pin-on rank is authorized on the ACU Patrol Cap and ACU Boonie Hat. The MICH (Modular Integrated Communications Helmet) Camouflage cover rank must be sewn on if worn but is often not used as the night vision device mount would obstruct it.

===T-shirt===
The ACU&#x27;s UCP variant was typically worn with a moisture-wicking sand colored T-shirt. A Tan 499 T-shirt was authorized with the ACU&#x27;s OCP variant and became the sole authorized T-shirt upon completion of the full transition to OCP in 2019. A flame-resistant green shirt is authorized for the Army Aircrew Combat Uniform (AACU).

===Footwear===
The UCP variant of the ACU was worn with tan Army Combat Boots and olive drab cotton socks. Commercial versions of this boot are authorized without limitation, complying with the following regulations—must be 8 to 10 inches in height, be made of tan rough side out cattle hide leather with a plain toe and tan rubber outsoles, and be without zippers, metal cleats, or side tabs. The Mountain Combat Boot is available for difficult terrain, and the Extreme Cold Vapor Barrier Boots for cold weather. As with the T-shirt, coyote brown boots are authorized with ACU-OCP and will become the sole boot authorized following the completion of the transition in 2019.

<text>Charibert II (607/617–8 April 632), a son of Clotaire II and his junior wife Sichilde, was briefly King of Aquitaine from 629 to his death, with his capital at Toulouse. There are no direct statements about when Charibert was born exactly, the only known fact being that he was &quot;a few years younger&quot; than his half-brother Dagobert. His father Clotaire evidently had a bigamous marriage (not then uncommon) and he was the offspring of the junior wife.

When his father, Clotaire II, King of the Franks, died in 629, Charibert made a bid for the kingdom of Neustria against his elder half-brother Dagobert I, who had already been king of Austrasia since 623. In the ensuing negotiations, Charibert, a minor, was represented by his uncle Brodulf, the brother of Queen Sichilde. Dagobert had Brodulf killed, but did not intercede when his half-brother took over the near-independent realm of Aquitaine. Apparently this caused no disagreement, as in 631 Charibert stood godfather to Dagobert&#x27;s son Sigebert.

Charibert&#x27;s realm included Toulouse, Cahors, Agen, Périgueux, and Saintes, to which he added his possessions in Gascony. Charibert was married to Gisela, the daughter of Amand, Ruler of the Gascons. His fighting force subdued the resistance of the Basques, until the whole Novempopulania (became Duchy of Vasconia) was under his control.

In 632, Charibert died at Blaye, Gironde and soon after that his infant son Chilperic was killed. Aquitaine passed again to Dagobert. Both Charibert and his son are buried in the early Romanesque Basilica of Saint-Romain at Blaye.

<doc id="1211321" wikidata="Q68530" url="?curid=1211321" title="Flume">
<text>A flume is a human-made channel for water, in the form of an open declined gravity chute whose walls are raised above the surrounding terrain, in contrast to a trench or ditch. Flumes are not to be confused with aqueducts, which are built to transport water; flumes use flowing water to transport materials. Flumes route water from a diversion dam or weir to a desired materiel collection location. Flumes are usually made up of wood, metal or concrete.

Many flumes took the form of wooden troughs elevated on trestles, often following the natural contours of the land. Originating as a part of a mill race, they were later used in the transportation of logs in the logging industry, known as a log flume. They were also extensively used in hydraulic mining and working placer deposits for gold, tin and other heavy minerals.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;flume&quot; comes from the Old French word &quot;flum&quot;, from the Latin &quot;flumen&quot;, meaning a river. It was formerly used for a stream, and particularly for the tail of a mill race. It is used in America for a very narrow gorge running between precipitous rocks, with a stream at the bottom, but more frequently is applied to an artificial channel of wood or other material for the diversion of a stream of water from a river for purposes of irrigation, for running a sawmill, or for various processes in the hydraulic method of gold-mining.

==Types of flumes==

===Millrace===
A diversionary flume is used to transfer water from one body to another, such as between two reservoirs.

===Log flume===

Log flumes use the flow of water to carry cut logs and timber downhill, sometimes many miles, to either a sawmill or location for further transport.

===Flow measurement flume===
Some varieties of flumes are used in measuring water flow of a larger channel. When used to measure the flow of water in open channels, a flume is defined as a specially shaped, fixed hydraulic structure that under free-flow conditions forces flow to accelerate in such a manner that the flow rate through the flume can be characterized by a level-to-flow relationship as applied to a single head (level) measurement within the flume. Acceleration is accomplished through a convergence of the sidewalls, a change in floor elevation, or a combination of the two.

Flow measurement flumes typically consist of a converging section, a throat section, and a diverging section. Not all sections, however, need to be present. In the case of the Cutthroat flume, the converging section directly joins the diverging section, resulting in a throat section of no length (hence the term &quot;Cutthroat&quot;). Other flumes omit the diverging section (Montana, USGS Portable Parshall, and HS / H / HL flumes).

Flumes offer distinct advantages over sharp-crested weirs: 
*For the same control width, the head loss for a flume is about one-fourth of that needed to operate a sharp-crested weir 
*The velocity of approach is part of the calibration equations for flumes
*Unauthorized altering of the dimensions of constructed flumes is difficult (and therefore unlikely)
*Most flume styles readily allow for the passage of sedimentation and floating debris – reducing the time and effort associated with maintaining a flume installation

Styles of flow measurement flumes include: Cutthroat, HS / H / HL-type, Khafagi, Montana, RBC, Parshall, Palmer-Bowlus, Trapezoidal, and Venturi Flume.

===Navigable canal flume===

In some nineteenth-century canals, a bypass flume diverted water around a lift lock from the level (or pound) above to the level below the lock, so that the level below would have sufficient water.

===Recreational flumes===

In competitive swimming, specialized flumes with transparent sides are often employed by coaches to analyze a swimmer&#x27;s technique. The speed of the flow is variable to accommodate the full spectrum of swimming styles and ability.

<text>Sébastien Gattuso (born 28 June 1971) is a Monegasque athlete specializing in the 100 metres.

==Career==
He was born in Menton, France. In 2006 he was banned for six months after testing positive for finasteride, a drug that can be used to mask the use of steroids.

Participating in the 2004 Summer Olympics, he achieved seventh place in his hundred metres heat, thus failing to secure qualification for the second round. He ran the 100 metres in 10.58 seconds, which was a personal best time and national record.

He also competed at the 2002 European Championships, the 2003 World Championships, the 2003 World Indoor Championships and the 2007 European Indoor Championships without reaching the final.

Participating in the 2008 Summer Olympics, he ran 10.70 for sixth place in his hundred metres heat and failed to secure qualification for the second round.

His current personal best time is 10.57 seconds, achieved in June 2007 in Marseille. This is also the Monegasque record. He also holds the national records in 60 metres (6.94 s), 200 metres and shot put.

Gattuso also competed in bobsleigh in two Winter Olympics, earning his best finish of 19th in the two-man event at Vancouver in 2010. His best result at the FIBT World Championships was tenth in the four-man event at St. Moritz in 2007. The best World Cup finish for Gattuso was sixth in a two-man event at Cesana Pariol in 2007.

==Career==
Miyazaki started working in the entertainment industry at the age of four. Initially she appeared mostly in commercials, magazine advertisements, and as an extra in television dramas. Miyazaki made her film debut in &quot;Ano Natsu no Hi&quot; at the age of 14.

Also at the age of 14, Miyazaki began to draw international attention for her role as the survivor of a traumatic bus hijack in Shinji Aoyama&#x27;s &quot;Eureka&quot;. The film won the International Federation of Film Critics Prize at the Cannes Film Festival 2000, and resulted in her receiving the Best Actress award at the Japanese Professional Movie Awards. She also made her musical debut in &quot;The Little Prince&quot; in 2003.

Later, Miyazaki won Best Actress award in the Cinemanila International Film Festival for her performance in &quot;Harmful Insect&quot;. She teamed up with Aoyama again in &quot;Eli, Eli, Lema Sabachthani?&quot;, an Un Certain Regard selection at Cannes 2005. Later in the same year, she co-starred with Mika Nakashima in the mainstream and commercially successful &quot;Nana&quot;.

She won the Galaxy Individual Award for her performance in the NHK drama &quot;Atsuhime&quot; in 2008.

<doc id="1211329" wikidata="Q3353942" url="?curid=1211329" title="Christmas ham">
<text>A Christmas ham, or Yule ham, is a ham often served for Christmas dinner or during Yule in Northern Europe and the Anglosphere. The style of preparation varies widely by place and time.

The tradition of eating ham is thought to have evolved from the Germanic pagan ritual of sacrificing a wild boar known as a sonargöltr to the Norse god Freyr during harvest festivals.

== Nordic traditions ==
The centerpiece of the cold cuts section of a traditional Swedish Christmas smörgåsbord (at Christmas called &quot;julbord&quot;) is a large Christmas ham (a cured ham which has been boiled or baked, then coated with a mixture of egg, breadcrumbs and mustard, browned in the oven).

== American traditions ==

, Americans purchase about as much ham as turkey around the holiday season. Ham began being mentioned as a Christmas dish in around 1900, and started growing in popularity in about 1960. The holiday ham began being promoted by Armour &amp; Company in 1916 as part of its marketing efforts for its novel industrially quick-cured and less salty hams. The baked Christmas ham with a clove-studded, diamond-hatched sugar glaze which became popular in the 20th century was introduced in the 1930s. Glazed hams had long been popular long before that, but until the 1880s, they were usually glazed with stock, not sugar, and were not associated with Christmas.

The sugar-glazed ham has become identified with Southern cooking.

There are also various regional recipes. Stuffed ham is popular in southern Maryland, and particularly St. Mary&#x27;s County, where it is traditional to stuff a corned ham with greens such as kale and cabbage. This tradition has been around in the area for at least 200 years. Similar stuffed hams are also sometimes prepared in Kentucky.

== Australian traditions ==
Ham is a traditional Australian dish that features on most tables on Christmas Day. It is cooked and served in various ways throughout Australia, with many families adding special ingredients, making it an important aspect of a Christmas meal. 

As Christmas in Australia comes at the beginning of summer, many people no longer serve a traditional hot roast dinner, serving cold turkey and ham, seafood and salads instead. Christmas ham leftovers are often frozen to make soup and other dishes when the summer is over.

== Filipino traditions ==
In the Philippines and among diaspora groups such as Filipino-Americans, a ham is prepared for Christmas celebrations. The ham is referred to as a &quot;hamón&quot;, from the Spanish word for &quot;ham&quot;, &quot;jamón&quot;. The hamón is sometimes soaked in kumquat and lime juice. It is similar to, but not to be confused for, &quot;hamonado&quot;, which is another Filipino dish that can include pork and is also served around the Christmas season.

<doc id="1211331" wikidata="Q1840892" url="?curid=1211331" title="List of highways in Victoria">
<text>The highways in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] are the highest density in any state in Australia. Unlike Australia&#x27;s other mainland states where vast areas are very sparsely inhabited &quot;outback&quot;, population centres spread out over most of the state, with only the far north-west and the Victorian Alps lacking permanent settlement. Highways have therefore been built to service the population centres.

The highways generally radiate from Melbourne and other major cities and rural centres with secondary roads interconnecting the highways to each other.

Most routes have higher traffic than most other states. Highways such as Hume Highway, Western Highway, South Gippsland Highway and Princes Highway have some of the heaviest traffic in Australia.

Many of the highways are built to freeway standard (&quot;M&quot; freeways), while most others are generally sealed and of reasonable quality.

==Numbering==

Victorian highway naming is straightforward. Most are generally named after the geographical regions and features, cities, towns and settlements along the way. Some are even more straightforward e.g. Western and Northern highways which radiate westwards and northwards from Melbourne. Notable exceptions include some interstate highways and some metropolitan highways.

The numbering system is based on &quot;ring and spoke&quot; system. The &#x27;ring&#x27; highways (highways that circle Victoria) numbers are given in the multiple of hundreds e.g. Henty Highway (200), Murray Valley Highway (400) and Great Alpine Road (500) make the outermost ring. Midland Highway (300) and Maroondah Highway (300) is the inner ring.

The spokes generally inherit their original National Route numbers. Otherwise, east-west aligned highways are given even numbers and north-south are given odd numbers. Highways and primary roads are given numbers in multiple of tens. Other roads are given numbers which indicate their general alignment.

==Freeways==
==Primary highways==
==Secondary highways==
==Tertiary highways==
==Urban highways==
In addition, several metropolitan roads have been given highway designation, mainly in Melbourne. For details see &quot;List of highways in Melbourne&quot;

<doc id="1211334" wikidata="Q1840887" url="?curid=1211334" title="List of highways in South Australia">
<text>South Australia is distinctly divided into two main areas; the well watered and populated southeastern corner and the arid outback for the rest of the state. As a result, highways are concentrated mainly in the southeast. The Eyre Highway to Perth and Stuart Highway to Darwin are the only significant highways for the remaining part of the state. The remaining roads are outback tracks. This is the list of highways in South Australia.

==Road numbering==
Since 1955, South Australia had major rural roads numbered as part of national routes and Highways. In 1998/1999 South Australia introduced &quot;Trailblazers&quot; with A, B and M route numbers in the Metropolitan area and tourist areas of Victor Harbor and the Barossa Valley. This system was extended to cover country uouverreas starting in 1999/2000.

These route numbers are used on signs and maps and distinct from the four digit numbers for major roads and eight digit numbers for streets used internally by the Highways Depar Brasil Lixo 

==Expressways==

In South Australia, &quot;expressway&quot; may refer to a controlled access highway with no at-grade intersections or a limited access road of slightly lower standard with at-grade intersections at some locations. Currently there are three constructed expressways in Adelaide:
* Port River Expressway , completed in 2008
* Northern Expressway , completed in 2010
* North–South Motorway, made up of (from north to south)
** the Northern Connector, , completed in 2020;
** the South Road Superway, , completed in 2014;
** the Regency Road to Pym Street stretch, , completed in 2021;
** the Torrens to Torrens, , completed in 2018
** the Torrens to Darlington project , construction due to start 2023; 
** The Gateway South Project (extended the Southern Expressway from Darlington to Tonsley, completed 2019)
** Southern Expressway (formerly the world&#x27;s longest reversible one way freeway), completed in 1997, with duplication completed in 2014

<doc id="1211335" wikidata="Q5308890" url="?curid=1211335" title="Drug diversion">
<text>Drug diversion is a medical and legal concept involving the transfer of any legally prescribed controlled substance from the individual for whom it was prescribed to another person for any illicit use. The definition varies slightly among different jurisdictions, but the transfer of a controlled substance alone usually does not constitute a diversion, since certain controlled substances that are prescribed to a child are intended to be administered by an adult, as directed by a medical professional. The term comes from the &quot;diverting&quot; of the drugs from their original licit medical purpose. In some jurisdictions, drug diversion programs are available to first time offenders of diversion drug laws, which &quot;divert&quot; offenders from the criminal justice system to a program of education and rehabilitation.

==Commonly diverted drugs==

Controlled prescription drug classes which are commonly diverted include:
*Benzodiazepines – including diazepam, temazepam, clonazepam, and alprazolam – prescription anxiolytics and sedatives
*Opioids – including morphine, hydrocodone, oxycodone and codeine – prescription pain medications 
*Stimulants – amphetamine, methylphenidate, and modafinil – prescribed to treat ADHD and narcolepsy
*Z-drugs – including zolpidem (Ambien), Eszopiclone (Lunesta) – prescription sleep medications

According to the United States Department of Justice, &quot;Most pharmaceuticals abused in the United States are diverted by doctor shopping, forged prescriptions, theft and, increasingly, via the Internet.&quot; To reduce the occurrence of pharmaceutical diversion by doctor shopping and prescription fraud, almost all states have established prescription monitoring programs (PMPs) that facilitate the collection, analysis, and reporting of information regarding pharmaceutical drug prescriptions.

== Registration of drug suppliers ==
21 U.S.C. § 823 of the Controlled Substances Act provides for registration of manufacturers and distributors of controlled substances. The criteria for registering manufacturers of Schedule I and II drugs are particularly strict and call for &quot;limiting the importation and bulk manufacture of such controlled substances to a number of establishments which can produce an adequate and uninterrupted supply of these substances under adequately competitive conditions for legitimate medical, scientific, research, and industrial purposes.&quot; The Attorney General must make a positive determination that the registration would be &quot;consistent with the public interest.&quot;

For manufacturers of other drugs, and for drug distributors, the regulations are substantially less strict: &quot;The Attorney General shall register an applicant… unless he determines that the issuance of such registration is inconsistent with the public interest.&quot; The criteria for both manufacture and distribution is somewhat biased in favor of established industries, favoring &quot;past experience&quot; and a record of compliance with drug laws The Controlled Substances Act also provides for the registration of medical practitioners (i.e., physicians, dentists, veterinarians, etc.), pharmacies and hospitals that prescribe, administer, or dispense controlled substances directly to patients, as well as individuals conducting approved research involving controlled substances. This category also includes narcotic treatment programs that administer and dispense primarily methadone for narcotic addiction treatment.

=== Examples ===
This activity can occur in many venues:

&quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot; has reported on its frequency. John Burke, an expert on the issue, was quoted as saying, &quot;Pharmaceutical diversion is kind of funny because it&#x27;s going on in every community, but it appears not to exist unless you go after it purposely.&quot;

==DEA investigation into oxycodone diversion==
According to the US Justice Department, in 2011 CVS pharmacies in Sanford, Florida, ordered enough painkillers to supply a population eight times its size. Sanford has a population of 53,000 but the supply would support 400,000. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), in 2010 a single CVS pharmacy in Sanford ordered 1.8 million oxycodone pills, an average of 137,994 pills a month. Other pharmacy customers in Florida averaged 5,364 oxycodone pills a month. DEA investigators serving a warrant to a CVS pharmacy in Sanford on October 18, 2011 noted that &quot;approximately every third car that came through the drive-thru lane had prescriptions for oxycodone or hydrocodone.&quot;

According to the DEA, a pharmacist at that location stated to investigators that &quot;her customers often requested certain brands of oxycodone using street slang,&quot; an indicator that the drugs were being diverted and not used for legitimate pain management. In response, CVS in a statement issued February 17 in response to opioid trafficking questions from &quot;USA Today&quot; said the company is committed to working with the DEA and had taken &quot;significant actions to ensure appropriate dispensing of painkillers in Florida.&quot;

In February 2012, Joseph Rannazzisi, chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Office of Diversion Control, issued immediate suspension orders against Cardinal Health&#x27;s supply of oxycodone to suspected pill mills. Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole then called Rannazzisi to a meeting at Justice Department headquarters where Cole warned him “it made good sense to listen to what Cardinal had to say”. Rannazzisi was fired from the drug diversion office in August 2015. Cardinal was never fined.

Cardinal, alongside McKesson Corporation and AmerisourceBergen, spent $13 million lobbying Congress to pass Congressman Tom Marino&#x27;s &quot;Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act&quot;. The bill, which increases the burden of proof enforcers need to show against drug distributors, was signed into law by President Barack Obama in April 2016.

<text>Pfungstadt is a town of 25,029 inhabitants (2020), in the district of Darmstadt-Dieburg in the state of Hesse, Germany.

==History==
The town was first mentioned in 785 as property of the Monastery of Lorsch and got its town rights in 1886 due to its railway station. It is situated just west of the Odenwald hills, one of the closest being Frankenstein with its castle ruin of monstrous fame (Mary Shelley) on its summit. It is said Shelley used the name after asking a sailor on a Rhine trip to tell her the name of &quot;this yonder castle&quot;.

==Economy==
Pfungstadt is most famous today for its beer, Pfungstädter, which can be found all over Germany. The Brewery has a long history.

Sadly, after 192 years this heritage came to an end in December 2023 when the brewery was forced to relocate out of the city after the land was sold for future residential development.

==Transport==
Regional service of Pfungstadt Railway (&quot;Pfungstadtbahn&quot;) to Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof was reactivated at the beginning of 2012. It is served by the extension of services on the Odenwald Railway (&quot;Odenwaldbahn&quot;) from Darmstadt station to Pfungstadt as RB 66.

Buses (VIA25222, VIA25224, Bus P and Bus PE) also serve Pfungstadt. The Pfungstadt bus station is on Berliner Street. The Bundesautobahn 5 freeway is to the west of town. The main road near the town are to the east B3 and the Bundesautobahn 5 freeway. To the west of town is the Bundesautobahn 67 freeway.

==Sport==

The swimming pool was known far and wide, with a modern wave generation feature which was loved by young and old. The town had to close the pool due to a lack of funds required for major maintenance projects.

==Sights==
The historical town hall is the centre of the old part of the town, which in 1664 was being developed with a view to allowing the river Modau to flow above ground as basis for a promenade.

==Culture==
In 1973, the town hosted the 13th &quot;Hessentag&quot; state festival. It will host the 60th edition in 2023 as well.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Pfungstadt is twinned with:
* Bassetlaw, England, United Kingdom
* Figline e Incisa Valdarno, Italy
* Gradignan, France
* Hévíz, Hungary

==Notable people==
*Julius Mombach (1813–1880), English synagogue composer

<text>Highways in Western Australia include both roads that are named as a highway, and roads that have been declared as a highway under the Main Roads Act 1930. The standard of highways range from two-lane roads, common in rural areas, to controlled access, grade separated freeways in Perth.

In legislation, a highway is a type of road controlled and maintained by the state road authority, Main Roads Western Australia. Any road or section of road may be proclaimed a highway by the Governor of Western Australia, on the recommendation of the Commissioner of Main Roads, under Section 13 of the Main Roads Act 1930. Section 14 of the act allows for the creation of new highways. Main Roads assigns each highway a name and number, which may vary from the official road names used on road signs and by the general public. The highway number does not correspond to a road route that may be allocated to the highway, and some highways are not part of a numbered route.

==Proclaimed highways==
==Main roads with highway names==
A &quot;main road&quot; is another type of road controlled by Main Roads Western Australia.
==Outback tracks with highway names==
As the outback covers most of Western Australia, tracks provide vital links to remote communities and settlements. These tracks are unsealed, remote, and in many cases pass through restricted areas such as Aboriginal lands and Indigenous Protected Areas, which require transit permits.

*Anne Beadell Highway
*Connie Sue Highway
*Eagle Highway
*Gary Highway
*Gunbarrel Highway
*Heather Highway
*Buntine Highway

==Road routes with highway names==

Highway 1 is a route that circumnavigates Australia, joining all mainland state capitals, via roads numbered 1, M1, A1, or B1, as some states use an alphanumeric route numbering system. In Western Australia, most of the highway is designated as National Route 1. However, the sections in the north-east and south-east of the state that are concurrent with the National Highway routes from Perth to Adelaide and from Perth to Darwin are designated as National Highway 1.

<text>Queensland, being the second largest (by area) state in Australia, is also the most decentralised. Hence the highways and roads cover most parts of the state unlike the sparsely populated Western Australia. Even Queensland&#x27;s outback is well served as it is relatively populated.

Road quality varies from 8-laned Pacific Motorway linking Brisbane–Gold Coast to earth-packed outback tracks, reflecting the great diversity of its terrain and climatic conditions. The route markings are also unique in the sense that Queensland uses all available schemes, from old-style National Routes and Highways scheme and the blue-shielded State Routes scheme to the latest alphanumeric numbering scheme and the Metroads metropolitan route numbering scheme.

<text>Foothill College is a public community college in Los Altos Hills, California. It is part of the Foothill–De Anza Community College District. It was founded on January 15, 1957, and offers 84 Associate degree programs, 2 Bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, and 124 certificate programs.

==History==
In July 1956, Palo Alto Unified School District Superintendent Henry M. Gunn called a meeting of local school superintendents that led to the creation of Foothill College. Calvin Flint, then President of Monterey Peninsula College, was hired as the first District Superintendent and President; he started work on March 1, 1958.

Candidates for the new college&#x27;s name, besides Foothill, were Peninsula, Junipero Serra, Mid-Peninsula, Earl Warren, Herbert Hoover, North Santa Clara, Altos, Valley, Skyline, Highland, and Intercity. At first the name was Foothill Junior College, but because Flint insisted that his new college would be &quot;not junior to anyone&quot;, the Board dropped the &quot;Junior&quot; in September 1958.

Foothill held its first classes in the old Highway School campus on El Camino Real in Mountain View on September 15, 1958. It was accredited by March of the next year and was the first school in the state to ever reach full accreditation in less than six months. The owl mascot originated from a concrete owl that was a decoration on the Highway School&#x27;s bell tower; it was later moved to the new campus.

The campus was designed by architect Ernest Kump and landscape architects Hideo Sasaki and Peter Walker, to resemble a neo-Japanese garden. The Foothill College was intended as a junior college for 3,500 full-time students, within the 122-acre campus, the first of many junior colleges built after World War II in California. Soon after its completion, Foothill was widely recognized as a pioneer, setting high standards for new campus design.

Traditionally, Foothill serves the communities of Los Altos Hills, Los Altos, Mountain View, and Palo Alto; together these communities form the northwest corner of Silicon Valley. The college sits next to Interstate 280, at the interchange with El Monte Road.

In 1993, Foothill and its sister school De Anza College became the first California Community Colleges to offer Domestic Partner benefits. The colleges were among a very small number of institutions of higher education to do so, with Pitzer College and the University of Iowa in 1991 and Stanford and the University of Chicago in 1992.

On December 10, 2001, Foothill College abruptly canceled its men&#x27;s basketball season after completing just six games. Questions arose over how housing and tuition for six international players were being paid by Tariq Abdul-Wahad, then with the NBA&#x27;s Denver Nuggets and alumnus of San Jose State University.

In 2002, a second campus was opened on the site of the former Cubberley High School in Palo Alto, in facilities leased from the Palo Alto School District. In September 2016, this was replaced by the Sunnyvale Center, which the college built on part of the site of the now closed Onizuka Air Force Station, preserving artefacts from the &quot;Blue Cube&quot; and embedding shards of its skin in walkways. The new center can accommodate more than 1,600 students.

The campus serves a very large number of international students who are attempting to acquire associate degrees as the basis for transferring into prestigious American universities; according to a &quot;Community College Week&quot; survey in 2001, Foothill had the 12th highest population of international students out of all community colleges in the United States. The school was harshly criticized in 2002 by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; for its aggressive recruitment of such students, since they are a lucrative revenue source who pay a much higher tuition.

In 2003, to accommodate nearly 14,000 students on a campus designed for 3,500, the college began renovating almost the entire campus, including demolition and replacement of unsafe buildings. Two of the new buildings in the lower campus complex have green roofs topped with grass.

===Foothill Electronics Museum===
Between 1973 and 1991, an electronics museum stood on the Foothill College campus. The museum was established with the help of the Douglas Perham Electronic Foundation, which wanted a permanent home for its extensive electronics collection, including papers of the inventor of the vacuum tube amplifier, Lee de Forest. The foundation raised money to construct a museum building on the Foothill campus and donated its collection to the college. The museum opened in 1973, and was initially operated by employees of Foothill College for six years until 1979, just after the passage of Proposition 13 rolled back property taxes and reduced funds to run the college. In response to the funding shortage, volunteers began staffing the museum.

However, in 1988, the college board of trustees decided to close the museum, sell or donate the assets, and use the space for classrooms. A newly appointed Perham board member, Bart Lee, took on the case and sued Foothill, claiming the college violated an agreement with the Perham Foundation. The foundation was eventually awarded $775,000, which they used to document, pack up, and place the collection in storage before a 1991 deadline. The collection stayed in storage for twelve years, before being acquired in 2003 by History San José and put on display as The Perham Collection of Early Electronics.

<doc id="1211348" wikidata="Q752481" url="?curid=1211348" title="Syrian woodpecker">
<text>The Syrian woodpecker (Dendrocopos syriacus) is a member of the woodpecker family, the Picidae.

==Taxonomy==
The Syrian woodpecker was first described as &quot;Picus syriacus&quot; by Wilhelm Hemprich and Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in 1833, from a specimen collected on Mount Lebanon.

==Distribution and habitat==
The woodpecker is a resident breeding bird from southeastern Europe east to Iran. Its range has expanded further northwest into Europe in recent years. It is an inhabitant of open woodlands, cultivation with trees and scrubs, and parks, depending for food and nesting sites upon old trees. It is often an inconspicuous bird, in spite of the plumage.

==Description==
The woodpecker is 23 cm long, and is very similar to the great spotted woodpecker, &quot;Dendrocopos major&quot;. The upper parts of the male are glossy black, with a crimson spot on the nape and white on the forehead, sides of the face and neck. On the shoulder is a large white patch and the flight feathers are black with white spots forming three wingbars. The three outer tail feathers show only a few white spots; these show when the short stiff tail is outspread, acting as a support in climbing. The under parts are buffish white, the abdomen and under tail coverts reddish. The long bill is slate black and the legs greenish grey. The female has no crimson on the nape, and in the young this nape spot is absent, but the crown is crimson.

It differs from the smaller lesser spotted woodpecker by the crimson on the abdomen and the white shoulder-patches. It is much harder to distinguish Syrian woodpecker from great spotted woodpecker. Syrian has a longer bill, has more white on the head, and lacks the white tail barring of great spotted.

==Behaviour==
===Communication===
When hidden by the foliage, the Syrian woodpecker&#x27;s presence is often advertised by the mechanical drumming, a vibrating rattle, produced by the rapidly repeated blows of its strong bill upon a trunk or branch. This is not merely a mating call or challenge, but a signal of either sex. It is audible from a great distance, depending on the wind and the condition of the wood, and a hollow bough naturally produces a louder note than living wood. The drumming is longer than great spotted woodpecker&#x27;s, and decreases in volume. It is faster and shorter than the drumming of white-backed woodpecker. The call is a sharp &quot;quit, quit&quot;, softer than great spotted woodpecker, and something like common redshank.

===Feeding===
The Syrian woodpecker&#x27;s food mainly consists of those insects which bore into the timber of forest trees, such as the larvae of wood boring moths and beetles. Additional prey includes bees such as &quot;Xylocopa pubescens&quot;. The woodpecker usually alights on the trunk, working upwards. During the ascent it taps the bark, breaking off fragments, but often extracts its prey from crevices with the tip of its sticky tongue. Seeds, nuts and berries are eaten when insect food is scarce. Its actions are jerky, and it hops rather than climbs, leaping forward with one foot just in advance of the other. Usually feeding in a vertically &#x27;heads-up&quot; position , it is not uncommon for the woodpecker to assume a vertically or horizontally upside-down attitude while probing a tree for food. When a space is crossed the flight is easy and undulating.
The Syrian woodpecker attacks polyethylene pipes of both sprinkler and drip irrigation systems in Israel [Moran, S. 1977. Distribution and characteristics of the damage of the Syrian woodpecker, Dendrocopos syriacus (Hemp. &amp; Ehr.) (Aves: Picidae), in polyethylene irrigation pipes in fruit orchards. Phytoparasitica, 5: 127-139]. It pecks holes that are 2-10 mm (mostly 5-8 mm) in diameter, and are usually well rounded. Damage to pipes is frequent in plots of avocado, citrus and grapevines bordered by rows of windbreakers, with pipes near winbreaker being the most severely attecked. The holes in the irrigation pipes lead to a fall in the water pressure which in turn reduces the amount of water emitted at various sections along the irrigation line. The reason for birds&#x27; pecking at the pipe is not clear.

===Breeding===

The neat, round 5 cm diameter nesting hole, is bored in soft or decaying wood horizontally for a few inches, then perpendicularly down. At the bottom of the shaft, a small chamber is excavated, where up to 11 creamy white eggs are laid on wood chips. The hole is rarely used again, but not infrequently other holes are bored in the same tree. Almost any tree sufficiently rotten is used. The young, when the parents are feeding them, cluster at the mouth of the hole and keep a continuous chatter, but when alarmed slip back into the hole.

<text>The Wow! signal was a strong narrowband radio signal detected on August 15, 1977, by Ohio State University&#x27;s Big Ear radio telescope in the United States, then used to support the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. The signal appeared to come from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius and bore expected hallmarks of extraterrestrial origin.

Astronomer Jerry R. Ehman discovered the anomaly a few days later while reviewing the recorded data. He was so impressed by the result that he circled on the computer printout the reading of the signal&#x27;s intensity, &quot;6EQUJ5&quot;, and wrote the comment &quot;Wow!&quot; beside it, leading to the event&#x27;s widely used name.

The entire signal sequence lasted for the full 72-second window during which Big Ear was able to observe it, but has not been detected since, despite many subsequent attempts by Ehman and others. Several hypotheses have been advanced on the origin of the emission, including natural and human-made sources.

== Background ==
In a 1959 paper, Cornell University physicists Philip Morrison and Giuseppe Cocconi had speculated that any extraterrestrial civilization attempting to communicate via radio signals might do so using a frequency of megahertz (-centimeter spectral line), which is naturally emitted by hydrogen, the most common element in the universe and therefore likely familiar to all technologically advanced civilizations.

In 1973, after completing an extensive survey of extragalactic radio sources, Ohio State University assigned the now-defunct Ohio State University Radio Observatory (nicknamed &quot;Big Ear&quot;) to the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), in the longest-running program of this kind in history. The radio telescope was located near the Perkins Observatory on the campus of Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio.

By 1977, Ehman was working at the SETI project as a volunteer; his job involved analyzing by hand large amounts of data processed by an IBM 1130 computer and recorded on line printer paper. While perusing data collected on August 15 at 22:16 EDT (02:16 UTC), he spotted a series of values of signal intensity and frequency that left him and his colleagues astonished.
The event was later documented in technical detail by the observatory&#x27;s director.

== Signal measurement ==

The string 6EQUJ5, commonly misinterpreted as a message encoded in the radio signal, represents in fact the signal&#x27;s intensity variation over time, expressed in the particular measuring system adopted for the experiment. The signal itself appeared to be an unmodulated continuous wave, although any modulation with a period of less than 10 seconds or longer than 72 seconds would not have been detectable.

=== Intensity ===
The signal intensity was measured as signal-to-noise ratio, with the noise (or baseline) averaged over the previous few minutes. The signal was sampled for 10 seconds and then processed by the computer, which took 2 seconds. The result for each frequency channel was output on the printout as a single alphanumeric character, representing the 10-second average intensity, minus the baseline, expressed as a dimensionless multiple of the signal&#x27;s standard deviation.

In this particular intensity scale, a space character denoted an intensity between 0 and 1, that is between baseline and one standard deviation above it. The numbers 1 to 9 denoted the correspondingly numbered intensities (from 1 to 9); intensities of 10 and above were indicated by a letter: &quot;A&quot; corresponded to intensities between 10 and 11, &quot;B&quot; to 11 to 12, and so on. The Wow! signal&#x27;s highest measured value was &quot;U&quot; (an intensity between 30 and 31), which is thirty standard deviations above background noise.

=== Frequency ===
John Kraus, the director of the observatory, gave a value of in a 1994 summary written for Carl Sagan. However, Ehman in 1998 gave a value of . This is () above the hydrogen line value (with no red- or blue-shift) of . If due to blue-shift, it would correspond to the source moving about towards Earth.
An explanation of the difference between Ehman&#x27;s value and Kraus&#x27;s can be found in Ehman&#x27;s paper. The first local oscillator in the telescope&#x27;s radio receiver was specified to a frequency value of . However, the university&#x27;s purchasing department made a typographical error in the order form, instead obtaining an oscillator with frequency (i.e., higher than desired). The software used in the experiment was then written to adjust for this error. When Ehman computed the frequency of the Wow! signal, he took this error into account.

=== Bandwidth ===
The Wow! signal had a bandwidth of less than . It is considered narrowband emission in the sense that its fractional bandwidth was relatively small (~1%). However, the bandwidth is not small compared to the bandwidth of some astrophysical masers (~) or to the frequency resolution of modern narrowband SETI searches (~). The Big Ear telescope was equipped with a receiver capable of measuring fifty -wide channels. The output from each channel was represented in the computer printout as a column of alphanumeric intensity values. The Wow! signal is essentially confined to one column.

=== Time variation ===
At the time of the observation, the Big Ear radio telescope was only adjustable for altitude (or height above the horizon), and relied on the rotation of the Earth to scan across the sky. Given the speed of Earth&#x27;s rotation and the spatial width of the telescope&#x27;s observation window, the Big Ear could observe any given point for just 72 seconds. A continuous extraterrestrial signal, therefore, would be expected to register for exactly 72 seconds, and the recorded intensity of such signal would display a gradual increase for the first 36 seconds—peaking at the center of the observation window—and then a gradual decrease as the telescope moved away from it. All these characteristics are present in the Wow! signal.

== Celestial location ==

The precise location in the sky where the signal apparently originated is uncertain due to the design of the Big Ear telescope, which featured two feed horns, each receiving a beam from slightly different directions, while following Earth&#x27;s rotation. The Wow! signal was detected in one beam but not in the other, and the data was processed in such a way that it is impossible to determine which of the two horns received the signal. There are, therefore, two possible right ascension (RA) values for the location of the signal (expressed below in terms of the two main reference systems):

In contrast, the declination was unambiguously determined to be as follows:

The galactic coordinates for the positive horn are =11.7°, =−18.9°, and for the negative horn =11.9°, =−19.5°, both being therefore about 19° toward the southeast of the galactic plane, and about 24° or 25° east of the Galactic Center. The region of the sky in question lies northwest of the globular cluster M55, in the constellation Sagittarius, roughly 2.5 degrees south of the fifth-magnitude star group Chi Sagittarii, and about 3.5 degrees south of the plane of the ecliptic. The closest easily visible star is Tau Sagittarii.

Initially, no nearby Sun-like stars were known to lie within the antenna coordinates, although in any direction the antenna pattern would encompass about six distant Sun-like stars as estimated in 2016. In 2022, a paper published in the &quot;International Journal of Astrobiology&quot; identified three likely Sun-like stars within the antenna-pointed coordinates. The better characterized star, 2MASS 19281982-2640123, is located 1,800 light years away, only 132 light years away from Maccone&#x27;s estimation where an intelligent civilization is more likely to exist. The other two candidates, 2MASS 19252173-2713537 and 2MASS 19282229-2702492, were insufficiently characterized but still likely to be Sun-like stars. Also, 14 other catalogued stars at the antenna coordinates may still turn out to be similar to the Sun after more data becomes available. As a response to the discovery, Breakthrough Listen conducted the first targeted search for the Wow! Signal in its first collaboration between the Green Bank Telescope and the Allen Telescope Array of the SETI Institute. The observations were performed on May 21, 2022, lasting 1 hour from Greenbank, 35 minutes from ATA, and 9 minutes and 40 seconds simultaneously. No technosignature candidates were found.

== Hypotheses on the signal&#x27;s origin ==
Interstellar of a weaker continuous signal—similar in effect to atmospheric twinkling—could be an explanation, but that would not exclude the possibility of the signal being artificial in origin. The significantly more sensitive Very Large Array did not detect the signal, and the probability that a signal below the detection threshold of the Very Large Array could be detected by the Big Ear due to interstellar scintillation is low. Other hypotheses include a rotating lighthouse-like source, a signal sweeping in frequency, or a one-time burst.

Ehman said in 1994: &quot;We should have seen it again when we looked for it 50 times. Something suggests it was an Earth-sourced signal that simply got reflected off a piece of space debris.&quot; He later somewhat recanted his skepticism, after further research showed the unrealistic requirements that a space-borne reflector would need to have to produce the observed signal.
The signal&#x27;s frequency of is also part of a protected spectrum: a frequency range reserved for astronomical research in which terrestrial transmissions are forbidden, although a 2010 study documented several instances of terrestrial sources either interfering from adjacent frequency bands or illegally transmitting within the spectrum. In a 1997 paper, Ehman resists &quot;drawing vast conclusions from data&quot;—acknowledging the possibility that the source may have been military or otherwise a product of Earth-bound sources. In a 2019 interview with John Michael Godier, Ehman stated: &quot;I&#x27;m convinced that the Wow! signal certainly has the potential of being the first signal from extraterrestrial intelligence.&quot;

METI president Douglas Vakoch told that any putative SETI signal detections must be replicated for confirmation, and the lack of such replication for the Wow! signal means it has little credibility.

In August 2024, the Planetary Habitability Laboratory published a preprint reporting observations made in 2020 at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico—where they conclude that the Wow! signal was likely caused by a rare astrophysical event, in which stellar emissions energizing a cold hydrogen cloud caused it to suddenly surge in brightness.

=== Discredited hypotheses ===
In 2017, Antonio Paris, Assistant Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics at St. Petersburg College, Florida, proposed that the hydrogen cloud surrounding two comets, 266P/Christensen and 335P/Gibbs, now known to have been in the same region of the sky, could have been the source of the Wow! signal. This hypothesis was dismissed by astronomers, including members of the original Big Ear research team, as the cited comets were not in the beam at the correct time. Furthermore, comets do not emit strongly at the frequencies involved, and there is no explanation for why a comet would be observed in one beam but not in the other.

== Searches for recurrence of the signal ==
Several attempts were made by Ehman and other astronomers to recover and identify the signal. The signal was expected to occur three minutes apart in each of the telescope&#x27;s feed horns, but that did not happen. Ehman unsuccessfully searched for recurrences using Big Ear in the months after the detection.

In 1987 and 1989, Robert H. Gray searched for the event using the META array at Oak Ridge Observatory, but did not detect it. In a July 1995 test of signal detection software to be used in its upcoming Project Argus, SETI League executive director H. Paul Shuch made several drift-scan observations of the Wow! signal&#x27;s coordinates with a 12-meter radio telescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, also achieving a null result.

In 1995 and 1996, Gray again searched for the signal using the Very Large Array, which is significantly more sensitive than Big Ear. Gray and Simon Ellingsen later searched for recurrences of the event in 1999 using the 26-meter radio telescope at the University of Tasmania&#x27;s Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory. Six 14-hour observations were made at positions in the vicinity, but nothing like the Wow! signal was detected.

== Response ==
In 2012, on the 35th anniversary of the Wow! signal, Arecibo Observatory beamed a digital stream towards Hipparcos 34511, 33277, and 43587. The transmission consisted of approximately 10,000 Twitter messages solicited for the purpose by the National Geographic Channel, bearing the hashtag &quot;#ChasingUFOs&quot; (a promotion for one of the channel&#x27;s TV series). The sponsor also included a series of video vignettes featuring verbal messages from various celebrities.

To increase the probability that any extraterrestrial recipients would recognize the signal as an intentional communication from another intelligent life form, Arecibo scientists attached a repeating-sequence header to each individual message, and beamed the transmission at roughly 20 times the power of the most powerful commercial radio transmitter.

== In popular culture ==
The signal was featured in the 2024 television series &quot;3 Body Problem&quot;, in which the signal is also detected in Inner Mongolia.

<doc id="1211350" wikidata="Q1059204" url="?curid=1211350" title="The Third Wave (experiment)">
<text>The Third Wave was an experimental movement created by the high school history teacher Ron Jones in 1967 to explain how the German population could have accepted the actions of the Nazi regime during the rise of the Third Reich and the Second World War. 

While Jones taught his students about Nazi Germany during his senior level Contemporary World History class, Jones found it difficult to explain how the German people could have accepted the actions of the Nazis. He decided to create a fictional social movement as a demonstration of the appeal of fascism. Over the course of five days (or nine, according to student Sherry Toulsey), Jones—a member of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Cubberley United Student Movement sponsor and Black Panthers supporter—conducted a series of exercises in his classroom emphasizing discipline and community, intended to model certain characteristics of the Nazi movement.

As the movement grew outside his class and began to number in the hundreds, the experiment had spiralled out of control. He convinced the students to attend a rally where he claimed that the classroom project was part of a nationwide movement and that the announcement of a Third Wave presidential candidate would be televised. Upon their arrival, the students were presented with a blank channel. Jones told his students of the true nature of the movement as an experiment in fascism, and he presented to them a short film discussing the actions of Nazi Germany.

The project was adapted into an American film, &quot;The Wave&quot;, in 1981, and a critically acclaimed German film, &quot;Die Welle&quot;, in 2008.

==Background to the Third Wave experiment==
The experiment took place at Cubberley High School in Palo Alto, California, during the first week of April 1967. Jones, finding himself unable to explain to his students how the German people could have claimed ignorance of The Holocaust, decided to demonstrate it to them instead. Jones started a movement called &quot;The Third Wave&quot; and told his students that the movement aimed to eliminate democracy. Jones postulated that democracy’s focus on individuality was against mankind’s “authoritarian” nature, which he aimed to emphasize with the movement’s motto: &quot;Strength through discipline, strength through involvement.&quot;

Although the experiment was not well documented at the time, it was briefly mentioned in two issues of the Cubberley High School student newspaper, &quot;The Cubberley Catamount&quot;. A contemporary issue of the paper contains a more detailed account of the experiment, published just days after its conclusion. Jones wrote a full recollection of the experiment some nine years after its conclusion. Subsequent articles by other authors followed, some featuring interviews with Jones and the students involved.

==Chronology==
===First day===
The experiment began with simple alterations such as proper seating. He wrote &quot;Strength Through Discipline&quot; on the classroom&#x27;s chalkboard, then enforced strict classroom discipline while speaking to the importance of discipline. The procedures were simple. Students were expected to sit at attention before the second bell, had to stand up to ask or answer questions and had to do so in three words or fewer, and were required to preface each remark with &quot;Mr. Jones&quot;. He drilled them on their adherence to these rules. Jones intended only a one-day experiment.

===Second day===
Jones decided to continue the experiment after observing his students&#x27; strict adherence to the previous day&#x27;s rules. He added &quot;Strength Through Community&quot; to the chalk board, and named his movement &quot;the Third Wave&quot;. Jones based the name of his movement on the supposed fact that the third in a series of waves is the strongest. Jones created a salute involving a cupped hand reaching across the chest toward the opposite shoulder, resembling a Hitler salute. He ordered class members to salute each other both in and outside of the class. Jones then assigned each of his students an individual assignment, such as designing a Third Wave banner, stopping non-members from entering the class, or recruiting their friends to join the movement.

===Third day===
The experiment had now taken on a life of its own. Students from across the school joined in. Class expanded from its initial 30 students to a total of 43. Jones added &quot;Strength Through Action&quot; to the chalkboard. Students were issued a member card. Jones instructed the students on how to initiate new members. By the end of the day the movement had over 200 participants. Jones instructed three students to report to him when other members of the movement failed to abide by the rules. He was surprised when around twenty of the students made such reports. A student who expressed concern for Jones&#x27;s safety volunteered to become his bodyguard.

===Fourth day===
Jones decided to terminate the movement, as it was slipping out of his control. The students had become more and more involved in the project. Jones announced to the class that this movement was a part of a nationwide movement and that on the next day a presidential candidate of the Third Wave would announce its existence to the public. He ordered students to attend a noon rally on Friday to witness the announcement. Jones also ordered four students to banish three dissenting students to the school library and to prevent them from attending the rally to emphasize loyalty to the movement&#x27;s precepts.

===Fifth and final day===
The students all arrived at 11:50 a.m. Jones had convinced a number of his friends to pose as reporters, and asked the students to demonstrate what they had learned in the minutes before the televised address would supposedly begin. He then led them in shouting chants of &quot;Strength through discipline! Strength through community! Strength through action!&quot; He turned on the TV placed in the middle of the room. Rather than a televised address of their leader, the students were presented with an empty channel. After a few minutes of waiting, Jones announced that they had been a part of an experiment in fascism and that they all had willingly created a sense of superiority, much as German citizens had done in the period of Nazi Germany. He then apologized to them for how far it all had gone, and played them a film about the Nazi regime to conclude the experiment.

==Documentaries==
&quot;Lesson Plan&quot;, which retold the story of the Third Wave through interviews with the original students and teacher, debuted at the Mill Valley Film Festival in 2010. It debuted on October 10. It was produced by Philip Neel and Mark Hancock, two of Jones&#x27;s own former students.

A German documentary entitled &quot;The Invisible Line&quot; (&quot;Die Geschichte der Welle&quot;) debuted on television on December 19, 2019. This also featured interviews with Jones and former students. 

===Dramatizations===
* The events of the experiment were adapted into a 1981 US TV special, &quot;The Wave&quot;. This formed the basis for the Young Adult novelization of the same name written by Todd Strasser, under the pseudonym of Morton Rhue. The special and novelization updated the setting to the modern day.
* &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;, the 86th book in the &quot;Sweet Valley Twins&quot; series, features a substitute teacher who conducts an experiment similar to The Third Wave. The title references a novel of the same name. 
* In 2001, a musical adaptation written by Olaf Pyttlik premiered at the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre in Canada.
* The 2008 German film &quot;Die Welle&quot; transferred the experiment to a modern-day German classroom. The film received critical acclaim.
* &quot;The Pride of Lakewood&quot;, a 2010 episode of children&#x27;s animated series &quot;Arthur&quot;, was loosely based on the Third Wave experiment. In it, students who form a community pride group become fascistic.
* In 2010, Jones staged a musical called &quot;The Wave&quot;, written with some of the students in the class.
* The events were adapted into a non-musical stage play in 2011 by Joseph Robinette and Ron Jones.
*In 2020, a Netflix miniseries called &quot;We Are the Wave&quot; premiered in Germany. The show is about high school students, and their own activism.

<text>The Northern Territory is the most sparsely populated state or territory in Australia. Despite its sparse population, it has a network of sealed roads which connect Darwin and Alice Springs, the major population centres, the neighbouring states, and some other centres such as Uluru (Ayers Rock), Kakadu and Litchfield National Parks. Some of the sealed roads are single lane bitumen. Many unsealed (dirt) roads connect the remoter settlements.
Major roads are classified into three categories: National Highway, Arterial Roads, and Secondary Roads.

==National Highways==
There are three National Highways in the Northern Territory:
==Arterial Roads==
The following roads are classified as Arterial Roads:
==Secondary Roads==
The following roads are classified as Secondary Roads:
* Barkly Stock Route
* Buchanan Highway 
* Calvert Road

<text>The Highways in Tasmania generally expand from Hobart and other major cities with secondary roads interconnecting the highways to each other. Functions of these highways include freight, personal travel and tourism.
The AusLink Network currently consists of the Midland, Bass, Brooker, East Tamar Highway and the southern section of the Tasman Highway (Hobart-Hobart Airport).

Tasmanian highway naming is straightforward. Most are generally named after the geographical regions and features, cities, towns and settlements along the way.
Excluding the old National Highway (Brooker, Midland, Bass), Tasmanian routes have been marked with the alphanumeric marking scheme since 1979, based on the marking scheme implemented in the United Kingdom in 1922. Prior to this Tasmanian roads were marked with a National and State Route Numbering System.

Highways are a part of Tasmania&#x27;s road network, which covers a distance of approximately . As well as major highways between cities and ports, urban connectors between suburbs and commercial areas, residential streets, and forestry roads are also included. The most important state and regional connections, totalling , are state-owned roads, which are further classified into a road hierarchy.
The herirachy consists of:
* Trunk roads – major highways which are the &quot;primary freight and passenger roads&quot;
* Regional freight roads – regional roads which connect heavy freight to the trunk roads
* Regional access roads – providing access to Tasmania’s Regions, with less traffic than trunk and regional freight roads
* Feeder roads – connect population centres and tourist traffic to and from the rest of the state road network
* Other roads – lower traffic roads, primarily providing access to private properties

The following roads are classified as trunk roads:
* Bass Highway (Launceston to Wynyard)
* Brooker Highway

<text>Jahn Ivar Jakobsen, nicknamed Mini, (born 8 November 1965) is a Norwegian former football player (winger/forward) who has played for, amongst others, Bodø/Glimt and Rosenborg.

==Club career==
During the very early years of his career, Jakobsen played at Junkeren and Grand Bodø, two minor Norwegian clubs in the town of Bodø. Mini&#x27;s actual professional career as a footballer started at the well-known Norwegian club Bodø/Glimt. When he arrived at the club, Bodø/Glimt played in the third division (the third highest division in Norway at the time), but did gain promotion in 1986. In the Norwegian second division, Bodø/Glimt finished in seventh place in 1987. At Bodø/Glimt, Jakobsen was the top scorer for four consecutive seasons: In 1984, with seven goals (third division), in 1985 with 18 goals (third), in 1986 with 26 goals (third) and in 1987 with 16 goals (second division).

In 1988, Jakobsen was transferred to Rosenborg along with teammate Ørjan Berg, and after a successful season – winning the Norwegian double and becoming the league&#x27;s top scorer – he got his first cap for Norway. At Rosenborg he became well known as a high quality winger/striker.

After the Norwegian 1990 season, Jakobsen was transferred from Rosenborg to the Swiss club BSC Young Boys, and during the next four years he played for several different European clubs in Switzerland, Germany and Belgium.

In 1994, Jakobsen returned to Rosenborg, and became a part of Rosenborg&#x27;s better than expected performances in UEFA Champions League tournament. He then played for Norway in the 1998 World Cup, where they made the second round.

Jakobsen successfully ended his professional career at Rosenborg by winning the Norwegian double in 1999. He is now working as a sports reporter at the Norwegian TV channel TV 2.

==Personal life==
In his youth, Jakobsen changed his name from Jan Ivar to Jahn Ivar. He later stated that he changed his name because his idol, Norwegian singer Jahn Teigen, wrote his first name with an h.

<doc id="1211371" wikidata="Q1815887" url="?curid=1211371" title="Statement of work">
<text>A statement of work (SOW) is a document routinely employed in the field of project management. It is the narrative description of a project&#x27;s work requirement. It defines project-specific activities, deliverables and timelines for a vendor providing services to the client. The SOW typically also includes detailed requirements and pricing, with standard regulatory and governance terms and conditions. It is often an important accompaniment to a master service agreement or request for proposal (RFP).

== Overview ==
Many formats and styles of statement of work document templates have been specialized for the hardware or software solutions described in the request for proposal. Many companies create their own customized version of SOWs that are specialized or generalized to accommodate typical requests and proposals they receive. However, it is usually informed by the goals of the top management as well as input from the customer and/or user groups.

Note that in many cases the statement of work is a binding contract. Master service agreements or consultant/training service agreements postpone certain work-specific contractual components that are addressed in individual statements of work. The master service agreement serves as a master contract governing the terms over potentially multiple SOWs. Sometimes it refers to scope of work. For instance, if a project is done on contract, the scope statement included as part of it can be used as the SOW since it also outlines the work of the project in clear and concise terms.

== Areas addressed ==
A statement of work typically addresses these subjects.

* Purpose: Why are we doing this project? A purpose statement attempts to answer this.
* Scope of work: This describes the work to be done and specifies the hardware and software involved. The definition of scope becomes the &quot;scope statement&quot;.
* Location of work: This describes where the work is to be performed, including the location of hardware and software and where people will meet to do the work.
* Period of performance: This specifies the allowable time for projects, such as start and finish time, number of hours that can be billed per week or month, where work is to be performed and anything else that relates to scheduling.
* Deliverables schedule: This part lists and describes what is due and when.
* Applicable standards: This describes any industry specific standards that need to be adhered to in fulfilling the contract.
* Acceptance criteria: This specifies how the buyer or receiver of goods will determine if the product or service is acceptable, usually with objective criteria. See Acceptance testing.
* Special requirements: This specifies any special hardware or software, specialized workforce requirements, such as degrees or certifications for personnel, travel requirements, and anything else not covered in the contract specifics.
* Type of contract/payment schedule: The project acceptance will depend on if the budget available will be enough to cover the work required. Therefore, a breakdown of payments by whether they are up-front or phased will usually be negotiated in an early stage.
* Miscellaneous: Many items that are not part of the main negotiations may be listed because they are important to the project, and overlooking or forgetting them could pose problems for the project.

==United States government contracts==
For US government service contracts, the use of SOWs remains strong, although statements of objectives (SOOs) and performance work statements (PWSs) have become increasingly popular due to their emphasis on performance-based concepts such as desired service outcomes and performance standards. SOWs are typically used when the task is well-known and can be described in specific terms. They may be preferred when the government does not desire innovative approaches or considers any deviation in contractor processes a risk. SOOs establish high-level outcomes and objectives for performance and PWSs emphasize outcomes, desired results, and objectives at a more detailed and measurable level, whereas SOWs provide explicit statements of work direction for the contractor or offeror to follow.

SOWs are typically replete with &quot;contractor shall&quot; statements of mandatory compliance (for example, &quot;This task shall be performed in accordance with Agency xyz Directive, dated mm/dd/yyyy&quot;). In practice, SOWs can also be found to contain references to desired performance outcomes, performance standards, and metrics, thus blurring their distinction between SOOs and PWSs. Aside from good practice, there is little government policy guidance that emphatically prescribes how and when to use SOWs versus SOOs or PWSs. Whereas the FAR defines PWS in Part 2 Definitions, and references SOOs and PWSs in Part 37.6 Performance Based Acquisition, SOWs are not addressed.

SOWs are usually contained in the government&#x27;s solicitation (RFP or RFQ) and carried forward, as may be negotiated with the offeror, into the final contract. In federal solicitations and contracts, SOWs are inserted into Section C &quot;Descriptions/Specifications&quot; of the Uniform Contract Format,
but may also be inserted as an attachment in Section J. In task orders, the SOW may simply be included among the terms and conditions of the order itself. The SOW is often supplemented by technical reference documents and attachments. In developing the SOW, it is important to ensure that the statement of work is comprehensive and sufficiently detailed, but that the statements do not duplicate terms and conditions or other provisions elsewhere in the solicitation or contract.

Guidance in MIL-STD-881 and MIL-HDBK-245 says that a work breakdown structure should be used in developing the SOW. This may use the WBS as an outline, where each WBS element (in the same name and numbering) are the sub-parts of the SOW section 3, making the development easier and to improve later billing and tracking. The WBS which focuses on intelligently dividing a hierarchy of the work elements and defining them may then have the SOW in matching sections focus on describing what will be done with that portion or how that portion will be done.

The statement of work should be directly linked to deliverables shown in the CDRL form. This is done by having each CDRL entry include reference to the SOW paragraph(s) that produces or uses the item, and the SOW text should be clear where it is discussing a deliverable by using the title or parenthesizing the item number (for example, &quot;[A-001]&quot;).

<text>Fernando Cheung Chiu-hung (; born 23 February 1957 in Macau) is a Hong Kong politician, the vice-chairman of the Labour Party, and a former member of the Legislative Council.

==Career==
Cheung obtained his undergraduate degree in social work from Hong Kong Baptist University. He worked in the United States from 1988, and became a naturalized United States citizen. He obtained a Master&#x27;s degree in Social Work from California State University, Fresno, and a Ph.D. degree in Social Welfare from the University of California, Berkeley in 1991 while serving as the head of the Oakland Chinese Community Council. One of his grandparents was born in Peru.

On moving back to Hong Kong in 1996, he became a lecturer at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. He became the vice-convener of Civil Human Rights Front in 2002, where he had developed a close relationship with the pro-democrats. He joined the functional constituency of social welfare of the Legislative Council in 2004.

Cheung introduced a motion for the referendum on universal suffrage for the 2007 chief executive elections in Hong Kong. The Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress had outlawed universal suffrage for 2007 and 2008, and the Hong Kong government under Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said that it had to abide by this decision.

After an unsuccessful bid in the New Territories West constituency in 2008, he rejoined the Legislative Council in 2012 as a representative of New Territories East, and was reelected in 2016. 

During the 2014 Hong Kong protests, Cheung acted as a mediator between the two sides, advocating for the protests to remain peaceful. He appeared together with fellow pro-democratic lawmaker Claudia Mo at the Mong Kok protest site on 19 October, resulting in a widening of the buffer zone; no clashes were reported for the night. On 19 November, Cheung and others tried to stop radical protesters from breaking into the side-entrance to the Legislative Council Complex, but were pushed aside.

In July 2018, Cheung declared that he would not stand in the 2020 Legislative Council elections, which were later postponed to 2021.

Cheung was inside the LegCo building with protesters after it was stormed on 1 July 2019 during the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests. He expressed relief that the protesters had safely vacated the building, and had grabbed those refusing to leave.

==National Security Law and resignation==
In July 2020, after the introduction of the Hong Kong national security law in the city on 30 June 2020, Cheung said on a programme by public broadcaster RTHK that the law had turned Hong Kong from an international city into an ordinary Chinese city overnight, and that he expected an exodus of professionals and young people. He warned the Chinese Communist Party against trying to impose travel restrictions on the city&#x27;s residents, saying that this would only increase discontent, and against restricting access to the internet, as this would only destabilize social and economic conditions in the city.

On 11 November 2020, 15 democratic lawmakers including Cheung resigned en masse in protest of a decision made by the central government in Beijing the same day, authorizing the Hong Kong government to dismiss politicians who were deemed to be a threat under the national security law. Cheung said that the initial dismissals, which had concerned four democrats, &quot;signifie[d] that the Chinese Communist Party is willing to break laws and rules to eradicate the opposition&quot;, and that even if the other democrats had remained in the Legislative Council, the loss of the votes meant that they could have been impeached one by one.

==Arrest and conviction on LegCo contempt charge==
Cheung was arrested on 1 November 2020, along with six other democrats, in connection with a melee that had broken out in the LegCo on 8 May 2020 when Starry Lee, chair of the LegCo House Committee, commenced a meeting of the Committee after extended stalling tactics of the pan-democratic camp over the previous months. Cheung had repeatedly chanted &quot;Starry Lee abused her powers&quot; in front of her. He pleaded guilty to a contempt charge but not wrongdoing, saying that his persecution had been politically motivated. He was sentenced to three weeks jail on 4 February 2022, the first such conviction since indirect LegCo elections were introduced in 1985. As of 3 May 2022, Cheung is reported to have arrived in Toronto with his family.

<doc id="1211386" wikidata="Q7100529" url="?curid=1211386" title="Order of Omega">
<text>The Order of Omega is an undergraduate Greek society recognizing &quot;fraternity men and women who have attained a high standard of leadership in inter-fraternity activities.&quot; It functions as an adjunct to traditional fraternal organizations rather than a social or professional group &quot;in se&quot;. It is not an academic honor society; a minimum grade point average is only one of six criteria for admission.

== History ==
The Order of Omega was established in 1959 at the University of Miami. It sought to differentiate itself from the long-standing Greek honors society of Phi Beta Kappa by emphasizing community service and inter-Greek communication over academic and nominal honors. At that time, the group adopted as its mark the Greek letter omega in gold on an ivory field. The organization was unique to the University of Miami until, in 1967, a second charter was granted to begin a chapter at University of Southern Mississippi. The group remained exclusive to men until 1977.

In more recent years, the order has emerged as a moot arena in which the fraternity and sorority community can air progressive changes to its member organizations as a whole; the &#x27;dry&#x27; movement eschewing alcohol use among many groups drew a great deal of support from discussion in the early 1980s about how to improve the general reputation of the Fraternity/Sorority community. The stated purposes of the organization are:
* To recognize those fraternity men and women who have attained a high standard of leadership in interfraternity activities, to encourage them to continue along this line, and to inspire others to strive for similar conspicuous attainment;
* To bring together outstanding fraternity men and women to create an organization that will help to mold the sentiment of the institution on questions of local and intercollegiate fraternity affairs.
* To bring together members of the faculty, alumni, and student members of the institution&#x27;s fraternities and sororities on a basis of mutual interest, understanding, and helpfulness;
* To help create an atmosphere where ideas and issues can be discussed openly across Greek lines and to help work out solutions.

At present, the order maintains over 575 chapters at colleges and universities in the United States and Canada.

<doc id="1211389" wikidata="Q527711" url="?curid=1211389" title="Into the West (song)">
<text>&quot;Into the West&quot; is a song performed by Annie Lennox, and the end-credit song of the 2003 film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;. It was written by Lennox, &quot;Return of the King&quot; producer and co-writer Fran Walsh, and composed and co-written by the film&#x27;s composer Howard Shore. The song plays in full during the closing credits of &quot;Return of the King&quot;, although instrumental music from the song (which forms the theme of the Grey Havens) plays at other points during the film itself. “Into the West&quot; was acclaimed by music critics and won Academy Award for Best Original Song, the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.

The song was later covered by New Zealand singers Yulia Townsend and Will Martin and American singer Peter Hollens. In 2014, German a cappella Metal band van Canto performed a cover on their fifth studio album, &quot;Dawn of the Brave&quot;.

==Style==
The original song conceived as the closing credits of the 2003 film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; was &quot;Frodo&#x27;s Song&quot; (which exists only in mock-up form), which became &quot;Use Well the Days,&quot; written by Howard Shore. The song was Frodo singing to Sam as he left Middle Earth and includes Frodo’s lament in the middle of book 6 chapter 9 “The Grey Havens.&quot; Director Peter Jackson felt that the song wasn&#x27;t a good fit as a concluding song for the series, so Shore began to try to write a different closing credits song. As he did, Cameron Duncan, a young Māori New Zealand filmmaker whose work had impressed Jackson and his team, was dying from cancer at 16 years old, and his imminent passing inspired Shore, the film writer Fran Walsh, and the Scottish singer Annie Lennox to write &quot;Into the West.&quot; The first public performance of the song was at Duncan&#x27;s funeral.

The melody of the song, &quot;The Grey Havens&quot;, is one of the musical themes in Shore&#x27;s music for the film, representing the Grey Havens on the western shore of Middle-earth, and the land of Valinor that lies beyond the western sea. It is used subtly when Gandalf describes the vision of Valinor to Pippin in Minas Tirith, and later triumphantly as Sam carries Frodo up Mount Doom. It returns in cellos and humming voices during the Grey Havens scenes. The song itself soon follows, with a prominent guitar solo that opens and closes it and continues to accompany the song throughout, and a heartbeat-like motif played by bodhrán drums underneath.

The lyrics by Fran Walsh are based primarily on Legolas&#x27;s lament at the end of book 6 chapter 4, &quot;The Field of Cormallen&quot; and the parting scene at the Grey Havens and Frodo&#x27;s experience approaching Eressea and Valinor at the end of book 6 chapter 9 &quot;The Grey Havens&quot;. 

==Versions==

The song has multiple versions, in addition to the one used in &quot;Return of the King&quot; (with the orchestral ending). Promos were made available in late November 2003. The versions, with their playing times, are: 

* the album version – 4:35
* the radio edit – 3:59
* the acoustic edit – 4:05
* the acoustic version – 4:39
* the version without the orchestral ending – 4:34
* the film version with the orchestral ending – 5:48

==Accolades==

The song won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 76th Academy Awards, one of &quot;Return of the King&quot;&#x27;s eleven wins. Lennox also performed the song live at the ceremony. Lennox&#x27;s performance was one of several introduced by Liv Tyler, who appeared as Arwen in the film.

==Personnel==

* Annie Lennox – vocals
* John Parricelli – guitar
* Dermot Crehan – hardingfele, fiddle, violin
* Ulrich Herkenhoff – flute

<text>Pedro Luiz Napoleão Chernoviz (Piotr Czerniewicz, September 11, 1812 – August 31, 1882), was a physician, scientific writer and publisher. He was born in Łuków (Poland) and immigrated to Brazil in the mid 19th century on a mission on behalf of King Louis-Philippe of France to Emperor Dom Pedro II of Brazil.

Ostracised for their participation in the failed insurrection for the independence of Poland in 1830-31, Chernoviz, along with many other Polish students and professionals, requested political asylum in France. Chernoviz, who had initiated his medical studies at the Uniwersytet Warszawski, completed them at the Université de Montpellier in 1838. In 1840, he emigrated to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and developed a very successful medical practice. He became a full member of the Imperial Academy of Medicine and was awarded the title of &quot;Cavaleiro da Ordem de Cristo&quot; (Knight of Christ&#x27;s Order) and &quot;Oficial da Ordem da Rosa&quot; (Officer of the Rose&#x27;s Order). In 1846, Chernoviz married Julie Bernard, a Brazilian of French descent, in Rio de Janeiro. The couple had six children. Although Chernoviz returned to France with his family in 1855, he remained active in the medical and scientific communities of Bahia and Rio de Janeiro.

While maintaining an active medical practice, Chernoviz wrote several medical and scientific books, intended for the layman, which became popular throughout Latin America. Some of the most noteworthy are:

* &quot;Formulário e Guia Médico&quot; (Prescription Vademecum and Medical Guide), first published by Edouard and Henri Laemmert in Rio de Janeiro in 1841, reprinted and re-edited numerous times until 1927. The first edition was a single volume with less than 1.000 pages; the second printing of the 19th edition in 1927 had two volumes and together more than 4.000 pages.
* &quot;Diccionário de Medicina Popular e das Ciências Acessórias para Uso das Famílias&quot; (Popular Medicine and Complementary Sciences Dictionary for Family Use), in two volumes, I with 471 and II with 488 pages, also published in Rio de Janeiro in 1842/1843. The sixth and last edition in Portuguese was in 1890 also in two volumes with a total of more than 2.500 pages
* &quot;História Natural para Meninos e Meninas&quot; (Natural History for Boys and Girls), published in Paris in 1860.

The sixth edition of the &quot;Diccionário de Medicina Popular&quot; was initially translated into Spanish in 1894. Chernoviz&#x27;s books were published in Rio de Janeiro by Edouard &amp; Henri Laemmert, Brazilian-German publishers who represented many French authors and firms in Brazil. The 11th and subsequent editions of the &quot;Formulário&quot;, and the 6th and subsequent editions of the &quot;Diccionário&quot; were published in Paris by the firm of A. Roger &amp; F. Chernoviz (the author&#x27;s son, Fernando).

The design, layout, style and illustrations of Chernoviz&#x27;s books resembled those favored in Europe at the time. The medical books were beautifully illustrated with many high quality engravings. The texts included precise descriptions of human organs and their diseases, as well as descriptions of the medications deemed appropriate at the time for these ailments. The pharmacopoeia was not limited to that of mainstream European medicine but made extensive use of indigenous Brazilian remedies. Both the &quot;Formulário e Guia Medico&quot; and the &quot;Diccionário&quot; are frequently quoted today by ethno-biologists and medical researchers. Despite the popularity of Chernoviz&#x27;s published work, little is known about his work methods: notes and record-keeping, filing system, data retrieval, updating of information, and so on, at a time when typewriters were just beginning to become a standard office appliance.

<text>William Sasso (born May 24, 1975) is a Canadian comedian, actor, and podcaster. He is notable for his five seasons as a cast member on &quot;Mad TV&quot; from 1997 to 2002, for starring as Curly in the 2012 film reboot of &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;, and as Mover #1 in &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; (1996). He is also known for his TV roles as Carl Monari in &quot;Less than Perfect&quot; (2003–2006), Doug Martin in &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; (2008–2012), Sgt. Andrew &quot;Andy&quot; Pepper in &quot;Mom&quot; (2013–2021), Ben Burns in &quot;Loudermilk&quot; (2017–2020), Bill Ryan in &quot;United We Fall&quot; (2020), and Jim McAllister in &quot;Young Sheldon&quot; (2022–2024) and &quot;Georgie &amp; Mandy&#x27;s First Marriage&quot; (2024–present).

==Early life==
William Sasso was born on May 24, 1975, in Ladner, British Columbia, to Italian immigrant parents.

==Career==
===&quot;MADtv&quot;===
By the end of its second season (1996–1997), the Fox network sketch comedy television series &quot;MADtv&quot; experienced its first big cast turnover. Three of the show&#x27;s repertory performers (Bryan Callen, Orlando Jones and Artie Lange) left the cast. As a result, in 1997, casting executives at Fox had to cast replacements for the show. Sasso (alongside Alex Borstein and Aries Spears) was selected to join the &quot;MADtv&quot; third-season cast as a regular cast member. In 1999, Sasso fought against World Championship Wrestling&#x27;s Bret Hart.

===2002–present===
After leaving &quot;MADtv&quot;, Sasso&#x27;s television appearances included four seasons as Carl Monari on &quot;Less than Perfect&quot;, as well as a role in &quot;Robson Arms&quot;. He played the role of Fortunio Balducci in &quot;Southland Tales&quot;.

Sasso hosted the 2006 Canadian Comedy Awards in London, Ontario, as well as the festival&#x27;s &quot;Sketch &amp; Improv Showcases&quot;. Additionally, he was a host at the 2005–2006 NHL award ceremony. Sasso appeared on the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;The Chick Chop Flick Shop&quot;. He also appeared in the &quot;Childrens Hospital&quot; episode &quot;Frankfurters&quot;.

Sasso starred in &quot;$h*! My Dad Says&quot;, based on the Twitter feed Shit My Dad Says, created by Justin Halpern. The show premiered in late 2010 and its cancellation was announced on May 15, 2011.

Sasso began posting videos on the online video service Vine, creating a running gag of him violently vomiting lemons without warning.

In 2018, Sasso played Mountie Archambault in the comedy film &quot;Super Troopers 2&quot;. In November 2019, he voiced Mr. Ellingboe in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Klaus&quot;.

From 2022 to spring 2024, Sasso had a supporting role as Jim McCallister in the television series &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;. His portrayal of the character has extended in the sequel spinoff Georgie &amp; Mandy&#x27;s First Marriage which debuted in fall 2024.

In 2012, Sasso created the &quot;Ten Minute Podcast&quot;, which he hosted originally with Bryan Callen and Chris D&#x27;Elia, later replaced by Tommy Blacha and Chad Kultgen. In 2022, Sasso and Kultgen started a different podcast titled &quot;Dudesy&quot;.

<doc id="1211413" wikidata="Q8060755" url="?curid=1211413" title="Yukio Ninagawa">
<text>was a Japanese theatre director, actor and film director, particularly known for his Japanese language productions of the Greek tragedies as well as Shakespeare—he directed eight distinct renditions of &quot;Hamlet.&quot; Ninagawa was also emeritus of the Toho Gakuen College of Drama and Music.

Although most famous abroad for his touring productions of European classics, Ninagawa also directed works based on contemporary writing from Japan, including the Modern Noh plays of Yukio Mishima (which toured to New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center in early summer 2005) and several other plays by Japanese dramatists, including Shūji Terayama and Kunio Shimizu. His production of &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; was performed in England in June 2006, at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford and the Theatre Royal in Plymouth. In 2007 his company participated in the Barbican International Theatre Event (BITE) series at the Barbican Arts Centre in London, with their production of &quot;Coriolanus&quot;.

== Biography ==
In 1955 Ninagawa first joined theatre company &quot;Seihai&quot; (‘young actors’). In 1967 he left the group and set up his own theatre company, &quot;Gendaijin-Gekijo&quot; (‘modern people&#x27;s theatre’). He made his debut as a director in 1969 with &quot;Shinjo afururu keihakusa&quot; (‘genuine frivolity’?). After the disbandment of “Gendaijin-Gekijo” in 1971, in the following year he established a new theatre company called &quot;Sakura-sha&quot; (&#x27;cherry blossom company&#x27;), which once again resulted in disbandment three years later, 1974.

At the same time, the year 1974 has become the turning point for Ninagawa, when the then &quot;Toho&quot; theatre producer Tadao Nakane invited him to direct larger productions, and as a result he came to work on a Shakespeare play for the very first time - &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Since then, he has become one of the most feted directors in the theatre world. In 1998 he vowed to direct all of Shakespeare&#x27;s works, and in the year 2000 he directed the mammoth &quot;Greeks&quot;, a performance lasting for a total of ten and a half hours.

Beginning in 1983 when he directed &quot;Medea&quot;, Ninagawa continued to do overseas tours every year, adding to his high reputation in Europe, the US and Canada. He was invited to present a play each year in London, for three years in a row – &quot;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; in 1996, &quot;Shintokumaru&quot; (name of the male protagonist) in 1997, and &quot;Hamlet&quot; in 1998. In addition he collaborated with the Royal Shakespeare Company from 1999 to 2000 and presented &quot;King Lear&quot; at London and Stratford-upon-Avon.

Ninagawa won many awards in Japan, and he was awarded honorary doctorates in the UK by the University of Edinburgh (1992) and Plymouth University (2009). He is the father of the photographer and film director Mika Ninagawa.

In his theatrical company Ninagawa Studio (Ninagawa Company), he continued to produce experimental productions with young people. In 2006, he founded a new theatrical group for people over 55 years old called &quot;Saitama Gold Theatre&quot; which is based at Saitama Arts Theatre.

Ninagawa died of pneumonia at a hospital in Tokyo on May 12, 2016, aged 80.

<text>&quot;The Eyes of Texas&quot; is the school spirit song of the University of Texas at Austin. It is set to the tune of &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Working on the Railroad&quot;. Students, faculty, staff, and alumni of the university sing the song at Texas Longhorns sports games, before the fireworks and other events.

==History==

John Sinclair wrote the Texas-specific song lyrics in 1903 to the tune of the original folk song &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Working on the Railroad&quot;, which was published nine years earlier in 1894. Sinclair was the editor of the Cactus yearbook, a UT band member, and a member of the Glee Club, and he wrote the lyrics per the request of band member Lewis Johnson. Johnson was also the program director of the Varsity Minstrel Show that raised funds for the university track team.

The lyrics are said to be intended to poke fun at university president William Lambdin Prather. At the time, the University of Texas had fewer than a thousand students, and there were weekly convocations of the students at which Prather would often speak. Prather customarily concluded his speeches by saying, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, the eyes of Texas are upon you,&quot; an admonition similar to one Robert E. Lee was said to have used while President of Washington College in Virginia, meaning that the state of Texas was watching and expecting the students to go out and do great things. Prather had attended Washington College (later Washington &amp; Lee University), became a friend of Lee, and served as a pallbearer at Lee&#x27;s funeral in 1870.

The song made its public debut as the last number at a Glee Club minstrel show, where it was met by the student audience with laughter and applause as a joke on President Prather&#x27;s admonition. Prather too was in attendance, and enjoyed the song and promoted its usage. He died in 1905, and the song was played at his funeral.

The song is sung at momentous occasions such as graduation and even solemn occasions such as funerals. Led by the Longhorn Marching Band, it was sung at the July 14, 2007, funeral of First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, an alumna of the University of Texas. When singing the song, participants generally raise their right arm with their hand making the Hook &#x27;em Horns symbol of The university. A recording of &quot;The Eyes of Texas&quot; was played over the Rose Bowl public-address system when the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Buffalo Bills to win Super Bowl XXVII, while Madison Square Garden organist Ray Castoldi played it when the Houston Rockets defeated the New York Knicks in the seventh game of the 1994 NBA Finals to clinch Texas&#x27; first NBA championship.

Highway rest stops through the state feature road signs stating that &quot;The Eyes of Texas are upon You!&quot; These signs feature a silhouette of a Texas Ranger, encouraging motorists to call 9-1-1 to report criminal activity.

&quot;The Eyes of Texas&quot; was once the fight song of the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). In 1920, UTEP was known as College of Mines and Metallurgy of the University of Texas (sometimes referred to as &quot;Texas College of Mines&quot;, or &quot;TCM&quot;). As a branch of the University of Texas, the song automatically became TCM&#x27;s fight song. The university replaced it with Marty Robbins&#x27;s &quot;El Paso&quot; in 1985.

&quot;The Eyes of Texas&quot; is also sung at the graduation of University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). UTMB is the first, but not the only state medical school in Texas.

== Lyrics ==
The lyrics are set to the tune of &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Working on the Railroad&quot;. A comparison of the lyrics of that song and &quot;The Eyes of Texas&quot; shows the nature of the parody in the latter:

I’ve Been Working on the Railroad

I’ve been working on the railroad,&lt;br&gt;
All the live-long day.&lt;br&gt;
I’ve been working on the railroad,&lt;br&gt;
Just to pass the time away.&lt;br&gt;
Do you hear the whistle blowing?&lt;br&gt;
Rise up so early in the morn!&lt;br&gt;
Do you hear the captain calling,&lt;br&gt;
“Dinah blow your horn”?

The Eyes of Texas Are Upon You

The Eyes of Texas are upon you,&lt;br&gt;
All the live-long day.&lt;br&gt;
The Eyes of Texas are upon you,&lt;br&gt;
You cannot get away.&lt;br&gt;
Do not think you can escape them,&lt;br&gt;
From night ‘til early in the morn.&lt;br&gt;
The Eyes of Texas are upon you,&lt;br&gt;
’til Gabriel blows his horn.

It is common practice that the last line, &quot;Til Gabriel blows his horn&quot;, is sung and played to a slightly slower tempo than the rest of the song. Students, faculty, staff, athletes, and alumni punctuate each beat of the last line with a small chopping motion of their right raised arm and &quot;Hook &#x27;Em&quot; hand sign.

==Usage in popular culture==
The song was sung each morning by school children in Castro County, Texas at the Hart Elementary and the Dimmett High School every morning before classes after the Pledge of Allegiance. This was as early as 1926 to 1938, according to a student, Joe Erwin Stewart, who attended between those dates.

== Controversy ==
The lyrics of the song have been interpreted as embracing the &quot;Lost Cause&quot; ideology, which advocates the belief that the practice of slavery in the Antebellum South was just and moral. This interpretation was based on a tradition that held that UT President William Prather had adapted the phrase from General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s purported use of the phrase &quot;The eyes of the South are upon you&quot; to advocate Lost Cause nostalgia. Prather had attended Washington College, now Washington and Lee University, whose president was Robert E. Lee. All of these interpretations predate research from a report that 
found &quot;no primary source has been found connecting the phrase as something that Lee used&quot; and additionally found no evidence in Washington &amp; Lee University records &quot;that Lee ever closed an address to the students with the phrase&quot;. However, a report by UT Austin history professor Alberto Martinez states that President William Prather&#x27;s use of the phrase was inspired by a line spoken by confederate general Maxcy Gregg about Robert E Lee. While no primary source &quot;has been found connecting the phrase as something that Lee used&quot;, four independent secondary accounts, by both of William Prather&#x27;s children, T.U. Taylor (who recounted the story multiple times in the decades before his 1938 memoir), and Jim Cannon have all stated that Prather&#x27;s inspiration for the phrase was General Robert E. Lee. The phrase &quot;The Eyes of Texas&quot; was in use well before the Civil War with regard to Texas itself. In a column entitled &quot;A Campfire Story&quot; in the Highland Messenger of May 26, 1843, a report on early military discipline in Texas shortly after the Battle of San Jacinto, a colonel is said to have addressed his troops, saying &quot;The eyes of Texas, the eyes of her bravest officers, &quot;my&quot; eyes are upon you.&quot;

In June 2020, several players on the University of Texas at Austin football team requested that the university replace the song with one &quot;without racist undertones&quot;. In response to the players&#x27; request, African-American former University of Texas football players Earl Campbell and Ricky Williams spoke out to keep the song in place as UT&#x27;s alma mater.

Campbell&#x27;s comments on &quot;The Eyes of Texas&quot; are as follows:

Williams was also quoted as saying:

Following those requests, interim UT president Jay Hartzell announced that the song would remain as the alma mater but that the university would work to &quot;reclaim and redefine&quot; the song by openly acknowledging its history.

In October 2020, the University of Texas band was unable to perform the song at football games, due to a lack of members willing to play it. The athletic department stated that it would play a recorded version of the song prior to sports events.

A March 2021 investigative report by &quot;The Texas Tribune&quot; published snippets of alumni and donor emails to president Hartzell. In these emails, the alumni and donors demanded that Hartzell take a stronger stance supporting &quot;The Eyes of Texas&quot; and threatened to cancel their financial contributions. In a statement, Hartzell apologized for the &quot;abhorrent and hateful&quot; emails from some of the alumni. The March 2021 report titled &quot;The Eyes of Texas History Committee Report&quot; confirmed the song&#x27;s minstrel show &quot;debuted in a racist setting, exceedingly common for the time&quot;, but found no racist intent.

The university announced in April 2021 that by 2022 there would be a new separate band for students who didn&#x27;t want to play &quot;The Eyes of Texas&quot;. However, this announcement was met with pushback, as opponents argued that forcing students into a different band was an attempt to create a &quot;separate but equal&quot; alternative that violated constitutional equal protection standards.

On September 3, 2021, the Texas chapter of the NAACP filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education against the University of Texas for its continued use of the school song. The federal civil rights complaint alleged that &quot;Black students, athletes, band members, faculty and alumni [were] being subjected to violations of the Civil Rights Act and a hostile campus environment over the &#x27;offensive&#x27;, &#x27;disrespectful&#x27; and &#x27;aggressive&#x27; use of the song&quot;.

<doc id="1211423" wikidata="Q3112580" url="?curid=1211423" title="Government of South Australia">
<text>The Government of South Australia, also referred to as the South Australian Government or the SA Government, is the executive branch of the state of South Australia. It is modelled on the Westminster system, meaning that the highest ranking members of the executive are drawn from an elected state parliament. Specifically the party or coalition which holds a majority of the House of Assembly (the lower chamber of the South Australian Parliament).

==History==
South Australia was established via letters patent by King William IV in February of 1836, pursuant to the &quot;South Australian Colonisation Act 1834&quot;. Governance in the colony was organised according to the principles developed by Edward Wakefield, where settlement would be conducted by free settlers rather than convicts. Therefore governance would be divided between the Governor who was responsible to the British Crown and tasked with the authority to make laws, and Colonisation Commissioners who were responsible for the sale of land to settlers to fund the colony. This structure was found to be troublesome as the commission had control of the funds rather than the Governor, and as a result in 1838, the Governor was appointed Resident Commissioner to resolve conflict.

In 1842 the British Parliament reorganised the structure of South Australia&#x27;s governance by abolishing the Colonisation Commission and creating a Legislative Council of eight people (including the Governor) to exercise the legislative power of the colony. In 1850 the British Parliament passed the &quot;Australian Constitutions Act 1850&quot;, which empowered the Legislative Council to alter its own composition. The Legislative Council responded by passing the &quot;Constitution Act 1856&quot;, which created a bicameral parliament and an executive responsible to it. Boyle Finniss was appointed the first Premier of South Australia as part of an interrim executive until elections to the new Parliament could be held in 1857.

The executive comprised ministers selected from the Parliament and the Governor was no longer able to unilaterally make most decisions. The new Parliament and Executive took over almost all of the powers held by the Secretary of State for the Colonies regarding the appointment to official positions in the colony, immigration, and customs matters. 

When federation occurred in 1901, South Australia became a state of the Commonwealth of Australia under the Constitution of Australia, which regulates the South Australia&#x27;s relationship with the Commonwealth. The state ceded certain executive powers (such as defence and customs), but retained powers in all matters not withdrawn from them or in conflict with the Commonwealth.

In 1934, the &quot;Constitution Act 1856&quot; was repealed and replaced with the &quot;Constitution Act 1934&quot;, which remains in force today with amendments.

==Structure==
South Australia is governed according to the principles of the Westminster system, a form of parliamentary government based on the model of the United Kingdom.

Executive power rests formally with the Executive Council, which consists of the governor and senior ministers. The Governor plays an important practical role under the state&#x27;s constitution and fulfils a symbolic role as local head of state. The Governor is appointed by the King and, for most practical purposes, exercises His Majesty&#x27;s powers in the state. These include the fundamental powers to dissolve Parliament, call elections and appoint and dismiss ministers. The Governor in Executive Council is the formal mechanism for administration of the state. Many of the decisions made by Cabinet do not have legal effect until they are signed by the Governor in Executive Council. All items for the approval of the Governor in Executive Council must first be considered by Cabinet, with the exception of the assent to Acts. When exercising a statutory power, the Governor must act with the advice and consent of Executive Council. All ministers are ex officio members of Executive Council. 

In practice, executive power is exercised by the premier of South Australia and the Cabinet of South Australia, who advise the Governor. The Cabinet comprises 15 ministers, headed by the Premier, who are either members of the House of Assembly or the Legislative Council. Cabinet is responsible for determining policies which are submitted to Parliament.

==Current ministry==
As of 15 April 2024, the ministry of the South Australian Government comprised the following 14 Labor Party members and 1 Independent member:

==Government agencies==
The South Australian Government is divided into departments or attached offices to those departments. Departments and their attached offices are overseen by a government minister who is a member of the Parliament. However some departments or attached offices may be afforded a degree of independence by statute and may only be subject to ministerial direction in specific circumstances (for example the Audit Office or the Electoral Commission). There are currently 21 departments, though not all of them use the word department in their title.

<text>The Tasmanian Government is the executive branch of the Australian state of Tasmania. The leader of the party or coalition with the confidence of the House of Assembly, the lower house of the Parliament of Tasmania, is invited by the governor of Tasmania to form the executive. The governor appoints the premier of Tasmania.

Since 8 April 2022, the premier of Tasmania has been Jeremy Rockliff, leader of the Liberal Party. The current ministry of Tasmania is the Second Rockliff ministry.

==Constitutional framework==
Tasmania is governed according to the principles of the Westminster system, a form of parliamentary responsible government based on the model of the United Kingdom. Legislative power rests with the bicameral Parliament of Tasmania, which consists of the governor of Tasmania, and the two chambers: the Legislative Council and the House of Assembly.

Executive power rests formally with the Executive Council, which consists of the governor and senior ministers, and informally called the Cabinet. In practice, executive power is exercised by the premier of Tasmania upon the advice of the Cabinet, who are appointed by the governor, but who hold office by virtue of their ability to command the support of a majority of members of the House of Assembly.

Judicial power is exercised by the Supreme Court of Tasmania and a system of subordinate courts. As with all states, upon federation, Tasmania accepted the authority of the federal High Court of Australia to overrule the state judiciary.

<text>The Queensland Government is the state government of Queensland, Australia, a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. Government is formed by the party or coalition that has gained a majority in the state Legislative Assembly, with the governor officially appointmenting office-holders. The first government of Queensland was formed in 1859 when Queensland separated from New South Wales under the state constitution. Since federation in 1901, Queensland has been a state of Australia, with the Constitution of Australia regulating its relationship with the federal government. 

Queensland&#x27;s system of government is influenced by the Westminster system and Australia&#x27;s federal system of government. Executive acts are given legal force through the actions of the governor of Queensland (the representative of the monarch, Charles III), although the governor in practice performs only ceremonial duties, with de facto executive power lying with the Cabinet. The Cabinet is the government&#x27;s chief policy-making organ which consists of the premier and all ministers. Each minister is responsible for exercising policy and legislation through the respective state government department.

The headquarters for each government department are located in the capital city of Brisbane, with most government departments based at 1 William Street, a purpose-built skyscraper in Brisbane CBD.

==Executive and judicial powers==

Queensland is governed according to the principles of the Westminster system, a form of parliamentary government based on the model of the United Kingdom. Legislative power rests with the Parliament of Queensland, which consists of the King, represented by the Governor of Queensland, and the one house, the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. De jure executive power rests formally with the Executive Council, which consists of the Governor and senior minister, but is exercised de facto by the state cabinet.

The Governor, as representative of the Crown, is the formal repository of power, which is exercised by him or her on the advice of the Premier of Queensland and the Cabinet. The Premier and Ministers are appointed by the Governor, and hold office by virtue of their ability to command the support of a majority of members of the Legislative Assembly. Judicial power is exercised by the Supreme Court of Queensland and a system of subordinate courts, but the High Court of Australia and other federal courts have overriding jurisdiction on matters which fall under the ambit of the Australian Constitution.

==Current Ministry==

On 27 October 2024, Crisafulli announced that he and Deputy Premier Jarrod Bleijie would be sworn in as an interim two-person cabinet, however which portfolios will be assigned to each of them is unknown. Crisafulli and Bleijie were formally sworn in by Governor Jeanette Young on 28 October. On 1 November 2024, the full ministry was formally sworn in, as follows:

<text>The Government of New South Wales, also known as the NSW Government, is the executive state government of New South Wales, Australia. The government comprises 11 portfolios, led by a ministerial department and supported by several agencies. There are also a number of independent agencies that fall under a portfolio but remain at arms-length for political reasons, such as the Independent Commission Against Corruption and Electoral Commission. The state Executive Council, consisting of the governor and senior ministers, exercises the executive authority through the relevant portfolio.

The current government is held by the state Labor Party, led by Premier Chris Minns. Minns succeeded Dominic Perrottet from the Liberal Party on 28 March 2023 following the state election.

==Ministries==
The following individuals serve as government ministers, appointed by the Governor, on behalf of the Monarch, and at the recommendation of the Premier. The full ministry was announced on 4 April 2023 and was sworn in the following day on 5 April.

<doc id="1211429" wikidata="Q670394" url="?curid=1211429" title="Nathan Hines">
<text>Nathan Hines (born 29 November 1976) is an Australian-born former rugby union and rugby league footballer. He played at international level for Scotland, winning 77 caps, and at club level for Edinburgh, Perpignan, and Clermont Auvergne among others. He also played rugby league.

==Early life==
Hines was born in Wagga Wagga, NSW. He attended Berkeley Vale Community High School from 1989 to 1994 and was a regular feature in the school&#x27;s first XIII rugby league team. He played his club football for the Berkeley Vale Panthers Junior Rugby League Club and was part of the club&#x27;s first ever Premiership winning side (U/15s – defeated Woy Woy in 1991) playing alongside future NRL player Paul Stringer.

Hines attended Berkeley Vale Community High School, from 1989 to 1994 with Stringer where they played in the first XIII together. This is the same school that produced Wallaby star Adam Ashley-Cooper and Olympic marathon runner and City to Surf winner Martin Dent. Hines was also part of the Premiership winning Ourimbah Razorbacks U/19s Rugby Union side, the same club where Ashley-Cooper also played.

==Club career==
Hines won league and cup titles with Gala RFC, before signing for Edinburgh. He moved from Edinburgh to Perpignan in the 2005 off-season.

At the end of the 2008–09 Top 14 season, Hines chose to tour South Africa with the British &amp; Irish Lions rather than take part in the Top 14 play-offs with Perpignan.

On 4 July 2009, it was reported in the French media that Hines would be joining 2008–09 Heineken Cup winners Leinster for the 2009–10 season. On the Lions tour, Hines played in five tour matches, but was not selected for any of the Tests against South Africa. Hines became a regular starter and a crowd favourite for Leinster, he won the 2010–11 Heineken Cup with the Irish province.

Hines signed for Clermont Auvergne in 2011. On 20 January 2014, Hines signed for Sale Sharks to compete in the English Aviva Premiership on a two-year contract from the 2014–15 season.

==International career==
In 2000, Hines made his Test debut for Scotland in New Zealand but two serious injuries claimed nearly 18 months of his career. He qualified to play for Scotland through his grandfather George Nairne who was from Govan. He became the first Scotland player to be sent off in a Test match when he was dismissed against the USA Eagles in 2002 for punching replacement hooker/flanker Dan Anderson. He was a big part of the Scotland squad for the 2003 Rugby World Cup, which was held in his country of birth.

In the 2005 Six Nations Championship game against Wales at Murrayfield on 13 March, Hines came on in the second half and helped restore some pride, but his try was disallowed for lack of grounding. He was alleged to be discontented with the Scotland coaches (Matt Williams and Willie Anderson) and declared his retirement from international rugby.
However, with the firing of the previous coaching regime and the appointment of his previous club coach, Frank Hadden, as Scotland coach, Hines returned to the squad. He made his reappearance as a substitute in the 2006 Six Nations win over England at Murrayfield. Hines toured South Africa with the British &amp; Irish Lions in 2009 and featured heavily in the midweek matches but did not participate in the Tests.

On 9 November 2011 Hines announced his retirement from international rugby with immediate effect. This meant he started and ended his Scotland career at Eden Park, Auckland. Hines won a total of 77 caps and scored two tries (10 points).

==Coaching career==
On 6 May 2015, Hines joined the Scotland coaching staff as a Resource Coach, reuniting with his former coach Vern Cotter.

<text>The Victoria State Government, also referred to as the Victorian Government, is the executive government of the Australian state of Victoria.

As a parliamentary constitutional monarchy, the State Government was first formed in 1851 when Victoria first gained responsible government. The Constitution of Australia regulates the relationship between the Victorian Government and the Commonwealth level of government, and cedes legislative and judicial supremacy to the federal government on conflicting matters.

The Victoria State Government enforces acts passed by the parliament through government departments, statutory authorities, and other public agencies. The government is formally presided over by the governor, who exercises executive authority granted by the state&#x27;s constitution through the Executive Council, a body consisting of senior cabinet ministers. In reality, both the governor and the Executive Council are largely ceremonial, with the premier and ministers having control over policy, appointments, and other executive orders made by the governor.

==Executive branch==

The Government of Victoria operates under the principles of the Westminster system as adapted in the Australian Constitution and of responsible government. Both systems and principles of governance have developed out of the United Kingdom, to which Victoria was previously a colony.

Executive power rests formally with the Executive Council, which consists of the governor and senior ministers. In practice, executive power is exercised by the premier, appointed by the governor, provided they can command the support of a majority of members of the Legislative Assembly. The Cabinet is the de facto chief policy making organ and consists of the premier and all ministers.

<text>Vincenzo Viviani (April 5, 1622 – September 22, 1703) was an Italian mathematician and scientist. He was a pupil of Torricelli and Galileo.

==Biography==
Vincenzo Viviani was born in Florence to the nobles Jacopo di Michelangelo Viviani and Maria Alamanno del Nente. While attending a Jesuit school Viviani studied the humanities. Following the study of humanities, Viviani turned to mathematics. He studied geometry under the instruction of Galilean follower Clemente Settimi. It was through Clemente that Viviani would gain recognition and meet Clemente&#x27;s instructor, Tuscan Court mathematician Famiano Michelini. In 1638, Michelini initiated the Grand Duke Ferdinand II de’ Medici&#x27;s interest in Viviani and arranged their introduction in Livorno where Viviani would demonstrate his abilities. The Grand Duke offered Viviani a monthly salary to continue his education and introduced him to Galileo, whose deteriorating health required a capable and competent assistant. Later that year, Viviani was able to expand his knowledge over the philosophy of nature while assisting Galileo on &quot;Two new sciences&quot;, in which Galileo studied the acceleration of free bodies along an inclined plane. Their frequent exchange over the subject inspired Galileo to elaborate on the mathematical theory and complete his demonstration on free bodies that would establish its connection to nature. Viviani would later use similar applications of mathematics in nature during a collaboration with Nicolaus Steno.

In 1639, Viviani moved to Galileo&#x27;s home in Arcetri to assist him in his studies before they were joined by Evangelista Torricelli in 1641. Apart from being Galileo&#x27;s disciple, Viviani became a pupil of Evangelista Torricelli and worked on physics and geometry. Viviani was the last disciple of Galileo until Galileo&#x27;s death in 1642.

After Torricelli&#x27;s 1647 death, Viviani was appointed to fill his position at the Accademia dell&#x27;Arte del Disegno in Florence. Viviani was also one of the first members of the Grand Duke&#x27;s experimental academy, the Accademia del Cimento, when it was created a decade later.

Apart from his own career and endeavors, Viviani worked throughout his life to preserve the contributions and life of Galileo. In 1654, Cardinal Leopoldo de’ Medici tasked Viviani with gathering material in order to write a biography about Galileo&#x27;s life and work. Carlo Manolessi also recruited Viviani to assist him and others in creating a compilation of Galileo&#x27;s work and coordinating the frontispiece for Galileo&#x27;s publication.

From 1655 to 1656, Viviani edited the first edition of Galileo&#x27;s collected works. Viviani tried to publish an account of the life of Galileo, but claimed that his efforts were halted by the Catholic church although this claim has been challenged.

One of the primary interests of Viviani was the study of the mathematics of the ancients. Viviani spent much of his life restoring the works of Aristaeus the Elder and Apollonius.

In 1660, Viviani and Giovanni Alfonso Borelli conducted an experiment to determine the speed of sound. Timing the difference between the seeing the flash and hearing the sound of a cannon shot at a distance, they calculated a value of 350 meters per second (m/s), considerably better than the previous value of 478 m/s obtained by Pierre Gassendi. The currently accepted value is 331.29 m/s at 0 °C or 340.29 m/s at sea level. It has also been claimed that in 1661 he experimented with the rotation of pendulums, 190 years before the famous demonstration by Foucault. Specifically, during experiments with a pendulum, he observed it to veer to one side. He did not make a connection with the rotation of Earth. As it was an unwanted effect, he eliminated it by hanging the pendulum with two ropes.

By 1666, Viviani started to receive many job offers as his reputation as a mathematician grew. That same year, Louis XIV of France offered him a position at the Académie Royale and John II Casimir of Poland offered Viviani a post as his astronomer. Fearful of losing Viviani, the Grand Duke appointed him First Mathematician of the Tuscan Court. The position was previously held by Galileo, whose death resulted in Torricelli&#x27;s appointment to the position, followed by Viviani years after Torricelli&#x27;s death. Viviani accepted this post and turned down his other offers. From 1666 to 1667, Viviani guided Nicolaus Steno on the geometrical propositions of anatomical figures and dissections of shark muscle fibers. The shark dissection figures in &quot;Elementorum myologiae specimen, seu musculi descriptio geometri&quot; demonstrated the possible functions of anatomical structures by combining anatomy with geometry while observing muscle contractions.

In 1687, he published a book on engineering, &quot;Discorso intorno al difendersi da&#x27; riempimenti e dalle corrosione de&#x27; fiumi&quot;.

Upon his death, Viviani left an almost completed work on the resistance of solids, which was subsequently completed and published by Luigi Guido Grandi.

In 1737, the Church finally allowed Galileo to be reburied in a grave with an elaborate monument. The monument that was created in the church of Santa Croce was constructed with the help of funds left by Viviani for that specific purpose. Viviani&#x27;s own remains were moved to Galileo&#x27;s new grave as well.

The lunar crater Viviani is named after him.

==Inscriptions==

In Florence, Viviani had Galileo&#x27;s life and achievements written in Latin on the façade of his palace, on huge stone scrolls. The palace was then renamed Palazzo dei Cartelloni.

<doc id="1211445" wikidata="Q953638" url="?curid=1211445" title="Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome">
<text>Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is a rare X-linked recessive disease characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), immune deficiency, and bloody diarrhea (secondary to the thrombocytopenia). It is also sometimes called the eczema-thrombocytopenia-immunodeficiency syndrome in keeping with Aldrich&#x27;s original description in 1954. The WAS-related disorders of X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT) and X-linked congenital neutropenia (XLN) may present with similar but less severe symptoms and are caused by mutations of the same gene.

==Signs and symptoms==
WAS occurs most often in males due to its X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance, affecting between 1 in 10 males per million. The first signs are usually petechiae and bruising, resulting from a low platelet count (i.e. thrombocytopenia). Spontaneous nose bleeds and bloody diarrhea are also common and eczema typically develops within the first month of life. Recurrent bacterial infections typically develop by three months of age. The majority of children with WAS develop at least one autoimmune disorder, and cancers (mainly lymphoma and leukemia) develop in up to a third of patients. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels are reduced, IgA and IgE are elevated, and IgG levels can be normal, reduced, or elevated. In addition to thrombocytopenia, WAS patients have abnormally small platelets (i.e. microthrombocytes) and ~30% also have elevated eosinophil counts (i.e. eosinophilia).

==Pathophysiology==
The microthrombocytes seen in WAS patients have only been observed in one other condition, ARPC1B deficiency. In both conditions the defective platelets are thought to be removed from circulation by the spleen and/or liver, leading to low platelet counts. WAS patients have increased susceptibility to infections, particularly of the ears and sinuses, and this immune deficiency has been linked to decreased antibody production and the inability of immune T cells to effectively combat infection.

=== Genetics ===

WAS is associated with mutations in a gene on the short arm of the X chromosome (Xp11.23) that was originally termed the Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein gene and is officially known as &quot;WAS&quot; (Gene ID: 7454). X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT) is also linked to pathogenic variants in the &quot;WAS&quot; gene, although some variants tend to be more strongly associated with XLT versus others that are more associated with WAS. The rare disorder X-linked neutropenia has also been linked to a specific subset of &quot;WAS&quot; mutations.

The protein product of &quot;WAS&quot; is known as WASp. It contains 502 amino acids and is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells (the cells in the bone marrow that develop into blood cells). The main function of WASp is to activate actin polymerization by serving as a nucleation-promoting factor (NPF) for the Arp2/3 complex, which generates branched actin filaments. Several proteins can serve as NPFs, and it has been observed that in WAS platelets the Arp2/3 complex functions normally, indicating that WASp is not required for its activation in platelets. In T-cells, WASp is important because it is known to be activated via T-cell receptor signaling pathways to induce cortical actin cytoskeleton rearrangements that are responsible for forming the immunological synapse.

The severity of the symptoms produced by pathogenic variants in the &quot;WAS&quot; gene generally correlates with their effects on WASp. Missense variants generally are associated with less severe disease than truncating variants that produce no protein due to nonsense-mediated decay. However, this correlation is not perfect, and sometimes the same variant can be seen both in XLT and in WAS (sometimes within two different members of the same family), a concept in genetics referred to as variable expressivity. Although autoimmune disease and malignancy may occur in both conditions, patients with loss of WASp are at higher risk. A defect in the CD43 molecule has also been found in WAS patients. CD43, a transmembrane sialoglycoprotein also known as a leukosialin, is part of a greater complex involved in T-cell activation and acts as a sensitive indicator of abnormal, malignant B cell populations. Defects in this molecule may be detrimental to WAS patients, who are at a much higher risk of autoimmune diseases that may be exacerbated in later-detected B-cell lymphomas.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis can be made on the basis of clinical findings, the peripheral blood smear, and low immunoglobulin levels. Typically, IgM levels are low, IgA levels are elevated, and IgE levels may be elevated; paraproteins are occasionally observed. Skin immunologic testing (allergy testing) may reveal hyposensitivity. Individuals with Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome however are at higher risk for severe food allergies. Not all patients have a positive family history of the disorder; new mutations do occur. Often, leukemia may be suspected on the basis of low platelets and infections, and bone marrow biopsy may be performed. Decreased levels of WASp are typically observed. The current gold standard for diagnosis is DNA sequence analysis, which can detect WAS and the related disorders XLT and XLN in 95% of patients and carriers.

===Classification===
Jin et al. (2004) employ a numerical grading of severity: This score, which ranges from 0 to 5, may have clinical utility for predicting disease severity. Those with higher WAS scores (e.g., 5) at younger ages (e.g., age less than 5 years old), are thought to be at highest risk for increased morbidity and mortality related to their condition. As individuals can develop more WAS-related symptoms (e.g. autoimmune disease, malignancy) with age, one&#x27;s WAS score can increase over time. A lower WAS score may be more compatible with conservative management versus higher WAS scores that may favor intervention with treatments such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
==Treatment==
Hematopoietic stem cell transplant

Treatment of Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome depends on the severity of the disease. WAS is primarily a disorder of the blood-forming tissues, so in cases of severe disease (WAS score 3–5) the only widely available curative treatment currently available is a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). In this procedure stem cells are harvested from umbilical cord blood, bone marrow, or peripheral blood following treatment with medications that cause stem cells to leave the bone marrow and circulate systemically. The best outcomes are with HLA-identical or similar donors (often siblings). In cases of milder disease the potential benefits of HCT (&gt;90% probability of cure if transplant occurs before age two) must be considered in the context of non-trivial risks presented by the procedure itself and the potential need for lifelong immunosuppression to prevent graft-versus-host disease. Generally outcomes are better if HCT occurs prior to the development of autoimmune disease or malignancy, however there are risks associated with chemotherapy (needed to make room for the new stem cells) especially in young infants (risk of a second cancer, or infertility).

Bleeding complications

Otherwise WAS treatment is focused on managing symptoms and preventing complications. The greatest mortality risk in WAS before age 30 is from bleeding so aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may interfere with already compromised platelet function should generally be avoided. Circumcision, as well as elective surgeries, should generally be deferred in males with thrombocytopenia until after HCT if possible. Protective helmets can help protect children from life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage (brain bleed) which could result from head injuries. Patients may require platelet transfusions when there is extreme bloodloss (such as during surgery) or for very low platelets splenectomy (removal of the spleen) may also be lifesaving. However, splenectomy is generally considered palliative and is not universally recommended in WAS because it can increase the risk of life-threatening infections. Post-splenectomy patients will require lifelong antibiotic prophyllaxis to prevent infections. Study of eltrombopag, a thrombopoietic agent used to increase platelets in immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), in WAS concluded that although it increased platelet numbers it failed to increase platelet activation in most patients. It has since been proposed the eltrombopag may be used to bridge to HCT in patients with severe thrombocytopenia to normalize platelet numbers without transfusions and decrease bleeding events. Anemia from bleeding may require iron supplementation or blood transfusion. Regular surveillance of blood counts is recommended.

Infections and autoimmune disease

For patients with frequent infections, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or subcutaneous immunoglobulins can be regularly scheduled to boost the immune system. Adequacy of IVIG replacement can be assessed via periodic lab draws. WAS patients with immune system compromise may benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis, for example by taking trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent &quot;Pneumocystis jirovecii&quot;-related pneumonia. Similarly, prophylactic antibiotic use may also be considered in patients with recurrent bacterial sinus or lung infections. When there are signs or symptoms of an infection, prompt and thorough evaluation is important including blood cultures to guide therapy (often IV antibiotics). Live vaccines (such as MMR or rotavirus) should be avoided during routine childhood vaccination. Inactivated vaccines may be given safely but may not provide protective levels of immunity. Eczema is generally treated with topical steroids, and if chronic skin infections exacerbate eczema an antibiotic may also be given. Autoimmune disease is managed with judicious use of appropriate immunosuppressants.

Gene therapy

For severely affected males without an HLA-matched donor, studies of correcting Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome with gene therapy using a lentivirus are underway. Proof-of-principle for successful hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy has been provided for patients with Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome. In July 2013 the Italian San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (HSR-TIGET) reported that three children with Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome showed significant improvement (improved platelet counts, immune functiona, and clinical symptoms) 20–30 months after being treated with a genetically modified lentivirus. In April 2015 results from a follow-up British and French trial six out of seven individuals showed improvement of immune function and clinical symptoms an average of 27 months after treatment with gene therapy. Importantly, neither study showed evidence of leukemic proliferation following treatment, a complication of early attempts at gene therapy using a retroviral vector. It is unknown why these gene therapies did not restore normal platelet numbers, but gene therapy treatment was still associated with transfusion-independence and a significant reduction in bleeding events. A version of this treatment, OTL-103, is being developed by Orchard Therapeutics and () is undergoing Phase I/II clinical trials.

==Prognosis==
Outcomes from Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome are variable and depend on how severely an individual is affected (the WAS score may be used to assess disease severity). The milder end of the disease spectrum associated with the &quot;WAS&quot; gene is referred to as X-linked neutropenia or X-linked thrombocytopenia, and the latter is thought to have a normal life expectancy with reports of minimally affected males surviving into their seventh decade without treatment. Traditionally however Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome has been associated with premature death from causes including bleeding, infections, or malignancy. Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome is a condition with variable expressivity, meaning that even within the same family some may exhibit only chronic thrombocytopenia while others experience severe, life-threatening complications of Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome in infancy or childhood. Given symptoms often progress with age, it is challenging to predict how affected a newly diagnosed infant will eventually be. There is some genotype-phenotype correlation, with most individuals with X-linked thrombocytopenia having missense variants in the &quot;WAS&quot; gene versus 86.5% of those that make no WAS protein having the classic Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome phenotype. Overall the prognosis for individuals with Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome has improved considerably over the past decades due to earlier diagnoses and more access to treatments.

==Epidemiology==
The estimated incidence of Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome in the United States is one in 250,000 live male births. While still a rare disease, this makes it more common than many genetic immunodeficiency syndromes such as hyper-IgM syndrome or SCID, which have an estimated incidence of about one in 1,000,000 live births, and Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome is thought to account for 1.2% of all inherited immunodeficiencies in the United States. WAS occurs worldwide and is not known to be more common in any particular ethnic group.

==History==
The syndrome is named after Dr. Alfred Wiskott (1898–1978), a German pediatrician who first noticed the syndrome in 1937, and Dr. Robert Anderson Aldrich (1917–1998), an American pediatrician who described the disease in a family of Dutch-Americans in 1954. Wiskott described three brothers with a similar disease, whose sisters were unaffected. In 2006, a German research group analyzed family members of Wiskott&#x27;s three cases, and surmised they probably shared a novel frameshift mutation of the first exon of the &quot;WASp&quot; gene.

<text>Tarxien () is a town in the Port region of Malta, seat of the Port Regional Council. Its population stood at 8,583 in March 2014.

The town is most notable for the Tarxien Temples, a megalithic temple complex which is among the oldest freestanding structures on Earth. It forms part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the village may be a corruption of &quot;Tirix&quot;, meaning a large stone, similar to those used for the village&#x27;s noted temples. The village motto is &quot;Tyrii Genure Coloni&quot; (&quot;The Phoenicians created me&quot;).

==Demographics==
Tarxien&#x27;s population stood at 7,724 villagers in December 2008, which increased to 8,583 by March 2014. When the summer comes, the heat drives most of the citizens of Ħal Tarxien to the seaside villages of Malta, often bringing down the population of the village to about two-thirds of what it is during the colder months.

==Main sights==

===Prehistoric temples===
The Tarxien Temples consist of three separate, but attached, temple structures. The oldest temple here is said to date back to about 3600 BCE. The temples feature various statues and reliefs of animals, including goats (for which Malta is noted) and pigs. Most notable of the statues found in the Temples are about 2.5 m in height, and are said to represent a sort of Mother Goddess. There are several of these statues scattered around the various temples, and are thought to represent fertility. There was also one of three small baked clay figurines in the form of what is said to be a priest that was found here.

===Churches===
The parish church of Ħal Tarxien is dedicated to the Annunciation of Our Lady, hence the Tarxinizi (the people of Ħal Tarxien) consider the Blessed Virgin Mary, particularly at Her Annunciation as the Patron and Protector of their town and its whole population. The church was elevated to the status of parish in 1592, making it one of the oldest parishes of Malta. A key part of Ħal Tarxien culture is the feast of the Annunciation, whose feast is celebrated in late May or first Sunday of June. It is celebrated with religious celebrations and liturgical services at the parish church, and publicly with street decorations, band marches in the village streets and large aerial and ground firework displays.

The second largest church in town is dedicated to the Resurrection of Christ better known by the locals as &quot;Ta&#x27; l-Erwieħ&quot; (). The word means &quot;of the souls&quot; and it is used due to the old cemetery that surrounds the church. This church is right next to the renowned Tarxien Neolithic Temples and is visited by many tourists as many of the prehistoric remains were also found in the mentioned cemetery.

There are two other small chapels in Ħal Tarxien. These are dedicated to St. Bartholomew and St. Mary respectively.

There is also another chapel which is housed in the convent of the Sisters of Charity. This is dedicated to &#x27;Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception&#x27;. The same congregation have a school.

There is also another church dedicated to St. Nicholas of Tolentino and a convent which belongs to the Augustinian Friars.

*Darlene Vella (Vice Mayor, PL)
*Dasier D&#x27;Amato (PL)
*Neil Portelli (PL)
*Nicole Farrugia (PL)
*Anabelle Marmara (PN)
*Glenn Gerald Urry (PN)

==Band clubs==
There are two band clubs in Ħal Tarxien. These are the &quot;Għaqda Mużikali Marija Annunzjata&quot; and the &quot;Ghaqda Mużikali Madonna tad-Duttrina&quot;, with same clubs seeing their beginnings in 1862 and 1997 respectively. The main aims of these clubs are to promote the music culture amongst the locals of Ħal Tarxien and to co-organise the external festivities of their respective feasts. &quot;Għaqda Mużikali Marija Annunzjata&quot; organises the titular feast of the Annunciation of Our Lady held annually during the last week of May/first week of June, whilst the &quot;Ghaqda Muzikali Madonna tad-Duttrina&quot; organises the secondary feast of the village, that of Our lady of Christian Doctrine held annually in the third week of July.

<doc id="1211473" wikidata="Q1607146" url="?curid=1211473" title="Dot gain">
<text>Dot gain, or tonal value increase, is a phenomenon in offset lithography and some other forms of printing which causes printed material to look darker than intended. It is caused by halftone dots growing in area between the original printing film and the final printed result. In practice, this means that an image that has not been adjusted to account for dot gain will appear too dark when it is printed. Dot gain calculations are often an important part of a CMYK color model.

==Definition==
It is defined as the increase in the area fraction (of the inked or colored region) of a halftone dot during the prepress and printing processes. Total dot gain is the difference between the dot size on the film negative and the corresponding printed dot size. For example, a dot pattern that covers 30% of the image area on film, but covers 50% when printed, is said to show a total dot gain of 20%. 

However, with today&#x27;s computer-to-plate imaging systems, which eliminates film completely, the measure of &quot;film&quot; is the original digital source &quot;dot&quot;. Therefore, dot gain is now measured as the original digital dot versus the actual measured ink dot on paper.

Mathematically, dot gain is defined as:

:formula_1

where &quot;a&quot;print is the ink area fraction of the print, and &quot;a&quot;form is the prepress area fraction to be inked. The latter may be the fraction of opaque material on a film positive (or transparent material on a film negative), or the relative command value in a digital prepress system.

==Causes==

Dot gain is caused by ink spreading around halftone dots. Several factors can contribute to the increase in halftone dot area. Different paper types have different ink absorption rates; uncoated papers can absorb more ink than coated ones, and thus can show more gain. As printing pressure can squeeze the ink out of its dot shape causing gain, ink viscosity is a contributing factor with coated papers; higher viscosity inks can resist the pressure better. Halftone dots can also be surrounded by a small circumference of ink, in an effect called &quot;rimming&quot;. Each halftone dot has a microscopic relief, and ink will fall off the edge before being eliminated entirely by the fountain solution (in the case of offset printing). Finally, halation of the printing film during exposure can contribute to dot gain.

==Yule–Nielsen effect and &quot;optical dot gain&quot;==
The Yule–Nielsen effect, sometimes known as &quot;optical dot gain&quot;, is a phenomenon caused by absorption and scattering of light by the substrate. Light becomes diffused around dots, darkening the apparent tone. As a result, dots absorb more light than their size would suggest.

The Yule–Nielsen effect is not strictly speaking a type of dot gain, because the size of the dot does not change, just its relative absorbance. Some densitometers automatically compute the absorption of a halftone relative to the absorption of a solid print using the Murray–Davies formula.

==Controlling dot gain==
Not all halftone dots show the same amount of gain. The area of greatest gain is in midtones (40–60%); above this, as the dots contact one another, the perimeter available for dot gain is reduced. Dot gain becomes more noticeable with finer screen ruling, and is one of the factors affecting the choice of screen.

Dot gain can be measured using a densitometer and color bars in absolute percentages. Dot gain is usually measured with 40% and 80% tones as reference values. A common value for dot gain is around 23% in the 40% tone for a 150 lines per inch screen and coated paper. Thus a dot gain of 19% means that a tint area of 40% will result in a 59% tone in the actual print.

Modern prepress software usually includes utility to achieve the desired dot gain values using special compensation curves for each machine -- a tone reproduction curve (TRC).

==Computing the area of a halftone pattern==
The inked area (coverage) fraction of the dot may be computed using the Yule-Nielsen model. This requires the optical densities of the substrate, the solid-covered area, and the halftone tint, as well as the value of the Yule-Nielsen parameter, &quot;n&quot;. Pearson has suggested a value of 1.7 be used in absence of more specific information. However, it will tend to be larger when the halftone pattern in finer and when the substrate has a wider point spread function.

==Models for dot gain==
Another factor upon which dot gain depends is the dot&#x27;s area fraction. Dots with relatively large perimeters will tend to have greater dot gain than dots with smaller perimeters. This makes it useful to have a model for the amount of dot gain as a function of prepress dot area fraction.

===An early model===
Tollenaar and Ernst tacitly suggested a model in their 1963 IARIGAI paper. It was

:formula_2

where &quot;avf&quot;, the shadow critical area fraction, is the area fraction on the form at which the halftone pattern just appears solid on the print. This model, while simple, has dots with relatively small perimeter (in the shadows) exhibiting greater gain than dots with relatively larger perimeter (in the midtones).

===Haller&#x27;s model===

Karl Haller, of FOGRA in Munich, proposed a different model, one in which dots with larger perimeters tended to exhibit greater dot gain than those with smaller perimeters. One result derivable from his work is that dot gains depend on the shape of the halftone dots.

===The GRL model===

Viggiano suggested an alternate model, based on the radius (or other fundamental dimension) of the dot growing in relative proportion to the perimeter of the dot, with empirical correction the duplicated areas which result when the corners of adjacent dots join. Mathematically, his model is:

:formula_3

where Δ0,50 is the dot gain when the input area fraction is ; the highlight critical printing area, &quot;awf&quot;, is computed as:

:formula_4

and the shadow critical printing area, &quot;avf&quot;, is computed according to

:formula_5

Note that, unless Δ0,50 = 0, either the highlight critical printing fraction, &quot;awf&quot;, will be nonzero, or the shadow critical printing fraction, &quot;avf&quot; will not be 1, depending on the sign of Δ0,50. In instances in which both critical printing fractions are non-trivial, Viggiano recommended that a cascade of two (or possibly more) applications of the dot gain model be applied.

===Empirical models===

Sometimes the exact form of a dot gain curve is difficult to model on the basis of geometry, and empirical modeling is used instead. To a certain extent, the models described above are empirical, as their parameters cannot be accurately determined from physical aspects of image microstructure and first principles. However, polynomials, cubic splines, and interpolation are completely empirical, and do not involve any image-related parameters. Such models were used by Pearson and Pobboravsky, for example, in their program to compute dot area fractions needed to produce a particular color in lithography.

<text>A heat current or thermal current is a kinetic exchange rate between molecules, relative to the material in which the kinesis occurs. It is defined as the net rate of flow of heat. The SI unit of heat current is the watt, which is the flow of heat across a surface at the rate of one Joule per second.

For conduction, heat current is defined by Fourier&#x27;s law as
: formula_1
where
:formula_2 is the amount of heat transferred per unit time [W] and
:formula_3 is an oriented surface area element [m2]
The above differential equation, when integrated for a homogeneous material of 1-D geometry between two endpoints at constant temperature, gives the heat flow rate as:
: formula_4
where
: &quot;A&quot; is the cross-sectional surface area,
: formula_5 is the temperature difference between the ends,
: formula_6 is the distance between the ends.

For thermal radiation, heat current is defined as
:formula_7
where the constant of proportionality formula_8 is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, formula_9 is the radiating surface area, and formula_10 is temperature.

Heat current can also be thought of as the total phonon distribution multiplied by the energy of one phonon, times the group velocity of the phonons. The phonon distribution of a particular phonon mode is given by the Bose-Einstein factor, which is dependent on temperature and phonon energy.

<text>Karthika Deepam () is a Hindu festival of lights. It is mainly observed mainly by Tamils in India, Sri Lanka and other regions with significant Tamil diaspora. The festival is celebrated on the first full moon day of the month of Kartika coinciding with Kṛttikā nakshatra, falling on the Gregorian months of November or December. Though it corresponds to the Kartik Purnima, it falls on a different day due to the correction of equinoxes in the Tamil calendar. The festival is associated with Shaivism, is celebrated to commemorate the origin of Kartikeya, the Hindu god of war, and Shiva&#x27;s manifestation as Jyotirlinga. In Kerala, it is celebrated as Thrikarthika, in honour of goddess Parvati.

== History ==
One of the earliest references to the festival is found in the Tamil anthology &quot;Akanaṉūṟu&quot;, dating back to the Sangam period (200 BCE to 300 CE). The festival is referred in songs of poetess Avvaiyar. The festival is also referred in the Sangam literature as &quot;Peruviḻa&quot;.

== Theology ==
According to the &quot;Kanda Puranam&quot;, three asuras (a race of celestial beings) Surapadman, Tarakasuran, and Singamukhan performed austerities to propitiate god Shiva. Shiva granted them various boons which gave them near-immortality and the ability to conquer the three worlds. They subsequently started a reign of tyranny in their respective realms which forced the celestial beings devas to plead with Shiva for his assistance. In response, Shiva manifested five additional heads and a divine spark emerged from each of the six heads. The sparks were carried by wind-god Vayu, and fire-god Agni to Ganga river. The water in the Ganga started evaporating due to intense heat, and so the goddess Ganga took them to the Saravana lake, where each of the sparks developed into a baby boy. The six boys were raised by handmaidens known as the Kṛttikās and they were later fused into one by Parvati, thus giving rise to the six-headed Kartikeya. As per Hindu mythology, the six Kṛttikās–Śiva, Sambhūti, Prīti, Sannati, Anasūya, and Kṣamā, who helped in rearing the child, were granted with immortality by Shiva and transformed to become eternal stars in the sky as a part of the  Pleiades star cluster. The festival commemorates the Kṛttikās and the day Parvati united the six forms of Kartikeya.

According to the &quot;Shiva Purana&quot;, Brahma (the god of creation) and Vishnu (the god of preservation) had an argument over their supremacy.
 To settle the debate, Shiva took the form of jyotirlinga, an infinite pillar of light. Shiva declared that the dispute would be resolved if the two could discover his head and feet. Vishnu took the form of a boar Varaha and descended to locate his feet, while Brahma rode his swan Hamsa to locate his head. Vishnu failed in his search of the feet and returned, honest about the outcome of his quest. However, Brahma chanced upon a Pandanus flower falling down from Shiva&#x27;s head and presented the same to Shiva claiming that he had seen Shiva&#x27;s head. The dishonesty of Brahma angered Shiva, causing him to curse the creator deity that he would not be worshipped; he also declared that Vishnu would be eternally worshipped for his honesty. The festival is celebrated to commemorate the manifestation of Shiva as jyothirlinga.

== Occurrence ==
Karthika Deepam is a festival of lights observed mainly by Hindu Tamils in India, Sri Lanka and other regions with significant Tamil diaspora. The festival is celebrated on the first full moon day of the month of Kartika coinciding with Kṛttikā nakshatra, falling on the Gregorian months of November or December. Though it corresponds to the Kartik Purnima, it falls on a different day due to the correction of equinoxes in the Tamil calendar. In Kerala, the festival is known as Thrikarthika, and is celebrated in as a form of veneration to goddess Parvati.

== Practices ==
On the occasion of the festival, people light clay oil lamps. The oil lamps are considered auspicious symbols and is believed to ward off evil forces, and usher in prosperity and joy. People also burst fire crackers, and exchange sweets. Maavali is a traditional firework made from burnt palmyra flowers and spun around to create sparks.
In Hindu temples, special pujas are performed and a lamp cauldron is usually lit to commemorate the festival. In Tiruvannamalai, the festival is marked by the lighting of a large ghee lamp atop the Arunachala hill. Millions of devotees participate in the car festival of Arunachalesvara Temple at Tiruvannamalai and circumambulate the hill.

On the occasion of Thrikarthika, oil lamps are lit after sunset. The lamps are decorated by leaves from coconut and mango trees and placed on banana stems. Special dishes are prepared, and offerings are made to cattle.

<doc id="1211479" wikidata="Q525940" url="?curid=1211479" title="Ko Tao">
<text>Ko Tao (, , ) is an island in Thailand and is part of the Chumphon Archipelago on the western shore of the Gulf of Thailand. It covers an area of about 21 km2 (8 sq mi). Administratively it is a subdistrict (&quot;tambon&quot;) of Ko Pha-ngan District (&quot;amphoe&quot;) of Surat Thani Province. , its official population was 1,382. The main settlement is Ban Mae Haad.

The economy of the island is almost exclusively centered on tourism, especially scuba diving. Scuba diving is extremely popular in Ko Tao due to clear visibility, inexpensive pricing, warm water, and the range of sealife to be seen.

== History ==
Before being settled the island would be occasionally visited by fishermen from neighbouring islands looking for shelter in a storm or just resting before continuing on their journeys.

It would appear from old maps and descriptions that this island was known by European cartographers and mariners as &quot;Pulo Bardia&quot;, indicating that it was first settled by Malayo-Polynesian peoples. The old maps show a chain of three islands aligned north–south and lying off the east coast of the Malay Peninsula. The most northerly and smallest of these islands is marked P. Bardia, the name it had until the early 1900s. The best map example is by John Thornton from &quot;The English Pilot, the Third Book&quot;, dated 1701, but the specific map of the Gulf of Siam is dated around 1677. Also see maps of the East Indies by William Dampier c.1697. By modern standards of accuracy, the islands are poorly placed on early maps. Seventeenth century marine navigation and cartography used the &quot;backstaff&quot; which, in this area, was accurate to one degree of longitude, or around 60 nautical miles.

&quot;The Edinburgh Gazetteer, or Geographical Dictionary&quot; published in 1827 also mentions the island and provides a geographical position. In his 1852 book titled &quot;Narrative of a Residence in Siam.&quot; by Frederick Arthur Neale, the author describes the people and wildlife of Bardia. According to the account there were farms and even cows in a village on the bay lying on the west side of the island. The book includes a fanciful illustration of &quot;Bardia&quot; showing huts and palm trees.

Joseph Huddart in 1801 included these directions for navigating the islands, &quot;To the N.W. by N are two islands of about the same height as Poolo Carnom [Ko Samui]; the first, called SANCORY [Ko Pha-ngan], is 7 leagues from Carnom; the other..., named BARDA, or &quot;Bardia&quot; [Ko Tao], is 7½ leagues from Sancory.&quot; (A league is approximately 3 nautical miles or 5.5 km.)

On 18 June 1899, King Chulalongkorn visited Ko Tao and left as evidence his monogram on a huge boulder at Jor Por Ror Bay next to Sairee Beach. This place is still worshiped today.

In 1933, the island started to be used as a political prison. In 1947 Khuang Abhaiwongse, prime minister at that time, pleaded and received a royal pardon for all prisoners on the island. Everybody was taken to the shore of Surat Thani and Ko Tao was abandoned again.

In the 1980s, overseas travellers began to visit Ko Tao and it quickly became a popular destination. In the 1990s the island became known as a diving site.

==Environment==
The island is an important breeding ground for hawksbill and green turtles. The development of tourism has negatively impacted the health of these grounds, but a breeding programme organised in 2004 by the Royal Thai Navy and KT-DOC, a coalition of local scuba diving centres, has reintroduced hundreds of juvenile turtles to the island&#x27;s ecosystem.

Chumpon Pinnacle, a dive site to the west of the island has a reputation for divers in search of both whale sharks and bull sharks. However, because of warmer water temperatures over the last year a great number of bull sharks have migrated to cooler waters. The island is host to over 130 species of hard corals, and over 223 species of reef fishes belonging to 53 families.

Diving conditions have improved dramatically in the past few years with the continuing education of locals by the dive community. El Niño weather patterns caused a warming of the waters which resulted in the loss of a great deal of the shallow corals near the island. Since then, the recovery has been swift and dramatic. Ko Tao now offers some of the best scuba diving in the Gulf of Thailand. And with help by the island conservation group, Save Koh Tao, the island&#x27;s environmental outlook is improving.

As one of the world&#x27;s most popular diving destinations, more attention is being focused on the negative effects of diving on coral reef health around Ko Tao. Natural factors combined with over-use of some areas has led to an increase in the abundance of such as &quot;Drupella&quot; snails and the crown-of-thorns starfish around the island in recent years. In 2012, a Marine Zoning and Regulations Master Plan was developed for the island and subsequently become local law, but the positive effects of increased management have yet to be realized.

Tourism and development on the island has grown steadily for the last several decades, with public infrastructure often lagging far behind. Shortages of electricity and fresh water are common, and both solid and liquid waste management is inadequate. About 42,000 tonnes of solid waste are produced annually on the island, resulting in a 45,000 tonne garbage mountain while the island&#x27;s waste incinerator sits idle.

==Tourism==


Ko Tao is one of Thailand&#x27;s most popular tourist spots. The &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; has cited its annual visitor count as 132,000 and three million.

The island is well known for scuba diving and snorkeling, as well as hiking, rock climbing, and bouldering. The most popular place for tourists is Sairee on the west coast, which has a white sandy beach of 1.7 km interrupted only by a few huge boulders and a scattering of medium budget resorts and restaurants. Chalok Baan Khao, to the south of the island, is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative for those wishing to escape the crowds. A great many granite boulders, both in the forests and on the beaches of Ko Tao, attract a growing number of climbers. Ko Tao has a little over 25 dive sites to explore.

A series of tourist deaths – including murder and alleged suicide – particularly since 2014, has prompted some to advise that tourists avoid visiting Ko Tao, with some British tabloids labelling it as &quot;Death Island&quot;. Although tourist arrivals to the island dropped in the months immediately following the murders in 2014, there was little lasting effect.

===Dive sites===


==Population==
To serve the tourist population, some 3,000–5,000 Burmese workers staff the island. There is a dominant Thai family on the island that owns several dive schools, resorts, and bars.

==Transportation==
Motorbikes are the main form of transport and the main cause of injury to tourists in the area.

==Ferries==
Ferry companies Lomprayah, Seatran, and Songserm serve Ko Tao from: 
*Surat Thani (4 hours day boat, 9 hours on overnight boat)
*Chumphon (1.5–3 hours, 7 hours on overnight boat)
*Ko Samui (approximately 2.5 hours)
*Ko Pha-ngan (approximately 1.5–2 hours). 
All ferries dock at Ban Mae Haad. Journey times vary due to the different boats used by the various ferry companies.

==Air ==
Ko Tao has no airport, but connections to high speed catamarans and ferries are available at three airports.

*Chumphon Airport (CJM)
*Ko Samui Airport (USM)
*Surat Thani Airport (URT)

==Rail==
Train services are available to Chumphon where ferries are available.

<text>Tinku, a Bolivian Quechua tradition from Norte Potosí, began as a form of ritualistic combat. In the Quechua language, it means &quot;meeting-encounter&quot;. During this ritual, men and women from different communities will meet and begin the festivities by dancing. The women will then form circles and begin chanting while the men proceed to fight each other; eventually the women will join in the fighting as well. Large tinkus are held in Potosí during the first few weeks of May.

Pututu trumpets were used by the people in order to call for a Tinku encounter, as well as to assemble the peasants when the hacendado required of their presence. Tinku dance costumes are colorful and decorative. Women wear a dress, abarcas, and a hat and men wear an undershirt, pants, jacket, sandals (abarcas), and hard helmet like hats. 

Because of the rhythmic way the men throw their fists at each other, and because they stand in a crouched stance going in circles around each other, a dance was formed. This dance, the Festive Tinku, simulates the traditional combat, bearing a warlike rhythm. The differences between the Andean tradition and the dance are the costumes, the role of women, and the fact that the dancers do not actually fight each other. The Festive Tinku has become a cultural dance for all of Bolivia, although it originated in Potosí.

==Tinku combat==

===History===

The Bolivian tradition began with the indigenous belief in Pachamama, or Mother Nature. The combat is in praise of Pachamama, and any blood shed throughout the fighting is considered a sacrifice, in hopes of a fruitful harvest and fertility. Because of the violent nature of the tradition there have been fatalities, but each death is considered a sacrifice which brings forth life, and a donation to the land that fertilizes it. The brawls are also considered a mean of release of frustration and anger between the separate communities. Tinkus usually last two to three days. During this time, participants will stop every now and then to eat, sleep, or drink.

===Methods of combat===

During the brawl itself, men will often carry rocks in their hands to have greater force in their punches, or they will just throw them at opponents. Sometimes, especially in the town of Macha in Potosí, where the brawl gets the most violent, men will wrap strips of cloth with shards of glass stuck to them around their fists to cause greater damage. Slingshots and whips are also used, though not as much as hand-to-hand combat. The last day of the fight is considered the most violent and police almost always have to separate the mass of bloody men and women.

===Attire===

Men attend tinkus wearing traditional monteras, or thick helmet-like hats made of thick leather, resembling helmets from the Conquistadors. These helmets are often painted and decorated with feathers. Their pants are usually simple black or white with traditional embroidering near their feet. Often the men wear wide thick belts tied around their waist and stomach for more protection.

==Festive Tinku dance==
The Festive Tinku, a much more pleasant experience than a ceremonial tinku, has many differences. It has been accepted as a cultural dance in the whole nation of Bolivia. Tinku music has a loud constant drum beat to give it a native warlike feel, while charangos, guitars, and zampoñas (panpipes) play melodies. The dancers perform with combat like movements, following the heavy beat of the drum.

===Costumes===

For men, the costumes are more colorful. Their monteras are usually decorated with long colorful feathers. Tinku Suits, or the outfits men wear during Festive Tinku performances, are usually made with bold colors to symbolize power and strength, instead of the neutral colors worn in ceremonial tinkus that help participants blend in. Women wear long embroidered skirts and colorful tops. Their costumes are completed by extravagant hats, painted and decorated with various long and colorful feathers and ribbons. Men and women wear walking sandals so they can move and jump easily.

===Dance===

The dance is performed in a crouching stance, bending at the waist. Arms are thrown out and there are various kicks, while the performers move in circles following the beat of the drum. Every jump from one foot to the next is followed by a hard stomp and a thrown fist to signify the violence from the ceremonial tinku. Many times the dancers will hold basic and traditional instruments in their hands that they will use as they stomp, just to add more noise for a greater effect.

<text>Francis Fitzpatrick VC (born in Tullycorbet, County Monaghan in 1859 – 10 July 1933) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==
He was about 20 years old, and a Private in the 94th Regiment of Foot (later The Connaught Rangers), British Army during the campaign against Sekukuni when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 28 November 1879 during an attack on Sekukuni&#x27;s Town, South Africa, Private Fitzpatrick and another private (Thomas Flawn) with six men of the Native Contingent, were with a lieutenant of the 1st Dragoon Guards when he was badly wounded. The natives carried the wounded officer at first, but when the party was pursued by about 30 of the enemy they deserted and the lieutenant would have been killed but for the gallantry of the two privates - one carrying him and the other covering the retreat and firing on the enemy.

==Later life==
Fitzpatrick died in Glasgow, Scotland, on 10 July 1933. He was buried at St Kentigern&#x27;s Cemetery, Glasgow

==The medal==

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Army Museum &quot;(Chelsea, England)&quot;.

<doc id="1211487" wikidata="Q291672" url="?curid=1211487" title="Yūko Tsushima">
<text>Satoko Tsushima (30 March 1947 – 18 February 2016), known by her pen name Yūko Tsushima (津島 佑子 &quot;Tsushima Yūko&quot;), was a Japanese fiction writer, essayist and critic. Tsushima won many of Japan&#x27;s top literary prizes in her career, including the Izumi Kyōka Prize for Literature, the Noma Literary New Face Prize, the Noma Literary Prize, the Yomiuri Prize and the Tanizaki Prize. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Tsushima &quot;one of the most important writers of her generation.&quot; Her work has been translated into over a dozen languages.

==Early life==
Tsushima was born in Mitaka, Tokyo, the third child (younger of two daughters) of famed novelist Osamu Dazai and Michiko Ishihara, a teacher at a girls&#x27; school. Her father committed suicide when she was one year old; she later drew on the aftermath of this experience in writing her short story &quot;The Watery Realm&quot;.

==Career==
While attending Shirayuri Women&#x27;s University she published her first fiction. At age 24 she published her first collection of stories, &quot;Carnival&quot; (&quot;Shaniku-sai&quot;). A prolific writer, she was the winner of several literary prizes. In 1972 her story &quot;Pregnant with a Fox&quot; (&quot;Kitsune wo haramu&quot;) was a runner-up for the Akutagawa Prize. She was awarded the Izumi Kyōka Prize for Literature in 1977 for &quot;Kusa no Fushido&quot; (&quot;Bedchamber of Grass&quot;), and the first annual Noma Literary New Face Prize for &quot;Hikari no ryōbun&quot; (&quot;Territory of Light&quot;) in 1979. In 1983 she was awarded the Kawabata Yasunari Literature Prize for her short story &quot;Danmari ichi&quot; (&quot;The Silent Traders&quot;), and in 1986 she won the Yomiuri Prize for her novel &quot;Yoru no hikari ni owarete&quot; (&quot;Driven by the Light of the Night&quot;). In 1998 she was awarded the 34th Tanizaki Prize and the 51st Noma Literary Prize for her novel &quot;Hi no yama – yamazaruki&quot; (&quot;Mountain of Fire: Account Of A Wild Monkey&quot;). In 2002 she won the Osaragi Jiro Prize for &quot;Warai ookami&quot; (&quot;Laughing Wolf&quot;).

==Writing style==
Tsushima&#x27;s work is often characterized as feminist, though she did not apply this label to her own work. Her writing explores the lives of marginalized people, usually women, who struggle for control of their own lives against societal and family pressures. She has cited Tennessee Williams as a literary influence. Unlike many of her contemporaries, whose writing about women tended to assume a nuclear family, Tsushima wrote about women who had been abandoned by family members. Her stories, several of which draw on her own experience as a single mother, focus on the psychological impact of abandonment on those left behind.

<text>Thomas Flawn VC (22 December 1857 – 19 January 1925) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Flawn was 21 years old, and a private in the 94th Regiment of Foot (later the Connaught Rangers), British Army during the campaign against Sekukuni, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 28 November 1879 during an attack on Sekukuni&#x27;s Town, South Africa, Private Flawn and another private (Francis Fitzpatrick) with six men of the Native Contingent, were with a lieutenant of the 1st Dragoon Guards when he was badly wounded. The natives carried the wounded officer at first, but when the party was pursued by about 30 of the enemy they deserted and the lieutenant would have been killed but for the gallantry of the two privates – who alternately carried him while the other covered the retreat by firing on the enemy.

<text>Stephen Higginson (November 28, 1743 – November 28, 1828) was an American merchant and shipmaster from Boston, Massachusetts. He was a delegate for Massachusetts to the Continental Congress in 1783. He took an active part in suppressing Shays&#x27; Rebellion, was the author of the &quot;Laco letters&quot; (1789), and served the United States government as navy agent from May 11 to June 22, 1798. Although he was a privateer during the American Revolutionary War he became a &quot;blue light&quot;, extreme-Federalist during the War of 1812 and was one of the members of the Essex Junto.

==Early life==
Stephen Higginson was born on November 28, 1743, in Salem, Massachusetts, to Elizabeth (née Cabot) and Stephen Higginson. He attended common schools in Salem. He began work as a merchant in the counting room of Deacon Smith of Boston. His great-great-great-grandfather was reverend Francis Higginson. His double first cousin was George Cabot.

==Career==
Higginson worked in mercantile and was a shipmaster from 1765 to 1775. In 1778, he moved from Salem to Boston to become a partner with Jonathan Jackson. He served in the Massachusetts legislature in 1782 and was a delegate for Massachusetts to the Continental Congress in 1783. Along with his fellow Massachusetts delegates Holten and Gorham, he signed a protest against the denial of Elbridge Gerry&#x27;s right in calling for ayes and nays. He was part of a group of Federalists called the Essex Junto, which included his cousin George Cabot and Theophilus Parsons. He was the author of the &quot;Laco letters&quot; in February and March 1789. He became justice of the peace in Massachusetts in 1782 and of the Quorum in 1788.

In February 1784, he became a director of a bank in Boston led by Governor James Bowdoin. Higginson served as a naval officer at the Port of Boston from 1797 to 1808. He took an active part in suppressing Shays&#x27; Rebellion and served as lieutenant colonel in the Boston regiment.

==Personal life==
Higginson married Susanna &quot;Susan&quot; Cleveland, a second cousin and daughter of Aaron Cleveland, on October 20, 1764. They had a son, John. After marrying, they moved to a home at the corner of Main and Central streets in Salem. His wife died in 1788. He married Elizabeth Perkins, daughter of an English merchant, on May 15, 1789. They had one son, James Perkins. His second wife died and he married again in September 1792 to Sarah Perkins, sister of his former wife. He lived at 10 Gower Street in London in 1800 and lived in England from 1806 to 1812 and in 1818.

Higginson died on November 28, 1828, in Boston. He was buried in the Central Burying Ground in Boston.

<doc id="1211492" wikidata="Q917019" url="?curid=1211492" title="Rai stones">
<text>A rai stone (), or fei stone, is one of many large artifacts that were manufactured and treasured by the native inhabitants of the Yap islands in Micronesia. They are also known as Yapese stone money or similar names.

The typical rai stone is carved out of crystalline limestone and shaped like a disk with a hole in the center. The smallest may be in diameter. The largest extant stone is located on Rumung island, near the Riy village; it is in diameter and thick, and weighs .

Rai stones were quarried on several of the Micronesian islands, mainly Palau, but briefly on Guam as well. The practice stopped in the early 20th century. Today around 6,000 large rai stones are outstanding on the island, and several can be seen in museums worldwide.

The stones were highly valued by the Yapese and used for important ceremonial gifts. The ownership of a large stone, which would be too difficult to move, was established by its history as recorded in oral tradition rather than by its location. Appending a transfer to the oral history of the stone thus effected a change of ownership.

Some modern economists have viewed Rai stones as a form of money, and the stones are often used as a demonstration of the fact that the value of some forms of money can be assigned purely through a shared belief in said value.

==Names==
Originally the name &quot;rai&quot; was used in the northern part of Yap and &quot;fei&quot; in the southern part. The names are also transcribed as &quot;rei&quot; and &quot;fai&quot;, respectively, and are often capitalized. In Palau, the stones are called &quot;&quot;. In the 20th century, the name &quot;fei&quot; fell into disuse.

The name &quot;rai&quot; could mean &quot;whale&quot; in Yapese. This may be a reference to one of the origin legends, in which the first stones were shaped like fish.

==Physical description==

Rai stones are approximately round, although some more recent ones are rather elongated. In the best-worked ones, the thickness gradually decreases from the center to the rim or in two or three steps. The central hole has about 1/6 of the diameter of the stone. Sometimes there are additional holes off center. The diameter varies from to , but most are between .

The stones are made of light-colored crystalline rock consisting of calcium carbonate. Stones with brown or white streaks were particularly prized. Weathered stones are dull gray. Earlier reports incorrectly state that the material is aragonite, the most common mineral in coral and sea shells and in rocks derived thereof. Modern analysis revealed that the mineral is, in fact calcite.

The stone occurs in Palau as deposits slowly formed on the walls of some caves by percolating rainwater (speleothems, specifically flowstones). Tectonic activity millions of years ago lifted limestone deposits out of the sea, eroded by rainwater, forming a typical cave-riled karst geology.

==Use and value==
Rai stones were, and still are, used in rare important social transactions, such as marriage, inheritance, political deals, sign of an alliance, ransom of the battle dead, or, rarely, in exchange for food. Many are placed in front of meetinghouses, around village courts, or along pathways.

Although the ownership of a particular stone might change, the stone itself is rarely moved due to its weight and risk of damage. Thus the physical location of a stone was often not significant: ownership was established by shared agreement and could be transferred even without physical access to the stone. Each large stone had an oral history that included the names of previous owners. In one instance, a large rai being transported by canoe and outrigger was accidentally dropped and sank to the sea floor. Although it was never seen again, everyone agreed that the rai must still be there, so it continued to be transacted as any other stone.

The perceived value of a specific stone was based on its size, craftsmanship, and history. The value could depend, for instance, on whether a famous sailor brought it or whether people died during its transport.

==History==
===Origin legends===
The story of the origin of the rai stones survives only in Yapese oral legends.

According to one version, about 500–600 years ago Anagumang, a Yapese from Tomil island, was instructed by the divinity Le-gerem to travel by boat with seven companions to the mythical island of Magaragar south of Palau, where they found a sparkling stone. According to some variants, the stones were first cut in various shapes, such as fish, lizard, turtle, or crescent moon. But eventually, they settled for the shape of a full moon, with a hole at the center for transport. In another version, the discovery expedition was headed by Anagumang and a Fatha&#x27;an from Yap&#x27;s Rull island.

A different legend attributes the discovery to chance by a group of fishermen driven to Palau by a storm. According to one variant, they fashioned a fish from the local sparkling stone and took it to the king of Rull as a substitute for the fish they failed to catch.

A separate legend tells that before the Palau quarries were discovered, the inhabitants of the village of Talangeth on Map island attempted to make rai stones from the local quartzite rock, but the attempts were abandoned due to clan wars.

===Archaeological and anthropological evidence===

It is unknown how long the rai stones have been used in Yap. Flat rocks up to 2000 years old have been found there, but the oldest does not resemble today&#x27;s rai stones, and how they were used is not known.

An alternative hypothesis for the origin of rai stones is that they may have evolved from smaller carved beads. Two disks (without holes) measuring and were found and radiocarbon-dated 1636±200 and 1756±200 respectively. However, the relationship between these objects and the rai stones is unclear.

Calcite speleothems do not occur on the Yap islands, which consist mostly of metamorphic rock rather than limestone. However, there are small veins of marble, a crystalline calcite rocks of metamorphic origin, that has a sparkling appearance similar to that of the Palau flowstones. It has been conjectured that the Yapese originally came to value crystalline calcite from these sources before discovering the much more abundant deposits in the Palau caves.

Archaeologists have identified quarries used by the Yapese in a relatively small region of Palau, spanning the southern end of Babeldaob and the northern part of Koror. Some rai stones were found elsewhere in Palau, but the quarries, if any, had not been found as of 2006. Excavations were carried out at the quarries of Omis Cave on the island of Oreor, Chelechol ra Orrak and Upper Orrak on the island of Orrak, and Metuker ra Bisech on the island of the same name. The first two sites, caves/coves that open on the beach, appear to have been exploited before contact with Europeans, although the dates could not be determined. The other two sites are located uphill, some distance from the beach. Quarrying at Metuker ra Bisech appears to have started only around 1700 CE, after the Yapese acquired iron tools. A large stone (3.5 m diameter, 20 cm thick) that apparently broke while being removed from the quarry at Metuker ra Bisech was abandoned on the spot.

===Native manufacture===

Rai stone production was well developed by the 19th century. Expeditions to Palau, consisting of tens of young men authorized or commanded by a village chief, would last up to several years and could result in the death of members at the quarries or during the sea voyage. According to some accounts, on their return, the largest stones and 2/5 of the smaller ones were handed over to the chief, and the men were rewarded with baskets of taro.

Palau lies 400 km west of Yap on a straight line. According to later oral accounts from Yap and Palau, the Yapese first mined on the small island of Magaragár (Ngaragasemiěg), because they were afraid to land on the larger nearby island of Peleliu. Eventually the Palau natives gave the Yapese permission to quarry, in exchange for heavy labor and a few other items they brought from Yap. A report from 1903 claims that a large paved road in the island of Koror was built by the Yapese.

In the quarries, the stones were cut out from the wall deposits of calcite as rough upright disks. It seems that they were then propped up against natural or artificial walls for shaping, finishing and polishing. The rough work appears to have been done with pickaxes or adzes, with blades 1 to 3 cm wide, made of stone or of the shell of large clams such as &quot;Tridacna&quot;. According to oral traditions, the central hole was made with a coral reef stone used as a &quot;fire drill&quot;, presumably a large bow drill. (While the clam shells and coral are made of calcium carbonate too, they consist of the aragonite form, which is harder than the stone&#x27;s calcite (3.5–4.0 and 3.0 in the Mohs hardness scale, respectively).

The expeditions traveled to Palau by canoes. On the return, the stones could be carried by canoe or (for the larger specimens) on bamboo rafts. Since the raft was slow and poorly steerable, it was usually let loose in advance to be carried towards Yap by sea currents, while the men left some time later in canoes, on its pursuit. This return route could be more than 1000 km long. The expedition would eventually recover the raft in the vicinity of Yap and tow it to the islands. Stones were often lost at sea. These methods of transport apparently limited the diameter of stones to 2 metres or less and 2 tons of weight.}

It is reported that the stones were transported on land by inserting a log or bamboo through the hole, which was carried on the shoulders of several men. Carried this way, the largest stones would have needed hundreds of men to transport, suggesting the more likely possibility that the largest stones were rolled, akin to wheels on an axle.

===European discovery===

The earliest reports by western Jesuits of what could be the Yapese rai stones date from the early 1700s.

A report of a European expedition in 1815–1818 mentions that the Yap islands produce &quot;grinding stones&quot;, that are used by chieftains as thrones, with one stone serving as seat and another as the back rest. The first clear report of a rai stone is from a British ship log entry dated 23 August 1843. The ship carried a delegation from Palau, headed by chieftain Abba Thulle, who was delivering a rai stone as a diplomatic gift to the &quot;prime minister&quot; of Yap and a cadre of Tomil chieftains. The ship&#x27;s captain Andrew Cheyne notes that the stone was highly valued since it could be found only in the mountains of Palau. While referring to the stone as a &quot;gift of money&quot;, Andrew did not mention seeing any other rai stone during his stay at Yap. His commercial agent Alfred Tetens reported in his memoirs that, in 1865, he transported ten Yapese from Palau to Yap, who were carrying 20 large blocks and many smaller ones, a few cm in diameter, to be used as currency.

===Manufacturing after European contact===

Contact with Europeans in the 19th century first provided the Yapese at Palau with iron tools, that made the cutting and shaping of the stones much easier. Not much later, the Yapese made deals with Europeans to use their ships to transport the stones back to Yap. These arrangements enabled the manufacture of much larger and heavier rai stones, up to 4 meters in diameter, as well of a larger number of them. However, these &quot;modern&quot; stones were less valuable than more ancient ones.

In 1871, the Irish-American David Dean O&#x27;Keefe was shipwrecked near Yap and was helped by the natives. Later, he assisted the Yapese in acquiring rai stones and in return received copra and trepang, which were valuable exports in the Far East. The book &quot;His Majesty O&#x27;Keefe&quot; is the story of his life on Yap. A film of the same name starring Burt Lancaster was made in 1954.

===End of manufacture===

The trade for rai stones eventually stopped at the beginning of the 20th century due to trade disputes between Spanish and German interests in the area. Quarries were abandoned. When Imperial Japanese forces took over Yap during World War II, they used some of the stones for construction or as anchors.

Although modern currency has replaced the stones as everyday currency, the rai stones are still exchanged in traditional ways between the Yapese. They are a national symbol and are depicted on local license plates.

==Economic interpretation==
In a 1991 paper, economist Milton Friedman argued that while the Yap system of immobile money might seem bizarre at first glance, it was not so different from the operation of the gold vault of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which can pay gold from one government to another without the gold ever leaving the vault. Demands by the government of France for such payment from the United States in 1932 contributed to a nationwide bank panic, proving that industrialized countries could fall under the sway of economic rituals as surely as the Yap islanders.

A 2022 paper by Jo Lindsay Walton, a science fiction author and research fellow at the University of Sussex, claims inconsistencies, errors and omissions in many Western economic accounts of stone money, including Friedman&#x27;s. Walton&#x27;s paper asserts that when &quot;Yap has appeared in Western political economy, the lessons which authors draw often reflect their position in intellectual and political disputes which are not principally rooted in Yapese history or economics.&quot;

<text>Ricardo Semler (born 1959) is the chief executive officer and majority owner of Semco Partners, a Brazilian company best known for its radical form of industrial democracy and corporate re-engineering. Under his ownership, revenue has grown from 4 million US dollars in 1982 to 212 million US dollars in 2003 and his business management policies have attracted widespread interest around the world. &quot;Time&quot; featured him in its Global 100 young leaders profile series published in 1994 while the World Economic Forum also nominated him. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; &quot;America Economia&quot;, The Wall Street Journal&#x27;s Latin American magazine, named him Latin American Businessman of the Year in 1990 and he was named Brazilian Businessman in the year 1990 and 1992. &quot;Virando a Própria Mesa&quot; (&quot;Turning Your Own Table&quot;), his first book, became the best-selling non-fiction book in the history of Brazil. He has since written two books in English on the transformation of Semco and workplace re-engineering: &quot;Maverick&quot;, an English version of &quot;Turning Your Own Table&quot; published in 1993 and an international bestseller, and &quot;The Seven-Day Weekend&quot; in 2003.

==Semco 1980–1990==
Semler went to work for his father&#x27;s company, originally called Semler &amp; Company, then as a mixer and agitator supplier in São Paulo. Semler clashed with his father, Antonio Semler, who supported a traditional autocratic style of management whereas young Semler favoured a decentralised, participatory style. Furthermore, Ricardo favoured diversification away from the struggling shipbuilding industry, which his father opposed.

After heated clashes, the son threatened to leave the company. Rather than see this happen, Antonio Semler resigned as CEO and vested majority ownership in his son in 1980 when Ricardo was 21 years old. On his first day as CEO, Ricardo Semler fired sixty percent of all top managers. He began to work on a diversification program to rescue the company. Semler experienced health issues, culminating in a fainting spell at a pump factory (Baldwinsville, New York) when he was 25. After seeing a doctor at the Lahey Clinic (Boston), he was diagnosed with an advanced case of stress. This inspired him to want a greater work-life balance for himself and his employees.

Attempts to introduce a matrix organisational structure in 1986 failed to achieve desired improvements. 

In the late 1980s, three engineers at Semco proposed setting up a Nucleus of Technological Innovation (NTI) to develop new businesses and product lines which Semler endorsed. At the end of the first six months, NTI had identified 18 such opportunities. Following the success of this initiative, satellite units were encouraged throughout Semco. By the late 1980s, these satellite units accounted for two-thirds of its new products and two-thirds of its employees.

An assessment of Semler&#x27;s business philosophy through phenomenological analysis (within the radical change of Semco&#x27;s management style), led Bombała to conclude that it was an &quot;...excellent exemplification of good leadership.&quot; Eleanor Glor notes that the only accounts about the change in management style come from Ricardo Semler himself, rather than from the affected workers.

==Semco 1990–2004==
After dramatic restrictions on liquidity instituted by Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello to combat hyperinflation in 1990, the Brazilian economy went into a severe downturn, forcing many companies to declare bankruptcy. Workers at Semco agreed to wage cuts, providing their share of profits was increased to 39%, management salaries were cut by 40% and employees were given the right to approve every item of expenditure.

Performing multiple roles during the crisis gave workers greater knowledge of the operations and more suggestions on how to improve the business. Reforms implemented during that time led to a 65% reduction in inventories, a marked reduction in product delivery times and a product defects rate that fell to less than 1%. As the business climate improved, Semco&#x27;s revenues and profitability improved dramatically.

, Semco had annual revenue of $212 million, up from $4 million in 1982 and $35 million in 1994, with an annual growth rate of up to 40 percent a year. It employed 3,000 workers in 2003, as opposed to 90 in 1982. The company&#x27;s units include:
* The industrial machinery unit, which now manufactures mixing equipment as opposed to pumps
* Sembobac, a partnership with Baltimore Air Cooler making cooling towers
* Cushman and Wakefield Semco, a partnership with Rockefeller property company Cushman and Wakefield managing properties in Brazil and Latin America
* Semco Johnson Controls, a partnership with Johnson Controls, managing large scale facilities such as airports and hospitals
* ERM, a partnership with Environmental Resources Management, one of the world&#x27;s leading environmental consultants
* Semco Ventures, offering high technology and Internet services
* SemcoHR, a human resources management firm
* Semco-RGIS, an inventory control firm

As Semco grew, Ricardo Semler received a great deal of recognition. He was named Brazilian Businessman of the Year in 1990 and in 1992, and the World Economic Forum named him one of the Global Leaders of Tomorrow. A high-profile committee appointed by &quot;CIO Magazine&quot; featuring Tom Peters, Jim Champy and Michael Hammer selected Semco as one of the most successfully re-engineered companies in the world. The BBC included Semco in its series on &quot;Reengineering the Business&quot; for creating one of the most successful management structures in business.

== Other activities ==
Semler has reduced his involvement in Semco in the past decade to pursue other activities. He wrote a book &quot;Maverick&quot; on his experience at Semco which became a worldwide bestseller in 1993.

His second book, &quot;The Seven-Day Weekend: Changing the Way Work Works&quot; was published in 2003.

He has appeared in the media around the world and speaks regularly to business schools, businesses and groups to promote his philosophy of industrial democracy. He has also been a visiting scholar at Harvard Business School.

Semler has been Vice President of the Federation of Industries of Brazil and a member of SOS Atlantic Forest, the leading environmental defence organisation in Brazil. He founded The Ralston-Semler Foundation and the Lumiar School, a democratic school where children from 0 to 14 years old engage in projects of their interest. There are three such schools — one in the city of São Paulo and two in the vicinity of Campos do Jordão, in the state of São Paulo.

=== Semler principles institutions ===
As of late 2016, Semler was involved in the foundation of other ventures which intend to teach other entrepreneurs and business people how to implement people-centric management in their companies called Semco Style Institute where people are formed to find the right way to apply Semler&#x27;s principles.

<text>Up The Line To Death: The War Poets 1914–1918 is a poetry anthology edited by Brian Gardner, and first published in 1964. It was a thematic collection of the poetry of World War I.

A significant revisiting of the tradition of the war poet, writing in English, it was backed up by strong biographical research on the poets included. Those were mainly British and Irish combatants of World War I; but there are also Australian, Canadian and American poets. The poems are arranged roughly in chronological order, from the start of the war to the end. Some contemporary poems by major poets not involved in the fighting are also given. The title of the anthology comes from the Siegfried Sassoon poem &#x27;Base Details&#x27;.

<doc id="1211510" wikidata="Q727227" url="?curid=1211510" title="Alain Bombard">
<text>Alain Bombard (; Paris, 27 October 1924 – Paris, 19 July 2005) was a French biologist, physician and politician famous for sailing in a small boat across the Atlantic Ocean without provision. He theorized that a human being could very well survive the trip across the ocean without provisions and decided to test his theory himself in order to save thousands of lives of people lost at sea.

He was a Member of the European Parliament from the Socialist Party for France from 1981 to 1994.

== Life ==
On 19 October 1952 Bombard began his solitary trip across the Atlantic Ocean to the West Indies, after visiting his newborn daughter in France. He had sailed in the Atlantic Ocean solo before, from Tangier to Casablanca (13-20 August) and from Casablanca to Las Palmas (24 August – 3 September). The original plan had been to sail across the Atlantic with a friend, English yachtsman Jack Palmer, with whom he sailed just before from Monaco to Menorca (5 May – 11 June) but Jack abandoned Alain in Tangier. Bombard sailed in a Zodiac inflatable boat called &quot;l&#x27;Hérétique&quot; (&quot;the &quot;), which was only long, taking only a sextant and almost no provisions.

Bombard reports he survived by fishing (and using fish as source of both fresh water and food) with a self-made harpoon and hooks, and harvesting the surface plankton with a small net. He also drank a limited amount of seawater for a long period on his trip. On 23 October, the fourth day of the journey, Bombard had to mend a torn old sail, while the backup sail was blown away. He also made a major navigation mistake which made him believe that he was sailing much faster than he actually was. On the fifty-third day of the journey he encountered a ship. The crew told him that he was still over short of his goal. However, after the ship&#x27;s crew offered him a meal, Bombard decided to go on. Bombard reached Barbados on 23 December 1952, after of travel. Bombard had lost and was briefly hospitalized. He published a book about his trip entitled &quot;Naufragé Volontaire&quot; in 1953.

Bombard&#x27;s claim was later tested and contested by Hannes Lindemann, a German physician, canoeist and sailing pioneer, although both the French and Taiwanese navies concurred with Bombard&#x27;s findings, the Taiwanese exercise extending to 134 days. Lindemann wanted to repeat Bombard&#x27;s trip in order to gain a better understanding of living on salt water and fish, but found that he needed fresh water (from rain) most days. Lindemann later claimed that Bombard had actually taken along fresh water and consumed it on the ocean, and that he had also been secretly provided further supplies during his voyage. Lindemann&#x27;s own observations about reactions to scarce fresh water supplies became the basis for the World Health Organization&#x27;s navigation recommendations. However, it appears that Bombard may have been misunderstood in regard to the possibility of survival without fresh water. Bombard never argued that human survival is possible only by drinking seawater. On the contrary, he indicated that seawater in small quantities can prolong survival if accompanied, if rainwater is not available, by the absorption of liquids present in the bodies of fish. On its own, he only claimed the seawater can extend the period of consciousness during which alternatives can be sought. Bombard&#x27;s legacy is still debated; in any case, an inflatable survival raft is still very often called a &quot;bombard&quot; in French, in memory of the doctor&#x27;s adventure in the Atlantic.

In 1958, Bombard and six men were testing a rubber dinghy in rough waters off of the coast of the French town of Étel when a wave capsized the craft. A rescue crew of seven, standing by during test, came to Bombard&#x27;s rescue in a lifeboat which was capsized by a huge wave that knocked nine of the 14 people on board overboard. Bombard and four men were the only survivors.

Bombard died in Toulon in 2005 at age 80.

==Media appearances==
Bombard was featured in an episode of the educational television program &quot;3-2-1 Contact&quot; in 1986, in which he coaches two of the teenaged cast members on his life-raft survival techniques using a real raft on the open sea.

<doc id="1211513" wikidata="Q4681662" url="?curid=1211513" title="Adelaide Abankwah">
<text>Adelaide Abankwah (born c. 1971) was a pseudonym taken by Ghanaian Regina Norman Danson when she tried to gain asylum in the United States, claiming to be fleeing female genital cutting and seeking political asylum.

==Life==
===Birth===
Regina Norman Danson is believed to have been born around 1971 in Biriwa, Central Ghana.

===1999===
Abankwah was detained for over two years in the privately operated Queens Detention Facility in Jamaica, Queens, New York, when her application for asylum was twice rejected, first by an immigration judge, and then in 1999 by the Board of Immigration Appeals.

Eventually, the INS investigation determined that the &quot;Abankwah&quot; was an impostor. Her real name was Regina Norman Danson. She had adopted the name of another Ghanaian woman who was living in Maryland and whose passport had been stolen in Ghana. Danson admitted that she had given a wrong name but that her story was still true, insisting her mother was deceased. Further inquiries from Ghana showed that her mother, who had never been a tribal leader, was still alive.

The case came to the attention of feminist and human rights activists who began to lobby for her release. They included actresses Julia Roberts and Vanessa Redgrave and then First lady Hillary Clinton and Gloria Steinem with Equality Now. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision in July 1999 and granted Danson asylum. INS continued to investigate and found &quot;overwhelming evidence&quot; of fraud.

===2001===
The U.S. Department of Justice was still hesitant to pursue a fraud conviction because of possible public furor and bad publicity but indicted her in 2001 on fraud shortly before the statute of limitations ran out. The real Abankwah, whose documents had been stolen, cooperated with INS to have the case cleared.

===2002===
The fraud trial began on 14 January 2002. Prosecutor Ronnie Abrams stated that the bid for political asylum made a &quot;mockery of the immigration system and real victims of genital mutilation&quot;. Tribal Chief Nana Kwa Bonko V testified that Danson was not in the tribe&#x27;s royal succession and that they did not practice female circumcision.

===2003===
Danson was to be sentenced for fraud on 23 March 2003. However, she was sentenced to time served by federal Judge Charles Sifton. (She had spent 29 months in an immigration detention center.)

===2014===
Based on an amici curiae brief (&quot;ON PETITION FOR REVIEW FROM THE BOARD OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS&quot;), on behalf of Regina Danson Norman [sic] in 2014 by the Immigrant Defense Project, she apparently was never deported or removed from the United States.

<text>Spectral induced polarization (SIP), or complex resistivity (CR) and also complex conductivity (CC), is a geophysical survey technique and an extension of the induced polarization (IP) method, being itself an extension of measuring the Earth&#x27;s resistance at a single frequency or under direct current (DC) (a technique commonly known by the name resistivity). SIP measures the frequency-dependent (i.e. spectral) complex impedance, equivalent to the amount of resistance and phase shift between electric current and voltage. The usual frequency range for alternating current (AC) applied during SIP surveys is tens of kHz to MHz. As with other geophysical methods, SIP aims to distinguish material properties of the subsurface, such as salinity and saturation.

<text>Kimon Evan Marengo (February 4, 1904 – November 4, 1988), better known for his pen name Kem, was a British cartoonist who was born in Zifta, Egypt. He was the son of Evangelos Marangos, a Greek cotton merchant.

Marengo grew up in the Greek community in Alexandria, Egypt. In his childhood he produced his own satirical hobby magazine. In 1929 he went to study at the &quot;Ecole des Sciences Politiques&quot; in Paris, graduating in 1931. He began to draw cartoons for newspapers, including &quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot;, &quot;Le Petit Parisien&quot;, the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

Marengo attended the University of Oxford in 1939, but when World War II erupted, he joined the Ministry of Information and drew 3.000 propaganda posters, leaflets, and political cartoons in various languages, including three dialects of Arabic and Persian. This included British propaganda effort to get the support of the Persians. He wrote eight books. He was also involved in activities of the Political Warfare Executive in France, North Africa and later the Middle East.

After the war Marengo went back to his studies in Oxford and graduated at the end of 1946 due to accelerated BA programme. His eventual thesis was &quot;The Cartoon as a Political Weapon in England: 1783-1832&quot;.

From 1939 he designed and printed his own Christmas cards for his friends and business connections. They invariably consisted of a cartoon depicting a major political development of the outgoing year. He also imprinted on them his cartoonist coat of arms: a shield with a drawing of his face and the word &#x27;Kem&#x27; on a green field, supported on either side by an African man in white, wearing a red fez and bandana and cocking a snook. It was topped by a coronet with the motto at the bottom, &#x27;Après moi le déluge&#x27;.

He had two sons with his wife Una, Richard and Alexander.

<text>William Melville (25 April 1850 – 1 February 1918) was an Irish law enforcement officer and the first chief of the British Secret Service Bureau.

==Birth==
William Melville was born into a Roman Catholic family in Direenaclaurig Cross, Sneem, County Kerry, the son of a baker and publican. He moved to London in the 1860s and followed his father&#x27;s footsteps as a baker before he joined the Metropolitan Police in 1872.

==Scotland Yard==
In 1882 he was chosen to be one of the founding members of the Special Irish Branch that was founded to work against Fenians and anarchists. Melville was posted to the Le Havre port, during which posting his children, James Benjamin (1885) (later Sir James Melville KC) and Cecile Victorinne (1886; died in London in 1891), were born. In December 1888 Melville returned to London and was assigned to protect the Shah of Persia in his state visit. His duties later expanded to the protection of British Royal Family and he foiled the Jubilee Plot against Queen Victoria in 1887. In 1891 he began to campaign against anarchists by raiding and wrecking anarchist clubs and underground printing houses. He also revealed the Walsall Plot.

In 1893 Melville became Superintendent of Scotland Yard&#x27;s Special Branch when his predecessor John Littlechild retired to become a private investigator. When he fired veteran sergeant Patrick McIntyre, McIntyre went to press and claimed that Melville had instigated the whole Walsall Plot himself, a claim vindicated by police files released over 80 years later.

In the next ten years, Melville embarked on a large series of well-publicized raids against anarchists. He went to Victoria Station to personally arrest bomber Théodule Meunier. In 1896 Melville recruited Shlomo Rosenblum (later known as Sidney Reilly) as an informer in an organization he suspected to be involved with Russian anarchists.

In 1901 he worked with Gustav Steinhauer of the German Secret Service to thwart a plot against the Kaiser during the state funeral of Queen Victoria. In June 1900 Melville met future stage magician Harry Houdini when he came to Scotland Yard to showcase his abilities as an escapologist. When Houdini released himself easily from the police handcuffs, Melville befriended him and reputedly learned lock picking.

On 1 November 1903, Melville resigned as superintendent but was secretly recruited to lead a new intelligence section in the War Office, MO3, which was redesignated M05 in 1907. Working under commercial cover from an unassuming flat in London under the alias persona William Morgan, Melville ran both counterintelligence and foreign intelligence operations, capitalizing on the knowledge and foreign contacts he had accumulated during his years running Special Branch. In 1909 the Government Committee on Intelligence, with advocacy of Richard Burden Haldane and Winston Churchill, established a new Secret Service Bureau with a Home Section under command of Captain Sir Vernon Kell and a Foreign Section under Commander Sir Mansfield Cumming. Melville&#x27;s unit was folded into Kell&#x27;s department, which, while acting in Home matters, remained subordinate to the War Office. By 1910 it was clear that the Home Section and the Foreign Section would seek their own identities, and Kell&#x27;s department, the Security Service separated from Cummings&#x27; Secret Intelligence Service.

According to the conclusions of author Andrew Cook, his biographer, which are not accepted by all historians, Melville then became the head of British Secret Service with the code name &quot;M&quot;. Still, the service had a small budget and on occasion, Melville had to do the job himself.

==Secret Service Bureau==
Melville&#x27;s own section continued as a separate Special Section of the Secret Service Bureau and he concentrated on looking for German spies. In August 1914 the Bureau eventually identified the barbershop of Karl Gustav Ernst as the centre of a German spy ring.

==Death==
William Melville died of kidney failure in February 1918.

<text>Otak-otak (lit. brains in Malay and Indonesian; ) is a Southeast Asian fish cake made of ground fish mixed with spices and wrapped in leaf parcels. &quot;Otak-otak&quot; is traditionally served steamed or grilled, encased within the leaf parcel it is cooked in, and can be eaten solely as a snack or with steamed rice as part of a meal.

The earliest preparations of &quot;otak-otak&quot; is believed to have originated in Palembang cuisine of South Sumatra, where it takes the form of grilled banana leaf parcels filled with a mixture of ground fish, tapioca starch and spices. Regional varieties which bear the name &quot;otak-otak&quot; are widely known across Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries, though they may have little in common with the Palembang version. In Singapore and southern Malaysia, the reddish-orange or brown colour of its contents is acquired from chili, turmeric and other spices.

==Origins and distribution==


&quot;Otak-otak&quot; is widely spread on both sides of the Straits of Malacca. It is believed that the dish was a fusion of Malay (Palembangese) and Peranakan origins. In Indonesia, the name of the dish is said to be derived from the notion that the Palembang &quot;otak-otak&quot; resembles brain matter: the mixture of ground fish meat and tapioca starch is whitish grey, soft and almost squishy. From Palembang, it is believed to have spread to the islands of Sumatra, Java, and the rest of the Malay Peninsula. Three Indonesian cities are famous for their &quot;otak-otak&quot;: Palembang, Jakarta and Makassar. In Bangka island, the town of Belinyu is famous as a production center of &quot;otak-otak&quot;.

The town of Muar, Johor located south of West Peninsular Malaysia is renowned for its version of &quot;otak-otak&quot;. It is a culinary attraction for tourists from surrounding states and neighbouring Singapore, where the dish is known as &quot;otah&quot; or 烏打 in Chinese.

==Composition==
&quot;Otak-otak&quot; is made by mixing fish paste with a mixture of spices. The type of fish used to make &quot;otak-otak&quot; might vary: mackerel is commonly used in Malaysia, while &quot;ikan tenggiri&quot; (wahoo) is popular ingredient in Indonesia. Other types of fish such as &quot;bandeng&quot; (milkfish) and the more expensive &quot;ikan belida&quot; (featherback fish) might be used.

In Indonesia, the mixture typically contains fish paste, shallots, garlic, scallions, egg, coconut milk, and sago or tapioca starch. In Jakarta, Indonesia, one finds &quot;otak-otak&quot; being sold in small stalls near bus stops, especially during afternoon rush hour. In Makassar, the main ingredient is fresh king mackerel fish, also called king fish or spanish mackerel.

In Malaysia, it is usually a mixture between fish paste, chili peppers, garlic, shallots, turmeric, lemon grass and coconut milk. The mixture is then wrapped in either banana, coconut or nipa palm leaf that has been softened by steaming, then grilled or steamed.

==Regional varieties==
There are different varieties of &quot;otak-otak&quot; originating from different regions. Although &quot;otak-otak&quot; is traditionally made with fish meat, modern versions of &quot;otak-otak&quot; may use crab or prawn meat or even fish head.

In Indonesia, &quot;otak-otak&quot; is commonly associated with Palembang, South Sumatra. However, other regions in Indonesia are also popular for their &quot;otak-otak&quot; recipes, such as in Jakarta and Makassar. In Palembang, people eat &quot;otak-otak&quot; with &quot;cuko&quot; (Palembangese sweet and sour spicy vinegar sauce), while across the strait on Bangka Belitung islands, the slightly different sour &quot;cuko&quot; sauce is made with a mixture of vinegar, shrimp paste and fermented soybean paste. In Jakarta and Makassar however, it is enjoyed with spicy peanut sauce.

In Tanjungpinang, Bintan Island, &quot;otak-otak&quot; is generally made from fish and cuttlefish meat, also typical of this area is the use of fish bones. It is mixed with spices and wrapped using coconut leaves.

The &quot;otak-otak&quot; from southern Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore is wrapped up as a thin slice using banana or coconut leaf and grilled over a charcoal fire. As a result, it ends up drier and with a more distinct smoky fish aroma. Unlike the pale white colouration of most Indonesian &quot;otak-otak&quot;, &quot;otak-otak&quot; from Malaysia and Singapore is reddish-orange from the use of chilli paste and often heavily spiced.

Muar-style &quot;otak-otak&quot; is wrapped inside &quot;attap&quot; (&quot;Nipa palm&quot;) leaves and clipped using stapler or toothpick at both ends before being grilled or roasted on the stove. While fish &quot;otak-otak&quot; is most common, Muar-style &quot;otak-otak&quot; may also be made with prawns, cuttlefish, crab meat, fish head and even chicken. Besides being wrapped and grilled in &quot;attap&quot; leaf parcels. Muar-style &quot;otak-otak&quot; may be steamed as an alternative cooking method. 

Peranakan-style &quot;otak-otak&quot; (Malay: &quot;otak-otak Nyonya&quot;) from the northern Malaysian state of Penang is prepared with a mixture of ground fish, eggs, herbs, wrapped in banana leaf before steaming.

In the Philippines, Tausūg people created &quot;utak-utak&quot; made of shredded tuna meat mixed with spices, grated coconut and then fried in vegetable oil.

== Similar dishes ==
A type of delicacy similar to &quot;otak-otak&quot; from the Malaysian state of Terengganu is called &quot;sata&quot;. A similar Indonesian dish employing banana leaf is called pepes. Other types of &quot;otak-otak&quot; include dishes called &quot;pais ikan&quot;, &quot;botok&quot; that are made of fish paste cooked in banana leaves. 

The northern Philippine province of Pangasinan has a similar delicacy called &quot;tupig&quot;, which is cooked in the same manner as &quot;otak-otak&quot;, though &quot;tupig&quot; is sweetened. A thick batter made of glutinous rice flour (known locally as &quot;galapong&quot;) coconut strips, coconut milk, sugar and nuts is wrapped in banana leaves, and then grilled over coals.

<text>Count Jan Stefan Krukowiecki (; 1772–1850) was a Polish general and chairman of the Polish National Government (prezes Rządu Narodowego) during the November Uprising and general during Napoleonic Wars fighting in the troops of Napoleon.

==Early life and education==
Jan Krukowiecki was born on 15 December 1772 in Lwów. He studied at the Theresianum in Vienna and joined the Austrian army.

==Military career==
Krukowiecki fought in the campaigns against Turkish troops in the Balkans during the 6th Austro-Turkish War (1788-1791). In September 1794 Krukowiecki protested against the Austrian Habsburg monarchy response to the March–November 1794 Kościuszko Uprising by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and resigned his officer&#x27;s commission. He spent the next 12 years in retirement.

In 1806 Krukowiecki joined the French army and fought in Napoleon&#x27;s campaigns. In 1812 he was part of the Napoleon&#x27;s army in the war against Russia. He was wounded at Smolensk and received the Legion of Honour, was promoted to general of brigade and took command of a cavalry brigade. At the battle of Leipzig he fought under general Sokolnicki but failed to secure the Halle Gate.

On 1 March 1814 Krukowiecki received command of the Polish guard of honor at Versailles. In 1814 Tsar Alexander I commissioned Krukowiecki to go to England because of his knowledge of the language. He was to secure the reparations of Polish prisoners of war. When he returned to Paris, he saw that his conduct in Leipzig was questioned in a public pamphlet. He sued general Sokolnicki, who had written the pamphlet under a pseudonym, but lost.

Krukowiecki proceeded to report to the Tsar and arrived in Moscow in February 1815 before he returned to Paris. On 16 April the same year, during a banquet in honor of Russian and Polish officers, he stomped on Sokolnicki&#x27;s toe. He was subjected to a court martial but when Sokolnicki died in September 1816, Krukowiecki was merely removed from active army service and returned to Poland.

In August 1831 Krukowiecki became head of Polish government during the November Uprising, but had to surrender Warsaw to the Russians in September and was sent to Siberia. When he returned to Poland where he was tried for treason but acquitted. Krukowiecki settled on his wife&#x27;s estate at Popień, near Rogowo, where he died on 17 April 1850.

<doc id="1211527" wikidata="Q2080106" url="?curid=1211527" title="History of the United Kingdom during the First World War">
<text>The United Kingdom was a leading Allied Power during the First World War of 1914–1918. They fought against the Central Powers, mainly Germany. The armed forces were greatly expanded and reorganised—the war marked the founding of the Royal Air Force. The highly controversial introduction, in January 1916, of conscription for the first time in British history followed the raising of one of the largest all-volunteer armies in history, known as Kitchener&#x27;s Army, of more than 2,000,000 men. The outbreak of war was a socially unifying event. Enthusiasm was widespread in 1914, and was similar to that across Europe.

On the eve of war, there was serious domestic unrest amongst the labour and suffrage movements and especially in Ireland. But those conflicts were postponed. Significant sacrifices were called for in the name of defeating the Empire&#x27;s enemies and many of those who could not fight contributed to philanthropic and humanitarian causes. Fearing food shortages and labour shortfalls, the government passed legislation such as the Defence of the Realm Act 1914, to give it new powers. The war saw a move away from the idea of &quot;business as usual&quot; under Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, and towards a state of total war (complete state intervention in public affairs) by 1917 under the premiership of David Lloyd George; the first time this had been seen in Britain. The war also witnessed the first aerial bombardments of cities in Britain.

Newspapers played an important role in maintaining popular support for the war. Large quantities of propaganda were produced by the government under the guidance of such journalists as Charles Masterman and newspaper owners such as Lord Beaverbrook. By adapting to the changing demographics of the workforce (or the &quot;dilution of labour&quot;, as it was termed), war-related industries grew rapidly, and production increased, as concessions were quickly made to trade unions. In that regard, the war is also credited by some with drawing women into mainstream employment for the first time. Debates continue about the impact the war had on women&#x27;s emancipation, given that a large number of women were granted the vote for the first time in 1918. The experience of individual women during the war varied; much depended on locality, age, marital status and occupation.

The civilian death rate rose due to food shortages and Spanish flu, which hit the country in 1918. Military deaths are estimated to have exceeded 850,000. The Empire reached its zenith at the conclusion of peace negotiations. However, the war heightened not only imperial loyalties but also individual national identities in the Dominions (Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa) and India. Irish nationalists after 1916 moved from collaboration with London to demands for immediate independence (see Easter Rising), a move given great impetus by the Conscription Crisis of 1918. In the United Kingdom, the cultural view of the conflict overall and British participation in particular has generally been critical, though some historians disagree with this interpretation. Research conducted for the centenary of the conflict suggested that the modern public tended to view British involvement in the First World War in a positive light with the exception of believing that the performance of generals was inadequate. But that knowledge of the conflict was limited and that some details seemed to be confused with the Second World War.

==Government==
===Asquith as prime minister===

On 4 August 1914, King George V declared war on the advice of his prime minister, H. H. Asquith, leader of the Liberal Party. Britain&#x27;s basic reasons for declaring war focused on a deep commitment to France and avoidance of splitting the Liberal Party. Top Liberals threatened to resign if the cabinet refused to support France—which would mean loss of control of the government to a coalition or to the Unionist (i.e. Conservative) opposition. 
However, the large antiwar element among Liberals would support the war to honour the 1839 treaty regarding guarantees of Belgian neutrality, so that, rather than France, was the public reason given. Therefore, the public reason given out by the government, and used in posters, was that Britain was required to safeguard Belgium&#x27;s neutrality under the 1839 Treaty of London.
The strategic risk posed by German control of the Belgian and ultimately French coast was considered unacceptable. German guarantees of post-war behaviour were cast into doubt by her blasé treatment of Belgian neutrality. However, the Treaty of London had not committed Britain on her own to safeguard Belgium&#x27;s neutrality. Moreover, naval war planning demonstrated that Britain herself would have violated Belgian neutrality by blockading her ports (to prevent imported goods passing to Germany) in the event of war with Germany.

Britain&#x27;s duty to her Entente partners, both France and Russia, were paramount factors. The Foreign Secretary Edward Grey argued that the secret naval agreements with France created a moral obligation &#x27;to save France from defeat by Germany. British national interest rejected German control of France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Grey warned that to abandon its allies would be a permanent disaster: if Germany won the war, or the Entente won without British support, then, either way, Britain would be left without any friends. This would have left both Britain and her Empire vulnerable to isolation.

Eyre Crowe, a senior Foreign office expert said:
Should the war come, and England stand aside, one of two things must happen. (a) Either Germany and Austria win, crush France and humiliate Russia. What will be the position of a friendless England? (b) Or France and Russia win. What would be their attitude towards England? What about India and the Mediterranean?
===Crisis of Liberal leadership===
The Liberal Party might have survived a short war, but the totality of the Great War called for strong measures that the party had long rejected. The result was the permanent destruction of the ability of the Liberal Party to lead a government. Historian Robert Blake explains the dilemma:
: the Liberals were traditionally the party of freedom of speech, conscience and trade. They were against jingoism, heavy armaments and compulsion...Liberals were neither wholehearted nor unanimous about conscription, censorship, the Defence of the Realm Act, severity toward aliens and pacifists, direction of labour and industry. The Conservatives... had no such misgivings.
Blake further notes that it was the Liberals, not the Conservatives who needed the moral outrage of Belgium to justify going to war, while the Conservatives called for intervention from the start of the crisis on the grounds of &quot;realpolitik&quot; and the balance of power.

The British people were disappointed that there was no quick victory in the war. They had long taken great pride and expense in the Royal Navy, but now there was little to cheer about. The Battle of Jutland in May 1916 was the first and only time the German fleet challenged control of the North Sea, but it was overmatched and was reassigned mostly to helping the more important U-boats. Since the Liberals ran the war without consulting the Unionists (Conservatives) there were heavy partisan attacks. However even Liberal commentators were dismayed by the lack of energy at the top. At the time public opinion was intensely hostile, both in the media and in the street, against any young man in civilian garb and labeled as a slacker. The leading Liberal newspaper, the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; complained:
:The fact that the Government has not dared to challenge the nation to rise above itself, is one among many signs... The war is, in fact, not being taken seriously... How can any slacker be blamed when the Government itself is slack.

Asquith&#x27;s Liberal government was brought down in , due in particular to a crisis of inadequate artillery shell production and the protest resignation of Admiral Fisher over the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign against Turkey. Reluctant to face doom in an election, Asquith formed a new coalition government on , with the majority of the new cabinet coming from his own Liberal party and the Unionist (Conservative) party, along with a token Labour representation. The new government lasted a year and a half, and this was the last time Liberals controlled the government. The analysis of historian A. J. P. Taylor is that the British people were so deeply divided over numerous issues, but on all sides there was growing distrust for the Asquith government. There was no agreement whatsoever on wartime issues. The leaders of the two parties realized that embittered debates in Parliament would further undermine popular morale, and so the House of Commons did not once discuss the war before May 1915. Taylor argues: 
:The Unionists, by and large, regarded Germany as a dangerous rival, and rejoiced at the chance to destroy her. They meant to fight a hard-headed war by ruthless methods; the condemned Liberal &#x27;softness&#x27; before the war and now. The Liberals insisted on remaining high-minded. Many of them come to support the war only when the Germans invaded Belgium...Entering the war for idealistic motives, the Liberals wish to fight it by noble means and found it harder to abandon their principles than to endure your defeat in the field.

===Lloyd George as prime minister===

This coalition government lasted until 1916, when the Unionists became dissatisfied with Asquith and the Liberals&#x27; conduct of affairs, particularly over the Battle of the Somme. Asquith&#x27;s opponents now took control, led by Bonar Law (leader of the Conservatives), Sir Edward Carson (leader of the Ulster Unionists), and David Lloyd George (then a minister in the cabinet). Law, who had few allies outside his own party, lacked sufficient support to form a new coalition; the Liberal Lloyd George, on the other hand, enjoyed much wider support and duly formed a majority-Conservative coalition government with Lloyd George Liberals and Labour. Asquith was still the party head but he and his followers moved to the opposition benches in Parliament.

Lloyd George immediately set about transforming the British war effort, taking firm control of both military and domestic policy. In the first 235 days of its existence, the War Cabinet met 200 times. Its creation marked the transition to a state of total war—the idea that every man, woman and child should play his or her part in the war effort. Moreover, it was decided that members of the government should be the men who controlled the war effort, primarily utilising the power they had been given under the Defence of the Realm Act. For the first time, the government could react quickly, without endless bureaucracy to tie it down, and with up-to-date statistics on such matters as the state of the merchant navy and farm production. The policy marked a distinct shift away from Asquith&#x27;s initial policy of laissez-faire, which had been characterised by Winston Churchill&#x27;s declaration of &quot;business as usual&quot; in . The success of Lloyd George&#x27;s government can also be attributed to a general lack of desire for an election, and the practical absence of dissent that this brought about.

 In rapid succession in spring 1918 came a series of military and political crises. The Germans, having moved troops from the Eastern front and retrained them in new tactics, now had more soldiers on the Western Front than the Allies. On 21 March 1918 Germany launched a full scale Spring Offensive against the British and French lines, hoping for victory on the battlefield before United States troops arrived in large numbers. The Allied armies fell back 40 miles in confusion, and facing defeat London realized it needed more troops to fight a mobile war. Lloyd George found half a million soldiers and rushed them to France, asked American President Woodrow Wilson for immediate help, and agreed to the appointment of the French General Foch as commander in chief on the Western Front, so that Allied forces could be coordinated to handle the German offensive.

Despite strong warnings that it was a bad idea, the War Cabinet decided to impose conscription on Ireland in 1918. The main reason was that labour in Britain demanded it as the price for cutting back on exemptions from conscription for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that conscription should actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted, but never enforced. The Roman Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray, calling for open resistance to compulsory military service, while the majority of Irish nationalists moved to supporting the intransigent Sinn Féin movement (away from the constitutional Irish National Party). This proved a decisive moment, marking the end of Irish willingness to stay inside the Union.

On , a senior army officer on active duty, Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice, prompted a second crisis when he went public with allegations that Lloyd George had lied to Parliament about troop numbers in France. Asquith, the Liberal leader in the House, took up the allegations and attacked Lloyd George (also a Liberal). While Asquith&#x27;s presentation was poor, Lloyd George vigorously defended his position, treating the debate as a vote of confidence. He won over the House with a powerful refutation of Maurice&#x27;s allegations. The main results were to strengthen Lloyd George, weaken Asquith, end public criticism of overall strategy, and strengthen civilian control of the military. Meanwhile, the German offensive stalled and was ultimately reversed. Victory came on 11 November 1918.

Historian George H. Cassar has evaluated Lloyd George&#x27;s legacy as a war leader:
:After all that has been said and done, what are we to make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he achieved varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lloyd George&#x27;s contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him in the pantheon of Britain&#x27;s outstanding war leaders.

===Collapse of the Liberal Party===
In the general election of 1918, Lloyd George, &quot;the Man Who Won the War&quot;, led his coalition into another &quot;khaki election&quot; and won a sweeping victory over the Asquithian Liberals and the newly emerging Labour Party. Lloyd George and the Conservative leader Bonar Law wrote a joint letter of support to candidates to indicate they were considered the official Coalition candidates – this &quot;coupon&quot;, as it became known, was issued to opponents of many sitting Liberal MPs, devastating the incumbents. Asquith and most of his Liberal colleagues lost their seats. Lloyd George was increasingly under the influence of the rejuvenated Conservative party. The Liberal party never fully recovered.

===Finance===
Before the war, the government spent 13 percent of gross national product (GNP); in 1918 it spent 59 percent of GNP. The war was financed by borrowing large sums at home and abroad, by new taxes, and by inflation. It was implicitly financed by postponing maintenance and repair, as well as cancelling projects deemed unnecessary. The government avoided indirect taxes because they raised the cost of living, and caused discontent among the working class. In 1913–14, indirect taxes on tobacco and alcohol yielded £75 million, while direct taxes yielded £88 million, including an income tax of £44 million and estate duties of £22 million. That is, 54 percent of revenue came from direct taxes; by 1918, direct taxes were 80 percent of revenue. There was a strong emphasis on being &quot;fair&quot; and being &quot;scientific.&quot; The public generally supported the heavy new taxes, with minimal complaints. The Treasury rejected proposals for a stiff capital levy, which the Labour Party wanted to use to weaken the capitalists. Instead, there was an excess profits tax, of 50 percent of profits above the normal prewar level; the rate was raised to 80 percent in 1917. Excise taxes were added on luxury imports such as automobiles, clocks and watches. There was no sales tax or value added tax. The main increase in revenue came from income tax, which in 1915 went up to 3s. 6d in the pound (17.5%), and individual exemptions were lowered. The income tax rate grew to 5s in the pound (25%) in 1916, and 6s (30%) in 1918. Altogether, taxes provided at most 30 percent of national expenditure, with the rest from borrowing. The national debt soared from £625 million to £7,800 million. Government bonds typically paid five percent. Inflation escalated so that the pound in 1919 purchased only a third of the basket it had purchased it 1914. Wages were laggard, and the poor and retired were especially hard hit.

==Monarchy==

The British royal family faced a serious problem during the First World War because of its blood ties to the ruling family of Germany, Britain&#x27;s prime adversary in the war. Before the war, the British royal family had been known as the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1910, George V became king on the death of his father, Edward VII, and reigned throughout the war. He was the first cousin of the German Emperor Wilhelm II, who came to symbolise all the horrors of the war. Queen Mary, although British like her mother, was the daughter of the Duke of Teck, a descendant of the royal House of Württemberg. During the war H. G. Wells wrote about Britain&#x27;s &quot;alien and uninspiring court&quot;, and George famously replied: &quot;I may be uninspiring, but I&#x27;ll be damned if I&#x27;m alien.&quot;

On 17 July 1917, to appease British nationalist feelings, King George issued an Order in Council that changed the name of his family to the House of Windsor. He specifically adopted Windsor as the surname for all descendants of Queen Victoria then living in Britain, excluding women who married into other families and their descendants. He and his relatives who were British subjects relinquished the use of all German titles and styles, and adopted English surnames. George compensated several of his male relatives by creating them British peers. Thus, his cousin, Prince Louis of Battenberg, became the Marquess of Milford Haven, while his brother-in-law, the Duke of Teck, became the Marquess of Cambridge. Others, such as Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein and Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, simply stopped using their territorial designations. The system for titling members of the royal family was also simplified. Relatives of the British royal family who fought on the German side were simply cut off; their British peerages were suspended by a 1919 Order in Council under the provisions of the Titles Deprivation Act 1917.
Developments in Russia posed another set of issues for the monarchy. Tsar Nicholas II of Russia was King George&#x27;s first cousin and the two monarchs looked very much alike. When Nicholas was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the liberal Russian Government asked that the tsar and his family be given asylum in Britain. The cabinet agreed but the king was worried that public opinion was hostile and said no. It is likely the tsar would have refused to leave Russia in any case. He remained and in 1918 he and his family were ordered killed by Lenin, the Bolshevik leader.

The Prince of Wales – the future Edward VIII – was keen to participate in the war but the government refused to allow it, citing the immense harm that would occur if the heir to the throne were captured. Despite this, Edward witnessed trench warfare at first hand and attempted to visit the front line as often as he could, for which he was awarded the Military Cross in 1916. His role in the war, although limited, led to his great popularity among veterans of the conflict.
Other members of the royal family were similarly involved. The Duke of York (later George VI) was commissioned in the Royal Navy and saw action as a turret officer aboard HMS &quot;Collingwood&quot; at the battle of Jutland but saw no further action in the war, largely because of ill health. Princess Mary, the King&#x27;s only daughter, visited hospitals and welfare organisations with her mother, assisting with projects to give comfort to British servicemen and assistance to their families. One of these projects was Princess Mary&#x27;s &quot;Christmas Gift Fund&quot;, through which £162,000 worth of gifts was sent to all British soldiers and sailors for Christmas 1914. She took an active role in promoting the Girl Guide movement, the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD), the Land Girls and in 1918, she took a nursing course and went to work at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

==Defence of the Realm Act==

The first Defence of the Realm Act (DORA) was passed on 1914, during the early weeks of the war, though in the next few months its provisions were extended. It gave the government wide-ranging powers, such as the ability to requisition buildings or land needed for the war effort. Some of the things the British public were prohibited from doing included loitering under railway bridges, feeding wild animals and discussing naval and military matters. British Summer Time was also introduced. Alcoholic beverages were now to be watered down, pub closing times were brought forward from to , and, from , Londoners were no longer able to whistle for a cab between and . It has been criticised for both its strength and its use of the death penalty as a deterrent – although the act itself did not refer to the death penalty, it made provision for civilians breaking these rules to be tried in army courts martial, where the maximum penalty was death.

==Internment==

The Aliens Restriction Act, passed on 5 August, required all foreign nationals to register with the police, and by 9 September just under 67,000 German, Austrian and Hungarian nationals had done so. Citizens of enemy states were subject to restrictions on travel, possession of equipment that might be used for espionage, and residence in areas likely to be invaded. The government was reluctant to impose widespread internment. It rescinded a military decision of 7 August 1914 to intern all nationals of enemy states between the ages of 17 and 42, and focussed instead only on those suspected of being a threat to national security. By September, 10,500 aliens were being held, but between November 1914 and April 1915 few arrests were made and thousands of internees were actually released. Public anti-German sentiment, which had been building since October following reports of German atrocities in Belgium, peaked after the sinking of the RMS Lusitania on 7 May 1915. The incident prompted a week of rioting across the country, during which virtually every German-owned shop had its windows smashed. The reaction forced the government to implement a tougher policy on internment, as much for the aliens own safety as for the security of the country. All non-naturalised enemy nationals of military age were to be interned, while those over military age were to be repatriated, and by 1917 only a small number of enemy nationals were still residing at liberty.

==Armed forces==
===Army===

The British Army during the First World War was small in size when compared to the other major European powers. In 1914, the British had a small, largely urban English, volunteer force of 400,000 soldiers, almost half of whom were posted overseas to garrison the immense British Empire. (In , 74 of the 157 infantry battalions and 12 of the 31 cavalry regiments were posted overseas.) This total included the Regular Army and reservists in the Territorial Force. Together they formed the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), for service in France and became known as the Old Contemptibles. The mass of volunteers in 1914–1915, popularly known as Kitchener&#x27;s Army, was destined to go into action at the battle of the Somme. In , conscription was introduced (initially of single men, extended to married men in May), and by the end of 1918, the army had reached its peak of strength of 4.5 million men.

===Royal Navy===
The Royal Navy at the start of the war was the largest navy in the world due, for the most part, to the Naval Defence Act 1889 and the two-power standard which called for the navy to maintain a number of battleships such as their strength was at least equal to the combined strength of the next two largest navies in the world, which at that point were France and Russia.

The major part of the Royal Navy&#x27;s strength was deployed at home in the Grand Fleet, with the primary aim of drawing the German High Seas Fleet into an engagement. No decisive victory ever came. The Royal Navy and the German Imperial Navy did come into contact, notably in the Battle of Heligoland Bight, and at the Battle of Jutland. In view of their inferior numbers and firepower, the Germans devised a plan to draw part of the British fleet into a trap and put it into effect at Jutland in , but the result was inconclusive. In , the High Seas Fleet tried a similar enticement operation and was &quot;lucky to escape annihilation&quot;. The lessons learned by the Royal Navy at Jutland made it a more effective force in the future.

In 1914, the navy had also formed the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division from reservists, and this served extensively in the Mediterranean and on the Western Front. Almost half of the Royal Navy casualties during the War were sustained by this division, fighting on land and not at sea.

===British air services===
At the start of the war, the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), commanded by David Henderson, was sent to France and was first used for aerial spotting in , but only became efficient when they perfected the use of wireless communication at Aubers Ridge on 1915. Aerial photography was attempted during 1914, but again only became effective the next year. In 1915 Hugh Trenchard replaced Henderson and the RFC adopted an aggressive posture. By 1918, photographic images could be taken from , and interpreted by over 3,000 personnel. Planes did not carry parachutes until 1918, though they had been available since before the war.
On 17 August 1917, General Jan Smuts presented a report to the War Council on the future of air power. Because of its potential for the &#x27;devastation of enemy lands and the destruction of industrial and populous centres on a vast scale&#x27;, he recommended a new air service be formed that would be on a level with the army and navy. The formation of the new service however would make the under utilised men and machines of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) available for action across the Western Front, as well as ending the inter-service rivalries that at times had adversely affected aircraft procurement. On 1918, the RFC and the RNAS were amalgamated to form a new service, the Royal Air Force (RAF).

==Recruitment and conscription==
Particularly in the early stages of the war, many men, for a wide variety of reasons, decided to &quot;join up&quot; to the armed forces—by 1914, over 225,000 had signed up to fight for what became known as Kitchener&#x27;s Army. Over the course of the war, a number of factors contributed to recruitment rates, including patriotism, the work of the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee in producing posters, dwindling alternative employment opportunities, and an eagerness for adventure to escape humdrum routine. Pals battalions, where whole battalions were raised from a small geographic area or employer, also proved popular. Higher recruitment rates were seen in England and Scotland, though in the case of the Welsh and Irish, political tensions tended to &quot;put something of a blight upon enlistment&quot;.

Recruitment remained fairly steady through 1914 and early 1915, but fell dramatically during the later years, especially after the Somme campaign, which resulted in 500,000 casualties. As a result, conscription was introduced for the first time in for single men, and extended in May–June to all men aged 18 to 41 across England, Wales and Scotland, by way of the Military Service Acts.

Urban centres, with their poverty and unemployment were favourite recruiting grounds of the regular British army. Dundee, where the female dominated jute industry limited male employment had one of the highest proportion of reservists and serving soldiers than almost any other British city. Concern for their families&#x27; standard of living made men hesitate to enlist; voluntary enlistment rates went up after the government guaranteed a weekly stipend for life to the survivors of men who were killed or disabled. After the introduction of conscription from January 1916, every region of the country, outside of Ireland, was affected. 
The policy of relying on volunteers had sharply reduced the capacity of heavy industry to produce the munitions needed for the war. Historian R. J. Q. Adams reports that 19% of the men in the iron and steel industry entered the Army, 22% of the miners, 20% in the engineering trades, 24% in the electrical industries, 16% among small arms craftsmen, and 24% of the men who had been engaged in making high explosives. In response critical industries were prioritised over the army (&quot;reserved occupations&quot;), including munitions, food production and merchant shipping.

===Conscription Crisis of 1918===

In April 1918 legislation was brought forward which allowed for extension of conscription to Ireland. Though this ultimately never materialised, the effect was &quot;disastrous&quot;. Despite significant numbers volunteering for Irish regiments, the idea of &quot;enforced&quot; conscription proved unpopular. The reaction was based particularly on the fact that implementation of conscription in Ireland was linked to a pledged &quot;measure of self-government in Ireland&quot;. The linking of conscription and Home Rule in this way outraged the Irish parties at Westminster, who walked out in protest and returned to Ireland to organise opposition. As a result, a general strike was called, and on 1918, work was stopped in railways, docks, factories, mills, theatres, cinemas, trams, public services, shipyards, newspapers, shops, and even official munitions factories. The strike was described as &quot;complete and entire, an unprecedented event outside the continental countries&quot;. Ultimately the effect was a total loss of interest in Home Rule and of popular support for the nationalist Irish Party who were defeated outright by the separatist republican Sinn Féin party in the December 1918 Irish general election, one of the precursors of the Anglo-Irish War.

===Conscientious objectors===
The conscription legislation introduced the right to refuse military service, allowing for conscientious objectors to be absolutely exempted, to perform alternative civilian service, or to serve as a non-combatant in the army, according to the extent to which they could convince a Military Service Tribunal of the quality of their objection. Around 16,500 men were recorded as conscientious objectors, with Quakers playing a large role. Some 4,500 objectors were sent to work on farms to undertake &quot;work of national importance&quot;, 7,000 were ordered non-combatant duties as stretcher bearers, but 6,000 were forced into the army, and when they refused orders, they were sent to prison, as in the case of the Richmond Sixteen.
Some 843 conscientious objectors spent more than two years in prison; ten died while there, seventeen were initially given the death penalty (but received life imprisonment) and 142 were imprisoned on life sentences. Conscientious objectors who were deemed not to have made any useful contribution were disenfranchised for five years after the war.

==Naval and air raids==

At the start of the First World War, for the first time since the Napoleonic Wars, the population of the British Isles was in danger of attack from naval raids. The country also came under attack from air raids by zeppelins and fixed-wing aircraft, another first.

===Naval raids===

The Raid on Yarmouth, which took place in , was an attack by the German Navy on the British North Sea port and town of Great Yarmouth. Little damage was done to the town itself, since shells only landed on the beach once German ships laying mines offshore were interrupted by British destroyers. One British submarine was sunk by a mine as it attempted to leave harbour and attack the German ships, while one German armoured cruiser was sunk after striking two mines outside its own home port.

In December 1914, the German navy carried out attacks on the British coastal towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby. The attack resulted in 137 fatalities and 593 casualties, many of which were civilians. The attack made the German navy very unpopular with the British public, as an attack against British civilians in their homes. Likewise, the British Royal Navy was criticised for failing to prevent the raid.

===Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft===

In April 1916 a German battlecruiser squadron with accompanying cruisers and destroyers bombarded the coastal ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft. Although the ports had some military importance, the main aim of the raid was to entice out defending ships which could then be picked off either by the battlecruiser squadron or by the full High Seas Fleet, which was stationed at sea ready to intervene if an opportunity presented itself. The result was inconclusive: nearby Royal Navy units were too small to intervene so largely kept clear of the German battlecruisers, and the German ships withdrew before the first British fast response battlecruiser squadron or the Grand Fleet could arrive.

===Air raids===

German zeppelins bombed towns on the east coast, starting on 1915 with Great Yarmouth. London was also hit later in the same year, on . Propaganda supporting the British war effort often used these raids to their advantage: one recruitment poster claimed: &quot;It is far better to face the bullets than to be killed at home by a bomb&quot; (see image). The reaction from the public, however, was mixed; whilst 10,000 visited Scarborough to view the damage there, London theatres reported having fewer visitors during periods of &quot;Zeppelin weather&quot;—dark, fine nights.

Throughout 1917 Germany began to deploy increasing numbers of fixed-wing bombers, the Gotha G.IV&#x27;s first target being Folkestone on 1917, following this attack the number of airship raids decreased rapidly in favour of raids by fixed wing aircraft, before Zeppelin raids were called off entirely. In total, Zeppelins dropped 6,000 bombs, resulting in 556 dead and 1,357 wounded. Soon after the raid on Folkestone, the bombers began raids on London: one daylight raid on 1917 by 14 Gothas caused 162 deaths in the East End of London. In response to this new threat, Major General Edward Bailey Ashmore, a RFC pilot who later commanded an artillery division in Belgium, was appointed to devise an improved system of detection, communication and control, The system, called the &quot;Metropolitan Observation Service&quot;, encompassed the London Air Defence Area and would later extend eastwards towards the Kentish and Essex coasts. The Metropolitan Observation Service was fully operational until the late summer of 1918 (the last German bombing raid taking place on 1918).

During the war, the Germans carried out 51 airship raids and 52 fixed-wing bomber raids on England, which together dropped 280 tons of bombs. The casualties amounted to 1,413 killed, and 3,409 wounded. The success of anti-air defence measures was limited; of the 397 aircraft that had taken part in raids, only 24 Gothas were shot down (though 37 more were lost in accidents), despite an estimated rate of 14,540 anti-air rounds per aircraft. Anti-zeppelin defences were more successful, with 17 shot down and 21 lost in accidents.

==Media==
===Propaganda===

Propaganda and censorship were closely linked during the war. The need to maintain morale and counter German propaganda was recognised early in the war and the War Propaganda Bureau was established under the leadership of Charles Masterman in . The Bureau enlisted eminent writers such as H. G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, Rudyard Kipling as well as newspaper editors. Until its abolition in 1917, the department published 300 books and pamphlets in 21 languages, distributed over 4,000 propaganda photographs every week, and circulated maps, cartoons, and lantern slides to the media. Masterman also commissioned films about the war such as The Battle of the Somme, which appeared in , while the battle was still in progress as a morale-booster and in general it met with a favourable reception. &quot;The Times&quot; reported on 1916 that&quot;
:Crowded audiences ... were interested and thrilled to have the realities of war brought so vividly before them, and if women had sometimes to shut their eyes to escape for a moment from the tragedy of the toll of battle which the film presents, opinion seems to be general that it was wise that the people at home should have this glimpse of what our soldiers are doing and daring and suffering in Picardy.
The media—including the press, film, posters and billboards—were called to arms as propaganda for the masses. The manipulators favoured upper-and middle-class authoritative characters to educate the masses. At the time cinema audience were largely working class blokes. By contrast in World War Two, equality was a theme and class differentials were downplayed.

===Newspapers===
Newspapers during the war were subject to the &quot;Defence of the Realm Act&quot;, which eventually had two regulations restricting what they could publish: Regulation 18, which prohibited the leakage of sensitive military information, troop and shipping movements; and Regulation 27, which made it an offence to &quot;spread false reports&quot;, &quot;spread reports that were likely to prejudice recruiting&quot;, &quot;undermine public confidence in banks or currency&quot; or cause &quot;disaffection to His Majesty&quot;. Where the official Press Bureau failed (it had no statutory powers until ), the newspaper editors and owners operated a ruthless self-censorship. Having worked for government, press barons Viscount Rothermere, Baron Beaverbrook (in a sea of controversy), and Viscount Northcliffe all received titles. For these reasons, it has been concluded that censorship, which at its height suppressed only socialist journals (and briefly the right wing &quot;The Globe&quot;) had less effect on the British press than the reductions in advertising revenues and cost increases which they also faced during the war. One major loophole in the official censorship lay with parliamentary privilege, when anything said in Parliament could be reported freely. The most infamous act of censorship in the early days of the war was the sinking of HMS &quot;Audacious&quot; in , when the press was directed not to report on the loss, despite the sinking being observed by passengers on the liner RMS &quot;Olympic&quot; and quickly reported in the American press.

The most popular papers of the period included dailies such as &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and &quot;The Morning Post&quot;, weekly newspapers such as &quot;The Graphic&quot; and periodicals like &quot;John Bull&quot;, which claimed a weekly circulation of 900,000. The public demand for news of the war was reflected in the increased sales of newspapers. After the German Navy raid on Hartlepool and Scarborough, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; devoted three full pages to the raid and the &quot;Evening News&quot; reported that &quot;The Times&quot; had sold out by a quarter past nine in the morning, even with inflated prices. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; itself increased in circulation from 800,000 a day in 1914 to by 1916.

===News magazines===
The public&#x27;s thirst for news and information was in part satisfied by news magazines, which were dedicated to reporting the war. They included amongst others &quot;The War Illustrated&quot;, &quot;The Illustrated War News&quot;, and &quot;The War Pictorial&quot;, and were lavishly filled with photographs and illustrations, regardless of their target audience. Magazines were produced for all classes, and ranged both in price and tone. Many otherwise famous writers contributed towards these publications, of which H.G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle and Rudyard Kipling were three examples. Editorial guidelines varied; in cheaper publications especially it was considered more important to create a sense of patriotism than to relay up-to-the-minutes news of developments of the front. Stories of German atrocities were commonplace.

===Motion pictures===

The 1916 British film &quot;The Battle of the Somme&quot;, by two official cinematographers, Geoffrey Malins and John McDowell, combined documentary and propaganda, seeking to give the public an impression of what trench warfare was like. Much of the film was shot on location at the Western Front in France; it had a powerful emotional impact. It was watched by some 20 million people in Britain in its six weeks of exhibition, making it what the critic Francine Stock called &quot;one of the most successful films of all time&quot;.

===Music===
On 13 August 1914, the Irish regiment the Connaught Rangers were witnessed singing &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot; as they marched through Boulogne by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; correspondent George Curnock, who reported the event in that newspaper on 1914. The song was then picked up by other units of the British Army. In , it was sung in a pantomime by the well-known music hall singer Florrie Forde, which helped contribute to its worldwide popularity.
Another song from 1916, which became very popular as a music hall and marching song, boosting British morale despite the horrors of that war, was &quot;Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit-Bag&quot;.

===War poems===

There was also a notable group of war poets who wrote about their own experiences of war, which caught the public attention. Some died on active service, most famously Rupert Brooke, Isaac Rosenberg, and Wilfred Owen, while some, such as Siegfried Sassoon survived. Themes of the poems included the youth (or naivety) of the soldiers, and the dignified manner in which they fought and died. This is evident in lines such as &quot;They fell with their faces to the foe&quot;, from the &quot;Ode of Remembrance&quot; taken from Laurence Binyon&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, which was first published in &quot;The Times&quot; in . Female poets such as Vera Brittain also wrote from the home front, to lament the losses of brothers and lovers fighting on the front.

==Economy==

On the whole the British successfully managed the economics of the war. There had been no prewar plan for mobilization of economic resources. Controls were imposed slowly, as one urgent need followed another. With the City of London the world&#x27;s financial capital, it was possible to handle finances smoothly; in all Britain spent 4 million pounds everyday on the war effort.

The economy (in terms of GDP) grew about 14% from 1914 to 1918 despite the absence of so many men in the services; by contrast the German economy shrank 27%. The War saw a decline of civilian consumption, with a major reallocation to munitions. The government share of GDP soared from 8% in 1913 to 38% in 1918 (compared to 50% in 1943). The war forced Britain to use up its financial reserves and borrow large sums from private and government creditors in the United States. Shipments of American raw materials and food allowed Britain to feed itself and its army while maintaining productivity. The financing was generally successful, as London&#x27;s strong financial position minimized the damaging effects of inflation, as opposed to much worse conditions in Germany. Overall consumer consumption declined 18% from 1914 to 1919. Women were available and many entered munitions factories and took other home front jobs vacated by men.

Scotland specialized in providing manpower, ships, machinery, food (particularly fish) and money. Its shipbuilding industry expanding by a third.

===Rationing===

In line with its &quot;business as usual&quot; policy, the government was initially reluctant to try to control the food markets. It fought off efforts to try to introduce minimum prices in cereal production, though relenting in the area of controlling of essential imports (sugar, meat and grains). When it did introduce changes, they were only limited in their effect. In 1916, it became illegal to consume more than two courses whilst lunching in a public eating place or more than three for dinner; fines were introduced for members of the public found feeding the pigeons or stray animals.

In January 1917, Germany started using U-boats (submarines) in order to sink Allied and later neutral ships bringing food to the country in an attempt to starve Britain into defeat under their unrestricted submarine warfare programme. One response to this threat was to introduce voluntary rationing in , a sacrifice promoted by the King and Queen themselves. Bread was subsidised from September that year; prompted by local authorities taking matters into their own hands, compulsory rationing was introduced in stages between and , as Britain&#x27;s supply of wheat stores decreased to just six weeks worth. For the most part it benefited the health of the country, through the levelling of consumption of essential foods. To operate rationing, ration books were introduced on 1918 for butter, margarine, lard, meat, and sugar. During the war, average calorific intake decreased only three percent, but protein intake six percent.

===Industry===

Total British production fell by ten percent over the course of the war; there were, however, increases in certain industries such as steel. Although Britain faced a highly contentious Shell Crisis of 1915 With severe shortages of artillery shells on the Western Front. New leadership was called for. In 1915, a powerful new Ministry of Munitions under David Lloyd George was formed to control munitions production.

The Government&#x27;s policy, according to historian and Conservative politician J. A. R. Marriott, was that:
: No private interest was to be permitted to obstruct the service, or imperil the safety, of the State. Trade Union regulations must be suspended; employers&#x27; profits must be limited, skilled men must fight, if not in the trenches, in the factories; man-power must be economized by the dilution of labour and the employment of women; private factories must pass under the control of the State, and new national factories be set up. Results justified the new policy: the output was prodigious; the goods were at last delivered.

By , just two million rounds of shells had been sent to France; by the end of the war the figure had reached , and a year&#x27;s worth of pre-war production of light munitions could be completed in just four days by 1918. Aircraft production in 1914 provided employment for 60,000 men and women; by 1918 British firms employed over 347,000.

===Labour===
Industrial production of munitions was a central feature of the war, and with a third of the men in the labour force moved into the military, demand was very high for industrial labour. Large numbers of women were employed temporarily. Most trade unions gave strong support to the war effort, cutting back on strikes and restrictive practices. However the coal miners and engineers were less enthusiastic. Trade unions were encouraged as membership grew from 4.1 million in 1914 to 6.5 million in 1918, peaking at 8.3 million in 1920 before relapsing to 5.4 million in 1923. In 1914, 65% of union members had been associated with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) rising to 77% in 1920. Women were grudgingly admitted to the trade unions. Looking at a union of unskilled workers, Cathy Hunt concludes its regard for women workers, &quot;was at best inconsistent and at worst aimed almost entirely at improving and protecting working conditions for its male members.&quot; Labour&#x27;s prestige had never been higher, and it systematically placed its leaders into Parliament.

The Munitions of War Act 1915 followed the Shell Crisis of 1915 when supplies of material to the front became a political issue. The Act forbade strikes and lockouts and replaced them with compulsory arbitration. It set up a system of controlling war industries, and established munitions tribunals that were special courts to enforce good working practices. It suspended, for the duration, restrictive practices by trade unions. It tried to control labour mobility between jobs. The courts ruled the definition of munitions was broad enough to include textile workers and dock workers. The 1915 act was repealed in 1919, but similar legislation took effect during the Second World War.

It was only as late as December 1917 that a War Cabinet Committee on Manpower was established, and the British government refrained from introducing compulsory labour direction (though 388 men were moved as part of the voluntary National Service Scheme). Belgian refugees became workers, though they were often seen as &quot;job stealers&quot;. Likewise, the use of Irish workers, because they were exempt from conscription, was another source of resentment. Worried about the impact of the dilution of labour caused by bringing external groups into the main labour pool, workers in some areas turned to strike action. 
The efficiency of major industries improved markedly during the war. For example, the Singer Clydebank sewing machine factory received over 5000 government contracts, and made 303 million artillery shells, shell components, fuzes, and airplane parts, as well as grenades, rifle parts, and 361,000 horseshoes. Its labour force of 14,000 was about 70 percent female at war&#x27;s end.

===Energy===
Energy was a critical factor for the British war effort. Most of the energy supplies came from coal mines in Britain, where the issue was labour supply. Critical however was the flow of oil for ships, lorries and industrial use. There were no oil wells in Britain so everything was imported. The U.S. pumped two-thirds of the world&#x27;s oil. In 1917, total British consumption was 827 million barrels, of which 85 percent was supplied by the United States, and 6 percent by Mexico. The great issue in 1917 was how many tankers would survive the German U-boats. Convoys and the construction of new tankers solved the German threat, while tight government controls guaranteed that all essential needs were covered. An Inter-Allied Petroleum Conference allocated American supplies to Britain, France and Italy.

Fuel oil for the Royal Navy was the highest priority. In 1917, the Royal Navy consumed 12,500 tons a month, but had a supply of 30,000 tons a month from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, using their oil wells in Persia.

==Social change==
Variously throughout the war, serious shortage of able-bodied men (&quot;manpower&quot;) occurred in the country, and women were required to take on many of the traditional male roles, particularly in the area of arms manufacture; though this was only significant in the later years of the war, since unemployed men were often prioritised by employers. Women both found work in the munitions factories (as &quot;munitionettes&quot;) despite initial trade union opposition, which directly helped the war effort, but also in the Civil Service, where they took men&#x27;s jobs, releasing them for the front. The number of women employed by the service increased from 33,000 in 1911 to over 102,000 by 1921. The overall increase in female employment is estimated at , from 5.9 to , and female trade union membership increased from 357,000 in 1914 to over a million by 1918—an increase of 160 percent. Beckett suggests that most of these were working-class women going into work at a younger age than they would otherwise have done, or married women returning to work. This taken together with the fact that only 23 percent of women in the munitions industry were actually doing men&#x27;s jobs, would limit substantially the overall impact of the war on the long-term prospects of the working woman.

When the government targeted women early in the war focused on extending their existing roles – helping with Belgian refugees, for example—but also on improving recruitment rates amongst men. They did this both through the so-called &quot;Order of the White Feather&quot; and through the promise of home comforts for the men while they were at the front. In , groups were set up and a campaign started to get women to help in agriculture and in , the Women&#x27;s Land Army was set up. One goal was to attract middle-class women who would act as models for patriotic engagement in nontraditional duties. However the uniform of the Women&#x27;s Land Army included male overalls and trousers, which sparked debate on the propriety of such cross-dressing. The government responded with rhetoric that explicitly feminized the new roles. In 1918, the Board of Trade estimated that there were 148,000 women in agricultural employment, though a figure of nearly 260,000 has also been suggested.

The war also caused a split in the British suffragette movement, with the mainstream, represented by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union, calling a &#x27;ceasefire&#x27; in their campaign for the duration of the war. In contrast, more radical suffragettes, like the Women&#x27;s Suffrage Federation run by Emmeline&#x27;s other daughter, Sylvia, continued their (at times violent) struggle. Women were also allowed to join the armed forces in a non-combatant role and by the end of the War 80,000 women had joined the armed forces in auxiliary roles such as nursing and cooking.

Following the war, millions of returning soldiers were still not entitled to vote. This posed another dilemma for politicians since they could be seen to be withholding the vote from the very men who had just fought to preserve the British democratic political system. The Representation of the People Act 1918 attempted to solve the problem, enfranchising all adult males as long as they were over 21 years old and were resident householders. It also gave the vote to women over 30 who met minimum property qualifications. The enfranchisement of this latter group was accepted as recognition of the contribution made by women defence workers, though the actual feelings of members of parliament (MPs) at the time is questioned. In the same year the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918 allowed women over 21 to stand as MPs.

The new coalition government of 1918 charged itself with the task of creating a &quot;land fit for heroes&quot;, from a speech given in Wolverhampton by David Lloyd George on 1918, where he stated &quot;What is our task? To make Britain a fit country for heroes to live in.&quot; More generally, the war has been credited, both during and after the conflict, with removing some of the social barriers that had pervaded Victorian and Edwardian Britain.

==Regional conditions==

Stephen Badsey argues that in 1914, Great Britain (excluding Ireland) was the most homogeneous and settled society of any of the major powers. He states that the population was almost entirely literate and first language English Speakers. Christianity was almost universal and religious discrimination limited. The distinctive cultural identity of Scotland and Wales accepted but often passed over in the language of the time. He also argues that:

The War had a profound influence upon rural areas, as the U-boat blockade required the government to take full control of the food chain, as well as agricultural labour. Cereal production was a high priority, and the Corn Production Act 1917 guaranteed prices, regulated wage rates, and required farmers to meet efficiency standards. The government campaigned heavily for turning marginal land into cropland. The Women&#x27;s Land Army brought in 23,000 young women from the towns and cities to milk cows, pick fruit and otherwise replace the men who joined the services. More extensive use of tractors and machinery also replaced farm labourers. However, there was a shortage of both men and horses on the land by late 1915. County War Agricultural Executive Committees reported that the continued removal of men was undercutting food production because of the farmers&#x27; belief that operating a farm required a set number of men and horses.

Kenneth Morgan argues that, &quot;the overwhelming mass of the Welsh people cast aside their political and industrial divisions and threw themselves into the war with gusto.&quot; Intellectuals and ministers actively promoted the war spirit. Initially, early recruitment rates were somewhat lower than in urban areas of England with smaller populations. Later, with 280,000 men enrolled in the services (14% of the population), the proportionate effort in Wales outstripped both England and Scotland. Adrian Gregory points out that the Welsh coal miners, while officially supporting the war effort, refused the government request to cut short their holiday time. After some debate, the miners agreed to extend the working day.

Scotland&#x27;s distinctive characteristics have attracted significant attention from scholars. Daniel Coetzee shows it supported the war effort with widespread enthusiasm. It especially provided manpower, ships, machinery, food (particularly fish) and money, engaging with the conflict with some enthusiasm. With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent 690,000 men to the war, of whom 74,000 died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded. Scottish urban centres, with their poverty and unemployment were favourite recruiting grounds of the regular British army, and Dundee, where the female dominated jute industry limited male employment had one of the highest proportion of reservists and serving soldiers than almost any other British city. Concern for their families&#x27; standard of living made men hesitate to enlist; voluntary enlistment rates went up after the government guaranteed a weekly stipend for life to the survivors of men who were killed or disabled. After the introduction of conscription from January 1916 every part of the country was affected. Occasionally Scottish troops made up large proportions of the active combatants, and suffered corresponding loses, as at the Battle of Loos, where there were three full Scots divisions and other Scottish units. Thus, although Scots were only 10 per cent of the British population, they made up 15 per cent of the national armed forces and eventually accounted for 20 per cent of the dead. Some areas, like the thinly populated Island of Lewis and Harris suffered some of the highest proportional losses of any part of Britain. Clydeside shipyards and the nearby engineering shops were the major centers of war industry in Scotland. In Glasgow, radical agitation led to industrial and political unrest that continued after the war ended.

==Casualties==

In the post war publication &quot;Statistics of the Military Effort of the British Empire During the Great War 1914–1920&quot; (The War Office, ), the official report lists 908,371 &#x27;soldiers&#x27; as being either killed in action, dying of wounds, dying as prisoners of war or missing in action in the World War. (This is broken down into Britain and its colonies 704,121; British India 64,449; Canada 56,639; Australia 59,330; New Zealand 16,711; South Africa 7,121.) Listed separately were the Royal Navy (including the Royal Naval Air Service until 31 March 1918) war dead and missing of 32,287 and the Merchant Navy war dead of 14,661. The figures for the Royal Flying Corps and the nascent Royal Air Force were not given in the War Office report.

A second publication, &quot;Casualties and Medical Statistics&quot; (1931), the final volume of the &quot;Official Medical History of the War&quot;, gives British Empire Army losses by cause of death. The total losses in combat from 1914 to 1918 were 876,084, which included 418,361 killed, 167,172 died of wounds, 113,173 died of disease or injury, 161,046 missing presumed dead and 16,332 died as a prisoner of war.

The Commonwealth War Graves Commission lists 888,246 imperial war dead (excluding the dominions, which are listed separately). This figure includes identified burials and those commemorated by name on memorials; there are an additional 187,644 unidentified burials from the Empire as a whole.

The civilian death rate exceeded the prewar level by 292,000, which included 109,000 deaths due to food shortages and 183,577 from Spanish flu. The 1922 War Office report detailed the deaths of 1,260 civilians and 310 military personnel due to air and sea bombardment the home islands. Losses at sea were 908 civilians and 63 fisherman killed by U-boat attacks.

With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent 690,000 men to the war, of whom 74,000 died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded. At times Scottish troops made up large proportions of the active combatants, and suffered corresponding losses, as at the Battle of Loos, where there were three full Scots divisions and other Scottish units. Thus, although Scots were only 10 per cent of the British population, they made up 15 per cent of the national armed forces and eventually accounted for 20 per cent of the dead. Some areas, like the thinly populated Island of Lewis and Harris suffered some of the highest proportional losses of any part of Britain. Clydeside shipyards and the engineering shops of west-central Scotland became the most significant centre of shipbuilding and arms production in the Empire. In the Lowlands, particularly Glasgow, poor working and living conditions led to industrial and political unrest.

==Legacy and memory==
=== Immediate aftermath ===

Images of trench warfare became iconic symbols of human suffering and endurance. The post-war world had many veterans who were maimed or damaged by shell shock. In 1921 1,187,450 men were in receipt of pensions for war disabilities, with a fifth of these having suffered serious loss of limbs or eyesight, paralysis or lunacy.

The war was a major economic catastrophe as Britain went from being the world&#x27;s largest overseas investor to being its biggest debtor, with interest payments consuming around 40 percent of the national budget. Inflation more than doubled between 1914 and its peak in 1920, while the value of the Pound Sterling fell by 61.2 percent. Reparations in the form of free German coal depressed the local industry, precipitating the 1926 General Strike. During the war British private investments abroad were sold, raising . However, new investment also took place during the war. The net financial loss was therefore approximately ; less than two years investment compared to the pre-war average rate and more than replaced by 1928. Material loss was &quot;slight&quot;: the most significant being 40 percent of the British merchant fleet sunk by German U-boats. Most of this was replaced in 1918 and all immediately after the war. The military historian Correlli Barnett has argued that &quot;in objective truth the Great War in no way inflicted crippling economic damage on Britain&quot; but that the war only &quot;crippled the British &quot;psychologically&quot;&quot; (emphasis in original).

Less concrete changes include the growing assertiveness of the Dominions within the British Empire. Battles such as Gallipoli for Australia and New Zealand, and Vimy Ridge for Canada led to increased national pride and a greater reluctance to remain subordinate to London. These battles were often portrayed favourably in these nations&#x27; propaganda as symbolic of their power during the war. The war released pent-up indigenous nationalism, as populations tried to take advantage of the precedent set by the introduction of self-determination in eastern Europe. Britain was to face unrest in Ireland (1919–21), India (1919), Egypt (1919–23), Palestine (1920–21) and Iraq (1920) at a time when they were supposed to be demilitarising. Nevertheless, Britain&#x27;s only territorial loss came in Ireland, where the delay in finding a resolution to the home rule issue, along with the 1916 Easter Rising and a failed attempt to introduce conscription in Ireland, increased support for separatist radicals, and led indirectly to the outbreak of the Irish War of Independence in 1919.

Further change came in 1919. With the Treaty of Versailles, London took charge of an additional and new subjects. The colonies of Germany and the Ottoman Empire were redistributed to the Allies (including Australia, New Zealand and South Africa) as League of Nations mandates, with Britain gaining control of Palestine and Transjordan, Iraq, parts of Cameroon and Togo, and Tanganyika. Ironically, the British Empire reached its territorial peak a far weaker Empire than before the war started.

=== Longterm memory ===

The horrors of the Western Front as well as Gallipoli and Mesopotamia were seared into the collective consciousness of the twentieth century. To a large extent the understanding of the war in popular culture focused on the first day of the Battle of the Somme. Historian A. J. P. Taylor argued, &quot;The Somme set the picture by which future generations saw the First World War: brave helpless soldiers; blundering obstinate generals; nothing achieved.&quot; A similar view of the cultural legacy of the war has been argued by historian Adrian Gregory;
:&quot;The verdict of popular culture is more or less unanimous. The First World War was stupid, tragic and futile. The stupidity of the war has been a theme of growing strength since the 1920s. From Robert Graves, through &#x27;Oh! What a Lovely War&#x27; to &#x27;Blackadder Goes Forth,&#x27; the criminal idiocy of the British High Command has become an article of faith.&quot;
However, many historians don&#x27;t believe this view of the conflict is correct. Arguing instead that the Central Powers were the primary aggressors and that Germany was a threat to Britain and Europe.

Polling conducted by YouGov in 2014 suggested that 58% of modern British adults believed the Central powers were primarily responsible for the outbreak of the First World War, 3% the Triple Entente (the major countries in each group were listed), 17% both sides and 3% said they didn&#x27;t know. 52% believed generals had failed British soldiers, 17% believed they had done as well as they could whilst 30% said they didn&#x27;t know or believed neither statement. 40% believed the conflict was a Just War from a British perspective whilst 27% believed there was no difference between the participants. 34% believed Britain&#x27;s participation in the First World War was something to be proud of whilst 15% believed it was something to regret. A report produced on commemorations of the conflict by British Future which had conducted research into public attitudes to the subject in 2013 argued that public knowledge of the First World War was quite limited;

<text>SPIN is a general tool for verifying the correctness of concurrent software models in a rigorous and mostly automated fashion. It was written by Gerard J. Holzmann and others in the original Unix group of the Computing Sciences Research Center at Bell Labs, beginning in 1980. The software has been available freely since 1991, and continues to evolve to keep pace with new developments in the field.

==Tool==
Systems to be verified are described in Promela (Process Meta Language), which supports modeling of distributed algorithms as non-deterministic automata (&quot;SPIN&quot; stands for &quot;Simple Promela Interpreter&quot;). Properties to be verified are expressed as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas, which are negated and then converted into Büchi automata as part of the model-checking algorithm. In addition to model-checking, SPIN can also operate as a simulator, following one possible execution path through the system and presenting the resulting execution trace to the user.

Unlike many model-checkers, SPIN does not actually perform model-checking itself, but instead generates C sources for a problem-specific model checker. This technique saves memory and improves performance, while also allowing the direct insertion of chunks of C code into the model. SPIN also offers a large number of options to further speed up the model-checking process and save memory, such as:
*partial order reduction;
*state compression;
*bitstate hashing (instead of storing whole states, only their hash code is remembered in a bitfield; this saves a lot of memory but voids completeness);
*weak fairness enforcement.

Since 1995, (approximately) annual SPIN workshops have been held for SPIN users, researchers, and those generally interested in model checking.

In 2001, the Association for Computing Machinery awarded SPIN its System Software Award.

<doc id="1211535" wikidata="Q713421" url="?curid=1211535" title="Khun Sa">
<text>Khun Sa (, ; 17 February 1934 – 26 October 2007) was an ethnic Han drug lord and warlord. He was born in Hpa Hpeung village, in the Loi Maw ward of Mongyai, Northern Shan State, Burma. Before he assumed the Shan name &quot;Khun Sa&quot; in 1976, he was known primarily by his Chinese name, Zhang Qifu ().

In his early life, Khun Sa received military equipment and training from both the Kuomintang and Burmese Army before claiming to fight for the independence of Shan State and going on to establish his own independent territory. He was dubbed the &quot;Opium King&quot; in Myanmar due to his massive opium smuggling operations in the Golden Triangle, where he was the dominant opium warlord from approximately 1976 to 1996. Although the American ambassador to Thailand called him &quot;the worst enemy the world has&quot;, he successfully co-opted the support of both the Thai and Burmese governments at various times. After the American Drug Enforcement Administration uncovered and broke the link between Khun Sa and his foreign brokers, he &quot;surrendered&quot; to the Burmese government in 1996, disbanding his army and moving to Yangon with his wealth and mistresses. After his retirement some of his forces refused to surrender and continued fighting the government, but he engaged in &quot;legitimate&quot; business projects, especially mining and construction. He died in 2007 at the age of 73. Today, his children are prominent businesspeople in Myanmar.

==Biography==
===Early life===
He was primarily known by his Han Chinese name, Chang Chi-fu (Zhang Qifu). When he was three years old, his father died. His mother married a local tax collector, but two years later she died as well. He was raised largely by his Han grandfather, who was the headman of the village in which he was born, Loi Maw. The Han side of his family had been living in Shan State since the 18th century.

He received no formal education but had military training as a soldier with Chinese Nationalist forces that had fled into Burma after the victory of Mao&#x27;s Communists in 1949.

Although his stepbrothers were sent to missionary schools, the only formal education that Khun Sa received was as a boy, when he spent a few years as a Buddhist novice, and for the rest of his life he remained functionally illiterate. In the early 1950s he received some basic military training from the Kuomintang, which had fled into the border regions of Burma from Yunnan upon its defeat in the Chinese Civil War in 1949. He formed his first independent band of young men when he was sixteen, and when his organization grew to several hundred men he became independent of the Kuomintang. After establishing his independence he frequently switched sides between the government and various rebel armies, as the situation suited him.

===Militia leader and opium trade===
In 1963 he re-formed his army into a local &quot;Ka Kwe Ye&quot; (&quot;Home guard&quot;) unit, under the control of the northeast command of the Burmese army, which was based in nearby Lashio. In return for fighting local Shan rebels, the government allowed him to use their land and roads to grow and trade opium and heroin. By allowing them to be financed by opium production, the Burmese government hoped that these local militia units could be self-supporting. Many government-supported warlords, including Khun Sa, used their profits from the opium trade to buy large supplies of military equipment from the black markets in Laos and Thailand, and were soon better equipped than the Burmese army.

By the late 1960s Khun Sa was one of the most important and powerful militia leaders in Shan state. He held an important pass in Loi Maw, restricting the movements of local communist rebels. During the period, while he was nominally supporting the Burmese government, he maintained contact with Kuomintang intelligence agents.

Through the 1960s Khun Sa became one of Burma&#x27;s most notorious drug traffickers. He challenged the local dominance of the Kuomintang remnants in Shan State, but in 1967 he was decisively defeated in a battle involving both the Kuomintang and the Laotian army on the Thai–Burma–Laos border. In that battle he led a convoy of 500 men and 300 mules into Laos, but the convoy was ambushed by Kuomintang forces en route. As the battle was going on, the Laotian army (which was also involved in the opium/heroin trade) bombed the battleground and stole the opium. This defeat demoralized him and his forces. The Laotian army continued to ambush his mule trains for the next few years, and his military strength declined.

===Capture===
In 1969, delegates from a local ethnic rebel group, the Shan State Army, began to hold secret talks with Khun Sa, attempting to persuade him to change sides and join them. He expressed interest, but details of the meeting were discovered by the Burmese army, and he was arrested On October 29, 1969, at Heho Airport in Taunggyi while returning from a business trip in Tachilek, near the Thai border. After his capture he was charged with high treason for his contacts with the rebels (but not for drug trafficking, which he had government permission to do), and he was imprisoned in Mandalay. While imprisoned Khun Sa read Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;the Art of War&quot; and &quot;Luo Guanzhong&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, after which he developed a political philosophy that he exercised later in life: “In politics there are no lifelong friends, and no lifelong foes... They change according to the gains and losses. A good leader must be able to take advantage of every change and utilize it.”

After Khun Sa&#x27;s arrest his militia unit dissolved, but his more loyal followers went underground, and in 1973 abducted two Soviet doctors from a hospital in Taunggyi, where they had been working. A division of soldiers from the Burmese army were tasked with rescuing the doctors, but failed. The doctors were ransomed for Khun Sa&#x27;s freedom, and he was subsequently released in 1974. Khun Sa&#x27;s release was secretly brokered by Thai General Kriangsak Chomanan. After his release Khun Sa maintained a good relationship with Chomanan, and in 1981 secretly contributed $50,000 US to support him in a Thai election campaign.

===In Thailand===

During the next two decades, from 1974 to 1994, Khun Sa became the dominant opium warlord in the Golden Triangle. The share of heroin sold in New York originating from the Golden Triangle rose from 5% to 80% during this period, and Khun Sa was responsible for 45% of that trade. The DEA assessed that Khun Sa&#x27;s heroin was 90% pure, &quot;the best in the business&quot;. During the height of his power, in the 1980s, Khun Sa controlled 70% of the opium production in Burma, and built a large-scale infrastructure of heroin refining factories to dominate the market for that drug. He may have once supplied a quarter of the world&#x27;s heroin supply. He commanded 20,000 men, and his personal army was better armed than the Burmese military. His notoriety led the American government to put a $2 million bounty on him. The American diplomat to Thailand referred to him as &quot;the worst enemy the world has&quot;.

After his release Khun Sa went underground, and in 1976 rejoined and reformed his forces in Ban Hin Taek, in northern Thailand, close to the border with Burma. Soon after he began to reform his forces he adopted the Shan name &quot;Khun Sa&quot; (literally &quot;Prince Prosperous&quot;) for the first time. He renamed his group the Shan United Army, began to claim that he was fighting for Shan autonomy against the Burmese government, and told international reporters that his people only grew drugs to pay for clothes and food. In 1977 he offered to take his territory&#x27;s entire opium crop off the black market by selling it to the American government, but his offer was rejected.

Although Khun Sa was not the mastermind of the local drug trade, he controlled areas where drugs were grown and refined. The owners of the local heroin refineries were from Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and paid Khun Sa in exchange for the protection of his army. American government workers, who visited Khun Sa&#x27;s compound in 1977 to negotiate with him, believed that the Thai government tolerated his presence on Thailand&#x27;s northwestern border in order for his army to serve as a buffer between them and more radical revolutionary groups active in Laos and Burma at the time.

===Return to Burma===
After combined forces of the Thai military and remaining Kuomintang in Thailand defeated entrenched Communist rebels in Northwest Thailand in 1981, American officials began to pressure the Thai government to expel Khun Sa. In July 1981, Thai authorities announced a 50,000 baht ($2,000 US) bounty on his head. In August this was raised to 500,000 baht, &quot;valid until 30 Sept. 1982&quot;. In October 1981 a 39-man unit of Thai Rangers and local rebel guerillas attempted to assassinate Khun Sa at the insistence of the US Drug Enforcement Administration. The attempt failed, and almost the entire unit was wiped out. In January 1982 a 1,000-man force of the Thai Army appeared at the borders of his base area. The Thai force consisted of Thai rangers from Pak Thong Chai, local paramilitary border police from Tak, and several airplanes and helicopter gunships. The battle lasted for four days, with heavy casualties on both sides. At the conclusion of the battle Khun Sa was forced to retreat back into Burma.

Within a year of losing his base in Thailand, Khun Sa rebuilt his army, defeated a local Burmese rebel group along the Burmese border between Shan State and Northwest Thailand, and took control of the region. He relocated his base of operations to the border town of Homein, established a local heroin-refining industry, and resumed a working relationship with the Burmese military and intelligence services, who again tolerated his presence in return for fighting other ethnic and communist rebels. He maintained a cordial relationship with the highest-ranking Burmese general in the region, Maung Aye, and established relationships with many foreign socialites and business people, including Lady and Lord Brockett, and James &quot;Bo&quot; Gritz. In 1984 his forces bombed the fortified residence of his rival, Li Wenhuan, in Chiang Mai. His organization maintained a trade organization in the government-held city of Taunggyi and re-established cordial relations with the Thai intelligence service after relocating to Burma.

===Head of Mong Tai Army===
In 1985, Khun Sa merged his Shan United Army with another rebel group, the &quot;Tai Revolutionary Council&quot; of Moh Heng, a faction of the Shan United Revolutionary Army (SURA), forming the Mong Tai Army (MTA). Through that alliance he gained control of a 150-mile Thai-Burma border area from his base at Ho Mong, a village near Mae Hong Son, to Mae Sai.

When the Americans donated several million dollars to the Burmese government for &quot;drug suppression&quot; in 1987, the Burmese military fabricated reports, leaked to the Thai press, that they had attacked and defeated Khun Sa in battles involving thousands of Burmese and Thai soldiers and several F-5E jets. However, these reports were completely false, and no action was taken against him. In reality, the Burmese and Thai governments were cooperating with him to build a highway into the region that he controlled. The Burmese army did conduct anti-narcotics operations at the time in many other areas of Burma, but the area controlled by Khun Sa was one of the few areas not targeted.

In 1988, Khun Sa was interviewed by Australian journalist Stephen Rice, who had crossed the border from Thailand into Burma illegally. Khun Sa offered to sell his entire heroin crop to the Australian Government for A$50m a year (paid in either cash or agricultural aid) for the next eight years, a move that would have immediately destroyed half the world&#x27;s heroin supply. The Australian Government rejected the offer, with Senator Gareth Evans declaring: &quot;The Australian Government is simply not in the business of paying criminals to refrain from criminal activity.&quot; In September 1989, when American photojournalist Karen Petersen interviewed the General for &quot;People&quot; magazine at his camp in Ner Mone, Shan State, he claimed he had a total army of 12,000 men. Soon thereafter, in January 1990 Khun Sa was indicted in absentia by an American federal grand jury on drug trafficking charges.

Following his indictment, he was interviewed by Canadian journalist Patricia Elliott at his base, accompanied by photojournalist Subin Kheunkaew, for the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot;. At the time he was acting as head of a coalition of Shan rebel forces, the Mong Tai Army (MTA), a force he then claimed consisted of 18,000 troops, a reserve of 5,000, and a local militia numbering 8,000. At this time he named his price for opium eradication as US$210 million in UN assistance, US$265 million in foreign investment and US$89.5 million in private aid for a program of crop substitution, education, and health care. The offer was rejected as blackmail by US authorities; and, rather than accepting his offer, the American government placed a $2 million bounty on him. He imposed a 40% tax on all opium growing, refining, and trafficking in return for protection from other warlords and the Myanmar government, but refused to discuss his total opium income with international reporters. To protect against air raids, he amassed a supply of locally made rockets and Surface-to-air-missiles purchased in Laos.

===Surrender and retirement===

In the 1990s Khun Sa&#x27;s influence and power in the region declined. Part of this was due to the opening of new trade routes for heroin that ran from Yunnan to ports in southeastern China, which reduced his importance as a middleman for the drug along the Thai border. Other drug trafficking routes opened up to India, Laos, and Cambodia, which Khun Sa did not control. In the early 1990s his organization began to be challenged militarily by another nominally independent ethnic rebel organization in northern Myanmar, the United Wa State Army. This conflict put pressure on his leadership.

Khun Sa&#x27;s surrender to the Burmese government coincided with, and may have been motivated by, a loss of support from other Shan leaders. After his front man within the Mong Tai Army, his longtime subordinate, Chairman Moh Heng, died of cancer in 1991, his control over the organization began to weaken. After Moh Heng&#x27;s death he called a Shan &quot;parliament&quot;, attracting hundreds of representatives from across the region. At this meeting he declared the creation of an independent Shan State, with himself as president. Many of his rivals from within the Mong Tai Army refused to accept his leadership, claiming that he was using the independence movement primarily as a front for his drug running operations, and formed a rival Shan organization, the &quot;Shan State National Army&quot;.

Khun Sa exported his heroin through a network of underworld contacts and brokers based in Thailand, Yunnan, Macao, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Once he sold his products to these dealers, he had no control of where they were transported. Some of his business associates believed that he was only a front man for underworld Chinese drug interests, and many were terrified of him. By 1995 the DEA managed to discover and break the link between Khun Sa and his foreign brokers. Khun Sa&#x27;s income then began to decline, and he began to consider retirement.

In public the Burmese military claimed that they wanted to hang Khun Sa. They conducted small raids against him, and they carried out public bonfires of &quot;heroin&quot; (largely stones and grass). Despite the Burmese leadership&#x27;s public attitude towards Khun Sa, they understood that he had long controlled Burma&#x27;s most lucrative export crop (estimated at $600 million US per year in 1997), and by the 1990s he had co-opted many of the most high-ranking military leaders in the country. By 1996 they made a secret agreement for Khun Sa to surrender to the Burmese government, under the understanding that he would receive government protection and that he would not be extradited.

Khun Sa surrendered to the Burmese government on January 5, 1996, gave up control of his army, and moved to Rangoon with a large fortune and four young Shan mistresses. Following Khun Sa&#x27;s surrender, opium production in the Golden Triangle declined (this shift coincided with a dramatic rise in opium production in Afghanistan). During his retirement he became a prominent local businessman, with investments in Yangon, Mandalay and Taunggyi. After his retirement he described himself as &quot;a commercial real estate agent with a foot in the construction industry&quot;. He ran a large ruby mine, and invested in a new highway running from Yangon to Mandalay. While living in Yangoon, Khun Sa maintained a low profile. His movements and communications with the outside world were restricted by the Burmese government, and his activities were monitored by Burmese intelligence.

Following Khun Sa&#x27;s retirement and the voluntary disbandment of his private army, many of his followers joined local militias controlled by the Burmese army. Others, who had believed that he was a Shan patriot, were devastated and refused to accept the ceasefire. They went underground and continued to fight the Burmese army under the name of the &quot;Shan State Army - South&quot;. The Burmese army somewhat disrupted the local opium trade, and the largest opium producer in the Golden Triangle became the United Wa State Army.

== Death ==
Khun Sa died on 26 October 2007 in Yangon at the age of 73. The cause of death was not known, though he had suffered from diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. He was cremated four days after his death. His remains were cremated and buried at Yayway Cemetery, North Okkalapa Township, Yangon, Myanmar. Before his death he had decided not to be buried in Shan state, due to fears that his tomb would be vandalized or destroyed.

Soon after he died, in November 2007, a memorial was held for Khun Sa in his former stronghold in Thailand, Thoed Thai, close to the Myanmar border. Asked why they honoured Khun Sa, the local people said that he helped the town to develop: he built the first paved roads in the area, the first school, and a well-equipped, 60-bed hospital staffed by Chinese doctors. He was building a hydro power plant, but after his departure construction on that project was halted. He also built an 18-hole golf course for foreign visitors and a functional water and electrical infrastructure. The local Thai authorities ensured that the ceremony remained relatively simple.

==Family==
Khun Sa was married to Nan Kyayon (died 1993) with whom he had eight children: five sons and three daughters. His children, listed in order of their birth, are Nang Long, Zarm Merng, Zarm Herng, Nang Kang, Zarm Zeun, Zarm Myat, Nang Lek, and Zarm Mya.

All of Khun Sa&#x27;s children were educated abroad. As a reward for his retirement and relocation to Yangon, his children were allowed to run and operate business interests in Myanmar. At the time of his death, in 2007, his favorite son was running a hotel and casino in the border town of Tachilek, while one of his daughters was a well-established businesswoman in Mandalay.

In 1989 Khun Sa told Karen Petersen, a reporter for &quot;People&quot; magazine, that he also had a second wife in Bangkok. When he moved to Yangon he brought four young mistresses with him. All four were teenagers from Kengtung, in eastern Shan State.

==In popular culture==
Khun Sa is mentioned in Japanese manga and anime &quot;Black Lagoon&quot;, for his role on the drug trade in Southeast Asia as well as one of his subordinates being targeted by the NSA.

Khun Sa was featured in a 1990 edition of The Cook Report entitled &quot;Heroin Highway&quot;.

Khun Sa is portrayed by Ric Young in the 2007 film &quot;American Gangster&quot;.

Khun Sa is mentioned in Hong Kong movie &quot;To Be Number One&quot; in which real life triad boss Ng Sik-ho connects to him circa 1973 in order to supply Hong Kong domestic supply and export. The film includes footage of Khun Sa.

Khun Sa is mentioned in Jo Nesbø&#x27;s &quot;Cockroaches,&quot; the second novel in the &quot;Harry Hole&quot; series.

<text>Aide-toi, le ciel t&#x27;aidera (French idiom, meaning &quot;God helps those who help themselves&quot;; literally, &quot;Help yourself, heaven shall help you&quot;), simply called Aide-toi, was a French society that aimed to stir up the electorate against the government during the Bourbon Restoration (1814–1830).

==History==

The term &quot;Aide-toi, le ciel t&#x27;aidera&quot; began to be used by some political writers around 1824, and became the motto and title of the Aide-toi society.
The purpose was to create opposition to the government by strictly legitimate means, mainly letters and political journals.
The founders and active members were mostly from the Doctrinaires party, including François Guizot, who was president for some time, Tanneguy Duchâtel, Prosper Duvergier de Hauranne, Paul-François Dubois, Charles de Rémusat, Adolphe Thiers and Éléonore-Louis Godefroi Cavaignac.

The association&#x27;s organ was first &quot;Le Globe&quot; and then &quot;Le National&quot;.
Charles Renouard was among the liberals who opposed the Bourbon Restoration.
He was a member of the &quot;Aide-toi&quot; society and participated in the creation of the &quot;Globe&quot;.
He was the lawyer for this journal, and contributed to it regularly from 1825 to 1827.

Although intimate with Lafayette and others, the lawyer Odilon Barrot (1797–1877) took no share in their schemes for the overthrow of the government, but in 1827 joined the Aide-toi association.
Aide-toi supported liberal candidates in the 1827 elections.
The society was very influential in causing the July Revolution in 1830.
It gave a banquet presided over by Barrot for the 221 deputies who had signed the address of March 1830 to Charles X, and threatened to reply to force by force.
The society was allowed at first by the new government, but was dissolved in 1832.

<text>Leven (Pictish; ) is a seaside town in Fife, set in the east Central Lowlands of Scotland. It lies on the coast of the Firth of Forth at the mouth of the River Leven, north-east of the town of Kirkcaldy and east of Glenrothes.

According to the 2022 Scottish Census, Leven has a population of 10,087. The town forms part of the Levenmouth conurbation, which has a total population of 37,651.

== History ==

The origin of the name &quot;Leven&quot; comes from the Pictish word for &quot;flood&quot;. The nearby Loch Leven, being the flood lake, was the name given to both the river and town. A settlement is believed to have formed at the mouth of the River Leven very close to the area around Scoonie Brae with the discovery of the parish church of &quot;scoyne&quot;. During the mid-11th century, Bishop Tuadal of St Andrews gifted the church of &quot;scoyne&quot; to the Culdees of Loch Leven. By the end of the 11th century, the village along with the church were acquired by Bishop Robert of St Andrews following the decline of culdeen faith.

The first mention of the current town was made in the middle of the 15th century, according to two separate records referring to the town&#x27;s name as &quot;levynnis-mouth&quot;. This contained information about the urgent need for repair work at the town&#x27;s monastery and Georgie Durie, a local estate owner, becoming the keeper at the harbour.

In 1854 the Leven Railway opened, linking the town with Thornton Junction on the Edinburgh - Aberdeen main line. This helped it to become a tourist resort popular with visitors from the west of Scotland, and particularly Glasgow. Later in the 19th century the Leven Railway became part of a loop line of the North British Railway linking Thornton Junction and Leuchars Junction via St Andrews. The railway between Leven and St. Andrews closed in 1965. The railway between Leven and Thornton Junction closed to freight in 1966 and passengers in 1969. In 2019 a scheme was approved to re-open the town&#x27;s railway station. Until then, the nearest station was Markinch railway station. This re-opening occurred on 2 June 2024.

The ecclesiastical and civil parish of Scoonie included the town of Leven.

== Leisure and tourism ==
Tourism is a major economic activity in and around Leven. There are several large caravan parks in and around the town, in addition to a number of hotels and guest houses. The neighbouring villages of Lundin Links and Lower Largo have over 50 high quality self-catering properties available for visitors.

The coast and the long sandy beaches are the main visitor draw. Leven has an attractive beach promenade with playparks and other facilities including an indoor Kids Action Zone. The promenade is part of the Fife Coastal Path that stretches for over from the Firth of Forth to the Firth of Tay. There are also popular family facilities and walks in the large parks at Letham Glen and Silverburn. The former includes a crafts centre and woodland walks, while the latter has attractive gardens and coastal views.

Golf is also a major draw with two courses at Scoonie and Leven Links and another within easy walking distance at Lundin Links. Leven Links has been used as a qualifying course for the Open Championship when it is held at St Andrews, the &quot;home of golf&quot; only to the north. There are also numerous bowls clubs in and around the town.

A heritage railway has also been established near the Burnmill industrial estate, alongside the now disused Leven-Thornton branch line. With trains running along the yard for half a mile, between April and October with a Santa special in mid-December. The Fife Heritage Railway is the first of its kind in Fife since the closure of Lochty Private Railway in 1992. The railway completed its first steam engine in August 2016.

Levenmouth Leisure Centre, at the start of the promenade, is an all-weather attraction with a large, modern indoor swimming pool and sports facilities. History enthusiasts can find out about the area&#x27;s past at the Heritage Centre in neighbouring Methil, only a 15-minute walk from Leven town centre.

The town centre is the main shopping centre for a wide area with a number of national chain supermarkets and retailers as well as award-winning independent local retailers. It also has a large number of restaurants and cafes.

== Economic activity ==
Levenmouth suffers from poor connections to the rail and main road network of Central Scotland, particularly since the closure of the last railway link in 1969, which came at the same time as the collapse of coal mining. The knock-on effect virtually sealed the fate of Methil as a major port on the East of Scotland. On 15 June 2021 the transport minister Graeme Dey announced that rail services would be reintroduced to Leven and Levenmouth with an electrified dual-track railway. Services were reintroduced on 2nd of June 2024 after £116m of Scottish Government investment linking Leven to the main line at Thornton. 

However, there are good bus links to the main railhead at Kirkcaldy () and regular express bus services to the pretty resort villages of the neighbouring East Neuk and St Andrews. A new bus station has recently been built in the centre of the town at the foot of the High Street opposite the Leisure Centre.

The main road through Fife, the A92, bypasses this area of Fife, the 4th largest conurbation, whereas Dunfermline, Kirkcaldy and Glenrothes all have good road and rail connections. Leven is linked to Kirkcaldy by the A915 Standing Stane Road and Methil to Kirkcaldy through Dysart and East/West Wemyss. It also has a fast road link to Glenrothes on the A915 that continues on to St Andrews.

Very little remains in the way of major employment since the closure of the coal mining industry. The major employers now are the drinks manufacturer Diageo, which has its main bottling plant in the town, and one of the largest distilleries in the world at Cameron Bridge, near Windygates; and supermarket companies Sainsbury&#x27;s, Lidl and Aldi, which trade from large stores located throughout the town.

== Education ==

Currently, the town is home to three primary schools. Two of which are non-denominational - Mountfleurie and Parkhill and the other being denominational - St Agatha&#x27;s.

Parkhill Primary School which serves the centre of the town opened in 1910, initially as an infant school before accepting primary school pupils in 1957. Mountfleurie Primary School, on the other hand, opened in 1957 with an infant department in 1974. The school also has a speech and language class which officially started in 1990. St Agatha&#x27;s RC Primary School which dates from 1975, following a re-location from Methil, Fife has a catchment area stretching from East Wemyss to Lower Largo.

For Secondary schooling, most children within Leven will go to Levenmouth Academy. Previously, students would attend either Kirkland or Buckhaven high schools but these schools were merged to form Levenmouth Academy.

<text>Alfred Sandor (November 5, 1918 – September 22, 1983), born Alfred Sandwina, and billed early in his career as Al Sandwina, was a Hungarian-born American and Australian character actor and singer. He was also credited as Al Sander and Al Sandor.

==Early life and career==
Sandor was born in Budapest during the turmoil of the Hungarian Revolutions and Interventions, He spent his early years travelling with the circus, where his mother, Katie Sandwina, was a circus strongwoman, and he had a background as a ringmaster. After a brief career working as a boxer in New York City, he was a spy behind enemy lines during World War II.

==Acting career==
After World War II he returned to America, where he established himself as an actor, appearing in Broadway productions and musical theatre. On US television he appeared on &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;, in a single episode of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; in 1968 (playing Sheriff George Patterson) and on &quot;Our Five Daughters&quot;. His theatre work included Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, and &quot;Gypsy&quot; opposite Ethel Merman. His film work included &quot;The Return of Captain Invincible&quot;.

Sandor later travelled to Australia (where he took up citizenship), to appear in a touring production of &quot;Plaza Suite&quot;, the play &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot; (with Lorraine Bayly and Mona Richardson), and he appeared in the film &quot;Nickel Queen&quot;, whilst doing television work with roles in &quot;Number 96&quot;, &quot;Division 4&quot;, &quot;Boney&quot; and &quot;The Evil Touch&quot;. However, he would become best known for his long-running role as the &quot;dandy&quot; surgeon Dr. Raymond Shaw in the Australian television soap opera &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;. An original cast member of the serial, he continued in the role for six years, leaving around 20 episodes before the programme&#x27;s conclusion due to ill health.

==Death==
After suffering from ill health for some time, he died of lung cancer in Sydney, Australia in 1983, aged 64.

<doc id="1211540" wikidata="Q266049" url="?curid=1211540" title="Nicole-Reine Lepaute">
<text>Nicole-Reine Lepaute (; , 5 January 1723 – 6 December 1788), also erroneously known as Hortense Lepaute, was a French astronomer and human computer. Lepaute along with Alexis Clairaut and Jérôme Lalande calculated the date of the return of Halley&#x27;s Comet. Her other astronomical feats include calculating the 1764 solar eclipse and producing almanacs from 1759 to 1783. She was also a member of the Scientific .

The asteroid 7720 Lepaute is named in her honour, as is the lunar crater Lepaute.

==Early life==
Nicole-Reine Lepaute was born on 5 January 1723 in the Luxembourg Palace in Paris as the daughter of Jean Étable, valet in the service of Louise Élisabeth d&#x27;Orléans. Her father had worked for the royal family for a long time, both in the service of the duchess de Berry and her sister Louise. Louise Elizabeth of Orleans was a widow of Louis of Spain. When her husband died, she returned to Paris and was given part of Luxembourg to live in and to house her staff members. She was the sixth of nine children. As a child she was described as precocious and intelligent, being mostly self-taught. She stayed up all night &quot;devouring&quot; books and read every book in the library, with Jérôme Lalande saying of her that even as a child &quot;she had too much spirit not to be curious&quot;. Lepaute’s interest in astronomy had begun at a young age when she most likely witnessed a comet in the sky. She became eager to learn about it and started her curiosity journey when she started studying about comets. This led to one of the biggest discoveries of her time.
In August 1748, she married Jean-André Lepaute, a royal clockmaker in the Luxembourg Palace.

== Career ==
=== Mathematics of clockmaking ===

Her marriage gave her the freedom to exercise her scientific skill. At the same time as she kept the household&#x27;s accounts, she studied astronomy, mathematics, and &quot;she observed, she calculated, and she described the inventions of her husband&quot;.
She met Jérôme Lalande, with whom she would work for thirty years, in 1753 when he was called as a representative of the Académie des Sciences to inspect her husband&#x27;s work on a pendulum of a new type. The three of them worked together on a book titled &quot;Traité d&#x27;horlogerie&quot; (&quot;Treatise of Clockmaking&quot;) that was published in 1755 under her husband&#x27;s name. Although she did not receive authorship, Lalande sang her praises later, saying, &quot;Madame Lepaute computed for this book a table of numbers of oscillations for pendulums of different lengths, or the lengths for each given number of vibrations, from that of 18 lignes, that does 18000 vibrations per hour, up to that of 3000 leagues&quot;.

Lalande was a leader at heart and helped lead Nicole-Reine Lepaute and her husband through the hard work calculating and creating different astronomical designs for predicting Halley&#x27;s comet and creating new inventions of the clock. For instance, her husband had made a horizontal clock for the palace of Luxembourg and was granted permission to live there for the remainder of their life before he left for Russia. Lalande also sent in another clock that was made by Lepaute and went as the representative of the Academy of Science to observe this clock. Lalande was a French astronomer who was known for his support of women in science, particularly his collaboration with Nicole-Reine Lepaute. He believed that women were capable of pursuing ambitious scientific work and that their intellectual pursuits were not a threat to the social order. However, despite his support for women in science, Lalande&#x27;s views were still limited by the social and cultural norms of his time. He believed that women were best suited to assisting male researchers rather than leading their own research projects. He also emphasized the importance of women&#x27;s roles as wives and mothers, and saw their scientific work as being compatible with their familial duties. In some ways, Lalande&#x27;s views can be seen as both progressive and limiting. On the one hand, he recognized the intellectual capabilities of women and encouraged them to pursue scientific work. On the other hand, his views still placed women in a secondary role to men and reinforced traditional gender roles. Despite these limitations, Lalande&#x27;s support for women in science was significant and helped to pave the way for future generations of women scientists.

=== Halley&#x27;s Comet ===
In June 1757, she worked together with Jérôme Lalande and Alexis Clairaut to calculate the date of the next passage of Halley&#x27;s comet, last seen in 1682. Halley couldn&#x27;t precisely compute the return date beyond &quot;around the end of the year 1758 or the beginning of the next&quot;, due to the gravitational pull of Jupiter and Saturn on the comet, which made for a three-body problem that couldn&#x27;t be solved back then, for which Clairaut had found a solution recently.

In order to solve it, Clairaut, Lalande and Lepaute divided calculations between them and worked in parallel, with Lepaute and Lalande focusing on the attraction of Jupiter and Saturn, while Clairaut calculated the orbit of the comet itself. The team worked for more than six months straight, barely stopping for food, in order to produce a date before the comet arrived. In November 1758, they gave a two-month window for when the comet would reach its perihelion, between 15 March and 15 May, centered around 13 April 1759. The comet ended up arriving on 13 March 1759.

Although this was a tenfold improvement over Halley&#x27;s initial 2 years period, there was still an error of a few days, which caused the astronomer Jean d&#x27;Alembert to ridicule their work and call it &quot;more laborious than deep&quot;.

Lepaute&#x27;s involvement largely went unrecognised, and, while Lalande acknowledged her work in his &quot;Théorie des Comètes&quot; (&quot;Comet Theory&quot;), insisting that they could never have done the calculations without her, Clairault removed mentions of her from the book he published in 1760, &quot;Théorie du mouvement des comètes&quot;, allegedly to please another woman.
=== Later mathematical accomplishments ===
In 1759, Lalande became the Director of the &quot;Connaissance des Temps&quot; (&quot;Knowledge of the times&quot;), an astronomical almanac published by the Académie des Sciences, and he appointed Lepaute as his assistant. She did calculations from the computing plans Lalande prepared until 1774 and made various contributions to the almanac, including calculations on a 1762 comet, as well as a table of parallactic angles.


Afterwards, she worked on Éphémerides, annual guides for astronomers and navigators. She calculated the position of Saturn for each day of the year from 1775 to 1784 for the seventh volume, published in 1774, and she calculated on her own the daily positions of the Sun, the Moon and the planets for the eighth volume (1785-1792, published 1784).

She also computed in 1762 the exact time of an annular solar eclipse that occurred on 1 April 1764 and published two maps under her own name that showed the eclipse&#x27;s extent: one over Europe, which showed the eclipse&#x27;s transit in 15-minutes intervals, and one that detailed its successive phases over Paris.

The solar eclipse that occurred on 1 April 1764 was a significant event that garnered a great deal of public interest across Europe. At the time, solar eclipses were still not fully understood and were viewed as mysterious and sometimes ominous events. The eclipse of 1764 was particularly noteworthy because it was visible across a large portion of Europe, including in Paris where it was near total. Many people gathered to observe the eclipse, and it was widely reported in newspapers and other publications of the time.In addition to the public interest in the eclipse, it also had scientific significance. Astronomers saw it as an opportunity to test the accuracy of their calculations of the motion of the Moon, which is an important factor in predicting solar and lunar eclipses. Nicole-Reine Lepaute and her husband, Jean-André Lepaute, were among the astronomers who worked to calculate the precise timing of the eclipse and to observe its effects.

Her work went largely unappreciated and unrewarded despite its importance. While Lalande would eventually become a professor of astronomy and the director of the Paris Observatory, she kept working for him for fifteen years as a human computer. She nonetheless became a member of the distinguished Scientific Academy of Béziers in 1761, for which she calculated the ephemeris of the transit of Venus this year. Lalande always recognised her work, and, after her death, he wrote a brief biography about her contributions to astronomy in his &quot;Astronomical Bibliography&quot;.

Doing so many calculations over the course of thirty years affected her sight to the point she had to stop working in 1783.

== Personal life ==
While childless herself, she adopted her husband&#x27;s nephew, Joseph Lepaute Dagelet in 1768 and trained him in astronomy and advanced mathematics, which Lalande includes in her contributions to astronomy. He travelled south to the Terra Australis in 1773, became a professor of mathematics at Paris&#x27; Military School and became inducted in the French Royal Academy of Sciences in 1785. He most likely died in a shipwreck during a scientific expedition led by Jean-François de Lapérouse in 1788.

Nicole Lepaute spent the last seven years of her life taking care of her terminally ill husband until she died in Paris, in the parish of Saint-Roch, on 6 December 1788.

==Legacy==
Philibert Commerson attempted to name the Hydrangea flower &quot;Lepautia&quot; or &quot;Peautia&quot; after Lepaute. However, the flower&#x27;s accepted name later became &quot;Hortensia&quot;. This led to people believing Lepaute&#x27;s name was Hortense, but the Larousse remarks that this is erroneous, and that the name probably came from &quot;hortus&quot;, garden.

<text>The Defense Courier Service (DCS) is a global courier network for the expeditious, cost-effective, and secure distribution of highly classified and sensitive material, established under the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM). Operational control of global courier activities is exercised through USTRANSCOM&#x27;s Defense Courier Division (TCJ3-C). The division oversees and synchronizes activity of 18 courier stations worldwide to service over six thousand accounts. Major accounts include the White House, the Department of Defense, the State Department, other federal agencies, authorized government contractors, and allied nations.

The DCS directly supports the President, Unified and Specified COCOMs, joint military operations, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Security Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, U.S. allies, State Department, and other federal agencies.

The DCS was formerly the Armed Forces Courier Service (ARFCOS) but was reorganized and renamed in 1985 after the Walker spy case.

== History ==
Before the establishment of the courier service, American ship captains and selected American travellers were used to carry sealed packages of mail. Later these individuals, called &quot;Bearers of Dispatches,&quot; were augmented by a small group of Foreign Service Officers.

With few modifications, this method of moving classified mail abroad continued until 1918 when the War Department established the Military Postal Express Service, consisting of 70 officers and enlisted soldiers, divided into an Overseas Service and a European Service. This continued until the early days of World War II when the War Department activated the Army Courier Service to move classified material between the War Department and various theatres of operation. Meanwhile, the Navy created the Officer Messenger Service and the Army Air Corps operated an Air Courier Service to move cryptographic materials. Frequently, couriers from all three services flew together on the routes.

In November 1946, the War Department discontinued the Army Courier Service and established a &quot;Security Courier Service,&quot; which operated until 1949. At this time, certain courier stations were transferred to the newly created U.S. Air Force Security Courier Service. Then in 1952, the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed a review of courier operations which resulted in the establishment of an organization consisting of Army, Navy, and Air Force courier elements. The Armed Forces Courier Service (ARFCOS) was officially established on January 7, 1953. The military courier services were now consolidated. The ARFCOS charter was updated seven times over the next 30 years to reflect changes in the armed forces, military doctrine, and operational procedures.

In the aftermath of the Walker-Whitworth espionage case (1985), the Secretary of Defense established a Security Commission—often referred to as the Stillwell Commission—to review DoD security policies and practices. As part of its findings, the commission recommended a review and restructuring of ARFCOS and the DoD courier function. This resulted in publication of DoD Directive 5200.33, the revised charter for a new joint-service military command. Thus, the Defense Courier Service (DCS) was officially established on September 30, 1987.

A revised concept for execution of the courier function emerged with the creation of the DCS. Key to this are the following major affiliations:

*Under the DoD, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)). 
*Executive Agency responsibility for the DCS was transferred to the Air Force and, later, delegated to the Air Mobility Command (AMC). 
*On December 5, 1994, the DCS became a Direct Reporting unit to the U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM). Later, on October 1, 1998, DCS was relieved from its assignment to the USTRANSCOM and assigned once again to AMC. 
*More recently, on October 1, 2004, DCS was once again, reorganized under USTRANSCOM.

The Gulf War provided the first real-world contingency deployment test of the DCS. Eight days after Iraqi tanks entered Kuwait, a seven-man DCS station was deployed to HQ, Central Command in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. By the end of the Gulf War, DCS couriers had provided over one million pounds of command, control, and intelligence material.

Since 2004, Defense Courier Service increasingly has been integrated into USTRANSCOM. This process began when Program Budget Decision (PBD) 410, dated December 5, 2003, directed the realignment of Defense Courier Service (DCS) from Air Mobility Command (AMC) to U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM). On October 1, 2004, DCS was aligned as a Functional Component Command (FCC) under the USTRANSCOM Director of Operations (TCJ3). On May 16, 2005, the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence (USD(I)) approved a proposal to eliminate the DCS command billet and integrate the functions of the DCS headquarters staff into USTRANSCOM. On November 15, 2005, the Defense Courier Division (TCJ3-C) assumed operational control of worldwide defense courier stations and continues to synchronize the defense courier related activities of the USTRANSCOM staff.

<doc id="1211545" wikidata="Q167482" url="?curid=1211545" title="N1 (South Africa)">
<text>The N1 is a national route in South Africa that runs from Cape Town through Bloemfontein, Johannesburg, Pretoria and Polokwane to Beit Bridge on the border with Zimbabwe. It forms the first section of the famed Cape to Cairo Road.

Prior to 1970, the N1 designation was applied to the route from Beit Bridge to Colesberg and then along the current N9 to George. The section from Cape Town to Colesberg was designated the N9.

==Route==

=== Western Cape ===


==== Within Cape Town ====
The N1 begins in central Cape Town at the northern end of Buitengracht Street (M62), outside the entrance to the Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront. The first section of the N1 is shared with the beginning of the N2; it is a four-lane elevated freeway that runs along a strip of land between the city centre and the Port of Cape Town. On the eastern edge of the city centre the two roads split, and the N1 turns east as Table Bay Boulevard, passing the Ysterplaat Air Force Base and Century City before the N7 intersects it on its own way out of the city towards Namibia. 

Major improvements have been made to the Koeberg Interchange, where the N1 meets the M5, one of the main arterial routes linking Milnerton with the Southern Suburbs. The N1 then heads through the suburbs of Goodwood and Bellville, where the R300 terminates at it, before heading towards Paarl.

Within the City of Cape Town the volume of two-way traffic ranges between 95,000 and 120,000 vehicles a day. During week days during peak traffic times (inbound towards the Cape Town city bowl in the morning and outbound in the afternoon) traffic jams extending up to 12 kilometers in length are common.

==== Rest of the province ====
At Paarl, the freeway ends, and the N1 is tolled as it passes through the Huguenot Tunnel running underneath the Du Toitskloof Mountains; the tunnel was opened in the late 1980s to replace the old Du Toitskloof Pass (now designated as part of the R101) running over the mountain. Traffic volumes through the tunnel range from an average of 12,000 vehicles daily with up to 22,500 vehicles using it daily in peak periods on holidays.

After emerging from the tunnel, the N1 winds through the Molenaar River Valley (which is a short dual carriageway section) before emerging from the valley and heading towards Worcester, bypassing Rawsonville. From Worcester, the route heads through the Hex River Valley, passing De Doorns and then enters the Karoo by ascending the Hex River Pass en route to Touws River.

Currently only the section of the N1 passing through the Huguenot Tunnel is tolled, although there were formerly plans to toll the N1 from the junction with the R300, roughly to De Doorns. This would have allowed for upgrading of the N1, most especially the opening and construction of the Northern Bore of the Huguenot Tunnel so that two lanes of traffic could pass in each direction through the tunnel, and the building of grade separated junctions along the N1 through Worcester. Although the town centre is bypassed, there are a number of traffic lights on the N1 through Worcester.

From the top of the pass, the N1 passes Touws River and Matjiesfontein before passing through Laingsburg, then heads towards Beaufort West, passing the towns of Prince Albert Road and Leeu-Gamka. The 200 km section between Laingsburg and Beaufort West is notorious for claiming many lives in fatigue-related accidents; also, the N1 begins to turn towards the north-east along this stretch of road. Just before Beaufort West, the N12 from George meets the N1; the N12 and the N1 routes are co-signed through Beaufort West and for the next 75 km north-east before splitting at Three Sisters. The N12 later meets the N1 again in Johannesburg, making the N12 an alternative route to the N1, passing through Kimberley as opposed to Bloemfontein. The N1 from Bloemfontein onwards is tolled while the N12 is toll-free. Whereas the N12 passes through most of the towns en route to Johannesburg, the N1 bypasses every town between Beaufort West and Johannesburg (avoiding town centres).

The N1 briefly crosses into the Northern Cape at Three Sisters for a few kilometres before crossing back into the Western Cape, and remains in the Western Cape until just after its intersection with the R63, where it re-enters the Northern Cape.

=== Northern Cape ===
The N1 has a short section in the Northern Cape. After re-entering the Northern Cape, it passes north-east past the town of Richmond before intersecting with the N10 at Hanover. The N1 then continues towards Colesberg, where it meets the northern terminus of the N9 just south-west of the town. Approximately 35km after Colesberg, the N1 crosses the Orange River and enters the Free State.

=== Free State ===
After the Orange River crossing, the N1 makes a direct line for Bloemfontein, passing the towns of Springfontein, Trompsburg and Edenburg, heading in a more northerly direction. Upon entering Bloemfontein, the N1 meets the northern terminus of the N6 from East London. This intersection marks the beginning of the Bloemfontein Western Bypass, which is the first freeway section on the route since Paarl. The N8 from Kimberley in the west intersects with the N1 bypass, joining it for 3 km, before heading east through the Bloemfontein CBD and then to Maseru in Lesotho.

The N1 is designated as a toll road from the N6 interchange until its end at Beit Bridge. A few kilometres north of Bloemfontein, the N1 meets the R30 to Brandfort; the N1 continues as a single carriageway but with two lanes in each direction until 5 km before the toll plaza at Verkeerdevlei, halfway between Bloemfontein and Winburg. Initial plans were for the N1 from Bloemfontein to Winburg to be a dual-carriageway freeway. At Winburg, the N1 bypasses the town to the west as a dual carriageway and meets the western terminus of the N5, which bypasses the north of Lesotho before its own termination at the N3 in Harrismith. Just after Winburg, the N1 becomes a single carriageway again.

Many motorists from Cape Town heading for Durban travel the N1 to Winburg, and then N5 to Harrismith as an alternative to reach Durban via the N3. This is due to the shorter distance between the two cities (1635 km for the N1, N5 &amp; N3 route and 1710 km for the current N2 route), as well as the much better quality of this route compared with the N2, especially between Port Shepstone and Grahamstown (although that stretch of road has been improved in the past few years). However, after the new N2 Wild Coast Toll Route has been completed, the N2 will be the shorter road between Durban and Cape Town (1621 km).

The N1 continues north and bypasses Ventersburg, where it becomes a dual carriageway again, before reaching Kroonstad. There, the R34 from Welkom joins the N1 freeway for 9 kilometres, bypassing Kroonstad Central to the east, before splitting from the N1 and making its own way towards Heilbron.

After the dual carriageway freeway bypass of Kroonstad, the N1 returns to single carriageway status and heads towards the Vaal River and Gauteng as the Kroonvaal Toll Route. Just before passing into Gauteng at the Vaal River, the N1 becomes a dual-carriageway freeway and features another toll plaza (the Vaal Toll Plaza) just south of its interchange with the R59 road, which provides access to the Vaal Triangle (Vereeniging and Sasolburg) in the east and Parys in the west.

=== Gauteng ===
After crossing the Vaal River, the N1 continues towards Johannesburg, bypassing Vanderbijlpark and featuring another toll plaza at Grasmere. At the Misgund Interchange in the southern outskirts of Johannesburg, the N12 once again meets the N1, and they are co-signed northwards as one highway for 4 kilometers (bypassing Soweto) up to the Diepkloof Interchange, where the N12 splits off eastwards to become the Southern Bypass portion of the Johannesburg Ring Road. From just north of the Vaal River the N1 changes from being a tarred road to a concrete road, until just after meeting the N12.

The N1 then becomes the Western Bypass portion of the same ring road, passing through Johannesburg&#x27;s western and north-western suburbs (forming Roodepoort&#x27;s eastern boundary and passing through Randburg) before meeting the northern termini of the N3 (the Eastern Bypass portion of the Johannesburg Ring Road, which connects to Durban) and Johannesburg&#x27;s own M1 freeway at the Buccleuch Interchange north-east of Sandton.

The N1 then becomes the Ben Schoeman Highway, heading northwards towards Pretoria (passing through Midrand); this section carries 300,000 vehicles per day and is purported to be the busiest stretch of road in South Africa. At the Brakfontein Interchange in Centurion, the N1 meets the N14 and they switch highways, with the N14 becoming the Ben Schoeman Highway northwards to Pretoria Central and the N1 becoming the Pretoria Eastern Bypass (named the Danie Joubert Freeway) towards the north-east, proceeding to intersect with the R21 highway coming from O. R. Tambo International Airport at the Flying Saucer Interchange before Pretoria East. After the R21 interchange, the N1 proceeds in a more northerly direction through the eastern suburbs. East of Pretoria CBD, at the Proefplaas Interchange, the N4 national route from Witbank in the east joins the N1 and they are one highway for 12 km northwards before the N4 splits off to the west to become the Platinum Highway (Pretoria Northern Bypass) towards Brits and Rustenburg. At this interchange with the Platinum Highway (N4) is the Pumulani Toll Plaza on the N1 north and the Doornpoort Toll Plaza on the N4 west.

From the interchange with the N4 Platinum Highway, the N1 is tolled for the remainder of its length, with various toll plazas located along it (including upon off-ramps). The N1 heads to the north, bypassing Hammanskraal, and crosses into the Limpopo province.

=== Limpopo ===
The N1 then passes near Bela-Bela (previously Warmbaths) and Modimolle (previously Nylstroom). At the Modimolle exit, the freeway ends; the section of freeway between the Vaal River and Modimolle is the longest freeway in South Africa by route number at approximately 265 km (although there are two changes in the alignment of freeway in Gauteng, at the Buccleuch and Brakfontein Interchanges; South Africa&#x27;s longest continuous freeway is the N3 between Durban and Ladysmith, which is approximately 20 km shorter). The section from the Proefplaas Interchange in Pretoria to the R516 Bela Bela exit is maintained by a private concessionaire, namely Bakwena, under license from SANRAL.

The N1 then heads past Mokopane (previously Potgietersrus), where the N11 intersects it at the Nyl Toll Plaza (north off-ramp only) (leaving the N18 and the N17 as the only national roads that do not intersect with the N1), before heading to Polokwane (previously known as Pietersburg). The Polokwane Eastern Bypass is now used by traffic to loop around the Polokwane Town Centre (the N1 is no-longer the road passing through the town centre).

After Polokwane, the N1 heads north, crossing the Tropic of Capricorn before passing Louis Trichardt. The N1 then winds through the Soutpansberg Mountains (containing two short tunnels) as the Wyllie&#x27;s Poort Pass before heading to Musina (passing the last tollgate before Musina). The Musina Western Bypass is now used by traffic to bypass the CBD to the west (The N1 is no-longer the road passing through the town centre). The route then continues for 12 km to end at the Beitbridge border crossing with Zimbabwe on the Limpopo River, where it crosses the river as the Alfred Beit Road Bridge before splitting into two routes, which are the A4 road to Harare and the A6 road to Bulawayo. The border on the other side of the Limpopo River is also called Beitbridge.

==Junctions==

==Trans-African Highway Network==

The section of the N1 from Cape Town to the split with the N12 national route at Three Sisters, Northern Cape is declared part of the Trans-African Highway Network no. 4 or Cairo-Cape Town Highway, which is the route designated by the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa between Cairo and Cape Town. (The route continues as the N12 northwards from Three Sisters)

==Old Route==
In numerous places in South Africa, specifically near major cities, the N1 route has been rebuilt to freeway standards. The original routes usually carry the designation of R101 and are often alternative routes to the newer, sometimes tolled, highways. Two examples are the R101 over Du Toitskloof Pass, where the new N1 highway bypasses the pass altogether by use of the Huguenot Tunnel, and the R101 through Polokwane Central, where the new N1 highway bypasses the town centre by use of the Polokwane Eastern Bypass.

There are exceptions to the usual R101 alternative route designation:

* The old N1 route from Colesberg to Bloemfontein is designated R717 up until Reddersburg, where it&#x27;s designated N6 to Bloemfontein.
* The old N1 route through Bloemfontein is designated as the M30.
* Between Bloemfontein and Winburg, the old route is designated firstly as the R30 between Bloemfontein and Brandfort and then is not designated to Winburg.
* Between Kroonstad and Parys, the old route is designated firstly as the R721 from Kroonstad to Vredefort and then as the R59 through Parys to the interchange with the N1 at the Vaal Toll Plaza, approximately 10 km south of the Vaal River.
* Between the Vaal River and Johannesburg, several alternative routes exist, the official alternative route being via the Golden Highway (R553). The old N1 route however followed the designation of the R42 through Vanderbijlpark to Vereeniging, and then the R82 leading to Johannesburg&#x27;s M1 freeway. The M1 as well as Old Pretoria Road and Louis Botha Avenue (together designated as the M11 road) provide the alternative route through Johannesburg; near the Buccleuch Interchange (the point where the N1, M1 and N3 converge), the M11 becomes the R101, providing the alternative route through to Polokwane via Midrand, Centurion, Pretoria, Bela-Bela, Modimolle &amp; Mokopane.

==Tolls==

The list below only includes mainline toll plazas; ramp toll plazas have not been included.

=== e-tolls in Gauteng ===

The section of the N1 from the R553 Golden Highway off-ramp in-between the Misgund and Diepkloof interchanges in Soweto to the Proefplaas Interchange with the N4 in Pretoria East was effectively declared an e-toll highway (with open road tolling) from 3 December 2013 onwards.

The South African government announced on 28 March 2024 that e-tolls in Gauteng would officially be shut down on 11 April 2024 at midnight. As a result of the e-toll discontinuation, this section of the N1 (which includes the Johannesburg Western Bypass, part of the Ben Schoeman Freeway and part of the Pretoria Eastern Bypass) became toll-free.

<text>Edward Bocking (died 1534) was a Benedictine monk executed in 1534. He was the confessor and spiritual adviser of Elizabeth Barton, &quot;The Holy Maid of Kent&quot;, a popular seer who spoke out against the marriage of King Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn. The extent to which he may have influenced Barton&#x27;s prophecies and pronouncements is unclear.

==Life==
Edward Bocking attended Canterbury College, Oxford where he received a B.D. in 1513 and a D.D. in 1518. He served as the Warden there for a period of time.

Bocking became a monk in 1526. He was serving as the cellarer of Christ Church Priory, in Canterbury, when at the request of Archbishop William Warham, the prior sent him with others to access the credibility of Elizabeth Barton, &quot;The Holy Maid of Kent&quot;, and her alleged divine revelations. Initially, she urged people to pray to the Blessed Virgin Mary and to undertake pilgrimages. After one of her usual trances she declared that the Blessed Virgin had directed her to enter some convent, and Archbishop William Warham arranged for her to enter the Benedictine convent of St. Selpulchre&#x27;s near Canterbury. Bocking became her confessor. According to George C Alston, writing in the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, Bocking is said to have induced her to declare herself an inspired emissary for the overthrow of Protestantism and the prevention of the divorce of Queen Catherine.

When the King began the process of obtaining an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon and seizing control of the Church in England from Rome, Barton began to prophesy against the royal policies. Bocking caused a collection of her oracles compiled under his direction to be widely circulated in manuscript.

After the divorce of Queen Catherine and Henry&#x27;s marriage to Anne Boleyn in 1533, Cromwell had Elizabeth Barton arrested. Bocking was arrested in August 1533. In November, 1533 Bocking, Barton and others were made to mount a scaffold at St Paul&#x27;s Cross to do public penance for promoting &quot;superstition&quot; and &quot;disloyalty&quot;. They were then led through the streets to the Tower of London.

Eustace Chapuys, Imperial ambassador for Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, nephew of Queen Catherine of Aragon, noted that there was some difficulty in obtaining a conviction for treason, and the trial ended without a sentence. In January 1534, indictments were drawn for a second trial, but Thomas Cromwell decided instead to seek a bill of attainder. According to Francis Aidan Gasquet, since the names of those attainted was not immediately released, those who early had supported Barton, did not offer any objection, and some offered Cromwell money in exchange for pardons.

Bocking and the others were not given an opportunity to address the charges; Parliament based its ruling on documentation supplied by the King&#x27;s council. Bocking, together with Barton and six others, was hanged and beheaded for treason at Tyburn on 20 April 1534. His body was buried in the London cemetery of the Dominican Friars but his head was mounted above one of the city gates.

Alston indicates that Barton&#x27;s purported visions of declaiming against the King&#x27;s marriage to Anne Boleyn were instigated and promoted by Bocking for his own purposes. Sidney Lee characterizes Barton&#x27;s pronouncements as the result of an &quot;hysterical disorder&quot; and the undue influence of Bocking, who took advantage of it. Gasquet allows that she may herself have believed them, and that at a time when there was widespread opposition to the marriage, it was necessary for the Crown to discredit a visionary who had attracted a following. Alston says that Barton had retracted her statements, but Gasquet says that is based on information under the control of the government.

<text>Margaret Susan Cheshire, Baroness Ryder of Warsaw, Baroness Cheshire, (; 3 July 1924 – 2 November 2000), commonly known as Sue Ryder, was a British volunteer with Special Operations Executive in the Second World War, and a member of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, who afterwards established charitable organisations, notably the Sue Ryder Foundation (now known as simply Sue Ryder).

==Early life==
Margaret Susan Ryder was born in 1924 in Leeds, the daughter of Charles Foster Ryder and Mabel Elizabeth Sims. The family lived at Scarcroft Grange near Leeds; the house now has a blue plaque, installed by Leeds Civic Trust in 2011. She was educated at Benenden School.

==Year of birth==
According to her autobiography, &quot;Child of My Love&quot;, Ryder was born on 3 July 1923. This was repeated by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in her obituary in November 2000, adding that &quot;Lady Ryder of Warsaw, better known as Sue Ryder, has died aged 77&quot;, as well as by the BBC and many other news sources.

Her birth and death certificates both put the date one year later, on 3 July 1924, as does a plaque unveiled in honour of Sue Ryder and Leonard Cheshire in St Mary the Virgin&#x27;s Church, Cavendish in Suffolk. Ryder joined the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry as a volunteer in January 1942. Her personal file is held at FANY HQ in London and mentions both 1923 and 1924 as her birth year.

==Second World War service, FANY and SOE==
In January 1942 she joined the ‘Free FANY’, the section of the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry which had not been absorbed into the Auxiliary Territorial Service (FANY-ATS) in 1939. Free FANY Special Units were voluntary and independent and as such were used by, amongst others, the Special Operations Executive (SOE). Ryder was assigned to the Polish section of the SOE and in 1943 she was posted with the Polish Unit to Tunisia, Algeria and later to Italy. The Poles had been trained by SOE as parachutists to infiltrate Poland. In 1945 she returned to the UK and was attached to the Polish Forces in Scotland. She was discharged in November 1945.

==Post-war activities==
After the war, Ryder volunteered to do relief work in Europe, initially with the Amis Volontaires Français, the Red Cross and the Guide International Service. Her association with SOE made initial service in Poland difficult but she persevered, much affected by her time spent with various Polish forces. Official relief organisations had withdrawn by 1952, and Ryder decided to stay on working alone, visiting prisons and hospitals. In the aftermath of war there were many non-Germans, young men in particular, who were unable to return to their own countries either due to lack of documentation or because their families were all dead. As a result, some of these young men turned to crime, usually so they could buy food or in some cases, to take revenge on their former captors. It was these people that Sue Ryder advocated for, calling them her &#x27;Bods&#x27;. She drove all over Germany to visit them in prisons, where she was often not welcomed by the authorities. At one time there were 1400 &#x27;Bods&#x27; in prisons, mainly Polish but also from Albania, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Ryder appealed on their behalf for their sentences to be reduced, or for their release, and for many she would be their only visitor. Some were executed and she would stay to pray with them. Among those who were released, she managed to repatriate some to Britain. Right up until two years before her death in 2000, there were still three prisoners she would visit every December, driving herself across Europe.

==Charitable work==
Because of her experiences in SOE and the brave people she met, Ryder was determined to establish a &#x27;living memorial&#x27; to the millions of people who had died in world war, and to all those who continued to suffer and die because of persecution. In 1953 she established her charity, initially the Forgotten Allies Trust, which later became the Sue Ryder Foundation. In 1996 her charity became Sue Ryder Care, changing its name to Sue Ryder in 2011.

Ryder established the first Home in Britain at her mother&#x27;s house in Cavendish, Suffolk in 1953, having already founded the St Christopher Settlement and St. Christopher Kries in Germany. These homes and projects were initially for survivors of Second World War concentration camps. The Cavendish home, also where Sue Ryder and her family lived, continued to provide care for sick and disabled people until 2001.

Until the 1970s, homes were established in Poland and the countries of the former Yugoslavia. The local authorities in each country built the foundations of the homes and installed utilities. Prefabricated buildings and equipment were sent out from the UK and erected by local builders together with UK tradesmen. Over twenty homes in each country were started in this way, and Ryder would make annual visits to look at sites for new homes and see what other help was needed.

Aware of the difficult conditions in which many of the survivors of the concentration camps continued to live in Poland, Ryder began a Holiday Scheme. Initially this started in Denmark, and Ryder would drive individuals there from Poland where they would stay with friends. The scheme transferred to the UK in 1958 and with the home in Cavendish already full, Ryder leased the south wing of nearby Melford Hall. For eleven years, many survivors of the concentration camps stayed for three or four weeks on holiday. Ryder continued to look for a more permanent property, and finally Stagenhoe Park in Hertfordshire became a Sue Ryder Home and continued the Holiday scheme. When the scheme came to an end, the home continued to provide care and is now a neurological care centre. Until the 1990s, Sue Ryder Homes opened in Britain and are run today by the charity Sue Ryder as hospices and neurological care centres, supported by a network of over 400 Sue Ryder shops. At one point, there was even a Sue Ryder shop on the Ascension Islands.

Sue Ryder&#x27;s international work expanded to include homes and projects, including mobile medical units, in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Israel, Italy, France, Albania, Greece, Ireland, Ethiopia and Malawi and work continues in many of these countries today. In 1958, the year before their marriage, Sue Ryder and Leonard Cheshire established a centre in India called Raphael, near Dehra Dun. The centre included homes for those with leprosy, people with learning disabilities, orphaned and destitute children, a school and a hospital with a tuberculosis wing. Fundraising for this project started in Australia and New Zealand, and both projects continue today. The work at Raphael became their joint charity Ryder-Cheshire, which continues in the UK as Enrych, supporting people with disabilities by providing access to leisure and learning opportunities through volunteers. In Australia, Ryder-Cheshire Australia continues to support Raphael in India, a home at Klibur Domin in Timor-Leste and two Australian Homes in Mt. Gambier and Melbourne. Raphael is a separate trust and is the State Nodal Agency Centre (SNAC) Uttarakhand for persons with autism, cerebral palsy, learning disabilities and multiple disabilities.

In 1995, the High Anglican Christian Community of St Katharine of Alexandria gave the house and grounds at Parmoor, now known as St Katharine’s, to Sue Ryder. She made the house into the headquarters of her independent charity, the Sue Ryder Prayer Fellowship, which she founded in 1984. The Fellowship was conceived by Lady Ryder to be a “powerhouse of prayer” for the needs of others, and especially for the work carried out across the world in the name of Sue Ryder. The house is a Christian house of prayer, and welcomes people from all denominations and none and all walks of life, in a spirit of ecumenism and reconciliation.

In 1998, Sue Ryder retired as a trustee and severed her links with Sue Ryder following a dispute with the other trustees, whom she accused of betraying her guiding principles.

In February 2000, Ryder set up the Lady Ryder of Warsaw Memorial Trust (previously called the Bouverie Foundation) to continue charitable work according to her ideals. The Trust is devoted to the relief of suffering and seeks to render personal service to those in need, regardless of age, race or creed, as part of the Human Family. As of 2021, it started working with Bristol and Newcastle Universities to help train more doctors.

==Awards and honours==
Sue Ryder was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1957.

Together with her husband Leonard Cheshire, she received a joint Variety Club Humanitarian Award in 1975, presented by HRH Princess Margaret.

Ryder was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1976.

==House of Lords==
Ryder was made a life peer on 31 January 1979, being created Baroness Ryder of Warsaw, of Warsaw in Poland and of Cavendish in the County of Suffolk. In the House of Lords, Ryder was involved in debates about defence, drug abuse, housing, medical services, unemployment, prison reform and race relations.

Ryder continued to speak for Poland and when the Communist rule there collapsed, she arranged lorries of medical and food aid. In 1989 Ryder made an appeal through &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to obtain more funding and collected £40,000 through the Lady Ryder of Warsaw Appeals Fund.

In a Lords debate for what became the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, Ryder moved an amendment on behalf of Lord Ashbourne (who was absent) proposing a &#x27;Restriction on custody of children by homosexuals&#x27;. Ashbourne&#x27;s amendment proposed to make it a criminal offence for &quot;any homosexual man or woman, other than the natural parent, to have the care or custody of a child under the age of eighteen.&quot; Ryder withdrew the amendment when it received limited support from peers, stating: &quot;My Lords, I am indeed grateful to noble Lords who took part in the debate on this amendment, which tries to safeguard children and is not intended as an attack on those with homosexual tendencies&quot;.

Her husband was made a life peer in 1991, as Baron Cheshire, as a result of which Ryder obtained the additional title Baroness Cheshire.

==Death==
Ryder died in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, on 2 November 2000, aged 76.

Podcast:

For what would have been her centenary year in 2024, the Lady Ryder of Warsaw Memorial Trust produced a podcast &#x27;Never Standing Still: Retelling the story of Sue Ryder&#x27; on Spotify.

==Museum==
Ryder set up the Sue Ryder Museum at Cavendish to tell the story of her work and promote the causes of those she helped. This museum was closed upon the sale of the Cavendish Sue Ryder home in 2001. The exhibits from the museum were handed to the Fundacja Sue Ryder (her Polish foundation) and in 2010, the city of Warsaw kindly lent to the Foundation one of two pavilions of the Mokotów Tollhouses at 2 Union of Lublin Square in Warsaw, to house the new museum. It was opened 19 October 2016.

The Sue Ryder home at Cavendish was purchased by another care provider and renamed Devonshire House. A remembrance room to Lady Ryder and the residents of the Cavendish home was set up in 2019 and opened by her children Jeromy and Elizabeth Cheshire on 18 February 2019.

<text>Gwendoline Jean Plumb AM BEM (2 August 1912 – 5 June 2002), was an Australian performer of international appeal, actress and comedian active in literally every form of the art genre, (except circus) including revue, pantomime, vaudeville, interviewing, game shows, live appearances, compering, radio production, scriptwriting and acting, television soap opera and mini-series and made-for-TV film.

She was considered the &quot;Grand Dame of Australian entertainment&quot;, with a career spanning 65 years, best known to local and international audiences in serial &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; as gossip Ada Simmonds, the ill-fated &quot;Richmond Hill&quot; as Mum Foote and the pilot of &quot;Home and Away&quot; as Doris Peters.

==Career==
===Early career in radio===
Gwen worked various jobs in her early career including as a typist, shop server and briefly in a chocolate factory, but having a flair for writing, starting to produce radio copy work for an advertising agency, after which she became interested in acting and started her performance career in 1930, with the Gwen Meredith Chelsea drama club, she had her first well-known role as Emmie in the longest-running Australian radio serial &quot;Blue Hills&quot;, She was very active in the radio industry early in her career and would work in this sector as a producer, scriptwriter and performer and hosted a long-running radio program on Australia&#x27;s Macquarie Radio Network from 1945 to 1974.

She also had a radio show in Sydney opposite Gordon Chater. She was well known for conducting celebrity interviews, for her own radio show including travelling to Europe to conduct recordings.

===Theatre===
Plumb had a long career in the theatre, starting from 1930 and was a cast member of the debut season of the Old Tote Theatre Company, and once quipped that she &quot;played in just about every form of public entertainment &quot;except the circus&quot;&quot;.

===Television===
Plumb appeared in some early Australian drama such as &quot;Adventure Unlimited&quot;.

She is probably best remembered for the Australian soap opera &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; as Ada Simmonds for its entire November 1976 – March 1983 run. She released a cook book, &quot;What&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Cooking with Ada,&quot; under her character’s name in 1980&quot;.&quot; Other notable roles were in the mini-series &quot;The Harp in the South&quot; and &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Orange&quot; in the mid-1980s. She acted in &quot;Neighbours&quot; as Mrs. Forbes in 1985, appearing in scenes opposite Alan Dale, with whom she had starred in &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;.

She later played the key role of in the serial &quot;Richmond Hill&quot; as Mum Foote in 1988. Having agreed to act in the planned new series, Plumb was offered, and played in the pilot of another proposed series &quot;Home and Away&quot; as Doris Peters. When &quot;Home and Away&quot; also went into production, Plumb opted to honour her earlier agreement to do &quot;Richmond Hill&quot;. The role of Mum Foote had been specially written with her in mind by show creator, Reg Watson. &quot;Richmond Hill&quot; had a run of just 12 months, and Plumb stayed with the series for all of that time. In 1995, Plumb returned to &quot;Home and Away&quot; for a number of episodes, playing a different character.

Plumb also appeared in the mini-series &quot;Stark&quot;, based on Ben Elton&#x27;s novel of the same name.

==Personal life==
Plumb&#x27;s lifelong partner was Australian radio, stage and screen actress Thelma Scott, best known for playing pompous socialite Clair Houghton in the TV series &quot;Number 96&quot;.

Plumb&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Plumb Crazy&quot; was published by Pan Macmillan in 1994.

In 1990, Plumb had a large growth removed from her colon and lower bowel. She began rehearsing for a production of &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; two months later, which left her exhausted. She felt that she had never fully recovered from the surgery. In April 1996, she fell and broke her pelvis.

Plumb died on 5 June 2002, aged 89, at her home in Kirribilli.

==British and Australian honours==
Plumb was awarded a British Empire Medal in 1973, and was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1993. Both awards recognised her community and charity work.
