<text>Shortwave listening, or SWLing, is the hobby of listening to shortwave radio broadcasts located on frequencies between 1700 kHz and 30 MHz Listeners range from casual users seeking international news and entertainment programming, to hobbyists immersed in the technical aspects of long-distance radio reception and sending and collecting official confirmations (QSL cards) that document their reception of remote broadcasts (DXing). In some developing countries, shortwave listening enables remote communities to obtain regional programming traditionally provided by local medium wave AM broadcasters. In 2002, the number of households that were capable of shortwave listening was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.

The practice of long-distance radio listening began in the 1920s when shortwave broadcasters were first established in the US and Europe. Audiences discovered that international programming was available on the shortwave bands of many consumer radio receivers, and a number of magazines and listener clubs catering to the practice arose as a result. Shortwave listening was especially popular during times of international conflict such as World War II, the Korean War and the Persian Gulf War, and the BBC resumed transmission during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Listeners use inexpensive portable world band receivers to access the shortwave bands, and some advanced hobbyists employ specialized shortwave communications receivers featuring digital technology as well as Digital signal processing designed for optimum reception of shortwave signals, along with outdoor antennas to enhance performance. Many hobbyists also choose to use Software-defined radio receivers for their benefits over traditional radios.

With the advent of the Internet, many international broadcasters have scaled back or terminated their shortwave transmissions in favor of web-based program distribution, while others are moving from traditional analog to digital broadcasting modes in order to allow more efficient delivery of shortwave programming. The number of organized shortwave listening clubs has diminished along with printed magazines devoted to the hobby; however, many enthusiasts continue to exchange information and news on the web.

==History==
The practice of listening to distant stations in the medium wave AM broadcast band was carried over to the shortwave bands. Frank Conrad, an early pioneer of medium wave broadcasting with KDKA in Pittsburgh, instituted some of the first shortwave broadcasts around 1921. Stations affiliated with General Electric and Crosley followed shortly after.

United States shortwave broadcasters began transmitting popular radio programs in an attempt to attract foreign audiences. During the 1930s, new shortwave receivers appeared on the market as well as popular shortwave magazines and clubs. Shortwave stations often offered unique QSL cards for DXers who send reception reports.

In Europe, shortwave broadcasts from Britain and the Netherlands such as Philips Radio&#x27;s PCJJ began around 1927. Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, Britain, and many other countries soon followed, and some classic shortwave broadcasters got their start. The BBC began on shortwave as the &quot;BBC Empire Service&quot; in 1932. Its broadcasts were aimed principally at English speakers. Radio Moscow was broadcasting on shortwave in English, French, German, Italian and Arabic by 1939. The Voice of America (or VOA) began broadcasting in 1942, after the U.S. entry into World War II using the Yankee Doodle musical theme.

While technically minded shortwave listening hobbyists dwindled during the war years due in part to the demands of military service, casual listeners seeking war news from foreign broadcasters increased. Shortwave receiver manufacturers contributed to war production. Zenith launched the multi-band Trans-Oceanic series of radios in 1942. In some other countries, during the war, listening to foreign stations was a criminal offense. Established in 1939, the Chinese 35 kilowatt shortwave station XGOY broadcast programming aimed at listening-restricted Japan. The station was often bombed by the Japanese.

In 1930, VE9GW in Bowmanville, Ontario (near Toronto) went on the air as an experimental station. While mostly simulcasting its medium wave sister station CKGW in Toronto, it also aired the &quot;International Short Wave Listening Club&quot;, aimed at DXers. Once the station boosted its signal to 500 Watts in 1932, it could be heard as far away as Europe, South Africa, and New Zealand on 6.095 MHz. It, and other Canadian shortwave stations, began broadcasting &quot;Northern Messenger&quot; in 1933, a mailbag show which allowed people to communicate personal messages to listeners in remote outposts in the Far North. This service became a vital means of communication between residents in remote, isolated communities and their friends and relatives in other northern communities and the south and would continue on CBC Radio (including its shortwave repeaters) into the 1970s.
CBS began a shortwave listening program in September 1939, on an experimental basis, at the National Lawn Tennis Championships at West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, New York. Engineers installed equipment at the CBS booth when the location was found to have good reception, and monitors relayed European shortwave news to CBS headquarters in New York between tennis matches. Throughout World War II, CBS captured Allied and enemy shortwave communications from more than 60 international stations via secretly located receivers. Translations of intercepted broadcasts were teletyped to all New York newspapers, Associated Press, United Press International, and International News Service, and in turn disseminated to newspapers and radio stations throughout the United States. Major headline news frequently resulted, since big stories often broke first on radio.

Shortwave listeners notified families of prisoners of war when studio announcers at stations in Axis powers countries, such as Germany and Japan, read prisoner-written messages. Allied monitors notified families, but many shortwave listeners were often first to report the broadcasts. Listeners in other countries also monitored POW messages. Americans were actively discouraged from listening to these reports, however, since broadcasting the names of a few American prisoners was regarded as a propaganda trick to build up the listening audience for Axis radio programs. In May 1943 the director of the CBS listening post, Jack Gerber, told journalist W.L. Shirer that the International Red Cross was the only reliable source of information on prisoners, and expressed concern at receiving six or seven letters a week requesting transcripts of German broadcasts in which service members may have been mentioned:

:The only reason the Nazis put on prisoner broadcasts is to get people, justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front, to listen to their propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield.
: What concerns some of us is the consequences of listening to Nazi broadcasts; unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.

New Zealand shortwave listeners reported POW voices broadcast over Radio Peking during the Korean War.
In the 1950s and 1960s, shortwave DX columns in US magazines such as &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;′ &quot;Tuning the short wave bands&quot; and &quot;Electronics Illustrated&quot;′s &quot;The Listener&quot; became news sources for serious radio listeners. &quot;Popular Electronics&quot;′ &quot;WPE Monitor Registration&quot; program, begun in 1959, even offered callsign-like identifiers to hobbyists. A number of specialty radio clubs such as the &quot;Newark News Radio Club&quot; also arose during these decades and provided hobbyists with an exchange of DX news and information. When &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; and similar magazines expanded coverage of new electronics topics in the 1970s, this led to the cancellation of several long-time shortwave listening columns.

Beginning with &quot;Sweden Calling DXers&quot; on Radio Sweden in 1948 (there was a slightly earlier short-lived program from Radio Australia), many shortwave radio stations began programs providing news. Some of the other prominent DX programs were Radio Netherlands&#x27; &quot;DX Jukebox&quot; (which became &quot;Media Network&quot;), the &quot;SWL Digest&quot; on Radio Canada International, and the &quot;Swiss Shortwave Merry-go-round&quot; on Swiss Radio International.

An example of notable shortwave programming was the &quot;Happy Station Show&quot;, popularly called the “world&#x27;s longest-running shortwave radio program”. The show originated on Philips Radio&#x27;s PCJJ shortwave station in 1928, continuing until 1940. After World War II Radio Netherlands broadcast the show from 1946 until it terminated in 1995. Producer and presenter Keith Perron of Taiwan-based PCJ Media revived Happy Station from 2009 until 2020. Although not associated with Radio Netherlands, the new effort proclaimed itself as “transmitted globally via shortwave, podcasting and Internet streaming radio”.

During the Persian Gulf War in the 1990s, many Americans tuned into foreign news broadcasts on shortwave. Some electronics retailers even reported a &quot;run&quot; on portable shortwave receivers due to the increased interest at the time.

==Practices==
Listening to shortwave broadcast stations for news and information programming is common, but for many shortwave listeners (abbreviated as &quot;SWLs&quot;), the goal is to receive as many stations from as many countries as possible, also known as DXing. &quot;DXers&quot; routinely test the limits of their antenna systems, radios and radio propagation knowledge. Specialized interests of shortwave listeners may include listening for shortwave utility, or &quot;ute&quot;, transmissions such as shipping, sailing, naval, aviation, or military signals, listening for intelligence signals (numbers stations), or tuning in amateur radio stations.
Listeners often obtain QSL cards (which confirm contact) from ham operators, broadcasters or utility stations as trophies of the hobby. Traditionally, listeners would send letters to the station with reception reports and requests for schedules. Many stations now accept E-mails or provide reception report forms on their Web sites. Reception reports give valuable information about propagation and interference to a station&#x27;s engineers.

There have been several publications dedicated to providing information to shortwave listeners, including the magazines &quot;Popular Communications&quot; (now a &quot;digital supplement&quot; to CQ Amateur Radio magazine), &quot;Monitoring Times&quot; (now defunct), and The Spectrum Monitor, a digital-only publication, in the United States, and the annual publications &quot;Passport to World Band Radio&quot; (now defunct) and the &quot;World Radio TV Handbook&quot; (WRTH). In addition, stations can provide broadcast schedules through the mail or E-mail. There are also shortwave radio programs dedicated to shortwave listening and DXing, such as the U.S.-based &quot;World of Radio&quot; and &quot;DXing With Cumbre&quot;, but recently these programs have been curtailed or dropped by many international broadcasters. As of 2007, Radio Habana Cuba still hosts a program called DXers Unlimited.

There are estimated to be millions of shortwave listeners. In 2002, according to the National Association Of Shortwave Broadcasters, for estimated numbers of households with at least one shortwave set in working order, Asia led with a large majority, followed by Europe, Sub Saharan Africa, and the former Soviet Union, respectively. The total estimated number of households worldwide with at least one shortwave set in working order was said to be 600 million. SWLs are varied, with no common age or occupation. David Letterman is an admitted fan of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).

Some developing countries use shortwave as a means of receiving local and regional programming. China and Russia retransmit some domestic channels on shortwave that target listeners in far off provinces. Shortwave listening is also used as an educational tool in classrooms. Poor sound reproduction, unreliable signal quality, and inflexibility of access are seen as disadvantages.
Some humanitarian organizations like &quot;Ears to Our World&quot; distribute portable, self-powered shortwave radios to less developed parts of the globe, enabling people in remote, impoverished parts of the world to get educational programming, local and international news, emergency information and music. Recently, the group was involved in sending radios to Haiti so victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake could stay abreast of local disaster recovery efforts.

==Equipment==

Radios for shortwave reception generally have higher performance than those intended for the local mediumwave, longwave or FM broadcast band, since dependable reception of shortwave signals requires a radio with increased sensitivity, selectivity, dynamic range and frequency stability. Modern shortwave radio receivers are relatively inexpensive and easily accessible, and many hobbyists use portable &quot;world band&quot; receivers and built-in telescopic antennas.

Serious hobbyists may use expensive (shortwave) communications receivers and outdoor antenna located away from electrical noise sources, such as a dipole made from wire and insulators.

==Future of shortwave listening==
The rise of the Internet has resulted in many broadcasters ceasing their shortwave transmissions in favor of broadcasting over the World Wide Web. When BBC World Service discontinued service to Europe, North America, Australasia, and the Caribbean, it generated many protests and activist groups such as the Coalition to Save the BBC World Service. A number of traditionally prominent shortwave broadcasters have disappeared or cut back their operations, with Radio Moscow, Radio Netherlands, Rai Italia Radio, and Radio Australia among those that have ceased broadcasting on shortwave. Although most of the major broadcasters continue to scale back their analog shortwave transmissions or completely terminate them, shortwave is still active in developing regions such as parts of Africa, South Asia and Latin America.

Some international broadcasters have turned to a digital mode of broadcasting called Digital Radio Mondiale for their shortwave outlets. One reason is that digital shortwave broadcasts using DRM can cover the same geographic region with much less transmitter power — roughly one-fifth — than traditional AM mode broadcasts, significantly reducing the electricity cost of operating a station. A traditional AM (analog) international shortwave station can have a power rating of 50 kilowatts to as much as 1000 kilowatts per transmitter, with typical power levels in the 50–500 kilowatt range. Endorsed by the ITU, it has been approved as an international standard for digital broadcasts on the HF (shortwave) bands. A DRM broadcast rivals FM mono quality and can also send graphic images and web pages via a separate information channel.

Shortwave listening also remains popular with some expatriates who tune in shortwave transmissions from their homeland. Additionally, a number of remotely controlled shortwave receivers located around the world are available to users on the web. While radio hobbyists report that the number of shortwave listening clubs has diminished and printed magazines devoted to the hobby are few, enthusiasts such as Glenn Hauser and others continue to populate web sites, and originate podcasts dedicated to the pursuit.

<doc id="1220573" wikidata="Q1076005" url="?curid=1220573" title="Update (SQL)">
<text>An SQL UPDATE statement changes the data of one or more records in a table. Either all the rows can be updated, or a subset may be chosen using a condition.

The codice_1 statement has the following form:

:codice_1 &quot;table_name&quot; codice_3 &quot;column_name&quot; = &quot;value&quot; [, &quot;column_name&quot; = &quot;value ...&quot;] codice_4 &quot;condition&quot;]

For the codice_1 to be successful, the user must have data manipulation privileges (codice_1 privilege) on the table or column and the updated value must not conflict with all the applicable constraints (such as primary keys, unique indexes, codice_7 constraints, and codice_8 constraints).

In some databases, such as PostgreSQL, when a FROM clause is present, what essentially happens is that the target table is joined to the tables mentioned in the fromlist, and each output row of the join represents an update operation for the target table. When using FROM, one should ensure that the join produces at most one output row for each row to be modified. In other words, a target row shouldn&#x27;t join to more than one row from the other table(s). If it does, then only one of the join rows will be used to update the target row, but which one will be used is not readily predictable.

Because of this indeterminacy, referencing other tables only within sub-selects is safer, though often harder to read and slower than using a join.

MySQL does not conform to ANSI standard.

==Examples==
Set the value of column &quot;C1&quot; in table &quot;T&quot; to 1, only in those rows where the value of column &quot;C2&quot; is &quot;a&quot;.
UPDATE T
 SET C1 = 1
 WHERE C2 = &#x27;a&#x27;
In table &quot;T&quot;, set the value of column &quot;C1&quot; to 9 and the value of &quot;C3&quot; to 4 for all rows for which the value of column &quot;C2&quot; is &quot;a&quot;.
UPDATE T
 SET C1 = 9,
 C3 = 4
 WHERE C2 = &#x27;a&#x27;

Increase value of column &quot;C1&quot; by 1 if the value in column &quot;C2&quot; is &quot;a&quot;.
UPDATE T
 SET C1 = C1 + 1
 WHERE C2 = &#x27;a&#x27;

Prepend the value in column &quot;C1&quot; with the string &quot;text&quot; if the value in column &quot;C2&quot; is &quot;a&quot;.
UPDATE T
 SET C1 = &#x27;text&#x27; || C1
 WHERE C2 = &#x27;a&#x27;

Set the value of column &quot;C1&quot; in table &quot;T1&quot; to 2, only if the value of column &quot;C2&quot; is found in the sublist of values in column &quot;C3&quot; in table &quot;T2&quot; having the column &quot;C4&quot; equal to 0.

UPDATE T1
 SET C1 = 2
 WHERE C2 IN ( SELECT C3
 FROM T2
 WHERE C4 = 0)

One may also update multiple columns in a single update statement:
UPDATE T
 SET C1 = 1,
 C2 = 2

Complex conditions and JOINs are also possible:
UPDATE T
 SET A = 1
 WHERE C1 = 1
 AND C2 = 2

Some databases allow the non-standard use of the FROM clause:

UPDATE a
 SET a.[updated_column] = updatevalue
 FROM articles a
 JOIN classification c
 ON a.articleID = c.articleID
 WHERE c.classID = 1
Or on Oracle systems (assuming there is an index on classification.articleID):

UPDATE
 SELECT *
 FROM articles
 JOIN classification
 ON articles.articleID = classification.articleID
 WHERE classification.classID = 1
SET [updated_column] = updatevalue

With long name of table:

UPDATE MyMainTable AS a
SET a.LName = Smith
WHERE a.PeopleID = 1235
==Potential issues==
* See Halloween Problem. It is possible for certain kinds of codice_1 statements to become an infinite loop when the codice_4 clause and one or more codice_3 clauses may utilize an intertwined index.

<doc id="1220577" wikidata="Q7912737" url="?curid=1220577" title="Value Line">
<text>Value Line, Inc. is a publicly traded investment research and financial publishing firm based in New York City. Founded in 1931 by Arnold Bernhard, Value Line is best known for publishing &quot;The Value Line Investment Survey&quot;, a stock analysis newsletter that tracks approximately 1,700 publicly traded stocks.

==History==
The &quot;Value Line&quot; was a line representing a multiple of cash flow that Bernhard would visually &quot;fit&quot; or superimpose over a price chart. This was a pioneering attempt to normalize the value of different companies. He soon began publishing his investment survey. Bernhard published &quot;The Evaluation of Common Stocks&quot; in 1959.

In 1946 Bernhard hired Samuel Eisenstadt as a proofreader, a graduate of Baruch College who majored in statistics. In 1965 Eisenstadt convinced Bernhard to use a statistical method called ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis to replace Bernhard&#x27;s visual method of fitting cash flow to a price chart. Using scores of Monroe mechanical calculators and a handful of data operators, Bernhard and Eisenstadt produced a stock picking system that caught the attention of academic Fischer Black of the University of Chicago. Black published an article in the &quot;Financial Analysts Journal&quot;, &quot;Yes, Virginia, There Is Hope: Tests of the Value Line Ranking System&quot; in 1973. The system came to be known as the &quot;Value Line Ranking System for Timeliness&quot;. With Eisenstadt on board, Bernhard continued to expand the business, adding the other publications and mutual funds along the way. In May 1983, Value Line sold stock for the public for the first time (), though the Bernhard family retained 80% control.

Bernhard died in December 1987, but until his death, Bernhard continued his literary interests by combining with W. H. Auden, Jacques Barzun and Lionel Trilling in founding the Mid-Century Book Society.

Shortly after his death, his daughter, Jean Buttner, was named CEO of Value Line.

==Fraud case==
Fraud was uncovered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in November 2009. The fraud, which spanned nearly 20 years and involved over $24 million, was committed by Value Line against its mutual fund shareholders. The fraud was first reported to the SEC in 2004 by the then Value Line Fund () portfolio manager and Chief Quantitative Strategist, John (Jack) Dempsey of Easton, Connecticut, who was required to sign a Code of Business Ethics as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Restitution totaling $34 million was placed in a fair fund and returned to the affected Value Line mutual fund investors. The Commission ordered Value Line to pay a total of $43,705,765 in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalty, and ordered CEO Jean Buttner and COO David Henigson to pay civil penalties of $1,000,000 and $250,000, respectively. The Commission further imposed officer and director bars and brokerdealer, investment adviser, and investment company associational bars (“Associational Bars”) against Buttner and Henigson. No criminal charges were filed.

<text>Robert Hill Hanna (6 August 1886 – 15 June 1967), was a Presbyterian Irish-born naturalised immigrant to Canada. He was a soldier in the Canadian Expeditionary Force and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Hanna joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force in November 1914. He was a Company Sergeant-Major in the 29th Battalion, CEF, Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War when the following deed took place during the Battle of Hill 70 for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. The citation published in the London Gazette, of November 8, 1917, detailed the event as follows:-

On August 21, 1917, at Hill 70 Lens, France, Company Sergeant-Major Hanna&#x27;s company met with most severe enemy resistance at a heavily protected strong point, which had beaten off three assaults and all the officers of the company had become casualties. This warrant officer, under heavy machine-gun and rifle fire, coolly collected and led a party against the strong point, rushed through the wire and personally killed four of the enemy, capturing the position and silencing the machine-gun. This courageous action was responsible for the capture of a most important tactical point.

Hanna was decorated for his courageous actions with the Victoria Cross by His Majesty King George V, at a ceremony held at Buckingham Palace on December 5, 1917. He later achieved the rank of lieutenant.

He was born near Hanna&#x27;s Close in Kilkeel, County Down, in the province of Ulster in Ireland, near to the Mourne Mountains. His personal sword is on the wall of Kilkeel Royal British Legion club. In Kilkeel he belonged to Aughnahoory Loyal Orange Lodge No 343 and upon moving to Canada he joined the Orange Order in Canada Vancouver based Ontario L.O.L. No. 2226.

He died in Mount Lehman, British Columbia, Canada on 15 June 1967. Hanna is buried at the Masonic Cemetery, Burnaby, British Columbia (plot 49, section C, grave 2).

<text>John James Dwyer, VC (9 March 1890 – 17 January 1962) Commonly known as Jack or JJ, he was a politician and an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly in 1931 representing the Labor Party, Dwyer served as Deputy Premier of Tasmania from August 1958 to May 1959 and remained in office until his death.

When Dwyer was 27 years old he was a sergeant in the 4th Company, Australian Machine Gun Corps, Australian Imperial Force during the First World War. At that time, the following deed took place for which he was later awarded the VC.

On 26 September 1917 at Zonnebeke, Belgium, during the Battle of Polygon Wood, Sergeant Dwyer, in charge of a Vickers machine-gun during an advance, rushed his gun forward to within 30 yards of an enemy machine-gun, fired point blank at it and killed the crew. He then seized the gun and carried it back across shell-swept ground to the Australian front line. On the following day, when the position was being heavily shelled, and his Vickers gun was blown up, he took his team through the enemy barrage and fetched a reserve gun which he put into use in the shortest possible time.

Dwyer later achieved the rank of lieutenant. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial.

<text>John Weir Foote, (May 5, 1904 – May 2, 1988) was a Canadian military chaplain and politician. He received the Victoria Cross for his actions during the Dieppe Raid in 1942. Foote is the only Canadian chaplain to be awarded the Victoria Cross. After the war he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and served as a Progressive Conservative member from 1948 to 1959. He represented the riding of Durham. He served as a cabinet minister in the government of Leslie Frost.

== Early life ==
Foote was born in Madoc in eastern Ontario on May 5, 1904. He was educated at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, at Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario and at Presbyterian College and McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. He entered the Presbyterian ministry in 1934, serving congregations in Fort-Coulonge, Quebec, and Port Hope, Ontario.

In 1934 it is recorded that Rev. John Weir Foote joined the Loyal Orange Association, being initiated into Fraserville Loyal Orange Lodge No. 46, Ontario.

In December 1939, after the outbreak of the Second World War, he enlisted in the Canadian Army. He was posted to The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Wentworth Regiment) (RHLI) as the Regimental Chaplain with the rank of Honorary Captain.

== Victoria Cross ==
Foote was 38 years old and serving as the padre of the RHLI, when he performed the following deed during the Dieppe Raid for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross:

On August 19, 1942 at Dieppe, France, Captain Foote coolly and calmly during the eight hours of the battle walked about collecting the wounded and carry them to safety. His gallant actions saved many lives and inspired those around him by his example. At the end of this gruelling time he climbed from the landing craft that was to have taken him to safety and deliberately walked into the German position in order to be taken prisoner so that he could be of help to those men who would be in captivity until May 5, 1945.

His VC award was gazetted after the Second World War on February 14, 1946, the citation read:

He later achieved the rank of Major and he remained with the Royal Canadian Army Chaplain Corps at Camp Borden until being demobilized in 1948.

== Politics ==

He won a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1948 provincial election and served as the Progressive Conservative Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) for Durham. He was first appointed to serve as Deputy Commissioner for the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, then into the cabinet after the 1951 election as Ontario Minister of Reform Institutions, but stepped down in 1957, following a number of heart attacks. He retired from the provincial legislature in 1959.

=== Cabinet positions ===

== Later life ==
Foote returned to the RHLI in 1964, serving as Honorary Lieutenant-Colonel until 1973.

He made his home with his wife, the former Edith Sheridan (1898–1986), in Cobourg, Ontario, until his death on May 2, 1988. He is buried in Union Cemetery, Cobourg.

== Legacy ==
The Royal Canadian Legion branch in Grafton, Ontario was renamed the &quot;Lt. Col. John W Foote V.C. C.D Branch 580&quot; in 1982.

The James Street Armoury in Hamilton, Ontario, where the RHLI is now based, along with The Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise&#x27;s) and 11 Field Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery, was renamed the John W. Foote VC Armoury in his memory. Prior to his death, John Foote donated his medals to the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry where they are held at the RHLI Heritage Museum at the John W Foote VC Armoury. The Armoury is a Classified Federal Heritage Building 1986 on the Register of the Government of Canada Heritage Buildings.

<text>John Park VC (February 1835 – 16 May 1863), born in Derry, Ireland, was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Park was 19 years old, and a sergeant in the 77th Regiment (later The Middlesex Regiment – Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Own), British Army during the Crimean War when the following deeds took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

During the Crimean War on 20 September 1854 at the Battle of the Alma and on 5 November 1854 at the Battle of Inkerman, Sergeant Park showed great bravery. On 19 April 1855, Park also distinguished himself at the taking of the Russian Rifle Pits, during which he was severely wounded. He showed great resolution at both attacks on the Redan.

Park&#x27;s citation reads:
Park and Alexander Wright were the only two soldiers of the 77th Regiment awarded the Victoria Cross for the Crimean War. In 1857, both were with their regiment when it was allotted to New South Wales and missed the first VC investiture at Hyde Park, London, on 26 June 1857. The medals were sent to the General Officer Commanding New South Wales who presented the medals in Sydney in 1858 as the regiment was preparing to sail to India. Craig Wilcox notes ‘The Victoria Crosses awarded Sergeant Park and Private Wright of the 77th Regiment were conferred hastily, almost furtively, as the regiment was about to leave Sydney, to help suppress the Indian Mutiny’.

Park died in Allahabad, India, on 16 May 1863, from sunstroke.

<text>Israel Harding, VC (21 October 1833 – 22 May 1917) was a sailor in the Royal Navy and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Naval career==
Harding was 48 years old, and a gunner in the Royal Navy during the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC).

On 11 July 1882 at Alexandria, Egypt, , with other ships, was bombarding the forts of the city and suffering damage and casualties from the enemy&#x27;s guns. During the engagement a 10-inch shell passed through the ship&#x27;s side and lodged on the main deck. Gunner Harding, hearing a shout that there was a live shell just above the hatchway (which led to the magazine) rushed up from below, picked it up and flung it into a tub of water. Had the shell burst it would probably have caused many deaths.

On return to England the Victoria Cross was presented to him by Edward, Prince of Wales.

Harding later achieved the rank of chief gunner. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum in London.

<doc id="1220608" wikidata="Q4723236" url="?curid=1220608" title="Alfred Oliver Pollard">
<text>Alfred Oliver Pollard (4 May 1893 – 4 December 1960) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He later became a prolific author of crime and mystery books.

==Military service==
Pollard was born in Wallington, Surrey, and was educated at St. Olave&#x27;s Grammar School and Merchant Taylors&#x27; School, 1906–1908. He had volunteered for service in the British Army on 8 August 1914, enlisting in the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC). Up to that date, he had worked as a clerk at an insurance company. 

He spent most of the First World War on the Western Front and was twice wounded, on both occasions returning to his unit after recovering. In September 1915 while a sergeant, he received the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) for bravery in Sanctuary Wood, in the Ypres Salient. In January 1916 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Honourable Artillery Company, twice earning the Military Cross (MC) before he was awarded the VC for the following action:

On 29 April 1917 at Gavrelle, France, the troops of various units had become disorganised owing to the heavy casualties from shell fire and a subsequent determined attack with very strong forces caused further confusion and retirement. Second Lieutenant Pollard realised the seriousness of the situation and with only four men he started a counter-attack with bombs, pressing it home until he had broken the enemy attack and regained all that had been lost and much ground in addition. This officer&#x27;s splendid example inspired courage into every man who saw him.

Pollard&#x27;s bravery during the war earned him the highest (and largest number of) awards to a soldier in his unit. He received his VC and MC and bar at Buckingham Palace on 21 July 1917.

His Victoria Cross is held by the Honourable Artillery Company in London, with a copy on display in its Medal Room.

==Post 1918==
After the war, Pollard found it hard to settle and took a variety of jobs. In June 1924 he entered the Royal Air Force as a pilot, but resigned as a flying officer in December 1926. He then became a professional writer, including an autobiography, &quot;Fire-Eater: the Memoirs of a VC&quot; published in 1932, which recounts his experience of the war, from joining the HAC on the outbreak of war up to the armistice. It depicts a man who was able to deal with the violence and huge loss of life by rationalising it as a necessary evil to destroy the enemy. His other works – about 60 over three decades – were mainly mystery, murder or spy novels. He also worked as a columnist for a number of London and provincial newspapers and undertook some broadcasting for BBC radio.

According to the author John Lewis-Stempel post-war, Pollard attempted to pawn his VC in apparent disillusionment. There is no citation for this in the book.

Pollard died aged 67 on 5 December 1960 in Bournemouth, where he was cremated at Bournemouth Crematorium.

==Family==
His elder brother, Frank, was also a member of the HAC but, when he believed he would not be sent to the front, deserted and joined the Grenadier Guards. He was killed in action in September 1916, just before he was to be sent back to England on an officers&#x27; commissioning course.

In 1918, Pollard married Mary Ainsley of Trefilan, Purley, the marriage ended in divorce in 1924. In September 1925 he married Violet Irene Swarbrick. There were no children by either marriage.

<doc id="1220612" wikidata="Q5393257" url="?curid=1220612" title="Ernest Herbert Pitcher">
<text>Chief Petty Officer Ernest Herbert Pitcher (31 December 1888 − 10 February 1946) (middle name also recorded as James) was a Royal Navy (RN) sailor and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Naval career==
During the First World War Pitcher served in Q ships commanded by Commander Gordon Campbell. The first was HMS &quot;Farnborough&quot; (Q.5) which sank two U-boats but was herself sunk by the second; Captain Campbell was awarded the VC after the second action. Most of the crew, including Pitcher, were rescued and followed Campbell to HMS &quot;Pargust&quot;.

&quot;Pargust&quot; sank the U-boat &quot;UC-29&quot; but was herself severely damaged. The Admiralty decided that &quot;Pargust&quot;&#x27;s action was worthy of the VC but that all of the crew had acted with equal valour, so article 13 of the VC&#x27;s royal warrant was applied and the ship&#x27;s company voted for one commissioned officer and one petty officer or seaman to receive the award: these were &quot;Pargust&quot; first lieutenant, Ronald Stuart, and seaman William Williams. Pitcher received the Distinguished Service Medal. Campbell and the crew then transferred to HMS &quot;Dunraven&quot;, in which the action took place for which Pitcher was awarded the VC.

Petty Officer Pitcher was captain of the 4-inch gun crew. When the magazine below them blew up the crew were blown into the air, but Pitcher and another man landed on mock railway trucks made of wood and canvas, which cushioned their falls and saved their lives. His VC was awarded by ballot of the gun crew. Lieutenant Charles George Bonner was also awarded the VC. Pitcher also received the &quot;Croix de Guerre&quot; and the &quot;Médaille Militaire&quot;.

In 1920 Pitcher was promoted to chief petty officer. In 1927 he retired from the Royal Navy and lived in Dorset, where he taught woodwork in a boys&#x27; school in Swanage and also ran a pub, the &quot;Royal Oak&quot; in Herston. On the outbreak of the Second World War he rejoined the Navy and served onshore in the south of England. After the war his health deteriorated and he died of tuberculosis on 10 February 1946. His body was brought back to Swanage, where he is buried in Northbrook Cemetery.

<text>Peter Arnold Brown (April 27, 1927 in Winkler, Manitoba – March 5, 1994) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1973 to 1988, representing the riding of Rhineland for the Progressive Conservative Party.

The son of Isaac J. Brown and Katherine Hamm, he was educated in Rosenbach and Winkler. In 1960, he married Katie Jansen. Brown worked as a businessman and a farmer before entering political life. He served as a councillor in the town of Winkler from 1967 to 1974, and was the first vice-president of the Manitoba Beet Growers Association for a time, as well as serving on several local boards.

Brown was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1973, defeating Social Credit Party leader and MLA Jacob Froese by about 1,400 votes (the Social Credit Party would never again elect an MLA in Manitoba). He was re-elected in the 1977 election, which the Tories won under Sterling Lyon; Brown, however, was not appointed to cabinet. He was re-elected in the elections of 1981 and 1986, and resigned in 1988 when his riding was eliminated through redistribution. He died in Winkler in 1994.

<text>David Rushe VC (28 April 1827 – 6 November 1886) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross.

==Details==
Rushe was 30 years old, and a troop sergeant-major in the 9th Lancers (The Queen&#x27;s Royal), British Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:
Rushe received his Victoria Cross from Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle on 4 January 1860. This joined his medals for the 1st and 2nd Sikh Wars and the Indian Mutiny. He also received the Good Conduct Medal and the Long Service Medal.

==Further information==

He later achieved the rank of regimental sergeant-major. Rushe died on 6 November 1886 at Great Marlow and was buried without a stone at All Saints Church, Marlow. His widow sold the medal, but his descendants re-purchased the medal in 1959 and later lent in to be displayed at his regimental museum within Derby Museum.

<text>The VT50 is a CRT-based computer terminal that was introduced by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in July 1974. It provided a display with 12 rows and 80 columns of upper-case text, and used an expanded set of control characters and forward-only scrolling based on the earlier VT05. DEC documentation of the era refers to the terminals as the DECscope, a name that was otherwise almost never seen.

The VT50 was sold only for a short period before it was replaced by the VT52 in September 1975. The VT52 provided a screen of 24 rows and 80 columns of text and supported all 95 ASCII characters as well as 32 graphics characters, bi-directional scrolling, and an expanded control character system. DEC produced a series of upgraded VT52s with additional hardware for various uses.

The VT52 family was followed by the much more sophisticated VT100 in 1978.

== Description ==
These terminals supported asynchronous communication at baud rates up to 9600 bits per second and did not require any fill characters. Like other early DEC terminals they were equipped with both an RS-232 port as well as a 20mA current loop, an older serial standard used with teletype machines that was more suitable for transmission over long runs of twisted-pair wiring. Data was read into a small buffer, which the display hardware periodically read to produce the display. Characters typed on the keyboard were likewise stored in a buffer and sent over the serial line as quickly as possible.

To interpret the commands being sent in the serial data, it used a primitive central processing unit (CPU) built from small-scale-integration integrated circuits. It examined the data while the display hardware was inactive between raster scan lines, and then triggered the display hardware to take over at the appropriate time. The display system returned control to the CPU when it completed drawing the line. The CPU was so basic that addition and subtraction could only be done by repeatedly incrementing or decrementing two registers. Moreover, the time taken by such a loop had to be nearly constant, or text lower on the screen would be displayed in the wrong place during that refresh.

Typing a character produced a noise by activating a relay. The relay was also used as a buzzer to sound the bell character, producing a sound that &quot;has been compared to the sound of a &#x27;52 Chevy stripping its gears.&quot;

DEC also offered an optional hard-copy device called an electrolytic copier, which fit into the blank panel on the right side of the display. This device was able to print, scan-line by scan-line, an exact replica of the screen onto a damp roll of special paper. It did this by electroplating metal from an electrode into the paper. The paper ran between two electrodes. The electrode on one side was a thin straight bar oriented across the paper width. The electrode on the other side was a thin helical bar wrapped around a rotating drum. One rotation of the drum scanned an intersecting area of the electrodes across the width of the paper. While the copier did an admirable job of capturing the contents of the screen, the output of the copier had an unfortunate resemblance to wet toilet tissue. Digital patented the innovation of having a single character generator provide the text font for both screen and copier.

The basic layout of the terminal, with the screen and main keyboard on the left and the blank area on the right, was intended to allow the system to be upgraded. The printer was one such upgrade, but over time DEC offered a number of other options. The large size of the cabinet was deliberate, to avoid a cooling fan. The two circuit boards with processor and memory at the base of the terminal, and a single board with power-supply and monitor electronics at the rear, were cooled by convection. The large, flat top of the terminal frequently accommodated large volumes of DEC documentation, which could block the vents and cause overheating.

== Versions ==

=== VT50 ===
The VT50 was the first terminal Digital produced in this cabinet. It provided only 12 lines of text with blank lines between them to use the entire vertical area of the display. Like its predecessor, the VT05, the VT50 did not support lowercase letters. Computer users of that era seldom needed lowercase text.

=== VT50H ===
The VT50H added a separate &quot;auxilary keyboard&quot; on the right side of the original keyboard. This was arranged in the fashion of a numeric keypad with additional control keys above the numbers. Four of these were cursor keys which sent through for up, down, left and right, respectively. Another three of the keys were unlabeled and could be programmed to return any two-character code, and would default to through .

=== VT52 ===
The VT50 was soon replaced by the greatly upgraded VT52. The VT52 had considerably larger buffers, giving it the capacity to store not only a full 24 lines of text that better utilized the screen space, but also the text off the top and bottom of the screen. This allowed the terminal to scroll backwards a limited amount without having to ask the host to re-send data. Another significant upgrade was that the VT52 included lowercase text support. Many new commands and features were added:

* Support for the , and characters, when the shift key was used with , or , respectively.
* Typing on the numeric keypad could now be distinguished from the main keyboard by turning on Alternate-Keypad Mode. This returned multi-character codes, through .
* New cursor control codes to support host-directed full-screen editing and a WYSIWYG display.
* A &quot;graphics character set&quot; which included several less-common characters as well as the ability to print some fractions in-line, like .

One notable feature was the introduction of a separate function keypad with the &quot;Gold Key&quot;, which was used for editing programs like WPS-8, KED, and EDT. Pressing the Gold Key and then typing one of the keys on the keyboard sent a command sequence back to the host computer.

=== VT55 ===
The VT55 incorporated an add-on graphics system that was capable of displaying two mathematical functions or histograms. This was invoked by sending a command string that sent the terminal into &quot;graphics mode&quot;, with further data being sent to a separate buffer and CPU. Both systems mixed their data during the display, allowing the user to mix graphics and text on a single screen, as opposed to systems like the Tektronix 4010 or plotters that had to slowly draw text using graphics commands. This system became known as waveform graphics, and would re-appear on the later VT105.

=== Block mode versions ===
The VT61 and VT62 were block-mode terminals. The VT62 was to be used in conjunction with TRAX, a transaction processing operating system on high-end PDP-11s. They used the same cabinet but had a more complete custom processor. Application-specific behavior was coded in separate PROM memory, using a separate instruction code that the processor interpreted. This unpublished language was to be used to easily develop additional models specific to single Digital marketing organizations. These terminals synthesized a &quot;tock&quot; sound on a speaker for feedback when a key was pressed instead of the relay. Though the keyboards were identical, VT6x users admired the superior &quot;feel&quot;.

=== VT78 ===
The relatively large expansion area of the VT50 case, combined with rapidly shrinking electronics in the late 1970s, allowed DEC to produce single-box, stand-alone minicomputer/terminals similar to a contemporary microcomputer. The VT78 added a single-chip PDP-8 processor to the VT52, ran a variant of Digital&#x27;s OS/8 operating system, and usually WPS-8, Digital&#x27;s word processing system.

== Escape sequences ==
VT52 codes remained proprietary to DEC, although a number of other companies provided emulations in their terminals. Later VT series terminals supported a subset of these commands. One interesting case is the GEMDOS system and its offshoot, the TOS operating system of the Atari ST. These systems used a VT52-based screen driver in an era when ANSI escape codes had already become almost universal. This version added several new commands including the ability to select colors.

=== Standard commands ===

VT52 commands normally consisted of the escape character and a single character following it. The exception to this rule was the Y command, which also required two numbers to be sent.

====Cursor positioning====
The code was used to position the cursor anywhere on the screen, using two parameters representing the X and Y coordinates of the cursor position, with the upper left corner of the screen being position 1,1. These numbers were sent as ASCII characters of that value, adding 31. For instance, to position the cursor at column 30 and line 20, you would add 31 to each value to get 61 and 51, then look up those ASCII characters, and . The complete command would then be (note the row, column ordering, not X, Y). Adding 31 ensures that the characters are shifted out of the control range into the printable character range, so they will transmit properly.

====Terminal identifier codes====
The command allowed the host computer to identify the capabilities of the terminal. There were eight possible responses.

====Copier codes====
Several additional codes were used with the optional copier:

====Graphics mode====
The VT52 and VT55 included two characters sets, ASCII and &quot;graphics mode&quot; which switched out the lower case characters and some punctuation with new characters useful for the display of math. Unusual were glyphs for ¹⁄, ³⁄, ⁵⁄, ⁷⁄, which could be combined with subscript numbers to produce things like ⅗, and scan lines allowing a function to be plotted with 8 times higher vertical resolution than text.

=== VT52 compatibility mode ===
Later VT terminals supported VT52 commands, as well as adding a single new command to return to full ANSI mode.

Compatibility mode changed the response to the command; all models responded with the code .

=== GEMDOS/TOS extensions ===
The GEMDOS version of the VT52 command set adds a number of new commands. These mostly concerned color support, with the color selection being sent as a single character using the same number-to-character encoding as the command. Only the last four bits of the number were used, providing support for 16 colors. The Atari ST only supported 4 of those in 80 column mode and all 16 in 40 column mode. A few new cursor commands were added as well, essentially filling out the set of the original VT52 by including commands that cleared toward the top of the screen instead of the bottom. The system did not support a number of VT52 commands, including F, G and Z.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Frederick Pickard (12 April 1844 – 1 March 1880) was a British Army officer and courtier. For his actions in New Zealand in 1863, he was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. After further service and promotion in the Royal Artillery, Pickard was appointed an Equerry to the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn in 1871; seven years later, he was made Assistant Keeper of the Privy Purse and Assistant Private Secretary to the Queen and promoted to lieutenant colonel, but died of tuberculosis in France, aged 35, less than two years later.

== Early life ==
Pickard was born on 12 April 1844 at Forest Hill in the Nottinghamshire town of Worksop. He was the third son of a former officer in the Royal Artillery, Henry William Pickard (1794–1873), JP, of Sturminster Marshall, Dorset, and 11 Carlton Crescent, Southampton, and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of John Fullerton, of Thrybergh Park in Yorkshire. The Pickard family claimed descent from a medieval Lord Mayor of London; in the 18th century, Jocelyn Pickard, a barrister from Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, moved to Bloxworth House in Dorset and married a Dorsetshire heiress; Henry William Pickard was his great-grandson in the direct male-line, although he was his father&#x27;s youngest son.

==Military and court career==
In 1858, Gentleman Cadet Pickard was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in the Royal Artillery . In May 1871, Pickard was appointed Equerry to Prince Arthur, later the Duke of Connaught and Strathearn; later that year, he was promoted to the rank of second captain, and in 1872 to brevet major. In December 1877, the Queen appointed Pickard a groom-in-waiting after the resignation of Lieutenant-Colonel William Henry Frederick Cavendish; the following year, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and in July he stepped aside as Connaught&#x27;s Equerry, when he was appointed Extra Equerry and Captain Alfred Mordaunt Egerton replaced him. Later that year, the Queen appointed him Assistant Keeper of the Privy Purse, and her Assistant Private Secretary, and shortly afterwards, he was promoted to the full rank of major. In March 1879, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath.

=== Victoria Cross ===
When Pickard was a 19-year-old lieutenant, he was serving in the Invasion of Waikato (one of the campaigns in the New Zealand Wars); he and Assistant Surgeon William Temple were awarded the Victoria Cross, the United Kingdom&#x27;s highest bravery award, for the following deed, which took place on 20 November 1863 at Rangiriri, New Zealand. His citation reads:
=== Death ===
On 1 March 1880, Pickard died at Cannes, in France, reportedly of tuberculosis. He was buried at the city&#x27;s Grand Jas Cemetery. His medal group – consisting of his Victoria Cross, the insignia of the Order of the Bath, the Russian Order of St Stanislas and the Austrian Order of Leopold, and his New Zealand Medal – were purchased at auction in New Zealand on behalf of the Michael Ashcroft Trust in 2002. They are on display at the Lord Ashcroft Gallery in the Imperial War Museum in London.

<text>Udi Hrant Kenkulian (; ; 1901 – August 29, 1978), often referred to as Udi Hrant (lit. &quot;oud-player Hrant&quot;) or as Hrant Emre (&quot;Hrant of the soul&quot;) was an oud player of Turkish classical music, and a key transitional figure in its transformation into a contemporary style of popular music. He was an ethnic Armenian citizen of Turkey who spent most of his life in Turkey and wrote most of his lyrics in Turkish. He concurrently composed and performed in Armenian as well, although to a much lesser degree. Kenkulian recorded numerous sides in the United States and Europe during his travels in the mid-20th century.

As an oud player, he was a major innovator, introducing left-hand pizzicato, bidirectional picking (the tradition had been to use the pick only on the downstroke), double stops, and novel tunings (sometimes using open tunings or tuning the paired strings in octaves instead of to a single note). According to Harold G. Hagopian, he was most respected for his improvisational &quot;taksim&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Adapazarı, declared blind four days after his birth, Hrant as a child sang in the choir of an Armenian Apostolic Church. His family fled to Konya in 1915 to escape the Armenian genocide; there Hrant first studied the oud, with a teacher named Garabed. In 1918 the family returned west, first to Adapazarı and then to Istanbul, where Hrant continued his musical studies under some of the leading teachers of the time, including Kemani Agopos Ayvazyan, Dikran Katsakhian, and Udi Krikor Berberian (all of whom were Armenians). Somewhere along the way he also learned to speak French, and was actually accepted at age 16 to a Paris-based school for the blind, but he contracted typhoid fever and was unable to travel.

Several attempts (including by doctors in Vienna) failed to restore his eyesight, which prevented him from playing in ensembles. He made a modest living playing in cafes, giving music lessons, and selling instruments. There is some question about when he first recorded; he claimed to have made a record as early as age 19, but his earliest known recordings would appear to be from no earlier than 1927, since they used an electronic microphone.

In 1928, he fell in love with Ağavini, the sister of one of his students, but her parents would not let her marry a musician; they met again by accident in 1937 and married ten years later. In the meantime, he had written numerous songs about his desire for an absent love.

He slowly, but steadily, gained more fame as a musician. Some of his Turkish recordings were released internationally as early as the 1930s, first on RCA Victor, and later on such labels as Balkan (New York), Perfectaphone and Yildiz (probably, according to Hagopian, a single company, address unknown), and Istanbul (Los Angeles). Composer Şeirf Içli introduced him to Kanuni Ismail Şençalar, in whose group he played for a while, leading to opportunities to perform on Ankara Radio. In 1950, a wealthy Greek American brought him to America for another unsuccessful attempt at restoring his eyesight. The trip, however, led to a series of concerts in New York City, Boston, Detroit, Los Angeles, and Fresno, California, playing both Turkish classical music and his own compositions. This tour apparently increased his prestige at home: he began to perform frequently on Istanbul Radio, first as a soloist and later with a chorus he formed. It also recorded in U.S. recording sessions for Smyrnaphon and Oriental Moods. The former, according to Hagopian, are marred by his being &quot;paired... with inferior musicians&quot;. The latter were a deluxe set, believed to be the first-ever inclusion of an oud with a violin and piano in a chamber music setting, issued in an elaborately packaged set with English language titles given to the songs. The recording included both Hrant&#x27;s originals and classic songs by Kanuni Artaki, Bimen Şen, and others. During his trips to the U.S., he conducted master classes with young Armenian-American oud players such as Richard Hagopian, and Harry Minassian.

His recordings for Balkan, with Şükrü Tunar on clarinet, Ahmet Yatman on kanun and Ali Kocadinc on darbuka, and an unnamed violinist (probably Kemani Haydar Tatliyay), are notable for the fact that although they were recorded in Turkey, with a mix of Turkish and Armenian musicians, they include lyrics in Armenian; he also did other records with Turkish lyrics with the same line-up. Again apparently the same line up (credited as &quot;Oudi Hrant and Friends&quot;) backed up singer Boghos Kirechjian (Hrant&#x27;s brother-in-law, aka &quot;Oudi Bogos&quot;) on several records. His original songs written in Armenian include &quot;Parov Yegar Siroon Yar,&quot; &quot;Siroon Aghchig Siroon Yar,&quot; &quot;Anoosh Yaren Heratsa,&quot; &quot;Ghurgeet [Khrjit],&quot; &quot;Srdis Vra Kar Me Ga,&quot; and &quot;Hoknadz Durtmadz,&quot; all of which but the last have been recorded by his student Richard Hagopian.

He toured internationally again in 1963, playing in Paris, Beirut, Greece, the United States, and Yerevan, then the capital of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. He recorded again in the U.S. during this time, but according to Hagopian the recordings are &quot;inferior... [F]or small labels and record producers eager to capitalize on the &#x27;belly-dance craze&#x27;.&quot; Canary Records of Boston, Massachusetts released a compilation of these tracks in 2016.

In 1969, Udi Hrant awarded the title of &quot;Udi&quot; and status as master of oud playing to five younger Armenian-American oud players whom he deemed worthy, some of whom had been his own students, (in alphabetical order): John Berberian, Chick Ganimian, Richard Hagopian, George Mgrdichian, and Harry Minassian.

His last performance was in Istanbul in April 1978, a benefit for the Sourp Purgich Armenian Hospital, at which time he already had the cancer that would kill him that August.

<text>Abel Heywood (25 February 1810 – 19 August 1893) was an English publisher, radical and mayor of Manchester.

==Early life==
Heywood was born into a poor family in Prestwich, who moved to Manchester after Heywood&#x27;s father died in 1812. Abel obtained a basic education at the Anglican Bennett Street School, and at the age of nine started work in a warehouse for 1&quot;s&quot; and 6&quot;d&quot; a week. He supplemented his energetic autodidactism by attending the Mechanics&#x27; Institute, and following a summary dismissal by his manufacturing employer set up a penny reading room in Manchester at some point in 1831. He gained the Manchester agency for &quot;The Poor Man&#x27;s Guardian&quot;, and made a point of refusing to pay the stamp duty intended to suppress mass publishing, being imprisoned in 1832 for four months for refusing to pay a £48 fine. Even though subject to heavy fines repeatedly throughout the next two years (which he paid), he continued his commitment to inexpensive newspapers. His bookselling business in Oldham Street was successful and continued for many years.

==Radicalism and Chartism==

During the next two decades Heywood had an ambiguous relationship with Manchester&#x27;s frenetic Radicalism and agitation. In 1828 he was involved in the protests to reform the management of the Mechanics&#x27; Institute. Run on the model of the Edinburgh School of Art, total power was given to honorary members, who paid £10 a year. The managers of the institution were then chosen by these honorary members, effectively ensuring constant middle class directorship. Anger over this and other matters such as the high annual subscription fee of £1 for ordinary members and the strict prohibition of political lectures or literature, including newspapers, eventually boiled over. A number of subscribers, including Heywood, signed a document demanding the right to be allowed to elect nine directors from their own ranks, and once this was met with an unsatisfactory compromise these protestors broke away and formed the New Mechanics&#x27; Institute, electing Rowland Detrosier president. Although it is not known for certain if Abel remained in the old Institute or joined the new one, his brother and business partner John was an important member of the new Institute&#x27;s governing provisional committee. By 1834 the rebels were drawn back to the old Institute, after the flight of over one hundred members had forced them into the democratic reforms sought by the subscribers.

Despite these radical leanings, Abel&#x27;s business prospered and he was able to be active in public life, becoming one of the Commissioners of Police, essentially a 180 strong town council, in 1836, having responsibility for paving and sanitation. In April 1840 he was again prosecuted for his publishing, this time for a blasphemy charge. Heywood presented an affidavit in extenuation, in which he declared that as soon as he had learned that the papers were blasphemous he withdrew them from sale. Having previously received fines and imprisonment on other charges, he was permitted to change his plea from not guilty to guilty in return for a suspended sentence. Pressed by the Government, the court decided to discharge him rather than press for judgment. Correspondence between Sir Charles Shaw, the Chief Commissioner of Police for Manchester, and the Home Office, have since revealed that Heywood had informed Shaw of a planned Chartist rising in Bolton on the night of 22/23 January 1840. In return, Shaw instructed the Government to pressure the court to let him off.

Despite this, Heywood remained an active Chartist, and his business published much of the reading material of the town&#x27;s movement, including the &quot;Northern Star&quot;. He often used his wealth to bail out Chartists such as Feargus O&#x27;Connor, and in 1841 was elected treasurer of the National Charter Association, as well as sitting on the executive committee. At the same time he campaigned actively for the incorporation of the city and, once this was achieved, was elected to the council in 1843. His wider network included the Leeds-based publisher Alice Mann.

==Later publishing and political career as a Liberal==
Heywood served as alderman in 1853 and in 1859 stood unsuccessfully as a Radical Liberal candidate for Manchester. His first term as mayor was in 1862–1863, during the cotton famine, and in 1865 he stood again as a Liberal for Manchester, again unsuccessfully. He would not repeat the attempt, instead becoming mayor again in 1876–1877. A major achievement was his role in guiding Manchester Town Hall to its completion.

Heywood &amp; Son published &quot;An Up-To-Date Collection of Nigger Songs and Recitations&quot; in 1865. In 1866, Heywood noticed that working-class people were just beginning to use trains to travel for pleasure. Seeing no affordable travel guides, he began to publish a series of &quot;Penny Guides&quot;, short travel guides that covered such places as Buxton, Southport, Bath and the Isle of Wight. The first edition of &quot;A Guide to Bakewell and Haddon Hall&quot; was issued in 1893. By 1912, Heywood had about one hundred different guide pamphlets in publication.

The clock bell of the Town Hall, &quot;Great Abel&quot;, is named after Heywood and weighs 8 tons 2.5 cwt. It is inscribed with the initials AH and the Tennyson line &quot;Ring out the false, ring in the true&quot;.

<text>Kutluğ Ataman (born 1961 in Istanbul Turkey) is an acclaimed Turkish-American contemporary artist and feature filmmaker. Ataman&#x27;s films are known for their strong characterization and humanity. His early art works examine the ways in which people and communities create and rewrite their identities through self-expression, blurring the line between reality and fiction. His later works focus on history and geography as man-made constructs. He won the Carnegie Prize for his works &quot;Kuba&quot; in 2004. In the same year he was nominated for Turner Prize for his work &quot;Twelve&quot;.

== Biography ==
Ataman was born in Istanbul in 1961; his father was a diplomat. As a young man, he was involved in filming the events of the 1980 Turkish coup d&#x27;état, which led to his imprisonment and torture. After his release, in 1981 he left Turkey and moved to California, remaining there for 15 years. He graduated in 1985 with a BA in Film from the University of California and completed his MFA in 1988

His first feature film, &quot;Dark Waters (Karanlık Sular)&quot;, made in 1994, intriguingly utilised the metaphor of the vampire to encapsulate the crisis of contemporary Turkish culture. It was awarded five filmmaking prizes, including at the Istanbul International Film Festival. Openly gay himself, Ataman&#x27;s work often explores sexual identity and gender. In 1997 Ataman directed an eight-hour video, entitled &quot;kutluğ ataman’s semiha b. unplugged&quot;, focusing his hand-held camera on one of Turkey&#x27;s legends, the opera diva Semiha Berksoy, once publicly persecuted for an affair with the exiled communist poet Nazım Hikmet, now found living on in obscurity as an octogenarian in an eccentric dream world of her own creation. Ms. Berksoy served both as Ataman&#x27;s studied subject, as well as his shining star. This work was invited to several important art biennials and international film festivals. This was followed by his piece &quot;Women Who Wear Wigs&quot; featured four Turkish women – a revolutionary whose face remained obscured, well-known journalist and breast cancer survivor Nevval Sevindi, an anonymous devout Muslim student, and a transsexual.

Ataman&#x27;s next production, the feature film &quot;Lola+Bilidikid&quot;, made in 1998, was set in the trans subculture within the Turkish guest-worker community of Berlin, Germany. It won the Jury Special Prize at the 49th International Berlin Film Festival, after screening as the opening film of the festival&#x27;s Panorama Section in 1999. It also won the “Best Film” award at New York&#x27;s NewFest. In 2005, Ataman directed his next feature film, &quot;2 Girls&quot;, from his screenplay adaptation of the best-selling Turkish novel, “2 Girls” (İki Genç Kızın Romanı) by Perihan Mağden. The film tells the story of two teenage girls with contrasting personalities and backgrounds, who form a close bond with sexual implications, and by extension examines the economic, social, psychological, and sexual pressures shaping today&#x27;s youth. It won three prizes in 2005 for “Best Actress,” “Best Cinematography,” and “Best Director” at Antalya Film Festival, home to Turkey&#x27;s most prestigious film award. With this film Ataman also received a “Best Director” prize at the Istanbul International Film Festival and won the “Special Jury Prize” at the 8th Festival of Asian Cinema (New Delhi, India) in 2006. In April 2009 he was the Chair of the Jury of the Istanbul International Film Festival. His film &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot; was shown outside competition at this festival. In June 2009 &quot;Journey to the Moon&quot; was shown at the 31st Moscow International Film Festival. It was also screened at the BFI 53rd London Film Festival in October 2009, and in February 2011 had screenings in Brussels and Rotterdam as part of the Routes Award public programme.

In competition at the 2004 Carnegie International at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, he won the top award and one of America&#x27;s highest honours in art, the “Carnegie Prize.” In 2004, he was one of the four short-listed artists for the “Turner Prize” organized by London&#x27;s prestigious Tate Gallery. In 2003, Kutluğ Ataman was named “best artist of the year” by the London Observer newspaper. In January 2011 annual Almanac ArtAsiaPacific selected him one of the 2010 5 Artists of the Year.

Kutluğ Ataman was the 2011 laureate of the third European Cultural Fund ‘Routes’ Princess Margriet Award for cultural diversity.

His art works have been shown at Documenta (2002), the Venice Biennale (1999) as well as the Biennials in São Paulo (2002, 2010), Berlin (2001) and Istanbul (1997, 2003, 2007 and 2011). He was also in the Tate&#x27;s Triennial in 2003. His solo exhibitions include &quot;The Enemy Inside Me&quot;, a major retrospective at Istanbul Modern, Turkey (2010/11), &quot;Mesopotamian Dramaturgies&quot; at MAXXI – the National Museum of 21st Century Arts, Rome (2010) and at ARTER in Istanbul (2011). He featured two works from &quot;Mesopotamian Dramaturgies&quot; at the Brighton Festival, UK in 2011. Other major solo exhibitions have included &quot;fff&quot; at the Whitechapel Gallery, London (2010), Kutluğ Ataman: Paradise and Küba, Ludwig Museum, Cologne (2009/10), Lentos Kunstmuseum, Linz (2009) Vancouver Art Gallery (2008), Paradise, the Orange County Museum of Art, Newport Beach, California (2007), De-Regulation With the Work of Kutluğ Ataman, MuHKA, Belgium (2006), Küba, Artangel (2005), Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney (2005), Long Streams, Serpentine Gallery, London and Nikolaj, Copenhagen Contemporary Art Centre, Denmark (2002).

His art works are in major international collections, including MoMA, New York, Tate Modern, London n, Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary, Vienna, the Dimitris Daskalopoulos Collection, Athens, Istanbul Modern, Istanbul and the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh.

Mesopotamian Dramaturgies – a multi-element work was exhibited in Linz as part of European Capital of Culture 2009, and subsequently at the Ludwig Museum in Cologne before its showing at MAXXI in Rome in 2010 and ARTER in Istanbul in 2011. Ataman&#x27;s works were also in exhibitions in Istanbul, Basel, Lille, Milan, Gothenburg, Paris, and Malmö through 2009, in Istanbul, São Paulo, Berlin, Vienna, Sydney and London in 2010 and Istanbul, Bilbao, Brighton and London in 2011. In April 2009 Kutluğ Ataman was the Chair of the Jury of the International Istanbul Film Festival.

A full-length documentary film directed by Metin Çavuş about Ataman&#x27;s art career was issued at the end of 2011. In 2012 Ataman released Sılsel, a “timeline” made out of artworks contributed by viewers for the Istanbul International Theatre Festival. One attached to the other, the contributions formed a “timeline” that created an interactive “sky” containing messages from the viewers for the future while also defining the times in which the artwork was created.

In 2013 Ataman made a public announcement that he needed a clean break from his film and art practice in order to be able to concentrate on “the next chapter”. Since then, he delivered only The Portrait of Sakıp Sabancı in 2014, a large video sculpture made out of nearly ten thousand LED screens. The work was exhibited at the Venice Biennial main show in 2015 and at The Royal Academy, London in 2016.

In 2014, Ataman released a new feature film called The Lamb which premiered at Berlinale&#x27;s Panorama Special. The film won numerous awards internationally, as well as Best Film, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress in Antalya Film Festival.

In 2015, Kutluğ Ataman initiated Palanga Art and Architecture Farm (PAAF) at a ranch he established in the mountains of Erzincan, Turkey. While declaring the ranch as “a living land art”, he is pioneering environmentally respectful and responsible holistic farming methods in Turkey. Adopting the slogan “from agriculture to culture”, he has commissioned several architectural projects by both new and well established architects. Since 2016, Palanga&#x27;s various buildings have won numerous international architecture awards for innovation and experimentation. In 2019 he was selected “Employer of the Year 2019” by Arkitera.

Presently, Ataman is working for his new feature film Hilal, Feza, And Other Planets that will be out in 2022. The project won many awards during the work in progress, including Eurimages Award for the scenario from Rome Film Festival, ARTE Award for the scenario from Sarajevo Film Festival, Cinefoundation Atelier selection from Cannes Film Festival and Turkish-German Co-Production Development Fund Award from Istanbul Film Festival.

He recently showed &quot;Küba&quot; at the inaugural exhibition of NEON, Athens. &quot;Küba&quot; will open at Reina Sofia, Madrid as part of Thyssen Bornemisza&#x27;s contemporary art collection. Ataman recently joined Niru Ratnam Gallery, London where he will be exhibiting new works in 2022. His present concentration is large scale sculpture, land art, photography and video art.

<doc id="1220636" wikidata="Q953820" url="?curid=1220636" title="Jeremy Deller">
<text>Jeremy Deller (born 30 March 1966) is an English conceptual, video and installation artist. Much of Deller&#x27;s work is collaborative; it has a strong political aspect, in the subjects dealt with and also the devaluation of artistic ego through the involvement of other people in the creative process. He won the Turner Prize in 2004 and represented Great Britain at the Venice Biennale in 2013.

==Early life and education==
Jeremy Deller was born in London and educated at St John&#x27;s and St Clement&#x27;s Primary School and Dulwich College before studying for his BA History of Art at Courtauld Institute of Art (University of London); he achieved his MA in Art History at the University of Sussex under David Alan Mellor.

==Work==

Deller traces his broad interests in art and culture, in part, to childhood visits to museums like the Horniman Museum, in South London. After meeting Andy Warhol in 1986, Deller spent two weeks at The Factory in New York. He began making artworks in the early 1990s, often showing them outside of conventional galleries. In 1993, while his parents were on holiday (he was 27, still living at home), he secretly used the family home for an exhibition titled Open Bedroom.

In 1997, Deller embarked on Acid Brass, a musical collaboration with the Williams Fairey Brass Band from Stockport. The project was based on fusing the music of a traditional brass band with acid house and Detroit techno.

Much of Deller&#x27;s work is collaborative. His work has a strong political aspect, in the subjects dealt with and also the devaluation of artistic ego through the involvement of other people in the creative process. &quot;Folk Archive&quot; is a tour of &quot;people&#x27;s art&quot; and has been exhibited throughout the UK including at Barbican Centre and most recently (2013) at The Public, West Bromwich, outside of the contemporary art institution. Much of his work is ephemeral in nature and avoids commodification.

Deller staged &quot;The Battle of Orgreave&quot; in 2001, bringing together almost 1,000 people in a public re-enactment of a violent confrontation from the 1984 Miners&#x27; Strike. The re-enactment was filmed by director Mike Figgis for Artangel Media and Channel 4. &quot;The Battle of Orgreave&quot; was ranked second in &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Best Art of the 21st Century list, with critic Hettie Judah calling it a &quot;monument of sorts, the performance was at once participatory ritual, spectacle, living archive and a space to mourn&quot;. In 2004, for the opening of Manifesta 5, the roving European Biennial of Contemporary art, Deller organised a &quot;Social Parade&quot; through the streets of the city of Donostia-San Sebastian, drafting in cadres of local alternative societies and support groups to participate.

In 2005/6, he was involved in a touring exhibit of contemporary British folk art, in collaboration with Alan Kane. In late 2006, he instigated The Bat House Project, an architectural competition open to the public for a bat house on the outskirts of London.

The following year, &#x27;Our Hobby is Depeche Mode&#x27;, a documentary co-directed with Nick Abrahams about Depeche Mode fans around the world was premiered at the London Film Festival, and followed by festival screenings around the world.

In 2009, Deller created Procession, a free and uniquely Mancunian parade through the centre of Manchester along Deansgate, a co-commission by Manchester International Festival and Cornerhouse. &quot;Procession&quot; worked with diverse groups of people drawn from the 10 boroughs of Greater Manchester and took place on Sunday 5 July at 1400 hrs.

Commissioned in 2009 as part of The Three M Project (a group composed of the New Museum, New York; the Hammer Museum, LA; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, to exhibit and commission new works of art), Deller created &quot;It Is What It Is&#x27;. The project was designed to foster public discussion by having guest experts engage museum visitors in a free-form, unscripted dialogue about issues concerning Iraq.

In 2015 the exhibition &quot;The Infinitely Variable Ideal of the Popular&quot; was presented at MUAC in Mexico City, curated by Ferran Barenblit, Amanda de la Garza and Cuauhtémoc Medina. The exhibition traveled to Fundación Proa in Buenos Aires and Alhóndiga in Bilbao. 

&quot;Sacrilege&quot;, a 1:1 bouncy replica of Stonehenge created for the 2012 Olympic Games was toured around the UK and eventually to Móstoles, Community of Madrid, in 2015. Charlotte Higgins, of The Guardian, noted that a megalithic bouncy by artist Jim Ricks had toured Ireland a few years previously, and wrote: &quot;Why, after several millennia of human creativity, have two inflatable megalithic monuments come along at once?&quot; Despite claims of plagiarism, the two works were shown together in Belfast in the summer of 2012.

On 1 July 2016, his &quot;We&#x27;re Here Because We&#x27;re Here&quot;, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme, took place in public spaces across the United Kingdom. On 29 June 2017, his event &quot;What Is The City But The People?&quot; opened the Manchester International Festival.

In 2019 the Jewish Museum London commissioned Deller to create a short film of antisemitic footage showing contemporary media, politicians, and propagandists making antisemitic statements for its special exhibit Jews, Money, Myth. Douglas Murray called the film&#x27;s use of clips of U.S. President Donald Trump criticizing &#x27;elites&#x27; for draining power from America &quot;an unfair overclaim.&quot;

Deller produced the documentary &quot;Everybody in The Place: An Incomplete History of Britain 1984–1992&quot; which covered acid house and rave culture, and political turmoil in Britain in the 1980s and early-1990s, first shown by BBC Four on 2 August 2019.

Later the same year, Deller was forced to admit that his design for the memorial to the Peterloo Massacre, intended to provide a podium for speakers and a monument to equality campaigners, had completely failed to make any provision for wheelchair users, despite corporate artwork prominently featuring wheelchair users and even though access had been raised during the consultation process. Protests by disabled groups led to a last minute redesign and Deller describing himself as &quot;chastened&quot;.

In June 2024, Deller brought Acid Brass to the streets of Melbourne, as part of the 2024 RISING: festival, with local brass bands including Merri-bek City Band, Glenferrie Brass, Victorian State Youth Brass Band, Dandenong Band, and Western Brass. 

==Other roles==
In 2007, Deller was appointed a Trustee of the Tate Gallery. Between 2012 and 2013, he served on the board of trustees of the Foundling Museum.

In December 2020 Deller was part of the winning team from the Courtauld Institute of Art in &quot;Christmas University Challenge&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==
Deller was the winner of the Turner Prize in 2004. His show at Tate Britain included documentation on &quot;Battle of Orgreave&quot; and an installation &quot;Memory Bucket&quot; (2003), a documentary about Crawford, Texas—the hometown of George W. Bush—and the siege in nearby Waco.

In 2010, he was awarded the Albert Medal of the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce (RSA) for &#x27;creating art that encourages public responses and creativity&#x27;.

&quot;The Battle of Orgreave&quot; ranked second in &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s list of the best art of the 21st century.

==Political views==
On 1 October 2010, in an open letter to the British Government&#x27;s culture secretary Jeremy Hunt, co-signed by 28 former Turner prize nominees, and 18 winners, Deller opposed any future cuts in public funding for the arts. In the letter the co-signatories described the arts in Britain as a &quot;remarkable and fertile landscape of culture and creativity&quot;.

In August 2014, Deller was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

During the 2017 general election campaign he created a poster bearing the words &quot;Strong and stable my arse&quot;, referring to Theresa May&#x27;s election slogan, copies of which were publicly posted around London.

<doc id="1220637" wikidata="Q272613" url="?curid=1220637" title="Billie Whitelaw">
<text>Billie Honor Whitelaw (6 June 1932 – 21 December 2014) was an English actress. She worked in close collaboration with Irish playwright Samuel Beckett for 25 years and was regarded as one of the foremost interpreters of his works. She was also known for her portrayal of Mrs. Baylock, the demonic nanny in the 1976 horror film &quot;The Omen&quot;.

Whitelaw was nominated for three Television BAFTAs, winning two in 1961 and 1973. She was also nominated for four Film BAFTAs, winning the Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for both &quot;Charlie Bubbles&quot; and &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot; in 1969.

==Early life==
Whitelaw was born on 6 June 1932 in Coventry, Warwickshire, the daughter of Frances Mary (née Williams) and Gerry Whitelaw. She had one sister, Constance, who was 10 years older. Whitelaw grew up in a working class part of Bradford and later attended Grange Girls&#x27; Grammar School in Bradford.

At age 11, she began performing as a child actress on radio programmes, including the part of Bunkle, an extrovert prep-schoolboy on Children&#x27;s Hour from Manchester, and later worked as an assistant stage manager and acted with the repertory company at the Prince&#x27;s Theatre in Bradford during high school. Her father died of lung cancer when Billie was 9 years old. Money was tight and her mother struggled to support the family. &quot;It&#x27;s something I haven&#x27;t come to terms with ... I&#x27;m rather ashamed of having the good life I have&quot;, she later recalled.

At the age of sixteen, Whitelaw met the director Joan Littlewood at the BBC in Manchester and was invited to join her Theatre Workshop troupe. She was encouraged by her mother to join Harry Hanson&#x27;s Leeds company in 1948 and then went on to play in repertory theatres in Dewsbury, New Brighton in Liverpool and Oxford, eventually making her London debut in 1950.

==Film career==
Whitelaw made her film debut in &quot;The Sleeping Tiger&quot; (1954), followed by roles in &quot;Carve Her Name with Pride&quot; (1958) and &quot;Hell Is a City&quot; (1960). Whitelaw soon became a regular in British films of the 1950s and early 1960s. In her early film work, she specialised in blousy blondes and secretaries, but her dramatic range began to emerge by the late 1960s. She starred with Albert Finney in &quot;Charlie Bubbles&quot; (1967), a performance which won her a BAFTA award as Best Actress in a Supporting Role. She would win her second BAFTA as the sensuous mother of college student Hayley Mills in the psychological study &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot; (1969). She continued in film roles including &quot;Leo the Last&quot; (1970), &quot;Start the Revolution Without Me&quot; (1970), &quot;Gumshoe&quot; (1971) and the Alfred Hitchcock thriller &quot;Frenzy&quot; (1972).

Whitelaw gained international acclaim for her chilling role as Mrs Baylock, the evil guardian of the demon child Damien in &quot;The Omen&quot; (1976). Her performance was considered one of the more memorable of the film, winning her the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; British Film Award for Best Actress. Other films included performing the voice of Aughra in &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;, as the hopelessly naive Mrs. Hall in &quot;Maurice&quot; (1987), one of two sisters, with Joan Plowright, struggling to survive in war-time Liverpool in &quot;The Dressmaker&quot; (1988), the fiercely domineering and protective mother of psychopathic twin murderers in &quot;The Krays&quot; (1990), a performance that earned her a BAFTA nomination, as the nurse Grace Poole in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1996) and the blind laundress in &quot;Quills&quot; (2000). She returned to film, in a comedy turn, as Joyce Cooper in &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot; (2007).

In 1970, she was a member of the jury at the 20th Berlin International Film Festival.

==Theatre and Beckett==
In 1963, Billie Whitelaw met Irish playwright Samuel Beckett. She and Beckett enjoyed an intense professional relationship until his death in 1989. He wrote many of his more experimental plays especially for her, referring to Whitelaw as &quot;a perfect actress&quot;. Whitelaw became Beckett&#x27;s muse, as he created, reworked and revised each play while she physically, at times to the point of total exhaustion, acted each movement.

Whitelaw remained the foremost interpreter of the man and his work. She gave lectures on the Beckettian technique and explained: &quot;He used me as a piece of plaster he was moulding until he got just the right shape&quot;. They collaborated on Beckett plays such as &quot;Play&quot;, &quot;Eh Joe&quot;, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;Not I&quot;, &quot;Footfalls&quot; and &quot;Rockaby&quot; for both stage and screen. For her performance in &quot;Rockaby&quot; Whitelaw was nominated for a Drama Desk Award.

From 1964 to 1966, she was a member of Britain&#x27;s National Theatre Company. In 1965, she took over the part of Desdemona opposite Laurence Olivier&#x27;s Othello from Maggie Smith.

==Television career==
Whitelaw also appeared frequently on television and won acclaim for her work. A very early TV appearance was in the first series of the long-running BBC1 police series &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot; (1955), as Mary Dixon, daughter of George (Jack Warner). She also appeared as a woman who tries to join Robin Hood&#x27;s outlaw band in a 1957 episode of &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, &quot;The Bride of Robin Hood&quot; and won a BAFTA award as Best Actress for her performance in &quot;The Sextet&quot; (1972). She starred on the 1958–59 sitcom &quot;Time Out for Peggy&quot;. She also appeared in an episode of &quot;Wicked Women&quot; (1970), the BBC adaptation of Thomas Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Wessex Tales&quot; (1973), &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; (1980), &quot;Private Schulz&quot; (1982), &quot;A Murder of Quality&quot; (1991), &quot;Duel of Hearts&quot; (1991), &quot;Firm Friends&quot; (1992–1994) with Madhur Jaffrey, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1996), &quot;Born to Run&quot; (1997), &quot;Merlin&quot; (1998) and &quot;A Dinner of Herbs&quot; (2000).

==Personal life and death==
Whitelaw was married to the actor Peter Vaughan from 1952 to 1966. She later married the writer and drama critic Robert Muller. The couple had a son together. Muller died in 1998.

Having divided her time between a home in Hampstead, north London and a cottage near Glemsford in Suffolk, Whitelaw spent the last four years of her life as a resident of Denville Hall, the actors&#x27; retirement and nursing home in Northwood, Hillingdon. She died there aged 82, following a bout of pneumonia on 21 December 2014.

&quot;Billie Whitelaw...Who He? An Autobiography&quot;, was published by St Martin&#x27;s Press in 1995.

==Honours==
Whitelaw was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in the 1991 Birthday Honours.

<text>Primitive Radio Gods is an American alternative rock band from Southern California. Current members consist of frontman Chris O&#x27;Connor, who performs vocals and bass guitar; percussionist Tim Lauterio; and Luke McAuliffe, who contributes various additional instrumentation (guitars, violins, piano) as well as much of the art that has appeared on the band&#x27;s albums and website. Former member Jeff Sparks wrote, sang, and played bass before leaving the band to pursue other music projects in 2001.

The band is best known for their 1996 hit &quot;Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand&quot;, which peaked No. 1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.

==History==
===Early years (1991–1994)===
The history of the Primitive Radio Gods begins with The I-Rails. Formed in the late 1980s, The I-Rails were an independent alternative rock band based in Oxnard, California. Consisting of three members, bassist and singer Chris O&#x27;Connor, guitarist Jeff Sparks (a childhood friend of O&#x27;Connor), and drummer Tim Lauterio, The I-Rails released a total of four albums, none of which received much public attention. After the fourth album, &quot;Panharmonium&quot;, was released in 1990 and similarly ignored, the band decided to split. While Sparks and Lauterio went on to pursue other potential careers, O&#x27;Connor continued to work with material originally intended for a fifth I-Rails album. Inspired by bands such as Public Enemy, O&#x27;Connor recorded additional material and ultimately mixed a total of ten tracks. After mastering, O&#x27;Connor released the demo to public music stations under the (misspelled) moniker &quot;Primative Radio Gods&quot;, a song on the I-Rails album &quot;Nine Songs from Nowhere&quot;.

<doc id="1220646" wikidata="Q6486180" url="?curid=1220646" title="Langlands &amp; Bell">
<text>Langlands &amp; Bell are two artists who work collaboratively. Ben Langlands (born London 1955) and Nikki Bell (born London 1959), began collaborating in 1978, while studying Fine Art at Middlesex Polytechnic in North London, from 1977 to 1980.

==Artistic practice and career==

Their artistic practice ranges from sculpture, film and video, to innovative digital media projects, art installations and full-scale architecture. Their work focuses on the complex web of relationships linking people with architecture and the built environment, and on a wider global level, the coded systems of mass-communications and exchange we use to negotiate an increasingly fast-changing technological world.

Their first collaboration, in 1978, was an installation called &quot;The Kitchen&quot;, consisting of two side-by-side kitchens, one created by Langlands and the other by Bell.

In the mid-1980s, they became known for making monochromatic sculptures and reliefs, often in the form of furniture or architectural models, which employed an analytical and almost archeological approach to architecture and design typologies to explore human relationships from the personal, to the cultural, economic and political.

Langlands &amp; Bell have exhibited internationally throughout their career including in exhibitions at Tate Britain and Tate Modern, the Imperial War Museum, the Serpentine Gallery, and the Whitechapel Art Gallery in London, at IMMA, Dublin, Kunsthalle Bielefeld, Germany, MoMA, New York, the Central House of the Artist, Moscow, the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, Venice Biennale, Seoul Biennale, and CCA Kitakyushu and TN Probe, Tokyo, Japan.

Their work was first purchased by Charles Saatchi in 1990 and 1991 from exhibitions at Maureen Paley Interim Art, London. It was subsequently exhibited in the first of the Young British Artists exhibitions at the Saatchi Collection, Boundary Road in 1992, and again in the 1997 Sensation exhibition at the Royal Academy in London. Sensation toured to the Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin and the Brooklyn Museum, New York in 1998/99.

In 1996–1997, a major survey exhibition Langlands &amp; Bell Works 1986–1996 co-curated by the Serpentine Gallery, London, and Kunsthalle Bielefeld, Germany also toured to Cantieri Culturali alla Zisa, Palermo, Italy, and Koldo Mitxelena, San Sebastián, Spain.

In 2002, Langlands &amp; Bell were commissioned by the Art Commissions Committee of the Department of Art at the Imperial War Museum, London, to travel to Afghanistan to research &quot;The Aftermath of September 11 and the War in Afghanistan&quot;.

In 2004, they won a British Academy of Film &amp; Television Arts award for Interactive Arts Installation for &quot;The House of Osama bin Laden&quot;, the trilogy of art works resulting from their visit. The group of works includes an interactive computer animation examining the house near Jalalabad occupied by Osama bin Laden in the late 1990s. In 2004 Langlands &amp; Bell were also short-listed for the Turner Prize for the same work. A few days before the exhibition opened, the film &quot;Zardad&#x27;s Dog&quot;, which constituted a third of their presentation, was withdrawn due to legal advice received by Tate that it was sub-judice because of the impending trial of Faryadi Sarwar Zardad, an Afghan former warlord at the Old Bailey.

The largest artworks to date by Langlands &amp; Bell are, the 2004 Paddington Basin Bridge, designed in association with Atelier One (structural engineers), an 8-metre high x 45-metre long white metal and glass pedestrian bridge linking Paddington station and the new Paddington Basin Development, London, with a capacity of up to 20,000 people per day; &quot;Moving World (Night &amp; Day)&quot; (2007) — two 6 x 18-metre permanent outdoor sculptures of steel, glass, and digitally controlled neon at Heathrow Terminal 5; and &quot;China, Language of Places&quot; (2009), the 18-metre wall painting exhibited in English Lounge at Tang Contemporary Art, 798, Beijing in 2009.

Artworks by Langlands &amp; Bell are in the permanent collections of many prominent international art museums including the British Museum, the Imperial War Museum, Tate and the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London; MoMA, New York; the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; the Yale Center for British Art, USA; and the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, Russia.

In 2012, to go alongside the AKA Peace Exhibition at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, Art Below showcased selected works from the AKA Peace series on the London Underground including Langlands &amp; Bell&#x27;s &#x27;Sign of the Times&#x27; 2021. &quot;AKA Peace&quot; originally conceived by photographer Bran Symondson and now curated by artist Jake Chapman, was an exhibition of new works made specially for The Peace One Day Project 2012, bringing together a group of Contemporary Artists, all of whom agreed to transform a decommissioned AK-47 assault rifle, refashioning them into artworks.

In 2016 Langlands &amp; Bell completed the art installation &quot;Beauty &lt; Immortality&quot;, a permanent memorial to Frank Pick at Piccadilly Circus Underground station in London that was commissioned by London Transport Museum and Art on the Underground. 

Recent solo exhibitions by Langlands &amp; Bell include, &quot;Infinite Loop&quot; at Alan Cristea Gallery, London (2017), &quot;Internet Giants: Masters of the Universe&quot;, Ikon Gallery, Birmingham (2018), &quot;Degrees of Truth&quot;, Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum, London (2020), and &quot;Curators Signatures&quot;, CCA Kitakyushu, Japan 2020, &quot;The Past is Never Dead…&quot; Gallery 1957, Accra, Ghana (2021).

From April to September 2022 Langlands &amp; Bell will present 3 exhibitions, &quot;Near Heaven&quot;, &quot;Ideas of Utopia&quot;, and &quot;Absent Artists&quot;, at Charleston, the former East Sussex home of the Bloomsbury Group artists Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant.

==Personal lives==
Langlands &amp; Bell live in a four-storey Georgian house in Whitechapel, East London, which they bought as a ruin in 1982. They took 18 months out of their careers between 1987 and 1989 to renovate the house and expand their workspace. Since 2010 they have divided their time between Whitechapel and &quot;Untitled&quot; in Kent, the modern off-grid house and studio they designed themselves with structural engineers Atelier One.

<doc id="1220649" wikidata="Q2721181" url="?curid=1220649" title="Delibird">
<text>Delibird (; Japanese: ), is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise. Delibird first appeared in the video games &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; and most of its subsequent sequels. Designed by Game Freak&#x27;s development team and finalized by Ken Sugimori, it has also appeared in various spin-off titles, such as &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot;, and animated adaptations of the franchise. Delibird is a penguin-like, Santa Claus-inspired Pokémon with a tail that resembles a sack. In the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime, Delibird has been voiced by SungWon Cho and Katsuyuki Konishi for the English and Japanese dubs, respectively.

Following its debut, Delibird had a mixed reception. Its weakness in battle, owed partially to the unreliability of its &quot;Present&quot; move, was universally criticized. Reactions to its design were more split, with some believing Delibird to have an endearing appearance, while others described its appearance as off-putting and criticized its sack-like tail as an odd design choice. Iron Bundle, a robotic Pokémon directly inspired by Delibird, became well-known for its high level of combat power, dwarfing its inspiration.

==Conception and design==
Delibird is a species of fictional creatures called Pokémon created for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Japanese franchise began in 1996 with the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; for the Game Boy, which were later released in North America as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in 1998. In these games and their sequels, the player assumes the role of a Trainer whose goal is to capture and use the creatures&#x27; special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Some Pokémon can transform into stronger species through evolution via various means, such as exposure to specific items. Each Pokémon has one or two elemental types, which define its advantages and disadvantages when battling other Pokémon. A major goal in each game is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading with other Trainers to obtain individuals from all Pokémon species.

Delibird was first introduced in &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;. When developing the games, around 300 individual Pokémon designs were drafted by various development team members, with each deciding their names and features and revising the drafts as needed. During this process, the team actively tried to avoid vague design concepts, as they felt this had caused difficulty creating completed Pokémon during the development of &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. As the team selected which Pokémon would be included, they were drawn and finalized by lead artist Ken Sugimori. To maintain balance, however, many of the newer species did not appear in the early stages of the game. Additionally, many of the Pokémon were designed with merchandise in mind, taking into account the related &quot;Pokémon&quot; toy line and anime series. As a result designs often had to be kept simplistic, something that caused strain for Sugimori and affected his approach to the next &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise titles, &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;.

Delibird is a red and white penguin Pokémon with a tail resembling a gift sack, standing at 2 ft 11 in (90 cm) tall. Described as the &quot;Delivery Pokémon&quot;, it likes to deliver letters and presents that it stores in its tail across the Pokémon world. Delibird are also capable of flight, despite penguins being flightless birds. They also like to store food in their tails, which Delibird hand out to travelers who they believe are lost. They prefer colder climates, nesting on the edge of sharp cliffs, although they can withstand significantly warmer locations. Due its colour scheme, sack-like tail and gift delivery, Delibird is likely inspired by Santa Claus. Its name is a combination of &quot;delivery&quot; and &quot;bird&quot;. On its own, Delibird is capable of learning two moves naturally. One of these is its signature move, Present. When in battle, using this move leads to Delibird pulling out a present and lobbing it at an opponent, dealing a light, medium or heavy amount of damage at random. Sometimes, this move is capable of healing the opponent rather than dealing damage to them.

==Appearances==
Delibird made their debut appearance in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series as one of one hundred new Pokémon added in the 1999 video game &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, which is set in the Johto region. It is classified as an Ice- and Flying-type Pokémon with only one stage, meaning it has no pre-evolutions and is not known to evolve. They have since gone on to appear in several games in the series such as &quot;Pokémon X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot;. A Paradox Pokémon heavily resembling Delibird appears in &quot;Pokémon Scarlet&quot; and &quot;Violet&quot;. Iron Bundle is a robotic version of Delibird holding a water cannon instead of a sack. In the same game, a series of shops are spread across the Paldea region called &quot;Delibird Presents&quot;, which specializes in selling items for battles and merchandise.

Delibird has appeared in various spin-off video games. &quot;Pokémon Stadium 2&quot; features a minigame called &quot;Delibird&#x27;s Delivery&quot;, where each player controls a Delibird that must collect and deliver presents. It was introduced to &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; in December of 2017, with the Pokémon only reappearing in exclusive holiday events. It has also made appearances in &quot;New Pokémon Snap&quot;, &quot;Pokémon Masters EX&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon Sleep&quot;. Delibird has also made multiple appearances in other Pokémon-related media; appearing in the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;, multiple episodes of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime, in one of many shorts from the Pichu &amp; Pikachu&#x27;s Winter Vacation 2001 collection, as well as in &quot;Pokémon the Movie: The Power of Us&quot;. In the anime it is voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi in Japanese, and in English by SungWon Cho.

==Reception==

Delibird has received a generally negative reception. Robert Grosso from &quot;TechRaptor&quot;, stated &quot;It&#x27;s hard to find a starting point as to why Delibird simply fails as a design&quot;, finding the character&#x27;s core appearance of a penguin combined with Santa Claus imagery to be &quot;off putting&quot;. Moreso however he criticized how it appeared to be built around the singular Present move, and that attack&#x27;s randomness combined with its unreliability further hampered Delibird even in casual gameplay, making it &quot;a poor Pokémon on all fronts&quot;. Devin Ellis Friend, writing for &quot;Screen Rant&quot;, called Delibird &quot;a complete joke&quot; since its introduction, attributing it to its lack of an evolution and how its typing weaknesses made the Pokémon &quot;one of the worst single-stage Pokémon in the series&quot;. While describing it as a &quot;cute Santa penguin&quot;, &quot;GamesRadar+&quot;″s Jordan Gerblick nevertheless asserted that Delibird was &quot;the butt of the joke in the Pokémon community&quot;. He was surprised that Iron Bundle, a robotic Pokémon based directly on Delibird, was so much stronger than the original that it had been banned from several fan-made competitive Pokémon battling scenes such as Smogon. Friend similarly commented on the contrast between Delibird and Iron Bundle, describing the power gap as &quot;almost comical in its scale&quot;.

Conversely, &quot;Screen Rant&quot;″s Jack O&#x27;Keeffe described Delibird as &quot;the gambler&#x27;s Pokémon&quot;. He believed that Present&#x27;s random nature made the Pokémon a fun addition to a player&#x27;s team and that it could add &quot;drama and suspense&quot; to more boring Pokémon battles. &quot;TheGamer&quot;″s Joshua Robertson expressed sadness at the community overlooking Delibird, stating that it went against the Pokémon&#x27;s purpose to spread cheer for Christmas. Eva Padilla of &quot;RPGFan&quot; commented on their podcast how unusual and &quot;strange&quot; Delibird was due to its abilities and how much it stood out amongst the game&#x27;s roster as a result. She attributed that such characters were bound to be made in casts as large as Pokémon&#x27;s, to which the other website staff agreed. In an article for &quot;Kotaku&quot;, Gita Robinson reported on a player who found a creative use for Delibird in one of the series&#x27; recurring minigames, finding that due to its design and gameplay, it was inherently well adapted for such events compared to battling.

Due to the tail&#x27;s design, it has often led many in the Pokémon community to believe it was just a sack separate from its body, with some exclaiming it took them years to correct the misconception. Robertson called it a &quot;cute little penguin&quot;, but &quot;TheGamer&quot;″s Editor in Chief, Stacey Henley, expressed disgust at the design of Delibird&#x27;s sack like-tail. She commented on Delibird&#x27;s nature of storing food in its tail and handing it out to passers-by, describing the act as gross. Additionally, she noted on the fact that Delibird often creates the presents it hands out to people from its tail, calling this aspect weird and equating the presents to its droppings. Henley was also particularly critical of Delibird&#x27;s overall design. She felt that because Delibird is based on penguins, it should not be described as a Christmas Pokémon, denying Delibird the title outright. Instead of Delibird, she chose Pokémon Stantler and Fletchling; Pokémon based on reindeers and robins respectively, which she claims are animals more commonly associated with Christmas.

Starting in 2013, following the release of &quot;Pokémon X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, many Pokémon players founded Operation Delibird, a campaign where they would trade rare Pokémon to others on Christmas and Boxing Day. The campaign was created to fight back against negativity in the community as well as a previously similar troll campaign involving the Pokémon Zubat. The decision to choose Delibird as the face of the campaign was due to its association with Christmas and giving gifts to others.

In 2020, a collaborative marketing campaign between The Pokémon Company and Japanese food delivery service menu, called &quot;Pokémon Delivery&quot;, was introduced and featured Delibird as its mascot due to its association with delivering gifts.

<text>Yinka Shonibare (born 9 August 1962), is a British artist living in the United Kingdom. His work explores cultural identity, colonialism and post-colonialism within the contemporary context of globalisation. A hallmark of his art is the brightly coloured Ankara fabric he uses. As Shonibare is paralysed on one side of his body, he uses assistants to make works under his direction.

==Early life and education==

Yinka Shonibare was born in London, England, on 9 August 1962, the son of Olatunji Shonibare and Laide Shonibare. When he was three years old, his family moved to Lagos, Nigeria, where his father practised law. When he was 17 years old, Shonibare returned to the UK to take his A-levels at Redrice School. At the age of 18, he contracted transverse myelitis, an inflammation of the spinal cord, which resulted in a long-term physical disability where one side of his body is paralysed.

Shonibare studied Fine Art first at Byam Shaw School of Art (now Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design) and then at Goldsmiths, University of London, where he received his MFA degree, graduating as part of the Young British Artists generation. Following his studies, Shonibare worked as an arts development officer for Shape Arts, an organisation that makes arts accessible to people with disabilities.

== Career ==
In 1999, Shonibare created four alien-like sculptures that he named &quot;Dysfunctional Family&quot;, the piece consisting of a mother and daughter, both coloured in textures of white and blue, and a father and son textured in the colours of red and yellow.

He has exhibited at the Venice Biennial and at leading museums worldwide. He was notably commissioned by Okwui Enwezor at documenta XI in 2002 to create his most recognised work, &quot;Gallantry and Criminal Conversation&quot;, which launched him on the international stage.

In 2004, he was shortlisted for the Turner Prize for his &quot;Double Dutch&quot; exhibition at the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen in Rotterdam and for his solo show at the Stephen Friedman Gallery, London. Of the four nominees, he seemed to be the most popular with the general public that year, with a BBC website poll resulting in 64 per cent of voters stating that his work was their favourite.

Shonibare became an Honorary Fellow of Goldsmiths&#x27; College in 2003, was awarded an MBE in 2004, received an Honorary Doctorate (Fine Artist) of the Royal College of Art in 2010 and was appointed a CBE in 2019. He was elected Royal Academician by the Royal Academy of Arts in 2013. He joined Iniva&#x27;s Board of trustees in 2009. He has exhibited at the Venice Biennial and internationally at leading museums worldwide. In September 2008, his major mid-career survey commenced at the MCA Sydney and toured to the Brooklyn Museum, New York, in June 2009 and the National Museum of African Art of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC, in October 2009. In 2010, &quot;Nelson&#x27;s Ship in a Bottle&quot; became his first public art commission on the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square.

On 3 December 2016, one of Shonibare&#x27;s &quot;Wind Sculpture&quot; pieces was installed in front of the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of African Art (NMAA) in Washington, DC. The painted fibreglass work, titled &quot;Wind Sculpture VII&quot;, is the first sculpture to be permanently installed outside the NMAA&#x27;s entrance.

He runs &quot;Guest Projects&quot;, a project space for emerging artists based in Broadway Market, east London. He is extending this to spaces in Lagos, Nigeria.

In 2023 his first work of public art was unveiled in Leeds. Entitled Hibiscus Rising, it commemorates the life and death of David Oluwale, a Nigerian homeless man persecuted by Leeds City Police.

== Work ==

Shonibare&#x27;s work explores issues of colonialism alongside those of race and class, through a range of media which include painting, sculpture, photography, installation art, and, more recently, film and performance. He examines, in particular, the construction of identity and tangled interrelationship between Africa and Europe and their respective economic and political histories. Mining Western art history and literature, he asks what constitutes our collective contemporary identity today. Having described himself as a &quot;post-colonial&quot; hybrid, Shonibare questions the meaning of cultural and national definitions. While he often makes work inspired by his own life and experiences around him, he takes inspiration from around the world; as he has said: &quot;I&#x27;m a citizen of the world, I watch television so I make work about these things.&quot;

A key material in Shonibare&#x27;s work since 1994 is the brightly coloured &quot;African&quot; fabric (African wax-printed cotton) that he buys himself from Brixton market in London. &quot;But actually, the fabrics are not really authentically African the way people think,&quot; says Shonibare. &quot;They prove to have a crossbred cultural background quite of their own. And it&#x27;s the fallacy of that signification that I like. It&#x27;s the way I view culture – it&#x27;s an artificial construct.&quot; Shonibare claims that the fabrics were first manufactured in Europe to sell in Indonesian markets and were then sold in Africa after being rejected in Indonesia. Today the main exporters of &quot;African&quot; fabric from Europe are based in Manchester in the UK and Vlisco Véritable Hollandais from Helmond in the Netherlands. Despite being a European invention, the Dutch wax fabric is used by many Africans in England, such as Shonibare. He has these fabrics made up into European 18th-century dresses, covering sculptures of alien figures or stretched onto canvases and thickly painted over.

Shonibare is well known for creating headless, life-size sculptural figures meticulously positioned and dressed in vibrant wax cloth patterns in order for history and racial identity to be made complex and difficult to read. In his 2003 artwork &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot;, Shonibare reconstructs the Berlin Conference of 1884–1885, when European leaders negotiated and arbitrarily divided the continent in order to claim African territories. By exploring colonialism, particularly in this tableaux piece, the purpose of the headless figurines implies the loss of humanity as Shonibare explains: &quot;I wanted to represent these European leaders as mindless in their hunger for what the Belgian King Leopold II called &#x27;a slice of this magnificent African cake. &quot;Scramble for Africa&quot; cannot be read as a &quot;simple satire&quot;, but rather it reveals &quot;the relationship between the artist and the work&quot;. It is also an examination of how history tends to repeat itself. Shonibare states: &quot;When I was making it I was really thinking about American imperialism and the need in the West for resources such as oil and how this pre-empts the annexation of different parts of the world.&quot;

Shonibare&#x27;s &quot;Trumpet Boy&quot;, a permanent acquisition displayed at The Foundling Museum, demonstrates the colourful fabric used in his works. The sculpture was created to fit the theme of &quot;found&quot;, reflecting on the museum&#x27;s heritage, through combining new and existing work with found objects kept for their significance.

He also recreates the paintings of famous artists using headless mannequins with Batik or Ankara textiles instead of European fabrics. He uses these fabrics when depicting European art and fashion to portray a &#x27;culture clash&#x27; and a theme of cultural interaction within postcolonialism. An example of some of these recreations would be &quot;Gainsborough&#x27;s Mr and Mrs Andrews Without Their Heads&quot; (1998) and &quot;Reverend on Ice&quot; (2005) (after &quot;The Rev Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch&quot; by Raeburn).

One artist he recreated multiple works of was Jean Honoré Fragonard. He recreated Fragonard&#x27;s series &quot;The Progress of Love&quot; (1771-1773), which included his works &quot;The Meeting&quot;, &quot;The Pursuit&quot;, &quot;The Love Letter&quot;, and &quot;The Swing&quot;. A unique inclusion within these recreations, was the inclusion of branded fabric. &quot;The Swing (After Fragonard)&quot; (2001) has the woman on the swing wearing an imitation or &#x27;knock-off&#x27; Chanel patterned fabric. The use of this fabric was meant to further explore the themes of post-colonialism, globalism, and cultural interaction that are present throughout much of his work, while also commenting on the consumerism and consumer culture of the modern world and how all of these themes intersect.

Shonibare also takes carefully posed photographs and videos recreating famous British paintings or stories from literature but with himself taking centre stage as an alternative, black British dandy – for example, &quot;A Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; by Hogarth, which Shonibare translates into &quot;Diary of A Victorian Dandy&quot; (1998), or his &quot;Dorian Gray&quot; (2001), named after Oscar Wilde&#x27;s novel &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;.

Considerably larger than a usual ship in a bottle, yet much smaller than the real HMS &quot;Victory&quot;, in fact a 1:30-scale model, Shonibare&#x27;s &quot;Nelson&#x27;s Ship in a Bottle&quot;, was &quot;the first commission on the Fourth Plinth to reflect specifically on the historical symbolism of Trafalgar Square, which commemorates the Battle of Trafalgar, and will link directly with Nelson&#x27;s column.&quot; The work was placed there on 24 May 2010 and remained until 30 January 2012, being widely admired. In 2011, the Art Fund launched a campaign and successfully raised money for the purchase and relocation of the sculpture to the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, where it found its new permanent home.

Other works include printed ceramics, and cloth-covered shoes, upholstery, walls and bowls.

In October 2013, Shonibare took part in &quot;Art Wars&quot; at the Saatchi Gallery curated by Ben Moore. The artist was issued with a stormtrooper helmet, which he transformed into a work of art. Proceeds went to the Missing Tom Fund, set up by Ben Moore to find his brother Tom, who has been missing for more than 10 years. The work was also shown on the Regent&#x27;s Park platform as part of Art Below Regents Park.
The Goodman Gallery announced in 2018 that the Norval Foundation, South Africa&#x27;s newest art museum based in Cape Town, has made a permanent acquisition of Shonibare&#x27;s &quot;Wind Sculpture (SG) III&quot;, making it a first for the African continent. The sculpture will be unveiled in February 2019, increasing the British-Nigerian artist&#x27;s visibility on the continent where he grew up.

Shonibare has collaborated with Bellerby &amp; Co, Globemakers.

== Selected artworks/exhibitions ==
Shonibare&#x27;s first solo exhibition was in 1989 at Byam Shaw Gallery, London. During 2008–09, he was the subject of a major mid-career survey in both Australia and the USA; starting in September 2008 at the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia (MCA), Sydney, and toured to the Brooklyn Museum, New York, in June 2009 and the Museum of African Art at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC, in October 2009. For the 2009 Brooklyn Museum exhibition, he created a site-specific installation titled &quot;Mother and Father Worked Hard So I Can Play&quot; which was on view in several of the museum&#x27;s period rooms. Another site-specific installation, &quot;Party Time—Re-Imagine America: A Centennial Commission&quot; was simultaneously on view at the Newark Museum in Newark, New Jersey, from 1 July 2009, to 3 January 2010, in the dining-room of the museum&#x27;s 1885 Ballantine House.

==Other activities==
* Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa, Member of the Global Council

== Awards ==

* In 2004, Shonibare was granted the title Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). He ironically incorporates the title into his official artistic identity, as he states that it is &quot;better to make an impact from within rather than from without… it&#x27;s the notion of the Trojan horse... you go in unnoticed. And then you wreak havoc.&quot;
*In 2019, Yinka Shonibare was awarded and decorated with the Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).
* Yinka Shonibare received the Whitechapel Gallery Art Icon Award in March 2021. He is the 8th recipient of this award. The award celebrates artists who have made significant contributions to a particular medium.

==Disability==
Shonibare is now disabled, physically incapable of making works himself, and relies upon a team of assistants, operating himself as a conceptual artist.

Shonibare&#x27;s disability has increased with age, resulting in him using an electric wheelchair. In later life, Shonibare has discussed his disability and its role within his work as a creative artist. In 2013, Shonibare was announced as patron of the annual Shape Arts &quot;Open&quot; exhibition where disabled and non-disabled artists are invited to submit work in response to an Open theme.

<text>My Love Is Your Love is the fourth studio album by American singer Whitney Houston, released worldwide on November 17, 1998. The album is one of the best-selling female albums of all time, having been certified four times platinum in both the United States and Europe. As of May 2000, &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; sold over 10 million copies worldwide. It was Houston&#x27;s first studio album in eight years, following &quot;I&#x27;m Your Baby Tonight&quot; (1990) although she had contributed to three movie soundtracks during that period (performing all songs on the soundtrack to &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot;). Musically, &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; is a hip hop and R&amp;B album that is composed of elements of pop, gospel and dance music, produced by musicians such as Whitney Houston herself, Rodney Jerkins, Soulshock &amp; Karlin, Missy Elliott, Wyclef Jean, David Foster, Lauryn Hill, and Babyface.

It is notable for introducing elements of hip hop into Houston&#x27;s work, only sparingly used in her previous material. The album was a hit in Europe, peaking #1 for 6 weeks on European Top 100 Albums, selling over 4.3 million copies. It generated several hit singles: &quot;When You Believe&quot;, a duet with Mariah Carey, which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 71st Academy Awards ceremony; &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, which features Kelly Price and Faith Evans; &quot;It&#x27;s Not Right but It&#x27;s Okay&quot;. The title track &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot;, was certified platinum and became Houston&#x27;s third-best-selling single ever; and &quot;I Learned from the Best&quot;.

&quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; received positive reviews and is regarded as one of her best studio albums. At the 42nd Grammy Awards of 2000, the album received seven nominations, including Best R&amp;B Album and Best R&amp;B Song, twice. Houston won for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance for &quot;It&#x27;s Not Right But It&#x27;s Okay&quot;, her sixth and final Grammy Award.

==Singles==
All five singles released from &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; were successful worldwide. In the United States, they were all top forty &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hits, with three reaching the top five on the chart, selling a total of 3.9 million copies. The album generated two Platinum and two Gold singles, awarded by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1999. In later years, four of the five singles would be re-certified platinum. In the United Kingdom, Houston also had five top forty singles including three top five hits from the album, with a total of 1.09 million copies sold, becoming the eighth best-selling singles artist of 1999. The singles also achieved success in other countries such as Canada, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland.

&quot;When You Believe&quot;, duet with Mariah Carey, was released as the lead single from the album throughout November and December, receiving a commercial release after the album had already been released in all territories. The song debuted at number fifty-one without retail single on the new &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, which had changed to allow airplay-only tracks to enter the chart, the issue date of December 5, 1998. Before release, it led to expectations that the song would be a smash hit due to the star power of two music rivals. However, after the single had released, it managed to peak at number fifteen on the chart, the issue dated January 30, 1999. It reached number thirty-three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B Singles &amp; Tracks chart. &quot;Billboard&quot; was unfavorable towards the single, commenting &quot;Given the potential of these two [Houston and Carey] powerhouse voices, however, the song falls flat with a surprisingly understated and downright disappointing bridge: You wait and wait for the duel of the divas, and it simply never materializes,&quot; but positive of Houston&#x27;s performance; &quot;The genuine story in this track is the return of Houston, who sounds fantasticㅡas clear and confident as ever.&quot; The RIAA certified it Gold for shipments of 500,000 copies on March 24, 1999. Unlike in the United States, the single was a success on the world charts. It reached the top five in the U.K. with 260,000 copies sold, Belgium, France, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the top ten in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, and New Zealand. Thanks to popularity for the song across Europe, it eventually peaked at number two on the Eurochart Hot 100.

The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, was released on December 15, 1998, and features Faith Evans and Kelly Price. The song entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart at number eighty-four on the issue date of December 26, 1998. In its first week when the song was commercially available, it leaped to number twenty-nine, and after six weeks peaked at number two on the Hot 100, making it the first Houston single to peak in the runner-up spot. The song entered the revamped &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B Singles &amp; Tracks chart at number twenty-three with the mark of its seventh week on the chart, the issue date of January 9, 1999. In Its first week of retail release, it reached the number six and the following week topped the chart, becoming her eighth No.1 single on the Hot R&amp;B chart. The single stayed on the summit for seven consecutive weeks from February 13 to March 27, 1999, which was her third longest stay atop this chart behind &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; for eleven weeks and &quot;Exhale (Shoop Shoop)&quot; for eight weeks, and was on the chart for a total of thirty-one weeks. The single sold over 1,400,000 copies in the U.S. alone, becoming the third-best-selling single of 1999, and was certified Platinum by the RIAA on March 2, 1999.

&quot;It&#x27;s Not Right, But It&#x27;s Okay&quot; was released as the third single from the album on February 15, 1999. Before May, it was featured as the B-side of maxi-singles with &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, and charted on the Hot 100 and Hot R&amp;B with its only airplay and sales of maxi-singles. The song appeared firstly at number sixty-four on the Hot R&amp;B Singles &amp; Tracks chart, the issue date of January 9, 1999. It rose higher position of the chart steadily, and eventually reached its peak position, number seven, in its twenty-fourth week on the chart. On the Hot 100 chart, the single debuted at number eighty-seven, the issue date of May 8, 1999, and after the regular-length cassette &amp; CD configurations had hit stores, peaked at number four, selling 522,000 copies in the United States. The RIAA certified it Gold on June 29, 1999. It was also successful in the United Kingdom. The single reached the number three on the singles chart, making it her twelfth top ten hits, and sold over 510,000 units, ranked at number twenty-five in the list of UK&#x27;s best-selling singles in 1999. In Canada, it made rare chart performances, peaking at number three for the regular single and number five for its import single simultaneously on the Canadian SoundScan Singles chart in August 1999. After her European promotion during February in 1999, it was popular in many countries of Europe, reaching the number one in Spain, top twenty in Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, and Sweden. Finally it peaked at number nine on the Eurochart Hot 100.

The title track, &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; was the fourth single from the album on May 31, 1999. It was a massive hit worldwide, becoming another signature song for Whitney. Firstly, the single was released in each country of Europe from June 1999, prior to the United States. Upon release, the song was popular immediately across Europe, and became a bigger hit during her &quot;My Love Is Your Love European Tour.&quot; In the U.K., it went straight to its peak position, number two, on the singles chart, the issue date of July 3, 1999. The single sold 525,000 copies, becoming the twenty-second best-selling single of 1999. In Germany, it peaked at number two and was certified Platinum for shipments of 500,000 copies by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI). It also reached the number two in countries such as Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland. It went to top ten in Belgium, Denmark, France, and Norway. Eventually the single topped the Eurochart Hot 100 for a week, becoming her fourth number one single, and was positioned at number six in the Europe&#x27;s Top Singles list of 1999. In New Zealand, it peaked at number one for a week, which was Houston&#x27;s third number-one single after 1987&#x27;s &quot;I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot; and 1992&#x27;s &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;. Likewise, it was a hit in the United States. The song debuted at number eighty-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in September 1999 and peaked at number four in January 2000, becoming her 22nd top ten hit. In addition, it reached the number two position on the Hot R&amp;B Singles &amp; Tracks chart, spending a total of twenty-nine weeks on the chart. The single sold 1,100,000 copies and was certified Platinum by the RIAA on December 14, 1999. Worldwide it sold over 5 million copies and became her third-best-selling single ever, behind &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)&quot;, with 12 million and 8 million copies sold, respectively.

&quot;I Learned from the Best&quot; became the fifth and final single to be released from the album on November 15, 1999. The song debuted at number eighty-three on the Hot 100 and peaked at number twenty-seven. It reached the number thirteen on the Hot R&amp;B Singles &amp; Tracks.

The single reached the number six in Finland, the number eight in Spain, and the number nineteen in the United Kingdom with 95,000 copies sold. Besides, it went to the top forty in the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland.

===&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music chart===
The songs with various remix versions, released from &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot;, were very popular in dance clubs and smash hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Music chart. Four consecutive singles reached the number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play chartㅡ&quot;It&#x27;s Not Right But It&#x27;s Okay&quot; for three weeks, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; for a week, &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; for two weeks, and &quot;I Learned from the Best&quot; for three weeks.

==Critical reception==
Upon the album&#x27;s debut, the album received positive responses from music critics. Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine commented that &quot;It&#x27;s easily her most consistent album ever—in fact, it&#x27;s her first consistent album&quot;, and praised her mature voice as follows:

Jon Pareles, in his review for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, praised her fully developed voice, too. He stated that her sound was &quot;supple and devout&quot;, comparing Carey&#x27;s fidgetting sound with every phrase in &quot;When You Believe&quot;, and commented &quot;Ms. Houston used to be similarly showy and disjointed, but now her improvisations bring emotional coherence to technical feats.&quot; With expressing his interest about any connections between her troubled marriage and her new materials, commented &quot;Lest anyone draw other conclusions from the songs, the album carries a disclaimer.&quot; Also, he was almost positive about songs such as &quot;It&#x27;s Not Right But It&#x27;s Okay&quot;, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; and &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot;.
In &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s review, the issue dated November 28, 1999, the magazine called the album &quot;A tour de force that showcases her strengths in a wide array of musical genres from pop to R&amp;B to gospel to dance.&quot; The publication also opined: &quot;On an album with writing and production input from a diverse roster of players, Houston keeps it all together with her spectacular voice and singular artistic persona&quot;, declaring the album had &quot;immense crossover potential&quot;

Mark Bautz of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album B+, calling &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; &quot;A schizophrenic album&quot; and &quot;A primer on today&#x27;s hip-hop/R&amp;B scene: the good, the bad.&quot; by reason of the unevenness of the album. He commented &quot;Wyclef Jean&#x27;s gorgeous reggae-tinged title song and three funky cuts by Rodney Jerkins showcase the 35-year-old Whitney Houston in all her creative, soulful maturity. In contrast, a trio of schmaltzy Babyface-produced tunes expose her as merely a gifted interpreter of bland radio-ready fare.&quot;. Similarly, &quot;TIME&quot; praised some new songs, calling the title song &quot;superb&quot; and Houston&#x27;s remake of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s classic &quot;fabulous&quot;, but criticized the old-fashioned songs of the album sharply, commenting &quot;The problem is with the Old Guard: producer David Foster&#x27;s work is dull, and Dianne Warren and Babyface, who both wrote tracks, have better work on their respective resumes.&quot;

Writing for &quot;USA Today&quot; in November 1998, Steve Jones made a favorable comment on almost every song whether it is a ballad with her formula for success or a new styled song produced by hot, young producers who&#x27;ve updated and diversified her sound, stating &quot;There&#x27;s something here for just about everybody, whether you favor R&amp;B, pop or adult contemporary radio.&quot; But he chose the remake &quot;I Was Made To Love Him&quot; as the best track of the album, complimenting the song highly, &quot;The rollicking, gender-flipping remake&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic, who gave the album four out of five stars, called it &quot;easily ranks among her best&quot; and complimented the musical diversity &quot;Houston has never been quite so subtle before, nor has she ever shown this desire to branch out musically.&quot; But he also wasn&#x27;t positive for adult contemporary ballads of the album, stating &quot;In fact, the songs that feel the stiffest are the big production numbers; tellingly, they&#x27;re the songs that are the most reminiscent of old-school Houston.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave it three out of four stars, writing &quot;[It] reflect her growth as an artist and as an individual.&quot;

== Legacy and Commercial performance==
Worldwide, the album&#x27;s release was not preceded by that of any commercial singles, which initially resulted in it underperforming commercially. In the United States, &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; was released on November 17, 1998, when major records were released simultaneously for the holidays by high-profile musicians like Garth Brooks, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Jewel, Method Man, The Offspring and Seal besides her. &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;Music-industry folks have dubbed it Super Tuesday because more than ten major pop acts issued new CDs on the single day, making it the heaviest release date ever.&quot; The week of December 5, 1998, the album entered the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart at number thirteen, which was the peak position of the album, and her lowest chart position at that point in time, with sales of 123,000 copies in its first week. That result was disappointing initially because the release was Houston&#x27;s first non-soundtrack album in eight years and was highly anticipated. But eventually, the album became a commercial success, thanks to a series of hit singles, her energetic promotions and a successful world tour. &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; was present on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart for over a year, at 75 weeks, and on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart for 79 weeks, peaking at number seven. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album four-times platinum on November 1, 1999, for shipments of four million copies. According to the Nielson SoundScan, the album has sold 2,753,000 copies.

Across Europe, it was more successful than in the United States. In early times of its release, the commercial response for the album was short of expectations, but its sales rose sharply during the European leg of the &quot;My Love Is Your Love World Tour&quot;, which was the highest grossing arena concert tour of 1999 on the continent, and consequently &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; became the second best-selling album of 1999 in Europe, behind Cher&#x27;s &quot;Believe&quot;, spending more than one year on the charts in many countries. In the United Kingdom, it reached number four on the albums chart and was certified 3× Platinum for shipments of 900,000 copies of the album by the British Phonographic Industry(BPI). In France, the album peaked at number two on the albums chart, and was certified 2× platinum by the Syndicat National de l&#x27;Édition Phonographique (SNEP). In Germany, it climbed to the number two on the albums chart on its 35th week and has sold more than 670,000 copies. The album reached number one on the albums charts in Austria, Switzerland and Netherlands, and the top five in Belgium, Denmark, Norway and Finland. &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; was certified 4× platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) for shipments of four million copies of the album in Europe. By May 2000, the album sold over 10 million copies worldwide.

<text>Lanzenkirchen is a market town in the district of Wiener Neustadt-Land in the Austrian state of Lower Austria.

==Geography==
Lanzenkirchen is situated on the river Leitha, south of the city Wiener Neustadt, at the foot of the Rosaliengebirge mountain range. The municipality consists of five Katastralgemeinden: Lanzenkirchen, Frohsdorf, Haderswörth, Kleinwolkersdorf and Ofenbach.

==History==
===Origin of the place names in Lanzenkirchen===
&quot;Lanzenkirchen&quot;: The name comes from a German settler who built a church. His name was &quot;Anzo&quot; or &quot;Lanzo&quot;. The name &quot;Lanzenkirchen&quot; was first mentioned in 1130.

&quot;Frohsdorf&quot;: The original name was &quot;Krottendorf&quot; because many toads () were found in the water-rich area. It became Froschdorf in the 17th century ( means &quot;frog&quot;). Its present name has been used since the beginning of the 19th century.

&quot;Haderswörth&quot;: This name means &quot;river island of Hadurich&quot;.

&quot;Kleinwolkersdorf&quot;: Until around 1800 the village was known as &quot;Wolfkersdorf&quot;, meaning &quot;village of Wolfkers&quot;.

&quot;Ofenbach&quot;: The place was originally known as &quot;Quenbach&quot;. The origin of the name Ofenbach is unknown.

<doc id="1220670" wikidata="Q16106008" url="?curid=1220670" title="Gerry Mercier">
<text>Gerald Wayne Joseph Mercier (born November 7, 1942) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1977 to 1988, and was a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative government of Sterling Lyon.

The son of Gerard Mercier, he was born in Claresholm, Alberta, in 1942. Mercier was educated at St. Paul&#x27;s College and the University of Manitoba Law School, and practiced as a lawyer before entering political life. He served on the Winnipeg City Council from 1971 to 1977, when he shifted to the provincial scene. On one occasion, he served as Chair of the city&#x27;s Works and Operation Committee. In 1966, he married Merryl-Lee Wood.

In the 1977 provincial election, Mercier was elected in the central Winnipeg riding of Osborne over incumbent New Democrat Ian Turnbull by 96 votes. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government in this election, and on October 24, 1977, Mercier was appointed Attorney General, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Minister of Urban Affairs. The latter two positions were merged as one ministry on October 20, 1978, and were separated again on November 15, 1979, when Mercier was named Urban Affairs minister and Government House Leader. He also had responsibility for the Liquor Control Act between October 20, 1978, and 1981. Notwithstanding the changes in name, Mercier had essentially the same responsibilities through the entirety of the Lyon government.

Lyon&#x27;s government was defeated in the 1981 election, although Mercier successfully sought re-election in the safe Tory seat of St. Norbert rather than in the marginal Osborne riding. He was re-elected in the 1986 election. Mercier held a unique position in caucus for the next few years, being one of the few individuals who was on friendly terms with supporters of party leader Gary Filmon and potential challengers Clayton Manness and Don Orchard.

Mercier lost a narrow contest against Liberal candidate John Angus in the 1988 election, in which the Progressive Conservatives formed a minority government under Gary Filmon.

He has not sought a return to provincial politics since his defeat. He was named to the Family Division of the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench of Manitoba in 1989. From 1993 to 2009, Mercier served as Associate Chief Justice in the Family Division. In 2009, he elected to become a supernumerary judge.

<doc id="1220673" wikidata="Q991626" url="?curid=1220673" title="Grove, Oxfordshire">
<text>Grove is a village and civil parish in Oxfordshire, England.
It was part of Berkshire until it was transferred in the 1974 boundary changes.

The village is on Letcombe Brook, about north of Wantage and south-west of Oxford. The 2011 Census recorded the parish&#x27;s population as 7,178. It is also home to Formula One constructor Williams Racing.

==History==
In 1622 Thomas Grove had a watermill at Grove. Grove Farmhouse is dated 1684. It is a chequer brick building of three bays and its doorway has bolection moulding. The common lands of Wantage and Grove were enclosed by an Act of Parliament passed in 1803. The land awards under the Act seem to have been made in 1806. In 1770 the turnpike road was built as a more direct route between Wantage and Oxford. Between 1796 and 1810 the Wilts &amp; Berks Canal was built. Its main route passed through the village and a branch of the canal was built between Grove and Wantage. 

In 1840 the Great Western Railway opened Wantage Road railway station on the northern boundary of Grove. In 1875, the Wantage Tramway was built. This was a single track laid alongside the turnpike road linking Wantage Road Station and Wantage. It was operated by steam tram locomotives which pulled both a passenger tramcar and a goods wagons. Competition from the railway and tramway reduced canal traffic, and the Wilts and Berks fell into disuse in 1901. Increasing competition from road transport reduced traffic on the tram, and passenger tram services were ended in 1925. Parts of the Wilts and Berks Canal around Grove are still visible, providing some local walks. The Wilts &amp; Berks Canal Trust is working to reopen the entire canal, and several small sections around Grove have already been restored. In 1965 British Rail closed Wantage Road station. Oxfordshire County Council has a policy to seek a new station to be built to serve Wantage and Grove.
In 1942 RAF Grove was opened as a Bomber Command training base. In 1943 it was transferred to the United States Army Air Forces and the 45th Air Depot Group established one of the largest and busiest supply airfields in Europe. In 1946 the USAAF returned the airfield to the RAF, who relegated it for non-flying operations. In 1955 the station was transferred to the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, which used it until the 1960s. The site was then sold off and private housing was built on part of the former airfield. 

In 1945 the Wantage Tramway closed to freight traffic. One of its steam tram engines is preserved at Didcot Railway Centre. Grove has lately been a site of extensive housing development, greatly increasing its size and almost merging with the nearby town of Wantage. Grove is now the largest village in the Vale of White Horse.

A De Havilland Venom fighter-bomber used to be displayed on a pylon outside Grove Technology Park. In February 2022 Storm Eunice broke the pylon, and the aircraft was destroyed when it hit the ground.

==Parish churches==
King Stephen granted land at Grove to the Benedictine Abbey of Bermondsey in 1142. Grove is said to have had a chapel of St. John the Baptist until it was destroyed in 1733. It would have been a chapelry of the ecclesiastical parish of Wantage, of which Grove was a part until the 1830s. The font is an 18th-century wooden one brought from All Saints&#x27; parish church, Pusey. A new Church of England parish church was built in 1832 and Grove was made into a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1835.

The 1832 building was replaced by a new parish church of St. James the Great built in 1900 or 1901. St. James&#x27; was a Gothic Revival building in an Early English Gothic style with six bays and a south aisle. It was designed by P.A. Robson, son of the architect Edward Robert Robson. In the 1960s Sir Nikolaus Pevsner found St. James&#x27; to be derelict. In the 1960s a new parish church of St. John the Baptist was built to replace St. James&#x27;. The foundation stone is dated 1965. It incorporates items from St. James&#x27; including the font, a stained glass window depicting St. James and a panel listing successive vicars of the parish.

==Transport==
The A338 road passes through the parish, along the east side of the village. To the north, the A338 links Grove with the A420 road at Besselsleigh, west of Oxford. To the south, the A338 links Grove to Wantage, Hungerford, and junction 14 of the M4 motorway.

Several bus services link Grove with local towns and villages. Stagecoach West, Oxford Bus Company and its sister company Thames Travel provide frequent daily services from Grove to Oxford, Abingdon, Didcot, Milton Park, Harwell Campus and Wantage.Night buses between Oxford and Wantage also operate on Friday and Saturday nights, with services running as late as 3am on these days. 

The nearest railway station is , about east of Grove. The station can be reached by road, and bus services provide a direct link to the station.

==Amenities==
Grove has two primary schools: 
:*Millbrook Primary School.
:*Grove Church of England Primary School.

Grove has three public houses:
:*The Baytree, Denchworth Road
:*The Bell, Main Street
:*The Volunteer Inn, Station Road (closed in 2012 but re-opened in 2016)

==Sports and leisure==

Since 1996, Grove has been the home to Formula One team and constructor Williams Racing, after relocating from their original factory in Didcot. Williams then went on to win the World Constructors’ Championship in the 1996 and 1997 seasons with Damon Hill winning the World Drivers’ Championship in 1996 and Jacques Villeneuve in 1997. As well as the factory, the Williams base also features an Experience Centre which includes tours, a museum and hands on activities. The centre also hosts race day hospitality for fans.

Grove rugby union and association football clubs play at the Cane Lane parish recreation ground on the outskirts of the village. Grove Rugby Football Club was founded in 1971 and plays in the Southern League North division. The Club fields four senior sides, including veterans. Grove RFC has a youth section, across twelve mini (mixed, under–7 to under–12) and junior groups (under–13 to under–18; including two girls&#x27; — under–15 and under–18). One of its alumni is Jon Dunbar, who captained Grove in the early 2000s before moving to Newcastle Falcons and then Leeds Tykes/Leeds Carnegie on a professional contract. Grove Challengers FC, the local association football junior side, was founded in 1971. The club is open to children between the ages of 5–17 and teams play in the Oxford Youth Football League.

A free weekly 5K Parkrun takes place in Grove. Every Saturday morning the event is held on a multi-lap course of the Grove fields and recreation grounds.

<text>Calheta de Nesquim is a civil parish, along the southern coast of the municipality of Lajes do Pico, in the Portuguese Azores. The population in 2011 was 343, in an area of 13.81 km2.

==History==

In the 16th century, during a tempestuous and dark night, a ship returning from Brazil, loaded with wood, shipwrecked along the southern coast of Pico. Three survived the shipwreck (João Redondo or Rodolfo; João Valim; and the ship&#x27;s captain, Diogo Vaz Dourado), and were guided to safety by the ship&#x27;s dog, to a small bay. The dog was named &quot;Nesquim&quot;, and the small bay became known as the &quot;Calheta de Nesquim&quot; (&quot;small bay of Nesquim&quot;). As the story goes, Nesquim had originally survived the tempest by jumping to safety onto a natural dyke along the coast, called &quot;Morricão&quot;. It was this legendary story that inspired the heraldry of the parish, which includes a dog to represent Nesquim, the &quot;discoverer&quot; of the small bay.

By 1680, a religious parish of &quot;São Sebastião da Calheta&quot; had already existed for some time (although the date of the community&#x27;s settlement remains unclear). The construction of the parochial church began on 8 July 1851, and concluded with its consecration on 7 September 1856; it was constructed on the ruins of the older chapel (that had existed since the 15th century). It was the parish priest, Father António Silveira de Ávila, who had lived in Calheta de Nesquim for many years that had originally promoted the construction of the church.

It was Father Manuel Alvernaz, a citizen of Prainha do Norte, who help found the &quot;Cooperativa Progresso Calhetense&quot; a benevolent group dedicated to economic growth and assisting their members in the eastern municipality, and parish. It constructed a building to produce many of the local goods for export, including ceramics, pottery and local metal-works. 
Around 1925 a small boat was built by one of its members, Manuel António Furtado Simas (better known as Master Manuel Bentes) a resident of Santo Amaro, and sentimentally referred to as &quot;a Rainha das Lanchas&quot; (Queen of Launches), but christened Calheta in honor of the peoples of the Cooperative. In 1931, the little launch was sold to the municipality of Horta, and later incorporated into the fleet of Transmaçor (the Azorean Maritime Transport company), where it ended its days making regular scheduled trips between Madalena and Horta. Until then it was responsible for transporting people and goods between Pico, Faial, São Jorge and Terceira, under the command of João do José Goulart (and his mates João da Antonica, of Piedade and Francisco Goulart of Santa Cruz. Around 1927, Father Manuel Alvernaz became the confessor in Santa Cruz da Graciosa, and left the Cooperative, starting a slow decline that would finally see it close down in the following years.

==Geography==

Calheta de Nesquim is situated in the southwest coast of Pico, 18 kilometers from the municipal seat of Lajes do Pico, and connected to the parishes of Piedade (Lajes do Pico) and Ribeiras by the Regional E.R.1-1ª motorway.

Its heart is the town of the same name, and is covered in dense vegetation in the interior and rugged cliffs to along the coast, extending to smaller hamlets: Foros, Cruz da Calheta, Jogo da Bola, Fetais, Canada da Saúde, Canadas, Terreiro and Feteira. The old &quot;ramal&quot; was adapted for transit in 1942 (inaugurated on May 22), and accesses the center of the village (referred to as Terreiro) where the main church, the port and Polivalente (the multi-purpose civic center), as well most commercial businesses are located.

==Architecture==

The civil parish has undertaken several projects to attract tourist dollars, in this mainly agriculture and fishing community. These include park areas in Morricão and Feteira, the remodeling of the antique windmill, and construction or expansion of existing natural pools at Poço das Mujas and Portinho da Feteira.

===Civic===
* Whale-hunting buildings and installations (), used to demonstrate Calheta de Nesquim tradition of whaling during since the 16th century;
* Windmill of Morricão (), an example of the traditional windmills that were used during the formative period of the communities growth;

===Religious===
* Church of São Sebastião (), the parochial church located in the center of the village, the zone referred to as the Terreiro; the temple is a building with two bell-towers, and constructed facing the ocean, owing to its communities focus on the sea. In 1948, new bells and a clock were added to the front facade, along with images of Santa Filomena and Santa Teresinha, due to the patronage of Lourenço Oliveira (a U.S. emigrant and former resident). In 1983, new renovations, supported by Emília Vieira da Silva (another U.S. emigrant), the local authority (&quot;junta freguesia&quot;), municipal council of Lajes do Pico, and the Azorean Regional Government;
* Hermitage of São Sebastião (), located in the cemetery, it is one of the examples of early 16th-century architecture;
* Império of Calheta de Nesquim (), a 20th-century religious building used in the festivals dedicated to the Cult of the Holy Spirit, influenced by Terceirense architecture of the period, that includes singular space with rounded facade surmounted by crown and series of Gothic-inspired windows;

==Culture==
Being both a civil parish and religious community, the population celebrates a mixture of secular and religious celebrations annually. They include the religious festivals of: the Feast Day of São Sebastião (celebrated on the 24 January), São Pedro Gonçalves (January 31), the festival of Nossa Senhora de Fátima (on the Sunday closest to the 13th of May), the Feast of Bom Jesus (August 6) and semi-secular festival of São Martinho (with traditional festivities on 11, 13 and 14 November). In addition, the ubiquitous religious celebration of the Holy Spirit, occurs at Calheta de Nesquim&#x27;s império and chapel during the Sunday and Monday of Pentecosts. In addition, the community also has a festival of band music supported by the local &quot;Filarmónica&quot; from 9–11 July, not to mention the Festa da Cabra e Cavala (literally, the &quot;festival of the goat and mackerel&quot;) on August 7-8th.

The Sociedade Filarmónica Lira Fraternal Calhetense was formed in 1888, from a small group of Republicans, that included the teacher Manuel Pereira Gomes, who organized a group of fourteen musicians that played until around 1910. After a period of inactivity, a new band was established during the 1920s by a group of youth supported by Father Lourenço of Ribeirinha (then parish priest). In 1930 the Lira Fraternal Calhetense returned, this time under the directorship of Gregório Reis, until he left to form the União Musical Calhetense beginning a rivalry between the established bands in 1934. Some families stopped talking to each other, friends parted ways, as the distinction between the Musica Nova (the &quot;new music&quot;), of the &quot;União Musical&quot;, and the Musica Velha (&quot;old music&quot;) of the traditionalist Lira Fraternal Calhetense. This rivalry would remain bitter as the Lira Fraternal Calhetense was directed by João Ávial de Melo, and would persist until the 1940s when few musicians and financial difficulties would force the integration of both bands. Over the years many musicians and band directors would flow into and out of the Fraternal Calhetense, but none of the antagonisms from the mid-century would persist.

Annually, the Festa da Lira Fraternal Calhetense on the second weekend of July, is a consequence of the elevated stature of this institution to the community. It brings other musical groups from around the island, as well as abroad, for a couple days of concerts.

==Notable citizens==
* José Dias de Melo (8 April 1925 - São José; 24 September 2008), author, noted for many of his writings on whaling, emigration and Azorean life, that included &quot;Toadas do Mar e da Terra&quot;, &quot;Pedras Negras&quot;, &quot;Mar Rubro&quot; and &quot;Mar Pla Proa&quot;.

<doc id="1220680" wikidata="Q2626349" url="?curid=1220680" title="Islam in Turkey">
<text>Islam is the most practiced religion in Turkey. Most Turkish Sunni Muslims belong to the Hanafi school of jurisprudence. The established presence of Islam in the region that now constitutes modern Turkey dates back to the later half of the 11th century, when the Seljuks started expanding into eastern Anatolia.

While records count the number of Muslims as 99.8%, this is likely to be an overestimation; most surveys estimate lower numbers at around 94%. The most popular school of thought (maddhab) being the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam (about 90% of overall Muslim denominations). The remaining Muslim sects, forming about 9% of the Muslim population, consist of Alevis, Ja&#x27;faris (representing 1%) and Alawites (with an estimated population of around 500,000 to 1 million, or about 1%). There is also a minority of Sufi and non-denominational Muslims.

== History ==
=== Islamic empires ===

During the Muslim conquests of the 7th and early 8th centuries, Arab armies established the Islamic Empire. The Umayyad Caliphate continued the spread of Islam. The Islamic Golden Age was soon inaugurated by the middle of the 8th century by the ascension of the Abbasid Caliphate and the transfer of the capital from Damascus to Baghdad.

The later period saw initial expansion and the capture of Crete (840). The Abbasids soon shifted their attention towards the East. During the later fragmentation of the Abbasid rule and the rise of their Shiite rivals the Fatimids and Buyids, a resurgent Byzantium recaptured Crete and Cilicia in 961, Cyprus in 965, and pushed into the Levant by 975. The Byzantines successfully contested with the Fatimids for influence in the region until the arrival of the Seljuk Turks who first allied with the Abbasids and then ruled as the &quot;de facto&quot; rulers.

In 1068, Alp Arslan and allied Turkoman tribes recaptured many Abbasid lands and even invaded Byzantine regions, pushing further into eastern and central Anatolia after a major victory at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. The disintegration of the Seljuk dynasty resulted in the rise of subsequent, smaller, rival Turkic kingdoms such as the Danishmends, the Sultanate of Rum, and various Atabegs who contested the control of the region during the Crusades and incrementally expanded across Anatolia until the rise of the Ottoman Empire.
=== Ottoman Caliphate ===
Beginning in the 12th century, new waves of Turkic migrants arrived, many of whom belonging to Sufi orders. Some of these migrants later went on to incorporate heterodox beliefs. One Sufi order that appealed to Turks in Anatolia was the Safaviyya, an order that was originally Sunni and non-political, but later became both Shi&#x27;a and politically based in northwest Iran. During the 14th and 15th centuries, the Safavid and similar orders such as the Bektaşi became rivals of the Ottomans—who were orthodox Sunni Muslims—for political control of eastern Anatolia. Although the Bektaşi order became accepted as a sect of orthodox Sunni Muslims, they did not abandon their heterodox beliefs. In contrast, the Safavids eventually conquered Iran, spread their beliefs, and became proponents of orthodox Twelver Shi&#x27;a Islam.

The conquest of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople (modern day Istanbul) in 1453 enabled the Ottomans to consolidate their empire in Anatolia and Thrace. The Ottomans later revived the title of caliph during the reign of Selim I. Despite the absence of a formal institutional structure, Sunni religious functionaries continued to play an important political role. In theory, the codified system of sharia regulated all aspects of everyday life, at least for Muslim subjects of the empire. The head of the judiciary ranked directly below the sultan, and was second in power only to the grand vizier. Early in the Ottoman period, the office of grand mufti of Istanbul evolved into that of &quot;Şeyhülislam&quot; (shaykh, or &quot;leader of Islam&quot;), which had ultimate jurisdiction over all the courts in the empire and consequently exercised authority over the interpretation and application of sharia. Legal opinions pronounced by the Şeyhülislam were considered definitive interpretations.

=== Secularization era ===

The secularization of Turkey started during the last years of the Ottoman Empire and was a prominent feature of Atatürk&#x27;s reforms. Under his leadership, the caliphate was abolished, and the secular power of religious authorities and functionaries was reduced and eventually eliminated. Religious foundations were nationalized. The influential and popular orders of the dervish brotherhoods (Tariqa) were also suppressed.

==== Republic period: 1923–present ====

The withdrawal of Turkey, heir to the Ottoman Empire, as the presumptive leader of the international Muslim community, was symbolic of the change in the government&#x27;s relationship to Islam. Secularism &quot;(or laiklik)&quot; became one of the &quot;Six Arrows&quot; of Atatürk&#x27;s program for remaking Turkey. Whereas Islam had formed the identity of Muslims within the Ottoman Empire, secularism was seen as molding the new Turkish nation and its citizens.


==== Atatürk&#x27;s Reforms ====

In 1922, the new nationalist regime abolished the Ottoman sultanate, as well as the caliphate in 1924 - the religious office that Ottoman sultans had held for four centuries. Thus, for the first time in Islamic history, no ruler claimed spiritual leadership of Islam.
Atatürk and his associates abolished certain religious practices and institutions and generally questioned the value of religion, preferring to place their trust in science. They regarded organized religion as an anachronism and contrasted it unfavorably with &quot;civilization&quot;, which to them meant a rationalist, secular culture. Unlike in the West, the establishment of secularism in Turkey was not a gradual process of separation of church and state.

In the Ottoman Empire, all residents, at least theoretically, had been subject to traditional religious law, and Sunni religious organizations had been part of the state structure. However, the state usually had authority over the clergy and religious law (e.g. many Sultans are known to change Şeyhülislams, who do not approve of state politics). When the reformers of the early 1920s opted for a secular state, they removed religion from the sphere of public policy and restricted it to exclusively that of personal morals, behavior, and faith. Although private observance of religious rituals could continue, religion and religious organization were excluded from public life.In addition to the abolition of the caliphate, new laws mandated the abolition of the office of Şeyhülislam and the religious hierarchy, the closing and confiscation of Sufi lodges, meeting places, and monasteries and the outlawing of their rituals and meetings, the establishment of government control over vakıfs which had been inalienable under Sharia, the replacement of sharia with adapted European legal codes; the closing of religious schools; the abandonment of the Islamic calendar in favor of the Gregorian calendar used in the West, and restrictions on public attire that had religious associations, with the fez outlawed for men and the veil discouraged for women.

Atatürk and his colleagues also attempted to &quot;turkify&quot; Islam through official encouragement of practices such as the usage of Turkish rather than Arabic at devotions, substituting the Turkish word Tanrı for the Arabic word Allah, and incorporating Turkish into daily calls to prayer. These changes in devotional practices caused widespread criticism among Muslims, which led to a return to the Arabic version of the call to prayer in 1950, after the opposition party DP won the elections. Of longer-lasting effect were the regime&#x27;s measures of prohibiting religious education, restricting the building of new mosques, and transferring existing mosques to secular purposes - most notably the Hagia Sophia (Justinian&#x27;s sixth-century Christian basilica, which had been converted into a mosque by Mehmet II), which was turned into a museum in 1935. Muftis and imams were appointed by the government, and religious instruction was taken over by the Ministry of National Education. As a result of these policies, the Turkish Republic was judged negatively by some sections of the Muslim world.

The common expectation was that these policies of the 1920s and 1930s would diminish the role of religion in public, which, however, did not occur. As early as 1925, religious grievances were one of the principal causes of the Şeyh Sait rebellion, an uprising in southeastern Turkey that may have claimed as many as 30,000 lives before being suppressed.

Although Turkey was secularized at a legal level, religion remained a strong force. After 1950, some political leaders espoused support for programs and policies that appealed to the religiously inclined in an attempt to benefit from a lot of the population&#x27;s attachment to religion. Such efforts were opposed by most of the state, who believed that secularism was an essential principle of Kemalist Ideology. This gradually led to a polarization of the entire country, which became especially evident in the 1980s, as a new generation of religiously motivated local leaders emerged to challenge the dominance of the secularized political elite.

By 1994, slogans promising that a return to Islam would cure economic ills and solve the problems of bureaucratic inefficiencies had enough general appeal to enable avowed religious candidates to win mayoral elections in Istanbul and Ankara.

==== Multi-party period ====
Following the loosening of authoritarian political control in 1946, a large number of people began to openly call for a return to traditional religious practices. During the 1950s, even certain political leaders found it expedient to join religious leaders in advocating more state respect for religion.

A more direct manifestation of the growing reaction against secularism was the revival of the Sufi brotherhoods. Not only did suppressed Sufi orders such as the Kadiri, Mevlevi, Nakşibendi, Khālidiyyā and Al-Ṭarīqah al-Tijāniyyah reemerge, but new movements were formed, including the Nur Cemaati, Gülen movement, Sülaymānīyyā, Community of İskenderpaşa and İsmailağa. The Tijāni became especially militant in confronting the state, damaging monuments to Atatürk to symbolize their opposition to his policy of secularization. This was, however, an isolated incident and only involved one particular Sheikh of the order. Throughout the 1950s, there were numerous trials of Ticani and other Sufi leaders for anti-state activities.

Simultaneously, some movements, notably the Süleymancı and Nurcular, cooperated with those politicians perceived as supportive of pro-Islamic policies. The Nurcular eventually advocated support for Turkey&#x27;s multi-party political system, and one of its offshoots, the Gülen movement, had supported the True Path Party while the Işıkçılar and Enver Ören had openly supported the Motherland Party since the mid-1980s.
The demand for restoration of religious education in public schools began in the late 1940s. The government initially responded by authorizing religious instruction in state schools for those students whose parents requested it. Under the rule of the Democrat Party during the 1950s, religious education was made compulsory in secondary schools unless parents made a specific request to have their children excused. Religious education was made compulsory for all primary and secondary school children in 1982.

The reintroduction of religion into the school curriculum raised the question of religious higher education. The seculars believed that Islam could be &quot;reformed&quot; if future leaders were trained in state-controlled seminaries. To further this goal, the government in 1949 established a faculty of divinity at Ankara University to train teachers of Islam and imams. In 1951 the Democrat Party government set up special secondary schools (İmam Hatip schools) for the training of imams and preachers. The number of these schools expanded rapidly to over 250 during the 1970s, when the pro-Islam National Salvation Party participated in coalition governments. Following the 1980 coup, the military, although secular in orientation, viewed religion as an effective means to counter socialist ideas and thus authorized the construction of 90 more İmam Hatip high schools.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Islam experienced political rehabilitation due to center-right secular leaders perceiving religion as a potential bulwark in their ideological struggle with center-left secular leaders. A small advocacy group that became extremely influential was the Intellectuals&#x27; Hearth (), an organization that holds the beliefs that true Turkish culture is a synthesis of the Turks&#x27; pre-Islamic traditions and Islam. According to the Hearth, Islam not only constitutes an essential aspect of Turkish culture, but is a force that can be regulated by the state to help socialize the people to be obedient citizens acquiescent to the overall secular order. After the 1980 coup, many of the Hearth&#x27;s proposals for restructuring schools, colleges, and state broadcasting were adopted. The result was a purge from these state institutions of more than 2,000 intellectuals perceived as espousing leftist ideas incompatible with the Hearth&#x27;s vision of Turkey&#x27;s national culture.
The state&#x27;s more tolerant attitude toward Islam encouraged the proliferation of private religious activities, including the construction of new mosques and Qur&#x27;an schools in the cities, the establishment of Islamic centers for research on and conferences about Islam and its role in Turkey, and the establishment of religiously oriented professional and women&#x27;s journals. The printing of newspapers, the publication of religious books, and the growth of innumerable religious projects ranging from health centers, child-care facilities, and youth hostels to financial institutions and consumer cooperatives flourished. When the government legalized private broadcasting after 1990, several Islamic radio stations were organized. In the summer of 1994, the first Islamic television station, Kanal 7, began broadcasting, first in Istanbul and then in Ankara.

Although the tarikah have played a seminal role in Turkey&#x27;s religious revival and in the mid-1990s still published, several of the country&#x27;s most widely circulated religious journals and newspapers, a new phenomenon, &quot;İslamcı Aydın&quot; (the Islamist intellectual), unaffiliated with the traditional Sufi orders, emerged during the 1980s. Prolific and popular writers such as Ali Bulaç, Rasim Özdenören, and İsmet Özel drew upon their knowledge of Western philosophy, Marxist sociology, and radical Islamist political theory to advocate for a modern Islamic perspective that does not hesitate to criticize societal issues while simultaneously remaining faithful to the ethical values and spiritual dimensions of religion. Islamist intellectuals are harshly critical of Turkey&#x27;s secular intellectuals, whom they fault for trying to do in Turkey what Western intellectuals did in Europe: substitute worldly materialism, in its capitalist or socialist version, for religious values.

On 15 July 2016, a coup d&#x27;état was attempted in Turkey against state institutions by a faction within the Turkish Armed Forces with connections to the Gülen movement, citing an erosion in secularism.

==== Diyanet and secularism ====
There is an administration called &quot;Presidency of Religious Affairs&quot; or Diyanet manages 77,500 mosques. This state agency, established by Atatürk (1924), finance only Sunni Muslim worship Other religions must ensure a financially self-sustaining running and they face administrative obstacles during operation. 

The Diyanet is an official state institution established in 1924 and works to provide Quranic education for children, as well as drafting weekly sermons delivered to approximately 85,000 different mosques. Furthermore, the Diyanet employs all of the imams in Turkey.

When collecting tax, all Turkish citizens are equal. The tax rate is not based on religion. However, through the Diyanet, Turkish citizens are not equal in the use of revenue. The Presidency of Religious Affairs, which has a budget over U.S. $2.5 billion in 2012, finance only Sunni Muslim worship.

Sufi orders like Alevi-Bektashi, Bayrami-Jelveti, Halveti &quot;(Gulshani, Jerrahi, Nasuhi, Rahmani, Sunbuli, Ussaki),&quot; Hurufi-Rüfai, Malamati, Mevlevi, Nakşibendi &quot;(Halidi, Haqqani),&quot; Qadiri-Galibi and Ja&#x27;fari Muslims are not officially recognized.

==== Headscarf issue ====

Although intellectual debates on the role of Islam attracted widespread interest, they did not provoke the kind of controversy that erupted over the issue of appropriate attire for Muslim women. During the early 1980s, female college students who were determined to demonstrate their commitment to Islam began to cover their heads and necks with scarves and wear long, shape-concealing overcoats. The appearance of these women in the citadels of Turkish secularism shocked those men and women who tended to perceive such attire as a symbol of the Islamic traditionalism they rejected. Militant secularists persuaded the Higher Education Council to issue a regulation in 1987 forbidding female university students to cover their heads in class. Protests by thousands of religious students and some university professors forced several universities to waive enforcement of the dress code. The issue continued to be seriously divisive in the mid-1990s. Throughout the first half of the 1990s, highly educated, articulate but religiously pious women have appeared in public dressed in Islamic attire that conceals all but their faces and hands. Other women, especially in Ankara, Istanbul, and İzmir, have demonstrated against such attire by wearing revealing fashions and Atatürk badges. The issue is discussed and debated in almost every type of forum – artistic, commercial, cultural, economic, political, and religious. For many citizens of Turkey, women&#x27;s dress has become the issue that defines whether a Muslim is secularist or religious. In 2010, the Turkish Higher Educational council (YÖK) lifted the ban on headscarves at the universities. Since the start of his presidency, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has drastically increased the amount of religious high schools across Turkey to support his plan on bringing up a more pious generation. However, this push on piousness in school children seems to have had an adverse effect, for there is anecdotal evidence of a notable number of Turkish students from religious high schools admitting their loss of faith in Islamic beliefs, which has caused substantial amount of discussion among politicians and religious clerics.

More recently in 2016, Turkey approved hijab as the part of the official police uniform. For the first time, female officers will be able to cover their heads with a headscarf under their police caps. This act was pushed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan&#x27;s Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP) that have been pushing for relaxed restrictions on the hijab.

== Denominations ==

===Sunni Islam===

The vast majority of the present-day Turkish people are Muslim and the Sunni Islam is the most populous Islamic sect, comprising about 90% of the Muslims in the country. The most popular school of law is the Hanafite madh&#x27;hab of Sunni Islam. The Hanafi madhhab was the official school of Islamic jurisprudence espoused by the Ottoman Empire and a 2013 survey conducted by the Turkish Directorate of Religious Affairs indicates that 77.5% of Turkish Muslims identify themselves as Hanafis. Another common Sunni jurisprudence, Shafi&#x27;i is the dominant one in Turkish Kurdistan. Although the Maturidi and Ash&#x27;ari schools of Islamic theology (which apply Ilm al-Kalam or rational thought to understand the Quran and the hadith) have been the dominant creeds in Turkey due to their widespread acceptance and propagation since the beginning of the Ottoman Empire, the Athari (literalist) creed of the Salafi movement has seen increasing acceptance.

Compared to the Hanbali school of Islam, the Hanafi school of Islam takes a much more liberal take on the religion, allowing for a more lenient interpretation of religious law.

===Shia Islam===
Twelver branch of Shia Islam Muslim population of Turkey is composed of Ja&#x27;fari aqidah and fiqh, Batiniyya-Sufism aqidah of Maymūn’al-Qāddāhī fiqh of the Alevīs, and Cillī aqidah of Maymūn ibn Abu’l-Qāsim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-Tabarānī fiqh of the Alawites, who altogether constitutes nearly one tenth of the whole population of the country. An estimate for the Turkish Alevi population varies from 3.5 million to 11 million. 

Unlike the common usage of the term &quot;Shi&#x27;a&quot; in other languages, &quot;Aleviler&quot; instead is being frequently used to represent all the Shi&#x27;a Muslim sects in Turkish language. Furthermore, the term Kızılbaş in the history was used pejoratively for all Shi&#x27;ites in Anatolia.

====Alevis====

Estimates for Alevi population vary from less than 4 million to more than 12 million according to different sources. It&#x27;s hard to make a realistic estimate for their population since the Turkish government has never asked about religious denominations in conducted censuses. Other reasons for this are the secular tendencies of the Alevi population and oppression by Sunni Islamists, which causes most Alevis to hide their religious identity. However, considering the few conducted reliable surveys, ~10% can be taken as a simplistic estimation. Some people use the term Alevi to refer all Shia Muslims in Turkey since they are the dominant Shia sect in the country.
; The Alevi ʿaqīdah 

*Some of their members (or sub-groups, especially those belonging to Qizilbash and Hurufism) claim that God takes abode in the bodies of the human-beings (&quot;ḥulūl&quot;), believe in metempsychosis (&quot;tanāsukh&quot;),
*Some of the Alevis criticize the course of Islam as it is being practiced overwhelmingly by more than 99% of Sunni and Shia population.
*Regular daily salat and fasting in the holy month of Ramadan are not officially done by the Qizilbashs, Hurufis, and Ishikist groups. These members of &quot;Yazdânism&quot; like &quot;Ishikists&quot; and &quot;Yarsanis&quot; who portrayed themselves as &quot;Alevis,&quot; are frequently denounced by &quot;the Dedes.&quot;

====Ja&#x27;faris====

The followers of the Ja&#x27;fari jurisprudence constitute the third sizable community. It is historically the primary denomination of ethnic Azerbaijani people. Most of them lives in the eastern provinces neighboring to Azerbaijan, more particularly in the Iğdır Province and Kars Province, but also larger cities in the west. It is estimated that Ja&#x27;faris make up 4% of the population of Turkey, &quot;i.e.&quot; about 3,300,000. They have 70 mosques in Istanbul and some 300 throughout the country and receive no state funding for their mosques and imams as the Presidency of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) is exclusively Sunni.

====Alawites====
The majority of the Alawite community in Turkey with an estimated population of around 1 million lives in the Province of Hatay, where they nearly represent half of the total population,
primarily in the districts of Arsuz, Defne and Samandağ, where Alawites constitute the majority and in Iskenderun and Antakya where they constitute a significant minority of the population.
Larger Alawite communities can also be found in the Çukurova region, mostly in and around the cities of Adana, Tarsus and Mersin. They are known as Arab Alevis by Turkish people.

===Sufism===

Folk Islam in Turkey has derived many of its popular practices from Sufism which has good presence in Turkey and Egypt. Particular Sufi shaikhs – and occasionally other individuals reputed to be pious – were regarded after death as saints having special powers. Veneration of saints (both male and female) and pilgrimages to their shrines and graves represent an important aspect of popular Islam in the country. Folk Islam has continued to embrace such practices although the veneration of saints officially has been discouraged since the 1930s. Plaques posted in various sanctuaries forbid the lighting of candles, the offering of votive objects, and related devotional activities in these places. Modern day Sufi shaykhs with large adherents in Turkey include Shaykh Mehmet Efendi (residing in Istanbul) and Mawlana Sheikh Nazim Al-Haqqani who resided in Lefka, North Cyprus, until his death in May, 2014.
===Quranism===

Those who do not accept the authority of hadith, known as Quranists, Quraniyoon, or Ahl al-Quran, are also present in Turkey. In Turkey, Quranist ideas became particularly noticeable, with portions of the youth either leaving Islam or converting to Quranism. There has been significant Quranist scholarship in Turkey, with there being even Quranist theology professors in significant universities, including scholars like Yaşar Nuri Öztürk and Caner Taslaman. Some believe that there are secret Quranists even in the Diyanet itself.

The Turkish Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet) regularly criticizes and insults Quranists, gives them no recognition and calls them kafirs (disbelievers).

<text>William Least Heat-Moon (born William Lewis Trogdon, August 27, 1939) is an American travel writer and historian. He describes his heritage as English, Irish, and Osage. He is the author of several books which chronicle unusual journeys through the United States, including cross-country trips by boat (&quot;River-Horse&quot;, 1999) and, in his best known work (1982&#x27;s &quot;Blue Highways&quot;), about his journey in a 1975 Ford Econoline van.

==Biography==

William Trogdon was born in Kansas City, Missouri. The Trogdon family name comes from his Euro-American lineage, and the Heat-Moon name reflects his claimed Osage lineage. William&#x27;s father, Ralph Grayston Trogdon, called himself &quot;Heat-Moon,&quot; his elder half-brother from his mother&#x27;s previous marriage was called by his stepfather &quot;Little Heat-Moon,&quot; and he was called &quot;Least Heat-Moon.&quot; Trogdon, the son of an attorney, grew up in Missouri where he attended public schools. He attended the University of Missouri, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1961, a masters in 1962, and a PhD in 1972 (all in English). He later went back and completed a bachelor&#x27;s in photojournalism at MU in 1978. In 2011, he received an honorary degree from MU. Trogdon was a member of the Beta-Theta chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon. He later served as a professor of English at the university.

Trogdon resides in Boone County near the Missouri River.

==Works==
&quot;Blue Highways&quot; (1982) is a chronicle of a three-month-long road trip that Least Heat-Moon took throughout the United States in 1978 after he had lost his teaching job and been separated from his first wife. He tells how he traveled 13,000 miles, as much as possible on secondary roads, and tried to avoid cities. These roads were often drawn on maps in blue in the old-style Rand McNally road atlas, hence the book title. Living out of his van, he visited small towns such as Nameless, Tennessee; Hachita, New Mexico; and Bagley, Minnesota, to find places in America untouched by fast food chains and interstate highways. The book records his search for something greater than himself and includes memorable encounters in roadside cafés. This memoir was very popular, making the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list in 1982–83 for 42 weeks. It was also the winner of a Christopher Award in 1984.

&quot;PrairyErth: A Deep Map&quot; (1991) is an account of the history and people of Chase County, Kansas. This work introduced the concept of a deep map.

&quot;River-Horse&quot; (1999) is Least Heat-Moon&#x27;s account of a four-month coast-to-coast boat trip across the U.S. in which he traveled almost exclusively on the nation&#x27;s waterways from the Atlantic to the Pacific. During this nearly 5,000-mile journey, he followed documented routes recorded by early explorers such as Henry Hudson and the Lewis and Clark expedition.

&quot;Columbus in the Americas&quot; (2002) is a brief history of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s journeys.

&quot;Roads to Quoz&quot; (2008) is another &quot;road book.&quot; This covers &quot;not one long road trip, but a series of shorter ones&quot; taken over the years between books. Robert Sullivan of the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; commented that Least Heat-Moon celebrates &quot;serendipity and joyous disorder.&quot;

&quot;Here, There, Elsewhere&quot; (2013) is a collection of Least Heat-Moon&#x27;s best short-form travel writing.

&quot;An Osage Journey to Europe 1827-1830&quot; (2013) was translated and edited by Least Heat-Moon and James K Wallace. It is the account of six Osage people who traveled to Europe in 1827, accompanied by three Americans.

&quot;Writing &#x27;Blue Highways&#x27; &quot; (2014) is an account of how Least Heat-Moon wrote his best-selling book &quot;Blue Highways&quot;. In reflecting on the journey, he also discusses writing, publishing, personal relationships, and many other aspects that went into writing the book. It won an award for Distinguished Literary Achievement, Missouri Humanities Council, 2015.

&quot;Celestial Mechanics: A Tale for a Mid-Winter Night&quot; (2017) is William Least Heat-Moon&#x27;s debut novel.

== Themes ==

=== Ecocentrism ===
Least Heat-Moon&#x27;s works focus very heavily upon the theme of Ecocentrism.

Because his best known work centers on different methods of traversing the North American landscape, one might say that the ecosystem serves as a necessary foundation for Least Heat-Moon&#x27;s writings. Jonathan Levin, Professor of English at the University of Mary Washington, labels Least Heat-Moon a “literary naturalist.&quot; Specifically, he attempts to illustrate a hybrid relationship between humans and the environment and how each entity influences the other. Nature is presented more as an active character in Least Heat-Moon&#x27;s narratives as opposed to a backdrop.

As a result, Least Heat-Moon calls into question the nature of how society defines its own geographical boundaries. Renee Bryzik, a professor at UC Davis, likens Least Heat-Moon&#x27;s method of illustrating this socio-environmental interaction to a reinvigorated analysis of Bioregionalism. According to Bryzik, what seems most fascinating to Least Heat-Moon are instances where the line dividing society and nature becomes blurred, and it is difficult to tell whether society has influenced the environment or vice versa.

Least Heat-Moon&#x27;s writings also present a critique of how societal progress has negatively affected the ecosystem. The insights that Least Heat-Moon gained in his travels along the blue highways were two-fold in that while he was able to come to terms with his own personal growth, he was simultaneously able to contemplate how he as a human being fit into the greater fabric of the universe. In essence, his ability to comment on the state of the ecosystem post-&quot;Blue Highways&quot; stemmed from his acquired understanding of how humans interact with their physical surrounding, and how they should interact with their environment.

&quot;River Horse&quot; is particularly effective as a medium for commentary on contemporary environmental resource management as his travels were reliant upon a different kind of blue highway: the rivers of North America.

=== Psychology of self ===
Although &quot;Blue Highways&quot; is remembered primarily for the physical trek, which covers about 38 of the 50 states in the U.S., the quintessence of the book is the internal journey that Least Heat-Moon takes. The blue highways allowed Least Heat-Moon the space and the freedom to reflect upon who he was, who he wanted to be, and how he fit into the greater world around him. Initiated by the loss of his job and the unraveling of his marriage, his own search for “self” quite literally took him down the road less traveled. &quot;Blue Highways&quot; has been likened to a cross between John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Travels with Charley&quot;, and Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot;.

Apart from Least Heat-Moon&#x27;s own admission that &quot;Travels with Charley&quot; partially influenced the decision to travel and write &quot;Blue Highways&quot;, the literary tones of both books also parallel each other. Both authors were interested in exploring the U.S. as thoughtful and reflective observers. Least Heat-Moon&#x27;s circumstances mirror those of Kerouac&#x27;s protagonist as well, and the work shows a spiritual dimension reminiscent of “Beat” culture. He was himself influenced by Beat writers such as Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and admitted to reworking the concept of Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot;.

One aspect of &quot;Blue Highways&quot; as a travel narrative is that it is a snapshot of American culture that echoes the sentiments of Beat Generation writings and even Romantic Era travelogues, but does so in the late 1970s. His decision to strike out on the open road in search of spiritual truths continued a tradition that captured the cultural outlook of a certain era in U.S. history (the 1950s–1970s). To a certain extent this tradition has been lost.

Although Least Heat-Moon&#x27;s works echo Transcendentalist spiritual concepts, he has stated that he does not consider himself to be a “Transcendentalist”.

<text>Rocket is the Primitive Radio Gods&#x27; debut album, released on June 18, 1996, by Columbia Records. &quot;Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand&quot; was a hit single.

==Reception==

Despite the critical acclaim surrounding the lead single, the album as a whole received negative reviews from critics. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: &quot;Most of &quot;Rocket&quot; sounds exactly like somebody messing around with a four-track, more intent on capturing sounds, not songs. Usually, this would at least result in some interesting sounds, but O&#x27;Connor hasn&#x27;t even managed that. At its core, &quot;Rocket&quot; sounds like a demo tape with one promising song.&quot;

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer Ryan Schreiber said, &quot;At any rate, you don&#x27;t want &quot;Rocket&quot; in your record collection now or ever since the music sounds like a third-rate, decaffeinated version of Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin and because, by reading &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, you&#x27;ve already proven you have better taste than that (I hope).&quot; Schreiber gave it an extremely negative rating of 1.2/10, falling under &quot;Awful, not a single pleasant track&quot;. However, Schreiber wrote that &quot;Phone Booth&quot; &quot;as a single, is going to sell like the Rubik&#x27;s Cube.&quot;, but that &quot;as an album? Let&#x27;s face it: Three minutes is enough for even the most mind-numbed, tasteless societal outcast.&quot;

<doc id="1220690" wikidata="Q732554" url="?curid=1220690" title="Chavín de Huántar">
<text>Chavín de Huántar is an archaeological site in Peru, containing ruins and artifacts constructed as early as 1200 BC, and occupied until around 400–500 BC by the Chavín, a major pre-Inca culture. The site is located in the Ancash Region, north of Lima, at an elevation of , east of the Cordillera Blanca at the start of the Conchucos Valley.

Chavín de Huántar has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Some of the Chavín relics from this archaeological site are on display in the Museo de la Nación in Lima and the Museo Nacional de Chavín in Chavín itself.

Occupation at Chavín de Huántar has been carbon-dated to at least 3000 BC, with ceremonial center activity occurring primarily toward the end of the second millennium, and through the middle of the first millennium BC. While the fairly large population was based on an agricultural economy, the city&#x27;s location at the headwaters of the Marañón River, between the coast and the jungle, made it an ideal location for the dissemination and collection of both ideas and material goods. This archaeological site is a large ceremonial center that has revealed a great deal about the Chavín culture. Chavín de Huántar served as a gathering place for people of the region to come together and worship. The transformation of the center into a valley-dominating monument made it a pan-regional place of importance. People went to Chavín de Huántar as a center: to attend and participate in rituals, consult an oracle, or enter a cult.

Findings at Chavín de Huántar indicate that social instability and upheaval began to occur between 500 and 300 BC, at the same time that the larger Chavín culture began to decline. Large ceremonial sites were abandoned, some unfinished, and were replaced by villages and agricultural land. At Chavín de Huántar, no later than 500 BC, a small village replaced the Circular Plaza. The plaza was occupied by a succession of cultural groups, and residents salvaged building stones and stone carvings to use in house walls. Multiple occupation floors indicate the village was continuously occupied through the 1940s.
==Site description==
The Chavín civilization was centered on the site of Chavín de Huántar, the religious center of the Chavín people and the political capital. The temple is a massive flat-topped pyramid surrounded by lower platforms. It is a U-shaped plaza with a sunken circular court in the center. The inside of the temple walls are decorated with sculptures and carvings. During its heyday, Chavín de Huántar was used as a religious center for ceremonies and events, perhaps a home for an oracle. The site contains a number of major structures, including Temples A, B, C and D, and areas and buildings designated as the Major Plaza, the Circular Plaza, the Old Temple and New Temple. But the latter two designations are no longer accurate in light of recent research advances.

Chavín de Huántar was constructed over many stages starting prior to 1200 BC, with most major construction over by 750 BC. The site continued in use as a ceremonial center until around 500 BC, but its primary religious function had ceased prior to 400 BC. The site was increasingly occupied by casual residents of the highly distinct Huaraz cultural tradition.

The &quot;Circular Plaza&quot; appears to have been a sacred and ritually important, open-air space within a ceremonial center. Prior to 800–700 BC, this location had a number of functions, including serving as an atrium for entering Temple A through the temple&#x27;s north staircase.

The plaza in the classic period, after 700 BC, is bounded on three sides by major Temples A, B, and C. The plaza is perfectly circular and is close to in diameter, with a floor consisted of pillow-shaped pavers of yellow diatomite. It appears that a center line of black limestone blocks runs on its architectural east-west axis. Walls of the plaza were constructed of cut stone, principally granite, laid in courses of varying width. The two broadest courses were carved in arcs closest to the western staircase and in two pairs of terminal stones flanking the eastern staircase.
The &quot;Old Temple&quot;, dating from the site&#x27;s early history, was an inward-facing structure composed primarily of passageways built around a circular courtyard. The structure contained obelisks and stone monuments with relief carvings depicting jaguars, caimans, and other forms with anthropomorphic features. The Lanzón Gallery, located at the very center, contained a sculpture of the Lanzón, which is assumed to be a supreme deity of Chavín de Huántar. The figure is anthropomorphic, with a feline head and human body. Mortars, pestles, conch-shell trumpets, and many other items have also been found. Many of these artifacts have an anthropomorphic design or decoration and are thought to be associated with Chavín rituals.
The &quot;New Temple&quot;, constructed between 500 and 200 BC, is also based on a gallery and plaza design and contained many relief sculptures. The Lanzon deity is shown here, holding a strombus shell in the right hand, while the left hand holds a &quot;Spondylus&quot; shell, considered to have sacred properties.

The architectural design of Chavín de Huántar changed over time as an old temple development was added to with a new temple. Changes were more complex than in one stage of renovation. Smaller renovations happened consistently over the Chavín horizon, ending by about 500 BC, when the new temple was completed. With the simpler design of the old temple, Chavín de Huántar followed the U-shaped ceremonial center design accompanied by a sunken circular plaza that was typical of many coastal settlements in the Early Horizon period.

After the new temple was complete, Chavín de Huántar still embodied a U-shaped ceremonial center design. The renovations enlarged the site considerably and added a larger, sunken rectangular plaza. The main objective of the renovations appears to have been to enable more people to gather in one place, as the site in general expanded.

Excavation of burial sites has given evidence of a small elite class, whose tombs contained elaborate burial goods, consisting of precious metals, colorful textiles, and other valuables. Most burials were simpler, with bodies interred in shallow pits, dressed in cotton clothing and accompanied by a simple tool kit.

Local style in art and decoration included scrolls, simple curves, straight lines, and images of wild animals. Chavín sculpture is usually of white granite and black limestone. Carved stone mortars and pestles, conch-shell trumpets, bone tubes and spatulas, and metal spatulas and spoons were found decorated in Chavín style, as were various textiles including tapestries. Pottery was found in a wide variety of forms, including bottles and bowls, decorated with a wider range of distinctive elements.

==Social Structure==
In Chavin de Huantar the surrounding city and rural areas around the ceremonial centers show social inequalities. More gold jewelry, well-made ceramics, and higher-quality meals are available in the town east of the temple than in the village to the west. Investigations done by archaeologists show that people on both sides of the river were artists who created jewelry and other items carved out of bone. Spondylus shells, known for being precious goods at the time, were made into beads by locals who lived close to the temples. This shows an implication that artists were likely of high social status. People who lived closer to the temples were supplied with only the finest meat, usually llama meat. This llama meat was brought by the residents of the surrounding high-altitude communities. In contrast, those who lived in rural areas consumed lower-quality food and used chert tools, while those who lived in urban areas imported high-quality obsidian to create sharper blades. Llama meat could be said to be freeze-fried to produce charqui which is the inspiration for modern-day beef jerky. Llama meat was extremely important as it was eaten by almost all the inhabitants in the area. Those who lived in the western half of the town ate younger and more delectable animals as opposed to the eastern side of town, whose residents ate lower-quality meat. These clear examples of social hierarchies show the differences between the people inside of town and those who lived in rural areas. While these social differences can be seen it is impossible to say how much of this social order was changed into a class system with multiple levels. 

==Site significance==

The site was described by early 20th-century Peruvian archaeologist Julio C. Tello as &quot;the birthplace of South American culture&quot;, in recognition of its significance as a center of power for the Chavín culture, which he believed was the oldest in the highlands. Chavín de Huántar is located north of modern-day Lima at the confluence of two rivers: the Mosna and the Huanchecsa. This site allowed for easy access by the waterways and, at the same time, limited access to outsiders.

But discoveries and excavations since the late 20th century have established the older Norte Chico, also known as Caral-Supe, as the site of the first civilization in the Americas and what is now Peru. Dated to 5,000 years ago, it covered an area across four river valleys, about 100 miles north of Lima.

Chavín de Huántar is located in a lowland valley at the confluence of the Mosna and the Huanchecsa. High altitude valleys are located nearby. Consequently, the people at Chavín de Huántar were able to cultivate both lowland crops such as maize and high altitude crops such as potatoes. The people were also domesticating llamas in the high altitude areas for food and to serve as transport animals, to carry heavy loads on the steep slopes of the hills.

The religious significance of Chavín de Huántar was inspired by the geography of the site. The confluence of two large rivers has been considered to have spiritual importance in many cultures. Similarly, Chavín de Huántar was developed as a religious ceremonial center. The confluence of two rivers is referred to as &quot;tinkuy&quot;, which can be defined as the harmonious meeting of opposing forces. Chavín de Huántar likely was thought to have been a meeting place of natural and cosmic forces. The area is known to have natural hot springs and an awe-inspiring view of the Wantsan peak, both of which may have added to the religious significance of the site.

== Early religious practices ==
Archaeologists continue to debate about the likely religious practices during the peak period at Chavín de Huántar. In the 1970s Peruvian Luis Lumbreras visited the site and learned some of the oral history from the locals. They believe the word Chavín comes from the Quechua word, &quot;chaupin&quot;, meaning center, expressing its significance to local indigenous communities at the time. After investigation at the site, Lumbreas theorized that elites in the communities may have developed the ritual at the site. He also believed that they may have persuaded followers to the temple in order to maintain their political and social structure.

== 2000 to present ==
In the early 2000s John Rick and his team from Stanford University came to similar conclusions about the development of religious practices. Rick theorizes that the higher-ups (typically priests) at the temple would use deliberate techniques, material goods, and intricate architectural features to persuade and gain followers. These theories could be evidence that the temple and the priests in it exercised much power over local communities during its peak period.

Rick also studied the site with laser scanning in an effort to determine whether it was &quot;planned by an elite or had resulted from some grassroots religious fervor.&quot; The technique was used to create digital blueprints. Because details such as stair placement remain constant throughout generations of builders, the site may be a very early example of the use of a standardized building code.

Beginning in 2004, the Global Heritage Fund (GHF) began conservation work at this UNESCO World Heritage Site. Their work is also directed at supporting local training and development of skills among the residents. According to GHF, their work has involved:

CyArk has made a slideshow, maps, and 3-D multimedia presentations about Chavín de Huántar available, based on its 2005–2006 laser scanning and digital preservation project.

In 2018, Rick&#x27;s group used four-wheel-drive robots to search the temple. They discovered 30 tunnels, as well as the graves of several people buried under rocks. Further research is needed to study the human remains and any associated grave goods.

<text>:&quot;&quot;VT-05&quot; can also refer to .&quot;
The VT05 is the first free-standing CRT computer terminal from Digital Equipment Corporation introduced in 1970. Famous for its futuristic styling, the VT05 presents the user with an upper-case-only ASCII character display of 72 columns by 20 rows. The VT05 was a smart terminal that provides cursor addressing using a series of control characters, one of which allows the cursor to be positioned at an absolute location on the screen. This basic system provided the basis of similar systems in the later and greatly improved VT50 and VT52 series.

The terminal only supports forward scrolling and direct cursor addressing; no fancier editing functions are supported. No special character renditions (such as blinking, bolding, underlining, or reverse video) are supported. The VT05 supports asynchronous communication at baud rates up to 2400 bits per second (although fill characters are required above 300 bits per second).

Internally, the VT05 implements four &quot;quad-sized&quot; DEC modules in a standard form-factor DEC backplane. The cards are mounted nearly horizontally over an off-the-shelf CRT monitor. The terminal is 19&quot; wide and 30&quot; deep (much deeper than a typical desk).

The keyboard used advanced capacitive sensors, but this proved to be unreliable and later keyboards use a simple four-contact mechanical switch.

The VT05&#x27;s dynamic storage is a PMOS shift register; the delays associated with manipulating data in the shift register result in the VT05 requiring fill characters after each line feed (as compared to contemporaneous hard copy terminals which require fill characters after each carriage return).

The VT05 also has the capability of acting as a black-and-white RS-170-standard video monitor for videotape recorders, cameras, and other sources. The VT05 is equipped with a video input, and can superimpose its text over the displayed video, making it suitable for interactive video systems.

The VT05 was eventually superseded by the VT50 which itself was quickly superseded by the VT52.

==Commands==
The VT05 has a limited command set:

The screen can be cleared by sending HOME and then EOS.

<text>The 41st Field Artillery Brigade (&quot;Rail Gunners)&quot; is a Field Artillery Brigade of the United States Army. Initially only operating from October to December of 1918, it has since operated as a Brigade level staff from 1921 to 1931, 1942–1944, 1952–1969, 1972–2005, 2007–2015, and 2018 to present. It has been stationed in Virginia, Hawaii, Oklahoma, Texas, and Germany. It has served in World War II, Vietnam, Operations Desert Shield &amp; Desert Storm, Kosovo, and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

==History==
The 41st Fires Brigade traces its lineage back to the 41st Artillery Regiment (Coast Artillery Corps), a heavy artillery formation activated near the end of World War I.

The 41st Artillery was organized on 1 October 1918 at Fort Monroe, Virginia, and Archibald H. Sunderland was appointed as commander. On 22 December 1918 the unit was demobilized. On 15 January 1921, the colors were transferred to the Pacific Theater, where the 41st Artillery was reconstituted as the Hawaiian Railway Battalion. On 1 July 1924, the unit was redesignated as the 41st Coast Artillery and remained in Hawaii until its deactivation on 30 June 1931.

On 21 April 1942, the 41st Coast Artillery was re-activated, this time at Fort Hase, Hawaii, where it served until 25 May 1944. It was awarded the Asiatic Pacific Streamer for its role in World War II. At that time, it was retired from the rolls of the regular Army and incorporated into the Hawaiian Department.

On 28 June 1950, Headquarters Battery, 41st Coast Artillery was reconstituted as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 41st Field Artillery Group and was inactivated 18 January 1952 at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

In April 1967, the 41st Field Artillery Group deployed to the Republic of Vietnam, where it earned nine campaign streamers. On 15 November 1969, the Group was inactivated and its colors returned to the United States.

On 15 March 1972, the 41st Field Artillery Group was re-activated in Babenhausen, West Germany. The unit was re-designated as the 41st Field Artillery Brigade on 16 June 1982, and was assigned to V Corps Artillery. In 1999 was deployed to Albania as part of Operation Task Force Hawk to potentially perform SEAD (Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses) missions, and to act as a command and control center for all artillery units involved in the operation. In 2003, the brigade deployed with V Corps to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Following their service in Iraq, the unit was inactivated on 15 July 2005.

The 41st Fires Brigade was reactivated at Fort Hood, Texas on 16 April 2007 taking over the units of the inactivated 4th Fires Brigade.
Slightly more than one year later, the 41st Fires Brigade again deployed to the Wasit Province of Iraq where it provided security and stabilization to the people of Iraq for 14 months.

In 2014, the Army changed the name of the brigade back to 41st Field Artillery Brigade, and announced that they would change in the coming year to 1st Cavalry Division Artillery, taking up responsibility for all of the artillery assets within the division.
On 1 April 2015, 41st Field Artillery Brigade was inactivated and reflagged as the 1st Cavalry Division Artillery (United States).

On 30 November 2018, the 41st Field Artillery Brigade was re-activated at Tower Barracks, U.S. Army Garrison Bavaria, controlling the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System-equipped 1st Battalion, 6th Field Artillery Regiment and 1st Battalion, 77th Field Artillery Regiment.

In September 2020 the 1st Battalion, 77th Field Artillery Regiment was reactivated with MLRS/HIMARS dual capability.

<doc id="1220700" wikidata="Q105884533" url="?curid=1220700" title="Claudia Marcella">
<text>Claudia Marcella was the name of several women of ancient Rome of the Marcelli branch of the Claudia gens. By the late Republican period girls from this branch were often called &quot;Clodia&quot;.

A number of Marcellae are believed to have been the daughters of the consul Gaius Claudius Marcellus
* Claudia Marcella, a proposed daughter by an unknown woman, this Marcella might have been the mother of Publius Quinctilius Varus
* Claudia Marcella Major, (? - ?) oldest surviving daughter by Octavia Minor, married Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa
* Claudia Marcella Minor, (? - ?) youngest surviving daughter by Octavia Minor, grandmother of empress Messalina
* Claudia Marcella Ignota Prima, (? - ?) a daughter by Octavia Minor who died in childhood
* Claudia Marcella Ignota Secunda, (? - ?) a daughter by Octavia Minor who died in childhood
The two surviving daughters of Octavia (the sister of Roman emperor Augustus) by Marcellus became important in Augustus imperial plans. According to the Roman Historian Suetonius, they were known as &quot;the Marcellae sisters&quot; or &quot;the two Marcellae&quot;. The sisters were born in Rome and lived with their mother and their stepfather Triumvir Mark Antony in Athens, Greece. After 36 BC they accompanied their mother when she returned to Rome with their brother and half-sisters. They were raised and educated by their mother, their maternal uncle and their maternal aunt-in-marriage Roman Empress Livia Drusilla. They and their siblings provided a critical link between the past of the Roman Republic and the new Roman Empire. The marriages of the sisters and the children born to their unions assured republican family lines into the next generation.

A number of other women could have been Marcellae:
*Claudia, last wife of Quintus Lutatius Catulus may have been a Marcella if she was she was likely a daughter of Gaius Marius&#x27; friend and legate Marcus Claudius Marcellus.
* Clodia, wife of Decimus Junius Brutus Callaicus and mother of Decimus Junius Brutus may have been a Marcella.
* The wife of Publius Autronius Paetus may have been a Marcella.

<doc id="1220709" wikidata="Q7899414" url="?curid=1220709" title="Uptown, Minneapolis">
<text>Uptown is a commercial district in southwestern Minneapolis in the U.S. state of Minnesota, that is centered at the intersection of Hennepin Avenue and West Lake Street. It has traditionally spanned the corners of four neighborhoods, Lowry Hill East, East Bde Maka Ska, South Uptown and East Isles neighborhoods, which are all within the Calhoun Isles community. Historically, the boundaries of Uptown are Bde Maka Ska (formerly Lake Calhoun) to the west, Dupont Avenue to the east, 31st Street to the south, and 28th Street to the north; though these borders often vary. Uptown is a popular destination for retail, nightlife, and cultural events, and the district was famously written about by recording artist Prince.

==History==
The Lakes Area of Bde Maka Ska, Lake Harriet, and Lake of the Isles became popular in the 1880s as vacation cottages, hotels, and boating recreation became available by streetcar. As Minneapolis expanded south, housing construction boomed through the 1920s. A commercial district began forming just east of the Lakes Area. At the intersection of Hennepin Avenue and Lagoon Avenue, the Lagoon Theatre was built, a multi-function vaudeville theater. When the Lagoon burnt down in 1939, owners sought to rebuild and the business community took the opportunity to rebrand the area. Following the success of Chicago&#x27;s Uptown District, the Minneapolis Tribune announced the new Uptown District of Minneapolis centered on the newly renamed Uptown Theatre.
Through the 20th century, Uptown was primarily a family area centered around nearby West High School at Hennepin and West 28th Street. Modest housing along Lowry Hill met the mansions of Kenwood to the west and around the lakes. Hennepin flourished as a commercial corridor and route from downtown to residential homes, while Uptown served also as an important streetcar route from Uptown to the vacation homes of Lake Minnetonka. White flight via the freeway system after World War II and closing of West High School in 1982 (razed in 1984) signaled a demographic shift in the area. Blight and crime began moving into Lowry Hill though were kept at bay by the Kenwood area. Neighborhood associations and formal borders were designated in the 1970s as each section of Uptown began addressing domestic problems.

During this time, Uptown developed an artist culture. The history of this culture is preserved in the annual Uptown Art Fair. In 1980, Minneapolis musician Prince released his seminal album &quot;Dirty Mind&quot;, which contained his paean to these artists, appropriately titled &quot;Uptown&quot;. In the 1990s he opened &quot;New Power Generation,&quot; a retail store at 1408 West Lake Street, and in 1998 released &quot;Calhoun Square,&quot; a song written in 1993, on his Crystal Ball album. A retail renaissance of the area occurred in the 1980s when Seven Points (formerly named Calhoun Square) was developed. Combining a half block of existing storefront buildings plus new construction, the renovation turned the area into a competitive retail draw from Downtown and from the suburban dales (malls). As the popularity of Uptown as a residential district grew again, the definition of the area expanded.

The Lake Street Council launched a Museum In the Streets project, a series of free, self-guided walking tours highlighting business districts along Lake Street, including Uptown. The Uptown Tour spotlights historic businesses and places in the neighborhood, including the origins of Abdallah Candies, Schlampp &amp; Sons Furriers, and the Uptown Theater.

The neighborhood experienced civil unrest in the aftermath of the killing of Winston Boogie Smith by law enforcement officers on June 3, 2021. Smith, a 32-year-old black American man, allegedly fired a gun as they attempted to apprehend him in a parking ramp belonging to Seven Points near West Lake Street and Girard Avenue. Protests were held over subsequent weeks with demonstrators periodically occupying a street intersection and nearby vacant lot near where Smith was killed, until eventually said lot was fenced off. On the night of June 13, a demonstrator, Deona Knajdek, was killed when a vehicle rammed into a street demonstration.

==Culture==
Uptown is a mix of various cultural strains and is considered an area for young people to live and shop. It was formerly known as a vibrant center for artists and musicians, a center for Counterculture, and hippies, similar to East Village, Manhattan. The artist community was popularized by the musician Prince, who started his career in Uptown. The area has experienced gentrification, and is no longer considered the bohemian area it once was. Many of the older buildings and long-standing businesses in the area have closed or been torn down due to gentrification. But the area is still considered vibrant and walkable.

This area has a vast variety of ethnic food and grocery stores from Asian to Mexican to middle eastern. Uptown&#x27;s more than 20 bars within a three-block radius draw people from across the metro area to revel in the district. Uptown seems to draw a &quot;slightly older and &#x27;more sophisticated&#x27;&quot; clientele compared to the Warehouse District. Controversy about noise, particularly surrounding bar&#x27;s rooftop patios. In 2011 City Council Member Meg Tuthill wrote a noise ordinance to address the issue, but it was afterwards withdrawn.

The area annually hosts the Uptown Art Fair, during the first full weekend of August. Local, national, and world artists converge to exhibit and sell fine art. Art media include paintings, sculptures, clothing, pottery, jewelry, glass, and mixed media.

==Demographics==
As of 2000 the current population for Uptown Minneapolis was 30,564 of which 15,947 are male and 14,617 are female. The population consists of 19,314 Caucasians, 4,930 African-Americans, 4,729 Hispanics, 1,630 Asians, 514 Native Americans, and 32 native Hawaiian. Fewer than 3,600 of this population are children under 5 and citizens over the age of 65. The median age is 29 years old. The majority age of this area is people 18 years and older. The average household size is 2.05 while the average family size is 3.19. Uptown Minneapolis has a total of 15,033

The median household income is $34,216.00, the median family income is $38,634.00.

==Economy==
Uptown is renowned for its lively arts and entertainment options that feature many restaurants, stores, night clubs, bars, and theaters. In the 2000s, however, the neighborhoods surrounding Uptown have seen a surge in gentrification. This has caused an increase in property value and in property taxes.

==Transportation==
The Uptown Transit Station is located on Hennepin Avenue over the 29th Street Greenway and serves Metro Transit buses 6, 12, 17, 21, 23, 53, 114 and 115. The station also has a change machine, a heated interior, binoculars, bike lockers and posts, and a workers lounge and office area. The Midtown Greenway, a former railway cutting which now hosts a bike path, bisects Uptown two blocks north of Lake Street adjacent to 29th Street.

<doc id="1220722" wikidata="Q1318356" url="?curid=1220722" title="Just Whitney">
<text>Just Whitney is the fifth studio album by American singer and actress Whitney Houston, released on November 27, 2002, by Arista Records. It was her first studio album to be released after her greatest hits compilation, &quot;&quot; (2000), and the follow-up to her multi-platinum fourth studio album, &quot;My Love is Your Love&quot; (1998). &quot;Just Whitney&quot; was also Houston&#x27;s first to be released after re-signing her contract with Arista in 2001 for $100 million - the largest recording contract for a female artist at the time.

In the United States, &quot;Just Whitney&quot; debuted at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number three on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, with sales of 205,147 copies in the first week. That beat the previous high first-week sales of 177,284 copies with the &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; soundtrack, and also logged her highest debut sales out of her Nielsen SoundScan-era albums at the time of its release.

The album spawned four singles (in order), &quot;Whatchulookinat&quot;, &quot;One of Those Days&quot;, &quot;Try It on My Own&quot;, and &quot;Love That Man&quot;, with the first, third and fifth singles peaking at number one on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance Club Songs chart. &quot;Try It on My Own&quot; also peaked at number ten on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult Contemporary chart while &quot;One of Those Days&quot; topped the Adult R&amp;B Songs chart. &quot;Just Whitney&quot; has sold over 2.5 million copies worldwide and has also earned Platinum certification in the United States and Switzerland, and Gold in France, Brazil and other countries. In 2003, the album was nominated at the Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards in the category for Best R&amp;B/Soul Album of the Year.

==Background and production==
&quot;Just Whitney&quot; is Houston&#x27;s fifth studio album, that she recorded after renewing her contract with Arista for a record $100 million. It is mixed with R&amp;B ballads, R&amp;B mid-tempo numbers, and dance songs. It also includes a rock song, &quot;Tell Me No&quot;. Houston said that she wanted to make a &quot;very soul oriented&quot; album, something she felt was missing on the radio. It was somewhat a departure from her previous studio album &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot;, which was blended with R&amp;B, hip hop, and reggae.

She worked with Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds, with whom she had worked with previously, and Kevin &quot;She&#x27;kspere&quot; Briggs. Other producers included Missy Elliott, Teddy Bishop, Gordon Chambers, Rob Fusari, and Troy Taylor. Her then-husband, recording artist Bobby Brown, also co-produced one of the songs.

According to Houston,

She also said that she wanted to give something to the fans, songs which they can sing along to and love the melody. She also incorporated samples into her songs such as in &quot;One of Those Days&quot; ㅡ album&#x27;s second single, which sampled The Isley Brothers&#x27; song &quot;Between the Sheets&quot;. She also covered Debby Boone&#x27;s classic &quot;You Light Up My Life&quot;. The album also contains the rock-influenced &quot;Tell Me No&quot;, which was produced by Babyface, who also produced some other songs on the album including the ballad &quot;Try It on My Own&quot; and dance-pop song &quot;Love That Man&quot; ㅡ both of which became singles. The song &quot;Whatchulookinat&quot; was produced by Brown and Mohammad 2G and became the project&#x27;s lead single. The song, co-written by Houston, was taken by critics as an answer to the media for deeply invading her personal life.

==Critical reception==

Upon its release, &quot;Just Whitney&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, with aggregated reviews on Metacritic awarding the album 53 out of 100. Craig Seymour of &quot;Atlanta Journal and Constitution&quot; gave the album a favorable review stating, &quot;On &quot;Just Whitney&quot;, Houston comes off as warm, lucid, open, and sharp. Keysha Davis of BBC gave a favorable review commenting, &quot;With one of the exceptional voices in contemporary music, her latest album, aptly titled &quot;Just Whitney&quot; sees the diva return to her former glory with a combination of high-voltage ballads and smooth-liqueur R&amp;B. [...] Whitney&#x27;s return to big ballads will hopefully ensure that this pop princess will be able to lead the rest of her life like a clichéd fairy tale - happily ever after.&quot; Mike Bell from Jam! Showbiz, was also favorable in his review, saying &quot;Maybe because of everything that&#x27;s happened in her past, maybe because of the sideshow, she has the ability to give the songs real feeling, real life.&quot; In addition, he stated that her voice was in fine form, &quot;showcasing those incredible pipes that launched a thousand imitators.&quot; He concluded by saying, &quot;And it shows up all of those followers with recent releases ㅡ including Mariah Carey and Celine Dion ㅡ because not only does Houston have the lungs, but she has the soul.&quot;

Jon Pareles of &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Ms. Houston&#x27;s voice sails and spirals through breathy ballads, staccato constructions and big-build anthems; she&#x27;s strategic and improvisatory at the same time.&quot; He summarized by saying that even when she&#x27;s seething, she&#x27;s graceful. Angus Batey from Yahoo! Music UK &amp; Ireland graded the album seven stars out of ten commenting, &quot;[...] this is a cogent, compact and really quite good record, one that mixes upbeat, perhaps slightly clinical R&amp;B with uber-ballads and occasional snatches of what appears to be an attempt at intimacy.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic commented that &quot;Just Whitney&quot; was &quot;an assertion that she&#x27;s returning to her basics.&quot; He also said that &quot;It would be a good standard-issue Whitney album if it wasn&#x27;t for her disarming, defensive attempt to defuse every rumor hurled in her direction.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; reviewed the album commenting that &quot;&quot;Just Whitney&quot; appears and sounds more like a work-in-progress than a finished disk.&quot; Steve Jones of &quot;USA Today&quot; graded the album fairly well, giving it two-and-half stars out of four, but stating, &quot;At her best, Houston is full of sass and attitude and, most of all, joy. But with so much emphasis on what&#x27;s bothering her, you can&#x27;t help but wonder whether the thrill is gone.&quot; According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the album takes &quot;a musical step backwards&quot;. Tom Sinclair of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; graded the album a solid B− and noted that &quot;Just Whitney&quot; had quite a refreshingly &quot;old-school vibe.&quot; He commented, &quot;Whatever her personal problems, our gal sounds plucky and on top of her game. Still, in her third decade as a diva, Houston remains a formidable role model for &quot;American Idol&quot; wannabes.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
On the week ending December 28, 2002, &quot;Just Whitney&quot; debuted and peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number three on Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.

Since its release, the album has 737,000 copies in the USA. In its Billboard Year End chart in December 2003, the album ranked 101st place in the Top Billboard 200 Albums list and 30th place in the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums list.

In Australia, the album reached number 22 on the ARIA Urban Albums Chart. The album debuted at number 85 on the Canadian Albums chart, selling 3,000 copies in its first week.

==Singles==
The album saw the release of five official singles - two preceding and three succeeding the album&#x27;s release.

&quot;Whatchulookinat&quot; became the album&#x27;s lead single released on September 17, 2002. The song received mixed to unfavorable reviews from critics. The single became a moderate success worldwide, peaking inside the top forty in most countries. In the US, it became her tenth Hot Dance Club Play topper. The corresponding music video was also considered as Houston&#x27;s answer to the media for getting too deep into her personal life. The video showed a white set with cameras all over, following Houston&#x27;s every move. The set was also full with old movie cameras and people dressed as reporters and photographers. Houston is shown dancing in front of them.

&quot;One of Those Days&quot; was the album&#x27;s second single and was released on October 29, 2002. The song received many positive reviews from critics. It sampled The Isley Brothers&#x27; song &quot;Between the Sheets&quot;. The single was a moderate success in the US. The accompanying music video&#x27;s plot revolved around Houston and her friends, having a day for themselves and going to the club at night. 

&quot;Try It on My Own&quot; became the project&#x27;s third single and was released on February 11, 2003. The song received acclaim from critics as well as fans; most of them who named it as the album&#x27;s highlight. The song, like its predecessors, was a moderate success and topped &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. It also reached the top ten on the US Adult Contemporary chart. Internationally, the song performed fair. A music video was released to promote the single.

&quot;My Love&quot; was released to urban adult contemporary radio as the album&#x27;s fourth single on March 10, 2003. It became a moderate hit reaching number 39 on Billboard&#x27;s Adult R&amp;B Songs chart.

&quot;Love That Man&quot; was the fifth and final single from the album, released on May 20, 2003. It became another Dance Club chart-topping single, but failed to make the Hot 100. No accompanying video was released for the single.

==Promotion==
To promote the album, Houston appeared on the 2002 MTV Europe Music Awards, performing her new single &quot;Whatchulookinat&quot;. She also appeared on the 2003 &quot;VH1 Divas Duets: An Honors Concert for the VH1 Save the Music Foundation&quot; and performed her hits including two songs from the album; &quot;My Love&quot; and &quot;Try It on My Own&quot;. Apart from these, she also performed &quot;One of Those Days&quot; and &quot;Tell Me No&quot; live on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. No major tours were arranged to support the album.

<doc id="1220729" wikidata="Q3233815" url="?curid=1220729" title="The Belly and the Members">
<text>The Belly and the Members is one of Aesop&#x27;s Fables and is numbered 130 in the Perry Index. It has been interpreted in varying political contexts over the centuries.

==The Fable==

There are several versions of the fable. In early Greek sources it concerns a dispute between the stomach and the feet, or between it and the hands and feet in later Latin versions. These grumble because the stomach gets all of the food, refusing to supply them with nourishment. They see sense when they realise that they are weakening themselves. In Mediaeval versions, the rest of the body becomes so weakened that it dies, and later illustrations almost uniformly portray an enfeebled man expiring on the ground. The present understanding is that the tale&#x27;s moral supports team effort and recognition of the vital part that all members play in it. In more authoritarian times, however, the fable was taken to affirm direction from the centre.

Research points to early Eastern fables dealing with similar disputes. Most notably there is a fragmentary Egyptian papyrus going back to the 2nd millennium BCE that belongs to the Near Eastern genre of debate poems; in this case the dispute is between the Belly and the Head. It is thus among the first known examples of the body politic metaphor.

==Later applications==
There is a scriptural use of the concept of co-operation between the various parts of the body by Paul of Tarsus, who was educated in both Hebrew and Hellenic thought. In his first letter to the Corinthians, he shifts away from the fable&#x27;s political application and gives it the spiritual context of the body of the Church. The metaphor is used to argue that this body represents a multiplicity of talents co-operating together. While there may still be a hierarchy within it, all are to be equally valued for the part they play:

:For the body is not one member, but many. If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body? And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body? If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. And if they were all one member, where were the body? But now are they many members, yet but one body. And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary. And those members of the body which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour. (Authorised Version 12.14–23)

The Latin historian Livy leads the way in applying the fable to civil unrest. It is recounted by him in the context of the Aventine secession in 495–93 BCE that a member of the Roman Senate convinced the plebeians, who had left Rome in protest at their mistreatment by the patricians, to return by telling the story. In this politicised form, with the patricians playing the part of the stomach, the fable formed an &quot;exemplary paradigm&quot; for the subsequent Roman philosophy of the body politic. The same fable was later repeated in Plutarch&#x27;s Life of Coriolanus.
:&quot;It once happened,&quot; Menenius Agrippa said, &quot;that all the other members of a man mutinied against the stomach, which they accused as the only idle, uncontributing part the whole body, while the rest were put to hardships and the expense of much labour to supply and minister to its appetites. The stomach, however, merely ridiculed the silliness of the members, who appeared not to be aware that the stomach certainly does receive the general nourishment, but only to return it again, and redistribute it amongst the rest. Such is the case,&quot; he said, &quot;ye citizens, between you and the senate. The counsels and plans that are there duly digested, convey and secure to all of you your proper benefit and support.&quot;

From this source it was taken by William Shakespeare and dramatised in the opening scene of his play &quot;Coriolanus&quot;.

In French sources the story was similarly applied. The late 12th century version by Marie de France concludes with the feudal reflection that &#x27;no one has honour who shames his lord, nor has the sire unless he honours his men&#x27;. Near the end of the 14th century, Eustache Deschamps deplored civil war in a ballade titled &quot;Comment le chief et les membres doyvent amer l&#x27;un l&#x27;autre&quot; (How the head and members should love one another). This used the fable to argue that the land is weakened when feudal obligations are transgressed. The head should not oppress those under him and in turn should be obeyed. Three centuries later La Fontaine interpreted the fable in terms of the absolute monarchy of his time. Reversing the order of the ancient historians, he starts with the fable, draws a lengthy moral and only then gives the context in which it was first told. For him the royal power is central to and the sustainer of the state.
This was so too for John Ogilby in the context of the troubled history of 17th century England. The only member on view in Wenceslas Hollar&#x27;s illustration of the fable (see above) is the broken head of a statue damaged by the blind, sword-wielding belly. The reference to the Parliamentary beheading of King Charles I and the breakdown of government during the subsequent republican period could not be clearer. At the start of the 19th century, La Fontaine&#x27;s English translator, John Matthews, was to expand the fable to even greater length. Beginning with the Roman context, he pictures the social strife in more or less contemporary terms and so hints that the fable supports the power of the aristocratic parliament of his day without needing to say so outright.

Ambrose Bierce applied the fable to labour disputes in his &quot;Fantastic Fables&quot; (1899). When the workers at a shoe factory go on strike for better conditions, in his satirical rewriting, the owner sets it on fire in order to collect the insurance and so leaves them workless. A slightly earlier Japanese woodblock print by Kawanabe Kyosai in his &quot;Isoho Monogotari&quot; series (1870–80) had also given the fable a commercial application. Titled &quot;The lazy one in the middle&quot;, it shows the seated belly smoking a pipe while the disjointed bodily members crawl on the floor about him. His broad tie is labelled &#x27;Financier&#x27; in western lettering to drive home the point. In both these cases the argument of the centre as sustainer is turned around. Far from keeping the members alive, the belly&#x27;s selfish concerns and greedy demands sap them of energy.

<text>Mariah Carey is the debut studio album by American R&amp;B singer Mariah Carey, released on June 12, 1990, by Columbia Records. Its music incorporates a range of contemporary genres with a mix of slow ballads and up-tempo tracks. Originally, Carey wrote four songs with Ben Margulies, which solely constituted her demo tape. After Carey was signed to Columbia, all four songs, after being altered and partially re-recorded, made the final cut for the album. Aside from Margulies, Carey worked with a range of professional writers and producers, all of whom were hired by Columbia CEO, Tommy Mottola. &quot;Mariah Carey&quot; featured production and writing from Rhett Lawrence, Ric Wake and Narada Michael Walden, all of whom were top record producers at the time. Together with Carey, they conceived the album and reconstructed her original demo tape.

&quot;Mariah Carey&quot; generally received positive reviews, with critics praising Carey&#x27;s vocal performance and technique, but were ambivalent towards the songwriting. It became a commercial success, topping the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart for 11 consecutive weeks. &quot;Mariah Carey&quot; was certified nine-times Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of nine million copies in the United States. The album experienced similar success in Canada, where it topped the charts and was certified seven times Platinum. &quot;Mariah Carey&quot; fared well in other worldwide territories, reaching the top ten in Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Worldwide, the album has sold more than 15 million copies.

Five singles were released from the album, four of which became number-one hits on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Her debut single, &quot;Vision of Love&quot; was chosen as the album&#x27;s lead single, topping the charts in Canada, New Zealand and the United States. The song was critically lauded, and is regarded as one of the greatest debut singles by a female artist. With the following three singles, &quot;Love Takes Time&quot;, &quot;Someday&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Cry&quot; reaching number one in the U.S., Carey became the first artist since The Jackson 5 to have their first four singles top the charts in the United States.

== Background ==
In 1988, a 19-year-old Carey moved out of her mother&#x27;s house in Long Island, and into a small apartment in Manhattan. She had a demo tape consisting of four songs, which she had written during her high school years with Ben Margulies. As 1988 unfolded, Carey, still without a record deal, struggled to draw the attention of record executives in New York. While working several jobs, she continued writing and producing music with Margulies, making changes and additions to the demo. After months of difficulty, Carey met with singer Brenda K. Starr, and soon began singing back-up for her. Eventually, Starr began hearing what she described as &quot;glimpses&quot; of Carey&#x27;s voice throughout sessions, and noticed her &quot;gifted voice&quot;. She realized Carey was capable of achieving success, but only needed help to break through into mainstream music.

One night, Starr took Carey to a record industry gala, attempting to convince a record label executive to listen her demo. Jerry L. Greenberg, president of Atlantic Records took notice of her. As Carey handed him the record, Tommy Mottola quickly grabbed the tape, insisting that he would deal with &quot;the project&quot;. As Mottola got into his limousine later that evening, he played Carey&#x27;s demo and quickly realized the talent that he had just discovered. He quickly returned to the event, but a discouraged Carey had already left.

After a week of tracking her down through Starr&#x27;s management, Mottola got in touch with Carey and brought her over to Columbia Records. After meeting with Carey and her mother Patricia for the first time, Mottola said, &quot;When I heard and saw Mariah, there was absolutely no doubt that she was in every way destined for super-stardom.&quot; After a few brief meetings, Carey was signed to Columbia in December 1988.

Mottola had assumed the top position at Sony, the parent label of Columbia, and began taking the company through various stages of change. One he felt was very important for the label&#x27;s success was to discover a young and very talented female vocalist, to rival Whitney Houston from Arista Records, or a pop star to match Madonna, who was signed to Sire Records at the time. He felt that Carey represented both. Mottola&#x27;s confidence in Carey led him to hire a range of talented and well-known musicians and songwriters to assist with Carey&#x27;s demo, as well as to create new material. Among them were Ric Wake, Narada Michael Walden and Rhett Lawrence.

== Recording and composition ==

 Carey and Ben Margulies began writing prior to Carey&#x27;s signing, and had composed over fourteen songs; seven of which earned a place on the album. Originally, Carey and Margulies planned to produce the entire album as well, an idea her label did not permit. On the album, Carey worked with a range of producers and writers, including from Ben Margulies, Rhett Lawrence, Narada Michael Walden, Ric Wake and Walter Afanasieff; the latter would continue working extensively with Carey on future projects. As production for the album began, Carey worked with Walden in New York, where they produced &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Cry&quot;. While he described Carey as &quot;very shy&quot;, he noted how professional she was for someone her age. Additionally, Carey wrote &quot;There&#x27;s Got to Be a Way&quot; during her first recording session with Wake. During the session, they wrote four songs, but they only produced the latter song for the album. After flying to New York and working with Carey, Walden was astonished by her voice. Together, they collaborated on transforming many of the demo&#x27;s songs into more commercial recordings, which took place in Tarpan Studios in San Rafael, California. For her work with Lawrence, Carey traveled to New York once again. In the studio, she presented him with the demo of &quot;Vision of Love&quot; which she had written with Margulies years prior. Lawrence saw &quot;potential&quot; in the song, but he did not think much of it in its early stages. He described the song&#x27;s sound as having a &quot;fifties sort of shuffle&quot;. According to Lawrence, Carey needed a more contemporary sound, so they met in the studio alongside Margulies and producer Chris Toland. They added a new arrangement to the original chord progression, while Carey changed the song&#x27;s melody and key. Afterwards, Margulies added few drum notes to the arrangement, including additional guitar and bass notes.

When Carey worked with Walden on &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Cry&quot;, they worked on several other songs. Together, they decided to &quot;slow down the tempo&quot; and create a &quot;crying type of ballad&quot;, one which according to him, featured a direct inspiration from gospel genres. After they completed the song, Lawrence noted how much of a perfectionist Carey was. He said that after finishing the song, she returned to the studio the following week, all in order to correct &quot;one line&quot; that troubled her. As one of the four original songs she gave to Mottola, &quot;Someday&quot; became Wake&#x27;s favorite from the start, &quot;I loved that song right from the beginning...Then Mariah called me one day and said &#x27;I&#x27;d love to do it if you want to do it.&#x27; It was great, I&#x27;m glad she called me.&quot; During its recording, Carey revealed how the song came into existence. She had been working on the demo with Margulies in his studio. As he began playing different notes on the electric keyboard, Carey directed him on the chord changes, while providing the chorus, lyrics and melody. In &quot;All in Your Mind&quot;, Carey does a great vocal performance, doing staccatos up to F7. According to the artist, her voice &quot;split&quot; while doing those ornaments. While she thought to remove it from the song&#x27;s recording, Wake and Walden were very impressed by the vocal flips, claiming that it would fit in perfectly.

The debut album was completed and being mastered when Carey wrote &quot;Love Takes Time&quot; with Ben Margulies. Margulies said, &quot;It was sort of a gospelish thing I was improvising, then we began working on it. It was on a work tape that we had...and we recorded a very quick demo. It was just a piano vocal demo – I played live piano, and she sang it.&quot;
Carey was on a mini-tour of ten states, playing acoustically with a piano player and three back-up singers. While on a company plane, she played the demo of &quot;Love Takes Time&quot; for Columbia Records president Don Ienner. &quot;All the important guys were on the plane,&quot; Margulies said. &quot;Tommy Mottola, Ienner, and Bobby Colomby.&quot; Carey was told the song was a &quot;career-maker&quot;, and that it had to go on the first album. She protested – her album was already being mastered, and she intended this ballad for her next release.

The demo was sent to producer Afanasieff. When Carey flew west to work with Narada Michael Walden on some tracks for her first album, Tommy Mottola and Don Ienner were impressed with Afanasieff&#x27;s work and gave him an executive staff producer job with the label. &quot;I guess to see if he made the right choice, (Tommy) called me up one day,&quot; remembers Afanasieff. &quot;He said, &#x27;We&#x27;ve got this Mariah Carey album done, but there&#x27;s a song that she and Ben Margulies wrote that is phenomenal, and I want to try everything we can to put it on the album.&#x27; I said, &#x27;What do you want me to do?&#x27; and he said, &#x27;You only have a couple of days, but are you ready to cut it?&#x27; I couldn&#x27;t believe the opportunity that it was. I&#x27;d never produced anything by myself up until that time.&quot;

The demo was very close to what Mottola wanted the finished product to be, according to Afanasieff. &quot;We cut the song and the music and the basics in about a day – and the only reason is this deadline. It was do it or we were gonna miss out on the whole thing. We got the tape and recorded everything and we got on the plane and went to New York (and) did her vocals. She did all the backgrounds, practically sang all night...We came back to the studio that afternoon, and we had to fix one line very quickly, and then (engineer) Dana (Jon Chapelle) and I got back on the plane with the tape, went back to the studio in Sausalito, and mixed it. So it was a three-day process: a day and a half for music, kind of like a day for vocals, and a day for mixing.&quot;

Afanasieff heard from Columbia executives as soon as they received the mix. They wanted Carey&#x27;s vocal a little louder, so a remix was quickly completed. The producer asked if the song would still make the debut album, and was told, &quot;We&#x27;re going to do our best.&quot;

On the first copies of the album that were printed, &quot;Love Takes Time&quot; was not listed on the cassette or compact disc liner notes, even though the song was on the cassette or CD itself. &quot;(On) some of the original first copies of the record, they didn&#x27;t have time to print the name of the song,&quot; Margulies laughs. &quot;And so the song&#x27;s on there, but it doesn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s on there. It was a song that actually was strong enough to stop the pressing...I don&#x27;t know if they had to throw away a few hundred copies.&quot;

== Promotion ==

Aside from the heavy marketing and promotional campaign held by Sony Music, Carey performed on several television programs and award ceremonies, stateside and throughout Europe. Carey&#x27;s first televised appearance was at &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, where she sang &quot;Vision of Love&quot; for the first time, on June 1, 1990. Four days after the performance, she appeared at the 1990 NBA Playoffs where she sang &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;. Soon after, she performed &quot;Vision of Love&quot; back-to-back on both &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and her second appearance at &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;. In September 1990, Carey appeared on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; where she performed an a cappella version of &quot;Vision of Love&quot;, alongside the Billy T. Scott Ensemble. &quot;Vision of Love&quot; was performed on various other American television shows such as &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot;, &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and the 1991 Grammy Awards, as well as European programs such as &quot;The Veronica Countdown&quot; (the Netherlands), &quot;Le monde est la vous&quot; (France), &quot;Kulan&quot; (Sweden) and &quot;Wogan&quot; (United Kingdom). Carey has performed &quot;Vision of Love&quot; on most of her tours, except her Angels Advocate Tour in 2010, where it was absent from the setlist.

Promotion for the album continued with Carey&#x27;s follow-up singles. &quot;Love Takes Time&quot; was performed on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, &quot;Showtime at the Apollo&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, as well as Carey&#x27;s debut showcase at The Tattoo Club. In Europe, &quot;Love Takes Time&quot; was also performed in &quot;Pop Formule&quot; (the Netherlands), &quot;Kulan&quot; (Sweden) and &quot;Des O&#x27;Connor Tonight&quot; (United Kingdom). The third single from &quot;Mariah Carey&quot;, &quot;Someday&quot;, was performed at the 1991 American Music Awards which helped it reach number one in the United States. Carey&#x27;s fourth single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Cry&quot;, reached the top of the Hot 100 without any immediate promotion, as Carey had not performed the song until her Music Box Tour in 1993. As promotion for &quot;Mariah Carey&quot; ended, Sony released a fifth single &quot;There&#x27;s Got to Be a Way&quot;, in the UK. Most of the album&#x27;s singles were performed live throughout Carey&#x27;s short Music Box Tour. Both &quot;Vision of Love&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Cry&quot; were performed on Carey&#x27;s Asian and European Daydream World Tour (1996).

=== Singles ===
&quot;Vision of Love&quot; was the first single released from the album and became one of the most popular and critically praised songs of Carey&#x27;s career. Additionally, &quot;Vision of Love&quot; is credited with bringing the use of melisma to the 1990s and inspiring various future talents. &quot;Vision of Love&quot; was nominated for three 1991 Grammy Awards: Best Female Pop Vocal Performance (which it won), Record of the Year and Song of the Year. The song received the Soul Train Music Award for Best R&amp;B/Soul Single, Female and a Songwriter Award at the BMI Pop Awards. In the United States, it peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, during the week of August 2, 1990, staying atop the chart for four consecutive weeks. &quot;Vision of Love&quot; reached number one in Canada and New Zealand as well, and appeared within the top ten in Australia, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Aside from its chart success, the song was lauded by music critics. In a retrospective review on the album in 2005, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the song &quot;inspired&quot; and complimented Carey&#x27;s use of the whistle register in the song. Additionally, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that &quot;the fluttering strings of notes that decorate songs like &#x27;Vision of Love&#x27;, inspired the entire &quot;American Idol&quot; vocal school, for better or worse, and virtually every other female R&amp;B singer since the nineties.&quot; Bill Lamb from About.com said that &quot;&#x27;Vision of Love&#x27; is one of the best songs of Mariah&#x27;s recording career [...] It is simply one of the most stunning debut releases ever by a pop recording artist.&quot;

&quot;Love Takes Time&quot; served as the album&#x27;s second single, released on August 22, 1990. The song became Carey&#x27;s second single to top the Billboard Hot 100. While the song achieved strong success stateside, &quot;Love Takes Time&quot; peaked at number two in Canada, it barely charted inside the top ten in New Zealand and outside the top 20 in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. &quot;Someday&quot; (the album&#x27;s third single) followed a similar pattern as &quot;Love Takes Time&quot;, reaching number one in the US and Canada. In Australia, it peaked outside the top 40, and hit number 38 in France and the UK. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Cry&quot;, the album&#x27;s fourth single, also topped the charts in the United States. The song became Carey&#x27;s fourth chart topper in the US, finishing number 25 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; year-end chart. Aside from peaking at number two in Canada, it charted at number 49 in Australia. A fifth single, &quot;There&#x27;s Got to Be a Way&quot;, was released in Europe but only charted in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number fifty-four.

== Critical reception ==

In a contemporary review, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that Carey possessed an &quot;astonishing vocal range and high ideals&quot;, but criticized the album&#x27;s lyrical content. Robert Christgau was more critical in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, unenthusiastically touching on the opera roots of Carey&#x27;s mother while finding much of the material clueless about its love themes. Jan DeKnock from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; was more impressed by the album, finding it abundant with &quot;sparkling tracks&quot; that showcase Carey&#x27;s songwriting and production talents, particularly &quot;Vanishing&quot;. &quot;Mariah Carey&quot; was nominated for the 1991 Grammy Award for Album of the Year, while &quot;Vision of Love&quot; received nominations in the categories of Song of the Year, Record of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Carey won for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and also received the award for Best New Artist.

===Retrospective===

In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Arion Berger later wrote that &quot;Carey debuted with an album of uplifting dance pop and R&amp;B ballads, each song&#x27;s composition co-credited to Carey and each providing an opportunity to unleash her wide vocal range.&quot; Ashley S. Battel from AllMusic found the record &quot;extremely impressive&quot; and described the songs as &quot;smooth-sounding ballads and uplifting dance/R&amp;B cuts&quot; on an album that served &quot;as a springboard for future successes&quot;. &quot;Carey establishes a strong standard of comparison for other breakthrough artists of this genre&quot;, Battel concluded.

=== Accolades ===
== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Mariah Carey&quot; entered the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 80, and reached the top 20 in its fourth week. The album topped the chart in its 36th week, due to the success of &quot;Someday&quot; and then later Carey&#x27;s exposure at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards, and stayed there for 11 consecutive weeks; to date, it is the longest stay at number one in Carey&#x27;s career. It remained in the top 20 for 65 weeks and on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 113 weeks. &quot;Mariah Carey&quot; was certified nine-times Platinum by the RIAA on December 15, 1999.

Worldwide sales of the album stand at 15 million copies.

== Legacy and influence ==
Since its release, &quot;Mariah Carey&quot; has been hailed as being a pop and R&amp;B classic, with Trevor Anderson of &quot;Billboard&quot; describing it as jumpstarting &quot;one of the most successful stories in pop music history&quot;. Commenting on the success of the album in the &quot;particularly saturated female pop landscape in 1990&quot;, Anderson further states that the record helped Carey carve a place as the foremost musician of her generation.

The widespread influence of Carey&#x27;s vocal delivery on the album, particularly &quot;Vision of Love&quot;, has also been noted by critics. Writing for &quot;Complex&quot;, Elena Bergeron described the record as &quot;the album that launched a million runs&quot;, stating that it &quot;gave an entire generation of would-be divas something to sing into their hairbrushes&quot;. R&amp;B singer Beyoncé said that she began doing vocal &quot;runs&quot; after listening to &quot;Vision of Love&quot; for the first time, stating that it inspired her to follow a path into the music industry. Pop singer Christina Aguilera has also stated how Carey&#x27;s album had the biggest influence on her vocal stylings and delivery. According to the Pier Dominguez, author of &quot;Christina Aguilera: A Star is Made&quot;, Carey&#x27;s carefully choreographed image of a grown woman struck a chord with Aguilera, whose influence also stemmed from the fact that both were of mixed heritage.

Carey&#x27;s two wins at the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards was also commented upon by critics, particularly in regards to the lip-syncing controversy surrounding Milli Vanilli the prior year. Speaking to the press after winning Best New Artist, Carey stated: &quot;With all the controversy surrounding this award, I hope to bring it back to a real singer-songwriter category, where everyone else following me can be as proud as I am to receive this honor&quot;. The singer&#x27;s performance of &quot;Vision of Love&quot; at the ceremony has consistently been ranked as one of the greatest award show performances of all time. Andrew Unterberger of &quot;Billboard&quot; described it as showcasing Carey &quot;in full beast mode, tracing her unprecedented vocal runs with her hands and occasionally running out of room in the process; not excessively showy but unafraid of demonstrating&quot;. Unterberger further commented on Carey&#x27;s exposure to the wider pop landscape following her debut at the award show, commenting on how &quot;Mariah&#x27;s self-titled debut LP shot to the top of the Billboard 200 and stayed there for 11 weeks&quot; in the wake of her appearance.

The singer&#x27;s outspokenness about her own multi-racial heritage at the time of her debut&#x27;s release has also been commented upon by both music critics and sociologists alike. As noted by Professor Michael Eric Dyson in his book, &quot;Between God and Gangsta Rap: Bearing Witness to Black Culture,&quot; Carey&#x27;s &quot;refusal to bow to public pressure&quot; surrounding the nature of her ethnicity exposed &quot;the messy, sometimes arbitrary, politics of definition and categorisation&quot; and &quot;the racial contradictions at the centre of contemporary pop music&quot; at the time. Sika Dagbovie-Mullins of Florida Atlantic University further credited Carey for breaking down existent racial barriers between pop and R&amp;B, hailing her being a &quot;multiracial heroine&quot; for generations of mixed-race singers and songwriters.

Credits adapted from the album&#x27;s liner notes. All tracks written by Mariah Carey and Ben Margulies, except where noted. 
Notes
* signifies an additional producer
* The original pressings of &quot;Mariah Carey&quot; either do not list &quot;Love Takes Time&quot; on the back cover while it is included, mistakenly list it as included on the promotional messaging when it is not included, or do not include the song at all, with no mentioning of its exclusion. This is due to the track being considered for the album, with the mastering and finalization process beginning for the song, only after album pressings had started worldwide.

<text>John Franklin &quot;Frank&quot; Johnston (September 3, 1929 – February 7, 2017) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1969 to 1988, and as a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative government of Sterling Lyon.

== Career ==
Johnston began his political career at the municipal level, serving as an alderman in the City of St. James (now part of Winnipeg) from 1964 to 1966, and in the successor city of St. James-Assiniboia from 1968 to 1972. He was chosen as the city&#x27;s deputy mayor in 1968, and also chaired the urban renewal committee. He was also active in freemasonry, and was a member of the Northwest Commercial Travellers Association.

He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1969, defeating Liberal Robert Chipman by 530 votes in the Winnipeg riding of Sturgeon Creek. This election was the first in Manitoba&#x27;s history won by the social democratic New Democratic Party, and Johnston sat in the opposition benches. In the 1973 election, he was re-elected by an increased margin.

Johnston was re-elected again in the 1977 election, in which the Progressive Conservatives won a majority government. From October 24, 1977 to October 20, 1978, he was a minister without portfolio responsible for the Manitoba Housing and Renewal Corporation. On October 20, 1978, he was promoted to Minister of Economic Development; on November 15, 1981, this portfolio was changed to Economic Development and Tourism.

The Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the 1981 election, and Johnston was re-elected with a reduced plurality. He was re-elected in the 1986 election, but ironically lost to Liberal challenger Iva Yeo in 1988, just as the Progressive Conservatives formed a minority government under Gary Filmon. He never sought a return to political life.

Johnston was an aggressively partisan MLA, and frequently referred to New Democrats as communists in legislative debates. His son, Scott Johnston, was elected as an MLA in the 2016 Manitoba general election.

Johnston&#x27;s passing was announced publicly February 8, 2017 by Premier Brian Pallister.

<text>Cybergoth is a subculture that derives from elements of goth, raver, rivethead and cyberpunk fashion. Cybergoth was particularly prevalent from the late 1990s, through the 2000s but has since declined dramatically.

Opinion differs as to whether cybergoth has the requisite complexity to constitute a subculture, with some commentators suggesting that it is no more than a small aesthetic variation on cyberpunk or raver fashion.

==History==
The term &#x27;Cybergoth&#x27; was coined in 1988 by Games Workshop, for their roleplaying game &quot;Dark Future&quot;, the fashion style did not emerge until the following decade. Valerie Steele quotes Julia Borden, who defines cybergoth as combining elements of industrial aesthetics with a style associated with &quot;Gravers&quot; (Gothic ravers). Gravers hybridized &quot;the British Raver look and the German ClubKid look with a &#x27;freak show&#x27; spin.&quot; as well as a fusion between German and Austrian styles. Borden indicates that initially the hair extensions and bright fishnets did not mesh well with goth fashion, but that by 2002 &quot;the rave elements of dress were replaced by Industrial-influenced accessories, such as goggles, reflective clothing, and mostly black clothing.&quot; Steele summarizes:
Nancy Kilpatrick indicates that David Bowie&#x27;s look in the 1970s is the initial inspiration for the style, and that Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; provided the prototype for cyber aesthetics.

==Fashion==
Cybergoth fashion combines rave, rivethead, cyberpunk and goth fashion, as well as drawing inspiration from other forms of science fiction. Androgyny is common. The style sometimes features one starkly contrasting bright or neon-reactive theme color, such as red, blue, neon green, chrome, or pink, set against a basic, black gothic outfit. Matte or glossy black materials such as rubber and shiny black PVC can be mixed and matched in an effort to create a more artificial look.

The black-and-monochromatic juxtaposition can take a variety of forms, including brightly colored hair and make-up, cybernetic patterns such as live LED circuit boards, body modification, gas masks and goggles (especially aviator-style), typically worn on the forehead or around the neck rather than on the eyes. The most common use of a theme color is in the hair or eye make-up. Artificial, extended hair or &quot;falls&quot; are sometimes used to create this added effect. Falls can be made of various materials, ranging from yarn to fluorescent tubing to electrical wiring. Popular club gear for cybergoths includes tight black pants, tight black vests or shirts cut from ripped, solid or fishnet fabrics, fluffies, resembling costumes from 19th Century Gothic novels or early black and white horror films from the mid-20th century. Companies that specialize in the style include Cyberdog (UK), DANE (UK), Pen &amp; Lolly Clubwear (UK), Lip Service (US), and Diabolik (CA).

==Hair==

Cybergoth style incorporates extravagant hair pieces and styles, including synthetic dreadlocks (known as cyberlox), hair extensions and so on. These hair pieces can be made of a variety of materials, from real hair to synthetic kanekelon hair, plastic tubing, tubular crin, rubber and foam strips, belts, and are often accented with goggles.

<doc id="1220750" wikidata="Q7954462" url="?curid=1220750" title="WPS-8">
<text>WPS-8 is a Word Processing System sold by Digital Equipment Corporation for use with their PDP-8 processors (including the VT78, VT278 DECmate, and PC238 DECmate II and PC24P DECmate III microcomputer systems).

WPS-8 supports a variety of 24 row by 80 or 132 column terminals including the VT52 family as well as the VT100 family and all subsequent ANSI-compatible terminals. A series of hierarchical menus allow the user to command the system; the particular style of these menus became very-widely used by Digital, particularly within their &quot;ALL-IN-1&quot; office system. Once a document is opened for editing, near WYSIWYG editing is provided using a ruler to indicate the text alignment and tab stops for any given portion of the text. A typical editing session might look like this:

 Text conformed to the
 preceding ruler (now offscreen).
 ----L----T-----------------------------T---------------------------------------------R----
 Text conformed to the ruler shown just above
 L -&gt; Left margin
 R -&gt; Ragged-right margin
 T -&gt; Left-aligned tab
 ---------L-----------------------------&gt;---------------------.-----------------------J----
 &gt; -&gt; Right-aligned tab
 . -&gt; Decimal-aligned tab
 J -&gt; Justified right margin (not justified on screen, only on printout)
 Aligned with the right tab
 Decimal-point aligned $5.99
 1279.99
Using these various rulers, complex formatting can be achieved, even using a simple input device like a 24x80 character terminal. On ANSI terminals, character attributes such as bold and underline are shown on the screen. On the VT52 terminals (which can not display attributes), the operator can perform the same functions but only the printout will reveal the formatting.

As text is typed, the system automatically word-wraps the text so that it conforms to the ruler currently in effect for that section of the document. Rulers can be added or modified and the text from that ruler forward to the next will automatically be adjusted to conform to the new ruler. Hyphenation can be semi-automatically performed (including &quot;hidden&quot; hyphens that will only be revealed if a line break exposed them).

Specialized editing functions are provided using the terminal keypad. A few functions can be commanded simply by pressing a keypad key, but a far wider range of functions can be commanded by prefixing them with the &quot;Gold Key&quot; (the PF1 key on the keypad, colored gold on systems equipped with the WPS-8 custom keycaps). This style of &quot;gold key&quot; editing also became standard at Digital, later showing up in mainstream general-purpose text editors such as KED and EDT as well as the &quot;ALL-IN-1&quot; office system. The editing facilities include making a selection and then using cut and paste (much like today&#x27;s word processors, but using keys marked for cut and paste, rather than a mouse).
Printing is to any of several different letter-quality daisy wheel printers including a DEC variant of the Diablo 630.

WPS-8 normally runs from a single floppy diskette and user data can be stored on the system diskette or additional data-only diskettes. Up to four diskette drives are supported in a single system.

The system also supports the creation of data tables, the sorting of these data tables, arithmetic calculations using these data, and a mail-merge operation using these data and the arithmetic results. Through the extensive use of overlays, it manages all that on a 12-bit, 1.2-μs processor with 16 KWords of memory and 256 KB of diskette storage. The limited resources of the system do not permit a spell-checker, though, primarily because there was no place with adequate storage to contain the dictionary file.

<doc id="1220752" wikidata="Q3754342" url="?curid=1220752" title="Protomelas taeniolatus">
<text>Protomelas taeniolatus (often sold under various trade names: &quot;Haplochromis&quot; red empress, red empress or spindle hap) is a Haplochromine cichlid endemic to Lake Malawi in Eastern Africa. The fish is popular in the aquarium hobby due to the bright rainbow-like colors of adult males and its relatively peaceful temperament. Juvenile and female &quot;P. taeniolatus&quot;, like many Haplochromines, do not display bright coloration.
The red empress is endemic to Lake Malawi and occurs in sediment free, rocky habitats in relatively shallow waters. It mainly feeds on algae growing on the rock surfaces, but also on a variety of small invertebrates. Males can reach a size of up to TL.

== Fin Profile ==
The Red Emperor Cichlid has an impressive fin profile to help it survive in its natural habitat: its large body is bristling with spiny fins, which it uses to ward off predators and navigate the water. The anal, dorsal, pectoral, and caudal fins are long to help the fish move quickly through the water. Moreover, the front of each fin is made softer to compatible with water dynamics to gain maximum speeds.

==Home Aquarium==
Due to the attractive colors of the male, these fish are used in the freshwater home aquarium to add variety and color. When kept in captivity they usually grow to around 15 cm (6 inches) and should be kept in at least a 55-gallon tank. They prefer a pH level of 8.2 and a temperature of 26-28 °C (82.4 °F).

==Territory==
The &quot;Protomelas taeniolatus&quot; is generally a peaceful fish until breeding time. At this time the male will guard quite a large amount of territory and chase away any fish that enters his &#x27;lair&#x27;. The males are mostly aggressive to each other unless in a large area of water. When the breeding time is over he will, again, allow any fish to enter his territory and will not guard it

<doc id="1220764" wikidata="Q445921" url="?curid=1220764" title="Jón Gnarr">
<text>Jón Gnarr (; born Jón Gunnar Kristinsson on 2 January 1967) is an Icelandic actor, comedian, and politician who served as the Mayor of Reykjavík from 2010 to 2014. He is currently a member of the Althing for Viðreisn, elected in the 2024 Icelandic parliamentary election.

Jón was a well-known comedian and actor starting in the 1990s, including teaming with Sigurjón Kjartansson as the duo Tvíhöfði on radio and television. In 2009, he formed the Best Party, a political party that began as political satire but quickly turned into a real political player due to its electoral successes, which were perceived to be a reaction to the 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis.

==Early years==
Jón was misdiagnosed with severe intellectual disability as a child and was treated between the ages of five and seven at the children&#x27;s psychiatry ward at the State Hospital at Dalbraut, Reykjavík. He has dyslexia and had learning difficulties. Jón Gnarr recounts these experiences in his book &quot;The Indian&quot;, an autobiographical account of his childhood.

Jón was known as Jónsi Punk as a teenager and played bass in a punk band called Nefrennsli (&quot;Runny Nose&quot;). While attending a number of high schools, he didn&#x27;t complete the university entrance exam, Stúdentspróf. As a young man, he held jobs with car maker Volvo and drove a taxi in Reykjavík. During the 1980s, he and his future wife, Jóhanna &quot;Jóga&quot; Jóhannsdóttir, became acquainted with the members of the Reykjavík-based alternative rock band the Sugarcubes, including Björk Guðmundsdóttir and Einar Örn Benediktsson. Björk remained a close friend to Jóhanna, writing the song &quot;Jóga&quot; from her 1997 album &quot;Homogenic&quot; about her.

==Education==
Jón has an MFA degree in performing arts from the Iceland University of the Arts. His graduation work was his own performance of the ancient Icelandic poem Völuspá from the Poetic Edda

==Performance career==
In 1994, Jón teamed up with Sigurjón Kjartansson to form the radio duo Tvíhöfði. In 1997, he joined TV station Stöð 2 where he wrote and starred in several seasons of the Icelandic comedy show &quot;Fóstbræður&quot;. His best known movies are &quot;The Icelandic Dream&quot; and &quot;A Man like Me&quot;. His stand-up comedy show &quot;Ég var einu sinni nörd&quot; (&quot;I Used To Be a Nerd&quot;) is autobiographical. In 2004 he wrote, starred and produced a short film, &quot;The Man on the Back&quot;.

He worked as a creative writer and actor at the Icelandic advertising agency EnnEmm, producing several popular TV ads. He played Georg Bjarnfreðarson on the television series &#x27; (&quot;Night Shift&quot;), &#x27; (&quot;Day Shift&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;Prison Shift&quot;). He was also a co-writer in the series, which introduced a number of new actors. In 2009, he starred in the feature film &#x27;, which endeared him even further to the Icelandic public. Jón is a member of Félag íslenskra leikara (Icelandic Actors Guild) and Félag leikskálda og handritshöfunda (Playwrights and Screenwriters Guild).

==Entry into politics==
In late 2009, Jón founded the Best Party with a number of other people who had no background in politics, including Einar. The Best Party, which is a satirical political party that parodies Icelandic politics and aims to make the life of the citizens more fun, managed a plurality in the 2010 municipal elections in Reykjavík, with the party gaining six out of 15 seats on the Reykjavík City Council (34.7 percent of the vote). Einar, who was second on the party&#x27;s list behind Jón, won one of the seats on the city council.

Jón ended up defeating the centre-right Independence Party-led municipal government of Hanna Birna Kristjánsdóttir, which came as &quot;a shock&quot; to Icelandic Prime Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir. Jón&#x27;s victory is widely seen as a backlash against establishment politicians in the wake of the Icelandic financial crisis, i.e. 2008 banking collapse.

His political platform included promises of &quot;free towels in all swimming pools, a polar bear for the Reykjavík zoo, all kinds of things for weaklings, Disneyland in the Vatnsmýri area, a &#x27;drug-free&#x27; Althing by 2020, sustainable transparency, tollbooths on the border with Seltjarnarnes, to do away with all debt, free access to Hljómskálagarðurinn (orchestral rotunda park).&quot;

Both before and after being elected, Jón announced that he would not go in for a coalition government with anyone that had not watched the HBO series &quot;The Wire&quot;. He is an avid watcher of the series, and stated his favourite character is Omar. Ultimately, his Best Party entered into a coalition with the social-democratic Social Democratic Alliance (&quot;Samfylkingin&quot;) as its junior partner to govern Reykjavík.

==As Reykjavík mayor==

After Jón became mayor of Reykjavík, it was jokingly proposed that the city be nicknamed Gnarrenburg, the title of an earlier television talk show featuring Jón. As mayor, he appeared at the 2010 Gay Pride parade as a drag queen, posted a video holiday greeting wearing a Darth Vader mask and a Santa Claus cap, and suggested a merger with neighboring municipality Kópavogur. Jón protested about the Chinese government&#x27;s treatment of human rights activist Liu Xiaobo, before the announcement of Liu&#x27;s award for the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. He has also stated that he believes the importance of the European Union is highly over-rated. His government also included the granting of long-awaited permission for the construction of Iceland&#x27;s first purpose-built mosque.

On 30 October 2013, Jón announced that he would not seek a second term in office when his first term expired in June 2014.

==After leaving office==
Since leaving office, Jón has campaigned for Iceland to abandon its laws regarding traditional Icelandic names, viewing it as discriminatory, e.g. that only some family names are allowed and Gnarr not an approved one. Jón also authored a book entitled &quot;Gnarr!: How I Became the Mayor of a Large City in Iceland and Changed the World&quot;. In January 2015 Jón joined the Center for Energy and Environmental Research in the Human Sciences (CENHS) at Rice University as their first writer in residence.

After the incumbent President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, announced on 1 January 2016 that he would not run in the upcoming presidential election, it was speculated that Jón would put forward his candidacy. On 15 January 2016, Jón announced he would not be running for office &quot;for the time being&quot;, but that he could &quot;think of doing it later&quot;, and that he was more interested in working more in Icelandic television.

== Return to politics and election to the Althing ==
Prior to the 2017 parliamentary election, Jón joined the Social Democratic Alliance as the SDA&#x27;s campaign manager.

On 2 April 2024 he announced that he would run in the 2024 Icelandic presidential election. He was later confirmed as a candidate. He finished fourth with 10.1% of the votes.

In September 2024, Jón announced that he would join Viðreisn for the upcoming parliamentary elections. He would be elected in the Reykjavík South Althing constituency. Ahead of the election, Jón described himself as &quot;a great anarchist and libertarian and I put a lot of emphasis on the freedom of individuals over their personal lives and this fundamental ideology that people should enjoy freedom as long as it does not undermine the freedom of others. And that our freedom does not concern the government unless certain conditions are met. That distinguishes me from the social democrats,&quot; when describing leaving the Social Democratic Alliance for Viðreisn.

==Personal life and family==
Jón Gnarr is married to Jóhanna Jóhannsdóttir, a close friend of the singer Björk. He has five children, one of whom is Margret Gnarr, a fitness competitor.

<doc id="1220775" wikidata="Q2916638" url="?curid=1220775" title="Modzitz">
<text>Modzitz, or Modzhitz, is the name of a Hasidic group within Orthodox Judaism that derives its name from &quot;Modrzyce&quot;, one of the boroughs of the town of Dęblin, Poland, located on the Vistula River.

Followers of this group are known as Modzitzer Hasidim, and are now based mainly in Bnei Brak (where one of the current Modzitzer Rebbes lives), and Jerusalem, Israel. They also have a smaller following in the United States, in Brooklyn (where the other current Modzitzer Rebbe lives), Monsey, New York, and Los Angeles, and in Toronto in Canada.

The Modzitzer &quot;rebbes&quot; are well known for their musical compositions, many of which were recorded by Ben Zion Shenker. The &quot;rebbes&quot; of Modzitz and their followers have composed over 4,000 &quot;nigunim&quot;.

==Forerunners==
===Rebbe Yechezkel Taub of Kuzmir (1755–1856)===

The dynasty started with Rebbe Yechezkel Taub of Kuzmir, (1755–1856), who established yeshivas and a type of Hasidic teaching that was similar to that of his rebbes, the Seer of Lublin and the Kozhnitser Magid, and distinct from the Hasidism of Kotzk.

===Rebbe Shmuel Eliyahu Taub of Zvolin===

Upon the death of Rebbe Yechezkel Taub of Kuzmir in 1856, his son, Shmuel Eliyahu Taub of Zvolin, Poland, succeeded him as Rebbe. He excelled in Torah scholarship and creating Hasidic songs. He was called &quot;Menagen mafli pla&#x27;os&quot;, Hebrew for &quot;[a] wondrous musical talent&quot;. When he died in 1888, his first son, Rabbi Moshe Aharon (1837 – March 17, 1918), succeeded him as Rebbe of Zvolin, while his second son, Rebbe Yisrael, went on to found the Modzitz Hasidic dynasty.

==Rebbe Yisrael Taub (1849–1920)==

Rebbe Yisrael Taub, second son of Rebbe Shmuel Eliyahu Taub of Zvolin, was born in 1849. In 1888, he succeeded his father as a rebbe of the Zvoliner Hasidim. In 1891, he settled in &quot;Modrzyc&quot;, a village near the town of Demblin, Poland. He became known as the Modzhitzer Rebbe (after his place of residence), thus establishing the dynasty of Modzhitz. He composed many melodies that are still sung by Hasidim and others today. He suffered from diabetes, and in 1913, he traveled to Professor Israel in Berlin. The only way to save his life was by amputating his gangrenous leg (a consequence of diabetes). Before the operation, the rebbe observed the beautiful Berlin architecture, which upset him by comparison with the desolation of the holy city of Jerusalem. During the operation, he composed his epic masterpiece, based on the words of &quot;Eleh Ezkero&quot; (recited on Yom Kippur). Modzhitzer Hasidim sing this tune each year when they gather to commemorate his yahrzeit.

His teachings on Breishis, Shemos, and Vayikra have been collected in his work &quot;Divrei Yisrael&quot;. Unfortunately, the writings on Bamidbar and Devarim were lost. In 2008, his great-grandson, known as the Grand Rabbi of Modzitz, Rabbi Yisrael Dovid Taub, printed a collection of his teachings on Bamidbar and Devarim, and his own works based on his grandfather&#x27;s previously printed works. These works were accepted in the world as the original parts of Divrei Yisrael.

When he died on 24 November 1920, he was succeeded by his son, Rebbe Shaul Yedidya Elazar Taub.
==Rebbe Shaul Yedidya Elazar Taub (1886–1947)==
Rebbe Shaul Yedidya Elazar Taub was born on 20 October 1886. He married the daughter of the Grand Rabbi of Lublin, Rabbi Avrohom Eiger, author of the Shevet MeYehuda. They had a son, [Shmuel Eliyahu], and a daughter. By the age of 19, he divorced her; the children, Shmuel Eliyahu and Golda were divided.His daughter was raised by her mother; his son in Rabbi Yisroel&#x27;s home. He remarried to the daughter of the great kabbalist Rabbi Shaul Schwartz Rav of Stepantz in Poland, and by him, he learned and studied kabbalah. From his second wife, he had two sons and two daughters. His son, Rabbi Yehoshua Yecheskel, who was his right hand in all his Rabbinical subjects. Rabbi Yehoshua Yecheskel also printed his works on the &quot;Hagada shel Pesach&quot; under the name &quot;Ishei Yisrael&quot;. Unfortunately, Rabbi Yehoshua Yecheskel was a very weak person physically, and he died at a very young age, a short time after his father (1952); so, though he was offered it, he refused to take over the Rabbinical throne of the Modzitz dynasty. But in later years, his only son, Grand Rabbi Yisrael Dovid Taub, and renewed the Modzitz dynasty in the United States in his shul in Flatbush.

R. Shaul subsequently married the daughter of the Bochner Rav, a great-grandson of R. Chaim Sanzer. They had four children, two sons and two daughters.
Rabbi Shaul Yedidya guided his Hasidim in Poland until September 1939, when he fled Poland due to Nazi persecution. He travelled to Vilna, Lithuania, Russia, and from there made his way to Japan. Eventually, with the help of some Modzitzer Hasidim, he and some family members reached the shores of San Francisco, and then moved to Brooklyn, New York, in 1940. It was during his stay in Brooklyn that Rebbe Shaul Yedidya Elazar became popular and helped rebuild Modzitz. He was a gifted songwriter, and wrote over 1,000 Hasidic melodies. He had an intense love for the Land of Israel, . He was unable to see the realization of his prediction, and he died on November 29, 1947, the day the UN voted to create the State of Israel. He was the last person to be buried on the Mount of Olives until it was liberated in 1967. His teachings have been collected in the volumes of &quot;Imrei Shaul&quot; and &quot;Yisa Bracha&quot;. He was succeeded by his oldest son, Rebbe Shmuel Eliyahu Taub, in Tel Aviv.
==Rebbe Shmuel Eliyahu Taub (1905–1984)==

Rebbe Shmuel Eliyahu was born in Lublin, Poland, on 9 February 1905. In 1935, Rebbe Shaul Yedidya Elazar and his son Rabbi Shmuel went on a pilgrimage to the then-British Mandate of Palestine. While they were there, R. Shmuel fell in love with the Land of Israel, and asked his father if he could stay there. His father agreed, and within a year, Rabbi Shmuel&#x27;s wife and their child came over to Israel. After his father&#x27;s death in 1947, he succeeded his father as the Modzitzer Rebbe, to be known later as the &quot;Imrei Eish&quot; (&quot;Words of Fire&quot;). He continued the traditions of Modzitz, both as a composer and as a Torah scholar. He died on 6 May 1984 (4 Iyar 5744), when he was succeeded in Israel by his only son, Rebbe Yisrael Dan Taub.
==Rebbe Yisrael Dan Taub (1928–2006)==

Rebbe Yisrael Dan was born in 1928 in Warsaw, Poland, and died on 16 June 2006 (20 Sivan 5766). He came with his mother to Palestine in 1936 to meet up with his father, Rebbe Shmuel Eliyahu. For a number of years, he headed the Modzitz Hasidim in the city of Tel Aviv, where his father had lived. On Lag Ba&#x27;omer 5755 (18 May 1995), he moved the headquarters of Modzitz to a new building in Bnei Brak, Israel. Like his predecessors, he composed numerous Hasidic melodies, and many of them are sung regularly in Hasidic synagogues. His opinion was highly regarded, and he was a member of the Council of Torah Sages of Agudat Israel. A collection of his Hasidic teachings was published as Nachalas Dan (&quot;The Inheritance of Dan&quot;, the name by which he came to be known post-humously). Rebbe Yisrael Dan was survived by two sons and two daughters. At his funeral, his elder son, Grand Rabbi Chaim Shaul Taub, was crowned as the new Modzitzer Rebbe. His other son, Rabbi Pinchas Moshe Taub, was later crowned as the Kuzmirer Rebbe.
== Rebbe Chaim Shaul Taub ==

Rebbe Chaim Shaul served for many years as rosh yeshiva of &quot;Yeshivas Imrei Shaul and Darkhei Torah&quot; in Bnei Brak. In keeping with the long-standing tradition of Modzitz, the Rebbe composed ten new niggunim for Rosh Hashana of 5767, and twelve new niggunim for 5768 (corresponding to September 2006 and 2007), some of which have become popular among Haredi Jews in Israel.

<text>The Avenue de l&#x27;Opéra () was created from 1864 to 1879 as part of Haussmann&#x27;s renovation of Paris. It is situated in the center of the city, running northwest from the Louvre to the Palais Garnier, the primary opera house of Paris (until the opening of the Opéra Bastille in 1989).

==Description==

The Avenue de l&#x27;Opéra was an important thoroughfare in Haussmann&#x27;s traffic scheme, since it linked the Rue de Rivoli at the Louvre to the &quot;grands boulevards&quot; near the Opéra and gave better access to the wealthy neighbourhoods being developed at that time in northwest Paris. It had the additional advantage that the demolition required for its construction cleared the area between the Louvre and the grand boulevards, which had been occupied by a slum district, dense with poor-quality housing and numerous narrow streets, that was considered unhealthy and dangerous.

At the avenue&#x27;s northwest end, in front of the opera house, is the Place de l&#x27;Opéra. Besides providing a setting for the imposing Palais Garnier, it is a nexus from which several streets radiate. At the time it was built, it was criticized for being too grandiose, but now with much more traffic, it is often considered too small. Elegant stores selling luxury leather goods and jewelry, and the Café de la Paix, are located here.

The avenue itself is very popular with tourists and is lined with shops selling fancy souvenir Parisian merchandise (&quot;articles de Paris&quot;), as well as travel agencies and banks. A small Japanese district is nearby, in the Rue Sainte-Anne.

Unlike most Parisian avenues, there are no trees. This was the result of a compromise between Haussmann and Charles Garnier, the architect of the opera house, who desired the best view possible of the main facade of the Opera at the end of the avenue. He did not want the view to be obstructed by the leaves and branches.

At the avenue&#x27;s southeast end, near the Louvre, is the Place André Malraux, named after the French writer André Malraux, who had been Minister of Cultural Affairs under Charles de Gaulle. The square was formerly known as the Place du Théâtre Français, after the theatre of the Comédie-Française, which is located here. Adjacent to the theatre is the Palais-Royal, famous for its gardens.

== History ==
Initially, the Butte Saint-Roch was located at the level of the current Rue des Pyramides. Joan of Arc installed guns (culverins) on it
to support the attack against the Porte Saint-Honoré. 
The mount was lowered somewhat in 1615, but remained a serious obstacle. The enormous quantity of material produced by the leveling of this hill was used to fill the excavations of the Champ de Mars. Previously one had to descend seven steps to reach the entrance of the church of Saint-Roch, whereas now one must climb thirteen steps. 

A decree of 3 May 1854 initiated a project to create an &quot;Avenue Napoléon&quot;, running from the Louvre to the place where the Rue de la Paix joins the boulevards. However, little progress was made. In the early 1860s, the construction of the new opera house relaunched the project by a decree of 24 August 1864. Work began at each end but proceeded slowly. The fall of the Second Empire in 1870, caused a delay in the work, at least for a while, and in 1873 the boulevard was renamed Avenue de l&#x27;Opera. After a public decree of 27 June 1876, work resumed and was quickly completed. The last buildings along the avenue were built in 1879.

Number 22 is the address of the former Hotel des Deux Mondes, which closed in 1940. After the war, it became the Paris field office of the United States Secret Service.

The Avenue de l&#x27;Opéra was featured in Louis Aragon&#x27;s surrealist novel &quot;Le Paysan de Paris&quot; (The Parisian Peasant).

<text>Westminster Hall and Burying Ground is a graveyard and former church located at 519 West Fayette Street (at North Greene Street) in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is currently part of the grounds of the University of Maryland&#x27;s School of Law. It occupies the southeast corner of West Fayette and North Greene Street on the west side of downtown Baltimore. It sits across from the Baltimore VA hospital and is the burial site of Edgar Allan Poe (1809–1849) and several politicians and military officials. The complex was declared a national historic district in 1974.

==History==

The graveyard was established in January 1787 by the First Presbyterian Church of Baltimore, from land on the westside of old Baltimore Town purchased by a committee of noted laymen consisting of William Smith, John Boyd, and William Patterson (locally prominent merchant, civic activist, owner of future Patterson Park, and father of noted Baltimore socialite/debutante Elizabeth (&quot;Betsy&quot;) Patterson, (1785–1879), who married Jerome Bonaparte in 1803, brother of the French Emperor Napoleon I) from Col. John Eager Howard, (1752–1827), former commander of the famous &quot;Maryland Line&quot; regiment of the Continental Army in the American Revolution. Col. Howard owned the estate and mansion of &quot;Belvidere&quot;, in what was called &quot;Howard&#x27;s Woods&quot;, north of Baltimore Town (later to become the neighborhood of Mount Vernon-Belvedere, and the site of the landmark Washington Monument). First Presbyterian, a congregation of socially and economically elite local Presbyterians and Reformed Protestants, then was located in downtown Baltimore since its founding in 1761 at the northwest corner of East Fayette Street at North Street (later Guilford Avenue) in a landmark twin-spired Georgian architecture-Federal style architecture structure from 1790 to 1795. Over the next 60 years, the &quot;Burying Grounds&quot; (or cemetery) became the final resting place for many important and influential merchants, politicians, statesmen, and dozens of veterans (officers and soldiers) of the American Revolutionary War and War of 1812 who were citizens of the burgeoning and soon-to-be, the third largest city in America – Baltimore.

In July 1852, Westminster Presbyterian Church was erected overtop the graveyard, its brick piers straddling gravestones and burial vaults to create what later Baltimoreans referred to as the &quot;catacombs.&quot; For years, it was thought that the Gothic Revival-style Westminster Presbyterian Church was built in response to a new city ordinance prohibiting cemeteries that were not adjacent to a religious structure. Research in the early 1980s by historian Michael Franch found no such ordinance—and revealed a more complex motive: The congregation hoped that the new expansion church would serve Baltimore&#x27;s growing &quot;West End&quot;—new churches were then springing up in every corner of the city in response to a dramatic increase in population—and provide protection to an aging, old-fashioned, 18th Century-style &quot;burying ground&quot; that few saw as an appropriate resting place for the more up-to-date 19th Century.

Westminster Presbyterian Church lived up to its promise and ministry for several decades, but suffered a dramatic loss of congregants by the early 20th century who were moving to the outer city and its suburbs and joining additional Presbyterian and other congregations there. Even First Presbyterian and the Franklin Street congregations eventually merged in 1974, (now known as &quot;First and Franklin Street Presbyterian Church&quot;) moving to the First Church building at the corner of Park Avenue and West Madison Streets, with the old Franklin Street building now being used by a fundamentalist Protestant congregation that however takes good care of its historic building. Revived in the 1920s by a number of new active members, the congregation continued until 1977 when the Westminster Presbyterian congregation was disbanded/disorganized and historical assets were reverted to the local Presbytery of Baltimore and arrangements were made when care of the church building and premises was assumed by the University of Maryland&#x27;s School of Law, which occupies the rest of the square block to the south, southeast and east bounded by West Baltimore, North Paca, West Fayette and North Greene streets. The School of Law&#x27;s city block campus is also surrounded by the urban neighborhood of the other buildings, facilities, medical center, parking garages and public squares of the various graduate schools of the University of Maryland at Baltimore&#x27;s westside/downtown campus, founded in 1807. Under the auspices of the newly organized, non-profit &quot;Westminster Preservation Trust&quot;, the &quot;burying grounds&quot; were cleaned up and the church was renovated for secular public use, now known as &quot;Westminster Hall&quot;.

The restoration included the pipe organ that had been installed in the church by Johnson &amp; Son in 1882 as their Opus 577. This restoration was done by Andover Organ Company. The historic Johnson &amp; Son pipe organ was played in recital during the Organ Historical Society Convention in July 2024.

Support and a listing has also been obtained from the Maryland Historical Trust and other heritage and tourism organizations such as the newly established efforts of the Baltimore National Heritage Area, with the National Park Service, with cooperation from the Maryland Historical Society, the Baltimore City Historical Society, Baltimore Heritage, Preservation Maryland, and the Office of Promotion and the Arts in the Mayor&#x27;s Office of the City of Baltimore plus the Baltimore City Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation. In 2006, the Westminster Preservation Trust installed more than 20 interpretive signs around the burying ground and catacombs to provide historical and biographical information on the area.

The site has been used in an episode of &quot;Creepy Canada&quot;, with paranormal investigators from BSPR discussing its possible haunting.

==Historic designation==
Westminster Hall and Burying Ground was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 17, 1974. They are included in the Baltimore National Heritage Area.

===Edgar Allan Poe===

Westminster Hall and Burying Ground is home to the grave of American author Edgar Allan Poe, arguably its most famous resident. Poe actually has two graves on this site: his original grave and a monument added in 1875. His original burial spot, towards the back of Westminster Hall, is marked by a headstone with an engraved raven. It was a family plot, lot 27, where his grandfather General David Poe Sr. and his brother Henry Leonard Poe are also buried. In 1875, a local school teacher started a &quot;Pennies for Poe&quot; campaign to raise money for a more appropriate monument, resulting in the large marble monument located at the front of the cemetery facing Fayette St; to this day, it is traditional for visitors to the grave to leave a penny on the monument. Poe was re-buried there along with his aunt/mother-in-law Maria Clemm. His wife Virginia died in the Bronx in 1847 and was interred in a vault. In 1885 her remains were moved to the Poe Monument and was reburied in a small bronze box to the left of the monument.

Today, this &quot;who&#x27;s who&quot; of early Baltimore is overshadowed by the later presence of the promising writer, poet and author Edgar Allan Poe, who was buried here in October 1849, following his sudden and mysterious death after being found in a sick and semi-conscious state wearing unfamiliar clothes. Poe was taken to the Church Home and Infirmary on Broadway (between East Fayette and Baltimore Streets on &quot;Washington Hill&quot;), where he died four days later. He was interred in the old Western Burying Grounds of the First Presbyterian Church. Some time later a small stone was erected at the plot in the southeastern corner of the cemetery, through the efforts of his relative Neilson Poe. By a year later, a substantial church was planned to be erected over the grounds built upon supporting brick and stone arches to preserve the resting places of those interred below. The new Westminster Presbyterian Church sponsored by the earlier parishes of First Church and the newer Franklin Street Presbyterian Church, along with the Presbytery of Baltimore was organized and dedicated in July 1852.

Because of his subsequent growing literary fame as the 19th Century progressed following his death, a resolution was offered by Prof. John Basil, Jr., principal of the Number 8 Grammar School, and was adopted appointing a committee of five — Professors Basil, Thomas D. Baird and J.J.G. Webster (of the Central High School of Baltimore, later renamed in 1866 as the Baltimore City College), along with Misses Veeder and Wise – &quot;to devise some means best adapted in their judgment to perpetuate the memory of one who has contributed so largely to American literature&quot; and a subscription was taken up in October 1865 by several leaders and members of the Public School Teachers Association. Numerous activities to raise further funds were held for some time by the pupils and the teachers of the Baltimore City Public Schools, including various entertainments by the young ladies of the Western and Eastern Female High Schools, under the direction of Miss S. A. Rice. By March 1871 the &quot;Poe Memorial Fund&quot; amounted to about $587.00. Then a new committee of Profs. Elliott (City College), Kerr and Hamilton and Misses Rice and Baer, professors of English and Literature at the Western-Eastern High Schools, was appointed and by April 1872, resolved to apply the monies so collected to erection of a monument over Poe&#x27;s grave. By September 1874, with the estate of the late Principal Thomas Baird of the City College being donated consisting of $627.55, the architect of the new Baltimore City Hall on Holliday Street, Mr. George A. Frederick, was requested to design a suitable stone monument, which later ran over the expected cost, however the balance was made up by a generous donation from a Philadelphian, Mr. George W. Childs, of $650.00. The monument was then carved by local sculptor and stonemason Hugh Sisson. Poe&#x27;s body was exhumed and moved to the new more prominent northwestern site near the cemetery entrance gate at the corner of North Greene and West Fayette Streets. The monument was dedicated November 17, 1875 in the presence of a large concourse of spectators with addresses by Profs. William Elliott, Jr., H.E. Shepherd, and the locally famous civic activist, author-artist and orator John H. B. Latrobe, and representatives of several other public schools, colleges and institutions. The design of the monument consists of a pedestal (or die block) with an ornamental cap wholly of marble, resting on two marble slabs, and a granite base. The front of the die block bears a medallion portrait of the author-poet by the sculptor Volck, while on the western side appear the lines of inscription: &quot;Edgar Allan Poe: born Jan. 20, 1809; died Oct. 7, 1849.&quot;

Annual observances on his birth and death dates at his grave side are still conducted to this day, attended by the WHT officials, Presbyterian Church clergy and members of several literary, educational and historical societies (such as the Poe Society of Baltimore), representatives of the several Baltimore City public high schools whose predecessors sponsored the Monuments over 140 years ago (Baltimore City College with their two old literary and debating societies: Bancroft and Carrollton-Wight, and the Western High School and the Eastern High School) and the general public and media. There is also additionally, very popular tours of the graves and catacombs below the old church and hall and activities on the festival of &quot;Halloween&quot; in late October.

Westminster Hall is the location of the Westminster Preservation Trust annual Poe birthday celebration every January, often featuring theatrical presentations and an apple cider toast. On Poe&#x27;s birthday, January 19, an unidentified man known endearingly as the Poe Toaster visited the burying ground to make an annual tribute to Poe. The tradition seemingly ended in 2009.

<text>Spallation is a process in which fragments of material (spall) are ejected from a body due to impact or stress. In the context of impact mechanics it describes ejection of material from a target during impact by a projectile. In planetary physics, spallation describes meteoritic impacts on a planetary surface and the effects of stellar winds and cosmic rays on planetary atmospheres and surfaces. In the context of mining or geology, spallation can refer to pieces of rock breaking off a rock face due to the internal stresses in the rock; it commonly occurs on mine shaft walls. In the context of metal oxidation, spallation refers to the breaking off of the oxide layer from a metal. For example, the flaking off of rust from iron. In the context of anthropology, spallation is a process used to make stone tools such as arrowheads by knapping. In nuclear physics, spallation is the process in which a heavy nucleus emits numerous nucleons as a result of being hit by a high-energy particle, thus greatly reducing its atomic weight. In industrial processes and bioprocessing the loss of tubing material due to the repeated flexing of the tubing within a peristaltic pump is termed spallation.

==In solid mechanics==
Spallation can occur when a tensile stress wave propagates through a material and can be observed in flat plate impact tests. It is caused by an internal cavitation due to stresses, which are generated by the interaction of stress waves, exceeding the local tensile strength of materials. A fragment or multiple fragments will be created on the free end of the plate. This fragment known as &quot;spall&quot; acts as a secondary projectile with velocities that can be as high as one third of the stress wave speed on the material. This type of failure is typically an effect of high explosive squash head (HESH) charges.

==Laser spallation==
Laser induced spallation is a recent experimental technique developed to understand the adhesion of thin films with substrates. A high energy pulsed laser (typically ) is used to create a compressive stress pulse in the substrate wherein it propagates and reflects as a tensile wave at the free boundary. This tensile pulse spalls/peels the thin film while propagating towards the substrate. Using theory of wave propagation in solids it is possible to extract the interface strength. The stress pulse created in this example is usually around 3 to 8 nanoseconds in duration while its magnitude varies as a function of laser fluence. Due to the non-contact application of load, this technique is very well suited to spall ultra-thin films (1 micrometre in thickness or less). It is also possible to mode convert a longitudinal stress wave into a shear stress using a pulse shaping prism and achieve shear spallation.

==Nuclear spallation==

Nuclear spallation from the impact of cosmic rays occurs naturally in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and on the surfaces of bodies in space such as meteorites and the Moon. Evidence of cosmic ray spallation is seen on outer surfaces of bodies and gives a means of measuring the length of time of exposure. The composition of cosmic rays themselves may also indicate that they have suffered spallation before reaching Earth, because the proportion of light elements such as lithium, boron, and beryllium in them exceeds average cosmic abundances; these elements in the cosmic rays were evidently formed from spallation of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon and perhaps silicon in the cosmic ray sources or during their lengthy travel here. Cosmogenic isotopes of aluminium, beryllium, chlorine, iodine and neon, formed by spallation of terrestrial elements under cosmic ray bombardment, have been detected on Earth.

Nuclear spallation is one of the processes by which a particle accelerator may be used to produce a beam of neutrons. A particle beam consisting of protons at around 1 GeV is shot into a target consisting of mercury, tantalum, lead or another heavy metal. The target nuclei are excited and upon deexcitation, 20 to 30 neutrons are expelled per nucleus. Although this is a far more expensive way of producing neutron beams than by a chain reaction of nuclear fission in a nuclear reactor, it has the advantage that the beam can be pulsed with relative ease. Furthermore, the energetic cost of one spallation neutron is six times lower than that of a neutron gained via nuclear fission. In contrast to nuclear fission, the spallation neutrons cannot trigger further spallation or fission processes to produce further neutrons. Therefore, there is no chain reaction, which makes the process non-critical. Observations of cosmic ray spallation had already been made in the 1930s, but the first observations from a particle accelerator occurred in 1947, and the term &quot;spallation&quot; was coined by Nobelist Glenn T. Seaborg that same year. Spallation is a proposed neutron source in subcritical nuclear reactors like the upcoming research reactor MYRRHA, which is planned to investigate the feasibility of nuclear transmutation of high level waste into less harmful substances. Besides having a neutron multiplication factor &quot;just below&quot; criticality, subcritical reactors can also produce net usable energy as the average energy expenditure per neutron produced ranges around 30 MeV (1GeV beam producing a bit over 30 neutrons in the most productive targets) while fission produces on the order of 200 MeV per actinide atom that is split. Even at relatively low energy efficiency of the processes involved, net usable energy could be generated while being able to use actinides unsuitable for use in conventional reactors as &quot;fuel&quot;.

===Production of neutrons at a spallation neutron source===
Generally the production of neutrons at a spallation source begins with a high-powered proton accelerator. The accelerator may consist of a linac only (as in the European Spallation Source) or a combination of linac and synchrotron (e.g. ISIS neutron source) or a cyclotron (e.g. SINQ (PSI)) . As an example, the ISIS neutron source is based on some components of the former Nimrod synchrotron. Nimrod was uncompetitive for particle physics so it was replaced with a new synchrotron, initially using the original injectors, but which produces a highly intense pulsed beam of protons. Whereas Nimrod would produce around 2 μA at 7 GeV, ISIS produces 200 μA at 0.8 GeV. This is pulsed at the rate of 50 Hz, and this intense beam of protons is focused onto a target. Experiments have been done with depleted uranium targets but although these produce the most intense neutron beams, they also have the shortest lives. Generally, therefore, tantalum or tungsten targets have been used. Spallation processes in the target produce the neutrons, initially at very high energies—a good fraction of the proton energy. These neutrons are then slowed in moderators filled with liquid hydrogen or liquid methane to the energies that are needed for the scattering instruments. Whilst protons can be focused since they have charge, chargeless neutrons cannot be, so in this arrangement the instruments are arranged around the moderators.

Inertial confinement fusion has the potential to produce orders of magnitude more neutrons than spallation. This could be useful for neutron radiography, which can be used to locate hydrogen atoms in structures, resolve atomic thermal motion, and study collective excitations of phonons more effectively than X-rays.

<text>Neodymium(III) chloride or neodymium trichloride is a chemical compound of neodymium and chlorine with the formula NdCl3. This anhydrous compound is a mauve-colored solid that rapidly absorbs water on exposure to air to form a purple-colored hexahydrate, NdCl3·6H2O. Neodymium(III) chloride is produced from minerals monazite and bastnäsite using a complex multistage extraction process. The chloride has several important applications as an intermediate chemical for production of neodymium metal and neodymium-based lasers and optical fibers. Other applications include a catalyst in organic synthesis and in decomposition of waste water contamination, corrosion protection of aluminium and its alloys, and fluorescent labeling of organic molecules (DNA).

== Appearance ==

NdCl3 is a mauve colored hygroscopic solid whose color changes to purple upon absorption of atmospheric water. The resulting hydrate, like many other neodymium salts, has the interesting property that it appears different colors under fluorescent light- In the chloride&#x27;s case, light yellow (see picture).

== Structure ==

=== Solid ===
The anhydrous NdCl3 features Nd in a nine-coordinate tricapped trigonal prismatic geometry and crystallizes with the UCl3 structure. This hexagonal structure is common for many halogenated lanthanides and actinides such as LaCl3, LaBr3, SmCl3, PrCl3, EuCl3, CeCl3, CeBr3, GdCl3, AmCl3 and TbCl3 but not for YbCl3 and LuCl3.

=== Solution ===
The structure of neodymium(III) chloride in solution crucially depends on the solvent: In water, the major species are Nd(H2O)83+, and this situation is common for most rare earth chlorides and bromides. In methanol, the species are NdCl2(CH3OH)6+ and in hydrochloric acid NdCl(H2O)72+. The coordination of neodymium is octahedral (8-fold) in all cases, but the ligand structure is different.

== Properties ==
NdCl3 is a soft paramagnetic solid, which turns ferromagnetic at very low temperature of 0.5 K. Its electrical conductivity is about 240 S/m and heat capacity is ~100 J/(mol·K). NdCl3 is readily soluble in water and ethanol, but not in chloroform or ether. Reduction of NdCl3 with Nd metal at temperatures above 650 °C yields NdCl2:
:2 NdCl3 + Nd → 3 NdCl2

Heating of NdCl3 with water vapors or silica produces neodymium oxochloride:
:NdCl3 + H2O → NdOCl + 2 HCl
:2 NdCl3 + SiO2 → 2 NdOCl + SiCl4

Reacting NdCl3 with hydrogen sulfide at about 1100 °C produces neodymium sulfide:
:2 NdCl3 + 3 H2S → 2 Nd2S3 + 6 HCl

Reactions with ammonia and phosphine at high temperatures yield neodymium nitride and phosphide, respectively:
:NdCl3 + NH3 → NdN + 3 HCl
:NdCl3 + PH3 → NdP + 3 HCl

Whereas the addition of hydrofluoric acid produces neodymium fluoride:
:NdCl3 + 3 HF → NdF3 + 3 HCl

== Preparation ==

NdCl3 is produced from minerals monazite and bastnäsite. The synthesis is complex because of the low abundance of neodymium in the Earth&#x27;s crust (38 mg/kg) and because of difficulty of separating neodymium from other lanthanides. The process is however easier for neodymium than for other lanthanides because of its relatively high content in the mineral – up to 16% by weight, which is the third highest after cerium and lanthanum. Many synthesis varieties exist and one can be simplified as follows:

The crushed mineral is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water-soluble sulfates of rare earths. The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH 3–4. Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed. After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths into their insoluble oxalates. The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing. The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid that excludes the main components, cerium, whose oxide is insoluble in HNO3. Neodymium oxide is separated from other rare-earth oxides by ion exchange. In this process, rare-earth ions are adsorbed onto suitable resin by ion exchange with hydrogen, ammonium or cupric ions present in the resin. The rare earth ions are then selectively washed out by suitable complexing agent, such as ammonium citrate or nitrilotracetate.

This process normally yields Nd2O3; the oxide is difficult to directly convert to elemental neodymium, which is often the goal of the whole technological procedure. Therefore, the oxide is treated with hydrochloric acid and ammonium chloride to produce the less stable NdCl3: 
:Nd2O3 + 6 NH4Cl → 2 NdCl3 + 3 H2O + 6 NH3

The thus produced NdCl3 quickly absorbs water and converts to NdCl3·6H2O hydrate, which is stable for storage, and can be converted back into NdCl3 when necessary. Simple rapid heating of the hydrate is not practical for that purpose because it causes hydrolysis with consequent production of Nd2O3. Therefore, anhydrous NdCl3 is prepared by dehydration of the hydrate either by slowly heating to 400 °C with 4-6 equivalents of ammonium chloride under high vacuum, or by heating with an excess of thionyl chloride for several hours. The NdCl3 can alternatively be prepared by reacting neodymium metal with hydrogen chloride or chlorine, though this method is not economical due to the relatively high price of the metal and is used for research purposes only. After preparation, it is usually purified by high temperature sublimation under high vacuum.

== Applications ==

=== Production of neodymium metal ===

Neodymium(III) chloride is the most common starting compound for production of neodymium metal. NdCl3 is heated with ammonium chloride or ammonium fluoride and hydrofluoric acid or with alkali or alkaline earth metals in vacuum or argon atmosphere at 300–400 °C. 
:2 NdCl3 + 3 Ca → 2 Nd + 3 CaCl2
An alternative route is electrolysis of molten mixture of anhydrous NdCl3 and NaCl, KCl, or LiCl at temperatures about 700 °C. The mixture melts at those temperatures, even though they are lower than the melting points of NdCl3 and KCl (~770 °C).

=== Lasers and fiber amplifiers ===
Although NdCl3 itself does not have strong luminescence, it serves as a source of Nd3+ ions for various light emitting materials. The latter include Nd-YAG lasers and Nd-doped optical fiber amplifiers, which amplify light emitted by other lasers. The Nd-YAG laser emits infrared light at 1.064 micrometres and is the most popular solid-state laser (i.e. laser based on a solid medium). The reason for using NdCl3 rather than metallic neodymium or its oxide, in fabrication of fibers is easy decomposition of NdCl3 during the chemical vapor deposition; the latter process is widely used for the fiber grows.

Neodymium(III) chloride is a dopant not only of traditional silica-based optical fibers, but of plastic fibers (dopedphotolime-gelatin, polyimide, polyethylene, etc.) as well. It is also used in as an additive into infrared organic light-emitting diodes. Besides, neodymium doped organic films can not only act as LEDs, but also as color filters improving the LED emission spectrum.

Solubility of neodymium(III) chloride (and other rare-earth salts) is various solvents results in a new type of rare-earth laser, which uses not a solid but liquid as an active medium. The liquid containing Nd3+ ions is prepared in the following reactions:

:SnCl4 + 2 SeOCl2 → SnCl62− + 2 SeOCl+
:SbCl5 + SeOCl2 → SbCl6− + SeOCl+
:3 SeOCl+ + NdCl3 → Nd3+(solv) + 3 SeOCl2,

where Nd3+ is in fact the solvated ion with several selenium oxychloride molecules coordinated in the first coordination sphere, that is [Nd(SeOCl2)m]3+. The laser liquids prepared by this technique emits at the same wavelength of 1.064 micrometres and possess properties, such as high gain and sharpness of the emission, that are more characteristic of crystalline than Nd-glass lasers. The quantum efficiency of those liquid lasers was about 0.75 relative to the traditional Nd:YAG laser.

=== Catalysis ===
Another important application of NdCl3 is in catalysis—in combination with organic chemicals, such as triethylaluminium and 2-propanol, it accelerates polymerization of various dienes. The products include such general purpose synthetic rubbers as polybutylene, polybutadiene, and polyisoprene.

Neodymium(III) chloride is also used to modify titanium dioxide. The latter is one of the most popular inorganic photocatalyst for decomposition of phenol, various dyes and other waste water contaminants. The catalytic action of titanium oxide has to be activated by UV light, i.e. artificial illumination. However, modifying titanium oxide with neodymium(III) chloride allows catalysis under visible illumination, such as sun light. The modified catalyst is prepared by chemical coprecipitation–peptization method by ammonium hydroxide from mixture of TiCl4 and NdCl3 in aqueous solution). This process is used commercially on large scale on 1000 liter reactor for using in photocatalytic self-cleaning paints.

=== Corrosion protection ===
Other applications are being developed. For example, it was reported that coating of aluminium or various aluminium alloys produces very corrosion-resistance surface, which then resisted immersion into concentrated aqueous solution of NaCl for two months without sign of pitting. The coating is produced either by immersion into aqueous solution of NdCl3 for a week or by electrolytic deposition using the same solution. In comparison with traditional chromium based corrosion inhibitors, NdCl3 and other rare-earth salts are environment friendly and much less toxic to humans and animals.

The protective action of NdCl3 on aluminium alloys is based on formation of insoluble neodymium hydroxide. Being a chloride, NdCl3 itself is a corrosive agent, which is sometimes used for corrosion testing of ceramics.

=== Labeling of organic molecules ===
Lanthanides, including neodymium are famous for their bright luminescence and therefore are widely used as fluorescent labels. In particular, NdCl3 has been incorporated into organic molecules, such as DNA, which could be then easily traced using a fluorescence microscope during various physical and chemical reactions.

== Health issues ==
Neodymium(III) chloride does not seem toxic to humans and animals (approximately similar to table salt). The LD50 (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for animals is about 3.7 g per kg of body weight (mouse, oral), 0.15 g/kg (rabbit, intravenous injection). Mild irritation of skin occurs upon exposure with 500 mg during 24 hrs (Draize test on rabbits). Substances with LD50 above 2 g/kg are considered non-toxic.

<doc id="1220801" wikidata="Q1048260" url="?curid=1220801" title="Thankful (Kelly Clarkson album)">
<text>Thankful is the debut studio album by American singer Kelly Clarkson, released in the United States by RCA Records on April 15, 2003. &quot;Miss Independent&quot; was its first single, followed by &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;The Trouble with Love Is&quot;. Initially, the album had been scheduled to be released in November 2002, however, Clarkson&#x27;s demanding schedule and difficulty finding tracks that suited her taste and image forced the album to be delayed several times. By the time the album was released, over six months had elapsed since &quot;A Moment Like This&quot; had reached number one.

The album debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 selling 297,000 copies. &quot;Miss Independent&quot; went on to be a top ten hit in the United States. &quot;Thankful&quot; has sold 2,800,000 copies in the United States, receiving a 2× platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). In Canada, &quot;Thankful&quot; was certified platinum for 100,000 copies shipped by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA).

==Background==
Two songs originally on the album, &quot;Trace of Gold&quot; and &quot;Today for Me&quot;, written by Stephanie Saraco, were replaced just before the album release by &quot;Anytime&quot; and &quot;A Moment Like This&quot;. Early released versions of the CD still show the original tracks on players that read the data from the CD itself (such as Windows Media Player). The two songs have yet to be heard by the general public. Copies of &quot;Thankful&quot; sold during its first year of release contained a computer program that could be loaded, and used with the internet for artist updates and music videos. The program ceased to function when her official RCA website was launched. &quot;Thankful&quot; included four cover tracks, &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; originally by Aretha Franklin, &quot;Some Kind of Miracle&quot; originally sung by Puff Johnson, &quot;Anytime&quot; by Mary Griffin and &quot;Just Missed the Train&quot; by Trine Rein. &quot;Just Missed the Train&quot; was previously covered by Danielle Brisebois and Carly Smithson (then Carly Hennessy), who worked on much of her album with Brisebois.

==Critical reception==
Critical response for &quot;Thankful&quot; was generally positive. On Metacritic, a website that compiles various reviews, the album received a score of 62, indicating generally favorable reviews. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; noted that &quot;Clarkson glides through octaves with the masterful control of someone who&#x27;s been doing this for decades&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album three out of five stars, praising Clarkson&#x27;s talent and vocal abilities, while criticizing the album for feeling manufactured. They note that &quot;[her] high notes are sweet and pillowy, her growl is bone-shaking and sexy, and her midrange is amazingly confident for a pop posy whose career is tied for eternity to the whims of her American Idol overlords&quot;.

On the other hand, &quot;Q&quot; gave the album a very negative review, stating that the album &quot;has her trilling like Mariah Carey on fluffy R&amp;B tunes.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
Release of the album was preceded by the single &quot;Miss Independent&quot;, which became a top 10 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit and a number one top 40 smash. In thanks to the success of the single, as well as buzz from her &quot;American Idol&quot; win (Clarkson also appeared several times on the show&#x27;s second season to promote &quot;Thankful&quot;), the album sold well in the United States. It managed to debut at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 297,000 copies sold. The album sold over 1 million copies in six weeks. According to Nielsen SoundScan, &quot;Thankful&quot; has sold 2,800,000 copies to date in the US.
Further single releases &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;The Trouble with Love Is&quot; did not replicate the success of the first single. &quot;Just Missed the Train&quot; and &quot;You Thought Wrong&quot; had been planned for possible single releases, but after the underperformance of &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;The Trouble with Love Is&quot;, they were canceled.

<doc id="1220813" wikidata="Q777300" url="?curid=1220813" title="Distancing effect">
<text>The distancing effect, also translated as alienation effect ( or &quot;V-Effekt&quot;), is a concept in performing arts credited to German playwright Bertolt Brecht.

Brecht first used the term in his essay &quot;Alienation Effects in Chinese Acting&quot; published in 1936, in which he described it as performing &quot;in such a way that the audience was hindered from simply identifying itself with the characters in the play. Acceptance or rejection of their actions and utterances was meant to take place on a conscious plane, instead of, as hitherto, in the audience&#x27;s subconscious&quot;.

== Origin ==
The term &quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot; is rooted in the Russian Formalist notion of the device of &quot;making strange&quot; (приём остранения &quot;priyom ostraneniya&quot;), which literary critic Viktor Shklovsky claims is the essence of all art. Lemon and Reis&#x27;s 1965 English translation of Shklovsky&#x27;s 1917 coinage as &quot;defamiliarization&quot;, combined with John Willett&#x27;s 1964 translation of Brecht&#x27;s 1935 coinage as &quot;alienation effect&quot;—and the canonization of both translations in Anglophone literary theory in the decades since—has served to obscure the close connections between the two terms. Not only is the root of both terms &quot;strange&quot; (&quot;stran-&quot; in Russian, &quot;fremd&quot; in German), but both terms are unusual in their respective languages: &quot;ostranenie&quot; is a neologism in Russian, while &quot;Verfremdung&quot; is a resuscitation of a long-obsolete term in German. In addition, according to some accounts, Shklovsky&#x27;s Russian friend playwright Sergei Tretyakov taught Shklovsky&#x27;s term to Brecht during Brecht&#x27;s visit to Moscow in the spring of 1935. For this reason, many scholars have recently taken to using &quot;estrangement&quot; to translate both terms: &quot;the estrangement device&quot; in Shklovsky, &quot;the estrangement effect&quot; in Brecht.

It was in any case not long after returning in the spring of 1935 from Moscow, where he saw a command performance of Beijing Opera techniques by Mei Lanfang, that Brecht first used the German term in print to label an approach to theater that discouraged involving the audience in an illusory narrative world and in the emotions of the characters. Brecht thought the audience required an emotional distance to reflect on what was being presented in critical and objective ways, rather than being &quot;taken out of themselves&quot; as conventional entertainment attempts to do.

The proper English translation of &quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot; is a matter of controversy. The word is sometimes rendered as &quot;defamiliarization effect&quot;, &quot;estrangement effect&quot;, &quot;distantiation&quot;, &quot;alienation effect&quot;, or &quot;distancing effect&quot;. This has caused some confusion for English scholars who confuse the German word &quot;Verfremdung&quot; with &quot;Entfremdung&quot;. In &quot;Brecht and Method&quot;, Fredric Jameson abbreviates &quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot; as &quot;the V-Effekt&quot;; many scholars similarly leave the word untranslated.

Brecht wanted to &quot;distance&quot; or to &quot;alienate&quot; his audience from the characters and the action and, by dint of that, render them observers who would not become involved in or to sympathize emotionally or to empathize by identifying individually with the characters psychologically; rather, he wanted the audience to understand intellectually the characters&#x27; dilemmas and the wrongdoing producing these dilemmas exposed in his dramatic plots. By being thus &quot;distanced&quot; emotionally from the characters and the action on stage, the audience could be able to reach such an intellectual level of understanding (or intellectual empathy); in theory, while alienated emotionally from the action and the characters, they would be empowered on an intellectual level both to analyze and perhaps even to try to change the world, which was Brecht&#x27;s social and political goal as a playwright and the driving force behind his dramaturgy.

== Techniques ==
The distancing effect is achieved by the way the &quot;artist never acts as if there were a fourth wall besides the three surrounding him ... The audience can no longer have the illusion of being the unseen spectator at an event which is really taking place&quot;. The use of direct audience-address is one way of disrupting stage illusion and generating the distancing effect. In performance, as the performer &quot;observes himself&quot;, his objective is &quot;to appear strange and even surprising to the audience. He achieves this by looking strangely at himself and his work&quot;. Whether Brecht intended the distancing effect to refer to the audience or to the actor or to both audience and actor is still controversial among teachers and scholars of &quot;Epic Acting&quot; and Brechtian theatre.

By disclosing and making obvious the manipulative contrivances and &quot;fictive&quot; qualities of the medium, the actors attempt to alienate the viewer from any passive acceptance and enjoyment of the play as mere &quot;entertainment&quot;. Instead, the goal is to force viewers into a critical, analytical frame of mind that serves to disabuse them of the notion that what they are watching is necessarily an inviolable, self-contained narrative. This effect of making the familiar strange serves a didactic function insofar as it aims to teach the viewer not to take the style and content for granted, since (proponents argue) the theatrical medium itself is highly constructed and contingent upon many cultural and economic conditions.

It may be noted that Brecht&#x27;s use of distancing effects in order to prevent audience members from what he characterizes as &quot;bathing&quot; themselves in empathetic emotions and to draw them into an attitude of critical judgment may lead to reactions other than intellectual coolness. Brecht&#x27;s popularization of these effects has come to dominate the understanding of its dynamics. But the particulars of a spectator&#x27;s psyche and of the tension aroused by a specific alienating device may actually &quot;increase&quot; emotional impact. Audience reactions are rarely uniform, and there are many diverse, sometimes unpredictable, responses that may be achieved through distancing.

Actors, directors, and playwrights may draw on alienating effects in creating a production. The playwright may describe them in the script&#x27;s stage directions, in effect requiring them in the staging of the work. A director may take a script that has not been written to alienate and introduce certain techniques, such as playing dialogue forward to remind the audience that there is no fourth wall, or guiding the cast to act &quot;in quotation marks&quot;. The actor (usually with the director&#x27;s permission) may play scenes with an ironic subtext. These techniques and many more are available for artists in different aspects of the show. For the playwright, reference to vaudeville or musical revues will often allow rapid segues from empathy to a judgmental attitude through comic distancing. A notable example of such estrangement in an English-language script can be found in Brendan Behan&#x27;s &quot;The Hostage&quot; (1958).

== Distancing effects in non-Brechtian performances ==
Brecht&#x27;s idea of distancing effects has garnered academic interest from a number of researchers in various non-Brechtian performances. Although the term &quot;distancing effect&quot; was first coined by Brecht, the concept has appeared before his usage. Among some notable studies on distancing effects in non-Brechtian performances are: Ta&#x27;ziyeh (Shi&#x27;ite ritualistic passion play) (Mohd Nasir et al., 2020), Marathi theatre (Mujumdar, 2013), Swang theatre (ancient Indian folk theatre) (Sharma &amp; Kashyap, 2018), beat poetry (Rissover, 2009), Likay (Thai folk theatre) (Tungtang, 2015), and Quranic narratives (Dina, 2014).

Rissover&#x27;s paper discusses the integration of twenty poems (which were either excerpted or taken as whole) by nine Beat poets into the performance of Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;The American Dream&quot;. While Rissover does not exclusively consider distancing effects of Beat Poetry as a poetry performance, the paper still demonstrates how beat poetry is able to project distancing effects to the audience.

Additionally, Mujumdar&#x27;s paper (2013) examined the elements of epic drama (which includes distancing effects) in Tamasha, a traditional form of Marathi theatre. Mujumdar argues that distancing effects have already been present in Tamasha; albeit the concept itself has yet been conceptualized or coined during the 18th century (i.e. the time whereby Tamasha was considered as the popular folk arts). Through songs, narratives, dances, music, and commentaries that are embedded within Tamasha, the audience is said to be unconsciously performing a social role and achieving the distancing effects advocated by Brecht.

Furthermore, Paradee&#x27;s (2015) article emphasized that the extensive use of the &quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot; (the V-effect) or &quot;alienation effect&quot; can be found commonly in Thai Likay theatre. Even though Likay is performed in a way which could be perceived as evoking Brecht&#x27;s alienation effect, Brechtian acting troupes and Thai Likay troupes approaches are distinctly different. While the goal for Brecht&#x27;s alienation effect in the western theatre is to make the audience always aware that they are watching a play, and not being &quot;taken out of themselves&quot; and thus not being distracted from the main meaning of the story, Thai Likay aims to do otherwise.

<text>Sport holds a central place in British culture, and the United Kingdom has played a key role in both the development and global spread of many sports. In the early stages of organized sport, the Home Nations (England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland) were instrumental in establishing formal rules and forming some of the earliest governing bodies, national teams, and domestic league competitions.

Following the partition of Ireland in 1922, some sports organizations created separate governing bodies for Northern Ireland, while others continued to operate on an all-Ireland basis. As a result, in many sports, but not all competitions are organized on a Home Nations basis, with England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland (or Northern Ireland) being recognized as distinct entities. This approach contrasts with most other countries, where a single national team represents the entire state in international competitions.

In a small number of sports, these teams are supplemented by high-profile events, featuring a combined team representing one or more Home nations. The most notable examples of such arrangements are the British and Irish Lions in rugby union (and formerly the British Lions in rugby league), the Walker Cup golf team and Great Britain at the Olympics in relation to Olympic sports ordinarily organised on a Home Nations basis.

In other sports, especially individual Olympic sports such as athletics, swimming, cycling and triathlon, or those team sports invented outside the United Kingdom (e.g. basketball, baseball, ice hockey and volleyball), the United Kingdom generally participates as one nation, usually under the name Great Britain or, more rarely, as Great Britain and Northern Ireland; the latter is the official name of the United Kingdom&#x27;s team at the Olympic Games, though it is commonly referred to, not uncontroversially, as the former. Teams rarely, if ever, compete under the designation &#x27;United Kingdom&#x27;, reflected in the standard abbreviations &quot;GB&quot; and &quot;GBR&quot;.

Overall, association football attracts the most viewers and money, though the nation is notable for the diversity of its sporting interests, especially at the elite level. Great Britain has a special affinity with both Olympic Sport as the only nation to win at least one gold medal at every Summer Games, and with Paralympic Sport as the birthplace of the modern Paralympic movement in Stoke Mandeville Hospital in 1948. The capital London was the first city to host three Summer Olympic Games, and the United Kingdom has twice hosted the Paralympic Games, in London in 2012 and in Stoke Mandeville in 1984.

Major individual sports include athletics, cycling, golf, motorsport, and horse racing. The United Kingdom hosts significant major events across many sports annually, which see a seasonal uptick of interest in that sport for the duration of the event. Tennis is the highest profile sport for the two weeks of the Wimbledon Championships. Snooker and darts, too, enjoy period profile boosts in line with the holding of their largest events.The Boat Race in rowing, the All England Open Badminton Championships, Badminton and Burghley Horse Trials in three-day eventing, the London Marathon enjoy similar global renown within their fields, and peak interest for short periods nationally. The Open Championship in golf also peaks periodic interest domestically as the only non-US and oldest Major, but golf maintains a reasonably high-profile throughout the year and is a significant social sport.

Many other sports are also played and followed to a lesser degree. There is much debate over which sport has the most active participants with swimming, athletics, and cycling all found to have wider active participation than association football in the 2010 Sport England Active People Survey. After the United States, which is acknowledged as the greatest sporting nation in the world, the United Kingdom is considered one of the top performing sporting nations in the world.

==History==
===17th century===
Writing about has explained the role of Puritan power, the English Civil War, and the Restoration of the monarchy in England. The Long Parliament in 1642 &quot;banned theaters, which had met with Puritan disapproval. Although similar action would be taken against certain sports, it is not clear if cricket was in any way prohibited, except that players must not &quot;break the Sabbath&quot;&quot;. In 1660, &quot;the Restoration of the monarchy in England was immediately followed by the reopening of the theaters, and so any sanctions that had been imposed by the Puritans on cricket would also have been lifted.&quot; He goes on to make the key point that political, social, and economic conditions in the aftermath of the Restoration encouraged excessive gambling, so much so, that a Gambling Act was deemed necessary in 1664. It is certain that cricket, horse racing, and boxing (i.e., prizefighting) were financed by gambling interests. Leech explains that it was the habit of cricket patrons, all of whom were gamblers, to form strong teams through the 18th century to represent their interests. He defines a strong team as one representative of more than one parish, and he is certain that such teams were first assembled in or immediately after 1660. Prior to the English Civil War and the Commonwealth, all available evidence concludes that cricket had evolved to the level of village cricket, where only teams that are strictly representative of individual parishes compete. The &quot;strong teams&quot; of the post-Restoration mark the evolution of cricket (and, indeed of professional team sport, for cricket is the oldest professional team sport) from the parish standard to the county standard. This was the point of origin for major, or first-class, cricket. The year 1660 also marks the origin of professional team sports.

===Cricket===

Cricket had become well-established among the English upper class in the 18th century, and was a major factor in sports competition among the public schools. Army units around the Empire had time on their hands, and encouraged the locals to learn cricket so they could have some entertaining competition. Most of the Empire embraced cricket, with the exception of Canada. Cricket test matches (international) began by the 1870s; the first and most famous rivalry is that between Australia and England for &quot;The Ashes.&quot;

===Public schools===
A number of the public schools such as Winchester and Eton, introduced variants of football and other sports for their pupils. These were described at the time as &quot;innocent and lawful&quot;, certainly in comparison with the rougher rural games. With urbanization in the 19th century, the rural games moved to the new urban centers and came under the influence of the middle and upper classes. The rules and regulations devised at English institutions began to be applied to the wider game, with governing bodies in England being set up for a number of sports by the end of the 19th century. The rising influence of the upper class also produced an emphasis on the amateur, and the spirit of &quot;fair play&quot;. The industrial revolution also brought with it increasing mobility, and created the opportunity for universities in Britain and elsewhere to compete with one another. This sparked increasing attempts to unify and reconcile various games in England, leading to the establishment of the Football Association in London, the first official governing body in football.

For sports to become professionalized, coaching had to come first. It gradually professionalized in the Victorian era and the role was well established by 1914. In the First World War, military units sought out the coaches to supervise physical conditioning and develop morale-building teams.

===Sports culture===
British Prime Minister John Major was the political leader most closely identified with promotion of sports. In 1995 he argued:

:&quot;We invented the majority of the world&#x27;s great sports... 19th century Britain was the cradle of a leisure revolution every bit as significant as the agricultural and industrial revolutions we launched in the century before.&quot;

The British showed a more profound interest in sports, and in greater variety, than any rival. This was chiefly due to the development of the railway network in the UK before other nations. Allowing for national newspapers, and travel around the country far earlier than in other places. They gave pride of place to such moral issues as sportsmanship and fair play. Cricket became symbolic of the Imperial spirit throughout the Empire. Football proved highly attractive to the urban working classes, which introduced the rowdy spectator to the sports world. In some sports, there was significant controversy in the fight for amateur purity especially in rugby and rowing. New games became popular almost overnight, including lawn tennis, cycling and hockey. Women were much more likely to enter these sports than the old established ones. The aristocracy and landed gentry, with their ironclad control over land rights, dominated hunting, shooting, fishing and horse racing. Many modern Olympic sports trace their roots back to Britain.

==Administration and funding==
Political responsibility for sport is a devolved matter. As England has no parliament of its own, the United Kingdom Department of Culture, Media and Sport which is headed by a cabinet minister -though the Minister for Sport and Tourism is not in the cabinet- deals with English sport in addition to United Kingdom-wide sports.

Political responsibility for sport in Scotland lies with the Scottish government Minister for Sport and Health Improvement, currently Jamie Hepburn, though is part of the remit of the Cabinet secretary for Health, Wellbeing and Sport, currently Shona Robison.

Political responsibility for sport in Wales lies with the Welsh Minister for Health, Wellbeing and Sport, currently Vaughan Gething. The minister sets out the strategic policy objectives for Sport Wales, which is responsible for the development and promotion of sport and active lifestyles in Wales. Sport Wales work closely with the Governing bodies of sports in Wales to whom they distribute government and National Lottery funding, through grants and awards.

Political responsibility for sport in Northern Ireland lies with the Department for Communities, under Minister for Communities Carál Ní Chuilín. Sport NI is administered by the Department for Communities, and is engaged in the development and funding of sporting activity.

The Sport and Recreation Alliance is the representative body for sports organisations in the United Kingdom, including federations, players associations, managers associations and regional organisations.

A large majority of the funding for elite sport in the United Kingdom is commercially generated, but this is concentrated heavily on a few sports. For example, the English Premier League&#x27;s 20 clubs had an estimated combined turnover of £1.25 billion in 2003–04 according to Deloitte, and British professional football&#x27;s total income was in the region of £2 billion. Other major sports have a turnover in low nine figures or the tens of millions of pounds. For example, cricket is highly dependent on its TV contract, which was worth £55 million a year for the 2006–09 seasons.

Athletics, and also most sports outside the top ten or so in popularity, are heavily dependent on public funding. The government agency which funnels this is UK Sport, which has affiliates in each of the home nations, for example Sport England. These agencies are also responsible for distributing money raised for sport by the National Lottery. In 2005, when it was announced London would host the 2012 Games, UK Sport announced funding plans which were more focused than ever before on rewarding sports which have delivered Olympic success, and as a corollary, penalising those which have not. UK Sport also provides money for the recreational side of the main team sports, even football.

Other sports benefit from special financial provision. British tennis is subsidised by the profits of the Wimbledon Championships, which are in the tens of millions of pounds each year. Horse racing benefits from a levy on betting.

==Popularity==

A 2003 MORI poll found:

A YouGov poll in September 2023 asked which sport was most followed (watched live or support a team) and played.

==Sports media==
The British media is dominated by United Kingdom-wide outlets, with local media playing a much smaller role. Traditionally, the BBC played a dominant role in televising sport, providing extensive high-quality advertisement, free coverage, and free publicity, in exchange for being granted broadcast rights for low fees. ITV broadcast a smaller portfolio of events. In the early 1990s, this arrangement was shaken up by the arrival of pay-TV. BSkyB based its early marketing largely on its acquisition of top division English league football, which was renamed The Premiership as part of the deal. It has subsequently acquired many more top rights in other sports. However, Sky tends to focus on competitions which can fill its specialist sports channels on a regular basis, and many events are still shown on free to air television, especially annual and quadrennial events, such as Wimbledon and the Olympics which are wholly or partially protected for free-to-air broadcast by legislation; such events are commonly referred to in the media as listed events or Crown Jewel events, and often have a particular position within national culture. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland each have their own feeds for BBC1 and BBC2, allowing the BBC to opt out of the United Kingdom-wide programming to show a match in that area. This is often used when all four nations have an International football match on the same evening, but can also be used to show minority interest sports in the country where they are most appreciated (for example BBC One Scotland may show the shinty cup final, while BBC One Wales shows a rugby union match, e.g. a URC match between two Welsh sides). In Scotland, the BBC also operates BBC Alba, a Gaelic-language channel which often broadcasts Scottish sports fixtures, benefiting from the generally lower fees required for minority language broadcasting rights. S4C enjoys the same role in Welsh-language television, and TG4, an Irish language station from the Republic of Ireland but widely available in Northern Ireland by agreement performs a similar role.

In 2006, the Irish company Setanta Sports made a major move into the British market by paying £392 million for rights to certain Scottish Premier League, as well as one third of live Premier League matches for the three-year period from summer 2007 to summer 2010.

Radio sports coverage is also important. BBC Radio 5 Live broadcasts almost all major sports events. It now has a commercial rival called Talksport, but this has not acquired anywhere near as many exclusive contracts as Sky Sports. BBC Local Radio also provides extensive coverage of sport, giving more exposure to second-tier clubs which get limited national coverage.

The United Kingdom does not have an extant tradition of sports newspapers in the mould of &quot;L&#x27;Equipe&quot;, &quot;Gazetta dello Sport&quot; and &quot;Marca&quot; – although publications such as &quot;Bell&#x27;s Life in London&quot;, &quot;The Sporting Times&quot; and &quot;The Sportsman&quot;, all featuring a particular emphasis on horse racing, were popular during the 19th century and into the early 20th century, whilst &quot;Sporting Life&quot; and the &quot;Sports Argus&quot; continued publication until the 1990s and 2000s, and live on as a website and a supplement to the &quot;Birmingham Mail&quot; respectively. All of the national newspapers except the &quot;Financial Times&quot; devote many pages to sport every day. Local newspapers cover local clubs at all levels, and there are hundreds of weekly and monthly sports magazines.

==By sport==

===Team sports===

Four sports in the United Kingdom operate high-profile professional leagues. Association football is the most popular sport and is played from August to May, headed by the Premier League in England, and the Scottish Premiership in Scotland. Rugby league is traditionally a winter sport, but since the late 1990s the elite competition, Super League has been played in the summer to minimise competition for attention with football. Rugby union is also a winter sport, with Premiership Rugby in England, and the United Rugby Championship in Scotland, Wales and Ireland being two of the three dominant leagues in the Northern Hemisphere. Cricket is played in the Summer, from April to September in a variety of formats by professional county teams under the auspices of the England and Wales Cricket Board, while in Ireland, Northern Knights and North West Warriors both from Northern Ireland play first-class cricket across various Inter-Provincial competitions

There are also a number of semi-professional leagues with a national footprint and some level of national media coverage; Ice Hockey operate a league in the United Kingdom called the Elite Ice Hockey League, with at least one team in each of the four constituent countries. Both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball leagues, the British Basketball League and Women&#x27;s British Basketball League operate on a professional basis in England and Scotland, as does the premier netball competition the Netball Superleague in England, Scotland and Wales. All these leagues have small but significant domestic television and media presence.

In Northern Ireland, as in the rest of Ireland, gaelic games, specifically Gaelic football and hurling, enjoy significant support from the nationalist community, although the players are mostly amateur. Despite the amateur status, major games involving county teams from Northern Ireland draw attendances comparable with both rugby codes, and in the later stages of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship comparable with the largest Premier League teams. In Northern Ireland, outside Antrim and the Ards peninsula, Gaelic football is the dominant GAA sport.

====Association football====
The modern global game of football evolved out of traditional football games played in England in the 19th century and today is the highest profile sport in the United Kingdom by a very wide margin. This has been the case for generations, but the gap is widely perceived to have increased since the early 1990s, and football&#x27;s dominance is often seen as a threat to other sports. Each of the four countries in the UK put together its own football leagues for both men and women; there are however a few teams who play in another country.

The only major men&#x27;s national team competition won by a Home Nation is the 1966 World Cup, which England hosted and won, though clubs in both the Scottish and English domestic leagues have had success in European club competitions, most notably the UEFA Champions League or its predecessor the European Cup. Glasgow&#x27;s Celtic won the 1966–67 European Cup, becoming the first British team to do so, with a team composed entirely of players born and raised within the local area around the club&#x27;s stadium, while the following year, Manchester United became the first English club to win the competition, 10 years after the team had been the victim of a notorious air disaster in Munich while playing in the same competition. Liverpool, with six wins, is the most successful English, and British, team in European football, while the competition has also been won by Manchester United three times in total, Nottingham Forest and Chelsea from London twice each, and Aston Villa from Birmingham and Manchester City once each.

The only major women&#x27;s national team competition won by a Home Nation is the 2022 Euros, which England hosted and won. Arsenal, which now shares ownership with the men&#x27;s club of the same name, has won the UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League once.

The Scottish football league system includes Scottish Premiership, played between twelve teams. Two English clubs, Berwick Rangers and Tweedmouth Rangers, both based in Berwick-upon-Tweed in England, play in lower Scottish divisions.

The Welsh football league system includes Cymru Premier (historically the Welsh Premier League) and regional leagues. These leagues have a relatively low profile as rugby union is the national sport of Wales and the top four Welsh football clubs, Cardiff City, Newport County, Swansea City and Wrexham, play in the English Football League. One more Welsh club plays in the English football league system: Merthyr Town (a reformed version of the liquidated Merthyr Tydfil) in the seventh tier. In addition, one Cymru Premier club, The New Saints, play their home matches on the English side of the border in Oswestry. The main Welsh Cup competitions are the Welsh Cup and the FAW Premier Cup. Cardiff&#x27;s 76,250 seater Millennium Stadium is the principal sporting stadium of Wales.
The Northern Ireland football league system includes the NIFL Premiership, often known colloquially as the &quot;Irish League&quot;. One Northern Irish club, Derry City, plays its football outside of the United Kingdom in the Republic of Ireland football league system. Windsor Park, Linfield F.C.&#x27;s 20,332-seater stadium, is also the home stadium of the national team.

Each season the most successful clubs from each of the home nations qualify for the four Europe-wide club competitions organised by UEFA—the UEFA Champions League (formerly the European Cup), the UEFA Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup) and, starting with the 2021–22 season, the UEFA Europa Conference League for men, as well as the UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League. England has produced at least one winner of each UEFA club competition, and Scotland has produced a winner of the men&#x27;s Champions League. Linfield of Belfast&#x27;s run to the 1966–67 European Cup quarter-final is the furthest any Northern Irish or Welsh team has reach in the premier European men&#x27;s competition. Historically Welsh men&#x27;s clubs were able to qualify for the now-defunct UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup by winning the Welsh Cup: a number of Welsh teams enjoyed runs into the latter stages of the competition, with Cardiff City going furthest by reaching the semi-finals of the tournament in 1967–68.

For 100 years until 1984, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland competed annually in the British Home Championship but these ended for a variety of reasons. 2011 saw the inaugural Nations cup, in many ways a reboot of the old tournament. When the idea was first proposed to bring back the competition, the English FA had reservations, and so it was contested by the other three home nations and the Republic of Ireland, who were the first host nation and winners. The tournament was intended to be played biennially to prevent fixture congestion during World Cup qualification years with the 2013 event to be held at the Millennium stadium in Cardiff, the tournament was cancelled after the first year as very few fans were prepared to travel and the tournament did not create the expected revenues. Scotland and Wales were drawn against each other in World Cup qualification anyway, and a 150th anniversary friendly was organised between Scotland and England to celebrate the anniversary of the formation of the English F.A.

No United Kingdom national team has regularly been formed for football events in the Olympics. Proposals to have the United Kingdom (designated by the IOC as Great Britain) take part in the 2012 Summer Olympics with men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams were not supported by the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish football associations. The three bodies feared that Great Britain teams would undermine their independent status—a fear confirmed by FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Nevertheless, Great Britain entered teams in both 2012 tournaments as host. Following the 2016 Olympic Games, the Home Nations agreed to allow Great Britain to attempt to qualify a women&#x27;s team in 2020, with England&#x27;s results, as the highest-seeded of the Home Nations, treated as qualification results for Great Britain, but with Scottish and Welsh players allowed to join the Great Britain squad, technically representing the British Olympic Committee, not the English Football Association, in the event of qualification. England succeeded in qualifying for the 2020 Games and the arrangement, which echoes similar arrangements in rugby sevens and hockey, continues through the 2024 Summer Olympics for the women&#x27;s team. no such arrangement is in place for the men&#x27;s team. England has been the most successful of the home nations, winning the World Cup on home soil in 1966, although there has historically been a close-fought rivalry between England and Scotland.

====Rugby football====
Like association football, rugby union and rugby league both developed from traditional British football games in the 19th century. Rugby football was codified in 1871. Dissatisfaction with the governance of the sport led, in 1895, to a number of prominent clubs establishing what would become rugby league. The estranged clubs, based in mainly working class industrial regions of northern England, had wished to be allowed to compensate their players for missing work to play matches but they had been opposed by those clubs that were predominantly middle class and often based in the south of the country. Subsequently, rugby league developed somewhat different rules. For much of the 20th century there was considerable antagonism towards rugby league from rugby union. One Member of Parliament described it as &quot;one of the longest (and daftest) grievances in history&quot; with anyone over the age of 18 associated with rugby league being banned forever from rugby union. This antagonism has abated since 1995 when rugby union&#x27;s international governing body, now known as World Rugby, &quot;opened&quot; rugby union to professionalism.

=====Rugby union=====
England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland (Northern and The Republic combined together) all field separate teams and are collectively known as the Home Nations. All four teams are among the top ten in global rugby union. The Six Nations Championship played between the Home Nations, Italy and France is the premier international tournament in the northern hemisphere. The Triple Crown is awarded to any of the Home Nations who beats the other three in that tournament. Games are also often played against the &quot;Southern Hemisphere&quot; quartet of South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina—as well as other rugby playing countries. England won the 2003 Rugby World Cup, the first victory in the competition by a British team (or, for that matter, any Northern Hemisphere country), and were runners-up to Australia in 1991 and South Africa in both 2007 and 2019 (the latter of which came after a convincing win against the All-Blacks in England&#x27;s semi-final). In 1987, Wales achieved a best of third place and in 1991, Scotland a best of fourth place. Ireland has not progressed beyond the quarter finals. England (1991) and Wales (1999) have both hosted the Rugby World Cup in conjunction with the other Home Nations. In 2015, England hosted the Rugby World Cup; however, some games were played in Wales.

In the 2011 Rugby World Cup Wales was the only home nation to progress beyond the quarter-finals.

Rugby union has a number of heartlands, notably South Wales, the Scottish Borders, the English West Country, London and the Midlands. Rugby union is generally regarded as the national sport of Wales. England organises its own national league in Premiership Rugby, which launched the Premiership Rugby Cup in 2018–19 to replace the former Anglo-Welsh Cup, which had begun as an England-only competition but included Welsh teams from 2005 until its demise in 2018. The other Home Nations now have a single professional league, currently known as the United Rugby Championship, that also includes teams from Italy and South Africa. Attendances at club rugby in England have risen strongly since the sport went professional; by contrast, the professional era has had a traumatic effect on the traditional structure of club rugby in Wales and Scotland, although the long established provincial structure in Ireland rebounded relatively successfully, and attendances (and successes) there in domestic and European competition, including the team based in Northern Ireland, Ulster Rugby, are comparable to the larger English clubs. Following the regional model of Wales and Ireland, Scotland also originally established four regional teams for North, East, South and West Scotland. Due to the demographics of the country, the Northern region was too vast for a single club to serve (over twice the size of Wales but with only a quarter the population) and the 5% of the population who happened to live in the rugby-loving borders were not enough to sustain the Southern franchise, leaving just West and East. There was some talk of the regions being redrawn, with the North being divided in two and the South being absorbed into the West and East regions, but two Italian sides instead took the vacated places, and still later the competition added South African sides, with two joining in 2017 and eventually being replaced by four different sides in 2021.

All of the home nations play in large, state-of-the-art venues. Twickenham in London, home to the England national team and the country&#x27;s governing body, the Rugby Football Union, currently seats 82,000, making it the second-largest stadium in the country after Wembley. Wales and its governing body, the Welsh Rugby Union, make their home at Millennium Stadium, which is owned by the WRU. Scotland&#x27;s largest stadium, with a capacity of over 67,000, is Murrayfield in Edinburgh, home to the national team and the Scottish Rugby Union. Ireland currently play all their home matches in the Republic&#x27;s capital of Dublin at Aviva Stadium, a 55,000-seat stadium for football and rugby union built on the site of Irish rugby&#x27;s historic home of Lansdowne Road. During the construction of the Aviva in the 2000s, Ireland played many home games in the 80,000 seat national GAA stadium, Croke Park.

As the sport&#x27;s worldwide governing body, World Rugby, is based in Dublin and is heavily dominated by the Home Nations, there has never been a threat to the independence of each country&#x27;s team and a joint team, known as the British and Irish Lions, will tour a Southern Hemisphere nation every four years. The Lions games however do not compete in any major tournaments, and will play local clubs as well as the host nation&#x27;s First XV.

The four home nations also field national sevens teams. England, Scotland and Wales are all &quot;core teams&quot; that compete in all events of the annual World Rugby Sevens Series for men, and England have been a core team in the World Rugby Women&#x27;s Sevens Series since the latter competition&#x27;s creation in 2012. Ireland have not been as competitive in men&#x27;s sevens, but the women&#x27;s sevens team have had core status alongside England on two different occasions—first for the 2013–14 series, and most recently since the 2015–16 series. The United Kingdom currently hosts an event in each (men&#x27;s) World Sevens Series in London; the UK had also hosted a second event in Scotland, but that event was removed from the schedule after the 2014–15 series. The 2014–15 women&#x27;s series saw the debut of a London event, but that tournament did not return in any subsequent series. Rugby union returned to the Olympics in 2016 with sevens tournaments for both men and women; the Great Britain men&#x27;s team won the silver medal, losing to Fiji in the final, and the women&#x27;s team lost in the bronze medal match to Canada. In a contrast with football, the participation of Great Britain sevens teams at the Olympics was endorsed by World Rugby (then known as the International Rugby Board) in 2011. In the Rugby World Cup Sevens, the men&#x27;s teams of England and Wales have both been victorious—England in the inaugural tournament in 1993 and Wales in 2009.

=====Rugby league=====

England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland all field separate teams Rugby league sides. Rugby league draws healthy crowds in its heartlands in Yorkshire and North West England, and is popular with armchair sports fans nationwide. The top-level league is Super League, which expanded to 14 teams for the 2009 season, but was reduced to 12 teams with the end of licensing and a reorganisation of the professional leagues in 2015. In 2020, the number of teams was further reduced to 11 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic; the one Canadian side in the league, Toronto Wolfpack, withdrew (at least temporarily) from the league due to pandemic-related financial challenges and travel restrictions. The Wolfpack had been the first team from outside Europe to play in the English system, having won the League 1 title and automatic promotion to the championship in their inaugural 2017 season and earning promotion to Super League in 2019. As of the current 2020 season, 10 of the teams are in the heartlands, with French side Catalans Dragons being the exception. Before the 2015 reorganisation, London Broncos competed in Super League. Below this level are the Championship and League 1 (historically the National Leagues); French side Toulouse Olympique competed in the championship from 2009 through to 2011, returned to British rugby league in 2016 in League 1, and were promoted to the championship for 2017. The 2020 Championship, abandoned after five rounds due to COVID-19, involved 14 teams, with 12 from the heartlands, London Broncos and Toulouse Olympique. The 2020 League 1, abandoned after two rounds due to COVID-19, involved 11 teams (down from 16 in the 2017 season), with six from the heartlands, three scattered through the remainder of England, and two from Wales. Until 2008, automatic promotion and relegation existed between Super League and the championship when it was replaced by three-year licences for clubs to play in the former. Promotion and relegation returned to Super League and the championship in 2015. The main knockout competition is the Challenge Cup, which also includes clubs from France and Canada, and in the past has also included clubs from Russia.

As a spectator sport, it historically ranks second only to football, with a record high of nearly 8 million spectators attending games in the 1948–49 season. It has also attracted the largest English stadium crowd outside London with the 1954 Challenge Cup Final at Odsal Stadium, Bradford attracting an unofficial attendance exceeding 120,000.

Rugby league is also played as an amateur sport, especially in the heartland areas, where the game is administered by BARLA. Since the rugby union authorities ended the discrimination against playing rugby league amateur numbers in the sport have increased, particularly outside the heartland areas. Through competitions such as the Rugby League Conference the sport is heading towards a national spread, at amateur level at least.

A single &#x27;Great Britain Lions&#x27; team had competed in the Rugby league World Cup and Test match games, but this changed slightly in 2008 when England, Scotland and Ireland competed as separate nations. Internationally, only England (and sometimes Wales) field truly competitive teams in international rugby league. For many tournaments the home nations are combined to compete as Great Britain. The Great Britain team won the Rugby league World Cup in 1954, 1960 and 1972, but England and Wales now compete separately in this tournament and Australia have won every World Cup since 1975 except in 2008, when they were upset in the final by New Zealand. The Great Britain team is retained for some competitions, such as with Australia and New Zealand in the recently founded Tri-Nations competition, and in test series such as the Ashes (against Australia) and the Baskerville Shield (against New Zealand). In 2013, the United Kingdom hosted the Rugby league World Cup for the 5th time, with England and Wales officially serving as joint hosts.

====Cricket====

The early reference to the separate national identities in the United Kingdom is perhaps best illustrated by the game of cricket. Cricket is claimed to have been invented in England. The national sport of England is cricket, but England has no team of its own, instead fielding a joint team with Wales. The England cricket team, controlled by the England and Wales Cricket Board, (commonly shortened to just &quot;England&quot; and &quot;ECB&quot; respectively) was the only national team in the United Kingdom with Test status until Ireland, which represents both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, received Test status in June 2017. Each summer two foreign national teams visit and play seven Test matches and numerous One Day Internationals, and in the British winter the team tours abroad. The highest profile rival of the team is the Australian team, with which it competes for The Ashes, one of the most famous trophies in British sport.

There are eighteen professional county clubs, seventeen of them in England and one in Wales. Each summer the county clubs compete in the first class County Championship, which consists of two leagues of nine teams and in which matches are played over four days. The same teams also play the one day National League, a one-day knock out competition called the Friends Provident Trophy, and the short-form Twenty20 Cup. English cricket grounds include Lord&#x27;s, The Oval, Headingley, Old Trafford, Edgbaston and Trent Bridge. Cardiff&#x27;s Sophia Gardens ground has also become increasingly popular in recent years. Team members are drawn from the main county sides, and include both English and Welsh players. It is by no means equal to football in finance, attendance or coverage, but it has a high profile nonetheless. It is probably the second most widely covered sport in England and third most widely covered sport in Wales and the fortunes of the England team are closely followed by many people who never attend a live game.

Scotland and Ireland both have their own cricket teams, but the game is neither as popular nor their teams as successful as the English and Welsh team. Ireland did not receive Test status until 2017, and Scotland still does not have Test status. Since Ireland did not play its first Test until 2018, Scotland still does not play Tests, and both have only recently started to play in full One Day Internationals, many Scots and Irish previously played in, and captained, the England and Wales side; the current side for example includes Eoin Morgan, a Dublin-born cricketer who has represented Ireland against England at the 2007 Cricket World Cup, and captained England against Ireland in 2011.

====Hockey====
=====Field hockey=====
Field hockey is the second most popular team recreational sport in the United Kingdom. The Great Britain men&#x27;s hockey team won the hockey tournament at the 1988 Olympics, while the women&#x27;s hockey team repeated the success in the 2016 Games. While hockey receives widespread television coverage during the Olympics, coverage outside that is small, especially relative to its participation level. The success of the women&#x27;s team in 2016 has raised the profile of the sport, the women&#x27;s side and a number of the team&#x27;s star players, notably captain Kate Richardson-Walsh and goalkeeper Maddie Hinch.

=====Ice hockey=====

 Ice hockey, a sport that originated in Canada (former British colony), is the only team sport to have a United Kingdom-wide league with at least one team from every nation. It has a long history in the United Kingdom and it is reasonably well supported, with the larger teams attracting thousands of fans to every game. Ice hockey is now being considered the United Kingdom&#x27;s biggest indoor sport and fastest-growing winter sport. The main league is the ten-team professional Elite Ice Hockey League containing three Scottish, five English, one Northern Irish and one Welsh club. The league has featured many former NHL players, predominantly during the two NHL lock out seasons of 2004 and 2013. At the moment the Great Britain men&#x27;s national ice hockey team is in the top division of the Ice Hockey World Championships. The team is ranked 17th in the world in the IIHF World Ranking system as of 2024.

Media support for ice hockey has improved on a national level, although the majority of news is still found on the internet. With a weekly highlights programme Sky Sports covered the Elite league from the 2006/07 season. Sky has also shown a small number of live games, but this has not happened since the 2011/12 season. Following this Premier Sports picked up the mantle for a number of seasons. On 31 August 2017, Premier Sports launched their sister channel FreeSports which showed eleven live EIHL games in the 2018/19 season including the Predictor-Bet Playoff Final and a regular highlights show.

The Elite Ice Hockey League is reasonably well recognised around the ice hockey world, highlighted by the 2010 visit of the Boston Bruins of the NHL who took on the Belfast Giants at the Giants Odyssey Arena in Belfast, Northern Ireland, winning 5–1 over the Elite League All-Stars. The league currently ranks 7th in Europe.

====Gaelic games====
Gaelic games such as Gaelic football and hurling are organised on an all-Ireland basis and are highly popular in Northern Ireland, with a smaller presence in Great Britain. They are regulated by the Gaelic Athletic Association. Six Northern Ireland teams (Tyrone, Fermanagh, Armagh, Antrim, Down and Derry) feature in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, as do the London senior football team from Great Britain. In hurling, London beat Cork in the 1901 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship final, nowadays their hurlers compete in the third tier Nicky Rackard Cup. Antrim are the only Northern Ireland team in the first tier. The female equivalent of hurling is called camogie and is played by teams from Northern Irish and London. Gaelic handball with its roots in Scotland is still played at a competitive level in Northern Ireland.

Composite rules shinty-hurling is a hybrid sport which was developed to facilitate international matches between shinty players and hurling players. International rules football is a team sport consisting of a hybrid of football codes, which was developed to facilitate international representative matches between Australian rules football players and Gaelic football players.

====Shinty====
Shinty (or &quot;camanachd&quot;) is an amateur sport indigenous to the Scottish Highlands. Although it is mostly restricted to this area, it is highly popular within the Highlands, sometimes attracting crowds numbering thousands in what is the most sparsely populated region of the United Kingdom. It is administered by the Camanachd Association. Its main trophies are the Camanachd Cup and the Premier Division. It was once played throughout Scotland and England until the early 20th century. Nowadays, outside of the Highlands, there are also clubs in Edinburgh and Glasgow within Scotland. In England there has been a bit of a revival starting in the 2010s. If London Camanachd was the only remaining English club, in 2013 the English Shinty Association was founded and currently supports four more clubs, Cornwall Shinty Club, Devon Shinty Club, Bristol Shinty Club and Oxford Shinty Club.

====Bandy====
Invented in England, bandy has been virtually unknown in the United Kingdom for most of the 20th century, but this hockey sport played on ice with rules similar to football has been taken up again. The Bandy Federation of England was founded in 2010 and changed names to Great Britain Bandy Association in 2017. The national team for men made its official international début at the 2019 Bandy World Championship and at the 2022 Women&#x27;s Bandy World Championship the national team for women participated for the first time. In 2025 the men&#x27;s team plan to participate for the second time.

====Basketball====
Basketball, a sport that originated in the United States, has been rising in popularity in the United Kingdom. The top-level league is the British Basketball League (BBL) which follows an American franchise format rather than using promotion and relegation. Basketball receives little national press coverage in the UK, although coverage is more extensive from the local newspapers in cities where BBL clubs are based, with publications such as &quot;The Plymouth Herald&quot;, &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot; and the &quot;Newcastle Chronicle&quot; all having dedicated basketball reporters who cover the respective local team. Some national newspapers list results and occasionally provide short summaries of the League&#x27;s news, but more extensive coverage remains minimal. Below the BBL is the English National Basketball League (NBL) operated by Basketball England and the Scottish Basketball Championships (SBC) operated by Basketball Scotland.

The Great Britain Men&#x27;s National Team (GBMNT) and the Great Britain Women&#x27;s National Team (GBWNT) are governed by the British Basketball Federation and represent Great Britain in international basketball competitions. The teams compete in three major tournaments; FIBA EuroBasket, the FIBA Basketball World Cup, and the Olympic Games. Prior to 2006, England, Scotland, and Wales competed independently in international competition except for the Olympic Games and Olympic Qualifying Tournaments.

The Great Britain Men&#x27;s National Team have qualified for five of the last six FIBA EuroBaskets (2009, 2011, 2013, 2017, 2022). An impressive achievement for a nation that had only qualified for six FIBA EuroBaskets in the 60 years prior to 2006 when England, Scotland, and Wales competed independently. England had made four appearances (1946, 1955, 1961, 1981) and Scotland two (1951, 1957). The Great Britain Women&#x27;s National team have qualified for five of the last seven FIBA EuroBaskets (2011, 2013, 2015, 2019, 2023) missing out in 2017 and 2021. In 2019, the GBWNT advanced to the semi-final stage of FIBA EuroBasket Women, the best ever finish for a British national team in a major basketball tournament. Whether competing as Great Britain or as one of the home nations, no British team has ever qualified for the FIBA World Cup during the 70-year history of the competition. The Great Britain Men&#x27;s National Team has played in two Olympic Games, both times as hosts when qualifying was not required (1948, 2012), while the Women made their first appearance in 2012.

The British player Tarik Philip was added to the Washington Wizards roster at the end of the 2018–19 season. The most recent NBA player to have been developed in the British basketball system, South Sudanese refugee and naturalised British citizen Luol Deng retired at the end of the 2018–19 season. At the time of his retirement, Deng career on-court earnings of $151 million, making him the highest earner of any British player in history, and one of the highest paid British athletes. During the 2019–20 season, only one player born in the UK with British nationality was on an NBA roster—OG Anunoby with the Toronto Raptors. Anunoby emigrated to the US as a child, playing youth basketball in Missouri and college basketball for Indiana. Whilst Admiral Schofield, who played that season with the Washington Wizards, was born in London, he has never held British nationality; he was born to a U.S. Navy family, and returned to the U.S. with his family in early childhood. Other British basketball players who have played in the NBA include Chris Harris, Steve Bucknall, James Donaldson, John Amaechi, Robert Archibald, Ndudi Ebi, Michael Olowokandi, Pops Mensah-Bonsu, Kelenna Azubuike, Byron Mullens, Ben Gordon, and Joel Freeland.

As with the NFL and American football, the NBA has arranged regular season matches in London for several years now, the most recent being a 2018 game between the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers at the O2 Arena. Former NBA commissioner David Stern enthusiastically discussed the possibility of the NBA expanding into Europe, at one point envisioning a new division of 5 teams based in London, Paris, Berlin, Italy (Rome or Milan), and Spain (Madrid or Barcelona). Though in 2012, Stern went on to say that of the sites suggested only London and Berlin had arenas of the standard expected in the NBA, while Spain&#x27;s and Italy&#x27;s domestic leagues had become increasingly popular. The idea of a single team or pair of teams relocating to London and Berlin was dismissed as uneconomical due to the distances involved for away fixtures.

A 2018 piece on the web outlet of US sports media giant ESPN explored why British basketball has so far failed to develop players to the degree of countries such as France, Germany and Australia. The first is the dominance of other sports, especially football, in the country&#x27;s sporting culture. A 2016 survey by Sport England found that basketball was the third most-played sport among the 14–25 age group in England, just behind rugby union in numbers—but both sports combined have less than one-third the participation of football. Additionally, a British sport journalist pointed out that football academies are &quot;really bad at letting players out of the system who aren&#x27;t going to make it&quot;, frequently keeping players until age 17 or 18, beyond an age at which they can reasonably be developed for top-level basketball. Another issue is politically related. Basketball is not played in the elite fee-paying secondary schools that produce a disproportionate share of the UK&#x27;s political leaders. Also, several British basketball insiders have cited problems with the sport&#x27;s governance within the UK, with Kevin Routledge, chairman of the BBL&#x27;s Leicester Riders, calling it &quot;shambolic&quot;, and former NBA player John Amaechi saying &quot;British basketball is dominated by people who are well meaning but poorly skilled&quot;. Funding is another issue. The British government provided many sports, including basketball, with major funding in advance of the 2012 Olympics. However, Team GB was perceived as a failure in basketball, with the women&#x27;s team going winless and the men going 1–4, though losing by only 1 point to eventual silver medallists Spain. As a result, basketball&#x27;s funding was dramatically cut. The sport also currently lacks private funding, with Amaechi claiming that many British BBL players are not paid living wages. Finally, until very recent years, British players were reluctant to develop themselves in the more competitive leagues of continental Europe.

====Speedway====
Motorcycle speedway, usually referred to as speedway, is a motorcycle sport involving four and sometimes up to six riders competing over four anti-clockwise laps of an oval circuit. Speedway motorcycles use only one gear and have no brakes and racing takes place on a flat oval track usually consisting of dirt or loosely packed shale. The United Kingdom has three domestic leagues, the SGB Premiership. the SGB Championship, and the SGB National League. The Speedway Grand Prix is the main world championship for standalone riders with an event taking place in Cardiff each year. The Speedway of Nations Final takes place over two days a year and Russia have won three SoN titles in a row since the competition began in 2018. Previous finals have been held at Wrocław, Tolyatti, and Lublin. The 2021 final is set to take place in Manchester.

====Rounders====
Rounders is a bat-and-ball base-running game played on a diamond. Played in England since Tudor times, it is referenced in 1744 in the children&#x27;s book &quot;A Little Pretty Pocket-Book&quot; where it was called baseball. The game is popular among British and Irish school children. In 2015 it was played by seven million children in the UK. Gameplay centres on a number of innings, in which the two teams alternate at batting and fielding. A maximum of nine players are allowed to field at any time. Points (known as &#x27;rounders&#x27;) are scored by the batting team when one of their players completes a circuit past four bases without being put &#x27;out&#x27;. The batter must strike at a good ball and attempt to run a rounder in an anti-clockwise direction around the first, second, and third base and home to the fourth, though they may stay at any of the first three.

====Touch====
Touch (or Touch Rugby) is a limited-contact sport variant of rugby league football. It is typically played with a mixed-gender team of six (three men and three women), with single-gender and age group variants. Teams play on a 70m by 50m pitch with rolling substitutions. There are no set pieces (e.g. scrums or lineouts) and kicking the ball is not allowed. Scores are made by grounding the ball over the score line as in Rugby Union or League; a team is allowed six touches in possession to attempt a score before the ball is turned over to the opposition.

It is administered globally by the Federation International Touch and by the England Touch Association, Scotland Touch Association, Wales Touch Association and Ireland Touch Association in the United Kingdom. The England Touch Association runs three national mixed series from April to September, as well as a men&#x27;s and a women&#x27;s series. More than a thousand players across over 40 clubs are registered to play in these competitions. There are also substantial local and regional competitions, many run with the involvement of O2 Touch.

===Individual sports===
====Athletics====
Athletics does not have a very high profile in Britain on a week-in week-out basis, but it leaps to prominence during major championships. The level of attention received by successful British athletes is illustrated by the fact that athletes have won far more BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards than practitioners of any other sport. The governing body of British Athletics is UK Athletics. There are also semi-independent athletics associations in each of the home nations.

Over the last few decades British athletes have usually won between one and three gold medals at the Olympics; the 2012 Games in London saw three British athletes win four golds (single golds by Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford, and two by Mo Farah), while a further two golds were won in 2016 (both by Farah, who with four Olympic and six World titles is Great Britain&#x27;s most successful track athlete). Traditionally Britain was strongest in men&#x27;s athletics, especially middle-distance running in which Roger Bannister, Steve Ovett, Sebastian Coe and Steve Cram were global stars, but over the last 20 years success has been achieved in a wide range of events and British women have closed the attainment gap on the men, seeing particular success in heptathlon with major titles for Ennis, Denise Lewis, Katarina Johnson-Thompson, Louise Hazel and Kelly Sotherton. However, there remain serious concerns about the depth of the sport in Britain, with the number of club athletes reportedly in decline. In contrast, recreational athletics, especially running has enjoyed a boom under the Parkrun scheme.

Two high-profile annual athletics events organised in Great Britain are the London Marathon and the Great North Run, which is a half marathon, while the elite level Diamond League holds two events in the country, the London Grand Prix, commonly referred to as the Anniversary Games in reference to the 2012 Summer Olympics and the Birmingham Grand Prix. The indoor counterpart to the Diamond League, the IAAF World Indoor Tour also hold an event in the United Kingdom, the Indoor Grand Prix which has alternated between Birmingham and Glasgow.

The United Kingdom also has a significant recent record in hosting major athletics championships, having hosted the 2012 Olympic Games, the 2017 IAAF World Championships, the 2018 World Indoor Championships in Athletics, the 2019 European Athletics Indoor Championships and the 2014 Commonwealth Games between 2012 and 2019. Birmingham held the athletic competition in the 2022 Commonwealth Games and will host the 2026 European Athletics Championships.

====Boxing====

The United Kingdom played a key role in the evolution of modern boxing, with the codification of the rules of the sport known as the Queensberry Rules, named after John Douglas, 9th Marquess of Queensberry in 1867. Britain&#x27;s first heavyweight world champion Bob Fitzsimmons made boxing history as the sport&#x27;s first three-division world champion. Some of the best contemporary British boxers have included super-middleweight champion Joe Calzaghe, featherweight champion Naseem Hamed, and heavyweight champions Lennox Lewis, Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua. Welshman Calzaghe&#x27;s display against Jeff Lacy in 2006 prompted Lacy&#x27;s trainer to state &quot;I have never seen a better performance than that in the world.&quot;

British professional boxing offers some of the largest purses outside the United States to a few elite professional boxers who become nationally known. British heavyweight contenders are especially popular, but most British world champions have fought in the middleweight bracket. The governing bodies of professional boxing are the British Boxing Board of Control and British &amp; Irish Boxing Authority. It is generally felt that British professional boxing is in decline in the early years of the 21st century. The reasons for this include: the fact that football now offers a relatively large number of sportspeople the chance to make the sort of income traditionally only available to world boxing champions, reducing the incentive for athletic youngsters to accept the greater risks of a boxing career; the acquisition of the rights to most major fights by Sky Sports, which means that fewer boxers become national figures than in the past; and the knock the sport&#x27;s credibility has taken from the multiplicity of title sanctioning bodies.

Amateur boxing is governed by separate bodies in each home nation. At Olympic, World and European events, home nation boxers (with the exception of N.Ireland) compete under the GB podium squad banner. British amateurs have enjoyed success in international competition in recent years but unlike their counterparts boxing for the Irish Republic there&#x27;s a tendency for them to turn professional early in their amateur career. The amateur sport is steadily recovering from a decline that reached a peak in the late 1980s, with dramatic increases in boxer numbers driven by recent GB podium squad success, most notably at the London 2012 Olympics. Although Britain&#x27;s top amateur boxers are household names and lauded by the general public, the financial and commercial leverage that professional sports now have on televised media means amateur boxing rarely receives its fair share of T.V. coverage.

====Mixed Martial Arts====

In Great Britain, Mixed martial arts (MMA) failed to capitalise on the early momentum in the United States and has not seen anywhere near the popularity levels MMA has received in USA. However, things slowly started to change when British Fighter Michael Bisping came onto the scene and won The Ultimate Fighter 3. Bisping helped build the popularity of UK MMA alongside Ross Pearson and James Wilks. The 2 winners of The Ultimate Fighter: United States vs. United Kingdom. Michael Bisping coached Team UK opposing Dan Henderson who coached Team USA. The popularity of UK MMA continues to grow due to British fighters and sports personalities including Paddy Pimblett, Dan Hardy, Brad Pickett, John Hathaway, Jimi Manuwa, Rosi Sexton plus many more, including Northern Ireland&#x27;s Norman Parke, winner of The Ultimate Fighter: The Smashes Lightweight tournament and Scotland&#x27;s Joanne Calderwood who competed on The Ultimate Fighter: A Champion Will Be Crowned.

The UK host promotions such as Cage Warriors and BAMMA.

UFC now have contract with BT Sport.

====Cycling====
Britain had limited success with cycle racing in the 20th century, although Tom Simpson&#x27;s world road racing title, and subsequent tragic death on Mont Ventoux in the Tour de France remained iconic moments within the sport. While the Tour de France was consistently popular with a niche television audience on Channel 4, the sport was clouded by doping allegations and lack of mainstream interest. This changed when the performance director of British Cycling Peter Keen (formerly coach of Chris Boardman and later appointed in 2003 as performance director with UK Sport) obtained lottery funding which helped cycling, particularly Track cycling at both grass roots and at an elite level. The first fruits of the programme were harvested in 2000: at that year&#x27;s Summer Olympics, Team GB took two bronzes, a silver and a gold on the track, backing up their success at the subsequent 2000 UCI Track Cycling World Championships on home ground in Manchester by winning five medals. Progress was made in the 2004 Summer Olympics under Keen&#x27;s successor Dave Brailsford, where Chris Hoy and Bradley Wiggins won golds – the first time the British team had won two golds in track cycling since 1908, whilst Great Britain won 11 medals at the 2007 UCI Track Cycling World Championships, seven of them gold, and nine gold medals at the 2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Manchester. The investment paid off in the 2008 Olympics; British cyclists brought home gold medals in seven events, most notably Chris Hoy who became the first British Olympian to win three golds at one Olympiad, earning him a knighthood. Other successes include Rebecca Romero and Victoria Pendleton. Great Britain became the dominant track cycling nation globally until 2021, when they finally lost their place at the top of the Olympic track cycling medal table, just, to Netherlands, but Great Britain remain a global force in the discipline.

Success at road racing was also limited, although sporadic success for British cyclists on the road was achieved by such athletes as Tom Simpson, Barry Hoban, Robert Millar, Chris Boardman, and David Millar. The United Kingdom provided no Tour de France champion, or Grand Tour champion, until Bradley Wiggins&#x27; victory in the 2012 Tour de France. This newfound British success continued with Chris Froome winning four of the next five Tours (2013, 2015, 2016, 2017), followed by Geraint Thomas taking victory in 2018. In addition to Wiggins, Froome and Thomas, other British riders to enjoy a significant level of success included road sprinting legend Mark Cavendish, elite climbers Adam and Simon Yates. Tao Geoghegan Hart, and Hugh Carthy, time trial riders Alex Dowsett and Ethan Hayter and the multi-discipline star Tom Pidcock, who won an iconic Tour de France stage on top of Alpe d&#x27;Huez, Olympic mountain bike gold, and World Cyclo-cross gold in a twelve-month stretch. Before 2011, no British rider had ever won a Grand Tour in cycling in almost 100 years, in 2018 all three Grand Tour races, the Giro d&#x27;Italia, the Tour de France and the Vuelta a Espana were won by different British riders; Froome, Thomas and Simon Yates respectively, and between 2010 and 2020, British riders won 11 Grand Tours in total.

Britain has had more historic success in women&#x27;s road cycle racing in producing 4 road racing world champions including Beryl Burton, Mandy Jones, Lizzie Armistead and Nicole Cooke who also won the Olympic road race title and the world championship in the same year in 2008. Emma Pooley won the world road time trial championship in 2010.

Because of the increasing interest in cycling, a British UCI ProTeam (Team Sky) was formed for the 2010 cycling season. Major names in the roster included the likes of Bradley Wiggins, Edvald Boasson Hagen and the 2010 British men&#x27;s Road Race champion, Geraint Thomas.

Cycle racing is organised by British Cycling, who govern most cycling events in the United Kingdom and organise the national team. Time trialling in England and Wales is organised by a separate body called Cycling Time Trials.

The success of British Cycling and team Sky has increased dramatically the popularity of the sport in the UK which has brought in more sponsors into the sport. As well as Team Sky, ONE Pro Cycling and NFTO are aiming to ride in the world&#x27;s biggest races. A lot of cyclists take part in the many sportives organized all over the country including the hugely popular Ride London event which. Words such as MAMIL (middle aged men in lycra) have become part of popular culture.

====Golf====

Modern competitive golf originated in Scotland. In the early 20th century British golfers were the best in the world, winning nearly all of the US Open championships before World War I. American golfers later became dominant, but Britain has continued to produce leading golfers, with an especially strong period in the 1980s and 1990s. There are usually more British golfers than others in the top 100 of the Official World Golf Ranking relative to population, that is to say more than a fifth as many. Several British golfers have reached the world&#x27;s top 10 in the early 2000s. England&#x27;s Lee Westwood ended Tiger Woods&#x27; five-year reign atop the rankings in autumn 2010. In May 2011, fellow Englishman Luke Donald reached the top of the rankings, and by the end of that year became the first golfer in history to top the money lists of both the PGA and European Tours in the same season. Other British golfers to have appeared in the top 10 in the 21st century are Paul Casey, Ian Poulter and Justin Rose, all from England and Rory McIlroy from Northern Ireland.

Golf is the sixth most popular sport, by participation, in the United Kingdom. The Open Championship, which is played each July on a number of British golf courses on a rotating basis, the majority of them in Scotland, is the only men&#x27;s major golf tournament which is played outside of the United States. The most famous of these courses is St Andrews, which is known as &quot;The Home of Golf&quot;. The R&amp;A, the governing body of golf outside the United States and Mexico, is based in St Andrews. Although The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, in Scotland, is the sport&#x27;s home course, the world&#x27;s oldest golf course is actually Musselburgh Links&#x27; Old Golf Course. The PGA European Tour is headquartered in England, and the main European Tour plays more events in the United Kingdom than in any other country. In international team competition the United Kingdom provides a large part of the European Ryder Cup team, which has beaten the United States team in seven of the last eight events.

Women&#x27;s golf does not have as high a profile as the men&#x27;s game, but British players, most notably Laura Davies, have found success on both the Europe-wide Ladies European Tour (LET) and the overwhelmingly dominant women&#x27;s tour, the LPGA Tour in the US Through 2012, the Women&#x27;s British Open was the only event recognised as a major by both the LET and the US LPGA. (The other tournament recognised as a major by the LET, The Evian Championship in France, became an LPGA major in 2013.)

====Tennis====

Tennis is yet another sport which originated in the United Kingdom, first originating in the city of Birmingham between 1859 and 1865 as a more open variant of the historical real tennis, or Royal tennis, often associated with the Tudor monarchy of Henry VIII of England. However, it has not flourished there in recent decades: its profile is highly dependent on the Wimbledon Championships, the most prestigious event of the global tennis calendar. After Fred Perry&#x27;s Wimbledon win in 1936, no British man won the singles until Andy Murray from Scotland did so in 2013. No British woman has won at Wimbledon since Virginia Wade in 1977. In addition, Perry&#x27;s victory in the US National Championships (predecessor to the modern US Open) later in 1936 was the last for any British man in a Grand Slam singles event until Murray won the US Open in 2012. Wade remained the last British woman to win such an event until Emma Raducanu won the 2021 US Open. The governing body of the sport is the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), which invests the vast profits from the tournament in the game in the hope of producing British champions, but a string of revamps of the coaching system have failed to raise the standard of LTA-trained players. The only British players of either sex to reach the world top 50 in recent years are Greg Rusedski, who learnt his tennis in Canada, Tim Henman and Murray, who did not pass through the LTA system either, and on the women&#x27;s side Anne Keothavong and the late Elena Baltacha both slipped into the world&#x27;s top 50 during their careers. Outside of Wimbledon fortnight tennis&#x27;s profile in Britain is low, and since the 2007 retirement of Rusedski and Henman is now largely dependent on Murray, the current UK number 1. Very recently (2015–), the rise of a number of other players, notably doubles specialist Jamie Murray, and younger top 50 players Laura Robson, Heather Watson, Dan Evans and Kyle Edmund has been supplemented by the spectacular rise of British women&#x27;s number one Johanna Konta from a position outside the top 100 to the top ten in the world in just under eighteen months leading to October 2016. As a result, Great Britain had a top ten ranked men&#x27;s singles, men&#x27;s doubles and women&#x27;s singles players at the same time for the first time ever. More recently, Raducanu&#x27;s 2021 US Open win made her the first player of either sex to win a Grand Slam singles event as a qualifier in the Open era, and elevated her into the world top 25; she would finish the 2021 season in the top 20.

Great Britain have won the Davis Cup ten times, with their most recent title in 2015 being their first since 1936. The Great Britain women&#x27;s team made the final of the Billie Jean King Cup four times, losing all four, but their last finals appearance was in 1981 when the competition was known as the Federation Cup.

====Motorsport====

Britain is the centre of Formula One, with the majority of the Formula One teams based in England, and more world titles won by drivers from Britain than from any other country, including Mike Hawthorn; Graham Hill (twice); Jim Clark (twice); John Surtees, also a world champion in motorcycling; Jackie Stewart (three times); James Hunt; Nigel Mansell; Graham Hill&#x27;s son, Damon Hill; Lewis Hamilton (seven times); and Jenson Button. The British Grand Prix takes place at Silverstone each June/July.
The United Kingdom hosted the very first F1 Grand Prix in 1950 at Silverstone, the current location of the British Grand Prix held each year in July. The country also hosts legs of the World Rally Championship and has its own touring car racing championship, the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC), and the British Formula Three Championship.
British drivers have achieved success in the World Rally Championship with the late Colin McRae and the late Richard Burns winning the title. The British leg of the competition is the Rally Great Britain. Derek Bell is a five-time 24 Hours of Le Mans winner and one-time winner of the 1000 km Silverstone, the major endurance race of the country, formerly part of the World Sportscar Championship and currently part of the FIA World Endurance Championship.

Britain hosts one round of the MotoGP World Championship at Silverstone in early September, and celebrated its first motorcycle grand prix world champion since the late Barry Sheene with Danny Kent&#x27;s title in Moto3 in 2015. The UK also hosts one round of the Superbike World Championship, at Donington Park. In the race had become the third Superbike World Championship round in Britain, but since then rounds at Silverstone and Brands Hatch have been dropped. The reigning SBK World Champion is Northern Irishman Jonathan Rea. Since 2000 the British Superbike Championship (BSB) has become increasingly popular. Road racing events are popular, with the Isle of Man hosting the Isle of Man TT and Northern Ireland hosting the North West 200. In rally raiding, Sam Sunderland
became the first British winner of the Dakar Rally when he won the motorcycle classification in 2017.

==== Triathlon ====
Triathlon popularity continues to grow in the UK with membership to the British Triathlon Federation up 174% since 2009, though numbers of participants are larger due to many people who swim, bike or run also participating in triathlons. One reason the popularity has increased domestically is due to the UK&#x27;s strength at the international level with three gold, two silver and two bronze medals at the three most recent Olympic games and many wins on the international circuit. Many races are held over the UK hosted by local clubs with about 213,000 race entrants in 2017. The British Triathlon federation manages the GB team at both the elite and age-group level with performance centre&#x27;s in Bath, Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, London, Loughborough, Nottingham, Stirling.

Global champions for Great Britain include Simon Lessing, Tim Don, Leanda Cave, Helen Jenkins, Non Stanford, Alistair Brownlee and his brother Jonny, Vicky Holland, Alex Yee and Georgia Taylor-Brown. Further success has been achieved at Ironman distances by the likes of Cave and Lucy Charles-Barclay.

====Swimming====
Swimming is the largest participation sport in England according to Sport England (2014). It is larger than athletics, cycling and football.
The swimming organisations of the home countries formed an umbrella organisation called British Swimming in the year 2000. British Swimming concentrates on elite swimmers with podium potential. Britain sends large teams to all the major international swimming events, and enjoy some successes, but it is not currently a leading swimming nation, trailing the dominant United States and Australian teams at major championships, although it is increasingly a power at European level. There has been significant improvement since 2012 under Bill Furniss, former coach of double Olympic and world champion Rebecca Adlington, which saw a record four gold medals in the swimming pool at the 2020 Olympic Games, led by legendary breaststroke sprinter Adam Peaty, and relay stalwarts James Guy and Duncan Scott, who became the first British Olympian ever to win 4 medals at a single games (1 gold, three silver). The sport&#x27;s profile is highest during the Commonwealth Games, when British swimmers, swimming for their home nations, have their best chance to win gold medals, and during the Olympics. The sport has a thriving domestic club structure with competition at all levels.

The provision of 50-metre pools in the United Kingdom was very poor for a developed country, with just 22 as of early 2007, only two of which conformed to the full Olympic standard. There are however far more 25-metre short course pools and other sub Olympic-size competition pools. (See List of Olympic size swimming pools in the United Kingdom.)
The number of 50m pools has now increased and there are 9 full Olympic size pools including the London Aquatics Centre pool which is regarded as currently the best pool in the world.

==== Snooker ====
Other sports with loyal domestic followings include snooker, which is a popular television sport as it fills their schedules at low cost, and also attracts good audiences. However, its popularity has waned somewhat since 1985, when nearly a third of the British population watched the conclusion of the celebrated Dennis Taylor versus Steve Davis World Championship final even though it ended after midnight. All but two events on the professional snooker tour in 2007/2008 are played in the United Kingdom, and the World Championship has been played at The Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, since 1977. There are many amateur leagues set up across the country, featuring team matches between snooker clubs.

==== Darts ====
Darts is another British centred sport with an assured place in the attention of the British sporting public. The two rival Darts World Championships were held in the United Kingdom since their inception. The BDO World Championship began in 1978 and ended in 2020; while the first PDC World Championship was in 1994 and continues to this day. Phil Taylor of Stoke has won more World Championships than any other player. Popular at the same time as snooker, with stars such as Eric Bristow, Jocky Wilson and John Lowe, darts also suffered a decline before the PDC revolution, led by entrepreneur and manager Barry Hearn helped turn the sport around financially and organisationally. The sport remains dominated by British stars, but has now stretched out to success in Netherlands, Germany, Australia and China. Hearn latter became chair of World Snooker, and has overseen something of a revival in that sport also, utilising the wide support for flamboyant seven-time world champion Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan.

====Other individual sports====
Table Tennis is, according to Sport England a widely participated physical activity with around 200000 participants and a large number of regional clubs enrolled to the English Table Tennis Association

Sailing is a niche but a well regarded sport in the United Kingdom. It is governed by the RYA, and there are many locations in the United Kingdom where sailing can take place, both inland and coastal. Media coverage is low except for the Olympic Games, although there is a history of significant media interest in endurance navigation such as the Round-the-World Yacht Race, the Americas Cup and figures such as Ellen Macarthur, Ben Ainslie, Robin Knox-Johnston and the tragic Donald Crowhurst.

Orienteering is regulated by the British Orienteering Federation, and Britain generally puts on a very strong show at the World Orienteering Championships with Jamie Stevenson, second at WOC in 2006.

The United Kingdom has proved successful in the international sporting arena in rowing. It is widely considered that the sport&#x27;s most successful rower is Steve Redgrave who won five gold medals and one bronze medal at five consecutive Olympic Games, as well as numerous wins at the World Rowing Championships and Henley Royal Regatta.

There are many other sports in which Britons compete, sometimes with success, but which do not receive much attention outside a small number of aficionados except during major events such as the Olympics and the Commonwealth Games, or when a British athlete does something extraordinary such as breaking a world record. Examples include judo, gliding, modern pentathlon, figure skating, fives, and sailing.

===Equestrian sports===

====Horseracing====

Thoroughbred racing, which originated under Charles II of England as the &quot;sport of kings&quot;, occupies a key place in British sport, probably ranking in the top four or five sports in terms of media coverage. There are sixty racecourses in Great Britain with annual racecourse attendance exceeding six million and roughly 13,500 races being held across Britain and Ireland each year. The sport in Great Britain is governed by the British Horseracing Authority. The two racecourses in Northern Ireland are governed by Horse Racing Ireland, which runs the sport on an All-Ireland basis. The town of Newmarket is considered the centre of English racing, largely because of the famous Newmarket Racecourse.

The two forms of horse-racing in the United Kingdom are National Hunt, which involves jumping over fences or hurdles, and the more glamorous flat racing. National Hunt is a winter sport and flat racing is a summer sport, but the seasons are very long and they overlap. In flat racing the three races which make up the Triple Crown are the 2,000 Guineas, The Derby, and the St. Leger Stakes. Other leading flat races include the 1,000 Guineas and The Oaks, and these five races are collectively known as the Classics. Apart from the meetings at which the aforementioned races are staged, major flat racing meetings include Royal Ascot, Glorious Goodwood, and the Ebor Festival at York Racecourse. The highlights of the National Hunt season are the Cheltenham Festival and the Aintree Grand National.

====Eventing and showjumping====
The United Kingdom also played a key role in the evolution of three-day eventing and showjumping. Two of the six annual three-day event competitions given the highest classification by the FEI are British, namely the Badminton Horse Trials and the Burghley Horse Trials. Badminton attracts crowds of up to a quarter of a million spectators on cross country day, which is the largest for any paid-entry sports event in Britain.

===Great Britain at the Olympics===
The United Kingdom competes in the Olympics as Great Britain during Olympic competition. The British Olympic Association is responsible for the promotion of the Olympic Movement within the United Kingdom and for the selection, leadership and management of Great Britain and Northern Ireland at every Olympic accredited event. By longstanding practice, athletes of Northern Ireland have the option of being part of either the Great Britain or Ireland teams.

After the 2004 Summer Olympics Great Britain was third in the all-time Summer Olympic medal count (ranked by gold medals), although the majority of the medals are accounted for by some very large tallies in the first few Olympic Games. British medal tallies for much of the post-war period were generally considered disappointing, but the 2000 Summer Olympics marked an upturn and this was sustained at the 2004 Summer Olympics when Great Britain finished tenth in the medal table and the 2008 where it finished fourth behind only China, the US and Russia. This was seen as a great success, and there was a victory parade through the streets of London. This trend continued in the 2012 Games in London. Great Britain again finished fourth in the total medal table (behind the US, China and Russia), but was third in the gold medal count behind the US and China. In 2016 at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro Britain reached all time Olympic best by coming second in the medals table only being beaten by the US. The sports in which the British team has won most medals in recent Summer Olympics include rowing, sailing, cycling, and athletics. In addition to the 2012 Summer Olympics, London hosted the Games in 1908 and 1948.

Winter sports only play a minor role in British sporting life because the winters are not cold enough for them to be practised out of doors very much, with little suitable natural ice or snow. Great Britain is not a leading nation at the Winter Olympics, but has had a few successes in sports such as figure skating, curling and bob skeleton, and has had a guiding hand in the early stages of the evolution of three Olympic winter sports; curling, bobsleigh and alpine skiing. A number of athletes represented Great Britain in the freestyle skiing discipline when it debuted at the 2014 Winter Olympics. Snowboarder Jenny Jones made history at those Games as the first British competitor to win a medal in an event on snow when she took a bronze in the slopestyle competition. Another British snowboarder, Billy Morgan, won a bronze medal in the big air competition in the 2018 Winter Olympics.

==Disability sport==

===Great Britain at the Paralympics===
The United Kingdom has played a huge role in the development of disability sport. The Paralympic Games originated in the Stoke Mandeville Games, which were held at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire in 1948. The Great Britain team does much better in the medal table at the Summer Paralympics, than at the Summer Olympics. It has never finished outside the top five and has been second several times, including the last five games in 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016. The BBC is an enthusiastic promoter of disability sport. Former International Paralympic Committee president Sir Philip Craven is British. London&#x27;s successful bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics also meant that it hosted the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Although Great Britain have been a minor nation in the Winter Paralympics, they have enjoyed particular success in women&#x27;s visually impaired alpine skiing in the 2010s, with Kelly Gallagher becoming the first British Winter Paralympic gold medallist at the 2014 Games, when she won the super-G, and Jade Etherington, Menna Fitzpatrick, and Millie Knight all winning multiple Paralympic medals in the sport.

==Major sports facilities==

In the early 20th century, the United Kingdom had some of the largest sports facilities in the world, but the level of comfort and amenities they offered would be considered totally unacceptable by modern standards. After a long period of decline relative to other developed countries, British facilities have made a relative improvement since the 1980s, and continue to improve.

===National stadia===


Many of the best stadia in the United Kingdom were built for national teams:

* Wembley Stadium, England&#x27;s national football stadium, home to the England football team, FA Cup finals, EFL Cup finals, FA Community Shield, English Football League play-offs, and EFL Trophy, 90,000 capacity. It has also held the rugby league Challenge Cup Final most years since 1929 – with up to a record 99,801 spectators attending (1985). As well as having hosted regular-season games of the National Football League, the major US professional league of American football, as part of the NFL International Series. In both 2011 and 2013, it hosted the UEFA Champions League Final. In the 2012 Summer Olympics, Wembley hosted a total of nine matches—six in the men&#x27;s tournament and three in the women&#x27;s tournament, including both gold-medal matches.
*Lord&#x27;s, England and Wales national cricket stadium, home to England cricket team, Middlesex County team, 32,000 capacity. Lord&#x27;s is widely referred to as the &quot;home of cricket&quot; and is home to the world&#x27;s oldest sporting museum. It hosted the final of the 2019 Cricket World Cup. Bowls, baseball, tennis, archery and several other sports have been played at Lord&#x27;s in the past. The archery competition at the 2012 Summer Olympics was held in front of the Pavilion.
* Twickenham, England&#x27;s national rugby union stadium, home to the England rugby union team and occasionally used for major club matches, notably the London Double Header, 82,000 capacity. Twickenham hosted one NFL International Series game in 2016 and two in 2017.
* Millennium Stadium, Wales&#x27;s national rugby union and football stadium, home to the Wales rugby union and football teams, 75,000 capacity. Also a football venue at the 2012 Summer Olympics.
* Murrayfield, Scotland&#x27;s national rugby union stadium, home to the Scotland rugby union team and Edinburgh Rugby, a professional club team in the same sport, 67,000 capacity.
* Hampden Park, Scotland&#x27;s national football stadium, home to the Scotland football team (the building is owned by Queen&#x27;s Park but also contains the offices for Scotland&#x27;s national team), 52,025 capacity. Also a football venue at the 2012 Summer Olympics.
* Windsor Park, Northern Ireland&#x27;s national football stadium, home to the Northern Ireland football team and Linfield F.C.. Owned by Linfield and rented to the Irish Football Association for national team matches.

===Club football grounds===

British football grounds are almost always football-only facilities in which the spectators are close to the action. Since the late 1980s, there has been a dramatic spurt of reconstruction and replacement of league grounds, which is ongoing, and the Premier League&#x27;s facilities are among the best of any sports league. As of early 2019, there are nearly 40 all-seater club grounds in England with a capacity of 25,000 or more, three in Scotland, and two in Wales. The largest is Manchester United&#x27;s Old Trafford, which has a capacity of over 76,000, and the most recently built football stadia in the Premier League include the Emirates Stadium and the City of Manchester Stadium, with the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium recently opened.

===Cricket grounds===
English cricket grounds are smaller than the largest in some other countries, especially India and Australia, but the best of them have been modernised to a high standard, and two new international grounds have been built in recent years. The largest English cricket ground, Lord&#x27;s in London, is internationally regarded as the &quot;home of cricket&quot;.

===Club rugby grounds===

Rugby union and rugby league clubs are generally poorer than their football counterparts. Some clubs have good all seater grounds in the 10,000–25,000 capacity range; some have older grounds which are still partly terraced, and others play in council-owned joint-use stadia (e.g. the KCOM Stadium). Some clubs rent stadia from football clubs. In some cases, union and league clubs share grounds; one current example where this exists is in Salford.

===Golf courses===

The United Kingdom has many world class golf courses, which can accommodate crowds in the tens of thousands for tournaments. The greatest concentration of these is in Scotland. The Open Championship is always played over a links course, the most famous venue being the Old Course at St Andrews on the east coast of Scotland. The Belfry in the English Midlands has hosted the Ryder Cup more times than any other site. Wentworth Club near London was once the only venue which hosted two European Tour events each season, but it now hosts only one.

===Athletics stadiums===
The provision of athletics stadiums in the United Kingdom is low compared to most other developed countries. The main reason for this, is that it is not considered acceptable to ask football or rugby fans to sit behind an athletics track. This means that athletics stadiums have to be separately financed, and this can only be done with public funds, which have not been forthcoming on a large scale. The largest athletics stadium built in the United Kingdom between Second World War and the 2010s, the 38,000-capacity City of Manchester Stadium built for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, was reconfigured for football-only use after that event. For many years, the largest existing stadium was the 25,000 seat Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield, and London&#x27;s largest athletics venue was Crystal Palace, which has just 15,500 permanent seats. Both have since been superseded by the venue now known as London Stadium, which was built as an 80,000 seater for the 2012 Summer Olympics and became the new home of West Ham United F.C. in 2016. By the time West Ham moved in, the capacity was reduced to 60,000, and the track remained in place, with movable seating added to allow optimal configurations for both athletics and football. Since the retention of the track was a necessary condition for tenancy, the Olympic Stadium won the right to host the 2017 IAAF World Championships.

The Alexander Stadium in Birmingham was upgraded to a long term capacity of 25,000 (temporarily 50,000) for the 2022 Commonwealth Games.

=== Velodromes ===
There are several outdoor velodromes for track cycle racing in the United Kingdom with Herne Hill in London being the only venue from the 1948 Olympics still in operation. There are also five indoor velodromes, one in Newport, the 3,500 seater Manchester Velodrome, part of the National Cycling Centre that serves as the headquarters of British Cycling, as well as the 6,000 seater arena built as part of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the 2,500 seater venue built for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and the 1,700 seater Derby Velodrome which opened in 2015.

===Horse racecourses===
There are 60 horse racecourses in Great Britain, with two more in Northern Ireland (the sport is governed on an all-Ireland basis). The best of them are world class. For example, Ascot Racecourse was redeveloped in 2005 and 2006, at a cost of £185 million.

===Motorsport circuits===
Silverstone Circuit, Donington Park and Brands Hatch are the three international motorsport courses. They have hosted the British Grand Prix, British motorcycle Grand Prix, World Endurance Championship, Superbike World Championship, FIA GT Championship, Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters and Champ Car.

===Indoor arenas===
In the United Kingdom, there is no indoor sport capable of attracting five-figure attendances on a regular basis, and this restricts the development of large indoor arenas. Nonetheless, a number of 10,000+ seater arenas have been built in recent years and more are planned. These facilities make most of their income from pop concerts, but they occasionally stage boxing matches, and other sporting events.

The largest arena is The O2 Arena in London with a capacity of over 20,000, surpassing the former leader, the Manchester Evening News Arena in Manchester. Most notably, The O2 Arena has hosted the ATP Finals in men&#x27;s tennis since 2009, and will continue to host the event through at least 2020. It also hosted the 2013 Final Four of the continent-wide EuroLeague in basketball.

The SSE Hydro in Glasgow, with a capacity of 13,000, was built for the 2014 Commonwealth Games and hosted the 2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships. The National Ice Centre in Nottingham, Odyssey Arena in Belfast and the Sheffield Arena all host ice hockey, the largest being the Sheffield Arena which holds in the region of 8,500 spectators.

Several smaller arenas hosting ice hockey and basketball are found around the United Kingdom, though these generally hold only a few thousand fans. The largest arena in the basketball league is Glasgow&#x27;s 6,500 seater Commonwealth Arena, also built for the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

==Student sport==

Apart from a couple of Oxbridge events, student sport has a very low profile in the United Kingdom. While universities have significant sports facilities, there was no system of sports scholarships, with tuition fees only being introduced in the late 90s. However, students who are elite standard competitors are eligible for funding from bodies such as UK Sport on the same basis as anyone else. The university most focused on sports provision is Loughborough University. Budding professionals in the traditionally working class team sports of football and rugby league rarely go to university. Talented youngsters in the more middle class sports of cricket and rugby union are far more likely to attend university, but their sports clubs usually play a greater role in developing their talent than their university coaches. Some sports are attempting to adapt to new conditions in which a far higher proportion of British teenagers attend university than in the past, notably cricket, which has established several university centres of excellence.

==School sport==
The leading body for physical education in the United Kingdom is the Association for Physical Education. In 2006, the UK School Games was established by the Youth Sport Trust as an annual sporting competition for elite school age athletes in the United Kingdom, and by 2008, was expanded to include nine sports over four days.

<text>Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, 827 F.2d 684 (11th Cir. 1987), was a lawsuit in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that the Mobile County Public School System could use textbooks which purportedly promoted &quot;secular humanism&quot;, characterized by the complainants as a religion.

Parents and other citizens brought a lawsuit against the school board, alleging that the school system was teaching the tenets of secular humanism, an anti-theistic religion. The complainants asked that 44 different elementary through high school level textbooks be removed from the curriculum. After an initial ruling in a federal district court in favor of the plaintiffs, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled that as long as the school was motivated by a secular purpose, it did not matter whether the curriculum and texts shared ideas held by one or more religious groups. The Court found that the texts in question promoted important secular values (tolerance, self-respect, logical decision making), and thus the use of the textbooks neither unconstitutionally advanced a nontheistic religion nor inhibited theistic religions.

This case is occasionally, and incorrectly, cited as proving that &quot;secular humanism&quot; is a religion. The text below shows the Circuit Court, in overturning the District Court decision, made no such finding. They both set aside the question as moot and offered that even if it were (and they were not saying it is), the teaching of science is not invalidated purely because of its association with secular humanism. Excerpt below from the Circuit Court decision (cited earlier):

==Background==
According to Dreilinger, the 1980s were an era where the religious right brought home economics into the culture wars. In the 1980s, the Heritage Foundation published a pamphlet attacking the American Home Economics Association for a broad definition of the word &quot;family&quot; and for encouraging children to make their own choices.

In 1986, an Alabama federal court heard a class-action suit which challenged the materials in 44 textbooks. Five of them, which were on home economics, were deemed the worst by a prosecutor. The case drew national attention from the start, with the National Legal Foundation funding the prosecution. In response, the ACLU and the People for the American Way funded a defense team to work with the state school board&#x27;s attorney. At the time, Pat Robertson was seeking the Republican presidential nomination, and was also the founder of the National Legal Foundation. The judge hearing the case, W. Brevard Hand, was described as a hero for the religious right. The plaintiffs charged that the books established a religion of secular humanism which gave no reason to believe in God. They attacked the home economics topic of &quot;values clarification&quot; - a favorite topic of home economics leader Satenig St. Marie - for venturing too far away from what the plaintiffs viewed as home economics topics like sewing and cooking. The defense focused on religious liberty claims rather than accept help from the American Home Economics Association, and gathered Christian witnesses for that purpose.

Many of the academic experts on both the prosecution and defense sides of the case admitted they had not read the books, had not seen a home economics class, nor had their children taken home economics.

In this first ruling on March 3, 1987, Judge Hand stated that secular humanism was a religion and that the textbooks unconstitutionally promoted it. The ruling also said that the textbooks had to be removed from the classrooms. A few months later, over the objection of Alabama governor Guy Hunt, the appellate court overturned the verdict.
