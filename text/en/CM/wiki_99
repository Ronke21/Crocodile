<text>Failure causes are defects in design, process, quality, or part application, which are the underlying cause of a failure or which initiate a process which leads to failure. Where failure depends on the user of the product or process, then human error must be considered.

==Component failure / failure modes==

A part failure mode is the way in which a component failed &quot;functionally&quot; on the component level. Often a part has only a few failure modes. For example, a relay may fail to open or close contacts on demand. The failure mechanism that caused this can be of many different kinds, and often multiple factors play a role at the same time. They include corrosion, welding of contacts due to an abnormal electric current, return spring fatigue failure, unintended command failure, dust accumulation and blockage of mechanism, etc. Seldom only one cause (hazard) can be identified that creates system failures. The real root causes can in theory in most cases be traced back to some kind of human error, e.g. design failure, operational errors, management failures, maintenance induced failures, specification failures, etc.

==Failure scenario==
A scenario is the complete identified possible sequence and combination of events, failures (failure modes), conditions, system states, leading to an end (failure) system state. It starts from causes (if known) leading to one particular end effect (the system failure condition). A failure scenario is for a system the same as the failure mechanism is for a component. Both result in a failure mode (state) of the system / component.

Rather than the simple description of symptoms that many product users or process participants might use, the term failure scenario / mechanism refers to a rather complete description, including the preconditions under which failure occurs, how the thing was being used, proximate and ultimate/final causes (if known), and any subsidiary or resulting failures that result.

The term is part of the engineering lexicon, especially of engineers working to test and debug products or processes. Carefully observing and describing failure conditions, identifying whether failures are reproducible or transient, and hypothesizing what combination of conditions and sequence of events led to failure is part of the process of fixing design flaws or improving future iterations. The term may be applied to mechanical systems failure.

==Types of failure causes==
===Mechanical failure===
Some types of mechanical failure mechanisms are: excessive deflection, buckling, ductile fracture, brittle fracture, impact, creep, relaxation, thermal shock, wear, corrosion, stress corrosion cracking, and various types of fatigue. Each produces a different type of fracture surface, and other indicators near the fracture surface(s). The way the product is loaded, and the loading history are also important factors which determine the outcome. Of critical importance is design geometry because stress concentrations can magnify the applied load locally to very high levels, and from which cracks usually grow.

Over time, as more is understood about a failure, the failure cause evolves from a description of symptoms and outcomes (that is, effects) to a systematic and relatively abstract model of how, when, and why the failure comes about (that is, causes).

The more complex the product or situation, the more necessary a good understanding of its failure cause is to ensuring its proper operation (or repair). Cascading failures, for example, are particularly complex failure causes. Edge cases and corner cases are situations in which complex, unexpected, and difficult-to-debug problems often occur.

=== Failure by corrosion ===
Materials can be degraded by their environment by corrosion processes, such as rusting in the case of iron and steel. Such processes can also be affected by load in the mechanisms of stress corrosion cracking and environmental stress cracking.

<text>The Right Nation () is a book published in 2004 which charts the rise of the Republican Party in the United States since Barry Goldwater&#x27;s defeat in 1964. It was written by two British journalists, John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described the book as an &quot;engaging study of American conservatism&quot; and a &quot;penetrating analysis.&quot;

The book is composed of four parts:
*&quot;History&quot;, which comprises a discussion of the government careers of the Bush family, a discussion of George W. Bush&#x27;s psychology, and an outline of the fortunes of the GOP during the second half of the 20th century.
*&quot;Anatomy&quot;, which discusses the way in which the Republican Party set about recovering from its near-catastrophic defeat in 1964, the role that think tanks play in the development of policy and political philosophy, particularly the American Enterprise Institute and The Heritage Foundation, and the power of footsoldiers motivated by cultural values in winning elections.
*&quot;Prophecy&quot;, which envisages two possible near-futures: why a Republican hegemony is (they argue) approaching, and reasons why this future may not come to pass.
And lastly,
*&quot;Exception&quot; discusses the theory of American exceptionalism and what it portends for the fortunes of political philosophies in the U.S.

Micklethwait and Wooldridge were, respectively, the U.S. editor and Washington correspondent for &quot;The Economist&quot;.

<text>The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society is the sixth studio album by the English rock band the Kinks. Released on 22November 1968, &quot;Village Green&quot; was a modest seller, but it was lauded by contemporary critics for its songwriting and has subsequently been regarded by commentators as an early concept album. The album was the band&#x27;s first which failed to chart in either the United Kingdom or United States, and its embrace by America&#x27;s new underground rock press completed the Kinks&#x27; transformation from mid-1960s pop hitmakers to critically favoured cult band.

Ray Davies, the Kinks&#x27; frontman, loosely conceptualised the album as a collection of character studies, an idea he based on Dylan Thomas&#x27;s 1954 radio drama &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;. Centring on themes of nostalgia, memory and preservation, the album reflects Davies&#x27;s concerns about the increasing modernisation and encroaching influence of America and Europe on English society. Musically an example of pop or rock music, the album incorporates a range of stylistic influences, including music hall, folk, blues, psychedelia and calypso. It was the first album which Davies produced on his own and was the last to feature the original Kinks line-up, as bassist Pete Quaife departed the band in March1969. It also marked the final collaboration between the Kinks and session keyboardist Nicky Hopkins, whose playing features heavily on piano, harpsichord and Mellotron.

Other than &quot;Village Green&quot;, which was recorded in November1966 and re-recorded in February1967, sessions for the album began in March1968 at Pye Studios in London. In addition to the non-album singles &quot;Wonderboy&quot; and &quot;Days&quot;, the sessions resulted in numerous tracks, some of which went unreleased for years. The album&#x27;s planned September1968 release was delayed by two months in the UK after Davies&#x27;s last-minute decision to rearrange and augment the track listing, but release of the earlier twelve-track edition went ahead in several European countries. The album had no accompanying lead single in the UK, but &quot;Starstruck&quot; was issued in the US and Europe.

Despite its initial commercial shortcomings, &quot;Village Green&quot; has influenced numerous musical acts, especially American indie artists from the late 1980s and 1990s and Britpop groups including Blur and Oasis. Driven in part by this influence, the album experienced a critical and commercial resurgence in the 1990s, and it has been reissued several times, including an expanded edition in 2018. The album has since become the Kinks&#x27; best-selling album in the UK, where the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified it silver in 2008 and gold in 2018. It has been included in several critics&#x27; and listeners&#x27; polls for the best albums of all time, including those published by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine and in the book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

== Background ==

In July1965, the Kinks were informally blacklisted from performing in the United States by the American Federation of Musicians. The circumstances that led to the ban are unclear but likely stemmed from several incidents during the band&#x27;s first US tour; Ray Davies later attributed it to a combination of &quot;bad luck, bad management, [and] bad behaviour&quot;. Despite the Kinks&#x27; recent commercial successes, the band&#x27;s extensive touring and promotional appearances led Ray to a nervous breakdown in March1966.

Following Ray&#x27;s breakdown, the band reduced their touring commitments and spent more time recording in the studio, a change which allowed Ray to develop as a songwriter while leaving him increasingly separated from the emerging youth and drug cultures. Author Ian MacDonald further suggests that the band&#x27;s US touring ban left the group comparatively isolated from American influence, guiding them away from their earlier blues-based riffing towards a distinctly English style. In the year that followed, Ray grew obsessed with aspects of English aristocracy and the country&#x27;s dying traditions. He expressed his pride of Britain in an April1966 interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot; magazine, wishing its culture could remain distinct from that of America and Europe. He further indicated his desire to keep writing &quot;very English songs&quot; and hoped to convey his feelings in a new composition.

According to author Johnny Rogan, &quot;The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society&quot; (often shortened as &quot;Village Green&quot;) reflects a progression in the thematic linking apparent on the Kinks&#x27; albums. Originally known as a singles act, the band assembled their earliest LPs without thought towards making a larger artistic statement. Their 1964 hit singles &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; and &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot; focused on simple boy-girl relationships, a format Ray derided on his May 1965 B-side &quot;I Need You&quot;. Over the next year, Ray shifted his songwriting approach towards social commentary about contemporary British society, exemplified in the September1965 song &quot;A Well Respected Man&quot; and February 1966 single &quot;Dedicated Follower of Fashion&quot;.

The band&#x27;s November1965 album &quot;The Kink Kontroversy&quot; marked the first time Ray composed songs specifically for a single project, resulting in an LP which the band considered their most unified work to date. Ray further shifted his approach with the band&#x27;s 1966 album &quot;Face to Face&quot;, conceptualising an LP made up of songs connected through the use of sound effects and segues. Though Pye Records&#x27;s objections forced him to reestablish the traditional separation between tracks, retrospective commentators often regard the album as one of rock music&#x27;s first thematically linked albums, dealing loosely with themes of English class and social structures. Despite these later sentiments, Ray was unsatisfied with &quot;Face to Face&quot;; in interviews after its release, he disparaged the album as lacking in cohesion.

== Inspiration and conception ==

In November1966, as the Kinks started sessions for their next album, &quot;Something Else by the Kinks&quot;, Ray began envisioning an LP unified around his newest composition &quot;Village Green&quot;. He considered numerous concepts over time, including writing a piece of musical theatre or pantomime or filming a television special with live bands and an orchestra. The band shelved the idea while they worked on &quot;Something Else&quot;, deeming it more appropriate for a potential solo album than a Kinks LP. Ray spent the first half of 1967 increasingly thinking about the form his solo project would take; press releases in June announced that his solo LP would be released in September, and magazine articles in July and August reported that the album would be made up of &quot;orchestra and things like that&quot;, &quot;ideas and songs&quot; or one with &quot;the songs linked up in a musical story&quot;.

In later interviews, Ray has regularly cited the Kinks&#x27; five-year ban from American performance as producing his pivot towards English-focused lyrics. Author Andy Miller instead connects Ray&#x27;s writing to a broader tradition of English pastoral poetry – made up of authors like William Blake, William Wordsworth and Oliver Goldsmith – which often yearned for an idealised past rural England. Academic Carey Fleiner writes that his idealisation of both rural and home life fitted in the revival of the &quot;heritage escapism&quot; trend, which surged across English popular culture following the Second World War. Ray has also discussed his childhood as influencing his lyrics&#x27; sentiments towards village life. Both Ray and his brother Dave grew up in Fortis Green, a suburban neighbourhood of Muswell Hill in North London; though the area did not have a traditional village green as a common area, Ray has regularly described the area in rural terms and has compared its atmosphere to that of a village. He has also mentioned Waterlow Park in the nearby suburb of Highgate and its small lake as an influence.

In writing the songs on &quot;Village Green&quot;, Ray was initially inspired by Dylan Thomas&#x27;s 1954 radio drama &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, a work which focuses on the townspeople of a small Welsh town on a typical spring day. Miller further connects Ray&#x27;s writing the works of English author George Orwell. He and other commentators draw particular comparison between &quot;Village Green&quot; and Orwell&#x27;s 1939 novel &quot;Coming Up for Air&quot;, a work which presents a similarly ambivalent view of nostalgia. Journalist and musician Rob Chapman suggests that in addition to &quot;Coming Up for Air&quot;, Ray&#x27;s lyrics further allude to other English writings, including Harold Nicolson&#x27;s short stories, E. M. Forster&#x27;s Bloomsbury essays and the writings of Philip Larkin. Author Ken Rayes compares the album to the 1925 novel &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by American author F. Scott Fitzgerald, a relationship he thinks is hinted at in the song &quot;Village Green&quot; by the presence of the characters Tom and Daisy, who have the same names as the novel&#x27;s characters Tom and Daisy Buchanan. Rayes writes that Ray&#x27;s notion of &quot;an encroaching modern English culture&quot; parallels the novel&#x27;s motifs of &quot;mythic America and the changing American dream&quot;.
== Recording history ==

=== 1966–1967 ===
The Kinks first recorded &quot;Village Green&quot; at the beginning of the sessions for &quot;Something Else&quot; on 24–25 November 1966. They re-recorded the song in February1967. Though the song was recorded during the sessions for &quot;Something Else&quot;, Ray did not include it on that album in September1967. In November, the Kinks shifted to working on a project tentatively titled &quot;Village Green&quot;, at that time still envisaged as a Ray solo project. Ray wrote most of &quot;Village Green&quot; songs from late 1967 into 1968, though he later suggested that several had been half-finished from years earlier. He generally composed songs on his Fender Malibu acoustic guitar in his living room at 87 Fortis Green, North London.

The band began rehearsing Ray&#x27;s new songs at his home in late1967. Around the same time, they stockpiled studio recordings for later use without initially knowing when or in what format they would be released. &quot;Mr. Songbird&quot; and numerous other songs on &quot;Village Green&quot; may date to around this period. Between late1967 and early1968, the Kinks remained generally inactive as a band; Dave spent time promoting his recent solo single &quot;Susannah&#x27;s Still Alive&quot;, and Ray wrote weekly songs for the BBC variety series &quot;At the Eleventh Hour&quot; between 30December and 2March.

=== 1968 ===
==== March–April ====

The Kinks began recording &quot;Village Green&quot; in earnest in March1968. Most of the album was recorded in Pye Studio 2, the smaller of two basement studios at Pye&#x27;s London offices. The band recorded any time they were able to obtain studio time, generally in the late afternoon or in the middle of the night. While Ray produced, Pye&#x27;s in-house engineers operated the four-track mixing console; the band&#x27;s longtime engineer Alan &quot;Mac&quot; MacKenzie worked on the album until departing from Pye in early1968. Brian Humphries engineered from May onward, beginning with the recording of &quot;Days&quot;.

The band&#x27;s initial March1968 sessions produced numerous recordings, only some of which ended up on the final album, including &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and &quot;Johnny Thunder&quot;. Other tracks like &quot;Berkeley Mews&quot;, &quot;Did You See His Name&quot; and &quot;Rosemary Rose&quot; went unreleased for years. The band also recorded two songs for Dave&#x27;s next solo single, &quot;Lincoln County&quot; backed with &quot;There Is No Life Without Love&quot;. Pye planned to issue Dave&#x27;s single in the second week of April at the same time as the Kinks&#x27; next single, but the band negotiated with the label to delay the release of Dave&#x27;s until August.

After being quickly written and recorded earlier in March, &quot;Wonderboy&quot; was selected by Pye from the available recordings to be the band&#x27;s next single. Despite Ray&#x27;s protestations that the song was insufficiently commercial for release as a single, Pye rush-released it in the UK on 5 April. Its B-side &quot;Polly&quot;, also recorded in March, indicated Ray&#x27;s continued interested in &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; by directly referencing a character in the drama, Polly Garter. Though it was moderately advertised and was well received by music critics, &quot;Wonderboy&quot; flopped in the UK and was the band&#x27;s worst performing British single since 1964. The failure ended the band&#x27;s streak of twelve consecutive top twenty hits, the last five of which had made it into the top five. It sold 26,000 copies in the UK, roughly one-tenth of each of the band&#x27;s two most recent singles, &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; (May 1967) and &quot;Autumn Almanac&quot; (October 1967).

Recording for the album paused from 6 to 28 April 1968 as the Kinks toured cinemas across the UK. Further indicating their diminishing status, the band were unable to support themselves as the headlining act but instead shared the bill with the Herd. Supporting acts included the Tremeloes and Ola &amp; the Janglers, among other groups. Contemporary reviewers criticised the Kinks for their poor stage presence and often inaudible vocals; Dave later recalled that the band were insufficiently rehearsed due to Ray&#x27;s intense focus on his songwriting and a lack of motivation among the other Kinks.

==== May–June ====

The band resumed work on the album in May1968, recording &quot;Picture Book&quot;, &quot;Misty Water&quot; and &quot;Pictures in the Sand&quot;. After the commercial disappointment of &quot;Wonderboy&quot;, Ray opted to record his new composition &quot;Days&quot; as quickly as possible in order to reestablish the Kinks&#x27; status. Recording for the song concluded in early June and it was issued as a single in the UK on the 28th. Though the single was not as successful as the band&#x27;s earlier hits, it received strong airplay and helped them return to the top twenty of the British charts, reaching and in &quot;Record Retailer&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, respectively. Hinman writes that by early June, Ray&#x27;s solo LP and the band&#x27;s next album had &quot;[slowly] mutated into one&quot; under the expected title &quot;Village Green&quot;. Pye Records allowed the band extra time to record more tracks for &quot;Village Green&quot; and made plans to release the album in September in the lead-up to Christmas 1968.

Throughout the 1960s, the Kinks were on different record labels in the US and UK and had differing contract schedules between the two countries. By June1968, the band were contractually obligated to immediately submit a finished LP to their US label, Reprise Records. Of those songs the band had already recorded, except &quot;Village Green&quot;, Ray sent fifteen to the label. The label titled the album &quot;Four More Respected Gentlemen&quot; in reference to &quot;A Well Respected Man&quot;. After Reprise learned about the Kinks&#x27; plans for a September release of &quot;Village Green&quot;, the label planned to not issue &quot;Four More Respected Gentlemen&quot; immediately but instead scheduled a November release. The band again took time off from recording for a tour of Sweden from 8 to 23 June 1968. Because of the band&#x27;s weakening reputation, the booking agency and the band&#x27;s new agent, Barry Dickens, scheduled them to perform at outdoor public parks, seeing it as the only realistic way for the band to turn a profit.
==== July–August ====

After returning from Sweden, the band began rehearsing more songs for &quot;Village Green&quot; in July at Ray&#x27;s Fortis Green home. To boost the album&#x27;s track listing, the Kinks spent most of the second half of July recording new songs. New tracks included &quot;Do You Remember Walter&quot;, &quot;Wicked Annabella&quot;, &quot;Starstruck&quot;, &quot;People Take Pictures of Each Other&quot; and &quot;Sitting by the Riverside&quot;. In late July, Ray and his family moved out of their Fortis Green home to a larger Tudor house in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. Ray&#x27;s previous work had been heavily inspired by life in the original area, not far from his and his brother&#x27;s childhood home. He later reflected that as soon as he moved into the new house he felt unhappy.

In mid-August1968, the Kinks recorded Ray&#x27;s new composition &quot;The Village Green Preservation Society&quot;. Ray intended for the song to be the last recorded for the album, making it a twelve track LP. With its recording, he changed the album&#x27;s title to &quot;The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society&quot; and did its final mixing. Publishing was assigned for the LP&#x27;s songs on 16 August. Around the same time, Ray interviewed with &quot;Record Mirror&quot; and &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (&quot;NME&quot;) magazines in anticipation of the album&#x27;s release, and the album cover was photographed.

==== September–November ====

In September1968, with recording for &quot;Village Green&quot; finished, the Kinks returned to Pye to record Ray&#x27;s composition &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; for a film of the same name. Extracts from the LP were played by Pye executives at the label&#x27;s international sales conference, held on 5 and 6 September at London&#x27;s Europa Hotel, and around 11 September, Keith Altham of &quot;NME&quot; listened to a tape of the album at the band&#x27;s manager&#x27;s office. Before Altham&#x27;s favourable review was published in the 21 September issue of &quot;NME&quot;, Ray had Pye halt the album&#x27;s production and postpone its planned UK release of 27 September.

Ray&#x27;s reason for delaying &quot;Village Green&quot; release is unclear. Hinman writes the last-minute decision foreshadowed major conflicts between Pye and Ray in late 1968. Ray later suggested he was annoyed that the label demanded hit singles from him and afforded little support for full-length LPs, and Hinman suggests this annoyance moved Ray to withhold from Pye any potential Kinks singles. Miller suggests Ray may have desired to increase &quot;Village Green&quot; track listing after becoming aware that both the Beatles and the Jimi Hendrix Experience would be issuing double albums. On 30 September, a press release stated that the Kinks&#x27; next album would be released in a month as a double-record with at least eighteen songs. Interviewed in October for next month&#x27;s issue of &quot;Beat Instrumental&quot; magazine, drummer Mick Avory explained that the band were talking to their record label about the possibility of having twenty songs on two LPs but sold for the price of one, something they hoped would give fans more for their money. After Ray suggested the change to Pye, the label rejected it for financial reasons but accepted a compromise of a fifteen-song single-disc LP.

The Kinks returned to Pye Studios around 12 October 1968 to record more tracks for the album, including &quot;Big Sky&quot;, &quot;Last of the Steam-Powered Trains&quot; and &quot;All of My Friends Were There&quot;, though the latter may have been recorded in July. Ray remixed several songs from the July sessions on 28 October, likely because his original mixes from August had been rushed. He submitted the final tapes to Pye for the fifteen-track LP in November. In anticipation of the UK release of &quot;Village Green&quot;, Reprise cancelled &quot;Four More Respected Gentlemen&quot; in October, only a month before its planned release.

== Production ==
=== Studio aesthetic and sound ===

&quot;Village Green&quot; is the Kinks&#x27; first studio album which credits Ray as its producer. Halfway through the sessions for &quot;Something Else&quot;, he and the band&#x27;s longtime producer Shel Talmy experienced a breakdown in their relationship, resulting in a mixture of tracks produced by one or the other. Engineer Brian Humphries later reflected that though Ray was not formally trained as a producer, he had become &quot;quite knowledgeable&quot; by the time of &quot;Village Green&quot; due to his practice of standing behind Talmy during the production process of the band&#x27;s earlier albums. Ray&#x27;s production of &quot;Village Green&quot; is subdued and his mix is generally light on the bottom end. Author Nicholas Schaffner describes the production as &quot;unassuming in the extreme, with embellishments kept to a minimum&quot;. Ray subsequently suggested he under-recorded the songs, either deliberately or out of inexperience, resulting in a demo-like sound.

The album uses a variety of contrasting instruments and sounds, such as harmonica, harpsichord and flute, as well as guitar feedback. The Kinks&#x27; recording process generally consisted of laying down the rhythm track first, featuring drums, bass and Ray on piano or rhythm guitar. The band would next overdub percussion, keyboards and a guitar contribution from Dave, before mixing down the recording to make room for vocal contributions. The recordings are generally driven by Ray&#x27;s 1965 Fender Malibu acoustic guitar, while Dave often supplemented an electric guitar contribution on Ray&#x27;s 1963 Fender Telecaster or with one of his own guitars, such as his 1959 Gibson Flying V or Guild Starfire III. Dave&#x27;s typical Vox AC30 amplifier was likely used for most tracks, though the long sustain heard on &quot;Wicked Annabella&quot; suggests the use of an early-era solid-state amplifier. Four microphones were placed around Avory&#x27;s drum kit and Pete Quaife&#x27;s Rickenbacker bass was plugged directly into the mixing desk. Avory altered his drum sound on &quot;Wicked Annabella&quot; and &quot;Picture Book&quot; by disengaging the snare and deadened the sound on &quot;Phenomenal Cat&quot; by placing newspaper over a floor tom.

Among the songs on &quot;Village Green&quot; with real string sections are &quot;Village Green&quot; and possibly &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, as arranged by English composer David Whitaker. String and brass sections are generally absent from the Kinks&#x27; late 1960s recordings, likely because Pye executives saw the hiring of an arranger and session players as too expensive to warrant; the album prominently employs a Mellotron as an inexpensive alternative. A predecessor to the synthesiser, the Mellotron is a keyboard instrument on which the keys trigger tape loops of recordings of a variety of instruments, enabling its user to play keyboard parts using those voices. Ray was introduced to the instrument in May1967 while visiting the home of Graham Nash, a member of the contemporary English rock band the Hollies. He purchased his own soon after and likely first employed it in early June1967 on the Kinks&#x27; song &quot;Lazy Old Sun&quot;. The sounds it mimics on &quot;Village Green&quot; include a horn section (&quot;Do You Remember Walter&quot;), accordion (&quot;Sitting by the Riverside&quot;) and flute (&quot;Phenomenal Cat&quot;), among others.

Session musician Nicky Hopkins contributed extensive keyboard work for the album on piano, harpsichord and Mellotron. Hopkins had first contributed to a Kinks LP in 1965 on &quot;The Kink Kontroversy&quot; and his playing featured heavily on the band&#x27;s releases to 1968. He later estimated he played &quot;about seventy per cent&quot; of the LP&#x27;s keyboard work, while Ray played the rest, though the album&#x27;s liner notes credit all of the keyboard playing to Ray.

Ray sings lead on each song except &quot;Wicked Annabella&quot;, where Dave sings lead. Ray&#x27;s vocal is generally double tracked throughout. The group sang harmony vocals together, often supplemented by a falsetto from Ray&#x27;s wife Rasa Davies, who had sung backing vocals on all of the band&#x27;s studio albums to that point. Typical of the band&#x27;s vocal work, their barbershop harmonies include falsettos and wordless sounds like &quot;la la&quot; (&quot;Village Green&quot;), &quot;na na&quot; (&quot;Picture Book&quot;) and &quot;ba ba&quot; (&quot;Johnny Thunder&quot;) or nonsense phrases like &quot;fum fum didle um di&quot; (&quot;Phenomenal Cat&quot;).

=== Band dynamics ===

When the Kinks rehearsed and recorded Ray&#x27;s new compositions, he typically avoided sharing the songs&#x27; lyrics or melody with his bandmates. Quaife recalled: Avory suggested the practice arose out of Ray&#x27;s paranoia that his songs would be stolen, while Quaife ascribed it to &quot;Ray playing silly buggers&quot;. Both Avory and Quaife recalled being annoyed by the method since it prevented them from easily adding fills and embellishments that fitted the song. Ray explained to his bandmates that he wanted the songs of &quot;Village Green&quot; to relate to a single subject but he otherwise remained secretive about the details. Quaife later stated that the band began to understand the album&#x27;s message once several compositions had been finished and that &quot;[a]bout the time of &#x27;Animal Farm&#x27;, it all clicked&quot;.

In contrast to the Kinks&#x27; work under Talmy, Ray ensured the group ran through numerous takes of songs on &quot;Village Green&quot;. Avory recalled that after Talmy&#x27;s departure, the group spent more time collaborating and &quot;[fleshing] out the sound&quot; in studio. All group members contributed to the recording process, though Ray held final say over all decisions. He required all band members to attend all sessions, regardless of whether they were expected to play on the particular song. Quaife recalled: &quot;He&#x27;d keep you there for hours and he wouldn&#x27;t let you out of the studio either. You&#x27;d have to be there even though you weren&#x27;t doing anything.&quot;

By 1968, the Kinks had developed a reputation for group infighting, especially between Ray and Dave, and the group sometimes broke into physical altercations during rehearsals, recording sessions and concerts. Humphries later said that the band&#x27;s dysfunction has been overemphasised in later accounts, adding that rather than fistfights, disagreements typically led to verbal arguments between Ray and Dave. Rasa often served as an intermediary in the studio between Ray and his bandmates. Tensions within the group culminated on 27 May 1968 during a session for &quot;Days&quot;, during which Ray and Quaife argued before the latter left the studio. Quaife remained unhappy following the incident, and he later recalled that he and Ray remained distant from one another during the band&#x27;s June tour of Sweden.

Tensions in the group eased after the Kinks returned to England and resumed recording in July, at which time Ray reluctantly allowed for more creative input from his bandmates. Avory recalled it was the first time in the group&#x27;s history that they worked together during recordings. Quaife was unsure what precipitated Ray&#x27;s change, but remembered the period as being &quot;amazing&quot;, with a &quot;lightened up&quot; Ray allowing them to suggest things during both the rehearsal and recording process. He further remembered Ray&#x27;s reluctance returning near the end of the album&#x27;s recording sessions. Though Quaife departed the Kinks roughly four months after the release of &quot;Village Green&quot;, he reflected decades later that the album was the high point of his career, mostly due to the collaborative nature of its recording.

=== Mono and stereo versions ===

Despite an industrywide trend towards stereo sound, Ray still favoured mono when he mixed &quot;Village Green&quot;. As was typical for the time, he mixed the album in both formats, and Pye released both versions of the album in the UK. In the US, Reprise&#x27;s parent company Warner Bros.-Seven Arts halted mono production in January1968; &quot;Village Green&quot; was therefore the Kinks&#x27; second US LP after &quot;Something Else&quot; to be issued exclusively in stereo.

The album&#x27;s stereo and mono mixes contained obvious difference from one another. Because Ray remixed some tracks in late October1968 after finding his original August mixes rushed, the twelve- and fifteen-track editions contained additional differences. The original stereo ending of &quot;People Take Pictures of Each Other&quot; featured a jazz band coda lifted from a pre-existing tape, which Miller writes served to express &quot;That&#x27;s All, Folks!&quot; at the album&#x27;s close. Ray was forced to erase it from subsequent mixes due to copyright issues, but not before it was included on the stereo release of the twelve-track edition of &quot;Village Green&quot;.

== Songs ==
=== Overview ===
==== Music ====
Among musicologists and band biographers, Andy Miller and Mike Segretto say that &quot;Village Green&quot; is composed mainly of rock and pop music, while Mark Doyle sees it as an album of various genres; Doyle writes it draws from &quot;eclectic and cosmopolitan&quot; styles, fitting in the contemporary Pop art movement. According to Doyle and Segretto, the music incorporates the stylistic influences of &quot;English folk-pastoral traditions&quot;, music hall, psychedelia, calypso, blues, raga rock and acid rock.

Music critics Jonathan Donaldson and Jem Aswad each place the album with the baroque pop of the late1960s – exemplified by the Zombies&#x27; 1968 album &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot;, Love&#x27;s 1967 album &quot;Forever Changes&quot; and the music of the Left Banke – a trend critic Greg Kot terms &quot;orchestral guitar-pop&quot;. The Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s book on the history of music groups the album with the pop-rock of the 1960s and the genre&#x27;s trend towards cohesive albums rather than collections of popular singles. Musicologist Stan Hawkins describes the album&#x27;s sound as generally &quot;flowery, tranquil and dreamy&quot;, influenced equally by music hall and American rock and roll, and author Patricia Gordon Sullivan writes that many of its songs further the music hall overtones first established the previous year on &quot;Something Else&quot;. Ray instead subsequently characterised the album as departure from the band&#x27;s previous music, terming its songs &quot;rock/folk tunes&quot;. Hal Horowitz of &quot;American Songwriter&quot; magazine similarly writes that the album&#x27;s generally acoustic approach and simple production made it more readily described as &quot;melodic folk/pop&quot; than as rock music.

==== Lyrics and concept ====

In contemporary interviews, Ray explained that the songs on &quot;Village Green&quot; are &quot;all related in a way&quot;, and Dave suggested that the album is &quot;about a town and the people that have lived there&quot;, where &quot;the village green is the focal point of the whole thing&quot;. The tracks often serve as portraits of the village&#x27;s inhabitants or as a description of local attractions or activities; character studies include &quot;Johnny Thunder&quot;, &quot;Monica&quot; and &quot;Do You Remember Walter&quot;, about a biker, a prostitute and a lost friend, respectively. Other songs display an interest in memory and its relationship with photographs, such as &quot;Picture Book&quot;, &quot;People Take Pictures of Each Other&quot;, the unreleased song &quot;Pictures in the Sand&quot; and &quot;Village Green&quot;, where the value of the community consists in being photographed by American tourists. In a May1969 interview, Ray stated that the album expressed his love of &quot;traditional British things&quot; and his hope that they would persist. He added: 

While the songs on &quot;Village Green&quot; vary in their adherence to the village concept, the album displays a consistent preoccupation with the past. Academics Robert Polito and Carey Fleiner write that while some listeners regard the album as an indulgence in nostalgia, its songs often instead rebuff those who constantly reminisce on the past. Gentle sentiments about the past are often directly contrasted against a general cynicism or rude voicing. Like Polito, academic Barbara Carroll writes that its songs yearn for refuge from the alienating present while recognising that it is impossible to go back, and Fleiner contends that it recommends using the common cultural experiences of the past to cope with issues in the present.

=== Side one ===
==== &quot;The Village Green Preservation Society&quot; ====
In a contemporary interview, Ray explained that he composed &quot;The Village Green Preservation Society&quot; after someone suggested to him that the Kinks had been preserving &quot;nice things from the past&quot;. The song states the band&#x27;s intentions to &quot;preserve&quot; things and consists of a listing of British institutions to be saved for posterity, including vaudeville, the George Cross medal and its recipients, draught beer and virginity, among others. Ray subsequently described the song as the album&#x27;s &quot;national anthem&quot;. Employing a simple composition, its arrangement is defined by what Miller terms Avory&#x27;s &quot;especially exuberant&quot; drumming and the &quot;similarly light and effective&quot; piano contribution. Ray and Dave closely harmonise throughout, while Ray&#x27;s voice is emphasised at the midway point and its closing.

==== &quot;Do You Remember Walter&quot; ====
Ray was inspired to compose &quot;Do You Remember Walter&quot; after running into a childhood friend and finding they no longer had anything in common. The singer recalls his and Walter&#x27;s various childhood exploits, which he contrasts against the older Walter who he expects is now fat and married. He mocks Walter&#x27;s early bedtime, while he imagines that Walter would be uninterested in his reminiscing of the past. Rogan compares the song to Ray&#x27;s 1967 composition &quot;David Watts&quot; and suggests it conveys &quot;a loss of almost tragic proportions&quot; when the Walter character is &quot;demythologised in adulthood&quot;. In his November1968 interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Ray stated that the song&#x27;s message was summarised in its closing line: &quot;People often change but memories of people can remain&quot;. After opening with what Rogan terms &quot;machine gun drumming&quot;, the song is defined by a dominant piano and bass guitar, alongside snare rolls.

==== &quot;Picture Book&quot; ====
&quot;Picture Book&quot; describes an ageing narrator&#x27;s experience flipping through a photo album reflecting on happy memories from &quot;a long time ago&quot;. The vocals include wordless barbershop-like harmonies as well as Ray singing &quot;scooby dooby doo&quot; in reference to Frank Sinatra&#x27;s 1966 single &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot;. The song employs two acoustic guitars and an overdubbed electric guitar. Quaife doubles Ray&#x27;s rhythm guitar with his bass in playing the song&#x27;s distinctive hook. Unlike most of the album&#x27;s songs, its mix emphasises the low-end, particularly Quaife&#x27;s bass guitar and Avory&#x27;s drums, the latter of which critic Stewart Mason terms &quot;cleverly sloppy&quot;.
==== &quot;Johnny Thunder&quot; ====
Ray composed &quot;Johnny Thunder&quot; after watching László Benedek&#x27;s 1953 film &quot;The Wild One&quot;, which had been banned by British censors until February1968. Like the film&#x27;s lead character Johnny, played by Marlon Brando, Johnny Thunder is a rebellious biker and an enemy of conformity. A straightforward rock song, the recording joins acoustic guitars, bass and drums with an electric guitar contribution by Dave, who plays a countermelody low in the mix. The backing vocals are wordless and imitate the sound of a brass section, while it is one of the few instances on the album of Ray&#x27;s lead vocal not being double-tracked.

==== &quot;Last of the Steam-Powered Trains&quot; ====

&quot;Last of the Steam-Powered Trains&quot; is likely the last song Ray wrote for &quot;Village Green&quot;. Its lyrics describe a steam train that has outlived its usefulness and moved to a museum. The composition coincided with a years-long reduction in the British railway network and the replacement of steam trains by diesel engines, a change which went into effect two months before the song&#x27;s recording. Based around the riff of Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s 1956 song &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot; – a popular recording among early 1960s British R&amp;B groups – the song recalls the Kinks&#x27; roots as an R&amp;B focused band. Several commentators regard the song as Ray&#x27;s criticism of early British R&amp;B groups for being inauthentic compared to the American blues artists who wrote many of the songs they recorded, while others think it expresses his feelings of disconnect from contemporary culture.

==== &quot;Big Sky&quot; ====

Ray composed &quot;Big Sky&quot; in late January1968 while attending the second annual &quot;MIDEM&quot; festival, a music publishers gathering held in Cannes, France. While watching the sunrise from his balcony at the Carlton Hotel, he noticed the businessmen walking below, a moment which inspired the line &quot;Big Sky looking down on all the people&quot;. While Ray has typically been coy about interpreting the song&#x27;s meaning, retrospective commentators often interpret it as describing God as unsympathetic towards the problems of humans. Ray&#x27;s lead vocal alternates between singing, speaking and harmonising with Dave while Rasa contributes a wordless falsetto harmony. Ray compared his spoken lyric to the voice of God, and Dave later suggested that Ray was impersonating American actor Burt Lancaster.

==== &quot;Sitting by the Riverside&quot; ====
&quot;Sitting by the Riverside&quot; joins honky-tonk piano with an accordion produced via Mellotron. The singer enjoys the calmness and warmth offered by a pastoral setting before closing his eyes results in a rush of overwhelming memories and fear. Accompanying the eye-closing moment is a swelling cacophony reminiscent of the orchestral crescendos heard in the Beatles&#x27; 1967 song &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;. When the singer reopens his eyes, he is overtaken by the area&#x27;s splendor. Ray contemporaneously described the composition as a &quot;fishing song&quot; and related it to his time spent fishing when he was a child.

=== Side two ===
==== &quot;Animal Farm&quot; ====
Side two of the LP opens with &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. While its title references Orwell&#x27;s 1945 novella of the same name, the song does not relate to the book&#x27;s dystopic themes, but instead displays an anti-urban theme. The song&#x27;s narrator expresses feelings of pastoral bliss, recalling an earlier time when he was happy living a simple life on a small farm. He yearns for his idealised world where people can be authentic rather than insincere actors. Recorded in Pye Studios&#x27;s bigger studio, , the song has a larger sound than the rest of the album, featuring reverb on the drums, percussion and tack piano.

==== &quot;Village Green&quot; ====

Ray composed &quot;Village Green&quot; in August1966 while touring in rural England. He later recalled the song spawning from his disappointment after finding out that the beer at a pub was stored in a pressurised metal keg rather than in a traditional wooden barrel. The song&#x27;s lyrics lament the decline of a fictional English community&#x27;s traditional village green. The singer mourns the town&#x27;s invasion by American tourists and the community&#x27;s cheapening atmosphere, while remembering it as the place he left his romantic love Daisy. He declares that he will return to see Daisy so they can reminisce about the green as it was. The composition and instrumentation of &quot;Village Green&quot; evoke Baroque music; Hopkins played the prominently featured harpsichord, and Whitaker&#x27;s orchestral arrangement features oboe, cello, viola and piccolo, all played by session musicians.

==== &quot;Starstruck&quot; ====
Ray later said he wrote &quot;Starstruck&quot; as a tribute to his favourite Motown groups, including the Four Tops and the Temptations, and Miller writes it has a slight resemblance to the Four Tops&#x27; 1965 single &quot;It&#x27;s the Same Old Song&quot;. Rogan instead writes &quot;Starstruck&quot; displays &quot;a distinct Acapulco-flavouring&quot; with vocal harmonies influenced by the American band the Turtles. In the song, the singer politely chastises a female listener for failing to distinguish between stardom and real-life and further warns her about the risks of the big city. Miller suggests the song&#x27;s warning about city life is similar thematically to &quot;Village Green&quot;, and Rayes writes its comparison helps contrast &quot;rural with urban, spirituality with materialism, and the natural with the manufactured&quot;.

==== &quot;Phenomenal Cat&quot; ====
&quot;Phenomenal Cat&quot; tells the story of a flying cat who has visited exotic places like Katmandu and Hong Kong. After discovering &quot;the secret of life&quot;, he decides to spend the rest of his life eating. Rogan compares its &quot;vaguely Victorian flavour&quot; to the work of English 19th-century authors Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll, while Miller instead describes it as a blend of contemporary children&#x27;s music and psychedelia. Miller suggests Ray intended the song to satirise the contemporary psychedelic scene, and Rogan similarly thinks it satirises the late-1960s trend of searching for spiritual enlightenment. Ray&#x27;s lead vocal is double tracked while Dave sings as the cat, his voice altered by recording the master tape slowly and then playing it sped-up.
==== &quot;All of My Friends Were There&quot; ====
&quot;All of My Friends Were There&quot; was inspired by a Kinks concert at Rectory Field in Blackheath, London on 1 July 1967. Ray later recalled falling ill with a fever, but the event organisers persuaded him to perform due to the agreed contract. In the song, the singer describes his embarrassment after his friends attend his missed performance. After struggling during his next show, he goes to a café he frequented during happier times in his life, only to find all of his friends there as well. Rayes describes the ending &quot;another typical [Ray] Davies twist&quot;, where &quot;in the end, the presence of the singer&#x27;s friends both deepens his embarrassment and strengthens his stability and sense of companionship&quot;. Played in the style of music hall, the song employs an organ and a jerky rhythm, shifting between what Miller terms a &quot;music-hall gallop&quot; in the verses and a &quot;lilting, wistful waltz&quot; during the choruses.

==== &quot;Wicked Annabella&quot; ====

&quot;Wicked Annabella&quot; features Dave&#x27;s only lead vocal contribution on the album; his voice is double tracked and ranges from frightened whispers to raging screams. The lyrics recount the deeds of a local witch as a warning to children to stay in their beds and avoid the woods. In his November1968 interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Ray suggested the recording was his attempt at getting a song &quot;to sound as horrible as it could&quot;, resulting in an overall &quot;rude sound&quot;. Employing guitar feedback, the song&#x27;s main riff is reminiscent of the Doors&#x27; 1967 song &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, while its conclusion of interplay between drums and guitar features Dave&#x27;s laughter and heavy echo and reverb. Critic Jim DeRogatis counts the song as the only example of psychedelia in the Kinks&#x27; discography, while author Steve Alleman instead writes that its &quot;freakout ending&quot; is one of the few times the Kinks approached the genre, without actually achieving it.

==== &quot;Monica&quot; ====
&quot;Monica&quot; is a calypso number, a genre Ray first explored in his 1965 song &quot;I&#x27;m on an Island&quot;. The composition incorporates Caribbean rhythms and jazz tempo changes, while the recording features acoustic guitar, congas and organ. Possibly inspired by the character Polly Garter from Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, the lyrics are a serenade for a prostitute. In order to avert a radio-ban, Ray was deliberately subtle in its writing and never directly mentions her profession.

==== &quot;People Take Pictures of Each Other&quot; ====

&quot;People Take Pictures of Each Other&quot; satirises the absurdity of using photographs to prove one&#x27;s existence. Ray was inspired to write the song after he attended a wedding and found it strange that the newlywed couple took turns photographing one another. Its lyrics recall the oak tree from &quot;Village Green&quot; and the theme of photography from &quot;Picture Book&quot;, leading Miller to hypothesise that Ray composed it specifically to be a closing track. Rogan describes the song&#x27;s sound as a cross between a Cossack dance and a Greek wedding, something he relates to its original wedding inspiration. It employs a quickly strummed acoustic guitar and fast a breathless lead vocal from Ray. Hopkins plays harpsichord, along with what Miller terms a &quot;silly vaudeville piano vamp&quot;.

=== European format ===

The original twelve-song edition of the album had been completed in mid-August1968 and was released as such in Sweden, Norway, France, Italy and New Zealand. In addition to a rearranged track listing, it includes the songs &quot;Days&quot; and &quot;Mr. Songbird&quot; while being without &quot;Last of the Steam-Powered Trains&quot;, &quot;Big Sky&quot;, &quot;Sitting by the Riverside&quot;, &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and &quot;All of My Friends Were There&quot;.

&quot;Days&quot; recalls a past relationship, the singer remembering either a friend or lover. The song&#x27;s theme of nostalgia lyrically relates it to the rest of &quot;Village Green&quot;, and Alleman writes its motif of &quot;looking back yet trying to start anew&quot; makes it the composition most representative of Ray&#x27;s songwriting in the 1966–1968 period. Instrumentally, the recording incorporates acoustic and electric guitars, bass, harmonium, piano and a Mellotron which mimics a string section. &quot;Mr. Songbird&quot; is about a songbird whose call helps the singer&#x27;s problems go away. Hopkins plays Mellotron to duplicate the sound of a flute, trilling during the chorus to mimic the sound of a bird. Miller suggests the song&#x27;s escapist sentiment is comparable to other contemporary Ray compositions like &quot;Picture Book&quot;, and author Christian Matijas-Mecca writes the song is thematically related to the album&#x27;s &quot;loose narrative about a desire for a lost England&quot;.

== Title and packaging ==

The album cover was photographed in mid-August1968 during a photo session outside Kenwood House in Hampstead Heath, north-west London. Pye&#x27;s in-house photographer John Prosser and Barrie Wentzell of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; photographed the session. After drinking tea on the terrace with the photographers, the band were photographed in their casual attire walking through the Heath&#x27;s long, uncut grass to emphasise a country-feel. Prosser took the album&#x27;s cover shot; the original twelve-track edition featured a black-and-white cover design, while the fifteen-track edition featured a different image, retouched to show the band enclosed in what Rogan terms &quot;hazy, psychedelic circles&quot;. The album&#x27;s twelve-track releases in Scandinavia, France, Italy and New Zealand all feature unique album sleeves which have subsequently become valuable collectors&#x27; items. Having been pressed in Britain, the Scandinavian edition features Pye&#x27;s original black-and-white sleeve design. Fleiner suggests the New Zealand sleeve&#x27;s depiction of the band standing next to several horses sought to emphasise the band&#x27;s &quot;Englishness&quot;.

&quot;Village Green&quot; served as the album&#x27;s working title to mid-1968, though Ray remained unsatisfied that it was too narrow to encapsulate the album&#x27;s broader themes. In a November1968 interview, he recalled that in August, while searching for a new title, someone mentioned to him in conversation that &quot;one of things The Kinks have been doing for the last three years has been preserving&quot;. The comment prompted him to compose &quot;The Village Green Preservation Society&quot;, which subsequently became the new title track.

The LP was the Kinks&#x27; first to feature a gatefold sleeve. The gatefold image is the same photograph as the cover but flipped horizontally, tinted and placed alongside a George Cross medal. The lyrics of the title track appear on the sleeve&#x27;s rear. The album&#x27;s title appears on the cover in small font, with &quot;The Kinks&quot; written large and detached from &quot;Are the Village Green Preservation Society&quot;. Rogan hypothesises that the album was supposed to be titled &quot;The Village Green Preservation Society&quot; but suspects it was changed during the production process. He contends that the simpler title would align with the title track and adds that Ray has typically used the shorter name in his interviews and writings.

== Release and commercial performance ==
=== United Kingdom and Europe ===

In the United Kingdom, Pye planned to release &quot;Village Green&quot; on . Ray began press interviews in mid-August to promote its release, the band performed some of its songs for BBC Radio in July and Pye placed advertisements in several British pop magazines. Following Ray&#x27;s last-minute request that its release be postponed, only test-pressings of the twelve-track edition were made in the UK. Because Pye had already made and sent production masters to several other countries, release of the twelve-track LP went ahead in Sweden and Norway on 9 October, with subsequent releases of that edition following in France, Italy and New Zealand.

Ray&#x27;s last-minute delay of the LP resulted in confusion for both the music press and recording-buying public. Pye instead issued the rearranged and expanded edition of the album in the UK on 22 November 1968. The album had no associated lead single in the UK, but &quot;Starstruck&quot; was released in parts of continental Europe, backed with &quot;Picture Book&quot;. To promote the European single, the Kinks filmed a black-and-white promotional film in . It depicts the band walking around Waterlow Park in Highgate on a cold day and is similar in style to the photographs taken for &quot;Village Green&quot; album cover. To promote the UK album release, Pye again placed advertisements in several British music magazines, the band performed songs for BBC Radio in November and lip synced for television performances on ITV and BBC Television in December1968 and January1969.

The release of &quot;Village Green&quot; was timed to correspond with the Christmas rush, and it was coincidentally issued the same day as the Beatles&#x27; eponymous album (commonly known as the &quot;White Album&quot;), and the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; followed a week-and-a-half later. &quot;Village Green&quot; was moderately advertised and reviewed, but its sales were quickly eclipsed by the other albums – the &quot;White Album&quot; sold two million copies worldwide in its first week, while &quot;Village Green&quot; failed to chart in the UK or anywhere in Europe. Exact figures for LP sales in the UK in the late 1960s are generally unavailable; in 1995, Ray suggested &quot;worldwide we&#x27;d be lucky if it [sold] 100,000 [copies]&quot;. Rogan writes that the available context clues and Ray&#x27;s later estimate suggest that the album was likely &quot;a seller&quot;. Stiff competition from other releases during the holiday season kept the album from appearing in any UK album charts, which often only listed the top fifteen LPs. After &quot;Something Else&quot; failed to appear on most UK charts, &quot;Village Green&quot; absence from all UK charts continued a decline in the performance of the Kinks&#x27; studio albums. The album marked the beginning of a commercial low for the band, from which they did not recover until their late 1970s US revival.

Both Miller and author Jon Savage suggest &quot;Village Green&quot; failed to register with the public, something they attribute to its separation from the contemporary culture&#x27;s focus on revolution, protest and free love. Rogan counters that Ray and authors like Miller have overstated the album&#x27;s commercial failings. Rather than finding the album out of step with contemporary culture, he writes its release corresponded with a surge of nostalgia and escapism in England, and that its championing of country living over city life aligned with the burgeoning ecology movement. Rogan adds that the contemporary music press were typically excited by unified albums and that &quot;Village Green&quot; disconnect from psychedelia fitted with the back-to-basics approach adopted by many of the Kinks&#x27; contemporaries. Rather than laying blame with the album&#x27;s content or its marketing, Rogan attributes &quot;Village Green&quot; commercial shortcomings to the Kinks&#x27; waning popularity and the album&#x27;s lack of an associated single in Britain, which resulted in fewer opportunities for television appearances and publicity.

=== United States ===

In the United States, Reprise Records received &quot;Village Green&quot; master tapes on 20 December 1968 and planned to issue the album in . The label issued &quot;Starstruck&quot; as the album&#x27;s lead single on . The single was initially afforded little critical attention as Reprise neglected to send review copies to US magazines. Reviewers in both &quot;Cash Box&quot; and &quot;Billboard&quot; predicted the single would help the Kinks return to each magazine&#x27;s chart, though it ultimately failed to position in any American chart.

Reprise likely issued &quot;Village Green&quot; in the US on 5 February 1969, though it may have been released in January. It was not advertised or announced in any American music magazines. After critic Robert Christgau requested press material regarding the band in preparation for his album review, Warner Bros. Records sent him a group biography from 1964. Like in the UK and Europe, the album failed to appear in any American charts. The failure continued a trend of the Kinks&#x27; studio albums being outsold by compilations collecting their mid-1960s hits; by 1969, the 1966 US compilation &quot;The Kinks Greatest Hits!&quot; had sold over 200,000 copies, while the combined American sales of both &quot;Village Green&quot; and &quot;Something Else&quot; were estimated to be 25,000. In June1969, it appeared on &quot;Cash Box&quot; &quot;Basic Album Inventory&quot;, a list intended to indicate to wholesalers and retailers which LPs were selling steadily despite having failed to appear on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100 Album chart.

== Contemporary critical reception ==
=== United Kingdom ===

On release, &quot;Village Green&quot; gained favourable reviews from the majority of music critics. The album was reviewed in most contemporary UK pop music publications. Additionally, while discussions of popular music in broadsheet newspapers was still uncommon in 1968, critic Judith Simons provided a brief assessment of the album in London&#x27;s &quot;Daily Express&quot;.

Among British critics, Bob Dawbarn of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; declared in a feature review that the LP was &quot;easily [the Kinks&#x27;] best&quot;. In another positive assessment, &quot;Disc and Music Echo&quot; reviewer stated that Ray &quot;managed to bypass everything psychedelic and electronic&quot; by continuing to focus on &quot;simple, even rustic melodies with words of wisdom&quot;. The reviewer concluded that though the Kinks were no longer widely popular, &quot;Village Green&quot; indicated that Ray would likely continue to be one of Britain&#x27;s best composers. The reviewer for &quot;Top Pops&quot; commented that the album&#x27;s themes and styles varied greatly with considerable thought put into its lyrics and production. He concluded that the LP provided good value-for-money and expected he would listen to it consistently. In Simons&#x27;s &quot;Daily Express&quot; review, she characterised the album as Ray&#x27;s &quot;song picture&quot; representing &quot;the gentler aspects of British life&quot;. She further suggested that its material could work well as a stage musical.

In his September1968 preview of the twelve-track edition for &quot;NME&quot;, Altham reviewed the album favourably. He was especially fond of the title track, which he thought could have made it to in the UK had it been issued as a single. Having already published Altham&#x27;s review of the original album, &quot;NME&quot; did not publish a review of the expanded edition in November. Altham reflected decades later that while he liked the album on first listening and thought it was musically and aesthetically interesting, he worried at the time that it was a risky release for the Kinks since it was &quot;a bit too twee&quot;. He elaborated that compared to the band&#x27;s earlier work, it was &quot;missing [something] in terms of dynamics... it didn&#x27;t seem to have that anger, the kind of attack that Dave used to bring&quot;.

=== United States ===

&quot;Village Green&quot; was especially well received by US critics. The album was not covered in major US trade magazines like &quot;Billboard&quot; or &quot;Cash Box&quot; but received extensive coverage from non-mainstream sources. America&#x27;s new underground rock press began embracing the Kinks after the January1968 release of &quot;Something Else&quot;, a trend which continued following the release of &quot;Village Green&quot;.

Reviews of &quot;Village Green&quot; were slow to appear after its February1969 release; the only immediate response was a short piece in the 27 February issue of New York City&#x27;s &quot;Village Voice&quot;, in which Johanna Schier provided a mixed assessment. Schier described it as &quot;a good album, not a great one&quot;, hampered by its attempts to extend in too many directions. She concluded that the album&#x27;s best moments were when it approached the &quot;[m]usical violence&quot; which characterised the Kinks&#x27; earliest singles, though she still found the new music too subdued by comparison. In the 10 April issue of the &quot;Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau countered Schier&#x27;s review in his regular &quot;Rock&amp;Roll&amp;&quot; column. He instead concluded that the album was the best of the year so far. While Schier suggested that the band should have continued recording tracks with the raunch of &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;, Christgau countered that the band necessarily progressed beyond their original sound, just as the Beatles never returned to recording songs like their earliest singles. He declared &quot;Last of the Steam-Powered Trains&quot; the album&#x27;s most memorable song, placing it in the context of the rock and roll revival, and expected it would have been the lead single had there been enough demand.

A review of the album by Paul Williams, the former editor of &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; magazine, served as the lead review in the 14 June 1969 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine. In addition to praising the album, Williams described Ray as a genius who &quot;makes statements&quot; and &quot;says the sort of stuff that makes you delighted just to know that someone would say stuff like that&quot;. Comparing the Kinks to French composer Erik Satie, Williams concluded that &quot;only genius could hit me so directly, destroy me and rebuild so completely&quot;. Williams&#x27;s review subsequently became the most influential piece ever written about the Kinks, helping establish a cult following for the band.

A review in &quot;Circus&quot;, formerly the teen magazine &quot;Hullaballoo&quot;, stated that though the Kinks were &quot;backdated&quot; and &quot;cut off from the mainstream of pop progression&quot;, &quot;Village Green&quot; indicated their continued originality. A reviewer in Boston&#x27;s new underground paper &quot;Fusion&quot; similarly wrote that despite the increasingly bad press the band were facing, &quot;Village Green&quot; showed their persistence. The album was also reviewed in university newspapers. Musician John Mendelsohn reviewed it for UCLA&#x27;s paper the &quot;Daily Bruin&quot;, counting it as his favourite LP since the Who&#x27;s 1967 album &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; and predicted that it would be one of the best in 1969. The reviewer in Caltech&#x27;s paper instead disparaged the album as &quot;schmaltz rock&quot;, being &quot;without imagination, poorly arranged, and a bad copy of the Beatles&quot;.
== Retrospective assessment ==
Retrospective commentators often regard &quot;Village Green&quot; as the Kinks&#x27; best work. Critic Rob Sheffield writes the album is likely the band&#x27;s strongest album on a song-by-song basis, while Rogan writes it is &quot;[t]he crowning achievement of the Kinks&#x27; career and their best album by some distance&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic writes that the album&#x27;s subdued performances emphasise the songwriting to make it feel more like Ray&#x27;s solo project than a Kinks album. He suggests that, despite the album&#x27;s calm sensibility, it includes &quot;endless layers of musical and lyrical innovation&quot;.

&quot;Village Green&quot; has often be reassessed by commentators as Ray&#x27;s creative peak. Dylan Montanari of the website &quot;Spectrum Culture&quot; writes that the album places Ray&#x27;s songwriting ability among the best of 1960s, such as the Beatles, Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell. He contends that Ray&#x27;s unique skill is in understanding the nostalgia one will later feel about the present moment and a recognition that individuals often craft themselves on how they want to look to their future selves. Charles Ubaghs of webzine &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; writes the album is &quot;[a] piece of near perfect pop perfection repeatedly imitated and arguably never bettered&quot;. He argues that its lyrical content is furthered by the arrangements which mix folk with music hall, elevating it from &quot;odd ball piece of rose tinted British nostalgia, to a rightfully regarded piece of song writing brilliance&quot;.

Listeners in the 21st century often interpret &quot;Village Green&quot; as applying to modern issues. Relevant themes include disparaging the increasing modernisation of cities and destruction of &quot;little shops&quot;, satirising those who photograph mundane moments, exploring the emptiness of celebrity culture and being suggestive of environmentalism. Jeff Slate of &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine writes that while some late 1960s records have come to sound dated, &quot;Village Green&quot; has remained modern sounding and accessible decades after its release, something he attributes to its simple and straightforward arrangements. Adding to its success, he writes, was the band&#x27;s collaborative nature during its recording and their retention of some of their original garage rock sound. Michael Gallucci of the website &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; similarly writes that &quot;Village Green&quot; has maintained relevance decades after its release by sounding &quot;both timeless and of its time&quot;, its pastoral sounds partly originating from the Summer of Love while its exploration of music hall and Victorian mores being part of a broader yearning for the English tradition. Morgan Enos of &quot;Billboard&quot; writes that rather than being bitter or anachronistic, the album&#x27;s tracks &quot;burst with unique, giddy joy&quot;, only becoming more relevant in the &quot;more crowded, convoluted and bleak&quot; 21st century.

Though the term did not exist at the time of &quot;Village Green&quot; release, retrospective commentators identify the album as a candidate for the first concept album. The 2001 edition of &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot; calls it &quot;one of the few aesthetically successful concept albums&quot;, and Ann Powers of &quot;Blender&quot; magazine suggests the album achieves the difficult task of being &quot;a subtle concept album&quot;, its focus being everyday Britons. Author Nick Hasted compares the album&#x27;s cohesiveness to the consistent melancholy which runs through Sinatra&#x27;s 1958 album &quot;Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely&quot;, while John Mendelsohn writes it is more unified by the sound of its music than in its lyrical themes. Ray later suggested the album &quot;[is] not a storyline, it&#x27;s an emotional thread&quot;, a sentiment echoed by several commentators. Erlewine writes that while &quot;Something Else&quot; first displayed Ray&#x27;s penchant for nostalgia, &quot;Village Green&quot; instead served as his &quot;manifesto&quot; on the disappearance of old English traditions, both real and imagined. Author Clinton Heylin writes the twelve-track edition of the album displayed more unity, while the songs added in October1968 – in particular, &quot;Last of the Steam-Powered Trains&quot;, &quot;Big Sky&quot; and &quot;All of My Friends Were There&quot; – helped to &quot;kill the album conceptually&quot;. Enos, by contrast, writes the album&#x27;s format of separate vignettes allows for each to be enjoyed either separately or together.

== Influence and legacy ==

In the decades after its release, &quot;Village Green&quot; developed a cult following. The album&#x27;s themes appealed to English songwriters, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes its &quot;defiantly British sensibilities became the foundation of generations of British guitar pop&quot;. Among the album&#x27;s earliest English supporters was Pete Townshend of the Who, who later described it as Ray&#x27;s &quot;masterwork&quot; and &quot;his &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;&quot;. The album&#x27;s themes resonated with British bands in the mid-1970s who rose to prominence during the new wave movement, like the Jam, XTC, Squeeze and Madness. In the 1990s, as Britpop groups sought to emphasise their Englishness through their music, &quot;Village Green&quot; inspired bands like Blur, Oasis and Pulp. Noel Gallagher of Oasis and Blur&#x27;s guitarist Graham Coxon each named the album as one of their favourites. It has been a major influence on Blur&#x27;s principal songwriter Damon Albarn, who expressed similar sentiments of nostalgia for a past England on Blur&#x27;s albums &quot;Modern Life is Rubbish&quot; (1993) and &quot;Parklife&quot; (1994).

Driven in part by its influence on other artists, &quot;Village Green&quot; experienced a broader critical and commercial resurgence in the 1990s. The Kinks&#x27; emerging status in the 1990s as figures of the 1960s was propelled by the newfound popularity of &quot;Village Green&quot;. In America, the album attracted the attention of indie rock bands and Anglophiles, who covered its songs extensively in the late1980s and 1990s. Other artists incorporated its elements into their own work.

Along with the rest of the Kinks&#x27; catalogue, the album was first remastered on CD in 1998. In contrast to the band&#x27;s other 1998 reissues, &quot;Village Green&quot; included no bonus material but instead consisted of the mono version of the fifteen-track edition, the twelve-track edition in stereo and the mono single version of &quot;Days&quot;. Sanctuary Records reissued the album in 2004 as an expanded 3-CD box set, joining stereo and mono versions of the album and compiling many of the sessions&#x27; songs as bonus tracks. To coincide with the album&#x27;s 50th anniversary, Sony BMG and Legacy issued a &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; edition on 26 October 2018. The reissue received critical acclaim, though several reviewers remarked that most of the interesting bonus material had already been included on previous reissues. The 2018 release resulted in the album&#x27;s first appearance on the UK Albums Chart, where it charted for one week at . It also charted in Belgium, Spain and Germany. The album has since become the Kinks&#x27; best-selling studio album in the UK. The British Phonographic Industry certified the album silver in 2008 followed by gold in 2018 (indicating 60,000 and 100,000 sales, respectively).

Ian MacDonald writes that in contrast to the &quot;Englishness&quot; of the Kinks&#x27; late 1960s work, the band&#x27;s sound after their US performance ban was lifted shifted almost immediately back to being influenced by American acts, something he thinks was apparent on their next album, &quot;Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)&quot;.

=== Rankings ===

&quot;Village Green&quot; appears on professional rankings of the best albums. The album was voted in the first edition of English writer Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (1994). It placed and in Larkin&#x27;s updated second and third editions, published in 1998 and 2000, respectively. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at in the magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. When the list was updated in 2012 and 2020, it was placed at and , respectively. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; also ranked it on its &quot;50 Greatest Concept Albums of All Time&quot; list in 2022. In &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and &quot;Paste&quot; lists of the best albums of the 1960s, they placed &quot;Village Green&quot; at and , respectively.

<text>Stuyvesant Street is one of the oldest streets in the New York City borough of Manhattan. It runs diagonally from 9th Street at Third Avenue to 10th Street near Second Avenue, all within the East Village, Manhattan, neighborhood. The majority of the street is included in the St. Mark&#x27;s Historic District.

Although the street runs diagonally in relation to the Manhattan street grid, geographically it is one of the few true east–west streets in Manhattan, since most of the grid runs southwest–northeast at a 28.9 degree offset. It is a one-way street, running eastbound.

==History and description==
Stuyvesant Street originally ran east through Petrus Stuyvesant&#x27;s farm or &quot;bowery&quot; from Bowery Road, which today is Fourth Avenue, to the Stuyvesant manor house. The manor house burned down in October 1778 and the family sold the remaining cemetery and chapel, which today is the site of St. Mark&#x27;s Church in-the-Bowery.

For much of the 18th and 19th centuries, Stuyvesant Street remained an important thoroughfare and market street, but today it is a quaint street with single family homes and apartment buildings, and is often used for movie shoots of &quot;Old New York&quot;. All of the north side of Stuyvesant Street, from #21 to #37, and the south side from #42 to 46, are part of the St. Mark&#x27;s Historic District created in 1969 by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission to protect the area around St. Mark&#x27;s Church. In addition, the Hamilton Fish House at 21 Stuyvesant Street, also known as the Stuyvesant Fish House, is a New York City landmark owned by Cooper Union and occupied by its president.

The Commissioner&#x27;s Plan of 1811 called for strict use of a grid in Manhattan, but Stuyvesant Street was an exception in the plan. Into the 20th century, Stuyvesant Street ran east all the way through to Second Avenue, fronting St. Mark&#x27;s Church in-the-Bowery, but the portion of the street between 10th Street and Second Avenue, directly in front of the church, is now Abe Lebewohl Park. For street-pattern reasons this small plot of land had been turned into a sitting area in 1938 by the Works Progress Administration and called St. Mark’s Park, but by the 1970s it had become filthy and drug-ridden. Marilyn Appleberg, president of the 10th and Stuyvesant Streets Block Association, found that the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation was responsible for the upkeep of the property. In 1980 she, along with Beth Flusser and Abe Lebewohl, the owner of the nearby Second Avenue Deli, began a petition to save the park. On March 4, 1996, Lebewohl was shot and killed while handling a bank transaction at a neighborhood bank. That same year, the park underwent a long-awaited renovation by the Parks Department. Appleberg fought to have the name of the park changed to honor Lebewohl and she again won. In 2012, the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation gave Appleberg a Village Award in recognition of her many efforts in the neighborhood.

Another section of the original street between Third and Fourth Avenues became the location of a block-wide building, 45 Fourth Avenue, built in 1960 to be part of the Cooper Union campus. This section of the street was restored in 2011-2012 as a pedestrian plaza by the construction of 51 Astor Place and new park space implemented by the Department of Transportation.

East of Second Avenue, there are still several buildings whose footprints conform to the east–west path of Stuyvesant Street. Examples include 407 East 12th Street.

==In popular culture==
*In the film &quot;The Interpreter&quot; (2005), Nicole Kidman&#x27;s character lives at 10th Street and Stuyvesant, and the location is used heavily in the film.

<text>A wire stripper is a small, hand-held device used to strip the electrical insulation from electric wires.

== Types ==

=== Manual ===
A US-style simple manual crimping/wire stripper tool is a pair of opposing blades much like scissors or wire cutters. The addition of a center notch makes it easier to cut the insulation without cutting the wire. This type of wire stripper is used by rotating it around the insulation while applying pressure in order to make a cut around the insulation. Since the insulation is not bonded to the wire, it then pulls easily off the end. This type of wire stripper can be used on wires of any size. Another type of manual wire stripper is very similar to the simple design previously mentioned, except this type has several notches of varying size. This allows the user to match the notch size to the wire size, thereby eliminating the need for twisting, but can only be used on wire sizes that approximately match one of the notches. Once the device is clamped on, the remainder of the wire can simply be pulled out, leaving the insulation behind.

European-style wire strippers look more like a notched pincer, with a grab that is adjusted with a screw.

=== Compound automatic ===
The compound automatic wire stripper was first patented in 1915 by Stuart G. Wood of Brooklyn, NY. The design was refined by Herman Gerhard Jan Voogd of the Netherlands eliminating the awkward 4 bar mechanism taking on the general outline that it has kept since. Wood, now of Rockville IL, added reinforcements, replaceable blades, and blade stops in 1943 The 1943 design was also equipped to block the halves open after stripping to avoid crushing the freshly stripped wire as it returned to its rest position. A second actuation released the mechanism to return to the rest position. The action was further refined by Wood and finally, in 1959, by Eugene D. Hindenburg of DeKalb, IL. The 1959 refinement of the action shifted the sequence of operations so that the stripping blades opened before any other part of the mechanism began to return to the rest position while the clamping jaws retraced the sequence of operation, remaining closed until the handles were fully released.

When engaged, a compound automatic wire stripper first simultaneously grips the wire in one side and in the other side closes its shaped blades cutting the insulation around the conductor. After the sides have completed their strokes the two sides of the mechanism spread apart to push the cut tube of insulation from the end of the conductor. To use it, one simply places the wire in the jaws at the cutting slot matching the size of the conductor and squeezes the handles together. This device allows even a novice to strip most wires very quickly. The compound automatic wire stripper&#x27;s cutter must be short, because it causes the jaws to twist, as described by Wood in the 1943 patent. All wire strippers are inherently limited to those wire sizes the cutting jaw notches will accommodate. A compound automatic wire stripper&#x27;s short cutter limits it to fewer notches and a smaller range of wire sizes than most other types of wire strippers. The accuracy of the cutting blade opening determines the smallest conductor that can be reliably stripped. If the cutter opening is too small it will impinge on the conductor causing excess friction and more tension than the wire can withstand. If the cutter opening is too large the tension required to tear the remaining annulus of uncut insulation may be greater than the wire can withstand. Some models have an adjustable grip tension, to adjust the clamping force of the gripping jaw. The knob below the jaw on the yellow automatic strippers in the image below is a grip tension adjustment. Although in principle applicable to wire of any size, compound automatic wire strippers that are widely available have cutters that can accommodate conductors in a range of sizes no larger than 8 AWG nor smaller than 26 AWG, but not the entire range.

=== Laser wire stripper ===
A laser wire stripper is a computer-controlled machine, much like a CNC router, which uses a laser to burn off the insulation of the wire. Laser wire stripping machines are used mostly for very fine gauge wires since they do not damage the conductor. A typical CO2 laser wire stripping machine should be capable of stripping the insulation from any size wire.

<text>Reginald Roy Rattey, VC (28 March 1918 – 10 January 1986) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British or Commonwealth armed forces. He was one of 20 Australians to receive the award for their actions during the Second World War, doing so while serving with the 25th Battalion during the Bougainville Campaign in 1945. After the war, Rattey ran a farm near West Wyalong, New South Wales. He died in 1986 at the age of 67.

==Early life==
Born on 28 March 1918, at Barmedman, in New South Wales, Reg Rattey was one of seven children born to a Lutheran family living in rural New South Wales. His father, Johannes Albert Rattey, who was originally from Springton, South Australia had married his mother, Anna Elisabeth (née Damschke), at Pleasant Hills on 26 February 1914. Reginald was the couple&#x27;s third child and when he was born, his father was working a share farm. Three years later he purchased his own property near Wargin, and after he bought another property called &quot;Bon Accord&quot;, he expanded the family&#x27;s holdings to .

In his formative years, Reg was schooled at Bellarwi, travelling by horse each way, and was a keen sportsman playing cricket, football and tennis. After leaving school, he helped out on the family farm, and found work as a miner; he also joined the Militia, serving as a part-time soldier in the 21st Light Horse Regiment. When the war broke out, he was working at the Gibsonvale Open Cut Tin Mine at Kikoira and was parading with the 21st Light Horse Regiment at Wagga Wagga.

==Second World War==
In late September 1941, as the prospect of war in the Pacific against the Japanese grew, Rattey&#x27;s regiment was mobilised for full-time service. The 21st Light Horse was subsequently redesignated as the 21st Reconnaissance Battalion, and Rattey served as a Bren carrier driver and then a driver-mechanic. As a member of the Militia, under the provisions of the &quot;Defence Act&quot;, Rattey was not allowed to serve outside of Australian territory, but in July 1942 he volunteered for overseas service as part of the Australian Imperial Force. He was transferred to 3rd Division&#x27;s carrier company and then the 11th Division, and in September 1943 deployed to New Guinea, remaining there until April 1944 when he returned to Australia as a corporal. Two months later, he was transferred to an infantry battalion, the 25th Battalion, a Militia unit that had been raised in Queensland that was part of the 7th Brigade.

In July 1944, the 25th Battalion deployed to New Guinea where they were based around Madang until November when the battalion was transferred to Bougainville Island, landing at Torokina, where the Australians had taken over from the American force that had previously been fighting a campaign against the Japanese on the island. The Australians then began a three-pronged offensive in the northern, central and southern sectors of the island to clear the Japanese from the island. As part of this offensive, the 25th Battalion initially took part in the fighting in the central sector, and in late December fought in the Battle of Pearl Ridge before joining the southern drive on the Japanese stronghold of Buin in early 1945. By March they had crossed the Puriata River and begun moving inland towards a position that became known as &quot;Slater&#x27;s Knoll&quot;.

===Victoria Cross===
On 26 July 1945, Rattey was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions at Buin Road in South Bougainville on 22 March. The 25th Battalion were ordered to capture a Japanese stronghold following an allied air and artillery attack. After determining that an attack by his section would likely incur many casualties, he single-handedly attacked three Japanese weapons bunkers with his Bren gun. After eliminating one of the bunkers with a grenade, he returned to his section through enemy fire to obtain two more grenades and returned to destroy two more enemy bunkers.

Shortly after this, his section advanced and encountered further Japanese machine gun fire. Rattey again launched a solo attack on an enemy gun position, killing one, injuring another and causing the remaining gun crew to retreat. The section captured the Japanese machine gun with 2,000 ammunition rounds before advancing further. Two days after this action, Rattey was promoted to sergeant, and the following month his battalion was relieved shortly after holding off a large-scale Japanese attack during the Battle of Slater&#x27;s Knoll.

==Post war==
After returning to Australia, Rattey was briefly hospitalised with a bout of malaria and then briefly toured the country helping to raise money for the Australian Comfort Fund. He was discharged from the Army on 31 October 1945, and began farming a property around Lake Cowal, near West Wyalong, which he was granted under a special lease. In March 1946, he returned to the Army, being granted the rank of sergeant to attend the Victory Parade in London, where he was presented his Victoria Cross by King George VI at Buckingham Palace. He was discharged from the Army again in September 1946 and returning to Lake Cowal. In 1948, Rattey married Emily Café, with whom he had one daughter. Emily died in 1954 and the following year he remarried, exchanging nuptials with Aileen Delaney at St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church, in West Wyalong; the couple would later have four children.

Rattey expanded his property at Lake Cowal by an extra , and eventually worked the land with sheep, cattle, pigs and wheat. Later, he also farmed tiger snakes for their serum. In his later life, Rattey&#x27;s health deteriorated and he had to give up the land. He died on 10 January 1986 as a result of emphysema and was given a full military funeral at St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church, before being interred at the West Wyalong Lawn Cemetery. He was survived by his second wife and his five children.

==Honours and awards==

In addition to the Victoria Cross, Rattey also received the 1939–1945 Star, the Pacific Star, the War Medal 1939–1945, the Australia Service Medal 1939–1945, the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal and the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal. He is also commemorated by the following memorials:

* A plaque in the Strand, London, which was one of 12 unveiled during Victory in the Pacific Day celebrations on 29 August 1995;
*A memorial cairn in Lions Park, West Wyalong, which was unveiled on 13 November 1992;
* Reg Rattey Drive, which was opened in West Wyalong, in March 1999;
* A memorial park in Canberra (part of the national Remembrance Driveway); and
*A soldiers&#x27; club at Larrakeyah Barracks.

<text>Phosphorite, phosphate rock or rock phosphate is a non-detrital sedimentary rock that contains high amounts of phosphate minerals. The phosphate content of phosphorite (or grade of phosphate rock) varies greatly, from 4% to 20% phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5). Marketed phosphate rock is enriched (&quot;beneficiated&quot;) to at least 28%, often more than 30% P2O5. This occurs through washing, screening, de-liming, magnetic separation or flotation. By comparison, the average phosphorus content of sedimentary rocks is less than 0.2%. 

The phosphate is present as fluorapatite Ca5(PO4)3F typically in cryptocrystalline masses (grain sizes &lt; 1 μm) referred to as collophane-sedimentary apatite deposits of uncertain origin. It is also present as hydroxyapatite Ca5(PO4)3OH or Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, which is often dissolved from vertebrate bones and teeth, whereas fluorapatite can originate from hydrothermal veins. Other sources also include chemically dissolved phosphate minerals from igneous and metamorphic rocks. Phosphorite deposits often occur in extensive layers, which cumulatively cover tens of thousands of square kilometres of the Earth&#x27;s crust.

Limestones and mudstones are common phosphate-bearing rocks. Phosphate-rich sedimentary rocks can occur in dark brown to black beds, ranging from centimeter-sized laminae to beds that are several meters thick. Although these thick beds can exist, they are rarely only composed of phosphatic sedimentary rocks. Phosphatic sedimentary rocks are commonly accompanied by or interbedded with shales, cherts, limestone, dolomites and sometimes sandstone. These layers contain the same textures and structures as fine-grained limestones and may represent diagenetic replacements of carbonate minerals by phosphates. They also can be composed of peloids, ooids, fossils, and clasts that are made up of apatite. There are some phosphorites that are very small and have no distinctive granular textures. This means that their textures are similar to that of collophane, or fine micrite-like texture. Phosphatic grains may be accompanied by organic matter, clay minerals, silt-sized detrital grains, and pyrite. Peloidal or pelletal phosphorites occur normally; whereas oolitic phosphorites are not common.

Phosphorites are known from Proterozoic banded iron formations in Australia, but are more common from Paleozoic and Cenozoic sediments. The Permian Phosphoria Formation of the western United States represents some 15 million years of sedimentation. It reaches a thickness of 420 metres and covers an area of 350,000 km2. Commercially mined phosphorites occur in France, Belgium, Spain, Morocco, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia and Algeria. In the United States phosphorites have been mined in Florida, Tennessee, Wyoming, Utah, Idaho and Kansas.

==Classification of phosphatic sedimentary rocks==

(1) &quot;Pristine:&quot; Phosphates that are in pristine conditions have not undergone bioturbation. In other words, the word pristine is used when phosphatic sediment, phosphatized stromatolites and phosphate hardgrounds have not been disturbed.

(2) &quot;Condensed:&quot; Phosphatic particles, laminae and beds are considered condensed when they have been concentrated. This is helped by the extracting and reworking processes of phosphatic particles or bioturbation.

(3) &quot;Allochthonous:&quot; Phosphatic particles that were moved by turbulent or gravity-driven flows and deposited by these flows.

==Phosphorus cycle, formation and accumulation==

The heaviest accumulation of phosphorus is mainly on the ocean floor. Phosphorus accumulation occurs from atmospheric precipitation, dust, glacial runoff, cosmic activity, underground hydrothermal volcanic activity, and deposition of organic material. The primary inflow of dissolved phosphorus is from continental weathering, brought out by rivers to the ocean. It is then processed by both micro- and macro-organisms. Diatomaceous plankton, phytoplankton, and zooplankton process and dissolve phosphorus in the water. The bones and teeth of certain fish (e.g. anchovies) absorb phosphorus and are later deposited and buried in the marine sediment.

Depending on the pH and salinity levels of the ocean water, organic matter will decay, releasing phosphorus from sediment in shallow basins. Bacteria and enzymes dissolve organic matter on the water–bottom interface, thus returning phosphorus to the beginning of its biogenic cycle. Mineralization of organic matter can also cause the release of phosphorus back into the ocean water.

==Depositional environments==

Phosphates are known to be deposited in a wide range of depositional environments. Normally phosphates are deposited in very shallow, near-shore marine or low energy environments. This includes environments such as supratidal zones, littoral or intertidal zones, and most importantly estuarine. Currently, areas of oceanic upwelling cause the formation of phosphates. This is because of the constant stream of phosphate brought from the large, deep ocean reservoir (see below). This cycle allows continuous growth of organisms.

&quot;Supratidal zones:&quot; Supratidal environments are part of the tidal flat system where the presence of strong wave activity is non-existent. Tidal flat systems are created along open coasts and relatively low wave energy environments. They can also develop on high energy coasts behind barrier islands where they are sheltered from the high energy wave action. Within the tidal flat system, the supratidal zone lies in a very high tide level. However, it can be flooded by extreme tides and cut across by tidal channels. This is also subaerially exposed, but is flooded twice a month by spring tides.

&quot;Littoral environments/intertidal zones:&quot; Intertidal zones are also part of the tidal flat system. The intertidal zone is located within the mean high and low tide levels. It is subject to tidal shifts, which means that it is subaerially exposed once or twice a day. It is not exposed long enough to support the growth of most vegetation. The zone contains both suspension sedimentation and bed load.

&quot;Estuarine environments&quot;: Estuarine environments, or estuaries, are located at the lower parts of rivers that flow into the open sea. Since they are in the seaward section of the drowned valley system they receive sediment from both marine and fluvial sources. These contain facies that are affected by tide and wave fluvial processes. An estuary is considered to stretch from the landward limit of tidal facies to the seaward limit of coastal facies. Phosphorites are often deposited in fjords within estuarine environments. These are estuaries with shallow sill constrictions. During Holocene sea-level rise, fjord estuaries formed by drowning of glacially-eroded U-shaped valleys.

The most common occurrence of phosphorites is related to strong marine upwelling of sediments. Upwelling is caused by deep water currents that are brought up to coastal surfaces where a large deposition of phosphorites may occur. This type of environment is the main reason why phosphorites are commonly associated with silica and chert. Estuaries are also known as a phosphorus “trap”. This is because coastal estuaries contain a high productivity of phosphorus from marsh grass and benthic algae which allow an equilibrium exchange between living and dead organisms.

===Types of phosphorite deposition===

*Phosphate nodules: These are spherical concentrations that are randomly distributed along the floor of continental shelves. Most phosphorite grains are sand size although particles greater than 2 mm may be present. These larger grains, referred to as nodules, can range up to several tens of centimeters in size. Phosphate nodules are known to occur in significant quantities offshore northern Chile. 

*Bioclastic phosphates or bone beds: Bone beds are bedded phosphate deposits that contain concentrations of small skeletal particles and coprolites. Some also contain invertebrate fossils like brachiopods and become more enriched in P2O5 after diagenetic processes have occurred. Bioclastic phosphates can also be cemented by phosphate minerals. 
*Phosphatization: Phosphatization is a type of rare diagenetic processes. It occurs when fluids that are rich in phosphate are leached from guano. These are then concentrated and reprecipitated in limestone. Phosphatized fossils or fragments of original phosphatic shells are important components within some these deposits.

====Tectonic and oceanographic settings of marine phosphorites====

*Epeiric sea phosphorites: Epeiric sea phosphorites are within marine shelf environments. These are in a broad and shallow cratonic setting. This is where granular phosphorites, phosphorite hardgrounds, and nodules occur.
*Continental margin phosphorites: Convergent, passive, upwelling, non-upwelling. This environment accumulates phosphorites in the form of hardgrounds, nodules and granular beds. These accumulate by carbonate fluorapatite precipitation during early diagenesis in the upper few tens of centimeters of sediment. There are two different environmental conditions in which phosphorites are produced within continental margins. Continental margins can consist of organic rich sedimentation, strong coastal upwelling, and pronounced low oxygen zones. They can also form in conditions such as oxygen rich bottom waters and organic poor sediments.
*Seamount phosphorites: These are phosphorites that occur in seamounts, guyots, or flat topped seamounts, seamount ridges. These phosphorites are produced in association with iron and magnesium bearing crusts. In this setting the productivity of phosphorus is recycled within an iron oxidation reduction phosphorus cycle. This cycle can also form glauconite which is normally associated with modern and ancient phosphorites.
*Insular phosphorites: Insular phosphorites are located in carbonate islands, plateaus, coral island consisting of a reef surrounding a lagoon or, atoll lagoon, marine lakes. The phosphorite here originates from guano. Replacement of deep sea sediments precipitates, that has been formed in place on the ocean floor.

==Production and use==

===Production===
Deposits which contain phosphate in quantity and concentration which are economic to mine as ore for their phosphate content are not particularly common. The two main sources for phosphate are guano, formed from bird or bat droppings, and rocks containing concentrations of the calcium phosphate mineral, apatite.

, the US is the world&#x27;s leading producer and exporter of phosphate fertilizers, accounting for about 37% of world P2O5 exports. , the world&#x27;s total economic demonstrated resource of rock phosphate is 70 gigatonnes, which occurs principally as sedimentary marine phosphorites.

, China, the United States and Morocco are the world&#x27;s largest miners of phosphate rock, with a production of 77 megatonnes, 29.4 Mt and 26.8 Mt (including 2.5 Mt in the Sahara of Morocco) respectively in 2012 while global production reached 195 Mt. It is thought that in India there are almost 260 million tons of rock phosphate. Other countries with significant production include Brazil, Russia, Jordan and Tunisia. Historically, large amounts of phosphates were obtained from deposits on small islands such as Christmas Island and Nauru, but these sources are now largely depleted.

Phosphate ore is mined and beneficiated into rock phosphate. Beneficiation of phosphate ore is a process which includes washing, flotation and calcining. Froth flotation is used to concentrate the mined ore to rock phosphate. The mined ore is crushed and washed, creating a slurry, this ore slurry is then treated with fatty acids to cause calcium phosphate to become hydrophobic.

This rock phosphate is then either solubilized to produce wet-process phosphoric acid, or smelted to produce elemental phosphorus. Phosphoric acid is reacted with phosphate rock to produce the fertilizer triple superphosphate or with anhydrous ammonia to produce the ammonium phosphate fertilizers. Elemental phosphorus is the base for furnace-grade phosphoric acid, phosphorus pentasulfide, phosphorus pentoxide, and phosphorus trichloride.

===Uses===
Approximately 90% of rock phosphate production is used for fertilizer and animal feed supplements and the balance for industrial chemicals. In addition, phosphorus from rock phosphate is also used in food preservatives, baking flour, pharmaceuticals, anticorrosion agents, cosmetics, fungicides, insecticides, detergents, ceramics, water treatment and metallurgy.

For use in the chemical fertilizer industry, beneficiated rock phosphate must be concentrated to levels of at least 28% phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), although most marketed grades of phosphate rock are 30% or more.

It must also have reasonable amounts of calcium carbonate (5%), and &lt;4% combined iron and aluminium oxides. Worldwide, the resources of high-grade ore are declining, and use of lower grade ore may become more attractive.

Beneficiated rock phosphate is also marketed and accepted as an &quot;organic&quot; alternative to &quot;chemical&quot; phosphate fertilizer which has been further concentrated from it, because it is perceived as being more &quot;natural&quot;. According to a report for the FAO, it can be more sustainable to apply rock phosphate as a fertilizer in certain soil types and countries, although it has many drawbacks. According to the report it may have higher sustainability compared to more concentrated fertilizers because of reduced manufacturing costs and the possibility of local procurement of the refined ore.

Rare earth elements are being found within phosphorites. With increasing demand from modern technology a different method of finding rare earth elements, independent of China, is becoming increasingly important. With yields greater than those from deposits in China, phosphorites offer a new resource located within the U.S. that would likely lead to independence from influence of countries outside of the U.S.

<text>Sextus Calpurnius Agricola was a Roman senator and general active during the 2nd century. He was &quot;consul suffectus&quot; with Tiberius Claudius Julianus for the &quot;nundinium&quot; of September-October 154. Agricola is known primarily from inscriptions.

== Life ==
No information has yet been found about Calpurnius Agricola prior to his consulate. His origin is attested in no surviving document, and the &quot;gentilicium&quot; &quot;Calpurnius&quot; is commonly found all over the Empire. However, Anthony Birley notes the combination &quot;Sextus Calpurnius&quot; is very uncommon, and he suggests that Agricola is related to Fronto&#x27;s friend Sextus Calpurnius Julianus; if so, he may have been a native of Cirta or another town in Numidia.

Calpurnius Agricola was governor of Germania Superior around 158.

In 161 or 162 he was made governor of Britain and remained until at least 163, possibly until the end of the 160s.

In 163, he was sent to Britain to control uprisings in the north. He rebuilt a number of forts, most notably that at Coria (Corbridge). He withdrew troops southwards from Scotland towards the line of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall to contend with the threats of further rebellion.

There are indications of unrest in Britain around the time of his rule attested by damage to the forum at Viroconium Cornoviorum (Wroxeter) and the burning of a large part of Verulamium (St Albans).

Around 166 AD Agricola was appointed imperial legate in Roman Dacia. Between 168 and 169, he was one of the governors of Lower Moesia.

<doc id="1227091" wikidata="Q6780743" url="?curid=1227091" title="Mary Slessor">
<text>Mary Mitchell Slessor (2 December 1848 – 13 January 1915) was a Scottish Presbyterian missionary to Nigeria. Once in Nigeria, Slessor learned Efik, one of the numerous local languages, then began teaching. Because of her understanding of the native language and her bold personality Slessor gained the trust and acceptance of the locals and was able to spread Christianity while promoting women&#x27;s rights and protecting native children. She is most famous for her role in helping to stop the common practice of infanticide of twins in Okoyong, an area of Cross River State, Nigeria.

==Early life==
Mary Mitchell Slessor was born on 2, December 1848 in Gilcomston, Aberdeen, Scotland, to a poor working-class family who could not afford proper education. She was the second of seven children of Robert and Mary Slessor. Her father, originally from Buchan, was a shoemaker by trade. Her mother was born in Oldmeldrum, Aberdeenshire, and was a deeply religious woman. In 1859, the family moved to Dundee in search of work. Robert Slessor was an alcoholic and, unable to keep up shoemaking, took a job as a labourer in a mill. Her mother was a skilled weaver and went to work in the mills. At the age of eleven, Mary began work as a &quot;half-timer&quot; in the Baxter Brothers&#x27; Mill, meaning she spent half of her day at a school provided by the mill owners and the other half working for the company.

The Slessors lived in the slums of Dundee. Mary Slessor&#x27;s father and both brothers died of pneumonia, leaving behind only Mary, her mother, and two sisters. By age fourteen, Mary had become a skilled jute worker at the mill, working from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. with just an hour for breakfast and lunch.

Her mother was a devout Presbyterian who read each issue of the &quot;Missionary Record&quot;, a monthly magazine published by the United Presbyterian Church (later the United Free Church of Scotland) to inform members of missionary activities and needs. Slessor developed an interest in religion, and when a mission was instituted in Quarry Pend (close by the Wishart Church), she wanted to teach. Slessor started her mission at the age of 27, upon hearing that David Livingstone, the famous missionary and explorer, had died. She decided then that she wanted to follow in his footsteps.

==Missionary Work==
Eventually, Slessor applied to the Foreign Mission Board of the United Presbyterian Church. After training in Edinburgh, she set sail in the SS &quot;Ethiopia&quot; on 5 August 1876 with her cousin Robert Mitchell Beedie, a missionary from New Deer in Buchan and arrived at her destination in West Africa just over a month later.

Slessor, 28 years of age, was first assigned to the Calabar region in the land of the Efik people. She was warned that they believed in traditional West African religion and had superstitions about women giving birth to twins. Slessor lived in the missionary compound for three years, working first in the missions in Old Town and Creek Town. She wanted to go deeper into Calabar, but contracted malaria and was forced to return to Scotland to recover, leaving Calabar for Dundee in 1879. After 16 months in Scotland, Slessor returned to Calabar, this time to a new assignment three miles farther into Calabar, in Old Town. Since Slessor assigned a large portion of her salary to support her mother and sisters in Scotland, she economised by eating the native food.
Issues Slessor confronted as a young missionary included the lack of Western education, as well as widespread human sacrifice at the death of a village elder, who, it was believed, required servants and retainers to accompany him into the next world.

According to biographer W. P. Livingstone, when two deputies went out to inspect the Mission in 1881–82, they were much impressed. They stated, &quot;… she enjoys the unreserved friendship and confidence of the people and has much influence over them&quot;. This they attributed partly to the singular ease with which Slessor spoke the language.

After only three more years, Slessor returned to Scotland on yet another health furlough. During the next three years, Slessor looked after her mother and sister (who had also fallen ill), and spoke at many churches, sharing stories from the Calabar area.
Slessor then returned to an area farther away from central Calabar, from the areas which had already eliminated the more &quot;heathen&quot; practices. She saved hundreds of twins out of the bush, where they had been left either to starve to death or to be eaten by animals. She helped heal the sick and stop the practice of determining guilt by making the suspects drink poison. As a missionary, she went to other tribes, spreading the word of Jesus Christ.

During this third mission to Calabar, Slessor received news that her mother and sister had died. She was overcome with loneliness, writing, &quot;There is no one to write and tell my stories and nonsense to.&quot; She had also found a sense of independence, writing, &quot;Heaven is now nearer to me than Britain, and no one will worry about me if I go up country.&quot;

Slessor was a driving force behind the establishment of the Hope Waddell Training Institute in Calabar, which provided practical vocational training to Efiks. The superstitious threat against twins was not only in Calabar; but also spread to a town called Arochukwu on the far west of Calabar. The people of Calabar belong to the Efik tribe though the popular Arochukwu town is in the Igbo tribe&#x27;s region. Both Calabar and Arochukwu share some common cultures and are in southeastern Nigeria, precisely Cross River State and Abia State respectively.

==Among the Okoyong and Efik==
In August 1888, Slessor travelled north to Okoyong, an area where male missionaries had been killed. She thought her teachings, and the fact she was a woman, would be less threatening to unreached tribes. For 15 years, Slessor lived with the Okoyong and the Efik people. She learned to speak the native Efik language, and made close personal friendships wherever she went, becoming known for her pragmatism and humour. Slessor lived a simple life in a traditional house with Efiks. Her insistence on lone stations often led her into conflict with the authorities and gained her a reputation for eccentricity. However, her exploits were heralded in Britain, and she became known as the &quot;white queen of Okoyong&quot;. Slessor continued her focus on evangelism, settling disputes, encouraging trade, establishing social changes and introducing Western education.

It was the belief in the area that the birth of twins was considered a particularly evil curse. Natives feared that the father of one of the infants was a &#x27;devil child&#x27;, and that the mother had been guilty of a great sin. Unable to determine which twin was fathered by the evil spirit, the natives often abandoned both babies in clay pots to die. In most of Calabar the practice had been eliminated by the Missionaries and King Eyo Honesty II. Slessor left the area of Calabar and moved further in to Okoyong. She adopted every child she found abandoned, and sent out twins&#x27; missioners to find, protect and care for them at the Mission House. Some mission compounds were alive with babies. Slessor once saved a pair of twins, a boy and a girl, but the boy did not survive. Mary took the girl as her daughter and called her Janie. She took Janie home to Scotland with her on at least one visit.

In 1892, Slessor became vice-consul in Okoyong, presiding over the native court. In 1905 she was named vice-president of Ikot Obong native court. In 1913, she was awarded the Order of St John. Slessor&#x27;s health began to suffer in her later years, but she remained in Calabar, where she died in 1915.

==Death==
For the last four decades of her life, Slessor suffered intermittent fevers from the malaria she contracted during her first station to Calabar. However, she downplayed the personal costs, and never gave up her mission work to return permanently to Scotland. The fevers eventually weakened Slessor to the point she could no longer walk long distances in the rainforest but had to be pushed along in a handcart. In early January 1915, while at her remote station near Use Ikot Oku, she suffered a particularly severe fever. Slessor died on 13 January 1915.

Her body was transported down the Cross River to Duke Town for the colonial equivalent of a state funeral. A Union Jack covered her coffin. Attendees included the provincial commissioner, along with other senior British officials in full uniform. Flags at government buildings were flown at half-mast. Nigeria&#x27;s Governor-General, Sir Frederick Lugard, telegraphed his &quot;deepest regrets&quot; from Lagos and published a warm eulogy in the government gazette.

A report on her death in &quot;The Southern Reporter&quot; of 21 January 1915 mentions a time she spent on furlough in Bowden, Roxburghshire, Scottish Borders. It states that &quot;She and her four adopted African children were a centre of great attraction and helped to deepen the interest of the whole community in the Foreign Mission work of the Church.&quot; It praises her strong force character, her unostentatious manner, and her zeal for the tribes around Calabar.

== Honours and legacy ==
Slessor&#x27;s work in Okoyong earned her the Efik nickname of &quot;Obongawan Okoyong&quot; (Queen of Okoyong). This name is still used commonly to refer to her in Calabar.

Several memorials in and around the Efik provinces of Calabar and Okoyong testify to the value placed on her work. Some of these include:
* a high school named in honour of Slessor in Arochukwu
* Mary Slessor Road in Calabar
* Mary Slessor Roundabout
* Mary Slessor Street in Coventry 
* Mary Slessor Church
* Statues of her (usually carrying twins) at various locations in Calabar

A female hostel in the University of Nigeria Nsukka is named Mary Slessor Hall in her honour.

A girls&#x27; house, &quot;Slessor House&quot;, was named after her in Achimota School, Ghana.

In Scotland, a bust of Slessor is now in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling. In Aberdeen a memorial used to stand in the city&#x27;s Union Terrace Gardens prior to their redevelopment in 2024. In Dundee, a new city centre park is named &#x27;Slessor Gardens&#x27; in her honour. There are also streets named after her in Glasgow, Dundee and Oldmeldrum in Scotland, and in Coventry in England.

Slessor was honoured on a 1997 bank note by Clydesdale Bank for the World Heritage Series and Famous Scots Series. She was featured on the back of the bank&#x27;s £10 note, highlighting her work in Calabar. The note also features a map of Calabar, a lithographic vignette depicting her work with children, and a sailing ship emblem.

Main-belt asteroid 4793 Slessor (1988 RR4) named to mark her centenary celebrations on 13 January 2015.

In 1950, the anthropologist Charles Partridge, a friend of Slessor when both were in Nigeria, donated letters from her, along with a recording of her voice, now The Slessor Collection at Dundee Central Library; he said of her: &quot;She was a very remarkable woman. I look back on her friendship with reverence- one of the greatest honours that have befallen me.&quot;

Mary Slessor is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 11 January.

<text>Single-source publishing, also known as single-sourcing publishing, is a content management method which allows the same source content to be used across different forms of media and more than one time. The labor-intensive and expensive work of editing need only be carried out once, on only one document; that source document (the single source of truth) can then be stored in one place and reused. This reduces the potential for error, as corrections are only made one time in the source document.

The benefits of single-source publishing primarily relate to the editor rather than the user. The user benefits from the consistency that single-sourcing brings to terminology and information. This assumes the content manager has applied an organized conceptualization to the underlying content (A poor conceptualization can make single-source publishing less useful). Single-source publishing is sometimes used synonymously with multi-channel publishing though whether or not the two terms are synonymous is a matter of discussion.

==Definition==
While there is a general definition of single-source publishing, there is no single official delineation between single-source publishing and multi-channel publishing, nor are there any official governing bodies to provide such a delineation. Single-source publishing is most often understood as the creation of one source document in an authoring tool and converting that document into different file formats or human languages (or both) multiple times with minimal effort. Multi-channel publishing can either be seen as synonymous with single-source publishing, or similar in that there is one source document but the process itself results in more than a mere reproduction of that source.

==History==
The origins of single-source publishing lie, indirectly, with the release of Windows 3.0 in 1990. With the eclipsing of MS-DOS by graphical user interfaces, help files went from being unreadable text along the bottom of the screen to hypertext systems such as WinHelp. On-screen help interfaces allowed software companies to cease the printing of large, expensive help manuals with their products, reducing costs for both producer and consumer. This system raised opportunities as well, and many developers fundamentally changed the way they thought about publishing. Writers of software documentation did not simply move from being writers of traditional bound books to writers of electronic publishing, but rather they became authors of central documents which could be reused multiple times across multiple formats.

The first single-source publishing project was started in 1993 by Cornelia Hofmann at Schneider Electric in Seligenstadt, using software based on Interleaf to automatically create paper documentation in multiple languages based on a single original source file.

XML, developed during the mid- to late-1990s, was also significant to the development of single-source publishing as a method. XML, a markup language, allows developers to separate their documentation into two layers: a shell-like layer based on presentation and a core-like layer based on the actual written content. This method allows developers to write the content only one time while switching it in and out of multiple different formats and delivery methods.

In the mid-1990s, several firms began creating and using single-source content for technical documentation (Boeing Helicopter, Sikorsky Aviation and Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada) and user manuals (Ford owners manuals) based on tagged SGML and XML content generated using the Arbortext Epic editor with add-on functions developed by a contractor. The concept behind this usage was that complex, hierarchical content that did not lend itself to discrete componentization could be used across a variety of requirements by tagging the differences within a single document using the capabilities built into SGML and XML.
Ford, for example, was able to tag its single owner&#x27;s manual files so that 12 model years could be generated via a resolution script running on the single completed file. Pratt &amp; Whitney, likewise, was able to tag up to 20 subsets of its jet engine manuals in single-source files, calling out the desired version at publication time. World Book Encyclopedia also used the concept to tag its articles for American and British versions of English.

Starting from the early 2000s, single-source publishing was used with an increasing frequency in the field of technical translation. It is still regarded as the most efficient method of publishing the same material in different languages. Once a printed manual was translated, for example, the online help for the software program which the manual accompanies could be automatically generated using the method. Metadata could be created for an entire manual and individual pages or files could then be translated from that metadata with only one step, removing the need to recreate information or even database structures.

Although single-source publishing is now decades old, its importance has increased urgently as of the 2010s. As consumption of information products rises and the number of target audiences expands, so does the work of developers and content creators. Within the industry of software and its documentation, there is a perception that the choice is to embrace single-source publishing or render one&#x27;s operations obsolete.

==Criticism==
Editors using single-source publishing have been criticized for below-standard work quality, leading some critics to describe single-source publishing as the &quot;conveyor belt assembly&quot; of content creation.

While heavily used in technical translation, there are risks of error in regard to indexing. While two words might be synonyms in English, they may not be synonyms in another language. In a document produced via single-sourcing, the index will be translated automatically and the two words will be rendered as synonyms. This is because they are synonyms in the source language, while in the target language they are not.

<doc id="1227096" wikidata="Q5625368" url="?curid=1227096" title="Wandering officer">
<text>In law enforcement in the United States, a wandering officer, referred to colloquially as a gypsy cop, is a police officer who frequently transfers between police departments, having a record of misconduct or unsuitable job performance. 

==History of the term==
In use since the 1980s, the phrase entered public parlance in the 2000s after the infamous Tulia drug stings, where itinerant lawman Tom Coleman allegedly set up innocent people, most of them black, as part of a long-term undercover operation. Several other high-profile cases in states include those in Texas and Alaska that involved officers who served with adversity in close to 20 agencies in 15 years or less, yet they continued to evade administrative action as they went from agency to agency, sometimes serving as little as 30 days at one department, despite blatant misconduct and compelling signs of unsuitability to serve as peace officers. More recently in 2016 following a civil rights lawsuit against Ferguson police officer Freddie Boyd, he was found to have had a string of complaints filed against him from over 10 years earlier, including pistol whipping a child and falsifying police reports, from when he worked for the city of St. Louis. Law enforcement agency heads privately refer to the practice of giving a problematic officer a good recommendation in order to get rid of the officer while avoiding litigation, as &quot;pass the trash&quot;.

The term comes from the Romani people popularly known as &quot;Gypsies&quot;, who are stereotypically said to always be travelling and thus never get to settle down in a local community, just like how a gypsy cop never gets to stay at any given police department for long. Some dictionaries recommend against using the word &quot;gypsy&quot; as a modifier with negative connotations, because such use could be considered a slur against the Romani people.

==Causes==
===Fragmentation===

The United States has a highly decentralized and fragmented system of law enforcement, with around 18,000 law enforcement agencies, and is regulated separately in the 50 states, plus US territories, the federal and local level as well. Hiring and disciplinary standards vary greatly between police departments, the majority of which are small in size. There is no national database of dismissed officers, who may or may not be de-certified to practice law enforcement by their jurisdictional regulatory agency, often called POST (Peace Officer Standards and Training) agencies, or by a similar agency. Some states have established a state-level database or taken other administrative measures to try to prevent dismissed officers from being rehired, but these databases are not centralized, nor do they have uniform prerequisites. The large population and land area of the country makes it further harder to notice these cases; an officer may have moved hundreds of miles away to join another agency and the new agency would be unlikely to have learned of the case in the media.

===Incentives for hiring===
Wandering officers usually move from agency to agency as lateral transfers, or law enforcement officers that have already been trained and certified. They are often preferred over new recruits as the hiring process is simplified. Some smaller agencies knowingly hire gypsy cops because they have difficulty in recruiting suitable officers. That may be because of a smaller population to recruit from, lower pay, limited training and growth potential, less exciting police activity and even less prestige. The vacancy of even one officer in a small agency of fewer than 10 officers can create substantial hardships on an agency that must provide 24-hour coverage to the community it serves. The agencies have a great incentive to fill the vacancy quickly, even if it means hiring someone unsuitable.

===Incentives for concealing a misconduct dismissal===

Problem officers are often allowed to resign in seemingly good standing and then go to another unsuspecting agency with a good recommendation from a previous chief or sheriff, who is eager to get rid of the problem officer. In other cases, small agencies with limited budgets may fear a costly lawsuit if they dismiss an officer through a formal disciplinary process. An officer who is facing a misconduct dismissal will often threaten the agency and its governmental entity with costly, lengthy, and unflattering litigation for wrongful discipline or wrongful unfit or adverse termination and make such claims public. An officer finally can often negotiate a positive departure from an agency once they realize that they can no longer continue to work there. They can leave with an apparent clean and positive record and the agency is simply relieved to be rid of the officer, who goes to another unsuspecting agency.

Attempts to report problem officers by agencies can be overruled and overturned by administrative law hearings and actions. Such a ruling can be interpreted as a rebuke of the agency and can be a basis for the officer to litigate against the reporting agency. Fear of this potential outcome is also a factor in many agency heads simply taking the path of least resistance and giving a separating officer a positive report of separation.

Most states have a consolidated retirement system for state, county and municipal peace officers, which is unaffected by transfers between agencies so long as continued employment occurs and can thus further provide incentive for both good and bad officers to move frequently between agencies.

<text>Clarence Birdseye (December 9, 1886 – October 7, 1956) was an American inventor, entrepreneur, and naturalist, considered the founder of the modern frozen food industry. He founded the frozen food company Birds Eye. Among his inventions during his career was the double belt freezer.

One of nine children, Birdseye grew up in New York City before heading to Amherst College and began his scientific career with the U.S. government. A biography of his life was published by Doubleday over a half century after his death.

== Early life and education ==
Clarence Birdseye was the sixth of nine children of Clarence Frank Birdseye, a lawyer in an insurance firm, and Ada Jane Underwood. His first years were spent in New York, New York, where his family owned a townhouse in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. From childhood, Birdseye was obsessed with natural science and with taxidermy, which he taught himself by correspondence. At the age of eleven he advertised his courses in the subject. When he was fourteen, the family moved to the suburb of Montclair, New Jersey, where Birdseye graduated from Montclair High School. He matriculated at Amherst College, where his father and elder brother had earned degrees. There he excelled at science, although an average student in other subjects. His obsession with collecting insects led his college classmates to nickname him &quot;Bugs&quot;.

In the summer after his freshman year, Birdseye worked for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) in New Mexico and Arizona as an “assistant naturalist”, at a time when the agency was concerned with helping farmers and ranchers get rid of predators, chiefly coyotes.

In 1908, family finances forced Birdseye to withdraw from college after his second year. In 1917, Birdseye&#x27;s father and elder brother Kellogg went to prison for defrauding their employer; whether this was related to Birdseye&#x27;s withdrawal from Amherst is unclear.

Birdseye was once again hired by the USDA, this time for a project surveying animals in the American West. He also worked with entomologist Willard Van Orsdel King (1888–1970) in Montana, where, in 1910 and 1911, he captured several hundred small mammals from which King removed several thousand ticks for research, isolating them as the cause of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a breakthrough.
Birdseye&#x27;s next field assignment, intermittently from 1912 to 1915, was in Labrador in the Dominion of Newfoundland (now part of Canada), where he became further interested in food preservation by freezing, especially fast freezing. He purchased land at Muddy Bay, where he built a ranch for raising foxes. He was taught by the Inuit how to ice fish under very thick ice. In -40 °C weather, the Inuit also demonstrated that freshly caught fish could be then instantly flash frozen when exposed to air, and when thawed, still tasted fresh. He recognized the potential that this traditional knowledge held if it were to be employed in production since the frozen seafood sold in New York was of lower quality than the frozen fish of Labrador. This 1920s hunting trip to Canada, where he witnessed the traditional methods of the indigenous Inuit people, directly inspired Birdseye&#x27;s food preserving method.

When food is frozen slowly, at temperatures near the freezing point, ice crystals form within the animal or vegetable cells; when the food thaws, cellular fluid leaks from the damaged tissue, giving the food a mushy or dry consistency. Rapid freezing, at lower temperatures, gives crystals less time to form and thus does less damage.

In 1922, Birdseye conducted fish-freezing experiments at the Clothel Refrigerating Company, and then established his own company, Birdseye Seafoods Inc., to freeze fish fillets with chilled air at −43 °C (−45 °F). In 1924, his company went bankrupt for lack of consumer interest in the product. That same year, he developed an entirely new process for commercially viable quick-freezing: packing fish in cartons, then freezing the contents between two refrigerated surfaces under pressure. Birdseye created General Seafood Corporation to promote this method.

==Industrial development==
In 1925, General Seafood Corporation moved to Gloucester, Massachusetts. There it marketed and sold Birdseye&#x27;s newest invention, the double belt freezer, in which cold brine chilled a pair of stainless steel belts carrying packaged fish, freezing the fish quickly. His invention was issued US Patent #1,773,079, considered by some as the beginning of today&#x27;s frozen foods industry. Birdseye patented other machinery which cooled even more quickly. In 1927, he patented the multiplate freezing machine which was used as the basis for freezing food for several decades.

In 1929, Birdseye sold his company and patents for $22 million (approximately $335 million in 2021 dollars) to Goldman Sachs and the Postum Company, which eventually became General Foods Corporation. General Foods founded the Birds Eye Frozen Food Company. Birdseye continued to work with the company, further developing frozen food technology. In 1930, the company began sales experiments in 18 retail stores around Springfield, Massachusetts, to test consumer acceptance of quick-frozen foods. The initial product line featured 26 items, including 18 cuts of frozen meat, spinach and peas, a variety of fruits and berries, blue point oysters, and fish fillets. Consumers liked the new products, and today this is considered the birth of retail frozen foods. The &quot;Birds Eye&quot; name remains a leading frozen-food brand. In 1949, Birdseye won the Institute of Food Technologists&#x27; Babcock-Hart Award. Birdseye was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2005.

==Death==
Birdseye died on October 7, 1956, of a heart attack at the Gramercy Park Hotel at the age of 69. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the sea off the coast of Gloucester, Massachusetts.

== Legacy ==
In 2012 a book-length biography of Birdseye, Mark Kurlansky&#x27;s &quot;Birdseye: The Adventures of a Curious Man&quot;, was published by Doubleday.

<text>VM Motori S.p.A. is an Italian diesel engine manufacturing company which is wholly owned by Stellantis. VM headquarters and main production facilities are located in Cento, in Emilia-Romagna, Italy.
== History ==
VM Motori was founded by two entrepreneurs, Claudio Vancini and Ugo Martelli (hence the &quot;VM&quot;) in 1947.

VM merged with &quot;Stabilimenti Meccanici Triestini&quot; in Trieste in 1971, then &quot;Finmeccanica&quot; took a majority stake in the combined company. The company was referred to as &quot;Finmeccanica VM&quot; for many years.

In 1989, Finmeccanica restructured, selling its stake in VM Motori to company managers and Midland Montague in a leveraged buyout, leaving the company with its single Cento plant.

Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) bought VM Motori in 1995. In 2000, DDC was purchased by DaimlerChrysler AG.

In 2003, Penske Corporation purchased a 51% stake in VM Motori; in 2007, Penske bought the remaining 49% from Detroit Diesel Corporation and subsequently sold 50% of it to General Motors.

In September 2008, GAZ Group announced plans to purchase a 50% stake from Penske Corp, but ultimately cancelled them in February 2009.

On 11 February 2011, Fiat Powertrain Technologies and Penske Corporation had reached an agreement under which Fiat Powertrain would purchase Penske Corporation&#x27;s fifty-percent stake in VM Motori S.p.A.&lt;ref name=&quot;italiaspeed.com/2011&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiat Group Automobiles acquired the remaining 50% stake of VM Motori S.p.A. owned by General Motors, on 28 October 2013.

== Products and licensing ==

In 1947, the company produced the first Italian air-cooled diesel engine with direct injection.

In 1964, the company introduced entire new families of air-cooled diesel engines for fishing boats and the industrial machine markets.

The year 1974 saw the introduction of a new series of high-speed (4,200 rpm) HR-series, pre-combustion chamber, water-cooled, turbocharged engines.

The Alfa Romeo Alfetta, produced in Arese, rolled off the line with a VM Motori engine under the bonnet in 1979, signaling VM&#x27;s move to the OEM automotive market. This was Italy&#x27;s first turbodiesel engine. The engines still retained some maritime features, such as individual heads for each cylinder - a design which made it easier to produce different cylinder configurations.

During the 1980s, British Leyland chose VM engines as the smoothest, most petrol-like units available for diesel models of their Range Rover and Rover SD1; the choice continued with the later Rover 800.

The Covini B24, T40 and C36 models all used VM Motori turbodiesel engines ranging from 4 to 6 cylinders.

The after-cooled, electronic-combustion, &quot;Turbotronic&quot; engine was unveiled in 1990. It was supplied to Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, and Rover.

In 1995, when OEM automotive sales accounted for 75% of income, a major deal with Chrysler saw agreements to supply engines for their Jeep Cherokee, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Voyager (2.5-litre) models. VM Motori&#x27;s 2.8-litre common rail turbodiesel engine was chosen for the Jeep Liberty CRD(Cherokee in Europe). The 2005 and later Chrysler Grand Voyager and 2012 model year Chevrolet Colorado That sale in Thailand is also fitted with the VM 2.8-litre (R428) engine.

In 1998 a new four-cylinder 2.0-litre turbocharged diesel engine and its three-cylinder derivate a 1.5-litre turbocharged diesel engine was developed by VM Motori. Engines featured a single overhead camshaft, four valves per cylinder, and common rail direct fuel injection. Both engines were licensed to the South Korean manufacturer Hyundai. 1.5-litre engine was used in the second generation of the Hyundai Accent, the Hyundai Getz and the Hyundai Matrix. These were produced and marketed between the fall of 2001 and the end of 2005. The 2.0-litre engine was used in many Hyundai and Kia models as the only diesel variant.

In 2004, GM Daewoo licensed the 1.5-litre and 2.0-litre common rail engine designs, and built a dedicated engine plant, which started production 2006. The 2.0 L diesel is used in the Daewoo Winstorm (also badged as the Chevrolet Captiva, and in the related Opel Antara), the Daewoo Lacetti (also badged as the Chevrolet Lacetti), the Daewoo Tosca (also badged as the Chevrolet Epica) and the Chevrolet Cruze.

The latest vehicle to benefit from a 2.5 L VM Motori diesel engine is the purpose-built LTI (London Taxis International) London style taxicab. The TX4 is the first of the TX range of taxis to include a VM Motori engine.

The company is also selling its products to off-highway applications, such as marine and defense. MTU Friedrichshafen, a German diesel engine manufacturer, holds the exclusive sales rights for VM Motori off-highway engines outside of Italy In the years 2007–2010 the Diesel 2.8 was used in the Dodge Nitro: power: 177 PS (130 kW; 175 hp); torque: 410–460 N⋅m (302–339 lb⋅ft)

In June 2010, VM Motori started the production of the new 2.8L 4-cylinder Euro 5 engine to power the 2011 Jeep Wrangler, 2011 Jeep Cherokee and 2012 Lancia Voyager. The A428 makes and of torque at 1,800 rpm. On the manual version of the Jeep Wrangler, the A428 features the Stop/Start system to reduce the emissions.

In January 2011, VM Motori launched its brand new engine 3.0L V6 Variable Valve Timing A 630 DOHC With and of torque. Thanks to a collaboration with Fiat Powertrain Technologies, the engine features the latest FPT Common Rail Multijet2 technology for improved performance, fuel economy and NVH. In 2013, the engine was redesigned to comply with Euro5+ emissions standards.

The first application of the A 630 DOHC was the 2011 Grand Cherokee. From 2014 to 2023, the same engine—rebranded as the EcoDiesel—powerd the Ram 1500, Jeep Grand Cherokee, Jeep Wrangler, and Jeep Gladiator; and in lightly tuned form, the Maserati Ghibli III. The engine won several awards including Ward&#x27;s 10 Best engines of 2014 during its first model year of production in the Jeep &amp;Ram. And has gone on for an unprecedented diesel &#x27;repeat&#x27; winning Ward&#x27;s Top 10 List again in 2015 and 2016. Stellantis has sold upwards of 250,000 vehicles with the engine but an estimated 50,000 of them have failed. The engine has been a subject of several class action lawsuits.

<doc id="1227105" wikidata="Q1527834" url="?curid=1227105" title="RKKY interaction">
<text>In the physical theory of spin glass magnetization, the Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida (RKKY) interaction models the coupling of nuclear magnetic moments or localized inner d- or f-shell electron spins through conduction electrons. It is named after Malvin Ruderman, Charles Kittel, Tadao Kasuya, and Kei Yosida, the physicists who first proposed and developed the model. 

Malvin Ruderman and Charles Kittel of the University of California, Berkeley first proposed the model to explain unusually broad nuclear spin resonance lines in natural metallic silver. The theory is an indirect exchange coupling: the hyperfine interaction couples the nuclear spin of one atom to a conduction electron also coupled to the spin of a different nucleus. The assumption of hyperfine interaction turns out to be unnecessary, and can be replaced equally well with the exchange interaction. 

The simplest treatment assumes a Bloch wavefunction basis and therefore only applies to crystalline systems; the resulting correlation energy, computed with perturbation theory, takes the following form: formula_1 where represents the Hamiltonian, is the distance between the nuclei and , is the nuclear spin of atom , is a matrix element that represents the strength of the hyperfine interaction, is the effective mass of the electrons in the crystal, and is the Fermi momentum. Intuitively, we may picture this as when one magnetic atom scatters an electron wave, which then scatters off another magnetic atom many atoms away, thus coupling the two atoms&#x27; spins.

Tadao Kasuya from Nagoya University later proposed that a similar indirect exchange coupling could occur with localized inner d-electron spins instead of nuclei. This theory was expanded more completely by Kei Yosida of the UC Berkeley, to give a Hamiltonian that describes (d-electron spin)–(d-electron spin), (nuclear spin)–(nuclear spin), and (d-electron spin)–(nuclear spin) interactions. J.H. Van Vleck clarified some subtleties of the theory, particularly the relationship between the first- and second-order perturbative contributions.

Perhaps the most significant application of the RKKY theory has been to the theory of giant magnetoresistance (GMR). GMR was discovered when the coupling between thin layers of magnetic materials separated by a non-magnetic spacer material was found to oscillate between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic as a function of the distance between the layers. This ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic oscillation is one prediction of the RKKY theory.

<text>The Baumgarten Prize was founded by Ferenc Ferdinánd Baumgarten on October 17, 1923. It was awarded every year from 1929 to 1949 (except for 1945). In its time, it was the most prestigious literary prize awarded by Hungary and is considered as equivalent to the subsequent literary prizes established in 20th century Hungary, the Attila József Prize and the Kossuth Prize.

In accordance with the founder&#x27;s will, it was given to Hungarian authors who had pursued literary excellence devoid of biases, regardless of creating material hardship for themselves. The foundation was administered by the Baumgarten Board of Trustees, whose members were lawyer Lóránt Basch and writer Mihály Babits (from 1941, after Babits&#x27; death, Aladár Schöpflin), and it was assisted by an 8-member advisory board. During its existence, the prize had a major significance in developing Hungarian literature.

It was given, among others, to the following people: Valéria Dienes (1934), (1929, 1931, 1933), Andor Endre Gelléri (1932, 1934), Gyula Illyés (four times), (1939), Gyula Juhász (1929, 1930, 1931), Géza Képes (1943, 1949), Ágnes Nemes Nagy (1946), (1936), Lőrinc Szabó (1932, 1937, 1944), (1947), Antal Szerb, Miklós Radnóti, Miklós Szentkuthy, Sándor Weöres, Győző Csorba, Áron Tamási (three times), Albert Wass, Emil Kolozsvári Grandpierre, Attila József (posthumous), Károly Kerényi, János Pilinszky, Józsi Jenő Tersánszky (four times), Tibor Déry, Pál Szabó, Lajos Fülep, Gábor Devecseri, László Németh, Nagy Lajos (three times), Magda Szabó (repealed).

<text>The armet is a type of combat helmet which was developed in the 15th century. It was extensively used in Italy, France, England, the Low Countries and Spain. It was distinguished by being the first helmet of its era to completely enclose the head while being compact and light enough to move with the wearer. Its use was essentially restricted to the fully armoured man-at-arms.

==Appearance and origins==

As the armet was fully enclosing, and narrowed to follow the contours of the neck and throat, it had to have a mechanical means of opening and closing to enable it to be worn. The typical armet consisted of four pieces: the skull, the two large hinged cheek-pieces which locked at the front over the chin, and a visor which had a double pivot, one either side of the skull. The cheek-pieces opened laterally by means of horizontal hinges; when closed they overlapped at the chin, fastening by a spring-pin which engaged in a corresponding hole, or by a swivel-hook and pierced staple. A reinforcement for the bottom half of the face, known as a &quot;wrapper&quot;, was sometimes added; its straps were protected by a metal disc at the base of the skull piece called a &quot;rondel.&quot; The visor attached to each pivot via hinges with removable pins, as in the later examples of the bascinet. This method remained in use until , after which the hinge disappeared and the visor had a solid connection to its pivot. The earlier armet often had a small aventail, a piece of mail attached to the bottom edge of each cheek-piece.

The earliest surviving armet dates to 1420 and was made in Milan. An Italian origin for this type of helmet therefore seems to be indicated. The innovation of a reduced skull and large hinged cheek pieces was such a radical departure from previous forms of helmet that it is highly probable that the armet resulted from the invention of a single armourer or soldier, and not as the result of evolution from earlier forms. However, a number of Italian bascinets dating to (sometimes termed &#x27;Venetian great bascinets&#x27;) were discovered in Chalcis, Greece; these possess a single hinged cheekpiece (the other being immobile). This may have had some influence on the development of the armet.

==Use and variations==
The armet reached the height of its popularity during the late 15th and early 16th centuries, when western European full plate armour had been perfected. The term armet was often applied in contemporary usage to any fully enclosing helmet, however, modern scholarship draws a distinction between the armet and the outwardly similar close helmet (or close helm) on the basis of their construction, especially their means of opening to allow them to be worn. While an armet had two large cheekpieces hinged at the skull and opened laterally, a close helmet instead had a kind of movable bevor which was attached to the same pivot points as its visor and opened vertically.

The classic armet had a narrow extension to the back of the skull reaching down to the nape of the neck, and the cheekpieces were hinged, horizontally, directly from the main part of the skull. From about 1515, the Germans produced a variant armet where the downward extension of the skull was made much wider, reaching as far forward as the ears. The cheekpieces on this type of helmet opened sideways, on vertical hinges on the edges of this wider neck element. The high-quality English Greenwich armours often included this type of armet from . Greenwich-made armets adopted the elegant two-piece visor found on contemporary close helmets; armets of this form were manufactured until as late as 1615. The lower edge of such helmets often closed over a flange in the upper edge of a gorget-piece. The helmet could then rotate without allowing a gap in the armour that a weapon point could enter.

The armet is found in many contemporary pieces of artwork, such as Paolo Uccello&#x27;s &quot;The Battle of San Romano&quot;, and is almost always shown as part of a Milanese armor. These depictions show armets worn with tall and elaborate crests, largely of feathered plumes; however, no surviving armets have similar crests and very few show obvious provision for the attachment of such crests.

The armet was most popular in Italy, however, in England, France and Spain it was widely used by men-at-arms alongside the sallet, whilst in Germany the latter helmet was much more common. It is believed that the close helmet resulted from a combination of various elements derived from each of the preceding helmet types.

<text>The Savage Club, founded in 1857, is a gentlemen&#x27;s club in London, named after the poet, Richard Savage. Despite this, the club&#x27;s logo is of an American Indian in a feathered headdress. Members are drawn from the fields of art, drama, law, literature, music or science.

==History==

The founding meeting of the Savage Club took place on 12 October 1857, at the Crown Tavern, Vinegar Yard, Drury Lane, after a letter by &quot;pro tempore&quot; honorary secretary George Augustus Sala was sent to prospective members. The letter advised it would be &#x27;a meeting of gentlemen connected with literature and the fine arts, and warmly interested in the promotion of Christian knowledge, and the sale of exciseable liquors&#x27; with a view to &#x27;forming a social society or club&#x27;. The inaugural gathering would also decide upon the new association&#x27;s &#x27;suitable designation&#x27;.Around 20 attended the first meeting including William Brough, Robert Brough, Leicester Silk Buckingham, John Deffett Francis, Gustav von Franck, Bill Hale, Sala, Dr G. L. Strauss and William Bernhardt Tegetmeier.

Andrew Halliday, joint honorary secretary in 1858, and later club president, wrote in his 1867 anthology of how the &#x27;suitable designation&#x27; was determined:

Many of the original members were drawn from the ranks of bohemian journalists and writers for &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; who considered themselves unlikely to be accepted into the older, arts related Garrick Club, but, within two decades, the Savage Club itself had become &#x27;almost respectable&#x27;. The early requirement – &#x27;a working man in literature or art&#x27; – was soon broadened to include musicians, and the club&#x27;s first piano was hired in 1871, prompting Halliday to tell another member &#x27;Hang your piano... it&#x27;s ruining the Club&#x27;. An associated Masonic lodge was established in 1887.

The club has hosted a variety of guests over the years including American writer and humorist Mark Twain, and the Australian cricket team during its 1934 English tour. In the aftermath of World War II, Oswald Mosley, founder of the British Union of Fascists, arrived as a guest of Henry Williamson, author of &quot;Tarka the Otter&quot;, but was asked to leave. The club features in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s classic novel, &quot;The Lost World&quot;.

The club moved from its original home at the Crown Tavern, the next year to the Nell Gwynne Tavern. In 1863 it moved to Gordon&#x27;s Hotel in Covent Garden, then to 6–7 Adelphi Terrace, later to 9 Fitzmaurice Place, Berkeley Square, London W1, and, from 1936 to the end of 1963, Carlton House Terrace in St James&#x27;s (previously the home of the Conservative statesman Lord Curzon). In 1990, the club moved to a room within the National Liberal Club at 1 Whitehall Place, London SW1. In 2020 it was issued with a year&#x27;s notice by the General Committee of the National Liberal Club as part of a negotiation around its future occupancy. A source at the National Liberal Club commented: &quot;The red line for us is whether one of our members, of any sex, could use the Savage Club&#x27;s bar whenever it is opened.&quot; Members of the National Liberal Club (or indeed of any other non-reciprocal Club) would however not be allowed to use the Savage Club&#x27;s facilities unless invited as guests, as is the case with any private Members&#x27; club, and the Savage Club does admit ladies as guests to the whole of its premises.

==The club today==
In 1962, the club had around 1,000 members, at present, there are over 300. It remains one of the small number of London clubs that does not admit women as members, although women are admitted as guests. The club maintains a tradition of regular dinners for members and their guests, always followed by entertainment, often featuring distinguished musical performers from the club&#x27;s membership. Several times a year members invite ladies to share both the dinner and the entertainment, and on these occasions guests always include widows of former Savages, who are known as Rosemaries (after rosemary, a symbol of remembrance).

There are also monthly lunches, which are followed by a talk given by a member or an invited guest on a subject of which he has specific expert knowledge.

===Membership===
Members are classified into one of six categories which best describes their main interest: art, drama, law, literature, music or science. They must be proposed and seconded by two existing members, and if unknown by any other members, are required to attend a club function in order to meet some members. The category of membership might mirror a member&#x27;s profession, though there are many members with an interest in one or more of the membership categories, but who practise none professionally. There is a range of membership fees depending on membership category.

During the weekend, members are permitted to use the East India Club in St James&#x27;s Square and the Oxford and Cambridge Club in Pall Mall. There are also reciprocal arrangements with other clubs internationally. Members of the Savage Club may also use accommodation at the Savile, Farmers and Lansdowne Clubs.

==The Savage Club Masonic Lodge==
On 11 February 1882, the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), attended a dinner in his honour at the Savage Club, before becoming a member. The Prince suggested a Masonic lodge, associated with the club, should be formed.

The Savage Club Lodge, No. 2190 received its Warrant of Constitution on 18 December 1886, and was consecrated on 18 January 1887, with war correspondent Sir John Richard Sommers Vine as the first Master. The first treasurer was the actor Sir Henry Irving, followed by the actor Edward O&#x27;Connor Terry in 1888. This tendency towards the arts continued to be reflected in the Lodge&#x27;s membership for many years.

The club and lodge have never been formally connected except in name. Lodge membership is not restricted to Savage Club members; however, most who join still have a professional life in literature, art, drama, music, science or law.

<text>Prime Directive is a role-playing game set in the &quot;Star Trek&quot;-derived Star Fleet Universe. The game has gone through two different incarnations.

==&quot;Prime Directive&quot; RPG==
The original release of &quot;Prime Directive&quot; was published by Task Force Games in 1993. Using an in-house design by Mark Costello and Timothy D. Olsen, it used a D6-style system similar to &quot;Shadowrun&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Aspects of the game include a multi-tiered task resolution system, where characters can achieve &#x27;Complete&#x27;, &#x27;Moderate&#x27;, &#x27;Minimal&#x27;, &#x27;Failure&#x27; or &#x27;Botch&#x27; levels of success with their actions, and the Character Reputation and Background system that allows characters to “spontaneously” develop skills, abilities, and prior associations appropriate to the mission at hand. 

The published books for the game included the core rulebook, a Federation sourcebook. and a few adventure books.

===&quot;GURPS Prime Directive&quot;===
After the folding of Task Force Games and the cancellation of the original &quot;Prime Directive&quot; line, Amarillo Design Bureau, Inc., the new publishers of Star Fleet Universe games, were left with the question of what to do with &quot;PD&quot;. They were primarily a wargame company, and the poor sales of the supplements were cause for a reexamination. Eventually, they approached Steve Jackson Games to utilize the &quot;Powered by GURPS&quot; format.

===&quot;D20 Prime Directive&quot; and &quot;D20M Prime Directive&quot;===
The core rulebook, &quot;D20 Klingons&quot;, &quot;D20 Romulans&quot; (no D20M as of Aug 2011), and &quot;D20 Federation&quot; are available for this system. Supplements for the Gorns, Tholians and other empires/races are in various writing stages.

==Prime Teams==

Prime Teams are a concept pioneered in the original &quot;Prime Directive&quot; game. The concept is a specialized landing party that can perform a variety of functions, including science, negotiations, and combat. While &quot;Prime Teams&quot; are a Federation designation, nearly every empire has their own equivalent.

==Reception==
Chris McCubbin reviewed &quot;Prime Directive&quot; for &quot;Pyramid&quot; #7 (May 1994) and stated that &quot;My advice to &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans interested in &quot;Prime Directive&quot; is to play it, but play it on its own terms, as a good, solid outer space military adventure, without trying to squeeze it into the TV show&#x27;s mold in every tiny detail. To tell you the truth, the universe of &quot;Prime Directive&quot; is much more playable than the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe anyway, while preserving most of the elements that got trekkies interested in &quot;Star Trek&quot; in the first place.&quot;

Jason Fryer reviewed &quot;Prime Directive&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #48 (Oct., 1994), rating it a 4 out of 5 and stated that &quot;The price is more than fair, and with its sample adventures, &quot;Prime Directive&quot; provides you with everything you need to run the game.&quot;

<doc id="1227129" wikidata="Q753235" url="?curid=1227129" title="Labyrinthodontia">
<text>&quot;Labyrinthodontia&quot; (Greek, &#x27;maze-toothed&#x27;) is an informal grouping of extinct predatory amphibians which were major components of ecosystems in the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic eras (about 390 to 150 million years ago). Traditionally considered a subclass of the class Amphibia, modern classification systems recognize that labyrinthodonts are not a formal natural group (clade) exclusive of other tetrapods. Instead, they consistute an evolutionary grade (a paraphyletic group), ancestral to living tetrapods such as lissamphibians (modern amphibians) and amniotes (reptiles, mammals, and kin). &quot;Labyrinthodont&quot;-grade vertebrates evolved from lobe-finned fishes in the Devonian, though a formal boundary between fish and amphibian is difficult to define at this point in time.

&quot;Labyrinthodont&quot; generally refers to extinct four-limbed tetrapods with a large body size and a crocodile-like lifestyle. The name describes the pattern of infolding of the dentin and enamel of the teeth, which are often the only part of the creatures that fossilize. They are also distinguished by a broad, strongly-built skull roof composed of many small heavily-textured skull bones. &quot;Labyrinthodonts&quot; generally have complex multi-part vertebrae, and several classification schemes have utilized vertebrae to define subgroups.

Because labyrinthodonts do not form a monophyletic group, many modern researchers have abandoned the term. However, some have continued to use the group in their classifications, at least informally, pending more detailed study of their relationships. Many authors prefer to simply use the term tetrapod, while others have re-defined the previously obsolete term Stegocephalia (&quot;roof heads&quot;) as a cladistic alternative to &quot;Labyrinthodontia&quot; or &quot;Tetrapoda&quot;.

==Labyrinthodont traits==

The labyrinthodonts flourished for more than 200 million years. Particularly the early forms exhibited a lot of variation, yet there are still a few basic anatomical traits that make their fossils very distinct and easily recognizable in the field:
* Strongly folded tooth surface, involving infolding of the dentin and enamel of the teeth. The cross section resembles a classical labyrinth (or maze), hence the name of the group.
* Massive skull roof, with openings only for the nostrils, eyes and a parietal eye, similar to the structure of the &quot;anapsid&quot; reptiles. With the exception of the later more reptile-like forms, the skull was rather flat and strongly ornamented with presumably tough dermal covering, accounting for an older term for the group: &quot;Stegocephalia&quot;.
* Otic notch behind each eye at the back edge of the skull. In earlier fully aquatic forms such as &quot;Ichthyostega&quot;, it may have formed an open spiracle. In later terrestrial forms such as &quot;Seymouria&quot;, it may possibly have held a tympanic membrane (eardrum).
* Complex vertebrae made of multiple components: an intercentrum (wedge-shaped front lower piece), two pleurocentra (upper rear piece), and a vertebral arch/spine (upper projection). The relative development and shape of the elements is highly variable.

Labyrinthodonts were generally amphibian-like in build. They were short-legged and mostly large headed, with moderately short to long tails. Many groups, and all the early forms, were large animals. Primitive members of all labyrinthodont groups were probably true water predators, and various degrees of amphibious, semi-aquatic and semi terrestrial modes of living arose independently in different groups. Some lineages remained waterbound or became secondarily fully aquatic with reduced limbs and elongated, eel-like bodies.

===Skull===
With the exception of the snake-like aïstopods, the skulls of labyrinthodonts were massive. The broad head and short neck may have been a result of respiratory constraints. Their jaws were lined with small, sharp, conical teeth and the roof of the mouth bore larger tusk-like teeth. The teeth were replaced in waves that traveled from the front of the jaw to the back in such a way that every other tooth was mature, and the ones in between were young. All teeth were labyrinthodont. The sole exception were the chisel-like teeth of some of the advanced herbivorous diadectomorphs. The skull had prominent otic notches behind each eye and a parietal eye.

===Post-cranial skeleton===
The vertebrae were complex and not particularly strong, consisting of numerous, often poorly ossified elements. The long bones of the limbs were short and broad and the ankle had limited mobility and the toes lacked claws, limiting the amount of traction the feet could produce. This would have made most labyrinthodonts slow and clumsy on land. In adulthood, most of the larger species were likely confined to water. Some late Paleozoic groups, particularly microsaurs and seymouriamorphs, were small to medium-sized and appear to have been competent terrestrial animals. The advanced diadectomorphs from the Late Carboniferous and Early Permian were fully terrestrial with stout skeletons, and were the heaviest land animals of their time. The Mesozoic labyrinthodonts were primarily aquatic with increasingly cartilaginous skeleton.

===Sensory apparatus===
The eyes of most labyrinthodonts were situated at the top of the skull, offering good vision upwards, but very little lateral vision. The parietal eye was prominent, although there is uncertainty as to whether it was a true image producing organ or one that could only register light and dark, like that of the modern tuatara.

Most labyrinthodonts had special sense organs in the skin, forming a lateral line organ for perception of water flow and pressure, like those found in fish and a number of modern amphibians. This would enable them to pick up the vibration of their prey and other waterborne sounds while hunting in murky, weed filled waters. Early labyrinthodont groups had massive stapes, likely primarily anchoring the brain case to the skull roof. It is a question of some doubt whether early terrestrial labyrinthodonts had the stapes connected to a tympanum covering their otic notch, and if they had an aerial sense of hearing at all. The tympanum in anurans and amniotes appear to have evolved separately, indicating most, if not all, labyrinthodonts were unable to pick up airborne sound.

===Respiration===
The early labyrinthodonts possessed well developed internal gills as well as primitive lungs, derived from the swim bladders of their ancestors. They could breathe air, which would have been a great advantage for residents of warm shoals with low oxygen levels in the water. There was no diaphragma and the ribs in many forms were too short or spaced too closely to aid in expanding the lungs. Likely air was inflated into the lungs by contractions of a throat sac against the skull floor like in modern amphibians, which may be the reason for the retention of the very flat skull in later forms. Exhalation with the aid of the ribs probably evolved only in the line leading to amniotes. Many aquatic forms retained their larval gills in adulthood.

With the high atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide pressure, particularly during the Carboniferous, the primitive throat sac breathing would have been sufficient for obtaining oxygen even for the large forms. Getting rid of carbon dioxide would present a greater problem on land, and the larger labyrinthodonts probably combined a high tolerance for blood carbonic acid with returning to the water to dissipate the carbon dioxide through the skin. The loss of the armour of rhomboid scales of their piscine ancestors allowed for this as well as additional respiration through the skin as in modern amphibians.

===Hunting and feeding===
Like their sarcopterygian ancestors, the labyrinthodonts were carnivorous. The rather broad, flat skulls and hence short jaw muscle would however not allow them to open their mouth to any great extent. Likely the majority of them would employ a sit-and-wait strategy, similar to that of many modern amphibians. When suitable prey swam or walked within reach, the jaw would slam shut, the palatine tusks stabbing the hapless victim. The strain put on the teeth by this mode of feeding may have been the reason for the reinforcing labyrinthodont enamel typifying the group. Swallowing was done by tipping the head back, as seen in many modern amphibians and in crocodiles.

Evolution of a deeper skull, better jaw control and a reduction of the palatine tusks is only seen in the more advanced reptile-like forms, possibly in connection with the evolution of more effective breathing, allowing for a more refined hunting style.

===Reproduction===
The labyrinthodonts had an amphibious reproduction — they laid eggs in water, where they would hatch to tadpoles. They would remain in water throughout the larval stage until metamorphosis. Only the metamorphosed individuals would eventually venture onto land on occasion. Fossil tadpoles from several species are known, as are neotenic adults with feathery external gills similar to those found in modern lissamphibian tadpoles and in the fry of lungfish and bichirs. The existence of a larval stage as the primitive condition in all groups of labyrinthodonts can be fairly safely assumed, in that tadpoles of &quot;Discosauriscus&quot;, a close relative of the amniotes, are known.

==Groups of labyrinthodonts==
The systematic placement of groups within Labyrinthodontia is notoriously fickle. Several groups are identified, but there is no consensus of their phylogenetic relationship. Many key groups were small with moderately ossified skeletons, and there is a gap in the fossil record in the early Carboniferous (the &quot;Romer&#x27;s gap&quot;) when most of the groups appear to have evolved. Further complicating the picture is the amphibian larval-adult life cycle, with physical changes throughout life complicating phylogenetic analysis. The Labyrinthodontia appear to be composed of several nested clades. The two best understood groups, the Ichthyostegalia and the reptile-like amphibians have from the outset been known to be paraphyletic. Tellingly, labyrinthodont systematics was the subject of the inaugural meeting of International Society for Phylogenetic Nomenclature.

===Ichthyostegalia===
The early labyrinthodonts are known from the Devonian and possibly extending into the Romer&#x27;s Gap of the early Carboniferous. These labyrinthodonts are often grouped together as the order Ichthyostegalia, though the group is an evolutionary grade rather than a clade. Ichthyostegalians were predominantly aquatic and most show evidence of functional internal gills throughout life, and probably only occasionally ventured onto land. Their polydactylous feet had more than the usual five digits for tetrapods and were paddle-like. The tail bore true fin rays like those found in fish. The vertebrae were complex and rather weak. At the close of the Devonian, forms with progressively stronger legs and vertebrae evolved, and the later groups lacked functional gills as adults. All were however predominantly aquatic and some spent all or nearly all their lives in water.

===Reptile-like amphibians===
An early branch was the terrestrial reptile-like amphibians, variously called Anthracosauria or Reptiliomorpha. &quot;Tulerpeton&quot; has been suggested as the earliest member of the line, indicating the split may have happened before the Devonian-Carboniferous transition. Their skulls were relatively deep and narrow compared to other labyrinthodonts. Front and hind feet bore five digits on most forms. Several of the early groups are known from brackish or even marine environments, having returned to a more or less fully aquatic mode of living.

With the exception of the diadectomorphs, the terrestrial forms were moderately sized creatures that appeared in the early Carboniferous. The vertebrae of the group foreshadowed that of primitive reptiles, with small pleurocentra, which grew and fused to become the true centrum in later vertebrates. The most well known genus is &quot;Seymouria&quot;. Some members of the most advanced group, the Diadectomorpha, were herbivorous and grew to several meters in length, with great, barrel-shaped bodies. Small relatives of the diadectomorphs gave rise to the first reptiles in the Late Carboniferous.

===Temnospondyli===
The most diverse group of labyrinthodonts was the Temnospondyli. Temnospondyls appeared in the early Carboniferous and came in all sizes, from small salamander-like Stereospondyli that scurried along the waters edge and undergrowth, to giant, well armoured Archegosauroidea that looked more like crocodiles. &quot;Prionosuchus&quot; was an exceptionally large member of the Archegosauridae, estimated to have been up to 9 meters long, it is the largest amphibian ever known to have lived. Temnospondyls typically had large heads and heavy shoulder girdles with moderately long tails. A fossil trackway from Lesotho shows larger forms dragged themselves by the front limbs over slippery surfaces with limited sideways movement of the body, very unlike modern salamanders.

A temnospondyl&#x27;s fore-foot had only four toes, and the hind-foot five, similar to the pattern seen in modern amphibians. Temnospondyls had a conservative vertebral column in which the pleurocentra remained small in primitive forms, vanishing entirely in the more advanced ones. The intercentra bore the weight of the animal, being large and forming a complete ring. All were more or less flat-headed with either strong or secondarily weak vertebrae and limbs. There were also fully aquatic forms, like the Dvinosauria, and even marine forms such as the Trematosauridae. The Temnospondyli may have given rise to the modern frogs and salamanders in the late Permian or early Triassic.

===Lepospondyli===
A small group of uncertain origin, the Lepospondyli evolved mostly small species that can be found in European and North American Carboniferous and early Permian strata. They are characterized by simple spool-shaped vertebrae formed from a single element, rather than the complex system found in other labyrinthodont groups. Most were aquatic and external gills are sometimes found preserved. The Leposondyli were generally salamander-like, but one group, the Aïstopoda, was snakelike with flexible, reduced skulls, though whether the families belong with the other lepospondyls is uncertain. Some microsaur lepospondyls were squat and short-tailed and appear to have been well adapted to terrestrial life. The best known genus is &quot;Diplocaulus&quot;, a nectridean with a boomerang-shaped head.

The position of Lepospondyli in relation to other labyrinthodont groups is uncertain, and it is sometimes classified as a separate subclass. The teeth were not labyrinthodont, and the group has classically been seen as separate from the Labyrinthodontia. There is some doubt as to whether the lepospondyls form a phylogenetic unit at all, or is a wastebin taxon containing the padamorphic forms and tadpoles of other labyrinthodonts, notably the reptile-like amphibians, or even very small primitive amniotes with reduced skulls.

==Evolutionary history==

The labyrinthodonts have their origin in the early middle Devonian (398–392 Mya) or possibly earlier. They evolved from a bony fish group: the fleshy-finned Rhipidistia. The only other living group of Rhipidistans alive today are the lungfish, the sister group of the landliving vertebrates. Earliest traces of the land-living forms are fossil trackways from Zachełmie quarry, Poland, dated to 395 million years ago, attributed to an animal with feet very similar to Ichthyostega.

===Swamp predators===
By the late Devonian, land plants had stabilized freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. The early labyrinthodonts were wholly aquatic, hunting in shallow water along tidal shores or weed filled tidal channels. From their piscine ancestors, they had inherited swim bladders that opened to the esophagus and were capable of functioning as lungs (a condition still found in lungfish and some physostome ray-finned fishes), allowing them to hunt in stagnant water or in waterways where rotting vegetation would have lowered oxygen content. The earliest forms, such as &quot;Acanthostega&quot;, had vertebrae and limbs quite unsuited to life on land. This is in contrast to the earlier view that fish had first invaded the land—either in search of prey like modern mudskippers, or to find water when the pond they lived in dried out. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, suggesting marine and brackish areas were their primary habitat. This is further corroborated by fossils of early labyrinthodonts being found scattered all around the world, indicating they must have spread by following the coastal lines rather than through freshwater only.

The first labyrinthodonts were all large to moderately large animals, and would have suffered considerable problems on land despite their members ending in toes rather than fin-rays. While they retained gills and fish-like skulls and tails with fin rays, the early forms can readily be separated from Rhipidistan fish by the cleithrum/scapula complex being separate from the skull to form a pectoral girdle able to carry the weight of the front end of the animals. They were all carnivorous, initially eating fish and possibly going ashore to feed off washed up carrion of sea animals caught in tidal ponds, only later turning into predators of the large invertebrates of the Devonian at the waters edge. The various early forms are for convenience grouped together as Ichthyostegalia.

While the body shape and proportions of the ichthyostegalians went largely unchanged throughout their evolutionary history, the limbs underwent a rapid evolution. The proto-tetrapods like from &quot;Elginerpeton&quot; and &quot;Tiktaalik&quot; had extremities ending in fin-rays with no clear fingers, primarily suited for movement in open water, but also capable of propelling the animal across sandbanks and through vegetation filled waterways. &quot;Ichthyostega&quot; and &quot;Acanthostega&quot; had paddle-like polydactyl feet with stout bony toes that also would have enabled them to drag themselves across land. The aquatic ichthyostegalians flourished in tidal channels and swampland through the remainder of the Devonian, only to disappear from the fossil record at the transition to the Carboniferous.

===Onto land===

The end of the Devonian saw the late Devonian extinction event, followed by a gap in the fossil record of some 15 million years at the start of the Carboniferous, called &quot;Romer&#x27;s gap&quot;. The gap marks the disappearance of the ichthyostegalian forms as well as the origin of the higher labyrinthodonts. Finds from this period found in East Kirkton Quarry includes the peculiar, probably secondarily aquatic &quot;Crassigyrinus&quot;, which may represent the sister group to later labyrinthodont groups.

Early Carboniferous saw the radiation of the family Loxommatidae, a distinct if mysterious group that may have been the ancestors or sister taxon of the higher groups, characterized by keyhole-shaped eye openings. By the Visean age of mid-Carboniferous times the labyrinthodonts had radiated into at least three main branches. Recognizable groups are representative of the temnospondyls, lepospondyls and reptile-like amphibians, the latter which were the relatives and ancestors of the Amniota.

While most labyrinthodonts remained aquatic or semi-aquatic, some of the reptile-like amphibians adapted to explore the terrestrial ecological niches as small or medium-sized predators. They evolved increasingly terrestrial adaptions during the Carboniferous, including stronger vertebrae and slender limbs, and a deeper skull with laterally placed eyes. They probably had watertight skin, possibly covered with a horny epidermis overlaying small bony nodules, forming scutes, similar to those found in modern caecilians. To the modern eye, these animals would appear like heavyset, lizards betraying their amphibious nature only by their lack of claws and by spawning aquatic eggs. In the middle or late Carboniferous, smaller forms gave rise to the first reptiles. In the late Carboniferous, a global rainforest collapse favoured the more terrestrially adapted reptiles, while the many of their amphibian relatives failed to reestablish. Some reptile-like amphibians did flourish in the new seasonal environment. The reptiliomorph family Diadectidae evolved herbivory, becoming the largest terrestrial animals of the day with barrel-shaped, heavy bodies. There were also a family of correspondingly large carnivores, the Limnoscelidae, that flourished briefly in the late Carboniferous.

===Heyday of the labyrinthodonts===

The herbivorous Diadectidae reached their maximum diversity in the late Carboniferous/early Permian, and then quickly declined, their role taken over by early reptilian herbivores like Pareiasaurs and Edaphosaurs. Unlike the reptile-like amphibians, the Temnospondyli remained mostly denizens of rivers and swampland, feeding on fish and perhaps other labyrinthodonts. They underwent a major diversification in the wake of the Carboniferous rainforest collapse and they too subsequently reached their greatest diversity in the late Carboniferous and early Permian, thriving in the rivers and brackish coal forests in continental shallow basins around equatorial Pangaea and around the Paleo-Tethys Ocean.

Several adaptations to piscivory evolved with some groups having crocodile-like skulls with slender snouts, and presumably had a similar life-style (Archegosauridae, Melosauridae, Cochleosauridae and Eryopidae, and the reptile-like suborder Embolomeri). Others evolved as aquatic ambush predators, with short, broad skulls that allowed for opening the mouth by tipping the skull back rather than dropping the jaw (Plagiosauridae and the Dvinosauria). In life they would have hunted rather like the modern day monkfish, and several groups are known to have retained the larval gills into adulthood, being fully aquatic. The Metoposauridae adapted to hunting in shallows and murky swamps, with ∩-shaped skull, much like their Devonian ancestors.

In Euramerica, the Lepospondyli, a host of small, mostly aquatic amphibians of uncertain phylogeny, appeared in the Carboniferous. They lived in the tropical forest undergrowth and in small ponds, in ecological niches similar to those of modern amphibians. In the Permian, the peculiar Nectridea found their way from Euramerica to Gondwanaland.

===Decline===
From the middle of the Permian, the climate dried up, making life difficult for the amphibians. The terrestrial reptiliomorphs disappeared, though aquatic crocodile-like Embolomeri continued to thrive until going extinct in the Triassic. The diverse lepospondyl inhabitants of the undergrowth disappear from the fossil record, among them the snake-like Aïstopoda.

With the close of the Paleozoic, most of the Permian groups disappeared, with the exceptions of the Mastodonsauroidea, Metoposauridae and Plagiosauridae, who continued into the Triassic. In the early Triassic these groups enjoyed a brief renaissance in the waterways of continental shallows, with large forms like &quot;Thoosuchus&quot;, &quot;Benthosuchus&quot; and &quot;Eryosuchus&quot;. Their ecological niches were probably similar to those of modern-day crocodiles, as fish hunters and riverside carnivores. All groups developed progressively weaker vertebrae, reduced limb ossification and flatter skulls with prominent lateral line organs, indicating the late Permian/early Triassic temnospondyls rarely if ever left the water. An extremely large brachyopid (likely a plagiosaur or a close relative) is estimated to have been 7 meters long, and probably just as heavy as the Permian &quot;Prionosuchus&quot;.

With the rise of the real crocodiles in the middle Triassic, even these Temnospondyli went into decline, though some hung on to at least early Cretaceous on the southern Gondwanaland, in regions too cold for crocodiles.

==Origin of modern amphibians==

There is today a general consensus that all modern amphibians, the Lissamphibia, have their origin in labyrinthodont stock, but this is where consensus ends. The fragile bones of the lissamphibians are extremely rare as fossils, and the modern amphibians are highly derived, making comparison with fossil labyrinthodonts difficult.

Traditionally, the Lepospondyli has been favored as lissamphibian ancestors. Like the modern amphibians, they were mostly small with simple vertebrae, resembling lissamphibians in many aspects of external anatomy and presumably ecological niches. At a subclass level, it was thought that labyrinthodonts gave rise to lepospondyls, and lepospondyls to lissamphibians. Several cladistic studies also favour the lepospondyl link, though placing Lepospondyli as close relatives or even derived from reptile-like amphibians. One problem with this position is the question of whether Lepospondyli actually is monophyletic in the first place.

Temnospondyl affinity for the Lissamphibia is suggested by other works. The temnospondyl family Amphibamidae has been considered a possible candidate for the ancestors of lissamphibians. The amphibamid &quot;Gerobatrachus&quot;, described in 2008, was proposed to be a transitional form between temnospondyls and anurans (frogs and toads) and caudatans (salamanders). It possessed a mixture of anuran and caudatan features, including a broad skull, short tail, and small pedicellate teeth.

Complicating the picture is the question of whether Lissamphibia itself may be polyphyletic. Though a minority view, several variants have been forwarded through history. The &quot;Stockholm school&quot; under Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh and Erik Jarvik argued during much of the 20th century that Amphibia as a whole is biphyletic, based on details of the nasal capsule and cranial nerves. In their view lepospondyls are ancestors of frogs, while salamanders and caecilians have evolved independently from porolepiform fish. Robert L. Carroll suggested the tailed amphibians (salamanders and caecilians) are derived from lepospondyl microsaurs and frogs from temnospondyls. The cladistic analysis of &quot;Gerobatrachus&quot; suggested salamanders and frogs evolved from temnospondyl stock and caecilians being the sister group of the reptile-like amphibians, rendering Lissamphibia itself an evolutionary grade relative to the remaining tetrapod classes. The cladistic analysis of &quot;Chinlestegophis&quot; by Pardo et al. (2017) does recover Lissamphibia as polyphyletic, but with all groups of lissamphibians falling within Temnospondyli; Batrachia is recovered in the analysis as part of Dissorophoidea, while Gymnophonia falls within Stereospondylomorpha.

==Origin of the amniotes==
The fossil sequence leading from the early Carboniferous labyrinthodonts to the amniotes has traditionally been seen as fairly well mapped out since the early 20th century, mainly leaving only the question of the demarcation line between the amphibian and reptilian grade of reproduction. Work by Carroll and Laurin around the turn of the millennium has greatly helped in pinpointing the transition.

The early reptile-like amphibians were mostly aquatic, the first highly terrestrially adapted groups being the Seymouriamorpha and the Diadectomorpha. The seymouriamorphs were small to medium-sized animals with stout limbs, their remains are sometimes found in what has been interpreted as dry environments, indicating their skin had a water-tight epidermal horny overlay or even scales as evident in &quot;Discosauriscus&quot;. Their skeletons are very similar to those of early reptiles, though finds of seymouriamorph tadpoles have shown they retained an amphibian reproduction. The diadectomorph families are generally considered to be the closest known relatives of modern amniotes. They too are thought to have been on the amphibian side of the divide, despite no known diadectomorph fossil tadpoles. Analysis of new finds and composition of larger trees do however indicate the phylogeny may not be as well understood as traditionally thought.

Several authors have suggested that terrestrial eggs evolved from amphibian eggs laid on land to avoid predation on the eggs and competition from other labyrinthodonts. The amniote egg would necessarily have had to evolve from one with an anamniote structure, as those found in fish and modern amphibians. In order for such an egg to excrete CO2 on land without the specialized membranes to aid in respiration, it would have to be very small, 1 cm in diameter or smaller. Such very small eggs with direct development would severely restrict the adult size, thus the amniotes would have evolved from very small animals. A number of small, fragmentary fossils of possibly diadectomorph affinity has been proposed as the first amniote, including &quot;Gephyrostegus&quot;, &quot;Solenodonsaurus&quot;, &quot;Westlothiana&quot; and &quot;Casineria&quot;. Fossilized footprints found in New Brunswick indicate the first reptiles were established by 315 million years ago.

==History of classification==

The term &quot;labyrinthodont&quot; was coined by Hermann Burmeister in reference to the tooth structure. Labyrinthodontia was first used as a systematic term by Richard Owen in 1860, and assigned to Amphibia the following year. 
It was ranked as an order under class Amphibia by Watson in 1920 and as a superorder by Romer in 1947. An alternative name, &quot;Stegocephalia&quot; was created in 1868 by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope, from Greek &quot;stego cephalia&quot;—&quot;roofed head&quot;, and refer to anapsid skull and the copious amounts of dermal armour some of the larger forms evidently had. This term is widely used in 19th and early 20th century literature.

Classification of the earliest finds was attempted on the basis of the skull roof, often the only part of the specimen preserved. With the frequent convergent evolution of head shape in labyrinthodonts, this led to form taxa only. The relationship of the various groups to each other and to the lissamphibians (and to some degree the first reptiles) is still a matter of some debate. Several schemes have been forwarded, and at present there is no consensus among workers in the field.

===Vertebral classification===
A systematic approach based on the relative size and shape of the elements of the complex labyrinthodont vertebrae was favored in the early 20th century. This classification quickly fell into disuse as some forms of backbones appear to have appeared more than once and different types are found in close relatives, sometimes even in the same animal, and already by the middle of the 20th century several of the small-bodied groups were suspected of being larval or neotenic forms. The classification presented here is from Watson, 1920:

* Order Stegocephalia (= Labyrinthodontia)
** &quot;Grade&quot; Rachitomi (Primitive complex vertebrae, all Ichthyostegalia, most large Temnospondyli and some reptile-like amphibians)
** &quot;Grade&quot; Embolomeri (Intercentrum and pleurocentrum cylinders of equal size, today considered a suborder of secondarily aquatic reptile-like amphibians)
** &quot;Grade&quot; Stereospondyli (Simplified backbones with only intercentrum and vertebral arch, still recognized as a valid group)
* Order Phyllospondyli (Small, flimsy vertebrae, today considered to represent tadpoles and paedomorphic forms)
* Order Lepospondyli (Hourglass-shaped or cylindrical vertebrae, mid Carboniferous to mid Permian, phylogeny uncertain)
* Order Adelospondyli (Cylindrical vertebrae with conical depressions at each end meeting in the middle, now considered a Lepospondyl group)
* Order Gymnophiona (extant)
* Order Urodela (extant)
* Order Anura (extant)

===Traditional classification===
The traditional classification was initiated by Säve-Söderbergh in the 1930s. He believed that Amphibia was biphyletic, and that salamanders and caecilians had evolved independently from porolopiform fish. Few shared Säve-Söderbergh&#x27;s view of a biphyletic Amphibia, but his scheme, either with the Lepospondyli as a separate subclass or sunk into Temnospondyli, was continued by Romer in his much used Vertebrate Paleontology of 1933 and later editions, and followed by several subsequent authors with minor variations: Colbert 1969, Daly 1973, Carroll 1988 and Hildebrand &amp; Goslow 2001. The classification cited here is from Romer &amp; Parson, 1985:

* Subclass Labyrinthodontia
** Order Ichthyostegalia (primitive ancestral forms, e.g., &quot;Ichthyostega&quot;—Middle to late Devonian only).
** Order Temnospondyli (Late Devonian to Cretaceous, e.g., &quot;Eryops&quot;, possibly ancestral to modern amphibians)
** Order Anthracosauria (Carboniferous and Permian, e.g., &quot;Seymouria&quot;, ancestral to early reptiles)
* Subclass Lepospondyli (Carboniferous and Permian, e.g., &quot;Diplocaulus&quot;, small group, possibly ancestral to modern amphibians)
* Subclass Lissamphibia (Permian to present)
** Order Gymnophiona (extant)
** Order Urodela (extant)
** Order Anura (extant)

===Phylogenetic classification===

Labyrinthodontia has fallen out of favor in recent taxonomies because it is paraphyletic: the group does not include all the descendants of their most recent common ancestor. Various groups that have traditionally been placed within Labyrinthodontia are currently variously classified as stem tetrapods, basal tetrapods, non-amniote Reptiliomorpha and as a monophyletic or paraphyletic Temnospondyli, according to various cladistic analysis. This reflects the emphasis of ascertaining lineage and ancestral-descendant relatedness in modern-day cladistics. The name does however linger as a handy reference for the early amphibian tetrapods, and as an apt anatomical description of their distinct tooth pattern. Thus it remains in use as an informal term of convenience by some modern scientists.

The largely synonymous name Stegocephalia has been taken up by Michel Laurin and defined cladistically for all traditional labyrinthodonts (including their descendants), so that the name with the largely traditional meaning is still employed. An informal term with a broader meaning is stem tetrapod, a stem group consisting of all species more closely related to modern tetrapods than to lungfish, but excluding the crown group. This group includes both traditional &quot;labyrinthodonts&quot; as well as more basal tetrapodomorph fish, though its total content is a matter of some uncertainty, as the relationships of these animals are not well understood.

Below is a suggested evolutionary tree of Vertebrates including the Labyrinthodontia, from Colbert 1969 and Caroll 1997. Dashed lines indicate relationships that commonly vary between authors.

A good summary (with diagram) of characteristics and main evolutionary trends of the above three orders is given in Colbert 1969 pp. 102–103, but see Kent &amp; Miller (1997) for an alternative tree.

<text>Presidential elections were held in Croatia in January 2005, the fourth such elections since independence in 1991. They were the first presidential elections held after the constitutional reforms of November 2000, which replaced a semi-presidential system with an incomplete parliamentary system, greatly reducing the powers of the president in favor of the Prime Minister and the cabinet. Incumbent president Stjepan Mesić, who had been elected in 2000 as the candidate of the Croatian People&#x27;s Party, was eligible to seek reelection to a second term and ran as an independent as the constitution prohibited the president from holding party membership while in office.

The elections resulted in the landslide re-election of Mesić for a second five-year term. They were also the first in which a woman, Croatian Democratic Union candidate Jadranka Kosor, took part in the runoff. The percentage of the vote received by Mesić in the second round – 66% – was the highest of any president until Zoran Milanović&#x27;s victory in 2025. Mesić had received an absolute majority of the votes cast within Croatia itself in the first round, but the votes of Croatian citizens living abroad forced a run-off by reducing Mesić&#x27;s overall percentage to just under the necessary 50% + 1 vote threshold needed to win in the first round. Voter turnout was 51% in both rounds.

Mesić was sworn in for a second term on 18 February 2005 by the Chief justice of the Constitutional Court.

==Background==
The Croatian State Elections Committee published a list of potential candidates on 15 December 2004. President Stjepan Mesić stood for re-election, and the governing HDZ nominated cabinet minister Jadranka Kosor. A total of thirteen candidates were accepted, each after having submitted 10,000 citizen signatures, an endorsement required by law.

==Results==
==Analysis==
Most polls before the first round predicted that incumbent president Stjepan Mesić would be reelected without a runoff, securing 50% + 1 vote. However, Jadranka Kosor benefited from the votes coming from the citizens living abroad, which narrowed the president&#x27;s victory by only a couple of points, but enough to secure a second round. The greatest surprise of the election was the independent candidate Boris Mikšić, a Croatian businessman and entrepreneur living in the United States. His campaign was heavily based on the message of a &#x27;Croatian dream&#x27;, similar to the American dream he said he achieved during his career in the US. On the night of the election, the first exit polls indicated president Mesić might secure a second term without the need of a runoff, while Kosor and Mikšić were shown battling for second place. As the first results started coming in it was evident that Mesić was not going to secure 50% + 1 vote and that a runoff is inevitable. As votes from the citizens living abroad were tallied, Kosor overtook Mikšić, placing second and qualifying for the second round. The campaign began immediately the next day and during the two-week-long campaign, three presidential debates were held, one on each of Croatia&#x27;s three major television networks. Despite most observers and post debate polls indicating Kosor won the debates, Mesić maintained his lead in the polls. As Election Day neared, the Kosor campaign exceeded all previous campaign spending records, trying to motivate the conservative base. On Election Day, as polls around the country closed at 7 pm, all television networks announced Mesić won a landslide victory based on the exit polls, which official results later confirmed. Kosor conceded and congratulated Mesić on his victory. After the elections, Boris Mikšić claimed the elections were fraud and that Mesić and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader made a deal of &quot;bringing&quot; Kosor in the second round. He claimed to have received 15,000 election ballots with serial numbers that were not evidented.

<text>Artūras Zuokas (born 21 February 1968) is a Lithuanian journalist, businessman and politician who served as the mayor of the capital of Lithuania, Vilnius, from 2000 to 2007 and again from 2011 to 2015, and as member of Lithuania&#x27;s unicameral parliament, Seimas, from 2008 to 2009 and from 2024. He was the leader of the Liberal and Centre Union, then YES - Homeland Revival and Perspective and the Lithuanian Freedom Union, and has been the chairman of Freedom and Justice since 3 February 2024.

Because of his numerous corruption scandals and eccentric behavior, Zuokas has become one of the most well-known and infamous politicians in Lithuanian politics. According to a poll organized by the national polling agency Vilmorus in 2007, Zuokas is seen as one of the three most corrupt Lithuanian politicians of all time, alongside Viktor Uspaskich and Algirdas Mykolas Brazauskas.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Zuokas was born in Kaunas on 21 February 1968. With his parents, he moved to Jonava at an early age, where he graduated from the first secondary school. From 1986 to 1988, he was conscripted to the Soviet Army and served in Murmansk.

After returning to Lithuania, he became involved in Sąjūdis and youth political activity, and campaigned for Lithuania&#x27;s independence. He was one of the delegates in the June 1989 national conference of the Lithuanian Komsomol in which the organization voted to break away from the All-Union Komsomol and establish the short-lived independent Young Communist League of Lithuania. He finished preparatory courses for journalism studies in Vilnius University in 1989 and then worked for Independent Television News as a war reporter in Iraq, where he taped the bombing of the Baghdad TV Tower during the First Gulf War.

Zuokas founded the news agency &quot;Baltijos naujienų agentūra&quot; in 1992, and worked in real estate and the advertising industry from 1992 to 1999. He invited the Benetton Group in Lithuania and led the negotiations for the establishment of the first McDonald&#x27;s restaurant in Lithuania. Since 1997, he has participated in politics.

===Political career===
Zuokas participated in Valdas Adamkus&#x27;s campaign during the 1997–98 presidential election as a member of its electoral committee, and joined the Liberal Union of Lithuania in 1999. He was an active supporter of the short-lived &quot;New Politics&quot; coalition between the Liberal Union and the New Union (Social Liberals), led by Artūras Paulauskas, until the coalition dissolved in 2001 and the New Union formed a coalition with the Social Democratic Party instead. 

In 2000, he was elected Mayor of Vilnius. At 32 years old, he was the youngest mayor in the history of Vilnius. Zuokas held the position for two terms until 2007, when his party moved to the opposition in the city council. Before the municipal election of 2011, British actor Jeremy Irons expressed his support for Artūras Zuokas and invited people to vote for him in a short video about his experience in Vilnius. In 2011, he was elected mayor for a third term, and remained in the position until 2015. Since then, after the establishment of direct mayoral elections in Lithuania, he has participated in every single mayoral election in Vilnius.

In 2003, after the merger of the Liberal Union, the Modern Christian-Democratic Union and the Lithuanian Centre Union, Zuokas was elected as the first chairman of the new Liberal and Centre Union. He led the party to success in the 2004 parliamentary election, where it won 18 seats - however, he resigned from his seat in order to remain as Mayor of Vilnius. It entered into a coalition led by the Homeland Union after the elections in 2008. Zuokas remained chairman of the party until 2009, when he was embroiled in a corruption scandal regarding the organization of European Capital of Culture activities in Vilnius in 2009. He allowed his favorite Gintautas Babravičius to succeed him in the post.

In 2011, claiming to have been disappointed by existing Lithuanian parties, he left the Liberal and Centre Union and established YES - Homeland Revival and Perspective, which he stated would follow the ideology of &quot;responsible liberalism&quot;. The party proved ineffective and failed to win a single seat in the 2012 parliamentary election. In 2014, his party merged back into the Liberal and Centre Union and formed the Lithuanian Freedom Union, which he also became the chairman of.

Zuokas ran for Mayor of Vilnius in the first direct mayoral election in 2015, but failed to get to the second round. In 2019, he challenged Mayor Remigijus Šimašius, representing the Liberal Movement, but was defeated in the second round and Šimašius was elected for a second term. Similarly, in 2023, he got to the second round of the Vilnius mayoral election with Valdas Benkunskas, the vice-mayor of Vilnius who represented the Homeland Union - but he was defeated with 47.27% of the vote.

Ahead of the 2020 parliamentary election, the Freedom Union merged with Order and Justice and the political movement &quot;Forward, Lithuania!&quot; led by Artūras Paulauskas, creating Freedom and Justice. On 3 February 2024, Zuokas was elected as its chairman after its previous leader, Remigijus Žemaitaitis, was expelled from the party due to his antisemitic comments. He endorsed Ignas Vėgėlė in the 2024 Lithuanian presidential election.

==Controversies==
===&quot;Subscriber&quot; (&quot;Abonentas&quot;) scandal===
An investigation into the &quot;dark accounting&quot; of the Vilnius public utilities company Rubicon Group revealed that the company regularly sent large premiums to an anonymous &quot;subscriber&quot; (Lithuanian: &quot;abonentas&quot;). Using money received from the company, the &quot;subscriber&quot; allegedly attempted to bribe member of the Liberal Union Vilmantas Drėma to vote in favor of Zuokas, and also threatened the politician that he may be found &quot;swimming in the Neris with an engorged belly&quot; if he refused. The Seimas, and later the courts, confirmed that the &quot;subscriber&quot; was Zuokas himself.

Zuokas accused Kęstutis Masiulis of defamation, and claimed in the accusation that Masiulis came up with the nickname &quot;subscriber&quot;, which the media began to identify with Zuokas. On 30 June 2006, the Vilnius district court dismissed Zuokas&#x27; case. On 20 March 2008, Zuokas was fined 12,500 litas for attempting to bribe a city council member, and the verdict was upheld by the Supreme Court after an appeal.

===Alleged street tile theft===
During the reconstruction of Gediminas Avenue from 2002 to 2009, 9 thousand square meters (of a total of 16 thousand replaced) of old basalt tiles were reported to have disappeared. Zuokas accused the former vice-mayor of Vilnius, Stanislovas Šriūbėnas, of poorly managing the reconstruction of the avenue. However, tiles identified as &quot;similar&quot; to old Gediminas Avenue tiles were later discovered in the yard of Zuokas&#x27; house as well as at his neighbours, by the &quot;Keturios sostinės&quot; inn in Vievis and in the yard of businessman Kęstutis Kutkauskas.

===Vilnius 2009 European Capital of Culture scandal===
Vilnius was designated as European Capital of Culture in 2009, and Zuokas, as a member of the Vilnius City Council, was appointed as the chairman of the committee tasked to prepare the year&#x27;s cultural events. Their final cost was nearly 300 million LTL, higher than any other European Capital of Culture to date. Zuokas&#x27; management of the committee was characterized by lack of transparency, inflated expenses and contract prices, and several members of the city council called for his removal.

===Divorce and alleged art theft===
In 2019, while clearing the family&#x27;s house while in the process of divorcing her husband, Zuokas&#x27; wife Agnė discovered 100 boxes of art supposedly by the avantgarde filmmaker Jonas Mekas held in Zuokas&#x27; home. During his second term as Mayor of Vilnius, the city founded the Jonas Mekas Visual Arts Centre and purchased a collection of art by the Fluxus collective, which Mekas belonged to. An investigation was held on whether the art was stolen, however, the arts centre reported that the art in Zuokas&#x27; home belonged to the politician.

==Eccentricities==
===Republic of Užupis===
Zuokas lives in Užupis, a neighbourhood in Vilnius known for its bohemian and laissez-faire atmosphere, which has been compared to Montmartre in Paris and to Freetown Christiania in Copenhagen. On 1 April 1997, the district declared independence, calling itself the Republic of Užupis, and adopted a flag, constitution, an anthem, and a self-declared president - Romas Lileikis, a poet, a musician, and a film director. 

Zuokas was one of the initiators of the independence declaration. He selected 1 April as its day of independence and designed its national symbol.

===2011 anti-illegal parking ad===
In August 2011, Zuokas raised attention to illegal parking in bike lanes by staging the destruction of an illegally parked car with a BTR-60 armoured personnel carrier in a bike lane running along Gediminas Avenue in Vilnius. The stunt was performed in cooperation with a bucket-list show aired on Swedish TV6, and the hosts Erik Ekstrand and Mackan Edlund sat in the back of the armored vehicle. Later that year he was awarded an Ig Nobel Peace Prize for &quot;demonstrating that the problem of illegally parked luxury cars can be solved by running over them with a tank&quot;.

This ad became one of Zuokas&#x27; most remembered stunts and brought attention to him outside Lithuania. In 2023, Zuokas claimed that he intends to sue Netflix after the airing of the &quot;Nobody Hits Like Netflix&quot; ad, in which Arnold Schwarzenegger runs over a car with a tank, claiming the idea was stolen from him.

===Proposal to purchase a Greek island===
In 2011, Zuokas proposed to purchase the island of Oxeia, owned by Greece, and turn it into a resort and investment zone. He proposed to name the island Dausuva, referring to the geopolitical concept of a &quot;reserve Lithuania&quot; created by interwar geographer and political thinker Kazys Pakštas. The idea was not developed further, and in April 2012, Oxeia was bought by Qatar Holdings.

===Personal celebrity DNA collection===
In 2023, Zuokas revealed that he has been collecting DNA samples of Lithuanian and worldwide celebrities for two decades - his collection includes samples of President of Lithuania Valdas Adamkus, John Malkovich, Daniel Libeskind, Steven Tyler, Violeta Urmana, Antanas Sutkus, Antanas Mockus and the Dalai Lama. He claimed that his collection would be used to clone said persons in the event of a global catastrophe.

==Awards and honors==
Zuokas is the recipient of numerous international and national awards and honors. He was decorated by President Jacques Chirac of France in 2001 with the National Order of Merit, and by President Vaira Vike-Freiberga of Latvia for his contribution to the betterment of bilateral relations.

He was twice elected vice-president of the Organization of World Heritage Cities. The Junior Chamber International recognized Zuokas for his administrative achievements by naming him one of the &quot;Ten Outstanding Young Persons in the World&quot; in 2002. The U.S. Baltic Foundation honored his achievements in 2003 and the Balzekas Museum in Chicago, Illinois named him &quot;Man of the Year&quot;. Local awards have included &quot;Friend of Architects&quot;. He is a three-time recipient of the popular Vilnius &quot;Iron Wolf&quot; award.

In 2003, Zuokas was bestowed with an honorary degree from the Gediminas Technical University.

<text>Sir Derek Harold Richard Barton (8 September 1918 – 16 March 1998) was an English organic chemist and Nobel Prize laureate for 1969.

==Education and early life==
Barton was born in Gravesend, Kent, to William Thomas and Maude Henrietta Barton (&quot;née&quot; Lukes).

He attended Gravesend Grammar School (1926–29), The King&#x27;s School, Rochester (1929–32), Tonbridge School (1932–35) and Medway Technical College (1937–39). In 1938 he entered Imperial College London, where he graduated in 1940 and obtained his PhD degree in Organic Chemistry in 1942.

==Career and research==
From 1942 to 1944 Barton was a government research chemist, then from 1944 to 1945 he worked for Albright and Wilson in Birmingham. He then became Assistant Lecturer in the Department of Chemistry of Imperial College, and from 1946 to 1949 he was ICI Research Fellow.

During 1949 and 1950 he was visiting lecturer in natural products chemistry at Harvard University, and was then appointed reader in organic chemistry and, in 1953, professor at Birkbeck College. In 1955 he became Regius Professor of Chemistry at the University of Glasgow, in 1957 he was appointed professor of organic chemistry at Imperial College, London. In 1950, Barton showed that organic molecules could be assigned a preferred conformation based upon results accumulated by chemical physicists, in particular by Odd Hassel. Using this new technique of conformational analysis, he later determined the geometry of many other natural product molecules.

In 1969, Barton shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Odd Hassel for “contributions to the development of the concept of conformation and its application in chemistry.&quot;

In 1958 Barton was appointed Arthur D. Little Visiting Professor of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and in 1959 Karl Folkers Visiting Professor of at the Universities of Illinois and Wisconsin. The same year he was elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1949 he was the first recipient of the Corday-Morgan Medal and Prize awarded by the Royal Society of Chemistry. In 1954 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and the International Academy of Science, Munich as well as, in 1956, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh; in 1965 he was appointed member of the Council for Scientific Policy. He was knighted in 1972, becoming formally styled Sir Derek in Britain. In 1978 he became Director of the Institut de Chimie des Substances Naturelles (ICSN - Gif Sur-Yvette) in France.

In 1977, on the occasion of the centenary of the Royal Institute of Chemistry, the British Post Office honoured him, and 5 other Nobel Prize-winning British chemists, with a series of four postage stamps featuring aspects of their discoveries.

He moved to the United States in 1986 (specifically Texas) and became distinguished professor at Texas A&amp;M University and held this position for 12 years until his death.

In 1996, Barton published a comprehensive volume of his works, entitled &quot;Reason and Imagination: Reflections on Research in Organic Chemistry.&quot;

As well as for his work on conformation, his name is remembered in a number of reactions in organic chemistry such as the Barton reaction, the Barton decarboxylation, and the Barton-McCombie deoxygenation.

The newly built Barton Science Centre at Tonbridge School in Kent, where he was educated for 4 years, completed in 2019, is named after him.

== Honours and awards==
Barton was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1954.
In 1966 he was elected a Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. He was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1970 and the American Philosophical Society in 1978.
* - Knight Bachelor (1972)
* - Légion d&#x27;honneur (1972)

==Personal life==
Sir Derek married three times: Jeanne Kate Wilkins (on 20 December 1944); Christiane Cognet (died 1992) (in 1969); and Judith Von-Leuenberger Cobb (1939-2012) (in 1993). He had a son by his first marriage.

<text>Corporal Edward Dwyer, VC (25 November 1895 – 3 September 1916) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Dwyer was born in Fulham, London, on 25 November 1895.

==First World War==
Dwyer was 19 years old, and a private in the 1st Battalion, East Surrey Regiment, British Army during the First World War, when he was awarded the VC for his actions on 20 April 1915 at Hill 60 in Belgium.

Dwyer was also awarded the Cross of St. George by Russia. He later achieved the rank of corporal. He was killed in action at Guillemont, France on 3 September 1916. His grave is located at Flatiron Copse Military Cemetery, France, which is 4 miles east of Albert (Plot III, Row J, Grave 3).

Apart from Jack Cornwell of the Royal Navy, Dwyer was the youngest VC recipient of the First World War.

His VC is displayed at the Princess of Wales&#x27;s Royal Regiment (Queens and Royal Hampshires) Museum located in Dover Castle, Kent.

==Recording==
In 1916, Dwyer made an audio recording for the Regal record label in which he described taking part in the Retreat from Mons in the early days of the war. The monologue describes life at the front, pay and rations, and includes a sample of one of the songs sung by soldiers at the time. Both sides of the Regal disc (each lasting about 3 minutes) made for the British enlistment services are available on the archive audio collections &quot;Oh! It&#x27;s a Lovely War (Vol 1)&quot; and &quot;Artists Rifles&quot; on CD41, which along with the Dwyer sides includes popular and patriotic songs, marches and descriptive sketch records. Dwyer&#x27;s recording appears to be the only one made by a serving British soldier during the Great War, and as such is unique. Part of the recording was used in the 2003 documentary &quot;The First World War&quot;.

<doc id="1227149" wikidata="Q4749911" url="?curid=1227149" title="An Englishman Abroad">
<text>An Englishman Abroad is a 1983 BBC television drama film based on the true story of a chance meeting of actress Coral Browne with Guy Burgess, a member of the Cambridge spy ring who spied for the Soviet Union while an officer at MI6. The production was written by Alan Bennett and directed by John Schlesinger. Browne stars as herself.

==Plot==
The film is set in Moscow in 1958, after Burgess had defected to the Soviet Union in 1951 with Donald Maclean when it became apparent that Maclean was about to be investigated by British intelligence. Burgess barges into Browne&#x27;s dressing room during the interval of a touring Shakespeare Memorial Theatre production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, in which she portrayed Gertrude, and charms her. Later on she is invited to his Moscow flat, finding it with some difficulty, to measure him for a suit that he would like ordered from his London tailor. On returning to London, she visits several high-class gentlemen&#x27;s outfitters to purchase his requirements.

== Film cast ==
* Alan Bates as Guy Burgess
* Coral Browne as herself
* Charles Gray as &#x27;Charles&#x27; playing Claudius
* Harold Innocent as Rosencrantz
* Vernon Dobtcheff as Guildenstern
* Czeslaw Grocholski as general
* Matthew Sim as boy
* Mark Wing-Davey as Hamlet
* Faina Zinova as hotel receptionist
* Douglas Reith as Toby
* Peter Chelsom as Giles
* Judy Gridley as Tessa
* Bibs Ekkel as scarf man
* Alexei Jawdokimov as Tolya
* Molly Veness as Mrs Burgess
* Denys Hawthorne as tailor
* Roger Hammond as shoe shop assistant
* Charles Lamb as George
* Trevor Baxter as pyjama shop manager
Charles Gray&#x27;s character was simply named &#x27;Charles&#x27; but in the real events on which the play is based, his character would have been the actor Mark Dignam. During the film, Burgess refers to one of the actors in the version of &#x27;Hamlet&#x27; he&#x27;s just seen, playing the part of Laertes. &quot;I like the look of Laertes. He goes rather well in to tights&quot; says Burgess. &quot;That&#x27;s what he thinks&quot; replies Browne, to which Burgess responds: &quot;Looks like he put a couple of King Edward&#x27;s down there&quot;. The actor they were discussing would have been Edward Woodward in the Moscow production. Michael Redgrave, Dorothy Tutin, Julian Glover, Anthony Nicholls, Eileen Atkins, Ian Holm and Edward de Souza were all members of the Shakespearean troupe involved with this tour of Russia, but they play no part in Bennett&#x27;s storyline.

==Production==
Rather than film in the Soviet Union, Schlesinger used several locations in Scotland. The Caird Hall and Whitehall Theatre in Dundee stood in for the Moscow theatre, and the grand marble staircase of Glasgow City Chambers played the part of the British Embassy. Additional filming was done at Glasgow&#x27;s St. Andrew&#x27;s Suspension Bridge (&quot;luckily, in a snowstorm&quot; Bennett later wrote) and the Moss Heights flats in Cardonald, which represented Burgess&#x27; Moscow apartment.

===Writing===
Several plot changes were made from the true story told by Browne to Bennett. Burgess in fact threw up in the dressing room of Michael Redgrave, who asked for Browne&#x27;s help. Redgrave documented the incident in his autobiography without mentioning Browne&#x27;s involvement with the incident. Browne addressed some press speculation that she had in fact plagiarized Redgrave&#x27;s story in various interviews to promote the film&#x27;s first broadcast, explaining Bennett&#x27;s dramatic changes. The play also contained scenes in Moscow&#x27;s British Embassy and in London shops where Browne encountered resistance to helping Burgess, none of which happened in reality.

Bennett gives the date of Browne&#x27;s meeting with Burgess as 1958 in the introduction to his &quot;Single Spies&quot;, which contains the text of &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot; in the stage play version and the text of &quot;A Question of Attribution&quot; about Anthony Blunt.

The play was also adapted for radio on the BBC World Service in 1994 starring Michael Gambon as Burgess and Penelope Wilton as Coral Browne. It was subsequently re-broadcast on BBC Radio 7 and BBC Radio 4 Extra, most recently in 2013 as part of BBC Radio 4 Extra&#x27;s &quot;Cambridge Spies&quot; season.

==Reception==
Both Browne and Bates were winners of the BAFTA awards for acting for their roles in the production. The film won the British Academy Television Award for Best Single Drama.

On the BFI TV 100, a list compiled in 2000 by the British Film Institute (BFI), chosen by a poll of industry professionals, to determine what were the greatest British television programmes of any genre ever to have been screened, &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot; was listed at number 30.

The U.S. film critic Pauline Kael wrote in 1985 that &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot; &quot;is probably the finest hour of television I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

<doc id="1227154" wikidata="Q5533994" url="?curid=1227154" title="Geodetic airframe">
<text>A geodetic airframe is a type of construction for the airframes of aircraft developed by British aeronautical engineer Barnes Wallis in the 1930s (who sometimes spelt it &quot;geodesic&quot;). Earlier, it was used by Prof. Schütte for the Schütte Lanz Airship SL 1 in 1909. It makes use of a space frame formed from a spirally crossing basket-weave of load-bearing members. The principle is that two geodesic arcs can be drawn to intersect on a curving surface (the fuselage) in a manner that the torsional load on each cancels out that on the other.

==Early examples==
The &quot;diagonal rider&quot; structural element was used by Joshua Humphreys in the first US Navy sail frigates in 1794. Diagonal riders are viewable in the interior hull structure of the preserved USS &quot;Constitution&quot; on display in Boston Harbor. The structure was a pioneering example of placing &quot;non-orthogonal&quot; structural components within an otherwise conventional structure for its time. The &quot;diagonal riders&quot; were included in these American naval vessels&#x27; construction as one of five elements to reduce the problem of hogging in the ship&#x27;s hull, and did not make up the bulk of the vessel&#x27;s structure, they do not constitute a completely &quot;geodetic&quot; space frame.

Calling any diagonal wood brace (as used on gates, buildings, ships or other structures with cantilevered or diagonal loads) an example of geodesic design is a misnomer. In a geodetic structure, the strength and structural integrity, and indeed the shape, come from the diagonal &quot;braces&quot; - the structure does not need the &quot;bits in between&quot; for part of its strength (implicit in the name space frame) as does a more conventional wooden structure.

==Aeroplanes==
The earliest-known use of a geodetic airframe design for any aircraft was for the pre-World War I Schütte-Lanz SL1 rigid airship&#x27;s envelope structure] of 1911, with the airship capable of up to a 38.3 km/h (23.8 mph) top airspeed.

The Latécoère 6 was a French four-engined biplane bomber of the early 1920s. It was of advanced all-metal construction and probably the first aeroplane to use geodetic construction. Only one was built.

Barnes Wallis, inspired by his earlier experience with light alloy structures and the use of geodesically-arranged wiring to distribute the lifting loads of the gasbags in the design of the &quot;R100&quot; airship, evolved the geodetic construction method (although it is commonly stated, there was no geodetic &quot;structure&quot; in &quot;R100&quot;). Wallis used the term &quot;geodetic&quot; to apply to the airframe; it is referred to as &quot;Vickers-Wallis construction&quot; in some early company documents. &quot;Geodesic&quot; is used in the United States for aircraft structures.

The system was later used by Wallis&#x27;s employer, Vickers-Armstrongs in a series of bomber aircraft, the Wellesley, Wellington, Warwick and Windsor. In these aircraft, the fuselage and wing were built up from duralumin alloy channel-beams that were formed into a large framework. Wooden battens were screwed onto the metal, to which the doped linen skin of the aircraft was fixed. The Windsor had a woven metal skin.

The metal lattice-work gave a light and very strong structure. The benefit of the geodetic construction was larger internal volume for a given streamlined shape. Flight magazine described a geodetic frame as sheet metal covering in which diamond shaped holes have been cut leaving behind the geodetic strips. The benefit was offset by having to construct the fuselage as a complete assembly unlike aircraft using stressed-skin construction which could be built in sections. In addition, fabric covering on the geodetic frame was not suitable for higher flying aircraft that had to be pressurised. The difficulty of providing a pressurised compartment in a geodetic frame was a challenge during the design of the high altitude Wellington Mk. V. The pressure cabin, which expanded and contracted independently of the rest of the airframe, had to be attached at the nodal points of the structure.

Geodetic wing and fin structures, taken from the Wellington, were used on the post-war Vickers VC.1 Viking, but with a metal stressed-skin fuselage. Later production Vikings were completely stressed-skin construction marking the end of geodetic construction at Vickers.

<doc id="1227155" wikidata="Q4060688" url="?curid=1227155" title="Sort-merge join">
<text>The sort-merge join (also known as merge join) is a join algorithm and is used in the implementation of a relational database management system.

The basic problem of a join algorithm is to find, for each distinct value of the join attribute, the set of tuples in each relation which display that value. The key idea of the sort-merge algorithm is to first sort the relations by the join attribute, so that interleaved linear scans will encounter these sets at the same time.

In practice, the most expensive part of performing a sort-merge join is arranging for both inputs to the algorithm to be presented in sorted order. This can be achieved via an explicit sort operation (often an external sort), or by taking advantage of a pre-existing ordering in one or both of the join relations. The latter condition, called interesting order, can occur because an input to the join might be produced by an index scan of a tree-based index, another merge join, or some other plan operator that happens to produce output sorted on an appropriate key. Interesting orders need not be serendipitous: the optimizer may seek out this possibility and choose a plan that is suboptimal for a specific preceding operation if it yields an interesting order that one or more downstream nodes can exploit.

== Complexity ==
Let formula_1 and formula_2 be relations where formula_3. formula_1 fits in formula_5 pages memory and formula_2 fits in formula_7 pages memory. In the worst case, a sort-merge join will run in formula_8 I/O operations. In the case that formula_1 and formula_2 are not ordered the worst case time cost will contain additional terms of sorting time: formula_11, which equals formula_12 (as linearithmic terms outweigh the linear terms, see Big O notation – Orders of common functions).

==Pseudocode==
For simplicity, the algorithm is described in the case of an inner join of two relations &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;. Generalization to other join types is straightforward. The output of the algorithm will contain only rows contained in the &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; relation and duplicates form a Cartesian product.
function Sort-Merge Join(left: Relation, right: Relation, comparator: Comparator) {
 result = new Relation()
 // Ensure that at least one element is present
 if (!left.hasNext() || !right.hasNext()) {
 return result
 
 // Sort left and right relation with comparator
 left.sort(comparator)
 right.sort(comparator)
 // Start Merge Join algorithm
 leftRow = left.next()
 rightRow = right.next()
 outerForeverLoop:
 while (true) {
 while (comparator.compare(leftRow, rightRow) != 0) {
 if (comparator.compare(leftRow, rightRow) &lt; 0) {
 // Left row is less than right row
 if (left.hasNext()) {
 // Advance to next left row
 leftRow = left.next()
 } else {
 break outerForeverLoop
 } else {
 // Left row is greater than right row
 if (right.hasNext()) {
 // Advance to next right row
 rightRow = right.next()
 } else {
 break outerForeverLoop
 }
 
 // Mark position of left row and keep copy of current left row
 left.mark()
 markedLeftRow = leftRow
 while (true) {
 while (comparator.compare(leftRow, rightRow) == 0) {
 // Left row and right row are equal
 // Add rows to result
 result = add(leftRow, rightRow)
 // Advance to next left row
 leftRow = left.next()
 // Check if left row exists
 if (!leftRow) {
 // Continue with inner forever loop
 break
 }
 if (right.hasNext()) {
 // Advance to next right row
 rightRow = right.next()
 } else {
 break outerForeverLoop
 
 if (comparator.compare(markedLeftRow, rightRow) == 0) {
 // Restore left to stored mark
 left.restoreMark()
 leftRow = markedLeftRow
 } else {
 // Check if left row exists
 if (!leftRow) {
 break outerForeverLoop
 } else {
 // Continue with outer forever loop
 break
 }
 }
 return result


Since the comparison logic is not the central aspect of this algorithm, it is hidden behind a generic comparator and can also consist of several comparison criteria (e.g. multiple columns). The compare function should return if a row is &quot;less(-1)&quot;, &quot;equal(0)&quot; or &quot;bigger(1)&quot; than another row:
function compare(leftRow: RelationRow, rightRow: RelationRow): number {
 // Return -1 if leftRow is less than rightRow
 // Return 0 if leftRow is equal to rightRow
 // Return 1 if leftRow is greater than rightRow


Note that a relation in terms of this pseudocode supports some basic operations:
interface Relation {
 // Returns true if relation has a next row (otherwise false)
 hasNext(): boolean
 // Returns the next row of the relation (if any)
 next(): RelationRow
 // Sorts the relation with the given comparator
 sort(comparator: Comparator): void
 // Marks the current row index
 mark(): void
 // Restores the current row index to the marked row index
 restoreMark(): void


==Simple C# implementation==
Note that this implementation assumes the join attributes are unique, i.e., there is no need to output multiple tuples for a given value of the key.

public class MergeJoin
 // Assume that left and right are already sorted
 public static Relation Merge(Relation left, Relation right)
 Relation output = new Relation();
 while (!left.IsPastEnd &amp;&amp; !right.IsPastEnd)
 if (left.Key == right.Key)
 output.Add(left.Key);
 left.Advance();
 right.Advance();
 else if (left.Key &lt; right.Key)
 left.Advance();
 else // if (left.Key &gt; right.Key)
 right.Advance();
 return output;
}
public class Relation
 private const int ENDPOS = -1;
 private List&lt;int&gt; list;
 private int position = 0;

 public Relation()
 this.list = new List&lt;int&gt;();

 public Relation(List&lt;int&gt; list)
 this.list = list;

 public int Position =&gt; position;

 public int Key =&gt; list[position];

 public bool IsPastEnd =&gt; position == ENDPOS;

 public bool Advance()
 if (position == list.Count - 1 || position == ENDPOS)
 position = ENDPOS;
 return false;
 position++;
 return true;

 public void Add(int key)
 list.Add(key);

 public void Print()
 foreach (int key in list)
 Console.WriteLine(key);
}

<text>Romer Leslie &quot;Les&quot; Brownlee (July 11, 1939 – May 19, 2022) served as the Under Secretary of the Army from November 2001 to December 2004 and as Acting United States Secretary of the Army from 17 November 2004 until his resignation effective 19 November 2004, staying at the Undersecretary&#x27;s office. 

==Military service==
Brownlee was a retired Army colonel. He was commissioned in 1962 as a lieutenant in the infantry through the Army Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps program at the University of Wyoming. He is a distinguished honor graduate of the U.S. Army Ranger Course, an honor graduate of both the Infantry Officer Advanced Course and the Command and General Staff College, and a graduate of the Army&#x27;s airborne course as well as the Army War College. Brownlee served two tours in Vietnam. During the last two and a half years of a four-and-a-half-year tour in the Pentagon, before retiring in 1984, he was military executive to Under Secretary of the Army James Ambrose.

His military decorations include the Silver Star with oak leaf cluster, the Bronze Star with two oak leaf clusters, and the Purple Heart. He holds a master&#x27;s degree in business administration from the University of Alabama.

==Career==
Brownlee became the 27th Under Secretary of the Army on 14 November 2001, following his nomination by President George W. Bush and confirmation by the United States Senate. From 10 May 2003 until 19 November 2004, he served as the Acting Secretary of the Army. As Under Secretary, Brownlee assisted the secretary in fulfilling statutory responsibilities for recruiting, organizing, supplying, equipping, training and mobilizing the United States Army and managing its $98.5 billion annual budget and more than 1.3 million active duty, Army National Guard, Army Reserve and civilian personnel.

Brownlee served on the Republican staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee beginning in January 1987, under both Senator Strom Thurmond and Senator John Warner. In March 1996, Brownlee was designated staff director of the Senate Committee on Armed Services by then chairman, Sen. Thurmond. In January 1999, he was designated staff director for then chairman, Sen. Warner, serving until November 2001 when he was confirmed as the Under Secretary of the Army.

From 1987 to 1996, he was a professional staff member responsible for Army and Marine Corps programs, special operations forces and drug interdiction policy and support. In addition, as deputy staff director, he was deeply involved in policies and programs relating to ballistic missile defense, strategic deterrence and naval strategy, shipbuilding and weapons programs.

==Family==
His son, John L. Brownlee is a former U.S. Attorney and prior candidate for the Republican nomination for Virginia Attorney General in 2009.

<text>Clifford Henry Dyment FRSL (20 January 1914 – 5 June 1971) was a British poet, literary critic, editor and journalist, best known for his poems on countryside topics. Born to Welsh parents, his mother was widowed when Dyment was four years old.

Born in Alfreton, Derbyshire, he spent his early childhood in Caerleon-on-Usk but was educated at Loughborough Grammar School in Leicestershire.

His poem &quot;The Son&quot; was occasioned by his discovery of a letter written by his conscripted father prior to his death in World War I. Another Dyment poem &quot;From Many a Mangled Truth a War is Won&quot; laments the tendency to invent pretexts and justifications for wars.

His first published collection was &quot;First Day&quot; (1935). During the latter part of the 1930s he was a literary figure in London. During World War II he was engaged to make films, working for the British government. His poem &quot;As a boy with a richness of needs I wandered&quot; was included by Philip Larkin in &quot;The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse&quot;, in 1971.

The poem &quot;Mouse&quot; was set to music by Betty Roe as part of her song cycle of &quot;Cat and Mouse&quot; (1987).

He received a Rockefeller Foundation Atlantic Award in 1950.

<text>Bo Yibo (; 17 February 1908 – 15 January 2007) was a Chinese politician. He was one of the most senior political figures in China during the 1980s and 1990s.

After joining the Chinese Communist Party when he was 17, he worked as a Communist Party organizer in his native city of Taiyuan, Shanxi. He was promoted to organize Communist guerrilla movements in northern China from a headquarters in Tianjin in 1928, but he was arrested and imprisoned by Kuomintang police in 1931. In 1936, with the tacit support of the Communist Party, Bo signed an anti-communist confession to secure his release. After his release Bo returned to Shanxi, rejoined the communists, and fought both the Kuomintang and the Japanese Empire in northern China until the Communists completed their unification of mainland China in 1949.

During Bo&#x27;s career he held successive posts as Communist China&#x27;s inaugural Minister of Finance, a member of the Communist Party&#x27;s Politburo, Vice-Premier, chairman of State Economic Commission, and vice-chairman of the party&#x27;s Central Advisory Commission. Bo was purged in 1966 by the Mao-backed Gang of Four, but he was brought back to power by Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s, after Mao&#x27;s death.

Bo was one of a select group of powerful veterans centred on Deng who were informally known as the &quot;Eight Immortals&quot; for their political longevity and for the vast influence they commanded during the 1980s and 1990s. After returning to power Bo supported economic liberalization, but was a moderate conservative politically. He initially supported both Hu Yaobang and the 1989 Tiananmen protesters, but he was eventually persuaded by hardliners to support both Hu&#x27;s dismissal in 1987 and the use of violence against protesters in 1989. Bo&#x27;s political involvement declined in the 1990s, but he used his influence to support both Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, and to promote the career of his son, Bo Xilai. He was the last remaining, and longest-lived, of the Eight Elders at the time of his death on 15 January 2007, just a little over a month short of his 99th birthday.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Bo Yibo was born in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi, which had become one of the poorest provinces in China by the early 20th century. His father was a craftsman who produced paper, but the family was so poor that they were forced to drown one of Bo&#x27;s newborn brothers because they were not wealthy enough to feed him. As a student, Bo was politically active, and once organized a protest against local land taxes. After graduating from high school in Taiyuan he attended Beijing University. While studying in Beijing he joined the Chinese Communist Party, four years after it was founded, in 1925.

Between 1925 and 1928 Bo held a number of minor, local positions as a Communist Party organizer in his home city of Taiyuan. After Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Kuomintang (KMT) began to violently suppress communists across China in 1927, Bo went into hiding and continued to organize Communist activities in rural areas. In 1928 Bo was sent by the Party to work underground as a Party organizer in Tianjin. He was arrested by the KMT three times; and, after the last time, in 1931, he spent several years in jail. While imprisoned in a correctional facility for military personnel in Beijing, Bo held a formal Party title and was responsible for spreading communism and organizing communist activities in the prison.

In late 1936 the Kuomintang warlord governing Bo&#x27;s home province of Shanxi, Yan Xishan, began to fear that the Japanese Empire was planning to invade China and formed a &quot;united front&quot; with the Communists to resist the Japanese in Shanxi. Yan then began attracting Shanxi natives across China to return and work for his government in various patriotic organizations. Yan arranged for Guo Yingyi, one of Bo&#x27;s former classmates and a former Communist then working for Yan, to travel to Beijing and secure Bo&#x27;s cooperation. Guo succeeded in persuading Bo to sign an anti-Communist confession to secure his release (with the tacit support of the Communist Party) and Bo returned to Shanxi to work with Yan Xishan in October 1936.

After returning to Shanxi, Yan placed Bo in charge of his &quot;Patriotic Sacrifice League&quot;, a local organization dedicated to organizing local resistance against Japanese invasion (which Bo organized as a front for promoting Communism). While working under Yan, Bo organized a &quot;dare-to-die&quot; corps of young volunteers and used his good relationship with Yan to persuade Yan to release communists that he was holding in prison. After the Japanese succeeded in taking northern Shanxi in 1937 and wiping out 90% of Yan&#x27;s military forces, Bo collected the survivors of his unit and conducted anti-Japanese guerrilla operations in southern Shanxi. When cooperation between Yan and the Communists ended in 1939, Bo led the survivors of his unit that were loyal to him and joined the Communist Eighth Route Army. Bo worked until the Japanese surrendered, in 1945, as a commander and political commissar in the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, fighting the Japanese in Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. He held a number of positions within the Party that recognized his administrative authority over much of these areas, and his prestige and influence grew throughout the period of the war. During the later stages of Chinese Civil War, from 1946 to 1949, Bo worked closely under Liu Shaoqi and General Nie Rongzhen.

=== People&#x27;s Republic of China ===
After the Communists won the civil war in 1949, Bo worked as China&#x27;s finance minister and chairman of the State Planning Commission. In 1956, the State Economic Commission was established under Bo in order to ease administrative burdens on the State Planning Commission. Bo served in a number of other similar positions, including vice premier (from 1957) under Zhou Enlai.

During the early 1950s he was Mao&#x27;s swimming partner.

He promoted moderate economic policies until he lost Mao&#x27;s favour in 1958.

In 1964, Bo and Li Fuchun traveled to southwest China to relay Mao&#x27;s selection of Panzhihua as the base for steel industry development during China&#x27;s Third Front construction.

Bo Yibo was a member of the CCP Politburo from the 8th National Party Congress in 1956 to the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, and again during the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, from 1979 until the 12th National Party Congress in 1982, when most of the elders retired from formal government positions.

===Persecution in the Cultural Revolution===
When the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, Bo was quickly identified as a &quot;capitalist roader&quot; and purged as one of the &quot;61 Renegades&quot;—Party members who had spent time in Kuomintang prisons. Jiang Qing produced the anti-communist statement that Bo had signed in 1937 with the Kuomintang in order to secure his release from prison, accusing him of &quot;betraying the party&quot; and making him an easy target for persecution. On 9 February 1967, Kang Sheng and his associates organized a rally in the Beijing Workers Stadium to criticize and &quot;struggle against&quot; Bo. Bo was paraded through the stadium with an iron plaque around his neck describing his &quot;crimes&quot;, but he was more defiant than most victims persecuted by Red Guards, and demanded (unsuccessfully) to speak in his own defence. While being paraded he shouted: &quot;I am not a traitor! I am a member of the Communist Party!&quot; Bo&#x27;s insistence that he was a loyal Communist Party member and that Mao had approved all of his actions created a chaotic atmosphere, and the rally was cancelled after three minutes.

After the rally Bo was transferred to a Beijing prison, where he was charged and convicted of many crimes, including being &quot;a backbone general of the Liu-Deng Black Headquarters&quot;, &quot;a core element of the Liu Shaoqi renegade clique&quot;, &quot;a big traitor&quot;, &quot;a counter-revolutionary revisionist element&quot;, and &quot;a Three Anti element&quot;. His captors claimed that many of these crimes should be punished by death. Because of Bo&#x27;s stubborn refusal to break down and &quot;confess&quot; to these charges, he was subjected to various means of torture throughout 1966 and 1967, during which he was routinely beaten and systematically deprived of food, water and sleep.

While imprisoned, Bo attempted to keep notes on the circumstances of his beatings by writing on scraps of newspaper, but his jailers confiscated these and used them as evidence of Bo&#x27;s recalcitrance. Eventually, his hands trembled so much that he could not hold chopsticks, and he had to scrape his rice off the floor of his cell. When he complained to his jailers that this was &quot;not the communist way&quot;, his jailers only beat him more severely. Bo&#x27;s children were jailed or sent to the countryside, and his wife died in captivity (she was reportedly beaten to death by Red Guards, but they claimed that she committed suicide). Bo Xiyong, Bo Xilai, and Bo Xicheng were imprisoned at the ages of sixteen, seventeen and seventeen (respectively), and Bo Xining was sent to the countryside at the age of fourteen. Bo remained in prison for over a decade.

===Career under Deng Xiaoping===
Three years after Mao died, in 1979, Deng Xiaoping led an effort to rehabilitate members of the Communist Party who had been persecuted during the Cultural Revolution, and Bo was released from prison and reinstated as a member of the Politburo, and to his former position of vice premier. He joined the ranks of a small group of other senior officials of Deng&#x27;s generation who Deng had returned to government known as the &quot;Eight Immortals&quot;. In 1982 he was promoted to the Central Advisory Commission, a formal group of Party elders with over forty years of political experience. During the 1980s the group clashed with a group of younger reformers within the Party led by Hu Yaobang.

Bo came to support economic reform after one of his trips in the 1980s to Boeing&#x27;s facilities in the United States. During his visit, Bo discovered that there were only two airplanes parked at the facility. He asked the Boeing executives whether there would be any planes left if the two that he saw were gone. The company&#x27;s executives answered that two was the exact number they wanted at this particular time, because their production was based on customer orders and anything more than necessary would be a waste of resources. After this visit to Boeing, Bo became much more critical of the Chinese practice of a planned economy, pointing out that excesses of production were in fact a waste of resources. Even for a planned economy, Bo believed that central planning should be based on market demand instead of on rigid Soviet-style planning undertaken without regard to market forces.

Bo was an important supporter of economic reform in the early 1980s, but eventually supported the efforts of other, more conservative, party elders to remove Hu from power in 1987. During the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 Bo initially supported moderate Party leaders who called to compromise with protesters, but was later persuaded to support Party hardliners who believed that the students were secretly being controlled by &quot;imperialists with ulterior motives&quot;. He ultimately supported the decision to use force to suppress the demonstrations.

After 1989 Bo intervened numerous times to support Deng&#x27;s efforts to restart economic (but not political) liberalization, and to prevent economic hardliners from dominating Party politics. Even after completely retiring during the 1990s, his status meant that he remained an influential figure who still pulled strings behind the scenes and could make or unmake party officials. He used his influence to support the rise of Jiang Zemin, who became the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in the 1989. Bo Yibo retired from politics after the Central Advisory Committee was abolished in October 1992 after the 14th Party Congress. In 1993 he co-authored a book on the early history of the Chinese Communist Party.

Bo closely supported the political career of his son, Bo Xilai, who was considered a member of the &quot;Crown Prince Party,&quot; though its members are only loosely affiliated by their background. Bo Xilai eventually rose to become China&#x27;s commerce minister; and, later, the Communist Party Committee Secretary of Chongqing, but his political career ended with the 2012 Wang Lijun scandal. The rest of Bo Yibo&#x27;s children obtained foreign residency. His daughter became an American citizen and resides in the U.S.

===Death===
Bo lived long enough to be the oldest member of the Communist Party in China by the end of his life. He died of an undisclosed illness on 15 January 2007. He was cremated and his remains were interred at Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery next to his wife Hu Ming. His daughter, who died twelve years later, was buried next to them.

<doc id="1227183" wikidata="Q4840811" url="?curid=1227183" title="Badge Man">
<text>The Badge Man is a figure that is purportedly present within the Mary Moorman photograph of the assassination of United States president John F. Kennedy in Dealey Plaza on November 22, 1963. Conspiracy theorists have suggested that this figure is a sniper firing a weapon at the president from the grassy knoll. Although a reputed muzzle flash obscures much of the detail, the Badge Man has been described as a person wearing a police uniform—the moniker itself derives from a bright spot on the chest, which is said to resemble a gleaming badge.

The Moorman photograph was taken a fraction of a second after the fatal bullet struck Kennedy&#x27;s head. It was analyzed by the House Select Committee on Assassinations, but no evidence of hidden figures was found. In 1983, Gary Mack—the curator of the Sixth Floor Museum—obtained a higher-quality copy of the photograph. Upon enhancement, Mack noted what he believed to be the Badge Man in the shadowed background. This alleged second gunman has appeared in several conspiracy theories concerning the assassination of President Kennedy.

Among photographic experts, the consensus is that the image lacks the resolution to determine whether or not the Badge Man is a human figure. The reputed Badge Man is not present in any other photographs of the assassination and was not seen by any witnesses. Former Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi criticized the Badge Man interpretation, and analyst Dale K. Myers has argued that it is not an actual person due to proportional discrepancies. It has been suggested that the figure is actually an optical distortion from a Coca-Cola bottle, or simply different background elements.

==Moorman photograph==
The 35th president of the United States, John F. Kennedy, was assassinated on November 22, 1963, while riding in a motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas. During the assassination, Dallas resident Mary Moorman took a series of photographs with her Polaroid camera. She captured images of the presidential limousine, several other close witnesses, including Abraham Zapruder filming, two Dallas police motorcycle escorts, and the &quot;grassy knoll&quot; beside the motorcade route. The Badge Man is reputedly visible in Moorman&#x27;s fifth and most famous photo of the area, taken almost exactly at the moment of the fatal shot. This photo has been calculated to have been captured between Zapruder film frames 315 and 316, less than one-sixth of a second after President Kennedy was shot in the head at frame 313.

In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, police officers and spectators ran to the grassy knoll, from where some witnesses believed the shots had originated, but no sniper was found. The Warren Commission concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald was the sole shooter, and that he had shot Kennedy from the Texas School Book Depository building. Conspiracy theorists speculate that there was an assassin behind the wooden picket fence on top of the grassy knoll. For her part, Moorman told Larry Sabato that she did not see anything out of the ordinary behind the fence and that she remained unconvinced that a second shooter was revealed in her photograph.

Moorman&#x27;s photograph was not included in the Warren Commission&#x27;s 1964 report or its supporting documents. Moorman stated that she had been invited to provide testimony to the Commission, but asked for a postponement after injuring her ankle, and was not contacted again. In the late 1970s, the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)—which concluded that there was a second assassin on the grassy knoll based on now discredited acoustic evidence—deemed the photo of interest to its investigation. 

With the unaided eye, the HSCA photographic evidence panel could find no figures in the shadowed background. The HSCA then sent the Moorman photo to the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) for enlargement, enhancement, and analysis. The RIT report found no evidence of human forms anywhere in the background, and the specific area behind the stockade fence was deemed to be so underexposed that it was impossible to glean any information from it. The HSCA concluded that if the Moorman photo &quot;did not contain images that might be construed to be a figure behind the fence, it would be a troubling lack of corroboration for the acoustical analysis&quot;. The examined photo was the original copy, which had greatly degraded by that point.

==Photograph enhancement==
===Gary Mack===

In 1983, Gary Mack obtained an UPI copy of the Mary Moorman photograph of higher quality than the degraded original. The curator of the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza (the former Texas School Book Depository), Mack was described by skeptic Vincent Bugliosi as one of the few respected Kennedy assassination conspiracy theorists. After noticing what he thought was a human face in the shadowed background, Mack contacted Jack White—a friend and darkroom technician—to study the photograph. Upon enhancement, they identified an individual wearing a uniform—possibly that of a Dallas police officer—standing behind the stockade fence, with his face obscured by a muzzle flash, but with a small bright object visible on his chest. They interpreted this to be a badge, hence &quot;Badge Man&quot;. 

Mack, White, and other conspiracy theorists have attempted to connect Badge Man with the claims of Gordon Arnold. When analyzing the photo, Mack initially considered whether the figure may in fact be Arnold, a soldier who claimed to be on the grassy knoll with a movie camera. Arnold—who first came forward in 1978—claimed that he had filmed the assassination and that a police officer had confiscated his film after the shooting. Some theorists claim that this officer was also the Badge Man. Arnold is not visible in any photographs taken of the area, which Bugliosi calls &quot;conclusive photographic proof that Arnold&#x27;s story was fabricated&quot;.

White continued experimenting with the Moorman photograph. In the mid-1980s, he produced a new colorized version, enhanced in contrast and brightness, which he claimed revealed the policeman figure in higher clarity. In 1988, White claimed that a man wearing a white shirt and possibly a hard hat is visible behind the Badge Man. He called him the &quot;Back Up Man&quot;. White has also argued that Arnold is visible to the anatomical right of Badge Man.

Many conspiracy theories claim that Kennedy was killed by several shooters positioned throughout Dealey Plaza. The Badge Man is often said to have fired the fatal head shot from the grassy knoll. The 1988 British documentary series &quot;The Men Who Killed Kennedy&quot;, which features White&#x27;s work, proposes that the Badge Man was Lucien Sarti, a French national and alleged contract killer. Other conspiracy theorists have suggested that the Badge Man is J. D. Tippit, a Dallas police officer who was killed by Oswald shortly after Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. Regarding these claims, Mack clarified his stance in 2006: &quot;I&#x27;ve never said that the Badge Man was the knoll assassin, but I have said it&#x27;s a possibility. That&#x27;s all.&quot;

===Skepticism===
In an attempt to validate the Badge Man, Mack had the photograph analyzed by third parties, including experts at the Itek Corporation, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The consensus is that the photograph lacks the resolution to determine whether the Badge Man is a human figure. Photographic expert Geoffrey Crawley concluded that the Badge Man was not a person but rather disparate background elements.

Bugliosi noted discrepancies with the Badge Man photograph. He argued that the man must have been unusually tall for his badge to be seen above the fence, and that his eyes are not near the hypothetical scope of his sniper rifle as would be expected. Bugliosi emphasized that Mack stated he has never confidently identified the presence of a weapon due to the alleged muzzle flash. Mack conceded that the Badge Man has not been identified in any other photographs of the assassination. Furthermore, the Badge Man was not seen by grassy knoll witness Lee Bowers or the nearby Zapruder, and no witness reported seeing a Dallas police officer near where the Badge Man allegedly stood.

Researcher and computer animator Dale Myers has argued that the measurements of the grassy knoll area require the alleged figure to have been in an impossible position to fire a weapon at the motorcade, saying &quot;if [the Badge Man were] truly a human being of average height and build, was located behind the fence line and elevated above the ground – an unreasonable and untenable firing position.&quot; He states that the retaining wall would have blocked the Badge Man&#x27;s bullet. Myers has proposed that the Badge Man is merely sunlight reflecting off of a glass bottle. A Coca-Cola bottle is visible in contemporaneous photos resting on a pergola wall near the Badge Man area.

<text>Francisco Jorge Stanley Albaitero (3 July 1942 – 7 June 1999), known by his stage name Paco Stanley, was a Mexican television entertainer who worked for Televisa and TV Azteca. He also participated directly, for a time, in political activities in his country, as he was a member of the PRI.

== Early years ==
He was born in Mexico City on July 3, 1942, son of Francisco Stanley Muñoz and Josefina Albaitero Vivanco; He was baptized on August 8 of the same year.

== Career ==
Stanley began his career in radio in 1969. From 1974, he appeared in television programs like XEW News. For this network, he hosted the show &quot;Sonrisas y sorpresas&quot;.

After years of being a sidekick to comedians such as Madaleno, in 1991 he was offered his own show on Televisa, &quot;¡Ándale!&quot;, with Arlette Garibay and Benito Castro. Later television work included &quot;Llévatelo&quot; and &quot;Pácatelas&quot; with Mario Bezares.

In 1998, he hosted the show &quot;Un poco de Paco en radio&quot; in its comic version.

He left Televisa and signed a contract in 1998 with rival network TV Azteca. On 15 December, he started his show &quot;Una tras otra&quot;, co-starring Jorge Gil and Mario Bezares. The show gained attention after Stanley&#x27;s assassination for his aggressive and often offensive sense of humor, especially towards Bezares. In 1999, he launched a nighttime show, titled &quot;¡Sí hay, y bien!&quot;.

Stanley also appeared in theatre, starring in a comic version of the play &quot;Don Juan Tenorio&quot;, which toured across Mexico.

== Personal life ==
Stanley&#x27;s first marriage was with María Solís, with whom he had only one son, Francisco. After several years, he married Patricia Pedroza, with whom he had two children, Leslie and Francisco Stanley Pedroza. However, in an extramarital relationship, Paco had a third son, Paul Stanley (Now host of the morning program &quot;Hoy&quot;).

== Death ==
On 7 June 1999, Paco Stanley, Mario Bezares and Jorge Gil left the TV Azteca studios after their morning show &quot;Una Tras Otra&quot; to eat in the El Charco de las Ranas restaurant in Periférico, Mexico City&#x27;s busy beltway. Prior to the shooting, witnesses reported seeing Bezares take a phone call before leaving the table to go to the restroom. While Stanley, Gil, and his driver were waiting outside the restaurant after the meal inside his black Lincoln Navigator, three individuals walked towards the car and started shooting, firing more than 20 rounds. Stanley was hit in the head with three shots, killing him instantly. The remaining shots wounded Gil and other bystanders.

Mexican TV networks Televisa and TV Azteca interrupted their programming to announce the news. That day, two news anchors from TV Azteca and the president of TV Azteca Ricardo Salinas Pliego blamed Mexico City&#x27;s mayor Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas for poor governance, due to the high crime rate in the city.

Mario Bezares and another of Stanley&#x27;s colleagues, Paola Durante, were arrested in connection with the murder and detained for over a year before being released. On 5 April 2011, Luis Alberto Salazar Vega was arrested and charged with Stanley&#x27;s assassination, based on the testimony of a former cellmate.

<doc id="1227197" wikidata="Q4040980" url="?curid=1227197" title="Solid Logic Technology">
<text>Solid Logic Technology (SLT) was IBM&#x27;s method for hybrid packaging of electronic circuitry introduced in 1964 with the IBM System/360 series of computers. It was also used in the 1130, announced in 1965. IBM chose to design custom hybrid circuits using discrete, flip chip-mounted, glass-encapsulated transistors and diodes, with silk-screened resistors on a ceramic substrate, forming an SLT module. The circuits were either encapsulated in plastic or covered with a metal lid. Several of these SLT modules (20 in the image on the right) were then mounted on a small multi-layer printed circuit board to make an SLT card. Each SLT card had a socket on one edge that plugged into pins on the computer&#x27;s backplane (the exact reverse of how most other companies&#x27; modules were mounted).

IBM considered monolithic integrated circuit technology too immature at the time. SLT was a revolutionary technology for 1964, with much higher circuit densities and improved reliability over earlier packaging techniques such as the Standard Modular System. It helped propel the IBM System/360 mainframe family to overwhelming success during the 1960s. SLT research produced ball chip assembly, wafer bumping, trimmed thick-film resistors, printed discrete functions, chip capacitors and one of the first volume uses of hybrid thick-film technology.

SLT replaced the earlier Standard Modular System, although some later SMS cards held SLT modules. SLT had several updates during its life, the last being the Monolithic System Technology (MST) which replaced the single transistors of SLT with small-scale integrated circuits that held four or five transistors. MST was used in the System/370, which began to replace the System/360 in 1970.

==Details==
SLT used silicon planar glass-encapsulated transistors and diodes.

SLT uses dual diode chips and individual transistor chips each approximately square. The chips are mounted on a square substrate with silk-screened resistors and printed connections. The whole is encapsulated to form a square module. Up to 36 modules are mounted on each card, though a few card types had just discrete components and no modules. Cards plug into boards which are connected to form gates which form frames.

SLT voltage levels, logic low to logic high, varied by circuit speed:

:High speed (5-10 ns) 0.9 to 3.0 V
:Medium speed (30 ns) 0.0 to 3.0 V
:Low speed (700 ns) 0.0 to 12.0 V

==Later developments==
The same basic packaging technology (both device and module) was also used for the devices that replaced SLT as IBM gradually transitioned to the use of monolithic integrated circuits:

*Solid Logic Dense (SLD) increased packaging density and circuit performance by mounting the discrete transistors and diodes on top of the substrate and the resistors on the bottom. SLD voltages were the same as SLT.
* Unit Logic Device (ULD) use flat-pack ceramic packages, much smaller than SLT&#x27;s metal cans. Each package contains a ceramic wafer with up to four silicon dies on top, each die implementing one transistor or two diodes; and thick-film resistors underneath. ULDs were used in the Launch Vehicle Digital Computer and Launch Vehicle Data Adapter of the Saturn V rocket.
*Advanced Solid Logic Technology (ASLT) increased packaging density and circuit performance by stacking two substrates in the same package. ASLT is based on the Emitter-follower-coupled-switch used with current-steering logic. ASLT voltage levels were : &gt; +235 mV is high, &lt; -239 mV is low.

*Monolithic System Technology (MST) increased packaging density and circuit performance by replacing discrete transistors and diodes with one to four monolithic integrated circuits (resistors now external from the package on the module). Each MST chip holds about five circuits and is the approximate equivalent of an SLT card. Circuits used NPN transistors. MST was first introduced in January 1968 and provided improved cost/performance for IBM&#x27;s System/370 product line of the 1970s.

<text>William Kenny VC (24 August 1880 – 10 January 1936) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Victoria Cross==
Kenny was 34 years old, and a Drummer in the 2nd Battalion, The Gordon Highlanders, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 23 October 1914 near Ypres, Belgium, Drummer Kenny rescued wounded men on five occasions under very heavy fire. Twice previously he had saved machine-guns by carrying them out of action, and on numerous occasions he conveyed urgent messages under very dangerous circumstances over fire-swept ground.

==Other honours==

In addition to the Victoria Cross, Kenny earned the rank of Drum-Major and was also awarded the following medals: Queen&#x27;s South Africa Medal with bars, King&#x27;s South Africa Medal with bars, 1914 Star with bar, British War Medal, Victory Medal with oak-leaf, Delhi Durbar Medal, and the Cross of St George (Russia).

On 20 March 1999 the grave of William Kenny received a new headstone in the Corps of Commissionaires plot at Brookwood Cemetery, arranged by The Gordon Highlanders London Association (Lt Col. M.H. Burge). Kenny was buried in 1936 but unfortunately the original marker was lost and until this stone was placed, Kenny was not otherwise commemorated.

His Victoria Cross and other medals are on displayed at the Gordon Highlanders Museum, Aberdeen, Scotland.

<text>The kip (; code: LAK; sign: ₭ or ₭N; ; officially: ເງີນກີບລາວ, lit. &quot;currency Lao kip&quot;) is the currency of Laos since 1955. Historically, one kip was divided into 100 &quot;att&quot; () which are no longer in regular use. The term derives from ກີບ &quot;kì:p&quot;, a Lao word meaning &quot;ingot.&quot;

== History ==
===French Indochina===

The piastre was the currency of French Indochina between 1885 and 1952.

===Free Lao Kip (1946)===
In 1945–1946, the Free Lao government in Vientiane issued a series of paper money in denominations of 10, 20, and 50 att and 10 kip before the French authorities took control of the region.

===Royal Kip (1955)===
The kip was reintroduced in 1955, replacing the French Indochinese piastre at par. The kip (also called a &quot;piastre&quot; in French) was sub-divided into 100 att (Lao: ອັດ) or &quot;cents&quot; (French: Centimes). It was pegged to the French franc at a rate of 10 francs per kip.

On 10 October 1958, the kip&#x27;s peg switched to the US dollar, and was officially devalued from ₭35 to ₭80 per US dollar: however, the official exchange rate did not reflect market conditions at the time, with the parallel rate reaching ₭600 per dollar by the end of 1963. Laos devalued the kip again on 1 January 1964, and adopted an official rate of ₭240 per dollar and a &quot;free market&quot; rate of about ₭505 per dollar: the free market rate then fell to ₭600 per dollar on 8 November 1971, with the official rate being abolished on 4 April 1972.

=== Pathet Lao Kip (1976) ===
The Pathet Lao introduced the &quot;liberation kip&quot; on 12 October 1968, for circulation in the areas that the group controlled. Banknotes for the liberation kip, which were printed in China, consisted of ₭1, ₭10, ₭20, ₭50, ₭100, ₭200 and ₭500.

According to the Pathet Lao&#x27;s media outlet &quot;Siang Pasason&quot;, one liberation kip was worth 6 royal kip on 20 August 1975, three days before the Pathet Lao entered Vientiane. Based on historic exchange rates provided by the International Monetary Fund, one US dollar in 1975 was worth 725 royal kip or 120.83 liberation kip.

In 1976, the new communist Laotian government replaced the royal kip with the liberation kip. The exchange rate was 20 royal kip per liberation kip. A currency confiscation was carried out, where individuals could exchange up to 100,000 royal kip for liberation kip, and businesses up to one million royal kip; they had to deposit the rest in state-owned banks.

=== Lao PDR Kip (1979) ===
On 16 December 1979, the former Pathet Lao &quot;liberation kip&quot; was replaced by the new Lao kip at a rate of 100 to 1.

== Coins ==
Royal Kip (1955)

Coins were issued in denominations of 10, 20 and 50 att or cents with French and Lao inscriptions. All were struck in aluminum and had a hole in the centre, like the Chinese cash coins. The only year of issue was 1952.

Pathet Lao Kip (1976)

=== Coins ===
Coins were again issued in Laos for the first time in 28 years in 1980 with denominations of 10, 20 and 50 att, with each being struck in aluminum and depicting the state emblem on the obverse and agricultural themes on the reverse. These were followed by commemorative 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 kip coins issued in 1985 for the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic. However, due to the economic toll of the Soviet collapse in 1991 and the persistence of chronic inflation, coins are rarely seen in circulation.
== Banknotes ==

In 1953, the Laos branch of the &quot;Institut d&#x27;Emission des États du Cambodge, du Laos et du Vietnam&quot; issued notes dual denominated in piastre and kip. At the same time, the two other branches had similar arrangements with the riel in Cambodia and the đồng in South Vietnam. There were notes for 1, 5, 10 and 100 kip/piastres.

In 1957, the government issued notes denominated solely in kip. The notes were for 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 kip printed by the Security Banknote Company, 100 kip printed by the Banque de France and a commemorative 500 kip printed by De La Rue. 1 and 5 kip notes printed by Bradbury &amp; Wilkinson, as well as 10 kip notes by De La Rue were introduced in 1962.

In 1963, 20, 50, 200 and 1000 kip notes were added, all printed by De La Rue. These were followed by 100, 500 and 5000 kip notes in 1974–75, again by De La Rue. 10 kip notes by Bradbury &amp; Wilkinson and 1000 kip notes by De La Rue were printed but not circulated.

=== Pathet Lao Kip (1976) ===
Banknotes issued in 1975 or before in Pathet Lao controlled areas, and were in denominations of 1, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 kip.

===Lao PDR Kip (1979)===
In 1979, banknotes were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 kip. 500 kip notes were added in 1988, followed by 1000 kip in 1992, 2000 and 5000 kip in 1997, 10,000 and 20,000 kip in 2002 and 50,000 kip on January 17, 2006 (although dated 2004). On November 15, 2010, a 100,000 kip banknote was issued to commemorate the 450th anniversary of the founding of the capital, Vientiane, and the 35th anniversary of the establishment of the Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic. Kaysone Phomvihane (1920–1992) is pictured on the obverse of the 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000, and 100,000 kip banknotes.

The Bank of Laos governor announced on January 25, 2012, that the Bank of Laos would issue 100,000 Kip banknotes as a regular issue on February 1, 2012 (but dated 2011) to encourage Lao people to use the national currency instead of U.S. dollars and Thai baht.
As of 2019, the ₭500 note is the smallest one commonly in circulation.

<text>Robert E. Hutchins (March 29, 1925 – May 17, 1945) was an American child actor who was a regular in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short subjects series from 1927 to 1933. A native of Tacoma, Washington, he was given the nickname of Wheezer after running around the studios on his first day so much that he began to wheeze.

==Early life==
Bobby Hutchins was born to James and Olga (Constance) Hutchins in Washington. His father was a native of Kentucky and his mother a native of Washington State.

==Career==
Wheezer appeared in 58 &quot;Our Gang&quot; films during his six years in the series. For much of his run, &quot;Wheezer&quot; was portrayed as the perennial tag-along little brother, put off by the older children but always eager to be part of the action.

Hutchins&#x27; first film in &quot;Our Gang&quot; was the 1927 short &quot;Baby Brother&quot; as the risky character Horatio. Hutchins&#x27; tenure in &quot;Our Gang&quot; took him through both the silent and early sound periods of the series. He appears as the main character of several of the films, including &quot;Bouncing Babies&quot;, &quot;Pups Is Pups&quot;, &quot;Big Ears&quot;, and &quot;Dogs Is Dogs&quot;. He left the series at the end of the 1932-33 film season after appearing in &quot;Mush and Milk&quot;; his only film work outside of &quot;Our Gang&quot; includes a handful of appearances in three outside features in 1932 and 1933. Hutchins was 8 when he left the series in 1933.

One of the enduring mysteries of the series is why Hutchins suddenly and drastically fell out of favour with creator/producer Hal Roach and/or chief writer/senior director/producer Robert F. McGowan: With the departure of all four regular members of the older &quot;gang&quot; in the series (Jackie Cooper, Allen Hoskins, Norman Chaney, and Mary Ann Jackson) at the end of the 1930-31 season, Hutchins, as hitherto leader of the younger, &quot;shadow&quot; gang (composed of him, Matthew Beard, and Dorothy DeBorba), seemed poised to become the star of the series, i.e., the gang&#x27;s on-screen leader. Indeed, although only three more shorts were produced in the remaining months of 1931, Hutchins was the lead in each, the second was very well received, and the third one, &quot;Dogs is Dogs&quot;, is regarded as one of the very best shorts of the entire series.

Thereafter, however, Hutchins&#x27;s role was greatly diminished. In 1932&#x27;s first short, &quot;Readin&#x27; and Writin&#x27;&quot;, recently hired Kendall &quot;Breezy Brisbane&quot; McComas took over as the gang&#x27;s ostensible on-screen leader. In the following episode, George McFarland made his debut as &quot;Spanky&quot;, enthralling Roach and McGowan so much that they took the unprecedented step of giving him star billing in a couple subsequent shorts that year. By comparison, Hutchins was now relegated to being a minor member of the gang, receiving very few lines and close-ups. When newcomer Dickie Moore, who was younger than Hutchins, took over as the gang&#x27;s leader at the start of the 1932–33 season, Hutchins did not appear in the first three episodes.

Other members of the &quot;Our Gang&quot; troupe remember very little about Hutchins. Jackie Cooper said, &quot;You&#x27;d go to play with Wheezer and his father would pull him away. Very competitive. I didn&#x27;t get a satisfactory answer from my mother or grandmother as to why, but he was to be left alone.&quot; Other cast members reported that Hutchins was abused by his parents to keep him from outgrowing &quot;Our Gang&quot;. Hutchins&#x27;s younger brother Dickie appeared in the short &quot;Forgotten Babies&quot;.

==After &quot;Our Gang&quot;==
After outgrowing the series, Hutchins and his family eventually moved back to Tacoma, where he entered public school. He joined the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1943 after graduating high school and enrolled in the Aviation Cadet Program with the goal of becoming a pilot.

==Death==
Hutchins was killed in a mid-air collision on May 17, 1945, while trying to land a North American AT-6D-NT Texan, serial number &quot;42-86536&quot;, of the 3026th Base Unit, when it struck an AT-6C-15-NT Texan, &quot;42-49068&quot;, of the same unit at Merced Army Air Field in Merced, California, later known as Castle Air Force Base, during a training exercise. The other pilot, Edward F. Hamel, survived. Hutchins&#x27;s mother, Olga Hagerson Hutchins, had been scheduled to travel to the airfield for his graduation from flying school, which would have occurred the week after he died.

==Legacy==
The American rock band Weezer adopted the name based on Hutchin&#x27;s character (albeit a different spelling), which was based on singer Rivers Cuomo&#x27;s nickname that his father gave him when he was a kid because &quot;[Wheezer] is the cool one.&quot;

<text>Clearstream or the Clearstream Group is the central securities depository arm of the Deutsche Börse Group. It provides settlement and custody as well as other related services for securities across all asset classes. Its subsidiary in Luxembourg, Clearstream Banking SA, is one of two world-leading International central securities depositories (ICSDs), the other one being Euroclear Bank. Both the main German national CSD, Clearstream Banking AG, and the national CSD of Luxembourg, LuxCSD, are also part of Clearstream. Clearstream Banking AG and Clearstream Banking SA are held via intermediate holding company Clearstream Holding AG.

As of 2017, Clearstream had around 2,500 customers in 110 countries.

==History==

Clearstream was formed in January 2000 through the merger of Cedel and Deutsche Börse Clearing. Initially a 50-50 joint venture between Cedel International and Deutsche Börse, it became a fully-owned subsidiary of the latter on .

In July 2010, Clearstream founded LuxCSD together with the Central Bank of Luxembourg (BCL), to act as a CSD for Luxembourg.

In December 2010, Clearstream co-founded REGIS-TR, a joint venture with the Spanish Central Securities Depository Iberclear, to act as a trade repository for derivatives transactions, helping participants meet their regulatory reporting obligations brought about by the introduction of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR).

In 2021, Clearstream acquired full ownership of LuxCSD by buying out the BCL&#x27;s 50 percent stake.

==Supervision==
Based in Luxembourg and Germany, Clearstream is subject to the supervision of the regulatory authorities of these two countries. In Luxembourg, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) is the prudential regulator with authority over all banks and financial service providers. In Germany, Clearstream is regulated as a bank according to the German Banking Act (&quot;Kreditwesengesetz&quot;) and is therefore subject to the prudential supervision of the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (German: &quot;Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht&quot; - BaFin). Moreover, Clearstream is regulated in each market where it has operational centres, for example by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

As the operator of securities settlement systems in both Luxembourg and Germany, Clearstream is additionally regulated by the central banks of these two countries, namely the Banque centrale du Luxembourg and the Deutsche Bundesbank.

==Operations==

Clearstream accepts central banks and AML-regulated credit institutions (such as regulated banks) as customers. Clearstream does not accept natural persons as customers and no account is opened in the name of a natural person.

Clearstream has operational centres in Cork, Cardiff, Luxembourg, Prague, and Singapore. It also maintains representative offices in London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Dubai, New York, and Zurich.

===Asset Services===
Clearstream is responsible for the management, safekeeping/custody and administration of securities (assets) under custody. Services include income and redemption payments, corporate actions as well as tax and proxy voting.

The majority of securities safekept by Clearstream are immobilised. Securities are reflected in book-entry form in the accounts of customers at Clearstream regardless of whether they are held in physical or dematerialised form. This means that they are no longer represented by physical certificates, but instead by data entered into the Clearstream systems.

===Global Securities Financing===
Securities financing is the ability to borrow or lend cash or securities against collateral. In securities financing, collateral comprises assets given as a guarantee by a borrower to secure a securities loan and subject to seizure in the event of default. Collateral management refers to the handling of all tasks related to the monitoring of collateral posted by a borrower to meet a financial obligation (optimisation, substitution, top-up, withdrawal, settlement instruction, reporting, processing of margin calls and returns, notification of corporate events, etc.).

Clearstream&#x27;s collateral management, securities lending and borrowing services are gathered under the Global Liquidity Hub. It provides a pool of liquidity through links to agent banks, trading platforms, clearing houses and other market infrastructures.

Clearstream is a member of the Liquidity Alliance, which was established in January 2013 as a platform for CSDs to collaborate on collateral management. It was founded by ASX, Cetip, Clearstream, Iberclear and Strate.

===Investment Fund Services===
Clearstream has developed the world&#x27;s largest cross-border fund processing platform, called Vestima. It handles all types of funds, from mutual funds to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and hedge funds.

In addition to providing access to all fund types, Vestima supports their cross-border distribution. Services offered by Vestima include order routing, centralised delivery versus payment (DVP) settlement, safekeeping, asset servicing and collateral management.

===Issuance===
ICSDs and CSDs are often used to bring a security issue to the market, as they possess the necessary infrastructure for distributing the securities to the investors as well as for settlement and safekeeping. Clearstream&#x27;s ICSD also provides custody services, which means that the security can be serviced throughout its entire lifecycle. Clearstream provides the infrastructure which enables issuers to reach investors worldwide.

Clearstream&#x27;s services include eligibility assessments, issuance and distribution of domestic, foreign and international (i.e. Eurobonds) new issues of global and domestic instruments: certificates of deposit, depository receipts, treasury bills, commercial papers, short-term and medium-term notes, bonds, equities, warrants, equity-linked notes and investment fund shares.

===Settlement===
Clearstream&#x27;s ICSD settles trades in international securities and in domestic securities traded across borders. The CSDs settle domestic transactions in the German and Luxembourgish markets. Transactions between the two ICSDs Clearstream Banking SA and Euroclear Bank are settled via an electronic communications platform, called the Bridge.

Clearstream operates a delivery versus payment settlement system, ensuring simultaneous settlement of securities and cash transfers on a gross (trade-by-trade) basis. This helps to minimise the risk associated with the settlement of securities.

<doc id="1227224" wikidata="Q6242814" url="?curid=1227224" title="John Kenneally">
<text>Sergeant John Patrick Kenneally (né Leslie Jackson) VC (15 March 1921 – 27 September 2000) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
John Patrick Kenneally was born as Leslie Jackson at 104 Alexandra Road, Balsall Heath, Birmingham. His mother was Gertrude Nowell Robinson, the 18-year-old daughter of a Blackpool pharmacist who had been sent to live with relatives to conceal her son&#x27;s illegitimate birth. She changed her surname to Jackson, and had her son christened Leslie. Kenneally subsequently understood that his mother, who became a dance hostess, and the female friend with whom she lived in Birmingham were &quot;fairly high-class whores&quot;.
Kenneally claimed that his father was a wealthy Mancunian Jewish textile manufacturer, Neville Blond, who would later become chairman of the English Stage Company and marry Elaine Marks, the Marks &amp; Spencer heiress. Blond, despite paying maintenance, denied paternity, observing himself to have been &quot;only one of his mother&#x27;s many friends&quot;, and that he &quot;happened to have a bob or two, which meant &#x27;go for that fellow&#x27;&quot;.

Maintenance from Blond enabled Jackson to be initially educated at the privately run Calthorpe College. He later attended Tindal Street Junior Council School and then King Edward VI Five Ways.

==Military career==
Jackson joined the Honourable Artillery Company on his 18th birthday. He was assigned to an anti-aircraft battery and overstayed a period of leave. He was sentenced to a period of detention at Wellington Barracks, run by the Irish Guards. He was impressed by their high standards and applied for a transfer but was rejected. Jackson deserted and joined a group of itinerant Irish labourers, eventually making his way to Glasgow. When one of them, named John Patrick Kenneally, returned to Ireland, Jackson obtained his identity card and, adopting the man&#x27;s name, used it to enlist in the Irish Guards.

===VC Details===

Kenneally was a 22-year-old lance-corporal in the Irish Guards when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 28 April 1943 at Djebel Bou Azoukaz, Tunisia, Lance-Corporal Kenneally charged alone down the bare forward slope straight into the main body of the enemy about to make an attack, firing his Bren gun from the hip; the enemy were so surprised that they broke up in disorder. The lance-corporal repeated his exploit on 30 April when, accompanied by a sergeant, he charged the enemy forming up for assault, inflicting many casualties. Even when wounded he refused to give up, but hopped from one fire position to another, carrying his gun in one hand and supporting himself on a comrade with the other.

He was remembered in Winston Churchill&#x27;s famous broadcast speech on 13 May 1945 &quot;Five years of War&quot;, as having defended Ireland&#x27;s honour:&quot;When I think of these days I think also of other episodes and personalities. I do not forget Lieutenant-Commander Esmonde V.C., D.S.O., Lance-Corporal Kenneally, V.C., Captain Fegen V.C., and other Irish heroes that I could easily recite, and all bitterness by Britain for the Irish race dies in my heart. I can only pray that in years which I shall not see, the shame will be forgotten and the glories will endure, and that the peoples of the British Isles and of the British Commonwealth of Nations will walk together in mutual comprehension and forgiveness.&quot;

In 1943, Kenneally had married Elsie Francis; they had two sons and a daughter. He finished his military career in the newly formed 1st Guards Parachute Battalion and later bought himself out of the army in July 1948 to be with his wife and children.

==Later life==
Kenneally went into the motor trade after the army and remained in it for the rest of his working life. Reflecting on his heroic actions in Tunisia during an interview some years after the war&#x27;s end, Kenneally said that he charged the Germans only because of &quot;a strange don&#x27;t-give-a-damn feeling&quot; which had suddenly possessed him. He briefly appeared in the news again in 2000 when he published his autobiography and wrote to the Daily Telegraph rebuking Peter Mandelson for calling the Irish Guards &quot;chinless wonders&quot;.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Guards Regimental Headquarters (Irish Guards RHQ) in Wellington Barracks, London, England.

<doc id="1227227" wikidata="Q2436903" url="?curid=1227227" title="Mary Ann Jackson">
<text>Mary Ann Jackson (January 14, 1923 – December 17, 2003) was an American child actress who appeared in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short subjects series from 1928 to 1931. She was born and died in Los Angeles, California.

==Career==
Mary Ann Jackson&#x27;s film career began under the shadow of her actor relatives, mother Charlotte Jackson (1891–1992) and older sister, &quot;Peaches&quot; Jackson (1913–2002). Peaches had a fairly prolific stint as a child actress, working with such stars as Rudolph Valentino and D.W. Griffith in full-length features. Jackson made her film debut in a 1925 Ruth Taylor short, &quot;Dangerous Curves Behind&quot;.

Her first big break came in the short-subject series &quot;The Smith Family&quot;. These 20-minute Mack Sennett comedies co-starred Raymond McKee and Ruth Hiatt as a young married couple, and Mary Ann Jackson as their wide-eyed daughter Bubbles. The premise of each short had Smith experiencing some new enterprise (&quot;Smith&#x27;s New Home&quot;, &quot;Smith&#x27;s Candy Shop&quot;), or embarking on a family outing (&quot;Smith&#x27;s Picnic&quot;, &quot;Smith&#x27;s Holiday&quot;), usually with disastrous consequences. Jackson stole scene after scene as Bubbles, reacting—often directly at the camera—to the wild goings-on. Although the series ceased production in 1928, producer Sennett had stockpiled enough Smith shorts to release well into 1929, taking care to remove the &quot;Smith&quot; identification from the titles (&quot;Smith&#x27;s Burglar&quot; became &quot;The Burglar&quot;; &quot;Smith&#x27;s Rodeo&quot; became &quot;The Rodeo&quot;, etc.).

===&quot;Our Gang&quot;===
Mary Ann Jackson joined the Hal Roach studio in 1928. She was featured in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies, at the tail end of the silent era. Mary Ann was often the second female lead or the spunky older sister of &quot;Wheezer&quot; (Bobby Hutchins), Mary Ann&#x27;s snappy delivery came in handy during the series&#x27;s somewhat awkward transition to sound. With her bobbed hairstyle and freckles, tomboyish Mary Ann was a vast departure from the winsome miniature heroines who would populate the series before and after her tenure.

Jackson left the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series in 1931, at age 8, and appeared in a few two-reel &quot;Mickey McGuire&quot; comedies; some attempts were made to ease her into features, but, as she said in 1990: &quot;I wasn’t a girlie-girl type. I didn’t fit the mold so I was discarded like a piece of rubbish.&quot;
Jackson felt that children distorting themselves for a part in a short or feature was &quot;sick&quot;. She told her mother: &quot;This is not for me. I don&#x27;t want the responsibility or the rejection. I&#x27;m not an actress, I&#x27;m not talented, leave me alone, let me get on with my life!&quot;

In 1933, longtime &quot;Our Gang&quot; director Robert McGowan wrote in a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; feature that they normally preferred to cast children who had no previous acting experience, but Jackson was a rare exception: &quot;Mary Ann proved a real find and was my ideal little gang leading lady. She wasn&#x27;t pretty, but she was intelligent and willing and had just a touch of pathos in her makeup. She proved a rare find for me.&quot;

==Later life==
Jackson eventually took a job at the May Company department store in downtown Los Angeles, and made only a few brief forays into acting. In 1941, she doubled for Edith Fellows.

Mary Ann Jackson married at age 20, but was widowed. She married again, and spent many years with her second husband and her two children in the San Fernando Valley. Later in life, Mary Ann (dressed in &#x27;50s attire) and her sister Peaches would stop by Santa Monica bars and drink vodka martinis.

Upon recounting her &quot;Our Gang&quot; years, she laughed at the many women who laid false claim to being Mary Ann Jackson. They often cited their Louise Brooks-style bangs, which she loathed and had chopped off as soon as she left her acting career.

In 1990, she was delighted and amused to learn that during their stint with &quot;Our Gang&quot;, Jackie Cooper had been &quot;desperately in love with her&quot;. She did have fond regard for her days at the Hal Roach Studios and was impressed with her large fan following. Asked to recall her thoughts on the gang, she responded, &quot;Everything I have to say about [Hal] Roach and the gang is &#x27;nice&#x27;. There&#x27;s not one bad thing I can think of. It was just fun and fun and fun.&quot;

==Death==
Mary Ann Jackson died of a heart attack at her home in Los Angeles on December 17, 2003.

<text>Rudolf Serkin (28 March 1903 – 8 May 1991) was a Bohemian-born Austrian-American pianist. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest Beethoven interpreters of the 20th century.

==Early life, childhood debut, and education==
Serkin was born in then Eger, Kingdom of Bohemia, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now Czech Republic), to a Russian Jewish family. His father, Mordko Serkin, &quot;had been a Russian basso, and taught him to read music before he could read words.&quot;

Hailed as a child prodigy, he was sent to Vienna at the age of 9, where he studied piano with Richard Robert and, later, composition with Joseph Marx, making his public debut with the Vienna Philharmonic at 12. From 1918 to 1920 he studied composition with Arnold Schoenberg and participated actively in Schoenberg&#x27;s Society for the Private Performance of Music.

==Career==
Serkin began a regular concert career in 1920, living in Berlin with the German violinist Adolf Busch and his family, which included a then-3-year-old daughter Irene, whom Serkin would marry 15 years later.

In 1921, at age 17, he made his Berlin debut performing in Busch&#x27;s ensemble as the keyboard soloist in the Brandenburg Concerto No. 5. At the end of the concert, Busch told Serkin to play an encore to the enthusiastic audience. Serkin later reported that he asked Busch, &quot;What shall I play?&quot; and Busch &quot;as a joke&quot; told him to play the Goldberg Variations &quot;and I took him seriously. When I finished there were only four people left: Adolf Busch, Artur Schnabel, Alfred Einstein and me.&quot;

In the 1920s and early 1930s, Serkin performed throughout Europe both as soloist and with Busch and the Busch Quartet. With the rise of Hitler in Germany in 1933, Serkin and the Busches (who were not Jewish but who vehemently opposed the Nazi regime) left Berlin for Basel, Switzerland.

In 1933, Serkin made his first United States appearance at the Coolidge Festival in Washington, D.C., where he performed with Adolf Busch. In 1936, he launched his solo concert career in the US with the New York Philharmonic under Arturo Toscanini. His performance of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Fourth Piano Concerto was critically well received; Olin Downes of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;We have seldom heard a pianist&#x27;s performance which so admirably combined the most penetrating analysis with artistic enthusiasm and warm feeling. Similarly, the technical performance was clean and precise, but also beautiful and of a poetic coloring.&quot; In 1937, Serkin played his first New York City recital at Carnegie Hall, again to critical acclaim: Downes wrote, &quot;What Mr. Serkin did was to display a colossal art, which he devoted to the most idealistic purposes.&quot;

===Emigration to the United States===
Shortly after the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the Serkins and Busches immigrated to the United States, where Serkin taught several generations of pianists at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. From 1968 to 1976 he served as the Institute&#x27;s director. He lived with his growing family, first in New York, then in Philadelphia, as well as on a dairy farm in rural Guilford, Vermont. In 1951, Serkin and Adolf Busch founded the Marlboro Music School and Festival in Marlboro, Vermont, with the goal of stimulating interest in and performance of chamber music in the United States. He made numerous recordings from the 1940s into the 1980s, including one at RCA Victor of Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 4 in 1944, with the NBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Toscanini. Most of his recordings were made for Columbia Masterworks, although in the 1980s he also recorded for Deutsche Grammophon and Telarc. Serkin admired the music of Max Reger, which he discovered while working with Adolf Busch. In 1959, he became the first pianist in the United States to record Reger&#x27;s Piano Concerto, Op. 114, with Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra.

Serkin was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963 and in March 1972 celebrated his 100th appearance with the New York Philharmonic by playing Johannes Brahms&#x27; Piano Concerto No. 1. The orchestra and board of directors also named Serkin an honorary member of the New York Philharmonic-Symphony Society, a distinction also conferred on Aaron Copland, Igor Stravinsky, and Paul Hindemith. In 1986, he celebrated his 50th anniversary as a guest artist with the orchestra. He is regarded as one of the primary interpreters of the music of Beethoven in the 20th century.

Revered as a musician&#x27;s musician, a father figure to a legion of younger players who came to the Marlboro School and Festival, and a pianist of enormous musical integrity, he toured all over the world and continued his solo career and recording activities until illness prevented further work in 1989.

==Personal life==
Serkin married Irene Busch, the daughter of German violinist Adolf Busch, in 1935.

He and Irene were the parents of seven children (one of whom died in infancy), including pianist Peter Serkin and cellist Judith Serkin. They had 15 grandchildren, including the composer David Ludwig and the bassoonist Natalya Rose Vrbsky. 

Serkin died of cancer on 8 May 1991, aged 88, at home on his Guilford, Vermont farm. His widow Irene Busch Serkin died in 1998.

<text>James Gorman VC (21 August 1834 – 18 October 1882) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Gorman was 20 years old, and a seaman in the Naval Brigade of the Royal Navy during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 5 November 1854 at the Battle of Inkerman, Crimea, when the Right Lancaster Battery was attacked and many of the soldiers were wounded, Seaman Gorman, with two other seamen (Thomas Reeves and Mark Scholefield) and two others who were killed during the action, mounted the defence work banquette and, under withering attack from the enemy, kept up a rapid, repulsing fire. Their muskets were re-loaded for them by the wounded soldiers under the parapet and eventually the enemy fell back and gave no more trouble.

He later served in the Second Anglo-Chinese War and achieved the rank of Captain of the AfterGuard. He is buried in the Old Balmain Cemetery, Norton Street, Leichhardt, New South Wales, Australia, which in 1944 was closed and converted to a public park, &quot;Pioneers Memorial Park&quot;. There is a plaque in his memory on the War Memorial in Loyalty Square, Balmain.

<doc id="1227244" wikidata="Q6266617" url="?curid=1227244" title="Johnny Downs">
<text>John Morey Downs (October 10, 1913 – June 6, 1994) was an American actor, singer and dancer. He began his career as a child actor, most notably as Johnny in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short comedy film series from 1923 to 1926. He remained active in films, television and theatre through the early 1960s.

==Early life==
Downs was born in New York City. His father was Lt. Morey Downs, an aviator with the U.S. Navy. When he was eight, the family moved to San Diego due to his father&#x27;s transfer. Johnny&#x27;s mother took him to Hollywood for an audition with the Hal Roach Studios. He appeared in a silent film; then was cast as Johnny in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series, where he was a regular from 1923 until 1927 and appeared in 24 episodes.

==Adult career==
Outgrowing the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series at the age of 14, Downs and fellow &quot;Our Gang&quot; alumni Mary Kornman and Scooter Lowry performed vaudeville acts.

In 1934 he returned to Hollywood and landed a small part in the musical &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot;. He found his niche in the &quot;college musical&quot; movies of the late 1930s, starting with &quot;College Scandal&quot; (1935) and &quot;College Holiday&quot; (1936). With his boy-next-door good looks, he was often cast as a team captain or a cheerleader. Other movie musicals followed, ending in 1944 with &quot;What a Man!&quot;. He had a notable cameo in the 1945 film &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; where he danced to Robert Alda&#x27;s piano playing of &quot;Swanee&quot;. For the remainder of the 1940s and the early 1950s he had a few bit parts in films, including &quot;Cruisin&#x27; Down the River&quot;. He spent most of his time on the stage in summer stock and on Broadway, scoring a hit in &quot;Are You With It?&quot;. He appeared in nearly 100 movies.

==&quot;The Johnny Downs Show&quot;==
In 1949 Downs was co-host of &quot;Manhattan Showcase&quot;, a 15-minute talent-discovery program on CBS television. He settled in Coronado, California where he sold real estate and became a respected amateur tennis player. From 1953 to 1968 he hosted an after-school kids&#x27; television show, &quot;The Johnny Downs Show,&quot; on Channel 10 (call letters KFSD until 1961, subsequently KOGO). The theme started as an airport hangar with Downs playing a former World War II pilot, &quot;Johnny Jet&quot;. Between reruns of &quot;The Little Rascals&quot;, Downs entertained and informed studio audiences and viewers. Later, it was trains, and he was shown getting off or on a locomotive at the show&#x27;s beginning and end. As the show changed to feature more &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons, his theme changed from being a train engineer to being a boat captain at the San Diego harbor. Since one of the show&#x27;s sponsors was Golden Arrow Dairy, Downs was regularly featured as a superimposed miniature dancer on top of an old-style milk bottle. Children were welcome to come to the KOGO studio and watch the program being broadcast. When each show concluded, Downs waved to the viewing room and the visitors entered the studio. He let kids put on his coat and cap and mimic his opening &quot;Howdy, howdy, howdy! Good to see ya! Good to see ya!&quot; There was briefly a morning show where he invited students to come and compete in math quizzes. During this time he appeared as the Tin Woodsman in the San Diego Starlight Opera production of &quot;The Wizard Of Oz&quot;.

==Theater==
According to Carleton Carpenter&#x27;s autobiography, Downs worked as a choreographer in the theater in the late 1950s on a production called &quot;Lock Up Your Daughters&quot;. He &quot;did our dances, and they were really foolish. It wasn&#x27;t choreography; I don&#x27;t know what it was. I do know it wasn&#x27;t good, and it became a great source of amusement for all the company—behind Johnny&#x27;s back, of course, but we were about a subtle as a bus wreck. It bonded the cast completely together.&quot;

==Death==
Downs died of cancer on June 6, 1994, in Coronado, California at the age of 80. He and wife June had five children: Mary, Claudia, John Jr., Mollie and Maureen.

<doc id="1227250" wikidata="Q573246" url="?curid=1227250" title="Anthony Fauci">
<text>Anthony Stephen Fauci ( ; born December 24, 1940) is an American physician-scientist and immunologist who served as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) from 1984 to 2022, and the chief medical advisor to the president from 2021 to 2022. Fauci was one of the world&#x27;s most frequently cited scientists across all scientific journals from 1983 to 2002. In 2008, President George W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States, for his work on the AIDS relief program PEPFAR.

Fauci received his undergraduate education at the College of the Holy Cross and his Doctor of Medicine from Cornell University. As a physician with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Fauci served the American public health sector for more than fifty years and has acted as an advisor to every U.S. president since Ronald Reagan. During his time as director of the NIAID, he made contributions to HIV/AIDS research and other immunodeficiency diseases, both as a research scientist and as the head of the NIAID.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Fauci served under President Donald Trump as one of the lead members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. His advice was frequently contradicted by Trump, and Trump&#x27;s supporters alleged that Fauci was trying to politically undermine Trump&#x27;s run for reelection. After Joe Biden took office, Fauci began serving as one of the lead members of the White House COVID-19 Response Team and as Biden&#x27;s chief medical advisor. Fauci stepped down at the end of 2022.

On January 20, 2025, just hours before he left office, President Biden granted Fauci a full and unconditional pardon for any &quot;offenses against the United States&quot; he might have committed after January 1, 2014 as Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, as a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force or the White House COVID-19 Response Team, or as Chief Medical Advisor to the President.

==Early life and education==
Fauci was born on December 24, 1940, in Brooklyn, New York City, to Stephen A. (1910–2008) and Eugenia Lillian (&quot;née&quot; Abys; 1909–1965) Fauci as the youngest of two children. His father, a pharmacist, attended Columbia University and owned a drug store. Fauci worked with his mother and sister at the pharmacy&#x27;s register and also delivered prescriptions. The pharmacy was located in the Dyker Heights section of Brooklyn, directly beneath the family apartment, previously in the Bensonhurst neighborhood. When he was a child, Fauci developed a fascination with World War II, and played basketball and baseball.

Fauci&#x27;s grandparents immigrated to the United States from Italy in the late 19th century. His paternal grandparents, Antonino Fauci and Calogera Guardino, were from Sciacca, Sicily, and his maternal grandparents were from Naples. His maternal grandmother, Raffaella Trematerra, was a seamstress and his maternal grandfather, Giovanni Abys, was a Swiss-born artist noted for his landscape and portrait painting, magazine illustrations in Italy, as well as graphic design for commercial labels. Fauci grew up Catholic, but also considers himself a humanist who &quot;has faith in the goodness of mankind&quot;, stating that he thinks &quot;that there are a lot of things about organized religion that are unfortunate, and [that he tends] to like to stay away from it.&quot; In December 2023, Fauci stated that he still considers himself a Roman Catholic, but he does not practice his faith anymore for &quot;a number of complicated reasons&quot;; clarifying his relationship with the Catholic Church, he stated:
Fauci attended Regis High School, a competitive Jesuit school on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, where he captained the school&#x27;s basketball team despite standing only tall. He decided halfway through high school to become a physician. After graduating in 1958, Fauci enrolled in the College of the Holy Cross, where he studied classical Greek and worked in a construction gang during the summers. He graduated from Holy Cross in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in classics with a pre-med track. Fauci then attended Cornell University&#x27;s Medical College (now Weill Cornell Medicine), graduating with a Doctor of Medicine degree in 1966 ranked first in his class. At Cornell, he focused on adult internal medicine, mainly infectious diseases and the immune system. Fauci then did an internship and residency in internal medicine at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center (now Weill Cornell Medical Center).

==Career==
After completing his medical residency in 1968, Fauci joined the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as a clinical associate in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases&#x27;s (NIAID) Laboratory of Clinical Investigation (LCI). He became head of the LCI&#x27;s Clinical Physiology Section in 1974, and in 1980 was appointed chief of the NIAID&#x27;s Laboratory of Immunoregulation. He became director of the NIAID in 1984. Fauci has been offered the position of director of the NIH several times, but has declined each time.

Fauci has been at the forefront of U.S. efforts to contend with viral diseases like HIV/AIDS, SARS, the Swine flu, MERS, Ebola, and COVID-19. He played a significant role in the early 2000s in creating the President&#x27;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and in driving development of biodefense drugs and vaccines following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Fauci has been a visiting professor at many medical centers and has received numerous honorary doctorates from universities in the U.S. and abroad.

===Medical achievements===

Fauci has made important scientific observations that contributed to the understanding of the regulation of the human immune response and is recognized for delineating the mechanisms whereby immunosuppressive agents adapt to that response. He developed therapies for formerly fatal diseases such as polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and lymphomatoid granulomatosis. In a 1985 Stanford University Arthritis Center Survey, members of the American Rheumatism Association ranked Fauci&#x27;s work on the treatment of polyarteritis nodosa and granulomatosis with polyangiitis as one of the most important advances in patient management in rheumatology over the previous 20 years.

Fauci discovered how to re-dose cancer drugs in a way that turned a 98 percent mortality rate of the disorder vasculitis into a 93 percent remission rate.

Fauci has contributed to the understanding of how HIV destroys the body&#x27;s natural defense system, progressing to AIDS. He has outlined the mechanisms of induction of HIV expression by endogenous cytokines. Fauci has worked to develop strategies for the therapy and immune reconstitution of patients with the disease, as well as for a vaccine to prevent HIV infection. His current research is concentrated on identifying the nature of the immunopathogenic mechanisms of HIV infection and the scope of the body&#x27;s immune responses to HIV.

In 2003, the Institute for Scientific Information stated that from 1983 to 2002, &quot;Fauci was the 13th most-cited scientist among the 2.5 to 3.0 million authors in all disciplines throughout the world who published articles in scientific journals.&quot; As a government scientist under seven presidents, Fauci has been described as &quot;a consistent spokesperson for science, a person who more than any other figure has brokered a generational peace&quot; between the two worlds of science and politics.

===HIV/AIDS epidemic===

In a 2020 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Fauci remarked, &quot;My career and my identity has really been defined by HIV.&quot; He was one of the leading researchers during the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s. In 1981, he and his team of researchers began looking for a vaccine or treatment for this novel virus, though they would meet a number of obstacles. In October 1988, protesters came to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci, who had become the institute&#x27;s director in 1984, bore the brunt of the anger from the LGBTQ+ community who were largely ignored by the government.

Leading AIDS activist Larry Kramer attacked Fauci relentlessly in the media. He called him an &quot;incompetent idiot&quot; and a &quot;pill-pushing&quot; tool of the medical establishment. Fauci did not have control over drug approval though many people felt he was not doing enough. Fauci did make an effort in the late 1980s to reach out to the LGBTQ+ community in New York and San Francisco to find ways he and the NIAID could find a solution. Fauci was also praised for engaging with AIDS advocates, and he helped to make experimental AIDS treatments more accessible. Though Fauci was initially admonished for his treatment of the AIDS epidemic, his work in the community was eventually acknowledged. Kramer, who had spent years hating Fauci for his treatment of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, eventually called him &quot;the only true and great hero&quot; among government officials during the AIDS crisis.

Fauci was criticized over what some said was a delayed response from the U.S. government to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, including delays in the promotion of experimental HIV/AIDS drugs. In 2014, Sean Strub of &quot;HuffPost&quot; criticized Fauci for &quot;delaying promotion of an AIDS treatment that would have prevented tens of thousands of deaths in the first years of the epidemic&quot; and accused him of &quot;rewriting history.&quot;

Political commentator Helen Andrews defended Fauci&#x27;s actions during the epidemic in a 2021 article, writing:
Fauci was the main architect of President&#x27;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), an HIV/AIDS program responsible for saving over 20 million lives in the developing world.

=== 2009 swine flu pandemic ===
In a meeting with reporters on September 17, 2009, Fauci predicted that the H1N1 virus causing the 2009 swine flu pandemic could infect as many as one in three Americans, more than the amount of Americans usually infected by the seasonal flu.

===Ebola congressional hearing===
On October 16, 2014, in a United States congressional hearing regarding the Ebola virus crisis, Fauci, who, as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) had been discussing the importance of screening for weeks, testified that NIAID was still some distance away from producing sufficient quantities of cures or vaccines for widespread trials. Specifically, Fauci said, &quot;While NIAID is an active participant in the global effort to address the public health emergency occurring in west Africa, it is important to recognize that we are still in the early stages of understanding how infection with the Ebola virus can be treated and prevented.&quot;

Fauci also remarked in the hearing: &quot;As we continue to expedite research while enforcing high safety and efficacy standards, the implementation of the public health measures already known to contain prior Ebola virus outbreaks and the implementation of treatment strategies such as fluid and electrolyte replacement is essential to preventing additional infections, treating those already infected, protecting healthcare providers, and ultimately bringing this epidemic to an end.&quot;

===COVID-19 pandemic===
According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, before the COVID-19 pandemic, Fauci was &quot;mostly unknown outside the medical community&quot;.

====Trump administration====

Fauci had not met with Trump until three years after he was inaugurated as president.

Fauci was a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force established in late January 2020, under President Donald Trump, to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. He became a de facto public health spokesperson for the office of the president during the pandemic, and a strong advocate for ongoing social distancing efforts in the United States.

In interviews on January 21, January 26, and February 17, Fauci commented on COVID-19. He said that at the time of the interviews (&quot;right now&quot;), COVID-19 was not a &quot;major threat&quot; to the American public, with the risk to the American public being &quot;low&quot;, but that it was &quot;an evolving situation&quot;, and that &quot;public health officials need to take [COVID-19] very seriously&quot;. In the latter interview, Fauci said that COVID-19 could become a &quot;global pandemic which would then have significant implications for&quot; the United States.

In March 2020, he predicted that the infection fatality rate would likely be close to 1%, which was ten times more severe than the 0.1% reported rate for seasonal flu.

In a March 8, 2020, interview, Fauci stated that &quot;right now in the United States, people [who are not infected] should not be walking around with masks&quot;, but &quot;if you want to do it, that&#x27;s fine&quot;. In the same interview, Fauci said that buying masks &quot;could lead to a shortage of masks for the people who really need&quot; them: &quot;When you think masks, you should think of healthcare providers needing them&quot;. When Fauci made this comment, America&#x27;s top surgical mask maker was struggling to produce enough masks to meet the increased demand. On April 3, the CDC reversed course, quoting recent studies that showed asymptomatic transmission of the virus, thus advocating for the public to wear non-surgical masks to reduce community transmission while Fauci advocated for wearing facial coverings in public. Fauci&#x27;s shifting advice on wearing face masks drew criticism, which Fauci responded to by arguing that changes in policy were necessary as scientists learned more about COVID-19.

In mid-April, when asked about social distancing and stay-at-home measures, Fauci said that if the administration had &quot;started mitigation earlier&quot; more lives could have been saved, and &quot;no one is going to deny that.&quot; He added that the decision-making for implementing mitigation measures was &quot;complicated&quot;, and &quot;there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then.&quot;

Fauci&#x27;s comments were met with a hostile response from former Republican congressional candidate DeAnna Lorraine. Trump retweeted Lorraine&#x27;s response, which included the call to &quot;#FireFauci&quot;. &quot;Fire Fauci&quot; has also been chanted by anti-lockdown protesters in various locations, including Florida and Texas. As a result, the White House denied that Trump was firing Fauci, and blamed the media for overreacting.

Fauci was criticized by right-wing pundits and received death threats that necessitated a security detail. In an interview with &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in 2020, he mentioned that other members of his family, including his wife and daughters, had been repeatedly harassed since the pandemic began.
In June 2020, Fauci said that he was &quot;very concerned&quot; that the ongoing protests against police brutality would cause &quot;surges&quot; in COVID-19 cases, stating that the &quot;large crowds&quot; are a &quot;perfect set-up&quot; for the virus to spread. In July 2020, Fauci advised the public to &quot;avoid crowds of any type&quot;.

On July 6, 2020, Fauci spoke on a Facebook livestream, offering his opinion that the country&#x27;s situation pertaining to COVID-19 &quot;is really not good&quot;, pointing to more than 55,000 new cases on July 4, 2020. He said the United States was &quot;still knee-deep in the first wave&quot; of cases, and was experiencing a &quot;resurgence of infections&quot;. On July 7, 2020, during a press conference, Fauci stated that it was a &quot;false narrative to take comfort in a lower rate of death&quot; for COVID-19 in the country: &quot;There&#x27;s so many other things that are very dangerous and bad about this virus, don&#x27;t get yourself into false complacency.&quot; Both Trump and the White House had cited the falling death rate as proof of success of the Trump administration&#x27;s response. After this appearance by Fauci, the White House cancelled three media appearances that had been scheduled for him later that week. On July 7, 2020, Trump contradicted Fauci&#x27;s comments describing a dire situation in the country, with Trump saying: &quot;I think we are in a good place. I disagree with [Fauci].&quot; While there were disagreements, Trump also at times praised Fauci.

On July 9, 2020, Trump publicly opined that Fauci &quot;is a nice man, but he&#x27;s made a lot of mistakes.&quot; By July 12, 2020, a White House official told media outlets that &quot;several White House officials are concerned about the number of times Dr. Fauci has been wrong on things&quot;, passing to the media a list of purported mistakes made by Fauci during the outbreak. Included were statements Fauci made during a February 29, 2020, interview where he stated that &quot;at this moment, there is no need to change anything that you&#x27;re doing on a day-by-day basis.&quot; However, the White House list neglected to mention that in that same interview, Fauci had stated that the risk could change, &quot;when you start to see community spread&quot;, and that the disease could morph into &quot;a major outbreak&quot; in the country.

As late as September 23, 2020, when U.S. coronavirus fatalities exceeded 200,000, conservatives continued to question Fauci&#x27;s and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x27;s (CDC) recommendations for responding to the pandemic. In a hearing before the Senate&#x27;s Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Kentucky&#x27;s Senator Rand Paul asked him if he had &quot;second thoughts&quot; about his mitigation recommendations, including keeping six feet of distance from others and mask-wearing, claiming, &quot;our death rate is essentially worse than Sweden&#x27;s.&quot; Fauci stood by the guidelines, indicating Sweden&#x27;s fatality rate exceeded those of other Scandinavian countries, and said the comparison between Sweden and the U.S. was not legitimate. Fauci said the recommendations remained valid. After Paul then asserted New York&#x27;s high fatality rate showed that mitigation efforts were insufficient, Fauci replied, &quot;You&#x27;ve misconstrued that, Senator, and you&#x27;ve done that repetitively in the past.&quot; Fauci explained further that New York State had succeeded in getting the virus under control by following the CDC&#x27;s clinical guidelines. Paul had made numerous claims about herd immunity, Sweden&#x27;s interventions to combat the pandemic, the contention that the populations of Asian countries have greater resilience against COVID-19, and statements about death rates due to the virus. Fauci would have several intense exchanges with Paul.

In October 2020, Fauci objected after his words, &quot;I can&#x27;t imagine that anybody could be doing more&quot; were featured in an advertisement from the Trump campaign touting Trump&#x27;s handling of the pandemic. Fauci said he did not consent to the ad, his words were taken out of context (he was actually referring to how hard the Coronavirus Task Force was working), and he had never made a political endorsement in his career.

Also, in October, Fauci criticized the Great Barrington Declaration&#x27;s &quot;focused protection&quot; herd immunity strategy, calling it &quot;ridiculous&quot;, &quot;total nonsense&quot; and &quot;very dangerous&quot;, saying that it would lead to a large number of avoidable deaths. Fauci said that 30 percent of the population had underlying health conditions that made them vulnerable to the virus and that &quot;older adults, even those who are otherwise healthy, are far more likely than young adults to become seriously ill if they get COVID-19.&quot; He added, &quot;This idea that we have the power to protect the vulnerable is total nonsense because history has shown that that&#x27;s not the case. And if you talk to anybody who has any experience in epidemiology and infectious diseases, they will tell you that that is risky, and you&#x27;ll wind up with many more infections of vulnerable people, which will lead to hospitalizations and deaths. So I think that we just got to look that square in the eye and say it&#x27;s nonsense.&quot;

On October 18, 2020, Fauci mentioned that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t surprised&quot; Donald Trump contracted COVID-19. The next day, during a presidential call, Trump called Fauci &quot;a disaster&quot; and said that &quot;people are tired of COVID.&quot; During a campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona, on October 19, Trump launched attacks on his political rival Joe Biden, saying that Biden &quot;wants to listen to Dr. Fauci&quot; regarding the handling of the pandemic, upon which Biden merely replied &quot;Yes&quot; on Twitter. On October 31, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published an extensive interview with Fauci, in which he voiced a candid assessment of the administration&#x27;s COVID-19 policies and was critical of the influence of presidential advisor Scott Atlas.

Shortly after midnight on November 2, 2020, Trump insinuated he would fire Fauci &quot;after the election&quot; while on stage at a campaign rally at Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport in Opa-locka, Florida. At the rally, he made false claims that the pandemic was &quot;rounding the turn&quot; and was met by audience chants of &quot;Fire Fauci!&quot;, to which he responded, &quot;Don&#x27;t tell anybody, but let me wait until after the election... I appreciate the advice.&quot; Despite the rhetoric, Fauci was not fired.

On December 2, the United Kingdom became the first western country to license a vaccine against the coronavirus (Pfizer-BioNTech). In response, Fauci said that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was proceeding &quot;the correct way&quot; and said the UK &quot;really rushed through that approval&quot;. The next day Fauci apologized, telling the BBC &quot;I have a great deal of confidence in what the UK does both scientifically and from a regulator standpoint. Our process is one that takes more time than it takes in the UK... I did not mean to imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way.&quot;

On January 3, 2021, President Trump tweeted, &quot;The number of cases and deaths of the China Virus is far exaggerated in the United States because of [the CDC&#x27;s] ridiculous method of determination compared to other countries&quot;. That same morning, Fauci responded in an interview on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, &quot;The numbers are real. We have well over 300,000 deaths. We are averaging two- to three thousand deaths per day. All you need to do... is go into the trenches, go into the hospitals, go into the intensive care units and see what is happening. Those are real numbers, real people, and real deaths.&quot;

When asked if the 2021 United States Capitol attack was a COVID-19 superspreader event, Fauci stated: &quot;I think for those people there, they probably put themselves at an increased risk because they essentially did not adhere to the fundamentals of public health and COVID-19 context which is universal wearing of masks, keeping physical distance, avoiding crowds in congregate settings. The fact that it was outdoors is a little bit better than if they were indoors completely. But you can still have a super spreader situation when you do things in a crowded way.&quot;

On January 23, 2021, Fauci was quoted saying that letting the science speak on the pandemic got him &quot;into a little bit of trouble&quot; and got &quot;push-back from people in the White House, including the president&quot;, during the Trump administration. Fauci was also reportedly blocked from appearing on &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot; for some time because the Trump administration &quot;didn&#x27;t like the way [Maddow handles] things and they didn&#x27;t want me on [the show].&quot;

====Biden administration====

On December 3, 2020, President-elect Joe Biden asked Fauci, in addition to remaining in his role as director of the NIAID, to serve as the chief medical advisor to the president in the Biden administration. Fauci accepted the offer.

After the inauguration of Joe Biden in January 2021, Fauci said he experienced a &quot;liberating feeling&quot; in being able to speak freely about science without interference from the new administration. He pictured Biden&#x27;s administration as committed to being &quot;completely transparent, open and honest&quot;. Fauci was involved in the development of the Biden administration&#x27;s plan for a nationwide COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

In early April 2021, Fauci said of the current situation in the United States that &quot;It&#x27;s almost a race between getting people vaccinated and this surge that seems to want to increase&quot;.

In early May 2021, when asked if the CDC&#x27;s summer camp guidance was excessive, Fauci responded by saying that &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t call them excessive, but they certainly are conservative&quot; and added that the guidance &quot;looks a bit strict&quot; and &quot;a bit stringent&quot;. Also in early May, Fauci said that he is &quot;not convinced&quot; that COVID-19 originated naturally and that &quot;we should continue to investigate what went on in China until we continue to find out to the best of our ability what happened&quot;. In mid-May 2021, Fauci said that Americans who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 no longer need to wear masks outdoors, except for in &quot;completely crowded situations&quot;. This guidance was updated in July 2021 to recommend that all people wear masks regardless of vaccination status, in what Fauci said was due to the much more contagious Delta variant.

In May 2021, Fauci denied that the National Institutes of Health supported &quot;gain-of-function research&quot; at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

In early June 2021, over 3,000 internal government emails sent by Fauci from January to June 2020 were obtained by media outlets through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. These emails contain information about how the United States and Fauci initially responded to COVID-19.

On June 22, 2021, Fauci said that the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant is the &quot;greatest threat&quot; to eliminating COVID-19 in the United States.

In December 2021, Fauci, along with virologist Jeffery K. Taubenberger and David M. Morens endorsed the development of a universal coronavirus vaccine, advocating in favor of &quot;an international collaborative effort to extensively sample coronaviruses from bats as well as wild and farmed animals to help understand the full &quot;universe&quot; of existing and emerging coronaviruses.&quot;

In February 2022, Fauci told the &quot;Financial Times&quot; that &quot;As we get out of the full-blown pandemic phase of Covid-19, which we are certainly heading out of, these decisions will increasingly be made on a local level rather than centrally decided or mandated. There will also be more people making their own decisions on how they want to deal with the virus.&quot;

In March 2022, Fauci said that the United States should expect an increase in COVID-19 cases from the BA.2 subvariant of Omicron, but that it might not lead to a severe increase in hospitalizations and deaths.

On April 27, 2022, Fauci said that the United States was &quot;out of the full-blown explosive pandemic phase&quot; of COVID-19.

On May 15, 2022, Fauci said that he would resign if Donald Trump wins the 2024 U.S. presidential election. In a July 2022 interview with Politico, Fauci had been reported to be &quot;leaving by the end of President Joe Biden&#x27;s term&quot;, though he later clarified he may step down from his role as NIAID director. Fauci also told Politico he is seeking to &quot;help repair the widespread partisan polarization that has divided the nation and politicized science&quot;. On August 22, 2022, Fauci announced that he will step down from his position in December &quot;to pursue the next chapter&quot; of his career. He resigned from his position on December 31 of that same year.
On January 20, 2025, on the day of Donald Trump&#x27;s inauguration, President Biden preemptively pardoned Fauci for future potential prosecution for any federal offenses which he may have committed or taken part in between January 1, 2014, and the day of the pardon. Some reacted to this pardon as an &quot;unprecedented use&quot; of the president&#x27;s clemency powers.

===Later career===
On June 26, 2023, Georgetown University announced that Fauci would join its faculty as a distinguished professor, teaching in both the School of Medicine and McCourt School of Public Policy, effective July 1.

On February 7, 2025, the United States Department of Health and Human Services terminated a $168,000 contract for a Fauci museum exhibit at the National Institutes of Health.

==Cultural impact==
Owing to his prominent role in the United States&#x27; response to numerous global pandemics, most notably HIV/AIDS and COVID-19, Fauci has become the subject of tributes and interpretations across various media, including television, literature, merchandising, and internet memes. Brad Pitt&#x27;s performance as Fauci during the 2020 season of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; earned the actor an Emmy nomination, and praise from Fauci. Author Sally Quinn has credited Fauci as the inspiration for the love interest to the protagonist in her bestselling 1991 romance novel &quot;Happy Endings&quot;. Larry Kramer based the character Dr. Anthony Della Vida on Fauci in his play &quot;The Destiny of Me&quot;.

In the spring of 2020 amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, bakeries across the United States began selling pastries, particularly donuts, with Fauci&#x27;s face on them to pay tribute to his work in the public health sector.

In September 2021, &quot;Fauci&quot;, a documentary film about Fauci&#x27;s life and career, was released by Magnolia Pictures. The film was produced by National Geographic Documentary Films.

In November 2021, Skyhorse released a book by anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. titled &quot;The Real Anthony Fauci: Bill Gates, Big Pharma, and the Global War on Democracy and Public Health&quot;. In response, Fauci described the author as &quot;a very disturbed individual&quot;.

==Personal life==

Fauci is a longtime resident of Washington, D.C. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in 2022 that he has lived in the same &quot;comfortable but modest house since 1977&quot;. In 1985, he married Christine Grady, a nurse and bioethicist with the NIH, after they met while treating a patient. Grady is chief of the Department of Bioethics at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. Together, they have three adult daughters. At the time of his retirement, Fauci&#x27;s annual salary was $480,654, making him the highest paid U.S. federal government employee at the time.

Fauci has described himself as &quot;completely nonpolitical&quot;. His voter registration shows that he is not affiliated with any political party, although he still votes. Prior to 2020, he had positive relationships with both Democrats and Republicans, and considered George W. Bush a close friend: &quot;Obviously there&#x27;s been appropriate controversy regarding decisions regarding Iraq, but his moral compass about health equity is very strong.&quot; Fauci has specifically praised Bush&#x27;s work to combat HIV/AIDS through PEPFAR, a global health initiative credited with saving over 20 million lives as of 2021 primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa. According to Fauci, &quot;[Bush&#x27;s] exact words to me were, &#x27;We have a moral responsibility as a rich nation to not have people suffer and die merely because of where they live and the circumstances in which they were born&#x27;&quot;. Former CDC director and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, Tom Frieden, said that &quot;I have no idea what his politics are. Reagan and both Bushes liked him. Clinton and Obama liked him&quot;.

==Memberships==
On March 23, 2021, Fauci was admitted as an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.

===Harrison&#x27;s Principles of Internal Medicine===
Fauci has served as one of the principal editors of &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Principles of Internal Medicine&quot;, named on the front cover, from the 11th edition published in 1986, and on through the 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 
17th, 18th, 19th, 20th version, and latest (at the time of writing) 21st edition, published in 2022. He was the editor-in-chief of the 14th and 17th editions.

<text>The Marlboro Music School and Festival is a retreat for advanced classical training and musicianship held for seven weeks each summer in Marlboro, Vermont, in the United States. Public performances are held each weekend while the school is in session, with the programs chosen only a week or so in advance from the sixty to eighty works being currently rehearsed. Marlboro Music was conceived as a retreat where young musicians could collaborate and learn alongside master artists in an environment removed from the pressures of performance deadlines or recording. It combines several functions; Alex Ross describes it as functioning &quot;variously as a chamber-music festival, a sort of finishing school for gifted young performers, and a summit for the musical intelligentsia&quot;.

== History ==
Adolf Busch and his son-in-law Rudolf Serkin moved to Vermont in the 1940s as refugees from the Third Reich (Adolf Busch, who was not Jewish, left Germany as he was in opposition to National Socialist rule.) They became close friends of Walter Hendricks, who founded Marlboro College on the site of a former dairy farm. He asked their advice on the formation of a music department. On their advice, he recruited Marcel Moyse, Louis Moyse and Blanche Moyse – also refugees, and ill-situated – to Marlboro. Busch, Serkin, and the Moyse trio are the recognized founders of Marlboro Music, through their association with the college. But it was Busch, writes biographer Tully Potter, who provided the first impetus, as he &quot;had long wanted to create an environment in which professional players and rank amateurs could make music together, studying the chamber literature in depth and giving concerts only when and if they wished to do so.&quot; An attempt to realize this wish came in 1950 with a summer school lasting from July 1–13, with few students, that is &quot;not regarded part of the &#x27;official&#x27; Marlboro canon&quot;. The following year, Busch and Serkin &quot;turned down an invitation to the Edinburgh Festival to concentrate on their own project,&quot; says Potter. They attracted 54 &quot;participating artists&quot; (students) in what is now recognized as the first Marlboro summer festival. After Busch&#x27;s untimely death on June 9, 1952, Serkin devoted great attention to continuing his beloved father-in-law&#x27;s work; he became its guiding light for the rest of his life. He valued Marlboro&#x27;s small size and rural environment, inviting colleagues to come to, says Ross, &quot;lose their worldliness, to fall into a slower rhythm.&quot;

Marlboro&#x27;s purpose moved away from Busch&#x27;s idea of amateur participation; instead leading professionals from both solo and orchestral positions work with young musicians of the highest promise and achievement, who must pass through a rigorous audition process to be accepted. Prominent musicians associated with Marlboro have included Pierre-Laurent Aimard, Emanuel Ax, Joshua Bell, Jonathan Biss, Anner Bylsma, Pablo Casals, Nikki Chooi, Jeremy Denk, Leon Fleisher, Gary Graffman, Hilary Hahn, Mieczysław Horszowski, Gilbert Kalish, Anton Kuerti, Lang Lang, James Levine, Yo-Yo Ma, Mischa Maisky, Viktoria Mullova, Siegfried Palm, Murray Perahia, Lara St. John, Richard Stoltzman, and Sándor Végh.

Marlboro has had enormous influence on American chamber music. The Guarneri Quartet was formed at Marlboro in 1964; Yo-Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax, a long-standing duo, concertized together as a duo for the first time at Marlboro, on August 3, 1973. (Ma, incidentally, met his wife Jill there, one of many musical couples to meet at Marlboro.) Other groups associated with Marlboro in various ways have included the Emerson Quartet, Juilliard Quartet, Orion String Quartet, St. Lawrence Quartet, and Beaux Arts Trio.

Since 2018, the Marlboro Music School and Festival has been led by Artistic Co-Directors Mitsuko Uchida and Jonathan Biss.

During non-summer months, the festival runs the Musicians From Marlboro national touring program, with performances in many U.S. cities each year.

A tradition Serkin began of ending the summer with a performance of the Beethoven Choral Fantasy – in which most participants, even non-singers, joined in the chorus – was discontinued with his death in 1991, but was reinstated a few years later. As then co-director Richard Goode told Alex Ross, &quot;Many people felt that Serkin playing the Choral Fantasy was a unique experience that could never be duplicated. After he died, the work was retired, and I thought that was the right decision. To my surprise, a few years later people said, &#x27;You know, I think we have to have a Choral Fantasy.&#x27; We needed the catharsis.&quot;

Also, the Festival still commemorates Busch&#x27;s birthday, August 8, with a special concert.

<text>Donald Haines (May 9, 1919 – February 20, 1943) was an American child actor who had recurring appearances in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short subjects series from 1930 to 1933. He appeared in &quot;Our Gang&quot; during the early sound days along with Norman &quot;Chubby&quot; Chaney, Allen &quot;Farina&quot; Hoskins, Jackie Cooper, Matthew &quot;Stymie&quot; Beard, Bobby &quot;Wheezer&quot; Hutchins, and Dorothy DeBorba.

==Early years==
Haines was born in Seward County, Nebraska, the son of Karl and Nola Haines. Their family moved to California when he was 9 years old.

==&quot;Our Gang&quot;==
Haines&#x27;s tenure began during the early talkies up through the &quot;Miss Crabtree episodes,&quot; and then the early Spanky episodes. He would leave with Jackie Cooper for feature films at Paramount only to return a few months later. He was 11 years old when he joined the gang in 1930. His association with the Our Gang series lasted through 1933.

Haines&#x27;s first short was &quot;Shivering Shakespeare&quot;, which featured him giggling his way through his lines. He was intended to originally be a full-time character playing the tough guy and was cast as such in &quot;The First Seven Years&quot;, opposite Jackie Cooper. After that, he played a recurring character with occasional lines of dialogue until 1931. At that time he was offered a contract with Paramount that began with a role in a feature called &quot;Skippy&quot;. Cooper also was offered a role on that feature along with a contract. Both Jackie and Donald are missing from the final scenes of the second-to-last short made in the 1930-31 season, &quot;Bargain Day&quot;, owing to their beginning work at Paramount.

Haines left Paramount to return to Hal Roach Studios just in time for the 1931-32 season. Haines would resume his role as a recurring character with occasional dialogue for the next two seasons. Haines left the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series at the age of 15 after appearing in the 1933 short &quot;Fish Hooky&quot;.

==Later career==
Haines left the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series in 1933 but continued working as an actor at Hal Roach Studios on many shorts and features until 1940. His work during this time included appearances in the East Side Kids films &quot;East Side Kids&quot; and &quot;Boys of the City&quot; as &quot;Pee Wee&quot; and then in &quot;That Gang of Mine&quot;, &quot;Pride of the Bowery&quot;, &quot;Flying Wild&quot;, &quot;Bowery Blitzkrieg&quot;, and &quot;Spooks Run Wild&quot; as &quot;Skinny.&quot; He also played Jerry Cruncher Jr. in the film version of &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;.

==Death==
Haines enlisted as an aviation cadet in the United States Army Air Forces on December 10, 1941, to serve in World War II. On February 20, 1943, first lieutenant Haines was flying a Bell P-39 Airacobra on a strafing mission against Erwin Rommel&#x27;s forces during the Battle of Kasserine Pass in Tunisia. His fighter group, the 93rd Fighter Squadron, destroyed a locomotive and train cars, and 34 enemy trucks. Haines failed to return from the mission, and was listed as killed in action. Haines is buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

<doc id="1227265" wikidata="Q1518272" url="?curid=1227265" title="Triploblasty">
<text>Triploblasty is a condition of the gastrula in which there are three primary germ layers: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Germ cells are set aside in the embryo at the blastula stage, and are incorporated into the gonads during organogenesis. The germ layers form during the gastrulation of the blastula. The term &quot;triploblast&quot; may refer to any egg cell in which the blastoderm splits into three layers.

All bilaterians, which are the animals with bilaterally symmetrical embryos, are triploblastic. Other animal taxa, namely the ctenophores, placozoans, and cnidarians, are diploblastic, which means that their embryos contain only two germ layers. Sponges are even less developmentally specialized, because they lack both true tissues and organs.

The earliest triploblasts are thought to have evolved from the diploblasts at some time during the Proterozoic era, establishing themselves as a group prior to their diversification during the Cambrian explosion.

<text>The National Association for Bilingual Education (NABE) is a non-profit organization founded in 1975 in the United States. NABE advocates for the development and implementation of bilingual education programs, aiming to address the educational needs of students who speak a language other than English at home. The organization emphasizes academic programs that support English proficiency while maintaining respect for linguistic and cultural diversity.

== Founding and early years (1975–1980) ==
NABE was formally established during the Fourth Annual International Bilingual Bicultural Education Conference held in May 1975 at the Palmer House Hotel in Chicago, Illinois. It was founded primarily by Mexican-American and other Hispanic and Latino educators and scholars, including author Alma Flor Ada and Josue Gonzalez, to address systemic inequities in education for language-minority students, particularly Spanish-speaking children.

The organization emerged during a period of growing awareness about the educational needs of non-English-speaking students, influenced by the Bilingual Education Act of 1968, which marked a shift in federal education policy. NABE’s objectives included promoting bilingual education policies, ensuring equal educational opportunities, and supporting the integration of bilingual curricula into schools.

In 1976, NABE launched the &quot;NABE Journal&quot;, which provided a forum for educators, researchers, and policymakers to discuss issues related to bilingual education. Early issues focused on political advocacy, legal challenges, and research related to bilingual program effectiveness.

== Expansion and advocacy (1980–1990) ==
In the 1980s, NABE faced political challenges as debates intensified over the value of bilingual education. A 1981 report by Keith Baker and Adriana de Kanter, commissioned by the U.S. federal government, questioned the effectiveness of transitional bilingual programs and recommended alternative approaches. NABE and its supporters criticized the report for methodological flaws and biases, arguing that it failed to account for the broader benefits of bilingual education.

In response to these challenges, NABE broadened its focus to include advocacy for dual-language immersion programs, which aim to develop bilingual proficiency for both native English speakers and English learners. These programs gained traction as an innovative alternative to transitional models.

During this period, NABE expanded the scope of its &quot;NABE Journal&quot;, addressing topics such as vocational training, international perspectives on bilingual education, and methodological advances. The journal became a key resource for educators and researchers seeking evidence-based strategies for supporting English learners.

== Legislative challenges and coalition building (1990–2000) ==

=== &quot;Bilingual Research Journal&quot; ===
In the early 1990s, the &quot;NABE Journal&quot; was renamed the &quot;Bilingual Research Journal&quot; (&quot;BRJ&quot;) to reflect a broader focus on research and scholarship in bilingual education. The transition marked a shift in the publication’s purpose, emphasizing rigorous research on sociolinguistics, educational assessment, and policy implications related to bilingual education. The &quot;BRJ&quot; continued to serve as a platform for addressing issues such as language acquisition, instructional strategies, and the impact of legislation on bilingual programs. It also maintained its role as a resource for educators and policymakers.

=== Legislative challenges ===
In the 1990s, NABE intensified its advocacy efforts as political opposition to bilingual education grew. The organization took a leading role in opposing the 1998 California Proposition 227, which sought to replace bilingual education with English-only instruction. NABE argued that such measures marginalized non-English-speaking students and limited their access to equitable educational opportunities.

To strengthen its advocacy, NABE built coalitions with organizations such as the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) and the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC). These partnerships helped amplify NABE’s voice in national policy discussions and ensured a unified approach to defending bilingual education programs.

== Professional development and program innovation (2000–present) ==
NABE has continued to prioritize professional development and the dissemination of research. Its annual conferences and workshops provide educators, policymakers, and researchers with platforms to discuss legislative updates, share instructional strategies, and explore emerging research on bilingual education.

The organization’s leadership has remained focused on promoting evidence-based practices and addressing systemic barriers to educational equity. Leaders such as Rosanna Boyd have emphasized the importance of coalition-building and advocacy to support legislative reforms that benefit English learners.

NABE continues to advocate for policies that support bilingual education, emphasizing the importance of linguistic and cultural diversity in U.S. schools. The organization seeks to expand dual-language programs, improve professional development opportunities for educators, and address systemic barriers to educational equity for English learners.

<text>Dorothy Adele DeBorba (March 28, 1925 – June 2, 2010) was an American child actress of Portuguese descent who was a regular in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series of short subjects as the leading lady from 1930 to 1933.

==Early life==
Dorothy Adelle DeBorba was raised in Livermore, California. Of Portuguese Azorean ancestry, she came from a show business background. Her mother was a singer-dancer-actress, and her father was a drummer in Paul Whiteman&#x27;s band.

==&quot;Our Gang&quot;==
Dorothy DeBorba began her career at age five. She impressed Hal Roach with her ability to cry on cue. Her debut was an auspicious one: in &quot;Pups Is Pups&quot; (1930), she plays Jackie Cooper&#x27;s younger sister.

With her trademark curls and elaborate hair bows, Dorothy quickly became an audience favorite. Her mother made those bows and would spend two hours every night brushing and putting Dorothy&#x27;s hair up in curlers. Her natural energy and mischievousness added to her appeal. Although she stated that &quot;the boys [in the series] were given all the best ,&quot; in &quot;Love Business&quot; Dorothy has some of the funniest lines in the entire series, delivered while Chubby is practicing his seductive patter on an oversized cutout poster of Greta Garbo in front of a movie house:

::&quot;Chubby:&quot; Darling, can you hear the pleas in my whispers?
::&quot;Dorothy:&quot; Darling, can you hear the fleas in my whiskers?

::&quot;Chubby&quot;: If love is like a rose, I will pick my rose in the bud.
::&quot;Dorothy:&quot; If love is like a rose, I will stick my nose in the mud.

::&quot;Chubby:&quot; My heart is filled with joy. I want to trip and dance.
::&quot;Dorothy:&quot; My heart is filled with joy. I want to rip my pants.

This &quot; compulsion&quot; earned her the nickname &quot;Echo&quot; at the Hal Roach Studios.

In 1931 Dorothy became the female star after Mary Ann Jackson left the series.

She appeared in twenty-four &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies over three years with her last appearance coming in 1933&#x27;s &quot;Mush and Milk.&quot; &quot;It was like we had the biggest playhouse in the world,&quot; she said. &quot;We were always playing when we weren&#x27;t working or going to school. &#x27;Uncle&#x27; Bob McGowan had a real terrific way with children.&quot; She stated, however, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t really much fun, working every day and going to school besides. By the age of ten, of course, the movie careers of most of us were finished.&quot;

==Later life==
DeBorba graduated from Van Nuys High School and then worked at Republic Pictures as a secretary. In later years she was a senior clerk in the School of Journalism at UC-Berkeley. She married twice and had two children.

==Death==
DeBorba died in 2010 of emphysema at the age of 85 in Walnut Creek, California.

<text>Colonel George de Cardonnel Elmsall Findlay VC MC &amp; Bar (20 August 1889 – 26 June 1967) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Findlay was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in January 1910. He was awarded a Military Cross for gallantry at the Battle of Passchendale after which he took command of 409 (Lowland) Field Company, a territorial company in June 1917.

==VC details==
He was 29 years old, and an acting major in the 409 (Lowland) Field Company, Corps of Royal Engineers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place during the second battle of Sambre for which he was awarded the VC.

On 4 November 1918 during the forcing of the Sambre-Oise Canal at the lock south of Catillon, France, Major Findlay was with the leading bridging and assaulting parties which came under heavy fire and the advance was stopped. Nevertheless, he collected what men he could and repaired the bridge, under incessant fire. Although wounded he continued with his task and after two unsuccessful efforts managed to place the bridge in position across the lock and was the first man across, remaining at this dangerous post until further work was completed. The family story goes that the reason Major Findlay crossed safely was because he was a slow runner. The Germans overcompensated their aim and thus missed him as he led his men across the bridge.

==Further information==

Findlay was educated at St Ninian&#x27;s Prep School, Moffat and Harrow School.

He later achieved the rank of colonel and served in World War II. He became Deputy Lieutenant of the County of Dumbarton in 1957.

Findlay is buried at Kilmaronock Church, near Gartocharn, West Dunbartonshire, Scotland in his family plot.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum, Chatham, Kent.

<doc id="1227275" wikidata="Q1093711" url="?curid=1227275" title="T-square (fractal)">
<text>In mathematics, the T-square is a two-dimensional fractal. It has a boundary of infinite length bounding a finite area. Its name comes from the drawing instrument known as a T-square.

==Algorithmic description==
It can be generated from using this algorithm:

# Image 1:
## Start with a square. (The black square in the image)
# Image 2:
## At each convex corner of the previous image, place another square, centered at that corner, with half the side length of the square from the previous image.
## Take the union of the previous image with the collection of smaller squares placed in this way.
# Images 3–6:
## Repeat step 2.

The method of creation is rather similar to the ones used to create a Koch snowflake or a Sierpinski triangle, &quot;both based on recursively drawing equilateral triangles and the Sierpinski carpet.&quot;

==Properties==
The T-square fractal has a fractal dimension of ln(4)/ln(2) = 2. The black surface extent is &quot;almost&quot; everywhere in the bigger square, for once a point has been darkened, it remains black for every other iteration; however some points remain white.

The fractal dimension of the boundary equals formula_1.

Using mathematical induction one can prove that for each n ≥ 2 the number of new squares that are added at stage n equals formula_2.

==The T-Square and the chaos game==

The T-square fractal can also be generated by an adaptation of the chaos game, in which a point jumps repeatedly half-way towards the randomly chosen vertices of a square. The T-square appears when the jumping point is unable to target the vertex directly opposite the vertex previously chosen. That is, if the current vertex is &quot;v&quot;[i] and the previous vertex was &quot;v&quot;[i-1], then &quot;v&quot;[i] ≠ &quot;v&quot;[i-1] + &quot;vinc&quot;, where &quot;vinc&quot; = 2 and modular arithmetic means that 3 + 2 = 1, 4 + 2 = 2:

If &quot;vinc&quot; is given different values, allomorphs of the T-square appear that are computationally equivalent to the T-square but very different in appearance:

==T-square fractal and Sierpiński triangle==

The T-square fractal can be derived from the Sierpiński triangle, and vice versa, by adjusting the angle at which sub-elements of the original fractal are added from the center outwards.

<doc id="1227278" wikidata="Q2610072" url="?curid=1227278" title="Coppa Ciano">
<text>The Coppa Ciano was an automobile race held in Italy. Originally referred to as Coppa Montenero or Circuito Montenero, the Coppa Ciano name was officially in use between 1927 and 1939.

==History==

During the years immediately following World War I several road circuits were created in Italy. These included the Montenero Circuit at Livorno, which became home for the annual Coppa Montenero from its inauguration in 1921. In the beginning it was only a local affair and the organizers quickly found themselves in financial troubles. In 1923 the event was taken over by the Automobile Club of Italy and the future was secured.

In 1927, the Livorno-born politician Costanzo Ciano donated a victory trophy: the Coppa Ciano. At first, this was awarded to the victor in a separate sports car race, run within a week of the Coppa Montenero. In 1929, however, the Coppa Ciano was merged into the main event and at the same time became the name most often used.

The driver Emilio Materassi won 4 years in a row 1925-1928 and earned the nickname &quot;King of Montenero&quot;.

In the 1930s, Italian Hall of Fame driver Tazio Nuvolari won this race five times, more than any other driver. In his 1936 victory he made his way through the field, beating the otherwise superior German cars. This victory was one of the reasons leading to the Italian Grand Prix being held at the Montenero circuit in 1937, instead of the usual venue, Monza.

The 1939 race was run to Voiturette regulations and became the last before World War II stopped all racing for many years.
In 1947 the 20th and final edition of the Coppa Montenero was run, with 1500 cc unsupercharged cars. At that point, due to Costanzo Ciano&#x27;s connections with the now abolished Fascist regime, it was no longer called Coppa Ciano.

He also appeared as one of Mother Peep&#x27;s children in the Laurel &amp; Hardy feature film &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot; (1934). He also appeared with Shirley Temple in &quot;Captain January&quot; in 1936, playing the &quot;know-it-all&quot; boy who forgets his answers on the test. On radio, Tucker played &quot;the juvenile lead&quot; on &quot;Jones and I&quot;, which was broadcast on CBS in the early 1940s and Roy Barry on the soap opera &quot;Hilltop House&quot;.

Tucker went on to serve in the United States Navy during World War II and the Korean War. He served aboard the . During World War II, he sustained an injury that caused him to limp, when his ship was hit by a Japanese &quot;kamikaze&quot;. Afterwards he married Myra K. Heino and had a successful career as an electrical engineer with RCA before retiring. His wife died in August 2012.

<text>A pulsar (&quot;pulsating star, on the model of quasar&quot;) is a highly magnetized rotating neutron star that emits beams of electromagnetic radiation out of its magnetic poles. This radiation can be observed only when a beam of emission is pointing toward Earth (similar to the way a lighthouse can be seen only when the light is pointed in the direction of an observer), and is responsible for the pulsed appearance of emission. Neutron stars are very dense and have short, regular rotational periods. This produces a very precise interval between pulses that ranges from milliseconds to seconds for an individual pulsar. Pulsars are one of the candidates for the source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (see also centrifugal mechanism of acceleration.)

Pulsars’ highly regular pulses make them very useful tools for astronomers. For example, observations of a pulsar in a binary neutron star system were used to indirectly confirm the existence of gravitational radiation. The first extrasolar planets were discovered in 1992 around a pulsar, specifically PSR B1257+12. In 1983, certain types of pulsars were detected that, at that time, exceeded the accuracy of atomic clocks in keeping time.

==History of observation==
===Discovery===
Signals from the first discovered pulsar were initially observed by Jocelyn Bell while analyzing data recorded on August 6, 1967, from a newly commissioned radio telescope that she helped build. Initially dismissed as radio interference by her supervisor and developer of the telescope, Antony Hewish, the fact that the signals always appeared at the same declination and right ascension soon ruled out a terrestrial source. On November 28, 1967, Bell and Hewish using a fast strip chart recorder resolved the signals as a series of pulses, evenly spaced every 1.337 seconds. No astronomical object of this nature had ever been observed before. On December 21, Bell discovered a second pulsar, quashing speculation that these might be signals beamed at earth from an extraterrestrial intelligence.

When observations with another telescope confirmed the emission, it eliminated any sort of instrumental effects. At this point, Bell said of herself and Hewish that &quot;we did not really believe that we had picked up signals from another civilization, but obviously the idea had crossed our minds and we had no proof that it was an entirely natural radio emission. It is an interesting problem—if one thinks one may have detected life elsewhere in the universe, how does one announce the results responsibly?&quot; Even so, they nicknamed the signal &quot;LGM-1&quot;, for &quot;little green men&quot; (a playful name for intelligent beings of extraterrestrial origin).

It was not until a second pulsating source was discovered in a different part of the sky that the &quot;LGM hypothesis&quot; was entirely abandoned. Their pulsar was later dubbed CP 1919, and is now known by a number of designators including PSR B1919+21 and PSR J1921+2153. Although CP 1919 emits in radio wavelengths, pulsars have subsequently been found to emit in visible light, X-ray, and gamma ray wavelengths.

The word &quot;pulsar&quot; first appeared in print in 1968: 
The existence of neutron stars was first proposed by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1934, when they argued that a small, dense star consisting primarily of neutrons would result from a supernova. Based on the idea of magnetic flux conservation from magnetic main sequence stars, Lodewijk Woltjer proposed in 1964 that such neutron stars might contain magnetic fields as large as 1014 to 1016 gauss (=1010 to 1012 tesla). In 1967, shortly before the discovery of pulsars, Franco Pacini suggested that a rotating neutron star with a magnetic field would emit radiation, and even noted that such energy could be pumped into a supernova remnant around a neutron star, such as the Crab Nebula. After the discovery of the first pulsar, Thomas Gold independently suggested a rotating neutron star model similar to that of Pacini, and explicitly argued that this model could explain the pulsed radiation observed by Bell Burnell and Hewish. 
In 1968, Richard V. E. Lovelace with collaborators discovered period formula_1 ms of the Crab Nebula pulsar using Arecibo Observatory.
The discovery of the Crab pulsar provided confirmation of the rotating neutron star model of pulsars. The Crab pulsar 33-millisecond pulse period was too short to be consistent with other proposed models for pulsar emission. Moreover, the Crab pulsar is so named because it is located at the center of the Crab Nebula, consistent with the 1933 prediction of Baade and Zwicky.
In 1974, Antony Hewish and Martin Ryle, who had developed revolutionary radio telescopes, became the first astronomers to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, with the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences noting that Hewish played a &quot;decisive role in the discovery of pulsars&quot;. Considerable controversy is associated with the fact that Hewish was awarded the prize while Bell, who made the initial discovery while she was his PhD student, was not. Bell claims no bitterness upon this point, supporting the decision of the Nobel prize committee.

=== Milestones ===
In 1974, Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr. and Russell Hulse discovered for the first time a pulsar in a binary system of stars, PSR B1913+16. This pulsar orbits another neutron star with an orbital period of just eight hours. Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity predicts that this system should emit strong gravitational radiation, causing the orbit to continually contract as it loses orbital energy. Observations of the pulsar soon confirmed this prediction, providing the first ever evidence of the existence of gravitational waves. As of 2010, observations of this pulsar continue to agree with general relativity. In 1993, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Taylor and Hulse for the discovery of this pulsar.

In 1982, Don Backer led a group that discovered PSR B1937+21, a pulsar with a rotation period of just about 1.6 milliseconds (38,500 rpm). Observations soon revealed that its magnetic field was much weaker than ordinary pulsars, while further discoveries cemented the idea that a new class of object, the &quot;millisecond pulsars&quot; (MSPs) had been found. MSPs are believed to be the end product of X-ray binaries. Owing to their extraordinarily rapid and stable rotation, MSPs can be used by astronomers as clocks rivaling the stability of the best atomic clocks on Earth. Factors affecting the arrival time of pulses at Earth by more than a few hundred nanoseconds can be easily detected and used to make precise measurements. Physical parameters accessible through pulsar timing include the 3D position of the pulsar, its proper motion, the electron content of the interstellar medium along the propagation path, the orbital parameters of any binary companion, the pulsar rotation period and its evolution with time. (These are computed from the raw timing data by Tempo, a computer program specialized for this task.) After these factors have been taken into account, deviations between the observed arrival times and predictions made using these parameters can be found and attributed to one of three possibilities: intrinsic variations in the spin period of the pulsar, errors in the realization of Terrestrial Time against which arrival times were measured, or the presence of background gravitational waves. Scientists are currently attempting to resolve these possibilities by comparing the deviations seen between several different pulsars, forming what is known as a pulsar timing array. The goal of these efforts is to develop a pulsar-based time standard precise enough to make the first ever direct detection of gravitational waves. In 2006, a team of astronomers at LANL proposed a model to predict the likely date of pulsar glitches with observational data from the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. They used observations of the pulsar PSR J0537−6910, that is known to be a quasi-periodic glitching pulsar. However, no general scheme for glitch forecast is known to date.

In 1992, Aleksander Wolszczan discovered the first extrasolar planets around PSR B1257+12. This discovery presented important evidence concerning the widespread existence of planets outside the Solar System, although it is very unlikely that any life form could survive in the environment of intense radiation near a pulsar.

== Pulsar-like white dwarfs ==

White dwarfs can also act as pulsars. Because the moment of inertia of a white dwarf is much higher than that of a neutron star, the white-dwarf pulsars rotate once every several minutes, far slower than neutron-star pulsars.

By 2024, three pulsar-like white dwarfs have been identified.

* In 1998, Nazar Ikhsanov showed that a white dwarf in the binary system AE Aquarii acts like a radio pulsar. The confirmation of the pulsar-like properties of the white dwarf in AE Aquarii was provided in 2008 by a discovery of X-ray pulsations, which showed that this white dwarf acts not only as a radio pulsar, but also as an X-ray pulsar. 

* In 2016, a white dwarf in the binary system AR Scorpii was identified as a pulsar (it is often mistakenly called the first discovered pulsar-like white dwarf). The system displays strong pulsations from ultraviolet to radio wavelengths, powered by the spin-down of the strongly magnetized white dwarf.

* In 2023, it was suggested that the white dwarf eRASSU J191213.9−441044 acts as a pulsar both in radio and X-rays.

There is an alternative tentative explanation of the pulsar-like properties of these white dwarfs. In 2019, the properties of pulsars have been explained using a numerical magnetohydrodynamic model explaining was developed at Cornell University. According to this model, AE Aqr is an intermediate polar-type star, where the magnetic field is relatively weak and an accretion disc may form around the white dwarf. The star is in the propeller regime, and many of its observational properties are determined by the disc-magnetosphere interaction. A similar model for eRASSU J191213.9−441044 is supported by the results of its observations at ultraviolet wave lengths, which showed that its magnetic field strength does not exceed 50 MG.

==Nomenclature==
Initially pulsars were named with letters of the discovering observatory followed by their right ascension (e.g. CP 1919). As more pulsars were discovered, the letter code became unwieldy, and so the convention then arose of using the letters PSR (Pulsating Source of Radio) followed by the pulsar&#x27;s right ascension and degrees of declination (e.g. PSR 0531+21) and sometimes declination to a tenth of a degree (e.g. PSR 1913+16.7). Pulsars appearing very close together sometimes have letters appended (e.g. PSR 0021−72C and PSR 0021−72D).

The modern convention prefixes the older numbers with a B (e.g. PSR B1919+21), with the B meaning the coordinates are for the 1950.0 epoch. All new pulsars have a J indicating 2000.0 coordinates and also have declination including minutes (e.g. PSR J1921+2153). Pulsars that were discovered before 1993 tend to retain their B names rather than use their J names (e.g. PSR J1921+2153 is more commonly known as PSR B1919+21). Recently discovered pulsars only have a J name (e.g. PSR J0437−4715). All pulsars have a J name that provides more precise coordinates of its location in the sky.

==Formation, mechanism, turn off==

The events leading to the formation of a pulsar begin when the core of a massive star is compressed during a supernova, which collapses into a neutron star. The neutron star retains most of its angular momentum, and since it has only a tiny fraction of its progenitor&#x27;s radius, it is formed with very high rotation speed. A beam of radiation is emitted along the magnetic axis of the pulsar, which spins along with the rotation of the neutron star. The magnetic axis of the pulsar determines the direction of the electromagnetic beam, with the magnetic axis not necessarily being the same as its rotational axis. This misalignment causes the beam to be seen once for every rotation of the neutron star, which leads to the &quot;pulsed&quot; nature of its appearance.

In rotation-powered pulsars, the beam is the result of the rotational energy of the neutron star, which generates an electrical field and very strong magnetic field, resulting in the acceleration of protons and electrons on the star surface and the creation of an electromagnetic beam emanating from the poles of the magnetic field. Observations by NICER of PSR J0030+0451 indicate that both beams originate from hotspots located on the south pole and that there may be more than two such hotspots on that star. This rotation slows down over time as electromagnetic power is emitted. When a pulsar&#x27;s spin period slows down sufficiently, the radio pulsar mechanism is believed to turn off (the so-called &quot;death line&quot;). This turn-off seems to take place after about 10–100 million years, which means of all the neutron stars born in the 13.6-billion-year age of the universe, around 99% no longer pulsate.

Though the general picture of pulsars as rapidly rotating neutron stars is widely accepted, Werner Becker of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics said in 2006, &quot;The theory of how pulsars emit their radiation is still in its infancy, even after nearly forty years of work.&quot;

==Categories==
Three distinct classes of pulsars are currently known to astronomers, according to the source of the power of the electromagnetic radiation:
* rotation-powered pulsars, where the loss of rotational energy of the star provides the power,
* accretion-powered pulsars (accounting for most but not all X-ray pulsars), where the gravitational potential energy of accreted matter is the power source (producing X-rays that are observable from the Earth),
* magnetars, where the decay of an extremely strong magnetic field provides the electromagnetic power.

Although all three classes of objects are neutron stars, their observable behavior and the underlying physics are quite different. There are, however, some connections. For example, X-ray pulsars are probably old rotationally-powered pulsars that have already lost most of their energy, and have only become visible again after their binary companions had expanded and begun transferring matter on to the neutron star.

The process of accretion can, in turn, transfer enough angular momentum to the neutron star to &quot;recycle&quot; it as a rotation-powered millisecond pulsar. As this matter lands on the neutron star, it is thought to &quot;bury&quot; the magnetic field of the neutron star (although the details are unclear), leaving millisecond pulsars with magnetic fields 1000–10,000 times weaker than average pulsars. This low magnetic field is less effective at slowing the pulsar&#x27;s rotation, so millisecond pulsars live for billions of years, making them the oldest known pulsars. Millisecond pulsars are seen in globular clusters, which stopped forming neutron stars billions of years ago.

Of interest to the study of the state of the matter in a neutron star are the &quot;glitches&quot; observed in the rotation velocity of the neutron star. This velocity decreases slowly but steadily, except for an occasional sudden variation known as &quot;glitch&quot;. One model put forward to explain these glitches is that they are the result of &quot;starquakes&quot; that adjust the crust of the neutron star. Models where the glitch is due to a decoupling of the possibly superconducting interior of the star have also been advanced. In both cases, the star&#x27;s moment of inertia changes, but its angular momentum does not, resulting in a change in rotation rate.
===Disrupted recycled pulsar===
When two massive stars are born close together from the same cloud of gas, they can form a binary system and orbit each other from birth. If those two stars are at least a few times as massive as the Sun, their lives will both end in supernova explosions. The more massive star explodes first, leaving behind a neutron star. If the explosion does not kick the second star away, the binary system survives. The neutron star can now be visible as a radio pulsar, and it slowly loses energy and spins down. Later, the second star can swell up, allowing the neutron star to suck up its matter. The matter falling onto the neutron star spins it up and reduces its magnetic field.

This is called &quot;recycling&quot; because it returns the neutron star to a quickly-spinning state. Finally, the second star also explodes in a supernova, producing another neutron star. If this second explosion also fails to disrupt the binary, a double neutron star (neutron star binary) is formed. Otherwise, the spun-up neutron star is left with no companion and becomes a &quot;disrupted recycled pulsar&quot;, spinning between a few and 50 times per second.

==Applications==

The discovery of pulsars allowed astronomers to study an object never observed before, the neutron star. This kind of object is the only place where the behavior of matter at nuclear density can be observed (though not directly). Also, millisecond pulsars have allowed a test of general relativity in conditions of an intense gravitational field.

===Maps===

Pulsar maps have been included on the two &quot;Pioneer&quot; plaques as well as the &quot;Voyager&quot; Golden Record. They show the position of the Sun, relative to 14 pulsars, which are identified by the unique timing of their electromagnetic pulses, so that Earth&#x27;s position both in space and time can be calculated by potential extraterrestrial intelligence. Because pulsars are emitting very regular pulses of radio waves, their radio transmissions do not require daily corrections. Moreover, pulsar positioning could create a spacecraft navigation system independently, or be used in conjunction with satellite navigation.

===Pulsar navigation===

&quot;X-ray pulsar-based navigation and timing (XNAV)&quot; or simply &quot;pulsar navigation&quot; is a navigation technique whereby the periodic X-ray signals emitted from pulsars are used to determine the location of a vehicle, such as a spacecraft in deep space. A vehicle using XNAV would compare received X-ray signals with a database of known pulsar frequencies and locations. Similar to GPS, this comparison would allow the vehicle to calculate its position accurately (±5 km). The advantage of using X-ray signals over radio waves is that X-ray telescopes can be made smaller and lighter. Experimental demonstrations have been reported in 2018.

===Precise clocks===

Generally, the regularity of pulsar emission does not rival the stability of atomic clocks. They can still be used as external reference. For example, J0437−4715 has a period of  s with an error of .
This stability allows millisecond pulsars to be used in establishing ephemeris time
or in building pulsar clocks.

&quot;Timing noise&quot; is the name for rotational irregularities observed in all pulsars. This timing noise is observable as random wandering in the pulse frequency or phase. It is unknown whether timing noise is related to pulsar glitches. According to a study published in 2023, the timing noise observed in pulsars is believed to be caused by background gravitational waves. Alternatively, it may be caused by stochastic fluctuations in both the internal (related to the presence of superfluids or turbulence) and external (due to magnetospheric activity) torques in a pulsar.

===Probes of the interstellar medium===
The radiation from pulsars passes through the interstellar medium (ISM) before reaching Earth. Free electrons in the warm (8000 K), ionized component of the ISM and H II regions affect the radiation in two primary ways. The resulting changes to the pulsar&#x27;s radiation provide an important probe of the ISM itself.

Because of the dispersive nature of the interstellar plasma, lower-frequency radio waves travel through the medium slower than higher-frequency radio waves. The resulting delay in the arrival of pulses at a range of frequencies is directly measurable as the &quot;dispersion measure&quot; of the pulsar. The dispersion measure is the total column density of free electrons between the observer and the pulsar:

:formula_2

where formula_3 is the distance from the pulsar to the observer, and formula_4 is the electron density of the ISM. The dispersion measure is used to construct models of the free electron distribution in the Milky Way.

Additionally, density inhomogeneities in the ISM cause scattering of the radio waves from the pulsar. The resulting scintillation of the radio waves—the same effect as the twinkling of a star in visible light due to density variations in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere—can be used to reconstruct information about the small scale variations in the ISM. Due to the high velocity (up to several hundred km/s) of many pulsars, a single pulsar scans the ISM rapidly, which results in changing scintillation patterns over timescales of a few minutes. The exact cause of these density inhomogeneities remains an open question, with possible explanations ranging from turbulence to current sheets.

===Probes of space-time===
Pulsars orbiting within the curved space-time around Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, could serve as probes of gravity in the strong-field regime. Arrival times of the pulses would be affected by special- and general-relativistic Doppler shifts and by the complicated paths that the radio waves would travel through the strongly curved space-time around the black hole. In order for the effects of general relativity to be measurable with current instruments, pulsars with orbital periods less than about 10 years would need to be discovered; such pulsars would orbit at distances inside 0.01 pc from Sgr A*. Searches are currently underway; at present, five pulsars are known to lie within 100 pc from Sgr A*.

===Gravitational wave detectors===
There are four consortia around the world which use pulsars to search for gravitational waves: the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) in Europe, the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) in Australia, the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) in Canada and the US, and the Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) in India. Together, the consortia form the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). The pulses from Millisecond Pulsars (MSPs) are used as a system of galactic clocks. Disturbances in the clocks will be measurable at Earth. A disturbance from a passing gravitational wave will have a particular signature across the ensemble of pulsars, and will be thus detected.

<text>Thomas Ross Bond (September 16, 1926 – September 24, 2005) was an American actor, director, producer and writer. He was best known for his work as a child actor for two nonconsecutive periods in &quot;Our Gang&quot; (&quot;Little Rascals&quot;) comedies (first as &quot;Tommy&quot; and later as &quot;Butch&quot;). Also, he is noted for being the first actor to appear onscreen as DC Comics character Jimmy Olsen, in the film serials &quot;Superman&quot; (1948) and &quot;Atom Man vs. Superman&quot; (1950).

==Biography==

===Early years and &quot;Our Gang&quot;===
Born in Dallas, Texas, Bond got his start in 1931 at the age of 4 when a talent scout for Hal Roach studios approached him as he was leaving a Dallas cinema.

Bond was hired at Hal Roach Studios for the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series in the summer of 1931 to begin work that upcoming fall, at around the same time as George &quot;Spanky&quot; McFarland was hired. Bond worked in &quot;Our Gang&quot; for three years, alternately appearing as a supporting character and a background actor. His speaking roles increased by 1934, including his most substantive role up to that point, as the gang&#x27;s band conductor in &quot;Mike Fright&quot;. In late 1934, Bond left the series and returned to public school, still earning periodic bit parts in Hollywood productions. 
After leaving the gang for the first time, Bond also worked as a voice actor, most notably in several of Tex Avery&#x27;s &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoons for Warner Bros. His best known voice role was as the speaking voice of &quot;Owl Jolson&quot; in Tex Avery&#x27;s 1936 &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon, &quot;I Love to Singa&quot;.

Bond returned to &quot;Our Gang&quot; on a recurring basis late in 1936, when Roach hired him to play &quot;Butch&quot;, the neighborhood bully. In the film &quot;Practical Jokers&quot;, his mother calls him &quot;Tommy&quot;, apparently indicating that &quot;Butch&quot; was a nickname. Bond&#x27;s first short as Butch was &quot;Glove Taps&quot;. Besides filling the role of the archetypal &quot;Our Gang&quot; bully, the Butch character also regularly competed with meek Alfalfa (Carl Switzer) for the affections of his sweetheart Darla (Darla Hood). While in &quot;Our Gang&quot;, Bond appeared in a number of outside films, such as those featuring fellow Hal Roach Studios comedians Charley Chase and Laurel and Hardy.

By the late 1930s Bond was so established as a juvenile actor that other studios recruited him for feature films. He was a regular in Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Five Little Peppers&quot; series of children&#x27;s stories in 1939-40. He also appeared opposite singing star Gloria Jean in Universal&#x27;s &quot;A Little Bit of Heaven&quot; (1940).

When the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1938, Bond remained with the group. His final &quot;Our Gang&quot; short was &quot;Bubbling Troubles&quot; (1940). Bond continued to work in other MGM productions following his departure from &quot;Our Gang&quot;. In total, Bond appeared in 27 &quot;Our Gang&quot; shorts – 13 as &quot;Tommy&quot; and 14 as &quot;Butch&quot;.

===Later years===
After serving in the U.S. Navy during World War II, Bond returned to acting, and appeared in two &quot;Gas House Kids&quot; features alongside former on-screen rival Carl Switzer. In the late 1940s, Bond became the first actor to portray cub reporter Jimmy Olsen in two &quot;Superman&quot; film serials: &quot;Superman&quot; (1948) and &quot;Atom Man vs. Superman&quot; (1950).

In 1951, Bond graduated from college and quit acting, but remained in show business in the areas of television directing and production, and worked with individuals such as Norman Lear, George Schlatter, and many others. He worked at KTTV in Los Angeles from the 1950s to the early 1970s. He then went to work for KFSN in Fresno from the early 1970s to 1991. Bond also worked as a production manager on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;.

During the 1960s, Bond was an active member of Emmanuel Lutheran Church in North Hollywood where a number of his Hollywood friends and colleagues attended. Together, they were instrumental in the production and presentation of the annual Christmas Pageant presented on the grounds of Emmanuel&#x27;s school Laurel Hall. The production, which involved a cast of several hundred, a chariot and horses, numerous other animals and professional Hollywood sets and lighting, was presented each year during the Christmas season for several weeks leading up to Christmas. Grandstand-style bleachers were installed that seated about 1000 guests. Highlights of the pageant included a horse-driven chariot and Roman soldiers on horseback riding through the gates of Bethlehem to proclaim the census requiring Jews to register in their hometowns. Bond was instrumental in arranging for the production to be filmed and aired on Metromedia-owned Channel 11, KTTV in about 1965.

In 1972, he appeared as a guest on &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; while working as a production assistant on the show. Bond retired from television in 1991. In his latter years he lived in the Fresno and Madera Ranchos area, and served as a spokesman for a number of &quot;Our Gang&quot;-related materials. Bond published his autobiography, &quot;Darn Right It&#x27;s Butch: Memories of Our Gang/The Little Rascals,&quot; with the help of Fresno teacher, film historian and co-author Ron Genini, in 1994. Tommy&#x27;s son, Thomas R. Bond II &quot;Butch, Jr.&quot;, who is a film and television producer, worked with his father in their family production company, Biograph Company. The senior Bond also hosted &quot;The Rascals&quot;, a documentary on the life and times of the &quot;Little Rascals&quot;.

Throughout his lifetime, Bond appeared in 73 films, was a charter member of the Screen Actors Guild, joining in 1937, and worked with many Hollywood stars in the years of 1933 to 1951, including James Stewart, Eleanor Powell, Ray Bolger, Frank Morgan, and Eddie Cantor among many others.

==Death==
Bond died on September 24, 2005, at age 79 due to complications from heart disease in Northridge, California. He is buried at U.S. Veterans Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California.

<text>Brigadier Percy Howard Hansen, (26 October 1890 – 12 February 1951) was a British Army officer and recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to personnel of the British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Hansen was born into a wealthy and well-connected Danish family that settled first in South Africa then, after 1900, in London. He was educated at preparatory schools in Hazelwood, Limpsfield, Surrey and Oxted, Surrey; then at Eton College (from 20 September 1904). His father, Viggo Julius Hansen, was naturalised as a British subject in 1910, so that his son could join the British Army.

==Military career==
After officer training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Hansen was commissioned into the Lincolnshire Regiment on 4 March 1911.

===First World War===
Hansen was appointed as a temporary captain shortly after the outbreak of war in 1914, as adjutant in the 6th (Service) Battalion of the Lincolnshire Regiment, and his promotion was made permanent in the following April. He fought with his battalion, a recently created Kitchener&#x27;s Army unit composed of civilian volunteers, during the Gallipoli campaign in the summer of 1915. On 9 August 1915 at Yilghin Bumu, Hansen&#x27;s battalion was forced to withdraw while assaulting Scimitar Hill. Hansen and volunteers repeatedly moved back and forth under heavy fire to successfully rescue six wounded men from capture, or death by burning. Hansen was consequently awarded the Victoria Cross.

A month later, Hansen won the Military Cross for performing a reconnaissance mission at Suvla Bay. On the night of 9 September 1915, he carried out a solo reconnaissance of the coast, carrying only a revolver and a blanket for disguise. He successfully located an important Turkish firing position.

Due to ill-health, Hansen was eventually transferred to France and appointed brigade major to the 170th (2/1st North Lancashire) Brigade. He remained a staff officer for the rest of the war, during which he served with the II Anzac Corps. He was made a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for another reconnaissance mission during the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917.

===Between the wars===
Remaining in the army after the war, Hansen attended the Staff College, Camberley and, for most of the interwar period, served in numerous staff positions. After graduating, he then served as a brigade major with the 8th Infantry Brigade, part of the 3rd Infantry Division, then serving in Southern Command, before becoming a brigade major with the 4th Infantry Division&#x27;s 12th Infantry Brigade. His next assignment was as a General Staff Officer Grade 2 (GSO2) to the 55th (West Lancashire) Division, a Territorial Army (TA) formation, and then a GSO2 in Jamaica, before returning to the United Kingdom and being made Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General (DAAG) with Western Command. He was then posted to the 2nd Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment, initially as the battalion&#x27;s second-in-command. The battalion was serving in Palestine, then the scene of an Arab revolt. The battalion was in Palestine for five months before it was sent back to England, and in September 1937, Hansen became the Commanding Officer (CO). He continued to command the battalion until the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939.

===Second World War===
On 2 September 1939, the day before the war began, Hansen was posted to the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division, a TA formation which he had served with before, and was made Assistant Adjutant-General &amp; Quartermaster-General (AA&amp;QMG). He held this post until late January 1941, when he became Deputy Assistant &amp; Quartermaster-General (DA&amp;QMG) with XII Corps, then commanded by Lieutenant General Andrew Thorne. The corps, which was commanded from late April by Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery, had responsibility for the defence of Kent in the event of a German invasion of the United Kingdom.

Hansen continued in this role until February 1942 when he was made an Area Commander of Belfast Area, prior to becoming a Sub-District Commander, Ashford Area until serving on the staff of Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF). He remained in this position until the war&#x27;s end in 1945, and he retired from the army in January 1946.

Hansen died on 12 February 1951, at the relatively young age of sixty. He is one of only fourteen men, other than Gurkhas born in Nepal, not born as a British subject to have received the Victoria Cross.

==Awards and decorations==
* Victoria Cross (1 October 1915) &quot;For most conspicuous bravery on 9th August, 1915, at Yilghin Burnu, Gallipoli Peninsula. After the second capture of the &quot;Green Knoll&quot; his Battalion was forced to retire, leaving some wounded behind, owing to the intense heat from the scrub which had been set on fire. When the retirement was effected Captain Hansen, with three or four volunteers, on his own initiative, dashed forward several times some 300 to 400 yards over open ground into the scrub under a terrific fire, and succeeded in rescuing from inevitable death by burning, no less than six wounded men.&quot;
* Distinguished Service Order (16 September 1918) &quot;For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He volunteered to carry out a reconnaissance, and brought back valuable information obtained under heavy artillery and machine-gun fire, which had been unprocurable from other sources. Throughout he did fine work.&quot;
* Military Cross (29 October 1915) &quot;For conspicuous gallantry at Suvla Bay on 9th September, 1915. He made a reconnaissance of the coast, stripping himself and carrying only a revolver and a blanket for disguise. He swam and scrambled over rocks, which severely cut and bruised him, and obtained some valuable information and located a gun which was causing much damage. The undertaking was hazardous. On one occasion he met a patrol of 12 Turks who did not see him, and later a single Turk whom he lulled. He returned to our lines in a state of great exhaustion.&quot;
* Mentioned in dispatches five times
* Croix de Guerre with Bronze Star (France)
* Officer of the Legion of Merit (14 November 1947, United States)
* Commander of the Royal Order of St Olav (Norway)

==Birthplace and place of death controversy==
There is disagreement concerning the places of Hansen&#x27;s birth and death. Some sources state that he was born in Durban, South Africa; another says &quot;Dresden, Germany (where his parents were taking a cure)&quot;. One source gives his place of death as &quot;Kensington, London&quot;, and subsequent burial at Garrison Cemetery, Copenhagen, while another says he died in Copenhagen.

The Danish &quot;folketælling 1895&quot; (census) have him written in the papers when he was 4 years old. His birthplace is &quot;Dresden&quot;. His mother &quot;Else Hansen&quot; and his father &quot;Viggo Hansen&quot; were born in Copenhagen. His father had a grocery store. Their house was on &quot;Kongens Nytorv&quot; (matrikel 34). (reference: Folketælling 1895, hovedliste, løbenummer 353, familie nr 98)

<text>General Sir Lewis Stratford Tollemache Halliday, (14 May 1870 – 9 March 1966) was an English Royal Marine officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Halliday was born in Medstead, Hampshire on 14 May 1870. He was commissioned into the Royal Marines in 1889.

==Victoria Cross==
Halliday was 30 years old, and a captain in the Royal Marine Light Infantry, during the Boxer Rebellion in China when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 24 June 1900 at Peking, China, an attack was made on the British Legation by the Boxers who set fire to the stables and occupied some of the other buildings. It being imperative to drive the enemy out, a hole was knocked in the Legation wall and 20 men of the RMLI went in. Captain Halliday, leading a party of six men, was involved in desperate fighting and was severely wounded but despite his injuries, he killed four of the enemy. Finally, unable to carry on any further, he ordered his men to go on without him, after which he returned to the legation alone, telling his men &#x27;carry on and not mind him&#x27;, so as not to diminish the number of men engaged in the sortie. He walked 100 yards unaided to the hospital although his shoulder was half blown out and his left lung punctured.

His citation reads:
He was promoted to brevet major for his part in the legation&#x27;s defence, and returned to the United Kingdom to receive the VC from King Edward VII during an investiture at Marlborough House on 25 July 1901.

==Later service==
Having recovered from his wound he returned to duty at the end of 1901. He commanded the Marine detachment aboard , and then commanded the Marines aboard , the flagship of the home fleet, from late 1902. In 1907 having completed the Staff College, Camberley, he was appointed staff officer to the Portsmouth Division of his corps. He then commanded a company of Gentleman Officer Cadets at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst for four years during which time he was promoted to major. Among his cadets was the future Field Marshal Earl Alexander of Tunis.

In November 1914 he was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel and succeeded Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton Reed as a GSO1. In early 1915 he was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel and on 14 July of that year he was made lieutenant colonel. In November 1915 he joined GHQ, Home Forces as General Staff Officer.

He was appointed colonel second Commandant of the Royal Marine Light Infantry in 1920 and colonel commandant on 1 January 1923. Halliday was promoted to major general on 11 December 1925, to lieutenant general on 11 June 1927 and to general on 1 October 1928. He served as ADC to King George V in 1924 and 1925, and he held the post of Adjutant-General Royal Marines from December 1927 until his voluntary retirement in June 1930. He was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 3 June 1913, he was elevated as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1930.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Marines Museum in Southsea, England.

<text>Howard Levy (born July 31, 1951) is an American musician. A keyboardist and virtuoso harmonica player, he &quot;has been realistically presented as one of the most important and radical harmonica innovators of the twentieth century.&quot;

In 1988, Levy was a founding member of Béla Fleck and the Flecktones, with whom he won a 1997 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance for the song &quot;The Sinister Minister&quot;. He also won a Grammy for Best Instrumental Composition in 2012 for &quot;Life in Eleven&quot;, a song written with Béla Fleck for the Flecktones&#x27; album &quot;Rocket Science&quot; (2011). He has worked with Arab-fusion musician Rabih Abou-Khalil, Latin jazz saxophonist Paquito D&#x27;Rivera, Donald Fagen, and Paul Simon.

==Career==
Levy was born in Brooklyn, New York, and attended the Manhattan School of Music, where he studied piano and pipe organ. For two years, he went to Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and participated in the jazz band. He is the Harmonica Lessons instructor for ArtistWorks.

===Harmonica innovator===
Levy plays in many genres: jazz, classical, rock, folk, Latin, blues, country, and world music. He drew attention for his chromatic playing style on a regular diatonic harmonica. He discovered the overblow and overdraw techniques for chromatic playing in 1970. These allow a harmonica player to obtain all the missing chromatic notes in the Richter-tuned diatonic harmonica.

In 1995, he performed the &quot;Harmonia Mundi Suite for Harmonica and Chamber Ensemble&quot; in Chicago. He composed a concerto for harmonica in 2001 and performed it with orchestras in the U.S. and Europe.

===Forming groups===
In 1988, Levy co-founded Béla Fleck and the Flecktones. He won a Grammy for Pop Instrumental for the song &quot;The Sinister Minister&quot;. He left the band in 1992. Levy toured with Kenny Loggins and appeared on his album &quot;Outside from the Redwoods&quot;. Levy returned to the Flecktones in 2011, touring and recording the album &quot;Rocket Science&quot; (2011).

In the 1990s Levy founded Trio Globo with Eugene Friesen and Glen Velez. He leads another band, Acoustic Express and is music director of the Latin jazz group Chévere de Chicago.

He is the founder of Balkan Samba Records. The roster includes Chévere de Chicago, Alberto Mizrahi and Trio Globo, Fox Fehling, and Norman Savitt.

===Touring and recording with others===
Levy has toured or recorded with Kenny Loggins, John Prine, Ben Sidran, Bob Gibson, Bobby McFerrin, Bryan Bowers, Chris Siebold, Chuck Mangione, Claudio Roditi, David Bromberg, Styx, Dennis DeYoung, Dolly Parton, Donald Fagen, Holly Cole, Jerry Butler, Mark Nauseef, Miroslav Tadic, Paquito D&#x27;Rivera, Pete Seeger, Steve Goodman, Terry Callier, and Tom Paxton.

== Gear ==
Levy favors an equal temperament tuning and plays harmonicas customized by Joe Filisko.

<text>The Illinois Service, branded Amtrak Illinois, comprises three passenger rail routes operated by Amtrak in the American state of Illinois. The &quot;Illinois Service&quot; is funded primarily by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) and falls under the broader Amtrak Midwest brand.

Chicago is a terminus for all three &quot;Illinois Service&quot; routes, which all have multiple daily round trips:
* Chicago–Quincy: two round trips daily, the &quot;Illinois Zephyr&quot; and the &quot;Carl Sandburg&quot;
* Chicago–St. Louis &quot;Lincoln Service&quot;: four round trips daily and the only route that serves another state
* Chicago–Carbondale: two round trips daily, the &quot;Illini&quot; and the &quot;Saluki&quot;, and the only route whose trains have checked baggage service

==Proposed expansion==
Two proposed &quot;Illinois Service&quot; routes have been accepted by the Corridor Identification and Development Program, both in December 2023:
* Chicago–Peoria &quot;Prairie Marksman&quot; via Joliet, Morris, Ottawa, and LaSalle-Peru
* Chicago–Moline &quot;Quad Cities&quot;: uses the existing Chicago–Quincy route between Chicago and Princeton, branching from it west of Wyanet to serve the Quad Cities via Geneseo

The &quot;Quad Cities&quot; and the Rockford-Chicago portion of the &quot;Black Hawk&quot; were to have been added in late 2015 but were put on hold by then-Governor Bruce Rauner. They were resurrected and funded in 2019 as part of a transportation bill supported by Governor J.B. Pritzker. In 2023, Pritzker announced that the Rockford-Chicago train will be operated by Metra.

In addition to the two new routes, a committee was formed in late 2021 to study and promote extending the Chicago–Quincy route to Hannibal, Missouri.

<doc id="1227304" wikidata="Q13341477" url="?curid=1227304" title="Chavín culture">
<text>The Chavín culture was a pre-Columbian civilization, developed in the northern Andean highlands of Peru around 900 BCE, ending around 250 BCE. It extended its influence to other civilizations along the Peruvian coast. The Chavín people (whose name for themselves is unknown) were located in the Mosna Valley where the Mosna and Huachecsa rivers merge. This area is above sea level and encompasses the &quot;quechua&quot;, &quot;suni&quot;, and &quot;puna&quot; life zones.
In the periodization of pre-Columbian Peru, the Chavín is the main culture of the Early Horizon period in highland Peru, characterized by the intensification of the religious cult, the appearance of ceramics closely related to the ceremonial centers, the improvement of agricultural techniques and the development of metallurgy and textiles.

The best-known archaeological site for the Chavín culture is Chavín de Huántar, located in the Andean highlands of the present-day Ancash Region. Although Chavín de Huántar may or may not have been the center or birthplace of the Chavín culture, it was of great importance and has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

== Achievements ==

The chief example of architecture is the &quot;Chavín de Huántar&quot; temple. The temple&#x27;s design shows complex innovation to adapt to the highland environments of Peru. To avoid the temple&#x27;s being flooded and destroyed during the rainy season, the Chavín people created a successful drainage system. Several canals built under the temple acted as drainage. The Chavín people also showed advanced acoustic understanding. During the rainy season water rushes through the canals and creates a roaring sound that emulates a jaguar, a sacred animal. The temple was built of white granite and black limestone, neither of which is found near the Chavín site. This meant that leaders organized many workers to bring the special materials from far away rather than use local rock deposits. They also may have been traded from different civilizations in the area.

The Chavín culture also demonstrated advanced skills and knowledge in metallurgy, soldering, and temperature control. They used early techniques to develop refined gold work. The melting of metal had been discovered at this point and was used as a solder. Furthermore, the people domesticated camelids such as llamas. Camelids were used for pack animals, for fiber, and for meat. They produced &quot;ch&#x27;arki&quot;, or llama jerky. This product was commonly traded by camelid herders and was the main economic resource for the Chavín people. The Chavín people also successfully cultivated several crops, including potatoes, quinoa, and maize. They developed an irrigation system to assist the growth of these crops.

==Language==
There is an absence of written language, so the language spoken by the Chavín people is not known, but it is likely now extinct. Some anthropologists have proposed that it was a form of Proto-Quechuan, reasoning that the Quechuan languages&#x27; highly regular morphology and syntax compared to surrounding languages would have been useful for allowing intelligible communication between communities separated by mountain ranges, as some Chavín groups were. On the other hand, Alfredo Torero dates the Proto-Quechuan languages to around the beginning of the first millennium CE when the first Chavín people had a religion.

== Architecture ==
Chavín de Huántar was the place of origin of the second large-scale political entity in the central Andes, and this is mainly due to the extensive architecture at the site as well as the architecture is considered an engineering accomplishment. The site uses both internal and external architecture. Internal architecture refers to galleries, passageways, rooms, staircases, ventilation shafts, and drainage canals. External architecture refers to plazas, platform mounds, and terraces. Construction of the &quot;Old Temple&quot; took place from around 900 to 500 BCE, and construction of the &quot;New Temple&quot;, the structure that was constructed and added on to the &quot;Old Temple&quot;, took place from around 500 to 200 BCE. The lack of residential structures, occupational deposits, generalized weaponry, and evidence of storage further make the site&#x27;s architecture more interesting, as it focuses mainly on the temples and what lies inside of them.

The monumental center at Chavín de Huántar was built in at least 15 known phases, all of which incorporate the 39 known episodes of gallery construction. The earliest known construction stage, the Separate Mound Stage, consisted of separate buildings and do not conform, necessarily, to the U-shaped pattern seen in the Initial Horizon Period and the Early Horizon Period. During the Expansion Stage, construction integrated stepped platforms and created contiguous U-shaped form by connecting the buildings, which now surround open spaces. At this stage, galleries are elaborate in form and features. During the Black and White Stage, all known plazas (the Plaza Mayor, Plaza Menor, and the Circular Plaza) were constructed. As construction came to an end, galleries took on a more standardized look. By the end of the growth process, buildings become plazas with a U-shaped arrangement and an east-west axis bisecting the enclosed space. The axis also intersects the Lanzón.

Modifications were done during all stages of construction to maintain access to the internal architecture of the site. There was a high level of interest in maintaining access to internal architecture and sacred elements of the site. The internal architecture was constructed as part of a single design and was intricately incorporated with the external architecture. Including lateral and asymmetrical growth allowed for these sacred elements to remain visible, including the Lanzón.

The Lanzón Gallery was created from an earlier freestanding structure that was then transformed into a stone-roofed internal space by constructing around it. The Lanzón was possibly present before the roofing, as it is likely that the Lanzón predates the construction of mounds and plazas. In general, galleries follow construction patterns, which indicates a massive effort in design and planning. Maintaining these galleries over time was important to architects. The galleries are known to be windowless, dead ends, sharp turns and changes in floor height, all of which were designed to disorient people walking in them.

A combination of symmetry and asymmetry was used in the design and planning of the site construction, and in fact, guided the design. There were centered placements of staircases, entrances, and patios, all of which were consistently prominent. In the last stages of construction, due to constraints, centeredness was no longer possible, so architects shifted to constructing symmetrical pairs. Externally, buildings were asymmetrical to each other.

The primary construction materials used were quartzite and sandstone, white granite, and black limestone. Alternate coursing of quartzite was used in the major platforms, while white sandstone and white granite were used interchangeably in the architecture, and were almost always cut and polished. Granite and black-veined limestone were the raw materials used in almost all of the engraved lithic art at the site. Granite was also used extensively in the construction of the Circular Plaza.

Stone-faced platform mounds at the site were made using an orderly fill of rectangular quartzite blocks in leveled layers. Platforms were built directly on top of fallen wall stones from earlier constructions, as there was little to no attempt to remove debris.

== Art ==

The Chavín culture represents the first widespread, recognizable artistic style in the Andes. Chavín art can be divided into two phases: The first phase corresponding to the construction of the &quot;Old Temple&quot; at Chavín de Huántar (c. 900–500 BCE); and the second phase corresponding to the construction of Chavín de Huántar&#x27;s &quot;New Temple&quot; (c. 500–200 BCE).

Chavín art is known for its complex iconography and its &quot;mythical realism&quot;. There is constant evidence within all types of art (ceramics, pottery, sculptures, etc.) of human-animal interactions, which was reflective of societal interconnections and how the Chavín people viewed themselves connected with &quot;the other world&quot;.

Some other iconography found in Chavín art continues to give a glimpse as to what the culture was like, such as the general evidence of the use of psycho-active plants in ritual. The San Pedro Cactus is often seen on various art forms, sometimes being held by humans, which is used as evidence to support the use of the plant. The stone sculpture stela of the cactus bearer shows an anthropomorphized being with serpent hair, a mouth with fangs, a belt with a two-headed serpent and claws, who in their right hand holds what appears to be a San Pedro cactus.

A general study of the coastal Chavín pottery with respect to shape reveals two kinds of vessels: a polyhedral carved type and a globular painted type. Stylistically, Chavín art forms make extensive use of the technique of contour rivalry. The art is intentionally difficult to interpret and understand, since it was intended only to be read by high priests of the Chavín cult, who could understand the intricately complex and sacred designs. The Raimondi Stele is one of the major examples of this technique. Ceramics, however, do not appear to represent the same stylistic features that are found on sculptures.

Chavín art decorates the walls of the temple and includes carvings, sculptures and pottery. Artists depicted exotic creatures found in other regions, such as jaguars and eagles, rather than local plants and animals. The feline figure is one of the most important motifs seen in Chavín art. It has an important religious meaning and is repeated on many carvings and sculptures. Eagles are also commonly seen throughout Chavín art. There are three important artifacts which are the major examples of Chavín art. These artifacts are the Tello Obelisk, tenon heads, and the Lanzón.

Tello Obelisk is a vertical, rectangular shaft with a step-like notch at the top. The obelisk is carved in relief on all four sides and consists of two representations of a single-type creature. The head, body and tail occupy one or the other broad sides, while the legs, genitalia and other subsidiary elements occupy the narrow sides. These creatures have been interpreted as a &quot;cat-dragon&quot; type of creature (by Tello) and as a cayman (by Rowe and Lathrop). The large artifact may portray a creation myth.

Tenon heads are found throughout Chavín de Huántar and are one of the most well-known images associated with the Chavín civilization. Tenon heads are massive stone carvings of fanged jaguar heads which project from the tops of the interior walls.

Possibly the most impressive artifact from Chavín de Huántar is the Lanzón. The Lanzón is a 4.53-meter-long carved granite shaft displayed in the temple. The shaft extends through an entire floor of the structure and the ceiling. It is carved with an image of a fanged deity, a recurring image throughout the Chavín civilization. The Lanzón is found in a gallery inside of the Old Temple. The sculpture is enhanced by the four openings of the chamber it lies in, making it so that it allows only partial and segmented views. In rollout drawings, the figures depicted are coherent to interpreters, but it&#x27;s important to note that this is not how the Lanzón is meant to be seen.

== Sphere of influence ==
The Chavín culture had a wide sphere of influence throughout surrounding civilizations, especially because of their location at a trade crossing point between the deserts and Amazon jungle. For example, Pacopampa, located north (about a 3-week trek) of Chavín de Huántar, has renovations on the main temple that are characteristic of Chavín culture. Caballo Muerto, a coastal site in the Moche Valley region, has an adobe structure created during renovation of the main temple, the adobe related to Chavín influence. Garagay, a site in the modern-day Lima region, has variations of the characteristic Chavín iconography, including a head with mucus coming from the nostrils. At the site of Cerro Blanco, in the Nepena valley, excavations revealed Chavín ceramics.

Warfare does not seem to have been a significant element in Chavín culture. The archaeological evidence shows a lack of basic defensive structures in Chavín centres, and warriors are not depicted in art, in notable contrast to the earlier art at Cerro Sechín. Effective social control may have been exercised by religious pressure, and the ability to exclude dissidents from managed water resources. The climate and terrain of the neighbouring areas outside the managed land were a daunting option for farmers wishing to flee the culture. Evidence of warfare has been found only in contemporaneous sites that were not influenced by Chavín culture, almost as if those other civilizations were defending themselves via warfare from Chavín cultural influence.

Chavín culture as a style, and probably as a period, was widespread, stretching from Piura on the far north coast to Paracas on the south coast; and from Chavín in the north highlands to Pucará in the south highlands.

== Chavín horizon development ==

Some scholars argued that the development of Chavín social complexities coincided with the cultivation of maize and development of agricultural surpluses. Through an analysis of carbon isotope in the human bones found at Chavín sites, researchers have proved that the diet consisted mainly of C3 foods such as potatoes and quinoa, while maize, a C4 food, was not a part of the main diet. Potato and quinoa were crops better adapted to the Chavín environment. They are more resistant to the frost and irregular rain fall associated with high-altitude environments. Maize would not have been able to thrive in such conditions.

===Pre-Chavín levels===
The Kotosh Religious Tradition preceded the Chavín culture at various sites. Some Kotosh elements show links with the Chavín culture, such as for example the ceramic styles.

Prior to Kotosh was the Wairajirca Period. This is when the first pottery appeared. The Mito tradition was even earlier. This was a preceramic tradition. Nevertheless, public buildings were constructed.

===Chavín levels===
The Chavín culture archaeological horizon, itself, has three ceramic stages. They were originally identified through stratified ceramics and encompass three stages of development for the Chavín culture.
*&quot;Urabarriu&quot;, the first stage, extends from 900 to 500 BCE. During this time at Chavín de Huántar, two small residential areas, not located directly surrounding the ceremonial center, housed a few hundred people in total. This phase showed the greatest animal diversity. The people hunted mainly deer and began to hunt and use camelids. They ate clams and shellfish from the Pacific Ocean, as well as guinea pigs and birds. Chavín people grew some maize and potatoes during this phase. The ceramics in the Urabarriu stage are highly influenced by other cultures. The archeological evidence suggests dispersed centers of production for ceramics, probably in response to a low demand from the dispersed population.
* The &quot;Chakinani&quot;, 500 to 400 BCE, is a short time of transition in Chavín culture. During this time the residents migrated to surround the ceremonial center. The Chavín began to domesticate the llama and reduced deer hunting. Evidence of increased exchange with outside civilizations is also seen at this time.
* The &quot;Jarabarriu&quot;, the final stage of the Chavín Horizon, lasted from about 400 to 250 BCE. Chavín culture had a dramatic increase in population. The settlement pattern changed to a proto-urban pattern, consisting of a center of lowland valley peoples and smaller satellite communities in the surrounding higher altitude areas. The culture showed specialization and social differentiation. The people who lived in the east at Chavín de Huántar are thought to have had lower prestige than the communities around the ceremonial center. A diverse and intense production of ceramics is suggested during the Jarabarriu phase, when the valley was heavily populated and the ceramic style more defined. Satellite communities also developed centers of production during this phase.

== Presence of elite ==
At Chavín, power was legitimized through the belief in the small elite having a divine connection; shamans derived power and authority from their claim to a divine connection. The community believed in and had a desire to connect with the divine. With asymmetrical power, there is often evidence of the manipulation of traditions.

Strategic manipulation is a vehicle of change which shamans could use to produce authority. During the Chavín horizon, large changes were taking place.

&quot;The greater degree of elaboration of persuasion evident in the rites, materials, and settings of the belief system, the more likely that not only were the leaders aware of being self-serving in their actions but also they were actually conscious of the trajectory change.&quot; The archeological evidence shows several examples of reinterpretation, use of psychotropic drugs, and landscape altering. It also shows the complex planning and construction of stone-walled galleries.

The concept of invented tradition refers to a situation in which outside elements are newly brought together to depict a seemingly old tradition. This can be seen generally in the architecture at Chavín de Huántar, which bring together many aspects of outside cultures to create a unique new, yet traditional appearance.

The use of psychotropic drugs introduces a medium for manipulation. Only indirect evidence supports the use of psychotropic drugs, as noted above. Scholars have not been able to determine if the San Pedro cactus was ingested, who consumed the cactus: only the shaman elite, or more widespread among the masses. If the masses were taking the cactus, they would be more susceptible to the influences of the shamans. If the shamans were the only ones to consume it, the practice may have been sacred and a status symbol. The shamans would be perceived to have special powers to connect with nature and the divine.

The extensive degree of landscape altering at Chavín de Huántar for temple reconstructions shows that someone or a group of people had the power to plan the reconstructions and influence others to carry out those plans. The large constructions that occurred at this site support the hypothesis of asymmetrical power.

Finally, the planning and construction of the stone-walled galleries, in particular, suggest a hierarchical system. In addition to the requirement to command and direct the manpower required, the galleries show unique planning. They allowed only one entrance; this is atypical of the time when rooms commonly had multiple entrances and exits. The iconography on the walls of the stone galleries is highly complex. The complexity suggests that only a select few people were able to understand the iconography; such people would serve as translators for the few others who were privileged to view the stone galleries. The limited access, both physically and symbolically, of the stone-walled galleries, supports the existence of a shaman elite at Chavín de Huántar. The evolution of authority at Chavín appears to have resulted from a planned strategy by the shamans and those who planned and constructed the ceremonial center.

== Religion and ritual ==

Religion and the practices which followed had a deeper connection to the sociopolitical and economic aspects within the Chavín society. Ritual activity for the Chavín is not fully understood, but a great understanding of the overall ritual influence and impact that ritual had on the Chavín is more evident through their architectural structures, offering deposits, and artistic remains, mainly through pictographic displays. Over time, the effects of ritual moved to be more intimate and exclusive, as evident with the use and development of ritual space and architecture. Religious figures played a large role in how the site was designed and how rituals were oriented.

=== Sacred spaces: ritual architecture ===
The overall architecture at Chavín had religious influence and significance. The sacred spaces and structures within this society were evident to have ritualistic and potentially religious purposes. Understanding how the site of Chavin de Huántar is designed allows modern individuals to recognize how the site reflects intentionality of the builders to relay a specific experience. The site was considered to be sensory, meaning that the architectural structure and design elicited a certain feeling through the senses, through sight and touch. It is perception, which is essentially a series of physiological responses. Sacred spaces, such as plazas, were designed to mainly disrupt visual impact, meaning that the sacred architecture was designed to be experienced more so than actually viewed. People who designed and built the architecture at Chavín are understood to be priests or religious leaders within the community. Configuration of the site also emphasizes that there was a presence of high-ranked officials. 
The architecture within Chavín was dictated by these individuals to keep the ritual elements of their culture prominent. This was done so through the details and formatting of each building, which in essence created the effect that those participating in the ritual were experiencing their religious phenomena. Construction of the sacred ritual spaces was done with a diverse labor pattern and no central authority was controlling the area during its actual construction. The ritual architecture of the Chavín is similar to other Andean coastal architecture. 

The earliest architectural forms on the site were plastered, rectangular chambers. One of these later housed the Lanzon. The architecture of the Chavín site allowed for a rich and diverse ritual practice within the ritualized spaces, leading scholars to speculate whether or not the Chavín served as a multi-ethnic ceremonial center; the architecture, materials, and offerings might have been inspired by other cultures, but there is a question as to whether or not it was symbolic of a greater diverse ritual practice. The ritual spaces themselves had a hierarchy, and legitimized and reflected cosmological and social order and structure.

The Chavín buildings and spaces used for ritual were constructed to elicit an experience, and encompassed many of the overall architectural facets described previously. Two of the most well-noted ritual spaces include the Old Temple and New Temple, with a shift to the New Temple as time progressed. Both temples featured pathways and deity worship spaces on the north and south wings. In addition to this, the temples, most notably the Old Temple, had deities carved into stone. The temples were conformed into a U-shaped area, encompassing a circular plaza. The temples featured ceremonial chambers and sacred hearths. Another important structure designed and utilized for ritual included plazas, of which there were many. The Circular Plaza in particular and the Square Plaza were two of the sites primarily focused around ceremonial activity.

Within the Chavín site was a structure which revealed rooms and galleries, speculated by archaeologists to be used as “ritual chambers” for a variety of ceremonies, including what could have been a ceremony surrounding fire. Major use of underground space in the form of stone-lined galleries that are often like labyrinths and run through the monuments’ major platforms and mounds has been speculated to be a center for religious activity where ceremonies occurred in several different contexts involving both audiences and participants.

The open spaces of plazas versus the small restricted spaces of Chavín galleries in the temple shows that there is a progression of how the ritual spaces and architecture was used, moving more from public to private practice. The gallery spaces are central to understanding the implications of the Chavín ritual practices.

In fact, these underground galleries were more than just a place of ritual. As was recently discovered in 2018 by a team of archaeologists led by John Rick, through the use of all-terrain robots, these galleries were the final resting place for, presumably, the temple&#x27;s builders. The men&#x27;s bodies weren&#x27;t buried in a very honorable way: they were face-down, covered by rocks. John Rick raised the possibility, yet to be confirmed, that these people could very well have been sacrificed. This discovery shed some light as to where the people of Chavín buried their dead, although there might be other burial sites, as the director for the excavation said that he doesn&#x27;t believe it was customary to bury them in those galleries, just that it sometimes happened. If it becomes known, through the study of the remains, that they were indeed sacrificed, it could also serve to prove the theory that the galleries were a place of ritual, but for now, we can only know for sure that it was the final resting place for the men who built the temple.

The sizes of the spaces in the sacred spaces provided different amounts of room for people to congregate. External spaces such as the plazas had the ability to hold more individuals for ritual practices. The Square Plaza could have held 5,200 individuals. The Circular Plaza could have held around 600 individuals. Internal spaces within the temples, for example the galleries or hallways, could have only held a small number. Within the Lanzon gallery in the Old Temple, only around 15 people could have attended a ceremony, and within the canal entries only 2 to 4 people could have witnessed the ceremony.

=== Practices and ceremonies ===
Ritualistic activity for Chavín is not necessarily original; it has deep roots connected to activities from other (Andean civilisations|Andean) societies and cultures. The rituals in the space might have been indicative of the other diverse practices that took place at that time.

The want for more followers extended more deeply than numbers, but rather the Chavín wanted to establish a central authority as well as socially integrate diverse societies. Ritual practice at this time evolved and showed evidence of both public and private religion, and showed an increased distance between participants and observers in public ceremonies. Participants are termed in the archaeology community as visitors to the site. The transition was not immediate, as ancient practices were highly appealed to frequently as rituals progressed.

There is debate as to whether or not the Chavín practices were more hierarchical or hierarchical. It is believed by archaeologists that for the Chavín to have the most successful and impact rituals, they must be more condensed and more private in their nature. But other evidence shows that central areas reflected the lack of hierarchy in ritual practice, and that the society utilised the open spaces to better demonstrate a more inclusive religious experience. This demonstrates that ritual practice might have been hierarchical or hierarchical, and reflects back to the ideas of their exclusivity with other religious institutions, rituals, and traditions. Regardless, it is understood and well accepted that the Chavin were inclusive in their ritual practices.

Important aspects of Chavín ritual activity and practice have been discovered to be processions, offerings of different materials (exotic and valuable), and the use of water. One of these offerings can be connected to the smashed pieces of obsidian found along with fragments of mirror. Other ceremonial acts for the Chavín included the smashing of pots and ceremonies surrounding the use of fire, held within certain areas of the Chavín site as a part of their ritual. Artefacts in the temples relay the ritual practice of offerings. Ceramics, for example, were believed to be offerings brought by the pilgrims. Another artefact was a conch shell, used as a trumpet. Art suggests that processions were essential to disclosing that processions were an important part of Chavín ritual. Other ritual practices were produced by the shamans, such as divination, celestial observations, calendar calculations, health, and healing.

One other ritualistic element included the use of psychotropic drugs through mescaline containing cacti. The cacti provided a psychedelic drug that caused a lot of sensory overloads. It has been displayed in art, specifically ashlar blocks with costumed figures in procession carrying the cacti. Ritual evidence in the architectural remains shows that there was paraphernalia for grinding and ingesting snuff. Artistic evidence shows that certain drawings were done by shamans whilst under the influence of the psychedelic drugs.

Music also played a role in Chavín ritual. Strombus shell trumpets were found at Chavín sites. Trumpets were stored underground and it is believed that they were used by ritual practitioners, who would use them and play in procession through the underground galleries.

=== Religious art ===

Religious art is reflective of the landscape around the Chavín and everyday experiences they lived through, including that which can be affiliated with religious practices. Art implied that there were certain deities within the Chavín culture, as well as symbols indicative of ritualistic activities. Lithic art, for example, indicates that processions were important to Chavín ritual. Other artistic expressions included images of jaguars and hybrid humans with felines, avians, and crocodilian features. These in particular are done through artistic interpretations and were believed to have been done by shamans under the influence of the psychedelic drugs. In addition to animals, art reflected plant life, including images of the cacti used as a psychedelic drug.

=== Deities ===
Deities were an important element in Chavín religious practice. Most important to the Chavín was the Lanzón, the most central deity in Chavín culture, making the Lanzón central to religious practices. It is believed to be a founding ancestor who had oracle powers. The statue of the Lanzón was carved into a large stone and was found within the Old Temple. It was originally in the rectangular chamber, and is considered to be the focal point of the Old Temple. It is carved out of stone and stands at 4.5 meters tall. The Lanzón is also represented in the New Temple. Other deities reflected the landscape around the Chavín, including animals in nature and the cosmos, and included figures such as crested eagles, hawks, serpents, crocodiles (caymans), and jaguars. They were intermingled with human aspects, becoming more of a hybrid. The Chavín were also interested in binaries and manipulating them, such as showing men and women, the sun and moon, and the sky and water in the same image.

=== Religious figures ===
Religious figures played a role in the Chavín religious ritual. In general, individuals higher up in the societal hierarchy had control over the management of the ritual activities and brought the Chavín ritual into the society. Shamans are most commonly understood to be the primary religious figure. Leaders managed daily secular functioning, and it corresponded with authority figures leading from a small group, rather than having one individual as the head figure. They lived close to the temple in residential buildings. Leaders demonstrated skills in understanding the supernatural world with the ability to manipulate it, thus making them stand out to be a religious figure.

<doc id="1227309" wikidata="Q1752350" url="?curid=1227309" title="Summary execution">
<text>In civil and military jurisprudence, summary execution is the putting to death of a person accused of a crime without the benefit of a free and fair trial. The term results from the legal concept of summary justice to punish a summary offense, as in the case of a drumhead court-martial, but the term usually denotes the &quot;summary execution&quot; of a sentence of death. Under international law, it is a combatant&#x27;s refusal to accept an opponent&#x27;s lawful surrender and the combatant&#x27;s provision of no quarter, by killing the surrendering opponents.

Summary executions have been practiced by police, military, and paramilitary organizations and are frequently associated with guerrilla warfare, counter-insurgency, terrorism, and any other situation which involves a breakdown of the normal procedures for handling accused prisoners, civilian or military.

==Military jurisdiction==

Under military law, summary execution is illegal in almost all circumstances, as a military tribunal would be the competent judge needed to determine guilt and declare a sentence of death. However, there are certain exceptions to this rule in emergencies and warfare where summary execution is legal.

===Prisoners of war===

Major treaties such as the Geneva Conventions and Hague Conventions, and customary international law from history, protect the rights of captured regular and irregular enemy soldiers, along with civilians of enemy states. Prisoners-of-war (POWs) must be treated in carefully defined ways which definitively ban summary execution, as the Second Additional Protocol of the Geneva Conventions (1977) states:

===Exceptions to prisoners-of-war status===

However, some classes of combatants may not be accorded POW status, but that definition has broadened to cover more classes of combatants over time. In the past, summary execution of pirates, spies, and francs-tireurs have been performed and considered legal under existing international law. Francs-tireurs (a term originating in the Franco-Prussian War) are enemy civilians or militia who continue to fight in territory occupied by a warring party and do not wear military uniforms, and may otherwise be known as guerrillas, partisans, insurgents, etc. Though they could be legally jailed or executed by most armies a century ago, the experience of World War II influenced nations occupied by foreign forces to change the law to protect this group. Many of the post-war victors, such as France, Poland, and the USSR, had the experience of resistance fighters being summarily executed by the Axis if they were captured. The war also influenced them to make sure that commandos and other special forces who were caught deep behind enemy lines would be protected as POWs, rather than summarily executed as Hitler decreed through his 1942 Commando Order.
The Commando Order was issued by Adolf Hitler on October 18, 1942, stating that all Allied commandos encountered by German forces in Europe and Africa should be killed immediately without trial, even in proper uniforms or if they attempted to surrender. Any commando or small group of commandos or a similar unit, agents and saboteurs not in proper uniforms who fell into the hands of the German military forces by some means other than direct combat (through the police in occupied territories, for instance) were to be handed over immediately to the Sicherheitsdienst (SD, Security Service). The order, which was issued in secret, made it clear that failure to carry out such orders by any commander or officer would be considered to be an act of negligence punishable under German military law. This was in fact the second &quot;Commando Order&quot;, the first being issued by Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt on July 21, 1942, stipulating that parachutists should be handed over to the Gestapo. Shortly after World War II, at the Nuremberg Trials, the Commando Order was found to be a direct breach of the laws of war, and German officers who carried out illegal executions under the Commando Order were found guilty of war crimes.

According to Article 4 of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949, irregular forces are entitled to prisoner of war status if they are commanded by a person responsible for the subordinates, have a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance, carry arms openly, and conduct their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war. If they do not meet all of those conditions, they may be considered &quot;francs-tireurs&quot; (in the original sense of &quot;illegal combatant&quot;) and punished as criminals in a military jurisdiction, which may include summary execution.

Soldiers who are wearing uniforms of the opposing army &quot;after the start of combat&quot; may be considered illegal combatants and subject to summary execution. Many armies have performed that kind of false flag ruse in the past, including both German and US special forces during World War II. However, if soldiers remove their disguises and put on proper insignia &quot;before the start of combat&quot; in such an operation, they are considered legal combatants and must be treated as prisoners of war (POWs) if captured. That distinction was settled by a military tribunal in the postwar trial of Otto Skorzeny, who led Operation Greif, an infiltration mission in which German commandos wore US uniforms to infiltrate US lines during the Battle of the Bulge.

===Under martial law===

Within a state&#x27;s policy, martial law may be declared in emergencies such as invasions or insurrections, and in such a case constitutionally protected rights would be suspended. Depending on a state&#x27;s interpretation of martial law, this may allow police or military forces to decide and carry out punishments that include death on its own citizens, in order to restore lawful authority or for other vital reasons.

That would not include killing a suspect who is directly endangering another&#x27;s life, which is always legal for police, but executing a suspect under one&#x27;s control as a punishment. Proving that a summary execution fell under the legal exception would be exceptionally difficult, as one would have to show why a judgment and sentence of death absolutely needed to be meted out on the spot. Hence, such extraordinary acts are almost always seen as illegal violations of human rights.

<doc id="1227310" wikidata="Q2071310" url="?curid=1227310" title="Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy">
<text>Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is an endoscopic medical procedure in which a tube (PEG tube) is passed into a patient&#x27;s stomach through the abdominal wall, most commonly to provide a means of feeding when oral intake is not adequate (for example, because of dysphagia or sedation). This provides enteral nutrition (making use of the natural digestion process of the gastrointestinal tract) despite bypassing the mouth; enteral nutrition is generally preferable to parenteral nutrition (which is only used when the GI tract must be avoided). The PEG procedure is an alternative to open surgical gastrostomy insertion, and does not require a general anesthetic; mild sedation is typically used. PEG tubes may also be extended into the small intestine by passing a jejunal extension tube (PEG-J tube) through the PEG tube and into the jejunum via the pylorus.

PEG administration of enteral feeds is the most commonly used method of nutritional support for patients in the community. Many stroke patients, for example, are at risk of aspiration pneumonia due to poor control over the swallowing muscles; some will benefit from a PEG performed to maintain nutrition. PEGs may also be inserted to decompress the stomach in cases of gastric volvulus.

==Indications==
Gastrostomy may be indicated in numerous situations, usually those in which normal (or nasogastric) feeding is impossible. The causes for these situations may be neurological (e.g. stroke), anatomical (e.g. cleft lip and palate during the process of correction) or other (e.g. radiation therapy for tumors in head &amp; neck region).

In certain situations where normal or nasogastric feeding is not possible, gastrostomy may be of no clinical benefit. In advanced dementia, studies show that PEG placement does not in fact prolong life. Instead, oral assisted feeding is preferable. Quality improvement protocols have been developed with the aim of reducing the number of non-beneficial gastrostomies in patients with dementia.

A gastrostomy can be placed to decompress the stomach contents in a patient with a malignant bowel obstruction. This is referred to as a &quot;venting PEG&quot; and is placed to prevent and manage nausea and vomiting.

A gastrostomy can also be used to treat volvulus of the stomach, where the stomach twists along one of its axes. The tube (or multiple tubes) is used for gastropexy, or adhering the stomach to the abdominal wall, preventing twisting of the stomach.

A PEG tube can be used in providing gastric or post-surgical drainage.

==Techniques==

Two major techniques for placing PEGs have been described in the literature.

The Gauderer-Ponsky technique involves performing a gastroscopy to evaluate the anatomy of the stomach. The anterior stomach wall is identified and techniques are used to ensure that there is no organ between the wall and the skin:
* digital pressure is applied to the abdominal wall, which can be seen indenting the anterior gastric wall by the endoscopist.
* transillumination (diaphanoscopy): the light emitted from the endoscope within the stomach can be seen through the abdominal wall.
* a small (21G, 40mm) needle is passed into the stomach before the larger cannula is passed.
An angiocath is used to puncture the abdominal wall through a small incision, and a soft guidewire is inserted through this and pulled out of the mouth. The feeding tube is attached to the guidewire and pulled through the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and out of the incision.

In the Russell introducer technique, the Seldinger technique is used to place a wire into the stomach, and a series of dilators are used to increase the size of the gastrostomy. The tube is then pushed in over the wire.

== Anesthetic management ==
There are several techniques such as moderate sedation with left transversus abdominis plane block, and moderate sedation with local anesthetic infiltration at feeding tube site.

==Contraindications==
As with other types of feeding tubes, care must be made to place PEGs into an appropriate population. The following are contraindications to PEG use:

===Absolute contraindications===
* Inability to perform an esophagogastroduodenoscopy
* Uncorrected coagulopathy
* Peritonitis
* Untreatable (loculated) massive ascites
* Bowel obstruction (unless the PEG is sited to provide drainage)

===Relative contraindications===
* Massive ascites
* Gastric mucosal abnormalities: large gastric varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy
* Previous abdominal surgery, including previous partial gastrectomy: increased risk of organs interposed between gastric wall and abdominal wall
* Morbid obesity: difficulties in locating stomach position by digital indentation of stomach and transillumination
* Gastric wall neoplasm
* Abdominal wall infection: increased risk of infection of PEG site
* Intra-abdominal malignancy with peritoneal involvement (tumor seeding into formed channel with subsequent failure)

===In advanced dementia===
The American Medical Directors Association, the American Geriatrics Society and the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine recommend against inserting percutaneous feeding tubes in individuals with advanced dementia and, instead, recommend oral assisted feedings. Artificial nutrition neither prolongs life nor improves its quality in patients with advanced dementia. It may increase the risk of the patient inhaling food, it does not reduce suffering, it may cause fluid overload, diarrhea, abdominal pain and local complications, and it can reduce the amount of human interaction the patient experiences.

==Complications==
* Surgical site infection around the gastrostomy site. Administration of intravenous antibiotics can reduce infection around the gastrostomy site. Prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav decreases the proportion of people developing MRSA infections compared with no antibiotic prophylaxis (in people without cancer) undergoing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion.
* Hemorrhage
* Gastric ulcer either at the site of the button or on the opposite wall of the stomach (&quot;kissing ulcer&quot;)
* Perforation of bowel (most commonly transverse colon) leading to peritonitis
* Puncture of the left lobe of the liver leading to liver capsule pain
* Gastrocolic fistula: this may be suspected if diarrhea appears a short time after feeding. In this case, the feed goes direct from stomach to colon (usually transverse colon)
* Gastric separation
* &quot;Buried bumper syndrome&quot; (the gastric part of the tube migrates into the gastric wall)

==Removal of PEG tubes==
===Indications===
* PEG tube no longer required (recovery of swallow after stroke or brain trauma, or after surgery or radiotherapy for head and neck cancer)
* Persistent infection of PEG site
* Failure, breakage or deterioration of PEG tube (a new tube can be sited along the existing track)
* &quot;Buried bumper syndrome&quot;

===Techniques===
PEG tubes with rigid, fixed &quot;bumpers&quot; are removed endoscopically. The PEG tube is pushed into the stomach so that part of the tube is visible behind the bumper. An endoscopy snare is then passed through the endoscope, and passed over the bumper so that the tube adjacent to the bumper is grasped. The external part of the tube is then cut, and the tube is withdrawn into the stomach, and then pulled up into the esophagus and removed through the mouth. The PEG site heals without intervention.

PEG tubes with a collapsible or deflatable bumper can be removed using traction (simply by pulling the PEG tube out through the abdominal wall).

==History==
The first percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy performed on a child was on June 12, 1979, at the Rainbow Babies &amp; Children&#x27;s Hospital, University Hospitals of Cleveland. Michael W.L. Gauderer, pediatric surgeon, Jeffrey Ponsky, endoscopist, and James Bekeny, surgical resident, performed the procedure on a -month-old child with inadequate oral intake. The authors of the technique, Michael W.L. Gauderer and Jeffrey Ponsky, first published the technique in 1980. In 2001, the details of the development of the procedure were published, the first author being the originator of the technique itself.

<text>Kendall Frederick McComas (October 29, 1916 – October 15, 1981) was an American child actor, notable for appearing as &quot;Breezy Brisbane&quot; in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies in 1932 and Mickey Rooney&#x27;s rival &quot;Stinky Davis&quot; in the Mickey McGuire series in 1929. He was a native of Holton, Kansas.

==Career==
Born in Holton, Kansas, McComas first appeared in the &quot;Mickey McGuire&quot; short subjects series as a member of Mickey McGuire&#x27;s gang and stayed throughout the series run in the silent era. He also played the role of Stinky Davis in some of the series&#x27; earliest sound shorts. In 1931, he joined the &quot;Our Gang&quot; series, first appearing in the 1932 Our Gang short &quot;Readin&#x27; and Writin&#x27;&quot;. McComas stayed with Our Gang for a full year and left the series after appearing in the 1932 short &quot;Birthday Blues&quot;.

Even though he was well into his teens during his &quot;Our Gang&quot; tenure, McComas was very short for his age and thus capably portrayed his grade-school-age character Brisbane aka Breezy. Breezy&#x27;s mother refers to him as &quot;Brisbane&quot; in the films &quot;Readin&#x27; and Writin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Spanky&quot;, the only shorts in which that name appears; the kids refer to him as &quot;Breezy,&quot; presumably as a nickname for Brisbane. However, the Leonard Maltin/Richard Bann book &quot;The Little Rascals: The Life &amp; Times of Our Gang&quot; lists his character as &quot;Breezy Brisbane,&quot; a name which does not appear in dialogue in any of the shorts in which McComas appears. However, right after getting expelled from school in &quot;Readin&#x27; and Writin&#x27;&quot;, Brisbane goes to the fishing hole, and begins mentally telling himself to &quot;Learn that poem&quot;. There, he refers to himself as &quot;Breezy&quot; when he thinks, &quot;You better get busy, Breezy, and study that poem.&quot;

In 1965, he left show business and became an electrical engineer at the U.S. Naval Weapons Center in China Lake, California and then an institutional mortgage-backed bond salesman under the name John Mandy.

==Death==
McComas committed suicide in a fit of depression two weeks before turning 65 when he was facing mandatory retirement from his job.

<text>The Retezat National Park () is a protected area located in the Retezat Mountains in Hunedoara county, Romania. Founded in 1935, it is the oldest national park in the country and categorized as a category II IUCN national park. 

Retezat is particularly notable for its biodiverse flora, with over 1,000 species of plants present within the park. It is also home to some of the last remaining pristine old-growth forests in Europe. Despite its protected status, recent decades have seen an increase in damaging activities such as logging and sheep-grazing in the park, as well as threats to its status as public property. 

== History ==
The Retezat region has been a subject of scientific interest, particularly with regard to its flora, since at least the early 19th century. During the 1930s, several scientific personalities like Alexandru Borza and Emil Racoviţă campaigned for the creation of nature reserves in the country. In 1935, the Tătărescu government set aside 100 square kilometers of the Retezat Mountains, creating the country&#x27;s first national park. It took four more years for legislation to be passed regarding the park&#x27;s status, paving the way for all future protected areas of Romania.

In 1979, UNESCO included the park in the Man and the Biosphere Program international network of biosphere reserves, while in 1993 it was included by the International Union for Conservation of Nature among its demonstration projects on sustainable rural development. In 2008 it was granted the European Diploma of Protected Areas.

Since the 1990s sheep grazing and logging increased considerably in the region, damaging the park&#x27;s natural capital. In the 21st century Retezat has been the subject of several ecological restoration efforts.

In 2006 the Romanian state decided in favor of heirs to the Austro-Hungarian aristocratic family Kendeffy, who claimed 10,000 hectares of land in the Retezat Mountains, including large tracts of the park, under a law allowing the restitution of property seized by previous regimes. The Romanian Academy, who was granted the land in the 1930s, challenged the decision. After a lengthy trial, the land restitution was deemed illegal by a 2022 court decision, and the park returned to being state property.
== Description ==
The park contains more than sixty peaks over and about eighty glacier lakes, of which 54 are permanent. Peleaga, the highest peak of the Retezat Mountains, is located in the park. Currently the park occupies .

== Flora ==
The flora of Retezat demonstrates &quot;exceptional biodiversity&quot;, consisting of approximately 1,190 plant species, of which 130 have the &quot;endangered&quot; or &quot;vulnerable&quot; status. More than a third of Romania&#x27;s flora can be found in this area. Mountain pine and juniper habitats are dominant, with spruce and rhododendron also common.

The park is often described as containing ”Europe&#x27;s last intact forest&quot;, as it harbors one of the few remaining intact old-growth forest landscapes and the largest single area of pristine mixed forest on the continent. The Gemenele (&quot;The Twins&quot; in Romanian) scientific reserve is a strictly protected area of the park enclosing 1,800 hectares of intact old-growth forest.

== Fauna ==

The gray wolf, brown bear, wild boar, Eurasian lynx, European wildcat, chamois, roe deer, red deer, Eurasian badger, Eurasian otter, stoat and the beech marten are among the 55 species of mammal that live in the park, almost a quarter of all mammals in Romania being represented here. The Alpine marmot was introduced in the scientific reserve in 1973 and has since spread to the rest of the park. An important center for bat conservation, Retezat is home to 13 species of the Chiroptera order, including the Greater horseshoe bat, Parti-coloured bat and the Soprano pipistrelle.

The park is also home to more than a hundred bird species, many of which are protected in Romania. Present species include the western capercaillie, common kingfisher, lesser spotted eagle, black grouse, short-toed snake eagle, Eurasian eagle-owl, corn crake, black woodpecker, peregrine falcon, collared flycatcher, and the golden eagle, which is depicted on the park&#x27;s logo. The park was included by BirdLife International among its Important Bird Areas.

Over 1000 species of butterflies were identified in the area, with the park containing two European Prime Butterfly Areas.

<doc id="1227317" wikidata="Q742593" url="?curid=1227317" title="Silver City (2004 film)">
<text>Silver City is a 2004 American political satire comedy-drama film written and directed by John Sayles. Chris Cooper portrays an inept Republican gubernatorial candidate, a character that was noted for similarities to U.S. President George W. Bush. The film&#x27;s large ensemble cast includes, among others, Richard Dreyfuss, Danny Huston, Michael Murphy, Maria Bello, Kris Kristofferson, Mary Kay Place, Thora Birch, Tim Roth, Billy Zane and Daryl Hannah.

The film is a &quot;murder mystery [linked] to a political satire&quot;; according to Sayles, it is &quot;about electoral politics, but also about the press.&quot;

==Plot==
Richard &quot;Dicky&quot; Pilager, the dim-witted scion of a powerful political dynasty, is running for Governor of Colorado. One day, while filming a campaign ad that shows him fishing at Arapahoe Lake, Pilager hooks a corpse on location. Chuck Raven, Pilager&#x27;s campaign manager, hires Danny O&#x27;Brien, a former journalist who works as a private investigator, to examine the case. Raven urges O&#x27;Brien to find potential links between the body and Pilager&#x27;s political enemies.

O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s job is essentially to intimidate Pilager&#x27;s opponents, and he has numerous revealing conversations with various people. He learns that business mogul Wes Benteen is using Pilager to promote his own agenda. The interviews also reveal further corruption: politicians, land developers, and mining companies are conspiring to ignore certain environmental issues. O&#x27;Brien also learns about illegal migrant workers, as well as a potentially damaging love affair.

==Cast==
* Chris Cooper as Richard &quot;Dicky&quot; Pilager. Dicky Pilager is the son of an influential Colorado Senator. He was not successful in a mining enterprise, so he has decided to run for Governor of Colorado. His campaign is largely funded by family friend Wes Benteen.
* Danny Huston as Danny O&#x27;Brien. A private investigator, Danny was a reporter for the &quot;Mountain Monitor&quot; newspaper before getting fired for reporting a false story. Now working for Chuck Raven, he is to intimidate anyone who might be trying to sabotage the Pilager campaign.
* Richard Dreyfuss as Chuck Raven, a campaign manager for Pilager. A lifelong family friend, he is in charge of protecting the family name. He hires Danny O&#x27;Brien in a stratagem to ensure the campaign won&#x27;t be tainted by political scandal.
* Kris Kristofferson as Wes Benteen. Benteen is the billionaire mogul who is funding the campaign. His businesses benefit the Pilager family in return for political favors. His companies produce meat and agricultural products and provide medical services. He also owns a major football team, the Prospectors. He finances half the campaign in order to secure land development rights.
* Maria Bello as Nora Allardyce, a reporter at the &quot;Mountain Monitor&quot; and Danny O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s ex-wife.

* David Clennon as Morton &quot;Mort&quot; Seymour, Grace&#x27;s husband and a real estate developer. He is trying to gain influence with the Pilagers thru Chandler Tyson, in order to obtain approval of his Silver City project.
* Tim Roth as Mitch Paine. Paine is Danny O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s friend, and a former reporter at the &quot;Mountain Monitor&quot; who was fired for the same reason as O&#x27;Brien. He runs an underground news website and is a source of information.
* Michael Murphy as Senator Judson Pilager, a powerful U.S. senator from Colorado and Dicky Pilager&#x27;s father. He constantly bemoans his son&#x27;s ineptness.
* Daryl Hannah as Madeline &quot;Maddy&quot; Pilager. Maddy is a free-spirited, black sheep daughter of the Pilager family. She is one of the people whom Danny must keep out of the public eye.

* Ralph Waite as Casey Lyle, a former mining safety inspector who was falsely caught up in a mining accident scandal. He is also &quot;warned&quot; by Danny.
* James Gammon as Sheriff Joe Skaggs, who Investigates the dead body found in the lake. His brother was being investigated by Danny in the story that got Danny fired.

* Maggie Roswell as Ellie Hastings, a member of the City Council.

==Reception==

===Box office and distribution===
&quot;Silver City&quot; had a limited release in the United States, where it was marketed as a comedy about an &quot;intellectually challenged, poorly spoken politician.&quot; Sayles commented on that marketing approach in an entertainment interview for CNN:

The film played in 162 theaters at its widest and earned US$1.4 million at the box office in Canada and the United States. It also earned around $300,000 from both Ireland and the United Kingdom.

===Critical response===
&quot;Silver City&quot; had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Market during the Cannes Film Festival. Critics noted the similarities between the fictitious Dicky Pilager and the real George W. Bush, with some also seeing parallels between the fictitious campaign manager and the real Karl Rove.

Roger Ebert praised the film, but said it likely wouldn&#x27;t change any votes in the 2004 election: &quot;America is familiar with the way [George W. Bush] talks, and about half of us are comfortable with it. That&#x27;s why &quot;Silver City&quot; may not change any votes. There is nothing in the movie&#x27;s portrait of Pilager/Bush that has not already been absorbed and discounted by the electorate.&quot;

Ruthe Stein called the film &quot;wildly uneven&quot; with &quot;dull&quot; stretches: &quot; . . but the movie comes alive when Cooper is in it, especially his scenes with Richard Dreyfuss as Dickie&#x27;s savvy campaign manager.&quot;

Caryn James called the film&#x27;s script and direction &quot;exhilarating&quot;, characterizing the film as &quot;a Bush-bashing work that is more than Bush-bashing&quot; which &quot;goes beyond election-year satire to reach broader themes of corporate power, campaign double talk and journalistic responsibility.&quot; She also called the film a &quot;detective story with a half-dozen major characters and a twisty &quot;Chinatown&quot; plot that begins when the environmentally hostile Dickie is filming an environmentally friendly campaign ad and fishes a corpse out of a river.&quot;

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 48% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 128 reviews. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Heavy-handed and often dull.&quot;

<text>In topology, a branch of mathematics, a manifold &quot;M&quot; may be decomposed or split by writing &quot;M&quot; as a combination of smaller pieces. When doing so, one must specify both what those pieces are and how they are put together to form &quot;M&quot;.

Manifold decomposition works in two directions: one can start with the smaller pieces and build up a manifold, or start with a large manifold and decompose it. The latter has proven a very useful way to study manifolds: without tools like decomposition, it is sometimes very hard to understand a manifold. In particular, it has been useful in attempts to classify 3-manifolds and also in proving the higher-dimensional Poincaré conjecture.

The table below is a summary of the various manifold-decomposition techniques. The column labeled &quot;M&quot; indicates what kind of manifold can be decomposed; the column labeled &quot;How it is decomposed&quot; indicates how, starting with a manifold, one can decompose it into smaller pieces; the column labeled &quot;The pieces&quot; indicates what the pieces can be; and the column labeled &quot;How they are combined&quot; indicates how the smaller pieces are combined to make the large manifold.

<doc id="1227330" wikidata="Q739663" url="?curid=1227330" title="Wally Albright">
<text>Wally Albright (born Walton Algernon Albright Jr.; September 3, 1925 - August 7, 1999) was an American actor, water sportsman, and businessman. As a child actor, he was best known for his role in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; film series.

==Career==
Albright was the son of Wally and Lois Albright. He was seen in a film with Gloria Swanson in 1928. He appeared in a number of films during his career, and is notable for appearing in six &quot;Our Gang&quot; short subjects throughout the early 1930s. Though his tenure with the gang was brief, his role was usually that of the gang leader alongside Matthew &quot;Stymie&quot; Beard.

Albright played so many roles as a baby that he was quite well-known by the time he was three. He appeared in the small parts of various films made by Hal Roach Studios. At the end of 1933, when Gus Meins took over directing, &quot;Our Gang&quot; needed a few new characters. Several older &quot;Our Gang&quot;ers left the series in the summer of 1933, including Dorothy DeBorba and Bobby &quot;Wheezer&quot; Hutchins.

Albright debuted in 1934 in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short &quot;Hi Neighbor&quot;. He ended up becoming one of the most prominent members of the gang. To the dismay of Hal Roach and director Gus Meins, Albright voluntarily left the gang and returned to a normal childhood life. However, he did play a small role in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, appearing as an older child in a migrant camp. In the movie, Albright’s character lies to Ma Joad about having good food when eating fried dough like every other migrant at the camp.

==Later years==
In adult life, Albright became a champion water sportsman and eventually operated a successful trucking firm, shipping produce. He died in Sacramento, California on August 7, 1999. He is buried in the Garden of Ascension at Forest Lawn, Glendale, California.

<text>Kincheloe Air Force Base was a United States Air Force (USAF) base during the Cold War. Built in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in 1943 during World War II, the base was in service 

The base was known by various names, including Kinross Municipal Airport, Kinross Army Air Field, Kinross Air Field, Kinross Air Force Auxiliary Field, and Kinross Air Force Base. The present-day Chippewa County International Airport, Kinross Correctional Facility, and the community of Kincheloe are located on the site of the base. The base was named for Iven Kincheloe a test pilot from Michigan.

==History==
=== Origins ===
During World War II, the Soo Locks were considered vital to the war efforts. An airport was planned in Kinross as early as June 1941. The airport was built by the United States Government through lease, license, easements and by fee of different tracts of land. A small airfield with three 5,520-foot x 300-foot runways was constructed in a triangle pattern with a small aircraft parking area and a few support buildings. The airfield was designated the Kinross Auxiliary Airfield, and was designated a Sub-Base of the Air Transport Command Alpena Army Airfield.

The mission of Kinross AAF was to serve as a refueling stop for aircraft headed for Alaska as well as to defend the locks of Sault Ste. Marie. However, no tactical units were assigned there during the war and the few support personnel who were stationed there were under the command of the 4250th Army Air Force Base Unit at Alpena AAF. The base was inactive beginning in 1945, and after the end of World War II, the airfield was leased to the City of Sault Ste. Marie for a civilian airport.

After the war, the airfield then served as a hub for private and commercial aviation. The city operated the airport and Capital Airlines and Trans-Canada Air Lines used it for commercial air service from 1945 to 1952.

===Air Defense Command===


With the outbreak of the Cold War in 1948 and active combat in the Korean War in June, 1950, the United States began building up its defenses. Army troops returned to the Sault, and the World War II Kinross Auxiliary Airfield, with its close proximity to the locks was reactivated using a right of return. On 1 July 1952, Kinross Air Force Base was transferred from civil control to the United States Air Force. It was placed under the jurisdiction of 30th Air Division, Air Defense Command and was planned as a fighter-interceptor base to provide air defense for Sault Ste Marie and the upper Great Lakes.

In October, 1952, the 4685th Air Base Squadron was assigned to the reactivated Kinross AFB. A month later the unit was redesignated as the 91st Air Base Squadron. Much construction was necessary to bring the World War II auxiliary airfield up to postwar USAF standards. Additional land surrounding the base was appropriated for military facilities and extended runways. A 7,000-foot jet runway (16/34) was laid down along with accompanying taxiways, concrete block buildings and other support facilities to replace the existing structures that were viewed as substandard for a permanent Air Force base.

On 16 February 1953, the first operational ADC unit, the 534th Air Defense Group was activated at Kinross AFB. It was assigned to the 4706th Defense Wing at O&#x27;Hare International Airport, Illinois. The 438th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was activated at the new base on 27 April, equipped with first-generation Lockheed F-94B Starfire jet interceptor aircraft. That same month, the base was closed to private noncommercial aviation because of the interceptor aircraft being flown off the field by the pilots of the 438th. The 438th FIS was upgraded quickly to new Northrop F-89D Scorpion interceptors as soon as they could be delivered and the F-94Bs were transferred to the Air National Guard.

Flying out of Kinross, On November 23, 1953, pilot Felix Moncla and Radar Operator Robert Wilson and their plane disappeared while pursuing a UFO over the Soo Locks and Lake Superior.

Kinross was considered a vital Air Defense Command base, an alert-status military base equipped with interceptors ready 24/7 to respond to unknown aircraft picked up by Ground Control Radar stations in the Great Lakes region. Upon activation, Kinross-based interceptors were directed to intercept unknown aircraft by ADC surveillance Radars at Sault Sainte Marie AFS (P-86); Grand Marais AFS (M-109); Calumet AFS (P-16); Alpena AFS (M-105) and Empire AFS (P-34).

On 18 August 1955, the 534th ADS was inactivated and immediately replaced by the 507th Fighter Group (Air Defense) in a name-only re-designation. This was part of the ADC &quot;Project Arrow&quot; program, which was designed to bring back on the active list the fighter units which had compiled memorable records in the two world wars. The 438th FIS was unaffected by this re-designation, and was transferred to the 507th FG. On 8 July 1956, command and control of the 507th FG was transferred to the 37th Air Division at Truax Field, Wisconsin. At that time, intercepts by the 507th FG were directed by a Manual Direction and Control Center (MDCC) (SM-168) at Truax Field which received radar data from a wider series of search and height surveillance radars in the Great Lakes Area. In May 1957, the 438th FIS was upgraded to the new Convair F-102 Delta Dagger interceptor.

In May 1958 the 438th FIS was temporarily transferred to K. I. Sawyer AFB southeast of Marquette, while the main runway at Kinross was extended to in preparation for Strategic Air Command (SAC) B-52 Stratofortresses. The construction project was completed and the squadron returned in October 1958.

====Kincheloe AFB====
On September 25, 1959, Kinross AFB was officially renamed Kincheloe Air Force Base in honor of the late Captain Iven Kincheloe, a native of Cassopolis in southwestern Michigan. On 7 September 1956, Kincheloe became the first pilot to climb above , as he rocketed to a peak altitude of in the Bell X-2 rocket-powered research airplane. For this spectacular flight, he was awarded the Mackay Trophy and nicknamed &quot;America&#x27;s No. 1 Spaceman.&quot; Less than two years later, he was killed in the crash of an F-104 Starfighter on 26 July 1958 at Edwards AFB, California.

The importance of Kincheloe AFB to ADC was evident in 1960 with some major changes. The 37th Air Defense Missile Squadron (BOMARC) was activated on 1 March 1960 with 28 CIM-10 Bomarc surface-to-air missiles (SAM). The supersonic Bomarc missiles were the first long-range anti-aircraft missiles in the world. They were capable of carrying conventional or nuclear warheads. The missile site was located at the World War II Raco Army Airfield, about 17 miles west-northwest of Kincheloe AFB. This facility was known as the Kincheloe AFB BOMARC site. The BOMARC site was a rectangular installation, just southeast of the old runways. It operated the 2nd-generation IM-99B version of the BOMARC missile. About 40 personnel were stationed at the BOMARC site. The missiles remained on alert until they were inactivated on 31 July 1972.

Next, Kincheloe AFB was assigned to the Sault Sainte Marie Air Defense Sector (SsmADS) at K. I. Sawyer AFB on 1 April 1960 and came under the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Data Center (DC-14). The SAGE system was a computer-controlled network linking USAF (and later FAA) General Surveillance Radar stations into a centralized center for Air Defense, intended to provide early warning and response for a Soviet nuclear attack.

The 438th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was upgraded again to the F-106 Delta Dart interceptor in June 1960, one of the first ADC squadrons to receive the new interceptor. In addition, the 507th Fighter Group was upgraded to the 507th Fighter Wing (Air Defense), which was established, and activated, on 28 December 1960. With the upgrade to wing level, the 507th Combat Support Group became the host unit at Kincheloe on 1 February 1961.

The 507th Fighter Wing continued to employ F-106 aircraft at Kincheloe AFB until its inactivation on Sep. 30, 1968. Air Defense Command inactivated its interceptor facilities due to budgetary reasons caused by the cost of the Vietnam War. By the late 1960s, and with the development of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM), it was believed that the chance of a Soviet bomber attack on the United States was remote and the USAF began closing fighter-interceptor bases at the direction of the Secretary of Defense. The BOMARC missiles were inactivated four years later in 1972.

As a result of the phase down, ADC moved the 438th Fighter Interceptor Squadron to Griffiss AFB, New York. With its inactivation, jurisdiction of Kincheloe AFB was transferred to Strategic Air Command on 1 October 1968.

===Strategic Air Command===

In the 1950s, the USAF adopted a policy of dispersing Strategic Air Command (SAC) bombers and tankers. At Kincheloe the runway was extended to 12,000 feet in 1958 to accommodate 15 B-52H bombers and ten KC-135 tankers. In addition to the runway, overruns of 1,000 feet (305 m) were constructed on both ends of the runway, along with 75-foot (23 m) shoulders on each side of the runway, providing a paved width of 300 feet (91 m). Along with the runway extension, a &quot;Christmas tree&quot; alert pad area was constructed on the north side of the runway end to accommodate alert aircraft, as well as a &quot;Mole hole&quot; crew living facility, where alert crews would live on shifts ready to man the alert aircraft and take off within a few minutes&#x27; notice. The original cost of the undertaking was estimated at $30 million.

On 2 February 1959, SAC established the 4239th Strategic Wing at Kincheloe AFB, Michigan as part of SAC&#x27;s plan to disperse its B-52 Stratofortress heavy bombers over a larger number of bases, thus making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to knock out the entire fleet with a surprise first strike.

In November, 1961, following two years of construction, the 4239th Strategic Wing of SAC arrived with B-52 bombers. On May 1, 1962, the SAC wing at Kincheloe was declared operationally ready. The wing consisted of the 93d Bombardment Squadron, consisting of 15 B-52Hs. Half of the aircraft were maintained on fifteen-minute alert, fully fueled, armed, and ready for combat. SAC Strategic Wings were considered a provisional unit by Headquarters, USAF and could not carry a permanent history or lineage.

In 1962, in order to retain the lineage of its MAJCOM 4-digit combat units and to perpetuate the lineage of many currently inactive bombardment units with illustrious World War II records, Headquarters SAC received authority from Headquarters USAF to discontinue its MAJCOM strategic wings that were equipped with combat aircraft and to activate AFCON units, most of which were inactive at the time which could carry a lineage and history.

The 4239th Strategic Wing was inactivated as the 449th Bombardment Wing (449 BW) was activated on 15 Nov 1962 and organized (i.e., the assignment of personnel &amp; equipment) on 1 February 1963, assigned to SAC&#x27;s Second Air Force, 40th Air Division. The 93 BS was also inactivated and replaced by the 716th Bombardment Squadron, one of the USAF&#x27;s historical World War II bomb squadrons, being activated on 15 Nov 1962 and organized on the same date as the 449th Bombardment Wing. The 908th Air Refueling Squadron (Heavy), was assigned and organized on 01 Jul 1963 and the 70th Munitions Maintenance Squadron designation was unchanged, and component support units (the 4239th / 449th Airborne Missile Maintenance Squadron; 4239th / 449th Armament &amp; Electronics Maintenance Squadron; 4239th / 449th Field Maintenance Squadron; and the 4239th / 449th Organizational Maintenance Squadron) underwent the same actions as the newly established wing.

On 1 Oct 1968, the 449th became the host unit assigned to Kincheloe AFB with the inactivations of the 507th Fighter Wing (Air Defense) and the activations &amp; Organizations of the 449th Combat Support Group, the 449th Civil Engineering Squadron, 449th Security Police Squadron, 449th Services Squadron, 449th Supply Squadron, and the 449th Transportation Squadron. As under the Tri-Deputate organization, all flying components were directly assigned to the wing, and no operational group element was activated. With the activation, the history, lineage and honors of the 449th Bombardment Group were bestowed upon the newly established wing upon activation.

The 449th and its subordinate units&#x27; mission was to operate at full readiness, and support activities included aircraft and vehicle maintenance, bombing crew and unit training, and air refueling support. The wing did deploy individual B-52 crews, but not its B-52H aircraft, to Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War, as the Kincheloe B-52Hs were strictly dedicated to SAC&#x27;s strategic deterrence mission. However, Kincheloe&#x27;s KC-135A tanker aircraft and aircrews participated in the &quot;Young Tiger&quot; TDY effort, and the bomber aircrews went through RTU training to fly older B-52Ds out of Andersen AFB, Guam and U-Tapao RTAFB, Thailand and were active participants in many of the notable campaigns that took place in Southeast Asia such as Arc Light, November 1965 – December 1975, and B-52 crews, May 1968 – June 1975. During Operation Linebacker II between 18 - 29 Dec 1972, one 449 BW crew was shot down.

On 30 November 1971, the 1883d Communications Squadron, reassigned from the 1964th Communications Group and the Vietnam War, moved to 
Kincheloe AFB and came under the command of the Northern Communications Area.

===Inactivation===
In December 1965, the Department of Defense announced a decision to close Kincheloe AFB by October 1971. The decision to close Kincheloe was part of a phase-down of the SAC B-52 bomber fleet as a result of the operational deployment of Minuteman ICBMs and the increasing cost of the Vietnam War that was stretching the Defense Budget. Political pressure in the U.S. Congress, however, led to the May 1971 decision to not close the base and it remained an active SAC installation. This was only a six-year reprieve, as the base was inactivated on 30 September 1977 as part of an ongoing Reduction in Force in the USAF following the end of the 

The B-52s and KC-135s of the 449th were reassigned to other SAC units, and the wing was inactivated on 30 September 1977, concurrently with the closure of On 1 October 1977 the 1883d Communications Squadron was moved to Beale AFB, California (Miller 1990).

==Current uses==
Portions of the base had already been transferred to local authorities, and following the deactivation all the remaining property was transferred, although the federal government reserved the right to have exclusive or non-exclusive use of the airport facilities during a declared national emergency.

Despite the loss of approximately 10,000 personnel living in the area, the base has been successfully redeveloped since closing. Chippewa County International Airport, Kinross Correctional Facility, Chippewa Correctional Facility, Kinross Manufacturing, American Kinross, Inc. and Rudyard Area Schools are now located on the property. In all, the local tax base had doubled, and the civilian payroll created by the new ventures had reached $110 million.

The base was used in the filming of the 1990 movie &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, starring Bruce Willis. Other scenes were shot at the Alpena Airport. The location was chosen in part because there was a need for snow, and the producers expected Alpena to produce. However, due to a lack of snowfall, artificial snow had to be used.

<text>The War Finance Corporation was a government corporation in the United States created to give financial support to industries essential for World War I, and to banking institutions that aided such industries. It continued to give support to various efforts during the interwar period. The corporation was created by a Congressional act of April 5, 1918, and abolished on July 1, 1939.

Since government borrowing to pay for the war had attracted a majority of private capital, little capital was available for corporations to borrow; the War Finance Corporation was established to make such capital available. After the armistice in late 1918, the Corporation assisted in the transition to peacetime by financing railroads under government control, and making loans to American exporters and agricultural cooperative marketing associations. The Corporation established agricultural loan agencies in farming areas, and cooperated with several livestock loan companies. Eugene Meyer, a wealthy and ambitious Wall Street financier, was its managing director.

<text>Jacklyn DeVon Taylor (June 29, 1925 – May 5, 2014), professionally known as Jackie Lynn Taylor, was an American child actress.

==Biography==
Jacklyn DeVon Taylor was born in Compton, California, and appeared in five &quot;Our Gang&quot; short subjects from 1934 to 1935. She often portrayed the sister or girlfriend of one of the boys, usually Wally Albright.

She joined KTTV in 1951 as the hostess of the first daily two-hour variety show in the Los Angeles area. For over ten years, she had the top-rated television show in the San Diego area. Her credits also include directing and producing television programs as well as performing in over 75 movies, numerous TV dramas and national commercials.

==Personal life==
In 1948, Taylor married Ben Bard, who was a movie actor, stage actor, and acting teacher. They divorced in 1954.

Taylor and her second husband, television producer/journalist Jack Fries, who were married for 48 years until her death, produced and co-hosted &quot;Little Rascals Family Theater&quot;, which aired in Southern California from the mid 1970s through the mid 1980s. Segments of the show, including interviews with several former Gang members as adults, are available on home video.
Jackie and Jack discussed bias in the news as well as Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Our Gang&quot; films. In 1975, they moved to Kansas City, Missouri, to study for the ministry. Jack was ordained in 1977, Jackie in 1979. They have served churches in St. Joseph and Kansas City (Missouri), San Juan Capistrano and San Diego (California), and Reno/Carson City (Nevada).

The couple retired in Sacramento. Both taught &quot;Voice Power Dynamics&quot; at Sierra College in Rocklin, California, operated their RascalandUSA.com website, and spoke before service clubs and civic organizations in Northern California. They were working on a joint autobiography, &quot;Suddenly It’s Tomorrow&quot;, which was to be released in late 2006. 

==Death==
Jackie Taylor Fries died from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on May 5, 2014, aged 88.

<doc id="1227347" wikidata="Q956224" url="?curid=1227347" title="Carotid sinus">
<text>In human anatomy, the carotid sinus is a dilated area at the base of the internal carotid artery just superior to the of the internal carotid and external carotid at the level of the superior border of thyroid cartilage. The carotid sinus extends from the bifurcation to the &quot;true&quot; internal carotid artery. The carotid sinuses are sensitive to pressure changes in the arterial blood at this level. They are two out of the four baroreception sites in humans and most mammals.

== Structure ==
The carotid sinus is the reflex area of the carotid artery, consisting of baroreceptors which monitor blood pressure.

== Function ==

The carotid sinus contains numerous baroreceptors which function as a &quot;sampling area&quot; for many homeostatic mechanisms for maintaining blood pressure. The carotid sinus baroreceptors are innervated by the carotid sinus nerve, which is a branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). The neurons which innervate the carotid sinus centrally project to the solitary nucleus in the medulla of the brainstem. The solitary nucleus indirectly modulates the activity of sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons in the medulla and pons through the hypothalamus. These neurons then regulate the autonomic control of the heart and blood vessels. The aortic arch baroreceptors are innervated by the aortic nerve (nerve of Cyon, Ludwig nerve), which combines with CN X (vagus nerve) and travels to the NTS.

==Clinical significance==
It is a sensitive site of the body because stimulation can drive large-scale reflex effects throughout the body. This can be used therapeutically in treatment of resistant hypertension by baroreflex activation. Physical assault at this point, producing massive baroreflex activation can cause dramatic falls in blood pressure and cerebral ischemia. This is the mechanism of baroreflex activation therapy.

===Disease===

The carotid sinus often has atherosclerotic plaques because of disturbed hemodynamics (low wall shear stress, flow reversal/recirculation). Since these plaques, if large and unstable, predispose to ischemic strokes and transient ischemic attacks, carotid endarterectomies are frequently done for prophylaxis.

==== Carotid sinus hypersensitivity ====
The carotid sinus baroreceptor can be oversensitive to manual stimulation from the pressure applied at the carotid sinus at the carotid bifurcation. It is a condition known as &#x27;carotid sinus hypersensitivity&#x27; (CSH), &#x27;carotid sinus syndrome&#x27; or &#x27;carotid sinus syncope&#x27;, in which manual stimulation causes large changes in heart rate and blood pressure, which can result in bradycardia, vasodilation, and hypotension. This classically presents as a patient who has &quot;fainted&quot; (actually a presyncope) on several occasions while shaving, or in some other way coming into contact with their carotid sinus. Denervation is performed as treatment for this.

Usually older patients with syncope and unexplained falls often have coexisting conditions such as carotid sinus hypersensitivity, orthostatic hypotension, and vasovagal syncope.

==== Carotid sinus syndrome ====
Carotid sinus syndrome (CSS) is a temporary loss of consciousness that sometimes accompanies convulsive seizures because of the intensity of the carotid sinus reflex when pressure builds in one or both carotid sinuses.

===Treatment of resistant hypertension===
Stimulation of baroreceptors at the carotid sinus can be used to treat resistant hypertension via activation of the baroreflex. A pacemaker-like device can be implanted to electrically stimulate the receptors chronically, which is found to lower blood pressure by 15–25 mmHg.

===Massage===

Massage of the carotid sinus, carotid sinus massage is used to diagnose carotid sinus syncope and is sometimes useful for differentiating supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) from ventricular tachycardia. Like the valsalva maneuver, it is a treatment for acute SVT. It is less effective than pharmaceutical management of SVT with verapamil or adenosine, but it is still the preferred first line of treatment in a hemodynamically stable patient.

===Carotid sinus reflex death===
Carotid sinus reflex death is a potential etiology of sudden death in which manual stimulation of the carotid sinus allegedly causes strong glossopharyngeal nerve (Vagus nerve is for aortic arch baroreceptors) impulses leading to terminal cardiac arrest. Carotid sinus reflex death has been pointed out as a possible cause of death in cases of strangulation, hanging and autoerotic strangulation, but such deductions remain controversial. Medical literature examining the use of carotid sinus massage involving brief gentle pressure of the carotid sinus in therapeutic settings as a diagnostic and therapeutic examination tool have reported few potentially fatal complications. A carotid massage can also possibly dislodge a thrombus, or some plaque. This could lead to any number of life-threatening effects, including stroke.

==In martial arts and self defense==
Stimulation of the carotid sinus via a slap or a strike, to induce (usually temporary, but sometimes lethal) loss of consciousness is a self-defense technique, and is often taught in martial arts such as karate.

<text>Leonard Kibrick (September 6, 1924 – January 4, 1993) was an American child actor.

== Career ==
Kibrick was most notable for appearing in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short subjects series from 1934 to 1936, usually portraying the villain. Kibrick first appeared in the 1934 Our Gang short &quot;For Pete&#x27;s Sake&quot;. He appeared in many more Our Gang shorts for the next two years. His final Our Gang short was the 1936 &quot;The Lucky Corner.&quot; His role as the bully in the series was taken over by Tommy Bond (as &quot;Butch&quot;) in 1937, and Leonard&#x27;s younger brother Sidney Kibrick portrayed Butch&#x27;s sidekick, &quot;The Woim&quot;.

<text>Pierre Francis Koenig (October 17, 1925 – April 4, 2004) was an American architect and a Professor of Architecture at the University of Southern California. He taught at the USC School of Architecture from 1964 until his death in 2004. He was the director of the undergraduate building science program from 1980 to 2004. He lectured widely at other universities, and received more than 20 awards for his work. The architecture of Pierre Koenig was the subject of the book &quot;Pierre Koenig&quot; written by James Steele in 1998. Also in 1998, Koenig was elevated to &quot;Distinguished Professor&quot; after 35 years on the USC faculty. He received the USC Distinguished Alumni Award and the Gold Medal from the Los Angeles chapter of the American Institute of Architects.

== Early life ==
The son of a salesman, Koenig was born in San Francisco. The family moved to Southern California in 1939. After returning from a four-year tour in the Army during World War II, he enrolled in architecture school. He received his Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) degree from USC in 1952.

==Career==
Koenig worked with Raphael Soriano and Edward H. Fickett among others, and began private practice in 1952. Koenig practiced mainly on the West Coast and was most notable for the design of the Case Study Houses No. 21 and 22 in 1960. Both 21 (the Bailey House) and 22 (the Stahl House) were constructed on dramatic, otherwise-unbuildable sites. Particularly the Case Study House #22, photographed by Julius Shulman, is widely considered the iconic postwar L.A. home, with its sweeping city views and openness to the outdoors.

At USC, Koenig led the undergraduate building science program and directed the Natural Forces Laboratory. The Building Science group at USC also included Ralph Lewis Knowles, Douglas E. Noble, Marc Schiler, Karen M. Kensek, Goetz Schierle, David Brindle, and Konrad Wachsmann.

Koenig died of leukemia in 2004 at 78. He was survived by his wife, Gloria; sons, Randall and Jean Pierre; and two stepsons, Barry and Thomas Kaufman.

In 2007, Koenig&#x27;s Case Study House #21 sold at auction for $3.1 million. His personal residence in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles was built in 1985. After a restoration overseen by his stepsons, the steel and glass residence went up for sale in 2017 for $3.8 million.

<text>Jack FM is a radio network brand that is licensed by Sparknet Communications, with the exception of the European Union where it is licensed by Oxis Media. It plays an adult hits format, in most cases not using DJs.

== Format characteristics ==

Stations using the &quot;Jack&quot; name are strictly licensed by SparkNet Communications. There are several terms that each station must agree to, including operating without disc jockeys for at least the first few months of the format. SparkNet has been protective of its format, unsuccessfully filing trademark infringement suits against Bonneville International for its use of the Jack FM service-marked slogan &quot;Playing What We Want&quot; and other similar phrases. For this reason, many stations airing a Jack-like format use slightly different slogans to avoid infringing on SparkNet&#x27;s service marks: WBEN-FM in Philadelphia uses the tagline &quot;Playing anything we feel like.&quot; On WLKO &quot;102.9 The Lake&quot; in Charlotte, North Carolina, the tagline is &quot;We Play Anything&quot;. During its run as &quot;Doug FM&quot;, WDRQ in Detroit used the line &quot;93.1 DOUG FM – We Play...EVERYTHING!&quot;

Most stations in the United States use Howard Cogan and Andrew Anthony (best known as the voices of EA Sports and GEICO) as the voice of &quot;Jack&quot;, while stations in Canada use Greg Beharrell. All Jack FM stations in the United Kingdom used former Blake&#x27;s 7 actor Paul Darrow as the voice of Jack. In place of DJs, the Jack character makes sarcastic or ironic remarks and quips, often using self-deprecating humor.

Each September, all Jack FM stations ask listeners to visit a certain link to evaluate which songs should be played on the radio and which ones should be swapped.

==History==
===2000–2003: Origins===
:&quot;Perry launched JACK-FM on the internet in 2001 at jack.fm (where you can listen to it streaming for free at 128 kbps quality). His company, Big Sticks Broadcasting Corporation, owns the service marks to &quot;JACK-FM&quot; and &quot;Playing What We Want&quot; in the United States.&quot;

In 2000, the first originator of New York&#x27;s Jack FM format was radio programmer Bob Perry, the president of Big Sticks Broadcasting Corp., on a United States–based Internet radio stream in 2000. Perry named the station after a fictitious persona, &quot;Cadillac Jack&quot; Garrett, &quot;a hard-living radio cowboy&quot;. The back story created by Perry for the original web stream was that Garrett, a disc jockey who had worked many &quot;big sticks&quot;, finally got his own radio station, and after years of being told what he was to play on-air was creating a station where the motto was &quot;playing what we want&quot;. 

Rogers Communications claims that the only thing taken without permission, for the Jack FM radio station, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, was the name and the tagline. Pat Cardinal, one of the first Jack program directors, says that he was unaware of the type of music on the American website and that &quot;Jack&quot; was one of several names that were considered for the format. Rogers Communications came to an agreement with Perry for the use of the Jack FM name in Canada soon after the launch. The original web stream is still live to this day.

Jack was also inspired by the success of CHUM Limited&#x27;s &quot;Bob FM&quot; brand on CFWM radio in Winnipeg. Program director Howard Kroeger was inspired to create Bob FM after hearing a mixtape at a friend&#x27;s 40th birthday party. Other Canadian broadcasters copied the concept as well, adopting such brands as Corus Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Dave FM&quot; and &quot;Joe FM&quot;. In 2003, an Ottawa station launched &quot;Frank FM&quot; as a one-day Halloween prank. (The prank&#x27;s name was possibly also inspired by the Canadian satirical magazine &quot;Frank&quot;, and probably the New England stations known as Frank FM.)
Beginning in late 2002, several Canadian radio stations owned by Rogers Communications starting using the format. The first Jack station was Vancouver&#x27;s CKLG-FM, which quickly shot to the top of the city&#x27;s BBM radio ratings. The format was consequently adopted on other Rogers stations in 2002 and 2003. The format proved popular in many markets where it was introduced, although its success was not always as dramatic as it had been in Vancouver.

===2004–2005: Introduction to United States and controversies===
In 2004, SparkNet Communications, the owner of the Jack FM and &quot;Playing What We Want&quot; trademarks outside of Canada, started to license the Jack FM trademark in the United States. NRC Broadcasting&#x27;s KJAC in Denver was the first U.S. station to adopt the &quot;Jack FM&quot; format on April 14, 2004. (It has since switched to a public radio adult album alternative format.)

The success of Jack caused a cloning effect, with some stations using the names of famous local figures, landmarks, or symbols to promote their version of the format. These variations have included WABZ &quot;Abe FM&quot; in Springfield, Illinois, named for Abraham Lincoln; WBEN-FM &quot;Ben FM&quot; in Philadelphia, named for Benjamin Franklin; &quot;100.5 FM Louie&quot; in Louisville, Kentucky; &quot;96.7 Steve FM&quot; WLTY in Columbia, South Carolina, named after University of South Carolina football coach Steve Spurrier; WCFF &quot;The Chief 92.5 FM&quot; in Champaign, Illinois, named for the controversial symbol of the University of Illinois, Chief Illiniwek; WARH in St. Louis, known as &quot;106.5 The Arch,&quot; named for the Gateway Arch, and even a body of water like &quot;106-5 The Lake&quot; WHLK in Cleveland, named for Lake Erie.

On July 29, 2005, Rawlco&#x27;s CKCK-FM in Regina, Saskatchewan, became the first non-Rogers station in Canada to directly license the Jack FM brand rather than adopting an alternate name.

On May 4, 2005, at 11 a.m., WQSR, an oldies station in Baltimore, changed its format to Jack FM. Listeners and staffers alike were surprised by the sudden change because many of the station&#x27;s long-time air personalities were considered Baltimore institutions. WQSR received a large amount of negative publicity regarding the format change. Popular former WQSR personality Steve Rouse later became the morning show host at sister station 101.9 WLIF.

The introduction of Jack FM in New York City generated the most negative publicity of any market that switched a station to the format. On June 3, 2005, at 5:00 p.m., WCBS-FM, an oldies station in New York City, flipped to Jack FM without any prior warning. The switch to the format, with no DJs and few songs before 1980 was termed &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot; by some New Yorkers and has drawn criticism even from non-listeners of the station. The sudden firing of DJs of historic renown such as Cousin Brucie, Ron Lundy and Harry Harrison was noted in the press. In a partial nod to this controversy, on June 14, 2005, the station announced that it would tweak the format to include a handful of 1950s and early 1960s songs as well as performers such as Frank Sinatra — elements not typical of the Jack format. However, a later update retracted this and songs from before the late 1960s were no longer played.

One prominent reaction to the format change came in the form of a derogatory comment from the city&#x27;s mayor. According to the &quot;New York Post&quot;, mayor Michael Bloomberg responded to the change by declaring he would &quot;never listen to that fucking CBS radio ever again&quot; (the quote was censored in the newspaper). The new Jack station quickly picked up on this, using its trademark sarcasm: &quot;Hey, Mayor Bloomberg. I heard you took a shot at us in the &quot;Post&quot;. What&#x27;s with all the swearin&#x27; like a sailor? Fleet Week is over. It&#x27;s just music.&quot; Initially, Arbitron ratings showed a sharp decline and while ratings did improve, they never surpassed the levels that WCBS-FM had before the format switch.

As a result, on July 6, 2007, WCBS-FM announced it would drop Jack FM and restore the station&#x27;s old format on July 12 with an updated classic hits approach, a move attributed mostly to the newly appointed CBS Radio CEO Dan Mason. Three of the fired DJs and staff (Dan Taylor, Bob Shannon, and Mr. G) returned to the station, along with newsman Al Meredith (who had stayed at the station during Jack FM doing his Sunday morning public affairs show), as well as DJ Pat St. John who had previously left CBS-FM for Q104.3 about a year before the flip to Jack. Steve O&#x27;Brien, a weekend and fill-in DJ at the time of the format change, also returned in a similar capacity in 2008. For a time, the Jack FM format WAS renamed ToNY. It was available through WCBS-FM&#x27;s HD2 subchannel, and via an internet stream.

On the same day that WCBS-FM flipped to Jack FM, another station owned by CBS, WJMK, an oldies station in Chicago, changed formats to Jack FM as well. The change at WJMK didn&#x27;t attract as much attention as the WCBS-FM flip, but it still drew the ire of its listeners. Just as with WCBS-FM in New York, WJMK Chicago ended the Jack FM format and reverted to classic hits in 2011.

On July 5, 2005, it was announced that Bohn &amp; Associates Media and Wall Media formed SparkNet Communications L.P. as the exclusive international licensor and owner of the Jack FM format. SparkNet has, in turn, licensed the format to Dial Global for satellite-based syndication to stations in U.S. markets outside the 40 largest. This satellite-fed Jack became active in October 2005, and now serves many of the smaller Jack stations, such as those in Evansville, Indiana, and Knoxville, Tennessee.

In late September 2005, CJAQ-FM in Toronto, announced that it would become the first DJ-less station in Canada. Pat Cardinal, general manager and program director of the station, said &quot;The move came as a result of listener feedback. The audience has been telling us that they want no DJs on Jack. They want more music.&quot; When it first launched, 92.5 Jack FM operated without disc jockeys in an effort to establish the &quot;Playing What We Want&quot; concept, which was new to Toronto. DJs were introduced within weeks. In November 2005, Cardinal defended his decision in an interview with Michael Hainsworth of Report on Business Television and stated why he doesn&#x27;t see commercial-free iPods and satellite radio as a threat to a non-DJ format.

In October 2005, Entravision Radio launched a Spanish-language version of the Jack format dubbed &quot;José&quot; with the &quot;We Play What We Want&quot; tagline translated into Spanish as &quot;Toca lo que Quiere&quot;. &quot;José&quot; went live on six FM and AM stations in Sacramento, Stockton, and Modesto, California; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Denver, Colorado. The &quot;José&quot; stations have no affiliation with Jack, SparkNet Communications, or Bob Perry.

On October 25, 2005, Infinity Broadcasting, part of CBS, announced that it would be replacing Howard Stern with Jack FM on some of its stations. Stern left terrestrial radio for Sirius Satellite Radio in late 2005.

===Since 2006: North American format changes, international expansion===
Following the format&#x27;s explosive mid-2000s growth throughout North America, Jack FM continued to expand into smaller markets across the continent. However, in many cities the novelty wore off, and in the late 2000s a number of Jack stations modified their playlists drastically or flipped to other formats outright.

In May 2006, the playlist of CJAQ-FM in Toronto evolved into a mainstream rock format. The 1980s top-40 acts such as Madonna, Duran Duran, Kim Wilde, Cyndi Lauper, and Falco were dropped in favor of an all-rock playlist, and the station&#x27;s slogan changed to &quot;Toronto&#x27;s Best Rock Variety&quot;. However, In June 2009, the station flipped back to Contemporary Hits. It returned to its former &quot;Kiss&quot; branding as well as adopted its current call letters. Similarly, Rawlco-owned CKCK-FM (the only non-Rogers operated Jack FM station) in Regina, Saskatchewan, adopted a classic rock direction in September, changing its slogan from the traditional &quot;Playing What We Want&quot; to &quot;The Greatest Rock Of All Time&quot; and adding announcers to its afternoon drive time show. In 2010, the tagline was changed again to &quot;Regina&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;.

In October 2006, the UK&#x27;s first Jack FM format station won a broadcast licence for the Oxford area. 106 Jack FM Oxford started broadcasting at 1:06 p.m. BST on October 18, 2007. On December 2, 2009, Bristol radio station Original FM changed to Jack FM after requesting a format change with OFCOM. Two further Jack FM stations were planned on DAB digital radio from 2008 for Northamptonshire and Northeast Wales and West Cheshire but by August 2009 were a year late with no indication of an ETA. In addition the Oxfordshire Jack was to have been relayed to a wider area.
&quot;RadioToday&quot; reported The Coast was to flip to become JACK FM on July 4, 2011.

In January 2007, KAJR in California&#x27;s Coachella Valley launched as a &quot;Jack FM&quot; affiliate in a region unable to receive the KCBS-FM signal from Los Angeles, to the west. Jack did not last long. By February 1, 2010, that station became soft adult contemporary-formatted KJJZ.

On October 22, 2007, WJMK in Chicago announced that radio personality Steve Dahl would be morning drive personality as of November 5, the first personality on the station since it went to the Jack format. In March 2011, WJMK dropped the Jack format in favor of classic hits as &quot;K-Hits&quot;, featuring 1960s to 1980s music. Eddie &amp; Jobo (Ed Volkman and Joe Bohannon, former morning hosts at co-owned WBBM-FM) took over the morning show.

On June 29, 2012, it was announced that KJQN in Salt Lake City would drop the &quot;Jack FM&quot; format on July 16, 2012, and begin to simulcast the talk radio format of KLO.

On August 2, 2013, KFMB-FM, the Jack FM station in San Diego, began restricting access to its online stream to listeners within the city of San Diego proper. This move by program director Mike O&#x27;Reilly drew the ire of fans who live outside the city limits, including the large U.S. military community stationed locally and overseas. O&#x27;Reilly explained his rationale, citing a new Arbitron policy on how online listening is measured:

KFMB-FM achieved this effect by restricting the signal based on the IP address of the device on which a listener streamed the station. However, fans within the city of San Diego were prevented from hearing the station as well. In addition, the station charged for access to its local morning radio show on podcast in September 2013. On November 17, 2015, KFMB-FM dropped its regular Jack FM programming and began stunting with all-Christmas music as &quot;Jack Frost&quot;; The station launched a mainstream rock format on January 4, 2016.

On February 28, 2014, CFLT-FM in Halifax, Nova Scotia, flipped formats to Jack FM becoming the latest Rogers radio station to adopt the Jack branding. Meanwhile, in February 2015, another Rogers station, CHTT-FM in Victoria, British Columbia, dropped the Jack FM format and flipped to contemporary hit radio (CHR) as &quot;Kiss 103.1&quot;. That station, however, returned to Jack FM programming on August 15, 2019.

On December 26, 2017, at midnight, KSAJ-FM in Topeka, Kansas, flipped formats from oldies to Jack FM.

The Jack FM format is distributed via satellite in the United States and internationally. Within the US, distributed originally by ABC Radio and later acquired by Dial Global (now Westwood One). In September 2019, Skyview Networks took over the US distribution rights from Westwood One. US military radio station Armed Forces Network, Afghanistan broadcasts Jack FM, having adopted the format on August 1, 2011, as a way to expand the playlist and reduce operational personnel.

<doc id="1227367" wikidata="Q4969727" url="?curid=1227367" title="British Columbia Marijuana Party">
<text>The British Columbia Marijuana Party (abbreviated BCMP) was a minor political party in the Canadian province of British Columbia that advocated the legalisation of cannabis.

The BCMP was formed following the 2000 federal election. Marc Emery, the founder and current president of the party, formed the party the day after the 2000 vote. The BCMP made provincial history during the 2001 provincial election that came six months later, by being the only party to ever field candidates in all of the province&#x27;s ridings during their first election campaign.

Brian Taylor served as the party&#x27;s first leader during the 2001 provincial election. Taylor had been a prominent cannabis activist and was the former mayor of Grand Forks.

The Marijuana Party was excluded from the televised leaders&#x27; debate, even though they were running more candidates than either the Green Party or the Unity Party, both of which were included. BC Marijuana Party members protested during the televised debate.

In 2001, the party won 51,206 votes, 3.22% of the popular vote. Teresa Taylor, daughter of leader Brian Taylor, captured the party&#x27;s highest popular vote total with 1,136 and polled 5.6% in the conservative Okanagan-Westside district.

After the election, Dana Larsen became leader, followed by Marc Emery when Larsen switched to the New Democratic Party in 2003.

Emery also remains as president and chief organizer, despite having faced extradition to the United States for selling marijuana seeds from Canada by mail order.

In the 2005 election, the party fielded 44 candidates, who won a total of 11,519 votes, or 0.64% of the province-wide total.

Before the 2009 election, the party announced it would endorse Green Party candidates in every riding across the province. However, it would run two candidates to continue its party status; those candidates would also openly endorse the Green candidate in that particular constituency. The party ran two candidates in the 2013 election and no candidates in the 2017 election. The party de-registered with Elections BC effective October 2019.
