<text>James Thomas Byford McCudden, (28 March 1895 – 9 July 1918) was an English flying ace of the First World War and among the most highly decorated airmen in British military history. Born in 1895 to a middle class family with military traditions, McCudden joined the Royal Engineers in 1910. Having an interest in mechanics he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in 1913 at which time he first came into regular contact with aircraft. At the outbreak of war in 1914 he flew as an observer before training as a fighter pilot in 1916.

McCudden claimed his first victory in September 1916 flying the Airco DH.2. He claimed his fifth victory—making him an ace—on 15 February 1917. For the next six months he served as an instructor and flew defensive patrols over London. He returned to the frontline in summer 1917 flying the S.E.5a. That same year he dispatched a further 31 enemy aircraft while claiming multiple victories in one day on 11 occasions. With his six British medals and one French, McCudden received more awards for gallantry than any other airman of British nationality serving in the First World War. He was also one of the longest serving. By 1918, in part due to a campaign by the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper, McCudden became one of the most famous airmen in the British Isles.

At the time of his death, he had achieved 57 aerial victories, placing him seventh on the list of the war&#x27;s most successful aces. Just under two-thirds of his victims can be identified by name. This is possible since, unlike other Allied aces, a substantial proportion of McCudden&#x27;s claims were made over Allied-held territory. The majority of his successes were achieved with 56 Squadron RFC and all but five were shot down while McCudden was flying the S.E.5a. On 9 July 1918, McCudden was killed in a flying accident when his aircraft crashed on takeoff due to engine failure. His rank at the time of his death was major, a significant achievement for a man who had begun his career in the RFC as an air mechanic. McCudden is buried at the British war cemetery at Beauvoir-Wavans.

==Early life and family==
James McCudden was born in Gillingham, Kent, to Sergeant-Major William H. McCudden and Amelia Byford. His father had been in the military for most of his life. He joined the Royal Engineers as a teenager and served in No. 24 Company. William McCudden fought in the Anglo-Egyptian War at the Battle of Tel el-Kebir in 1882. During combat he rescued a wounded soldier while under fire and was recommended for an award. However, when it emerged he was acting against orders he was denied any honours. Nevertheless, William had a long career in the Engineers and eventually became an instructor at the School of Military Engineering as a non-commissioned officer. His mother&#x27;s family also had a military background; her grandfather served as a Master-at-arms in the Royal Marines aboard .

In 1890 William H. McCudden and Amelia Byford (1869–1955) married. They had six children; William Thomas James (3 April 1891 – 1 May 1915), Mary Amelia (23 January 1893), James Thomas Byford (28 March 1895 – 9 July 1918), Kathleen Annie (1 December 1899), John Anthony (14 June 1897 – 18 March 1918) and Maurice Vincent (31 October 1901 – 13 December 1934). John and William McCudden became fighter pilots but both were killed whilst flying—John would be killed in action during the war.

His father William H. McCudden took a post at the Air Ministry at the rank of warrant officer after the Great War, but would die tragically at Clapham Junction railway station on 7 July 1920. When he stood up to offer a woman his seat the compartment door flew open, knocking him into the path of an oncoming train. Maurice Vincent became a pilot and served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) until he retired through illness in 1933. He died of colitis the following year, leaving a widow and small daughter.

The McCuddens moved to Sheerness in 1909 and James transferred to the garrison school. He learned to shoot at the rifle range, box and was a reasonably intelligent student. His father&#x27;s retirement soon placed a heavy strain on the family finances and as a consequence McCudden felt obliged to find a job before he could enlist once he turned 15. He filled the time from the age of 14 to the age of enlistment by working as a Post Office messenger boy. It was at this time McCudden&#x27;s interest in flying began. In nearby Leysdown, on the Isle of Sheppey, one of the first aviation centres was built. It was here John Moore-Brabazon became the first Englishman to fly. McCudden and his brothers often went to see the pioneer aviators gather. McCudden expressed a desire to become a pilot after spending hours watching these early flying machines.

==Royal Engineers and RFC==
Unfortunately his desire to be a pilot was postponed. The family required further income after his father retired. Unable to wait for that opportunity to arise he joined the Royal Engineers on 26 April 1910, as No. 20083. On 24 February 1911, he set sail for Gibraltar on the southern tip of Spain. McCudden spent eighteen months in Gibraltar before returning to England in September 1912. While in Gibraltar he read &quot;Flight&quot; manual magazine habitually, which explained the theory of flight, aircraft construction and aero engines. He excelled in his service and by 26 April 1913 he had become a qualified Sapper. He also held the grade Air Mechanic 2nd Class, No. 892, which was awarded to him on 28 April 1913. Soon afterwards he became a member of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). On 9 May he was posted to Farnborough depot as a mechanic.

McCudden&#x27;s tenure at the aerodrome began ominously. The same day he was granted a request to travel as an observer in a Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2, disaster struck which could conceivably have ended his career. Instructed to familiarise himself with the aircraft around the airfield he examined a Caudron Type A, and proceeded to turn over the engine. The aircraft was listed as unserviceable and McCudden saw no danger in leaving the throttle fully open. Suddenly the engine started and it accelerated out of the hangar and into a Farman MF.11. McCudden watched as the propeller chewed the wing to pieces and damaged his Commanding Officer&#x27;s car which had been parked nearby. He was able to reach the cockpit and switch off the ignition but not before extensive damage had been done. For this misdemeanor he was brought before Colonel Frederick Sykes, commanding the RFC Military Wing. Sykes was pleased with his overall progress, which likely saved him, but sentenced McCudden to seven days detention and a forfeiture of 14 days pay for the incident. Five years later Sykes again met McCudden—then at the height of his fame—and chaffed him on the episode, even jokingly threatening to send him a bill for the car.

On 15 June 1913 he was posted to No. 3 Squadron RFC. He managed a flight in a Blériot aircraft while there and gradually won a reputation as a first-rate mechanic. By Christmas his frequent requests for trips in the aircraft had met with so much success that McCudden had logged nearly 30 hours, mostly in the Blériot monoplanes. On 1 April 1914 he was promoted to Air Mechanic First Class.

==War service==

===An observer airman===

In August 1914 he travelled to France as a mechanic with 3 Squadron after war was declared, which followed the German invasion of Belgium. It operated as a reconnaissance unit and McCudden began to fly as an observer. After stopping at Amiens for several days, the unit began reconnoitering enemy positions. 3 Squadron offered support to the British Army at the Battle of Mons in Belgium. That month McCudden saw his first German aircraft on 22 August. On 25 August the British began their retreat, south-west, toward Paris. 3 Squadron moved to no fewer than nine different landing grounds, often delaying departure until the enemy was only a mile or two behind. Eventually they settled at Melun, south of Paris. In the autumn, McCudden participated in locating German artillery positions as the Allied armies drove back the enemy at the First Battle of the Marne and First Battle of the Aisne. McCudden flew these missions with a rifle since aircraft lacked any fixed armament.

McCudden performed well and took on more administrative responsibilities once he was promoted to Corporal on 20 November 1914. During this period, the First Battle of Ypres was being fought and the Squadron re-equipped with the higher performing Morane-Saulnier L aircraft. Several months later, on 1 April 1915, he was promoted to sergeant and made NCO in charge of all engines in his flight. McCudden&#x27;s delight at gaining a promotion was cut short by news that his brother William had been killed in an air crash while flying an elderly Blériot. Just a week later, his eldest sister Mary lost her husband in an explosion which destroyed the minelayer HMS &quot;Princess Irene&quot; on 27 May 1915.

Undeterred, McCudden made a formal application to become a pilot and fly on operations but it was rejected on the grounds he was too valuable to risk losing. His reputation as a mechanic had spread since his supervision in the unit had led to a record-low number of engine failures. He continued to fly as an observer despite the recommendation of his rejection letter.

On 8 June he made his first official observer qualifying sortie which he passed. At this time the German &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; (Air Service) introduced the Fokker Eindecker fighter equipped with Synchronization gear. Firing through the propeller, the Germans had a machine that soon became a serious threat to McCudden&#x27;s unit. The enemy succeeded establishing a period of air superiority at this time. McCudden still flew regularly as an observer with the new commanding Officer, Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt, who had taken over command on 20 November 1915. He recorded a flight of 2 hours 40 minutes on 27 November which included an abortive chase after an Albatros C.I reconnaissance aircraft. On 16 December 1915 he acted as aerial gunner, when he drove off an attack on his flight by the German ace Max Immelmann. While firing at the Fokker, McCudden saw a piece of paper or fabric fall off the German machine. Although the ground was diligently searched, no trace of it was found. On 19 January 1916, McCudden exchanged fire with another German observer without result.

During this time, McCudden&#x27;s Squadron was also experimenting with wireless technology. Captain D.S Lewis, who commanded the headquarters flight, fitted his B.E.2a with a wireless set to help direct artillery fire. In April 1915 he commanded 3 Squadron and became McCudden&#x27;s commanding officer. He was killed a year later when he was shot down by ground-fire. It is unknown whether McCudden participated in these pioneering ventures.

On 21 January 1916 McCudden was awarded the Croix de guerre for gallantry. He travelled to Lillers to receive his award from General Joseph Joffre, Commander-in-Chief of the French Army. On 23 January he was promoted to flight sergeant and 24 hours later he was ordered home to England to begin pilot training.

===Pilot training===
McCudden was based at Farnborough and began his training on 22 February 1916. He started with a 20-minute flight in a Henry Farman pusher. McCudden had already flown 100 hours as a passenger with 25 different pilots including 46 hours as a regular observer since November 1915 and had much experience with his surroundings. His instructor was impressed with his grasp of the mechanics and theory. He practiced six landings and progressed to the more powerful Avro 504 as the last Farman had been written off by another student.

On 9 April he was sent to Gosport, assigned to No. 41 Squadron RFC, and made his first solo flight on 16 April in a Farman MF.7. Later that day he was awarded his Royal Aero Club certificate after completing four figure-of-eight turns, a glide from 1,200 feet and a landing within forty yards of a selected mark. He completed 22 flights at Gosport, the longest a 50-minute flight to 7,000 feet. On 29 April he was posted to the Central Flying School (CFS) at Upavon, near Salisbury Plain, for advanced training, arriving on 1 May.

On 7 May he became the 107th non-commissioned officer to receive his CFS certificate, passing as Second Class Flier. He was good enough to be selected as an instructor and took his first pupil after having flown only nine hours of solo flight himself. Two of his pupils included the future ace and 56 Squadron colleague Geoffrey Hilton Bowman and Mick Mannock. Soon afterwards, while teaching a student in an Airco DH.1, the aircraft entered a dangerous spin. McCudden narrowly avoided a crash, pulling up feet above the ground. An impact would certainly have killed them both.

On 30 May he was graded First Class Flier. The grade was based upon his achievements; he had achieved a dead-stick landing within a fifty-yard marker, a 15-minute flight at 6,000 feet, a 60-mile cross-country flight and 15 hours solo flying. On 24 May he passed his final test with a two-hour flight from Salisbury, to Southampton and on to Basingstoke. His 74 hours flying experience was well above the minimum. By the time he left for France in June he had accumulated 121 flying hours, given 177 lessons as instructor, and had personally tutored 40 student pilots.

===Back at the front line===
McCudden joined No. 20 Squadron on 8 July 1916. The unit was equipped with Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2 and flew from Clairmarais aerodrome, near Saint-Omer. He flew his first operational sortie two days later and continued as the Battle of the Somme raged. The Squadron was ordered to intercept and shoot down German reconnaissance aircraft. He patrolled the Ypres and Roeselare (Roulers) region. He did not spot any enemy reconnaissance machines but did come into contact with a single Fokker near Lille. Flying in formation, the British were well placed to deal with lone German fighters since they could use their gunners to form a formidable defence screen. This particular German used a tactic of climbing above the British, making a diving attack at the rear-most aircraft and diving away if he did not score a decisive hit. Two days later McCudden ran out of fuel in the Lille district. Disorientated because of heavy mist, he force-landed in Allied territory, crashing and coming to halt in the garden of a French farmhouse. Little damage was done to the machine. On 2 August he took part in an operation to bomb the Zeppelin sheds at Brussels. The flight was unmolested, though the familiar lone Fokker made an appearance and then withdrew without attacking.

That same evening McCudden was told to pack his belongings since he was to be reassigned to 29 Squadron RFC flying Airco DH.2 scouts. McCudden was pleased to be flying scouts, finding it &quot;light after flying the F.E.&quot; McCudden soon found from pilots that the machine was not popular and had to be handled with care. Nevertheless, while on patrol between Armentières and Ypres on 6 September 1916 he scored his first victory. He engaged an all-white Albatros B.II, and shot it down. He then chased another but it escaped through superior speed. Confirmation of his victory was given three days later by a I ANZAC Corps unit. It had crashed on the Gheluve-Mennin road at the time and place of his claim. McCudden nearly added to this score the following day. He engaged a Fokker monoplane but his gun jammed. Switching off his engine, he rectified the damage but the Fokker pilot took the opportunity to pursue him. Restarting his engine as the German closed, McCudden outmanoeuvred him and was presented with a close-astern shot, but once again his gun jammed and the battle ended inconclusively when the faster Fokker dived away.

McCudden did not score again during the year but had a remarkable escape on 27 December 1916. Flying from Arras to Monchy on patrol, his flight of six DH.2s engaged an enemy formation of Albatros D.IIs. McCudden rushed to the aid of Alexander James, a member of his flight, who had been attacked by a German fighter. He attacked the Albatros head-on but his gun jammed after 20 shots. As he fought to clear the jam he found himself surrounded by German fighters.
One soon latched onto him and began firing. McCudden dived steeply but the enemy pilot remained behind him. At 800 feet McCudden began a spinning dive until the German, now some distance behind, abruptly turned away. The enemy aircraft was fired at by British ground forces and McCudden, who by now had unjammed his Lewis machine gun, turned to give pursuit. The enemy pilot, apparently unaware of this, was already too high and McCudden watched as he re-joined his flight and departed the area.

McCudden returned to base; in spite of his narrow escape his machine had not been hit. His squadron mates were surprised to see him; they had witnessed his dive, assumed the spin to be terminal, and were in the process of posting him missing in action. It has been suggested that the enemy pilot was none other than Manfred von Richthofen, &quot;The Red Baron&quot;, in which case McCudden had narrowly avoided becoming the rising star&#x27;s 15th victim. Richthofen was credited with a &quot;two seat Vickers biplane&quot; that afternoon, which has usually been listed as the F.E.2b of Captain Quested and Lieutenant Dicksee, but recent research indicates that the action with McCudden may fit the time frame.

1916 ended on a personal high for McCudden. He received his commission on 28 December which came into effect on 1 January 1917. He was granted two weeks leave and returned to England. As a second lieutenant, McCudden returned to France on 21 January. He was determined to build up his personal tally despite the limitations of his DH.2. The very same day he was forced down for the first and only time. He attacked an Albatros D.III and damaged its engine which stopped. Unfortunately another attacked and he was forced to break off a certain kill when one of his propeller blades was partly shot off. Another DH.2 intervened and McCudden landed near Arras, ordered a new propeller, and flew back to base. Since no member witnessed the fate of the Albatros no claim was made.

McCudden&#x27;s fortunes changed in the new year. He dispatched a two-seater on 26 January and another on 2 February 1917. On 5 February he attacked an Albatros C.III returning from a photo-reconnaissance mission. Diving out of the sun to blind the gunner, he shot it down over the front line, where it was shelled by British artillery. Ten days later he engaged an Albatros escorted by a LFG Roland C.II. After a brief dogfight and pursuit, the Albatros escaped but he destroyed the Roland which crashed near Monchy. The next day McCudden was awarded the Military Cross for his fifth victory. His award was gazetted on 12 March.

===Return to England===
He returned to England on 23 February and was appointed an instructor once more. He was slightly aggrieved as he felt he was now getting into his stride as a fighter pilot. He had also hoped that his squadron was about to receive the French-designed Nieuports, which were a better match for the Albatros and Halberstadt &quot;D&quot; class fighters than the obsolescent DH.2. His posting was not surprising to him. The beginning of 1917 witnessed an enormous expansion of the RFC and experienced tutors were required to train the mass of new students.

McCudden was posted to the 6th Training Wing at Maidstone until transferred to Dover on 15 April where he learned to fly the Bristol Scout. One of his aircraft was adorned with the name &quot;Teddie&quot;, which his fellow officers suspected was the name of a girlfriend—a blonde dancer, Ms Teddie O&#x27;Neil. McCudden was notoriously private about this aspect of his life but it was suspected that he took her on unauthorised flights in the Scout since his log book recorded such escapades in April. He praised the qualities of his Scout even though he managed to survive two accidents in this aircraft on 29 April and 2 June. Concurrent with his tenure at Dover, his brother John also enrolled as a pilot pupil there. To avoid accusations of favouritism, he remained aloof from his brother which amused his senior officers who had guessed his intentions.

In late May and June he collected and experimented on the new Sopwith Pups which began to reach British units in January. He was impressed with the aircraft&#x27;s agility and flew it often. During this period he met the now famous ace Albert Ball who advised him attack tactics against reconnaissance and bomber aircraft. Ball advised McCudden to fly underneath his target, in the blind spot of the observer, and angle his guns directly above then fire. McCudden was intrigued at the prospect and believed this offered a much better chance of shooting down an enemy aircraft. It is not clear if, or how often, McCudden implemented Ball&#x27;s advice in battle and how many of his victories were claimed that way. McCudden&#x27;s principal tactics did stress surprise and minimal risk.

It is known McCudden proved remarkably good at stalking tactics, which enabled him to get up underneath an opponent, pull down the wing gun and fire up into the German machine. The first the recipients would know of the attack was bullets coming up through the bottom of the fuselage of the aircraft, often causing death or injury, holing petrol tanks and crippling engines. The gun, being fed by a drum of ammunition, could also be reloaded in its pulled-down position, the pilot having two or more spare drums located in his cockpit.

This conversation coincided with the Gotha Raids in which German heavy bombers attacked London. He attempted interceptions against the high-flying machines and on 13 June finally got to within range of one. He fired but it swerved and resumed course. He chased the formation 21 miles (34 km) out to sea but could not get closer than 500 feet (160m). On 7 July he shot down the Gotha crewed by &quot;Leutnant&quot; Erwin Kollberg and Walter Aschoff (of bomber unit &quot;Bogohl 3&quot;). He damaged a second and narrowly avoided a collision with the machine as he flew by. On one raid a Gotha gunner&#x27;s bullet struck his windshield. The raids continued and British aerial defences gained only a handful of successes against the Gothas.

Before returning to France, McCudden met with Frank Barnwell and Harold Barnwell, the sibling chief engineers at Vickers Limited, with whom he exchanged information on aircraft design and operations. The brothers gained a greater appreciation of the pilot&#x27;s perspective. After watching him fly the F.B.9, the brothers were convinced of his skill and consequently McCudden was invited to fly several of their products. Among these machines was the Vickers F.B.16. McCudden claimed to have reached 136 mph (219 km/h) in the aircraft, describing it as a &quot;nice bus&quot;. Other pilots noted it was faster than the French SPAD and the S.E.5. On the strength of this evaluation Vickers approached the War Office for front line use. It was not selected for production. McCudden believed the unavailability of the engine was a main factor in its rejection.

===With 56 Squadron===
In June he joined No. 66 Squadron RFC at Aire, equipped with the Sopwith Pup. He undertook a refresher course but his tenure there was unremarkable. He was ordered to fly with the group rather than fly solo patrols. He flew 47 hours in 66 Squadron and 21 patrols. He encountered the enemy six times but could not score. Finally on 21 and 26 July he shot down one Albatros D.V fighter for his 6–7th aerial victories.

He flew 13 different Pups while with the unit which meant he returned across the English Channel to collect new aircraft frequently. While collecting one from Rochester, England on 12 August 1917 a Gotha raid occurred and within 30 minutes he was flying at 17,000 feet over Herne Bay in an attempt to intercept them. Once more, he returned without success against the high-flying Gothas. After landing from the sortie he was informed he was to be transferred to the recently formed No. 56 Squadron which was winning a reputation as a very successful unit over the Western Front. The unit was equipped with the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 (S.E.5a) fighters which were among the most effective combat aircraft of the war and arguably the best designed British fighter of the conflict. It was heavily armed and very fast for its time.

Along with the new fighter McCudden was eager to fly was the company he would be flying with. Albert Ball (44 victories), rising star Arthur Rhys-Davids (27) and McCudden&#x27;s former pupil Geoffrey Hilton Bowman (32) were just some of the fighter aces who flew with the unit. Though Ball was killed in May 1917, he would fly and fight alongside Rhys-Davids, Bowman, Richard Maybery, Reginald Hoidge and Keith Muspratt.

This competitive group would spur McCudden to increase his score. 56&#x27;s commanding officer, Major Richard Bloomfield noticed McCudden&#x27;s leadership qualities and had hoped he could help turn the unit into an effective fighting team. At present the pilots, though talented, performed more as individuals. After flying for the first time with them Bloomfield promised to have him allocated to a position of Flight Commander. He formally took command of B flight on 14 August.

McCudden brought his substantial technical knowledge to 56 Squadron. He frequently inspected his flight&#x27;s aircraft, expecting a high standard of mechanical refinement. He believed the finer the aircraft could be tuned the less likelihood there would be of losing pilots to structural or mechanical failures, which at that time were the cause of many fatalities among aircrew. Force-landings were rarely fatal owing to the low-landing speeds but the prospect of coming down behind enemy lines—especially since the RFC was adopting an offensive stance—was an undesirable prospect. Alex J. Gray, Air Mechanic First Class, 56 Squadron:
===Victories 8–57===
On 31 July the Third Battle of Ypres began and the unit was heavily involved. 56 was tasked with air superiority operations to allow RFC bomber and reconnaissance units to operate with relative freedom. The Germans had adopted a defensive stratagem of massing their aircraft, now increasingly outnumbered, at critical points of the front. Their units were also a collection of highly successful aces. The S.E.5s engaged in battle with the German fighters throughout the summer.

On 18 August 1917 McCudden scored his first victory as an official member of 56 Squadron over an Albatros D.V. Another the following day and two on 20 August raised his tally from 7 to 11 victories. He was pleased with his success but berated the armourers for the frequent gun-stoppages. Over the next four weeks his machine suffered engine difficulties and gun-jams. He could only claim damaged enemy aircraft and once suffered a galling experience when the DFW C.V reconnaissance he was attacking holed his engine while his guns jammed. It had to be sent for major repairs. He received a new fighter, B4863, which then became his regular mount.

McCudden was determined his machine would remain in first-class fighting order. He spent three days working with his fitters and armourers, stripping down the Vickers gun&#x27;s synchronising gear, firing at the butts and making eight test flights shooting at ground targets. His armourers joked that his guns would never work in the air if he wore them out on the ground. He continued to experience jams and his unclaimed victim of 14 September 1917—Ernst Wiegand—was able to escape and crash-land wounded in German territory thanks to another stoppage. Since his crash was not witnessed his claim went uncredited.

On 19 September he attacked a Rumpler C.IV which he drove down to 1,000 feet and saw camera and photographic plates fall from the machine as it took violent evasive action. He abandoned the chase and spotted another. This time he attacked from the sun and from behind and below. His Lewis gun stopped after one round but his Vickers fired 60 rounds and the Rumpler crashed behind enemy lines. Other pilots and gunners on the line confirmed the kill. A DFW C.V followed on 23 September—his 13th victory.

After this victory his flight engaged a Fokker Dr.I flown by the 48-victory ace Werner Voss and an Albatros piloted by Carl Menckhoff. Voss, aided by the frequent jams of his opponents&#x27; guns, avoided being hit and drove two S.E.5&#x27;s out of the fight before being fatally hit by Rhys-Davids. McCudden&#x27;s account of this fight has become famous:

Over the course of September and October McCudden added five victories including a LVG C.V on 26 September, raising his tally from 13 to 18. On 6 October he was awarded the Bar to his Military Cross. Another five in November brought his tally to 23. His method of diving behind and under the enemy machines before firing was working particularly well.
In December he downed another 14 enemies for victory numbers 24–37 including several during the Battle of Cambrai. His successes included four on 23 December, three on 28th and two on the 29th. In December 1917 he received the Distinguished Service Order and a Bar He received two congratulatory messages from AOC RFC Hugh Trenchard on 6 and 12 December:

McCudden had hardened to the realities of aerial combat by this time and revelled in his own success. He appeared to have limited empathy for his opponents, most of whom did not survive his attacks. On 24 January, after claiming his 43rd air victory, he remarked:

McCudden was now closing in on the tally of Albert Ball who was credited with 44 enemy aircraft. A further nine in January 1918 elevated his tally from 37 to 46. In February, 11 aircraft brought his tally to 57—four fell on the 16th. After achieving his 57th he probably downed a 58th—a Hannover CL.III—but it went down over enemy lines under control as McCudden&#x27;s guns seized having already fired 300 rounds at his first victim.

By this stage McCudden was suffering from combat fatigue. It manifested itself in his decisions, of late, to seek a victory at any price, which was alien to his normal, calculated approach to combat. Knowing he was to soon be sent home, he was obsessed with catching up to von Richthofen&#x27;s score. His contribution to 56 Squadron at this time was impressive; the unit had claimed 175 enemy aircraft while reporting 14 pilots killed and missing and seven captured. As Flight Commander, B Flight, McCudden&#x27;s pilots had shot down 77–52 of which were his—while losing four pilots. To celebrate his success he dined with Brigadier General John Higgins and the following evening was invited to the headquarters of General Julian Byng, General Officer Commanding the British Third Army, to be personally congratulated.

McCudden was soon rotated home on 5 March. More than 50 officers gathered for a formal farewell dinner and they presented him with a silver model of his S.E.5A on 4 March. McCudden would not see action again. In the remaining eight months of the war, only British pilots Billy Bishop (72) and Mick Mannock (61) and Raymond Collishaw (60) would surpass his total while serving with the RFC (and later the Royal Air Force—RAF). Ernst Udet (62) René Fonck (75) and Manfred von Richthofen (80) were the only foreign pilots to beat McCudden&#x27;s total.

===Modified S.E.5a===

McCudden&#x27;s long-term interest in mechanics prompted him to modify his own aircraft to increase combat performance. He made a series of modifications to his aircraft which caused them to excel in performance in comparison to any other S.E.5 at the front and perhaps any other German fighter available at the time. Performance, a generic term, required improvements in all-round capability. McCudden&#x27;s changes were made with one main objective in mind: high-altitude performance. He had achieved some success without these personal experiments. On 23 December 1917, for example, he intercepted an enemy aircraft at 18,000 feet and drove it down to 8,000 feet before shooting it down for his 30th victory. Incidentally, he was nearly killed in action when one of the wings broke away from his victim and nearly struck his own aircraft.

McCudden had always found it difficult to intercept high-flying German reconnaissance aircraft. The latest Rumpler C.VII which had entered service proved particularly elusive. With a 240 horse power engine, it could reach 24,000 feet and was thus beyond the reach of any prospective adversary. The average S.E.5, at that point, could reach only 17,000 feet. While most pilots were prepared to accept this tactical-technological situation, McCudden was not.

Through an as yet unspecified channel, he obtained high compression pistons used in the latest Hispano-Suiza 8 or V8 engine and fitted them to his power plant. It delivered revolutions at a much faster rate on the test bench. He removed any excess weight by shortening the exhaust pipes by several feet. He also added a spinner from a captured enemy aircraft which he believed added an extra 3 mph to his speed while also reducing the wing dihedral to increase agility.

A final alteration was to fit a simpler shutter (radiator vent) which had the object of warming the cockpit by directing heat from the engine. For McCudden this aspect was very important. At high altitude McCudden was to spend long periods of time in an extremely chilly environment. Operating the D.H.2 in 1916, he suffered terrible agonies as adequate blood circulation returned to his muscles once he reached . McCudden reported few general side-effects from high flight. Dizziness was a feature but he put this down to the cold rather than any form of anoxia. High altitude oxygen was too thin for humans which induced breathlessness. Aviation medicine was still in its infancy meaning pilots were left to solve operational problems themselves. Only the high-altitude bombers were equipped with oxygen equipment to assist with breathing. Despite his circulation difficulties, McCudden proved remarkably resistant to the effects of high altitude flying without oxygen.

The results of these personal modifications mostly went unrecorded. It is believed he achieved a height of 10,000 feet in nine minutes, curtailing the standard time by some five minutes. It was perhaps on exaggeration but no record remains to certify what McCudden did. He did note the maximum ground-level speed as 135 mph in his log book. He achieved these feats with the limited resources of a front-line squadron and without any official assistance.

Eager to test the modifications, he began operations on 28 January 1918. Until 16 February when 8491 was submitted for repair, he claimed his 45–50th aerial victories, the last at 11:30 on that date. His last victory that day was scored in another machine.

===War hero===
Unlike the German and French governments, the War Office had been reluctant to identify individual soldiers and aces for propaganda and public consumption, the most notable exception being Albert Ball. However, from December 1917 Viscount Northcliffe, the proprietor of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper was appointed to the Ministry of Information. Northcliffe was an enthusiast for aviation. He campaigned for &quot;air mindedness&quot;, when aircraft began to make technological headway and the nation, now facing the existence and efficiency of airships which could circumvent the North Sea and English Channel, was now increasingly concerned about aerial bombardment. Northcliffe supported the creation of the Air League and the Aerial League of the British Empire, a pressure group designed to impress upon a lethargic government the promising and threatening nature of aerial vehicles.

As head of the Ministry and &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, he felt an opportunity was being missed, and so ran a campaign in his publications to name outstanding individual combatants. On 3 January 1918 he ran a story in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; under the headline &quot;Our Unknown Air Heroes&quot;, which focused primarily on McCudden. In the front page segment it read: 
The campaign was an instant success. The &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot; echoed these sentiments with &quot;Young Lionheart of the Air&quot;. On 7 January the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; ran the story &quot;Our Wonderful Airmen—Their names at Last.&quot; The article was accompanied by a large photograph of McCudden and other pilots. Thereafter exploits of British airmen were routinely published. McCudden loathed the attention. In a letter to his father the following day he believed such &quot;bosh&quot; and hero worship would make him an unpopular figure in the RFC and with his comrades.

He was thankful to be posted to the No. 1 School of Aerial Fighting at Ayr in Scotland, where he flew the excellent performing Sopwith Snipe. It was in Scotland that he learned of the death of his brother, apparently shot down by the German ace Hans Wolff on 19 March. He wrote to his brother&#x27;s commanding officer, Sholto Douglas asking for any news but understanding the Major&#x27;s attention was now fixed on the German spring offensive. His death depressed McCudden greatly.

The same month he returned home, he was awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry. The letter from Trenchard confirming the King had bestowed this honour upon him was dated 30 March 1918. The award was gazetted on 29 March and the details were published on 2 April 1918. Shying away from this publicity, McCudden did not even tell his family of his attendance at Buckingham Palace on 6 April to receive his Victoria Cross from King George V and promotion to major. While on leave in London, he socialised a great deal with his friend Mick Mannock. He met C. G. Grey owner of &quot;The Aeroplane&quot; weeks later who offered to help McCudden finish his manuscript for his biography, &quot;Flying Fury&quot;, due for publication that year. McCudden accepted. Now famous, he also had his portrait painted by the known artist William Orpen.

==Death==

McCudden remained in England until July 1918 when he was given command of No. 60 Squadron RAF. He flew to Farnborough in a Vickers F.B.16 to collect his new Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a before returning to France to lead his new Squadron. On 3 July he flew back in this fighter and over his home in Kingston upon Thames, taking the aircraft to 17,000 feet and circling London for an hour. When he landed, he made his last entry into his log book. His total flying time had reached 872 hours and 40 minutes.

On the morning of 9 July 1918 he travelled to the home of his fiancée, Miss Alex-Tweedie in Whitehall Court. Tweedie recalled their conversation revolved around his new posting and his book. He had delivered the manuscript to Grey two days earlier, and was expecting its publication. While there, McCudden promised to surpass von Richthofen, who had been killed in action on 21 April 1918. In view of what happened to von Richthofen and John McCudden, he promised that &quot;I won&#x27;t bustle, or do anything foolish like my brother&quot;. He then went next door, and had breakfast with his sister Mary. Upon leaving, he fumbled around in his pocket and handed her a bulky envelope containing his Victoria Cross and other decorations. He took his leave of her and drove to Hounslow, where he climbed into his S.E.5a (C1126). He took off shortly after 13:00. McCudden certainly stopped &quot;en route&quot;, since about six o&#x27;clock that afternoon he called the AOC No. 13 Wing, Patrick Playfair, to announce his imminent arrival at Boffles, where No. 60 Squadron was stationed.

McCudden set out across the English Channel. Unsure of the dispositions on the ground after the German advance, he checked the airfield he suspected to be Boffles but found it empty. Flying in heavy mist he decided to head to Auxi-le-Château, France, to get directions from the RAF personnel stationed there. He approached Corporal W .H. Burdett and L. E. Vallins of 52 Squadron. Burdett had served with McCudden in 3 Squadron back in 1915. Burdett did not recognise him in his flying gear. They marked his map, and McCudden returned to his machine. Around 90 seconds after takeoff from Auxi-le-Château, the S.E.5a plunged into the ground. 8 Squadron&#x27;s Corporal W. H. Howard was on the scene within minutes and fought through the fire to free McCudden who was lying next to one of the wings—he had not worn his safety belt. Burdett followed and recognised the pilot as soon as his headgear had been removed. He was taken to No. 21 Casualty clearing station and diagnosed with a fractured skull. He did not regain consciousness, and died at 20:00.

Corporal Burdett later stated, &quot;When McCudden took off he put the machine into a nearly vertical climb, seemed to do a half-roll and then nosed dived into a wood... it was usual for scout pilots to perform some little stunt... I think that is what he was doing.&quot; Witness Lieutenant L. M. Fenton had a different view, &quot;the aircraft took off into wind and at about 100 feet did a vertical turn and flew back across the aerodrome by the side of the wood. The engine appeared to be running badly. The pilot rolled the machine, which failed to straighten out, at approximately 200 feet. It crashed nose down into the wood.&quot; Lieutenant E.M Greenwood stated he thought the crash was the result of a failed aerobatic manoeuvre: &quot;I was watching an S.E.5 flying over the aerodrome at about 200 feet, when it did one complete roll to the right, then dived steeply to the ground behind the trees.&quot; Lieutenant K. V. King believed a similar thing: &quot;[It flew]... very low over the aerodrome, going east towards the wood on the south-east side of the aerodrome. He had apparently been rolling. I saw him nose down and engine off entering the trees and immediately afterwards heard a crash.&quot; Lieutenant T. H. Barry, though supports the notion that something was amiss with the engine: &quot;I saw an S.E.5 flying from west to east across the aerodrome at 200–300 feet. The engine was firing irregularly. Just after crossing the end of the aerodrome the pilot did a sharp stalling turn. The nose dropped and it dived behind the trees. During this dive the noise of the engine ceased.&quot;

Usually reports were issued on any incident with every aircraft. On the date McCudden died, 29 such returns exist for S.E.5s but the report pertaining to his accident is not among them leaving the official cause of the crash unexplained. It is possible the engine failed due to a wrongly installed carburettor. However, there is some doubt as to whether a mechanical defect was the culprit. The witnesses reported the pilot was attempting low-level stunts, manifesting in several turns and rolls. Many years later other witnesses disputed the aircraft performed a roll, but all agreed the trouble began when the machine entered an attitude resembling a near-vertical turn.

McCudden&#x27;s remains were subsequently buried at the nearby Wavans war cemetery in the Pas de Calais. McCudden&#x27;s death occurred only two months after the death of German ace Manfred von Richthofen, whom some commented had been honoured with a longer and more elaborate funeral by the British. McCudden&#x27;s wartime score was 57 victories included 19 captured, 27 and 1 shared destroyed, 8 and 2 shared &quot;down out of control&quot;—an official classification which still counted the claim as a victory.

==Relics and memorial==
On the morning of 9 July, McCudden had handed his sister an envelope over breakfast, which was subsequently found to contain all of his medals. Today all of McCudden&#x27;s medals including his Victoria Cross are displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum in Gillingham, Kent, alongside those of two of his brothers and his father. The original brass engraved grave plaque used, along with a wooden propeller, are also displayed. The shattered windscreen from McCudden&#x27;s crashed S.E.5a is preserved in the collection of the Imperial War Museum. The museum&#x27;s collections also include McCudden&#x27;s uniform &#x27;maternity jacket&#x27; and a half-length portrait of McCudden by William Orpen. In March 2009, McCudden and his contemporary Edward Mannock, were the subjects of the BBC &quot;Timewatch&quot; episode, &quot;WWI Aces Falling.&quot;

<text>Henry William Murray, (1 December 1880 – 7 January 1966) was an Australian grazier, soldier, and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. Decorated several times throughout his service in the First World War, Murray rose from the rank of private to lieutenant colonel in three and a half years. He is often described as the most highly decorated infantry soldier of the British Empire during the First World War.

Born in Tasmania, Murray worked as a farmer, courier and timber cutter before enlisting in September 1914. Assigned to a machine gun crew, he served during the Gallipoli Campaign, where he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal before the withdrawal from the peninsula. He was later transferred along with the rest of his battalion to France for service on the Western Front, where he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order during the Battle of the Somme. In February 1917, Murray commanded a company during the battalion&#x27;s attack on the German position of Stormy Trench. During the engagement, the company was able to capture the position and repulse three fierce counter-attacks, with Murray often leading bayonet and bombing charges himself. For his actions during the battle, Murray was awarded the Victoria Cross. Soon after his Victoria Cross action, he was promoted to major and earned a Bar to his Distinguished Service Order during an attack on the Hindenburg Line near Bullecourt. Promoted to lieutenant colonel in early 1918, he assumed command of the 4th Machine Gun Battalion, where he would remain until the end of the war.

Returning to Australia in 1920, Murray eventually settled in Queensland, where he purchased the grazing farm that would be his home for the remainder of his life. Re-enlisting for service in the Second World War, he was appointed as commanding officer of the 26th (Militia) Battalion. Taking his discharge in 1944, Murray returned to his farm and died in 1966 at the age of 85.

==Early life==
Murray was born at Clairville, near Evandale, Tasmania, on 1 December 1880, the eighth of nine children of Edward Kennedy Murray, a farmer, and his wife Clarissa, née Littler. Descended from convicts on his father&#x27;s side, Murray was baptised on 23 November 1885, and attended Evandale State School. When he was fourteen years of age, his parents withdrew him from school to work on the family farm. However, his mother continued his education, placing emphasis on English. The family later moved to Northcote, near St Leonards, where Edward Murray died in 1904. Harry Murray joined the Launceston Volunteer Artillery Corps in 1902, serving until 1908, when he migrated to Western Australia where his two older brothers had previously settled.

Murray initially worked on his brother&#x27;s wheat farm, before becoming a courier for a mining company at Kookynie, transporting gold and mail by bicycle or on horseback. He travelled the same track on a fortnightly basis, gaining a reputation for being a crack shot with a .32 carbine that he carried. At the time of his enlistment in 1914, Murray was working near Manjimup, in the south west of Western Australia, employing timber cutters for the railways.

==First World War==
===Enlistment and training===
Murray enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in Perth on 30 September 1914. He declined the offer of a commission, and was posted as a private to A Company of the newly formed 16th Battalion, 4th Brigade. Appointed to one of the unit&#x27;s two machine gun crews, he was sent to Blackboy Hill Camp for training, where he became the gun No. 2, whose job it was to feed ammunition belts through the gun; Percy Black was No. 1 and the pair soon became firm friends.

On 21 November, the battalion entrained for Fremantle, boarding troopships headed for Melbourne; it was there that the four battalions combined to form the 4th Brigade under the command of Colonel John Monash. After completing their basic training in Victoria, the brigade left Port Melbourne aboard Troopship A40, &quot;Ceramic&quot; on 26 December. After a brief stop at Albany, Western Australia, they arrived in Egypt in early February 1915. The brigade marched from Alexandria to Heliopolis as part of the New Zealand and Australian Division of Major General Alexander Godley.

===Gallipoli===
The Allied commanders planned to defeat Turkey and force a supply route through to Russia via the Bosporus and the Black Sea. As such they planned a land invasion on the Gallipoli Peninsula. On the afternoon of 25 April 1915, Murray&#x27;s 16th Battalion landed at Ari Burnu, Gallipoli. Setting their machine gun on Pope&#x27;s Hill, Black and Murray fired their gun throughout the afternoon and into the night. The following day, the battalion&#x27;s two machine gun crews sniped at the Turkish soldiers on Russell&#x27;s Top, and Murray and his gunner continued fighting during the counterattack on 26–27 April, despite being wounded.
Promoted to lance corporal on 12 May, Murray was evacuated to Egypt eighteen days later, due to a gunshot wound to his right knee. His knee soon stiffened and he was posted to a hospital ship set to return to Australia. Murray, however, had other ideas and made his way to the wharf at Alexandria where he boarded a transport bound for Gallipoli. Arriving at the peninsula on 3 July, both Murray and Black received the Distinguished Conduct Medal for their actions between 9–31 May, during which time they tirelessly manned their machine gun, &quot;inflict[ing] serious losses upon the enemy&quot;. Murray was again wounded on 8 August when the machine gun section of the 4th Brigade covered the withdrawal after the attack on Hill 971. On 13 August, he was promoted to sergeant, commissioned as a second lieutenant and transferred to the 13th Battalion.

Murray was again evacuated to Egypt on 26 September due to dysentery. After nearly six weeks in the 2nd Australian General Hospital at Ghezireh, he rejoined the 13th Battalion at Gallipoli on 7 December, before leaving for the last time in the Allied evacuation later that month.

Returning to Egypt, the AIF expanded and was reorganised; the 13th Battalion was split and provided experienced soldiers for the 45th Battalion, while the 4th Brigade was combined with the 12th and 13th Brigades to form the 4th Australian Division. Murray was promoted to lieutenant on 20 January 1916, and then to captain on 1 March.

===Western Front: June 1916 to April 1917===
On 1 June 1916, the 13th Battalion embarked at Alexandria for Marseilles, France, before being deployed to the Western Front. In mid-June, the battalion moved into trenches at Bois Grenier near Armentières, and on 13 July they relocated to Bailleul, in time for the Battle of the Somme.

On 29 August, Murray commanded A Company—which consisted of fewer than one hundred men—in a successful attack that captured Mouquet Farm under heavy fire. His men repelled four German counterattacks before he ordered them to withdraw. He remained in command until the next morning, when he fainted from loss of blood from two wounds he had sustained during the action. Murray was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his service during the action, an event that was published in a supplement of &quot;The London Gazette&quot; dated 14 November 1916. He was later evacuated to England aboard the hospital ship &quot;Asturias&quot;, and admitted to the 4th General Hospital, London, where he was to share a ward with Albert Jacka and Percy Black, who were recovering from wounds received at Poziéres and Mouquet Farm respectively. After nearly six weeks of recuperation, he returned to the 13th Battalion in France on 19 October.

Following a period of patrols and trench raids, the 13th was relieved by the 5th Battalion on 6 December, and marched back to Ribemont, where Murray was granted leave to England. On 4 January 1917, he was Mentioned in Despatches. The battalion returned to the front in February, relieving the 15th Battalion at Gueudecourt. On 4 February, the battalion&#x27;s commanding officer received the order to attack Stormy Trench; it was during this action that Murray would earn his Victoria Cross (VC).

On the night of 4–5 February 1917, the 13th Battalion—with Murray commanding A Company—attacked the German position at Stormy Trench. Preceded by a heavy artillery barrage, A Company seized the right of the position after overcoming stiff resistance, consolidating their gains by setting up a makeshift barricade. The Germans counterattacked, prompting Murray to send an SOS signal to the artillery officer, calling for more support. Although repulsed, the Germans counterattacked twice more. On the third attack, Murray organised a twenty-man grenade bombing party and led them in a charge against their attackers, pushing them back to their original start line. On another occasion when the company lost some ground, Murray rallied his men and retook it. Between midnight and 03:00, the company maintained spasmodic bombing, repelling further assaults with the aid of artillery support. By 20:00 on 5 February, the 16th Battalion relieved Murray&#x27;s company, which had only 48 survivors from the 140 who had begun the attack.

The full citation for Murray&#x27;s VC appeared in a supplement to &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 10 March 1917, reading:

In April 1917, the battalion relocated to Bullecourt in preparation for an attack on the Hindenburg Line. On the night of 11 April, seven battalions of the 4th Australian Division assembled for the advance, which was launched at 04:30. Murray&#x27;s company seized a section of German trench, but were quickly isolated. By 07:00, ammunition was running low and casualties were high. Murray sent for artillery support, but conflicting messages meant that it was not provided, so the Australians were forced to withdraw. During the action, the 4th Division lost 2,339 of the 3,000 men that it had committed, with 1170 captured as prisoners of war. Among the dead was Percy Black, who had been killed while trying to find a gap in the barbwire surrounding the German trenches. Murray was awarded a Bar to his DSO for his efforts during the battle, and was promoted to temporary major. He was later informed by General Birdwood that had the attack at Bullecourt been successful, he would have instead been awarded a Bar to his VC.

===Western Front: April 1917 to repatriation, March 1920===
After Bullecourt, the 4th Brigade withdrew to Ribemont, where reinforcements brought it up to strength. During this period, Murray oversaw musketry training before being granted convalescent leave to London in May. While in the capital, he was decorated with his Victoria Cross and Distinguished Service Order by King George V in Hyde Park on 2 June 1917. Promoted major on 12 July, he rejoined his battalion later in the month, and during the 4th Brigade&#x27;s advance to the Hindenburg Line over subsequent months, was involved in actions at Messines, Ploegstreert Wood, Menin Road, Polygon Wood, Broodseinde, Poelcappelle and Passchendaele. For his actions at Passchendaele, Murray garnered a mention in Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig&#x27;s dispatch of 7 November 1917.

Following Passchendaele, the 4th Brigade spent three months in reserve. Murray became second in command of the 13th Battalion, frequently assuming temporary command of the unit while the commanding officer was absent. Granted leave to Paris from 12 January to 2 February 1918, he was promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel on 15 March and assumed command of the 4th Machine Gun Battalion. Commanding the unit during the German spring offensive, Murray&#x27;s rank was confirmed on 24 May.

On 25 June, Murray attended a conference at 4th Divisional Headquarters to discuss a proposed attack on Hamel. Having submitted a plan for the use of machine guns in the battle, five extra sections were attached to Murray&#x27;s battalion. The battle commenced on 4 July, and over the period of two days, the 4th Machine Gun Battalion fired 373,000 rounds of small arms ammunition, suffering 33 casualties. On 3 August, he attended another divisional conference regarding the planned attack near Amiens scheduled for 8 August. Lieutenant General John Monash&#x27;s instructions called for several of the 4th Machine Gun Battalion&#x27;s companies to be moved forward by Mark V tanks, accompanying different units during the battle. At the end of the three-day action, German General Erich Ludendorff described the Allied success as &quot;the black day of the German Army in this war&quot;.

From 23 September to 3 October 1918, Murray was seconded to the Headquarters of the United States II Corps as a liaison officer with the 27th Division. The 27th Division, along with the 30th Division, had been attached to Lieutenant General Monash&#x27;s Corps for the assault on the Bellicourt Tunnel of the Hindenburg Line. During his service with the Americans, Murray was recommended for the United States&#x27; Distinguished Service Medal by the commander of the 27th, Major General John F. O&#x27;Ryan. The Distinguished Service Medal is the highest non-valorous military and civilian decoration of the United States military, and in General O&#x27;Ryan&#x27;s recommendation he stated that Murray&#x27;s &quot;... knowledge, activity and fearlessness ... assisted materially in the control of the attacking forces&quot;.

The battle alongside the Americans was Murray&#x27;s last of the war, as the Australians were placed in reserve in early October before the signing of the Armistice on 11 November 1918. On 3 January 1919, Murray was awarded the French Croix de guerre for his service as commander of the 4th Machine Gun Battalion from 23 March to 24 April and 2–7 August 1918. On 30 May 1919, he was awarded a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George for his command of the 4th Machine Gun Battalion, the recommendation of which particularly citing his success during attacks on the Hindenburg Line. Murray&#x27;s final honour came on 11 July 1919, when he was Mentioned in Despatches for the fourth time, having received his third mention on 31 December 1918.

From June to September 1919, Murray—along with fellow Australian Victoria Cross recipient William Donovan Joynt—led parties of AIF members on a tour of the farming districts of Britain and Denmark to study agricultural methods under the education schemes. After touring through France and Belgium, he left England on 19 November 1919 aboard the Orient Line transport, &quot;Ormonde&quot;, along with Generals Birdwood and Monash. A month later, a large crowd celebrated the arrival of the two generals and Murray at Victoria Quay in Fremantle. Attempting to evade further fanfare, Murray quietly travelled to northern Tasmania and then to his sister&#x27;s house in Launceston. He was discharged from the AIF on 9 March 1920.

==Between the wars==

After his discharge, Murray moved north, buying a grazing property in south-eastern Queensland. On 13 October 1921, he married estate agent Constance Sophia Cameron at Bollon. The marriage was an unhappy one, and the pair separated in 1925 when Murray went to New Zealand. On 11 November 1927, with Constance Murray as petitioner, a decree nisi with costs against Henry Murray was granted on the grounds of desertion. Nine days later, at the Auckland Registrar&#x27;s Office, Murray married Ellen Perdon &quot;Nell&quot; Cameron; Constance&#x27;s niece. The couple returned to Queensland, and in April 1928 Murray bought Glenlyon station, Richmond, a 74,000 acre (29,947 ha) grazing property, where he lived for the rest of his life.

The Murrays had two children. Their son Douglas, born in 1930, was named after Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Grey Marks, the commanding officer of the 13th Battalion from 1917 to 1918. In 1934, Nell gave birth to their second child, a girl named Clementine. Between 1929 and 1939, Murray wrote fifteen articles for &quot;Reveille&quot;, the magazine of the New South Wales branch of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia (RSL), detailing several of his experiences during the First World War, and praising several of his comrades.

==Second World War and later life==
On 21 July 1939, with the Second World War looming, Murray volunteered for military service and was appointed as commanding officer of the 26th (Militia) Battalion, 11th Brigade, based in Townsville; he was mobilised for full-time service on 21 October 1941. Murray&#x27;s second-in-command of the unit during this time was Major Edgar Towner, who had additionally been decorated with the Victoria Cross in 1918. The 26th became a unit of the Second Australian Imperial Force in 1942, and in August Murray was removed from his post by General Sir Thomas Blamey, Commander in Chief Australian Military Forces, on the grounds of his advancing age. He was instead appointed to command the 23rd Queensland Regiment, Volunteer Defence Corps, which he led until his retirement from active duty on 8 February 1944.

With the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, wool prices soared and Murray earned a large income from wool sales, allowing him to regularly travel across Australia. Taking a trip to Brisbane in 1954, he met Queen Elizabeth II during her Royal Tour of Australia. Despite rarely attending Anzac Day services or functions for Victoria Cross recipients, Murray and his wife travelled to London in 1956 to commemorate the centenary of the Victoria Cross. Following the ceremonies, the Murrays spent five weeks on a motor tour of England and Scotland, before visiting Switzerland and France. However, Murray refused to revisit the battlefields.
On 6 January 1966, Nell was driving the family car with Harry as a passenger; they were going to the south coast of Queensland for a holiday. A tyre blew out and the car rolled on the Leichhardt Highway near Condamine. Murray was taken to Miles District Hospital with broken ribs. He had had heart trouble for some time, and the shock of the accident is believed to have caused his death the following day. Murray was interred at Mount Thompson Crematorium with full military honours after a funeral service at St Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, Brisbane.

In February 2006, Governor-General Michael Jeffery unveiled a statue of Murray by sculptor Peter Corlett in Evandale, Tasmania. This tribute was facilitated by a small group of volunteers who raised A$85,000 in two years. The Henry Murray ward at Hollywood Private Hospital has been named in his honour.

<text>Major-General George Randolph Pearkes (28 February 1888 – 30 May 1984) was a Canadian politician and soldier. He was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy awarded to British and Imperial forces; and the 20th lieutenant governor of British Columbia.

==Early life==
Born in England in Watford, Hertfordshire, on 28 February 1888, he was the oldest child of Louise and George Pearkes and attended Berkhamsted School. In 1906, he and his brother emigrated to Alberta, Canada, where they settled near Red Deer. In 1911, George joined the Royal North-West Mounted Police and served in Yukon until the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.

A comprehensive biography of Pearkes was written during his lifetime by Reginald Roy, based on 82 one-to-two-hour tape recorded interviews and considerable primary and secondary sources.

==Military career==
===First World War and Victoria Cross===

In 1915, Pearkes enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force 2nd Regiment, Canadian Mounted Rifles; transferring in September 1916 to the 5th Battalion Canadian Mounted Rifles. In the photo obtained from Library and Archives Canada (PA-002310) dated December 1917, Major Pearkes, 5th Canadian Mounted Rifles, is shown wearing the Military Cross service ribbon, but has not yet received the ribbon for the Victoria Cross. He is wearing four wound stripes on his sleeve.

Pearkes was 29 years old, and an acting major during the Battle of Passchendaele when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC):

During the war, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel. Aside from the VC, Pearkes was also awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and the Military Cross (MC).

===Between the wars===
Following the First World War he became a career officer in the army, and went to England in April 1919 to attend the Staff College, Camberley, for the first post-war course there. Among his fellow students there were Ronald Okeden Alexander, Bernard Freyberg, Alan Brooke, John Gort and Percy Hobart, all of whom would rise to high rank, as would John Dill, one of the instructors.

Upon his return to Canada, Pearkes was then appointed to Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI), one of the three infantry regiments of the regular Canadian Army, also known as the Permanent Active Militia (PAM) or the Permanent Force (PF). During the 1920s and early 1930s he was stationed as a staff officer in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and in Calgary, Alberta. He also served as staff officer at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario. In 1925 Pearkes married Constance Blytha Copeman, and they had two children.

In 1936, he attended the Imperial Defence College in London. Among his fellow students there were Frank McNamara and Sydney Rowell, both from Australia; other students included William Slim and Keith Park.

From 1938 to 1940 he was District Officer Commanding 13th Military District in Calgary. With the opening of hostilities with Germany in the Second World War, Brigadier Pearkes was given command of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade, a component of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, which comprised a number of units raised in western Canada.

===Second World War===
In December 1939, Pearkes, by then age 51, and his staff left for England where the 1st Division, commanded by Major General Andrew McNaughton, was finally concentrated in a single place as a formation. In February 1940 he developed a serious case of spinal meningitis and it was feared that he might die, with the situation becoming so serious that his wife and son were sent to England from Canada. Miraculously, however, he managed to recover and, in fact, met his wife and son upon their arrival.

In July 1940, after the surrender of France, Pearkes succeeded McNaughton in command of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division. n November 1941 Pearkes was asked to assume temporary command of the expanding Canadian Corps, taking the place of McNaughton who was on an extended leave. Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery of the British Army, whose opinions of Canadian officers were crucial in the careers of senior officers overseas in the mid-war period, said Pearkes was a &quot;gallant soldier&quot; albeit one who, in his opinion, possessed, &quot;little brains.&quot;

In August 1942 Pearkes was returned to Canada and became General Officer Commanding in Chief Pacific Command, primarily a home defence organization for western Canada. He oversaw defences on Canada&#x27;s West Coast.

In 1943 Pearkes was part of the planning for Operation Greenlight, retaking the Aleutian Islands from the Japanese.

In 1944, Pearkes was instrumental in suppressing the Terrace Mutiny, a revolt by conscripts stationed in Terrace, British Columbia, resulting from the announcement that conscripts would be deployed overseas. Although successful, Pearkes was extremely critical of the actions that led to it in the first place, stating he had been placed in the &quot;intolerable position of being ordered to enforce a policy which his past experience gained in applying similar policies has proven ruinous to discipline of [troops], and of being in an utterly dishonourable position, and [Pearkes said] that he will NOT issue instructions to his [junior commanders] placing them in an impossible situation.&quot;

When it became clear that the government was not considering deploying troops for the fighting in the Pacific, Pearkes requested a change of command, or to be allowed to retire. The Cabinet War Committee eventually decided on the latter, and he retired from the Army in February 1945. He went into federal politics, winning the Nanaimo, British Columbia, riding for the Progressive Conservative Party.

==Political career==
In the 1945 federal election, he was elected as a Progressive Conservative Party candidate in the riding of Nanaimo, British Columbia. He was re-elected in 1949. In the 1953 election, he was elected in the riding of Esquimalt—Saanich, British Columbia. He was re-elected in the 1957 and 1958 elections.

He was Minister of National Defence from 1957 to 1960 under Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. In 1958, Pearkes recommended that the Avro Arrow programme be cancelled.

<text>Robert Jones VC (19 August 1857 – 6 September 1898) was a Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross for his actions at the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift in January 1879, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. 

Jones was born at Penrhos, a hamlet to the north of Raglan in Monmouthshire, Wales.

==Military achievements==
Jones was 21 years old, serving as a private in the 2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot (later The South Wales Borderers), British Army in the Anglo-Zulu War. At Rorke&#x27;s Drift he and Pte. 593 William Jones were posted in a room of the hospital facing the hill.

The two men kept up a steady fire against enormous odds. Then, while one worked to cut a hole through the partition into the next room, the other shot Zulu after Zulu through the loopholed walls, using his own and his comrade&#x27;s rifle alternately as the barrels became too hot to hold from the incessant firing.

By their combined efforts the two men carried six patients to safety through the broken partition. A seventh, Sgt. Maxfield, was delirious and refused to be helped. When Robert Jones returned to take Maxfield to safety by force, he found him in his bed being stabbed by Zulus. Robert Jones suffered four assegai spear wounds, was struck by a bullet, and had minor burns.

After the battle, General Sir Garnet Wolseley awarded Robert and William Jones the VC at Utrecht, Transvaal.

==Later life==

After leaving the army, Jones settled in Herefordshire where he became a farm labourer. He married Elizabeth Hopkins. They had five children: Robert Jones, jr, Edith Emily East (née Jones), Alice Smith (née Jones) Lily Rose Griffiths (née Jones) and Ellen Kelly (née Jones) called Nellie by the family.

In 1898 Jones died in Peterchurch, Herefordshire, from gunshot wounds to the head at the age of 41. He had borrowed his employer&#x27;s shotgun to go crow-shooting. His death certificate records a verdict of suicide whilst being insane. The coroner heard that he was plagued by recurring nightmares arising from his desperate hand-to-hand combat with Zulus. Jones was buried at St Peter&#x27;s Church. Instead of being carried through the church gates into the graveyard, his coffin was taken over the wall due to the stigma of the time in regards to suicide. Jones&#x27; headstone was situated facing away from the church and his grave remains the only one in the churchyard to do so.

Jones&#x27; widow, Elizabeth, gave damning evidence at his inquest. She later married a William Tilbury, by whom she had two further children.

==Victoria Cross==
Jones&#x27; Victoria Cross passed out of the family. In 1996 Lord Ashcroft bought it at auction for £80,000. It is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

Ashcroft outbid both the South Wales Borderers&#x27; regimental museum and members of Jones&#x27; family. Members of the family had approached the regimental museum but had been told the museum were not in a position to bid but the museum did bid for the medal, and without realising it, family members who wanted to buy the Victoria Cross and donate it to the regimental museum unwittingly ended up bidding against the museum.

==Film==
In the 1964 film &quot;Zulu&quot;, actor Denys Graham played Jones.

<text>William Coffey VC DCM (5 August 1829 – 13 July 1875), born in Knocklong, County Limerick, was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 25 years old, and a private in the 34th Regiment (later The Border Regiment), British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 29 March 1855 at Sebastopol, the Crimea, Private Coffey threw a live shell, which had fallen into a trench, over the parapet and thus saved many lives.

==Further information==

Coffey was posted to Indian fighting in the Indian Mutiny. He achieved the rank of sergeant. It was reported that he died by suicide (shot himself) in the Army drill shed Sheffield, 13 July 1875. However his death certificate shows he died of dysentery at Stonegravels, Chesterfield. He was buried in Spital cemetery, Chesterfield. Originally he was buried in an unmarked, common plot but in 1970 a stone, provided by the Border Regiment, was put on his grave following a service.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at Cumbria&#x27;s Museum of Military Life Carlisle Castle, Cumbria, England.

<doc id="1222155" wikidata="Q17080043" url="?curid=1222155" title="Senioritis">
<text>Senioritis is the colloquial name for the decreased motivation toward education felt by students who are nearing the end of their high school, college, graduate school careers, or the end of a school year in general. Senioritis can, however, be described for any grade, although mostly said to occur in senior-level students. Senioritis is not a recognized medical condition, but a colloquial term (in the United States and Canada) that combines the word &quot;senior&quot; with the suffix &quot;-itis&quot;, which technically denotes inflammation but refers to a general illness in colloquial speech. 

== Consequences ==

In serious cases where students allow their grades to drop significantly, universities may rescind offers of admission. Nonetheless, most colleges rarely rescind admission offers, and even the most elite schools only revoke them from a very small number of students. 

The time gap between college and university admissions, which are usually decided by March or April, and final exams, which usually are not until early May (e.g. Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate classes), is a challenge to seniors who may be feeling unmotivated toward their schooling.

== Strategies to avoid senioritis ==
There are several strategies by which an individual with senioritis can mitigate its impact. For example, setting goals, including both short and long term, could motivate the student to remain on track to achieve their academic pursuits. Another strategy is taking breaks during mentally exhausting tasks, which could potentially alleviate some sensations of stress, and decrease educational burnout. One could also reward their accomplishments, no matter the size. This one can provide a sense of pride and help the person acknowledge what they have done. Lastly, an individual could avoid remaining in the same spot for too long.

== Proposed solutions ==
James Coleman, writer and Chairman of the President&#x27;s Panel of Youth, urged changes in the high school curriculum to address the problem of senioritis. These concerns gave rise to the implementation of a &quot;Senior Semester&quot; in many high schools throughout the country, which allowed seniors to spend time outside the school or attend seminars in their specific interests.

The College Board, the National Youth Leadership Council, and other youth-serving organizations suggest that there are many ways schools can help young people make the most of their senior year instead of succumbing to the temptation to take it easy once graduation is assured. Giving young people opportunities to make their academic work more meaningful through service-learning, or other forms of experiential education, can increase students&#x27; academic aspirations.

<doc id="1222161" wikidata="Q2052126" url="?curid=1222161" title="Pare Lorentz">
<text>Pare Lorentz (December 11, 1905 – March 4, 1992) was an American filmmaker known for his film work about the New Deal. Born Leonard MacTaggart Lorentz in Clarksburg, West Virginia he was educated at Buckhannon High School, West Virginia Wesleyan College, and West Virginia University. As a young film critic in both New York City and Hollywood, Lorentz spoke out against censorship in the film industry.

As the most influential documentary filmmaker of the Great Depression, Lorentz was the leading American advocate for government-sponsored documentary films. His service as a filmmaker for the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II was formidable, including technical films, documentation of bombing raids, and synthesizing raw footage of Nazi atrocities for an educational film on the Nuremberg Trials. Nonetheless, Lorentz perennially will be known best as &quot;FDR′s filmmaker.&quot;

==New Deal documentary films==
Lorentz left West Virginia University, in 1925, to begin a career as a writer and film critic in New York City. He contributed articles to leading magazines such as &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;Town and Country&quot;.

Lorentz also co-authored a 1929 book, &quot;Censored: the private life of the movie.&quot;

His work as a film critic led him to Hollywood, where he wrote several articles on censorship and &quot;The Roosevelt Year: 1933&quot;, a pictorial review of the first year of Franklin D. Roosevelt′s presidency. Roosevelt was impressed with the articles and the book, and in 1936, as president of the United States, invited Lorentz to make a government-sponsored film about the Oklahoma Dust Bowl.

Despite not having any film credits, Lorentz was appointed to the Resettlement Administration as a film consultant. He was given to make a film, which became &quot;The Plow That Broke the Plains&quot;, a film that showed the natural and man–made devastation caused by the Dust Bowl. Though the tight budget and his inexperience occasionally showed through in the film, Lorentz&#x27;s script, combined with Thomas Hardie Chalmers′s narration and Virgil Thomson′s score, made the 30-minute movie powerful and moving. The film, which had its first public showing on May 10, 1936 at Washington, D.C′s Mayflower Hotel, had a preview screening in March at the White House. Roosevelt was impressed and, after his re-election in 1936, gave Lorentz the opportunity to make a film about one of the president&#x27;s favorite subjects: conservation. Lorentz made &quot;The River&quot;, a film celebrating the exploits of the Tennessee Valley Authority.

The TVA mitigated flooding but, more importantly to Lorentz and to Roosevelt, it put a stop to the prodigious pillaging of the forests by providing cheap, readily available hydro–electric power to a wide area. This film won the Best Documentary at the Venice International Film Festival. The text of &quot;The River&quot; appeared in book form, and was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize in poetry the same year. It generally is considered his most masterful work.

When Republicans gained seats in Congress in 1938, and the congressional balance of power shifted in a more conservative direction, the pipeline of federal commissions for projects like Lorentz&#x27;s were halted along with the short-lived existence of the US Film Service, which Lorentz headed. In 1940, he produced &quot;Power and the Land&quot; promoting the Rural Electric Administration. The REA took over its own production, and the film was directed by Joris Ivens, the prolific Dutch filmmaker best known for his anti–fascist documentaries.

Before the U.S. involvement in World War II, Lorentz made &quot;The Fight for Life&quot; (1940), a semi-documentary on the struggle to provide adequate natal (obstetric) care at the Chicago Maternity Center, based on a book by Paul de Kruif. John Steinbeck worked on the project with Lorentz.

He made a film for RKO &quot;Name, Age and Occupation&quot; that was never completed.

==U.S. Army Air Corps World War II films==
Lorentz served in the U.S. Army Air Corps, more specifically the Air Transport Command (ATC), accompanied by Floyd Crosby, who became an outstanding cinematographer during World War II. He was promoted to the rank of colonel. While serving, he made 275 pilot navigational films and minor documentaries for the U.S. Office of War Information (OWI) and the U.S. Information Agency (USIA), and filmed over 2,500 hours of bombing raids. (Note: Lorentz&#x27;s name is not associated with any OWI or USIA films; his son Pare Lorentz, Jr., may have worked on a USIA film though most of his work was for USAID.) In 1946, Lorentz made a federally funded movie about the Nuremberg trials, intended to help educate the German people as to what had happened during the war. In the process of compiling material, Lorentz reviewed over 1 million hours of footage about the Nazis and their atrocities. &quot;Nuremberg&quot;, the film that resulted, played to &quot;capacity audiences&quot; in Germany for two years. However, it was not released in the United States until 1979. This film was produced for the Civil Affairs Division of the Government of Military Occupation (OMGUS). Lorentz&#x27;s role and contributions to this production are not entirely clear because he prematurely resigned and the Hollywood director Budd Schulberg is given credit for completing it.

==Later life and legacy==
In the prosperity of the post–War period, there was no revival of partnerships with the federal government. He had ambitious plans to make documentaries about the New Deal and the United Nations, but funding was not available from government or private sources. His final film was &quot;Rural Co-op&quot;, which he wrote and directed in 1947.

Lorentz lived a quiet life among the country gentry north of New York City in the upscale town of Armonk, New York until his death in 1992.

The International Documentary Association named its Pare Lorentz Documentary Fund, as well as the Pare Lorentz Film Festival and its grand prize in honor of Lorentz, granted to individuals whose work best represents the &quot;democratic sensibility, activist spirit and lyrical vision&quot; of Lorentz.&quot;

<text>Thain Wendell MacDowell, VC, DSO (September 16, 1890 – March 28, 1960), was a Canadian soldier. MacDowell was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Overview==

Thain Wendell MacDowell was born in Lachute, Quebec on 16 September 1890. His early days were spent in the Brockville, Ontario area, where he was educated at Brockville Collegiate Institute and joined the 41st Regiment Brockville Rifles. He later attended the University of Toronto, where he joined the Canadian Officer Training Corps as an Officer Cadet of The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada for four months. After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1914, he enlisted and was commissioned in the 38th (Ottawa) Canadian Infantry Battalion (now perpetuated as The Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa (Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Own)).

During service in France in 1916, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on the Somme, and the following year, promoted to Major, he was conferred the Victoria Cross for gallantry at Vimy Ridge on 9 April.

===Victoria Cross===

One of four soldiers to earn the Victoria Cross in the Battle of Vimy Ridge, one of two to survive the battle and the only one to survive the war, (the others were Ellis Wellwood Sifton, William Johnstone Milne and John George Pattison), MacDowell was 26 years old, and a captain in the 38th (Ottawa) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War when he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 9 April 1917 at Vimy Ridge, France, Captain MacDowell, with the assistance of two runners (company orderlies, Pvts. James T. Kobus and Arthur James Hay, both of whom were awarded the DCM for their part) reached the German position ahead of his company. After destroying one machine-gun nest he chased the crew from another. MacDowell then spotted one German going into a tunnel. At the base of the tunnel, MacDowell was able to bluff the Germans to think he was part of a much larger force, resulting in the surrendering of two German officers and 75 German soldiers. He sent the prisoners up out the tunnel in groups of 12 so that Kobus and Hay could take them back to the Canadian line. Seeing that he had been fooled, a German prisoner grabbed a rifle and tried to shoot one of the runners. The German was then shot and killed.

Although wounded in the hand, MacDowell continued for five days to hold the position gained, in spite of heavy shellfire, until eventually relieved by his battalion. He was promoted to the rank of Major following his actions at Vimy Ridge.

==Later life==

He later achieved the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel of the Frontenac Regiment from Napanee, Ontario. After the war, Colonel MacDowell served as an executive of several mining and chemical companies, and from 1923 to 1928, he acted as private secretary to the Minister of National Defence. He was placed on the retired list as a Lieutenant-Colonel.

In July 1929, he married Norah Jean Hodgson, of Montreal. They first lived in Toronto, but moved to Montreal in 1931. He had two sons, Thain W., who died in 2015, and Angus J., who died in 2018. His wife (Norah Jean MacDowell) died on 1 November 1983. He also had three grand children: A. Stuart, Patricia E, And Kenneth R.

He died in Nassau, the Bahamas, on 28 March 1960. Colonel MacDowell is buried at Oakland Cemetery (R.R.3, Brockville, Ontario, Canada. Anglican Section 3. Lot 112), in the Richardson family plot. The grave is marked by a headstone.

==Legacy==

The Director of National Defence erected a memorial range at the Connaught Ranges and Primary Training Centre
in Ottawa, Ontario which was named in honour of LCol Thain Wendell MacDowell VC, DSO (1890-1960).

Colonel MacDowell&#x27;s Victoria Cross is on display at the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario. There is a plaque in his honour on corner of Highway 2 and Church Street in Maitland, Ontario.

<text>William George Drummond Stewart, VC (February 1831 – 19 October 1868) was a British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Crimean War==
George (as he was known) Stewart was the son of Captain Sir William Drummond Stewart, 19th Laird of Grantully and 7th Baronet of Murthly, and his wife Maria Christina (&quot;née&quot; Battersby). He was born in February 1831 at Grandtully Castle near Pitlochry in Perthshire.

He entered the Army on 2 June 1847 as an Ensign in the 93rd Sutherland Highlanders. After four years home service, he attained his promotion as Lieutenant, becoming a Captain two years later on 29 December 1854. In February 1854, on the outbreak of war with Russia, the 93rd Highlanders embarked for the Crimea, where they were destined to see much fighting and to win great renown.

Stewart was present at the Battle of Alma on 20 September that year, when the 93rd, as part of the Highland Brigade, 1st Division, stormed the Great Russian Battery on the Alma Heights with the other Highland Regiments and Foot Guards (93rd losses: 1 officer, 54 men). He was also present at the Battle of Balaklava a month later on 25 October, where the 93rd alone formed the now famous &#x27;Thin Red Line&#x27; which, unsupported, repulsed the charge of a large body of the enemy&#x27;s cavalry, and thereby prevented a direct assault on the port of Balaklava. He also served in the Siege of Sevastopol through the winter of 1854/5. He was wounded in the trenches above the besieged port, and remained in the Crimea until July 1856, when his regiment returned to England.

For his services in the Campaign, Stewart received the Crimean Medal with clasp for Alma, Balaclava and Sebastopol, the Turkish Medal and the Order of the Medjidie (5th class).

==Indian Mutiny==
The following summer found the 93rd on its way to India, where the laurels gained in the Crimea were to be more than doubled. The regiment reached Calcutta in September 1857, just in time to join Sir Colin Campbell&#x27;s advance to relieve the Siege of Lucknow. The heroic achievements of Sir Colin&#x27;s few forces are now matters of history, foremost among them stand the operations of 16 November: the Capture of the &quot;Secunderabagh&quot; and the &quot;Shah Najaf&quot;, deeds with which the name of the 93rd will ever be associated. The first VC exploit of that day was undertaken by Captain George Stewart, whose action was witnessed by Surgeon William Munro of the 93rd Highlanders.

While the artillery was being brought to bear on the &quot;Sikandarabagh&quot;, Capt. Stewart, with some Highlanders and a few of the 53rd Regiment of Foot, advanced towards two of the enemy&#x27;s guns, which were maintaining a heavy flanking fire and which covered the approach to the barracks, a large cross-shaped building surrounded by outhouses. Stewart captured the guns in a most gallant manner, and by this means his force was able to gain possession of the barracks . Field Marshal The Lord Roberts described the action as &quot;serviceable as it was heroic, for it silenced the fire most destructive to the attacking force&quot;. The possession of this building secured the left of the British advance, and greatly facilitated the ultimate withdrawal of the garrison of Lucknow.

Stewart was 26 years old, and a captain in the 93rd (Sutherland) Highlanders when he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his above actions at Lucknow. He was gazetted on 24 December 1858 and his citation read:
Six Victoria Crosses in all were bestowed on the 93rd Highlanders for their gallantry on 16 November, but Sir Colin Campbell decided, perhaps fearing that he might be accused of partiality, that only one of these should be given to the officers. Votes were taken and Capt. Stewart was chosen by his brother officers to receive the much prized honour. A total of 18 Victoria Crosses were awarded to British forces at Lucknow on 16 November 1857, the largest number ever awarded in a single day.

After the withdrawal of the Lucknow garrison, Sir Colin&#x27;s Army was hurried back to Cawnpore. Stewart took part in the great battle which ensued there on 6 December. His regiment was in the thick of the fighting, and two days later, it formed part of the force under Sir Hope Grant. It completed the destruction of the Gwalior rebels as they were attempting to cross the Ganges at Oude. After two months of minor operations, the 93rd fought its way in to Lucknow under Sir Colin Campbell, and distinguished itself as on the previous occasion. Stewart took part in the storming of the Mogum&#x27;s Palace on 11 March 1858,and, with characteristic daring, led a small party beyond the building in pursuit of the mutineers.

With Lucknow captured, the 93rd was sent into &quot;Rohilkand&quot; under Brigadier-General Walpole, helped to defeat the enemy at &quot;Alaganj&quot;, and fought under Sir Colin Campbell at Bareilly. There the regiment remained throughout the hot weather. In the following winter, it took part in the pacification of Oude, which was finally accomplished by the beginning of 1859.

For his services in this campaign, besides the Victoria Cross, Capt. Stewart received the mutiny medal with clasp for Lucknow.

William Stewart was promoted Major but left the Army in 1860. On 19 October 1868, while at Hythe, Hampshire, Stewart was giving a demonstration of sword swallowing. His trick went fatally wrong and he died from internal injuries a week later, on 26 October. William Stewart predeceased his father.

<text>Alfred Edward Sephton VC (19 April 1911 – 19 May 1941) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 30 years old, and a petty officer in the Royal Navy during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 18 May 1941 in the Mediterranean, south of Crete, Petty Officer Sephton was a director layer on HMS &quot;Coventry&quot; when she went to the assistance of a hospital ship which was being attacked by German dive-bombers. When the enemy engaged &quot;Coventry&quot;, strafing her with machine-gun fire, Petty Officer Sephton was mortally wounded, a bullet actually passing through his body and injuring an able seaman beside him. Although in great pain and partially blinded, nevertheless he stuck to his instruments and carried out his duties until the attack was over. He died of his injuries next day.

Sephton&#x27;s Victoria Cross was stolen from Coventry Cathedral in 1990.

<text>Charles Smith Rutherford (9 February 1892 – 11 June 1989) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early years==
Rutherford was born on a farm in Colborne, Ontario on 9 January 1892. He joined The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada in 1916 and was posted to the 5th Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles, CEF.

==World War I==
He began his service in the ranks, and as a sergeant was awarded the Military Medal on 23 February 1918. After being commissioned, he was also awarded the Military Cross, the full citation was not published until after that of his VC, in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 10 January 1919 (dated 11 January 1919):

Rutherford was 26 years old serving in the 4th Battle of the Scarpe near Monchy, France, when he was awarded the Victoria Cross. On 26 August 1918, while commanding an assaulting party, he found himself a considerable distance ahead of his men and at the same moment saw a fully armed strong enemy party outside a pill-box in front of him. By masterly bluff, he managed to persuade the enemy that they were surrounded and the whole party of 45, including two officers and three machine-guns, surrendered. The lieutenant then observed that gunfire from another pill-box was holding up the assault, so with a Lewis gun section he attacked it capturing another 35 prisoners and their guns. The full citation was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 12 November 1918 (dated 15 November 1918):

He later achieved the rank of captain.

==Post World War I==

From 1934 to 1940, Rutherford was the Sergeant at Arms of the Ontario Legislature when Mitchell Hepburn was Premier. He was the first sergeant to eject a member of the Legislature.

During World War II he served with the Veterans Guard of Canada, reaching the rank of Captain.

C.S. Rutherford was the last recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War I to die, on 11 June 1989 at the age of 97. He is buried at The Union Cemetery, Colborne, Ontario, Canada.

The location of Rutherford&#x27;s medals is not public knowledge.

<doc id="1222173" wikidata="Q5544091" url="?curid=1222173" title="George Roupell">
<text>Brigadier George Rowland Patrick Roupell, (7 April 1892 – 4 March 1974) was a senior officer in the British Army and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and military career==
George Roupell was born into a military family; his father, Francis Frederick Fyler Roupell, having served with the British Army in the 70th Regiment and commanded the 1st Battalion, East Surrey Regiment from 1895 to 1899, and was promoted to colonel in 1901. George&#x27;s father had married Edith Maria Bryden at Kingston in 1887.

Roupell was educated at Rossall School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned into the East Surrey Regiment, his father&#x27;s regiment, on 2 March 1912 and was appointed a lieutenant on 29 April 1914, shortly before the outbreak of the First World War.

==First World War==
At the outbreak of war in the summer of 1914, the 1st Battalion the East Surreys were deployed as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) into northern Belgium. Roupell commanded a platoon in the BEF&#x27;s first major action, the Battle of Mons, in August 1914. Roupell kept a diary throughout the war, which has since been a, sometimes humorous, source of insight and observation on the events that he witnessed and participated in. In the trenches at Mons he recounted how he had to hit his men on the backside with his sword in order to gain their attention and remind them to fire low as they had been taught.

Soon after, following the retreat from Mons in September 1914, Roupell led his platoon in the first Battle of the Aisne. Once again, he came under heavy fire, this time while crossing the Aisne on a raft. The Surreys&#x27; advance was pushed back with heavy casualties.

Early the following year, during the continued fighting around Ypres, Roupell was 23 years old when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). His citation reads:

Roupell was presented with his VC by King George V on 12 July 1915. In addition to his Victoria Cross, he was awarded the Russian Order of St George (4th Class) and the French Croix de Guerre, and was Mentioned in Despatches. He was retrospectively appointed temporary captain with effect from 29 December 1914 to 20 April 1915, inclusive, and again later the same year.

Roupell was aboard when it was captured and sunk in the English Channel in October 1916. He was appointed acting brigade major on 29 December 1917. On 9 May 1918, he was seconded to the general staff with the rank of temporary major.

==Inter-war==
Following the end of hostilities in Europe, Roupell, still an acting major, was promoted to acting lieutenant colonel in charge of a battalion from December 1918 to March 1919. His appointment to the general staff was confirmed on 1 July 1919. During this time he was attached to the allied force under Edmund Ironside and sent to support Tsarist Russians as part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. On a visit to a Tsarist unit, they mutinied and Roupell and others were taken prisoner near Arkhangelsk, sent to Moscow, and finally repatriated in 1920.

Early in 1921, Roupell married Doris P. Sant in Paddington. Daughter Phoebe and son Peter were born in 1922 and 1925, respectively.

Roupell&#x27;s inter-war military career continued with appointments as staff captain (1921), brigade major (1926), and promotion to substantive major (1928). During the inter-war period, Roupell served in Gibraltar, the Regimental Depot, India and the Sudan and he attended the Staff College, Camberley. As major (GSO2), Roupell spent two years from 1929 at the Royal Military College of Canada, and in 1934 a year with the British troops in China. Following his return, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel (1935).

==Second World War==
At the outbreak of the Second World War, in September 1939, Roupell was promoted to colonel and, made an acting brigadier, placed in command of 36th Infantry Brigade from 7 October 1939. Roupell&#x27;s brigade was deployed as part of the 12th (Eastern) Infantry Division in April 1940 and became part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), taking part in the Battle of France. The German thrust near the Somme river towards Abbeville eventually cut off the BEF, northern French and Belgian forces from the rest of France. Roupell&#x27;s brigade headquarters near Doullens was attacked by enemy troops and on being told of the threat Roupell is reported to have exclaimed:

When the brigade headquarters was overrun on 20 May 1940, Roupell gave the order for the survivors to split up into small groups and endeavour to re-contact Allied troops. Roupell, with a captain and French interpreter, avoided capture, hiding by day and walking at night for over a month. They arrived at a farm near Rouen where the two officers remained for almost two years, working as labourers. With the help of the French Resistance they were moved through unoccupied France into non-belligerent Spain, finally boarding ship in Gibraltar and returning to the United Kingdom.

Following his return he was appointed commanding officer of the 114th Infantry Brigade, part of the 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division, on 18 March 1943, a command he held until 2 November that year. The brigade was not destined to see battle, however, and he was soon appointed as garrison commander at Chatham, where he remained until retirement.

==Post-war==
In 1946 Roupell was formally retired from the army on retirement pay and granted the honorary rank of brigadier. and, at the age of 58, excused from the reserve list of officers in 1950. He was appointed a Deputy lieutenant of Surrey in 1953.

In 1954 Roupell was appointed Colonel of the East Surreys, succeeding Lieutenant General Arthur Dowler, and was to be the last Colonel of the East Surrey Regiment, relinquishing office in 1959 when amalgamation with the Queen&#x27;s Royal Regiment (West Surrey) took place to form the Queen&#x27;s Royal Surrey Regiment. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1956.

George Roupell died in Shalford, Surrey, on 4 March 1974, at the age of 81. His body was cremated at Guildford Crematorium. where his ashes were scattered.

<text>Sergeant Maurice Albert Wyndham Rogers, VC, MM (17 July 1919 – 3 June 1944) was a British Army soldier of the Second World War and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Rogers was 24 years old, and a sergeant in the 2nd Battalion, Wiltshire Regiment (Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s), British Army, during the Battle of Anzio when the following deed took place, at Ardea, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

The citation in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 8 August 1944, gives the following details:

==Legacy==

In 2003 Rogers had a road named after him. A new industrial estate had been built at Hopton, Devizes, Wiltshire (near to the old Le Marchant Barracks) and the road has been called &quot;Sgt Rogers Way&quot;. The road sign gives his full name and location and year of the VC award.

In 1947 a new housing estate, comprising two large low rise blocks of flats, in Bethnal Green east London was named &#x27;Rogers Estate&#x27; after him. One of the blocks has a bronze plaque attached to the exterior at ground floor level commemorating this. Rogers parents were in attendance at the opening ceremony.

His story was published as the cover story for D.C. Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Victor comic&quot; in issue 204 dated 16 January 1965.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Rifles (Berkshire and Wiltshire) Museum in Salisbury, Wiltshire.

<text>Rear Admiral Eric Gascoigne Robinson (16 May 1882 – 20 August 1965) was a Royal Navy officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross. He earned his award by going ashore and single-handedly destroying a Turkish naval gun battery while a lieutenant commander with the fleet stationed off the Dardanelles during the Gallipoli campaign in the First World War.

After these exploits, he was wounded on the front line on the Gallipoli Peninsula, but recovered and served continuously for the remainder of the war and into the Russian Civil War. In 1939 aged 57, he again volunteered for military service and spent three more years at sea, commanding convoys during the Battle of the Atlantic. In September 1941 he had to retire on health grounds, but in June 1942 he was well enough to be appointed to the post of Naval Officer in Charge, Dundee. which he held until his final retirement in November 1944. 

==Early life==
Eric Gascoigne Robinson was born in 1882 at Greenwich in Kent, to John Lovell Robinson and Louisa Aveline Gascoigne. John was the chaplain of the Royal Naval College at Greenwich and Eric&#x27;s youth was spent in preparation for a life at sea. Robinson was educated at St John&#x27;s School, Leatherhead before joining HMS &quot;Britannia&quot; aged fifteen in 1897 and rapidly progressed to the battleship and then the first class protected cruiser , in which he took part in suppressing the Boxer Rebellion in China. It was here, aged 18, that he saw his first action with the relief force, being wounded in action, mentioned in despatches and gaining a reputation as a daring and resourceful officer. He remained in China serving on a Yangtze gunboat for several years before returning to England and becoming a torpedo specialist at , Portsmouth, in 1907.

In 1910, Robinson was promoted to Lieutenant Commander and spent his time between HMS &quot;Vernon&quot;, the depot ship and the cruisers and on active service. In 1913, he married Edith Gladys Cordeux, with whom he had three children. Robinson was slightly injured in a train accident shortly after his wedding, but soon recovered and was dispatched to the Mediterranean Sea at the outbreak of the First World War on board the old battleship .

==Gallipoli campaign and the Victoria Cross==
The exploit in his Victoria Cross nomination was the result of Robinson&#x27;s close friendship and working relationship with another aggressive officer, Roger Keyes, whom he had first met in China fifteen years before. Keyes was asked by his superior, Admiral John de Robeck, to prepare an assault on the Turkish gun battery at Orkanieh (also known as Achilles&#x27; Tomb), a position between Kum Kale and Yeni Shehr on the southern shore of the Dardanelles. This position had withstood fire from the battleships of the Allied fleet during the preceding weeks. Robinson was suggested as the leader of a commando force of sailors and Royal Marines tasked with destroying the battery and withdrawing in good order. 
Robinson accepted the mission without hesitation. His force landed undetected early in the morning of 26 February, destroyed two small artillery pieces and made fast progress towards the main battery before being pinned down by Turkish snipers in the mid-afternoon. The white naval uniforms of the sailors proved an easy target for the Turks and casualties mounted as Turkish reinforcements were brought up to cut off the raiding party. Instead of withdrawing in the face of this threat, Robinson marched his men through gullies and came out close to a small rise behind the main battery. The open ground of the rise was covered by several Turkish snipers, but realising the importance of removing the artillery overlooking the sea passage, Robinson delegated command of the party to a junior officer and made the climb alone, dodging bullets in his white uniform until he crested the rise unhurt, emerging a few minutes later and starting back apparently unconcerned by the increasingly heavy gunfire directed at him. He was said to be &quot;strolling around ... under heavy rifle fire ... like a sparrow enjoying a bath from a garden hose&quot;. The battery had been ungarrisoned, and Robinson was able to lay fuses which destroyed the large 9.4&quot; main gun and two anti-aircraft emplacements within the position. Withdrawing in good order, Robinson evaded the Turkish reinforcements and then directed gunfire from the fleet onto their positions, including a force garrisoning an ancient tomb, inflicting heavy casualties. An immediate recommendation for the Victoria Cross was put forward by Admiral de Robeck who had observed proceedings from offshore.

During March 1915 the Allied fleet attempted to clear the minefields that were preventing the warships from sailing further into the Dardanelles. Trawlers, crewed by civilians, were used in this role but intense gunfire from Turkish shore based batteries meant that they were ineffective. Under pressure from the Admiralty, Admiral Carden put Roger Keyes in charge of minesweeping operations and Keyes again called on Eric Robinson to lead the trawlers, now including naval crews, into the minefields. On one of these sorties, Robinson&#x27;s minesweeper was struck 84 times by small calibre shells. Despite the bravery shown during these operations the sweepers were unable to clear the lines of mines.
The Allies made a final attempt to force the narrows on the 18th March but this resulted in the sinking of three battleships and serious damage to three more.

===E15 mission===
 Robinson volunteered in April for an even more dangerous mission, following the Turkish capture of submarine HMS &quot;E15&quot; which had stranded below the guns of Fort Dardanus near Kepez Point. All efforts to destroy this craft had so far failed and it was considered vital for naval morale that it was not salvaged by the enemy. Robinson took command of two picket boats from the battleships and , each armed with two torpedoes mounted on the gunwales in dropping gear, and entered the Dardanelles under cover of darkness on 18 April. Caught in a blaze of searchlights, and under heavy fire from the Turkish artillery and machine guns, both boats miraculously arrived unscathed. A carelessly-directed Turkish searchlight briefly illuminated &quot;E15&quot;. The boat from HMS &quot;Majestic&quot; under the command of Lt Goodwin seized the opportunity and attacked. The first torpedo missed, and seconds later the boat was struck by a shell that blew away much of her stern, mortally wounding one of her crew and causing her irreparable damage. Undeterred, Goodwin went in again and scored a direct hit with his second torpedo, just forward of the conning tower, wrecking the submarine. 

Observing his consort&#x27;s plight, Robinson did not hesitate, steaming to the stricken vessel and rescuing her crew before escaping downstream to Mudros. It was estimated that the Turks fired at least 500 heavy calibre rounds of ammunition at the two boats in just a few minutes. A German officer present noted that &quot;I have never on the course of the war seen an attack carried out with such pluck and fearlessness&quot;. It has also been commented that this action should have brought Robinson a second Victoria Cross, but he was promoted to Commander by special decree instead.

===Later war service===
In August, Robinson was sent to Anzac Cove as a naval liaison officer and on his second day there, was badly wounded near the front line, forcing his evacuation to the UK, where King George V presented him with his medal at Buckingham Palace. Returned to the Mediterranean in December 1915 following his recuperation, he took over the coastal monitor HMS &quot;M21&quot;, in which he shelled Turkish positions throughout Egypt and Palestine and was awarded another mention in despatches and the Egyptian Order of the Nile, 4th Class. Returning to England in the summer of 1917, he narrowly missed selection for Keyes&#x27;s operations against Zeebrugge and Ostend owing to his war wounds. In late 1918 he commanded the secret DCB Section of the Royal Signals School, Portsmouth which was developing unmanned remote controlled boats (a variant of Coastal Motor Boats) carrying an explosive payload to destroy enemy ships. The war ended before these could be used in action but in January 1919 Robinson was posted with 12 CMBs to the Caspian Sea under Commodore Norris as part of the Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War. His first action was to force the surrender of vessels of the Centro-Caspian Flotilla, whose loyalty to the White movement was in doubt. He then converted two requisitioned merchant ships to carry CMBs in order to increase their range of operation. On the 21st May. Robinson was present at the Battle of Alexandrovsky Fort but owing to communication problems his CMBs were not brought into action. Two days later, Norris decided to reconnoitre the fort with two armed merchant ships but ran into two enemy destroyers. Fleeing the superior enemy, Norris radioed Robinson who was close by with one of the CMB carriers, to withdraw to safety. Robinson ignored this order and sailed towards the enemy. The Russian commander spotted the smoke of his ship on the horizon and, fearing that he was being led into a trap, turned and fled. The Bolshevik naval forces later withdrew from Fort Alexandrovsky and Robinson led a squadron of CMBs in an attack on the harbour which resulted in the surrender of the garrison. These achievements would later win him the Imperial Russian Order of St. Anne, 2nd Class. 

==Peacetime and Second World War service==

Following this period of extended service, Robinson was brought home, appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire by the King for his Caspian Sea service, promoted again to captain and posted to HMS &quot;Iron Duke&quot;. Robinson then served in a number of training establishments and dockyards, as well as a brief stint with the Far East Fleet, during which he received the Japanese Order of the Sacred Treasure, Third Class for his services. In 1925, he was inducted into the Freemasons and remained a prominent member of the Navy Lodge for the rest of his life. The organisation still commemorates him in their publications. He retired at age 51 in 1933 as a rear-admiral, but when the Second World War broke out, Robinson immediately offered his services and for three years, commanded convoys across the Atlantic Ocean. A bout of ill-health led to his retirement in September 1941. &lt;br&gt;
While awaiting a new posting he learned of the death of his son, Midshipman Edward Cordeaux Robinson, in the sinking of the cruiser HMS &quot;Neptune&quot; in December 1941, 
From June 1942 to November 1944 he served as Naval Officer in Charge at Dundee. For this service, he was later presented with the Norwegian King Haakon VII&#x27;s Freedom Cross, the Légion d&#x27;honneur and the Croix de Guerre.

==Retirement and death==
Robinson settled in the village of Langrish, near Petersfield in east Hampshire. He died peacefully at Haslar Naval Hospital, Gosport, on 20 August 1965 and was laid to rest at St John&#x27;s, the village church he had served for 20 years as warden. For unknown reasons, his grave was without a headstone until 1998, although a large plaque to him was dedicated by his sister in 1969 and surmounts the altar. Following investigations by the Naval VC Association, his grave was discovered and a Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstone erected. At the dedication ceremony, attended by over 150 friends, relatives, Masons and servicemen, Admiral Derek Reffell gave the eulogy which stated: &quot;The admiral was a hero, but more importantly he was a naval man from the finest mould. Now at last we can accord him the dignity he deserves.&quot;

==Citations==

==Commemoration==

On 26 February 2015, one hundred years after his VC-winning deed, a commemorative paving stone was laid outside Robinson&#x27;s former home at 1 Diamond Terrace, Greenwich. At the event Commander Operations, Rear Admiral Matthew Parr said he was in awe of Lt Cdr Robinson&#x27;s &quot;selfless actions&quot; and added: &quot;His courage, determination and fortitude in the face of overwhelming enemy action remain an example to us all; this commemorative stone will serve as a permanent memorial to a remarkable man.&quot;

<text>James Peter Robertson (26 October 1883 – 6 November 1917) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for valour in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Born in Albion Mines (now called Stellarton), Pictou County, Nova Scotia, &quot;Pete&quot;, as he was known, lived most of his life in Medicine Hat with his mother.

Robertson enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force in June 1915. He became a private in the 27th (City of Winnipeg) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force. Robertson was 34 years old, during the Second Battle of Passchendaele when he performed the following deed for which he was awarded the VC.

&quot;For most conspicuous bravery and outstanding devotion to duty in attack. When his platoon was held up by uncut wire and a machine gun causing many casualties, Pte. Robertson dashed to an opening on the flank, rushed the machine gun and, after a desperate struggle with the crew, killed four and then turned the gun on the remainder, who, overcome by the fierceness of his onslaught, were running towards their own lines. His gallant work enabled the platoon to advance. He inflicted many more casualties among the enemy, and then carrying the captured machine gun, he led his platoon to the final objective. He there selected an excellent position and got the gun into action, firing on the retreating enemy who by this time were quite demoralised by the fire brought to bear on them.

During the consolidation Pte. Robertson’s most determined use of the machine gun kept down the fire of the enemy snipers; his courage and his coolness cheered his comrades and inspired them to the finest efforts.

Later, when two of our snipers were badly wounded in front of our trench, he went out and carried one of them in under very severe fire.

He was killed just as he returned with the second man.&quot; (London Gazette, no.30471, 11 January 1918) 

==Further information==
Robertson is buried at Tyne Cot Cemetery, Passchendaele, Belgium, located 5 miles north east of Ypres. (Plot LVIII. Row D. Grave 26).

==The medal==
His medal is now located in the Canadian War Museum.

==Legacy==
On 10 February 2011, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans announced that the nine new vessels in a new class of midshore patrol vessels would be named Hero-class patrol vessels.
One of the new vessels will be named the CCGS &quot;Private Robertson V.C.&quot;.
Robertson Lake near Wood Buffalo National Park is named after him.

A CPR station in Calgary was named Robertson Railway Station when established around 1917. It no longer exists.

<doc id="1222209" wikidata="Q3567454" url="?curid=1222209" title="West of Scotland F.C.">
<text>West of Scotland Football Club is a rugby union club based in Milngavie, Scotland. Founded in 1865, West of Scotland are one of the oldest rugby clubs in the world, and one of the founding members of the Scottish Rugby Union. West have enjoyed a long and successful history, winning numerous Scottish Championships and producing an incredible number of international players, and a strong contingent of British and Irish Lions.

During the 1960s and 1970s, West were a true powerhouse of British rugby – regularly fielding up to ten internationals. Indeed, West famously developed a pack featuring Gordon Brown, Peter Brown, Sandy Carmichael (2 Lions and the Scotland Captain), all of whom are considered amongst the best rugby players ever produced by Scotland.

In the &#x27;Open Era&#x27; of professionalism, West have produced a significant number of players who have progressed to the professional and international levels. The most notable of these luminaries is Gordon Bulloch, who enjoyed sparkling professional career with playing Glasgow and Leeds, captaining Scotland, and playing for the British and Irish Lions, before &quot;reportedly&quot; rejecting a contract offer from the famous French Champions Stade Toulousain to make a triumphant return to the even-more-famous &#x27;Red and Yellow&#x27;.

A number of other professional players – such as Rob Harley – have emanated from West before going on to higher honours; and a number of current international players pulled on the red and yellow jersey having played for the club through the SRU&#x27;s Pro-player draft.

== Early history (1865–1960) ==

=== Formation ===
Formed in 1865, West of Scotland played a founding role in establishing international rugby in Scotland, and have provided a number of SRU presidents and players. The club originated at Hamilton Crescent in Partick, Glasgow as an offshoot of the Cricket Club. The bye laws of West of Scotland Football Club were agreed on 15 October 1865.

=== First Match ===
Initially, West games were 20-a-side intra-club affairs. However, In November 1867, West took to the field against live opposition for the first time – beating Edinburgh Academicals, in one of the first ever rugby matches ever played. West lost the return game at Raeburn Place in December 1867. This remains one of the oldest fixtures in world rugby, and the sides have clashed regularly over the years.

=== Club colours ===
West have played in red and yellow coloured strips since 1871, having elected to discard their old navy strips. The local football club Partick Thistle decided to copy in the 1930s when they also switched from dark blue strips.

=== Founding of the Scottish Rugby Union ===

In 1872 the formation of the Scottish Rugby Union took place at a meeting at Glasgow Academy on Elmbank Street, and the first members were Edinburgh Academicals, West of Scotland, Royal High School FP, Glasgow Academicals, Merchistonians, Glasgow University, St Andrews University and Edinburgh University.

=== Experiment with association football ===

In April 1873, eleven members of the club - using the name Glasgow Wanderers - played Queen&#x27;s Park F.C. under association football laws, at the original Hampden Park. Although the Wanderers only lost 1–0, their defensive play being particularly praised, and over 1,000 spectators attended, the experiment was not repeated.

=== Early Success ===
West twice won the Scottish Unofficial Championship in 1883 and 1885, and provided several players – including captains – to the National side. The club also won four consecutive Scottish Unofficial Championship titles in 1899, 1890, 1891, 1892 (joint), before once more taking the trophy in 1895.

However, despite this outstanding on-field success, the club experienced some off-field strife at this time; largely pertaining the West of Scotland cricket club&#x27;s incessant demands for more money.

The first world war (1914–18) not only curtailed the club&#x27;s playing activities – they also decimated many of the local club sides, many of whom never recovered. Nonetheless, despite further issues with the cricket club over the lease, West thrived during this era, fielding up to 4XV&#x27;s, and featuring many players who play at district and international level.

In 1929 one of rugby&#x27;s great personalities, W. H. Kidston died. He was responsible, with others for introducing the kicking code to Scotland, in his early days had played for West and, was Honorary Secretary for 18 years, and the first President of West of Scotland FC. Kidston went on to become the President of the SRU. These years also saw people like Bill Nicholson, W. A. Burnet, H. Stewart Mackintosh (later Director of Education for Glasgow ) and Arthur Ferns becoming involved both in playing terms and later in the transfer of West to Burnbrae. Although the club had limited success on the playing field at this time it had a large membership.

=== West&#x27;s Odyssey ===
At the outset of the World War Two (1939–1945), after years of simmering tension, the cricket club cancelled West&#x27;s lease in Partick – stating that they saw no avenue for the rugby club&#x27;s return post WWII. It would be 15 years before West found a new permanent home, and this period therefore represented somewhat of an odyssey for the club.

West&#x27;s first attempted solution was a ground and team-share with Kelvinside Academy FP at Balgray. This was successful for a number of years, but the sheer volume of players rendered it untenable. Therefore, in 1951, West once more began looking for a new home – with club officials A.D. Ferns, M.D. Ballantyne, H.S Mackintosh, W Nicholson, J.A.D. Thom, W.A. Burnet and President Hugh Harper all playing critical roles. The committee considered grounds in Bishopbriggs, Kirkintilloch, Pollok Estate, Stepps, and Whitecraigs, none of which were deemed desirable.

In this period West played their games at a variety of grounds over this period; namely at Old and New Anniesland, Balgray, Glasgow University, and St Aloysius College. Nonetheless, the club continue to thrive – often putting out 6 XV&#x27;s,

== Later history (1960–present) ==

In 1952 after some 15 years in the wilderness, West purchased the now hallowed ground at Burnbrae in Milngavie – though it would take a further 8 years, and significant effort and expenditure before the first game was played at Burnbrae. The first game was played against local rivals Glasgow High School FP.

=== Golden Era (1960s and 1970s) ===

West were an &#x27;open club&#x27;, meaning that in contrast to the restricted approach of the School&#x27;s FP clubs, they were open to all players, regardless of background.

This approach means that during the 1960s and 1970s some of the best players in the world graced the Burnbrae turf. West teams in this era featured many Scottish internationals, some of whom went on to star for the British and Irish Lions. Notable players from this era include Sandy Carmichael, Gordon Brown, Peter Brown, and Alastair McHarg, all of whom are considered to be amongst Scotland&#x27;s best ever players; whilst Lionel Weston was capped for England. West teams were littered with international players in all positions at this time, and not withstanding the outstanding pack noted above, Burnbrae crowds were dazzled by outstanding international backs such as David Sheddon, Chris Rea, and Quintin Dunlop, as well as England&#x27;s scrum-half Lionel Weston.

During this golden era the club enjoyed much on-field success, jointly-shared Championship honours with Hawick in 1965, before once more lifting the trophy in 1971.

=== Decline ===
However, this wasn&#x27;t to last, and West&#x27;s fortunes somewhat decline when the FP teams opened their clubhouses to non FP&#x27;s. Indeed. when the official SRU leagues were established however West were in Division 1, fell back to Division 2, before collapsing eventually to Division 3.

=== Rejection of Hawks Amalgamation ===

In the 1990s, faced with the Border and Edinburgh teams&#x27; domination of Scottish rugby, the great old clubs of Glasgow met to discuss amalgamating so as to compete at a higher level. This led to the origination of Glasgow Hawks, an amalgamation of the Glasgow Academy, High School of Glasgow, and Kelvinside FP clubs (the latter two already having merged into GHK) – each of whom &#x27;donated&#x27; letters to the Hawks acronym. The &#x27;W&#x27; in Hawks is therefore a vestige of West&#x27;s potential involvement – although the club decided to reject the move, thus maintaining its independence and history.

=== Resurgence and Return to Premiership ===

West&#x27;s fortunes showed signs of revival when they won the Scottish Shield in 2006. This led to an old-field resurgence for the club, who enjoyed successive promotions from Premiership Division Three, and then Premiership Division Two.

Indeed, it was on Saturday 29 March 2008 that West won Premiership Division Two, thus securing their promotion to Premiership Division One as champions. The 2nd XV and 3rd XV teams also won their leagues, making 2007–08 a historic season for the club.

West of Scotland played in Premiership Division One in 2008–2009, 2009–2010, and 2010–2011. This marked a strong era for the club, with former players such as British and Irish Lion Gordon Bulloch electing to return to club, alongside brother Alan Bulloch, Rory Kerr, and former Glasgow professional Guy Perrett These &#x27;stars&#x27; were augmented by a strong crop of West players including Robert Harley, Robert McAlpine, Murray McConell, all of whom progressed to professional rugby, as well as a selection of young Glasgow professional players, selected in the SRU draft (including Peter Horne, Jon Welsh, Richie Vernon, and Richie Gray).

West played in Premiership Division Two in season 2011–12 following relegation at the end of the 2010–11 season.

=== Facility Upgrade ===
In August 2014, work started on a new Waitrose supermarket, on land purchased from the club. West of Scotland received a new state of the art artificial all-weather pitch from this deal.
 The supermarket was opened in June 2015, with the new pitch being completed and opened soon after.

== 150th Anniversary Season (2015) ==
In 2015, West celebrated the 150th year of their existence with a stellar season, which saw all three senior men&#x27;s teams gain promotion. The First XV, captained by rotund flanker Jamie McAuley, gained promotion to National 2, the third highest league in Scotland.

A West team – augmented by players from the SRU&#x27;s other founding clubs – also played in an invitational game against fierce local rivals Glasgow Academicals, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of both clubs. The match ended in victory for West in the First XV match, which was precursed by a &#x27;golden oldies&#x27; game between FP&#x27;s of both teams – including British and Irish Lion John Beattie – in which Accies were triumphant.

== Current Teams and Leagues ==

West of Scotland&#x27;s Men&#x27;s First XV currently play in ; the Women&#x27;s XV play in the .

The Second XV play in the BT National Reserve League Division 2 – and the 2A XV play in BT West Reserve League Division 1.

The club also have an occasional &#x27;golden oldies&#x27; team, known as the Burnbrae Bulls.

=== Youth Section ===
West&#x27;s youth section was founded in the 1980s, and is now a thriving development centre with over 200 players – and an excellent track record of success, both on and off the field. The club&#x27;s youth development programme&#x27;s ethos is to &#x27;look at the individuals and develop the person, not just the player&#x27;. Notable recent graduates of West&#x27;s youth programme include: Rob Harley (Glasgow Warriors and Scotland), Robert McAlpine (Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby), and Murray McConell (Glasgow Warriors and Nottingham Rugby).

West&#x27;s midi sides (S1 – Under 18) play in the &#x27;Presidents Conference&#x27;, the top division in Scottish Youth Rugby. West&#x27;s youth set up is therefore extremely well regarded, and West&#x27;s youth team&#x27;s have regularly competed for (and won) silverware, including the Scottish Cup on several occasions.

==West of Scotland Sevens==
The club run the West of Scotland Sevens tournament. The West of Scotland side hold the trophy, after their &#x27;A&#x27; side won the trophy in 2022.

== Distinguished Players ==
Alexander Robertson, who played in the first ever international, 1871 was the first West of Scotland international cap. Between 1871 and 1914, the club provided over 42 players to the national side. Since then, many other players who have pulled on the famous red and yellow jersey have gone on to represent Scotland, with a number reaching the pinnacle as British and Irish Lions.

<text>The Whangaparāoa Peninsula is a suburban area about 30–50 km north of Auckland, New Zealand. It had residents in It stretches from Red Beach, where it connects to Kingsway, Orewa and Silverdale, and extends to Army Bay in the Hauraki Gulf. It is part of the Hibiscus Coast. The area is populated by residents who work on the peninsula, or commute from the area to other parts of the Hibiscus Coast, the North Shore, Rodney district, Auckland CBD and beyond for work. They travel by vehicle, or via the Gulf Harbour ferry at Gulf Harbour Marina, or the Hibiscus Coast Bus Station at Silverdale. There is one main road (Whangaparāoa Road) along its entire length, which is accessible from State Highway 1 via Hibiscus Coast Highway at Silverdale, or from Hibiscus Coast Highway at Orewa via Red Beach. It is popular as a tourist destination for catching a ferry to Tiritiri Matangi Island, and for visiting Shakespear Regional Park. It has one open (Whangaparāoa Golf Club) and one closed (as of 20 July 2023) (closed ) golf club (Gulf Harbour Country Club), beaches, sporting and recreation facilities, a library, shops, businesses and public and private primary and secondary schools. The median age of the population is in the 30s-40s.

==History==

The Kawerau hapū Ngāti Kahu traditionally inhabited the peninsula, prior to the arrival of Europeans. Ngāti Kahu&#x27;s major focuses of settlement were around Te Haruhi Bay and Army Bay. A waka portage existed between Tindalls Beach and Matakatia, allowing travellers to bypass the Whangaparāoa Peninsula, who otherwise would have needed to travel around the entire peninsula.

Whangaparāoa Peninsula was purchased by the government in 1853, after which settlers began developing the land for grazing. Ngāti Kahu continued to live on the land until the 1890s. The Shakespear family acquired many of the landholdings, and farmed the area until 1967, when they sold their land to the Auckland Regional Council, who established the Shakespear Regional Park at the far end of the peninsula.

==Geography==
The peninsula is in the northern North Island, close to the base of the North Auckland Peninsula. The Māori language name means &quot;Bay of Whales&quot;, and pods of orca and dolphin are regularly spotted in the waters off the peninsula. The peninsula is mostly urbanised and is in the Northern Auckland Zone of the Auckland urban area, as defined by Statistics New Zealand. Since 2010, it has been part of the Albany Ward and the Hibiscus and Bays Local Board of the Auckland Region. It is part of the General Electorate of Whangaparāoa.

A quickly growing area with new subdivisions being built, it is to be connected to State Highway 1 via a tolled bridge known as Penlink.

Auckland&#x27;s Northern Motorway (State Highway One) was extended to Orewa at the end of the 1990s, reducing journey time into the city and making it more popular for commuters. The under construction Penlink road (including a bridge over the Weiti River from Stanmore Bay to Stillwater) will provide a quicker route between the peninsula and central Auckland.

The peninsula stretches east for 11 kilometres into the Hauraki Gulf, to the north of East Coast Bays. Tiritiri Matangi Island is three kilometres off its eastern tip.

Communities include Red Beach, Stanmore Bay, Manly, Tindalls Beach, Army Bay, Gulf Harbour, Matakatia, and Arkles Bay. At the end of the peninsula is Shakespear Regional Park.

The New Zealand Defence Force owns part of this area. The base has been used as a resettlement camp for refugees, such as in 2001 when 130 refugees lived there. In 2020 it was being used to quarantine New Zealanders who left Wuhan, China during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="1222229" wikidata="Q7839060" url="?curid=1222229" title="Trevor Benjamin">
<text>Trevor Junior Benjamin (born 8 February 1979) is a former professional footballer and manager who played as a forward.

He is famed for being a prime example of a journeyman footballer, having represented 29 teams in his career, and making over 350 appearances in the Football League between 1995 and 2008. He also holds the record for the most league clubs played for, which is 16. He most notably spent time in the Premier League with Leicester City, who he joined in 2000 from Cambridge United. He was capped by England U21 but went on to feature for Jamaica as a full international, where he earned two caps. Benjamin has also played as a professional in the Football League for Crystal Palace, Norwich City, West Bromwich Albion, Gillingham, Rushden &amp; Diamonds, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, Northampton Town, Coventry City, Peterborough United, Watford, Swindon Town, Boston United, Walsall and Hereford United.

At the age of 28, Benjamin dropped out of the professional game and firstly signed for Conference North side Gainsborough Trinity. He went on to play for Northwich Victoria, Hednesford Town, Wellingborough Town, Kidsgrove Athletic, Tamworth, Harrogate Town and Woking. In 2010, he briefly joined Australian semi-pro side Sunshine George Cross, but failed to make an appearance and returned to the English Non-league game where he went on to feature for Bedlington Terriers, Wroxham and Morpeth Town. Having initially been on loan at Morpeth from Bedlington, he was later appointed player-manager of the club in November 2010 and managed the club until the end of the 2010–11 season.

==Playing career==

===Cambridge United===
Benjamin grew up in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, supporting Arsenal with Ian Wright as his idol. His first club was Wellingborough Colts where he excelled as a striker, gaining representative honours with Northamptonshire. His potential was recognised and he played a friendly for Kettering Town, with his brother Richard. Trevor played in their youth team then started scoring regularly for the reserves.

He then signed as a trainee for Cambridge United where he made his professional début as a 16-year-old, against Gillingham in a 0–0 draw, during his time there he scored 46 goals in 146 appearances. He also scored both goals (one in the first leg and one in the second leg) as Third Division Cambridge knocked Premier League Sheffield Wednesday out of the League Cup 2–1 on aggregate in September 1998. He also scored as Cambridge knocked second tier Crystal Palace out of the FA Cup in December 1999.

===Leicester City===

Following some impressive displays for Cambridge United, Benjamin signed for Leicester City (where his work rate and goal celebrations saw him become something of a cult figure). He was signed for a fee of £1.3 million by manager Peter Taylor, who snapped up Benjamin as a replacement for the departed Emile Heskey who had joined Liverpool.

He made his debut for Leicester City, as a substitute, in a 0–0 draw with Sunderland, on 1 October 2000. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3–0 win at Middlesbrough on 18 November 2000, however this proved to be his only goal that season.

Benjamin then went on loan to three clubs in the 2001–02 season. His first loan spell was at Crystal Palace, where he scored once against Bradford City in six league appearances. He then joined Norwich City making six appearances again before joining West Bromwich Albion, where he scored on his debut against Barnsley and helped them get promoted to the Premier League. Benjamin spent the whole of the 2002–03 season back at Leicester. His next loan spell was at Gillingham in September 2003, where he scored on his debut against West Ham United. In November 2003 he was loaned out to Rushden &amp; Diamonds, scoring once against Port Vale. His next loan was at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in January 2004. At Brighton he scored five goals in ten league appearances and manager Mark McGhee was keen to extend his loan to the end of the season. However he returned to his parent club in March 2004 and Brighton were promoted in his absence. In January 2005 new Leicester City manager Craig Levein made the decision to cancel Benjamin&#x27;s contract.

===Northampton Town and Coventry City===
Benjamin joined Northampton Town permanently on 19 January 2005, after a few weeks on loan to the club. Trevor was later signed up by Coventry manager Micky Adams (under whom he had played at Leicester) until the end of the season, scoring once against Watford.

===Peterborough United and Hereford United===
In the summer of 2005 Benjamin was released again and later signed for Peterborough United on a three-year deal, stating his main motivation was to gain first team football. Benjamin later made loan appearances for Watford, Swindon Town, Boston United and Walsall. Benjamin went on to sign for Hereford United on 1 August 2007. He made his début for the club in a 0–0 draw against Rotherham United on 11 August 2007. His first goal followed a week later, from the penalty spot, in a 2–1 win away at Barnet. He continued his impressive form in the first half of the season and became something of a fans favourite at Edgar Street, scoring his share of goals. However he did not start another match for the Bulls after the defeat to Cardiff at the end of January, which coincided with the arrival of Gary Hooper on loan.

===Non-league===
On 19 May 2008, Benjamin was released from Hereford United, being told his services will not be needed in the following season, despite being the club&#x27;s third top goalscorer that season. He joined Conference North club Gainsborough Trinity on non-contract terms in August 2008, a week later after joining Gainsborough Trinity, the Lincolnshire Echo revealed the player had also been training with Cheltenham Town. Despite this Trevor was released by a &#x27;disappointed&#x27; Steve Charles after just three appearances for Gainsborough Trinity, with the Blues noting that the Jamaican International had under performed in his games.

Benjamin had trials with Cheltenham Town, Gillingham and AFC Bournemouth at the start of the 2008–09 season, but failed to earn a contract at any of the three clubs. Bournemouth manager Jimmy Quinn said of the player, &quot;He&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m looking for, he&#x27;s probably past his sell-by date.&quot; On 10 October 2008, Benjamin signed for Northwich Victoria, but was released three weeks later as part of cost-cutting measures. He then made one appearance at Hednesford Town in the Northern Premier League Premier Division, after a few games for the club he was released. A couple of weeks later, Benjamin moved further down the non-league ladder to sign for his home town club Wellingborough Town in the United Counties Football League. He scored on his debut in the 2–2 Boxing Day draw with Raunds Town.
Recent speculations have linked him, like in the summer of 2008, to Chester City.

However, Benjamin moved on to Kidsgrove Athletic in the Northern Premier League Division One South, making his debut in a 5–2 win against Brigg Town on 14 February 2009.
He made 12 league appearances during the 2008–09 season, and another two appearances in the Staffordshire Senior Cup, helping them win the final on 22 April 2009. But Benjamin has recently stated that he would like a return to league football after fully recovering from his eye infection. He is currently on trial with Rushden &amp; Diamonds in a bid to earn a contract for the new season. On 7 August 2009, Trevor Benjamin signed for Conference National newcomers Tamworth, following a successful trial period with the club.

He made his debut the following day in a Conference National away fixture against Stevenage Borough, Benjamin came on as a 79th-minute substitute for midfielder Tom Shaw. The game finished in a 1–1 draw. He moved on to Harrogate Town in the Conference North, making his debut and scoring two goals in a 3–2 loss against Northwich Victoria on 3 October 2009.
In his second appearance, against Droylsden, he scored again with a stunning free-kick in the last few minutes of the game. He departed in November after his rolling month-to-month contract was not renewed.

He made his debut for Woking in a 6–0 win against St Albans City in the FA Trophy competition, on 21 November 2009.
After another two games for the Cards, he was released prior to 5 December 2009 match against Bishop&#x27;s Stortford. He joined Bedlington Terriers in Northern League Division One on a free transfer in February 2010. The next month he joined Wroxham in Eastern Counties League Premier Division for a short loan spell.

In September 2010 he was loaned out again, to Terrier&#x27;s local rivals Morpeth Town. After two goalless appearances, the 3–0 home defeat by Marske United and the 2–1 away defeat by Newton Aycliffe, he was appointed the club&#x27;s player-manager following the departure of previous manager Tom Wade. Shortly after his release he signed for Seaton Delaval Amateurs.

==International career==
Benjamin was selected for the England under-21s, making his only appearance as a substitute against Mexico at Filbert Street on 24 May 2001.

He made his international début for Jamaica on 20 November 2002 against Nigeria, in Lagos.

==Personal life==
After retiring from competitive football Benjamin has launched his own brand of goalkeeping gloves called Locust UK.

<text>Epiglottitis is the inflammation of the epiglottis—the flap at the base of the tongue that prevents food entering the trachea (windpipe). Symptoms are usually rapid in onset and include trouble swallowing which can result in drooling, changes to the voice, fever, and an increased breathing rate. As the epiglottis is in the upper airway, swelling can interfere with breathing. People may lean forward in an effort to open the airway. As the condition worsens, stridor and bluish skin may occur.
Epiglottitis was historically mostly caused by infection by &quot;H. influenzae type b&quot; (commonly referred to as &quot;Hib&quot;). With vaccination, it is now more often caused by other bacteria, most commonly &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, or &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. Predisposing factors include burns and trauma to the area. The most accurate way to make the diagnosis is to look directly at the epiglottis. X-rays of the neck from the side may show a &quot;thumbprint sign&quot; but the lack of this sign does not mean the condition is absent.
An effective vaccine, the Hib vaccine, has been available since the 1980s. The antibiotic rifampicin may also be used to prevent the disease among those who have been exposed to the disease and are at high risk. The most important part of treatment involves securing the airway, which is often done by endotracheal intubation. Intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone and possibly vancomycin or clindamycin is then given. Corticosteroids are also typically used. With appropriate treatment, the risk of death among children with the condition is about one percent and among adults is seven percent.
With the use of the Hib vaccine, the number of cases of epiglottitis has decreased by more than 95%. Historically, young children were mostly affected, but it is now more common among older children and adults. In the United States, it affects about 1.3 per 100,000 children a year. In adults, between 1 and 4 per 100,000 are affected a year. It occurs more commonly in the developing world. In children the risk of death is about 6%; however, if they are intubated early, it is less than 1%.

==Signs and symptoms==
Epiglottitis is associated with fever, throat pain, difficulty in swallowing, drooling, hoarseness of voice, and stridor. Onset is typically over a day. The throat itself may appear normal.

Stridor is a sign of upper airway obstruction and is a surgical emergency. The child often appears acutely ill, anxious, and will have very quiet shallow breathing often keeping the head held forward and insisting on sitting up in bed, commonly called the &quot;tripod position.&quot; The early symptoms are usually insidious but rapidly progressive, and swelling of the throat may lead to cyanosis and asphyxiation.

Adults commonly present with less dramatic breathing symptoms than children due to them having wider airways to begin with, so their main symptoms are usually a severe sore throat and difficulty swallowing. The back of the throat appears normal in 90% of adult patients, so epiglottitis should considered when there is pain out of proportion to exam or when pain is caused by pressing on the external windpipe. Adult epiglottitis is often referred to as supraglottitis. In contrast to children, the symptoms are non-specific, sub-acute and can be unpredictable. 

==Causes==
Epiglottitis is primarily caused by an acquired bacterial infection of the epiglottis. Historically it was most often caused by &quot;Haemophilus influenzae type B&quot;, but with the availability of immunization this is no longer the case. &quot;H. influenzae type B&quot; contains a capsule which helps it avoid being destroyed by macrophages and also contains surface proteins that allow it to stick to the lining of the upper respiratory tract. Presently, the bacteria most often causing infection are other encapsulated organisms including &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. These bacteria spread in respiratory droplets or aerosols produced from coughing and sneezing. While the overall incidence of epiglottitis has decreased, the incidence of cases caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae has increased in adults. The exact strains of &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; are often those that are covered by the PPV-23 vaccine, but there is no evidence that this vaccine prevents epiglottitis.

There have been many cases of epiglottitis reported in immunocompromised patients, including those undergoing cancer treatment and those who are HIV positive. While a variety of different bacteria can cause disease in these patients, cases often involve the &quot;Candida&quot; species of fungus, though it is unknown if the fungus causes significant disease on its own.

Alternate risk factors and causes associated with infection include burns and other trauma to the area. Medical research has also identified a link between epiglottitis and crack cocaine usage. Underlying disorders of the immune system, such as graft-versus-host disease and lymphoproliferative disorders, have also been identified as contributors of increased risk for developing the infection .

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis may be confirmed by direct inspection using a laryngoscope, although this may provoke airway spasm. If epiglottitis is suspected, attempts to visualize the epiglottis using a tongue depressor are discouraged for this reason; therefore, diagnosis is made on basis of indirect fiberoptic laryngoscopy carried out in a controlled environment like an operating room. An infected epiglottis appears swollen and is described as having a &quot;cherry-red&quot; appearance. Imaging is rarely useful, and treatment should not be delayed for this test to be carried out.

===Imaging===
On lateral C-spine X-ray, the thumbprint sign describes a swollen, enlarged epiglottis. A normal X-ray, however, does not exclude the diagnosis. An ultrasound may be helpful if specific changes are present, but its use (as of 2018) is in the early stages of study.

On CT imaging, the &quot;Halloween sign&quot; describes an epiglottis of normal thickness. It can safely exclude the acute epiglottitis. Furthermore, CT imaging can help to diagnose other conditions such as peritonsillar abscess or retropharyngeal abscess which have similar clinical features.

=== Necrotizing Epiglottitis ===
If there is visual or radiologic evidence that the infection has caused tissue destruction, the disease is called &quot;necrotizing epiglottitis&quot; (NE). The feared complication of NE is the bacteria spreading to the surrounding neck muscles and causing cervical necrotizing fasciitis which is a surgical emergency.

=== Differential Diagnosis ===
The differential diagnosis includes other infectious causes of acute airway obstruction, as well as acute or subacute mechanical causes. It includes, but is not limited to, the conditions below.
* Retropharyngeal abscess
* Peritonsillar abscess
* Croup
* Infectious mononucleosis
* Diphtheria
* Pertussis
* Bacterial tracheitis
* Ludwig&#x27;s angina
* Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
* Foreign body obstruction
* Obstructing tumor
* Allergic reaction, including angioedema
* Inhalation injury
* Laryngospasm
* Congenital structural defects in pediatric patients, including laryngomalacia

==Prevention==
An effective vaccine, the Hib vaccine, has been available since the 1980s. Modern Hib vaccines are mainly conjugate vaccines, with the key component being the polysaccharide found in the bacteria&#x27;s capsule which is its primary virulence factor. Currently, the CDC recommends that children receive a two or three-dose primary series with an additional booster dose. The countries of the world who have included the Hib vaccine in their immunization schedules typically begin the series at the age of two or three months with subsequent doses administered at four or eight week intervals. Routine vaccination in these nations has led to a dramatic decrease in the incidence of invasive diseases caused by &quot;H. influenzae type b&quot; such as epiglottitis, meningitis and pneumonia. It has been reported that epiglottitis cases have decreased by 95% since the 1980s following the introduction of the first Hib vaccine.

The antibiotic rifampicin may also be used to prevent the disease among those who have been exposed to the disease and are at high risk.

==Management==
The most important part of treatment involves securing the airway. Nebulized epinephrine may be useful to improve the situation temporarily. Corticosteroids are also typically used. However, there is poor evidence for whether steroids actually improve patient outcomes. Epiglottitis may require urgent tracheal intubation to protect the airway. Tracheal intubation can be difficult due to distorted anatomy and profuse secretions. Spontaneous respiration is ideally maintained until tracheal intubation is successful. A surgical airway opening (cricothyrotomy) may be required if intubation is not possible. The management of epiglottitis is different in adults compared to children. Emergent tracheal intubation with general anesthesia (inhalational induction to preserve spontaneous ventilation) in the operating theater is standard. However only 10% of adults require airway intervention, which means a selective approach is required. Tracheal intubation is a high risk scenario with a 1 in 25 failure rate in adults. Multiple airway management techniques have described for adults and include: awake tracheostomy, awake fibreoptic intubation, general anesthesia with spontaneous breathing preserved or ablated with paralysis. The optimal technique is controversial and likely determined by contextual factors such as the severity of epiglottitis and the clinical location (ie emergency department or intensive care or the operating room). Ideally airway intervention should occur in the operating room with an otolaryngology surgeon present to perform an emergency tracheostomy in the event of complete airway obstruction or failed intubation.

Intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone and possibly vancomycin or clindamycin are given once the airway is secure. A third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone is usually sufficient since it is usually effective against &quot;H. influenzae&quot; and &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot;. If &quot;S. aureus&quot; is suspected to be causing the disease, then the treatment should include ceftaroline or clindamycin as these would provide coverage against antibiotic resistant strains of that bacteria (MRSA). Vancomycin can also be considered for its MRSA coverage, but it may be less safe than ceftaroline in children older than two months. If the patient has a penicillin allergy, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, or levofloxacin may be appropriate choices.

Necrotizing epiglottitis is treated similarly to uncomplicated epiglottitis, but usually requires intubation in addition to standard IV antibiotic therapy. If the tissue damage continues to spread and necrotizing fasciitis of the neck is suspected, patients are taken to the operating room for emergency debridement.

==Prognosis==
With appropriate treatment, the risk of death among children with the condition is about one percent and among adults is seven percent. Elsewhere, it has been reported that only one percent of adults diagnosed with epiglottitis die from the disease. Some people may develop pneumonia, lymphadenopathy, or septic arthritis.

Between 1998 and 2006, there were an average of 36 deaths per year in the United States attributed to epiglottitis, giving a case-fatality rate of 0.89% during that time period.

Patients who recover from necrotizing epiglottitis often regain their ability to swallow foods and liquids despite the tissue damage.

==Epidemiology==
While, historically, young children were mostly affected, it is now more common among older children and adults. Before &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; (Hib) immunization children of two to four were most commonly affected. With immunization about 1.3 per 100,000 children are affected a year. It has been reported that only 0.5 per 100,000 American children are diagnosed every year, while the incidence in American adults is about 1 to 4 per 100,000. A 2010 retrospective study revealed the average age of patients admitted to American hospitals for epiglottitis was about 45, but patients under the age of 1 and over the age of 85 are also particularly vulnerable.

==Notable cases==

Bill Bixby&#x27;s 6-year-old son Christopher died of the condition in 1981.

Jeannie Mai spent some time in an ICU with epiglottitis.

Sarah Silverman spent a week in the ICU at Cedars Sinai Hospital with epiglottitis.

George Washington is thought to have died of epiglottitis. The treatments given to Washington, such as severe bloodletting, an enema, vinegar, sage, molasses, butter, blistering his throat with Spanish fly, requiring him to swallow mercurous chloride and antimony potassium tartrate, and applying wheat poultices to various parts of the body, are no longer used.

Jin of BTS announced in a 2022 video that he had been diagnosed with epiglottitis.

Wes Moore&#x27;s father died of epiglottitis when Moore was four years old.

<text>Jules Adolphe Aimé Louis Breton (; 1 May 1827 – 5 July 1906) was a 19th-century French naturalist painter. His paintings are heavily influenced by the French countryside and his absorption of traditional methods of painting helped make him one of the primary transmitters of the beauty and idyllic vision of rural existence.

== Early life and training ==
Breton was born on 1 May 1827 in Courrières, a small Pas-de-Calais village. His father, Marie-Louis Breton, supervised land for a wealthy landowner. His mother died when Jules was four and he was brought up by his father. Other family members who lived in the same house were his maternal grandmother, his younger brother, Émile, and his uncle Boniface Breton. A respect for tradition, a love of the land and for his native region remained central to his art throughout his life and provided the artist with many scenes for his Salon compositions.

His first artistic training was not far from Courrières at the College St. Bertin near Saint-Omer. He met the painter Félix De Vigne in 1842 who, impressed by his youthful talent, persuaded his family to let him study art. Breton left for Ghent in 1843 where he continued to study art at the Academy of Fine Arts with de Vigne and the painter Hendrik Van der Haert. In 1846, Breton moved to Antwerp where he took lessons with Egide Charles Gustave Wappers and spent some time copying the works of Flemish masters. In 1847, he left for Paris where he hoped to perfect his artistic training at the École des Beaux-Arts.

In Paris he studied in the atelier of the Michel Martin Drolling. He met and became friends with several of the Realist painters, including François Bonvin and Gustave Brion and his early entries at the Paris Salon reflected their influence. His first efforts were in historical subjects: &quot;Saint Piat preaching in Gaul&quot; then, under the influence of the revolution of 1848, he represented &quot;Misery and Despair&quot;. The Salon displayed his painting &quot;Misery and Despair&quot; in 1849 and &quot;Hunger&quot; in 1850–51. 
Both paintings have since been destroyed. After &quot;Hunger&quot; was successfully shown in Brussels and Ghent, Breton moved to Belgium where he met his future wife Elodie. Elodie was the daughter of his early teacher Félix de Vigne. In 1852, Breton returned to France. But he had discovered that he was not born to be a historical painter, and he returned to the memories of nature and of the country which were impressed on him in early youth. In 1853 he exhibited &quot;Return of the Reapers&quot;, the first of numerous rural peasant scenes influenced by the works of the Swiss painter Louis Léopold Robert. Breton&#x27;s interest in peasant imagery was well established from then on and what he is best known for today. In 1854, he returned to the village of Courrières where he settled. He began &quot;The Gleaners&quot;, a work inspired by seasonal field labor and the plight of the less fortunate who were left to gather what remained in the field after the harvest. &quot;The Gleaners&quot; received a third class medal, which launched Breton&#x27;s career. He received commissions from the State and many of his works were purchased by the French Art Administration and sent to provincial museums. His 1857 painting &quot;Blessing of the Wheat, Artois&quot; was exhibited at the Salon the same year and won a second class medal.

Breton married Elodie de Vigne in 1858.

== Fame during his lifetime ==

He continued to exhibit throughout the 1870s and into the 1880s and 1890s and his reputation grew. His poetic renderings of single peasant female figures in a landscape, posed against the setting sun, remained very popular, especially in the United States. Since his works were so popular, Breton often produced copies of some of his images. He was extremely popular in his own time, exhibiting numerous compositions at the Salons that were widely available as engravings. He was one of the best known painters of his period in his native France as well as England and the United States.

In 1886, Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal, bid $45,000 at a New York auction for Breton&#x27;s work &quot;The Communicants&quot; (1884). At that time, the price was the second highest price paid for a painting by a living artist. The painting changed hands again in 2016 and commanded $1.27 million. That figure is very close to the 1886 auction price after adjusting for inflation. Also in 1886, Breton was elected a member of the Institut de France on the death of Baudry.

In 1887 New York art dealer M. Knoedler ordered two paintings from Breton, commissioned Charles Albert Waltner to etch the grand Salon work the &quot;Recall of the Gleaners&quot; (1859) and then held a special exhibition of his works in 1888.

In 1889 Breton was made commander of the Legion of Honor, and in 1899 foreign member of the Royal Academy of London. His brother Emile, an architect by training, and his daughter Virginie were also painters.

He also wrote several books, and was a recognized writer who published a volume of poems (&quot;Jeanne&quot;) and several editions of prose relating his life as an artist and the lives of other artists that he personally knew; among them &quot;Les Champs et la mer&quot; (1876), &quot;Nos peintres du siècle&quot; (1900), &quot;Delphine Bernard&quot; (1902), and &quot;La Peinture&quot; (1904). Breton died in Paris on 5 July 1906.

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition 1911, Breton was essentially a painter of rustic life, especially in the province of Artois, which he quit only three times for short excursions: in 1864 to Provence, and in 1865 and 1873 to Brittany, whence he derived some of his happiest studies of religious scenes. His numerous subjects may be divided generally into four classes: labour, rest, rural festivals and religious festivals. Among his more important works, with their location as of 1911, may be named &quot;Women Gleaning,&quot; and &quot;The Day after St Sebastian&#x27;s Day&quot; (1855), which gained him a third-class medal; &quot;Blessing the Fields&quot; (1857), a second-class medal; &quot;Erecting a Calvary&quot; (1859), now in the Lille gallery; &quot;The Return of the Gleaners&quot; (1859), now in the Luxembourg; &quot;Evening&quot; and &quot;Women Weeding&quot; (1861), a first-class medal; &quot;Grandfather&#x27;s Birthday&quot; (1862); &quot;The Close of Day&quot; (1865); &quot;Harvest&quot; (1867); &quot;Potato Gatherers&quot; (1868); &quot;The Weeders&quot; (1868); &quot;A Pardon, Brittany&quot; (1869); &quot;The Fountain&quot; (1872), medal of honour; &quot;The Bonfires of St John&quot; (1875); &quot;Women mending Nets&quot; (1876), in the Douai museum; &quot;A Gleaner&quot; (1877), Luxembourg; &quot;Evening, Finistère&quot; (1881); &quot;The Song of the Lark&quot; (1884); &quot;The Last Sunbeam&quot; (1885); &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Star&quot; (1887); &quot;The Call Home&quot; (1889); &quot;The Last Gleanings&quot; (1895); &quot;Gathering Poppies&quot; (1897); &quot;The Alarm Cry&quot; (1899); &quot;Twilight Glory&quot; (1900).

== Posthumous fame ==
Arguably, Breton&#x27;s fame peaked posthumously in 1934 at The Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt unveiled &quot;The Song of the Lark&quot; as the winner of the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; contest to find the &quot;most beloved work of art in America&quot;. Further, she declared the painting as being her personal favorite painting. &quot;At this moment &quot;The Song of the Lark&quot; had come to represent the popular American artistic taste on a national level.&quot; Of course, since &quot;The Song of the Lark&quot; was recently given to the Art Institute of Chicago this particular work of Breton had an advantage over Breton works at other American museums. Breton, however, was not universally appreciated. The American art establishment of the 1930s considered works of Breton to be lowbrow and the director of the Art Institute of Chicago itself argued for the removal of the work from display. It was not until the later half of the twentieth century, that Breton&#x27;s social realism became more respectable again.

To a degree, one can argue that posthumously Breton&#x27;s fame fell victim to the success during his lifetime. His most detailed works either went straight into museums or were collected by the likes of Henry Clay Frick, Catharine Lorillard Wolfe, the Morgan family, Henry Huntington and the Field family. These were collectors of such great wealth that they tended to either donate their collections to their favorite local museum or founded their own museum such as the Huntington. Meanwhile, the exponential increase in printmaking in the 19th century flooded the market with inexpensive prints of Breton&#x27;s works. In 2019, dozens of these 19th century prints are available on websites like EBay beginning at under $10.

Breton&#x27;s change in fame can be contrasted with his contemporary the artist Vincent van Gogh. During their lifetimes, Breton was a celebrated and highly paid successful artist. He spent months creating some of his works. Whereas, in 1880 Vincent van Gogh was so poor he walked on foot 85 kilometers to Courrières to pay a visit to Breton, whom he greatly admired, but turned back, put off by Breton&#x27;s high wall. No great collectors flocked to purchase van Gogh&#x27;s works during his lifetime, he received no commissions to paint from New York City, no prints were made while he lived, and he died in poverty. However, at a 2015 auction van Gogh&#x27;s work &quot;Paysage Sous un ciel Mouvement&quot;, painted at a time he generated one work per day, commanded $54 million. Ironically, in a letter to his brother Theo, van Gogh mentions he viewed Breton&#x27;s painting &quot;The Song of the Lark&quot; and considered it to be &quot;fine&quot;.

== Prints and reproductions ==

In 1898 Knoedler published a catalog of their prints and listed 8 prints after Jules Breton including &quot;The Evening&quot; etched by Charles Waltner, 4 prints etched by Lionel Aristide Lecouteux, &quot;The Song of the Lark&quot; by Charles Louis Kratke, and &quot;Last Ray&quot; by Paul-Adolphe Rajon. Other publishers of his prints included Arthur Tooth &amp; Sons of London, Detroit Publishing Co, and Morris &amp; Bendien of New York. Other etchers include Charles Koepping and W. S. Lathrop and Leopold Joseph Flameng. Most prints tended to be rather small and unsigned. A few have survived to this day that were signed by both Jules Breton and the etcher. Works by Breton are still popular today and are being reproduced in &quot;giclée&quot; framed and unframed as well as everything from shopping bags to pillows and bed covers as well as tee-shirts and coffee mugs.

== Homages ==
In 1912, rue Jules Breton in the 13th arrondissement of Paris was given his name.

Willa Cather&#x27;s 1915 novel &quot;The Song of the Lark&quot; takes its name from Breton&#x27;s 1884 painting.

In February 2014, actor Bill Murray disclosed at a press event for the film &quot;The Monuments Men&quot;, that a chance encounter with Breton&#x27;s &quot;The Song of the Lark&quot; at the Art Institute of Chicago helped him at a low point in his early career.

<doc id="1222249" wikidata="Q353969" url="?curid=1222249" title="Frank Arnesen">
<text>Frank Arnesen (born 30 September 1956) is a former Danish footballer and sporting director at Dutch football club Feyenoord. Arnesen was the director of football at English football clubs Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea, and was sporting director at Hamburger SV, Metalist Kharkiv and PAOK.

As a player, he most notably played with Dutch clubs Ajax and PSV Eindhoven, winning the 1988 European Cup with PSV. Arnesen was capped 52 times and scored 14 goals for the Danish national team, and participated in the Euro 1984 and 1986 FIFA World Cup tournaments.

==Playing career==
Arnesen moved from his childhood club Fremad Amager, in the lower leagues of Danish football, to the big Dutch team Ajax in November/December 1975. At the time he was only 19, and made the move together with Fremad Amager teammate Søren Lerby, who was only 17. Arnesen got his debut with Ajax three or four months later, on 7 March 1976, in a 1–1 draw with Utrecht. It was also in his time at Ajax that Arnesen debuted for the Danish national team, in a 1977 friendly 1–0 loss against Sweden, in Malmö. In Arnesen&#x27;s six seasons at Ajax, he won three Dutch Eredivisie championship titles in 1977, 1979, and 1980, and won the KNVB Cup in 1979, beating Twente 3–0 in the final. In 1978, 1980 and 1981, Ajax also reached the KNVB Cup finals, but lost. In 1980, Arnesen and Ajax reached the semi-final of the European Cup, before they were eliminated by English team Nottingham Forest, the European Cup winners in the 1978-1979 and 1979–1980 seasons (2–0 away loss, 1–0 home win, 31 goals for and eight goals against in the 1979-80 tournament).

In the summer of 1981, Arnesen was bought by the Spanish football club Valencia, and two years later he went to Belgium to play for Anderlecht. In November 1985, Arnesen returned to the Netherlands to play for Ajax&#x27; rivals PSV Eindhoven. Here, he saw three extremely successful seasons, winning the Eredivisie three consecutive seasons (1986, 1987 and 1988), with fellow Danes Jan Heintze, Søren Lerby and Ivan Nielsen. Arnesen stopped his international career in 1987, after the Danish team qualified for the Euro 1988. In 1988, he won the KNVB Cup once more, and he was part of the PSV team that conquered the European Cup, though he did not play in the final match due to an injury.

==Management career==
After his active career, Arnesen was first appointed assistant coach at PSV under Bobby Robson from 1991 to 1993, and in 1994 he became the club&#x27;s general manager. Arnesen spent ten years as director of football at PSV Eindhoven, and was credited with discovering major talents, such as Brazilian striker Ronaldo and Dutch players Jaap Stam, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Arjen Robben. In May 2004, Arnesen was brought to Tottenham Hotspur, replacing David Pleat. Arnesen was to function as the manager responsible for player transfers and scouting for new talent, while coach Jacques Santini handled the daily training sessions and match setups - an arrangement identical to Arnesen&#x27;s days as PSV manager. Things didn&#x27;t work out well, and Santini left within months, citing &quot;personal problems&quot; as his reason for leaving. Arnesen&#x27;s original hire for assistant coach, Martin Jol, was put in charge of the club.

Arnesen was suspended by Spurs on 4 June 2005 for expressing a desire to move to rival club Chelsea, after Chelsea allegedly made an illegal approach to sign him as manager. Arnesen was photographed aboard one of Roman Abramovich&#x27;s three luxury yachts on 22 June 2005, thus reinforcing Tottenham&#x27;s compensation claim. Arnesen was recommended to Abramovich by Piet de Visser. Later on, one of the reasons to end José Mourinho&#x27;s contract would have been that Mourinho did not want to engage with Abramovich&#x27;s football consultants. On 24 June, both clubs announced that they had reached a financial settlement, later disclosed to be £5 million, but widely reported to be closer to £8 million, and Arnesen would move to Chelsea, filling in the role of head talent scout, in charge of discovering footballing talents. Arnesen has since played a key role in bringing Salomon Kalou, Florent Malouda and Mikel John Obi to Chelsea. But the club has still pursued expensive purchases of established international players, rather than unearthing and developing young talent as hoped. On 27 November 2010, Chelsea announced that Arnesen had resigned as sporting director, and would be leaving the club at the end of the 2010–11 season. On 20 February, he decided to join Hamburger SV for the foreseeable future as sporting director, instead of returning to Ajax.

As sporting director of Hamburg, Arnesen took Chelsea youngsters to Hamburg like Jacopo Sala, Michael Mancienne, Gökhan Töre, Slobodan Rajković (all permanent) and Jeffrey Bruma (on loan).
On 10 October 2011, Arnesen took over the additional task of the head coach of Hamburger SV for just one match, before hiring and installing a permanent new coach with Thorsten Fink.

On 22 May 2013, Hamburg confirmed that Arnesen had agreed to depart from his role as sporting director at the club. Arnesen was with the club for two years, including a spell as interim manager.

On 30 January 2014, Metalist Kharkiv announced that Arnesen will take over the role of sporting director from 1 February 2014. This position was only held for a month, as Arnesen and Metalist agreed that Arnesen could leave the club, due to the ongoing violent political situation in Ukraine.

Speaking on the official Metalist Kharkiv website, Arnesen said:

&quot;I want to thank everyone in &quot;Metalist&quot;. I got acquainted with all staff during this short period and realized that true professionals and very nice people work in the club. Also I would like to apologize to the fans, but the circumstances were stronger than me. The situation in Ukraine forced me to make this choice. I want to wish everyone at Metalist and throughout the Ukraine all the best in these difficult times&quot;. 
On 27 May 2015, PAOK announced that Arnesen would be the new sporting director of the club for the next three years. After nine months, it was announced that his contract was terminated.

<doc id="1222251" wikidata="Q1419068" url="?curid=1222251" title="Firhill Stadium">
<text>Firhill Stadium, also known as Wyre Stadium at Firhill for sponsorship reasons, is a football and former rugby union, rugby league and greyhound racing stadium located in the Maryhill area of Glasgow, Scotland which has been the home of Partick Thistle since 1909.

Past ground-sharing agreements have seen Firhill act as a temporary home for three other football clubs: Clyde, Hamilton Academical and Queen&#x27;s Park. It was also a venue for the 2000 Rugby League World Cup and the Glasgow Warriors rugby union team between 2007 and 2012. , the all-seated capacity of Firhill is .

==History==
Partick Thistle played at various sites between 1876 and 1891, including Kelvingrove, Jordanvale Park and Muir Park. The club settled at Meadowside, beside the River Clyde, in 1891. They were forced out of this site in 1908, however, to make way for a shipyard. The club found some spare Caledonian Railway land in Maryhill, the site was purchased by the club for £5,500, and construction started soon after. The ground was due to open on 21 August 1909, but the match was postponed because it had not been declared safe for public use and planning consent had not been obtained. Firhill opened a month later.
The record attendance for a Partick Thistle game at Firhill was set against Rangers in 1922, when 49,838 people attended. The present main stand was constructed in 1927, at which time the terraces were expanded. Although the main stand resembles an Archibald Leitch design, it was in fact designed by David Mills Duncan, who had previously worked for Leitch. The stadium&#x27;s attendance record was set by the 1928 British Home Championship match between Scotland and Ireland, when 54,728 people attended.
There were no further improvements until the early 1950s, when Thistle had a relatively successful period. This success financed a roof over part of the terracing and floodlights, which were first used in a friendly match against Tottenham Hotspur in November 1955. Firhill hosted the first European Cup match ever to be played in Glasgow, when Swedish club Djurgården played their &quot;home&quot; leg against Hibernian in the 1955–56 season in the city as a result of the freezing conditions in Sweden at the time of the match.

Firhill became designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act in 1977, which reduced its capacity from over 40,000 to 20,500. In 1986, Firhill became the first Scottish ground in modern times to be used by more than one team, when Clyde moved in after being evicted from Shawfield. This arrangement lasted until 1991. Hamilton Academical then shared Firhill with Thistle in two different spells, the first arrangement beginning in 1994. To cope with the resulting additional usage, undersoil heating was installed in 1994.

The North Stand was built in 2002 to meet the Scottish Premier League criteria on stadium capacity, which stated at the time that member clubs must have 10,000 seats in their ground. Ironically this criterion was later changed to only 6,000 seats, which not only allowed for the relegation of Partick Thistle, but meant they had constructed a stand which cost the club unnecessarily. Originally, the stand only ran for two-thirds the length of the pitch, but it was extended in 2003. The construction of this stand was assisted by the sale of some land to allow the construction of student flats which now lie behind the stand.

==Structure and facilities==
The modern stadium comprises three seated stands, with an unused area at the south end. The current capacity of the ground includes seats with no standing areas available. The Main Stand was built with an original capacity of 6,000 seats, however in recent times the capacity has been reduced. In January 2006, the club announced that the Main Stand would no longer be used on matchdays due to high maintenance and stewarding costs. There were exceptions to this, such as a Scottish Cup match against Rangers and for Glasgow Warriors matches against Edinburgh. When Thistle achieved promotion to the Scottish Premiership in 2013, the Main Stand was reopened to house away supporters, and is used by away fans of more than 500. The Main Stand was renamed the Colin Weir Stand in 2016 in tribute to the club&#x27;s first ever patron.
Home fans now occupy the stand opposite the old stand, the Jackie Husband Stand; the north end of this stand is also host to away fans numbering less than 500. The stand is a large cantilever building, and was constructed in December 1994 with a capacity of 6,263 and is named after former Thistle player Jackie Husband.

The newest stand is the John Lambie Stand, at the north end of the ground. This was built in 2002 to replace the old terracing, in order to comply with SPL standards. This has a capacity of 2,014, houses Thistle&#x27;s singing section and was named after former Thistle manager John Lambie in April 2018.

==Future developments==
In 2010, Thistle had announced plans to replace the disused terracing at the south end of the ground, commonly known as the &quot;City End&quot; with a new structure that would consist of a 1,000-seat stand as well as residential and office accommodation. However, planning permission from Glasgow City Council was not forthcoming. The grassy bank at the City End has come to be known by the fans as &quot;The Bing&quot;.

On 7 November 2014, it was announced that planning permission had been submitted to Glasgow City Council to redevelop the southern end of the stadium. On this site, a new 450-seater stand will be built, complete with 79 residential flats and also office and retail space. The proposals are identical to those issued to the council in July 2010. Tim Clark of ZM Architecture, the company handling the application, stated: &quot;The timescale for concluding the original consent has now ceased and our client wishes to resubmit the original application as they still have intentions to develop the site, which was interrupted by the downturn in the financial market in the intervening years.&quot;

==Other uses==

===Rugby Union===
In December 2005, Firhill became the home of Glasgow&#x27;s professional rugby union team, Glasgow Warriors, when they moved from their previous base at Hughenden Stadium. After returning to Hughenden in 2006, the Warriors took up a two-year residency at Firhill from the start of the 2007–08 Celtic League season. This was extended in April 2009 for a further five years. Glasgow Warriors left Firhill after the 2011–12 season and moved to Scotstoun Stadium.
===Rugby League===
In 1996, Firhill was the site of the Scottish national rugby league team&#x27;s first game on home soil, with a victory against Ireland. Rugby league, very much a minority sport in Scotland, has returned to the ground on several occasions since, including for the 2000 World Cup.

===Greyhound racing===

Greyhound Racing took place from 1928 until 1957. An oval greyhound circuit 400 yards in circumference was added to the stadium around the football pitch in 1928 and a totalisator board was erected above the second bend between terracing. The racing started on 23 April 1928 as an independent (unlicensed) track before the joining of the British Greyhound Tracks Control Society (BGTCS) in 1933.

Licensed racing started on Monday 23 January 1933 with a hastily arranged meeting; greyhounds had only qualifying to race on the previous Thursday, Friday and Saturday trial sessions. The company responsible for the greyhound racing was the Firhill Greyhound Racing Company Limited and their managing director was John Bilsland, the same man that formed part of syndicates responsible for opening Southend-on-Sea (Kursaal) and having interests in three Liverpool greyhound tracks. Racing took place at Firhill every Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday at 7.45pm with races held over 280 and 480 yards (mainly handicaps).

The extra revenue helped Partick Thistle overcome serious financial difficulties and when the BGTCS disbanded in 1935 the stadium management
headed by David Mitchell and W I Bilsland joined the National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) and continued to capitalise on a greyhound racing boom. By March 1950 falling attendances and competition from other Glasgow tracks forced Firhill to resign from their NGRC affiliation. The chairman John Bilsland stated that the cost of NGRC membership exceeded £1,000 per year. During January 1957 Racing Manager Ernest Ganly announced that the track was going to close to greyhound racing. He blamed falling attendances but the owner trainers disagreed citing the policy of only running company owned greyhounds at the track as being the main cause.

Track records
==Television==
In 1999, the stadium briefly featured in a Chewin&#x27; the Fat sketch.

Firhill was used heavily in 2000 as a location for the television series &quot;Taggart&quot; in the episode &quot;Football Crazy&quot;, in which the fictional team Strathclyde F.C. wore the same kits as Thistle and played at the ground. Scenes for the 2010 BBC television drama &quot;Single Father&quot;, starring Scottish actor David Tennant, were filmed at Firhill.

==Transport==

Maryhill railway station, which is served by trains from Glasgow Queen Street, is the closest railway station to Firhill. The walk between the two sites takes between 20 and 25 minutes. Firhill is better served by the Glasgow Subway, with Kelvinbridge and St George&#x27;s Cross stations within 15 minutes walk of the stadium. The A81 road (Maryhill Road), leading to Firhill Road, runs from the M8 motorway.

<text>Joel Meyerowitz (born March 6, 1938) is an American street, portrait and landscape photographer. He began photographing in color in 1962 and was an early advocate of the use of color during a time when there was significant resistance to the idea of color photography as serious art. In the early 1970s he taught photography at the Cooper Union in New York City.

His work is in the collections of the International Center of Photography, Museum of Modern Art, and New York Public Library, all in New York, and the Museum of Contemporary Photography in Chicago.

==Career==
In 1962, inspired by seeing Robert Frank at work, Meyerowitz quit his job as an art director at an advertising agency and took to the streets of New York City with a 35 mm camera and color film. As well as Frank, Meyerowitz was inspired by Henri Cartier-Bresson and Eugène Atget—he has said &quot;In the pantheon of greats there is Robert Frank and there is Atget.&quot;

After alternating between black and white and color, Meyerowitz &quot;permanently adopted color&quot; in 1972, well before John Szarkowski&#x27;s promotion in 1976 of color photography in an exhibition of work by the then little-known William Eggleston. Meyerowitz also switched at this time to large format, often using an 8×10 camera to produce photographs of places and people.

Meyerowitz appears extensively in the 2006 BBC Four documentary series &quot;The Genius of Photography&quot; and in the 2013 documentary film &quot;Finding Vivian Maier&quot;. In 2014 the documentary &quot;Sense of Time&quot; by German filmmaker Ralph Goertz was published.

He is the author of many books including &quot;Cape Light&quot;, considered a classic work of color photography. Meyerowitz photographed the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, and was the only photographer allowed unrestricted access to its Ground Zero immediately following the attack. This resulted in the book &quot;&quot; (2006), which Parr and Badger include in the third volume of their photobook history.

On January 18, 2017 Meyerowitz was honored for his lifelong work with a place at the &quot;Leica Hall of Fame&quot; and was described as a &quot;magician using colour&quot; and being able to &quot;both capture and framing the decisive moment&quot;.

==Personal life==
Meyerowitz was born in the Bronx, to working class Jewish immigrant parents from Hungary and Russia. He studied art, art history, and medical illustration at Ohio State University, graduating in 1959. He is married to English novelist Maggie Barrett. In addition to their home in New York City, they maintain a residence outside of Siena, Tuscany, Italy.

<text>The Gift is a Portuguese alternative rock band, formed in 1994. They have released eight albums to date. In 2005 they won the MTV Europe award for best Portuguese act.

==Biography==

Formed in 1994, The Gift was initially a side project of the Dead Souls, Nuno Gonçalves, El Guam and Miguel Ribeiro&#x27;s band at the time. The evolution from one project to another was natural, as they felt the Dead Souls sound was limited by their instrumentation (guitar, drums and bass) and wanted to experiment with new sounds and explore new musical paths.

In September, 1994, Sónia Tavares, Nuno and John Gonçalves, Miguel Ribeiro, and Ricardo Braga enrolled in the Bar Ben Music Competition in Alcobaça, and took second place in the competition, to everyone&#x27;s great surprise, given the band&#x27;s short time in existence.

The band performed its first show at the Alcobaça Monastery in July, 1995. This was followed by the Belém Cultural Centre (Lisbon) in September, 1996, and the Labirintho Bar (Porto) in November, 1996.

The Gift masterminded their first record, with the intention of using it as a demo for the media and labels. From this effort, &quot;Digital Atmosphere&quot; was born, a six track enhanced CD featuring interviews and videos, recorded at home but not available in stores. In 1997 the band went on the road, playing at over 30 theatres (many of which sold out) and released a video at the end of the tour at the Belém Cultural Centre and Alcobaça Cine-Teatro shows.

Soon after the Digital Atmosphere Tour finished, Ricardo Braga left the band, and The Gift was now a four-member group once again. In 1998, they established themselves as an independent band forming their own label, La Folie, with the visionary goal of releasing their next record as independents.

In November 1998, the band&#x27;s first true record &quot;Vinyl&quot; was released. &quot;Vinyl&quot; combined the potentials of new technologies (samples and synthesizer) with classical instruments (violins, cellos, trumpets, saxophones, etc.). &quot;Vinyl&quot;, which was fully funded by The Gift themselves, was named Album of the Year by the Diário de Notícias newspaper, a first for a Portuguese independent band, and began courting the attention of the labels that previously ignored The Gift&#x27;s work. In spite of this, the band chose to stay independent, opting to use distribution contracts.

From November 1998 through 1999, the band performed over 80 shows, including the biggest Summer Festivals, selling out the most important venues in Lisbon and Porto, won several awards with the first hit single, &quot;Ok! Do You Want Something Simple?&quot; and sold over 35,000 records.

At the end of that year The Gift performed for the first time abroad in Paris (at La Cigalle), and a few months later participated in the prestigious music fair MIDEM 2000 (in Cannes), taking the first step towards the band&#x27;s career outside Portugal.

In early 2000, the band closed the &quot;Vinyl&quot; era, simultaneously releasing the photo book &quot;A Single Diary&quot; (by Ana Pereira), and the video &quot;Single Hand Camera Documentary&quot; (by Gonçalo Covacich), two artistic visions and documentary pieces on the Vinyl Tour. Once again, all the costs incurred were covered by the band, establishing The Gift once and for all as a solid DIY
band.

The steps taken abroad continued to gain momentum in June 2000 with the band&#x27;s first mini-tour outside Portugal, including dates in Germany (Expo 2000 – Hanover), Macau, and again, France (Paris).

At the end of the year The Gift took a break from touring and started writing songs for the next album, some of which were introduced later in 2001 at the Eurosonic Festival in the Netherlands, representing Portugal.

Howie B produced &quot;Film&quot;, The Gift&#x27;s second album, was released, again through their own label, La Folie Records. The band showed its &quot;Film&quot; throughout the country, playing at the Paredes de Coura Festival, the optimushype@meco Festival (sharing the stage with Howie B and Matthew Herbert), at the Interactive TV&#x27;s launch in Portugal, live for Sic Radical channel, and radio Antena 3.

&quot;Film&quot; went Gold at 25,000 units, and The Gift won several more awards for its videos (&quot;Waterskin&quot; and &quot;Question of Love&quot; – the album&#x27;s first two singles). At the end of 2001, the band was once more invited by Cap Magellan to promote &quot;Film&quot; in Paris.

In March 2002, The Gift flew to the United States to enter the South by Southwest Music &amp; Media Conference in Austin, Texas; in June they returned to Paris to perform at the Hôtel de Ville Square; in August Popkomm and Musikfest am Ring festivals in Germany; Spain followed in September with shows in Barcelona; in October the band was back in the US for a short tour in a few North-American cities (New York City); and in November its first concert in Madrid, Spain, took place.

Of the few performances in Portugal, the Manchester Mad Remixers (which featured The Gift together with Rodrigo Leão and Pedro Oliveira) concerts were a highlight (first at the nightclub Lux, and later at the Frágil and the Clinic bars). This was a project especially created for the &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; film&#x27;s premiere.

The band performed in numerous places: Barcelona, Valencia, Madrid, Bilbao, Vigo, New York City, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Boston, San Diego, London, Caracas, and Dunkirk, amongst many other cities.

The Gift was invited to open for The Flaming Lips and Cousteau, and at the end of the year, in December 2003, got an invitation to perform for the recently launched Portuguese MTV, recording one of the first MTV Live shows in the history of MTV Portugal.

In 2004, The Gift celebrated its first 10 years in music. By the end of the recording sessions, The Gift was faced with a double album, where two distinctive but complementary environments surfaced (one more intimate and introspective, the other more euphoric) and in which duality was the key word. The new release, the first in three years, is entitled &quot;AM-FM&quot;. &quot;AM-FM&quot; went Gold, selling more than 25,000 copies.

In 2005 they won the MTV Europe Award for Best Portuguese Act.

The song &quot;11:33&quot; from &quot;AM-FM&quot; is featured on the soundtrack of the football video game FIFA 06.

The album &quot;Fácil de Entender&quot;, their first live album, was released in 2006. It sold over 25,000 units.

The Gift performed with great success on the Expo 2008 Zaragoza, the day of Portugal, at the exhibition.

In 2008 and 2009, The Gift&#x27;s Sónia Tavares and Nuno Gonçalves, along with fellow musicians, Paulo Praça [Plaza] and Fernando Ribeiro, recorded and toured with their side project Hoje. Amalia Hoje sold more than 85,000 units.

They invited Ken Nelson [Coldplay, Gomez, Kings of Convenience, Badly Drawn Boy] to produce their 5th Album.

2011 was the year of &quot;Explode&quot;. Explode was released in Portugal on 1 April and immediately went to number one in the charts.
In September 2016, the group released a new single featuring legendary British musician Brian Eno, titled &quot;Love Without Violins&quot;. Eno co-wrote and produced, as well as sang on the track. The single was released under the band&#x27;s own record label, La Folie Records, on 30 September. A new album was also announced to be released in 2017, featuring the Grammy-nominated composer on several tracks, which he composed with the band&#x27;s keyboardist Nuno Gonçalves, and mixed by legendary producer Flood. The Portuguese band will be sharing vocal duties and instruments with Eno, who also wrote the lyrics with singer Sónia Tavares. Following the release of the new single, The Gift were confirmed to play for the second time at Eurosonic Noorderslag in Groningen, NL.

<doc id="1222265" wikidata="Q1530956" url="?curid=1222265" title="United States S-class submarine">
<text>The United States&#x27; S-class submarines, often simply called S-boats (sometimes &quot;Sugar&quot; boats, after the then-contemporary Navy phonetic alphabet for &quot;S&quot;), were the first class of submarines with a significant number built to United States Navy designs. They made up the bulk of the USN submarine service in the interwar years and could be found in every theater of operations. While not considered fleet submarines, they were the first submarines in the USN designed for open ocean, blue water operations. All previous submarines had been intended for harbor or coastal defense. These boats were intended to have greater speed and range than previous classes, with improved habitability and greater armament.

The S-class were designed during World War I, but not completed until after the war. Many boats of the class remained in service through World War II.

The United States Navy commissioned 51 S-class submarines from 1920 to 1925. The first boat in name sequence, , was commissioned in 1920 and the last numerically, , in 1922. Severe production difficulties encountered by one of the contractors threw the production sequence into disarray and the last of the class actually commissioned was in September, 1925. The S class is subdivided into four groups of different designs:
* Group I (&quot;S-1&quot; class, or &quot;Holland&quot; type): 25 boats, &quot;S-1&quot; and &quot;S-18&quot; to &quot;S-41&quot;, built by Bethlehem Steel at Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts and Union Iron Works in San Francisco, California, as subcontractors for the designer, the Electric Boat Company.
* Group II (&quot;S-3&quot; class, or &quot;Navy Yard&quot; type): 15 boats, &quot;S-3&quot; to &quot;S-17&quot;, built at the Portsmouth Navy Yard and Lake Torpedo Boat at Bridgeport, Connecticut.
* Group III (&quot;S-42&quot; class, or &quot;2nd Holland&quot; type): 6 boats, &quot;S-42&quot; to &quot;S-47&quot;, built at Fore River.
* Group IV (&quot;S-48&quot; class, or &quot;2nd Navy Yard&quot; type): 4 boats, &quot;S-48&quot; to &quot;S-51&quot;, built by Lake.

&quot;S-2&quot; was a prototype built by Lake, and was not repeated.

The first three boats in name sequence, the &quot;S-1&quot;, &quot;S-2&quot;, and &quot;S-3&quot;, were prototypes authorized in Fiscal Year 1918 and were built to the same specifications: &quot;S-1&quot; designed by Electric Boat, &quot;S-2&quot; by Lake, and &quot;S-3&quot; by the Bureau of Construction and Repair (BuC&amp;R) (later Bureau of Ships). The Electric Boat and BuC&amp;R designs were put into series production in later fiscal year appropriations.

SS-159 to SS-168 (2nd Holland) and SS-173 to SS-176 (2nd Navy Yard) were cancelled and, contrary to later practice, the hull numbers were used for subsequent submarines. Some of the material for these was used by Electric Boat to build the Peruvian Navy&#x27;s four R-boats.

The first S-boat placed into commission was the &quot;S-3&quot; on 30 January 1919, followed (in order) by &quot;S-4&quot;, &quot;S-5&quot;, &quot;S-6&quot;, and &quot;S-2&quot;. Electric Boat&#x27;s contractors in Quincy and San Francisco worked in parallel, with the first unit, &quot;S-1&quot;, built in Quincy and commissioned on 5 June 1920, and the first unit from San Francisco being the , commissioned on 29 October 1920.

==Design==
Intelligence reports received from 1914 to 1916 showed that the German U-boats then operating off Great Britain far exceeded the capabilities of the then current H, K, L, and N classes of USN submarines. If Great Britain were to fall, those boats would be unable to cross the Atlantic and fight once they got there, and this drove the requirements for the designs that would become the S-class. The Navy&#x27;s specifications called for a boat of 800 tons, with a speed of 11-14 knots and a range between 3400 and 5400 nautical miles. It was to be armed with four 21-inch torpedo tubes and a 4-inch deck gun. The Navy turned to its traditional submarine builders, Electric Boat and Lake, and asked them to submit designs, but for the first time the Navy itself developed a design to be built at its own Navy Yards. The Navy wanted to diversify the acquisition process and provide some level of competition to Electric Boat.

Even though the FY-18 boats were considered to be prototypes, the Electric Boat (EB) and the BuC&amp;R designs were intended for series production from the very beginning. The EB design formed the basis for the Group I and Group IV boats and were essentially enlarged versions of all their previous designs. A single hull design, all of the ballast tanks were contained within the pressure hull. The hull was a rounded spindle shape and the rudder was placed at the very end of the hull, aft of the twin screws. Compared to the previous R-boats, Group I S-boats were longer, with more beam, more draft, and 60% greater displacement. This allowed for greater range, larger engines and higher speed, and more torpedo reloads, though the number of forward torpedo tubes was unchanged.

The Lake design, &quot;S-2&quot;, was a modified double hull type, with ballast tanks wrapped around the inner pressure hull. The stern ended in a flat &quot;shovel&quot; shape which gave the stern needed buoyancy. The rudder was mounted beneath the stern and the pivot structure also supported the stern diving planes. To gain surface buoyancy, the superstructure atop the boat was partially watertight. Sea trials showed that the bow tended to burrow into the waves so Lake added a buoyancy tank to the bow, which gave it a humped appearance. This boat suffered from poor maneuverability and was overcomplicated. It proved to be unreliable and was not well liked by its crew. The Navy did not choose it for mass production and no further boats were produced to this design.

The BuC&amp;R design that became the &quot;S-3&quot; was a full double hull type that incorporated some design features of both the Electric Boat and Lake designs. At 231 feet long it was longer and a little wider than the other two designs. The battery was contained in one large compartment forward of the control room, giving the boat a long, sleek appearance. The long hull ended in a sharp vertical &quot;chisel&quot; at the stern, and the rudder and stern dive planes were ventrally mounted under the hull, behind the propellers.

Four of the Group II and all four the Group IV boats had an additional single stern torpedo tube. Group IV was also longer and had less draft. The Electric Boat designs (Groups I and III) were single-hulled, the others were double-hulled. All S-boats had a 4-inch (102 mm)/50 caliber deck gun, a significant increase over the 3-inch gun of previous US submarines. This was due to observations that the German U-boats frequently used their deck guns, and many U-boats were equipped with 105 mm (4.1-inch) deck guns. Another improvement was the conning tower fairwater. Previous US submarines had small fairwaters to reduce drag and improve submerged speed. Experience gained on North Atlantic patrols during World War I showed that the boats would be spending considerable time on the surface and thus needed better protection for the bridge watchstanders. Examination of captured U-boats after the Armistice also showed that a larger fairwater with permanent grab rails was preferable when surfaced in the North Atlantic, so S-boats were built or backfitted with an improved and much larger fairwater.

Future admiral Hyman G. Rickover was assigned to USS &quot;S-48&quot;. He later credited the &quot;faulty, sooty, dangerous and repellent engineering&quot; of the S-class boats with inspiring his obsession for high engineering standards.

In 1923, USS &quot;S-1&quot; experimented with a float plane (an idea the Japanese would later adopt). A cylindrical hangar was installed on the after deck to house a single Martin MS-1 float plane. Tests showed the concept to be unworkable, and the equipment was subsequently removed. The hangar was later reused and rebuilt as the prototype for the McCann Rescue Chamber, a diving bell for rescuing crewmen from sunken submarines.

==Service==
The first two boats completed by EB were the &quot;S-1&quot; at Quincy and the &quot;S-30&quot; at San Francisco. During builder&#x27;s sea trials both boats experienced severe torsional drive train vibrations during their required high-speed runs. The vibrations were so bad that both engines on both submarines were completely wrecked. Subsequent investigation showed that the crankshafts of the NELSECO 8-EB-15 engines (built by an Electric Boat subsidiary) were of an insufficient diameter, and thus were not stiff enough to resist the power stroke of each cylinder/piston as it fired, resulting in excessive torsional twisting. This was a serious deficiency, and it threw the EB production process into chaos. Some boats lingered incomplete at the builder&#x27;s yards, while others limped along at reduced power until a fix could be implemented. Eventually, the Navy Department, faced with the prospect of having a majority of the S-class being unable to meet its desired operational parameters, acquired additional funding for EB to rebuild the engines with a crankshaft of increased diameter. This solved the torsional vibration problem, but the rebuild work considerably delayed the delivery of the EB boats to the Navy, resulting in average build times exceeding 4 1/2 years. Once the engine problem was resolved, the EB boats turned in excellent service to the USN, with many serving until the end of WWII.

The boats built to the BuC&amp;R design by Portsmouth and Lake used a Bureau built MAN diesel engine, or in the case of Lake a 2-cycle or 4-cycle Busch-Sulzer engine. These engine types, while still suffering from design and engineering problems inherent in all early diesel engines, were much more reliable than the NELSECO engines used by EB and they turned in acceptable performance throughout their service lives.

===World War II service===
At the entry of the United States into World War II in December 1941, the S-class submarines ranged in age from 16 to 21 years. While the US Navy had two older classes of submarines at that time (the O and R classes originally commissioned in 1918 and 1919), the S-class was the oldest class of submarine (possibly in the world) to be used in combat operations.

During World War II, 37 S-boats were in service when the United States entered the war in December 1941. Twenty S-boats were awarded battle stars and 17 were credited with sinking a collective total of 42 Japanese ships. Six commissioned S-boats were lost during the war - five due to accidents (three by grounding, one by collision and one by flooding) and one (&quot;S-44&quot;) in combat.

Some S-class boats were transferred to other navies. Five (&quot;S-1&quot;, &quot;S-21&quot;, &quot;S-22&quot;, &quot;S-24&quot; and &quot;S-29&quot;) were transferred to the Royal Navy between March and September of 1942 and one, &quot;S-25&quot;, to Poland in November 1941. These were mostly used for training in anti-submarine warfare and removed from service by mid-1944.

S boats saw service in World War II in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. Smaller and slower than the later fleet submarines produced for war service, and lacking the range for Pacific Ocean patrols (as well as being 20 years old), they were used in reconnaissance and supply roles, as well as for coastal defense.

Eight S-boats (&quot;S-11&quot; thru &quot;S-17&quot; and &quot;S-48&quot;) spent the war entirely in the Atlantic theater. Their operations ranged from Coco Solo in Panama to Casco Bay in Maine.

S-boats operated in the Alaska theater during the aftermath of the Battle of the Aleutian Islands, based out of Dutch Harbor. Some also operated out of Australia in the Southwest Pacific Area. Most were withdrawn from front-line service by late 1943 as more fleet submarines became available, and were relegated to ASW training. Two S boats (&quot;S-42&quot; and &quot;S-47&quot;) conducted combat patrols in 1944 with the last combat patrol by an S boat being conducted by &quot;S-42&quot; from 5 August to 3 September 1944.

In World War II, S-class boats did not use the newer Mark 14 torpedo, standard in fleet submarines, due to shorter torpedo tubes, relying on the World War I-vintage Mark 10 instead. (Due to production shortages, many fleet boats used Mark 10s, also. Since the Mark 14 suffered from a high failure rate early in the war, this was not necessarily a disadvantage.)

The most notable combat success for the class was by the (SS-155). In the aftermath of the disastrous defeat of the USN and RAN at the Battle of Savo Island, the &quot;S-44&quot; encountered the withdrawing Japanese force near Kavieng on the morning of 10 August 1942. Having found themselves in the perfect position, the crew of the &quot;S-44&quot; launched a spread of four Mark 10 torpedoes, three of which hit the heavy cruiser &quot;Kako&quot;. The mortally wounded cruiser sank in seven minutes and the &quot;S-44&quot; escaped.

As newer submarines were put in service during World War II, S-boats were withdrawn from combat service and provided training support instead. Starting in late 1944, a total of 11 boats were decommissioned and used for experimental purposes, including being sunk by experimental weapons.

13 S-boats were still in service when the Japanese surrendered on 2 September 1945. Of the 13, 11 were decommissioned in October 1945, one in November and &quot;S-15&quot; remained in commission until June 1946.

==S-boat fates==
All S-boats were scrapped after World War II except those listed below.

===Lost at sea between wars===
4 submarines

This is not counted among the 52 US submarines lost during World War II, as the vessel was not in commission at the time.

===Other fates===
11 S-boats were decommissioned in 1944 and 1945 prior to the surrender of Japan. They were mostly expended as targets. The wrecksite of the target boat USS S-35 was located off Oahu, by the Lost 52 Project in 2017, not far from the &quot;S-28&quot;.

13 S-boats were in commission when the Japanese surrendered on 2 September 1945. All except one, , were decommissioned by the end of November 1945. &quot;S-15&quot; was decommissioned in June 1946.

<text>Nashville (previously &quot;Cleveland&quot;), popularly known as Windows 96 by contemporary press, was the codename for a cancelled release of Microsoft Windows scheduled to be released in 1996, between &quot;Chicago&quot; (Windows 95) and &quot;Memphis&quot; (Windows 98, at the time scheduled for release in 1996, later 1997). Nashville was intended to be a minor release focusing on a tighter integration between Windows and Internet Explorer, in order to better compete with Netscape Navigator.

Microsoft claimed that Nashville would add Internet integration features to the Windows 95 and NT 4.0 desktop, building on the new features in the Internet Explorer 3.0 web browser (due for release a few months before Nashville). Touted features included a combined file manager and web browser, the ability to seamlessly open Microsoft Office documents from within Internet Explorer using ActiveX technology and a way to place dynamic web pages directly on the desktop in place of the regular static wallpaper.

A leaked build had version number 4.10.999 (in comparison to Windows 95&#x27;s 4.00.950, Windows 95 OSR2&#x27;s 4.00.1111, Windows 98&#x27;s 4.10.1998, Windows 98 Second Edition&#x27;s 4.10.2222 A, and Windows ME&#x27;s 4.90.3000). The project was eventually cancelled as a full release of Windows, with Windows 95 OSR2 being shipped as an interim release instead. The codename &quot;Nashville&quot; was then reused for the Windows Desktop Update that shipped with Internet Explorer 4.0 and delivered most of the features promised for Nashville. The Athena PIM application would be released as Microsoft Internet Mail and News in 1996 along with IE3, which would later be renamed to Outlook Express in 1997 with IE4.

<doc id="1222268" wikidata="Q522163" url="?curid=1222268" title="Sydenham's chorea">
<text>Sydenham&#x27;s chorea, also known as rheumatic chorea, is a disorder characterized by rapid, uncoordinated jerking movements primarily affecting the face, hands and feet. Sydenham&#x27;s chorea is an autoimmune disease that results from childhood infection with Group A beta-haemolytic &quot;Streptococcus&quot;. It is reported to occur in 20–30% of people with acute rheumatic fever and is one of the major criteria for it, although it sometimes occurs in isolation. The disease occurs typically a few weeks, but up to 6 months, after the acute infection, which may have been a simple sore throat (pharyngitis).

Sydenham&#x27;s chorea is more common in females than males, and most cases affect children between 5 and 15 years of age. Adult onset of Sydenham&#x27;s chorea is comparatively rare, and the majority of the adult cases are recurrences following childhood Sydenham&#x27;s chorea (although pregnancy and female hormone treatment are also potential causes).

It is historically one of the conditions called &quot;St Vitus&#x27; dance&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==
Sydenham&#x27;s chorea is characterized by the abrupt onset (sometimes within a few hours) of neurological symptoms, classically chorea, which are non-rhythmic, writhing or explosive involuntary movements. Usually all four limbs are affected, but there are cases reported where just one side of the body is affected (&quot;hemichorea&quot;). Typical chorea includes repeated wrist hyperextension, grimacing, and lip pouting. The fingers can move as if playing the piano. There may be tongue fasciculations (&quot;bag of worms&quot;) and &quot;motor impersistence&quot;, for example, the &quot;milkmaid sign&quot; (grip strength fluctuates, as if hand milking a cow), or inability to sustain tongue protrusion (called jack-in-the-box tongue or serpentine tongue, as the tongue slides in and out of the mouth), or eye closure.

There is usually a loss of fine motor control, which is particularly obvious in handwriting if the child is of school age. Speech is often affected (dysarthria), as is walking; legs will suddenly give way or flick out to one side, giving an irregular gait and the appearance of skipping or dancing. Underlying the abnormal movements is often low tone (hypotonia) which may not become obvious until treatment is started to suppress the chorea. 

The severity of the condition can vary from just some instability on walking and difficulty with handwriting, to the extreme of being wholly unable to walk, talk, or eat (&quot;chorea paralytica&quot;).

Movements cease during sleep.

It is a neuropsychiatric disorder, so besides the motor problems there is classically emotional lability (mood swings, or inappropriate mood), but also tics, anxiety, attention deficit etc. These can precede the motor symptoms.

Non-neurologic manifestations of acute rheumatic fever may be present, namely carditis (up to 70% of cases, often subclinical, so echocardiography required), arthritis, erythema marginatum, and subcutaneous nodules.

Differentiating these signs from other involuntary movements such as tics and stereotypies can be difficult, and since these things are not uncommon they can potentially co-exist. Diagnosis is often delayed and attributed to another condition such as tic disorder or conversion disorder. The controversial PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections) hypothesis has overlapping clinical features, but Sydenham&#x27;s chorea is one of the exclusion criteria. PANDAS can present with chorea but more typically there are tics or stereotypies with a psychological component (e.g., OCD).

==Differential diagnosis==
Other disorders that may be accompanied by chorea include benign hereditary chorea, bilateral striatal necrosis, abetalipoproteinemia, ataxia–telangiectasia, biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease (BTBGD), Fahr disease, familial dyskinesia–facial myokymia (Bird–Raskind syndrome) due to an ADCY5 gene mutation, glutaric aciduria, Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, mitochondrial disorders, Huntington&#x27;s disease, Wilson disease, hyperthyroidism, lupus erythematosus, pregnancy (chorea gravidarum), drug intoxication and side effects of certain anticonvulsants (e.g. phenytoin) or psychotropic agents. Although some of these can similarly present in an acute way, there will typically be other neurological signs (such as ataxia or cognitive impairment), or other disease manifestations, or positive family history, which will help distinguish between them.

==Pathology==
One of the important manifestations of acute rheumatic fever, Sydenham&#x27;s chorea is believed to be caused by an autoimmune response following infection by group A β-hemolytic streptococci.

Two cross-reactive streptococcal antigens have been identified, the M protein and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, whereby infection leads to autoantibodies being produced against host tissues (molecular mimicry) causing a variety of streptococcal related diseases including Sydenham&#x27;s chorea but also rheumatic heart disease and nephritic syndrome. Autoantibodies against basal ganglia proteins have been found in Sydenham&#x27;s chorea but these are non-specific. Dopamine receptor autoantibodies have been reported to correlate with clinical symptoms. Whether these antibodies represent an epiphenomenon or are pathogenic, remains to be proven.

==Epidemiology==

Sydenham&#x27;s chorea is primarily seen in children.

As with rheumatic fever, Sydenham&#x27;s chorea is seen more often in less affluent communities, whether in the developing world or in aboriginal communities in the global North. High rates of impetigo are a marker for widespread streptococcal transmission.

In the UK, there are approximately 20 cases per year, according to a BPSU surveillance study.

==Diagnosis==

Chorea is distinctive, if the health care provider is familiar with it. The diagnosis is then made by the typical acute onset in the weeks following a sore throat or other minor infection, plus evidence of inflammation (raised CRP and/or ESR) and evidence of recent streptococcal infection.

To confirm recent streptococcal infection:
* Throat culture
* Anti-DNAse B titre (peaks at 8–12 weeks after infection)
* Anti-streptolysin O titre (peaks at 3–5 weeks)

None of these tests are 100% reliable, particularly when the infection was some months previously.

Further testing is directed more towards alternative diagnoses and other manifestations of rheumatic fever:
* Echocardiography
* Electroencephalography (EEG)
* Lumbar puncture
* Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain (alterations in caudate nucleus and putaminal enlargement have been described in some patients)

==Management==

Management of Sydenham&#x27;s chorea is based on the following principles:
* Eliminate the streptococcus – a course of penicillin is usually given at diagnosis to definitively clear any remaining streptococci (and avoid spread of a rheumatogenic clone), but there is no evidence that it makes any difference to the course of the illness. 
* Treat the movement disorder
* Immunosuppression
* Prevention of relapses and further cardiac damage
* Manage the disability - Occupational therapy and physiotherapy are useful for maintaining function and muscle tone.

===Treatment of chorea===
Treatment with sodium valproate is effective for controlling symptoms, but it does not speed up recovery. Haloperidol was used previously, but caused serious side effects e.g. tardive dyskinesia. Case reports exist to support carbamazepine and levetiracetam; other drugs tried include pimozide, clonidine, and phenobarbitone.

===Immunosuppression===
Immunosuppression is used inconsistently in Sydenham&#x27;s chorea. The model of an autoimmune disorder would support its use. One randomized controlled trial of steroids from Paz, Brazil in 2006 (22 cases) showed remission reduced to 54 days from 119 days. Various other reports of use of oral or IV steroids from Israel, Italy and Brazil. Immunoglobulin has been used in Holland and South Africa. Some improvement can be seen within a few days of IV steroids. In Italy, prednisolone reduced average duration of symptoms from 9 weeks to 4 weeks, and these were severe cases. South African group found less neuropsychiatric complications at 6 months with IVIG treatment (IVIG preferred due to fear of TB reactivation).

===Relapse prevention===
Penicillin prophylaxis is essential to treat cardiac features of rheumatic fever, even if subclinical (American Heart Association guideline). If there are not features to warrant a diagnosis of rheumatic fever, it is arguable whether cardiac risk justifies prophylaxis or not; however, it is likely to reduce recurrence.

===Other treatments===
There are several historical case series reporting successful treatment of Sydenham&#x27;s chorea by inducing fever.

==Prognosis==
Symptoms usually get worse over the course of two weeks, then stabilize, and finally begin to improve. Motor problems, including chorea, settle within an average of 2–3 months.

Recurrence is seen in 16–40% of cases. It is sometimes but not always associated with a rise in ASO titre or other evidence of new streptococcal infection. Recurrence is more likely with poor compliance with penicillin prophylaxis. It is more likely if there is failure to remit within 6 months of onset. Recurrence is associated in women with pregnancy (&quot;chorea gravidorum&quot;) and with female hormone treatment, although the onset of chorea can be delayed by months or more. 

Intramuscular penicillin given every 2–3 weeks is superior to a 4 weekly regime for preventing relapse, but a risk assessment may conclude that twice daily oral penicillin is sufficiently effective, less painful for the child, and less demanding on the family.

Higher recurrence rates are seen with the longest follow up – relapse can be seen 10 years or more after the initial episode, so might be underestimated by series with shorter follow up.

Recurrence is usually only chorea, even if the original case was associated with rheumatic fever. There are two total reports of heart disease worsening after recurrence of chorea. The Thailand study also had 2 cases where carditis, which had improved after initial diagnosis, came back again. Some suggest that recurrent chorea is a different disease altogether.

10% reported long-term tremor in one study (10 years follow up). Long term neuropsychiatric difficulties are increasingly recognized (49 studies so far, especially obsessive-compulsive disorder but also attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, affective disorders, tic disorders, executive function disturbances, psychotic features, and language impairment).

Heart involvement improves in about a third of cases (whether silent or not).

==History==
The incidence of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease is not declining. Recent figures quote the incidence of Acute Rheumatic Fever as 0.6–0.7/1,000 population in the United States and Japan compared with 15–21/1,000 population in Asia and Africa. The prevalence of Acute Rheumatic Fever and Sydenham&#x27;s Chorea has declined progressively in developed countries over the last decades.

==Etymology==
It is named after British physician Thomas Sydenham (1624–1689). The alternative eponym, &quot;Saint Vitus Dance&quot;, is in reference to Saint Vitus, a Christian saint who was persecuted by Roman emperors and died as a martyr in AD 303. Saint Vitus is considered to be the patron saint of dancers, with the eponym given as homage to the manic dancing that historically took place in front of his statue during the feast of Saint Vitus in Germanic and Latvian cultures.

<doc id="1222272" wikidata="Q2001391" url="?curid=1222272" title="Borough Green">
<text>Borough Green is situated in the borough of Tonbridge and Malling in Kent, England. The central area is situated on the A25 road between Maidstone and Sevenoaks, with the M26 motorway running through the centre dividing Wrotham and Borough Green.

==History==
===Pre-Roman===
Two Paleolithic rock shelters were found at Oldbury Hill some two miles west of Borough Green with flint tools from about 50,000 years BCE.

===Roman remains===
Roman cinerary urns were first found in Barrow Field off Staley&#x27;s Road in 1839 but were reburied and lost to history. In the 1880s there was a much more important find on location north of the railway station where sand was being excavated. In 1898 a local archaeologist Benjamin Harrison of Ightham persuaded the owners to stop destroying them. He called in George Payne who identified them as Roman. There was a Roman cemetery consisting of rows of cinerary urns six feet apart and two feet deep. The burials date from around the year 100 CE.

===Historical inns===
The first record of this name was in 1575, when it appears as Borrowe Grene. Middle English grene means village green The name itself is much older. It is not known if this from Old English &quot;burh&quot; &#x27;manor, borough&#x27; or from &quot;beorg&quot; &#x27;hill, mound&#x27;. 

The name of the community describes what it originally was – a green to which the people of the area went for sports and games. There is also a view that &quot;borough&quot;, which predates any borough council in the area, relates to the word barrow, possibly referring to the Roman remains near the station site.

Its location at a crossroads with the old route from Gravesend to Hastings meant that inns were gradually opened. The &quot;Red Lion&quot;, originally the &quot;White Bear&quot;, first mentioned in 1586, is now closed. The 1592 &quot;Black Bull&quot; became the &quot;Black Horse&quot;, then &quot;The Black Horse and Hooden&quot;, and recently &quot;The Black Horse&quot; again. &quot;The Bull&quot; of 1753 survives, but the &quot;Red Lion&quot;, &quot;Fox and Hounds&quot; (1837) and &quot;The Rock&quot; (1860) have been turned into private housing. The Red Lion building still exists as part of the Red Lion Square housing development. The Fox and Hounds and the Rock were demolished to make way for Foxlea and Tavern Close respectively. The 1878 &quot;Railway Hotel&quot;, later &quot;The Henry Simmonds&quot;, is now a Sainsbury&#x27;s Local food store.
===Nineteenth century===

In Borough Green there were 360 residents in 1841, 241 in 1861, 232 in 1871. The village expanded after the railway opened and in 1891 there were 682 inhabitants.

The London, Chatham and Dover Railway opened a line to Maidstone on 1 June 1874, and a station named &quot;Wrotham and Borough Green&quot; was built. Later the names were reversed to Borough Green and Wrotham, in line with the position of the station within Borough Green, and the fact that Borough Green had outgrown Wrotham.

An infant school was built on the direction of the local school board in 1875 to the design of architect Robert Wheeler.

Western Road was planned in 1877 after the sale of 56 acres of land by the Tomlyn family between the High Street and Fairfield.
Town gas was provided by the Wrotham and Borough Green Gas Co from 1880 and in 1904 was taken over by the Mid Kent Gas Light and Coke Company.

The River Bourne flows through the southern part of the parish. It once powered a paper mill at Basted.

===Recent history===
Piped water came from the Mid Kent Water Co. in 1900. Kent Electric Power Co. brought electricity in 1930.

During the Battle of Britain, Polish Air Force flying ace Ludwik Paszkiewicz was killed when his Hurricane fighter was shot down by a Luftwaffe Bf 109 on 27 September 1940. A memorial stone dedicated to Paszkiewicz was unveiled in 2018, at Crowhurst Farm in Borough Green, close to where he was shot down.

== Basted Mills Public Open Space ==
This area of 18.33 acres is a mile south from the centre of the town and is on the border of 4 parishes: Borough Green, Ightham, Platt and Plaxtol. There is no parking area. The old mill pond is a key point of interest. There are two meadows and woodland with picnic areas and woodland walks. The site of Basted Paper Mill, a local employer. The mill records go back to 1438 when it was probably a water mill for grinding corn. Walter Monckton bought the mill in 1857, a grandfather of Viscount Monckton of Brenchley. The Monckton family lived in Kent since the Late 16th Century.

There has been a paper mill on the site for 200 years. Ightham men and women worked there. Monckton rebuilt the mill in 1875. The mill was rebuilt following a fire in 1917 and worked on steam power until 1960, and closed after damage in floods in 1968. The mill supplied paper for postage stamps. A small housing area was built on the site at the end of the 20th Century.

== Governance ==
There are three tiers of local government covering Borough Green, at parish, district and county level: Borough Green Parish Council, Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council and Kent County Council. The parish council meets at the village hall on High Street.

Borough Green was historically part of the parish of Wrotham. In 1863 the parish was made a local government district, governed by a local board. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts in 1894. Although named after Wrotham, the urban district council was always based in Borough Green, which was growing to become the largest settlement in the parish following the opening of the railway station in 1874. The council met at the Railway Hotel on Wrotham Road (now Sainsbury&#x27;s) until 1902, then at a converted house it leased at 2 Sevenoaks Road from 1902 until 1924, before building its own headquarters at 16–18 Maidstone Road in 1924. Wrotham Urban District was abolished in 1934, with the area being absorbed into Malling Rural District and divided into the parishes of Borough Green (which also took some territory from Ightham), Platt, Plaxtol and Wrotham. Malling Rural District in turn was abolished in 1974 to become part of Tonbridge and Malling.

==Sports==
Borough Green is home to the British Racing and Sports Car Club, one of the major organisers of motorsports events in the United Kingdom. The village&#x27;s main football team is Potters Football Club of the Sevenoaks &amp; District Premier Division, which fields one men&#x27;s team. It has close ties with Borough Green Junior Football Club, which is also located in the village.

==Churches==
Several denominations have places of worship in Borough Green:
*Anglican – Church of England: The Church of the Good Shepherd, Quarry Hill Road. Before 1875 Church of England members walked to Wrotham, Ightham, Platt or Plaxtol to go to Church. From that year services were held in the new Church of England Infants School. The foundation stone of the Church of the Good Shepherd was laid by Emmeline St. Tour, Countess Torrington on 9 January 1906 and consecrated by the Bishop of Rochester, Dr John Harmer on 5 July 1906. The Architects were Monckton and Gillespie.

:Borough Green did not become a separate Church of England parish until 1973. Before that the village was divided into three church parishes. Most of the village was in Wrotham parish. The part in Ightham parish started at the junction of Rock road and the A25 and included everything West of Rock Road. After 1843 part of the village was in Platt parish and the Black Horse Inn marked the boundary.
*Baptist – Association of Grace Baptist Churches (South East): Borough Green Baptist Church, High Street. The land the chapel now stands on was purchased in 1816. Described as ‘wasteland’, it was sold as an outcome of the Enclosure Acts passed in 1814. It was purchased for twenty two pounds and ten shillings”. The chapel was opened for divine wor- ship in the spring of 1817.

*Roman Catholic – St Joseph&#x27;s, Western Road. The old village hall was built on this site in 1927. It was purchased by the diocese of Southwark in 1965. In 2017 a purpose-built church was officially opened on the site of the old building which had been demolished to make way for the new church.
==Amenities==
The village and nearby communities are served by Borough Green Primary School.
The Medical Centre on Quarry Hill Road, opened in 1993 provides GP care. The first recorded practitioners in Borough Green were Dr AA Lipscomb and the Walker family.

The library was started in 1922 at the council school. it moved several times and finally to its purpose built building in 1977.

The Fire Brigade was founded in 1934. The modern Fire Station in Western Road was opened in 1964.

The Village Hall was built in 1964-65. It serves as a polling station during elections.


Borough Green had branches of two nationwide retail banks, both of which closed in 2017. The former NatWest building on High Street is now Costa Coffee. There are branches of the Co-op, Sainsbury&#x27;s Local and Nisa. Borough Green Post Office on the High Street is located in Nisa. There are several independent retailers and teashops.

<text>Junior Wells (born Amos Wells Blakemore Jr.; December 9, 1934January 15, 1998) was an American singer, harmonica player, and recording artist. He is best known for his signature song &quot;Messin&#x27; with the Kid&quot; and his 1965 album &quot;Hoodoo Man Blues&quot;, described by the critic Bill Dahl as &quot;one of the truly classic blues albums of the 1960s&quot;. Wells himself categorized his music as rhythm and blues.

Wells performed and recorded with various notable blues musicians, including Muddy Waters, Earl Hooker, and Buddy Guy. He remained a fixture on the blues scene throughout his career and also crossed over to rock audiences while touring with the Rolling Stones. Not long before Wells died, the blues historian Gerard Herzhaft called him &quot;one of the rare active survivors of the &#x27;golden age of the blues.

==Early life ==
Wells may have been born in Memphis, Tennessee, and raised in West Memphis, Arkansas (some sources report that he was born in West Memphis). 

Initially taught by his cousin Junior Parker and by Sonny Boy Williamson II, Wells learned to play the harmonica skillfully by the age of seven. Wells told the following story, printed on the cover of his album &quot;Hoodoo Man Blues&quot;:
I went to this pawnshop downtown and the man had a harmonica priced at $2.00. I got a job on a soda truck... played hookey from school ... worked all week and on Saturday the man gave me a dollar and a half. A dollar and a half! For a whole week of work. I went to the pawnshop and the man said the price was two dollars. I told him I &quot;had&quot; to have that harp. He walked away from the counter – left the harp there. So I laid my dollar-and-a-half on the counter and picked up the harp. When my trial came up, the judge asked me why I did it. I told him I &quot;had&quot; to have that harp. The judge asked me to play it and when I did he gave the man the 50 cents and hollered &#x27;Case dismissed!&#x27;

==Career==
He moved to Chicago in 1948 with his mother, after her divorce, and began sitting in with local musicians at house parties and taverns. Wild and rebellious but needing an outlet for his talents, he began performing with the Aces, consisting of the brothers Dave and Louis Myers on guitars and the drummer Fred Below, with whom he developed a modern amplified harmonica style influenced by Little Walter. In 1952, he made his first recordings when he replaced Little Walter in Muddy Waters&#x27;s band and played on one of Waters&#x27;s sessions for Chess Records in 1952. His first recordings as a bandleader were made in the following year for States Records. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he recorded singles for Chief Records and its subsidiary, Profile Records, including &quot;Messin&#x27; with the Kid&quot;, &quot;Come on in This House&quot;, and &quot;It Hurts Me Too&quot;, which would remain in his repertoire throughout his career. His 1960 Profile single &quot;Little by Little&quot; (written by Chief owner and producer Mel London) reached number 23 on the Billboard R&amp;B chart, the first of his two singles to enter the chart.

Wells&#x27;s album &quot;Hoodoo Man Blues&quot;, released in 1965 by Delmark Records, featured Buddy Guy on guitar. The two worked with the Rolling Stones on several occasions in the 1970s. Wells&#x27;s album &quot;South Side Blues Jam&quot; was released in 1971, followed by &quot;On Tap&quot; in 1975.
His 1996 release &quot;Come On in This House&quot; includes performances by the slide guitarists Alvin Youngblood Hart and Derek Trucks, among others. Wells appeared in the film &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;, released in 1998.

==Death==
Wells began to have severe health problems, including cancer and a heart attack, in 1997. He died in Chicago on January 15, 1998, and was interred in the Oak Woods Cemetery, Chicago.

<doc id="1222278" wikidata="Q939385" url="?curid=1222278" title="Vincent (1982 film)">
<text>Vincent is a 1982 American gothic stop-motion animated short film written, designed and directed by Tim Burton, and produced by Rick Heinrichs.

The film is narrated by actor Vincent Price, a lifelong idol of and inspiration for Burton. From this relationship, Price would go on to appear in Burton&#x27;s &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;. Vincent Price later said that &quot;Vincent&quot; was &quot;the most gratifying thing that ever happened. It was immortality — better than a star on Hollywood Boulevard.&quot;

There is currently no individual release of the film except for a few bootleg releases. It can be found on the 2008 Special Edition and Collector&#x27;s Edition DVDs of &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; as a bonus feature and on the Cinema16 DVD &quot;American Short Films&quot;.

== Plot ==
&quot;Vincent&quot; is the story, told in rhyming verse, of a 7-year-old boy, Vincent Malloy, who pretends to be like the actor Vincent Price (who narrates the film). He does experiments on his dog Abercrombie in order to create a horrible ravenous zombie dog. He is obsessed with the tales of Edgar Allan Poe, and it is his detachment from reality when reading them that leads to his delusions that he is in fact a tortured artist and mad scientist, deprived of the woman he loves, mirroring certain parts of Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Raven&quot;. The film ends with Vincent feeling terrified of being tortured by the going-ons of his make-believe world, quoting &quot;The Raven&quot; as he falls to the floor in frailty, believing himself to be dead.

== Production and release ==
While working as a conceptual artist at Walt Disney Productions, Tim Burton found himself two allies in Disney executive Julie Hickson, and Head of Creative Development Tom Wilhite. The two were impressed with Burton&#x27;s unique talents and, while they felt he was not &quot;Disney material&quot;, they still thought he deserved respect. In 1982, Wilhite gave Burton $60,000 to produce an adaptation of a poem Burton had written titled &quot;Vincent&quot;. Burton had originally planned the poem to be a children&#x27;s short story book but thought otherwise.

Together with fellow Disney animator Rick Heinrichs, stop motion animator Stephen Chiodo and cameraman Victor Abdalov, Burton worked on the project for two months and came up with the six-minute short film. Shot in stark black-and-white in the style of the German Expressionist films of the 1920s, Vincent imagines himself in a series of situations inspired by the Vincent Price/Edgar Allan Poe films that had such an effect on Burton as a child, including experimenting on his dog — a theme that would subsequently appear in &quot;Frankenweenie&quot; — and welcoming his aunt home while simultaneously conjuring up the image of her dipped in hot wax. Vincent Malloy, the main character in the film, bears a striking resemblance to Tim Burton himself.

The film was narrated by Burton&#x27;s childhood idol, Vincent Price, and marked the beginning of a friendship between them that lasted until Price&#x27;s death in 1993. Burton credits the experience as one of the most formative experiences of his life.

The film was theatrically released for two weeks in one Los Angeles cinema with the teen drama &quot;Tex&quot;. Before it was consigned to the Disney vaults, it garnered several critical accolades when it played at film festivals in London, Chicago and Seattle, winning two awards at Chicago and the Critics&#x27; Prize at the Annecy Film Festival in France.

== Cameos ==
An early form of the character of Jack Skellington from &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; can be seen in the upper-left corner of the screen from 1:18–1:25 as well as in front of the embodiment of his deceased wife from 4:45–4:47. Jack also appeared in Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; and the stop-motion animation film &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;. The first two cameos were years before production of &quot;Nightmare&quot;, though Burton had toyed with the original story idea while still an animator at Disney.

The character Prince Vince, from the &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; animated cartoon which would premiere seven years later, is named after and bears a strong resemblance to Vincent Malloy, both in appearance and mannerisms.

<doc id="1222285" wikidata="Q3355150" url="?curid=1222285" title="The Simpsons Archive">
<text>The Simpsons Archive, also known by its previous domain name snpp.com or simply SNPP (named for the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant), is a Simpsons fan site that has been online since 1994. Maintained by dozens of volunteers from—amongst other places—the newsgroup alt.tv.simpsons and &quot;Simpsons&quot;-related forums, the site features information on every aspect of the show, from detailed guides to upcoming episodes and merchandise, to the episode capsules (text files documenting freeze frame jokes, quotes, scene summaries, reviews and the like), for which the site is well known. In a bid to steer clear of Fox&#x27;s legal department after a conflict in 1996, the site contains no multimedia or interactive features, preferring to focus on documenting the show through textual material. As of October 2005, the site receives roughly 1.2 million hits per month. In December 2013, it was moved to simpsonsarchive.com, with the original snpp.com domain returned to the owner that had provided it to the project at no cost since 1995.

The Archive began in 1994, the brainchild of Gary Goldberg, with extensive help from the members of alt.tv.simpsons at the time, including Raymond Chen, the first to compile the episode capsules, and Dave Hall, one of the first online Simpsons fans to champion list-compiling. The site, originally based on the Widener archive set up by Brendan Kehoe in 1989, featured a bright yellow and black design until 1998, when it was revamped to the more subdued style.

The episode capsule is a convention that has since crossed over to many other TV show fansites and newsgroups, including co-Matt Groening animation &quot;Futurama&quot;. Episodes featured are up to and including thirteenth season&#x27;s &quot;The Bart Wants What It Wants&quot;.
;Miscellaneous : A collection of both internal and external copies of academic papers, articles, interviews and the like relating to the show, dating back as far as 1987.

In addition to this, the site offers a search facility and an &quot;About the Archive&quot; page which allows you to contact any of the various maintainers and check which new pages and episode capsules have been added since your last visit.

==Publicity==
The site has been featured in many publications, including the UK magazine &quot;WebUser&quot;, in which the site ranked #3 in their list of the &quot;Top 100 TV Websites&quot; back in 2002, and several unofficial &quot;Simpsons&quot; books including the analytical &quot;Planet Simpson&quot; by Chris Turner and the UK-issued episode guides &quot;The Pocket Essentials: The Simpsons&quot; by Peter Mann and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s A Bigger, Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot; by Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood. In &quot;Planet Simpson&quot;, Turner thanks the Simpsons Archive, saying that the book would have been impossible without it.

Matt Groening, creator of the show, was once quoted in the Argentinian newspaper &quot;La Nación&quot; as saying: &quot;Sometimes we have to look at fan sites to remember [what we have done before]: one of the best is www.snpp.com. I have no idea what those initials mean, but it has a lot of stuff. Though for them, every episode is the worst ever.&quot; Reviews from the site&#x27;s episode capsules have also been mentioned in the DVD commentaries by various members of the show&#x27;s staff.

In 2007, it was ranked number five on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;25 essential fansites&quot;.

<doc id="1222289" wikidata="Q1069623" url="?curid=1222289" title="Chemosis">
<text>Chemosis is the swelling (or edema) of the conjunctiva. The term derives from the Greek words &quot;cheme&quot; and &quot;-osis&quot;, &quot;cheme&quot; meaning cockleshell due to the swollen conjunctiva resembling it, and &quot;-osis&quot; meaning condition. The swelling is due to the oozing of exudate from abnormally permeable capillaries. In general, chemosis is a nonspecific sign of eye irritation. The outer surface covering appears to have fluid in it. The conjunctiva becomes swollen and gelatinous in appearance. Often, the eye area swells so much that the eyes become difficult or impossible to close fully. Sometimes, it may also appear as if the eyeball has moved slightly backwards from the white part of the eye due to the fluid filled in the conjunctiva all over the eyes except the iris. The iris is not covered by this fluid and so it appears to be moved slightly inwards.

== Causes ==
It is usually caused by allergies or viral infections, often inciting excessive eye rubbing. Chemosis is also included in the Chandler Classification system of orbital infections.

If chemosis has occurred due to excessive rubbing of the eye, the first aid to be given is a cold water wash for eyes.

Other causes of chemosis include:
*Superior vena cava obstruction, accompanied by facial oedema
*Hyperthyroidism, associated with exophthalmos, periorbital puffiness, lid retraction, and lid lag
*Cavernous sinus thrombosis, associated with infection of the paranasal sinuses, proptosis, periorbital oedema, retinal haemorrhages, papilledema, extraocular movement abnormalities, and trigeminal nerve sensory loss
*Carotid-cavernous fistula – classic triad of chemosis, pulsatile proptosis, and ocular bruit
*Cluster headache
*Trichinellosis
*Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
*Angioedema
*Acute glaucoma
*Panophthalmitis
*Orbital cellulitis
*Gonorrheal conjunctivitis
*Dacryocystitis
*Spitting cobra venom to the eye
*High concentrations of phenacyl chloride in chemical mace spray
*Urticaria
*Trauma
*HSV Keratitis 
*Post surgical
*Mucor
*Rhabdomyosarcoma of the orbit

==Diagnosis==

An eye doctor may most often diagnose chemosis by doing a physical examination of the affected area. They can also ask questions about the severity and length of other symptoms.

== Treatment ==
Treatment depends on the cause of the chemosis.

<doc id="1222291" wikidata="Q2380643" url="?curid=1222291" title="Paisley Park">
<text>Paisley Park is a 65,000 square foot estate in Chanhassen, Minnesota, United States, once owned by American musician Prince. It was opened to the public as a museum in October 2016.

==History==
Construction of the $10 million complex began in January 1986, and officially opened on September 11, 1987. Designed by architecture firm BOTO Design Inc., of Santa Monica, California, the main designers were architect Bret Thoeny and acoustician Marshall Long. The complex shares its name with Prince&#x27;s 1985 single, &quot;Paisley Park&quot;.

The Paisley Park studio complex totalled 55,000 square feet by the early 1990s, and includes four recording studios, a 12,500 square-foot sound stage, a video editing suite, rehearsal room, offices, tenant space, and an underground parking garage. Other amenities include an outdoor basketball court, and living quarters. 

Paisley Park&#x27;s four recording studios are designated A, B, C, and D. Studio A is a 1,500 square-foot space and originally utilized a 48-channel mixing console, which was later replaced by a 64-channel SSL 6000E. Studio B is a 1,000 square-foot space that was, per Prince&#x27;s specifications, patterned after Sunset Sound&#x27;s Studio 3, with a custom-built Automated Processes, Inc. API mixing console. Studio C has a 36-input Soundcraft TS24 console, and Studio D is a small DAW-based room.

Initially a private studio used by Prince and Paisley Park Records artists like The Time, Carmen Electra, Jill Jones, Sheila E. and others, Paisley Park&#x27;s production facilities were used by numerous artists, including Tevin Campbell, Martika, Fine Young Cannibals, Barry Manilow, Steve Miller, Bee Gees, Chris Mars, BoDeans, Madonna, Bob Mould, George Clinton, George Benson, Stone Temple Pilots, Stevie Wonder, R.E.M., and A-ha.

After the Paisley Park Records label folded in 1994, Prince continued to live and record at Paisley Park Studios, and he intended to establish Paisley Park as a public venue like Graceland. He was found dead in his estate&#x27;s elevator on April 21, 2016.

In the basement of Paisley Park, there is a vault that held unreleased material, hundreds of hours of live recordings, music videos, and unheard songs. The contents of the vault have been since removed and relocated to a studio in Los Angeles to be restored, remastered, and stored in climate-controlled conditions to be used for later releases.

An urn in the shape of Paisley Park which contains Prince&#x27;s ashes was on display in Paisley Park&#x27;s main entrance for a period of time after his death; after being moved into the vault, the urn was brought back out in 2021.

==Museum==
After Prince&#x27;s death, Paisley Park was turned into a museum open to the public, and tours of the Paisley Park Museum started in October 2016. Graceland Holdings, the company that has managed Elvis Presley&#x27;s Graceland since 1982, organizes the tours. Tours include recording studios, soundstages, and artifacts from Prince&#x27;s personal archives.

<doc id="1222296" wikidata="Q15515625" url="?curid=1222296" title="Joseph Coerten Hornblower">
<text>Joseph Coerten Hornblower (May 7, 1777 – June 11, 1864) was an American lawyer and jurist from Belleville, New Jersey. He was the chief justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court.

==Early life and education==
Hornblower was born on May 7, 1777, in Belleville, New Jersey, and lived there for his entire life. His parents were Josiah and Elizabeth (née Kingsland) Hornblower. Josiah Hornblower was a prominent engineer and mine operator who served in the Continental Congress.

As a child, Joseph&#x27;s health was poor, so he was educated at home. He had a &quot;stroke of paralysis&quot; at the age of 16 that affected his memory. But he read for the law with an attorney in Newark and was admitted to the bar in 1803.

Later in his life, Princeton University conferred him with an honorary degree of Legum Doctor on September 30, 1841.

==Career==

===Law and political career===
He became a prominent lawyer and politically active as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party. However, this was the Era of Good Feelings, and party politics were minimal.

When Hornblower was a Presidential elector for James Monroe in 1820, there was only one vote for any other candidate. He also supported other civic and religious activities. In 1816 he was one of the founders of the American Bible Society. In 1845 he aided in establishing the New Jersey Historical Society and served as its president from then until his death in 1864.

===Chief Justice===
In November 1832, Hornblower was named to the state&#x27;s Supreme Court as its chief justice. He was re-elected in 1839 and served until 1846. When New Jersey rewrote the state&#x27;s Constitution in 1844, he was an active member of the convention.

In 1836, Chief Justice Hornblower wrote an unpublished opinion in &quot;New Jersey vs. Sheriff of Burlington&quot; that was later used to argue a legal precedent against the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. He allowed the accused Alexander Helmsley who was being held as a fugitive slave to be released. He argued the state law that the accused was being held under was unconstitutional given the New Jersey state constitution.

===Later career===
When he stepped down from the bench, he became a professor of law at Princeton Law School in 1846 and returned to his interest in political activity.

Hornblower&#x27;s political interests became directed toward the nascent Republican Party. He was chairman of the New Jersey delegation and one of the vice-presidents of the 1856 Republican National Convention that nominated John C. Fremont for U.S. President.

==Personal life==
Hornblower had eight children, including:
* William Henry Hornblower – Presbyterian minister who was the father of United States Supreme Court nominee William B. Hornblower
* Emily – wife of Colonel Alexander McWhorter Cumming, a long-serving Mayor of Princeton, New Jersey
* Mary – wife of Joseph P. Bradley, Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court

He was friends with Chief Justice John Jay.

==Death==
Hornblower died at home in Belleville, New Jersey on June 11, 1864.

<text>Martin Roger Seymour-Smith (24 April 1928 – 1 July 1998) was a British poet, literary critic, and biographer.

==Biography==
Seymour-Smith was born in London and educated at Highgate School and St Edmund Hall, Oxford, where he was editor of &quot;Isis&quot; and &quot;Oxford Poetry&quot;. His father Frank was a chief librarian who supplied books to Robert Graves, and who published the survey &quot;An English Library, an Annotated List of 1300 Classics&quot; in 1943, followed by &quot;What Shall I Read Next: a Personal Selection of Twentieth Century English Books&quot; in 1953. His mother Marjorie wrote poetry and published under the name of Elena Fearn. 

He began as one of the most promising Anglophone post-war poets, but became better known as a critic, writing biographies of Robert Graves (whom he met first at age 14 and maintained close ties with), Rudyard Kipling and Thomas Hardy, and producing numerous critical studies. The poet and critic Robert Nye stated that Seymour-Smith was &quot;one of the finest British poets after 1945.&quot; Others to praise his poetry included Robert Graves, C. H. Sisson, Geoffrey Grigson and James Reeves.

Seymour-Smith came to prominence in 1963, as the editor of the first twentieth-century edition of &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets&quot; to use the &#x27;original&#x27; spelling. Characteristically, his commentary concerned Shakespeare&#x27;s sexuality, which upset many. Later, his &quot;Fallen Women&quot; (1969) and &quot;Sex and Society&quot; (1975) would become &#x27;standard plundering material for more famous works&#x27; as the author good-humouredly claimed. He had known Alex Comfort, who was then writing &quot;The Joy of Sex&quot; (1972), from their schooldays at Highgate School and the two often swapped notes.

Seymour-Smith&#x27;s &quot;Poets Through their Letters Vol 1&quot; (Wyatt to Coleridge) was acclaimed for its scholarship, but sold poorly. Hence, Volume 2 was never published.

His two volumes of poetry &quot;Tea with Miss Stockport&quot; (1963) and &quot;Reminiscences of Norma&quot; (1971), were praised by many, including Peter Porter. But an apparent creative silence till his last collection, &quot;Wilderness&quot; (1994), led to a decline in his reputation with the reading public during the 1980s.

&quot;The Guide to Modern World Literature&quot; is an encyclopaedic attempt to describe all major 20th-century authors, in all languages. The book is over 1450 pages long. Cyril Connolly said of the first (1973) edition: &quot;I&#x27;m very much afraid he will prove indispensable!&quot; His criticism of Lawrence Durrell singled out his poetry as his real achievement; John Fowles, Muriel Spark, C. P. Snow, Malcolm Bradbury and Ted Hughes received the first adverse criticism of their reputations in this book. The stature of Anthony Powell&#x27;s &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot; (1951–1976) as the greatest fictional post-war achievement was asserted: a view endorsed by Kingsley Amis and Hilary Spurling. He also predicted that T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Four Quartets&quot; would not survive as a great poem by 2000.

The polyglot Seymour-Smith further used the book to champion writers he regarded as under-rated, such as James Hanley, Laura Riding, Wyndham Lewis, Roberto Arlt, Pio Baroja, Rayner Heppenstall and Jose Maria Arguedas, while attacking those he felt were overvalued, such as George Bernard Shaw, W. H. Auden and as mentioned above, T. S. Eliot. Seymour-Smith also disparaged Harold Pinter, Margaret Atwood, and Tom Stoppard, whom he thought over-rated.

In 1981 &quot;The New Astrologer&quot; was published, Seymour-Smith&#x27;s only book on this subject.

Anthony Burgess likened Seymour-Smith to Samuel Johnson due to his many literary surveys from &quot;The Guide to Modern World Literature&quot; in 1975 onwards.

When the 2013 new edition of the &quot;Oxford Companion of Modern Poetry&quot; was published, he was notably not included.

==Private life==
He married Janet de Granville in 1952 while spending a working holiday in Mallorca where he was a tutor to Graves&#x27; son and Graves employed de Granville as a translator. Graves was a witness at the wedding.
When he was asked how he managed to read so much he admitted that he hadn&#x27;t. Janet had. They were rarely apart and she died two months after he did.

<text>The IBM 4758 PCI Cryptographic Coprocessor is a secure cryptoprocessor implemented on a high-security, tamper resistant, programmable PCI expansion card. Specialized cryptographic electronics, microprocessor, memory, and random number generator housed within a tamper-responding environment provide a highly secure subsystem in which data processing and cryptography can be performed. 

IBM supplies two cryptographic-system implementations, and toolkits for custom application development:
* The PKCS#11, version 2.01 implementation creates a high-security solution for application programs developed for this industry-standard API. 
* The IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture implementation provides many functions of special interest in the finance industry and a base on which custom processing and cryptographic functions can be added. 

As of June 2005, the 4758 was discontinued and was replaced by an improved, faster model called the IBM 4764.

<text>Anil Dhirubhai Ambani (born 4 June 1959) is an Indian businessman, chairman, and managing director of Reliance Group (a.k.a. Reliance ADA Group). The Reliance Group was created in July 2006 following a demerger from Reliance Industries Limited. He led several listed corporations, including Reliance Capital, Reliance Infrastructure, Reliance Power, and Reliance Communications. Anil&#x27;s net worth is currently estimated at around Rs 2.5 billion.

Ambani, once the sixth richest person in the world, declared bankruptcy before a UK court in February 2020. He served in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India from Uttar Pradesh, as an Independent MP between 2004 and 2006.

==Life and education==
Anil Ambani is the youngest son of the founder of Reliance Industries, Dhirubhai Ambani and his wife Kokilaben Ambani. Ambani has said that his father would lead the brothers on &quot;incentive-oriented outings&quot; where they would be rewarded with a box of mangoes for a 10-km (6 mile) hike, but also punished them for acting out in front of guests. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree from Kishinchand Chellaram College and received a Master in Business Administration at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1983.

==Business career==
Ambani&#x27;s father Dhirubhai died in 2002 without leaving a clear succession plan. After bickering between Anil and his brother Mukesh, their mother Kokilaben mediated and split the family-owned businesses between the two brothers.

Anil Ambani received parts of Reliance Group with interests in telecom, entertainment, financial services, power and infrastructure. Ambani is also credited with India&#x27;s largest IPO, that of Reliance Power, which in 2008 was subscribed in less than 60 seconds, the fastest in the history of Indian capital markets to date.

In 2005 Ambani made his debut in the entertainment industry with an acquisition of a majority stake in Adlabs Films, a company with interests in film processing, production, exhibition and digital cinema. The company was renamed Reliance MediaWorks in 2009.
In 2008 a joint venture worth US$1.2 billion with Steven Spielberg&#x27;s production company DreamWorks cast Ambani&#x27;s entertainment business on to a global platform. He has contributed to the production of several Spielberg films, including the Academy Award-winning &quot;Lincoln&quot;.

Ambani gained notoriety as one of the fastest destroyers of shareholder wealth in the last 100 years with the combined group market cap declining by 90% since the formation of the Reliance ADA Group.

In early 2019, a court in Mumbai held Ambani in criminal contempt for non-payment of personally guaranteed debt Reliance Communications owed to Swedish gear maker Ericsson. Instead of jail time, the court gave him a month to come up with the funds. At the end of the month, Ambani was bailed out by his elder brother, Mukesh Ambani.

In April 2019, three ADAG Companies reached standstill agreement with Franklin Templeton after secured NCD default. This led to SEBI changing mutual fund regulation of reducing unlisted NCDs exposure to 10% and making standstill agreement void. In aftermath, FT India didn&#x27;t sell the pledged securities and wound 6 debt funds affecting 300,000 investors.

In February 2020, Anil Ambani was locked in a legal battle with 3 Chinese banks. He was asked to set aside by the court which led him to make the statement that his net worth is currently zero after considering his liabilities. The dispute still rages on with the UK court ordering him to pay the 3 Chinese banks to the tune of .

In October 2021, Anil Ambani was named in the Pandora Papers along with his brother Mukesh. In January 2023, the Bombay High Court questioned the Income Tax Department&#x27;s accusation of tax evasion against Anil Ambani after a petition by him challenged the decision of the notice issued by the department.

==Personal life==
Ambani belongs to a Gujarati family which hails from the village of Chorwad near Junagadh in the Kathiawar region of Gujarat, India. He is the youngest son of the legendary textile entrepreneur Dhirubhai Ambani and his wife, Smt. Kokilaben Ambani, a devoted home-maker who founded the Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital in suburban Mumbai. Anil is one of four children. He has an older brother, Mukesh Ambani, and two sisters, Smt. Nina Kothari (wife of late Bhadra Shyam Kothari) and Smt. Deepti Salgaocar (wife of Dattaraj Salgoncar).

Anil Ambani is married to the actress Tina Munim. He married her after facing much resistance from his family, because she came from the world of fashion and glamour, and her lifestyle choices before marriage had been unconventional. Nevertheless, the couple have had a stable marriage and have two sons, Jai Anmol Ambani and Jai Anshul Ambani. As of 2010, Ambani and his family reside at The Sea Wind, a 14-story building in Mumbai. On 20 February 2022, Ambani&#x27;s elder son, Jai Anmol, married Krisha Shah, daughter of the late Nikunj Shah, a Mumbai-based entrepreneur.

Ambani is a teetotaler and a vegetarian. As an avid jogger, he also runs marathons.

==Awards and recognition==

* Selected by Asiaweek magazine for its list of &#x27;Leaders of the Millennium in Business and Finance&#x27; and was introduced as the only &#x27;new hero&#x27; in Business and Finance from India, June 1999.

==Allegations of political connections==
In 2018, India&#x27;s principal opposition party, Indian National Congress, accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of favouring Anil Ambani&#x27;s defence manufacturing company over HAL, a public sector enterprise, in a fighter aircraft deal worth with French manufacturing firm Dassault. Ambani, several of whose companies are debt-ridden, has denied all charges of benefiting from crony capitalism. In factual terms, Reliance Defence stood to get just over 3 per cent of the Dassault Aviation offsets contract, contrary to the impression that it was to be the biggest beneficiary of the Rafale fighter jet deal.

In a possibly related controversy, one of his businesses partly financed a French film in which former French president Francois Hollande&#x27;s then-partner had acted around the same time the aircraft deal was being negotiated.

<text>Orkney is a gold mining town situated in the Klerksdorp district of the North West province, South Africa. It lies on the banks of the Vaal River approximately 180 km from Johannesburg near the N12 (national road from Johannesburg to George).

==History==
The town was named after the Orkney Isles off the north coast of Scotland, the birthplace of Simon Fraser, one of the gold mining pioneers of the 1880s. The town was proclaimed in 1940 on the farm Witkoppen, where Fraser had first started gold mining.

The town was laid out by another Scot by the name of Maconachie (full name unknown). His naming of the streets was interesting: he used the names of poets and authors from the British Isles. This was unusual for a mining town in the heart of &quot;Afrikanerdom&quot;. The rule was broken as Afrikaner nationalism grew dominant in the 1960s, and some of the British literary names were replaced. 

The 1960 census recorded a total population of 22,425 residents.

The town was near the epicentre of an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.5 on the Richter scale which struck on 5 August 2014, killing one person.

==Tourist attractions==
*Ground Nut Factory
*Harmony Gold Mine

==Sports==
The Oppenheimer Stadium, a large football (soccer) stadium in Orkney, was increased in size for the 2010 Football World Cup, although it was not used in the World Cup. The Orkney Stadium Disaster, when 42 fans died at the stadium in 1991, was the second worst sports disaster in South Africa.

==In the media==

Orkney enjoyed fame in the late 1980s and early 1990s as the setting for a popular Afrikaans television sitcom called &quot;Orkney Snork Nie&quot;. The word &quot;snork&quot; means &quot;snore&quot;: so the joke in the title means &quot;Orkney doesn&#x27;t snore&quot;. Even further back the Afrikaans jab at the sleepy town was &quot;Ook nie dorp nie; ook nie plaas nie&quot;. In this the pun is on the &quot;ook nie&quot; (&quot;also not&quot; or &quot;neither&quot;) sounding like &quot;Orkney&quot;; and the full meaning being &quot;neither town nor farm&quot;.

The notion of &quot;sleepy&quot; is misleading. Some of the deepest and richest gold mines have been worked in the area for decades. But the social life for the youth was better in Klerksdorp.

<doc id="1222317" wikidata="Q636058" url="?curid=1222317" title="Gåte">
<text>(; ) is a band from Trøndelag, Norway playing Norwegian folk music bred with metal and electronica. Their style has been referred to as progressive folk-rock. The band was put together by Sveinung Sundli (violin, keyboards) in 2000 and originally consisted of his younger sister Gunnhild Sundli (vocals), Gjermund Landrø (bass, backing vocals), Martin Langlie (drums) and Magnus Børmark (guitar, keyboards). Langlie was replaced by Kenneth Kapstad in 2004. They represented in the Eurovision Song Contest 2024 with the song &quot;Ulveham&quot;.

== History ==
The band released their first EP, &quot;Gåte EP&quot; in 2000, and rapidly gained popularity. A second EP, also self-titled, was released in 2002. Their first album, &quot;Jygri&quot;, released the same year, proved to be their commercial breakthrough both in Norway and abroad, particularly in Scandinavia and Germany. They also gained a lot of media attention, particularly the distinctive voice of Gunnhild Sundli caught the interest of music journalists, who immediately started to speculate on her departure in order to establish a solo career. After the release of another EP, &quot;Statt opp (Maggeduliadei)&quot; in 2003, and their second album, &quot;Iselilja&quot; in 2004, the band announced that they were taking a break. In their press release, issued September 6, one of the reasons cited was that Gunnhild wanted to devote time to other pursuits. Nevertheless, their record company Warner Music Norway issued a live album, titled &quot;Liva&quot;, in 2006 which had been recorded at the Rockefeller Music Hall the previous year, and with bonus material from their concert at the Roskilde Festival in 2003. Gåte made a comeback in 2017 with the EP &quot;Attersyn&quot;, followed by the album &quot;Svevn&quot; in 2018.

During the first part of their career they toured extensively and played almost every popular music festival in Norway, as well as the major international festival Roskilde Festival in Denmark. The band reunited for one concert in 2009, but then decided to follow this up with a mini-tour of Norway consisting of five concerts in 2010. The fifth concert was held at the roof of the Oslo Opera House, and the band stated that this would be their final farewell. In 2018, they started touring Norway again.

In August 2023, Gåte announced that Sveinung was temporarily leaving the band and would not participate in the upcoming tour.

The band took part in Melodi Grand Prix 2024, the Norwegian selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2024, with the song &quot;Ulveham&quot;. They qualified from their semi-final on 20 January 2024 and ultimately won the final on 3 February 2024.

At Eurovision 2024, Gåte finished 10th in the second semifinal on 9 May, qualifying them for the Grand Final on 11 May, where they finished 25th.

== Song origins ==
Many of Gåte&#x27;s songs are rearranged versions of traditional Norwegian folk tunes, such as &quot;Sjå Attende&quot; (the title translates to &quot;Look Back&quot;), and &quot;Knut Liten og Sylvelin&quot; (&quot;Little-Knut and Sylvelin&quot;). Another main source of Gåte songs are poems by the Norwegian poet Astrid Krog Halse with added music by Sveinung Sundli, such as &quot;Følgje&quot; (&quot;Company&quot;) and &quot;Stengd Dør&quot; (&quot;Closed Door&quot;). Some of their songs were written in Nynorsk/Landsmål and performed in a broad Trøndersk dialect.

On &quot;Svevn&quot;, several songs have lyrics by veteran folk musician Knut Buen, who also wrote the lyrics to &quot;Kjærleik&quot; on &quot;Iselilja&quot;.

<doc id="1222318" wikidata="Q209344" url="?curid=1222318" title="Sapienza University of Rome">
<text>The Sapienza University of Rome (), formally the Università degli Studi di Roma &quot;La Sapienza&quot;, abbreviated simply as Sapienza (&#x27;Wisdom&#x27;), is a public research university located in Rome, Italy. It was founded in 1303 and is as such one of the world&#x27;s oldest universities, and with 122,000 students, it is the largest university in Europe. Due to its size, funding, and numerous laboratories and libraries, Sapienza is a global major education and research centre, first ranked in Southern Europe. The university is located mainly in the &quot;Città Universitaria&quot; (University city), which covers near the monumental cemetery Campo Verano, with different campuses, libraries and laboratories in various locations in Rome.

Sapienza was founded on 20 April 1303 by decree from Pope Boniface VIII as a &quot;Studium&quot; for ecclesiastical studies under more control than the free-standing universities of Bologna and Padua. In 1431 Pope Eugene IV completely reorganized the studium and decreed that the university should expand to include the four schools of Law, Medicine, Philosophy, in addition to the existing Theology. In the 1650s the university became known as &quot;Sapienza&quot;, meaning &quot;wisdom&quot;, a title it still retains. After the capture of Rome by the forces of the Kingdom of Italy in 1870, &quot;La Sapienza&quot; rapidly expanded as the chosen main university of the capital of the newly unified state. In 1935 the new university campus, planned by Marcello Piacentini, was completed.

Sapienza teaches and conducts research in all pure and applied sciences and humanities. It is often considered the best in the world for classics and ancient history. Sapienza houses 50 libraries with over 2.7 million books, most notably the Alessandrina University Library, built in 1667 by Pope Alexander VII, housing 1.5 million volumes. In addition it has 19 museums, a botanical garden, and three university hospitals. Sapienzas alumni includes 10 Nobel laureates, Italian prime ministers, one pope, Presidents of the European Parliament and European Commissioners, as well as several notable religious figures, supreme court judges, and astronauts.

==History==

The Sapienza University of Rome was founded in 1303 with the Papal bull &quot;In Supremae praeminentia Dignitatis&quot;, issued on 20 April 1303 by Pope Boniface VIII, as a &quot;Studium&quot; for ecclesiastical studies more under his control than the universities of Bologna and Padua, making it the first pontifical university.

In 1431 Pope Eugene IV completely reorganized the studium with the bull &quot;In supremae&quot;, in which he granted masters and students alike the broadest possible privileges and decreed that the university should include the four schools of Law, Medicine, Philosophy and Theology. He introduced a new tax on wine to raise funds for the university; the money was used to buy a palace which later housed the Sant&#x27;Ivo alla Sapienza church.

However, the university&#x27;s days of splendour came to an end during the sack of Rome in 1527, when the studium was closed, some of the professors were killed and others dispersed. Pope Paul III restored the university shortly after his election to the pontificate in 1534.

In the 1650s the university became known as Sapienza, meaning wisdom, a title it retains. In 1703, with his private funds, Pope Clement XI purchased some land on the Janiculum, where he created a botanical garden, which soon became the most celebrated in Europe through the labours of the Trionfetti brothers. The first complete history of the Sapienza University was written in 1803–1806 by Filippo Maria Renazzi.

University students were newly animated during the 19th-century Italian revival. In 1870, &quot;La Sapienza&quot; stopped being the papal university and became the university of the capital of Italy. In 1935 the new university campus, planned by Marcello Piacentini, was completed.

On 15 January 2008 the Vatican cancelled a planned visit to La Sapienza University by Pope Benedict XVI who was to speak at the university ceremony launching the 2008 academic year due to protests by some students and professors. The title of the speech would have been &#x27;The Truth Makes Us Good and Goodness is Truth&#x27;. Some students and professors protested in reaction to a 1990 speech that Pope Benedict XVI (then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger) gave in which he, in their opinion, endorsed the actions of the church against Galileo in 1633.

==Campuses==
Sapienza University has many campuses in Rome, but its main campus is the &quot;Città Universitaria&quot; (University city), which covers near the Roma Tiburtina Station. The university has satellite campuses outside Rome, the main one of which is in Latina.

In 2011 a project was launched to build a campus with residence halls near Pietralata station, in collaboration with the Lazio region. To cope with the ever-increasing number of applicants, the Rector also approved a new plan to expand the &quot;Città Universitaria&quot;, reallocate offices and enlarge faculties, as well as create new campuses for hosting local and foreign students.

The Alessandrina University Library (&quot;Biblioteca Universitaria Alessandrina&quot;), built in 1667 by Pope Alexander VII, is the main library housing 1.5 million volumes; it has some important collections including &quot;collezione ciceroniana&quot; and &quot;Fondo Festa&quot;.

===Points of interest===
* Orto Botanico dell&#x27;Università di Roma &quot;La Sapienza&quot;, a botanical garden
* Sant&#x27;Ivo alla Sapienza
* San Pietro in Vincoli: the cloister is part of the Engineering School
* Villa Mirafiori: a Neo-Renaissance palace built during the 19th century, some rooms are decorated with fine frescoes. The Department of Philosophy is located in this building.

==Academics==
Since the 2011 reform, Sapienza University of Rome has eleven faculties and 65 departments. Today Sapienza, with 140,000 students and 8,000 among academic and technical and administrative staff, is the largest university in Italy. The university has significant research programmes in the fields of engineering, natural sciences, biomedical sciences and humanities. It offers 10 Masters Programmes taught entirely in English.

==Ranking==

As of the 2016 &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; (ARWU), Sapienza is positioned within the 151–200 group of universities and among the top 3% of universities in the world.

In 2016, the Center for World University Rankings ranked the Sapienza University of Rome as the 90th in the world and the top in Italy in its &quot;World University Rankings&quot;.

According to the QS Graduate Employability Ranking 2020, Sapienza places first amongst Italian universities in Alumni Outcomes thanks to the number of university graduates employed in large companies and in managerial positions.

In 2024, Sapienza University of Rome ranked 134th in the world in &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot;. Sapienza is ranked 1st in the world by &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; in the subject of Classics and Ancient History. In the same ranking, Sapienza ranks 10th in the subject Archaeology. Sapienza is ranked 36th in the subject Physics &amp; Astronomy, 39th in Arts and Humanities and 70th in Psychology.

==Admission==
To cope with the large demand for admission to the university courses, some faculties hold a series of entrance examinations. The entrance test often decides which candidates will have access to the undergraduate course. For some faculties, the entrance test is only a means through which the administration acknowledges the students&#x27; level of preparation. Students that do not pass the test can still enroll in their chosen degree courses but have to pass an additional exam during their first year.

<text>Hârșova (also spelled &quot;Hîrșova&quot;; ; ; , &quot;Harsovo&quot;) is a town located on the right bank of the Danube, in Constanța County, Northern Dobruja, Romania.

The village of Vadu Oii is administered by the town. The village is linked with Giurgeni commune over the Danube via the Giurgeni-Vadu Oii Bridge.

== Etymology ==
The relationship between the current name of Hârșova and the ancient name of the city, &quot;Carsium&quot; has long been a matter of debate among historians and linguists. According to Iorgu Iordan the ancient name may have been kept under the influence of the Slavic word &quot;Круш&quot;, cliff, rock.

The current name may also derive from the ancient Slavic god Hârs (&quot;Хърс&quot;) and Slavic suffix &quot;-ova&quot; and it is still under debate whether it is in any way linked with the ancient name, or perhaps a common proto-indo-european root related to &quot;ecstasy&quot;/&quot;desire&quot;, ultimately also related to the vedic rta and avestan arta.

== History ==
In ancient times, a Roman settlement grew up on the site of the current town named &quot;Carsium&quot; around the Roman fort of the same name whose remains are still visible on the bank of the Danube. It was initially in Moesia and later in Scythia Minor province.

In 1570 (Hijri 977) the castle town had 69 guards, 71 Muslim households and 84 Christian households and it was a &quot;has&quot; of Mehmet Bey, the mirliva of Silistra.

The Storming of Hirsovo took place in 1773.

In 1853, &quot;The Times&quot; of London reported that &quot;Hirsova&quot;

is defended by a fortified castle, and has a garrison of about 2,000 men. This place was taken by the Russians in 1809 and 1828. Though small, it is of considerable importance from its position on the very spot where the Berchicha returns to the Danube. . . . It is in many parts inundated, but has good pasturage for the excellent horses which constitute the sole wealth of the Tartars who inhabit it.

==Demographics==
At the 2021 census, Hârșova had a population of 8,737; of those, 6,169 were Romanians (70.61%), 6 Hungarians (0.07%), 499 Roma (5.71%), 510 Turks (5.84%), 10 Lipovans (0.11%), 102 others (1.17%), and 1,435 with undeclared ethnicity (16.42%). 

At the 2011 census, the town had 9,642 residents; of those, 7,476 were Romanians (84.47%), 6 Hungarians (0.07%), 490 Roma (5.54%), 829 Turks (9.37%), 9 Tatars (0.10%), 27 Lipovans (0.31%), 4 others (0.05%), and 9 with undeclared ethnicity (0.10%).

<text>Walter Potter Ritchie VC (27 March 1892 – 17 March 1965) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. The award was made for his actions during the Battle of the Somme in the First World War.

==Early life==
Walter Potter Ritchie was born in Glasgow on 27 March 1892, one of six children of Walter Ritchie, an ironworker, and his wife Helen . He was educated at a school in the Cowcaddens area of Glasgow. After completing his schooling he became a blacksmith&#x27;s apprentice but soon enlisted in the British Army, joining the 8th Cameronians despite being underage. He was later transferred to the 2nd Battalion of The Seaforth Highlanders as a drummer.

==First World War==
On the outbreak of the First World War, Ritchie was sent with his unit to France, as part of the 4th Division, British Expeditionary Force. He fought in the Battle of Mons in August 1914 and then in the First Battle of the Aisne the following month. He was wounded in October 1914 near Armentières. The Seaforth Highlanders later moved to the Somme sector, stationed near Mailly-Maillet.

On 1 July 1916, the opening day of the Battle of the Somme, the 4th Division was tasked with capturing the ground to the north of Beaumont Hamel. Its advance was preceded by an artillery barrage and once it ceased, the troops of the division moved forward in a series of waves. Ritchie&#x27;s battalion was part of the second wave. The advance faltered due to heavy machine gun fire and due to the extent of casualties among the officers, some of the British soldiers began falling back. Ritchie, seeing this, climbed to the parapet of a trench and sounded his bugle, which he carried with him, contrary to orders. The bugle call rallied the British soldiers and helped restore order and reverse the withdrawal. After the battle, there were only around 80 survivors from his battalion.

For his actions on 1 July, Ritchie was recommended for the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The citation, published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; read:
Ritchie was presented with his VC by King George V on 25 November 1916 in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. After the VC investiture, he went to Glasgow for a period of leave but declined to talk to friends about his experiences during the VC action. He later received the French Croix de Guerre, which was presented to him by Lieutenant General Sir Aylmer Hunter-Weston in December 1916.

Returning to active duty with the Seaforth Highlanders on the Western Front, his battalion would go on to be involved in several engagements for the remainder of the war, including actions around Arras and the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917 and the Battle of the Lys and the fighting along the Hindenburg Line the following year. By the end of the war, he had been wounded a total of five times, as well as being gassed twice.

==Later life==
Remaining in the British Army after the war, Ritchie was transferred to the 1st Battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders. By this time he was married to Mary and the couple went on to have two children. He was soon promoted to sergeant and served as the battalion&#x27;s drum-major. During the Armistice Day commemorations of 1921, he was part of the VC honour guard for The Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey. He retired from the British Army in 1929 but then remained involved with the military life by working as a recruitment officer in Glasgow. He later worked in the education system.

During the Second World War, Ritchie rejoined the British Army and served with the Royal Army Ordnance Corps on the Home Front until his discharge in 1941, on account of his health. Ritchie died on 17 March 1965 in Edinburgh and his remains were cremated.

==Medals and legacy==
As well as the VC and Croix de Guerre, Ritchie was entitled to the 1914 Star with Mons Clasp, British War Medal and Victory Medal for his First World War service. He also held the 1939-45 Star and War Medal 1939-45 for his service during the Second World War, and was a recipient of coronation medals for two sovereigns, George VI and Elizabeth II, and the George V Silver Jubilee Medal. The medals are no longer in the possession of the family, having been first sold in 1970 and presently owned by an Australian collector. On 1 July 2022, 106 years to the day after Ritchie&#x27;s heroism earned him the Victoria Cross, it was announced that his medals were to be offered at auction by Spink in London. 

The bugle on which he rallied his comrades during the Battle of the Somme is held at the Queen&#x27;s Own Highlanders Museum at Inverness. On 1 July 2016, a hundred years to the day of Ritchie&#x27;s VC action, a centenary paving stone outside the People&#x27;s Palace in Glasgow was unveiled in his memory. Fifty members of his family were present at the ceremony.

On 2 February 1991, she married Anil Ambani, the younger son of Indian business tycoon Dhirubhai Ambani who founded Reliance Industries. They have two sons, Jai Anmol (born in December 1991) and Jai Anshul (born in September 1995). The eldest, Jai Anmol, married Khrisha Shah on 20 February 2022. Munim&#x27;s brother-in-law is Asia&#x27;s richest man, Mukesh Ambani who is the chairman, managing director, and largest shareholder of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).

==Career==

Munim made her debut in Hindi films with filmmaker &quot;Dev Anand&#x27;s&quot; Des Pardes. Her other films with Dev Anand include &quot;Lootmaar&quot;, and &quot;Man Pasand.&quot; She was cast opposite Amol Palekar in Basu Chatterjee&#x27;s &quot;Baaton Baaton Mein.&quot;
 Her notable films with Rishi Kapoor include &quot;Karz&quot;, and &quot;Yeh Vaada Raha&quot;.She starred with actor Rajesh Khanna in many films including &quot;Fiffty Fiffty&quot;, &quot;Souten&quot;, &quot;Bewafai&quot;, &quot;Suraag &quot;, &quot;Insaaf Main Karoonga&quot;, &quot;Rajput&quot;, &quot;Aakhir Kyon?&quot;, &quot;Paapi Pet Ka Sawaal Hai&quot;, &quot;Alag Alag&quot;, &quot;Bhagwaan Dada&quot; and &quot;Adhikar&quot;. Her last film was &quot;Jigarwala,&quot; released in 1991. In an interview to Simi Garewal, Munim said: &quot;Sometimes I feel [that I left films too soon] too, but then I felt that there was a lot more to the world that I wanted to explore and experience, and not just stick to movies. I decided to quit. I never regretted it. I never wanted to go back, ever.&quot;

===Arts and culture===
With the aim to offer young artists a platform to exhibit alongside seasoned veterans and acknowledged masters, she organised the first Harmony Art show in 1995. In 2008, Harmony Art Foundation showcased upcoming Indian artists at Christie&#x27;s in London, drawing attention to the wealth of talent in India. She has served on the board of trustees of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts, which is the oldest continually operating museum in the US since 2008.

In addition, she has served on the advisory board of the National Gallery of Modern Art, Mumbai and the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. She was also nominated to the reconstituted General Assembly of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). She has been actively associated with several welfare activities such as Aseema, an NGO engaged in the rehabilitation of street children, and the restoration of Elephanta Island, a World Heritage Site near Mumbai, with the Archaeological Survey of India and UNESCO.

===Elder welfare===
In 2004, Ambani established Harmony for Silvers Foundation, a Mumbai-based non-government organisation that seeks to enhance the quality of life of the elderly. Its activities have included &quot;Harmony – Celebrate Age&quot;, the magazine, now in its 14th year; the portal www.harmonyindia.org; Harmony Interactive Centre for Silver Citizens, in South Mumbai; the Harmony Research Division; the Harmony Silver Awards; and the Harmony Senior Citizens&#x27; Runs at the Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru marathons.

===Healthcare===
In order to bridge the gaps in Indian healthcare, Ambani launched the Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital &amp; Medical Research Institute (KDAH) in Mumbai in 2009, a quaternary care facility. It is the only hospital in Mumbai to receive accreditation from the JCI (Joint Commission International, USA), NABH (National Accreditation Board for Healthcare, India), CAP (College of American Pathologists, USA) and NABL (National Accreditation Board for Laboratories, India). Other standouts include the first comprehensive centre for liver transplant and the first integrated centre for children&#x27;s cardiac care in western India; its robotic surgery programme; the centres for rehabilitation and sports medicine; and its initiative to open 18 cancer care centres in rural Maharashtra.

<doc id="1222334" wikidata="Q908196" url="?curid=1222334" title="Oxyrhynchus Gospels">
<text>The Oxyrhynchus Gospels are two fragmentary manuscripts discovered among the rich finds of discarded papyri at Oxyrhynchus in Egypt. They throw light on early non-canonical Gospel traditions.

==Oxyrhynchus 840==
Oxyrhynchus 840 (P. Oxy. V 840), found in 1905, is a single small vellum parchment leaf with 45 lines of text written on both sides in a tiny neat hand that dates it to the 4th century, almost square, less than 10 cm across. It is kept at the Bodleian Library, MS. Gr. th. g. 11 (P). The text probably predates 200, but no more is determinable from this evidence. In his introduction in &quot;The Complete Gospels&quot;, Philip Sellew notes that this fragment was likely a talisman text, kept as an amulet, perhaps worn around the neck. Michael J. Kruger, who did his PhD dissertation on this fragment, concludes that this could be not an amulet but a miniature codex. The text itself has been dated to the first half of the second century. Sellew calls it &quot;similar to the New Testament gospels in its style and tone.&quot;

The fragment begins with the end of a warning to an evildoer who plans ahead, yet fails to take the next life into account. There follows sections of a narrative unparalleled in any other known gospel tradition, about Jesus&#x27; encounter with &quot;a Pharisee, a leading priest&quot; who tries to order Jesus and the disciples out of the Temple as ritually unclean. Jesus responds by contrasting ritual cleanliness — gotten by bathing like a harlot in the water used by dogs and pigs — against the life-giving (metaphorical) water that comes down from heaven in baptism.

Jesus is called &quot;&quot; (), which is rare in the New Testament, but not unparalleled. The author of the fragment also believes that laymen have to change their clothes to enter the temple, for which there is no other evidence. The author is distinctly hostile to Judaism, but as he knows little about it, the text is presumably not from Judea; the author&#x27;s vague grasp of details of Temple rituals have suggested a Johannine circle, perhaps in Syria.

==Oxyrhynchus 1224==
Oxyrhynchus 1224 (P. Oxy. X 1224), now at the Bodleian Library, MS. Gr. th. e. 8 (P), consists of two small papyrus fragments from the late 3rd or early 4th century. It contains six passages, each about a sentence. Two of the longer ones are parallel to Mark 2:17 and Luke 9:50, but the differences in phrasing show they are textually independent of the Gospels. A precise date for composition is unknown; 50 is possible, though a date of around 150 AD. is more widely accepted by scholars. John Dominic Crossan notes the mutilated condition in his introduction to the fragmentary text in &quot;The Complete Gospels&quot; resulting in highly conjectural reconstructions of the text, which, however, &quot;does not seem to be dependent on the New Testament gospels... As an independent gospel, it belongs, insofar as its fragmentary state allows us to see, not with discourse gospels involving the risen Jesus (e.g., the &quot;Secret Book of James&quot; and the &quot;Gospel of Mary&quot;), but with sayings gospels involving the earthly Jesus (e.g., Q document and the &quot;Gospel of Thomas&quot;). Crossan suggests that the document might have been written as early as the mid-first century.

<doc id="1222338" wikidata="Q5131396" url="?curid=1222338" title="Clement Robertson">
<text>Clement Robertson (15 December 1890 – 4 October 1917) was a Colony of Natal-born, recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

His posthumous Victoria Cross was the first to be awarded to the Tank Corps.

==Early life==
Clement was the fourth son of Major John Albert Robertson and Frances Octavia Caroline Robertson ( Wynne), of Struan Hill, Delgany in County Wicklow. His father, an officer in the Royal Artillery, was serving in the Colony of Natal when Clement was born at Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, on 15 December 1890. His mother&#x27;s family was from Ireland and Clement grew up in Delgany.

He went to school at Haileybury College (1904–1906) before attending Trinity College Dublin to study engineering. After graduation in 1909, he went to Egypt to work as an engineer on a Nile irrigation project.

==Military career==
On the outbreak of the First World War he returned to England and on 8 October 1914, he enlisted in 19th (Service) Battalion (2nd Public Schools), Royal Fusiliers. He was commissioned in The Queen&#x27;s (Royal West Surrey Regiment) in January 1915. Robertson was attached to the Royal Engineers from June 1916 to February 1917, then to the Heavy Branch, Machine Gun Corps (the Heavy Branch became the Tank Corps).

On 7 June 1917, at the Battle of Messines, his Mark IV tank was hit by a shell, which killed a sergeant and wounded two other crew. Although his tank was badly damaged, he brought it back to base.

He was 26 years old, and an acting captain in the Royal West Surrey Regiment, British Army, attached to A Battalion, Tank Corps during the Battle of Broodseinde when the following deed took place for which he was awarded a Victoria Cross.

On 4 October 1917 at Zonnebeke, Belgium, Robertson was involved in the attack by the 21st Division between Polygon Wood and the Menin Road. The attack was supported by the four tanks of 12 Section, A Battalion, with Robertson as section commander. Robertson and his batman, Cyril Sheldon Allen, had spent the previous three days and nights reconnoitring the ground and marking routes with tape, and, during the attack, he led his tanks into action on foot. Fire from German pillboxes caused heavy casualties as they advanced through the muddy conditions of what had been the stream of the Polygonbeek. With the support of one of the tanks the pillboxes were captured and the higher ground overlooking the Reutel valley was reached by the supporting British infantry.

The citation reads:
As he had not married, his VC was presented to his mother by Brigadier General C. Williams CB at the Royal Barracks, Dublin, on 27 March 1918.

He is &quot;believed to be buried&quot; at Oxford Road Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery, north-east of Ypres, in Plot III, Row F, Grave 7. His headstone bears the Latin inscription &quot;VIRTUTIS GLORIA MERCES&quot;; &quot;glory is the reward of virtue&quot;.

Private Allen, who had accompanied Robertson on foot, was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal; he was killed on 20 November 1917.

==Memorials==
Robertson is also commemorated:
* in his Church of Ireland parish church, Christ Church, at Delgany, County Wicklow
* in Delgany Golf Club; he and his four brothers were founder members of the club and he won the Captain&#x27;s Prize in the first year it was played for, in 1908
* on one of the panels on the walls of the entrance hall of the 1937 Reading Room, Front Square, Trinity College Dublin
* plaque and Royal Tank Regiment flag at Merlijn Restaurant at Reutel Crossroads, Beselare . The restaurant also produces a wine that commemorates him and his remarkable achievements on the battlefield named &quot;Victory&quot;
* bridge over Reutelbeek upgraded to Memorial Status and named &quot;Robertson&#x27;s Bridge&quot; in October 2017
*at Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin; one of four Victoria Cross Commemorative Stones unveiled on Armistice Day 2017 in honour of Irish men who received the VC in the First World War

<text>Puu Kukui is a mountain peak in Hawaii, the highest of the West Maui Mountains (Mauna Kahalawai). The summit rises above the Puu Kukui Watershed Management Area, an private nature preserve maintained by the Maui Land &amp; Pineapple Company. The peak was formed by a volcano whose caldera eroded into what is now the Iao Valley.

Puu Kukui receives an average of of rain a year, making it one of the wettest spots on Earth and third wettest in the state after Big Bog on Maui and Mount Waialeale on Kauai, Rainwater unable to drain away flows into a bog. The soil is dense, deep, and acidic.

Puu Kukui is home to many endemic plants, insects, and birds, including the greensword (&quot;Argyroxiphium grayanum&quot;), a distinctive bog variety of &quot;ōhia lehua&quot; (&quot;Metrosideros polymorpha var. pseudorugosa&quot;) and many &quot;lobelioid&quot; species. Due to the mountain peak&#x27;s extreme climate and acidic peat soil, many species, such as the &quot;ōhia&quot;, are represented as dwarfs. Access to the area is restricted to researchers and conservationists.

<text>The Šventoji (; &quot;The Holy One&quot;) is the longest river that flows entirely within Lithuania and the largest tributary of the Neris. It originates from Lake Samanis in the Gražutė Regional Park and flows into the Neris near Jonava. The longest tributary of the Šventoji is the Širvinta.

The Šventoji passes through the cities of Anykščiai, Kavarskas and Ukmergė. In 1963–1964 a dam near Kavarskas was built to replenish the Nevėžis using water from the Šventoji. However, the dam is no longer used for being too expensive, ineffective, and violating environmental regulations of the European Union. In 1959, the Antalieptė Reservoir, the second largest artificial lake in Lithuania, was built on the Šventoji.

<text>The &quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot;, also known as &quot;Rally &#x27;Round the Flag&quot;, is a song written in 1862 by American composer George Frederick Root (1820–1895) during the American Civil War. A patriotic song advocating the causes of Unionism and abolitionism, it became so popular that composer H. L. Schreiner and lyricist W. H. Barnes adapted it for the Confederacy.

A modified Union version was used as the campaign song for the Lincoln-Johnson ticket in the 1864 presidential election, as well as in elections after the war, such as for Garfield in the 1880 U.S. presidential election. The song was so popular that the music publisher had 14 printing presses going at one time and still could not keep up with demand. It is estimated that over 700,000 copies of this song were put in circulation. Louis Moreau Gottschalk thought so highly of the song that in his diary he confided that he thought &quot;it should be our national anthem&quot; and used it as the basis for his 1863 concert paraphrase for solo piano &quot;Le Cri de délivrance,&quot; opus 55, and dedicated it to Root, who was a personal friend. Charles Ives quoted the song in several compositions, including his own patriotic song, &quot;They Are There&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Battle Cry of Freedom&quot; proved popular among Union soldiers during the American Civil War. According to Henry Stone, a Union war veteran recalling in the late 1880s, the song helped the morale of Union soldiers:

According to historian Christian L. McWhirter, the song&#x27;s success and popularity among the Union was due to its even-handed references to both abolitionism and unionism. Thus, both groups of Unionists, those opposed to slavery and secession, could utilize the song without reservation:

<doc id="1222350" wikidata="Q66269909" url="?curid=1222350" title="Mount Roskill">
<text>Mount Roskill () is a suburban area in the city of Auckland, New Zealand. It is named for the volcanic peak Puketāpapa (commonly called &quot;Mount Roskill&quot; in English).

==Etymology==

The name Mount Roskill was first recorded as Mt Rascal in 1841, on a map created by a Wesleyan missionary, referring to the volcanic peak Puketāpapa. The origin of this name is unclear, however an apocryphal story links the name to a livestock thief from the early colonial era, who allegedly used the peak as a grazing area for stolen sheep and cattle. The peak was variously called Mount Roskill or Mount Kennedy (after landowner Alexander Kennedy). The name Mount Roskill for the peak and the surrounding area likely cemented after 1867, when the local government administering Dominion Road was formed, which took the name Mt Roskill Highway Board. The first uses of Mount Roskill to describe the suburb in newspapers come from the late 1860s.

==Geography and geological history==

The volcanic peak Puketāpapa erupted an estimated 20,000 years ago. The earlier eruption of Ōwairaka / Mount Albert and Puketāpapa blocked the original flow of the Oakley Creek, causing much of the area between the two peaks to become a peaty swamp.

Mount Roskill is located in the south of the Auckland isthmus, approximately seven kilometres to the south of the Auckland city centre. It is surrounded by the neighbouring suburbs of Three Kings, Sandringham, Wesley, Hillsborough and Mount Albert. The Mount Roskill shops are located at the intersection of Mount Albert and Dominion Roads.

==History==
===Early history and colonial era===
The area has been settled by Tāmaki Māori iwi hapū and since at least the 13th century. The Oakley Creek, traditionally known as Te Auaunga, was a crayfish, eels and weka for Tāmaki Māori. Harakeke (New Zealand flax) and raupō, which grew along the banks of the creek, were harvested here to create Māori traditional textiles. By the early 18th century, the area was within the rohe of Waiohua. In this period, Puketāpapa was the site of a fortified pā. After the defeat of Kiwi Tāmaki, the paramount chief of the iwi, the area became part of the rohe of Ngāti Whātua (modern-day Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei). During the early 19th century, the focus of life for Ngāti Whātua was at Onehunga and Māngere, and the Mount Roskill area was used seasonally.

Mount Roskill formed a part of a land sale between Ngāti Whātua and the Crown on 29 June 1841. In 1845, Alexander Kennedy of the Union Bank of Australia, purchased much of the area from the Crown, on-selling this to Joseph May in 1849. The Crown sold further parcels of land to settlers in 1848 and 1849, and the area developed into farmland by the late 19th century. A number of large country estates owned by wealthier families were found in the Mount Roskill farmland, such as Joseph May&#x27;s estate, which was redeveloped into the Akarana Golf Clubhouse. The area was known to early settlers as a good location for raising ducks and geese, and as a source of water for cattle. While the area close to Three Kings in the north had fertile farmland, the southern area of Mount Roskill along the Hillsborough ridge was not as profitable.

In the early 1910s, Mount Roskill became known for its strawberry farms, primarily those operated by William Johnston and Teddy Edwards. After World War I and the return of servicemen, a number of unprofitable strawberry farms were set up in the area, crashing the strawberry market only a decade later. During the 1920s, Chinese New Zealanders Quong Sing and Wong Key developed market gardens at Mount Roskill.

===Suburban development===
Beginning in the 1920s, private housing estates began developing at Mount Roskill. One of the first developments was the Victory Estate, which was constructed around Dominion Road the 1920s. This was followed by the Winstone Estate, which developed at the foot of Puketāpapa from 1932.

In 1930, the Auckland tramway network was extended south along Dominion Road, reaching Mount Albert Road and creating a new terminus, around which a shopping centre developed (now known as the Mount Roskill Town Centre). From 1939, the New Zealand Government began creating large-scale public housing developments in Mount Roskill, as the land at the end of tramways was comparatively cheap to develop. By 1947, 1,085 new houses had been built in the area, a figure which had grown to 2,529 by 1953. Around 600 houses were part of the government&#x27;s development at the Lower Wesley Estate, an area west of Three Kings purchased from the Wesley Trust.

Mount Roskill became a borough in 1947, which meant that Mount Roskill now had a mayor, a local council and were able to invest more into the area. One of the earliest issues faced by the new borough was improving stormwater works for housing around the Oakley Creek, after substantial floods in Wesley in 1948 and 1953. During the 1950s, the suburb became known as the &quot;Bible Belt&quot; of Auckland, due to the area&#x27;s conservative Presbyterian mayor Keith Hay, and because the area had the highest per capita number of churches in New Zealand.

Over time the image of Mount Roskill as a conservative Christian area waned, after a large influx of migrants and refugees into the area. The 2006 film &quot;No. 2&quot;, shot in Mount Roskill, was inspired by director Toa Fraser&#x27;s experiences of growing up in Mount Roskill as a multicultural place.

The area was one of the last in the country to go &quot;wet&quot;, in 1999, having formally been a dry area where the selling of alcohol was prohibited.

In the early 2000s, work began on extending the Southwestern Motorway north of Hillsborough. This led to 120 properties in Mount Roskill being purchased, in order to make way for the new motorway.

==Demographics==
Mount Roskill covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Mount Roskill had a population of 25,743 in the 2023 New Zealand census, a decrease of 825 people (−3.1%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 1,032 people (4.2%) since the 2013 census.

The employment status of those at least 15 was that 10,920 (51.3%) people were employed full-time, 2,577 (12.1%) were part-time, and 726 (3.4%) were unemployed.

== Local government ==

The first local government in the area was the Mt Roskill Highway Board, that formed on 7 August 1868 to administer and fund the roads in the area. In 1883, the Highway Board became the Mt Roskill Road Board. In 1927, Mt Roskill attempted to become a borough separate from the County of Eden, however this was unsuccessful. After growth in the area, Mt Roskill achieved borough status in 1947, meaning the area now had a borough council and mayor, and was able to invest more into infrastructure projects.

Keith Hay was the longest serving mayor of Mount Roskill, holding the role from 1953 until 1974, when Dick Fickling was elected. Fickling resigned mid-term in 1987, and was replaced by Hay&#x27;s son David Hay in 1987. In 1970, Mt Roskill and Onehunga boroughs proposed merging into a single entity, however this merger never eventuated.

In 1989, the borough was amalgamated into Auckland City. On 1 November 2010, the Auckland Council was formed as a unitary authority governing the entire Auckland Region, and Mount Roskill become a part of the Puketāpapa local board area, administered by the Puketāpapa Local Board.

The Puketāpapa local board area forms a part of the Albert-Eden-Puketāpapa ward, which votes for two members of the Auckland Council. The Albert-Eden-Puketāpapa ward is represented by counsellors Christine Fletcher and Julie Fairey.

=== Mayors (1947–1989) ===

<text>William Thomas Rickard, (10 February 1828 – 21 February 1905) was a British sailor and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and Royal Navy==
William Thomas Rickard was born at Stoke Damerel, Devonport, on 10 February 1828, and at an early age joined the Royal Navy.

Rickard was 27 years old, and a quartermaster in the Royal Navy during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 11 October 1855 in the Sea of Azov, Crimea, Quartermaster Rickard went with the commander (John Edmund Commerell) of and a seaman George Milestone to destroy large quantities of forage on the shore of the Sivash. After a difficult and dangerous journey they reached their objective—the magazine of corn—and managed to ignite the stacks, but the guards were alerted and immediately opened fire and gave chase. The pursuit was so hot that the seaman, through fatigue, fell into the mud and could not extricate himself. Rickard, however, although he was himself exhausted, went back and assisted him, even though the enemy were keeping up a heavy fire at the distance of thirty or forty yards, as they crossed the mud. The three men finally reached their ship and later the look-outs reported that the fodder store had burned to the ground.

Commander Commerell was also awarded the VC. Rickard&#x27;s VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

==Later life and family==
After retiring from the navy, Rickard joined the Coastguard as boatman, Chief Boatman and latterly as Chief Officer of Coast Guards, retiring sometime in the 1870s.

In June 1860, Rickard married Rebecca Whitingham of Kingsbridge, and they had four sons and two daughters. In retirement Rickard was boatman to the Ryde Rowing Club in the Isle of Wight and he and his family lived at Arethusa Cottage, Smallbrook, Ryde, named after the frigate on which he first served in the Crimean conflict. He died on 21 February 1905 and is buried in Ryde cemetery.

<text>James Cleland Richardson VC (25 November 1895 – 8/9 October 1916) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Youth, Pre War Life and Enlistment==
James Cleland Richardson was born in Bellshill, Scotland on 25 November 1895 and was one of seven children. His father, David, was a police officer and his mother Mary was a mill worker. At the time of the 1901 UK census the family was living at the police station houses in Blantyre, South Lanarkshire where his father was police sergeant and at the 1911 census, they were based at nearby Rutherglen where his father had risen to the rank of Police Inspector and Fire Chief. As the family moved, James (known as Jimmy) attended school at Bellshill Academy, Auchinraith Public School at Blantyre and John Street School, Bridgeton, Glasgow. He was also a member of the Boy Scouts in Rutherglen. During these years, he learned to play the bagpipes and won several prizes.
&lt;br&gt;Sources vary, but somewhere between 1911 and 1913, when James would have been between 16 and 18 years old, the Richardsons emigrated to Canada, first settling in Vancouver and then Chilliwack, British Columbia, where his father became Chief of Police. James took up work as an apprentice electrician in a factory in the False Creek area of Vancouver. In a precursor of the valour he would later show on the Somme, while at work in 1914 he learned of a youth drowning in a nearby creek and proceeded to run to the scene, dive into the water and bring up the boy, who died despite Richardson&#x27;s efforts. 
&lt;br&gt;In Vancouver, James joined the cadet corps of the 72nd Seaforth Highlanders of Canada and became a Piper in the regiment&#x27;s famous pipe band. At the outbreak of World War I, he voluntarily enlisted and was taken on strength on 23 September 1914 as a private/piper with the Seaforths. His regiment contributed a large draught to 16th (Canadian Scottish) Battalion and were among the first echelons of the Canadian Expeditionary Force sent overseas on October 3, 1914, and after further training in England, the 1st Canadian Division were sent to France on 9 February 1915.

==1915 War Service==
In April 1915, the 1st Canadian Division were placed in a reserve position behind the frontlines near the Belgian city of Ypres as the German Army unleashed a series of poison gas attacks that began the Second Battle of Ypres. On the night of April 22, the opening day of the battle, Richardson&#x27;s 16th, along with the 10th Battalion were moved into the front lines and ordered to counterattack and advance into a position known as Kitcheners&#x27; Wood in the dark of night. In what became known as the Battle of Kitcheners&#x27; Wood, Richardson set out among a group of 50 men who began digging in under enemy fire after advancing about 30 metres. James however continued the advance and discovered a farmhouse in and around which a group of German soldiers had taken cover. In doing so, he was spotted by a German officer who was leading the group and shot him before returning to the position his unit was digging out. There he explained what he had seen to a Sergeant Major who sent the information back to officers behind the lines who then directed artillery onto the position.

==Fighting at the Somme, Earning the Victoria Cross and Death==
In 1916, the 1st Canadian Division were involved in fighting several episodes of the Battle of the Somme. On Oct 8, 1916, in a phase of the action known as the Battle of the Ancre Heights Richardson&#x27;s battalion was pinned down by barbed wire barriers and intense enemy fire during an attack on Regina Trench. The 20-year-old fearlessly encouraged his comrades forward by marching in front of them, playing his bagpipes in the face of the withering enemy fire, inspiring them to get up and continue their attack, which was ultimately successful. Later in the day, James realized he had left his bagpipes at or near the front lines and decided to traverse the battlefield to recover them, however, Richardson never returned and was presumed to have been killed.
&lt;br&gt;For his actions, he was awarded the British Empire&#x27;s highest medal for bravery and valour, the Victoria Cross. The citation given for the awarding of the Victoria Cross, as published in the London Gazette No. 30967, dated October 18, 1918, stated the following:
&quot; For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty when, prior to attack, he obtained permission from his Commanding Officer to play his company &quot;over the top&quot;. &lt;br&gt; As the Company approached the objective, it was held up by very strong wire and came under intense fire, which caused heavy casualties and demoralised the formation for the moment. Realising the situation, Piper Richardson strode up and down outside the wire, playing his pipes with the greatest coolness. The effect was instantaneous. Inspired by his splendid example, the company rushed the wire with such fury and determination that the obstacle was overcome and the position captured.&lt;br&gt; Later, after participating in bombing operations, he was detailed to take back a wounded comrade and prisoners. &lt;br&gt; After proceeding about 200 yards, Piper Richardson remembered that he had left his pipes behind. Although strongly urged not to do so, he insisted on returning to recover his pipes. He has never been seen since, and death has been presumed accordingly owing to lapse of time. &quot;

==Richardson&#x27;s Bagpipes==
Richardson&#x27;s bagpipes were believed to have been lost in the mud of the Somme for almost 90 years until 2002, when the Pipe Major of The Canadian Scottish Regiment (Princess Mary&#x27;s) responded to an Internet posting. He discovered that Ardvreck preparatory school in Crieff (Perthshire, Scotland) had possession of a set of bagpipes with the unique Lennox tartan on them, the same tartan used by the pipers of the 16th (Canadian Scottish) Battalion. 

A British Army Chaplain, Major Edward Yeld Bate, had found the pipes in 1917 and brought them back home after the war to a school in Scotland where he was a teacher. The pipes were unidentified for several decades, and served as a broken, mud-caked, and blood-stained reminder of an unknown piper from the Great War.

Andrew Winstanley of The Canadian Club and Pipe Major Roger McGuire were largely responsible for the investigative work into identifying Richardson&#x27;s pipes. With the support of The Canadian Club and a group of patriotic citizens, Pipe Major McGuire travelled to Scotland in January 2003 to help identify the pipes that had been displayed at Ardvreck School for over seven decades. Tomas Christie, a parent of students there and also a piper, initiated the search for the origin of the pipes.

Their collective effort led to conclusive evidence that identified the pipes as those played by Piper Richardson on that day in 1916. An anonymous donor facilitated the purchase of the pipes on behalf of the citizens of Canada. In October 2006, a party of dignitaries visited Scotland and received the pipes from the Headmaster of Ardvreck School for repatriation to Canada.

On 8 November 2006, the bagpipes were officially repatriated when troops from The Canadian Scottish Regiment (Princess Mary&#x27;s) placed them at the British Columbia Legislature as a reminder of a generation&#x27;s valour. They are currently on public display.

== Burial and memorial ==

After the war, in June 1920, James Richardson&#x27;s body was discovered by a farmer about 300 metres north of the northeast corner of Le Sars village and recovered for burial. He is interred at Adanac Military Cemetery (Plot III, Row F, Grave 36) which is located on the east side of the D107 Road, 1.6 kilometres north of the village of Courcelette, France.

Sculptor John Weaver was commissioned to produce a statue of Richardson, which has been display at the Chilliwack Museum and Archives in Chilliwack since 2003.

Richardson is also commemorated with an inscribed paving stone in Bellshill, Scotland, the town he was born in.

Richardson&#x27;s Victoria Cross and war medals are on display at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Canada.

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel James Henry Reynolds VC (3 February 1844 – 4 March 1932), born Kingstown (Dún Laoghaire), County Dublin, Ireland was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross for his actions at the Battle of Rorke&#x27;s Drift, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was educated at Castleknock College and Trinity College, Dublin.

==Details==

Reynolds was 34 years old, and a Surgeon in the Army Medical Department (later Royal Army Medical Corps), British Army during the Zulu War when the following deed took place on 22/23 January 1879, at Rorke&#x27;s Drift, Natal, South Africa, for which he was awarded the VC:
Surgeon Reynolds also had by his side the whole time during the battle his fox terrier named Dick. Dick never wavered as shots and spears continued falling around them. He only left his side once to bite a Zulu who came too close. Dick was specially mentioned in the citation for &quot;his constant attention to the wounded under the fire where they fell.&quot;

For his conduct in the battle, Reynolds was also promoted to Surgeon-Major (promotion dated 23 January 1879).

The battle was the subject of the 1964 film &quot;Zulu&quot;, with Reynolds portrayed by the actor Patrick Magee.

==His account of the battle==

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Museum of Military Medicine (Aldershot, England).

<text>Major General George Alexander Renny VC (12 May 1825 – 5 January 1887) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Renny was the son of a British merchant settled at Riga on the Baltic Sea. After moving to Scotland as a boy, he was educated at Montrose Academy and Addiscombe Military Seminary.

In June 1844 Renny was commissioned second lieutenant in the Bengal Horse Artillery, taking part in the First Sikh War, including the battle of Sobraon on 10 February 1846. In 1849 he married Flora Hastings MacWhirter, the daughter of Dr John MacWhirter, late President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. They had three sons and three daughters.

==Victoria Cross action==
Renny was 32 years old, and a Lieutenant in the Bengal Horse Artillery, Bengal Army during the Indian Mutiny on 16 September 1857 at siege of Delhi, when the following deed led to the award of the Victoria Cross:

The storming of Delhi took place between 14–16 September 1857, the aim of the British being to dislodge the mutineers and retake the city. When the Delhi Field Force renewed its advance on 16 September, its progress was steady and sustained. Siege guns had been brought into the city and began battering a breach in the repaired walls of the arsenal allowing the 61st Regiment and the Baluchi Battalion to storm the building.

Within the arsenal were no less than 171 guns and howitzers and a large quantity of ammunition. Realising the enormity of their loss, the mutineers mounted a serious counter-attack, covered by musketry fire from the roofs of nearby buildings. They set fire to the thatched roof of a shed containing explosives. With musket balls cracking around him and in imminent danger of being blown apart, Second Lieutenant Edward Thackeray of the Bengal Engineers extinguished the blaze. Simultaneously, Lieutenant George Renny of the Bengal Horse Artillery climbed the arsenal&#x27;s wall and flung several shells with lighted fuses into the midst of the attackers. The carnage caused by the explosion of these put an end to the attack. Both Thackeray and Renny were awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions.

The citation in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 12 April 1859 read:

Delhi, Indian Mutiny, 16 September 1857, Captain George Alexander Renny, Bengal Horse Artillery.&lt;br&gt;Lieutenant-Colonel Farquhar, Commanding the 1st Belooch Regiment, reports that he was in command of the troops stationed in the Delhi magazine, after its capture on 16 September 1857. Early in the forenoon of that day, a vigorous attack was made on the post by the enemy, and was kept up with great force for some time, without the slightest chance of success. Under cover of a heavy cross fire from the high houses on the right flank of the magazine, and from Selinghur and the Palace, the enemy advanced to the high wall of the magazine, and endeavoured to set fire to a thatched roof. The roof was partially set fire to, which was extinguished at the spot by a Sepoy of the Belooch battalion, a soldier of the 61st Regiment having in vain attempted to do so.

The roof having been again set on fire, Captain Renny with great gallantry mounted to the top of the wall of the magazine, and flung several shells with lighted fuzes over into the midst of the enemy, which had an almost immediate effect, as the attack at once became feeble at that point, and soon after ceased there.

George Renny was invested with his Victoria Cross by Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle on 9 November 1860.

==Later life==
After further service during the Indian Mutiny, Renny was promoted to captain in April 1858 and to brevet major in July 1858 for his services at Delhi. Becoming a brevet lieutenant-colonel in June 1867, he commanded a battery of horse artillery during the Hazara and Black Mountain campaign of 1868. He was promoted regimental lieutenant-colonel in August 1871, and brevet colonel in August 1876. He was granted the honorary rank of major general upon retirement in December 1878.

Major-General Renny died at his home in Bath, England on 5 January 1887, aged 61, and is buried in Locksbrook Cemetery. In early 2007 his grave was cleaned and refurbished by T Battery (Shah Sujah&#x27;s Troop) Royal Artillery, successor unit of the Bengal Horse Artillery.

His Victoria Cross is displayed in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery of the Imperial War Museum in London.

<text>LTG Group, officially Lietuvos geležinkeliai (&#x27;), known asLTGis the national state-owned [[railway]] company of [[Lithuania]]. It operates most of the [[Rail transport in Lithuania|railway network in the country]]. It has several subsidiary companies, but the main ones are:LTG Linkwhich provides passenger services,LTG Cargowhich provides freight service, andLTG Infra which is responsible for the maintenance and development of the infrastructure. 

During 2022, Lithuanian Railways transported 4.69 million passengers and 31.0 million tonnes of freight; the majority of freight conveyed comprised oil products and fertilizers.

== History and structure ==

&quot;Lietuvos geležinkeliai&quot; was established in 1991 to operate the railways following the independence restoration. It provides numerous rail-related services, typically through its numerous subsidiary companies. While &quot;LTG Link&quot; is the provider for passenger services, while &quot;LTG Cargo&quot; is responsible for freight operations. Furthermore, another subsidiary, &quot;LTG Infra&quot; undertakes the maintenance and development of the railway infrastructure.

In 2008, in response to the Polish oil company PKN Orlen plans to reroute freight from its Lithuanian refinery at Mažeikiai to the Latvian port of Ventspils, the Lithuanian Railways unilaterally and intentionally dismantled the cross-border line to Latvia to prevent this. In 2017, the European Commission (EC) issued a €27.87 million fine to the Lithuanian Railways for breaching European Union (EU) competition law by the track&#x27;s removal. In 2020, the cross-border line and the freight service was restored at a cost of €9.4m.

In May 2017, Lithuanian Railways was one of several companies that facilitated the launch of a new international tank container train service between Europe and China. In September of that same year, the first electrified cross-border trains started between Lithuania and Belarus. On 29 May 2018, the railway companies of the three Baltic states signed an agreement to launch a new intermodal freight service called &quot;Amber Train&quot;, linking Tallinn and Riga to the Lithuanian-Polish border at Šeštokai where they can be transhipped to the standard gauge network. EU funding was used to support some of these initiatives. During the late 2010s, there was a noticeable uptick in the volume of freight traffic traversing the Lithuanian rail network, along with corresponding increases in revenue.

Between 2018 and 2019, the company&#x27;s Freight Transport, Passenger Transport and Railway Infrastructure Directorates were reorganized into separate companies, comprising &quot;LG CARGO&quot;, &quot;LG Keleiviams&quot;, and &quot;Lietuvos geležinkelių infrastruktura&quot;. The holding company &quot;LTG Group&quot; was also established, it remained a state owned enterprise; any excess profits not reinvested into the organisation is paid out to the Lithuanian government. A new group logo, mirroring the colours of the Lithuanian flag and symbolising movement, was also adopted at this time. During late 2020, the reorganisation was hailed for bolstering the competitiveness of Lithuania&#x27;s railways and maintaining positive growth while also pursuing greater compliance with EU legislation.

One of the more high-profile infrastructure investments being made by LTG Infra in the wider Rail Baltica project, under which a standard gauge high-speed railway will be constructed between the Polish capital of Warsaw and the Estonian capital of Tallinn. The Lithuanian portion of the project involves a 392km line running north–south across the country as well as a new railway node being built in Kaunas to interface with the conventional network. Furthermore, during the late 2010s, a new strategy of widespread railway electrification was announced; specifically, a target for 39% of the Lithuanian rail network being electrified by 2030 was declared, a substantial increase over the 8% that already energised by 2020. Other areas of investment include track doubling, renovated communications, passenger information systems, energy efficiency schemes, routine maintenance, noise reduction, and track renewal programmes. In 2021, investment into key projects was reportedly doubled to €228.9 million, the majority of which was directed to infrastructure-related efforts.

In May 2020, a pilot freight train between Germany and Lithuania was operated under a partnership between LTG Cargo and the German intermodal specialist CargoBeamer. In September of that year, it was announced that LTG Link and the Polish operator PKP Intercity had signed a letter of intent to jointly develop a cross-border intercity passenger service between Vilnius and Warsaw. In March 2021, it was announced that the German specialist IVU Traffic Technologies would supply its digital resource planning and real-time traffic management software to the Lithuanian Railways. That same year, Lithuanian Railways issued multiple tenders calling for the provision of additional electric traction, including hybrid solutions.

In April 2022, LTG Link launched a new ticketing website, displaying more detailed information about services, customer service channels, and travel planning tools; the launch was connected to the introduction of a new smart ticket system that had been promised two years prior. In October 2022, a contract was awarded to ABB to supply 25kV AC electrification apparatus along the 730km line between Vilnius and Klaipėda.

By March 2024, via their software provider, Distribusion, the operator had completed its first integration with Google Maps, providing schedule and ticketing services via the platform.

<text>The Mata Amritanandamayi Math (MAM) is an international charitable organization aimed at the spiritual and material upliftment of humankind. It was founded by Indian spiritual leader and humanitarian Mata Amritanandamayi in 1981, with its headquarters in Paryakadavu, Alappad Panchayat, Kollam district, kerala and is also known as amritpuri

. Along with its sister organization, the Mata Amritanandamayi Mission Trust, MAM conducts charitable work including disaster relief, healthcare for the poor, environmental programs, fighting hunger and scholarships for impoverished students, amongst others. It also runs the seven-campus university known as Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, 90 chain of English medium CBSE schools known as Amrita Vidyalayam, and classes in yoga, meditation and Sanskrit.

MAM is a volunteer organization, basing its activities on the principle of karma yoga (work as an offering to the divine). Its headquarters are home to more than 3,000 people, a mix of householders, monastics and monastic students. People make the pilgrimage to MAM every day in order to receive the blessings of Mata Amritanandamayi.

MAM, along with Amritanandamayi&#x27;s other centers and organizations throughout the world function collectively under the umbrella title of Embracing the World.

== Association with the United Nations ==
On July 24, 2005, in recognition of MAM&#x27;s outstanding disaster-relief work and other humanitarian activities, the United Nations conferred Special Consultative Status to MAM, with its Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), thus enabling collaboration with UN agencies. In December 2008, the UN&#x27;s Department of Public Information approved MAM as an associated nongovernmental organization to help its work of disseminating information and research into humanitarian issues.

== Charitable Activities ==

===Disaster Relief===
Beginning with the 2001, the Mata Amritanandamayi Math has consistently dedicated volunteers and resources in response to disasters within India. Its most extensive disaster-relief program followed the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. In response, MAM provided a value of $46 million in relief, including the construction of 6,200 tsunami-resistant houses in India and Sri Lanka, as well as 700 new fishing boats. It also constructed a multimillion-dollar bridge providing Alappad Panchayat, a tsunami-at-risk peninsula community, an evacuation route to the mainland. MAM has provided a combination of medical care, food, shelter, monetary aid and other forms of relief following the flooding of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in 2009, Bihar in 2008, and Gujarat in 2005 and Bombay in 2005, as well as the Kashmir-Pakistan earthquake of 2005. It also reconstructed 1,200 homes following the 2001 Gujarat earthquake.

In connection with its sister organizations, such as the Mata Amritanandamayi Center in the United States, it also has responded to disasters outside India as well, including medical supplies, blankets and care for orphans following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, a donation of $1 million U.S. to the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund, following Hurricane Katrina, and $1 million U.S. in relief aid to victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, with a focus on children orphaned in the disaster.

===Empowering Women===
MAM&#x27;s Amrita SREE program was launched in 2006, with the goal of aiding 100,000 women through the development of 5,000 self-help groups. As of January 2011, there are more than 6,000 such groups, with more than 100,000 women participating throughout India. MAM has also set up an additional 1,000 self-help groups in Andaman Island. Through providing vocational education, start-up capital, marketing assistance and access to microcredit loans and microsavings accounts, the Amrita SREE program equips unemployed and economically vulnerable women with the skills and means to set up small-scale, cottage-industry businesses. As of January 2011, MAM has helped 3,500 groups to receive microcredit loans to expand their businesses, benefitting more than 60,000 families.
In the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami, India&#x27;s coastal communities found that the aquatic creatures —upon which they relied so heavily for sustenance—had been entirely disrupted. As with so many of their needs, hopes and sorrows, they brought this crisis to Amma. It was then that Amma, who recognized an urgent need for an alternate livelihood for every family in the tsunami-affected areas, launched the Ashram&#x27;s first community-based self-help programmes. It was Amma&#x27;s firm resolve that at least one member in each family engage in a profession that was not reliant upon increasingly unpredictable weather patterns. To that end, Mata Amritanandamayi Math (MAM) facilitated training in the following vocations:

Tailoring: MAM established nine tailoring schools and distributed 2,000 sewing machines—one to every program participant.
Nursing: 450 women were provided free training in nursing assistance along with a stipend to study at AIMS (Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences—MAM&#x27;s super-specialty charitable hospital).
Driving: 500 youths received free driving lessons and received driver&#x27;s licenses to facilitate employment as professional bus, truck and taxi drivers.
Education: Seven eligible women received full scholarships to attend Amrita University Mysore&#x27;s School of Education and earned master&#x27;s degrees in Education.
Handicrafts: 1,500 women trained in making coir (coconut fiber) and coir-based products and over 150 women trained in handloom weaving.
Electronic Repair: 200 youths trained in niche trades including mobile phone and TV/VCR repair; plumbing; fashion design and handmade bag production.

===Plumbing Lessons For Women===
AMMACHI (Amrita Multi-Model Applications using Computer-Human Interaction) labs of Amrita Engineering college has developed a plumbing course administered through simulation and haptic technologies.

===Homes &amp; Slum Renovation===
In 1997 MAM launched its Amrita Kuteeram housing program, an initiative to build 25,000 homes for the homeless throughout India. In 1998, keys to the first 5,000 homes were distributed. The initial target was reached in 2002. Currently MAM is striving to build another 100,000 homes. As of January 2011, more than 40,000 such homes have been constructed. These homes include 1,200 built in order to rebuild three villages following the 2001 Gujarat earthquake and 6,200 built in order to replace homes destroyed by the Indian Ocean tsunami. Amrita Kuteeram homes have thus far been built in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Pondicherry, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andaman Island. Through its sister organization, the Mata Amritanandamayi Center, houses have also been constructed in Sri Lanka. Often Amrita Kuteerams are built not as single homes but as entire villages, complete with town halls, roads, wells, electricity, sewage systems and clean drinking water.

===Community Outreach===
MAM runs a number of programs aimed at the upliftment of the general community. These include Amrita Nidhi, a financial-aid program started in 1998 that provides monthly pensions for 50,000 widows and physically and mentally disadvantaged individuals. The pensions are given for life. It is MAM&#x27;s stated goal to provide 100,000 such pensions.

MAM also runs four homes for the elderly, one in Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu, one in Kottayam, Kerala, and two in Karnataka (Karwar and Bangalore). The care homes include prayer halls where community functions and cultural programs are held on a regular basis.

For the benefit of youth, MAM runs a program called AYUDH, a movement to empower young people to integrate universal values into their daily lives. Members take part in service activities, including caring for the elderly, homeless and physically disadvantaged.

Meditation classes are also offered free to the general public. Monastic disciples and other volunteers teach Mata Amritanandamayi&#x27;s Integrated Amrita Meditation Technique (IAM Technique) throughout the world. The technique is regularly being taught at schools, businesses, and at the request of the Indian government, to the 1.3 million members of India&#x27;s paramilitary.

Other Community Outreach programs include sponsored weddings for impoverished couples, a prisoner&#x27;s welfare project (through MA Center in USA), a seed-distribution program to promote home-grown food, and a hostel for women in Trissur, Kerala.

===Care Homes for Children===
MAM runs two care homes for children. Amrita Niketan is a facility for 500 children in Paripally, Kollam, Kerala. The majority of Amrita Niketan residents are from poor tribal communities. In 2009, through a sister organization known as Amma-Kenya, MAM started an orphanage in Nairobi for 108 children.

===Education for Everyone===
MAM has founded and manages a wide range of educational institutions for the underprivileged and disadvantaged sections of society. These include Amrita Speech &amp; Hearing Improvement School (ASHIS) in Trissur, Kerala; the Amrita Institute for the Differently Abled (AIDA) in Kozhikode, Kerala; adult education classes in Idukki, Kerala, and in Sivakasi, Tamil Nadu; and the Industrial Training Center (ITC) in Karungappally, Kerala. MAM also has runs schools for tribal children in Attappadi and Idukki, Kerala.

Furthermore, MAM is providing 32,000 scholarships to disadvantaged children, many of whom have lost a parent due to suicide or have a parent suffering from AIDS. Known as Vidyamritam, the scholarship program is currently running in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. It was originally started as part of MAM&#x27;s campaign to curb India&#x27;s problem of farmer suicide, by providing children of agricultural families a means to education that will expand their vocational options. It is MAM&#x27;s stated goal to eventually provide 100,000 such scholarships throughout India.

Through Amma-Kenya, MAM runs the Amrita Vocational Training Center in Kenya, equipped with 35 computers.

===Research for a Better World===
Through MAM&#x27;s university, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, volunteer researchers are conducting research and development in disciplines including nanotechnology, biotechnology, robotics and satellite-enabled software solutions. The stated goal behind the research is: &quot;To harness the power of modern technology to provide effect, targeted aid to communities and individuals in crisis.&quot; Projects include a sensor network system for landslide detection, a high-quality low-cost insulin pump for diabetics, a system for early-cancer detection and stem-cell research.

Sakshat Amrita Vocational Education (SAVE) is a program funded by the Government of India&#x27;s e-learning program, Sakshat. SAVE&#x27;s goal is to provide vocational training to remote and impoverished areas through haptic devices. The Department of Biomedical Informatics at SUNY-Buffalo and Arizona State University are collaborating on the project.

Amrita Virtual Interactive E-learning World (AVIEW) is project developed by MAM researchers. AVIEW allows a teacher at one location to connect with students at another place, using Internet and satellite connectivity. Lectures are recorded and can be viewed later. AVIEW was inaugurated by the former President of India Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in 2009.

===Healthcare===
In 1998, MAM opened the Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre (AIMS) in Cochin, Kerala. Most of AIMS&#x27; patients receive subsidized care. The hospital has 1,300 beds and an attached medical college with a 400-bed facility, as well as a 210-bed Intensive Care Facility. Since 1998, AIMS and MAM&#x27;s other charitable medical institutions have treated more than 5.5 million patients.

AIMS has an extensive pain and palliative home-care program, telemedicine facilities and conducts medical camps in remote areas. MAM also runs four other charitable hospitals, including three in Kerala (one in Kalpetta, one in Pampa and one in Amritapuri) and one in Mysore, Karnataka.

MAM also runs an HIV/AIDS Care Center in Trivandrum, Kerala, the Amrita Kripa Sagar Cancer Hospice in Mumbai and the Amrita Health Center in Port Blair, Andaman Island.

===Fighting Hunger===
MAM feeds more than 10 million people every year throughout India, distributing uncooked rice, milk and other staples to remote tribal areas. Outside of India, through sister organizations such as Amma-Europe and the Mata Amritanandamayi Center in the USA, more than 1,000,000 meals to the homeless and hungry are provided annually.

===Green Initiatives===
MAM is a member of the United Nations Billion Tree Campaign and has organized the planting of more than one million trees throughout the world since 2001. MAM also has an international environmental organization to promote environmental awareness called GreenFriends. It also runs a Plastic Project that creates shopping bags, purses, sandals and hats, etc., through the weaving recycled plastic. In 2009, in New York, in the presence of Steven Clark Rockefeller, Amma endorsed the Earth Charter, a declaration of fundamental principles for building a sustainable and peaceful world.

===Public Health===
MAM started the Amala Bharatam Campaign (ABC) in 2010 in order to improve public health and restore India&#x27;s physical beauty. Through ABC, MAM volunteers clean public areas, construct public toilets and spread awareness regarding environmentally friendly ways of disposing of trash.

==Amrita Institutions==
MAM runs a number of other institutions. On the educational front, there is the Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, a seven-campus, multi-disciplinary university and more than 90 Amrita Vidyalayam value-based CBSE high schools across India.

Amritapuri Ashram, MAM&#x27;s headquarters in Kollam District, Kerala, is a spiritual center and international pilgrimage site, where free classes on Vedanta, Sanskrit, meditation and yoga are held. MAM has built and consecrated 20 Brahmasthanam Temples throughout India, and has hundreds of branch centers throughout the country as well. Amrita Kutambam, or Amrita Families, are community groups who come together for the purpose of group prayer and spiritual company.

MAM also publishes dozens of spiritual books and two magazines in various languages.

==Awards==
On February 19, 2010, the President of India Pratibha Patil bestowed the Dharma Khadgam Award to MAM in recognition of its charitable activities. MAM&#x27;s president, Mata Amritanandamayi Devi, has received numerous awards for her role as the founder, inspiration and manager of MAM&#x27;s charitable activities.

<doc id="1222372" wikidata="Q7623023" url="?curid=1222372" title="Street medic">
<text>Street medics, or action medics, are volunteers with a minimum of first aid medical training supplemented by specific protest-related training, who attend protests and demonstrations as support or mutual aid roles to provide medical and wellness care. Unlike emergency medical technicians (EMTs) or paramedics, who have undergone education for professional medical care, street medics usually operate under Good Samaritan clauses and use methods learned through specific protest-medicine training programs which individuals are required to undertake in order to be recognized as a trained street medic.

Street medics may treat trauma injuries, animal attacks, and ailments resulting from crowd control weapons such as chemical agents. They may also provide general care for general well-being, as well as for other critical health events such as heat stress, cold exposure, or seizures. 

== History ==

Street medics originated in the U.S. during the Civil Rights Movement and anti-war movement in the 1960s. They conceived of medicine as self-defense, and provided medical support to the American Indian Movement (AIM), Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW), Young Lords Party, Black Panther Party, and other revolutionary formations of the 1960s and 1970s. Street medics were also involved in free clinics developed by the groups they supported. The street medic pepper spray removal protocol (MOfibA - Mineral Oil followed immediately by Alcohol) was later adopted by the U.S. military. Because the MOfibA protocol can cause severe damage to the patient if done incorrectly, it was largely replaced by the LAW (Liquid Antacid and Water) protocol.

==Interaction with law enforcement==

Due to the nature of the work performed, street medics would inevitably be placed directly in the scene where a conflict between protesters and law enforcement occurs, which could bring potential harm to street medics. As identification, most street medics wear identifications that clearly display a red cross.

While combat medics on battlefields are protected by the First Geneva Convention and must not be attacked while providing first aid, there is no broad agreement about how law enforcement officers should treat street medics.

<text>Cossington is a small farm settlement on Blue Bell Hill north of Maidstone in the English county of Kent.

It is the site of a spring and also the site of a now lost group of sarsen stones thought to possibly be the remains of a Neolithic chambered long barrow and one of the Medway megaliths. The area is very close to the nearby sites of Kit&#x27;s Coty House and the Countless Stones.

Little is known of the stones at Cossington; the lack of available knowledge and antiquarian interest at the site may mean that they may not be megalithic remains but natural periglacial stones. The upstanding stones may have been destroyed in the nineteenth century to provide building stone for the military garrisons at Sheerness and Chatham further downstream in the Medway valley.

In 1980 four stones buried in a pit were found in the area by a local farmer who broke his plough on them. The precise location has not been shared by the archaeologist who excavated them, apparently for fear of treasure hunters.

<text>Mundattuchundayil Paul Scaria (born 5 June 1945), popularly known as Paul Zacharia or Zacharia, is an Indian writer of Malayalam literature. Known for his body of literary works composed of short stories, novellas, travelogues, screenplays, essays, columns and children&#x27;s books, Zacharia is a distinguished fellow of Kerala Sahitya Akademi. He is also a recipient of the Ezhuthachan Puraskaram, Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award and the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award for Story.

== Biography ==

Born M. P. Scaria (Zacharia) on 5 June 1945, in Urulikunnam, near Kottayam, then in Travancore, Zacharia was the youngest of the three children of a farmer named M. S. Paul of the Mundattuchundayil house and his wife, Thresiakutty Paul. His early education was at Sree Dayananda Primary School, a local school in Urulikunnam and later he continued his studies at St Joseph&#x27;s High School, Vilakumadom from where he matriculated in 1960. Subsequently, he completed the pre-University course at St. Thomas College, Palai in 1961 and moved to St. Philomena&#x27;s College, Mysore to earn his bachelor&#x27;s degree in English Literature, History, and Economics in 1964. His post-graduate education was at the Central College of Bangalore and after earning a master&#x27;s degree in English literature in 1966, he started his career as a lecturer of English at MES College, Malleswaram where he worked for a year.

Returning to his home state, Zacharia joined St. Dominic&#x27;s College, Kanjirappally in 1967 as a lecturer and stayed there until his move to Coimbatore in 1971 to take up the position of the area manager of Ruby Tyre and Rubber Works, Bengaluru. His stay in Coimbatore lasted only a year and shifted his base to New Delhi to spend the next two decades there, working with various media and publishing houses such as Affiliated East-West Press, All India Management Association (AIMA), Press Trust of India (PTI) and the Malayalam edition of the India Today. He returned to Kerala in 1993 and was a part of the group that founded Asianet. There, he also co-hosted a show, &quot;Patravisesham&quot;, the first television program review, along with a senior journalist, B. R. P. Bhaskar, which ran for 7 years.

Zacharia lives in Thiruvananthapuram.

==Literary career==
Zacharia has been compared to Jorge Luis Borges as he has limited his creative writing to short stories and novellas. He writes regularly for Kerala&#x27;s leading newspapers and magazines, has been a public speaker for over two decades airing his non-conformist stance in politics, and his writing is marked by humour and unconventional themes. His columns and articles in English have also appeared in national periodicals such as ‘India Today’, ‘Outlook’, ‘The Week’, ‘The Hindu’ ‘Deccan Herald,’ ‘The Pioneer’, ‘The Times of India’ ‘The Economic Times’, ‘The Hindustan Times,’ ‘Tehelka’, ‘The New Indian Express’ and ‘The Indian Express’.

A keen traveller, Zacharia has published travelogues on Africa, England, Saudi Arabia, and China, as well as the Kumbh Mela. In his writing career spanning six decades, he has been the recipient of several awards and honours such as the Kendra Sahitya Akademi (Indian Academy of Literature) Award and Kerala Sahitya Akademi (Kerala Academy of Literature) Award. In November 2013 he was elected a Distinguished Fellow of the Kerala Sahitya Akademi.

Paul Zacharia is a member of the Press Club of India, New Delhi and Thiruvananthapuram Club, Thiruvananthapuram. He lives in Thiruvananthapuram, and is married to Lalitha. They have a daughter and a son.

<doc id="1222394" wikidata="Q742714" url="?curid=1222394" title="Māngere">
<text>Māngere () is a major suburb in South Auckland, New Zealand, located on mainly flat land on the northeastern shore of the Manukau Harbour, to the northwest of Manukau City Centre and south of the Auckland city centre. It is the location of Auckland Airport, which lies close to the harbour&#x27;s edge to the south of the suburb.

The area has been inhabited by Tāmaki Māori since early periods of Māori history, including large-scale agricultural stonefields, such as Ihumātao, and Māngere Mountain, which was home to a fortified pā. Te Ākitai Waiohua communities in Māngere thrived in the 1840s and 1850s after the establishment of a Wesleyan Mission and extensive wheat farms, until the Invasion of the Waikato in 1863. Māngere remained a rural community until the mid-20th Century, when Māngere became one of the largest state housing developments in Auckland.

==Etymology==

The name Māngere is a shortened form of the Māori language name Ngā Hau Māngere, a name given to the area by Taikehu, one of the rangatira of the &quot;Tainui&quot; canoe, referring to the gentle breezes in the area. The spelling of the area was inconsistent in English in the 19th century, with Māngere variously spelt Mangere, Mangerei or Mangare. The spelling Mangere became more consistently used after 1897, when the post office began using this spelling. In 2019, the name of the suburb was officially gazetted as Māngere, with a macron.

Central Māngere was traditionally known by the name Taotaoroa, or &quot;The Extensive Plains&quot;.

Māngere is a peninsula of the Manukau Harbour, south of the Auckland isthmus. Many features of the Auckland volcanic field can be found around Māngere, most visibly Māngere Mountain, an 106-metre volcanic cone to the north-west. The oldest known feature is the Boggust Park Crater, which erupted an estimated 130,000 years ago, while the most recent feature is Waitomokia, which erupted around 20,300 years before the present. The low-lying volcanic features of the area, such as the Māngere Lagoon, Crater Hill, and Pukaki Lagoon were collectively known by the name Nga Tapuwae a Mataoho (&quot;The Sacred Footprints of Mataoho&quot;) to Tāmaki Māori peoples, referring to the deity who was involved in their creation.

A number of waterways are found in the area, including the Tararata Creek and Harania Creek which drain into the Māngere Inlet in the north, and Pukaki Creek and Waokauri Creek in the south.

==History==

===Māori history===
The first evidence of Tāmaki Māori in the coastal Māngere area comes from the 14th century, with evidence of the first settlements later in the 15th century. Pukaki Creek formed an important part of the Waokauri / Pūkaki portage, connecting the Manukau Harbour and Tāmaki River via Papatoetoe, and was often used by Tāmaki Māori to avoid the Te Tō Waka and Karetu portages, controlled by the people who lived at Ōtāhuhu / Mount Richmond. Much of the coastal Manukau Harbour area was farmed using Polynesian stonefield agricultural techniques, such as the Ōtuataua Stonefields at Ihumātao.

In the early 18th century, Te Pane o Mataaho / Māngere Mountain was a major pā for the Waiohua, a confederacy of Tāmaki Māori iwi. The mountain complex may have been home to thousands of people, with the mountain acting as a central place for rua (food storage pits). Paramount chief Kiwi Tāmaki stayed at Māngere seasonally, when it was the time of year to hunt sharks in the Manukau Harbour. The southern slopes of Te Pane o Mataaho / Māngere Mountain were known as Taotaoroa, an extensive garden that sat between wetlands, and fed by the waters of three streams: Te Ararata (Tararata Creek), the Harania Creek and the Ōtaki Creek, a tributary of the Tāmaki River.

In the early 1740s, Kiwi Tāmaki was slain in battle by the Te Taoū hapū of Ngāti Whātua. After the battle, most Waiohua fled the region, although many of the remaining Waiohua warriors regrouped at Te Pane o Mataaho. The warriors strew pipi shells around the base of the mountain to warn against attacks, but Te Taoū warriors covered the pipi shells with dogskin cloaks to muffle the sound, and raided the pā at dawn. An alternate name for the mountain, Te Ara Pueru (&quot;the dogskin cloak path&quot;), references this event.

After the events of this war, Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei, a hapū created by the members of Te Taoū who remained near the Tāmaki isthmus, who intermarried with defeated members of Waiohua, settled the region. Originally the iwi were based on Maungakiekie / One Tree Hill, but after the death of paramount chief Tūperiri (circa 1795), the Māngere Bridge area and Onehunga became permanent kāinga (settlements) for Ngāti Whātua. The location was chosen because of the good quality soils for gardening, resources from the Manukau Harbour, and the area acting as a junction for surrounding trade routes. Māngere-Onehunga remained the principal residence of Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei until the 1840s, before the iwi moved to Ōrākei.

When the Waiohua people began to re-establish themselves in the Tāmaki Makaurau area in the latter 18th century, most settled around the Manukau Harbour and South Auckland. A major iwi who formed in the area from these people was Te Ākitai Waiohua. By the 19th Century, most Tāmaki Māori peoples moved away from fortified pā and favoured kāinga closer to resources and transport routes. A kāinga called Te Ararata was found near modern central Māngere along the banks of the Tararata Creek, and the central Māngere area was used as an area for growing food, medicine and plants for weaving.

In the 1820s and early 1830s, the threat of Ngāpuhi raiders from the north during the Musket Wars caused most of the Tāmaki Makaurau area to become deserted. During this period, a peace accord between Ngāpuhi and Waikato Tainui was reached through the marriage of Matire Toha, daughter of Ngāpuhi chief Rewa was married to Kati Takiwaru, the younger brother of Tainui chief Pōtatau Te Wherowhero, and they settled together on the slopes of Māngere Mountain. Ngāti Whātua returned to the Māngere-Onehunga area by the mid-1830s, re-establishing a pā on Māngere Mountain called Whakarongo.

===Colonial period and land confiscation===
In January 1836 missionary William Thomas Fairburn brokered a land sale between Tāmaki Māori chiefs, Pōtatau Te Wherowhero and Turia of Ngāti Te Rau, covering the majority of modern-day South Auckland between Ōtāhuhu and Papakura. The sale was envisioned as a way to end hostilities in the area, but it is unclear what the chiefs understood or consented to. Māori continued to live in South Auckland, unchanged by this sale. Fairburn was criticised for the sheer size of the purchase, and in 1842 the Crown significantly reduced the size of his land holdings, and the Crown partitioned much of the land for European settlers.

On 20 March 1840, Ngāti Whātua chief Apihai Te Kawau signed the Treaty of Waitangi at Orua Bay on the Manukau Harbour, inviting Lieutenant-Governor William Hobson to settle in Auckland, hoping this would protect the land and people living in Auckland. In the winter of 1840, Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei moved the majority of the iwi to the Waitematā Harbour, with most iwi members resettling to the Remuera-Ōrākei area, closer to the new European settlement at Waihorotiu (modern-day Auckland CBD). A smaller Ngāti Whātua presence remained at Māngere-Onehunga, as well as members of Te Uringutu, and the western banks of the Waokauri Creek were reserved by the Crown as a native settlement in the 1850s, around the Te Ākitai Waiohua kāinga.

In the late 1840s, a Wesleyan Mission was established at Ihumātao. The area flourished as a farming area primarily for wheat and oat crops, which were processed at a mill at Ihumātao. Until the 1860s, the Māori population of the Manukau Harbour and Waikato areas produced goods to sell or barter at the port of Onehunga. During this period, the Māori population of Māngere was significantly larger than the European population.

On 9 July 1863, due to fears of the Māori King Movement, Governor Grey proclaimed that all Māori living in the South Auckland area needed to swear loyalty to the Queen and give up their weapons. Most people refused due to strong links to Tainui, leaving for the south before the Government&#x27;s Invasion of the Waikato. Six men remained in the Māngere area, in order to tend to the farms and for ahi kā (land rights through continued occupation). Lieutenant-Colonel Marmaduke Nixon, who settled on the shores of Pukaki Creek in the 1850s, arrested his neighbour, the Te Ākitai Waiohua rangatira Ihaka Takanini, who later died on Rakino Island.

European settlers continued to live in the area, often looting the abandoned settlements. In 1867, the Native Compensation Court returned 144 of the original 485 acres that had been seized by the crown. The remaining land was kept by the crown as reserves, or sold on to British immigrant farmers. Te Ākitai Waiohua began returning to the area in 1866, settling to the west of Pukaki Creek and at Ihumātao.

===Farming community===
In 1862, the first local government was established in the area, with the formation of the Mangerei Highway Board. The first school, Mangere Central School, opened in 1859, and churches were built in central Māngere in 1874 and 1894. Māngere had become known as a wheat-producing area, and by the 1880s became known for dairy farming. In October 1887, Ambury and English Ltd opened a dairy factory in the area, supplying milk from the dairy farms (which includes modern day Ambury Regional Park, and farms along Wallace Road and Creamery Road) to their stores on Karangahape Road and Ponsonby Road. The creamery closed in 1937, and in 1943 operations were sold to the New Zealand Co-operative Dairy Company. By 1915, Chinese New Zealand market garden were established around Māngere.

The Māngere area was primarily rural for the first half of the 20th century, except for the Māngere Bridge area, where the first suburban housing developed in 1875 after the construction of the first Māngere Bridge. Māngere East began to develop as a suburban area after the opening of the Otahuhu Railway Workshops in the late 1920s. The Pukaki Lagoon was drained and used as a speedway from 1928 until World War II, and by the 1950s Croatian immigrant Andrew Fistonich established the first vineyards in the area, which later grew to become Villa Maria Estates.

In the 1950s, Chinese New Zealand gardeners Fay Gock and Joe Gock began cultivating kūmara (sweet potatoes) at their farm beside Pukaki Creek, using plants donated to them by their neighbours at Pūkaki Marae. The Gocks developed a disease-resistant variety of kūmara that became the modern Owairaka Red variety.

===State housing and suburban development===
In 1958, the Mangere Aerodrome was chosen by the New Zealand Government as the site of a new purpose-built airport, to replace the RNZAF Base Auckland at Whenuapai served as the civilian airport for Auckland. The Auckland Airport opened in 1966. In 1962, central Māngere was chosen as a location for a large-scale state housing development. This followed Glen Innes and Ōtara as the third large-scale state housing development in Auckland aimed a low-income families, centred around a retail and community centre. By the 1980s, central Māngere had become one of the more economically deprived areas in New Zealand. By the early 2000s, Māngere had become a multicultural area of Auckland.

In 1997, State Highway 20 (commonly known as the Southwestern Motorway) extended south to Massey Road. The entire Western Ring Route project, connecting the Northwestern Motorway to the Southern Motorway was completed in 2017. In the 2010s, discussions began to create a light rail connection between the Auckland city centre to Māngere. After the 2023 New Zealand general election, plans for light rail to Māngere were placed on hold.

<text>Great Tottington is a moated manor farm near Maidstone in the English county of Kent. It is also the site of a spring, around which are scattered numerous sarsen stones which may be the remains of a Neolithic monument and part of the Medway megaliths. Further stones lie around the farmyard. Rather than being genuine megaliths, they may be a recent collection of natural stones brought to the site by eighteenth century farmers clearing the surrounding land. The destruction visited on the megalithic sites of the Medway valley during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries makes conclusive diagnosis difficult.

In 1872 James Fergusson visited the area and noted:

A footnote records that one stone was almost completely underground, and the other partially buried, and that the dimensions were obtained by probing underground.

Theories that the stones are the remains of a stone circle or avenue have been suggested. If the stones are prehistoric however, it is more likely that they were brought from the nearby site of the chambered long barrow known as the Coffin Stone.

<text>Shanghai Surprise is a 1986 adventure comedy film directed by Jim Goddard and starring then-newlyweds Sean Penn and Madonna. The screenplay was adapted by John Kohn and Robert Bentley from Tony Kenrick&#x27;s 1978 novel &quot;Faraday&#x27;s Flowers&quot;. Produced by George Harrison&#x27;s HandMade Films and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Harrison himself appears in the film as a night club singer, and he wrote and recorded five original songs for the soundtrack: &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot;, &quot;Someplace Else&quot;, &quot;Breath Away from Heaven&quot;, &quot;Zig Zag&quot;, and &quot;Hottest Gong in Town&quot;. The film was a critical and commercial failure, and an official soundtrack album was never released.

==Plot summary==
Glendon Wasey is a sleazy, down-on-his-luck con man struggling to sell glow-in-the-dark neckties in Shanghai. When he encounters the lovely Gloria Tatlock, a missionary nurse who wants to obtain a supply of opium to ease the suffering of her patients, he decides to help her get hold of a stolen supply of the valuable drug. The only problem is that a lot of other people want to secure the stolen opium as well—gangsters, smugglers, thugs and a host of upstanding air force recruits.

==Cast==
==Production==
In November 1985 it was announced Madonna and then newlywed husband Sean Penn had signed to do &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot; with principal photography set to begin in Macau and Hong Kong by January 1986. Due to the high profile status of the stars real life relationship, by the second day of filming the production of the film was often inundated with photographers to the point Penn demanded the film&#x27;s publicist be fired and replaced. According to co-star Richard Griffiths, &quot;&quot;Sean Penn always had an ace of trumps up his sleeve. He&#x27;d play his ace of trumps, win the trick and then put it back up his sleeve and then when the next drama was played, he&#x27;d pull out his ace of trumps again. And the ace of trumps was this: in Madonna&#x27;s contract, and Penn was very sore about this because he saw himself as the star of the movie, there was a clause and it said Madonna shall have the casting approval of her leading man. In other words,&quot; if you don&#x27;t do what I say&quot;, says Sean Penn,&quot; I quit and, if I quit, she won&#x27;t agree with any other guy playing my part because, hey, she&#x27;s my wife, and you don&#x27;t have a movie, so go and f*ck yourselves. Do as I say or I&#x27;m out of here. &quot;Boy, did he know how to manipulate that situation with Madonna&quot;.&quot;

The press frenzy led Madonna and Penn to isolate themselves from the production when not on set, which created tension with the crew. “Sean and Madonna weren’t being very nice to the crew,&quot; George Harrison later explained. &quot;It’s hard work, dragging equipment round places where it’s freezing cold for hours - and, while she’s in a warm trailer, they’re trying to drink a cup of tea to keep warm, and a little ‘Hello, good morning, how are you?’ goes a long way under those circumstances.&quot; Their discontent led some crew members to spread gossip to the tabloid reporters on the scene, further inflaming the hostility between the press and the stars.

Harrison even reluctantly flew to Hong Kong to try and smooth things over between the cast, crew, and press. Jim Goddard&#x27;s initial cut of the film was rejected by executives at MGM, and Goddard’s attempts to find alternative distribution were fruitless resulting in his return to MGM. Prior to release both Madonna and Penn attempted to distance themselves from the film with the two insisting their likenesses be removed from the tie-in novel from Viking Press a few days before it was set to hit printers.

==Marketing==
&quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot; debuted following a &quot;great deal of hype and promotion&quot; in the United Kingdom, including being hyped on the music television programme &quot;The Tube&quot;. In the United States, however, as &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; reported in October 1986, &quot;The movie opened so poorly in its first wave of playdates (late August in the Northeast and Midwest) that MGM has made severe cuts in its marketing budget. One MGM exec was quoted in the trades as saying this was necessary because &#x27;the interest in the film has been non-existent.&#x27;&quot;

==Soundtrack==
While an official soundtrack album for the film was never released, the title track was issued as a promotional single in 1986, new versions of both &quot;Breath Away from Heaven&quot; and &quot;Someplace Else&quot; were recorded for inclusion on Harrison&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;, an alternate mix of &quot;Zig Zag&quot; (with the notable addition of backing vocals) was released as the B-side of Harrison&#x27;s &quot;When We Was Fab&quot; single in early 1988, and &quot;Hottest Gong in Town&quot; was included on the EP that came with the 1992 book &quot;Songs by George Harrison 2&quot;. The title song and the single mix of &quot;Zig Zag&quot; were also added to the 2004 re-release of &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; as &quot;additional tracks&quot;.

==Critical reception==
The film received mixed critical response during its pre-release. &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot; currently holds a 20% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 10 reviews, indicating generally negative responses.

Bill Cosford of &quot;The Miami Herald&quot;, granting it 1 star out of 4, wrote, &quot;In &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot;, as you may have heard, almost everything is just a bit off. Though widely anticipated as a musical, &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot; is actually a kind of miniaturization of &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; / &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, with a feisty heroine (Madonna) in the vain [sic] of Rita Hayworth in &quot;The Lady From Shanghai&quot;, and a roguish adventure hero (Sean Penn) as well as a pop-sprinkled score (partly the work of George Harrison)... There&#x27;s a plot here, involving Madonna&#x27;s quest to find a load of hijacked opium for conversion to morphine to help the troops fighting the Japanese. Penn, though he spends his big scene panting in a brothel, will save the day. But the film was conceived and executed as a star vehicle. Wrong stars, wrong roles, not much happening here. And for George Harrison and his Handmade Films, the first big bust.&quot; &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; also gave it only 1 star: &quot;&quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot; is so dismally scripted and directed that no one could redeem it... an atmospheric, handsomely shot and, sadly, utterly empty piece of work.&quot; The &quot;Lexington Herald-Leader&quot; called it &quot;a turkey&quot;: &quot;This film is bad. The acting is terrible. The hackneyed screenplay traffics in stereotype and yuk-yuk jokes. And the point is non-existent.&quot; The &quot;San Diego Union&quot; said, &quot;In its campy nostalgia for old adventure films, &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot; is cloddish. There&#x27;s something rotten at the core about a movie that would recycle lines like &quot;That&#x27;s mighty white of you.&quot; Even sadder is the realization that some of the old cornball movies are still fresher, more alive, than this regurgitation.&quot;

The &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; faulted the casting as well as the script: &quot;The ever-important spirit is missing as Mr. and Mrs. Penn wrestle with old gags that are beyond their ken. It&#x27;s not entirely their fault though: They&#x27;ve been given no characters to play. Much of &quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot; might have worked if they at least were permitted to play themselves — a punk rocker and punk actor at large in an alien movie world.&quot; The &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, awarding the movie half a star, complained of its &quot;warped attitudes toward women,&quot; adding, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to know for whom this wretch of a film was made. Idiotic dialogue should turn off the adults, teens will be disappointed by their rock heroine and kids shouldn&#x27;t even be watching.&quot; Film professor Michal Conford, of Ryerson University, reviewed the film for the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; with another half-star rating, saying sardonically, &quot;&quot;Shanghai Surprise&quot; stars Madonna and Sean Penn together for the first time and has songs by George Harrison. That is the most positive sentence that can be written about the film, now playing locally. MGM must have suspected – the company tried to open the film in places like Iowa to avoid getting slaughtered. Nice try... The film is supposed to be a shaggy dog adventure... Shaggy, no. Dog, yes.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
==Home media==
The home video was released by Vestron Video. The company paid $5 million for distribution rights. The VHS debuted on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Videocassette Sales at number 28 and peaked at number 25 in the issue dated April 4, 1987. With a retail price of $79.98, the videocassette sold only 100,000 copies in the United States as of 1987, causing Vestron a $1 million loss.

<text>Teresa (also Theresa, Therese; ) is a feminine given name. 

It originates in the Iberian Peninsula in late antiquity. Its derivation is uncertain, it may be derived from Greek θερίζω (&quot;therízō&quot;) &quot;to harvest or reap&quot;, or from θέρος (&quot;theros&quot;) &quot;summer&quot;. Another origin of the name is from Latin word &quot;Terra&quot; which means earth.
Terra mother Earth. It is first recorded in the form &quot;Therasia&quot;, the name of Therasia of Nola, an aristocrat of the 4th century.
Its popularity outside of Iberia increased because of saint Teresa of Ávila, and more recently Thérèse of Lisieux and Mother Teresa.

In the United States it was ranked as the 852nd most popular name for girls born in 2008, down from 226th in 1992 (it ranked 65th in 1950, and 102nd in 1900). Spelled &quot;Teresa,&quot; it was the 580th most popular name for girls born in 2008, down from 206th in 1992 (it ranked 81st in 1950, and 220th in 1900).

<text>Mindaugas Gervaldas (né Murza; born 16 December, 1973) is a Lithuanian radical nationalist and a Neo-Nazi. He was a member of the Lithuanian National Defence Volunteer Forces (a Lithuanian government-sponsored paramilitary organization). He has been a member, founder, and chairman of several different Neo-Nazi political parties. Only one party, the National Democratic Party of Lithuania, was officially registered and participated in the 2003 municipal elections. Murza and three others were elected to the council of the Šiauliai City Municipality.

==Political ventures==
In 1993, members of the Lithuanian National Defence Volunteer Forces (SKAT) founded the underground Lithuanian National Independence Union ( or LNNS). Murza, then a SKAT sergeant, became leader of LNNS in December 1993. The organization established a combat group and sought to collect weapons for about 30 men who would be &quot;efficient fighters&quot; and &quot;not afraid to die&quot;. Murza&#x27;s home was searched in 1995 and in February 1996 he was sentenced to 18 months of correctional labor without imprisonment for illegal possession of small caliber ammunition.

In November 1996, Murza became chairman of the newly established Lithuanian Alliance of Nationalist-Socialist Unity ( or LNSVS). It was the first Neo-Nazi organization in Lithuania. In 1998, Murza and other members of LNSVS in their publications &quot;Voice of the Nation&quot; () attacked Lithuania&#x27;s minorities of Jews, Poles and Russians, and demanded that conditions for these minorities be made so unbearable so that they would leave Lithuania. In total, 17 issues of &quot;Voice of the Nation&quot; were published. LNSVS attempted to register as a political party twice and as a non-governmental organization ten times, but was rejected by the Ministry of Justice due to its propagation of hate. In October 1999, LNSVS was reorganized into the Lithuanian National Labor Union ( or LTDS). It was officially registered not as a political party but as a non-governmental organization.

Murza continued to search for ways to legalize his political activities. In May 2000, Murza became chairman of the newly established Lithuanian National Socialist Party ( or LNSP). In 2001, he attempted to revive the moribund Life Logic Party of Lithuania () when the registration for LNSP was refused. In May 2001, LNSP merged into the legal National Democratic Party of Lithuania ( or LNDP) then chaired by Kazimieras Uoka. It was a moderately nationalist party with no great political prospects that was the first to adopt Euroscepticism as its platform. Murza became chairman of LNSP. Murza and three other members of LNSP were elected to the council of the Šiauliai City Municipality in the 2003 municipal elections. Another member of LNSP was elected to the council of the Alytus City Municipality.

In April 2005, Murza presented plans to establish a new political party, the ( or VLNDS). At the meeting of the new party, Murza made openly anti-Semitic statements calling Jews &quot;the most cruel and crafty enemy of the European race&quot; which led to Lithuanian prosecutors launching an investigation against him for preaching hatred. Murza resigned from LNDP in December 2006 and established VLNDS in February 2007. VLNDS adopted a stylized swastika as its symbol and openly promoted the Neo-Nazi platform – anti-Semitism, anti-immigration, anti-gay rights.

In March 2011, Murza established a new party, the ( or LITAS). In 2012, Murza officially changed his last name to Gervaldas (from &quot;geras&quot; [good] and &quot;valdyti&quot; [to rule]). It describes the new ideal political system that was added to the political program of VLNDS. In 2014, Murza organized a 19-member Public Electoral Committee &quot;Against Corruption&quot; that ran in the municipal elections in the Šiauliai City Municipality and received only 324 votes.

Murza and his supporters organize various small protests. In 2001, he organized a protest against mayor of Šiauliai without a permit. When he refused to pay the fine, his car (Volkswagen Golf) was confiscated by the government. In November 2006, Murza and six others were found guilty of interrupting a religious ceremony when they harassed Jews lighting a menorah in December 2003. Murza was fined 5,000 litas. In 2010, Murza participated in a protest against the Baltic Pride parade in Vilnius.

==Personal life==
On 19 November 2011, he married Russian citizen Zlata Rapova who claims to be a descendant of Count Jean Rapp, French general during the Napoleonic Wars. The marriage ceremony was conducted according to neo-pagan traditions.

<doc id="1222427" wikidata="Q8179618" url="?curid=1222427" title="6th South African Armoured Division">
<text>The 6th South African Armoured Division was the second armoured division of the South African Army and was formed during World War II. Established in early 1943, it was based on a nucleus of men from the former 1st South African Infantry Division who had returned to South Africa after the Second Battle of El Alamein in late 1942. The division was initially transferred to Egypt for training, after which it served in the Allied campaign in Italy during 1944 and 1945. In Italy, the division was initially deployed as part of the British Eighth Army, under command of Lieutenant-General Oliver Leese, and was then transferred to the U.S. Fifth Army, under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, for the remainder of the Italian Campaign. The division operated as a strongly reinforced division and was frequently used to spearhead the advance of the Corps and Army to which it was attached. They returned home after the end of the war in Italy and were disbanded in 1946. The division was also briefly active after the war from 1 July 1948 to 1 November 1949.
==Founding==
The possibility of forming a South African armoured division was discussed as early as April 1941 between Major-General George Brink, Commander of the 1st South African Infantry Division and Prime Minister (Field Marshal) Smuts. At this time, South Africa was struggling to maintain the manpower levels needed to sustain two infantry divisions in the field. The 3rd Division was based in South Africa and was to provide the pool from which reinforcements were drawn to supplement the 1st and 2nd Divisions. All South Africans serving outside of South Africa were volunteers and far fewer men than expected volunteered their services and the view was held that if this trend continued, it would be necessary to convert one infantry division to an armoured division, as an armoured division would require fewer men. Later, the vision was to establish two armoured divisions, as lower manpower levels became more pronounced.

After the Second Battle of El Alamein, the 1st Infantry Division was withdrawn to Quassasin with the understanding that its 1st Brigade would return to South Africa to regroup with the 7th Infantry Brigade (at this time the 7th Infantry Brigade was in Madagascar) to form the 1st South African Armoured Division. 1st Infantry Division&#x27;s 2nd and 3rd Brigades would remain in Egypt to form the 6th South African Armoured Division which would replace the 2nd Infantry Division which had been captured at Tobruk in June 1942.

By January 1943, the Allied leaders had decided at the Casablanca Conference to pursue the war by invading Sicily, reducing the need for the number of armoured divisions as compared to those needed in the Western Desert. This, together with further manpower shortages led to the plans for a 1st South African Armoured Division being abandoned, with only the 6th Division being considered viable. All of the 1st South African Infantry Division brigades were returned to South Africa for re-training and amalgamation with other units to form the nucleus of the armoured division. The division was officially formed in South Africa on 1 February 1943 with Major-General W.H.E. Poole as commander and sailed for Port Tewfik in Suez on 30 April 1943 as a two brigade division, comprising 11th Armoured Brigade and 12th Motorised Brigade.

==Egypt==
Training began in the desert at Khataba, north west of Cairo and was focused on tank operations and integrating the Rhodesian elements into the division. In addition, the lack of manpower had forced the merging of numerous units and much of the training time was spent on marrying up drills between the new composite units. The period of training was finally concluded by a series of training exercises, &quot;Exercise Cape Town&quot; being the first from 1 to 3 December for the 11th Armoured Brigade (11th Armd Bde) and &quot;Exercise Durban&quot; from 5 to 7 December for the 12th Motorised Brigade (12th Mot Bde). Training was concluded with &quot;Exercise Tussle&quot; as a British III Corps operation finishing on 21 January 1944 and on 23 January the division moved to Helwan. By now, the division had been in Egypt for months due to indecision related to its role.

On 3 March 1944, the division was instructed to move to Palestine and the advance parties left on 7 March. On 12 March however, this movement order was countermanded and the division was instructed to move to Italy. One year after arriving in the Middle East, the division embarked from Alexandria between 14 and 16 April to arrive in Taranto, Italy on 20 and 21 April 1944.

==Italy: Eighth Army==

===Detachment of 12th Motorised Brigade===

Regrouping was still in progress after arrival in Italy, when the 12th Motorised Brigade with artillery and support elements was ordered to move to the area of Isernia to prepare to relieve the 11th Canadian Infantry Brigade in the Cassino area and to come under command of the 2nd New Zealand Division in the British X Corps. These were the first division troops to enter combat in Italy. The South African Brigade held these positions until after the fall of Monte Cassino and the breakout from the Anzio beachhead, when they were withdrawn and reunited with the division.

===Initial advance after the fall of Rome===
Having formed part of British Eighth Army&#x27;s reserve, the division was moved forward and attached to the Canadian I Corps after the Canadians and Polish II Corps had breached the Hitler Line north of Cassino. After Rome had been taken by the Allies in early June 1944, the division was ordered to move up the Via Casalina to take over the spearhead of the Eighth Army&#x27;s British XIII Corps. To bring the division up to a full complement of three brigades, the British 24th Guards Brigade was placed under command, an association which lasted to the spring of 1945. The division advanced with the Tiber River to the east and Lake Bolsena to the west at a rate of per day, outstripping their flanking units. On 10 June the Armoured Brigade which was leading the advance, came up against the anti-tank screen of the newly arrived German 365th Infantry Division south of Celleno. For the first (and only) time Brigadier Furstenburg was able to deploy all three of his armoured regiments and his motorised infantry battalion in battle to gain an important victory. Lieutenant-Colonel Papa Brits (Special Service Battalion [SSB]) and Lieutenant-Colonel Bob Reeves-Moore (Imperial Light Horse / Kimberley Regiment [ILH/KR]) received DSOs for their leadership in the defeat of elements of the 365th Division. 11th Armd Bde&#x27;s success permeated the whole division and on 12 June the division took Orvieto, having advanced in ten days. However, their daily rate of advance had been slowed considerably by consistently being in contact with the enemy.
By 17 June, the Imperial Light Horse of the 11th Armd Bde had been stopped by the parachutists of the Hermann Göring Division on their first attempt to enter Chiusi but by 23 June, the town had been taken by the Cape Town Highlanders. During this attack on Chiusi, &quot;A&quot; Company of First City/Cape Town Highlanders was leading the attack up the terraces around the town. During the night of 21–22 June, the company was surrounded by strong German infantry elements closely supported by tanks and its surviving members were forced to surrender by noon on 22 June. Since the disaster of the surrender of the 2nd Infantry Division at Tobruk two years previously, the surrender of South African troops in the field had become a sensitive matter. This prompted Prime Minister Smuts, who had been meeting the British Chiefs of Staff on 21 June, to divert his aircraft to Orvieto airfield on his way back to South Africa to discuss the political and military consequences of this event with the division command.

===Crossing the Albert Line===

By 28 June, after stiff fighting, the Albert Line (referred to as the Trasimene Line by the Allies) had been broken and the Allies streamed north with the 24th Guards Brigade reaching Chianciano and the 11th Armd Bde pushing north of Lake Montepulciano. The Eighth Army&#x27;s XIII Corps advance on Florence was led by the British 6th Armoured Division on the right, British 4th Infantry Division in the centre and the South African 6th Armoured Division on the left. The division advanced in two columns through Rapolano and Palazzuolo until they encountered the LXXVI Panzer Corps on the Georg Line, a delaying position on the north side of Route 73.

The strength of the Panzer Corps was not known initially and the leading elements of XIII Corps continued to probe forward expecting the German line to crumble under pressure without the need to launch a full-scale attack. The Corps fed in more battalions in an attempt to secure the Monte Lignano high ground and fighting for the hill continued on 6 and 7 July, but the 15th Panzer Grenadier Division continued to hold the heights. The South African Division had been stopped on the left flank with the two Infantry Brigades spread over a front, the armour having been withdrawn into reserve because of the difficult terrain. On 7 July, 2 New Zealand Division was brought forward from reserve and their attack together with the British 6th Armoured Division eventually took the high ground and caused the German Corps to withdraw towards the Heinrich Line behind the River Arno on 15 July. The South African Division could then continue their advance, directed on an axis towards Radda-Greve on the western side of the Chianti Mountains.

The division made good progress, advancing with two brigades leading the advance: the 12th Mot Bde astride the road defining the division&#x27;s axis of advance and the Guards Bde on the right flank, on the slopes of the Chianti highlands. Radda was secured on the night of 17 July and orders were then received for the division to secure the heights of the Chianti Highlands. The Guards Bde took Mt. Maione by a night attack on the night of 18/19 July supported by the tanks of the Pretoria Regiment while 12th Mot Bde attacked to take Mt. St. Michele (Pt 892) on 20 July. The division now held the heights of the Chianti range, dominating the Arno Valley and the advances to Florence.

===Florence===
On 20 July General Kirkman, XIII Corps commander, issued orders for a &quot;...powerful thrust to seize all crossings across the River Arno to the west of Florence.&quot; This effort was to be concentrated on the 6th South African Armoured Division front. The advance was to be led by the South African Division with the 4th Infantry Division to its right, supported on the flanks by the 6th British Armoured Division and the 8th Indian Infantry Division. The division&#x27;s advance was slowed at the approaches to Greve due to heavy mining, where a number of tanks were lost but eventually the 11th Armd Bde succeeded in capturing Mercatale, which was defended by the German 356th Infantry Division supported by Tiger tanks. The division advanced through Greve and were again stopped by the German 4th Parachute Division on the River Greve on 24 July. The division had, however, outflanked the German Parachute Division, who then withdrew during the night of 24/25 July, allowing the South African, New Zealand and Indian Divisions to advance to the Paula Line which was reached on 28 July.

Kirkman again placed the South African and New Zealand Divisions as the spearhead of his Corps advance, this time to break the Paula Line and to take Florence. The New Zealand Division would carry out the main assault and the South African Division would neutralise the enemy on the high ground west of Impruneta and then clear Route 2 into Florence. The attack was scheduled for 30 July 1944. General Harold Alexander, commander of Allied Armies in Italy, had indicated that he had no intention of fighting in Florence and so Kirkman gave orders for the by-passing of the city. On 31 July the heavy artillery support for the attack had resulted in an ammunition shortage and Kirkman ordered a 24-hour pause for fresh supplies to arrive. The Desert Air Force flew over 100 sorties per day on 31 July and 1 August in support of the attack and by 3 August columns of South African, New Zealand and 4th Infantry Divisions were advancing towards Florence. By 4 August, advance parties were exploring the outskirts of Florence to find that all bridges across the Arno River viable for military transport had been destroyed. An Imperial Light Horse / Kimberley Regiment patrol however found the smaller Ponte Vecchio bridge intact and crossed it under heavy shelling, entering into the centre of the city at 4 am, to be the first allied troops to enter Florence.

After reaching Florence, General Pool recorded in a Special Order of the Day, that the division had &quot;... covered since leaving its concentration area at Taranto, its artillery had fired 201,500 rounds, the Divisional Engineers had built sixty five bridges (one a day!) and had made 196 major deviations necessitated by &#x27;blows&#x27; and demolitions. The signallers had laid of telephone cable.&quot; The division was then withdrawn into Eighth Army reserve for rest and maintenance in the Siena / Castelnuovo area until 17 August, when orders were issued for the division to be transferred from British XIII Corps to U.S. IV Corps to partially replace divisions withdrawn to the U.S. Seventh Army for the assault of southern France. The 6th South African Armoured Division was assigned to their new Corps in the U.S. Fifth Army as from 22 August 1944 and was replaced in XIII Corps by the British 6th Armoured Division.

==Italy: Fifth Army==

===Crossing the Arno River===

To continue the main Allied thrust north from Florence, the Arno River first had to be crossed. Reconnaissance patrols from the First City/Cape Town Highlanders [FC/CTH] found suitable crossing points close to Le Piagge allowing the 12th Mot Bde to cross during the night of 28/29 August under light enemy artillery fire. Reports from prisoners indicated that the German forces in front of the division were withdrawing, and this was confirmed by the sound of demolitions ahead of them. The 12th Brigade, as well as the Guards Brigade were tasked to send fighting patrols forward to determine the extent of the withdrawal. Reports indicated that the Germans had withdrawn across a wide front to what was to later become known as the Gothic Line. The division crossed the river thanks to Bailey bridges erected between the damaged abutments by the South African Engineers. Under sporadic shelling and some units encountering light resistance, the operation was completed by 3 September. General Pool, observing the lack of resistance ahead of the division, encouraged a rapid advance, but this was countermanded in order not to compromise the surprise of the main 5th Army attack north of Florence. The order to wait and hold the Albano Massif until further notice was deeply resented by the division command and was considered representative of the persistent inflexibility displayed by the Fifth Army leadership.

===Apennines===
The Eighth Army offensive on the German held Gothic Line was assigned the codename and had commenced on 25 August 1944. intercepts had shown that the Allies had a significant numerical superiority in manpower, armour, air and artillery, although there were concerns regarding the relative inferiority of Allied tank armour and gun power as compared to German equipment. The U.S. Fifth Army attack was launched on 10 September against the mountain bastions south of Bologna and was led by U.S. II Corps. As part of the plan, the 6th SA Armoured Division was ordered to advance along Route 64 leading to Vergato and Bologna and to capture the twin peaks of Monte Sole and Caprara di Marzabotto. The division&#x27;s 24th Guards Brigade were first to encounter the Gothic Line defences when the Brigade met strong resistance from two battalions of the Lehr Brigade as well as two battalions of the 362nd Infantry Division, fighting from strongly fortified positions which had been prepared throughout the previous winter.

After being ordered to hold the Albano Massif, the 11th Armd Bde was forced due to the terrain to operate dismounted from their tanks in order to contain the German 362nd Infantry Division. By 22 September, demolitions were again heard and it became evident that the Germans had started withdrawing to Green Line II, the next layer of the Gothic Line defences. Operation officially ended on 21 September 1944.

===Gothic Line battles===
The South African advance re-commenced with the division heading north on Route 64 with US II Corps to their right and U.S. 34th Infantry Division on the left. Reports had been received that the 16th SS Panzer Grenadier Division had taken over from the German 362nd Infantry Division and that they were now defending the front ahead of the South African Division. By 28 September, the division was advancing on three widely separated axis, retreating German forces were demolishing bridges, culverts and roads and this, with traffic congestion on limited roads made passage extremely slow. It was then decided to hand over Route 66 to Task Force 92, as the South African Engineers were not able to maintain the three parallel routes simultaneously. This permitted the Guards Brigade to re-unite with the 11th Armd Bde in protecting the US II Corps western flank. Monte Vigese dominated the division&#x27;s main line of advance. Two days of extended fighting in drenching rain against elements of the 36th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment brought no break through and Poole then decided to pause and prepare a divisional attack on the mountain, to be led by 12th Mot Bde with 11th Armd and Guards Brigades in support. After an extremely heavy artillery bombardment of more than 10,000 shells, the attack succeeded.

After this battle, the division was withdrawn for rest and maintenance. It was reassigned from U.S. IV Corps to direct command by the U.S. Fifth Army to enable the Army commander, Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, to coordinate the division&#x27;s advance more closely with that of U.S. II Corps. In addition, the division was heavily reinforced with artillery and taking Combat Command B, an armoured brigade from U.S. 1st Armored Division, under command. The division&#x27;s major task became that of thrusting north towards Bologna covering the flank of the U.S. 34th Division. Combat Command B was to advance on Route 64, the 24th Guards Brigade along the Setta Valley road, with 11th and 12th Bdes covering the high ground between the two. Opposing the advance was the 16th SS Panzer Grenadier Division. By 25 October the division had waded the Setta Creek and taken Hill 501 below Mt. Sole, but the Guards Bde attack on Mt. Sole was halted by torrential rains. The following day the continuing rains had turned to floods, isolating the division elements on Hill 501 and suspending all air support from U.S. XXII Tactical Air Command. Mt. Sole was not attacked again and the division was returned to U.S. IV Corps command on 4 November. As winter set in, the U.S. Fifth Army entered a period of static winter campaigning patrolling from fixed defensive positions until February 1945.

===Spring Offensive===

On 18 February the 24th Guards Brigade was transferred from the division to the British 56th Infantry Division in the British Eighth Army. This ended an enduring relationship, particularly between the armoured Pretoria Regiment and the three Guards battalions. The division was relieved by the U.S. 1st Armored Division&#x27;s Combat command &#x27;A&#x27; (which took over from 12 Mot Bde) and U.S. Combat Command &#x27;B&#x27; (relieving the 11th Armd Bde) and was withdrawn to Lucca.
The final Italian offensive (codenamed ) plan was based on the use of three phase lines, &quot;Green,&quot; &quot;Brown&quot; and &quot;Black&quot;. The U.S. Fifth Army, now under Lucian K. Truscott, operating on the left and coordinated with the British Eighth Army, now commanded by Richard L. McCreery, on the right, were to initiate the &quot;Green&quot; phase with primary attacks by the U.S. 1st Armored and U.S. 10th Mountain Divisions. In the &quot;Brown&quot; phase, the South African Division would assault the two peaks of Monte Sole and Monte Caprara in the centre of the U.S. II Corps (and thus Fifth Army) advance. If all progressed well, &quot;Black&quot; phase would signal the start of the break-out attempt by the armoured divisions into the Po Valley. The U.S. 1st Armored Division was to wheel westwards and the South African Division was to drive north west of Bologna to link-up with the Eighth Army. Intelligence had shown that the peaks the South Africans were to attack were defended by the German 8th Mountain Division.

Operations related to Phase Line &quot;Green&quot; progressed largely to plan and Phase &quot;Brown&quot; was initiated on 15 April. That night the South African Division was the first of the U.S. II Corps divisions to secure their objectives, taking Mount Sole in a series of well coordinated night attacks, assisted by the heaviest tactical bombing support they had received to date in the campaign. This was also the first combat experienced by the new 13th South African Motorised Brigade (13th Mot Bde) which had been sent from South Africa to replace the 24th Guards Brigade. The battle had been fierce for all the division&#x27;s troops involved and in the succeeding successful exploitation of Monte Caprara heavy losses were incurred. On 21 April, 11th Armd Brigade, who were supporting the U.S. 349th Engineering Regiment, converged on the centre of the town of San Matteo della Decima. Soon furious house-to-house fighting erupted which continued until nightfall and resulted in several tanks being destroyed by fire from German Panzerfaust rockets. Poole committed all available South African troops to flush out German snipers and anti-tank positions and by 22 April all resistance had ceased.

These victories had created the opportunity for the armour to break through to Bologna as part of Phase &quot;Black&quot; and the South Africans linked up with the British 6th Armoured Division on 23 April and in the process cut the lines of retreat of the German 14th Panzer and 1st Parachute Corps between them. In addition, in their advance to the link-up, the South African Division had destroyed the German 65th Infantry Division. After advancing through the Po River Valley, the division was assembled southwest of Treviso on 29 April and were instructed to move far to the west to garrison the city of Milan.

General Mark Clark, the 15th Army Group commander, commented on the division&#x27;s achievements during the Spring Offensive, stating:
==End of the war==

===Axis surrender===
Early on 2 May the German Theatre commander, Field Marshal Albert Kesselring, agreed to Field Marshal Alexander&#x27;s surrender terms and broadcast orders to cease fire. The South African Division was north east of Milan by 3 May, when General Fridolin von Senger und Etterlin delivered the surrender of the German forces in Italy to General Clark in Florence. This was followed by Winston Churchill&#x27;s announcement of the end of the war in Europe on 8 May 1945. The division held a major victory parade at the Monza motor racing circuit on 14 July 1945 attended by Generals Clark (15th Army Group) and Truscott (5th Army) as well as commanders of numerous formations in the region. During this parade, numerous US awards were made to men within the division, including the rank of Commander of the Legion of Merit being awarded to General Poole.

South African brigades were then deployed to the Swiss and French borders for frontier duties with 11 SA Armd Bde along the Swiss border, 13 Mot Bde around Turin, and 12 Mot Bde in the Aosta Valley contiguous to the Franco-Italian border which was drawn on the high ground separating the two countries. On 16 July, the Italian Cremona and Mantova Battle Groups were placed under command of the division to assist in these duties, allowing some of the battalions to be withdrawn for repatriation to South Africa. The two motorised brigades were amalgamated and remained responsible for guarding duties in the province of Imperia until 18 August while the armoured brigade was amalgamated with the division artillery.

===Riots during demobilisation===

By the beginning of April 1945, it had become obvious that the war was coming to a close and that the division as well as many other South African troops serving as divisional, corps or army troops with other formations would require repatriation back to South Africa for demobilisation. On 1 May, the Union Defence Force realised that no plans had yet been made to get all men back and instructions were prepared to move 5,000 troops per month by air commencing 1 July 1945 and 15,000 men by sea during the second half of the year, resulting in the repatriation of 45,000 troops by the end of the year. In addition to the 6th South African Armoured Division and other troops in Italy, there were thousands of recently released South African prisoners of war who had been held in Italy from the 2nd South African Infantry Division since the Sidi Rezegh and Tobruk battles in the western desert. Their numbers had not been factored into the demobilisation plans.

The staging depot at Helwan north of Cairo was soon overcrowded and the number of troops being flown back to South Africa were substantially lower than had been planned. In addition, the expected shipping had been delayed. Food was in short supply and the standard of discipline deteriorated further as men arriving at the depot were split up alphabetically and were not retained in their unit structures. A protest meeting was held on 20 August and as the size of the crowd increased, the meeting became more violent eventually resulting in the troops trashing, looting and burning numerous Egyptian premises, blocks of shops, motor cars, bungalows and book stalls as well as one of their own messes, and broke down and looted the NAAFI store. General Poole flew in from Italy to address the troops, promising that immediate steps were to be taken to speed up the rate of repatriation. Weeks later, the subsequent court of enquiry assessed the total cost of the damages at £22,768,431.

By 25 January 1946, 101,676 men had been ferried back to South Africa and the last aircraft left Egypt on 26 February 1946, carrying Major General Evered Poole who arrived in Durban on 2 March 1946.

===Casualties===
General Poole gave the campaign statistics for South African casualties as follows: Killed: 711; Wounded: 2,675; Missing: 157; Total: 3,543.

<doc id="1222431" wikidata="Q3364682" url="?curid=1222431" title="Rondeau Provincial Park">
<text>Rondeau Provincial Park is the second oldest provincial park in Ontario, Canada, having been established with an order in council on 8 September 1894. The park is located in Southwestern Ontario, on an 8 km long crescentic sand spit extending into Lake Erie. Rondeau is home to the largest area of Carolinian forest in Canada, a long sand beach, a large marsh, approximately half of Rondeau Bay, campgrounds and a cottage community. The name of the park comes from the French words &quot;ronde eau&quot; or &quot;round water&quot; which describes the shape of the harbour sheltered by the peninsula.

The park is an important stopover for birds during migration and has been identified as a Canadian Important Bird Area. Its Carolinian woods also provide nesting habitat for the prothonotary warbler and many other rare or endangered species. The park is a popular recreation area. The presence of private cottages in the park has been controversial, as have been efforts to control white-tailed deer populations.

== Geography ==
The park is located on Pointe aux Pins, a peninsula extending into Lake Erie. The sandspit has formed in the last 12,000 years as currents in the lake deposit sandbars. The shape of the peninsula continues to evolve. For instance, the barrier beach has receded in the past 150 years. In a 1930 soil survey most of the spit was mapped as Berrien sand, which is imperfectly drained.

Rondeau Provincial Park includes most of the peninsula (excepting the very base), and much of Rondeau Bay. The peninsula is occupied by a series of low ridges and sloughs. A narrow sand spit extends west, sheltering the marshes and bay, and nearly reaching the town of Erieau.

==History==
Prior to European Settlement, the area was used by the Neutral Nation. The peninsula was largely bypassed by settlers given the infertile, sandy soil. However, the forests of Point aux Pins were valuable, and heavy logging was underway as early as 1844. Through the 1870s and 1880s, the area became increasingly popular for recreation, and although only very limited use of the peninsula was permitted, pressures from fishing, grazing, forestry and other uses became increasingly important. Shortly following the establishment of Ontario&#x27;s first Provincial Park in 1893 (Algonquin), pressure from local councils led to the establishment of Rondeau Provincial Park in 1894.

The initial regulations governing Rondeau prohibited settlement, grazing, and most logging, and allowed for camping under permit and a renewable lease policy for cottages. In a general sense, all these regulations remain in place today.

Rondeau is one of only two Ontario provincial parks with private cottage leases on publicly owned land. Several other parks, such as Presqu&#x27;ile Provincial Park, do have cottages on private land surrounded by the publicly owned park. At Rondeau, the cottage leases were first created between 1894 and 1950. As of 2022 there are 278 private cottages within Rondeau Provincial Park.

The future of cottages at Rondeau has been controversial. In 1986, the Provincial Parks Council recommended the extension of all cottage leases to 2017 after which they would be terminated, and in 2017, the leases were extended for a further two years to December 31, 2019. Since 1954, the Rondeau Cottagers Association has been lobbying for recognition and preservation of the Rondeau cottage community. In 2014, Chatham-Kent Council voted to have Rondeau&#x27;s cottage community placed on the municipality&#x27;s Heritage Register and be designated as a heritage district; the designation was later repealed by an order from the Ontario Municipal Board but the community remains on the Heritage Register.

A formerly popular site in the park was the government pier on Rondeau Bay. In 2014, the pier was severely damaged by thick ice on Rondeau Bay and later removed. Despite community pressure, the pier has not been replaced.

The Rondeau Yacht Club, located within the park, was founded in 1932. The club continues to operate during July and August teaching sailing, windsurfing, canoeing, and swimming to area children.

== Natural environment ==

Rondeau has a variety of habitats, including sandy beach, dunes, prairie, oak savannah, Carolinian forest, woodlands sloughs, a large marsh, and productive shallow bay. The park is recognised as one of Ontario&#x27;s most important natural areas. Many of the plant species found here are typical of areas further south. Prominent among them is tuliptree, whose leaf forms the basis for the Friends of Rondeau Provincial Park logo. A variety of nationally and provincially threatened or endangered species are found in the park, such as eastern spiny softshell and nodding pogonia. The park is home to the largest population of breeding prothonotary warblers in Canada. Other endangered birds nesting in the park include king rail and Acadian flycatcher. The park is also an important stopover for migrating birds in spring and fall. During the first Atlas of Breeding Birds of Ontario, the Rondeau Area had the highest breeding bird diversity in the province.

Overpopulation of white-tailed deer, and their effect on forest vegetation, has been an ongoing concern. Although controversial, culls to control deer numbers are held on a regular basis, in recent years involving members of the Delaware Nation at Moraviantown.

== Recreation ==

In 2011, Rondeau received nearly 160,000 visitors. Park facilities include 262 developed campsites, six hiking trails, picnic areas, a boat launch, and a visitor centre with interpretive displays and programming. Popular recreational activities include hiking, cycling, fishing, hunting, birding, windsurfing. Birding is especially popular in May as migrant songbirds heading north stopover in the park. Windsurfing is popular on Rondeau Bay on days with strong southwest winds. Waterfowl hunting is popular in the marsh in fall; recreational hunting is otherwise prohibited.

<text>The A1 highway is a highway in Lithuania, connecting the three largest cities in the country: Vilnius, Kaunas, and Klaipėda. The highway is long, making it the longest highway route in Lithuania.

Highway is indicated as motorway between municipal borders of Vilnius and Klaipėda. This excludes sections that crosses Vievis, Kaunas and Sujainiai (which has one-level junction that is used by agricultural vehicles at times). The highway has two carriageways with two lanes each for the entire section. This excludes section near Kaunas between junctions with A5 and A6 highways. It&#x27;s now undergoing reconstruction where the road will be widened to have four carriageways with two lanes each with one short section with four lanes which is already refurbished. Two outer carriageways will be used for connecting densely located local junctions with speed limit of 90 km/h, while two inner carriageways will avoid connections with local junctions and the speed limit will be higher with 110 km/h. Inner carriageways will be connected via slip roads from outer carriageways. The main reason why the road is now under construction is that the section has highest AADT in Lithuania of all roads outside urban areas.

Before 2021, only section Kaunas-Klaipėda was considered to be a motorway while section Kaunas-Vilnius was considered to be an expressway from 2006. Kaunas-Vilnius had too many substandard features for receiving motorway status. Reconstruction took place in 2020 on which many minor elements of the highway were renovated to fulfil the standards for safe 130 km/h traffic. This includes reconstruction of lanes near junctions, reducing amount of some slipways, removing possibility of pedestrian crossing at grade, building pedestrian underpasses and overpasses. New motorway will remain not completely grade separated since there are some points where the highway can be accessed via right ins and outs whom doesn&#x27;t form parts of grade-separated junctions. This is not usual for motorway in Europe, since most motorways here are accessed via grade separated junction.

The highway follows E85 for its entire length with the relatively short section of E67 northwest of Kaunas also known as the Via Baltica.

The Vilnius–Kaunas highway was completed on 3 November 1970 and Kaunas–Klaipėda was completed on 1 September 1987. It replaced the first 40 kilometers of the 1930s-built Samogitian Highway stretching from Kaunas.

<doc id="1222441" wikidata="Q4836492" url="?curid=1222441" title="BR Standard Class 5">
<text>The British Railways Standard Class 5MT is one of the 12 BR standard classes of steam locomotive built by British Railways in the 1950s. It was essentially a development of the LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 (&quot;Black Five&quot;). A total of 172 were built between 1951 and 1957.

== Background ==
William Stanier&#x27;s Black Five had been the most successful mixed-traffic type in Great Britain. Construction of the Black Fives had started in 1934 and continued past nationalisation to 1951. A new set of &#x27;standard&#x27; locomotives was to be built by British Railways, based on LMS designs and incorporating modern ideas.

In particular, the Standard design incorporated features designed to make disposal of the engine after a working &quot;turn&quot; easier: a self-cleaning smokebox and a rocking grate removed the necessity for crews to undertake dirty and strenuous duties at the end of a long shift. This was a necessary investment with the ever-increasing costs of labour following the Second World War.

The original design proposal for the class 5 locomotive had a wheel arrangement, similar in concept to the Bulleid Light Pacifics that performed impressively during the 1948 Locomotive Exchanges. However this was deemed unnecessarily large and costly for a class 5 power requirement, so the successful LMS Class 5 design was used as the basis instead. The pacific design went on to be enlarged and used for the BR Standard Class 6.

== Design and construction ==
The design work was done at the ex-LNER Doncaster Works but the bulk of the construction was done at Derby Works. The locomotive featured a BR standard boiler very similar in dimensions to the Stanier Type 3B fitted to the Black Fives, but made from manganese steel instead of nickel steel. The most obvious visible changes were a higher running plate, slightly enlarged driving wheels (from to ), increased cylinder bore (from 18½ in (457 mm) to 19 in(483 mm)), a standard cab with external pipework and the regulator gland on the driver&#x27;s side of the boiler below the dome. Many of these changes were to reduce maintenance or to incorporate standard components that could be shared between other standard classes.

The first of the class, 73000, was outshopped from Derby in April 1951 and 30 were in service by January 1952. There was then a gap in construction before Derby resumed building its remaining 100 engines. 42 were built at Doncaster, starting in August 1955 and finishing in May 1957, with Derby&#x27;s last engine following a month later.

Thirty engines, numbers 73125 to 73154, were built with Caprotti valve gear and poppet valves.

== In service ==
These locomotives had a trouble-free introduction in comparison to several of the other Standard classes and were used interchangeably with the pre-nationalisation class 5 engines they supplemented. They were utilised on duties varying from fast passenger trains to slow unfitted freight trains, displaying their versatility.

Different regional allocations had differing tender designs, with locomotives assigned to the Southern Region having tenders with high water capacity to make up for the lack of water troughs.

Like the &quot;Clan&quot; class locomotives, the Standard 5s, with their high-stepped running board, were partly conceived to be more economical and serviceable replacements for the Bulleid Pacific. The Standard 5s could also run quite fast, with many drivers claiming they could easily reach just under . Like the Clans, which could only manage one more carriage on an express than a &#x27;Five&#x27;, it took footplate crews time to get accustomed to them. They began reaching full potential with different firing techniques to let them to steam using poor quality coal were developed. They pulled much of the traffic on the last express lines for steam in the mid and late 1960s, such as Edinburgh-Aberdeen, London- Southampton-Bournemouth- Weymouth and local express traffic in the North and Midlands around Sheffield and Leeds. They were also used on the locals between Liverpool, Manchester and Blackpool, some lasting to the very end of steam in 1968.

== Naming ==
In 1959, 20 of the Southern Region locomotives were named, the names being transferred from SR King Arthur class locos that were then being withdrawn. These were:

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 25 August 1958, locomotive No. 73042 was hauling a sleeper car train which overran a signal and was in a head-on collision with a train formed from two electric multiple units at , East Sussex. Five people were killed and 40 were injured.
*In 1958, locomotive No. 73111 was hauling a passenger train that derailed at Millbrook, Hampshire due to a faulty point motor moving a set of points under the train.
== Variations &amp; proposed changes ==
The main variation across the class was the valve gear, with 142 using Walschaerts valve gear and the remaining 30 using British Caprotti valve gear. There was little difference in performance between the two groups, but the Caprotti fitted engines had a reputation for being good performers at higher speeds. There was potential for more BR standard locomotives to have Caprotti valve gear fitted as it allowed for longer periods between inspections, offsetting the higher initial cost of this valve gear.

Doncaster had designed double chimneys for the class, similar to the ones used on several of the BR Standard Class 4 4-6-0. If applied, this would have improved the draughting and increased the efficiency of the locomotives. With the Modernisation Plan of 1955 and the good performance of the class from the outset, these plans were shelved permanently.

Another proposal was to produce freight locomotives based from this design in response to criticism by the Western Region on the BR Standard Class 9F. The management believed that the 9Fs were too large and powerful for most heavy freight traffic, along with being far more expensive to build and operate than the older 2-8-0 locomotives they supplemented. In response to this, the British Transport Commission drew a 2-8-0 Class 8F based on the Standard Class 5, like the LMS class 5 and 8Fs. Changes included a higher boiler pressure of 250 psi and driving wheels in diameter to increase tractive effort. Preparations were made for series production to begin, but the work ceased after the Modernisation Plan was published.

== Preservation ==

Five members of the class survive and all have steamed in preservation with examples from both builders. 73050 was purchased directly from British Railways for preservation while the other four engines were rescued from Woodham Brothers scrapyard at Barry Island. To date 73096 has been the only member of the class to operate on the main line hauling railtours but in 2018 no. 73082 was moved by rail from its home at the Bluebell Railway to the West Somerset Railway.

<text>Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe (12 November 1894 in Kristiania – 8 June 1976 in Oslo) was a Norwegian zoologist and comparative psychologist. He was the first person to describe a pecking order of hens.

==Life and work==
Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe the son of sculptors (1868–1941) and Menga Schjelderup (1871–1945). At the age of 19, in 1913, he described a pecking order of hens. The findings were based on observing chickens at a farm during his summer holidays. The dominance hierarchy of chickens and other birds that he studied led him to the observation that hens had an established social order determining who-dared-to-peck-whom in a fight. This order was, Schjelderup-Ebbe concluded, not necessarily dependent on the strength or age of the hens, and not necessarily a strict ranking as he even observed triangles of dominance. Schjelderup-Ebbe studied for a Ph.D. in Germany, tried to present his thesis in Oslo, but was rejected.

==Personal life==
Schjelderup-Ebbe was married to Torbjørg Brekke. Their son was Dag Schjelderup-Ebbe, a musicologist, composer, music critic and biographer.

<text>Bhatia is a group of people and a caste found in Punjab, Sindh and Gujarat. Traditionally, they have been a trading and merchant community. The Bhatias primarily live in Northwestern India and Pakistan. The Bhatias, Lohanas and Khatris were similar communities and were known to intermarry. The Bhatias recruit Saraswat Brahmins as priests.

==History==
The Bhatias are a mercantile community - traditionally they were merchants and traders. The Bhatias primarily live in Northwestern India and Pakistan. According to B.N. Puri, Bhatias are a part of the Khatri community but them along with Aroras and Soods maintained a distinct identity.

Before their traditional occupation of traders, both the Lohanas and Bhatia were involved in the profession of Agriculture. Historian Goswami states that their ritual position was &quot;ambiguous&quot;, and, &quot;they were considered neither a high nor a low caste&quot;. She further adds that as per the British Raj era Major general Alexander Cunningham, the word &quot;Bhatia&quot; is derived from the word &quot;Bhat&quot; meaning a warrior. The Bhatias claim that they are of Rajput origin. As per Goswami, they are a &quot;traditional Bania caste&quot;. Historian Dwijendra Tripathi states that the Bhatias are associated with the Vaishyas like the Vaishnava Banias and sociologist A.M.Shah also considers the Bhatias to belong to the Vaishya varna like the Lohanas and Vanias.

The geographical origins of the Bhatia caste are uncertain. A more recent study by André Wink traces a 12th-century connection between the Bhatias of Jaisalmer and the Caulukyas of Gujarat, while Anthony O&#x27;Brien almost-contemporaneous attempt to discover their homeland caused him to place them around Sindh from the 7th century. Wink, who is a professor with interests in medieval and early modern Indian history, records that many of the community in Sindh converted to Islam during the reign of Firoz Shah Tughluq.

The Bhatias, who had been associated in particular with the Multan area in Sindh, were historically merchants and they probably formed part of the earliest Indian diaspora found in Central Asia, together with the Bhora and the Lohana communities. Their emergence as a significant merchant group pre-dates the 17th century and certainly by the time that India became subject to colonial rule, the Bhatias and the other two early diaspora communities had established trade and moneylending networks that, according to Scott Levi, who specialises in the history of Central Asia, &quot;... extended across Afghanistan, Central Asia, and eventually reached even beyond the Arabian Peninsula and East Africa to the Caribbean islands in the west, and to Southeast Asia and China in the east.&quot;
Bhatias along with Khatris and Lohanas were prominent merchants who had contacts right from Volga River (Russia) to Kolkata (India) The Bhatias, who had been associated in particular with the Multan area in Sindh, were historically merchants and they probably formed part of the earliest Indian diaspora found in Central Asia, together with the Bohra and the Lohana communities. Their emergence as a significant merchant group pre-dates the 17th century and certainly by the time that India became subject to colonial rule, the Bhatias and the other two early diaspora communities had established trade and moneylending networks that, according to Scott Levi, who specialises in the history of Central Asia, &quot;... extended across Afghanistan, Central Asia, and eventually reached even beyond the Arabian Peninsula and East Africa to the Caribbean islands in the west, and to Southeast Asia and China in the east.&quot; Bhatias of Thatta (Sindh) established a colony in Muscat (Oman) where they conducted international trade between Arabian peninsula and India.

During the Battle of Chamkaur, 5 out of the 40 Punjabi soldiers were Sikh Bhatias. They fought against a large army of Mughals. During the Battle of Mukstar, 40 Punjabis laid down their lives fighting against the Mughals. Out of the 25 soldiers whose caste is recorded, 3 soldiers belonged to Sikh Bhatia families.

Formerly the Bhāṭiyās were non-vegetarian.

== Religion ==

Hindu Bhatias follow Vaishnavism. They revere Vishnu&#x27;s avatars including Rama and Krishna. They also worship Hinglaj Mata as well as Dariya Sagar (sea). Moreover, some Bhatias are Jains. The oldest temple of Gulf, Shrinathji Temple in Bahrain was constructed by the Thatthai Bhatia community in 1814 and is still managed by them. It is dedicated to Lord Shrinathji, a form of Krishna. Dwarka Temples were largely funded by Bhatias.

Many Bhatias followed Sikhism. Bhai Banno was the son of Bishan Chand Bhatia of village Mangat of district Gujrat in Punjab (now in modern-day Pakistan). He became a faithful follower of Guru Arjan who involved him in the preparation of the Adi Granth.Maharaja Ranjit Singh&#x27;s ancestors were initiated into Sikhism by the efforts of Bhai Banno Bhatia.

==Sub-groups==
Among the Bhatias, there are different sub-castes, such as Jakhar, Kutchi, Veha, Halai, Kanthi, Pavrai, Navgam, Pachisgaam, Thattai and Punjabi. Bhatias from Kutch are Kutchi Bhatias, those from around Jamnagar district are known as Halai Bhatia, those from Sindh in present-day Pakistan are known as Sindhi Bhatias and those from Punjab in present-day India and Pakistan are known as Punjabi Bhatias. A large number of Punjabi Bhatias settled in Pakistani Punjab in 1947.

Some of the major groups derived from the principal professions they follow or the crafts they practice.

<text>Each XML document has exactly one single root element. It encloses all the other elements and is, therefore, the sole parent element to all the other elements. ROOT elements are also called document elements. In HTML, the root element is the codice_1 element.

The World Wide Web Consortium defines not only the specifications for XML itself, but also the DOM, which is a platform- and language-independent standard object model for representing XML documents. DOM Level 1 defines, for every XML document, an object representation of the codice_2 itself and an attribute or property on the document called codice_3. This property provides access to an object of type codice_4 which directly represents the root element of the document.

 &lt;parent&gt;
 &lt;child&gt;content&lt;/child&gt;
 &lt;child attribute=&quot;att&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/parent&gt;

There can be other XML nodes outside of the root element. In particular, the root element may be preceded by a &quot;prolog&quot;, which itself may consist of an &quot;XML declaration&quot;, optional comments, processing instructions and whitespace, followed by an optional &quot;DOCTYPE declaration&quot; and more optional comments, processing instructions and whitespace. After the root element, there may be further optional comments, processing instructions and whitespace within the document. 

Within the root element, apart from any number of attributes and other elements, there may also be more optional text, comments, processing instructions and whitespace.

A more expanded example of an XML document follows, demonstrating some of these extra nodes along with a single codice_5 element.
 &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

<doc id="1222456" wikidata="Q1757970" url="?curid=1222456" title="Elder (administrative title)">
<text>The term Elder, or its equivalent in another language, is used in several countries and organizations to indicate a position of authority. This usage is usually derived from the notion that the oldest members of any given group are the wisest, and are thus the most qualified to rule, provide counsel or serve the said group in some other capacity. They often serve as oral repositories of their culture&#x27;s traditional knowledge, morals, and values.

==Elder systems==
Elder is a role played in the organised community that is most common in tribal subsistence cultures, &quot;Elderhood&quot; being the condition or quality of being an elder. It is essentially the state of being in the latter portion of one&#x27;s life and being looked to for leadership of either a passive or active nature by your peers and\or subordinates due almost exclusively to this fact. Sometimes it involves a ceremonial investiture of some kind, and other times it does not. Sometimes it involves a definite chronological milestone which must be surpassed, while at other times the required age is simply relative to the ages of all of the other members of the group in question. Once having met the peculiar requirements of their individual groups, however, all elders are generally expected to mentor, share their experience, create a sense of oneness for their followings and, most especially, act as the spiritual embodiments of their communities.

===Informal elderhoods===
An example of informal elderhood is the role of the matriarchal grandmother as it appears in many parts of the global South. In the absence of viable male alternatives or even in the presence of them, grandmothers in these areas tend to serve as both the de facto heads of their groups of descendants and the catalysts of their periodic reunions and meetings. By doing so they provide their families with a cohesion that would probably be absent if they weren&#x27;t present. Another example is that of the vocational mentor who guides his or her apprentices with tools of sponsorship, advocacy and the demonstration of skills. He or she serves to facilitate creativity in his or her charges by teaching the methods of the past as they pertain to their various occupations.

===Formal elderhoods===
In more formal examples of elderhood, elders serve as the members of the governing and/or advisory bodies of higher personages such as kings and presidents in the form of a council of elders. This often gives them a prestige amongst their peoples that&#x27;s comparable to that of the classical nobility of ancient Europe. Due to this, elderhood of this variety is generally considered to be something worthy of aspiring to in the communities where it exists.

===Elders in online communities===
There are long established conceptualisations of elders on the Internet. In such online communities elders are typically thought of as established members who are outbound, often due to unwanted changes they can&#x27;t prevent.
