<text>Nancy Laura Stokey (born May 8, 1950) has been the Frederick Henry Prince Distinguished Service Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago since 1990 and focuses particularly on mathematical economics while recently conducting research about Growth Theory, economic dynamics, and fiscal/monetary policy. She earned her BA in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1972 and her PhD from Harvard University in 1978, under the direction of thesis advisor Kenneth Arrow. She is a Fellow of the Econometric Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences. She previously served as a co editor of &quot;Econometrica&quot; and was a member of the Expert Panel of the Copenhagen Consensus. She received her Honorary Doctor of Laws (L.L.D) in 2012 from the University of Western Ontario. 

==Author==
Stokey has published significant research in the areas of economic growth and development, as well as papers on economic history (&quot;A Quantitative Model of the British Industrial Revolution: 1780–1850,&quot; 2001) and optimal control (&quot;Dynamic Programming with Homogeneous Functions,&quot; 1998, co-authored with Fernando Alvarez). She is the co-developer, with Paul Milgrom, of the no-trade theorem, a counter-intuitive development of the premises of financial economics. She co-authored with Robert Lucas, Jr. and Edward Prescott a book on &quot;Recursive Methods in Economic Dynamics&quot; that is widely used by research economists and graduate students. Stokey worked with Paul Milgrom to publish &quot;Information, Trade, and Common Knowledge&quot; (1982), which established that information-based trade is not possible for rational agents with common knowledge. This work contributed to be one of the pillars of modern finance.

Stokey has also written articles that explain the &quot;wait and see model&quot;, which describes investment decisions that firms who face a one-time tax policy will endure. As well as the author of &quot;The Economics of Inaction&quot; (2009) which treats models that involve fixed costs of adjustment.

Stokey has written critically about how the United Nations allocates funds for international economic development and humanitarian aid.

Stokey coauthored &quot;Optimal Monetary and Fiscal Policy&quot; which was one of the first papers to examine the time consistency of macroeconomic policy and to demonstrate the importance of central banks following rules.

Her recent research is on growth theory, economic dynamics, and fiscal and monetary policy. Her recent work include &quot;Specific Technical Change, Trade Dynamics, and the Evolution of Skill Premia&quot; and &quot;Monetary Shocks in an Economy with Circulating Capital.&quot;

She is currently working on &quot;Technology, Skill, and Long-Run Growth&quot; (June 2017), &quot;Technology, Skill, and the Wage Structure&quot; (June 2017), &quot;The Race Between Technology and The Human Capital&quot; (2014), and &quot;Liquidity Crises: Understanding Sources and Limiting Consequences&quot; with Robert E. Lucas Jr.

== Professional experience ==
Stokey has taught and worked in various institutions. She was an economics professor at Northwestern University since 1978, from assistant professor to department chairman in 1987. She also taught economics as a visiting lecturer at Harvard University in the fall of 1982, at University of Minnesota in spring of 1983, and then at University of Chicago in 1983–1984. Since 1990, she has been teaching economics at University of Chicago. Aside from teaching, she was a visiting scholar of the Research Department at Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis for eight falls in the 2000s. She was awarded the 2021 CME Group - MSRI Prize.

==Memberships==
Stokey is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and was a vice-president of the American Economic Association between 1996 and 1997. She has been a member of the American academy of Arts and Sciences since 1993, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences since 2004. She was also a member of the expert panel convened to produce a Copenhagen Consensus on some of the leading scientific/developmental problems of the 21st century. She has held editorial positions with top journals as &quot;Econometrica&quot;, &quot;The Journal of Economic Growth, Games and Economic Behavior&quot; and &quot;The Journal of Economic Theory&quot;. &quot; She has made fundamental contributions in microeconomics, economic theory, finance, and in macroeconomics, with a particular focus on the impact of whether or not economic agents have commitment power.&quot;

She was married to Nobel Prize Winner in Economics laureate Robert Lucas Jr. until his death in 2023.

<doc id="1198766" wikidata="Q1386159" url="?curid=1198766" title="Jack Scalia">
<text>Jack Scalia (born November 10, 1950) is an American actor. Scalia is perhaps best known for his frequent appearances in prime-time television series (both as a regular and as a guest-star) and television movies in the 1980s and 1990s, as well as feature films. 

==Early life==
Scalia was born Giacomo Tomaso Tedesco in Brooklyn, New York City, of Italian and Irish descent. His father was former Brooklyn Dodger Rocky Tedesco. His parents divorced and when his mother remarried his name was changed to Scalia. In 1969 he graduated from Brentwood High School on Long Island. He was drafted in the first round third overall by the Montreal Expos in 1971 as a pitcher. and moved to AA ball for his second year. However, he then sustained a shoulder injury and never got to play in the majors.

==Acting career==
After brief stints as a construction worker, and as a factory worker at Campbell&#x27;s, he began his career as a clothes model, most notably in a series of ads for Eminence briefs and Jordache jeans, both of which capitalized on his &quot;beefcake&quot; appeal. In 1982, to promote his TV series, &quot;The Devlin Connection&quot; where he plays Rock Hudson&#x27;s character&#x27;s son, Scalia took off his shirt and posed, cigarette in hand, for a pin-up wall poster.

Scalia was a regular cast member during the final season of &quot;Remington Steele&quot; in 1987, after which he joined the cast of &quot;Dallas&quot; in the role of Nicholas Pearce, love interest to Sue Ellen Ewing (Linda Gray). Scalia&#x27;s character was killed off at the end of the 1987–1988 season when he fell to his death after being pushed from a balcony during a fight with J. R. Ewing (Larry Hagman). He returned to the series finale in a dream sequence in which he was married to Sue Ellen.

From 1989 to 1990 he starred in another TV series, the CBS crime drama &quot;Wolf&quot;.

In 1992 Scalia was cast as Detective Nico &quot;Nick&quot; Bonetti in the short-lived television series &quot;Tequila and Bonetti&quot;. Scalia replaced another actor in the role during production of the show&#x27;s first episode. Eight years later, in 2000, Scalia reprised the role of Bonetti in a revival of the series, which was filmed and aired in Italy.

From 1994 to 1995 he starred in &quot;Pointman&quot;, a television series on the Prime Time Entertainment Network. He was an investment banker framed and convicted of fraud. When eventually cleared, Constantine &quot;Connie&quot; Harper becomes the owner of a Florida beach resort, Spanish Pete&#x27;s, and aids people in need with the use of former prison mates and &quot;the list&quot;.

Scalia is also known for his role as Chris Stamp on &quot;All My Children&quot; from 2001 to 2003. He was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Lead Actor&quot; for his &quot;AMC&quot; role in 2002. In 2006, Scalia starred as President Halstrom in &quot;The Genius Club&quot; for writer/director Tim Chey. The film is about seven geniuses who must try to solve the world&#x27;s problems in one night.

==Charity work==
===Operation American Spirit===
In 2007 Scalia co-founded Operation American Spirit with Edra Blixseth. The charity was founded to raise awareness and funding for severely injured troops and their families. In a press conference Scalia stated he started the charity in hopes of raising one hundred million dollars for wounded veterans.

The group organized two 1,500-mile bike rides which took place in 2007 and 2008. The rides took place along the West Coast and were intended to raise both awareness and charitable funds for wounded veterans. The tours made stops to interact with veterans at VA hospitals. The group claimed to have raised $88,937 in 2007 and $14,490 in 2008 according to tax filings, though no charitable recipients were ever revealed. According to a July 3, 2011 report by the &quot;New York Post&quot;, the IRS revoked the tax-exempt status from the &quot;9-11-01 Lest We Forget&quot; charitable group for failing to file a tax return in its decade of existence. That same year the Operation American Spirit charity was suspended by California authorities because of lapses in paying taxes and fees.

Scalia was not the financial chair of the non-profits and told the &quot;Post&quot; he &quot;couldn&#x27;t remember who received the money collected&quot; by the fundraising effort. His lawyer, Dennis Holahan, mentioned two charities which benefited. No legal recourse has been taken against Scalia, who has maintained his innocence. Co-founder and former billionaire Tim Blixseth, however, found himself in trouble with the law on projects outside of the charity.

===Coalition to Salute America&#x27;s Heroes===
In 2009, while filming &quot;The Black Tulip&quot;, Scalia spent time visiting servicemen and women. Since then he has been a host or speaker for various events on different military bases. He is currently an ambassador for the Coalition to Salute America&#x27;s Heroes. The Coalition is a 501(c)(3) charity dedicated to making the lives of wounded veterans returning home to be better prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.

Scalia continues to serve warriors everywhere, including participating in the 2016 Pearl Harbor 75th Anniversary Memorial Parade and hosting the 105th birthday celebration for WWII veteran Ray Chavez. Scalia met the 104-year-old Chavez on the USS &quot;Missouri&quot; in December 2016 when he hosted an event to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of Pearl Harbor (which included the governors of Hawaii and Arizona). After the event Scalia, 9/11 firefighter Joe Torrillo, and patriotic rocker Jeff Senour came up with the ultimate honor for Chavez. On March 11, 2017, more than 600 people were treated to a patriotic concert in Chavez&#x27; honor, as the oldest living Pearl Harbor veteran was showered with presents, a four-foot cake, letters from one sitting and four past U.S. Presidents, and an outpouring of love and national media attention.

In a 2017 interview on &quot;Good Day New York&quot;, Scalia talked about his multiple tours to Mosul for humanitarian missions.

==Personal life==
He was previously married to former model Joan Rankin and to 1982 Miss Universe Karen Baldwin, with whom he has two daughters.

<text>Matthew Bright (born June 8, 1952) is a former film director, writer and actor.

His first credits were as writer and actor in Richard Elfman&#x27;s 1980 film &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot;, portraying the twins Squeezit and René Henderson. The film includes his two sado-masochistic characters living in a garbage can, spit on, raped and tortured in an alternate dimension&#x27;s kingdom and decapitated by Satan (played by Bright&#x27;s real-life friend, composer Danny Elfman).

Bright wrote and directed the 1996 exploitation film &quot;Freeway&quot; and its 1999 direct-to-video sequel.

In his last work, &quot;Tiptoes&quot;, Bright&#x27;s original 150-minute cut was reduced to 90 minutes by his producers without his consent, leading to him vocally criticizing the producers on stage. Following this 2003 production&#x27;s negative reception, he has not directed any further films.

<doc id="1198781" wikidata="Q4932643" url="?curid=1198781" title="Bob Hagan">
<text>Robert F. Hagan (born March 31, 1949) is an American politician and member of the Democratic Party who held a seat in the Ohio House of Representatives for the 58th District from 2007 to 2014. He represented the same seat from 1987 to 1997, and served in the Ohio Senate from 1997 to 2006.

In 2014, he began work for the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen governmental affairs team.

==Early life, family and education==
Hagan was born and raised in Youngstown, Ohio. He attended Ursuline High School. His father, Robert E. Hagan, was also involved in politics. His brother, Tim Hagan, served for many years as a county commissioner in Cuyahoga County, Ohio and was the 2002 Democratic nominee for Governor of Ohio.

Before entering electoral politics, Hagan worked for 15 years as a locomotive engineer for CSX Transportation.

==Career==

===First Ohio House of Representatives sitting===
In 1986, he was elected to a seat in the Ohio House of Representatives, representing the 53rd Ohio House district, centered on Youngstown, Ohio. At the time, his father, Robert E. Hagan, was also serving in the House. Between 1986 and 1990, the Hagans were the first father and son to simultaneously hold seats in the Ohio House of Representatives. Hagan served in the House for ten years.

===Ohio Senate===
When incumbent Joseph Vukovich was appointed to a judiciary position in 1997, Hagan was chosen to succeed him in the Ohio Senate. He was appointed to the State Senate on February 12, 1997, to represent the 33rd district in northeastern Ohio, centered on the city of Youngstown. During his time in there, he was chosen by the Senate Democratic caucus to serve as assistant minority whip in the 126th Ohio General Assembly; however, he stepped down from his leadership post when he entered the election for State Representative.

In 2005, Hagan ran for mayor of Youngstown, hoping to replace outgoing mayor George McKelvey. Although initially favored to win, he was soundly defeated by independent candidate Jay Williams. 
A strong proponent of progressive policies, Hagan occasionally uses satire to attempt to make a point. In February 2006, he placed a spoof request for co-sponsors for a fictional piece of legislation called the &quot;Republican Adoption Ban of 2006.&quot; The bill was meant as a response to HB 515, which was a ban on adoption by homosexual or bisexual people or couples, and in presenting the fake legislation Hagan cited so-called &quot;credible research&quot; indicating that children in Republican households had a host of emotional problems.

In April 2010, Bob Hagan co-sponsored a measure to legalize marijuana in Ohio.

===Second Ohio House of Representatives sitting===
Unsuccessful in his bid for Mayor of Youngstown, Hagan sought to return to Ohio House of Representatives to succeed term limited Sylvester &quot;Sly&quot; Patton. Against six others for the nomination, Hagan won the primary with 37.59% of the vote. He won the general election with 58.08% of the vote against Republican John Johnson. Hagan, in 2008, won reelection with 84.9% of the vote again Republican Timothy Gordon.

Facing primary opposition for a third term in 2010, Hagan defeated Don Hanni with 70.59% of the vote for the nomination. He won the general election with 81.23% of the vote over Republican Daniel Thimons. For the 129th General Assembly, Hagan served on the committees of Commerce and Labor; Health and Aging; and Transportation, Public Safety and Homeland Security. He also served on the Midwest Interstate Passenger Rail Commission.

Hagan won a final term in 2012 unopposed, and was term-limited in 2014. He was succeeded by his wife Michele Lepore-Hagan.

==2016 U.S. Senate election==

On April 17, 2013, Hagan announced his candidacy for the United States Senate seat currently occupied by Republican Rob Portman. He cited Portman&#x27;s vote against background checks as his motive for challenging the freshman senator.

==Policies and initiatives==

===Collective bargaining===
With the city of Youngstown being majorly pro-labor, Hagan had been against a bill that looks to limit collective bargaining for public employees. While it was virtually inevitable that the bill will pass into law, Hagan vowed to lead an effort to overthrow it via a referendum. A member of the committee hearing the bill, Hagan presented his colleagues with 65,000 petitions from individuals opposing the bill, which were ordered removed from the room by chairman Joe Uecker. Hagan has cited a considerable amount of secrecy and partisanship surrounding the legislation. He has called the bill simply a bust to unions. The bill ultimately passed the entire legislature.

===Governor recall===
Building off his opposition to S.B. 5, Hagan introduced legislation with Michael Foley that would allow voters to recall the governor, other statewide officeholders and members of the General Assembly. They stated that the measure was initiated by John Kasich&#x27;s low approval ratings and the outcry that occurred after S.B. 5.

===Environmental issues===
A staunch liberal, Hagan is against measures that would allow drilling for oil and natural gas in Ohio state parks. In debate on the bill, which went on to pass the Ohio House of Representatives, he went on to question whether Republicans who supported the measure were on drugs. 
Hagan has also sought to fight gasoline prices through legislation to create the Ohio Gasoline Price Oversight Commission. Along with Ron Gerberry, Hagan hopes to help fight rising gasoline prices. &quot;This legislation is a direct response to the sacrifice our constituents are making at the pumps,&quot; Rep. Hagan said.

===Other===
On October 22, 2012, Hagan introduced a bill in the Ohio House that would prohibit any team playing in publicly financed stadiums or arenas from blacking out games. A violation would result in the team repaying its public funding.

==Controversies==
In 2010, Hagan was assaulted at the Lemon Grove, a bar located in Youngstown, Ohio. He was punched in the face after a verbal altercation with a fellow customer, and was treated with several stitches at a local hospital after regaining consciousness.

On January 20, 2011 it was reported that Hagan had referred to someone during an online debate on Facebook as a &quot;buckwheat&quot;, a word that some consider to have racist connotations. It was not directed at Thomas. Hagan said &quot;buckwheat&quot; was a term he had been using &quot;since he was a kid&quot; and that it no longer carried racial connotation for him.

On April 27, 2012, Hagan was uninvited to speak at the graduation ceremony of Mercy College School of Nursing at the request of Bishop George Murry, S.J. of Youngstown, just four days before the graduation was to take place. Bishop Murry cited stance on abortion as the reasons for his decision.

On April 21, 2022, Hagan stated on Twitter that he had a photo of Michael Rulli engaging in sexual relations with former President Donald Trump.

On April 28, 2022, Hagan used disparaging comments on the social media platform Twitter, including referring to them as &quot;right-wing troglodytes.&quot; His tweet went on to claim that Republicans &quot;jerk off to Mein Kampf&quot;

On August 28, 2022, a Hagan for State Senate sign was found burnt in Youngstown&#x27;s Wick Park neighborhood. In response, Hagan blamed &quot;extremist cowards&quot; for the act of vandalism, stating &quot;This is emblematic of the violent anarchy of the Republican ruling class.&quot;. In response, his opponent, Senator Rulli, denied involvement, alleging the act was an &quot;inside job&quot; by the Hagan campaign and offered a $5,000 reward to anyone who could provide video evidence of who burnt the sign.

On September 15, 2022, Senator Rulli alleged that Hagan had entered his family&#x27;s grocery store, Rulli Brothers, and harassed customers on September 12. Hagan denied these allegations, stating that the man in the security camera footage was not him and accused Rulli of &quot;endangering [his] family&quot; and &quot;inciting violence&quot; against him. On September 30, Hagan filed a cease-and-desist order to remove the video from social media and provided evidence that he was at home during the alleged incident.

<doc id="1198782" wikidata="Q6863439" url="?curid=1198782" title="Mind Blowin'">
<text>Mind Blowin&#x27; is the second studio album by American rapper Vanilla Ice. Released on March 22, 1994, it is the rapper&#x27;s final release on SBK Records. The album did not chart and received unfavorable reviews. Songs from the album made up one third of Vanilla Ice&#x27;s tours during 1992–2010. The album shifted just 42,000 copies in the United States, a massive drop in comparison to his blockbuster debut album &quot;To the Extreme&quot;. Despite this, lead single &quot;Roll &#x27;Em Up&quot; received some airplay in Europe.

Ice followed up this album with 1998&#x27;s &quot;Hard to Swallow&quot;.

== Lyrics ==
Cyco of Insane Poetry worked on 10 songs on the album.

&quot;The Wrath&quot;, one of the album&#x27;s singles, was a reply to the single &quot;Pop Goes the Weasel&quot; by 3rd Bass.

Mark Wahlberg, then in the rap group Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, had made negative remarks about Ice in one of his songs. Ice answered back in the song &quot;Hit &#x27;Em Hard&quot; which was mostly a diss track aimed at Mark, but Ice also included 3rd Bass and MC Hammer. Neither 3rd Bass nor Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch responded.

A lot of the lyrics were drug influenced and featured references to smoking marijuana, especially in the single &quot;Roll &#x27;em Up&quot;. The song &quot;I Go Down&quot; pays tribute to Gang Starr, Mary J. Blige and Tupac Shakur.

== Reception ==
Reviews were unfavorable. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer James Bernard called the album &quot;more clunky than funky&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Danyel Smith called the song &quot;Get Loose&quot; &quot;snappy&quot;, writing that although the lyrics are &quot;inane&quot;, &quot;the song is a thumping party, one of the few places where Ice loosens up. He sounds solid at the beginning of &#x27;The Wrath&#x27; as well [...] He sounds easy and unaffected – close to sexy. But he doesn&#x27;t keep it up: In &#x27;Now and Forever,&#x27; a wet dream kind of song, Ice goes back to goofy lyrics [...] and his dry Max Headroom style.&quot; AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that &quot;There isn&#x27;t a single moment that establishes a distinct musical identity, and the whole thing is rather embarrassing.&quot;

The album was named the &quot;Least Essential Album Showcasing An Image Makeover&quot; in The A.V. Club&#x27;s list of the &quot;Least Essential Albums of the &#x27;90s,&quot; cited as &quot;an album that inspired almost no one to roll up the hootie mack, as instructed in its first single.&quot;

<doc id="1198783" wikidata="Q743943" url="?curid=1198783" title="Tachylite">
<text>Tachylite ( ; also spelled tachylyte) is a form of basaltic volcanic glass. This glass is formed naturally by the rapid cooling of molten basalt. It is a type of mafic igneous rock that is decomposable by acids and readily fusible. The color is a black or dark-brown, and it has a greasy-looking, resinous luster. It is very brittle and occurs in dikes, veins, and intrusive masses. The word originates from the Ancient Greek , meaning &quot;swift&quot;.

Tachylites have the appearance of pitch and are often more or less vesicular and sometimes spherulitic. They are very brittle and break down readily under a hammer. Small crystals of feldspar or olivine are sometimes visible in them with the unaided eye. All tachylites weather rather easily and by oxidation of their iron become dark brown or red. Three modes of occurrence characterize this rock. In all cases they are found under conditions which imply rapid cooling, but they are much less common than acid volcanic glasses (or obsidians), the reason being apparently that the basic rocks have a stronger tendency to crystallize, partly because they are more liquid and the molecules have more freedom to arrange themselves in crystalline order.

Tachylite can be distinguished from obsidian and pitchstone by determining its fusibility, as splinters of tachylite will fuse together when heated.

==Geologic occurrences==

===Scoria sources===
The fine scoria ashes or &quot;cinders&quot; thrown out by basaltic volcanoes are often spongy masses of tachylite with only a few larger crystals or phenocrysts imbedded in black glass. Such tachylite volcanic bombs and scoria are frequent in Iceland, Auvergne, Stromboli and Etna, and are very common also in the ash beds or tuffs of older date, such as occur in Skye, Midlothian and Fife, Derbyshire, and elsewhere. Basic pumices of this kind are exceedingly widespread on the bottom of the sea, either dispersed in the pelagic red clay and other deposits or forming layers coated with oxides of manganese precipitated on them from the sea water. These tachylite fragments, which are usually much decomposed by the oxidation and hydration of their ferrous compounds, have taken on a dark red color. This altered basic glass is known as &quot;palagonite&quot;; concentric bands of it often surround kernels of unaltered tachylite, and are so soft that they are easily cut with a knife. In the palagonite the minerals are also decomposed and are represented only by pseudomorphs. The fresh tachylite glass, however, often contains lozenge-shaped crystals of plagioclase feldspar and small prisms of augite and olivine, but all these minerals very frequently occur mainly as microlites or as skeletal growths with sharply-pointed corners or ramifying processes. Palagonite tuffs are found also among the older volcanic rocks. In Iceland a broad stretch of these rocks, described as &quot;the palagonite formation,&quot; is said to cross the island from south-west to north-east. Some of these tuffs are fossiliferous; others are intercalated with glacial deposits. The lavas with which they occur are mostly olivine-basalts. Palagonite tuffs are found in Sicily, the Eifel, Hungary, Canary Islands, and other places.

===Lava flow sources===
A second mode of occurrence of tachylite is in the form of lava flows. Basaltic rocks often contain a small amount of glassy ground-mass, and in the limburgites this becomes more important and conspicuous, but vitreous types are far less common in these than in the acid lavas. 

Tachylite may form at the edge of sills or thin dikes of basalt or diabase that rapidly cooled. Such edges may be as little as a millimetre thick. It merges internally into crystalline basalt.

In the Hawaiian Islands, however, the volcanoes have poured out vast floods of black basalt, containing feldspar, augite, olivine, and iron ores in a black glassy base. They are highly liquid when discharged, and the rapid cooling that ensues on their emergence to the air prevents crystallization taking place completely. Many of them are spongy or vesicular, and their upper surfaces are often exceedingly rough and jagged, while at other times they assume rounded wave-like forms on solidification. Great caves are found where the crust has solidified and the liquid interior has subsequently flowed away, and stalactites and stalagmites of black tachylite adorn the roofs and floors. On section these growths show usually a central cavity enclosed by walls of dark brown glass in which skeletons and microliths of augite, olivine and feldspar lie imbedded. From the crater of Mt. Kilauea, thin clouds of steam rise constantly, and as the bubbles of vapor are liberated from the molten rock they carry into the air with them thin fibers of basalt that solidify at once and assume the form of tachylite threads. Under the microscope they prove to be nearly completely glassy with small circular air vesicles sometimes drawn out to long tubes. Only in the Hawaiian Islands are glassy basaltic lavas of this kind at all common. A small outcrop at Spring Hill in Victoria, Australia has tachylite which has been exploited as a material for making Aboriginal flaked stone implements.

===Dike and sill sources===

A third mode of occurrence of tachylite is as the margins and thin offshoots of dikes or sills of basalt and diabase. They are sometimes only a fraction of an inch in thickness, resembling a thin layer of pitch or tar on the edge of a crystalline diabase dike, but veins several inches thick are sometimes found. In these situations tachylite is rarely vesicular, but it often shows very pronounced fluxion banding accentuated by the presence of rows of spherulites that are visible as dark brown rounded spots. The spherulites have a distinct radiate structure and sometimes exhibit zones of varying color. The non-spherulitic glassy portion is sometimes perlitic, and these rocks are always brittle. Common crystals are olivine, augite and feldspar, with swarms of minute dusty black grains of magnetite. At the extreme edges the glass is often perfectly free from crystalline products, but it merges rapidly into the ordinary crystalline diabase, which in a very short distance may contain no vitreous base whatever. The spherulites may form the greater part of the mass, they may be a quarter of an inch in diameter and are occasionally much larger than this. These coarsely spherulitic rocks pass over into the variolites by increasing coarseness in the fibers of their spherulites, which soon become recognizable as needles of feldspar or feathery growths of augite. The ultimate product of decomposition in this case also is a red palagonitic substance, but owing to the absence of steam cavities the tachylite selvages of dikes are more often found in a fresh state than the basic lapilli in ash-beds. Many occurrences of basaltic pitchstones have been reported from Skye, Mull, and the western part of Scotland; they are found also in connection with the intrusive diabase sills in the north of England and the center of Scotland. In the Saar district of Germany similar rocks occur, some of which have been described as weisselbergites (from Weisselberg).

Other localities for tachylites of this group are New Providence, Silesia and Sweden.

<text>The Pyongyang Metro () is the rapid transit system in Pyongyang, the capital and largest city of North Korea. It consists of two lines: the Chollima Line, which runs north from Puhŭng Station on the banks of the Taedong River to Pulgŭnbyŏl Station, and the Hyŏksin Line, which runs from Kwangbok Station in the southwest to Ragwŏn Station in the northeast. The two lines intersect at Chŏnu Station.

Daily ridership is estimated to be between 300,000 and 700,000. Structural engineering of the Metro was completed by North Korea, with rolling stock and related electronic equipment imported from China. This was later replaced with used rolling stock acquired from Berlin U-Bahn.

The Pyongyang Metro has a museum devoted to its construction and history.

==Construction==

Construction of the metro network started in 1965, and stations were opened between 1969 and 1972 by Supreme Leader Kim Il Sung. Most of the 16 public stations were built in the 1970s, except for the two most grandiose stations—Puhŭng and Yŏnggwang, which were constructed in 1987. According to NK News sources, a construction accident in 1971 killed tens if not hundreds of laborers, forcing the rerouting of the metro so it would not cross the Taedong River.

China had provided technical aid for the metro&#x27;s construction, sending experts to install equipment made in China, including electrical equipment made in Xiangtan, Hunan and the escalator with vertical height of 64 m made by Shanghai Seleva.

Pyongyang Metro is among the deepest metros in the world, with the track at over deep underground; the metro does not have any above-ground track segments or stations. Due to the depth of the metro and the lack of outside segments, its stations can double as bomb shelters, with blast doors in place at hallways. It takes three and a half minutes from the ground to the platform by escalator. The metro is so deep that the temperature of the platform maintains a constant all year. The Saint Petersburg Metro also claims to be the deepest, based on the average depth of all its stations. The Hongyancun station on Chongqing Rail Transit&#x27;s Line 9 is currently the deepest station in the world at . The deepest heavy rail station in the world is the Jerusalem–Yitzhak Navon railway station, located underground. The Porta Alpina railway station, located above the Gotthard Base Tunnel in Switzerland, was supposed to be underground, but the project was indefinitely shelved in 2012.

The system was initially electrified at 825 volts, but lowered down to 750 volts to support operation of the Class GI sets. However, this conflicts with the documentation on the DK4 sets, which uses 750 volts with a +20% and a -38% tolerance.

A 1999 KBS news broadcast stated that two lines were under construction, with line 3 to run from Kwangbok station to Mangyongdae, while the location of line 4 was unknown. The two lines were to open for the 55th Party Foundation Day.

In 2012, Korean Central Television released renders of a new station bearing the name Mangyongdae displayed at the Pyongyang Architectural Festival.

In 2018, NK News claimed that there would be possible extensions to the metro system, with anonymous sources claiming activity to the west of Kwangbok Station. Commercial satellite imagery revealed only one structure under construction, and it speculated an absence of announcements from state media was due to funding issues, as well as due to the 1970s tunneling accidents.

In 2019, Kaeson station and Moranbong station were modernised, adding TVs that show the next service and brighter lighting. This was followed by Jonu station and Chonsung station in 2020. The TVs can also display a digital version of the Rodong Sinmun.

At the 8th Congress of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea, it was announced to push forward on the updating and renovation of the Pyongyang Metro, along with the production of new-type subway trains.

==Operation==

The Pyongyang Metro was designed to operate every few minutes. During rush hour, the trains can operate at a minimum interval of two minutes. The trains have the ability to play music and other recordings. In current service, they run at every 3 minutes in rush hour and every 5 minutes throughout the day. It operates from 5:30 am to 11:30 pm.

The Pyongyang Metro is the cheapest in the world to ride, at only five North Korean won (worth half of a US cent) per ticket. Instead of paper tickets, the Metro previously used an aluminium token, with the emblem of the Metro minted on it and the Korean &quot;. It has used a paper ticket system, with &quot; printed with blue ink on it. Tickets are bought at station booths. Nowadays, the network uses contactless cards that feature the logo of the network and a train set on the front, with the terms and conditions on the other side. Gates display the number of trips remaining on the card, with a trip being a tap on entry and exit. Smoking and eating inside the Metro system is prohibited and is punishable by a large fine.

===Network===

The Pyongyang Metro network consists of two lines:
* Chollima Line, named after a winged horse from ancient Korean mythology. It spans about . Construction started in 1968, and the line opened on September 6, 1973. The total route contains the Puhung, Yonggwang, Ponghwa, Sŭngni, Moranbong, Kaeson, Jonu, and Pulgunbyol stations.
* Hyŏksin Line, which literally means &quot;renewal&quot;, spans about . Regular service started on October 9, 1975. The route contains the Kwangbok, Konguk, Hwanggumbol, Konsol, Hyoksin, Jonsung, Samhung, and Rakwon stations. The closed Kwangmyong station is located between the Samhung and Rakwon stations.
The two lines have a linking track, located somewhere near Jonsung station.

Most metro stations bear reference to nearby features, with Kaesŏn Station (&quot;Triumph station&quot;) being located at the Arch of Triumph, Yonggwang station located near Yonggwang street, Sungni station at Sungni street.

The network runs entirely underground. The design of the network was based on metro networks in other communist countries, in particular the Moscow Metro. Both networks share many characteristics, such as the great depth of the lines (over ) and the large distances between stations. Another common feature is the Socialist realist art on display in the stations - such as murals and statues. Staff of the Metro have a military-style uniform that is specific to these workers. Each Metro station has a free toilet for use by patrons. Stations also play state radio-broadcasts and have a display of the &quot;Rodong Sinmun&quot; newspaper.

In times of war, the metro stations can serve as bomb shelters. For this purpose the stations are fitted with large steel doors. Some sources claim that large military installations are connected to the stations, and also that there exist secret lines solely for government use.

One station, Kwangmyŏng, has been closed since 1995 due to the mausoleum of Kim Il-sung being located at that station. Trains do not stop at that station.

The map of the Hyŏksin line shows two additional stations after Kwangbok: Yŏngung () and Ch&#x27;ilgol (), both of them reportedly under development. The map of the Chollima Line, on the other hand, shows four additional stations, two at each end of the line—Ryŏnmot (), Sŏp&#x27;o (), Ch&#x27;ŏngch&#x27;un () and Man&#x27;gyŏngdae ()—also planned or under development. However, the most recent maps omit these stations. The Chollima line is already connected to the State Railway Sopo station on the way to the metro depot, and plans of the metro seem to suggest that the non-commercial segment of this line would be eventually part of the metro system. However, the current tunnel exit does not allow for this, as this segment does not have third rail electrification, and is locomotive hauled by the GKD5B shunters and would require negotiating a switchback.

In addition to the main system for passenger use, there is allegedly an extra system for government use, similar to Moscow&#x27;s Metro-2. The secret Pyongyang system supposedly connects important government locations. There is also reportedly a massive underground plaza for mobilization, as well as an underground road connecting two metro stations.

==Rolling stock==
When operations on the Metro started in the 1970s, newly built DK4 passenger cars were used, made for North Korea by the Chinese firm Changchun Railway Vehicles.

Some of the Chinese-made rolling stock have been observed operating near the Sinuiju area and northern regions.

Since 1997, the Pyongyang Metro has mainly used former German rolling stock from the Berlin U-Bahn.

The former Berlin trainsets were given a new red and cream livery in Pyongyang. All advertising was removed and replaced by portraits of leaders, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. In 2000, a BBC reporter saw &quot;old East German trains complete with their original German graffiti&quot;. Koryo Tours in another article write about and show the old West-Berlin D-trains, suggesting that the BBC article could have mixing them up with the Class GI of East Berlin. After about 2006, Type D cars were mainly used. The Class GI rolling stock has been banned from underground tunnel operations due to frequent control stand fires and was withdrawn from Metro service in 2001, and those cars are now operating on the railway network around Pyongyang and northern regions as commuter trains. One Type D metro car appears to have been converted into a departmental vehicle, with a subsequently installed second driver&#x27;s cab at the car&#x27;s back next to the inter carriage door. The metro car is painted in yellow with red warning trims.

In 2015, Kim Jong Un rode a newly manufactured four car train set which was reported to have been developed and built at Kim Chong-t&#x27;ae Electric Locomotive Works in North Korea, although the cars appeared to be significantly renovated D-class cars. This set is named &#x27;Underground Electric Vehicle No. 1&#x27;. It features a VVVF control and initially fitted with an asynchronous motor but later replaced with a permanent magnet synchronous motor developed by the Kim Chaek University of Technology. It usually runs on the Chollima Line but has also ran on the Hyoksin Line.

As a gift to the 8th Congress of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea, it is reported that the Kim Chong-t&#x27;ae Electric Locomotive Works are working to complete new metro cars, promoted by the 80 day campaign. However, in the Korean Central News Agency article summarising the eighty day campaign, there was no mention of any new vehicles being produced. Previously, it was reported that a 4-door set was to be manufactured to mainly run on the Hyoksin line, to be named Underground Electric Vehicle No. 2. Another news report stated that Kim Chong-tae Locomotive Works was organising the serial production of the Underground Electric Vehicle Type 1 for the 80 day campaign and mentioned the construction of the car body. However, although this was a goal of the 80 day campaign, a new set has yet to be built.


==Tourism==

In general, tourism in North Korea is allowed only in guided groups with no diversion allowed from pre-planned itineraries. Foreign tourists used to be allowed to travel only between Puhŭng Station and Yŏnggwang Station. However, foreign students were allowed to freely use the entire metro system. Since 2010, tourists have been allowed to ride the metro at six stations, and in 2014, all of the metro stations were opened to foreigners. University students traveling with the Pyongyang Project have also reported visiting every station.

, it is possible for tourists on special Public Transport Tours to take metro rides through both lines, including visits to all stations. In April 2014, the first tourist group visited stations on both metro lines, and it is expected that such extended visits to both metro lines will remain possible for future tourist groups.

The previously limited tourist access gave rise to a conspiracy theory that the metro was purely for show. It was claimed that it only consisted of two stops and that the passengers were actors.

===Museum===
Pyongyang Metro has its own museum. A large portion of the collection is related to President Kim Il Sung providing &quot;on-the-spot guidance&quot; to the workers constructing the system. Among the exhibits are a special funicular-like vehicle which the president used to descend to a station under construction (it rode down the inclined tunnels that would eventually be used by the escalators), and a railbus in which he rode around the system. The museum also has a map of the planned lines; it shows the Chollima and Hyoksin line terminating at a common station near Chilgol, the third line that would cross the Taedong River, eventually terminating near Rakrang and the locations of the depots, one far past the western terminus of the Hyoksin line and the depot in Sopo for the Chollima line.

<text>Derek Keith Barbosa(April 8, 1974 – July 28, 2024), better known by his stage name Chino XL, was an American rapper and actor. He released five solo studio albums. His album &quot;&quot; (2012) won the 2012 HHUG Album of the Year Award.

In addition to his music career, Barbosa acted in numerous films and on television and subsequently appearing as a guest star on the Comedy Central series &quot;Reno 911!&quot;, and CBS series &quot;&quot;. His feature film credits include a co-starring role opposite Kate Hudson and Luke Wilson in director Rob Reiner&#x27;s &quot;Alex &amp; Emma&quot; (Warner Bros. Pictures) and several indie films, including Brandon Sonnier&#x27;s &quot;The Beat&quot;, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.

Barbosa was the nephew of Bernie Worrell of the music group Parliament/Funkadelic, and was also a member of Mensa International.

== Early life ==
Born in The Bronx, New York, Derek Barbosa grew up in East Orange, New Jersey. His father, who was of Puerto Rican descent, his mother was African American, and he was raised by a single mother.

== Career ==
After co-founding the duo Art of Origin with Kerri Chandler, &quot;Chino XL&quot; (as he was called from then on) was signed at age 16 by music impresario Rick Rubin to his American Recordings label, at the time a member of the Warner Bros. Records family. Barbosa released his debut album &quot;Here to Save You All&quot; in 1996, to critical acclaim. The lead single &quot;Kreep&quot;, which featured an interpolation of the Radiohead song &quot;Creep&quot; received major airplay by radio and MTV. &quot;Kreep&quot; charted on the Billboard Bubbling Under R&amp;B Chart for a record 23 weeks, from July 1996 to January 1997.

Chino was released from his American Recordings contract when the label switched distributors from Warner Bros. Records to Columbia Records in 1997. Warner then signed Chino in the fall of 1997. His second album was due to come out in April 1999 but numerous delays prevented this. In early 2001, when the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Let &#x27;Em Live&quot; featuring Kool G Rap was about to appear, Chino was dropped by Warner, as they folded their Black music department, allegedly due to the public legal battle with Prince. The album was eventually released in 2001 by Metro Records under the title &quot;I Told You So&quot;.

In 2000, Chino pursued an acting career. He found success, Making guest appearances on multiple popular television series, indie films and Warner Bros. Pictures “Alex &amp; Emma” by acclaimed director Rob Reiner. Castro and Chino executive produced his long-awaited 2006 studio album (his 3rd), &quot;Poison Pen&quot;
The album introduced the iconic classic “Wordsmith”, and featured appearances by Proof of D-12, Killah Priest and hip hop duo The Beatnuts.

In 2007, Chino signed a contract with the Universal Latino label Machete Music.

In 2009, Chino&#x27;s fourth album &quot;RICANstruction&quot; was released via his own joint venture CPR/Universal. It featured appearances by Immortal Technique, Tech N9ne, and Bun B and was produced by DJ Khalil, with 5x Grammy winner Focus acting as executive producer.

On August 19, 2011, a song titled &quot;N.I.C.E.&quot;, produced by Nick Wiz, was released.

On September 25, 2012, the album &quot;&quot; was released as a double disc through Immortal Technique&#x27;s Viper Records. It won the 2012 HHUG Album of the Year award 

On June 15, 2013, Shanghai :30 Entertainment booked a show with Chino XL for him to play alongside local, on-the-rise hip hop artists.

In 2014, he formed a hip hop supergroup along with rappers Vakill, Copywrite, Tame One and producer Stu Bangas called &quot;Verse 48&quot;. They started working on an EP.

In 2015, he was featured on UK singer/rapper RKZ&#x27;s single &#x27;They Don&#x27;t Know Nothing&#x27;.

In late 2019, Freemusicempire wrote that Chino XL is &quot;The greatest name-checker in rap history&quot; Dan-O wrote &quot;Chino XL has a career full of jaw dropping name drops that don&#x27;t benefit him at all. In 1996 he was clowning OJ Simpson, in 2012 he was making fun of Muhammed Ali&#x27;s brain stem. If you are going to drop the name of someone important do 2 things for me A.) don&#x27;t walk it back and apologize B.) make it heinous. Do it out of an unparalleled fearlessness. Shake the world up so the people who feel safe don&#x27;t anymore….and when the consequences come take them like a seasoned criminal takes a sentence. Or don&#x27;t do it at all.&quot;

In December 2020, he released a joint extended play &quot;Chino vs. Balt&quot; with Balt Getty, under Purplehaus Records.

In 2022, it was reported he was working on a new album, which would include a collaboration with R.A. the Rugged Man.

In 2023, Chino XL reunited with Stu Bangas to release the LP &quot;God’s Carpenter&quot;, a 12-song album featuring Vinnie Paz on the single &quot;Murder Rhyme Kill&quot;. Additional singles included &quot;AMBImonsterous&quot; and the title track &quot;God’s Carpenter&quot;.

Shortly before his death, he, along with KXNG Crooked, Canibus and La the Darkman, contributed to Rakim&#x27;s album &quot;G.O.Ds NETWORK: REB7RTH&quot; on the song &quot;Pendulum Swing&quot;.

<text>Bu Laʻia (born as Shawn Kaui Hill in Waimanalo, Hawaii) is a Hawaiian comedian known for his use of Hawaiian pidgin and for wearing a large &quot;afro style&quot; wig and blacking out one of his front teeth while performing. He starred in a cable television show in the early 1990s and released two comic musical albums entitled &quot;False Crack???&quot; And &quot;Hawaii&#x27;s Most Wanted.&quot; He also attained fame—or notoriety—when he ran for governor of Hawaiʻi in 1994 (when he was too young to legally do so) and again as a member of the Natural Law Party in 2002. He also attracted attention when he was arrested for riding a skateboard at Honolulu International Airport. Bu is pidgin for &quot;Bull&quot;. The name &quot;Bu Laʻia&quot; is a homophone of &quot;Bull Liar&quot;, a phrase meaning &quot;an outrageous liar&quot;. His name is reminiscent of the character created by Hawaiian comedian Kent Bowman, “K.K. Kaumanua” (K.K. Cow–Manure) famous for his &quot;Pidgin English Children&#x27;s Stories,&quot; although Bowman&#x27;s character uses the pidgin English of an earlier generation.</text><links>

<doc id="1198809" wikidata="Q3131070" url="?curid=1198809" title="Variolite">
<text>Variolites are mafic, igneous, and typically volcanic rocks, e.g. tholeiite, basalt or komatiite, that contain centimeter-scale spherical or globular structures, called &quot;varioles&quot;, in a fine-grained matrix. These structures are lighter colored than the host rock and typically range in diameter from 0.05mm to over 5 cm. In 1648, Aldrovandi created the term &quot;variolite&quot; for aphanitic or fine-grained igneous rocks containing varioles. The weathering of varioles often cause variolites to have a pock-marked appearance. In allusion to the pock-marked appearance of weathered surfaces of variolite, this term is derived from the Latin word, &quot;variola&quot;, for smallpox.

Varioles are millimeter- to centimeter-scale, light-colored, globular to spherical structures, that are conspicuously observable within aphanitic, mafic igneous rocks, such as basalt, komatiite, and tachylite, that comprise either pillow lavas, subaerial lava flows, or volcanic dykes. Typically, they are less resistant to weathering than the enclosing aphanitic rock and, as a result, form pock-marks on the weathered surfaces of mafic rocks.

In the geologic literature, the usage of the term &quot;variole&quot; has been inconsistent and confusing. Initially, they were defined as spherical masses, which may or may not be spherulites, that are observed on the weathering surfaces of some basalts and diabases. In some modern literature, the term &quot;variole&quot; is defined as a type of spherulite that occurs in a mafic rock. However, because several different mechanisms can produce these small-scale, light-colored, globular to spherical structures, a specific set of varioles may or may not be spherulites that are composed of radiating crystals of either plagioclase or pyroxene. As a result, it is recommended that the term &quot;variole&quot; should be retained as originally defined. This definition is useful, not only because varioles may arise through several different mechanisms, but also because the alteration, specifically mineralization, and deformation associated with many Precambrian volcanic rocks, particularly Archean volcanic rocks, makes the determination of their origin difficult, if not impossible, without further laboratory analyses. Phillips (1973) provides a detailed review of the nomenclature of different types of varioles that have been proposed. Confusingly, a few Earth scientists use &quot;variolite&quot; as if it is synonymous with &quot;variole&quot;.

Petrographic and geochemical analyses of varioles demonstrates that they can be the result of one of three possible processes. They are the blotchy alteration of a fine-grained igneous rock; the mingling of magma from two distinctly different sources; and the alteration and degradation of plagioclase spherulites. These analyses also found that their internal organization and geochemistry is incompatible with the hypothesis that they are quenched immiscible liquids, as has been suggested in the past by various authors.

==Varieties and occurrence==
The variety of mafic igneous rocks that contain varioles are, with rare exceptions, no longer classified as &quot;variolites&quot;, which is not recommended for usage. Instead, they are designated using the modifier variolitic in conjunction with the major lithology. The major varieties of &quot;variolites&quot; are variolitic basalts, variolitic pillow lavas and variolitic komatiites. Variolitic pillow lavas, that have been previously identified as &quot;variolites&quot; and also classified as spilites, are found in the Durance, France; on Mont Genvre, France; in Devonian rocks of Germany; and as cobbles on the beaches of the Strait of Juan de Fuca along the northern edge of the Olympic Peninsula. Variolitic basalts and variolitic komatiites occur commonly as Archean lava flows in the greenstone belts of South Africa and the Canadian Shield. Finally, there is a group of spotted volcanic rocks formerly known to French petrographers as the &quot;variolites du Drac&quot; from the locality in which they are found in Parc National des Ecrins, France. Additional research has found them to be hydrothermally altered basalt volcanic rocks that contain amygdules filled with white calcite and other secondary minerals.

<text>The National Postal Museum, located in Washington, D.C., is the primary postal museum of the United States. It covers large portions of the postal history of the United States and other countries. It was established through joint agreement between the United States Postal Service and the Smithsonian Institution and opened in 1993.

==Premises==
The museum is located in the building that served as the main post office of Washington, D.C. for decades, from its construction in 1914 until 1986. The building was designed by the Graham and Burnham architectural firm, which was led by Ernest Graham following the death of Daniel Burnham in 1912. The headquarters of the United States Department of Labor&#x27;s Bureau of Labor Statistics is based in this building, and there is also space for a data center for the United States Senate. It is located across the street from Washington Union Station.

==Displays==
The museum&#x27;s atrium features vehicles used to deliver mail throughout the history of the USPS, including planes, trains and automobiles. Historical exhibits guide visitors through the postal service&#x27;s inception and expansion, as well as its role in significant national events such as World War II. &quot;Systems at Work&quot; explores historic and current technologies involved in mail processing and delivery, such as message boxes, ZIP codes, optical scanners and conveyor systems. 

The museum holds the National Philatelic Collection. The museum has a gift shop and a United States Postal Service philatelic sales window. Admission is free. 

In 2005, the museum acquired the childhood stamp collection of the late singer/songwriter John Lennon. From June 2015 until December 2019, the museum displayed the 1856 British Guiana 1c magenta, the world&#x27;s most valuable stamp, which sold for nearly $10 million.

In September 2009, the museum received an $8 million gift from investment firm founder William H. Gross to help finance an expansion project. The William H. Gross Stamp Gallery of the museum is named in his honor.

==Events==
Since 2002, the museum has presented the Smithsonian Philatelic Achievement Award every two years.

<text>Isaac Isidore Bruce (born November 10, 1972) is an American former professional football wide receiver who played in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the Los Angeles Rams in the second round of the 1994 NFL draft after playing college football for the West Los Angeles Wildcats, the Santa Monica Corsairs, and most notably with the Memphis Tigers.

An All-Pro and four-time Pro Bowl selection, Bruce amassed 15,208 receiving yards in his career (fifth all-time). He played the first 14 years with the Los Angeles / St. Louis Rams and won a Super Bowl ring with the team in Super Bowl XXXIV over the Tennessee Titans. He also played for the San Francisco 49ers. During his time with the Rams, he was the leading wide receiver of &quot;The Greatest Show on Turf&quot;. In 2020, Bruce was elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Bruce was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He graduated from Dillard High School in Fort Lauderdale in 1990. As a senior for the Panthers football team, he caught 39 passes for 644 yards (16.5 yards per rec. avg.), was an All-County selection, and led his team to the 1989 Florida State 4-A Championship.

==College career==
Bruce originally signed his letter of intent to play college football for the Purdue Boilermakers in 1990, but his SAT scores were too low for Purdue to accept him. Bruce then decided to attend West Los Angeles College, then to Santa Monica College before transferring to the Memphis State University, where he played beside fellow future NFL receiver Russell Copeland. In 1992, Bruce&#x27;s first year with Memphis, he had 39 receptions for 532 yards and five touchdowns. In 1993, he became the first wide receiver in program history to post a 1,000-yard receiving season. He finished the season with a school-record 74 catches for 1,054 yards and 10 touchdowns. He earned a degree from Memphis in physical education, and he is the only Memphis player to be selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===Los Angeles Rams===
Bruce was selected in the 2nd round (33rd overall) by the Los Angeles Rams. He signed a 3-year, $1.75 million contract with the Rams on July 14, 1994. He earned the 1994 Carroll Rosenbloom Award, given to the team rookie of the year. He was also voted Rams Rookie of the Year by Orange County Sports Association and the Southern California Sports Broadcasters Association. His first NFL reception was a 34-yard touchdown throw from Chris Miller at Atlanta on September 11, 1994.

===St. Louis Rams===
He moved with the team to St. Louis in 1995. In 1995, Bruce was named the NFC&#x27;s week 1 Special Teams player of the Week after blocking a punt that contributed to a Rams win. He was also the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for week 6 following a 10-catch, 191 yard, 2 TD performance. His total receiving yards for 1995 (119 catches for 1,781 yards) was second only to Jerry Rice&#x27;s then record of 1,848 yards for one season, and is still the fifth most in a single season. In accomplishing this feat, Isaac Bruce surpassed former Houston Oilers WR Charley Hennigan&#x27;s 34-year-old record of 1,746 set in 1961. Bruce&#x27;s 119 catches also ranks 12th on the NFL&#x27;s all-time single-season reception list. Bruce further broke four Rams&#x27; records, including most receiving yards, most receptions, most consecutive 100-yard receiving games (6) and most 100-yard games (9). Bruce made USA Today&#x27;s All-Joe team, All-Madden, and All-Pro by Sports Illustrated and he was voted a first alternate to the Pro Bowl. He was also awarded the Rams MVP.

In 1996, Bruce led his team with 84 receptions and led the NFL with 1,338 yards. He became the first Rams receiver since Henry Ellard in 1990 and 1991 to post back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons. Against the Baltimore Ravens on October 27, 1996, he caught 11 passes for 229 yards and a touchdown. On November 30, 1996, Bruce was re-signed by the Rams to a 4-year $12.1 million contract extension. In 1996 Bruce was also voted to his first Pro Bowl, after having been an alternate the season before.

In the following seasons, Bruce was hampered by hamstring injuries. In 1997, he missed the first six games due to injury and in 1998 he missed the final nine games (he also missed two other games earlier in the season). In Atlanta on November 2, 1997, Bruce had another 200-yard game, totaling 10 catches, 233 yards and recording 2 touchdowns. Prior to his injury in 1998 in a home game against the Minnesota Vikings, Bruce had 11 catches for 192 yards and an 80-yard touchdown.

In 1999, Bruce was a Second-team All-Pro and was voted to his second Pro Bowl. He caught 77 passes for 1,165 yards and 12 touchdowns as Rams had a 13–3 record and advanced to the Super Bowl. He also led Rams in receiving yards in the playoffs, with 317 yards on 13 catches with a team-high two touchdowns. Bruce caught Kurt Warner&#x27;s 73-yard touchdown pass late in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl XXXIV to give the Rams a 23–16 lead, which turned out to be the game winner.
Prior to the 2000 season, Bruce was re-signed by the Rams to a 7-year, $42 million contract extension. In 2000, Bruce was again a Pro Bowler and caught 87 passes for 1,471 yards and 9 touchdowns. He became the first Rams receiver to earn back-to-back Pro Bowl invitations since Henry Ellard accomplished the feat for the 1988 and 1989 seasons. Bruce either led or was tied for the most receptions six times in 2000, led the team in receiving yards six times, and posted four 100-yard receiving games. That same year, Bruce and teammate Torry Holt became only the second WR duo from the same team to each gain over 1,400 yards in the same season (see Herman Moore and Brett Perriman).

In 2001, the Rams returned to the Super Bowl, losing to the New England Patriots, and Bruce made the Pro Bowl for the fourth time, becoming only the third receiver in franchise history to earn three consecutive Pro Bowl invitations (Elroy Hirsch 1951–53, Jim Phillips 1960–62). Bruce was voted offensive captain and became the franchise career leader in 100-yard receiving games (29), 1,000-yard seasons (5), and receiving touchdowns (56). He became just the second player in team history to post 500 career receptions vs. New York Giants on October 14, 2001. He caught five passes for 56 yards against New England in Super Bowl XXXVI.

Bruce became the Rams&#x27; all-time leader in receptions in 2002 while posting his fourth consecutive 1,000-yard receiving season. That year, he led the team with seven touchdown receptions, and ended the season with 79 receptions for 1,075 yards. On his 30th birthday, Bruce had three fumbles in a game. Luckily for Bruce, he scored a game-winning touchdown and the game is almost forgotten because of 34–34 tie between the Falcons and Steelers the same day.

In 2003, Bruce missed the 1,000-yard mark for the first time since 1998, finishing with 69 catches for 981 yards and 5 touchdowns, however, he became the Rams&#x27; all-time leader in receiving yards (10,461), passing his position coach Henry Ellard (9,761). That year Bruce made seven receptions for 116 yards in the NFC Divisional Playoff Game vs. Carolina on January 10, 2004, making him the only Rams player to have four career 100-yard postseason performances, breaking a tie with Tom Fears.

In 2004, Bruce caught 89 passes (fifth in the NFC, eighth in the NFL) for 1,292 yards (fifth in the NFL). He started the season with four consecutive 100-yard receiving performances, the first player to accomplish this feat since Houston&#x27;s Charley Hennigan in 1963. Bruce nabbed a team-high nine catches for 170 yards and one touchdown at Green Bay on November 29, 2004.

With the retirement of Jerry Rice, Bruce entered 2005 as the NFL&#x27;s active leader in career receiving yards; a foot injury caused him to miss 5 games, and he was passed by Marvin Harrison by the end of the season. Still, he became the 14th player in NFL history with 800 career receptions on December 11 at Minnesota.

On March 7, 2006, the Rams released Bruce rather than pay him a $1.5 million bonus; however, five days after releasing him, the Rams agreed to a three-year, $15 million deal with Bruce. The re-signing freed a reported $7.5 million in cap money for the Rams. That season Bruce started 15 of 16 games and notched his eighth career 1,000-yard receiving season with 1,098 yards on 74 catches with three touchdowns.

In 2007, Bruce caught 55 passes for 733 yards and 4 touchdowns, second on his team only to Torry Holt in all three categories. In Week 15, he retook the lead in career receiving yards among active players from Marvin Harrison, and in the same game passed James Lofton to become third on the all-time list.

On February 28, 2008, Bruce was released by the Rams after refusing to take a pay cut, which the Rams promised they would not do in a previous contract renegotiation.

===San Francisco 49ers===

On February 29, 2008, Bruce signed a two-year, $6 million contract with the San Francisco 49ers, to reunite with his former offensive coordinator Mike Martz. Jerry Rice gave Bruce permission to wear the number 80 although the team had already retired it, however Bruce decided against it and instead wore 88.

On December 21, 2008, in a game at St. Louis against his former team, the Rams, Bruce caught his 1,000th career reception – a 3-yard touchdown catch. St. Louis fans cheered on their former wide receiver, yelling &quot;Bruuuuuuuuce&quot; whenever he caught a pass, and cheered when he caught his 1,000th pass.

After contemplating retirement in the offseason, he elected to return to the 49ers in 2009 for his 16th season, reasoning that he was there to &quot;get in the playoffs again and win a Super Bowl&quot;.

On June 7, 2010, Bruce was traded from the 49ers to the Rams so that he would be able to retire as a Ram. Bruce was the last member of the former first-tenure Los Angeles Rams to retire.

<doc id="1198837" wikidata="Q5347801" url="?curid=1198837" title="Egg Banking">
<text>Egg was an internet bank headquartered in Derby, that is now a trading name of Yorkshire Building Society. Egg was born out of the banking arm in the United Kingdom of Prudential plc, which was established in 1996, and the Egg brand was launched in October 1998. The first online credit card was launched in September 1999.

It was only possible to operate an Egg account over the internet, or via their call centre. Egg specialised in savings and general insurance, together with loans, credit cards and mortgage products. The business was sold in January 2007 to Citigroup.

In March 2011, the credit card accounts were bought by Barclaycard, and in July 2011, the remaining savings and mortgage businesses were sold to Yorkshire Building Society, which subsequently transferred all remaining customer accounts over from Egg.

Following the sale of its assets, Egg Banking plc, which remained under the ownership of Citigroup, was renamed Canada Square Operations Limited and continues to handle matters relating to certain Egg products from before the sale of assets and any assets that were not transferred to the new owners.

== History ==
Egg was established as a division of life assurance company Prudential. Prudential Banking was involved in direct selling of savings and mortgage products.

On 11 October 1998, the division was renamed Egg, and relaunched as the United Kingdom&#x27;s first Internet bank. The bank offered 8% savings interest and the first credit card in the United Kingdom, which offered a 0% interest rate on both new purchases and balance transfers, with also an annual anniversary offer, and as a result soon had more than two million customers enjoying these market leading rates.

In June 2000, Prudential cashed in on its stake, and floated 21% of the company on the London Stock Exchange, retaining 79%. In January 2004, Prudential announced its intention to sell its remaining stake in Egg to a third party. Paul Gratton was chief executive of Egg in 2001. Despite rumours of interest from the likes of Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC, no formal offers were made public, and Prudential dropped its plans in August 2004.

Subsequently, Prudential bought back the remaining minority share in January 2006, and delisted the organisation from the London Stock Exchange. Chief executive officer Paul Gratton left the organisation in March 2006, to be replaced by then chief operating officer Mark Nancarrow. Nancarrow was subsequently replaced by Ian Kerr, formerly of HBOS, in November 2006.

On 29 January 2007, Prudential announced that it had agreed to sell Egg to Citigroup for a consideration of £575 million subject to approval by the Financial Services Authority. On 1 May 2007, the sale of Egg to Citi was completed, and Egg CEO Ian Kerr was appointed head of Egg and Citi UK Consumer.

At the beginning of 2008, Kerr left the business and was replaced in March by Bert Pijls. Pijls joined Citi in 1990, and has held several roles in the bank. In November 2007, approximately 350 non specialist roles were moved from the Dudley centre to Derby, resulting in redundancies and relocation packages. The Dudley office was later closed.

On 1 March 2011, Barclays Bank announced that they had agreed to buy Egg&#x27;s more than one million credit card accounts from Citigroup. Barclay&#x27;s Barclaycard division took over the Egg credit card business in May 2011, after Citi had spent time trying to sell the business as part of its Citi holdings portfolio.

Citi and Barclaycard shared the same site at Pride Park, Derby, but it was announced on 21 June 2011 that Barclaycard would move operations to their Kirkby and Northampton sites, leaving 659 people redundant. On 25 July 2011, Egg announced the proposed sale of all savings and mortgage accounts to Yorkshire Building Society. This would complete Citigroup&#x27;s sale of the Egg business.

== Advertising ==
Egg used several advertising agencies to produce its advertising. These included CHI &amp; Partners, Lowe Plus and Mother. Egg Card was launched in the United Kingdom with a television campaign by CHI and press advertisements and direct marketing created by Lowe Plus. Among the press advertisements was one showing a sea of urine samples with a headline that read &#x27;We&#x27;re just taking 10.9% APR. What&#x27;s your card taking?&#x27;

== Egg France ==
Capitalising on its British success, Egg launched in France in November 2002 with La Carte Egg. Despite investing heavily in the market in France, the services were never popular with the French, who generally hold fewer credit cards than the British. In October 2004, Egg decided to close its French operations, selling the unsecured lending business to , and the savings and brokerage businesses to ING of the Netherlands.

== Controversies ==
On 2 February 2008, Egg chose to cancel the credit cards of 161,000 (7%) of its customers. The bank gave customers 35 days&#x27; notice, after which they would not be able to spend more on their cards. While publicised as an attempt to purge &quot;risky&quot; customers from their books, many affected customers came forward with claims that they had excellent credit histories.

This led to speculation that the move was an attempt to remove customers who did not accumulate interest on their accounts and therefore did not generate profit for the bank.

The Financial Services Authority fined Egg £721,000 in December 2008 for the persistent misselling of payment protection insurance (PPI) on its credit cards. The authority&#x27;s director of enforcement, Margaret Cole, said &quot;Egg used inappropriate sales techniques to try to persuade customers to buy payment protection insurance on their credit card, even when they asserted they did not want the cover.&quot;

During 2008, Egg attempted to have one of its customers imprisoned, saying the Chip and PIN cards were &#x27;uncloneable&#x27;, and the customer was &#x27;clearly lying&#x27; about transactions from an ATM. The police arrested the customer, but after much investigation, the customer was acquitted.

<text>The Jewish Telegraph is a British Jewish newspaper. It was founded in December 1950 by Frank and Vivienne Harris, the parents of the current editor, Paul Harris. 

==Founding==
Frank and Vivienne Harris founded the newspaper in their dining room in Salford in December 1950. They started with £50 and a borrowed typewriter. Frank Harris was a London freelance journalist who, on his arrival in Manchester, noticed that its only Jewish newspaper was a freesheet. He determined to establish a paid for Jewish weekly. 

==Expansion==
Vivienne Harris oversaw the newspaper&#x27;s expansion from 1950 to 2011. She established editions in Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool and Glasgow. In 1976, the &quot;Jewish Telegraph&quot; established a Leeds edition with its own editorial and advertising staff of nine, based in a local office. In 1981, the paper acquired the title of the monthly &quot;Liverpool Jewish Gazette&quot;, giving Merseyside its first Jewish weekly. The paper has its own editorial staff in Liverpool, based in offices at Harold House, the Liverpool Jewish Community Centre, which moved into the new King David Campus in September 2011. In June 1992, on the demise of the &quot;Glasgow Jewish Echo&quot;, the paper moved into Scotland within a week and began a weekly edition. A staff of four works from offices at the Glasgow Maccabi complex. 

The latest addition was a website in December 1999, which is updated in the early hours of every Friday morning. The website&#x27;s design has not been updated since its launch.

The paper is based in Park Hill, Bury Old Road in Prestwich.

<text>Bryan Stanley William Johnson (5 February 1933 – 13 November 1973) was an English experimental novelist, poet and literary critic. He also produced television programmes and made films.

==Early life==
Johnson was born into a working-class family, the only child of a bookseller&#x27;s stock-keeper, Stanley Wilfred Johnson (1908–1973), and a waitress-cum-barmaid, Emily Jane (1908–1971, née Lambird), of Hammersmith, London. During the Second World War they moved to nearby Barnes.

Johnson was evacuated from London twice during the war. Having been educated at Flora Gardens Primary School, Hammersmith, he and his mother were moved to Chobham, Surrey in 1939 for two years, and he attended the village school. After a brief return to Hammersmith, he was sent alone in 1941 to High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, where he attended a local school. Having failed the eleven plus examination, he was unable to enter Latymer School at Hammersmith and spent the last year of the war at Highfields Secondary Modern School. On his return home, he attended Barnes County Secondary Modern School, before &quot;passing some sort of simple examination&quot; allowing him to transfer to Kingston Day Commercial School, where &quot;they taught me shorthand, typing, and bookkeeping. Useful.&quot;

Johnson left school when he was 16 years old to work variously as an accounting clerk for a building company and for a baker, as a bank junior and as a clerk at Standard Oil, but taught himself Latin in the evenings, attended a year&#x27;s pre-university course at Birkbeck College, and with this preparation, managed to pass the university entrance exam for King&#x27;s College London in 1956.

In later life he settled in Islington, north London, living in Claremont Square and Myddelton Square, after which he bought a house in Dagmar Terrace, Islington, where he lived until his death. On 31 March 1964 he married Virginia Ann Kimpton (b. 1938), a teaching machine programmer; she figures as Ginnie in his novel &quot;Trawl&quot;. They had two children.

==Career==
After graduating with a 2:2 degree in 1959, he worked as a private tutor and supply teacher in Surrey, while writing increasingly experimental and often acutely personal novels. In his early years he collaborated on several projects with a close friend and fellow writer, Zulfikar Ghose, with whom he produced a joint collection of stories, &quot;Statement Against Corpses&quot;. Like Johnson&#x27;s early stories, at least superficially, his first two novels, &quot;Travelling People&quot; (1963) and &quot;Albert Angelo&quot; (1964) initially appear relatively conventional in plot terms. However, the first uses several innovative devices and includes a section set out as a film script. The second includes famously cut-through pages to enable the reader to skip forward. His work became progressively even more experimental. &quot;The Unfortunates&quot; (1969) was published in a box with no binding (readers could assemble the book any way they liked, apart from the chapters marked &quot;First&quot; and &quot;Last&quot;, which indicated preferred terminal points. BBC producer Lorna Pegram employed him to talk about this creation for the TV series &quot;Release&quot;. With barely any negotiation, the interview was complete months before the book was ready for publication. &quot;House Mother Normal&quot; (1971) was written in purely chronological order such that various characters&#x27; thoughts and experiences would cross each other and intertwine, not just page by page, but sentence by sentence. He won the Eric Gregory Award in 1962 and the Somerset Maugham Award in 1967.

Johnson led and associated with a loose circle of experimental authors in 1960s Britain, who included Alan Burns, Eva Figes, Rayner Heppenstall, Ann Quin, Stefan Themerson, Wilson Harris and others. Many contributed to &quot;London Consequences&quot;, a novel consisting of a palimpsest of chapters passed between a range of participating authors, edited by Margaret Drabble and Johnson. Johnson also made numerous experimental films, published poetry, and wrote reviews, short stories and plays. For some years he was poetry editor of &quot;Transatlantic Review&quot;.

He is mentioned several times in Paul Theroux&#x27;s account of his friendship with V. S. Naipaul, &quot;Sir Vidia&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (1998).

==Death and legacy==
Johnson became depressed by his failure to succeed commercially and by mounting family problems. On 13 November 1973, aged 40, he took his own life by slitting his wrists at 9, Dagmar Terrace, Islington N1. He left an estate valued at 
£9,621.
The day before his death he had told his agent: &quot;I shall be much more famous once I&#x27;m dead.&quot;

Johnson&#x27;s following at the time of his death was small, but enthusiastic; he quickly acquired a posthumous cult following, helped by a critically acclaimed film adaptation in 2000 of the last novel of his to appear in his lifetime, &quot;Christie Malry&#x27;s Own Double-Entry&quot; (1973). Singer-songwriter Joe Pernice paid tribute to Johnson on the 2006 Pernice Brothers album &quot;Live a Little&quot;. Jonathan Coe&#x27;s 2004 biography &quot;Like a Fiery Elephant&quot; (winner of the 2005 Samuel Johnson Prize) again led to a renewal of interest in Johnson&#x27;s work. Coe himself is now a president of the B. S. Johnson Society, which aims &quot;to bring closer Johnson scholars, readers and &quot;aficionados&quot; alike in their various approaches to the author&#x27;s life and work.&quot;

In April 2013, the British Film Institute released &quot;You&#x27;re Human Like the Rest of Them&quot;, a collection of Johnson&#x27;s films, as part of the BFI Flipside DVD series.

In 2015, the Nottingham Five Leaves Bookshop held an event called &quot;But I Know This City!&quot; focused on Johnson&#x27;s novel &quot;The Unfortunates&quot;, which is set there. It took participants round the city to listen to live readings of the novel&#x27;s sections in whatever order they chose.

Indie pop band Los Campesinos! has cited the literature of B. S. Johnson among their non-musical influences, praising Coe&#x27;s biography, with Johnson&#x27;s work inspiring titles and lyrics of their music.

There is a collection of B. S. Johnson&#x27;s literary papers and correspondence in the British Library (Add MS 89001).

In 2020, Matthew Harle compiled a selection of proposals of B.S. Johnson’s abandoned work, titled &quot;Can I Come In and Talk About These and Other Ideas?&quot; &quot;13 Proposals from B.S. Johnson.&quot; Harle writes &#x27;B.S. Johnson&#x27;s proposals should provide consolation, encouragement, despair and disbelief for anyone who has ever tried to get an idea realised.&#x27;

<text>The archenteron, also called the gastrocoel, the primitive digestive tube or the primitive gut, is the internal cavity of the primitive gastrointestinal tract that forms during gastrulation in a developing animal embryo. It develops into the endoderm and mesoderm of the animal.

==Formation in sea urchins==

As primary mesenchyme cells detach from the vegetal pole in the gastrula and enter the fluid-filled cavity in the center (the blastocoel), the remaining cells at the vegetal pole flatten to form a vegetal plate. This buckles inwards towards the blastocoel in a process called invagination. The cells continue to be rearranged until the shallow dip formed by invagination transforms into a deeper, narrower pouch formed by the gastrula&#x27;s endoderm. This pouch narrows and lengthens to become the archenteron, a process driven by convergent extension. The open end of the archenteron is called the blastopore.
The filopodia—thin fibers formed by the mesenchyme cells, found in late gastrulation—contract to drag the tip of the archenteron across the blastocoel. The endoderm of the archenteron will fuse with the ectoderm of the blastocoel wall. At this point gastrulation is complete, and the embryo has a functional digestive tube.

==Similar formation process in other animals==
The indentation that is actually formed is called the lip of the blastopore or the dorsal lip in amphibians and fish, and the primitive streak in birds and mammals. Each is controlled by the dorsal lip and primitive node (also known as Hensen&#x27;s node), respectively.

During gastrulation, the archenteron develops into the digestive tube, with the blastopore developing into either the mouth (in protostomes) or the anus (in deuterostomes).

<text>Walter Henry Gage (March 5, 1905 – October 3, 1978) was a Canadian professor and administrator who spent 50 years at the University of British Columbia, beginning as an undergraduate student and eventually becoming university president.

== Personal details ==

==Biography==

Walter Gage was born in the middle-class neighborhood of South Vancouver to parents Alexander and Ann, immigrants from Great Britain. They raised Walter and his older sister Elsie and influenced both siblings&#x27; interest in community and politics. Walter attended Tecumseh Elementary and John Oliver Secondary School in Vancouver, demonstrating an early interest in his studies. As a teenager, he taught Sunday school and coached basketball. In 1921, Gage was the first in his family to attend university when he enrolled at UBC. He earned a Bachelor of Arts with honors in Mathematics in 1925, and a Master of Arts in Mathematics in 1926.
He taught mathematics at the University of British Columbia for over fifty years, from 1927 until his death in 1978. This period was interrupted only by his time teaching mathematics at Victoria College (1927–1933), where he also served as registrar (1929–1933).

While teaching mathematics, he served as Dean of Administrative and Inter-Faculty Affairs and Dean of Inter-Faculty and Student Affairs. In these roles, he worked to ensure that capable students would not be denied a university education because of personal adversities or financial hardship.

Walter Gage served as the 6th President of the University of British Columbia during a period of social change and growth (1969-1975). According to the university&#x27;s 15th President, Gage&#x27;s acceptance of the role was important to the university&#x27;s ability to manage that period.

He continued to teach during and after his presidency. In 1969, he became the inaugural recipient of the university&#x27;s annual Walter Koerner Master Teacher Award.

Gage is known for his efforts to ensure financial hardship did not prevent capable students from pursuing education. He supported students by establishing bursaries and personally contributing funds when necessary. He was known for his wit, for offering currency to struggling students, for his affection for the arts — especially theatre and music — and for his voluble manner of teaching.

An excerpt from the citation for the honorary degree awarded to him by the University of British Columbia in 1958 described Walter Gage as &quot;&#x27;the most and best beloved of the university family&#x27;, referring to him as &#x27;in a sense, the physical embodiment of this university&#x27;s academic conscience, and a man whose scholarly attainments and standards of teaching are equaled only by his concern always to do justice to colleagues and students alike&#x27;&quot;.  He was later awarded an Honorary LL.D. by the University of Victoria, where he had taught.

In 1971, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada, the highest rank in Canada&#x27;s civilian honour system.

Following his death in 1978, the Walter Gage Residence for students at the University of British Columbia was named in his honor.

A book detailing the life and work of Walter Gage was published in 2018. *The Age of Walter Gage: How One Canadian Shaped The Lives of Thousands* discusses Gage&#x27;s teaching methods and describes his large classes as being filled with keen students and enjoyment. It also covers his contributions to the UBC campus. The book chronicles Gage&#x27;s life, and his influence on Canadians.

<doc id="1198871" wikidata="Q8072595" url="?curid=1198871" title="ZipSlack">
<text>ZipSlack was a specially compiled release of the Slackware Linux distribution that was designed to be lightweight and portable. It was distributed in a ZIP archive along with the Slackware release.

==Installation==
Installing ZipSlack required obtaining the archive and unzipping it to the place where the user wished to install it. Unlike some other programs at the time, ZipSlack did not require for the user to reconfigure existing partitions to install it.

==Details==
ZipSlack used the UMSDOS filesystem under Linux, which ran on top of the FAT filesystem. The FAT filesystem was originally used by Microsoft operating systems and can be found today on various types of removable media such as ZIP disks, SuperDisks, USB flash drives, and secure digital cards.

The last release of Slackware that contained ZipSlack was Slackware 11.0. Slackware 12.0 did not contain a ZipSlack setup within its distribution, although this change was not mentioned in its release announcement. The most likely cause of this is the lack of UMSDOS support in Linux 2.6, as support for this filesystem type had been removed from the official Linux sources after some discussion regarding the Linux Kernel Mailing List.

ZipSlack was quite lightweight compared to other operating systems in its time. For example, the X Window System was not present in ZipSlack by default, nor were there any GUI-based web browsers. However, since ZipSlack was essentially just a miniature installation of Slackware, users were able to use the Slackware package management system to install whatever packages they may need.

==Minimum requirements==
When downloaded, ZipSlack required approximately 100 megabytes of disk space and an Intel 80386 or compatible CPU. ZipSlack was able to run with a minimum of four megabytes of memory with an add-on supplied by Slackware. However, at least eight to sixteen megabytes were the recommended minimum requirement with the possibility of more if the X Window System or other GUI software was going to be used with it.

The UMSDOS file system needed to be hosted on a FAT filesystem.

==Caveats==
The archive, which contained the ZipSlack distribution, was too big to be decompressed with a 16-bit application such as the older versions of PKZIP for DOS systems. Instead, software such as a 32-bit DOS version of Info-ZIP compiled with a DOS extender, Info-ZIP on Linux, WinZip, 7-Zip, or another similarly capable utility on Microsoft Windows needed to be used. Alternatively, the system could be booted on a live CD version of Slackware and the standard zip utility provided with the distribution used.

<text>Bernard Paul Richard, C.M. (born April 11, 1951) is a Canadian social worker, lawyer, and politician in the Province of New Brunswick.

==Early life and education==
Raised and educated in Cap-Pelé, New Brunswick, Richard earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Moncton and a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of New Brunswick.

==Political career==
He first entered politics as a young man, running unsuccessfully in Shediac for the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick as a Parti Acadien candidate in the 1974 election. He became involved in municipal politics in the village of Cap-Pélé. His second entry into provincial politics was in the 1991 election, this time as a Liberal. He won. He was re-elected in 1995, 1999 and 2003.

He was named to cabinet in 1995 and left in 1998 to contest the leadership of the Liberal Party. He was unsuccessful in his leadership bid and was returned to the cabinet position by Camille Thériault who was the victor in the contest. Richard managed to be re-election by the largest margin of any candidate in the 1999 election, despite the fact that his party suffering a massive defeat.

When Thériault resigned as leader in 2001, Richard briefly considered another run but instead became interim leader. When Shawn Graham became leader in 2002, Richard was made House Leader and finance critic, two key roles in the opposition. Richard maintained these roles after the 2003 election.

The Progressive Conservative government of Bernard Lord had won a bare majority in 2003, winning 28 of 55 seats and were anxious to strengthen their position. After first attempting to convince a Liberal to sit as speaker and then offering cabinet positions and other appointments to several Liberals, Richard accepted the post of provincial ombudsman, thus resigning his seat and increasing the Tory majority to 28/54 for the ensuing year before a by-election was held.

On November 6, 2007, New Brunswick news outlets reported that the Progressive Conservatives were encouraging Richard to leave his post as ombudsman and return to politics as leader of their party.

In 2024, he was appointed as a member of the Order of Canada. He lives in Cap-Pelé, New Brunswick.

Harrow-on-the-Hill is the final Metropolitan line station from Central London before the line splits with the main branch towards Watford, Chesham or Amersham and the diverged Uxbridge branch towards Uxbridge. It is in Travelcard Zone 5.

==History==
The station was opened as &quot;Harrow&quot; on 2 August 1880, when the Metropolitan Railway was extended from its previous terminus at Willesden Green. Its name was changed to &quot;Harrow-on-the-Hill&quot; on 1 June 1894. Like some other Underground stations, the name is an example of marketing rather than precision; in this case the town &quot;proper&quot; of the same name is at the top of Harrow Hill (i.e. Harrow-on-the-Hill), while the station is located at the foot of the hill to the north, which at the time of opening was a small hamlet called Greenhill and has since become the main town proper of Harrow.

Had the governors of Harrow School not made objections during the planning stage, it is possible that the Metropolitan Railway might have followed a different route taking it closer to the town centre on the hill. The station is at the heart of Metroland.

The National Rail service began as the Great Central Railway (GCR) on 15 March 1899. The GCR ran on the former Great Central Main Line, an intercity trunk route and provided services from Harrow to destinations such as Rugby, Leicester, Nottingham and Manchester. The passenger service north of Aylesbury ceased in 1966 due to the Beeching Axe. There was a goods yard, which closed on 3 April 1967.

==Railway geography==
The station is a major junction with numerous crossovers north and south of station enabling flexibility when routing trains.

South of the station there are four LU tracks paired by direction as &quot;Fast&quot; and &quot;Local&quot; lines to/from Baker Street and two &quot;Main line&quot; tracks to/from Marylebone.

North of the station, the Uxbridge branch diverges from the other routes by means of a burrowing junction. Above this, Harrow North Junction separates the &quot;Local line&quot; towards North Harrow and the &quot;Main line&quot; towards Moor Park.

==Services==
===London Underground===
London Underground services at Harrow-on-the-Hill are provided by the Metropolitan line. The adjacent Underground stations are Northwick Park (all stations southbound), Finchley Road (fast southbound), Moor Park (fast northbound), North Harrow (all stations northbound) and West Harrow (towards Uxbridge). The Metropolitan line is unique in operating an express service. &quot;Fast&quot; and &quot;Semi-fast&quot; services (now mostly reserved for peak times) do not stop &quot;between&quot; Harrow-on-the-Hill and Finchley Road. The &quot;Fast&quot; lines at stations between Moor Park, Harrow and Wembley Park have no platforms.

Southbound services go to either Baker Street (4tph) or continue beyond to the line&#x27;s terminus at Aldgate (12tph). Off-peak trains from Amersham (2tph), Chesham (2tph) and Uxbridge (8tph) generally terminate at Aldgate, with a 4tph service from Watford to Baker Street, however during peak hours trains from all branches go to/from all destinations.

=== Bus Network ===
Busses H9, H10, H11, H14, H17, 114, 140, 182, 183, 186, 223, 258, 340, 395, 483, SL9, SL10 (among others) all serve the adjacent Harrow Bus Station.

===National Rail===
The National Rail service at Harrow-on-the-Hill is provided by Chiltern Railways. Services operate between Marylebone station and Aylesbury using the separate Network Rail tracks from London to Harrow and sharing London Underground tracks between Harrow and Amersham. Chiltern Railways started operating in 1996 after the privatisation of British Rail and typically provide two trains per hour between Aylesbury and London via Harrow.

==Station layout==
The station building is above ground with the six platforms in a cutting. Two (on the South side) are predominantly used by NR services and the other four by the Metropolitan line; the NR platforms are electrified with the LU system (normal services are operated by diesel trains) and &quot;incoming&quot; LU trains on some routes can be diverted into them should this be necessary during closures of tracks in the area.

The station has two entrances, one on Station Approach (leading to Lowlands Road and Harrow Hill) and one on College Road (for Harrow Bus Station and the main shopping area).

During opening hours the Station is popular as a shortcut, removing the longer walk via the bridge at Station Road, as it is possible to walk through the bridge and use the public toilets without passing through the ticket gates.

The present main station building replaced older structures at the London end of the platforms (thus leaving Station Road with no station); it consists of a circulating area above the tracks with stairways leading down to all platforms and both street entrances.

A pedestrian tunnel once connected all the platforms to the adjacent and now closed Post Office sorting office, whose site was redeveloped.

An office block called Avanta House was built in the 1980s on top of the station&#x27;s College Road entrance.

Harrow-on-the-Hill gained step-free access from College Road as part of a tranche of access improvements scheduled for completion in 2020; that work, which also introduced lifts to the platforms served by Chiltern Railways, was completed in March 2022 but passengers approaching the station from the south (Lowlands Road) are still required to ascend flights of steps.

==Bus station==

There is a bus station located next to the station offering London Buses services right across North London.

<doc id="1198888" wikidata="Q220980" url="?curid=1198888" title="Pío Baroja">
<text>Pío Baroja y Nessi (28 December 1872 – 30 October 1956) was a Spanish writer, one of the key novelists of the Generation of &#x27;98. He was a member of an illustrious family. His brother Ricardo was a painter, writer and engraver, and his nephew Julio Caro Baroja, son of his younger sister Carmen, was a well-known anthropologist.

==Biography==
Pío was born in San Sebastián, Guipuzcoa, the son of Serafin Baroja, also a noted writer and opera librettist.

The young Baroja studied medicine at University of Valencia and received a doctorate at the Complutense University in Madrid at 21. Although educated as a physician, Baroja practiced only briefly in the Basque town of Cestona. His memories of student life became the raw material for his novel &quot;The Tree of Knowledge&quot;. He also managed the family bakery for a short time, running unsuccessfully on two occasions for a seat at the Cortes Generales (the Spanish parliament) as a Radical Republican. Baroja&#x27;s true calling, however, was always writing, which he began seriously at the age of 13.

Baroja&#x27;s first novel, &quot;La casa de Aizgorri&quot; (&quot;The House of Aizgorri&quot;, 1900), is part of a trilogy called &quot;Tierra vasca&quot; (&quot;Basque Land&quot;, 1900–1909). This trilogy also includes &quot;El mayorazgo de Labraz&quot; (&quot;The Lord of Labraz&quot;, 1903), which became one of his most popular novels in Spain. During this period, he also published &quot;Camino de perfección&quot; (&quot;Road to Perfection&quot;, 1902), which is part of the so called Novels of 1902. This group of texts is considered a milestone in the renewal of Spanish novels, particularly, a turning point in the transition between realism and modernism.

Baroja is best known internationally for another trilogy, &quot;La lucha por la vida&quot; (&quot;The Struggle for Life&quot;, 1922–1924), which offers a vivid depiction of life in Madrid&#x27;s slums. John Dos Passos greatly admired these works and wrote about them.

Another major work, &quot;Memorias de un hombre de acción&quot; (&quot;Memories of a Man of Action&quot;, 1913–1931), offers a depiction of one of his ancestors who lived in the Basque region during the Carlist uprising in the 19th century.

One of Baroja&#x27;s tetralogies is called &quot;La mar&quot; (&quot;The Sea&quot;) and comprises &quot;Las inquietudes de Shanti Andía&quot; (1911), &quot;El laberinto de las sirenas&quot; (1923), &quot;Los pilotos de altura&quot; (1929) and &quot;La estrella del capitán Chimista&quot; (1930). Baroja also wrote the biography of Juan Van Halen, a Spanish military adventurer.

Baroja&#x27;s masterpiece is considered to be &quot;El árbol de la ciencia&quot; (1911) (translated as &quot;The Tree of Knowledge&quot;), a pessimistic Bildungsroman that depicts the futility of the pursuit of knowledge and of life in general. The title is symbolic: the more the chief protagonist, Andres Hurtado, learns about and experiences life, the more pessimistic he feels and the more futile his life seems.

In keeping with Spanish literary tradition, Baroja often wrote in a pessimistic, picaresque style. His deft portrayal of the characters and settings brought the Basque region to life much as Benito Pérez Galdós&#x27;s works offered an insight into Madrid. Baroja&#x27;s works were often lively but could be lacking in plot. They are written in an abrupt, vivid, yet impersonal style. He was accused of grammatical errors, which he never denied.

While young, Baroja believed loosely in anarchism, like others in the &#x27;98 Generation. He later admired men of action, similar to Nietzsche&#x27;s superman. Catholics and traditionalists denounced him, and his life was at risk during the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). In &quot;Youth And Egolatry&quot; (1917), Baroja described his beliefs as follows:

I have always been a liberal radical, an individualist and an anarchist. In the first place, I 
am an enemy of the Church; in the second place, I am an enemy of the State. When these great powers are in conflict I am a partisan of the State as against the Church, but on the day of the State&#x27;s triumph, I shall become an enemy of the State. If I had lived during the French Revolution, I should have been an internationalist of the school of Anacharsis Cloots; during the struggle for liberty, I should have been one of the Carbonieri.

Ernest Hemingway was greatly influenced by Baroja and told him when he visited him in October 1956, &quot;Allow me to pay this small tribute to you who taught so much to those of us who wanted to be writers when we were young. I deplore the fact that you have not yet received a Nobel Prize, especially when it was given to so many who deserved it less, like me, who am only an adventurer.&quot;

Baroja died shortly after this visit on 30 October and was buried in the Old Civil Cemetery of Madrid.

An Iberia Airbus A340-642, EC-JPU (in service between 2006 and 2020) was named after him.

=== Baroja and Catalonia ===
Pío Baroja had a markedly opposed attitude both to Catalanism and to the existence of the Catalan language. As example, a fragment of an article in La Conquista del Estado can be mentioned:...the question of the predominance of the language -Catalan- must be resolved over time... But the State has not exerted pressure here, and if it has, it has not been as energetic as it has in France, Germany and England, with their regional languages...There are other examples of anti-Catalanism, in which it even goes so far as to describe Catalans as Jews, at a historical moment when this was considered a serious racial insult.

<text>North Harrow is a London Underground station situated in North Harrow, north-west London. It is on the Metropolitan line between Pinner and Harrow-on-the-Hill stations. It has won Transport for London awards for best customer service in 2009 and 2010.

==History==
The Metropolitan Railway began running services through here on 25 May 1885 with the opening of its Pinner extension. North Harrow station opened on 22 March 1915. The station was rebuilt in 1930 to the designs of Charles Clark as part of the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s modernisation programme.

Currently the art on display are photocopied pictures of local people painted over with coloured paint in various places, made by a local disabled children&#x27;s group. It has two main exits but in recent years only one is in use, towards the town centre, presumably due to setup of the barriers not requiring both. There is a direct door into a neighbouring florist. The area under the railway bridge outside the exit to the station used to be prone to flooding at times due to its low-lying position, although this is now rarely the case due to works to create a storm overflow area at the nearby Headstone Manor&#x27;s recreation area.

==Services==
In the northbound direction, the station is served by trains to Watford (4tph), Amersham (2tph) and Chesham (2tph) trains (at peak times, &#x27;fast&#x27; trains do not stop at stations between Harrow-on-the-Hill and Moor Park). In the southbound direction, off-peak services generally run 4tph to Baker Street and 4tph to Aldgate.

==Connections==
London Buses routes H9 and H10 serve the station. The routes H18, H19 and 183 all serve the nearby Pinner Road.

<text>Neustadt an der Aisch (officially: &quot;Neustadt a.d. Aisch&quot;) is a small town of around 13,000 inhabitants in the northern part of Bavaria (Germany), within the Franconian administrative region Middle Franconia.
It is the district town of the district Neustadt (Aisch)-Bad Windsheim.

==History==
In 741, for the first time, Riedfeld, the town&#x27;s root settlement, was documented as the German king&#x27;s court. However, in 1285 the town&#x27;s name is documented for the first time as &quot;Nivenstadt&quot;.

At the end of the 12th century, Neustadt became part of the sovereign territory of the burgraves of Nuremberg, the dynasty of the Hohenzollern. The House of Hohenzollern developed Neustadt into an economical, political and also cultural centre of its region, mainly because of its favourable geographical position in the middle of the main trade route between Würzburg and Nuremberg.

At the end of the 15th century, Margrave Albrecht Achilles and &quot;Kurfürstin&quot; (Electress) Anna completed Neustadt as a stronghold.

In 1553, in the Second Margrave War, the town was burnt down. Afterwards, a long lasting phase of construction and extension began. This phase ended with the destructions of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The rebuilding after that war lasted several hundred of years.

From 1791 through to 1806, Neustadt was part of the sovereign territory of Prussia, then was military governed by the French, and in 1810 became finally part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. The political importance of Neustadt faded thereafter, but trade and industry kept growing due to the deployment of a garrison of the Uhlans, and in 1865 due to the opening of its station on the Nuremberg–Würzburg Railway.

In 1934, the town was the scene of an organized boycott against all Jewish merchants, and violence broke out against Christian Germans who patronized stores owned by Jews. Ultimately all of the Jews of Neustadt were expelled, many relocating to Nuremberg, and the Jewish synagogue was razed to the ground.

During the 20th century, traditional handicrafts (like brush-makers and makers of drawing instruments) almost completely vanished. With the resettlement of expellees from Sudetenland, new handicraft industries were imported: construction of musical instruments and the textile industry flourished.

From 1969 through to 1980, in total 16 &quot;Ortsteile&quot; were incorporated. In the course of an administrative reorganization (&quot;Gebietsreform&quot;), Neustadt became capital of the newly formed district &quot;Neustadt (Aisch)-Bad Windsheim&quot;.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the infrastructure was improved on a grand scale: a beltway was built, and a pedestrian area around the market place was created; the cultural program was extended, and the old town was rehabilitated; new residential zones and business parks were established.

<doc id="1198919" wikidata="Q714452" url="?curid=1198919" title="Ernest Marsden">
<text>Sir Ernest Marsden (19 February 1889 – 15 December 1970) was an English-New Zealand physicist. He is recognised internationally for his contributions to science while working under Ernest Rutherford, which led to the discovery of new theories on the structure of the atom. In Marsden&#x27;s later work in New Zealand, he became a significant member of the scientific community, while maintaining close links to the United Kingdom.

==Education==
Born in Manchester, the son of Thomas Marsden and Phoebe Holden, Marsden lived in Rishton and attended Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School, Blackburn, where an inter-house trophy rewarding academic excellence (&#x27;The Marsden Merit Trophy&#x27;) bears his name.

In 1909, as a 20-year-old student at the University of Manchester, he met and began work under Ernest Rutherford. While still an undergraduate he conducted the famous Geiger–Marsden experiment, also called the gold foil experiment, together with Hans Geiger under Rutherford&#x27;s supervision. This experiment led to Rutherford&#x27;s new theory for the structure of the atom, with a centralised concentration of mass and positive charge surrounded by empty space and a sea of orbiting negatively charged electrons. Rutherford later described this as &quot;almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back to hit you&quot;.

The apparatus used in the experiment was an early version of what was to become the Geiger counter.

In 1915 he moved to Victoria University College in Wellington, New Zealand, to replace Thomas Laby as Professor of Physics; Rutherford recommended his appointment there.

==Career==
Marsden served in France during World War I as a Royal Engineer in a special sound-ranging section and was awarded the Military Cross in the 1919 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

In 1922 Marsden turned from his research and position as Professor of Physics to bureaucracy. He was appointed Assistant Director of Education before accepting the position of Secretary of New Zealand&#x27;s new Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) in 1926. The new Department&#x27;s focus was on assisting primary industries, and Marsden worked to organise research particularly in the area of agriculture.

Marsden initiated a number of projects that kept New Zealand in touch with international developments in the field of radiation and nuclear sciences. In 1939 he pioneered the non-medical use of radioisotopes in New Zealand, and conducted a series of experiments to determine the role of cobalt in animal metabolism.

With the outbreak of World War II Marsden was given the title of Director of Scientific Developments, and was charged with mobilizing New Zealand&#x27;s scientific manpower. During the War he worked on radar research, setting up a team to develop the radar equipment for use in the Pacific. Marsden also used his scientific connections to form a team of young New Zealand scientists who would participate in the American Manhattan Project developing the nuclear bomb, and initiated the search for uranium, the raw material needed for nuclear projects, in New Zealand.

Marsden had a post-war vision of a nuclear New Zealand, with scientists working on research using local nuclear reactors, and developing connections with the British nuclear energy and weapons program. While this vision was not fully realised, in 1946 he established a team of scientists to carry out research into atomic energy and the application of nuclear science to problems in agriculture, health, and industry. Ties between Marsden and the scientific community in Britain remained strong, and in 1947 he became the DSIR&#x27;s scientific liaison officer in London.

Marsden retired in 1954 and returned to Wellington, where he continued to work and travel extensively, serving on a number of committees and conducting research into environmental radioactivity. As his studies turned to the impact of fallout from radioactive bombs, Marsden came to oppose testing and the development of nuclear weapons. While Marsden had a significant role in establishing and encouraging nuclear science in New Zealand, this role of speaking out against nuclear weapons development and testing - which he only did after the British nuclear testing program was complete - is less known.

In 1966, the same year France began testing nuclear bombs in the Pacific, Marsden suffered a stroke which left him confined to a wheelchair. He later died at his home in Lowry Bay, Lower Hutt on the shores of Wellington Harbour in 1970.

==Family life==
Marsden married Margaret Sutcliffe, a school teacher, in 1913. They had two children together, a son and a daughter. After Marsden&#x27;s final retirement to New Zealand, Maggie (who had been suffering from heart disease) died on 7 November 1956. 
Two years later Marsden remarried, and on 26 June 1958 Joyce Winifred Chote, who was 30 years his junior, became his wife. She assisted him in his remaining years, joining him on his travels and supporting him during his research.

==Honours and awards==
Marsden&#x27;s career recognitions included fellowship in the Royal Society of London in 1946, president of the Royal Society of New Zealand in 1947 and the Rutherford Memorial Lecture in 1948. In 1961 he chaired the Rutherford Jubilee Conference in Manchester, which celebrated 50 years since Rutherford&#x27;s discovery of the atomic nucleus.

In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal and appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Silver Jubilee and King&#x27;s Birthday Honours. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1946 New Year Honours and a Knight Bachelor in the 1958 New Year Honours, for services to science.

==Honorific eponyms==
The Marsden Fund for basic research in New Zealand was set up in 1994.

Massey University has named a major lecture theatre after him.

<doc id="1198926" wikidata="Q7280867" url="?curid=1198926" title="KUOM">
<text>KUOM (770 AM) – branded &quot;Radio K - Real College Radio&quot; – is a daytime-only, non-commercial, college radio station licensed to Minneapolis, Minnesota. Owned by the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, the station is operated by students and faculty. It mainly airs alternative rock with other genres of music. The studios are in Rarig Center on the University of Minnesota campus.

KUOM is a member of AMPERS, the Association of Minnesota Public Educational Radio Stations. It receives funding from a number of sources, including donations from listeners. Approximately 40% of the station&#x27;s funding comes from listener support, while the rest is provided by the state and federal governments, along with the University of Minnesota.

KUOM&#x27;s AM signal operates at 5,000 watts with a non-directional antenna. Its transmitter tower is on the St. Paul - Falcon Heights campus. Due to its low frequency of 770 kHz, combined with the region&#x27;s excellent soil conductivity, the station&#x27;s AM coverage is comparable to that of a full-power FM station. Its signal can be heard throughout the Twin Cities area, with grade B coverage as far as St. Cloud and Mankato. However, the AM operation is licensed to broadcast only during daylight hours to avoid interfering with Class A WABC in New York City at night. Therefore, its hours of operation vary from month to month, reflecting local sunrise and sunset times. Sign off, for example, ranges from 4:30 p.m. in winter to 9:00 p.m. in summer. KUOM extends its reach, and adds nighttime service, with two FM translators and one limited-reach FM station that allow KUOM&#x27;s programming to be heard 24 hours a day. KUOM is also available online.

==Programming==
Programs include a wide variety of Independent and Alternative music, and feature specialty shows dedicated to Metal, Hip Hop, Jazz, R&amp;B, Electronic, Punk, Folk, and World Music. The station specializes in promoting local musicians and produces local shows, including the award-winning &quot;Off The Record&quot;. Music submissions are filtered through a large group of volunteer reviewers and DJs.

A news program called &quot;Access Minnesota&quot; began in 2004. It is carried on several dozen radio stations across the state. Focusing on politics and the media, the program is produced by Radio K and the Minnesota Broadcasters Association.

The station&#x27;s programming has been recognized as the &quot;best radio station of the Twin Cities&quot; in 2010, 2013, and 2015 by &quot;City Pages&quot; editors. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; founder Ryan Schreiber also commonly cites the station&#x27;s influence as having been an integral factor in his decision to start an online publication dedicated to the coverage of independent music.

==History==
The university traces its radio activities back more than 100 years, starting with experimental work in 1912, followed by radiotelegraph broadcasts begun in 1920, and radiotelephone broadcasts of market reports inaugurated in February 1921. KUOM&#x27;s first license as a broadcasting station, originally WLB, was granted on January 13, 1922. This was Minnesota&#x27;s first broadcasting station, making KUOM one of the oldest surviving radio stations in North America.

===WX2 and 9XI===
Originally called &quot;wireless telegraphy,&quot; radio experimentation at the University of Minnesota began in 1912, conducted by Professor Franklin Springer, using spark transmitters that could only send the dots-and-dashes of Morse code. In January 1916, it was reported that as a &quot;first in the northwest,&quot; the College of Engineering was planning to transmit the progress of that night&#x27;s basketball game between the University of Minnesota and the visiting University of Iowa team.

In late 1919, following the end of World War I, the university was authorized to establish a &quot;War Department Training and Rehabilitation School&quot; station, with the call sign WX2. This was followed in early 1920 by the issuance of an experimental radio license, with the call sign 9XI. These operations were under the oversight of electrical engineering professor C. M. Jansky Jr., the older brother of Karl Jansky.

In 1920 a one-kilowatt spark transmitter was installed. In addition to communicating with amateur and other university stations, 9XI, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, transmitted market and weather reports by radiotelegraph. The development of vacuum tube transmitters, capable of audio transmissions, would lead to further advances, and over time 9XI began including broadcasts for general audiences. On February 2, 1921, the station inaugurated audio transmissions, as part of its nightly 8:30 p.m. broadcasts of market reports. In the fall of 1921, the station gave &quot;a running account of a Minnesota football game through notes brought to the station&#x27;s studios by a relay of students from the sidelines at the field.&quot; December saw the beginning of a daily noon broadcast of livestock prices. These transmissions initially originated from the electrical engineering building on the Minneapolis campus, where a transmitter was installed on the roof.

===WLB / KUOM===
Initially there were no formal standards for radio stations making broadcasts intended for the general public. However, effective December 1, 1921, the United States Department of Commerce, which supervised radio at this time, issued a regulation requiring that stations making broadcasts intended for the general public now had to operate under a &quot;Limited Commercial&quot; license.&quot; On January 13, 1922 the university was issued its new license, which was given the randomly assigned call letters WLB, and authorized the use of both broadcasting wavelengths: 360 meters (833 kHz) for &quot;entertainment&quot;, and 485 meters (619 kHz) for &quot;market and weather reports&quot;. This was the first broadcasting station license issued in the state of Minnesota. WHA, operated by the University of Wisconsin–Madison, was issued its first license on the same day, making WLB and WHA the first two broadcasting licenses issued to educational institutions, and early examples of college radio stations. Other Midwestern universities also doing early telegraph and radio experiments include the University of Iowa&#x27;s WSUI and Iowa State University&#x27;s WOI, both started in 1911, and St. Louis University&#x27;s WEW in 1912. WHA began its experiments in 1915.

In February 1922, when a heavy snowstorm knocked out newswire services in the region, the &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot; asked the station&#x27;s operators to help retrieve the day&#x27;s news through a roundabout series of amateur radio relays.

Beginning in 1927 the station operated with a secondary call sign of &quot;WGMS&quot;, for &quot;Gold Medal (Flour) Station&quot;, which was used when station WCCO employed WLB&#x27;s transmitter. (At the time, WCCO was also using its own facilities at 720 kHz, 740 kHz and 810 kHz.) On May 15, 1933, after the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) requested that stations using only one of their assigned call letters drop those that were no longer in regular use, WGMS was eliminated and the station reverted to just WLB.

On November 11, 1928, a major reassignment of station transmitting frequencies took place, under the provisions of the Federal Radio Commission&#x27;s General Order 40. WLB began operating on 1250 kHz, but a shortage of available assignments meant it had to share this frequency with three other stations: St. Olaf College&#x27;s WCAL in Northfield, Minnesota; Carlton College&#x27;s KFMX; and the Rosedale Hospital&#x27;s WRHM, which in 1934 changed its callsign to WTCN (now WWTC). WLB, WCAL and KFMX were operated by educational institutions, while WTCN was a commercial station which aggressively sought to expand its operating hours at the expense of the other three stations.

KFMX surrendered its license in 1933, which reduced the number of stations sharing time. WLB&#x27;s facilities were moved to Eddy Hall in 1936. In 1938 WLB and WCAL made peace with WTCN by agreeing to move to 760 kHz, where the stations were restricted to daytime-only transmissions, with WLB to receive rds of the available hours. In 1941, as part of the frequency shifts resulting from implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, WLB and WCAL moved from 760 to 770 kHz. In 1991, The University of Minnesota made an agreement with St. Olaf in which WCAL was provided land for an improved FM tower near Rosemount, Minnesota in exchange for fulltime use of the AM frequency.

WLB&#x27;s programming was expanded to include lectures, concerts, and football games. In the 1930s and 1940s, the station broadcast a considerable amount of educational material and was used for distance learning—a practice that continued into the 1990s. On June 1, 1945, WLB&#x27;s call sign was changed to KUOM, to stand for University of Minnesota.

A polio epidemic in 1946 that resulted in temporary school closings and the cancellation of the Minnesota State Fair led the station to create programming for children who were homebound. Those programs, along with others broadcast in the 1940s, were recognized for their importance and led to several awards being given to the station.

Until the change to Radio K in 1993, KUOM operated with a paid staff, and was known as &quot;University of Minnesota Public Radio&quot; (unrelated to Minnesota Public Radio). The station broadcast public affairs, arts, classical music, and a variety of other programming focusing especially on bringing the rich resources of the University to listeners. During its public service broadcast era, the station won many prestigious national awards and widespread recognition for its public service, news, and cultural and music programs. Daily programs and special broadcasts hosted many famed authors, political figures, musicians, actors, and scientists. Weekend programming was more casual and offered contemporary music, international music, and rock music programming, including what is likely the very first public broadcast of music by Prince.

===Carrier current WMMR===
In 1948 a low-power student-run carrier current station was established, with studios in Coffman Memorial Union. Due to its very limited coverage, which was restricted to the campus and immediately adjoining areas, the station did not require a license from the Federal Communications Commission, or qualify for officially assigned call letters. However, it informally identified itself as WMMR for &quot;Women&#x27;s and Men&#x27;s Minnesota Radio.&quot; Focused on providing a service for the student body, WMMR initially broadcast at 730 AM as &quot;Radio 73&quot;. The programming was later also carried by the Minneapolis cable television system.

WMMR was a student-run operation and relied solely on volunteers. By the mid-1960s through the end of its life, WMMR tried to emulate the management structure of a typical AM rock station of the day, with an appointed General Manager, Program Director, Music Director and other management positions. A news and sports operation broadcast daily reports, and the basketball, football and hockey programs were usually broadcast with live play-by-play. A number of live broadcasts were done from the Whole Music Club and the Great Hall and the station promoted other campus events such as the &#x27;Campus Carny&#x27; held annually in the old field house. Garrison Keillor, the well-known creator of Minnesota Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;, began his radio career broadcasting classical music on WMMR as a student in the early 1960s. He then worked at KUOM from 1963 to 1968.

WMMR ended operations in 1993 with the launch of Radio K.

===Consolidation of KUOM and WMMR as Radio K===
In August 1991, the University began to examine the idea of merging WMMR and KUOM under political pressure from competing commercial and public radio broadcasters. The University explained the elimination of educational, cultural, and community outreach programming by claiming the public service format was too expensive, and that the new format would lower costs. It was also claimed that most of the educational value of KUOM had been superseded by other media outlets by this time, however no studies or research were done to substantiate these claims and no other broadcasting service in the state leveraged the resources of the University for public service.

The transition took place in 1993, and KUOM began using the &quot;Radio K&quot; name on October 1 of that year. To avoid the lack of direction found at some college music stations, the new &quot;Radio K&quot; retained most full-time staff to oversee operations and provide a level of continuity, with students providing much of the on-air hosting. One notable program in the first decade of Radio K was &quot;Cosmic Slop&quot;. The show, which first went on the air in the waning days of WMMR, searched through the station&#x27;s considerable library of 1970s pop music, playing both the best and worst from that decade (with occasional forays into the recordings from the rest of the 20th century).

==FM signals==
KUOM programming is also available via low-power KUOM-FM St. Louis Park (106.5 FM), along with translators W264BR Falcon Heights (100.7 FM) and K283BG Minneapolis (104.5 FM).

KUOM-FM, with 6 watts at 106.5 FM, began operating in 2002 and is a simulcast of KUOM. At one point, this station was licensed to broadcast only during the time periods when its timeshare partner KDXL was off the air. KDXL, which began broadcasting in 1978, was owned by the St. Louis Park Public Schools district and operated by and from St. Louis Park High School during the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on &quot;designated school days,&quot; so outside of the summer months KUOM-FM generally operated only at night and on weekends.

Setting up KUOM-FM took several years of negotiations with the FCC. In 2004, the transmitter was moved from the high school to a high rise residential building near Bde Maka Ska in southwest Minneapolis near the St. Louis Park city limits. The new site offered greatly increased height, therefore expanding the signal&#x27;s range. Even with the additional height, the station operates at such low power that it can be heard clearly only within two to three miles of the transmitter. While southwest Minneapolis gets a fairly strong signal, this signal only provides fringe coverage in St. Paul at best (subject to occasional interference from a 197-watt translator of Christian contemporary outlet &quot;The Refuge&quot; in the southern suburb of Elko New Market), and cannot be heard at all in the Minneapolis-St. Paul suburbs except under rare circumstances or with a sensitive receiver. In 2018, KDXL turned in its license, allowing KUOM-FM to broadcast full time, ending the time share agreement between the two stations.

<doc id="1198933" wikidata="Q727717" url="?curid=1198933" title="Ramón Pérez de Ayala">
<text>Ramón Pérez de Ayala y Fernández del Portal (9 August 1880 – 5 August 1962) was a Spanish writer. He was the Spanish ambassador to England in London (1931–1936) and voluntarily exiled himself to Argentina via France because of the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939).
He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature.

==Background==

Pérez de Ayala was educated at Jesuit schools, the experience of which he satirized in the novel &quot;A.M.D.G.&quot; (1910). The novelist Leopoldo Alas was among his professors, and Alas&#x27;s &quot;intellectual novel,&quot; focused on ideas and philosophy, would influence Pérez de Ayala&#x27;s own fiction. There is some debate regarding to which generation of Spanish writers Pérez de Ayala belongs. His early realistic novels reveal ties with the Generation of 98. However, some argue that Ramon Pérez de Ayala was a member of the Generation of 1914, a group which did not entirely fit with either the Generation of 98 or the Generation of 27. Like his political ally José Ortega y Gasset, he was a liberal republican and opposed to the Spanish monarchy, as well as a professed Anglophile who sought to import the English parliamentary system to Spain.

He was elected to the Royal Spanish Academy in 1928, and received nominations for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1931, 1934 and 1947. He was appointed director of the Prado Museum in 1931 a position that he left temporarily in 1932 to become the Spanish ambassador to Britain. Perez de Ayala received an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1936. He was succeeded as director of the Prado Museum by Pablo Picasso in 1936.

After 1916, his novels became increasingly mature and lyrical, his characters becoming symbolic representatives of general human problems. To this period belongs his masterpieces, &quot;Belarmino y Apolonio&quot; (1921) (translated as &quot;Belarmino and Apolonio&quot;), &quot;Tiger Juan&quot; (1926) and &quot;El curandero de su honra&quot; (&quot;The Healer of his Honour&quot;) (1927).

&quot;La paz del sendero&quot; (&quot;The Peace of the Path&quot;) (1903), &quot;El sendero innumerable&quot; (1916), and &quot;El sendero andante&quot; (1921), his major poetic works, show the influence of French symbolism. He also wrote satiric essays and dramatic criticism.

<doc id="1198941" wikidata="Q364023" url="?curid=1198941" title="Pier Luigi Farnese">
<text>Pier Luigi Farnese (19 November 1503 – 10 September 1547) was the first Duke of Castro from 1537 to 1545 and the first Duke of Parma and Piacenza from 1545 to 1547. He was the illegitimate son of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (who later became Pope Paul III). He became a soldier and participated in the sack of Rome in 1527.

==Youth==
Pier Luigi Alessandro Farnese, born in 1503, was the son of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese and Silvia Ruffini. His father would be elected Pope Paul III on 13 October 1534.

In July 1505, Pope Julius II legitimated Pier Luigi so that he could inherit the Farnese family estates. On 23 June, 1513, Pope Leo X published a second legitimation of Pier Luigi. In spite of the legitimations, his illegitimacy tormented Pier Luigi all his life, and doubtless contributed to the formation of his character. The nobility of Piacenza was frequently known to insult him as &quot;the bastard son of the Pope.&quot; He was given a famous humanist tutor, Baldassarre Malosso di Casalmaggiore, nicknamed &quot;Tranquillus,&quot; and quickly developed a love of war and fortifications.

His father was, however, keen to make Pier Luigi the true head of the Farnese family and so arranged a favourable marriage alliance with Gerolama (also known by the spelling &quot;Girolama&quot;) Orsini, daughter of Lodovico, Count of Pitigliano. In 1513 the engagement contract was drawn up, and in 1519 the wedding celebrated.

Despite a loveless marriage, Gerolama remained a faithful devoted wife, tolerating Pier Luigi&#x27;s excesses, brutality, and extravagances with dignity. Delays in the construction at the palace in Gradoli, meant the young couple had to lodge in the Castle at Valentano. The following year their first son Alessandro was born.

==Military career==
Pier Luigi Farnese quickly became the stereotype of a mercenary soldier: wild and amoral. He had courage and daring and while strong and audacious was also sufficiently brutal to offend many observers. Nor did he always fight on the traditional side of the papacy; reversing the pro-Guelph sentiments of the Farnese.

In 1520, at the age of seventeen, he and his brother Ranuccio were already employed as mercenaries in the pay of the Republic of Venice. As a result, he served under the standard of Charles V — remaining with the emperor until 1527, he was present at the Sack of Rome of that year, in which he took part.

While his brother Ranuccio withdrew to Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo to defend the Pope; Pier Luigi crossed the Tiber and quartered his men in the family palace, thus saving it from destruction. Critics accused the Farnese of backing both sides, but Pope Clement VII refused to condemn him. Finally when the plague hit the city, the imperial troops decided to withdraw.

Pier Luigi withdrew from Rome into the Roman countryside, taxing it without mercy and permitting a climate of theft and murder. Pope Clement, tired of this behaviour, eventually threatened him with excommunication, until Cardinal Alexander tried diplomatically to reconcile his son with the pope. In 1528 Pier Luigi, still under imperial pay, fought in Apulia against the French army and distinguished himself in the defence of Manfredonia.

===Captain General of the Church===
When his father was elevated to the papacy as Paul III in 1534, great festivities were celebrated at Valentano, after which Pier Luigi left for Rome.

Paul&#x27;s first action was to make Pier Luigi&#x27;s eldest son, Alessandro Farnese, a cardinal. But Charles V only reluctantly allowed the granting of titles to Pier Luigi over the city of Novara, agreeing an annual pension on the condition that the news was not made public. In the hope of speeding things up, Pier Luigi took direct part in the negotiations while leading troops into the lands occupied by his Farnese relatives. Novara and its surrounding territory was finally established as a marquessate in favour of Pier Luigi, but had to wait until February 1538 until formal investiture could be made.

In the meantime the office of Captain General of the Church had become vacant, and Paul nominated his son on 31 January 1537. Pier Luigi travelled through the Papal States defeating pockets of resistance before arriving in triumph at Piacenza.

===Duke of Castro===

Meanwhile, Paul III gradually recovered the family lands around Castro which had been split after the death of Ranuccio the Elder. To this he added the territory of Ronciglione. Pier Luigi was invested with the titles of &quot;Montalto&quot; which gave the right to export grain without paying taxes; and Paul accepted feudal rights over Canine, Gradoli, Valentano, Latera and Marta. He exchanged the city of Frascati for the fortress at Castro, and at bought Bisenzio from the diocese of Montefiascone. As a final act, Paul created a formal duchy out of the lands and bestowed it upon his son and heirs. The duchy was, however, to come under the direct control of the Holy See.

The Duchy of Castro operated as a functioning State within the Patrimony of Saint Peter. It possessed rich forests full of game, fertile vineyards and fields, and a great number of fortresses. In the consistory of 14 March 1537, the Pope also awarded his son the cities of Nepi and Ronciglione. Pier Luigi was tasked with repairing all the fortresses over which he was now feudal lord. The new Duke commissioned Antonio da Sangallo the Younger to create a new capital, which saw the construction of a citadel, ducal palace and mint.

During his life Pier Luigi gained a certain reputation for cruelty, ruthlessness and decadence. A particular scandal erupted in 1537, when he was accused of what became known as the &quot;rape of Fano&quot;, where he allegedly raped the young bishop of the city, Cosimo Gheri, while marching with his troops. Gheri subsequently died.

In 1538 his son Ottavio married Margaret of Parma, an illegitimate daughter of Emperor Charles V; thus consolidating the friendship between the Farnese and the imperial family. In 1543 another son, Orazio, was sent to France and eventually married Diane de France - an illegitimate daughter of Henry II of France. Finally in 1545 his third son, Ranuccio, was created a cardinal by Paul III.

===Duke of Parma and Piacenza===

Paul III then went on to make Pier Luigi Duke of Parma and Piacenza, properties that had previously been a part of the Papal States. Pier Luigi and his son, Ottavio, declared they would pay 9,000 golden ducati every year to the treasury of the Holy See, and, in exchange, they gave back the Duchies of Camerino and Nepi. Pier Luigi took possession of his new states on 23 September 1546.

===Conspiracy and death===

His tyrannical rule and his taxes gained him the enmities of the cities, which were used to the more sensible authority of the Popes. In addition, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor fostered discontent with the Duke, in part to further his aim of annexing Parma and Piacenza to the Duchy of Milan. Thus the governor of Milan, Ferrante Gonzaga, learning of the aims of the emperor, launched a plot against the Farnese, supported by the marquis Anguissola and Andrea Doria.

Ferrante began to spy on Pier Luigi and sent reports continually to the emperor in Madrid. Pier Luigi did not remain passive; on 4 June 1547 he arranged the marriage of his daughter, Vittoria, with Guidobaldo II della Rovere, the Duke of Urbino. He also continued to work hard on the fortifications of his lands. Charles, concerned about the progress of work in Parma, was persuaded to give free rein to Ferrante to organize a conspiracy against the duke. Marquis Pallavicini Cortemaggiore offered support; but Ferrante preferred to rely on his distant kinsman Louis Gonzaga, Lord of Castel Goffredo and Castiglione, and his brother Count Giovanni Anguissola, governor of Como. Anguissola was able to convince Count Agostino Landi, Marquis Giovan Luigi Confalonieri, and Girolamo Alessandro Pallavicini to join him. After Anguissola and others had stabbed him to death, the conspirators hung his body from a window of his palace in Piacenza. Charles V&#x27;s vicar Ferrante Gonzaga captured the Duchy soon after, although subsequent events led to the return of the duchy to Pier-Luigi&#x27;s son, Ottavio in 1551.

Following the death of his son, Pope Paul met in consistory and had Ferrante accused of the murder - declaring that Ottavio would succeed his father as the new duke and the new Gonfalonier of the Church. Pier Luigi&#x27;s body was brought back and buried in Piacenza; later the body was transported to Parma by his wife Gerolama Orsini and then to the family tomb on the island of Bisentina on Lake Bolsena.

==Marriage and family==
Pier Luigi Farnese had married Girolama Orsini, daughter of Luigi Orsini and wife and first cousin Giulia Conti and paternal granddaughter of the 6th Counts of Pitigliano. They had four children:

*Alessandro Farnese, the oldest son, bishop of Parma and Roman Catholic Cardinal
*Ottavio Farnese, Pier Luigi&#x27;s successor as Duke of Parma
*Ranuccio Farnese, Roman Catholic Cardinal
*Vittoria Farnese, who married Guidubaldo II, Duke of Urbino

He also had an illegitimate son, Orazio, who married Diane de France, illegitimate daughter of Henry II of France.

Letters also exist from Pier Luigi&#x27;s father, Paul III, reproaching him for taking male lovers when on an official mission to the court of the emperor; and another from the chancellor of the Florentine embassy detailing a man-hunt he had mounted in Rome to search for a youth who had refused his advances.

<text>The Getae or Getai ( or , singular Getan) were a large nation who inhabited the regions to either side of the Lower Danube in what is today northern Bulgaria and southern Romania, throughout much of Classical Antiquity. Historians&#x27; main source of information about the Getae are Greek and Roman writers, at least some of whom believed that the Getae were closely related to the neighbouring Thracians to the south, and Dacians to the north. Modern scholars continue to debate the details of these relationships, including the question of whether these three peoples spoke the same language.

The Getae first appear in historical records as fierce opponents of the Persian invasion in 513 BC, as described by the early Greek historian Herodotus. They faded out of historical records during the Roman empire, when many appear to have become Romans while others north of the Danube were gradually overwhelmed by other peoples moving from the north and east towards the Roman frontier.

==Ethnonym==
The ethnonym &quot;Getae&quot; was first used by Herodotus. The root was also used for the Tyragetae, Thyssagetae, Massagetae, and others.

== Getae and Dacians ==
=== Ancient sources ===
Strabo stated in his &quot;Geographica&quot; ( 7BC – 20AD) that the Dacians lived in the western parts of Dacia, &quot;towards Germania and the sources of the Danube&quot;, while the Getae lived in the eastern parts, towards the Black Sea, both south and north of the Danube. He also wrote that the Dacians and Getae spoke the same language, after stating the same about Getae and Thracians.

Strabo&#x27;s account of the lands inhabited by the Getae:
:As for the southern part of Germany beyond the Albis, the portion which is just contiguous to that river is occupied by the Suevi; then immediately adjoining this is the land of the Getae, which, though narrow at first, stretching as it does along the Ister Danube on its southern side and on the opposite side along the mountain-side of the Hercynian Forest (for the land of the Getae also embraces a part of the mountains), afterwards broadens out towards the north as far as the Tyragetae; but I cannot tell the precise boundaries
:they give the name &quot;Ister&quot; to the lower part [of the Danuvius], from the cataracts on to the Pontus, the part which flows past the country of the Getae.

Pliny the Elder, in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; (Natural History), c.77–79AD: &quot;... though various races have occupied the adjacent shores; at one spot the &quot;Getae&quot;, by the Romans called &quot;Daci&quot;&quot;.

Appian, who began writing his &quot;Roman History&quot; under Antoninus Pius, Roman Emperor from 138 to 161, noted: &quot;[B]ut going beyond these rivers in places they rule some of the Celts over the Rhine and the Getae over the Danube, whom they call Dacians&quot;.

Justin, the 3rd century AD Latin historian, wrote in his &quot;Epitome of Pompeius Trogus&quot; that Dacians are spoken of as descendants of the Getae: &quot;Daci quoque suboles Getarum sunt&quot; (The Dacians as well are a scion of the Getae).

In his &quot;Roman History&quot; (c.200AD), Cassius Dio added: &quot;I call the people Dacians, the name used by the natives themselves as well as by the Romans, though I am not ignorant that some Greek writers refer to them as &quot;Getae&quot;, whether that is the right term or not...&quot;. He also said the Dacians lived on both sides of the Lower Danube; the ones south of the river (today&#x27;s northern Bulgaria), in Moesia, were called Moesians, while the ones north of the river were called Dacians. He argued that the Dacians are &quot;Getae or Thracians of Dacian race&quot;: 
=== Modern interpretations ===
There is a dispute among scholars about the relations between the Getae and Dacians, and this dispute also covers the interpretation of ancient sources. Some historians such as Ronald Arthur Crossland state that even Ancient Greeks used the two designations &quot;interchangeable or with some confusion&quot;. Thus, it is generally considered that the two groups were related to a certain degree; the exact relation is a matter of controversy.

==== Same people ====

Strabo, as well as other ancient sources, led some modern historians to consider that, if the Thracian ethnic group should be divided, one of this divisions should be the &quot;Daco-Getae&quot;. The linguist Ivan Duridanov also identified a &quot;Dacian linguistic area&quot; in Dacia, Scythia Minor, Lower Moesia, and Upper Moesia.

Romanian scholars generally went further with the identification, historian Constantin C. Giurescu claiming the two were identical. The archaeologist Mircea Babeș spoke of a &quot;veritable ethno-cultural unity&quot; between the Getae and the Dacians. According to Glanville Price, the account of the Greek geographer Strabo shows that the Getae and the Dacians were one and the same people.
Others who support the identity between Getae and Dacians with ancient sources include freelance writer James Minahan and Catherine B Avery, who claim the people whom the Greek called &quot;Getae&quot; were called &quot;Daci&quot; by the Romans. This same belief is stated by some British historians such as David Sandler Berkowitz and Philip Matyszak. The Bulgarian historian and thracologist Alexander Fol considers that the Getae became known as &quot;Dacians&quot; in Greek and Latin in the writings of Caesar, Strabo and Pliny the Elder, as Roman observers adopted the name of the Dacian tribe to refer to all the unconquered inhabitants north of the Danube. Also, Edward Bunbury believed the name of Getae, by which they were originally known to the Greeks on the Euxine, was always retained by the latter in common usage: while that of Dacians, whatever be its origin, was that by which the more western tribes, adjoining the Pannonians, first became known to the Romans. Some scholars consider the Getae and Dacians to be the same people at different stages of their history and discuss their culture as &quot;Geto-Dacian&quot;.

==== Same language, distinct people ====
Historian and archaeologist Alexandru Vulpe found a remarkable uniformity of the Geto-Dacian culture; however, he is one of the few Romanian archaeologists to make a clear distinction between the Getae and Dacians, arguing against the traditional position of the Romanian historiography that considered the two people the same. Nevertheless, he chose to use the term &quot;Geto-Dacians&quot; as a conventional concept for the Thracian tribes inhabiting the future territory of Romania, not necessarily meaning an &quot;absolute ethnic, linguistic or historical unity&quot;.

Crossland suggested the two designations may refer to two groups of a &quot;linguistically homogeneous people&quot; that had come to historical prominence at two distinct periods of time. He also compared the probable linguistic situation with the relation between modern Norwegian and Danish languages. Paul Lachlan MacKendrick considered the two as &quot;branches&quot; of the same tribe, speaking two dialects of a common language.

The Romanian historian of ideas and historiographer Lucian Boia stated: &quot;At a certain point, the phrase Geto-Dacian was coined in the Romanian historiography to suggest a unity of Getae and Dacians&quot;. Lucian Boia took a sceptical position, arguing the ancient writers distinguished among the two people, treating them as two distinct groups of the Thracian ethnos. Boia contended that it would be naive to assume Strabo knew the Thracian dialects so well, alleging that Strabo had &quot;no competence in the field of Thracian dialects&quot;. The latter claim is contested, some studies attesting Strabo&#x27;s reliability and sources. There is no reason to disregard Strabo&#x27;s belief that the Daci and the Getae spoke the same language. Boia also stressed that some Romanian authors cited Strabo indiscriminately.

A similar position was adopted by Romanian historian and archaeologist G. A. Niculescu, who also criticized the Romanian historiography and the archaeological interpretation, particularly on the &quot;Geto-Dacian&quot; culture. In his opinion, Alexandru Vulpe saw ancient people as modern nations, leading the latter to interpret the common language as a sign of a common people, despite Strabo making a distinction between the two.

== History ==
=== 7th – 4th centuries BC ===
From the 7th century BC onwards, the Getae came into economic and cultural contact with the Greeks, who were establishing colonies on the western side of Pontus Euxinus, nowadays the Black Sea. The Getae are mentioned for the first time together in Herodotus in his narrative of the Scythian campaign of Darius I in 513BC, during which the latter conquered the Getae. According to Herodotus, the Getae differed from other Thracian tribes in their religion, centered around the god (&quot;daimon&quot;) Zalmoxis whom some of the Getae called Gebeleizis. 

Between the 5th and 3rd centuries BC, the Getae were mostly under the rule of the flourishing Odrysian kingdom. During this time, the Getae provided military services and became famous for their cavalry. After the disintegration of the Odrysian kingdom, smaller Getic principalities began to consolidate themselves.

=== Prosperity ===
Before setting out on his Persian expedition, Alexander the Great defeated the Getae and razed one of their settlements. In 313BC, the Getae formed an alliance with Callatis, Odessos, and other western Pontic Greek colonies against Lysimachus, who held a fortress at Tirizis (modern Kaliakra).

The Getae flourished especially in the first half of the 3rd century BC. By about 200BC, the authority of the Getic prince, Zalmodegicus, stretched as far as Histria, as a contemporary inscription shows. Other strong princes included Zoltes and Rhemaxos (about 180BC). Also, several Getic rulers minted their own coins. The ancient authors Strabo and Cassius Dio say that Getae practiced ruler cult, and this is confirmed by archaeological remains.

=== Conflict with Rome ===
In 72–71 BC Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus became the first Roman commander to march against the Getae. This was done to strike at the western Pontic allies of Mithridates VI, but he had limited success. A decade later, a coalition of Scythians, Getae, Bastarnae and Greek colonists defeated C.Antonius Hybrida at Histria. This victory over the Romans allowed Burebista, the leader of this coalition, to dominate the region for a short period (60–50 BC).

In the mid-first century BC Burebista organized a kingdom consisting of descendants of those whom the Greeks had called &quot;Getae&quot;, as well as Dacians, or &quot;Daci&quot;, the name applied to people of the region by the Romans.

Augustus aimed at subjugating the entire Balkan peninsula, and used an incursion of the Bastarnae across the Danube as a pretext to devastate the Getae and Thracians. He put Marcus Licinius Crassus in charge of the plan. In 29BC, Crassus defeated the Bastarnae with the help of the Getic prince Rholes. Crassus promised him help for his support against the Getic ruler Dapyx. After Crassus had reached as far the Danube Delta, Rholes was appointed king and returned to Rome. In 16BC, the Sarmatae invaded the Getic territory and were driven back by Roman troops. The Getae were placed under the control of the Roman vassal king in Thrace, Rhoemetalces I. In 6AD, the province of Moesia was founded, incorporating the Getae south of the Danube River. The Getae north of the Danube continued tribal autonomy outside the Roman Empire.

== Culture ==
According to Herodotus, the Getae were &quot;the noblest as well as the most just of all the Thracian tribes&quot;. When the Persians, led by Darius the Great, campaigned against the Scythians, the Thracian tribes in the Balkans surrendered to Darius on his way to Scythia, and only the Getae offered resistance.

One episode from the history of the Getae is attested by several ancient writers.

When Lysimachus tried to subdue the Getae he was defeated by them. The Getae king, Dromichaetes, took him prisoner but he treated him well and convinced Lysimachus there is more to gain as an ally than as an enemy of the Getae and released him. According to Diodorus, Dromichaetes entertained Lysimachus at his palace at Helis, where food was served on gold and silver plates. The discovery of the celebrated tomb at Sveshtari (1982) suggests that Helis was located perhaps in its vicinity, where remains of a large antique city are found along with dozens of other Thracian mound tombs.

As stated earlier, just like the Dacians, the principal god of the Getae was Zalmoxis whom they sometimes called Gebeleizis.

Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Naturalis Historia&quot; mentions a tribe called the Tyragetae, apparently a Daco-Thracian tribe who dwelt by the river Tyras (the Dniester). Their tribal name appears to be a combination of &quot;Tyras&quot; and &quot;Getae&quot;; see also the names Thyssagetae and Massagetae.

The Roman poet Ovid, during his long exile in Tomis, is asserted to have written poetry (now lost) in the Getic language. In his &quot;Epistulae ex Ponto&quot;, written from the northern coast of the Black Sea, he asserts that two major, distinct languages were spoken by the sundry tribes of Scythia, which he referred to as Getic, and Sarmatian.

== Physical appearance ==

Jerome (Letter CVII to Laeta. II) described the Getae as red and yellow-haired, though he may be referring to the Goths, with whom the Getae were sometimes confused in Late Antiquity.

==Fringe views on alternative origins==

=== Suggested link to Goths ===

The Getae are sometimes confused with the Goths in works of early medieval authors. This confusion is notably expanded on in works of Jordanes, himself of Gothic background, who transferred earlier historical narratives about the Getae to the Goths. At the close of the 4th century AD, Claudian, court poet to the emperor Honorius and the patrician Stilicho, uses the ethnonym &quot;Getae&quot; to refer to the Visigoths.

During 5th and 6th centuries, several historians and ethnographers (Marcellinus Comes, Orosius, John Lydus, Isidore of Seville, Procopius of Caesarea) used the same ethnonym &quot;Getae&quot; to name populations invading the Eastern Roman Empire (Goths, Gepids, Kutrigurs, Slavs). For instance, in the third book of the &quot;&quot; Procopius details: &quot;There were many Gothic nations in earlier times, just as also at the present, but the greatest and most important of all are the Goths, Vandals, Visigoths, and Gepaedes. In ancient times, however, they were named Sauromatae and Melanchlaeni; and there were some too who called these nations Getic.&quot; The Getae were considered the same people as the Goths by Jordanes in his &quot;Getica&quot; written at the middle of the 6th century. He also claims that at one point the &quot;Getae&quot; migrated out of Scandza, while identifying their deity Zalmoxis as a Gothic king. Jordanes assumed the earlier testimony of Orosius. The 9th-century work &quot;De Universo&quot; of Rabanus Maurus states, &quot;The Massagetae are in origin from the tribe of the Scythians, and are called Massagetae, as if heavy, that is, strong Getae.

=== Suggested link to Jats ===
There have long been attempts to link the Getae and Massagetae to the Jats of South Asia. Likewise, the Dacians have been linked to the Dahae of Central Asia (and the Dahae to the Dasas of South Asia).W. W. Hunter claimed in 1886, suggested that the Jats were an Iranian people – most likely Scythian/Saka in origin, Alexander Cunningham (1888) believed that references in classical European sourceslike Strabo, Ptolemy and Plinyto peoples such as the &quot;Zaths&quot;, may have been the Getae and/or Jats. More recent authors, like Tadeusz Sulimirski, Weer Rajendra Rishi, and Chandra Chakraberty, have also linked the Getae and Jats.

Less credible, however, are parallel claims by Alexander Cunningham that the &quot;Xanthii&quot; (or &quot;Zanthi&quot;) and &quot;Iatioi&quot;mentioned by Strabo, Ptolemy and Plinymay have been synonymous with the Getae and/or Jats. The &quot;Xanthii&quot; were later established to be a subgroup (tribe or clan) of the Dahae. Subsequent scholars, such as Edwin Pulleyblank, Josef Markwart (also known as Joseph Marquart) and László Torday, suggest that &quot;Iatioi&quot; may be another name for a people known in classical Chinese sources as the Yuezhi and in South Asian contexts as the &quot;Kuṣānas&quot; (or Kushans).

<text>In mathematics, a series or integral is said to be conditionally convergent if it converges, but it does not converge absolutely.

==Definition==
More precisely, a series of real numbers formula_1 is said to converge conditionally if 
formula_2 exists (as a finite real number, i.e. not formula_3 or formula_4), but formula_5

A classic example is the alternating harmonic series given by formula_6 which converges to formula_7, but is not absolutely convergent (see Harmonic series).

Bernhard Riemann proved that a conditionally convergent series may be rearranged to converge to any value at all, including ∞ or −∞; see Riemann series theorem. Agnew&#x27;s theorem describes rearrangements that preserve convergence for all convergent series.

The Lévy–Steinitz theorem identifies the set of values to which a series of terms in R&quot;n&quot; can converge.

A typical conditionally convergent integral is that on the non-negative real axis of formula_8 (see Fresnel integral).

<text>WMMR (93.3 FM, &quot;93-3 WMMR&quot;) is a commercial radio station licensed to serve Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The station is owned by the Beasley Broadcast Group through licensee Beasley Media Group, LLC and broadcasts an active rock radio format. The station&#x27;s studios and offices are located in Bala Cynwyd and the transmitter is atop One Liberty Place at () in Center City Philadelphia.

WMMR broadcasts using HD Radio. Its HD2 subchannel plays live rock performances and sessions in WMMR&#x27;s studios.

WMMR carries Philadelphia Flyers hockey games when its all-sports sister station 97.5 WPEN is airing another sporting event and cannot broadcast the Flyers game. WMMR is the home of &quot;Preston and Steve&quot;, heard weekday mornings, and midday personality Pierre Robert, heard on WMMR since 1981.

In 2014, WMMR was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in its &quot;Heritage Rock Stations&quot; category.

==History==
===1940s===
On February 11, 1941, the Federal Communications Commission granted Pennsylvania Broadcasting Company a construction permit for a new FM station on 44.7 MHz on the original 42-50 MHz FM broadcast band with the W47PH call sign. The construction permit was modified on November 4, 1941, when the FCC reallocated the station to 44.9 MHz with a corresponding call sign change to W49PH. The FCC also on this date granted the station authority for the first time to begin broadcasting. The station signed on for the first time on April 20, 1942, and was granted its first license on March 2, 1943. Programming was initially a simulcast of sister station AM 610 WIP.

On November 1, 1943, the station was assigned the WIP-FM call sign. After the FCC created the current FM broadcast band on June 27, 1945, Pennsylvania Broadcasting applied to the FCC for a construction permit on October 24, 1946, to install a new transmitter and antenna for operation on 97.5 MHz. On July 10, 1947, the FCC reallocated the station to 93.3 MHz, modifying the construction permit. The commission granted Pennsylvania Broadcasting a new license for the station for operation on 93.3 MHz on December 22, 1948.

===1950s and 1960s===
In the 1950s and 1960s, WIP-FM carried a full service format of middle of the road (MOR) music, news, sports and talk. The station&#x27;s license was voluntarily reassigned by the FCC to WIP Broadcasting, Inc. on September 17, 1958, followed by another voluntary reassignment to Metropolitan Broadcasting Corporation on December 29, 1959. The FCC granted a licensee name change from Metropolitan Broadcasting Corporation to Metromedia, Inc. on May 11, 1961. On August 6, 1962, Metromedia applied for a construction permit to relocate the station&#x27;s transmitter and antenna in Philadelphia from 35 South 9th Street to 12 South 12th Street at the Loews Philadelphia Hotel. This resulted in raising the station&#x27;s height above average terrain (HAAT) from 430 feet to 668 feet, while decreasing the station&#x27;s effective radiated power (ERP) from 20,000 watts to 7,500 watts. The FCC granted Metromedia a new license for the station with the new facilities on September 30, 1963.

On July 1, 1966, the station&#x27;s call sign was changed to WMMR. The call sign reflected the name of the station&#x27;s owner, &quot;Metromedia&quot; (and &quot;Radio&quot;). From 1948 to 1993, WMMR was used unofficially as a slogan by a local student-run carrier current radio station at the University of Minnesota. The MOR format was still being used, but with different programming from the AM side, although the AM disc jockeys&#x27; announcements were used for both stations. Studios of WIP and WMMR were on 19th Street near Rittenhouse Square.

Beginning in 1968, WMMR began adopting a progressive rock format, similar to that of several Metromedia-owned stations including WNEW-FM in New York City. WNEW-FM and WMMR had a close relationship, ran similar promotions, and sometimes featured each other&#x27;s disc jockeys on the air. WMMS in Cleveland, KMET in Los Angeles, and KSAN in San Francisco were also part of the Metromedia chain and also helped pioneer the progressive rock format in the 1960s.

Dave Herman was WMMR&#x27;s first rock DJ. His show, dubbed &quot;The Marconi Experiment,&quot; debuted on April 29, 1968. Before Herman&#x27;s arrival, WMMR ran an &quot;MOR&quot; format, including programs such as &quot;Sinatra and Company&quot;. &quot;The Marconi Experiment&quot; was very much an experiment for the station, with progressive rock still new to the FM band. The first song played on the show was &quot;Flying&quot; by The Beatles. Over the instrumental song, Herman recited these words: &quot;Arise my heart, and fill your voice with music. For he who shares not dawn with his song, is one of the sons of ever darkness.&quot; This was known as &quot;The Incantation&quot; and continued as the regular show opening.

Several Philadelphia FM stations tried to compete with WMMR in the late 1960s, including WIFI and WDAS-FM. Neither station stayed with the rock format for long. In 1970, WIFI switched to a Top 40 format, while WDAS-FM changed format around 1971 to reflect its AM counterpart as an urban contemporary station.

===1970s===
Michael Cuscuna from the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s WXPN replaced Herman in 1970, but was quickly hired away by WABC-FM (now WPLJ) in New York City. Michael Tearson, also from WXPN, replaced Cuscuna and remained a mainstay at WMMR for over 20 years. Herman went to WABC-FM and then for a couple of decades on WNEW-FM, and later on WXRK. Tearson later worked at WMGK in Philadelphia, from April 2002 until January 2013. He was also heard on Sirius XM&#x27;s Deep Tracks channel.

Later in the 1970s, two other Philadelphia radio stations became competitors: WYSP (formerly WIBG-FM) and WIOQ. WYSP later became a classic rock outlet while WIOQ became a Top 40 radio station.

One of WMMR&#x27;s most influential disc jockeys during the 1970s was Ed Sciaky, who was known for playing and boosting the careers of new artists such as Billy Joel and Yes. Sciaky is credited with introducing Bruce Springsteen to Philadelphia, and decades later, the city remains one of Springsteen&#x27;s strongest fan bases and the scenes of many of his best-received concerts. WMMR alumni include David Dye, host of the &quot;World Cafe&quot; on WXPN and syndicated on many NPR stations. Another former WMMR DJ is Nick Spitzer, now a New Orleans resident and host of &quot;American Routes&quot; on NPR. One-time WMMR midday DJ Dick Hungate later switched to WYSP, pioneering the classic rock format in Philadelphia. John DeBella, now hosting mornings on co-owned WMGK, was the morning drive time DJ for many years, alongside newscaster and sidekick Mark &quot;The Shark&quot; Drucker, who later was a reporter on all-news KYW. Some WMMR DJs such as Dave Herman and Carol Miller would later go onto longtime careers on New York stations.

===1980s===
On July 17, 1980, Metromedia applied for a construction permit to increase the station&#x27;s ERP to 29,000 watts. The FCC granted the permit on July 17, 1981, followed by a new license with the upgraded facilities on August 1, 1981.

WMMR&#x27;s license was transferred to Metropolitan Broadcasting Corporation on October 22, 1986.

On October 26, 1987, Metropolitan Broadcasting applied for a construction permit to change the transmitter location to &quot;Building Rooftop 1650 Market St., Philadelphia, PA&quot; (the address of One Liberty Place) and increase the station&#x27;s HAAT to . The FCC granted the permit on May 1, 1989. On October 26, 1989, WMMR was purchased by Group W Radio Acquisition Company, with the sale consummating on December 7, 1989, thus becoming a sister station to KYW-TV and KYW radio.

===1990s===
Group W Radio modified the construction permit on February 12, 1992, by decreasing the HAAT to and changing the ERP to 18,000 watts. The FCC granted the change on March 9, 1992. The FCC granted a new license with the new facilities on January 6, 1997.

Greater Los Angeles Radio, Inc., a division of Greater Media, purchased WMMR, with the sale consummating on August 22, 1997.

===2000s===
In May 2005, the station began airing the &quot;Preston &amp; Steve&quot; show in morning drive, which was previously heard on WPLY. In early 2006, WMMR launched its digital HD2 subchannel with the &quot;WMMaRchives&quot; format, airing the station&#x27;s archive of live and studio performances.

===2010s===
On July 19, 2016, Beasley Media Group announced it would acquire Greater Media and its 21 stations (including WMMR) for $240 million. The FCC approved the sale on October 6, and the sale closed on November 1.

===2020s===
In 2021, midday DJ Pierre Robert celebrated his 40th year on the air at WMMR. The Philadelphia City Council passed a resolution to declare November 24 as Pierre Robert Day.

For many years, WMMR prided itself on having live and local DJs 24/7/365, a rarity in modern radio. This run would end in October 2022, when owners Beasley Media made major cuts to the staff of WMMR and other stations, resulting in the elimination of the live overnight block. Among those laid off were 18-year WMMR afternoon host Paul Jaxon.

==Awards==
In 2007, WMMR was nominated for the &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; magazine award for &quot;Active Rock Station of the Year&quot; in a top 25 market. Other nominees included WIYY in Baltimore, WAAF in Boston, KBPI in Denver, WRIF in Detroit, and KISW in Seattle.

In 2010, the station was honored by the National Association of Broadcasters with the Marconi Award for &quot;Rock Station of the Year&quot;. WMMR has also been honored as the Major Market Radio Station of the Year by the rock community RadioContraband in both 2011 and 2012. In the late 1980s, WMMR was recognized as one of the best rock stations in America by &quot;Rolling Stone Magazine&quot;.

In 2014, WMMR was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the &quot;Heritage Rock Stations&quot; category.

<text>Music from The Body is the soundtrack album to Roy Battersby&#x27;s 1970 documentary film &quot;The Body&quot;, about human biology, narrated by Vanessa Redgrave and Frank Finlay.

==History==
The music was composed in collaboration between Pink Floyd member Roger Waters and Ron Geesin, who worked together on &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; the same year, and employs biomusic, including, on the first track, sounds made by the human body (slaps, breathing, laughing, whispering, flatulence, etc.), in addition to more traditional guitar, piano and stringed instruments. The album&#x27;s final track, &quot;Give Birth to a Smile&quot;, features all four members of Pink Floyd, plus Geesin on piano, although David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright are uncredited.

The child heard on opening track is Ron&#x27;s son Joe Geesin.

The LP, being a complete re-recording of the score, features a different track listing from the original film soundtrack, and a 3 sided acetate does exist of the full version. The cover of the album features a Transparent Anatomical Manikin (TAM).

Waters did not release another album outside of Pink Floyd until 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot;.

<text>DPOF (Digital Print Order Format) is a format which allows the user of a digital camera or other device such as a mobile phone or PDA to define which captured images on the storage card are to be printed, together with information on the number of copies or other image information such as paper size, image title text, image orientation, contact information and more.

DPOF usually consists of a set of text files in a special directory on the storage card. This option can be accessed through one of the menu modes on the camera. The storage card can then be taken to a or output through compatible desktop printers at home.

DPOF was developed by a consortium of printer and camera manufacturers including Canon, Inc., Eastman Kodak, Fujifilm and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Originally released in October 1998, the specification was updated to version 1.10 on July 17, 2000.

The current version adds features which include
* Printing multiple images on one sheet (contact sheets)
* Specifying the size of the print
* Sending images via fax and Internet transmissions
* Support for slide shows through an auto-play feature.

<doc id="1198981" wikidata="Q521402" url="?curid=1198981" title="Raoul of Mérencourt">
<text>Raoul of Mérencourt (also called Ralph or Radulfus) was the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem from 1214 to 1224, succeeding the assassinated Albert Avogadro.

==Early career in patriarchal service==
Raoul was a native of the County of Champagne. He seems to have come to the Holy Land as part of the entourage following Henry II, count of Champagne and future husband of Isabella I, queen of Jerusalem. Raoul worked as a notary in the Haute Cour in Acre. In 1206, Albert, formerly bishop of Vercelli, arrived as the new patriarch, following upon Soffredo Gaetani, who resigned the office after only one year, and went off to join the Fourth Crusade in Constantinople.

In 1208, Albert sent Raoul as part of an official delegation to Philip Augustus, king of France, to seek a husband and king-consort for the young heiress to the throne of Jerusalem, Maria of Montferrat. King Philip Augustus, with the encouragement of Blanche of Navarre, countess-regent of Champagne, selected one of her feudal vassals, John of Brienne. John held the title of count of Brienne on behalf of his brother Walter (Gautier) of Brienne, whose cause had briefly attracted the young Giovanni Bernadone (later Francis of Assisi) to his cause. At Walter&#x27;s death in 1205, John held the county as guardian for Walter&#x27;s son, later to become count of Jaffa.

John of Brienne arrived in Acre on 13 September 1210 and married Maria the following day, the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, the major feast of the kingdom of Jerusalem. The two were then crowned King and Queen of Jerusalem on 3 October in the cathedral of Tyre. The patriarch recommended Raoul to become the chancellor and guide for the newly arrived monarch. Queen Maria died shortly after giving birth to their daughter Yolanda, officially known as Isabella II. The barons of the kingdom were uncertain of John of Brienne&#x27;s ability to lead. In 1211, Albert sent Raoul to seek the counsel of Pope Innocent III. He returned with clear instructions to support John as regent-king for his daughter.

==Patriarch==
===Election===
At Albert&#x27;s assassination on 14 September 1214, while in procession to the cathedral of the Holy Cross in Acre, the post of patriarch became open. The canons of the Holy Sepulchre, following their own custom in imitation of the Acts of the Apostles, selected two candidates to succeed Albert. One candidate was Lotario Rosario de Cremona, who had originally succeeded Albert as bishop of Vercelli, but who later became archbishop of Pisa. He occupied a position in the Roman hierarchy that was very similar to the esteem enjoined by Albert. The second candidate was the King of Jerusalem&#x27;s own chancellor, Raoul of Mérencourt, who also held the episcopal see of Sidon. He was one of only three bishops installed by Albert during his years as patriarch. The king came down on the side of his chancellor and fellow countryman. Pope Innocent III ratified that choice, and Raoul was installed as patriarch during the Fourth Lateran Council, which took place in November 1215.

===Fifth Crusade===
Along with Pope Innocent III, Raoul gave a sermon on the first day of the council (11 November 1215) calling for a new crusade to recover the Holy Land. Further preparations for the crusade (the Fifth) were made on the last day of the council, 30 November. However, for various reasons the crusade was postponed until 1217, after the death of Innocent. Raoul was appointed as one of Pope Honorius III&#x27;s papal legates, and was escorted back to his see in Acre by John of Brienne, the nominal King of Jerusalem.

Raoul personally participated in the crusade against Egypt. The assembled crusader armies left Acre for Damietta in Egypt during the last days of May 1218. On the 29 August 1219 an attack on Damietta failed, as St. Francis of Assisi had predicted. The successful taking of Damietta occurred by 5 November 1219. It is recounted that at one point the patriarch carried a relic of the True Cross, and prostrated himself with his head buried under the sand in order to ensure the success of the siege at Damietta. The whole crusade came to a disastrous end on 29 August 1221, when the crusading armies were trapped by the flooding waters of the Nile and the combined armies of the sultan, al-Kamil, and his two brothers, al-Mu&#x27;azzam and al-Ashraf. The sultan, after allowing the hostages to be ransomed, agreed to an eight-year truce.

===Preparations for the Sixth Crusade===
In 1222 the pope summoned John of Brienne, King of Jerusalem; Pelagius Galvani, the papal legate; patriarch Raoul, and other leaders to attend a meeting with him and the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II to be held in Verona on 11 November. The pope&#x27;s illness forced the meeting to be postponed until 23 March 1223 at the imperial villa in Ferentino. There they struck an agreement to have King John&#x27;s young daughter Yolande of Brienne marry the newly widowed Emperor Frederick II. Frederick then agreed to lead the next crusade and to have his fleet depart from Europe by 24 June 1225.

On 1 March 1224 Honorius III wrote to the patriarch of Jerusalem of the imminent departure of the imperial fleet, and to prepare for the marriage of Yolanda of Brienne (later to become Isabella II) to the emperor. Any and all impediments were to be cleared away. Patriarch Raoul, John of Brienne and Hermann von Salza met with the pope in the summer of 1224 to deal with the emperor&#x27;s announcement that conditions in Sicily had so deteriorated that he could not possibly depart for the Holy Land at this time. A new date for departure was arrived at. As a new patriarch was nominated and in place by May 1225, it would seem that Raoul died in late 1224. His replacement, Gérold of Lausanne, bishop of Valence and former abbot of Cluny, was elected on 10 May 1225.

<text>The Szózat (; in English: &quot;The Appeal&quot;) is a Hungarian patriotic song. De facto, it is regarded as &quot;the second national anthem&quot; of Hungary, beside the Himnusz, which is a constitutionally defined state symbol.

The lyrics were written in 1836 by Mihály Vörösmarty and set to music in 1840 by Béni Egressy for the award of András Bartay, head of the National Theatre. It was first performed in the National Theatre on 10th May 1843. There was a fierce debate in the era whether the Szózat or the Himnusz was supposed to be the anthem of the country.

== Comparison to &quot;Himnusz&quot; ==
The title of Vörösmarty&#x27;s work defines the situation: it is a speech, oration of a raconteur (the poet) to the Hungarian people. Although the Szózat of Vörösmarty touches similar thoughts as the poems of Ferenc Kölcsey, even as continuing his train of thought, its intonation is entirely different. Himnusz (Hymn) is a prayer, but Szózat acts rather like a speech, addressing the listener/reader by the narrator in the role of an orator. Furthermore, as a prayer, Himnusz becomes almost a begging for the last verse, while Szózat is much more uplifting, unfaltering, inspiring for patriotism and loyalty. However, it also reckons with the concerns of Himnusz, sees the death of the nation as a possibility: &#x27;Or it will come, if it must come, The glorious death&#x27;. At the same time it finds possible the coming of a better era: &#x27;There yet shall come … that better, fairer day&#x27;. The poem deals with the past in three, with the future in six verses.

== Lyrics ==
It was translated to English by Watson Kirkconnell, a Canadian writer and academic.

<doc id="1198987" wikidata="Q1532274" url="?curid=1198987" title="Lost Embrace">
<text>Lost Embrace is a 2004 internationally co-produced comedy-drama film, directed by Daniel Burman and written by Burman and Marcelo Birmajer. The film features Daniel Hendler, Adriana Aizemberg, Jorge D&#x27;Elía, among others.

The drama was Argentina&#x27;s official choice for the 2004 Oscar Awards, Foreign Language film category.

The comedy-drama tells of Ariel Makaroff, the grandson of Holocaust-era Polish refugees, who is currently on a complex search for his personal and cultural identity.

==Plot==
The episodes in the life of a Jewish family in the Once neighborhood of Buenos Aires and the other shopkeepers in a low-rent commercial gallery are depicted in the story.

The narrator, Ariel Makaroff (Daniel Hendler), is the son of Sonia Makaroff (Adriana Aizemberg) who was deserted by her husband (Jorge D&#x27;Elía) when he went to Israel in 1973 to fight in the Yom Kippur War. Yet, the father is in touch with Sonia via telephone weekly and supports Ariel and his brother Joseph (Sergio Boris). Sonia runs a lingerie shop in the gallery.

Ariel is a young man in a hurry without much of a sense of direction. He&#x27;s having an affair with Rita (Silvina Bosco), an older woman, pines for his former girlfriend Estella (Melina Petriella), and fantasizes of emigrating to Poland, where his family came from during World War II.

He carps at his grandmother (Rosita Londner) for immigration documents that will support his claim to Polish citizenship as he wants to become
&quot;European.&quot; This forces his grandmother to remember her memories of Holocaust Poland.

Ariel also visits the rabbi in order to get documents. One of them has been cut in a corner and the rabbi explains: &quot;So, no one can use it again.&quot;
- &quot;Oh! Like circumcision!&quot;, Ariel retorts. Like Woody Allen in &quot;Deconstructed Harry&quot;, Burman takes an ironic stand against circumcision.

At one point, the shop owners organize a race against another group of merchants. They hope to earn a cash purse and fix up the exterior of their gallery and install air conditioning.

Other characters include: a large Italian family whose noisy arguments drown out the radios in their radio repair shop; a quiet Korean couple who run a &quot;feng shui&quot; boutique; Mitelman (Diego Korol) who runs a travel agency, but which is really a front for currency smuggling; and a solitary stationer named Osvaldo (Isaac Fajm).

Right before the big race his father suddenly shows up in Buenos Aires. His mother confesses to Ariel that his father left Argentina and the family because she had a brief affair with Osvaldo, the retailer next door. It was a one time thing and did not mean anything but it ruined the marriage. Ariel finally gets to hear his father&#x27;s side of the story: he could not get over the fact that his mother had betrayed him with Osvaldo. Elías can finally enfold his son in a long-overdue embrace, and Ariel embraces his father as well in the closing moments of the film.

The grandmother sings a klezmer song over the closing credits.

==Background==
&quot;Lost Embrace&quot; is part of a loose trilogy of films. The other two are: &quot;Esperando al mesías&quot; (2000) and &quot;Derecho de familia&quot; (2006). All were written and directed by Burman and star Daniel Hendler. They are largely autobiographical, dealing with the life of a young Jew in contemporary Buenos Aires.

===Title===
The name of the film in Spanish is an intentional pun: &quot;abrazo&quot; means &quot;embrace&quot; and does not make sense followed by &quot;partido&quot; &quot;broken&quot; or &quot;gone,&quot; but the idiom &quot;a brazo partido,&quot; literally &quot;with a broken arm,&quot; means &quot;to fight forcefully, strenuously.&quot; It could also be understood as &quot;the halved hug,&quot; that is, an incompleted hug or made with just one arm.

==Distribution==
The film was first featured at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 9, 2004. It opened in Argentina on March 25, 2004.

The film screened in many film festivals, including: the Helsinki International Film Festival, Finland; the Warsaw Film Festival, Poland; the Pusan International Film Festival, South Korea; the Chicago International Film Festival, United States; the Bangkok World Film Festival, Thailand; the São Paulo International Film Festival, Brazil; the London Film Festival, UK; and others.

The film was released in Argentina on VHS and DVD by Argentina Video Home under license from Distribution Company on July 3, 2004; with English, Portuguese and Spanish subtitles and extras. It was re-issued on DVD by SBP on March 13, 2013, with the same specifications besides the removal of Portuguese subtitles.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Lost Embrace&quot; garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics. On review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an overall 83% approval rating based on 48 reviews, with a rating average of 6.7 out of 10. The site&#x27;s consensus is: &quot;A low-key but charming tale that will put a smile on your face.&quot; At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 0–100 reviews from film critics, the film has a rating score of 70 based on 23 reviews, classified as a generally favorably reviewed film.

Film critic A.O. Scott, film critic for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; liked the direction of the film, writing, &quot;&quot;Lost Embrace&quot; never feels strenuous or overdone. The tenderness of the family drama at its center, and the deep, hard-to-articulate feelings of a son for his enigmatic father and his heroically patient mother, emerge with a charming haphazardness. The sly artfulness is apparent only in retrospect. This is a small movie about a small world, but its modesty is part of what makes it durable and satisfying.&quot;

Kenneth Turan, film critic for the &quot;Los Angeles Times,&quot; liked the films direction and wrote, &quot;Director (and co-writer) Burman displays an assured but intimate filmmaking style, at once casual, playful and idiosyncratic. With key sections of the film related by Ariel in voice-over, it&#x27;s also a style that fosters complicity and connection with a central character who otherwise might not be a personal favorite.&quot;

Peter Keough, critic for the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot;, also liked Burman&#x27;s direction, though at times he said the film felt a bit derivative, and wrote, &quot;Burman captures with an affection and an irony that match François Truffaut&#x27;s, though his stylistic mannerisms can seem a little imitative.&quot;

The &quot;Boston Globe&quot; film critic, Wesley Morris, was impressed by the comedy, and wrote, &quot;&quot;Lost Embrace&quot; has a novelist&#x27;s human touch. Were it a book, it would go somewhere on the shelf with Jonathan Safran Foer and early Philip Roth. It also possesses traces of early Jean-Luc Godard and his wit with characters, as well as some of Wes Anderson&#x27;s random silliness. But unlike in Godard and Anderson, an emotional undercurrent runs beneath this movie, and Burman makes that feel good without feeling strained.&quot;

<text>Cuthwyn Ellery Hanley (born 27 March 1961) is an English former rugby league player and coach. Over a nineteen-year professional career (1978–1997), he played for Bradford Northern, Wigan, Balmain, Western Suburbs and Leeds. He won 36 caps for Great Britain, captaining the team from 1988 to 1992, and 2 for England. Nicknamed &#x27;Mr Magic&#x27; and &#x27;The Black Pearl&#x27;, he played most often as a or after starting out as a or .

Hanley won the Man of Steel Award a record three times, the Lance Todd Trophy once, and the Golden Boot in 1988. He was awarded the MBE in January 1990 for services to the game. In 2005 he was inducted into the Rugby Football League Hall of Fame.

After his playing career, he had spells as head coach of Great Britain, St Helens and Doncaster.

==Early life==
Born in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, Hanley grew up in Potternewton, near Chapeltown. His parents originated from Saint Kitts. He is the father of Umyla Hanley, who currently plays in Super League for the Leigh Leopards.

==Club career==
===Bradford Northern===
In 1978, Hanley signed for Bradford Northern from the junior club Corpus Christi. On 26 November 1978, he made his professional début for Northern against Rochdale Hornets in a League Division One match. He helped his club to a 30–18 victory, by scoring a try on his début. He established a regular place in the first team in 1981–82, scoring 15 tries in his first full season. In the following season, he reached the semi-final of the 1983 Challenge Cup against Featherstone Rovers. Although Bradford ultimately lost the match, Hanley scored a memorable try which was selected as the try of the season in the BBC&#x27;s Top Try competition.

In 1984–85, his last season with the club, Hanley became the first man to score more than 50 tries in a season since Alf Ellaby, and the first non-winger to reach this figure for 70 years. He scored a remarkable 55 tries in only 37 appearances, an achievement made even more remarkable as he switched between the positions of wing, centre and stand-off. For his achievements in the 1984–85 season, he was awarded the Man of Steel award, which is awarded to the player judged to have made the biggest impact in the season, as well as the First Division Player of the Year.

In total, Hanley made 126 appearances for the club, scoring 89 tries.

===Wigan===
In 1985 he signed for Wigan for a fee of £150,000, with Steve Donlan and Phil Ford moving to Bradford Northern in exchange for Hanley as part of the deal. Hanley finished his first season for the club with 35 tries.

During his second season at Wigan he scored 63 tries playing at centre, stand-off and loose forward, an all-time record for a non-winger. In the 1987 season, Hanley was awarded the Man of Steel award, being voted the player who made the biggest impact during the season. His play that year helped Wigan to their first league title in 27 years. He played in Wigan&#x27;s 1987 World Club Challenge victory against the visiting Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles.
Hanley holds the record for the most tries in a Regal Trophy (or precursors) Final with 3 tries.

In 1988, Hanley was in dispute with Wigan and was stripped of the captaincy. He was transfer listed at a then record £350,000. But when Wigan reached the semi-final of the 1988 Rugby League Challenge Cup against Salford, coach Graham Lowe recalled Hanley to the team. Upon his return Hanley scored a magnificent try in the final at Wembley Stadium. Ironically it was set up by Joe Lydon – reminiscent of the two tries he scored against Wigan four years earlier. Ray French stated it was the second greatest ever seen in a final.

In 1989, Hanley helped the club reach the Challenge Cup Final, where they won a 27–0 victory over St Helens in front of a crowd of approximately 78,000 people at Wembley, the first time in Cup Final history at Wembley that a side had been held scoreless. He was awarded the Lance Todd Trophy for the man of the match. For his performances throughout the season he was also awarded the Man of Steel award for the second time as a Wigan player, and the third time in his overall career. 1989 was also the year in which Hanley was awarded the Adidas Golden Boot, which was awarded to the world&#x27;s most outstanding player. Hanley remembers that &quot;It was something I always strove for. I wanted to be the best player in the world… Looking back, to be the world&#x27;s best player at that time was the biggest honour of my career.&quot;

He led Wigan to another two League and Cup doubles. By 1991 though his relationship with the media reached an all-time low. Although both Wigan and Great Britain captain, he was not expected to carry out any media role.

In total he spent around five years with the club, making 202 appearances and scoring 189 tries. In his Wigan career, he won a World Club Championship, 4 Challenge Cup winners medals, 3 Championships, 1 Premiership, 4 John Player Trophy Winners medals and 4 Lancashire Cup winners medals. He was also voted Man of Steel twice as a Wigan player. Hanley was inducted into the Wigan Hall of Fame in 2007.

===Balmain (1988)===
Hanley, the Great Britain captain, was signed by Sydney club Balmain Tigers to play the remaining rounds of the 1988 NSWRFL season for them once his representative commitments were fulfilled. In his first season with the club he helped them to the Grand Final in 1988 against Canterbury by defeating Penrith, Manly, Canberra as well as Cronulla in the preliminary finals. The preliminary final against Cronulla was a closely fought battle, until Hanley went to set up the try that would seal the victory for Balmain as they edged out their opponents 9–2, the win sending the club to their first Grand Final since 1969.

The first half of the Grand Final was a tight contest as Balmain led 6–4 scoring due to a mistake from Canterbury Jason Alchin. In the 26th minute, Hanley was wrapped up low by Andrew Farrar, and as he want to offload the ball, Terry Lamb hit Hanley with a high tackle that went unnoticed by the referee. He hit the ground in an awkward position and was concussed. He played no further part in the match, and his side went on to lose the game 24–12. Lamb said he was only looking to wrap the ball up and there was no intention. Lamb commented in his 1992 book that Balmain had key players such as Wayne Pearce, Ben Elias, Paul Sironen and Garry Jack that there was no chance to target one individual.

Speaking to &quot;Inside Sport Magazine&quot; in August 2005, Hanley was asked:

What do you remember about that infamous tackle by Terry Lamb?
&quot;I don&#x27;t know if it was caused by Terry Lamb, or if it was just my head hitting the ground. I couldn&#x27;t tell you because I have never looked at it since. Some people have said Terry got a good shot on me. I suspect, however, it was more a case of my head hitting the ground. I like to think it was accidental. Afterwards, I was concussed and didn&#x27;t know where I was. I didn&#x27;t regain all my faculties immediately so, from a safety point of view, I had to come off the football field. It was a shame, but it is a physical game and sometimes things like that happen.&quot;
Have you spoken to Lamb since then?
&quot;No, I never have. I have never bumped into him. I have to say I respect him as a footballer. I don&#x27;t know him as a person, but by all accounts he is a good guy. Let me be clear that I have no malice towards him, none at all, regardless of the incident being deliberate or accidental.&quot;

The New South Wales Rugby League, despite the media pressure, backed up Lamb&#x27;s version of events and deemed he had no case to answer.

===Western Suburbs===
In 1989, Hanley moved from Balmain to Western Suburbs. He played a total of thirteen games, scoring four tries for a total of sixteen points in his one and only season for the club. 1989 was also the year in which Hanley was awarded the Adidas Rugby League World Golden Boot Award, which was awarded to the world&#x27;s most outstanding player.

===Leeds===

In September 1991 at the age of 30, he joined Leeds as a player and coach for £250,000, and on his arrival at the club, was immediately appointed captain.

The 1993–94 season saw Hanley play in the Challenge Cup Final for the first time with Leeds. In the previous game, the Challenge Cup semi-final, Leeds faced St Helens at Central Park. Hanley scored two tries to put the club back on the big stage for the first time in sixteen years. In the Final, the club&#x27;s opponents were Hanley&#x27;s former club Wigan. In front of an official attendance at Wembley of 78,348, Leeds were defeated 16–26 by Wigan.

In the 1994–95 season, Hanley set a new world record for a forward, scoring 41 tries in a season. During that season, Hanley helped the club reach the Challenge Cup Final at Wembley for the second consecutive year. Ironically it was the same opponent that they faced a year earlier in the same competition final. In front of an attendance of 78,550 they were defeated, just as they had been a year earlier by their opponents, this time going down 30–10.

===Balmain (1996–97)===
In 1996 and well past his prime, Hanley returned to the Australian club Balmain for his second spell with the club. Hanley stated that &quot;I wanted to be respected by the Australians as well, because their game is so superior to ours.&quot;

==Representative career==
Hanley won caps for England while at Bradford Northern in 1984 against Wales, while at Leeds in 1992 against Wales.

He made his Great Britain début as a substitute, whilst still a Bradford Northern player, in January 1984 against France in Avignon. He was selected for the 1984 Great Britain Lions tour to Australia and was one of the stars of the 1984 Ashes series, scoring a remarkable twelve tries playing mostly on the wing.

Hanley was then selected as captain for the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour. The Lions defeated Papua New Guinea but lost The Ashes to Australia, losing the first two Tests in Sydney and Brisbane. The Third Test was a triumph for Hanley and his Lions though as they defeated Australia for the first time in a Test match since 1978, ending Australia&#x27;s streak of 15 straight wins over Great Britain. The Lions then defeated New Zealand 12–10 in Christchurch for their only test in NZ to finish the tour on a high note. Hanley scored eight tries in total on the tour.

Internationally, 1990 was a disappointment. Hanley captained Great Britain against the 1990 Kangaroos, and although they pulled off a shock 19–12 win over Australia in the first test at Wembley with Hanley playing a prominent role, the Kangaroos would come back to win the second and third tests to extend their Ashes series streak over the Lions which dated back to 1973.

Hanley also toured Australia in 1992 for the Ashes series, but despite being captain of the squad, on the field he made only one appearance and played less than fifteen minutes in a minor tour match against Newcastle. He played in Great Britain&#x27;s defeat by Australia in the 1992 Rugby League World Cup final at Wembley.

Hanley retired from international rugby in 1993. In total, he was capped 36 times by Great Britain.

==Coaching career==
In 1994, following Mal Reilly&#x27;s decision to step down as both Great Britain and Halifax coach to become coach of Australian club the Newcastle Knights, Hanley was appointed coach of the Great Britain Lions during the Ashes series against Australia during the 1994 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France. His appointment meant he had become the first black person to coach or manage a major national team in Great Britain. After a 12-man Lions team pulled off a gutsy 8–4 win in the first test at Wembley (following the first half send-off of captain Shaun Edwards for a high tackle), they lost the series when Australia won the second test 34–8 at Old Trafford, and 23–4 at Elland Road in Leeds.

The 1994 Ashes series would prove to be Hanley&#x27;s only time as Great Britain coach. For the 1995 Rugby League World Cup held in England and Wales, Great Britain was not playing, with England and Wales competing instead. Also, Hanley had signed with the Australian Rugby League during the Super League war which began in 1995 while the RFL were aligned with the Super League.

In 1999, he was appointed as the coach of St. Helens as the successor to Shaun McRae. In his first season as coach, he led St. Helens to the 1999 Super League Grand Final. His side defeated the Bradford Bulls, the club he began his professional playing career at, by 8–6 in October of that year. Whilst he harboured a strong desire to win, he could appear aloof and had several acrimonious disagreements with the St. Helens board of directors, which led to his suspension and eventual sacking as the manager of St Helens in 2000. Ian Millward was appointed as his successor.

He switched to rugby union coaching and took up posts with Bristol Rugby, and in the England national set-up. He also got involved in the sport of squash before returning to rugby league as a coaching consultant with Castleford Tigers in 2004. He worked with Cas for just two months before leaving.

On 14 December 2007 Hanley was unveiled as the coach of National League Two Club Doncaster. He resigned from that role on 28 September 2008, following Doncaster&#x27;s successful promotion play-off campaign.

In a return to coaching after a 14-year gap, Hanley was named, in March 2022 as head coach of the Combined Nations All Stars for their 2022 match against England.

==Recognition==
In January 1990 he was honoured with an MBE by the Queen for his services to rugby league. In October 2005, he was inducted into the Rugby Football League Hall of Fame. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest players in rugby league history.

==Outside rugby league==
Whilst playing for Wigan, Hanley had a try out in the World League of American football with the London Monarchs in March 1991. It was reported that Hanley would play for the team, but this never materialised.

In 2009, Hanley was one of thirteen celebrities taking part in &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, partnered with Frankie Poultney. He was the sixth person to be eliminated from the show.

<text>Georgetown Day School (GDS) is an independent coeducational PK-12 school located in Washington, D.C. The school educates 1,075 elementary, middle, and high school students in northwestern Washington, D.C. Russell Shaw is the current Head of School.

Founded in 1945 by anthropologists Philleo and Edith R. Nash, as Washington&#x27;s first racially integrated school, it is known for its progressive climate and dedication to social justice. Students call teachers by their first names, and the high school allows students to leave the campus during school hours.

==Academics==

The school has educated the children of several high-ranking government officials, including Justice Thurgood Marshall, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, United States Attorney General Eric Holder, United States Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen, United States Deputy Secretary of Education Jim Shelton III, Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Texas Senator Phil Gramm, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, Florida Congressman Kendrick Meek, Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin, Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, as well as Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.

Georgetown Day recently finished construction on the new lower and middle school campus (2021), thereby unifying the high school and lower/middle school campuses. Both are now located in Tenleytown. The project raised over fifty-two million dollars from more than 2,000 donors, surpassing the fifty-million dollar fundraising goal.

Each year the school sponsors the Ben Cooper Lecture in memory of a student killed in a car accident in 1997.

<text>HMAS &quot;Canberra&quot; (I33/D33), named after the Australian capital city of Canberra, was a Royal Australian Navy (RAN) heavy cruiser of the &quot;Kent&quot; sub-class of s. Constructed in Scotland during the mid-1920s, the ship was commissioned in 1928, and spent the first part of her career primarily operating in Australian waters, with some deployments to the China Station.

At the start of World War II, &quot;Canberra&quot; was initially used for patrols and convoy escort around Australia. In July 1940, she was reassigned as a convoy escort between Western Australia, Sri Lanka, and South Africa. During this deployment, which ended in mid-1941, &quot;Canberra&quot; was involved in the hunt for several German auxiliary cruisers. The cruiser resumed operations in Australian waters, but when Japan entered the war, she was quickly reassigned to convoy duties around New Guinea, interspersed with operations in Malaysian and Javanese waters. &quot;Canberra&quot; later joined Task Force 44, and was involved in the Guadalcanal Campaign and the Tulagi landings.

On 9 August 1942, &quot;Canberra&quot; was struck by the opening Japanese shots of the Battle of Savo Island, and was quickly crippled, and according to the crew, she was torpedoed by friendly fire. Unable to propel herself, listing heavily and burning, the cruiser was evacuated and then sunk in Ironbottom Sound by two American destroyers. The United States Navy cruiser was named in honour of the Australian ship. Later, in 2023, the US Navy named the new littoral combat ship after &quot;Canberra&quot;, which became the first US warship commissioned in a foreign port.

==Design==
&quot;Canberra&quot; was one of seven &quot;Kent&quot;-class cruisers—a subclass of the —designed by Eustace Tennyson-D&#x27;Eyncourt. The ship was long between perpendiculars and overall, with a beam of , and a maximum draught of . She displaced 9,850 tons at light load, and 10,000 tons at standard load. The &quot;Kent&quot; class were built to meet the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty; with a reduction in armament and protection. &quot;Canberra&quot; was powered by eight Yarrow boilers which fed steam to four Brown-Curtis geared turbines; these in turn provided to the ship&#x27;s four propeller shafts. The cruiser could reach speeds of , which could be maintained for , although could be travelled at the more economical standard cruising speed. Before World War II, the ship&#x27;s company was normally 690 (49 officers, 641 sailors); this increased to 710 when acting as a flagship. During wartime service, the normal company expanded to 751 (61 officers, 690 sailors), and at the time of her loss, 819 people were aboard.
&quot;Canberra&quot;″s main armament consisted of eight 8-inch Mark VIII guns in four twin turrets. Secondary armament consisted of four 4-inch quick-firing high-angle guns and four 2-pounder &quot;pom-pom&quot; guns. A mixture of .303-inch machine guns were carried for close defence work: initially this consisted of four Vickers machine guns and twelve Lewis machine guns, although four Lewis guns were later removed. During a refit in 1942, two multiple pom-poms and five 20 mm Oerlikons were added to enhance the anti-aircraft armament. Four 3-pounder quick-firing Hotchkiss guns were used as saluting guns. Two sets of quadruple 21-inch torpedo tubes were fitted. Depth charges were carried: these were deployed by rails.

The cruiser was designed to carry a single amphibious aircraft: initially a Supermarine Seagull III aircraft, but this was replaced in 1936 by the Supermarine Walrus. However, the aircraft catapult was not installed until April 1936, during a refit in Sydney. Before this, the Seagull amphibian was lowered into the water by the ship&#x27;s recovery crane and took off from there. Armour aboard &quot;Canberra&quot; was limited to an armour deck over the machinery spaces and magazines, ranging from in thickness. Armour plate was also fitted to the turrets (up to thick) and the conning tower ( thick). Anti-torpedo bulges were also fitted.

In 1924, the Australian government ordered two &quot;Kent&quot;-class cruisers to replace the ageing light cruisers and . These ships were to be named and &quot;Canberra&quot;, with both to be built by John Brown &amp; Company, at their shipyard at Clydebank, Scotland: the only two County-class ships built in Scotland. &quot;Canberra&quot; was laid down on 9 September 1925, and given the yard number 513. &quot;Canberra&quot; was launched on 31 May 1927 by Princess Mary; the first ship of the RAN launched by a member of the Royal Family. Work on the ship was completed on 10 July 1928, the day after the cruiser was commissioned into the RAN. Most of the initial ship&#x27;s company came from &quot;Sydney&quot;. &quot;Canberra&quot; cost approximately A£2 million to construct.

==Operational history==

===Pre-war===
&quot;Canberra&quot; left Portsmouth on 4 December 1928, after several months of workup trials, and arrived at Sydney on 16 February 1929. The cruiser operated primarily in Australian waters during the next ten years, spending periods of time as the RAN flagship. On 20 September 1929, during a round-Australia cruise, the ship grounded on a sand shoal outside Roebuck Bay, Western Australia. The damage did not prevent the ship from operating, and it was not until early 1930 that the affected hull plates were replaced. In September 1931, &quot;Canberra&quot; visited New Caledonia and Fiji. The cruiser operated on the Royal Navy&#x27;s China Station in 1932 and 1937. In 1934 the ship was assigned to escort , which was transporting the Duke of Gloucester during a visit to Australia. In August 1936 she brought Admiral Sir Murray Anderson to Sydney, Australia to be invested as Governor of New South Wales.

===World War II===
For the first nine months of World War II, &quot;Canberra&quot; was assigned to patrol and escort duties around Australia. In January 1940, the cruiser escorted the first convoy carrying Australian and New Zealand soldiers, Anzac Convoy US 1, to the Middle East. During May, &quot;Canberra&quot; joined sister ship &quot;Australia&quot; to escort Anzac Convoy US 3 across the Indian Ocean; the convoy was diverted via the Cape of Good Hope following fears that Italy was about to join the war. On 26 June, &quot;Canberra&quot; left Australia with the troopship &quot;Strathmore&quot; for Cape Town, where the cruiser was assigned to the Indian Ocean as a convoy escort between Fremantle, Colombo, and Cape Town. During November, &quot;Canberra&quot; attempted to locate the German merchant raider &quot;Atlantis&quot;. She returned unsuccessful to Fremantle on 20 November, but sailed that night with a skeleton crew after the merchant ship SS &quot;Maimoa&quot; signalled that she was under attack by a German merchant raider (the auxiliary cruiser &quot;Pinguin&quot;). Although unable to find &quot;Maimoa&quot; or her attacker, &quot;Canberra&quot; encountered three lifeboats on 22 November, which carried 27 sailors who had escaped from SS &quot;Port Brisbane&quot;, another victim of &quot;Pinguin&quot;. The cruiser returned to Fremantle on 27 November without encountering the German raider. Shortly after, &quot;Canberra&quot; headed for the East Indies Station.

In February 1941, &quot;Canberra&quot; was involved in efforts to locate the German pocket battleship &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot;. In early March, &quot;Canberra&quot; encountered two merchant ships; a tanker supplying a possible merchant raider, which split up and fled when ordered to stop. &quot;Canberra&quot; pursued the suspected raider, and fired on her from maximum range to avoid a retaliatory attack, while her Walrus amphibian attempted to stop the tanker by dropping several bombs. Both ships (the raider supply ship &quot;Coburg&quot; and the captured Norwegian tanker &quot;Ketty Brøvig&quot;) had commenced scuttling after the first attack from their pursuit, but the Australians continued attacking: the Walrus used all her bombs, while &quot;Canberra&quot; fired 215 shells, many of them misses. A post-action analysis found that if &quot;Canberra&quot; had closed before firing, the same quantity of damage could have been achieved for less ammunition, and one or both ships might have been captured.

&quot;Canberra&quot; was assigned back to Australia in July; operating around the western and southern coasts. The cruiser was in Sydney in December 1941, when Japan entered the war: &quot;Canberra&quot; was quickly reassigned to convoy duties around New Guinea, interspersed by operations in Malaysian and Javanese waters. On 12 December 1941, the cruiser was ordered from Sydney to meet the Pensacola Convoy, hoisting the flag of Rear-Admiral John G. Crace as she stopped in Brisbane on 15 December. In company with HMAS &quot;Perth&quot; she sailed for the vicinity of New Caledonia to meet the light cruiser and the convoy.

In January 1942, &quot;Canberra&quot; and escorted the troopship &quot;Aquitania&quot;, leaving Sydney 10 January, carrying reinforcements to Singapore as far as Ratai Bay, Sunda Strait where the reinforcements were transshipped into seven smaller vessels for the final run to Singapore. She was then part of the escort for that convoy, &quot;MS.2A&quot; of six Dutch KPM vessels and one British vessel, to Singapore arriving 24 January. During her return voyage via the Dutch East Indies, the cruiser was assigned to the ANZAC Squadron. A refit occurred in Sydney from February to May 1942, during which &quot;Canberra&quot; became the first Australian warship to be fitted with radar (a Type 241 surface search set, and an A290 air-warning set). The cruiser was present in Sydney Harbour during the Japanese midget submarine attack on 31 May-1 June. Although not damaged, at 04:40, &quot;Canberra&quot; recorded that the Japanese may have fired torpedoes at her. This may have been one of many false alarms throughout the night; however, one of the midget submarines had attempted to fire its torpedoes at a target, but these did not release because of damage sustained during the infiltration. The observer aboard &quot;Canberra&quot; may have seen bubbles from the compressed air released to fire the torpedoes.
The cruiser headed north the day after the submarine attack to join the ANZAC Squadron, which had been redesignated Task Force 44. On 17 June, &quot;Canberra&quot; took part in offensive patrols through the Coral Sea, and from July, she was assigned to Operation Watchtower; the opening stages of the Guadalcanal Campaign. The cruiser escorted the force to be landed at Tulagi from 5 August, and screened the force during the landings on 7 and 8 August; the cruiser encountered no initial resistance.

==Loss==

During the afternoon of 8 August, a Japanese task force commanded by Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa and consisting of five cruisers and a destroyer began to approach the south of Savo Island, with the intention to attack the naval force supporting the landing at Guadalcanal, then those at Tulagi. Anticipating a naval attack following several assaults by land-based Japanese aircraft, the Allied commander of the naval forces, Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley, split his forces around Savo Island: Crutchley aboard HMAS &quot;Australia&quot; led &quot;Canberra&quot;, , and the destroyers and on patrol of the southern waters. At 20:45, Crutchley was recalled to meet urgently with US Admiral Richmond K. Turner, overall commander of the amphibious landings. Although &quot;Chicago&quot; was the senior ship after &quot;Australia&quot; departed, &quot;Canberra&quot;, which had been following &quot;Australia&quot;, found herself at point. Around 01:00 on 9 August, the engines of scout planes from Mikawa&#x27;s ships were heard, but as no warning came from the other groups, it was assumed they were friendly.
At 01:45, &quot;Patterson&quot; detected Mikawa&#x27;s ships and alerted the Allied force. The Japanese scout planes dropped flares to silhouette &quot;Canberra&quot; and &quot;Chicago&quot;. The Australian cruiser was able to avoid the Japanese torpedoes fired at the start of the engagement but was on the receiving end of the Japanese cruisers&#x27; gunfire. The first two salvos killed or wounded several senior officers, disabled both engine rooms, damaged the bridge and 4-inch gun platform and forced the flooding of her magazines. Within two minutes, the cruiser had been hit 24 times; she was immobilised, without power, and listing to starboard, with multiple internal fires and at least a fifth of her personnel dead or wounded. At least one torpedo strike was reported during the Japanese attack, although none of the 19 torpedoes fired at &quot;Canberra&quot; by the Japanese cruisers were recorded as hitting their target. Several personnel from &quot;Canberra&quot; believe that USS &quot;Bagley&quot; inadvertently torpedoed the cruiser. From the 819-strong ship&#x27;s company, 84 were killed (74 during the battle, 10 dying later from wounds), and another 109 were wounded.
At 03:30, &quot;Patterson&quot; came alongside and relayed orders from Rear Admiral Turner: if &quot;Canberra&quot; could not achieve mobility by 06:30, she would be abandoned and sunk. The destroyer began to recover the Australian survivors, but at 04:30, &quot;Patterson&quot; detected an approaching ship. The destroyer moved to investigate, at which point the unknown ship opened fire, and &quot;Patterson&quot; retaliated. It was quickly realised that the attacker was USS &quot;Chicago&quot;, which had mistaken &quot;Canberra&quot; for a damaged Japanese vessel, and both ships ceased fire. &quot;Patterson&quot; returned to continue the evacuation, and was aided by sister ship .

While still afloat, and in no apparent danger of sinking, damage control and repair options were being evaluated. It was determined that &quot;Canberra&quot;″s engines could not be repaired by the 0630 deadline, and she was to be scuttled, instead of being towed over to Tulagi harbor for emergency repairs. She was torpedoed by the destroyer at 08:00, after 263 shells and four other torpedoes fired by failed to do the job, and sank at coordinates . She was one of the first ships to be sunk in what was eventually named &quot;Ironbottom Sound&quot;. Three US cruisers were also destroyed during the battle and a US destroyer damaged.

==Aftermath==

Captain Howard Bode of USS &quot;Chicago&quot; was formally criticised for his actions during the battle, particularly for not taking lead when &quot;Australia&quot; departed, and for not warning the northern cruiser force of the approaching Japanese ships. In recognition of the valour displayed by the Australian ship and her company, United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt wished to commemorate the loss of HMAS &quot;Canberra&quot; by naming a US ship in her honour. The under-construction &quot;Baltimore&quot;-class cruiser &quot;Pittsburgh&quot; was selected to be renamed . The ship was launched on 19 April 1943 by (Alice,) Lady Dixon, the wife of Sir Owen Dixon, Australia&#x27;s ambassador to the United States, and is the only United States warship to be named after a foreign capital city. Later, in 2023, the US Navy named a new Independence-class littoral combat ship also after the Canberra, which became the first US warship commissioned in a foreign port. 

Around the same time, the British government announced that the heavy cruiser (a sister ship to &quot;Canberra&quot;, but of the &quot;London&quot; subclass) would be transferred to the RAN as a gift. Although King George VI had announced that the ship would be renamed &quot;Canberra&quot;, the duplication of ship names with the United States Navy was against RAN policy. Although it was thought that Australia had a greater claim to the name, the Australian government decided to retain &quot;Shropshire&quot;″s old name after learning that the US offer had come directly from President Roosevelt. Many of the first Australian sailors posted to &quot;Shropshire&quot; in early 1943 were &quot;Canberra&quot; survivors.

&quot;Canberra&quot;″s wartime service was recognised with four battle honours: &quot;East Indies 1940–41&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1941–42&quot;, &quot;Guadalcanal 1942&quot;, and &quot;Savo Island 1942&quot;.
===Rediscovery===

&quot;Canberra&quot;″s wreck was rediscovered and examined by Robert Ballard and his crew in July and August 1992, almost exactly fifty years after her scuttling. She lies upright on the ocean floor, approximately below sea level, and while her hull was basically intact, she shows visible signs of shell hits and fire damage amidships. Just as they had been during the Battle of Savo Island, &quot;Canberra&quot;″s &quot;B&quot;, &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; turrets were trained to port, while &quot;A&quot; turret was trained on the port bow. When the ship was rediscovered in 1992, the forward superstructure had collapsed over to the starboard side; the roof of &quot;B&quot; turret was missing.

===Memorials===
HMAS &quot;Canberra&quot; is remembered in various places. In her name city of Canberra, a memorial is located next to Lake Burley Griffin, adjacent to the National Carillon. It incorporates a naval anchor and a section of chain cable (of the same type carried by &quot;Canberra&quot;), and it has two plaques detailing the purpose of the memorial and the details of the cruiser. The memorial was erected by the Australian Capital Territory Branch of the Naval Historical Society, with donations from the ex-HMAS &quot;Canberra&quot; and &quot;Canberra-Shropshire&quot; Association members, and was unveiled on 9 August 1981 by Admiral Sir Anthony Synnot. A commemorative address was given at the unveiling by Admiral Sir Victor Smith, who was aboard &quot;Canberra&quot; at the time of her loss. Each year on the Saturday closest 9 August, a service is conducted at the memorial, which is attended by the Australian Chief of Navy, the defence attachés from the United States and the United Kingdom, and personnel from the naval base . A catafalque party was originally provided by personnel from the frigate until the ship&#x27;s 2005 decommissioning; after this, the catafalque party was supplied by the Australian Navy Cadets unit TS &quot;Canberra&quot;.
Another memorial is located at the Police Memorial Park in Rove, Honiara, Solomon Islands. The memorial is shaped like the bow of a ship, and points toward Savo Island. A previous memorial to the ship, which had been located in the grounds of the Vilu Military Museum, was destroyed in 2000 during &quot;the Tensions&quot;. A memorial plaque is also dedicated to HMAS &quot;Canberra&quot; and her Tasmanian RAN personnel at the Tasmanian Seafarers&#x27; Memorial at Triabunna on the east coast of Tasmania.

The ship&#x27;s service is also recognised in a stained glass window at the Garden Island Naval Chapel.

<text>Edwin (Ted) Essery Swales VC DFC (3 July 1915 – 23 February 1945) was a South African pilot and Second World War hero. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and posthumously the Victoria Cross.

==Early life and career==
Edwin Essery Swales was one of four children born in Inanda, Natal, South Africa to Harry Evelyn Swales, who was a farmer in the Heatonville district, and Olive Miriam Essery. Following the death of her husband in the influenza epidemic of 1918-19, Mrs Swales and her children moved to the Berea, Durban. Here, Edwin Swales attended Durban Preparatory High School and Durban High School (DHS). As a young lad, Edwin had also been a Boy Scout, at the 4th Durban Scout Troop. After leaving school, and prior to the Second World War, Edwin Swales worked for Barclays Bank (Dominion Colonial and Overseas - DCO) in Durban. Swales had joined the Natal Mounted Rifles in 1935, rising to the rank of sergeant major, (officially, a warrant officer, 2nd class). With the N.M.R., in the early part of the War, he saw action in Kenya, Abyssinia and in North Africa. He then transferred to the South African Air Force on 17 January 1942.

Swales was also very keen on sport generally, and enjoyed rugby. He played for both civilian (pre-war) and various military teams. After playing for the DHS 2nd XV, he later played rugby for a number of South African and Dominion teams, whilst he was in the United Kingdom, during the War years. He played for Griquas when he had been posted to Kimberley for training. He was also a reserve for the Natal rugby team, without ever actually playing for the province. He received his wings at Kimberley on 26 June 1943. On 22 August 1943, he was seconded to the Royal Air Force (RAF) while retaining his South African Air Force uniform and rank.

==Second World War==
Following successful period of training on heavy bombers, Swales was posted, in June 1944, to the elite RAF Pathfinder Force (with 582 Squadron), part of No. 8 Pathfinder Group, at Little Staughton, in Huntingdonshire. It was normal for the Pathfinders to accept only experienced pilots who had completed a full tour on bombers. Although Swales had never spent any time as a bomber pilot in a standard heavy bomber squadron, Swales went straight into the squadron.

Swales&#x27; first operational flight for 582 Squadron was on 12 July 1944. Newly promoted to captain on 4 November 1944, he took part in a daring daylight bombing raid on 23 December, on the Gremberg railway yards, Cologne, Germany. The Squadron Leader for the raid on Cologne was his close friend, Robert Palmer, who normally flew Mosquitos with 109 Squadron, also based at Little Staughton. Swales was the number two Pathfinder, leading the main flight and following Palmer as he marked the target. Palmer, who had completed 110 bombing raids, was killed as his Lancaster, despite being damaged by flak and with two engines on fire, crashed after completing its bombing run. Palmer was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross – becoming the 2nd Pathfinder pilot to be so honoured. Six of the 30 aircraft on this operation were lost.

For his actions on the Cologne raid, Edwin Swales was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. The citation reads:

==Victoria Cross==
In 1945, while with the RAF Pathfinders (No. 582 Squadron), Swales was the Master Bomber and captain of Avro Lancaster III PB538. On 23 February 1945, the very day as his D.F.C. award was gazetted, Swales led the bombing raid on Pforzheim, Germany (not far from Karlsruhe and the Rhine River), where 17,600 civilians were killed.

The &#x27;sortie&#x27;, his 43rd operational flight, consisted of 367 Lancasters supported by 13 Mosquitos. The marking and bombing, from a relatively low 8,000 feet (2440m), were accurate and severe damage was inflicted on Pforzheim: 1,825 tons (1854 tonnes) of bombs were dropped in 22 minutes. The post-war British Bombing Survey Unit estimated that 83% of the town&#x27;s built-up area was destroyed, probably the greatest proportion of a city destroyed in any one raid during the war. Ten Lancasters were lost and two more crashed in France.

Swales&#x27; aircraft was attacked by an Bf 110 whose fire shattered one engine and holed the fuel tanks. They were attacked again by the same fighter which knocked out a second engine. Swales decided to try and make it to friendly territory. The weather closed in and he ordered the crew to bail out. He attempted to put his Lancaster down but it stalled and crashed near Valenciennes, west of Prouvy, 3 km SSE of Denain in northern France killing him. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross – the 3rd and last Pathfinder pilot to be so honoured. All had been posthumous.

===Citation===
Swales&#x27; VC citation reads:
==Legacy==
Originally buried at Fosse&#x27;s USA Cemetery, his remains now lie at the War Cemetery at Leopoldsburg, near Limburg, Belgium, Plot No.8, Row C, Grave No.5.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur &#x27;Bomber&#x27; Harris, KCB, OBE, AFC, of RAF Bomber Command, wrote a letter to Swales&#x27; mother, saying, inter-alia: 

Although often referred to as being a &quot;captain&quot; at the time of his last flight (because of being the commander of the aircraft), Swales was in military rank an &#x27;acting&#x27; major. The S.A.A.F. was using the army ranking system, hence the ranks of &#x27;captain&#x27; and of &#x27;major&#x27;. At the time of his death on 23 February 1945, Swales was aged 29 years. In 1958, the British Air Ministry wrote to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission informing them that the South African Air Force authorities had confirmed that at the time of his death, Swales had in fact held the rank of major. The front page of the program for the opening of the S.A.A.F. Memorial in Pretoria on 31 May 1950, described Mrs. Olive Swales (who opened the Memorial) as being the &quot;mother of the Late Major Edwin Swales, DFC, VC&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==
Swales was the only S.A.A.F. pilot during 1939–45 to be appointed a pathfinder master bomber and also to have been posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. The full list of the medals awarded to Swales follows:
*The Victoria Cross
*The Distinguished Flying Cross
*The 1939–1945 Star
*The Africa Star
*The France and Germany Star
*The Defence Medal, 1939–1945
*The 1939–1945 War Medal (Victory Medal)
*The Africa Service Medal

Swales&#x27; full-size war medals and some other possessions are held and displayed at the South African National Museum of Military History in Saxonwold, Johannesburg. At his old school, Durban High School (founded in 1866), a school &#x27;House&#x27; is named Swales House. The school also has a granite memorial in his memory. In the city of Durban, there was a major arterial road named &#x27;Edwin Swales VC Drive&#x27;. In terms of a controversial decision made by the eThekwini Municipality, Swales&#x27; name was expunged, and the road&#x27;s name changed to honour instead noted anti-apartheid figure Solomon Mahlangu.

The original set of miniature medals belonging to Swales, and a silver model Lancaster bomber, are now housed in an exhibition honouring Swales at his old school, Durban High School. Many years ago, the miniature medals and the model had been sold by a member of the Swales family. After changing hands a few times, the group came up for auction in London in July 2004, at which time the medals and model were sold to a UK collector. A medal collector and D.H.S. Old Boy tracked down the buyer and convinced him to sell his recent acquisitions to the school. After four months of negotiations, the medals and model were delivered to their new home at DHS, where they were first displayed on Armistice Day, 11 November 2004.

The silver model Lancaster was one of only ten such models which were commissioned by the aircraft&#x27;s manufacturers, Messrs A.V. Roe &amp; Co. and by Rolls-Royce (suppliers of the Lancaster engines) and presented to the ten Victoria Cross winners (or their families) who flew Lancasters in the Second World War. On the base stand of the model is a silver plaque inscribed: &quot;A Tribute from the Directors of A.V. Roe &amp; Company and Rolls-Royce Limited. To the Memory of Captain Edwin Swales,&quot; V.C., D.F.C., S.A.A.F., who was Awarded the Victoria Cross for his great Gallantry and Self-Sacrifice during Operations Against the Enemy on 23 February 1945&quot;.

<text>BMC Software, Inc. is an American multinational information technology (IT) services and consulting, and enterprise software company based in Houston, Texas.

== History ==
The company was founded in Houston, Texas, by former Shell employees Scott Boulette, John Moores, and Dan Cloer, whose surname initials were adopted as the company name BMC Software. Moores served as the company&#x27;s first CEO. The firm primarily wrote software for IBM mainframe computers, the industry standard at the time, but since the mid-1990s has been developing software to monitor, manage and automate both distributed and mainframe systems.

In 1987, Moores was succeeded by Richard A. Hosley II as CEO and President. In July 1988, BMC was re-incorporated in Delaware and went public with an initial public offering for BMC stock. The first day of trading was August 12, 1988. BMC stock was originally traded on the Nasdaq under the symbol BMCS and later on the New York Stock Exchange with symbol BMC.

=== Acquisition and privatization by private equity firms ===
In May 2013, BMC announced that it was being acquired by a group of major private equity investment groups for $6.9 billion. The process was completed in September 2013 and the company is no longer publicly traded.

It was announced on October 2, 2018 that BMC was acquired by KKR, a leading global investment firm. The company was acquired from a private investor group led by Bain Capital Private Equity and Golden Gate Capital together with GIC, Insight Venture Partners, and Elliott Management.

== Products and services ==

BMC Software specializes in software designed to enable an autonomous digital enterprise, developing products used for multiple functions including automation, service management, DevOps, workflow orchestration, AIOps, and security.

The company supports enterprises using mainframes with its Automated Mainframe Intelligence (AMI) product line, which enables self-managing mainframe systems. Self-managing mainframes use machine learning to improve efficiency by anticipating needs, sending alarms, and taking actions without the need for manual actions.

BMC&#x27;s Control-M software is an application workflow orchestration platform that allows businesses to run hundreds of thousands of batch jobs daily and use the data to optimize complex business operations, such as supply chain management. Users can access all enterprise batch jobs through a single graphical interface. Control-M integrates with distributed storage systems such as HDFS, YARN, MapReduce and Apache Spark. In 2019, the firm made the program available in a Docker container, allowing easy deployment to the public cloud or on-premises. The software has been named the overall leader in workload automation by Enterprise Management Associates in each report since 2010. In 2020, the firm announced the launch of SaaS-based BMC Helix Control-M application workflow orchestration.

The TrueSight suite utilizes AI and machine learning to provide insights and network automation capabilities, and includes TrueSight Operations Management, TrueSight Automation for Networks, TrueSight Automation for Servers, and TrueSight Orchestration.

== Directors and staff ==

The company was founded by John J. Moores in 1980. Richard A. Hosley II was president and chief executive officer of BMC Software, Inc. from October 1987 until April 1990. Shortly after becoming president, Hosley took the company public in 1988. Hosley was succeeded by Max Watson Jr. in April 1990. Max Watson Jr. was chairman and chief executive officer of BMC Software from April 1990 to January 2001.

In 2001, BMC appointed the company director, Garland Cupp, as chairman, succeeding Max Watson, who quit the post in January 2001. Watson was succeeded as chairman and CEO by BMC&#x27;s former senior vice president of product management and development, Robert Beauchamp.

In December 2016, Peter Leav succeeded Bob Beauchamp as president and chief executive officer. In October 2019, Ayman Sayed was named as President and CEO of BMC Software.

== Litigation ==
In 2022, BMC won a lawsuit against IBM for &quot;fraudulently inducing and then violating a software licensing agreement&quot;, and was awarded over $1.6 million in damages. This was then overturned by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, stating that &quot;a lower court judge&#x27;s determination concerning liability was in error.&quot; The three-judge panel, U.S. Circuit Judge Edith Jones said AT&amp;T, one of BMC&#x27;s biggest clients, had switched to IBM software &quot;independently&quot; and that BMC had &quot;lost out to IBM fair and square&quot;.

<text>The Olympus E-300 (Olympus Evolt E-300 in North America) is an 8-megapixel digital SLR manufactured by Olympus of Japan and based on the Four Thirds System. Announced at photokina 2004, it became available at the end of 2004. It was the second camera (after the Olympus E-1) to use the Four Thirds System, and the first intended for the consumer market.

==Features==
The camera&#x27;s appearance was unique, as it lacked the ubiquitous SLR pentaprism &quot;hump&quot;. Instead, a Porro prism system was used; it fitted sideways within the camera, with a sideways-swinging mirror, and located the viewfinder eyepiece to the left (seen from behind) relative to the lens centerline. The body was largely of ABS plastic over a metal frame; the lens mount was metal, and there was a metal covered area on the left top of the camera. This area also contained the onboard flash, which popped up and forward at the touch of a button. The onboard flash popup mechanism is manual. In low light scenarios the flash will not pop up automatically but the photographer must press the button and pop it up before taking the photo.

The E-300 uses Olympus&#x27; patented Supersonic Wave Filter dust reduction system to shake dust from the sensor during startup and when requested by the user; this largely eliminates the problem of dust accumulation on the surface of the image sensor.

The E-300 was replaced by the Olympus E-330, a similar model with live preview, in January 2006.

<doc id="1199034" wikidata="Q7167808" url="?curid=1199034" title="Peregrine Systems">
<text>Peregrine Systems, Inc. was an enterprise software company, founded in 1981, that sold enterprise asset management, change management, and ITIL-based IT service management software. Following an accounting scandal and bankruptcy in 2003, Peregrine was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2005. Micro Focus which merged with the HP Software Division in 2017, later marketed the Peregrine products as part of its IT Service Management solutions. Micro Focus was acquired by OpenText in 2023.

==History==
Peregrine Systems was founded in 1981 in Irvine, California. The founders and employees were Chris Cole, Gary Story, Ed Beck, Kevin Keyes and Richard Diederich. They started selling Peregrine Network Management System (PNMS) on a Series One computer while developing an MVS version. The MVS client/server solutions for PNMS became available in 1995.

In 1989, John Moores, founder of BMC Software and owner of the San Diego Padres Major League Baseball team, became a member of the Peregrine board of directors. He served as chairman from March 1990 through July 2000 and then again in 2002. He resigned from the board in 2003 during the company&#x27;s bankruptcy filing. His involvement in the software industry continues today with investments through his venture capital firm JMI Equity. The legacy of his investments has been focused on ITSM software packages with the most recent investments made in ServiceNow.

Peregrine had offices in the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific and grew its product line rapidly both organically and via acquisitions, including Harbinger Corporation in 2000, and Remedy Corporation in 2001.

==Fraud==
In 2004, a federal grand jury issued an indictment charging eight former executives of Peregrine Systems, Inc., one former outside auditor of Peregrine, and two outside business partners of Peregrine, with conspiracy to commit a multibillion-dollar securities fraud. The case resulted from an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Securities and Exchange Commission had pursued a parallel civil enforcement action.

In 2003, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Peregrine with &quot;massive financial fraud&quot; for the purposes of inflating the company&#x27;s revenue and stock price. Peregrine, without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, agreed to a partial settlement. 

Peregrine filed suit against its auditor Arthur Andersen in 2002 for $1 billion in damages, for allegedly allowing incorrect audits that overstated revenues by as much as $250 million to be filed for the 2000-2002 fiscal years. In 2003, the former Peregrine CFO, Matthew Gless, pleaded guilty to fraud charges. In 2008, the former Peregrine CEO, Stephen Gardner, was sentenced to eight years and one month in prison for his role in the fraud, which resulted in bankruptcy for the company. Although former chairman of the board, John Moores, sold more than $800 million of shares during Peregrine&#x27;s fraudulent period, the court of appeals determined that there was insufficient evidence that Moores knew about the fraud that led to the company&#x27;s bankruptcy.

*Dan Stulac (formerly led auditing team at Arthur Andersen)
*Eric Paul Deller (former Peregrine General Counsel)

==Bankruptcy==
Peregrine filed for Chapter 11 protection on September 23, 2002, after laying off 1400 employees, or nearly half its workforce. When Peregrine filed for federal bankruptcy protection and eventually canceled its common stocks, more than $4 billion in shareholder equity was lost. After filing, the company sold the Remedy division of the company to BMC Software for more than $300 million. Peregrine exited Chapter 11 reorganization in August 2003, and the president and CEO, Gary Greenfield, left the company. Retired software executive John Mutch became president and CEO in August 2003.

<doc id="1199037" wikidata="Q244764" url="?curid=1199037" title="Hasekura Tsunenaga">
<text>was a kirishitan Japanese samurai and retainer of Date Masamune, the daimyō of Sendai. He was of Japanese imperial descent with ancestral ties to Emperor Kanmu. Other names include Philip Francis Faxicura, Felipe Francisco Faxicura, and Philippus Franciscus Faxecura Rocuyemon in period European sources, as he took a baptismal name upon converting to Catholicism.

In the years 1613 through 1620, Hasekura headed the Keichō Embassy (), a diplomatic mission to Pope Paul V. He visited New Spain and various other ports-of-call in Europe on the way. On the return trip, Hasekura and his companions re-traced their route across New Spain in 1619, sailing from Acapulco for Manila, and then sailing north to Japan in 1620. 

Although Hasekura&#x27;s embassy was cordially received in Spain and Rome, it happened at a time when Japan was moving toward the suppression of Christianity. European monarchs refused the trade agreements Hasekura had been seeking. He returned to Japan in 1620 and died of illness a year later, his embassy seemingly ending with few results in an increasingly isolationist Japan.

Japan&#x27;s next embassy to Europe would not occur until more than 200 years later, following two centuries of isolation, with the &quot;First Japanese Embassy to Europe&quot; in 1862.

==Early life==

Hasekura Tsunenaga was born in year 2 of the Genki era (1571) in Ushū, Okitama-no-kōri, Nagai-sō, Tateishi-mura (now part of modern day Yonezawa in Yamagata Prefecture. He was the son of (), who had ancestral ties with Emperor Kanmu. He was a mid-level noble samurai in the Sendai Domain in northern Japan who had the opportunity to directly serve the daimyō, Date Masamune, and received an annual stipend of 1200 koku. He spent his young adulthood at Kamitate Castle () that was constructed by his grandfather Hasekura Tsunemasa (). The place of origin of the family name &quot;Hasekura&quot; was Hasekura Village (), now Hasekura Ward () in Kawasaki City.

Hasekura and Date Masamune were of roughly the same age, and it is recorded that several important missions were given to Tsunenaga as his representative. It is also recorded that Hasekura served as a samurai during the Japanese invasion of Korea under the Taikō Toyotomi Hideyoshi, for six months in 1597.

In 1612, Hasekura&#x27;s father, Hasekura Tsunenari (), was indicted for corruption, and he was put to death in 1613. His fief was confiscated, and his son should normally have been executed as well. Date, however, gave him the opportunity to redeem his honour by placing him in charge of the Embassy to Europe, and soon gave him back his territories as well.

==History of early contacts between Japan and Spain==
The Spanish started trans-Pacific voyages between New Spain (present-day Mexico and the U.S. state of California) and the Philippines in 1565. The famous Manila galleons carried silver from Mexican mines westward to the entrepôt of Manila in the Spanish possession of the Philippines. There, the silver was used to purchase spices and trade goods gathered from throughout Asia, including (until 1638) goods from Japan. The return route of the Manila galleons, first charted by the Spanish navigator Andrés de Urdaneta, took the ships northeast into the Kuroshio Current (also known as the Japan Current) off the coast of Japan, and then across the Pacific to the west coast of Mexico, landing eventually in Acapulco.

Spanish ships were occasionally shipwrecked on the coasts of Japan due to bad weather, initiating contacts with the country. The Spanish wished to expand the Christian faith in Japan. Efforts to expand influence in Japan were met by stiff resistance from the Jesuits, who had started the evangelizing of the country in 1549, as well as by the opposition of the Portuguese and Dutch who did not wish to see Spain participate in Japanese trade. However, some Japanese, such as Christopher and Cosmas, are known to have crossed the Pacific onboard Spanish galleons as early as 1587. It is known that gifts were exchanged between the governor of the Philippines and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who thanks him in a 1597 letter, writing &quot;The black elephant in particular I found most unusual.&quot;

On 25 July, 1609, the Manila galleons &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Santa Ana&quot;, and the flagship (&quot;almiranta&quot;) &quot;San Antonio&quot; set sail from Cavite, then a major Philippine shipyard during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, towards Acapulco. The ships ran into storms on 10 August around the Islas de los Ladrones (present-day Northern Mariana Islands); only the &quot;San Antonio&quot; managed to successfully reach Acapulco, while the &quot;Santa Ana&quot; was almost entirely destroyed and had to land at Bungo Province (present-day Ōita Prefecture). The &quot;San Francisco&quot; was severely damaged, losing its mast and leaking water, and later struck a reef nearby the hamlet Yubanda (likely present-day Iwawada, in Onjuku, Chiba). Fifty-six sailors drowned; the rest survived by clinging to floating wreckage. Upon getting to land, a few sailors found some locals from Yubanda at a nearby rice paddy field, who took the survivors to their hamlet. The captain of the &quot;San Francisco&quot;, Rodrigo de Vivero, was recognized as a former governor of the Philippines, and was granted an audience with the retired &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyasu. de Vivero drafted a treaty, signed on 29 November 1609, whereby the Spaniards could establish a factory in eastern Japan, mining specialists would be imported from New Spain, Spanish ships would be allowed to visit Japan in case of necessity, and a Japanese embassy would be sent to the Spanish court.

===First Japanese expeditions to the Americas===
====1610 &quot;San Buenaventura&quot;====
A Franciscan friar named Luis Sotelo, who was proselytizing in the area of what is now modern Tokyo, convinced Tokugawa Ieyasu and his son Tokugawa Hidetada to send him as a representative to New Spain (Mexico) on one of their ships, in order to advance the trade treaty. Rodrigo de Vivero offered to sail on the Japanese ship in order to guarantee the safety of their reception in New Spain, but insisted that another Franciscan, named Alonso Muños, be sent instead as the &quot;shōgun&quot; representative. In 1610, Rodrigo de Vivero, several Spanish sailors, the Franciscan father, and 22 Japanese representatives led by the trader Tanaka Shōsuke sailed to Mexico aboard the &quot;San Buenaventura&quot;, a ship built by the English navigator William Adams for the &quot;shōgun&quot;. Once in New Spain, Alonso Muños met with the Viceroy Luis de Velasco, who agreed to send an ambassador to Japan in the person of the famous explorer Sebastián Vizcaíno with the added mission of exploring the &quot;Gold and silver islands&quot; (&quot;&quot;) that were thought to be east of the Japanese isles.

Vizcaíno arrived in Japan in 1611 and had many meetings with the &quot;shōgun&quot; and feudal lords. These encounters were tainted by his poor respect for Japanese customs, the mounting resistance of the Japanese towards Catholic proselytism, and the intrigues of the Dutch against Spanish ambitions. Vizcaíno finally left to search for the &quot;Silver island&quot;, during the search he encountered bad weather which forced him to return to Japan as his ship suffered heavy damage.

====1612: &quot;San Sebastian&quot;====
Without waiting for Vizcaíno, another ship – built in Izu by the Tokugawa shogunate under the minister of the Navy Mukai Shōgen, and named &quot;San Sebastian&quot;&#x27;left for Mexico on 9 September 1612 with Luis Sotelo onboard as well as two representatives of Date Masamune, with the objective of advancing the trade agreement with New Spain. However, the ship foundered a few miles from Uraga, and the expedition had to be abandoned.

==The 1613 embassy project==
The shōgun had a new galleon built in Japan to bring Vizcaíno back to New Spain, together with a Japanese embassy accompanied by Luis Sotelo. The galleon, named &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot;, took 45 days to build, with the participation of technical experts from the Bakufu (the Minister of the Navy Mukai Shōgen, an acquaintance of William Adams with whom he built several ships, dispatched his chief carpenter), 800 shipwrights, 700 smiths, and 3,000 carpenters. The &quot;daimyō&quot; of Sendai, Date Masamune, was put in charge of the project. He named Hasekura to lead the mission:
:&quot;The Great Ship left Toshima-Tsukinoura for the Southern Barbarians on 15 September Japanese calendar, with at its head Hasekura Rokuemon Tsunenaga, and those called Imaizumi Sakan, Matsuki Shusaku, Nishi Kyusuke, Tanaka Taroemon, Naitō Hanjurō, Sonohoka Kyuemon, Kuranojō, Tonomo, Kitsunai, Kyuji, as well as several others under Rokuemon, as well as 40 Southern Barbarians, 10 men of Mukai Shōgen, and also tradespeople, to a total 180.&quot;

The objective of the Japanese embassy was both to discuss trade agreements with the Spanish crown in Madrid, and to meet with the Pope in Rome. Date Masamune displayed a great will to welcome the Catholic religion in his domain: he invited Sotelo and authorized the propagation of Christianity in 1611. In his letter to the Pope, brought by Hasekura, he wrote: &quot;I&#x27;ll offer my land for a base of your missionary work. Send us as many padres as possible.&quot;

Sotelo, in his own account of the travels, emphasizes the religious dimension of the mission, claiming that the main objective was to spread the Christian faith in northern Japan:

:&quot;I was formerly dispatched as ambassador of Idate Masamune, who holds the reins of the kingdom of Oxu [Japanese:] (which is in the Eastern part of Japan)who, while he has not yet been reborn through baptism, &quot;has&quot; been catechized, and was desirous that the Christian faith should be preached in his kingdomtogether with another noble of his Court, Philippus Franciscus Faxecura Rocuyemon, to the Roman Senate &amp; to the one who at that time was in charge of the Apostolic See, His Holiness Pope Paul V.&quot;

The embassy was probably, at that time, part of a plan to diversify and increase trade with foreign countries, before the participation of Christians in the Osaka rebellion triggered a radical reaction from the shogunate, with the interdiction of Christianity in the territories it directly controlled, in 1614.

==Trans-Pacific voyage==
Upon completion, the ship left on 28 October 1613 for Acapulco with around 180 people on board, including 10 samurai of the &quot;shōgun&quot; (provided by the Minister of the Navy Mukai Shōgen Tadakatsu), 12 samurai from Sendai, 120 Japanese merchants, sailors, and servants, and around 40 Spaniards and Portuguese, including Sebastián Vizcaíno who, in his own words, only had the quality of a passenger.

===New Spain (Acapulco)===
The ship sighted Cape Mendocino on 26 December 1613, continuing along the California coast and landing at Zacatula in Colima on 22 January 1614. The delegation arrived at Acapulco on 25 January, after three months at sea. The Japanese were received with great ceremony, but had to wait in Acapulco until orders were received regarding how to organize the rest of their travels.

Fights erupted between the Japanese and the Spaniards, especially Vizcaíno, apparently due to some disputes on the handling of presents from the Japanese ruler. A contemporary journal, written by the Nahuatl annalist Chimalpahin, relates Vizcaíno was seriously wounded in the fight:
:&quot;Señor Sebastián Vizcaíno is also still coming slowly, coming hurt; the Japanese injured him when they beat and stabbed him at Acapulco, as became known here in Mexico, because of all the things coming along that had been made his responsibility in Japan&quot;.

Following these fights, orders were promulgated on 4 and 5 March to bring peace back. The orders explained that &quot;the Japanese should not be submitted to attacks in this Land, but they should remit their weapons until their departure, except for Hasekura Tsunenaga and eight of his retinue ... The Japanese will be free to go where they want, and should be treated properly. They should not be abused in words or actions. They will be free to sell their goods. These orders have been promulgated to the Spanish, the Indians, the Mulattos, the Mestizos, and the Blacks, and those who don&#x27;t respect them will be punished&quot;.

===New Spain (Mexico)===
The embassy remained two months in Acapulco and entered Mexico City on 24 March, where it was received with great ceremony. The ultimate mission for the embassy was to go on to Europe. The embassy spent some time in Mexico, and then went to Veracruz to board the fleet of Don Antonio Oquendo.

Chimalpahin gives some account of the visit of Hasekura.

:&quot;This is the second time that the Japanese have landed one of their ships on the shore at Acapulco. They are transporting here all things of iron, and writing desks, and some cloth that they are to sell here.&quot;
:&quot;It became known here in Mexico and was said that the reason their ruler the Emperor of Japan sent this said lordly emissary and ambassador here, is to go in Rome to see the Holy Father Paul V, and to give him their obedience concerning the holy church, so that all the Japanese want to become Christians&quot;.

Hasekura was settled in a house next to the Convent of San Francisco, and met with the Viceroy. He explained to him that he was also planning to meet King Philip III to offer him peace and to obtain that the Japanese could come to Mexico for trade. On Wednesday 9 April 20 Japanese were baptized, and 22 more on 20 April by the archbishop in Mexico, don Juan Pérez de la Serna, at the Convent of San Francisco. Altogether 63 of them received confirmation on 25 April. Hasekura waited for his travel to Europe to be baptized there:

:&quot;But the lordly emissary, the ambassador, did not want to be baptized here; it was said that he will be baptized later in Spain&quot;.

====Departure for Europe====
Chimalpahin explains that Hasekura left some of his compatriots behind before leaving for Europe:

:&quot;The Ambassador of Japan set out and left for Spain. In going he divided his vassals; he took a certain number of Japanese, and he left an equal number here as merchants to trade and sell things.&quot;

The fleet left for Europe on the &quot;San Jose&quot; on 10 June. Hasekura had to leave the largest parts of the Japanese group behind, who were to wait in Acapulco for the return of the embassy.

Some of them, as well as those from the previous travel of Tanaka Shōsuke, returned to Japan the same year, sailing back with the &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot;:
:&quot;Today, Tuesday the 14th of the month of October of the year 1614, was when some Japanese set out from Mexico here going home to Japan.; they lived here in Mexico for four years. Some still remained here; they earn a living trading and selling here the goods they brought with them from Japan.&quot;

===Cuba===
The embassy stopped and changed ships in Havana in Cuba in July 1614. The embassy stayed in Havana for six days. A bronze statue was erected on 26 April 2001 at the head of Havana Bay.

==Mission to Europe==
Hasekura headed the &quot;Keichō&quot; Embassy (), a diplomatic mission to Pope Paul V and Europe from 1613 through 1620. It was preceded by the &quot;Tenshō embassy&quot; () of 1582. Crossing the Pacific aboard the &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot;a ship built for the purpose by MasamuneHasekura traveled to New Spain (now Mexico), arriving in Acapulco and departing from Veracruz. He visited various other ports-of-call in Europe on the way. On the return trip, Hasekura and his companions re-traced their route across New Spain in 1619, sailing from Acapulco for Manila, and then sailing north to Japan in 1620. He is conventionally considered the first Japanese ambassador in the Americas and in Spain.

===Spain===
The fleet arrived in Sanlúcar de Barrameda on 5 October 1614.

:&quot;The fleet arrived safely finally, after some dangers and storms, to the port of Sanlúcar de Barrameda on 5 October, where the Duke of Medina Sidonia was advised of the arrival. He sent carriages to honor them and accommodate the Ambassador and his gentlemen&quot;.

:&quot;The Japanese ambassador Hasekura Rokuemon, sent by Joate Masamune, king of Boju, entered Seville on Wednesday, 23 October 1614. He was accompanied by 30 Japanese with blades, their captain of the guard, and 12 bowmen and halberdiers with painted lances and blades of ceremony. The captain of the guard was Christian and was called Don Thomas, the son of a Japanese martyr&quot;.

The Japanese embassy met with King Philip III in Madrid on 30 January 1615. Hasekura remitted to the King a letter from Date Masamune, as well as offer for a treaty. The King responded that he would do what he could to accommodate these requests.

Hasekura was baptized on 17 February by the royal chaplain Diego de Guzmán in the Convent of Las Descalzas Reales, and renamed Felipe Francisco Hasekura in honor of the king and Sotelo&#x27;s order. The baptism ceremony was to have been conducted by the Archbishop of Toledo, Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas, though he was too ill to actually carry this out, and the Duke of Lermathe main administrator of Phillip III&#x27;s rule and the de facto ruler of Spainwas designated as Hasekura&#x27;s godfather.

The embassy traveled across Spain during the summer of 1615 at royal expense. They eventually received permission to travel for Rome in August, and left at the beginning of the same month.

===France===

After traveling across Spain, the embassy sailed on the Mediterranean aboard three Spanish frigates towards Italy. Due to bad weather, they had to stay for a few days in the French harbour of Saint-Tropez, where they were received by the local nobility, and made quite a sensation on the populace.

The visit of the Japanese Embassy is recorded in the city&#x27;s chronicles as led by &quot;Philip Francis Faxicura, Ambassador to the Pope, from Date Masamune, Lord of the Sendai Domain, Mutsu Province, Japan&quot;.

Many picturesque details of their movements were recorded:
:&quot;They never touch food with their fingers, but instead use two small sticks that they hold with three fingers.&quot;
:&quot;They blow their noses in soft silky papers the size of a hand, which they never use twice, so that they throw them on the ground after usage, and they were delighted to see our people around them precipitate themselves to pick them up.&quot;
:&quot;Their swords cut so well that they can cut a soft paper just by putting it on the edge and by blowing on it.&quot;

The visit of Hasekura Tsunenaga to Saint-Tropez in 1615 is the first recorded instance of France–Japan relations.

===Italy===
The Japanese Embassy arrived at Rome on 20 September 1615 and was received by Cardinal Burgecio; the delegation met Pope Paul V on 3 November. Hasekura remitted to the Pope two gilded letters, one in Japanese and one in Latin, containing a request for a trade treaty between Japan and Mexico and the dispatch of Christian missionaries to Japan. These letters are still visible in the Vatican archives. The Latin letter, probably written by Luis Sotelo for Date Masamune, reads, in part:

:Kissing the Holy feet of the Great, Universal, Most Holy Lord of The Entire World, Pope Paul, in profound submission and reverence, I, Idate Masamune, King of Wōshū in the Empire of Japan, suppliantly say:
:The Franciscan Padre Luis Sotelo came to our country to spread the faith of God. On that occasion, I learnt about this faith and desired to become a Christian, but I still haven&#x27;t accomplished this desire due to some small issues. However, in order to encourage my subjects to become Christians, I wish that you send missionaries of the Franciscan church. I guarantee that you will be able to build a church and that your missionaries will be protected. I also wish that you select and send a bishop as well. Because of that, I have sent one of my samurai, Hasekura Rokuemon, as my representative to accompany Luis Sotelo across the seas to Rome, to give you a stamp of obedience and to kiss your feet. Further, as our country and Nueva España are neighbouring countries, could you intervene so that we can discuss with the King of Spain, for the benefit of dispatching missionaries across the seas.&quot;

The Pope agreed to the dispatch of missionaries, but left the decision for trade to the King of Spain.

The Roman Senate also gave to Hasekura the honorary title of Roman Noble and Roman Citizen, in a document he brought back to Japan, and which is preserved today in Sendai.

Sotelo also described the visit to the Pope, book (published posthumously in 1634):

:&quot;When we got there by the aid of God in the Year of Our Salvation 1615, not only were we kindly received by His Holiness the great Pope, with the Holy College of the Cardinals and a gathering of bishops and nobles, and even the joy and general happiness of the Roman People, but we and three others (whom the Japanese Christians had specially designated to announce their condition with respect to the Christian religion) were heard, rested, and just as we were hoping, dispatched as quickly as possible.&quot;

===Rumours of political intrigue===
Besides the official description of Hasekura&#x27;s visit to Rome, some contemporary communications tend to indicate that political matters were also discussed, and that an alliance with Date Masamune was suggested as a way to establish Christian influence in the whole of Japan:
:&quot;The Ambassador strongly insisted that the authority and power of his ruler was superior to that of many European countries&quot; (Anonymous Roman communication, dated 10 October 1615)
:&quot;The Franciscan Spanish fathers are explaining that the King of the Ambassador [Hasekura Tsunenaga] will soon become the supreme ruler of his country, and that, not only will they become Christians and follow the will of the church of Rome, but they will also in turn convert the rest of the population. This is why they are requesting the dispatch of a high ecclesiastic together with the missionaries. Because of this, many people have been doubting the true purpose of the embassy, and are wondering if they are not looking for some other benefit.&quot; (Letter of the Venetian ambassador, 7 November 1615).

===Second visit to Spain===
For the second time in Spain, in April 1616 Hasekura met again with the King, who declined to sign a trade agreement, on the ground that the Japanese Embassy did not appear to be an official embassy from the ruler of Japan Tokugawa Ieyasu, who, on the contrary, had promulgated an edict in January 1614 ordering the expulsion of all missionaries from Japan, and started the persecution of the Christian faith in Japan.

Two years later, after their trip around Europe, the mission left Seville for New Spain (Mexico) in June 1616. Certain registration documents indicate that some Japanese could have stayed in Spain, which is possible given that they made their last stop in villages near Seville (Espartinas and Coria del Río). In modern Spain, there are families with &quot;Japón&quot; as a surname.

===Western publications on Hasekura&#x27;s embassy===
The embassy of Hasekura Tsunenaga was the subject of numerous publications throughout Europe. The Italian writer Scipione Amati, who accompanied the embassy in 1615 and 1616, published in 1615 in Rome a book titled &quot;History of the Kingdom of Woxu&quot;. This book was also translated into German in 1617. In 1616, the French publisher Abraham Savgrain published an account of Hasekura&#x27;s visit to Rome: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Account of the solemn and remarkable entrance in Rome of Dom Philippe Francois Faxicura&quot;).

===Return to Mexico===
Hasekura stayed in Mexico for 5 months on his way back to Japan. The &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot; had been waiting in Acapulco since 1616, after a second trip across the Pacific from Japan to Mexico. Captained by Yokozawa Shōgen, the ship was laden with fine pepper and lacquerware from Kyoto, which were sold on the Mexican market. To avoid too much silver leaving Mexico for Japan, the Spanish king requested that the Viceroy ask for the proceeds to be spent on Mexican goods, except for an amount of 12,000 pesos and 8,000 pesos in silver, which Hasekura and Yokozawa respectively were allowed to bring back with them.

===Philippines===
In April 1618, the &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot; arrived in the Philippines from Mexico, with Hasekura and Luis Sotelo on board. The ship was acquired by the Spanish government there, with the objective of building up defenses against incursions from Protestant powers. In Manila, the archbishop described the deal to the king of Spain in a missive dated 28 July 1619:

:&quot;The Governor was extremely friendly with the Japanese, and provided them with his protection. As they had many expensive things to buy, they decided to lend their ship. The ship was immediately furbished for combat. The Governor eventually bought the ship, because it turned out that it was of excellent and sturdy construction, and available ships were dramatically few. In favour of your Majesty, the price paid was reasonable.&quot; (Document 243)

During his stay in the Philippines, Hasekura purchased numerous goods for Date Masamune, and built a ship, as he explained in a letter he wrote to his son. He finally returned to Japan in August 1620, reaching the harbour of Nagasaki.

==Return to Japan==
By the time Hasekura came back, Japan had changed quite drastically: an effort to eradicate Christianity had been under way since 1614, Tokugawa Ieyasu had died in 1616 and been replaced by his more xenophobic son Tokugawa Hidetada, and Japan was moving towards the &quot;Sakoku&quot; policy of isolation. Because news of these persecutions arrived in Europe during Hasekura&#x27;s embassy, European rulers – especially the King of Spain – became very reluctant to respond favorably to Hasekura&#x27;s trade and missionary proposals.

Hasekura reported his travels to Date Masamune upon his arrival in Sendai. It is recorded that he remitted a portrait of Pope Paul V, a portrait of himself in prayer (shown above), and a set of Ceylonese and Malay/Indonesian daggers acquired in the Philippines, all preserved today in the Sendai City Museum. The &quot;Records of the House of Masamune&quot; describe his report in a rather succinct manner, ending with a rather cryptic expression of surprise bordering on the outrage (&quot;&quot;) at Hasekura&#x27;s discourse:
:&quot;Rokuemon went to the country of the Southern Barbarians, he paid his respects to the king Paolo, he stayed there for several years, and now he sailed back from Luzon. He brought paintings of the king of the Southern Barbarians, and a painting of himself, which he remitted. Many of his descriptions of the Southern Barbarian countries, and the meaning of Rokuemon&#x27;s declarations were surprising and extraordinary.&quot;

===Interdiction of Christianity in Sendai===
The direct effect of Hasekura&#x27;s return to Sendai was the interdiction of Christianity in the Sendai fief two days later:
:&quot;Two days after the return of Rokuemon to Sendai, a three-point edict against the Christian was promulgated: first, that all Christians were ordered to abandon their faith, in accordance with the rule of the &quot;shōgun&quot;, and for those who did not, they would be exiled if they were nobles, and killed if they were citizens, peasants or servants. Second, that a reward would be given for the denunciation of hidden Christians. Third that propagators of the Christian faith should leave the Sendai fief, or else, abandon their religion&quot;.

What Hasekura said or did to bring about such a result is unknown. As later events tend to indicate that he and his descendants remained faithful Christians, Hasekura may have made an enthusiastic – and to a certain extent, disturbing – account of the greatness and might of Western countries and the Christian religion. He may also have encouraged an alliance between the Church and Date Masamune to take over the country (an idea advertised by the Franciscans while in Rome), which, in 1620 Japan, would have been a totally unrealistic proposition. Lastly, hopes of trade with Spain evaporated when Hasekura communicated that the Spanish King would not enter an agreement as long as persecutions were occurring in the rest of the country.

Date Masamune suddenly chose to distance himself from the Western faith. The first executions of Christians started 40 days later. The anti-Christian measures taken by Date Masumune were, however, comparatively mild, and Japanese and Western Christians repeatedly claimed that he only took them to appease the &quot;shōgun&quot;:

:&quot;Date Masumune, out of fear of the &quot;shōgun&quot;, ordered the persecution of Christianity in his territory, and created several martyrs.&quot; (Letter of 17 prominent Japanese Christians from Sendai, to the Pope, 29 September 1621).

One month after Hasekura&#x27;s return, Date Masamune wrote a letter to the &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Hidetada, in which he makes a very clear effort to evade responsibility for the embassy, explaining in detail how it was organized with the approval, and even the collaboration, of the &quot;shōgun&quot;:

:&quot;When I sent a ship to the Southern Barbarian countries several years ago, upon the advice of Mukai Shōgen, I also dispatched the Southern Barbarian named Sotelo, who had resided for several years in Edo. At that time, your highness also gave messages for the Southern Barbarians, as well as presents, such as folding screens and sets of armour.&quot;

Spain, with a colony and an army in the nearby Philippines, was a source of concern for Japan at that time. Hasekura&#x27;s eyewitness accounts of Spanish power and colonial methods in New Spain (Mexico) may have precipitated the &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Hidetada&#x27;s decision to sever trade relations with Spain in 1623, and diplomatic relations in 1624, although other events such as the smuggling of Spanish priests into Japan and a failed Spanish embassy also contributed to the decision.

===Death===
What became of Hasekura is unknown and accounts of his last years are numerous. Contemporary Christian commentators could rely only on hearsay, with some rumours stating that he abandoned Christianity, others that he was martyred for his faith, and others that he practised Christianity in secret. The fate of his descendants and servants, who were later executed for being Christians, suggests that Hasekura remained strongly Christian and transmitted his faith to the members of his family.

Sotelo, who returned to Japan but was caught and finally burnt at the stake in 1624, gave before his execution an account of Hasekura returning to Japan as a hero who propagated the Christian faith:

:&quot;My other colleague, the ambassador Philippus Faxecura, after he reached his aforementioned king (Date Masamune), was greatly honored by him, and sent to his own estate, to rest after such a long and tiring journey, where he made his wife, children, servants, and many other vassals into Christians, and advised other nobles who were his kith and kin to accept the faith, which they indeed did. While he was engaged in these and other pious works, a full year after his return, having provided much instruction and a great example, with much preparation, he piously passed on, leaving for his children by a special inheritance the propagation of the faith in his estate, and the protection of the religious &quot;(i.e. &quot;members of religious orders&quot;)&quot; in that kingdom. The King and all the nobles were greatly saddened by his passing, but especially the Christians and Religious, who knew very well the virtue and religious zeal of this man. This is what I heard by letters from the very Religious who administered the sacraments to him, and who had been present at his death, as well as from others.&quot;

Hasekura also brought back to Japan several Catholic artifacts, but he did not give them to his ruler, and instead kept them on his own estate.

Hasekura Tsunenaga died of illness (according to Japanese as well as Christian sources) in 1622, but the location of his grave is not known for certain. Three graves are claimed as Hasekura&#x27;s in Miyagi. The most likely is in the outskirts of Ōsato town () in the temple of Saikō-ji (). Another is visible in the Buddhist temple of Enfuku-ji () in Kawasaki town. Another is clearly marked (along with a memorial to Sotelo) in the cemetery of the temple of Kōmyō-ji () in Kitayama Aoba-ku (Sendai).

===Execution of his descendants and servants===
Hasekura had a son, named Rokuemon Tsuneyori. Two of his son&#x27;s servants, Yogoemon (与五右衛門) and his wife, were convicted of being Christian but refused to recant their faith under torture (reverse hanging, called &quot;tsurushi&quot;) and as a result died in August 1637. In 1637, Rokuemon Tsuneyori himself also came under suspicion of Christianity after being denounced by someone from Edo, but escaped questioning because he was the master of the Zen temple of Komyoji ().

In 1640, two other servants of Tsuneyori, Tarōzaemon (太郎左衛門, 71), who had followed Hasekura to Rome, and his wife (59), were convicted of being Christians, and, also refusing to recant their faith under torture, died. Tsuneyori was held responsible this time and decapitated the same day, at the age of 42, for having failed to denounce Christians under his roof, although it remained unconfirmed whether he was himself Christian or not. Two Christian priests, the Dominican Pedro Vazquez and Joan Bautista Paulo, had given his name under torture. Tsuneyori&#x27;s younger brother, Tsunemichi, was convicted as a Christian, but managed to flee and disappear.

The privileges of the Hasekura family were abolished at this point by the Sendai fief, and their property and belongings seized. It is at this time, in 1640, that Hasekura&#x27;s Christian artifacts were confiscated, and they were kept in custody in Sendai until they were rediscovered at the end of the 19th century.

Altogether, around fifty Christian artifacts were found in Hasekura&#x27;s estate in 1640, such as crosses, rosaries, religious gowns, and religious paintings. The artifacts were seized and stored by the Date fief. An inventory was made again in 1840 describing the items as belonging to Hasekura Tsunenaga. Nineteen books were also mentioned in the inventory, but they have been lost since. The artifacts are today preserved in the Sendai City Museum and other museums in Sendai.

Tsuneyori&#x27;s son, Tsunenobu (常信), grandson of Tsunenaga Hasekura, survived. He founded a Hasekura family line that continues to the present day. The first to 10th heads of the Hasekura Family lived in Osato-city, Miyagi Prefecture. The 11th head moved to Wakabayashi Ward, Sendai City, Miyagi Prefecture where the present 13th head, Tsunetaka Hasekura, resides. The 13th head actively works in both Miyagi and Akita Prefectures.

==Legacy==
The very existence of the travels of Hasekura was forgotten in Japan until the reopening of the country after the Sakoku policy of isolation. In 1873, a Japanese embassy to Europe (the Iwakura mission) headed by Iwakura Tomomi heard for the first time of the travels of Hasekura when shown documents during their visit to Venice in Italy.

There are statues of Hasekura Tsunenaga in the outskirts of Acapulco in Mexico, at the entrance of Havana Bay in Cuba, in Coria del Río in Spain, in the Church of Civitavecchia in Italy, in Tsukinoura, near Ishinomaki, and two in Osato town in Miyagi. Approximately 700 inhabitants of Coria del Río bear the surname &quot;Japón&quot; (originally &quot;Hasekura de Japón&quot;), identifying them as descendants of the members of Hasekura Tsunenaga&#x27;s delegation. A theme park describing the embassy and displaying a replica of the &quot;San Juan Bautista&quot; was established in the harbour of Ishinomaki, from which Hasekura initially departed on his voyage.

===Works based on his life===
Shūsaku Endō wrote a 1980 novel, titled &quot;The Samurai&quot;, a fictitious account relating the travels of Hasekura. A 2005 animation film, produced in Spain and titled &quot;Gisaku&quot;, relates the adventures of a young Japanese samurai named Yohei who visited Spain in the 17th century, in a story loosely taking its inspiration from the travels of Hasekura. Yohei survived in hiding to the present day due to magical powers (&quot;After centuries of lethargy, he awakes in a World he does not know&quot;), and accomplishes many adventures in modern Europe as a superhero. 

The 2017 fictional historical novel &quot;The Samurai of Seville&quot; by John J. Healey recounts the travels of Hasekura and his delegation of 21 samurai. A 2019 sequel entitled &quot;The Samurai&#x27;s Daughter&quot; tells the story of a young woman born to one of the samurai and a Spanish lady, and her journey to Japan with her father following her mother&#x27;s death.

The 2018 French documentary &quot;Un samouraï au Vatican&quot;, directed by Stéphane Bégoin, chronicles the travels of the diplomatic mission to Europe led by Hasekura Tsunenaga. Subsequently, in 2021 an edited version of the documentary aired as the 5th episode of the 19th season of the PBS documentary TV series &quot;Secrets of the Dead&quot;.

<text>Dębica (; &quot;Dembitz&quot;) is a town in southeastern Poland with 44,692 inhabitants as of December 2021. It is the capital of Dębica County. Since 1999 it has been situated in the Podkarpackie Voivodeship; it had previously been in the Tarnów Voivodeship (1975–1998). Dębica belongs to the historic province of Lesser Poland, and for centuries it was part of the Sandomierz Voivodeship.

==Area and location==
According to the 2006 data, Dębica&#x27;s area is . Arable land makes 42% of the area of the town, while forests make 19%. Dębica is the seat of the county, and the town covers 4.34% of the county&#x27;s area. Dębica lies at the border of two geographical regions of Poland – the Carpathian Piedmont in southern districts of the town, and the Sandomierz Basin in its north, along the Wisłoka river.

==Economy==
Since the mid-1930s Dębica, despite its size, has been a large industrial hub. A number of companies were then created thanks to government-led industrial development programs. 

Most of these companies still exist today, though they were privatized in the 1990s:
* Firma Oponiarska Dębica S.A. (Tire Company Dębica) now owned by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, previous name - Stomil Dębica
* Lerg S.A. - a chemical manufacturer located in the village of Pustków, a village in Dębica County
* Tikkurila Polska S.A. (formerly Polifarb Dębica) - a paint manufacturer
* Wytwórnia Urządzeń Chłodniczych WUCh (Manufacturer of Refrigeration Equipment WUCh)
* Zakłady Mięsne (Meat Processing Plant)

Since the early 1990s a relatively large number (relative to the city&#x27;s size) of successful companies have been started and run by local residents:
* Bicycle, motorcycle and electric car manufacturer Arkus and Romet Group
* Sportatut - producer of sports nutritionals
* Chemical industry manufacturers (paint producers such as Śnieżka Brzeźnica and Plastbud Pustków)
* Marble producer Jabo Marmi and brickyard Igloobud
* Food companies such as Igloomeat and Animex Poludnie

==Transport==
The A4 highway passes just north of the city, with two exits providing access to Dębica. The westbound section of the highway, from Dębica to Tarnów, was completed in October 2014. As a result, the city now has a direct highway connection to Poland&#x27;s western border, and consequently to all of Western Europe. A drive to Kraków (approximately 120 km) takes about an hour, while Rzeszów, the capital of the Podkarpackie Voivodeship, located east of Dębica, can be reached in under 30 minutes.

Dębica is also situated along National Road 94, which was previously part of the European route E40. This two-lane road has been renovated in recent years, but with the completion of the A4 highway, its importance has diminished. Additionally, Dębica is connected to the cities of Mielec and Tarnobrzeg via local road number 985. Dębica is located on a key railway line that runs from Poland&#x27;s western to eastern borders. Trains on this line can reach speeds of up to 160 km/h, allowing the fastest Express InterCity Premium services to reach Kraków in just over an hour. Between 1988 and 1990, Dębica was also connected to Straszęcin by a trolleybus line.

==Education==
Dębica has been home to two branches of higher education institutions:
* Wyższa Szkoła Informatyki i Zarządzania in Rzeszów, branch in Dębica
* University of Economics in Kraków, branch in Dębica

==History==
===Middle Ages===
One of the oldest documented references to this area dates back to the year 1293. It records a settlement by the name of &quot;Dambicha&quot;, belonging to the noble Gryfita family. In 1305, the village was raided by the Tatars, who burned down a wooden church. The church was rebuilt in 1318, and by 1325, Dębica became the seat of a deanery, located on the outskirts of the mighty Sandomierz Forest. The Dębica Deanery consisted of fourteen parishes, including Przecław, Sędziszów Małopolski, and Strzyżów.

In 1358, King Casimir III the Great granted local nobleman Świętosław Gryfita permission to establish a town, and Dębica received town rights, along with the privilege to hold weekly markets on Wednesdays. However, the town was not officially founded until June 10, 1372, when Mikołaj of Lipiny was appointed its first wójt. Dębica was conveniently located along the main merchant route from Kraków to Lwów, but the newly founded town struggled to compete with older urban centers in the area, such as Pilzno and Ropczyce. In 1446, King Władysław III of Poland authorized annual fairs to be held on Ash Wednesdays, spurring the town&#x27;s growth. Despite this, Dębica remained a small town for many years, located in Pilzno County, part of the Sandomierz Voivodeship in the province of Lesser Poland. Without a defensive wall for protection, the town was vulnerable to invasions by the Tatars, Swedes, and Hungarians, who frequently burned or plundered it. As a result, few historical monuments have survived in Dębica. One notable exception is the Saint Jadwiga church, originally built in the 14th century but completely reconstructed in the late 19th century.

 In 1474, Dębica, along with other towns in southern Lesser Poland, was ransacked by the Black Army of Hungary. In 1502, a Crimean Tatar raid caused widespread devastation, leaving the town burned and depopulated.

===Early modern era===
To prevent the complete disappearance of Dębica, its owners exempted residents from all taxes for 14 years, also allowing them to collect free timber and firewood in local forests. In 1504, Dębica was exempted from royal taxes by King Alexander Jagiellon. Due to all these privileges, Dębica emerged in the 16th century as a local center of skilled craftsmen. Still, it was much smaller than Pilzno and Ropczyce, also because it remained a private town, whose owners argued with each other. In 1554, most of Dębica burned down, together with the wooden parish church of St. Margaret. In the late 16th century, the population of the town was app. 700.

Like most of Lesser Poland&#x27;s towns and cities, Dębica was completely destroyed in the Swedish invasion of Poland, when Swedes and Transylvanians of George II Rakoczi burned and ransacked the town (1655 - 1660). After the invasion, the population of Dębica was reduced to app. 200, with only 30 houses. As a result, the owners of the town allowed the first Jews to settle in Dębica. The first settlers arrived in 1676–1690. They expanded the town&#x27;s population, and had a positive influence on the town&#x27;s economy.

In the late 17th century, the so-called &quot;New Dębica&quot; was established, around the now non-existing St. Barbara church, app. one kilometre () west of &quot;Old Dębica&quot;. Both Dębicas had different mayors, who were governed by one wójt. In the course of time, the towns merged, and the market square of &quot;New Dębica&quot; now serves as the center of the town. Dębica was completely destroyed during the Great Northern War, and the destruction was so severe that the town slowly turned into a farming village. In the late 18th century, it belonged to the Radziwiłł family.

===Late modern era===
A battle between Poles and Russians took place here during the Bar Confederation, and in 1772, as a result of the First Partition of Poland, Dębica was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, as part of newly established Galicia, where it remained until November 1918. Austrian authorities decided that it should no longer be regarded as a town, but rather a village and renamed it &quot;Dembitz&quot;. This decision marked the decline of the town.

Bad times came to an end in the second half of the 19th century, when the Austrian government decided to build a main West-East railroad line (see Galician Railway of Archduke Charles Louis), connecting two major urban centres of Galicja - Kraków and Lwów. A railroad station was built in Dębica, and at the end of the 19th century, another, northbound line was constructed, joining Dębica and the town of Sandomierz, which was located on the Austrian-Russian boundary. The town became a rail junction, which was a huge boost for its citizens. In 1900 a high school was opened, and in 1908 students from this school founded one of the oldest sports clubs in Poland, Wisłoka Dębica (whose name comes from the River Wisłoka, which flows by the town). Just before World War I, Dębica was again incorporated as a town. The war was a disaster for the town, as it was almost completely destroyed. During several campaigns, Dębica was occupied by Russian, Austrian, Hungarian and German troops, which fought in this area for many months in 1914 - 1915. The Entente Powers wanted to get through the Carpathian Range towards Slovakia, Bohemia and Hungary, while the Central Powers managed to stop them at the beginning of 1915. These events had a great impact on the town and hampered its development for many years.
In 1918, after Poland regained independence, Dębica was included in the Kraków Voivodeship, in the county of Ropczyce. The economic situation of the town did not change - there was no industry, very few jobs available and surrounding villages were strongly overpopulated. This started to change in 1936, when Polish government announced the creation of the Central Industrial Area. It was a huge public works project, aimed at fighting unemployment in this overpopulated part of Poland, as well as creating heavy industry, concentrated on the production of arms. Dębica started to develop very fast; so fast, that in 1937 the county&#x27;s capital was moved here from Ropczyce. Among several factories built in the town at that time, the most important was &quot;Stomil&quot; (now called &quot;Tire Company Dębica&quot;, and belonging to the Goodyear). Other factories were: &quot;Wytwórnia Urządzeń Chłodniczych WUCh&quot; and &quot;Zakłady Tworzyw Sztucznych &quot;Pustków&quot;&quot;, built from scratch, together with a workers&#x27; settlement, in Pustków Osiedle, northeast of Dębica. Some time in 1938 or 1939 work on another rail connection from Dębica to Jasło, via Pilzno was started. the Second World War stopped this construction, and after the war it was not continued.

===World War II===
The occupation of Dębica by Nazi Germany started on September 8, 1939. The &quot;Einsatzgruppe I&quot; entered the town in September 1939 to commit various crimes against Poles. The Germans created a ghetto for the town&#x27;s Jewish population, eventually killing most of them either on the spot or in the Auschwitz concentration camp. In the forested hills south of the town, strong Polish underground forces operated, with numerous units of the Home Army (&quot;AK&quot;). It was too dangerous for AK officers to stay in Dębica, thus the headquarters of a local underground district (known as &quot;Deser&quot;) were located at a nearby village of Gumniska, located in the hilly area south of the town. Resistance fighters were very active here, often attacking the main Kraków-Lwów rail line, used by German troops. In early 1944, units of the local Armia Krajowa district unsuccessfully tried to blow up a train with Hans Frank, which was passing through the village station at Czarna Tarnowska, some west of Dębica. As a reprisal, on February 2, 1944, the Germans murdered 50 Poles by the rail track in Dębica (also see Otto Schimek).
On the outskirts of Dębica, near the villages of Pustków and Blizna and several neighboring ones, the Germans established a massive military base called Heidelager in the fall of 1941, which included the Blizna V-2 missile launch site for weapons testing, and the training of new Ukrainian collaborationist military formations including the &quot;SS Galizien Division&quot;. It is estimated that over the duration of the &quot;SS Heidelager&quot; training base operation, some 15,000 slave-labour prisoners perished there, including 7,500 Jews, 5,000 Soviet POWs, and 2,500 Poles, on top of an estimated 1,000 Soviet soldiers who died in the area during the Nazi-Soviet war. Their remains are buried in the cemetery along the road to Pustków Drips. Originally, the cemetery was located inside the ring IV (Dąbrówki). Later, the graves of soldiers were exhumed and moved. A Russian colonel killed in the fighting is buried in one of the tombs.

Implicated in war crimes was SS-man Alois Kurz (ID 382378) who, from 1940 to 21 April 1941, served in the SS Regiment &quot;Westland,&quot; then was assigned to a construction battalion for the SS training ground and labor camp serving the &quot;SS Truppenubungsplatz Heidelager&quot; in Pustków. Also implicated in war crimes was Wilhelm Schitli, commander of the &quot;Jewish camp&quot; at the SS training area &quot;HL-Heidelager&quot; from October 1942 to September 1943.

Polish priest Jan Nagórzański, who joined the Polish resistance and rescued Jews during the occupation, was arrested by the Germans, but was soon liberated by the Home Army in 1944. In 1945, he was beaten by Russian troops, and then fell ill with typhus and died in Dębica. In 1945 the town was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which remained in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s.

===Post-war===
After the war, in new, Communist Poland, Dębica again became the seat of a county, but the town was moved from the Kraków to the Rzeszów Voivodeship. In 1946, executions of anti-communist activists took place there (1946 Public execution in Dębica). Polish priest Jan Wójcik, who aided Polish partisans and Jews during the German occupation, died in Dębica in 1954, shortly after he was released from prison by the communists, who imprisoned him in 1949. War destruction again stopped the town&#x27;s development, but recovery this time was fast and based on pre-war factories. In 1975, after administrative reform, counties in Poland ceased to exist and were replaced by numerous and small Voivodeships. Dębica again was moved - this time from Rzeszów to the newly created Tarnów Voivodeship. In the late 1970s, Dębica gained importance as a centre of food and agricultural production. This was due to the creation of &quot;Kombinat Rolno-Spozywczy Igloopol&quot;, which, under an influential Communist dignitary Edward Brzostowski, developed very fast. &quot;Igloopol&quot; built a huge factory and a completely new district, with numerous condominiums, located on the northern side of the rail line. The company achieved its peak in the late 1980s. After the collapse of the Communist regime, the company was divided into several smaller firms, controlled by former Communist activists.

==Sports==

There are two major sports clubs in Dębica. Klub Sportowy (Sports Club) Wisłoka Dębica, founded in 1908, is one of the oldest sports organizations in the country. Wisłoka is famous for its wrestlers, who have won numerous medals in the Olympic Games, World and European Championships. Other fields in which Wisłoka&#x27;s athletes achieved significant achievements are: soccer, boxing, cycling and karate. The club was sponsored by Tire Company Dębica and it had its heyday in the 1970s.

Another team, Igloopol Dębica, was founded in 1978 and is the brainchild of a prominent activist of Polish communist party, Edward Brzostowski. Igloopol enjoyed strong support from the local government. Brzostowski was for some time Minister of Agriculture and director of Polish Football Association, so his favorite team prospered in soccer as well as in boxing, achieving significant successes. Igloopol&#x27;s best years, the late 1980s, are closely associated with the peak of its sponsor. Lately, both teams played in regional lower divisions, hoping to win promotion. Both clubs contest the Dębica derby, one of the fiercest derbies in south-eastern Poland.

<text>HMAS &quot;Canberra&quot; (FFG 02) was an &quot;Adelaide&quot; class guided missile frigate of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Based on the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; class design, &quot;Canberra&quot; was one of four &quot;Adelaide&quot; class ships constructed in the United States of America, and one of six to serve in the RAN.

The frigate entered service in 1981. During her career, &quot;Canberra&quot; was assigned to escort the Royal Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; during Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s visit in 1988, helped enforce the post-Gulf War United Nations&#x27; sanctions against Iraq during 1992 and 1993, was part of the Australian responses to the 1998 Indonesian riots and the 2000 Solomon Islands Civil War, and returned to the Persian Gulf in 2002 as part of the War in Afghanistan.

In 2005, &quot;Canberra&quot; became the first ship of her class to be decommissioned. The frigate was marked for conversion into a dive wreck and artificial reef off Barwon Heads, Victoria, and was scuttled on 4 October 2009.

==Design and construction==

Following the cancellation of the Australian light destroyer project in 1973, the British Type 42 destroyer and the American were identified as alternatives to replace the cancelled light destroyers and the s. Although the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; class was still at the design stage, the difficulty of fitting the Type 42 with the SM-1 missile, and the success of the acquisition (a derivative of the American ) compared to equivalent British designs led the Australian government to approve the purchase of two US-built &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigates (including &quot;Canberra&quot;) in 1976. A third was ordered in 1977, followed by a fourth, with all four ships integrated into the USN&#x27;s shipbuilding program. A further two ships were ordered in 1980, and were constructed in Australia.

As designed, the ship had a full load displacement of 3,605 tons, a length overall of , a beam of , and a draught of . Starting in December 1991, &quot;Canberra&quot; was modified from the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; FLIGHT II design to FLIGHT III, requiring a lengthening of the helicopter deck for the RAST helicopter recovery system, increasing displacement to 4,100 tons and pushing the overall length to . Propulsion machinery consists of two General Electric LM2500 gas turbines, which provide a combined to the single propeller shaft. Top speed is , with a range of at . Two electric auxiliary propulsors are used for close manoeuvring, with a top speed of . Standard ship&#x27;s company is 184, including 15 officers, but excluding the flight crew for the embarked helicopters.

Original armament for the ship consisted of a Mark 13 missile launcher configured to fire RIM-66 Standard and RGM-84 Harpoon missiles, supplemented by an OTO Melara gun and a Vulcan Phalanx point-defence system. For anti-submarine warfare, two Mark 32 torpedo tube sets are fitted; originally firing the Mark 44 torpedo, the &quot;Adelaide&quot;s later carried the Mark 46 torpedoes. Up to six machine guns can be carried for close-in defence, and since 2005, two M2HB .50 calibre machine guns in Mini Typhoon mounts have been installed when needed for Persian Gulf deployments. The sensor suite includes an AN/SPS-49 air search radar, AN/SPS-55 surface search and navigation radar, SPG-60 fire control radar connected to a Mark 92 fire control system, and an AN/SQS-56 hull-mounted sonar. Two helicopters can be embarked: either two S-70B Seahawk or one Seahawk and one AS350B Squirrel.

&quot;Canberra&quot; was laid down as the first ship of the &quot;Perry&quot; class&#x27;s Flight II design by Todd Pacific Shipyards at Seattle, Washington on 1 March 1978, and launched on 1 December 1978. &quot;Canberra&quot; was commissioned into the RAN on 21 March 1981. The ship received the United States Navy hull number FFG-18 during construction.

===Armament===
&quot;Canberra&quot;″s main weapon was the Mark 13 missile launcher located on the foredeck: this is used to fire both Harpoon and SM-2MR Standard missiles. A Mark 75 OTO Melara gun is located on top of the superstructure, in front of the exhaust funnel. A triple-barrelled Mark 32 torpedo tube set is fitted to each side of the superstructure. For close defence, a Mark 16 Mod 2 Phalanx CIWS sits at the aft end of the superstructure, above the frigate&#x27;s two helicopter hangars.

The hangars housed two S-70B Seahawk helicopters.

==Operational history==
After commissioning, &quot;Canberra&quot; and &quot;Adelaide&quot; remained in the United States to work up; during this time both ships were attached to the United States Navy&#x27;s Destroyer Squadron 9.

&quot;Canberra&quot; was assigned as escort to the Royal Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; during Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s visit to Australia during April and May 1988, as part of the Australian Bicentennary celebrations.
On 16 May 1990, &quot;Canberra&quot; was one of six Australian warships, and one of 64 naval vessels from 21 nations present at the Royal Fleet Review marking the 55th anniversary of the Royal Malaysian Navy.

&quot;Canberra&quot; was deployed to the Red Sea from 13 November 1992 to 12 March 1993 following the Gulf War, as part of the enforcement of the United Nations&#x27; sanctions against Iraq.

In December 1993, &quot;Canberra&quot; and the destroyer visited Langkawi, Malaysia, for the Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition. During this assignment, ship&#x27;s divers from &quot;Canberra&quot; assisted the Royal Malaysian Police in searching for and recovering the body of a merchant sailor who had fallen overboard from MV &quot;Leisureworld&quot;. Following this, the two ships sailed for New Zealand, and were present in the Bay of Islands for Waitangi Day, which commemorates the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi there on 6 February 1840, which brought New Zealand into the British Empire.

The frigate&#x27;s home base was changed from Fleet Base East in New South Wales to Fleet Base West in Western Australia in February 1996.

On 17 May 1998, the frigate was one of four RAN ships placed on standby to help evacuate Australian citizens from Indonesia following riots. &quot;Canberra&quot; made at least one evacuation before the force was instructed to stand down a week later.

Following the conclusion of the Solomon Islands Civil War in 2000, &quot;Canberra&quot; was the last Australian warship sent to the Solomons to support the International Peace Monitoring Team; arriving on 13 September 2001, and remaining on station until 24 October.

After returning to Australia for Christmas and the New Year, the frigate accompanied the replenishment oiler to Heard Island and McDonald Islands in January 2002, where the two ships spent a month enforcing Australian sovereign rights and fisheries laws in the islands&#x27; Exclusive Economic Zone. During this deployment, on 7 February, the ship captured the Russian fishing vessel &quot;Volga&quot;, which was illegally operating around Heard Island. Later in the year, &quot;Canberra&quot; joined sister ship and the amphibious warfare ship on a three-month deployment to the Persian Gulf in support of the International Coalition Against Terrorism.

In July 2003, while operating in northern Australian waters, &quot;Canberra&quot; intercepted Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel (SIEV) 13, the first SIEV to be intercepted since December 2001.

&quot;Canberra&quot; was decommissioned at Fleet Base West in Western Australia on 12 November 2005.

==Dive wreck==

In October 2006, it was announced that the decommissioned frigate would be scuttled off the coast of Barwon Heads, Victoria as a wreck diving site. In October 2006, the Federal Government allocated A$2.8 million to the project, while the Victorian Government allocated A$500,000. On 23 July 2007, the Minister for Defence, Brendan Nelson, announced that in order to ensure the quickest possible schedule for the sinking of the ship, A$7 million of federal money would be allocated to the project.

The frigate was scheduled to be scuttled in of water, off Ocean Grove, Victoria on 13 September 2009, but this was postponed until 4 October because of foul weather. Sixteen scuttling charges were detonated at 1400 hours, following a six-hour delay in towing the ship into position. &quot;Canberra&quot; was inspected the next day by civilian clearance divers to ensure she had settled safely. The wreck was opened to the public as a dive site on 5 December, after four mooring pylons for dive boats were installed and safety checks and remedial work were carried out. In early 2011, Parks Victoria posted a warning that the port side of the hangar had separated from the rest of the superstructure, with frames and plating shifting up to . In mid-2011, Parks Victoria closed the dive site due to safety concerns following further degradation of the frigate. After assessment, the site was reopened on 24 October 2011.

As part of an overhaul of the RAN battle honours system, completed in March 2010, &quot;Canberra&quot; was retroactively awarded the battle honour &quot;Persian Gulf 2002&quot; for her service during the war in Afghanistan.

<doc id="1199057" wikidata="Q16982267" url="?curid=1199057" title="Mount Gretna Narrow Gauge Railway">
<text>The Mount Gretna Narrow Gauge Railway was a narrow-gauge line of the Cornwall and Lebanon Railroad in the state of Pennsylvania that operated between 1889 and 1915 under the parent Cornwall and Lebanon Railroad Company. The C&amp;L Railroad earlier had established a station and picnic ground at Mount Gretna.

== History ==
The Gilded Age iron industrialist and railroad president Robert Habersham Coleman decided that a narrow-gauge railroad to the top of nearby Governor Dick Mountain would provide an additional tourist draw, and a spur at milepost 0.75 could service the Pennsylvania National Guard rifle ranges nearby. The line was built to the rare (in North America) and very narrow gauge of . Locomotives, apart from an early and unsuccessful H. K. Porter, Inc Forney locomotive numbered 11 (first 11), were three &quot;American&quot; types (#12, #11 (second 11), and #15 built in that order) built by Baldwin Locomotive Works. Baldwin locomotive #11 was ordered on 22 June 1889 and built in only 8 days to be ready for anticipated Independence Day crowds after the Porter Forney wheelbase proved too rigid for reliable service on small-radius curves. The Baldwin locomotives featured lagged smokeboxes and were the only gauge s ever operated in North America (discounting Crown Metal Products locomotives); although Baldwin built a gauge for the Ferrocarril de Tacubaya of Mexico City in 1897.

Rails weighing were spiked onto the face of ties long. A turntable, engine-house, water tank, and storage tracks were near the junction with the Cornwall &amp; Lebanon at Mount Gretna. Return loops were built near the rifle range and around Governor Dick peak. During the summer of 1889 passengers were carried in one conventional coach and 7 open-sided observation cars boarded from long foot-boards running along the length of either side of the car, though typically trains consisted of only one to three coaches. These eight passenger cars were built by the Jackson &amp; Sharp Company. Two more observation cars were added when locomotive #15 was purchased for the summer of 1890. At first the railroad was popular, but the tourist trade declined after the novelty had died down. The loop around Governor Dick was dismantled after the summer of 1896, but the railroad continued operation for the National Guard rifle range. A serious accident on the 11th of July, 1915 killed off that traffic. One of the observation cars overturned on a sharp curve when a large number of guardsmen attempted to board simultaneously from one side of the car. There were some serious injuries, and the tiny railroad ceased operation in the summer of 1916, shortly after its parent company&#x27;s purchase by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Most sources state that the narrow-gauge equipment was loaded aboard standard gauge cars on 14 September 1916. However, a newspaper clipping dating from the 24th of December, 1920 mentions the departure of &quot;two miniature steam locomotives&quot; with reference to the narrow gauge railroad. This clipping is backed up by numerous other reports from around that same time.

=== Locomotives ===
== Cornwall and Lebanon Railroad ==
The standard-gauge Cornwall and Lebanon Railroad continued operations as a branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and later Penn Central Transportation Company until 1972. Hurricane Agnes caused flood damage, preventing operation of trains on the branch, and the damage was not repaired. The branch was converted to the 21st-century Lebanon Valley Rail Trail after the rails were removed.

<text>The Dorking is a British breed of domestic chicken. It is named after the town of Dorking, in Surrey in southern England.

== History ==

The Dorking is among the oldest British chicken breeds. It has sometimes been suggested that it derives from five-toed (rather than the usual four-toed) chickens brought to Britain by the Romans in the first century AD, but it is not known whether the Romans brought poultry with them, nor if they found five-toed poultry when they arrived. The Roman writer Columella, active at that time, mentions five-toed hens as being the best breeding-stock: &quot;they are reckoned the most generous which have five toes&quot;.

The Dorking originated in the southern home counties in south-east England, and is named after the market town of Dorking, in Surrey, from where birds were sent to the markets of London. It was the principal meat breed supplied to the metropolis until it was displaced by the Sussex in the early part of the twentieth century; it also became popular as an exhibition bird. It was among the breeds shown at the first poultry show, at London Zoo in 1845.

The Dorking was included in the first poultry standard, &quot;The Standard of Excellence in Exhibition Poultry&quot;, edited by William Bernhardt Tegetmeier and published in 1865 by the original Poultry Club of Great Britain. In the late nineteenth century, separate breed societies formed for the various colour varieties; two of these merged to form the Dorking Club, and a Scottish Dorking Club also formed. By about the time of the Second World War, none of these remained active. Interest in the breed had decreased rapidly, and it drew close to extinction. The Dorking Club was restarted in 1970.

Three colour varieties – coloured, silver-grey and white – were included in the first Standard of Perfection of the American Poultry Association in 1874; the red was added in 1995. Three bantam varieties – coloured, silver-grey and rose-comb white – were added in 1960.

== Characteristics ==

The Dorking has a rectangular body with short, five-toed legs. As with all single comb poultry, the comb points may require protection in extremely cold weather. Dorkings are well known for their versatility as a breed for both egg and meat production. It is one of the few breeds with red earlobes that produces a white-shelled egg. The skin colour beneath the feathers is white. The weight is for cocks, for cockerels and for hens. There are five recognised colour varieties: white, silver-grey, red, dark and cuckoo.

<text>Directory Opus (or &quot;DOpus&quot; as its users tend to call it) is a file manager program, originally written for the Amiga computer system in the early to mid-1990s. Commercial development on the version for the Amiga ceased in 1997. Directory Opus is still being actively developed and sold for the Microsoft Windows operating system by GPSoftware and there are open source releases of Directory Opus 4 and 5 for Amiga.

Directory Opus was originally developed by, and is still written by, Australian Jonathan Potter. Until 1994, it was published by well-known Amiga software company Inovatronics, when Potter joined with Greg Perry and the Australian-based GPSoftware to continue its development, and has since been published by GPSoftware.

==Features==

Directory Opus has evolved since its first release in 1990 as a basic two-panel file manager. The interface has evolved significantly due to feedback given by its users. Some of the features include:
*Single or dual-panel exploring.
*Folder tree (either shared or separate for dual-display).
*Tabbed explorer panels.
*Ability to maintain date created/modified timestamps for both files and folders.
*Internal handling of ZIP, RAR, 7Zip and other archive formats (browse them like folders).
*Internal FTP handling, including (for a small extra fee) advanced FTP and SSH (browse these like folders also).
*Internal MTP handling for portable devices like phones and cameras.
*Flat-file display, where you can flatten a folder tree and even hide the folders themselves.
*Powerful file selection and renaming tools, with advanced regex.
*User-definable toolbars, menus, filetypes and filetype groups.
*Preview panel, with preview of thumbnails (including animated avi thumbnails).
*File collections. These are like virtual folders that contain links to the original files (unlike shortcuts, these actually deal with the files directly).

<doc id="1199083" wikidata="Q1070391" url="?curid=1199083" title="Sabaic">
<text>Sabaic, sometimes referred to as Sabaean, was a Sayhadic language that was spoken between c. 1000 BC and the 6th century AD by the Sabaeans. It was used as a written language by some other peoples of the ancient civilization of South Arabia, including the Ḥimyarites, Ḥashidites, Ṣirwāḥites, Humlanites, Ghaymānites, and Radmānites. Sabaic belongs to the South Arabian Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family. Sabaic is distinguished from the other members of the Sayhadic group by its use of &quot;h&quot; to mark the third person and as a causative prefix; all of the other languages use &quot;s1&quot; in those cases. Therefore, Sabaic is called an &quot;h&quot;-language and the others &quot;s&quot;-languages. Numerous other Sabaic inscriptions have also been found dating back to the Sabean colonization of Africa.

Sabaic is very similar to Arabic and the languages may have been mutually intelligible.

== Script ==
Sabaic was written in the South Arabian alphabet, and like Hebrew and Arabic marked only consonants, the only indication of vowels being with matres lectionis. For many years the only texts discovered were inscriptions in the formal Masnad script (Sabaic &quot;ms3nd&quot;), but in 1973 documents in another minuscule and cursive script were discovered, dating back to the second half of the 1st century BC; only a few of the latter have so far been published.

The South Arabic alphabet used in Yemen, Eritrea, Djibouti, and Ethiopia beginning in the 8th century BC, in all three locations, later evolved into the still in use Geʽez script. The Geʽez language however is no longer considered to be a descendant of Sabaic or of Sayhadic; and there is linguistic evidence that Semitic languages were concurrently in use, being spoken in Eritrea and Ethiopia as early as 2000 BC.

Sabaic is attested in some 1,040 dedicatory inscriptions, 850 building inscriptions, 200 legal texts, and 1300 short graffiti (containing only personal names). No literary texts of any length have yet been brought to light. This paucity of source material and the limited forms of the inscriptions has made it difficult to get a complete picture of Sabaic grammar. Thousands of inscriptions written in a cursive script (called &quot;Zabur&quot;) incised into wooden sticks have been found and date to the Middle Sabaic period; these represent letters and legal documents and as such includes a much wider variety of grammatical forms.

== Varieties ==
* Sabaic: the language of the kingdom of Saba and later also of Ḥimyar; also documented in the kingdom of Da&#x27;amot; very well documented, c. 6000 inscriptions
** Old Sabaic: mostly boustrophedon inscriptions from the 9th until the 8th century BC and including further texts in the next two centuries from Ma&#x27;rib and the Highlands.
** Middle Sabaic: 3rd century BC until the end of the 3rd century AD. The best-documented language. The largest corpus of texts from this period comes from the Awwam Temple (otherwise known as Maḥrem Bilqīs) in Ma&#x27;rib.
*** Amiritic/Ḥaramitic: the language of the area to the north of Ma&#x27;īn
*** Central Sabaic: the language of the inscriptions from the Sabaean heartland
*** South Sabaic: the language of the inscriptions from Radmān and Ḥimyar
*** &quot;Pseudo-Sabaic&quot;: the literary language of Arabian tribes in Najrān, Ḥaram and Qaryat al-Fāw
** Late Sabaic: 4th–6th centuries AD. This is the monotheistic period when Christianity and Judaism brought Aramaic and Greek influences.

In the Late Sabaic period the ancient names of the gods are no longer mentioned and only one deity Raḥmānān is referred to. The last known inscription in Sabaic dates from 554 or 559 AD. The language&#x27;s eventual extinction was brought about by the later rapid expansion of Islam, bringing with it Northern Arabic or &quot;Muḍarī&quot;, which became the language of culture and writing, totally supplanting Sabaic.

The dialect used in the western Yemeni highlands, known as Central Sabaic, is very homogeneous and generally used as the language of the inscriptions. Divergent dialects are usually found in the area surrounding the Central Highlands, such as the important dialect of the city of Ḥaram in the eastern al-Jawf. Inscriptions in the Ḥaramic dialect, which is heavily influenced by North Arabic, are also generally considered a form of Sabaic. The Himyarites, whose spoken language was Semitic but not South Arabic, used Sabaic as a written language.

== Phonology ==

=== Vowels ===

Since Sabaic is written in an abjad script leaving vowels unmarked, little can be said for certain about the vocalic system. However, based on other Semitic languages, it is generally presumed that it had at least the vowels &quot;a&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, and &quot;u&quot;, which would have occurred both short and long &quot;ā&quot;, &quot;ī&quot;, and &quot;ū&quot;. In Old Sabaic, the long vowels &quot;ū&quot; and &quot;ī&quot; are sometimes indicated using the letters for &quot;w&quot; and &quot;y&quot; as matres lectionis. In the Old period this is used mainly in word-final position, but in Middle and Late Sabaic it also commonly occurs medially. Sabaic has no way of writing the long vowel &quot;ā&quot;, but in later inscriptions, in the Radmanite dialect the letter &quot;h&quot; is sometimes infixed in plurals where it is not etymologically expected: thus &quot;bnhy&quot; (&#x27;sons of&#x27;; constructive state) instead of the usual &quot;bny&quot;; it is suspected that this &quot;h&quot; represents the vowel &quot;ā&quot;. Long vowels &quot;ū&quot; and &quot;ī&quot; certainly seem to be indicated in forms such as the personal pronouns &quot;hmw&quot; (&#x27;them&#x27;), the verbal form &quot;ykwn&quot; (also written without the glide &quot;ykn&quot;; &#x27;he will be&#x27;), and in enclitic particles -&quot;mw&quot;, and -&quot;my&quot; probably used for emphasis.

=== Diphthongs ===
In the Old Sabaic inscriptions the Proto-Semitic diphthongs &quot;aw&quot; and &quot;ay&quot; seemed to have been retained, being written with the letters &quot;w&quot; and &quot;y&quot;; in the later stages the same words are increasingly found without these letters, which leads some scholars (such as Stein) to the conclusion that they had by then contracted to &quot;ō&quot; and &quot;ē&quot; (though &quot;aw&quot; → &quot;ū&quot; and &quot;ay&quot; → &quot;ī&quot; would also be possible)

=== Consonants ===
Sabaic, like Proto-Semitic, contains three sibilant phonemes, represented by distinct letters; the exact phonetic nature of these sounds is still uncertain. In the early days of Sabaic studies, Sayhadic was transcribed using Hebrew letters. The transcriptions of the alveolars or postvelar fricatives remained controversial; after a great deal of uncertainty in the initial period the lead was taken by the transcription chosen by Nikolaus Rhodokanakis and others for the Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum (&quot;s&quot;, &quot;š&quot;, and &quot;ś&quot;), until A. F. L. Beeston proposed replacing this with the representation with s followed by the subscripts 1–3. This latest version has largely taken over the English-speaking world, while in the German-speaking area, for example, the older transcription signs, which are also given in the table below, are more widespread. They were transcribed by Beeston as &quot;s1&quot;, &quot;s2&quot;, and &quot;s3&quot;. Bearing in mind the latest reconstructions of the Proto-Semitic sibilants, we can postulate that &quot;s1&quot; was probably pronounced as a simple [s] or [ʃ], &quot;s2&quot; was probably a lateral fricative [ɬ], and &quot;s3&quot; may have been realized as an affricate [t͡s]. The difference between the three sounds is maintained throughout Old Sabaic and Middle Sabaic, but in the Late period &quot;s1&quot; and &quot;s3&quot; merge. The subscript n did not start appearing until after the Early Sabaic period. The Middle Sabaic Haramitic dialect often shows the change &quot;s3&quot; &gt; &quot;s1&quot;, for example: &quot;ˀks1wt&quot; (&quot;clothes&quot;), normal Sabaic &quot;ks3wy&quot;.

The exact nature of the emphatic consonants &quot;q&quot;, &quot;ṣ&quot;, &quot;ṭ&quot;, &quot;ẓ&quot; and &quot;ḍ&quot; also remains a matter for debate: were they pharyngealized as in Modern Arabic, or were they glottalized as in Ethiopic (and reconstructed Proto-Semitic)? There are arguments to support both possibilities. In any case, beginning with Middle Sabaic the letters representing &quot;ṣ&quot; and &quot;ẓ&quot; are increasingly interchanged, which seems to indicate that they have fallen together as one phoneme. The existence of bilabial fricative &quot;f&quot; as a reflex of the Proto-Semitic &quot;*p&quot; is partly proved by Latin transcriptions of names. In late Sabaic &quot;ḏ&quot; and &quot;z&quot; also merge. In Old Sabaic the sound &quot;n&quot; only occasionally assimilates to a following consonant, but in the later periods this assimilation is the norm. The minuscule &quot;Zabūr&quot; script does not seem to have a letter that represents the sound &quot;ẓ&quot;, and replaces it with &quot;ḍ&quot; instead; for example &quot;mfḍr&quot; (&quot;a measure of capacity&quot;), written in the &quot;Musnad&quot; script as &quot;mfẓr&quot;.

=== Sabaic consonants ===
== Grammar ==

=== Personal pronouns ===
As in other Semitic languages Sabaic had both independent pronouns and pronominal suffixes. The attested pronouns, along with suffixes from Qatabanian and Hadramautic are as follows:
No independent pronouns have been identified in any of the other South Arabian languages. First- and second-person independent pronouns are rarely attested in the monumental inscription, but possibly for cultural reasons; the likelihood was that these texts were neither composed nor written by the one who commissioned them: hence they use third-person pronouns to refer to the one who is paying for the building and dedication or whatever. The use of the pronouns in Sabaic corresponds to that in other Semitic languages. The pronominal suffixes are added to verbs and prepositions to denote the object; thus: &quot;qtl-hmw&quot; &quot;he killed them&quot;; &quot;ḫmr-hmy t&#x27;lb&quot; &quot;Ta&#x27;lab poured for them both&quot;; when the suffixes are added to nouns they indicate possession: &quot;&#x27;bd-hw&quot; &quot;his slave&quot;).The independent pronouns serve as the subject of nominal and verbal sentences: &quot;mr&#x27; &#x27;t&quot; &quot;you are the Lord&quot; (a nominal sentence); &quot;hmw f-ḥmdw&quot; &quot;they thanked&quot; (a verbal sentence).

== Nouns ==

=== Case, number and gender ===
Sayhadic nouns fall into two genders: masculine and feminine. The feminine is usually indicated in the singular by the ending –&quot;t&quot; : &quot;bʿl&quot; &quot;husband&quot; (m.), &quot;bʿlt&quot; &quot;wife&quot; (f.), &quot;hgr&quot; &quot;city&quot; (m.), &quot;fnwt&quot; &quot;canal&quot; (f.). Sabaic nouns have forms for singular, dual and plural. The singular is formed without changing the stem, the plural can however be formed in a number of ways even in the very same word:
* Inner (&quot;Broken&quot;) Plurals: as in Classical Arabic they are frequent.
** &quot;ʾ&quot;-Prefix: &quot;ʾbyt&quot; &quot;houses&quot; from &quot;byt&quot; &quot;house&quot;
** &quot;t&quot;-Suffix: especially frequent in words having the &quot;m&quot;-prefix: &quot;mḥfdt&quot; &quot;towers&quot; from &quot;mḥfd&quot; &quot;tower&quot;.
** Combinations: for example &quot;ʾ&quot;–prefix and &quot;t&quot;-suffix: &quot;ʾḫrft&quot; &quot;years&quot; from &quot;ḫrf&quot; &quot;year&quot;, &quot;ʾbytt&quot; &quot;houses&quot; from &quot;byt&quot; &quot;house&quot;.
** without any external grammatical sign: &quot;fnw&quot; &quot;canals&quot; from &quot;fnwt&quot; (f.) &quot;canal&quot;.
** w-/y-Infix: &quot;ḫrwf&quot; / &quot;ḫryf&quot; / &quot;ḫryft&quot; &quot;years&quot; from &quot;ḫrf&quot; &quot;year&quot;.
** Reduplicational plurals are rarely attested in Sabaic: &quot;ʾlʾlt&quot; &quot;gods&quot; from&quot;ʾl&quot; &quot;god&quot;.
* External (&quot;Sound&quot;) plurals: in the masculine the ending differs according to the grammatical state (see below); in the feminine the ending is -&quot;(h)t&quot;, which probably represents *-āt; this plural is rare and seems to be restricted to a few nouns.
The dual is already beginning to disappear in Old Sabaic; its endings vary according to the grammatical state: &quot;ḫrf-n&quot; &quot;two years&quot; (indeterminate state) from &quot;ḫrf&quot; &quot;year&quot;.

Sabaic almost certainly had a case system formed by vocalic endings, but since vowels were involved they are not recognizable in the writings; nevertheless a few traces have been retained in the written texts, above all in the construct state.

== Grammatical states ==
As in other Semitic languages Sabaic has a few grammatical states, which are indicated by various different endings according to the gender and the number. At the same time external plurals and duals have their own endings for grammatical state, while inner plurals are treated like singulars. Apart from the construct state known in other Semitic languages, there is also an indeterminate state and a determinate state, the functions of which are explained below. The following are the detailed state endings:

The three grammatical states have distinct syntactical and semantic functions:
* The Status indeterminatus: marks an indefinite, unspecified thing : &quot;ṣlm-m&quot; &quot;any statue&quot;.
* The Status determinatus: marks a specific noun: &quot;ṣlm-n&quot; &quot;the statue&quot;.
* The Status constructus: is introduced if the noun is bound to a genitive, a personal suffix or — contrary to other Semitic languages — with a relative sentence:
** With a pronominal suffix: &quot;ʿbd-hw&quot; &quot;his slave&quot;.
** With a genitive noun: (Ḥaḑramite) &quot;gnʾhy myfʾt&quot; &quot;both walls of Maifa&#x27;at&quot;, &quot;mlky s1bʾ&quot; &quot;both kings of Saba&quot;
** With a relative sentence: &quot;kl 1 s1bʾt 2 w-ḍbyʾ 3 w-tqdmt&quot; 4 s1bʾy5 w-ḍbʾ6 tqdmn7 mrʾy-hmw8 &quot;all1 expeditions2, battles3 and raids4, their two lords 8 conducted5, struck6 and led7&quot; (the nouns in the construct state are italicized here).

== Verbs ==

=== Conjugation ===
As in other West Semitic languages Sabaic distinguishes between two types of finite verb forms: the perfect which is conjugated with suffixes and the imperfect which is conjugated with both prefixes and suffixes. In the imperfect two forms can be distinguished: a short form and a form constructed using the &quot;n&quot; (long form esp. the &quot;n-imperfect&quot;), which in any case is missing in Qatabānian and Ḥaḍramite. In actual use it is hard to distinguish the two imperfect forms from each other. The conjugation of the perfect and imperfect may be summarized as follows (the active and the passive are not distinguished in their consonantal written form; the verbal example is &quot;fʿl&quot; &quot;to do&quot;):

==== Perfect ====
The perfect is mainly used to describe something that took place in the past, only before conditional phrases and in relative phrases with a conditional connotation does it describe an action in the present, as in Classical Arabic. For example: &quot; w-s3ḫly Hlkʾmr w-ḥmʿṯt&quot; &quot;And Hlkʾmr and ḥmʿṯt have pleaded guilty (dual)&quot;.

==== Imperfect ====
The imperfect usually expresses that something has occurred at the same time as an event previously mentioned, or it may simply express the present or future. Four moods can be distinguished:
# Indicative: in Sabaic this has no special marker, though it has in some of the other languages: b-y-s2ṭ &quot;he trades&quot; (Qatabānian). With the meaning of the perfect: &quot;w-y-qr zydʾl b-wrḫh ḥtḥr&quot; &quot;Zaid&#x27;il died in the month of Hathor&quot; (Minaean).
# Precative is formed with &quot;l-&quot; and expresses wishes: &quot;w-l-y-ḫmrn-hw ʾlmqhw&quot; &quot;may Almaqahu grant him&quot;.
# Jussive is also formed with &quot;l-&quot; and stands for an indirect order: l-yʾt &quot;so should it come&quot;.
# Vetitive is formed with the negative &quot;ʾl&quot;. It serves to express negative wishes: &quot;w-ʾl y-hwfd ʿlbm&quot; &quot;and no ʿilb-trees may be planted here“.

=== Imperative ===
The imperative is found in texts written in the &quot;zabūr&quot; script on wooden sticks, and has the form &quot;fˁl(-n)&quot;. For example: &quot;w-&#x27;nt f-s3ḫln&quot; (&quot;and you (sg.) look after&quot;).

=== Derived stems ===
By changing the consonantal roots of verbs they can produce various derivational forms, which change their meaning. In Sabaic (and other Sahyadic languages) six such stems are attested. Examples:
* &quot;qny&quot; &quot;to receive&quot; &gt; &quot;hqny&quot; &quot;to sacrifice; to donate&quot;
* &quot;qwm&quot; &quot;to decree&quot; &gt; &quot;hqm&quot; &quot;to decree&quot;, &quot;tqwmw&quot; &quot;to bear witness&quot;

== Syntax ==

=== Position of clauses ===
The arrangement of clauses is not consistent in Sabaic. The first clause in an inscription always has the order (particle - ) subject – predicate (SV), the other main clauses of an inscription are introduced by &quot;w&quot;- &quot;and&quot; and always have – like subordinate clauses – the order predicate – subject (VS). At the same time the Predicate may be introduced by &quot;f&quot;.

Examples:


=== Subordinate clauses ===
Sabaic is equipped with a number of means to form subordinate clauses using various conjunctions:

==== Relative clauses ====
In Sabaic, relative clauses are marked by a Relativiser like &quot;ḏ-&quot;, &quot;ʾl&quot;, &quot;mn-&quot;; in free relative clauses this marking is obligatory. Unlike other Semitic languages in Sabaic resumptive pronouns are only rarely found.



== Vocabulary ==
Although the Sabaic vocabulary is found in relatively diverse types of inscriptions (an example being that the south Semitic tribes derive their word &quot;wtb&quot; meaning &quot;to sit&quot; from the northwest tribe&#x27;s word &quot;yashab/wtb&quot; meaning &quot;to jump&quot;), nevertheless it stands relatively isolated in the Semitic realm, something that makes it more difficult to analyze. Even given the existence of closely related languages such as Ge&#x27;ez and Classical Arabic, only part of the Sabaic vocabulary has proved able to be interpreted; a not inconsiderable part must be deduced from the context and some words remain incomprehensible. On the other hand, many words from agriculture and irrigation technology have been retrieved from the works of Yemeni scholars of the Middle Ages and partially also from the modern Yemeni dialects. Foreign loanwords are rare in Sabaic, a few Greek and Aramaic words are found in the Rahmanistic, Christian and Jewish period (5th–7th centuries AD) for example: &quot;qls1-n&quot; from the Greek ἐκκλησία &quot;church&quot;, which still survives in the Arabic &quot;al-Qillīs&quot; referring to the church built by Abrahah in Sana&#x27;a.

<doc id="1199090" wikidata="Q454529" url="?curid=1199090" title="Harold W. Kuhn">
<text>Harold William Kuhn (July 29, 1925 – July 2, 2014) was an American mathematician who studied game theory. He won the 1980 John von Neumann Theory Prize jointly with David Gale and Albert W. Tucker. A former Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at Princeton University, he is known for the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, for Kuhn&#x27;s theorem, and for developing Kuhn poker. He described the Hungarian method for the assignment problem, but a paper by Carl Gustav Jacobi, published posthumously in 1890 in Latin, was later discovered that had described the Hungarian method a century before Kuhn.

== Life ==
Kuhn was born in Santa Monica in 1925. He is known for his association with John Forbes Nash, as a fellow graduate student, a lifelong friend and colleague, and a key figure in getting Nash the attention of the Nobel Prize committee that led to Nash&#x27;s 1994 Nobel Prize in Economics. Kuhn and Nash both had long associations and collaborations with Albert W. Tucker, who was Nash&#x27;s dissertation advisor. Kuhn co-edited &quot;The Essential John Nash&quot;, and is credited as the mathematics consultant in the 2001 movie adaptation of Nash&#x27;s life, &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;.

Harold Kuhn served as the third president of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM). He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences.

In 1949, he married Estelle Henkin, sister of logician Leon Henkin. His oldest son was oral historian Clifford Kuhn (1952-2015), an associate professor at Georgia State University noted for his scholarship on the American South. Another son, Nicholas Kuhn, is a professor of mathematics at the University of Virginia. His youngest son, Jonathan Kuhn, is Director of Art and Antiquities for the New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation.

Kuhn died on July 2, 2014.

<doc id="1199099" wikidata="Q3133536" url="?curid=1199099" title="Well to Hell">
<text>The &quot;Well to Hell&quot;, also known as the &quot;Siberian hell sounds&quot;, is an urban legend regarding a putative borehole in the Siberian region of Russia, which was purportedly drilled so deep that it broke through into Hell. It was first attested in English as a 1989 broadcast by an American domestic TV broadcaster, the Trinity Broadcasting Network.

==Legend and basis==
The legend holds that a team of Soviet engineers purportedly led by an individual named &quot;Mr. Azakov&quot; in an unnamed place in Siberia had drilled a hole that was deep before breaking through to a cavity. Intrigued by this unexpected discovery, they lowered an extremely heat-tolerant microphone, along with other sensory equipment, into the well. The temperature deep within was , heat from a chamber of fire from which screaming could be heard.

The Soviet Union had, in fact, drilled a hole more than deep, the Kola Superdeep Borehole, located not in Siberia but on the Kola Peninsula, which shares borders with Norway and Finland. Upon reaching the depth of in 1989, geological anomalies were found, although they reported no supernatural encounters. The recording of &quot;tormented screams&quot; was later found to be looped together from various sound effects, sometimes identified as the soundtrack of the 1972 movie &quot;Baron Blood&quot;.

==Propagation==
The story was reported to first have been published by the Finnish newspaper &quot;Ammennusastia&quot;, a journal published by a group of Pentecostal Christians from , a village in the municipality of Siikainen in Western Finland. Rich Buhler, who interviewed the editors, found that the story had been based on recollections of a letter printed in the feature section of a newspaper called &quot;Etelä Suomen&quot; (possibly the &quot;Etelä-Suomen Sanomat&quot;). When contacting the letter&#x27;s author, Buhler found that he had drawn from a story appearing in a Finnish Christian newsletter named &quot;Vaeltajat&quot;, which had printed the story in July 1989. The newsletter&#x27;s editor claimed that its origin had been a newsletter called &quot;Jewels of Jericho&quot;, published by a group of Messianic Jews in California. Here, Buhler stopped tracing the origins any further.

American tabloids soon ran the story, and sound files began appearing on various sites across the Internet. Sensational retellings of the legend can be found on YouTube, usually featuring the aforementioned &quot;Baron Blood&quot; sound effects.

===TBN involvement===
The story eventually made its way to the American Christian Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), which broadcast it on the network, claiming it to be proof of the literal existence of Hell.

Åge Rendalen, a Norwegian teacher, heard the story on TBN while visiting the United States. Disgusted with what he perceived to be mass gullibility, Rendalen decided to augment the tale at TBN&#x27;s expense.

Rendalen wrote to the network, originally claiming that he disbelieved the tale but, upon his return to Norway, supposedly read a factual account of the story. According to Rendalen, the story claimed not only that the cursed well was real, but that a bat-like apparition (a common pictorial representation of demons, such as in Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;The Torment of Saint Anthony&quot; or the more recent Bat Boy by &quot;Weekly World News&quot;) had risen out of it before blazing a trail across the Russian sky. To perpetuate his hoax, Rendalen deliberately mistranslated a trivial Norwegian article about a local building inspector into the story, and submitted both the original Norwegian article and the English &quot;translation&quot; to TBN. Rendalen also included his real name, phone number, and address, as well as those of a pastor friend who knew about the hoax and had agreed to expose it to anyone who called seeking verification.

However, TBN did nothing to verify Rendalen&#x27;s claims, and aired the story as proof of the validity of the original story.

==Alternative versions==
Since its publicity, many alternative versions of the Well to Hell story have been published. In 1992, the U.S. tabloid &quot;Weekly World News&quot; published an alternative version of the story, which was set in Alaska where thirteen miners were killed after Satan came roaring out of Hell.

<doc id="1199100" wikidata="Q1117561" url="?curid=1199100" title="Unglued">
<text>Unglued is a expansion set, the first satirical, non-tournament-legal expansion set released. It came out in August 1998. Its symbol is a cracked egg. Among the themes of the set were chicken, dice rolling and multiplayer Magic games.

==History==
&quot;Unglued&quot; was originally conceived by then-lead Magic designer Joel Mick and fellow designer Bill Rose. Having helped in the creation of many of the expansion sets of the time, they began talking about cards which were cut from the expansion or were unplayable, based on the rules of the game. Thinking this through, they conceptualized an expansion where all the cards had no place in serious games.

&quot;Unglued&quot; was not entirely a commercially successful expansion, but the unique basic land cards - the only cards from the set legal in tournaments - were and still are valuable. The set also developed a cult following among casual Magic fans, and four sequel sets have been released since, &quot;Unhinged&quot; in 2004, &quot;Unstable&quot; in 2017, &quot;Unsanctioned&quot;in 2020, and &quot;Unfinity&quot; in 2022.

==Unglued secret message==
Each of the 94 cards in the &quot;Unglued&quot; set had a single word printed on the bottom of the card. Alone these single words made little or no sense but when combined in proper numerical order with other cards in the series spell out the following secret message:

&quot;Here are some cards that didn&#x27;t make it to print: Socks of Garfield, Hot Monkey Love, Colonel&#x27;s Secret Recipe, Squee&#x27;s Play, Banned in France, Spoon, Disrobing Scepter, Butt Wolf, Lotus Roach, Sesame Efreet, Needless Reminder Text, Chicken Choker, Clockwork Doppelganger, Henway, HELP I&#x27;M TRAPPED IN CARTA MUNDI, Mad Cow, Poke, Lord of Wombats, Gratuitous Babe Art, Brothers&#x27; War Bonds, Dwarven Kickboxer, Mickey&#x27;s Drunk, Pact with the Wastes, CoP:BO, Urza&#x27;s Chia Pet, Thallid Shooter, Shoelace, When Chihuahuas Attack, Wall of Cookies, Kobold Ninja, Mucusaur, Kjeldoran Outhouse, Bear in the Woods, Dental Thrull, Flavatog, Cereal Killer.&quot;

==Flavor Text==
The flavor texts of the cards Double Dip, Double Play, Double Deal, Double Take, and Double Cross form the following limerick:

In a duel and taking a lickin&#x27;...
The wizard exclaimed, &quot;I&#x27;m no chicken...&quot;
&quot;I&#x27;m facing defeat...&quot;
&quot;But the next time we meet...&quot;
&quot;You&#x27;re in for a nasty butt kickin&#x27;.&quot;

Which fit the mechanics of the cards, as all five not only did something for the player when played, but also created a benefit for the player during their next game against the same opponent.

<doc id="1199102" wikidata="Q7574832" url="?curid=1199102" title="Special master">
<text>In the law of the United States, a special master is an official appointed by a judge to ensure judicial orders are followed, or in the alternative, to hear evidence on behalf of the judge and make recommendations to the judge as to the disposition of a matter. The special master should not be confused with the traditional common law concept of a master, a judge of the High Court entrusted to deal with summary and administrative matters falling short of a full trial.

In the federal judiciary of the United States, a special master is an adjunct to a federal court. Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows a federal court to appoint a special master, with the consent of the parties, to conduct proceedings and report to the Court.

==Role==
The role of the special master, who is frequently but not necessarily an attorney, is to supervise those falling under the order of the court to ensure that the court order is being followed and to report on the activities of the entity being supervised in a timely matter to the judge or the judge&#x27;s designated representatives. Special masters have been controversial in some cases, and are cited by critics as an example of judicial overreach. For example, special masters have at times ordered the expenditure of funds over and above the amount appropriated by a legislative body for the remediation of the situation being examined. Their powers have generally been found to be valid and their remedies upheld by US courts.

The US Supreme Court will normally assign original jurisdiction disputes (cases such as disputes between states that are first heard at the Supreme Court level) to a special master to conduct what amounts to a trial: the taking of evidence and a ruling. The Supreme Court can then assess the master&#x27;s ruling much as a normal appeals court would, rather than conduct the trial itself. That is necessary as trials in the US almost always involve live testimony, and it would be too unwieldy for nine justices to rule on evidentiary objections in real time.

In United States federal courts, special masters are appointed under Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 53 allows for a special master to be appointed only if one of the following exists: (1) the parties consent to the appointment, (2) to hold a trial without a jury or make recommended findings of fact where there is some exceptional condition or accounting or difficult computation of damages, or (3) address pre-trial or post-trial matters that cannot be effectively and timely addressed by a judge or magistrate judge.

==Examples==
*Special masters were appointed by US District Court Judge Thomas Whitfield Davidson to investigate allegations of voter fraud on behalf of the 1948 Democratic Party primary campaign for Lyndon B. Johnson to the US Senate. According to Robert A. Caro, the masters would have found that Johnson&#x27;s 86-vote victory was delivered by hundreds of fraudulent ballots, but the investigation was halted by the US Supreme Court on the grounds that the Democratic Party, not the federal government, was responsible for its primary elections.
*The usage of special masters in matters involving complex electronic discovery (or &quot;eDiscovery&quot;) has been promulgated by the Academy of Court Appointed Masters (ACAM).
*The United States Court of Federal Claims operates an Office of Special Masters, informally known as the vaccine court, to resolve claims under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act.
*Cases involving special masters often involve situations in which it has been shown that governmental entities are violating civil rights. High-profile cases in recent years in which special masters have been used include some in which states have been ordered to upgrade their prison facilities, which were held to violate the US Constitution, which bars cruel and unusual punishment and certain state mental hospitals, which have been found so substandard as to violate the rights of their inmates. Summaries of cases involving special masters are published at &quot;Cohen&#x27;s Special Master Case Reporter&quot;.
*Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig was appointed special master in the Microsoft antitrust case, but was recalled after objections from Microsoft.
*In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft appointed Kenneth Feinberg as special master to oversee the dispensation of an $11 billion victims&#x27; compensation fund.
*The &quot;Waymo v. Uber&quot; lawsuit saw Judge William Alsup appoint a special master to determine whether Uber violated discovery rules in not disclosing the &quot;Richard Jacobs letter.&quot;

===&quot;Trump v. United States&quot;===
On August 22, 2022, in the wake of the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, the residence of former US President Donald Trump, Trump demanded the appointment of a &quot;neutral&quot; special master to review the highly sensitive documents seized during the execution of the search warrant for potential attorney–client privilege. Federal District Court judge Aileen Cannon, before whom the matter was set to be argued, expressed she was likely to agree. On September 5, 2022 Cannon granted the request, which was appealed by the Department of Justice on September 8, on the grounds that &quot;[this] order would irreparably harm the government and the public by unnecessarily requiring the government to share highly classified materials with a special master&quot;.

On September 12, the DOJ approved one of Trump&#x27;s nominees, Raymond J. Dearie, for the special master role. Dearie&#x27;s objectivity in this case was also questioned by news reports about the controversial role of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, of which Dearie was a member, during the FBI surveillance of Carter Page in the Crossfire Hurricane affair; according to insider sources, Trump&#x27;s lawyers and advisers have purportedly expressed hope that Dearie has since become &quot;a deep skeptic of the FBI&quot;.

However, soon after Dearie&#x27;s appointment, frictions ensued when Trump&#x27;s legal team did not provide proof of Trump&#x27;s actually having declassified the documents, as he has repeatedly claimed to justify their presence at Mar-a-Lago, despite Dearie&#x27;s requests. Instead, Dearie declared that if the Justice Department made &quot;an acceptable case that they remain classified, then he would be inclined to regard them as classified&quot; and thus not eligible for returning them to Trump&#x27;s possession. Likewise, Dearie demanded proof of Trump&#x27;s false claims that certain documents were &quot;planted&quot; by the FBI during the raid. Legal experts believed Trump&#x27;s demand for a special master was a strategic error, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

On September 29, Cannon ruled that Trump allegedly did not have to present evidence to the claim that the FBI had &quot;planted&quot; evidence against him, claiming, &quot;There shall be no separate requirement on Plaintiff at this stage, prior to the review of any of the seized materials. … The Court’s Appointment Order did not contemplate that obligation,&quot; and extended the deadline for the files&#x27; review from November 30 to December 16, drawing widespread criticism from legal experts. 

On October 8, 2022, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Trump had told advisers he retained the documents found by the FBI at Mar-a-Lago with the intention of pressuring the National Archives and Records Administration into trading them for files he thought would prove his claims that any Russian interference during the election was a &quot;hoax&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haberman_Smith_10/8/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On October 14, the DOJ filed a request with a federal appeals court to end the special master review, calling it &quot;unwarranted&quot; since &quot;[the] plaintiff has no plausible claim of executive privilege [...] and no plausible claim of personal attorney-client privilege&quot;. Dearie himself also expressed a similar assessment.

On December 1, 2022, the federal appeals court reversed the special master review, stating in a clear rebuke against Trump, &quot;The law is clear. We cannot write a rule that allows any subject of a search warrant to block government investigations after the execution of the warrant. Nor can we write a rule that allows only former presidents to do so.&quot;

<text>Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (acronym PDVSA, ) (English: Petroleum of Venezuela) is the Venezuelan state-owned oil and natural gas company. It has activities in exploration, production, refining and exporting oil as well as exploration and production of natural gas. Since its founding on January 1, 1976, with the nationalization of the Venezuelan oil industry, PDVSA has dominated the oil industry of Venezuela, the world&#x27;s fifth largest oil exporter.

Oil reserves in Venezuela are the largest in the world and the state-owned PDVSA provides the government of Venezuela with substantial funding resources. Following the Bolivarian Revolution, PDVSA was mainly used as a vital source of income for the Venezuelan government. Profits were also used to assist the presidency, with funds directed towards allies of the Venezuelan government. With PDVSA focusing on political projects instead of oil production, mechanical and technical statuses deteriorated while employee expertise was removed following thousands of politically motivated firings. Incompetence within the company has led to serious inefficiencies and accidents and to endemic corruption; at least US$11 billion was stolen between 2004 and 2015. Jorge Giordani, minister of planning until in 2014, estimates that $300 billion was simply stolen. In 2018 thousands of workers left PDVSA, especially after the company was put under military control.

==Reserves and capacity==

As of 2003, Venezuela had of conventional oil reserves according to PDVSA figures, the largest in the Western Hemisphere and making up approximately half the total. This puts Venezuela as fifth in the world in proven reserves of conventional oil. By also including an estimated of tar-like extra heavy crude oil in the Orinoco Belt region, Venezuela claims to hold the largest hydrocarbon reserves in the world. Venezuela also has of natural gas reserves. The crude oil PDVSA extracts from the Orinoco is refined into a fuel eponymously named &#x27;Orimulsion&#x27;.

PDVSA has a production capacity, including the strategic associations and operating agreements, of per day (600,000 m3). Officials say production is around although most secondary sources such as OPEC and the EIA put Venezuela&#x27;s output at least lower.

During the presidency of Hugo Chávez the organization&#x27;s payroll tripled, while oil production fell steeply, a drop of 700,000 barrels per day. Soaring oil prices began in 2002 and peaked in 2008 at $147 per barrel.

==Politicization==

In 2002, many PDVSA employees went on strike against the policies of Chávez, who in response fired over 19,000 workers from the company. As of 2014, Intevep, the research and development arm of PDVSA, reportedly lost 80% of its workers, severely damaging PDVSA&#x27;s ability to innovate and compete in the global petroleum market. PDVSA saw stagnant growth in the following era which was defined by a boom in oil prices. Between 2002 and 2012, incapacitating injuries to employees rose from 1.8 per million man hours to 6.2, extremely high compared to 0.6 per million man hours for Pemex in 2012, highlighting the company&#x27;s struggle to optimize. Several former PDVSA employees moved to Alberta, where the oil consistency was similar to that of the Orinoco. As a result, the number of Venezuelans in Alberta has risen from 465 in 2001 to 3,860 in 2011. Other PDVSA workers migrated to Colombia, joined Ecopetrol, and were credited with helping the company attain huge profits throughout the 2010s.

In 2006, Rafael Ramírez, the energy minister, gave PDVSA workers a choice: Support President Hugo Chávez, or lose their jobs. The minister also said: &quot;PDVSA is red [the color identified with Chávez&#x27;s political party], red from top to bottom&quot;. Chávez defended Ramírez, saying that public workers should back the &quot;revolution&quot;. He added that &quot;PDVSA&#x27;s workers are with this revolution, and those who aren&#x27;t should go somewhere else. Go to Miami&quot;. In 2012, PDVSA focused in hiring only supporters of the president and PDVSA revenue was used to fund Venezuela&#x27;s socialist &quot;revolution&quot;.

==History==

===1970s: Nationalization===
Under the presidency of Carlos Andrés Pérez, whose economic plan, &quot;La Gran Venezuela&quot;, called for the nationalization of the oil industry, Venezuela officially nationalized its oil industry on 1 January 1976 at the site of Zumaque oilwell 1 (Mene Grande). This was the birth of Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). All foreign oil companies that once did business in Venezuela were replaced by Venezuelan companies, such as Lagoven (Standard Oil), Maraven (Shell), and Llavonen (Mobil). Each of the former concessionaires was simply substituted by a new &#x27;national&#x27; oil company, which maintained the structures and functions of its multi-national corporation (MNC) predecessor. With the 1976 nationalization, each previous multinational operator was converted into an affiliate of PDVSA; these affiliates were grouped into an administrative structure underneath both PDVSA and the Venezuelan Ministry of Energy. With this absorption, PDVSA became the employer of engineers with comprehensive technical training from the old multinational corporations and promptly took advantage of their newfound expertise. Within 25 years of nationalization, PDVSA would become the largest company in Latin America and the tenth most profitable in the world. In that 25-year span they went from 18 billion barrels to over 80 billion barrels worth of oil reserves, with a similar increase in production capacity.

===1980s–1990s: &quot;Apertura&quot;===
In the 1990s, Venezuela opened the company to global cooperation. The opening up of the Venezuelan oil industry, or &quot;Apertura&quot;, was initialized with a Venezuelan Supreme Court decision which removed older laws prohibiting cooperation with multi-national corporations on Venezuelan land. From 1993 through 1998, PDVSA split extraction rights with multiple multi-national companies in special arrangements called &quot;strategic associations&quot;, in effect trading Venezuelan crude oil for the efficiency that came from outside expertise and technology. These &quot;strategic associations&quot; were controversial: Venezuela was able to maximize profits at the cost of lenient taxation on the multinational companies and the loss of control over domestic resources. With Chávez&#x27;s election in 1998, Venezuela&#x27;s attention became increasingly focused on complying with OPEC. As oil prices collapsed in the late 1990s, however, keeping the special arrangements while conforming to OPEC regulations became impossible, leading to an end of the &quot;Apertura&quot; arrangements for Venezuela.

Before the election of Hugo Chávez, PDVSA ran autonomously, making oil decisions based on internal guidance to increase profits. Chávez, once he came to power, started directing PDVSA and effectively turned it into a direct government arm whose profits would be injected into social spending. The result of this was the creation of &quot;Bolivarian Missions&quot;, oil funded social programs targeting poverty, illiteracy, hunger, and more. With the &quot;Apertura,&quot; PDVSA many of its managers become active in Venezuelan politics and served as national representatives in economic summits. Chávez continued this trend, further incorporating PDVSA into the government&#x27;s structure, but made social welfare the priority. During his campaign, Chávez repeatedly said that PDVSA was previously too autonomous and powerful, and that its managers acted subversively to Venezuela. Chávez turned the post-&quot;Apertura&quot; PDVSA into a political rallying point for his mostly lower-class supporters by associating its &quot;Apertura&quot; liberalization policies with the country&#x27;s ruling groups, energizing his working class supporters against the companies former special arrangements. In 1998, PDVSA produced 3.4 million barrels of oil a day and had 40,000 employees. By law, it deposited its revenues in the sovereign fund accounts in the Central Bank of Venezuela.

===2000–2010: Social spending===

In December 2002, the Venezuelan general strike of 2002-2003 saw many of PDVSA&#x27;s managers and employees, including the CTV trade union federation, join to pressure Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez to call early elections, and virtually stop oil production for two months. Nearly 19,000 employees, most of them seasoned professionals, were summarily dismissed, and production resumed with employees loyal to the government. The International Labour Organization (ILO) called on the Venezuelan government to launch &quot;an independent investigation into allegations of detention and torture,&quot; surrounding this strike. The company has since formed its own militia, which all employees join on a voluntary basis, to ward off a potential &quot;coup&quot; by the government. It considers itself virtually indistinguishable from the state, its social programs more or less running the country&#x27;s &quot;socialist revolution&quot;.

In 2005, PDVSA opened its first office in China, and announced plans to nearly triple its fleet of oil tankers, to 58. In April and May 2005, PDVSA, per an agreement signed between the governments of Venezuela and Argentina, sent 50 million tonnes of fuel oil to the latter to alleviate the effects of an energy crisis due to a shortage of natural gas.

In November 2005, PDVSA and its subsidiary in the United States, Citgo, announced an agreement with Massachusetts to provide heating oil to low income families in Boston at a discount of 40% below market price. Similar agreements were later set up with other states and cities in the US Northeast, including New York&#x27;s Bronx, Maine, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Delaware. Under the program, Citgo offered a total of around of heating oil at below market prices, equivalent to a discount of between 60 and 80 cents a gallon.

On July 28, 2006, credit ratings agency Moody&#x27;s Investor Service said it was removing its standalone ratings on PDVSA because the oil company did not provide adequate operational and financial information. As of 2019, PDVSA had still not filed its 2004 financial results with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that were due in June 2005.

During the 2000s, PDVSA carried out showcase projects in shanty towns and waste removal.

In 2008, PDVSA had been Latin America&#x27;s largest company, but in 2009 it was overtaken by Petrobras and Pemex, according to a ranking of the region&#x27;s top 500 companies from Latin Business Chronicle.

====2007 expropriations====
In 2007, PDVSA bought 82% percent of Electricidad de Caracas company from AES Corporation as part of a renationalization program. Subsequently, the ownership share rose to 93.62% by December 2008. Assets of ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips were expropriated in 2007 after they declined to restructure their holdings in Venezuela to give PDVSA majority control; Total, Chevron, Statoil and BP agreed and retained minority shares in their Venezuelan projects. Reaching a settlement with ExxonMobil proved difficult; Venezuela offered book value for ExxonMobil&#x27;s assets, while ExxonMobil asked for as much as $12 billion. As of January 2012, this and the claims of ConocoPhillips remained before the World Bank&#x27;s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.

In February 2012, PDVSA paid $255 million to ExxonMobil in compensation for nationalization of ExxonMobil&#x27;s Venezuelan assets in 2007 and $420 million to be paid beginning in 2012 to US firms Williams Cos Inc. and Exterran Holdings, Inc for natural gas assets nationalized in 2009.

During the same time, oil executives and politicians siphoned off at least $11 billion. More than 24 Venezuelans linked to four corruption schemes amassed at least $273 million in 25 Credit Suisse accounts opened between 2004 and 2015.

===2010s: crisis in Venezuela, corruption===

In 2010, PDVSA loaned the government of Antigua $68 million to repurchase all remaining shares of West Indies Oil Company (WIOC) from Bruce Rappaport&#x27;s National Petroleum Ltd.

In 2012, PDVSA announced that it would enter into a joint venture agreement with Eni SpA and Repsol in order to initiate a gas production project at the Cardon VI gas block in Venezuela. Production from this joint venture is estimated to reach between 80 and 100 million cubic meters of gas. In February 2014, PDVSA and the Anglo-French oil firm Perenco entered into talks for a $600 million financing deal to boost production at their Petrowarao joint venture. In October 2014, Venezuela imported its first ever ship of oil from Algeria so that they could dilute their oil.

Policies enacted by Chávez caused a crisis in Venezuela, with the nation&#x27;s economy deteriorating greatly. Because of the hyperinflation and food shortage, paychecks have become all but valueless, leading to mass resignation from workers. By 2017, PDVSA could not even afford to export oil through international waters, which requires safety inspections and cleaning under maritime law, with a fleet of tankers stranded in the Caribbean Sea due to the issue. In addition, Nicolás Maduro fired the head of PDVSA and replaced him with Major General Manuel Quevedo, placating the military by giving them control of PDVSA. The developments resulted in a fragmented corporate structure and not enough workers to keep certain rigs operating continuously. By the end of 2013, Venezuela produced 1.2 million barrels of oil per day from the Orinoco, falling short of its target of 1.5 million barrels. The repeated poor performances of PDVSA were heavily linked to Venezuela&#x27;s current hyperinflation crisis. In order to correct for these shortcomings, Maduro installed more Venezuelan military members in several key PDVSA positions, in an effort to reduce the corruption and inefficiency.

Between 1999 and 2017, PDVSA earned an estimated $635 billion in revenue and produced an additional $406 billion worth of oil. Production dropped further, to half of its 1998 benchmark. Accountability for the funds was no longer required and Jorge Giordani, minister of planning until in 2014, estimates that $300 billion was simply stolen. Despite having some of the largest proven oil reserves in the world, in June 2018 PDVSA&#x27;s actions grew more desperate as they began to import and refine foreign crude oil for the first time in the country&#x27;s history so they could meet export demands. Oil production had also slowed to levels not seen since the 1950s due to economic and management difficulties.

During the government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, Raúl Morodo served as the Spanish Ambassador to Venezuela. In a legal case that garnered significant media attention, Morodo and his son, Alejo Morodo, admitted to receiving payments from the Venezuelan state oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), through &quot;simulated operations.&quot; These payments were allegedly exchanged for fictitious consultancy and advisory services, amounting to at least €4.5 million. The Morodos utilized a network of companies—Aequitas Abogadosy Consultores Asociados, S.L., Furnival Barristers Corp, S.A., and Morodo Abogados y Asociados, S.L.—to facilitate these transactions, which were designed to defraud the Spanish tax authorities by creating the appearance of legitimate business operations. The companies in question lacked substantial physical presence, infrastructure, and genuine business activities, serving primarily to issue invoices and transfer funds directly to Raúl Morodo’s personal account at Banco de Sabadell. In 2014, Raúl Morodo acknowledged committing at least one fiscal offense, resulting in a conviction to a ten-month prison sentence and fines totaling €1.4 million, to be paid jointly with his son. Alejo Morodo received a separate sentence of twenty-four months of imprisonment and is responsible for the majority of the fines due to his role in managing the instrumental companies. The case, initially involving allegations of money laundering and political corruption linked to Morodo’s diplomatic relations with high-ranking Venezuelan officials such as Delcy Rodríguez, was later downgraded by the Audiencia Nacional to focus solely on tax evasion. Negotiations between the Morodos and the &quot;Fiscalía Anticorrupción&quot; (Anti-Corruption Prosecutor&#x27;s Office) have led to a settlement agreement, wherein the Morodos have agreed to repay the defrauded amounts and acknowledge their crimes in exchange for reduced sentencing recommendations. The &quot;Sindicato Manos Limpias&quot; has also participated in the proceedings, advocating for harsher penalties, including eight and a half years for Alejo Morodo and three and a half years for Raúl Morodo. The settlement was publicly disclosed by the newspaper &quot;EL MUNDO&quot;, highlighting the extensive measures taken to address the fiscal and ethical violations committed by the Morodo family.

Since 2015, a US Justice Department investigation into PDVSA corruption resulted in 12 guilty pleas pertaining to a bribery scheme between PDVSA and its contractors. The scheme involved members within the company who would insure favorable treatment of vendors in exchange for kickbacks. For example, in 2015, Roberto Enrique Rincon was arrested and in 2016 pleaded guilty to bribery and tax evasion in a scheme to secure energy contracts. In 2016, he was described as having built &quot;36 maletín-based companies with intractable nested ownership structures&quot;. These actions violated the US&#x27;s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and were classified as conspiracy to commit money laundering. The 2022 Suisse secrets data leak found seven people had Credit Suisse accounts, which at their maximum held a total of at least 20.1 million Swiss francs.

In May 2017, Goldman Sachs purchased $2.8 billion of PDVSA 2022 bonds from the Central Bank of Venezuela.

In August 2017, President Donald Trump&#x27;s administration imposed economic sanctions against PDVSA that restricted the industry&#x27;s access to credit markets.

With the prospects of Maduro leaving power in early 2019 confidence saw an assessable increase in the nation, with tangible financial benefits like an increase in value of bonds for PDVSA, the country&#x27;s major oil and gas company, which went up 5% in January 2019.

===2020s===
In 2020, Maduro created a committee to restructure PDVSA.
In September 2021, a U.S. trial began about PDVSA owing $150 million to Siemens Energy, which PDVSA said it could not pay because of U.S. sanctions.
By 2023, PDVSA had not paid bills for $21.2 billion; Maduro suspended the committee and replaced oil minister Tareck El Aissami with Pedro Rafael Tellechea. According to Attorney General Tarek Saab, 51 people were detained.

== Ownership of Citgo ==

In 1986, PDVSA bought 50% of the United States gasoline brand Citgo from Southland Corporation and in 1990 the remaining half. With full ownership of Citgo, PDVSA at its peak controlled 10% of the US domestic oil market, creating a lucrative export chain from Venezuelan soil to American consumers, as the two largest buyers of Venezuelan petroleum are the United States and China, respectively.

In 2013, despite dwindling performance, PDVSA was able to add Russia&#x27;s Rosneft as an extraction partner, anticipating to extract 2.1 million barrels of petroleum per day. With the onset of the Crisis in Venezuela, the country borrowed 1.5 billion dollars from Russia, offering 49.9% of PDVSA&#x27;s share in Citgo as collateral.

In October 2018, PDVSA paid $949 million on its Citgo backed bond to investors, a payment many analysts thought was impossible for the company given its recent liquidity struggles. The payment meant that PDVSA would continue to own Citgo, but failure to pay would result in Citgo transferring ownership to one of PDVSA&#x27;s creditors. Losing Citgo would be disastrous for PDVSA, as they would lose the key terminal of their export chain to the US and the chemical additives necessary for oil refinery that Citgo produces. The loss would wreak additional havoc on Venezuela&#x27;s economy, drying up the revenue stream that provides 90% of the government&#x27;s hard-currency earnings. In April 2019 the next payment was due and at the time, PDVSA was completely insolvent, with the rest of their $60 billion debt. Canadian mining firm Crystallex was another creditor of PDVSA&#x27;s Citgo holdings and could potentially end up in control should PDVSA default in 2020. Crystallex, through a US court case, had already received an undisclosed amount of Citgo shares in compensation for Venezuela&#x27;s 2008 nationalization of their mines. A separate Canadian mining firm, Rusoro, was also pursuing $1.28 billion in repayment for the prior nationalization of its assets, through the US justice system until PDVSA begins making payments.

In October 2019, Juan Guaidó filed a lawsuit in the US to invalidate the PDVSA 2020 bonds.
In January 2022, the US Treasury extended a rule to shield Citgo from being seized by creditors, and in April 2023 it extended it for another 3 months.

==Safety==
There have been worsening safety problems since 2003, culminating in a gas leak at the Paraguaná Refinery Complex in August 2012 which caused an explosion, killing 48 people and damaging 1600 homes. A lightning strike caused a fire at the refinery in September 2012.

<doc id="1199124" wikidata="Q4938352" url="?curid=1199124" title="Boilerplate (robot)">
<text>Boilerplate is a fictional robot which would have existed in the Victorian era and early 20th century. It was created in 2000 by Portland, Oregon USA artist Paul Guinan. Originally intended for comics, the character became known via a faux-historical website created by Guinan, and has since appeared in other media.

== Development ==
Boilerplate was originally featured on a website created by Paul Guinan in 2000. The Boilerplate site details the history of a remarkable robot built in the late 19th century, and features photoshopped &quot;archival images&quot; in which Boilerplate (actually a 12-inch articulated model) is seen interacting with historical figures, such as Teddy Roosevelt and Pancho Villa. Becoming aware that some visitors to the site were taken in by its contents, making it an unintentional hoax, Guinan resolved to see how authentic he could make the character seem, working to ensure the descriptions of non-fictional events were accurate. He explained his motivation in a 2002 interview

&quot;Certainly I felt happy about having achieved my goal,&quot; he said. &quot;I put this thing across as trying to be real, and people bought into it. So, that&#x27;s a success! But, as an amateur historian, I feel a responsibility to get the story right. So I felt bad about some of these people being hoaxed. It was a mixed bag.&quot;

&quot;But,&quot; he revealed, &quot;I thought, if I was getting this reaction and I wasn&#x27;t really trying, then what would happen if I really tried?&quot;

Guinan estimated that roughly a third of the site&#x27;s visitors treated its faux history as real. Comedian Chris Elliott, while realising that Boilerplate was fictional, thought that the spoof dated back to the 19th century and included the character in one of his books (see below).

Guinan later expanded his website into &quot;The History of Robots in the Victorian Era&quot;, which features other &quot;turn-of-the-century robots, both real and imagined&quot;.

== Fictional character history ==
Boilerplate is built by Professor Archibald Campion in the 1880s and unveiled at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The robot&#x27;s notable adventures include an expedition to the Antarctic, during which it saves the lives of the team members by singlehandedly moving ice floes, clearing a path for the ship to sail out.

Designed for the self-proclaimed purpose of &quot;preventing the deaths of men in the conflicts of nations,&quot; Boilerplate charges into combat during the Spanish–American War and the Boxer Rebellion. Campion and his robot also circle the planet with the U.S. Navy, make silent movies, and hobnob with the likes of Mark Twain and Nikola Tesla.

Boilerplate is also active in the First World War, but disappears during the relief of Major Whittlesey&#x27;s Lost Battalion, possibly having been captured by the Germans for study. Supporters of this theory point out that German military technology advances tremendously in the twenty years between the two world wars, encompassing guided rockets, experimental jets, and sophisticated tanks. Post World War II, Boilerplate is sighted on a number of occasions, often in Chicago.

== In other media ==
* Paul Guinan and his wife Anina Bennett (who also maintains the Boilerplate website) have coauthored &quot;Boilerplate: History&#x27;s Mechanical Marvel&quot;, an illustrated history of the character&#x27;s adventures. This coffee table book covers Boilerplate&#x27;s 25-year existence as well as its subsequent impact on popular culture. It was published by Abrams Image in October 2009. Guinan and Bennett have previously collaborated on the comic book &quot;Heartbreakers&quot;, published by IDW Publishing; &quot;Heartbreakers Meet Boilerplate&quot;, a 2005 one-shot of this series, also featured Boilerplate and was nominated for an Eisner Award.
* Boilerplate is a character in Chris Elliott&#x27;s 2005 novel &quot;The Shroud of the Thwacker&quot;, a spoof historical thriller. Elliott mistakenly thought that the Boilerplate site concerned a hoax which dated back to the 19th century and included material from the website in his book, not realising it wasn&#x27;t in the public domain. After being alerted to the copyright infringement, Elliott and Guinan negotiated a settlement which allowed the character to be used in exchange for a percentage of Elliott&#x27;s earnings from the book and credit in future editions.
* Boilerplate is featured on the cover of Canadian indie pop band Stars&#x27;s 2008 EP &quot;Sad Robots&quot;, as well as on merchandise for their 2008–9 tour.
*Paramount Pictures have optioned the film rights, to be produced by J. J. Abrams and his Bad Robot production company.

<doc id="1199133" wikidata="Q936680" url="?curid=1199133" title="Kermit Washington">
<text>Kermit Alan Washington (born September 17, 1951) is an American former professional basketball player. Washington is best remembered for punching opposing player Rudy Tomjanovich during an on-court fight in 1977. 
Washington was not a highly coveted player coming out of high school. He averaged four points per game during his senior season at Coolidge Senior High School. He improved rapidly once at American University, and became one of only seven players in NCAA history to average 20 points and 20 rebounds throughout the course of his career.

A big defensive forward, Washington was known for his ability to gather rebounds. He averaged 9.2 points and 8.3 rebounds per game in ten National Basketball Association (NBA) seasons and played in the All-Star Game once. Washington was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers with the fifth overall pick in the 1973 NBA draft. He played sparingly his first three seasons, and sought the help of retired basketball coach Pete Newell before his fourth season. Under Newell&#x27;s tutelage, Washington&#x27;s game rapidly improved and he became a starter for several teams. He played for the Lakers, Boston Celtics, San Diego Clippers, Portland Trail Blazers and Golden State Warriors.

==Early life==
Kermit Washington&#x27;s mother Barbara graduated from Miner Teachers’ College (later subsumed into University of the District of Columbia); his father Alexander was an X-ray technician. When he was three years old, his parents had a fight in which his uncle was violently attacked with an iron. His parents soon divorced, with his father awarded custody of the children. His mother, who suffered from bipolar disorder, then took custody of him and his older brother Eric from their father. Struggling to find money to feed the children, she eventually called their father, who took them back. His stay with his father did not last long, and he and his brother were passed around to various relatives on both sides of the family.

Washington was a shy child. The only time he recalled feeling a sense of self-worth was when his great-grandmother on his father&#x27;s side had the pair for a while. According to Washington, she loved the boys but was extremely strict, domineering, and at times, physically abusive. After his father remarried, the children moved back in with him and his new wife. Washington felt a sense of optimism for the first time, saying &quot;I thought it was our dream come true. All our lives we had seen nice families on TV. Real ones. Now we were going to be a real family.&quot; However, he again felt unwanted this time by his stepmother. As a small child, Washington said that he had no recollections of ever being hugged, and only felt close to his younger brother, Chris. Washington was a poor student who hated school throughout most of his childhood. He had to retake many of his classes in summer school to raise his grades. When he entered high school he played football merely so he could be around a close friend, and have someone to walk home with at night as he was terrified of walking home alone.

As a senior in high school, Washington stood but weighed a mere 150 lbs. After some rare positive feedback by his biology teacher, Barbara Thomas, he began to study and put forth a greater effort in that class. He quickly became a solid student in biology but poor in all other subjects. When Thomas became his home room teacher and saw his grades in other classes she encouraged him to try hard in all of his courses. Washington rapidly improved his marks, making the honor roll in his senior year.

His basketball performance in high school was unimpressive. He came off the bench to average four points per game (ppg). His stepmother informed him that when he graduated from high school he would be thrown out of the house. He trained for three hours a day toward the end of his senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at the University of Maryland to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.

==College years==
During the summer between his senior year of high school and his freshman year of college, Washington grew four inches. He began weight training, and ran the steps in his seven-story dormitory building wearing a weighted vest to improve endurance. Washington became more extroverted in college, so much so that he later said his life could be separated into two parts—his pre-college life and his life after college. He has frequently described his college years as &quot;the happiest time in my life.&quot; He began dating his future wife Pat when he was a freshman. They met after she noticed him accidentally scoring four consecutive points for the opposing team in a freshman basketball game. She pursued him even though he often remained silent when she spent time with him. A lot of the emergence of Washington&#x27;s personality is credited to Pat, who encouraged him to be more outgoing and overcome his low self-esteem. Washington spent a lot of his free time practicing in the gym. He played playground basketball in the summer, and was on several Urban League teams. He averaged 19.4 points and 22.3 rebounds on his freshman team at American. Pat helped him with his grades—despite the fact that he had done well his senior year of high school he was still far behind; he did not even know what a paragraph was when he entered college or how to write a report.

He averaged 18.6 points on 46.8 percent shooting and 20.5 rebounds in his first year of varsity basketball. He still played a somewhat unaggressive or &quot;soft&quot; brand of basketball, and it was hurting his chances of being drafted by a professional team. Between his sophomore and junior years he began lifting weights with Trey Coleman, a former football player from the University of Nebraska who was studying as an undergrad at American. Coleman encouraged him to be more aggressive on the court, and Washington told him that it was not in his nature. Coleman admonished him, telling him he could not afford to be &quot;cool&quot; on the court given his talent level if he wanted to join the pro ranks. Washington was named an academic All-American his junior year. He averaged 21.0 points on 54.4 percent shooting and an NCAA rebounding leader 19.8 rebounds in his junior season. He was drafted after his junior season by the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association (ABA) and offered a four-year contract for $100,000 a year, which astonished him. He decided to stay at American with coach Young for his senior season because he felt he owed the school which had given him a chance when he was coming out of a difficult period in high school. He was offered an invite to try for the 1972 Olympic basketball team after the season, but did not make the squad.

Washington was one of the best players in the country going into his senior season. He marveled at newspaper reports in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; that mentioned &quot;coaches of opposing teams and how they were planning to stop &quot;Kermit Washington&quot;.&quot; He led the nation in rebounding again in his senior season. He was a second team All-American, and helped American into the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). In the last game of his college career, Washington needed to score 39 points to average 20 points and 20 rebounds a game for his career in college. He became extremely nervous before the game and could neither eat nor sleep. The game set American University attendance records, and Washington felt light on his feet when he was introduced before the raucous crowd. He managed to score 40 points and in so doing, became just the seventh player to reach the 20/20 mark. He was thrown a party, and there was a campus wide celebration after the game. He graduated with a 3.37 GPA and a degree in sociology. Washington was a two-time Academic All-American, who taught courses in social sciences his senior year.

==Professional career==

===Los Angeles Lakers (1973–1977)===
Washington was drafted fifth overall by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1973 NBA draft. A week before the team began training camp, Pat and Kermit were married. They invited neither of their families; they just drove together to LA&#x27;s city hall for the ceremony. He had a difficult time making the transition from college center to NBA power forward. Washington also had played in a primarily zone defense system in college and was not versed in man-to-man defense, which is more common in the NBA. He arrived on a team which had legend Jerry West, who was in the waning stages of a career that would result in his becoming the silhouette seen on the NBA&#x27;s logo. Washington admits that he was terrified of West, and felt anxiety every time he made a mistake in front of him. Though healthy, he played in only 45 games and averaged 8.9 minutes a game his rookie season. He hurt his back that year but kept quiet about it, fearing he would be &quot;labeled soft.&quot; The injury would bother him the rest of his career. He continued to struggle in his second season, and discovered that finding individual coaching in the professional game at that time was difficult. Between the rigorous schedule, and the coaches assuming players already knew how to play for the most part when they entered the league, no one, including head coach Bill Sharman, was willing to work with him on a one-on-one basis.
Entering his fourth season, Washington knew the only thing keeping him in the league was his guaranteed contract and that the Lakers had essentially written him off. The organization felt he had the requisite physical skills, so they ascribed his failure to excel to mental deficiencies. Washington was particularly disturbed when in a game against Golden State, he got into an awkward collision with Rick Barry, upon which Barry remarked: &quot;Listen, you better learn how to play this game.&quot; The criticism especially bothered Washington because he felt Barry&#x27;s rebuke was correct. Desperate to improve, he contacted Pete Newell at the recommendation of an agent. Newell was a retired pro and college coach who worked in a front office position with the Lakers, and had drafted Washington when he was then the team&#x27;s GM. In truth, while Newell says he felt some responsibility considering he drafted him, he was involved in many player transactions over the course of his long career, and was not especially attached to Washington. He was surprised by this request, however, and unhappy with his new highly marginalized job within the organization, so Newell agreed to meet Washington for individual drills. He scheduled the practices very early in the morning to test Washington&#x27;s dedication, thinking a professional athlete would not bother to get up at that hour every day. Washington showed up without complaint and Newell put him through intense training sessions. Newell is often seen as a kind, gentlemanly person, who is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the game of basketball. In private practice, however, he could be an intense, unforgiving teacher, and he was even more unforgiving than usual with Washington as he felt that if he were to offer his services for free he would only do so if the player was willing to train maniacally.

Newell had Washington watch tapes of Paul Silas, who was a rebounding forward for the Boston Celtics, and convinced him to have more confidence in his offensive game. He reworked Washington&#x27;s game from the ground up, and in so doing established a name for himself as a tremendous coach of big men—he would later conduct a yearly &quot;Big Man Camp&quot; in Hawaii which was attended by hundreds of NBA players.

Los Angeles had acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Washington&#x27;s style of play complemented him, as Abdul-Jabbar was not an especially physical player. Washington played well, averaging 9.7 points and 9.3 rebounds; however, he struggled with tendinitis in his knee the entire season. His wife pleaded with him to sit out some games, but he took painkillers and kept playing. Washington finally tore the patella tendon in a late season game against Denver. &quot;I could feel it tearing inside. I looked down, and my kneecap was hanging on the side of my leg.&quot; Doctors covered his entire leg in a cast and told him his basketball career was most likely over.

Newell was the person to bring Washington out of the despair Kermit felt when he heard his playing career was probably over. Newell forced him through even more grueling training sessions the following summer, after some of which, Washington strongly considered quitting. His leg had atrophied from the injury and he was scared of re-injuring it during their training sessions. Newell ignored his pleas and told him that if he ever wanted to play again he had to train more than before and work even harder. Washington came back to play the following season and performed well; through the first 25 games he was averaging career highs in points (11.6) and rebounds (10.8). He had been featured in the NBA preview edition of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; (which was dedicated to enforcers that year) before the season and was praised therein for his intimidating nature and fighting skills. The magazine had posed Washington shirtless in a boxing stance as part of a picture layout entitled, &quot;Nobody, but Nobody, Is Gonna Hurt My Teammates.&quot;

===The Rudy Tomjanovich incident===
On December 9, 1977, during an NBA game between the Lakers and the Houston Rockets, a scuffle broke out among several players at midcourt.

The events that precipitated the fight have been frequently debated, and variously interpreted. Two months earlier, on opening night of the season, the Lakers played the Milwaukee Bucks. Bucks center Kent Benson elbowed Abdul-Jabbar in the stomach, and Abdul-Jabbar appeared to be in intense pain. Abdul-Jabbar then punched Benson from behind, breaking Benson&#x27;s jaw and his own hand. Washington got into a brawl with several Buffalo Braves players a few games later. In the December game, at the beginning of the game&#x27;s second half, Lakers guard Norm Nixon missed a shot. Houston&#x27;s Kevin Kunnert and Washington both contended for the rebound, which Kunnert eventually got and passed out to teammate John Lucas. Their battle for the rebound was more physical than usual, however. Abdul-Jabbar became involved and wrestled with Kunnert. As a result, Kermit Washington stayed behind in the backcourt in order to watch over and make sure nothing happened. After the two disengaged, Washington grabbed Kunnert&#x27;s shorts in order to prevent him from getting back over on offense quickly. Kunnert threw an elbow that hit Washington on the upper arm and this move spun him around so that he was facing Washington. What happened next is disputed: Washington, several Lakers, and Rocket forward Robert Reid insisted that Kunnert punched him, Kunnert said Washington swung first after he attempted to free himself from Washington&#x27;s grasp. The referee who saw the action saw merely a &quot;scuffle&quot; between Kunnert and Abdul-Jabbar followed by the one between Kunnert and Washington then Washington&#x27;s punch. Both Washington and Abdul-Jabbar reject this account.

Abdul-Jabbar then ran up behind Kunnert and grabbed his arms to try to pull him away from the scuffle. But this only left him defenseless for Washington&#x27;s first punch, which hit Kunnert in the head and brought him down on one knee.

Washington saw Tomjanovich running toward the altercation. Not knowing that he intended to break up the fight, Washington hit Tomjanovich with a short right-hand punch. The blow, which took Tomjanovich by surprise, fractured his face about one-third of an inch (8 mm) away from his skull and left Tomjanovich unconscious in a pool of blood in the middle of the arena. Abdul-Jabbar likened the sound of the punch to a melon being dropped onto concrete. Tomjanovich had a reputation around the league as a peacemaker. Players involved say that right after Tomjanovich collapsed, the absence of sound at the arena, which was filled with shocked fans, was &quot;the loudest silence you have ever heard.&quot; Reporters heard the sound of the punch all the way in the second floor press box, and some rushed to the playing floor in disbelief.

Tomjanovich was able to get up and walk around, however, and on the way into the locker room he saw Washington. Tomjanovich says that he became aggressive and asked Washington why he punched him. Washington yelled something inaudible about Kunnert, and they were broken up by two security personnel. Tomjanovich was in no condition to fight despite his aggression; besides having the bone structure of his face detached from his skull and suffering a cerebral concussion and broken jaw and nose, he was leaking blood and spinal fluid into his skull capsule. His skull was fractured in such a way that Tomjanovich could taste the spinal fluid leaking into his mouth. He later recalled that at the time of the incident, he believed the scoreboard had fallen on him. The doctor who worked on Tomjanovich said &quot;I have seen many people with far less serious injuries not make it,&quot; and likened the surgery to Scotch-taping together a badly shattered eggshell.

====Aftermath====
Worsening matters for Washington, the only available replay of the incident showed just his punch, not the scuffle that preceded it. This made the attack appear unprovoked, and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, then watched by an average of 30 to 35 million people, replayed the punch countless times as a gag, having cast member Garrett Morris comically defend the punch. It was also the subject of a &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial and investigated on CBS News by Walter Cronkite. Washington was fined $10,000, and suspended for 60 days, missing 26 games; then the longest suspension for an on-court incident in NBA history. Tomjanovich missed the rest of the season, and the Rockets felt Washington should have been suspended for the same period of time.

On-court fights had been all too common in the 1970s, often including bench-clearing brawls. In the season opener, when Abdul-Jabbar punched Benson, no suspension had been levied. However, Washington&#x27;s punch resulted in the league enacting strict penalties for on-court fights. Former NBA commissioner David Stern, then the NBA&#x27;s chief counsel, later said that the incident made NBA officials realize that &quot;you couldn&#x27;t allow men that big and that strong to go around throwing punches at each other.&quot; Currently, any player who throws a punch at another player—even if he misses—is automatically ejected from the game, and suspended for at least his team&#x27;s next game. The league added a third referee to its game crew after the season; this referee would have trailed the play and could have called a foul when Washington grabbed Kunnert&#x27;s shorts, thereby potentially stopping the play and preventing the melee that succeeded it.

Washington received no support from the Lakers front office, aside from a single call the day after the fight from Cooke, and was sent torrents of hate mail filled with racial epithets. He was advised by police not to order room service when he played again, as it was feared he would be poisoned. Larry Fleisher, head of the Players&#x27; Association, wanted Washington to appeal his suspension, an idea which he originally considered, but ultimately rejected. Although many players around the league sympathized with Washington and said that he had a good reputation off the court, he and his wife became ostracized. They had a two-year-old daughter, and Washington&#x27;s wife was eight months pregnant with the couple&#x27;s first son at the time of the punch. His wife recalls she and her children were treated like pariahs after the incident. Her obstetrician refused her service because she was Washington&#x27;s wife, and her friends asked her what kind of person Washington was that he could commit such an act. The only person who contacted them was Newell. Later in the year Washington went to Newell&#x27;s home with a big-screen television which he insisted Newell accept.
On December 27, 1977, just two weeks after the incident, Washington was traded to the Boston Celtics. Red Auerbach, Boston&#x27;s general manager, lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a longtime fan of Washington&#x27;s. His wife, Pat, stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be staying in a hotel. While he waited for his reinstatement, which he thought would not occur until the next season, he became depressed and fell out of shape. He pulled himself together, and began running up and down the flights of stairs of the 29-story hotel.

Years later, Jerry West, who was the Lakers coach at the time, told John Feinstein he still wanted Washington on the roster. Then-general manager Bill Sharman said he was &quot;on the fence.&quot; Cooke, however, decided to move on.

Washington started alongside Hall of Fame center Dave Cowens, who enjoyed playing with Washington, remarking, &quot;It&#x27;s great fun, you can always hear him grunt when he&#x27;s rebounding.&quot; Auerbach said, &quot;Kermit was fighting a battle he couldn&#x27;t win. Nothing he could say or do was going to change the way people perceived him because of that moment. I wanted him to feel at home with us, to feel wanted.&quot; Washington won Boston fans over immediately. His acceptance was aided by a glowing article Bob Ryan of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him. After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the Denver Nuggets.

===Boston Celtics (1977–1978)===
Kunnert signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season even though Washington was on the team because the Celtics offered him the most money. There remained a mostly quiet discord between the two as Washington felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.

===San Diego Clippers (1978–1979)===
Washington and Kunnert were involved in one of the more unusual player transactions in NBA history. Celtics owner Irv Levin wanted to move closer to his home, and business interests, in California but also wanted to continue to own an NBA team. To solve this problem, he and John Y. Brown, Jr., owner of the Buffalo Braves NBA team, exchanged franchises. Washington and Kunnert were two of four Celtics sent to Buffalo as part of the deal. Levin then moved the Buffalo Braves to San Diego, where they were renamed the San Diego Clippers.

In November 1978, San Diego played in Houston. Tomjanovich scored 26 points and collected 11 rebounds while Washington had six and two. Before the game, the Clippers coach, Gene Shue, had suggested to the Rockets coach, Tom Nissalke, that the players shake hands at center court prior to tipoff. Tomjanovich rejected the idea.

===Portland Trail Blazers (1979–1982)===
After a year in San Diego, Washington was traded again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center Bill Walton even though Walton had missed the entire 1978–79 season due to broken bones in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers could not agree on compensation, the commissioner&#x27;s office made the final decision, sending Washington, Kunnert, and Randy Smith to Portland in exchange for Walton. This became the second time Washington and Kunnert were part of the same trade.

Portland had strongly desired Washington, and their general manager Stu Inman, was a close friend of Pete Newell&#x27;s. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended this to be the last time he was traded, which Washington desired since the media coverage and re-locations had been hard on Pat and the children. To his great relief, the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms.

During the same off-season, Tomjanovich and the Rockets&#x27; civil suit vs. the Lakers occurred. Houston&#x27;s side argued that Los Angeles had failed to control Washington. During the trial, numerous players and coaches who were at the game testified. Kunnert testified during the trial and contradicted Washington&#x27;s testimony, angrily branding him a liar. While the two were playing for San Diego their wives became close friends, but their relationship only worsened over time; Washington believed the NBA was keeping Kunnert on the team to prevent him from suing him. Jack Ramsay, Portland&#x27;s coach, however, said that he chose Kunnert over San Diego center Swen Nater when his team was asked by the league to submit a list of players they considered fair compensation for Walton.

Washington shared time at the Trail Blazers power forward spot with Maurice Lucas at first, but after Lucas&#x27; trade to the New Jersey Nets, he became the full-time starter. He played three seasons in Portland, during which he earned a spot in the 1980 NBA All-Star Game, after some of the top players sat out due to injury. During that All-Star weekend, which was held in Landover, Maryland, nearby American U. held a halftime ceremony in which they retired Washington&#x27;s number. He was named a team captain for the following season. In his post-punch career, numerous players, coaches, and officials noted that he became less aggressive on the court out of fear of getting into another fight; something he never did. Washington started experiencing pain in his back and knees during the 1980–81 season. The pain became unbearable during the 1981–82 season, and he retired in January 1982 after missing all but 20 games.

===Golden State Warriors (1987)===
In 1987, after more than five years out of the league, Washington attempted a comeback with the Warriors, but lasted only eight games on the roster (playing in six of them) before being cut.

==Retirement==
Since retiring, Washington has run restaurants and is a founder and operator of a number of charitable organizations. He ran a restaurant in the Portland metropolitan area just north of Portland in Vancouver, Washington, with former Trail Blazer Kevin Duckworth, called &quot;Le Slam.&quot; The restaurant closed in 2001. He has also served in a coaching role with Stanford University, and worked at Pete Newell&#x27;s &quot;Big Man Camp&quot; for 15 years. In 1995, he founded The 6th Man Foundation, otherwise known as Project Contact Africa. In August 1994, Washington accompanied a team of doctors and nurses on a humanitarian mission to Goma, Zaire, working in a refugee camp for people fleeing the Rwandan Civil War. &quot;It was a sad, sad sight&quot;, Washington later recalled, &quot;a sight I&#x27;ll never forget.&quot;

After his career, Washington has complained of treatment he has received in relation to his punching of Tomjanovich. Washington has sought to portray himself as a victim of the fight and appears to have exaggerated some of the misfortunes that came his way as a result of it. Washington told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he has been refused work as a coach time and again. However, Tom Davis hired him as an assistant coach at Stanford, and Davis wanted to bring him to Iowa when he went to coach there. Washington stayed at Stanford and later quit his assistant coaching position, and he subsequently worked as strength and conditioning coach for the Portland Trail Blazers.

Washington also claimed that American University cut off contact with him after he punched Tomjanovich. However, when he tried to become athletic director of American in 1995, the school offered to hire him as assistant to the athletic director, since Washington had no front office experience. When confronted about this Washington stated: &quot;I didn&#x27;t see why I couldn&#x27;t be the AD so they could use my name out front and then have someone with more experience be my assistant.&quot; John Feinstein and others have suggested that the most lasting damage caused by the fight between Washington and Tomjanovich has been to Washington&#x27;s self-image, and his supposed refusal to accept responsibility for his actions in that fight. Pat later said it went deeper than that, as when she met him in college:
In the early 2010s, Washington lived in the Washington, D.C. area, where he was employed as a regional representative of the National Basketball Players Association.

===Fraud conviction===
On May 25, 2016, Washington was indicted for embezzling roughly $500,000 meant for children in Africa. On December 4, 2017, he pled guilty to three counts: one of aggravated identity theft, and two of making a false statement in a tax return. Washington used the charity to launder money he received as kickbacks. Washington, as a regional representative for the National Basketball Players Association, referred NBA players to San Diego attorney Ronald Mix, who then made donations to the charity, but were actually illegal referral payments. Washington then withdrew this money for personal spending. Washington failed to report this money as income on his tax return. In July 2018, he was sentenced to six years in federal prison for charity fraud. He was released in October 2022.

==Personal life==
His older brother Eric, a former St. Louis Cardinals player, committed suicide in 1984.

<text>Texas Southmost College (TSC) is a public junior college located in Brownsville, Texas, United States.

== History ==
===Early history===
Texas Southmost College was established in 1926 under the name of The Junior College of the Lower Rio Grande Valley, as a subsidiary of the local school district in Brownsville. On September 21, 1926, 84 students began classes, meeting in the old Brownsville High School. From 1928 to 1948, it was located in Brownsville High School and Brownsville Elementary School on Palm Boulevard between Washington Street and Jefferson Street. Despite hard times during the Great Depression, the college continued to maintain nominal levels of enrollment.

The name of the college changed in 1931 to Brownsville Junior College, then to Texas Southmost College in 1950. During World War II, due to wartime mobilization, enrollment dwindled, with the number of graduates halved between 1943 and 1945. A major improvement came in 1948 when the city of Brownsville acquired the lands formerly comprising the decommissioned army base known as Fort Brown, which had been closed in 1946.

By 1948, when the college had an enrollment of around 1,250 students, its own campus, and a generous budget, talks had started within the school district about creating a separate district for the college. It was decided that the new district would cover southern Cameron County. In 1950, on the silver anniversary of the college, the Brownsville Independent School District handed over the deed to the college over to the newly formed Southmost Union Junior College District.

=== 1950s to 1990s ===
The Texas Southmost College athletics program flourished in the 1950s: the school had football, basketball, boxing and track teams and many of these teams won accolades for their performance. In the mid- to late 1960s, the TSC athletic program experienced a great decline and many competitive programs did not survive into the 1970s. In the 1960s, despite the declining competitive situation of the sports programs, the college gained the Rancho Del Cielo research center, located 300 miles south of Brownsville, in Mexico. This few acre research center has abundant plant life and rain forest climatic conditions. In 1973 Texas Southmost College began offering its first bachelor&#x27;s degree programs and graduate courses in cooperation with Pan American University (later known as University of Texas–Pan American and located in Edinburg, Texas). This was the origin of the entity known as Pan American University at Brownsville, which worked independently from Texas Southmost College.

In the late 1980s, Pan American University created a partnership with the University of Texas System and the entity in Brownsville became known as The University of Texas–Pan American at Brownsville. Texas Southmost College and The University of Texas–Pan American at Brownsville combined their educational functions as The University of Texas at Brownsville on September 1, 1991. This created the University of Texas at Brownsville/Texas Southmost College. After 1991, UTB/TSC continued to grow, eventually boasting over 10,000 students. On November 2, 2004, voters in the Texas Southmost College district voted yes to a $68-million bond package so the college could do a number of building projects.

=== End of educational partnership with the University of Texas at Brownsville ===
On November 10, 2010, the University of Texas System Board of Regents voted to end the University of Texas at Brownsville&#x27;s educational partnership with Texas Southmost College as it stood. On February 17, 2011, the TSC Board of Trustees voted 4-3 to separate from UTB. On August 31, 2015, UTB was officially dissolved and UTPA&#x27;s name was changed to The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.

==Synopsis==
Han Jung-suh (Choi Ji-woo) and Cha Song-joo (Kwon Sang-woo) are childhood friends and have a special bond that blossoms into love. They both share the pain of losing a loved one: Song-joo&#x27;s father died in a traffic accident and Jung-suh&#x27;s mother died of eye cancer. Jung-suh&#x27;s father (Ha Jae-young) marries an actress named Tae Mi-ra (Lee Hui-hyang), who brings her real daughter, Han Yoo-ri (Park Ji-Mi), and son, Han Tae-hwa (Lee Wan) into the household. Yoo-ri is jealous of Jung-suh, making her look terrible in front of her mother, who begins to turn on Jung-suh. When Jung-suh&#x27;s father leaves for work, her stepmother assaults her. She thwarts Jung-suh&#x27;s attempts to study abroad with Song-joo, who then leaves for America alone. Mi-ra plots for Yoo-ri to win the affections of Song-joo who is the heir of his family fortune. All the while, Jung-suh tries to be nice to Tae-hwa, but he mistakes her friendship for something more, and falls in love with her.

Three years later, Song-joo (Kwon Sang-woo) comes back from America, and Jung-suh (Choi Ji-woo) rushes to greet him. A jealous Yoo-ri (Kim Tae-hee) tries to stop them from reuniting. As they race to the airport, Yoo-ri intentionally hits Jung-suh with her car. Jung-suh is taken to the hospital where a group of people had just died in fire. Yoo-ri swaps Jung-suh&#x27;s ID with one of the people to fake her death. She takes the real Jung-suh to her biological father&#x27;s home. Tae-hwa (Shin Hyun-joon), still in love with Jung-suh, finds out what Yoo-ri has done, but seizes the opportunity to run away with Jung-suh. Jung-suh loses her memory, and Tae-hwa moves them away and changes their names.

Five years later, Yoo-ri is soon to be engaged to Song-joo. Song-joo decides that he needs to let go of Jung-suh and goes to the carousel they used to ride as children. He wishes to see Jung-suh just once more, looks up, and sees her on the carousel. Jung-suh, now named Kim Ji-soo, works at a small clothing shop while living with Tae-hwa (now Chul-soo). Song-joo rushes to Ji-soo and tells her that he is Jung-suh, but she doesn&#x27;t believe him. Song-joo is determined to make her remember her past, and through a series of events, he and Jung-suh become close.

Jung-suh regains her memory when Yoo-ri nearly hits her with her car again and rushes to tell Song-joo. She forgives Tae-hwa as she knew he did it out of love. Jung-suh and Song-joo are happy together, until she discovers she has eye cancer. She asks Tae-hwa to take her away from Song-joo, since she can&#x27;t bear to see him in pain. Gradually, Jung-suh&#x27;s vision deteriorates into blindness. Tae-hwa tells Song-joo and his family the truth starting from the accident. Yoo-ri is arrested, and her mother goes insane and is admitted to a mental hospital.

Song-joo marries Jung-suh, who is now blind, with the blessing of his mother and her father. Jung-suh tells Tae-hwa that her one wish is to see Song-joo&#x27;s face one last time. Both Song-joo and Tae-hwa ask a doctor to let them give Jung-suh one of their corneas, but the doctor tells them that they can&#x27;t take corneas from live donors. Tae-hwa wants to grant her wish at all costs and commits suicide via car crash in order to donate his cornea to her. After his death, Jung-suh has the operation and is able to see again. However, Song-joo finds out about Tae-hwa&#x27;s death and later on tells Jung-suh. She starts to feel sick again, and the doctor states that the tumor has spread to her brain and is inoperable; the same incurable illness that killed her mother. Jung-suh, realizing this, forgives Tae Mi-ra and Yoo-ri because of Tae-hwa. Both Yoo-ri and Tae Mi-ra feel remorse for their wrongdoings against Jung-suh, and apologize to her. Jung-suh dies a few days later at the seaside near her childhood home, in the arms of Song-joo. The ending scene reverts to the beginning scene where Song-joo is playing his piano by the ocean of the memorable beach house. He says, &quot;Perhaps, that person (Tae-hwa) might have loved that girl (Jung-suh) more than I. But even though I say this, that doesn&#x27;t mean that I loved her any less.&quot;

<doc id="1199155" wikidata="Q6524419" url="?curid=1199155" title="Leofwine, Ealdorman of the Hwicce">
<text>Leofwine (died in or after 1023) was appointed Ealdorman of the Hwicce by King Æthelred the Unready of England in 994. The territory of the Hwicce was a kingdom in the Western Midlands in the early Anglo-Saxon period, which soon became a subdivision of Mercia. Leofwine was the son of Ælfwine, who is otherwise unknown, but the family appears to have originated in the East Midlands. Leofwine and his sons were considered by the See of Worcester as spoliators who seized church land, but East Midlands religious establishments regarded them as benefactors.

Under Æthelred, Leofwine&#x27;s sphere of office was in the Hwicce areas of Worcestershire and Gloucestershire, but these counties were given to Danes by King Cnut soon after he gained the throne in 1016. However, Leofwine kept his rank and may have been appointed Ealdorman of Mercia in 1017 in succession to Eadric Streona, but Leofwine&#x27;s eldest son Northman was murdered on Cnut&#x27;s orders in the same year. Leofwine is last recorded in surviving charters in 1023, when he was named as witness, and probably died soon afterwards. His son Leofric was Earl of Mercia by 1032. Leofwine had two others sons, Edwine, who died at the Battle of Rhyd-y-groes in 1039, and Godwine.

<doc id="1199161" wikidata="Q1495439" url="?curid=1199161" title="Kuhn poker">
<text>Kuhn poker is a simplified form of poker developed by Harold W. Kuhn as a simple model zero-sum two-player imperfect-information game, amenable to a complete game-theoretic analysis. In Kuhn poker, the deck includes only three playing cards, for example, a King, Queen, and Jack. One card is dealt to each player, which may place bets similarly to a standard poker. If both players bet or both players pass, the player with the higher card wins, otherwise, the betting player wins.

== Game description ==
In conventional poker terms, a game of Kuhn poker proceeds as follows:
*Each player antes 1.
*Each player is dealt one of the three cards, and the third is put aside unseen.
*Player one can check or bet 1.
**If player one checks then player two can check or bet 1.
***If player two checks there is a showdown for the pot of 2 (i.e. the higher card wins 1 from the other player).
***If player two bets then player one can fold or call.
****If player one folds then player two takes the pot of 3 (i.e. winning 1 from player 1).
****If player one calls there is a showdown for the pot of 4 (i.e. the higher card wins 2 from the other player).
**If player one bets then player two can fold or call.
***If player two folds then player one takes the pot of 3 (i.e. winning 1 from player 2).
***If player two calls there is a showdown for the pot of 4 (i.e. the higher card wins 2 from the other player).

== Optimal strategy ==
The game has a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium; when both players play equilibrium strategies, the first player should expect to lose at a rate of −1/18 per hand (as the game is zero-sum, the second player should expect to win at a rate of +1/18). There is no pure-strategy equilibrium.

Kuhn demonstrated there are infinitely many equilibrium strategies for the first player, forming a continuum governed by a single parameter. In one possible formulation, player one freely chooses the probability formula_1 with which they will bet when having a Jack (otherwise they check; if the other player bets, they should always fold). When having a King, they should bet with the probability of formula_2 (otherwise they check; if the other player bets, they should always call). They should always check when having a Queen, and if the other player bets after this check, they should call with the probability of formula_3.

The second player has a single equilibrium strategy: Always betting or calling when having a King; when having a Queen, checking if possible, otherwise calling with the probability of 1/3; when having a Jack, never calling and betting with the probability of 1/3.

==Generalized versions==
In addition to the basic version invented by Kuhn, other versions appeared adding bigger deck, more players, betting rounds, etc., increasing the complexity of the game.

=== 3-player Kuhn Poker ===
A variant for three players was introduced in 2010 by Nick Abou Risk and Duane Szafron. In this version, the deck includes four cards (adding a ten card), from which three are dealt to the players; otherwise, the basic structure is the same: while there is no outstanding bet, a player can check or bet, with an outstanding bet, a player can call or fold. If all players checked or at least one player called, the game proceeds to showdown, otherwise, the betting player wins.

A family of Nash equilibria for 3-player Kuhn poker is known analytically, which makes it the largest game with more than two players with analytic solution. The family is parameterized using 4–6 parameters (depending on the chosen equilibrium). In all equilibria, player 1 has a fixed strategy, and they always check as the first action; player 2&#x27;s utility is constant, equal to –1/48 per hand. The discovered equilibrium profiles show an interesting feature: by adjusting a strategy parameter formula_4 (between 0 and 1), player 2 can freely shift utility between the other two players while still remaining in equilibrium; player 1&#x27;s utility is equal to formula_5 (which is always worse than player 2&#x27;s utility), player 3&#x27;s utility is formula_6.

It is not known if this equilibrium family covers all Nash equilibria for the game.

<doc id="1199165" wikidata="Q1073968" url="?curid=1199165" title="Pinus tabuliformis">
<text>Pinus tabuliformis, also called Chinese red pine, Manchurian red pine, or Southern Chinese pine is a pine native to northern China and northern Korea.

==Description==
&quot;Pinus tabuliformis&quot; is a medium-sized evergreen tree growing to tall, with a flat-topped crown when mature. The growth rate is fast when young, but slows with age. The grey-brown bark fissures at an early age compared to other trees. The broadly spreading shape is very pronounced, in part due to the long horizontal branching pattern.

The needle-like leaves are shiny grey-green, long and broad, usually in pairs but occasionally in threes at the tips of strong shoots on young trees. The cones are green, ripening brown about 20 months after pollination, broad ovoid, long, with broad scales, each scale with a small prickle. The seeds are long with a wing, and are wind-dispersed.

=== Varieties ===
There are two varieties:
*&quot;Pinus tabuliformis&quot; var. &quot;tabuliformis&quot;. China, except for Liaoning. Broadest cone scales under 15 mm broad.
*&quot;Pinus tabuliformis&quot; var. &quot;mukdensis&quot;. Liaoning, North Korea. Broadest cone scales over 15 mm broad.

Some botanists also treat the closely related Henry&#x27;s pine (&quot;Pinus henryi&quot;) and Sikang pine (&quot;Pinus densata&quot;) as varieties of Chinese red pine; in some older texts even the very distinct Yunnan pine (&quot;Pinus yunnanensis&quot;) is included as a variety.

==Taxonomy==
In some older texts the name is spelled &quot;Pinus tabulaeformis&quot;.

The specific epithet, &quot;tabuliformis&quot; (&#x27;table-shaped&#x27;), refers to the species&#x27; flat-topped crown.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species can be found in northern China from Liaoning west to Inner Mongolia and Gansu, and south to Shandong, Henan and Shaanxi, as well as northern Korea.

==Uses==
The wood is used for general construction. The pulpwood produces certain resins that are used as artificial vanilla flavouring (vanillin). The resin is also used to make turpentine and related products, and is used medicinally to treat a variety respiratory and internal ailments, such as kidney and bladder upsets, wounds, and sores. The bark is a source of tannin. Medicinal use of the pine needles also takes place, which also contain a natural insecticide, as well as a source for a dye. The needles are used to brew pine needle tea (&quot;sollip-cha&quot;).

In the ancient Chinese Zhou dynasty, P. tabuliformis was an official memorial tree, being planted on temple grounds, and in graveyards near the tombs of kings.

It has been widely used for afforestation in Northwest China.

Its cultivation is uncommon outside of China, grown only in botanical gardens.

<text>Richard Dunn (born 19 January 1945) is an English former heavyweight boxer who was the British (1975–76), European (1976) and Commonwealth (1975–76) Champion. He unsuccessfully challenged Muhammad Ali for the world heavyweight title in 1976.

==Early life==
Richard Dunn was born in Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire on 19 January 1945. He played rugby in his teens and early 20s. Starting boxing as an amateur in the early 1960s, he turned professional in his mid-20s whilst continuing to work as a scaffolder, living in Bradford, West Yorkshire. He was unable to afford the expense of sparring partners to train with for most of his career, and his coach was his father-in-law. He was a soldier in the British Army, serving as a non-commissioned officer with 4th Battalion, Parachute Regiment in the 1960s-70s, being awarded the Corps&#x27; Fishmongers&#x27; Trophy in 1974.

==Boxing career==
A southpaw, Dunn&#x27;s professional career began with a win over Cardiff fighter Del Phillips in a heavyweight eliminator competition in Mayfair, London in July 1969. His second fight was on the same day in the semi-final. It was a first-round defeat against Danny McAlinden, who dispatched all three of his opponents in under three rounds to win the competition. However, in May 1973, Dunn defeated Billy Aird on points in an eliminator for the British Heavyweight Championship at Grosvenor House in London. He lost the final eliminator against Bunny Johnson, in October, after a tenth-round knockout at the King&#x27;s Hall in Manchester. However, when he faced the same opponent at the Empire Pool at Wembley for both the British and Commonwealth titles in September 1975, he prevailed on points, after 15 rounds.

=== British title ===
Dunn made his first defence against McAlinden two months later. However, this time it was Dunn that won with a knockout after McAlinden went down three times in the second round.

On 6 April 1976 Dunn won the European Heavyweight Title by a third-round TKO of the German boxer Bernd August at the Royal Albert Hall in London.

=== Title shot ===
On 24 May 1976 Dunn was given the chance of fighting for the WBC and WBA titles against the American champion Muhammad Ali at the Olympic Hall in Munich, Germany. Dunn, despite fighting in a spirited fashion, found himself seriously outmatched by Ali in power and technique, being knocked down several times by the American champion, who clearly realized the un-equalness of the competition in his favour and began to land carefully timed and weighted punches to stun Dunn but minimize the chance of physical injury to him as the fight went on. At the 2:05 minute mark in the fifth round Dunn went to the canvas for the final time and the referee stopped the match in a technical knock-out, with Ali playing to the crowd comically windmilling a punch that was coming that would be overwhelming, and to encourage the referee to end the match as having run its course. (This was to be the last knockout Ali achieved in his professional career.)

=== Aftermath ===
Dunn lost his next fight in London five months later with Joe Bugner, surrendering all his titles in a first-round knock-out. His final fight was a fifth-round knock-out defeat to the South African boxer Kallie Knoetze at the Ellis Park Tennis Stadium in Johannesburg on 10 September 1977, after which Dunn retired from the sport.

Dunn was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1976 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews just ahead of his fight with Muhammad Ali.

==Post-career civic honours==

The &#x27;Richard Dunn Sports Centre&#x27; was opened by Bradford Council in Dunn&#x27;s home town in 1978, named in honour of his sporting achievements. The facility was closed in November 2019, and was due to be demolished in 2020, with the Council announcing the intention to name a new road on the site after Dunn in the future. However the future of the unused leisure centre is now in doubt, after Historic England granted the building Grade II listed status, following an appeal by the Twentieth Century Society.

==Later life==
After his sports career, having lost money in a failed hotel venture, Dunn lived in Scarborough, North Yorkshire with his wife Janet and three children, returning to work as a scaffolder. He was seriously injured in 1989 on an oil rig in the North Sea after a 40 ft fall which broke both of his legs. In retirement he lives in Scarborough, where he has been associated with charity work for Parkinson&#x27;s UK and is the honorary president of the town&#x27;s amateur boxing club.

Dunn has dementia and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

<text>Ho Che Anderson is a cartoonist and comics artist primarily affiliated with Fantagraphics.

==Biography==
Anderson was born in London to “a Jamaican immigrant who named his son after North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh and Cuban Communist revolutionary Che Guevara.”

Anderson was one of the creators to submit ideas when Fantagraphics put out a call for adult comics and the submission became &quot;I Want to Be Your Dog&quot;.

He wrote, designed, and illustrated a series of comic books on Martin Luther King Jr. in 1993, wrote the 1996 &quot;Wise Son: The White Wolf&quot; miniseries for Milestone Comics, and started his &quot;Scream Queen&quot; series in 2010 at Fantagraphics.

One of the artist&#x27;s upcoming projects is a complete reprinting of the stories of the World War II Canadian Whites superhero, The Penguin (No relation to the Batman villain) and with an additional original story by himself.

<text>Daniel Benjamin (born October 16, 1961) is an American diplomat and journalist and was the Coordinator for Counterterrorism at the United States Department of State from 2009 to 2012, appointed by Secretary Hillary Clinton. Benjamin was the director of the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth College. In July 2020, he became president of the American Academy in Berlin, a nonprofit, nonpartisan, independent transatlantic institution in the German capital.

==Early life==
Benjamin grew up in Stamford, Conn., one of three sons (William Benjamin and Jonathan Benjamin) born to Burton and Susan Benjamin. His father is an internist; his late mother was a teacher, an administrator at the University of Connecticut and the head of marketing for a Manhattan law firm. They were a moderately observant Jewish family. 
Benjamin graduated from Harvard University magna cum laude, and then was a 1983 Marshall Scholar at New College, Oxford. After college, he worked as a journalist for &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

==Government service==
From 1994 to 1999, as a member of President Clinton&#x27;s staff, Benjamin served as a foreign policy speech writer and special assistant. During that period, he also served on the National Security Council.

From 2009 to 2012, Benjamin was the US State Department&#x27;s Coordinator for counter-terrorism, with the rank of Ambassador-at-Large.

==Academic work==

Benjamin was a Senior Fellow in the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He was also named a 2004 Berlin prize fellow by the American Academy in Berlin.

From December 2006 to May 2009, Benjamin served as the Director for the Center on the United States and Europe, and Senior Fellow of Foreign Policy Studies at The Brookings Institution.

In 2012, he was appointed the Norman E. McCulloch Jr. Director of the John Sloan Dickey Center for International Understanding at Dartmouth College.

==Writing==
Together with Steven Simon, Benjamin wrote &quot;The Age of Sacred Terror&quot; (Random House, 2002), which documents the rise of al Qaeda and religiously motivated terrorism, as well as America&#x27;s efforts to combat that threat. They review the history of Islamist political thought from ibn Taymiyya in the 13th century, to al-Wahhab (the 18th century founder of Wahabbism) down to bin Laden. The danger, as they see it, is that &quot;al Qaeda&#x27;s belief system cannot be separated neatly from Islamic teachings, because it has -- selectively and perniciously -- built on fundamental Islamic ideas and principles.&quot; The second half of the book outlines the West&#x27;s response. Ellen Laipson, in her review of the book, praises the authors for their study and methodology.

Benjamin and Simon would follow up &quot;The Age of Sacred Terror&quot; in 2005 with &quot;The Next Attack: The Globalization of Jihad&quot; (Hodder &amp; Soughton (in Britain), 2005), a book which received high-praise from Bill Clinton.

In the April 30, 2006 edition of &quot;Time&quot;, Benjamin wrote a favorable profile of Pervez Musharraf, with the headline, &quot;Why Pakistan&#x27;s Leader May Be The West&#x27;s Best Bet for Peace.&quot;
