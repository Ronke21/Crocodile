<text>Oleg Vladimirovich Deripaska (; born 2 January 1968) is a Russian oligarch and billionaire. Deripaska began his career as a metals trader after the breakup of the Soviet Union. He used accumulated funds from trading to acquire stakes in the Sayanogorsk aluminum smelter from a consortium of businessmen who privatized it in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union. The Sayanogorsk aluminum smelter served as the foundation of what later became the world&#x27;s largest aluminium company Rusal. 

Deripaska is the founder of Basic Element, one of Russia&#x27;s largest industrial groups, and Volnoe Delo, Russia&#x27;s largest charitable foundation. He was the president of En+ Group, a Russian energy company, and headed United Company Rusal, the second-largest aluminum company in the world, until he quit both roles in 2018.

He has been characterized as a victor in the &quot;aluminium wars&quot; in Russia during the 1990s, which were frequently violent conflicts between businesspeople to obtain state-owned assets. In 2000, Deripaska founded Rusal, the result of a partnership between Sibirsky Aluminium and Roman Abramovich&#x27;s Millhouse Capital. In 2007, Rusal merged with SUAL Group and Glencore International AG to form UC Rusal, with Deripaska as chairman.
He was once Russia&#x27;s richest man, but lost a substantial part of his fortune amid the 2007–08 financial crisis. As of January 2025, his wealth was estimated by &quot;Forbes&quot; at $2.7 billion, making him the 1240th richest person in the world. In 2017, Deripaska obtained a Cypriot citizenship through the country&#x27;s &#x27;golden visa&#x27; program, which allows major investors in the economy to apply for a national passport.

He was placed under U.S. sanctions in 2022 for reasons relating to the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia. Deripaska was one of seven oligarchs sanctioned by the British government over the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, including asset freezes and travel bans.

As early as 2022 Deripaska was one of a handful Russian businessmen to openly denounce the Russian invasion of Ukraine. After making his statements, he faced pressure from the Kremlin, leading to the seizure of a major asset he owned, valued at USD 1 billion. Nonetheless, he returned to the subject in early August 2024, when he characterized the invasion as &quot;madness&quot; and called for it to be stopped immediately. He came under strong fire from the pro-Putin camp in Russia for his statements, notably from the ultranationalist Alexander Dugin.

==Early life and education==
Deripaska was born in Dzerzhinsk, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Soviet Russia and grew up in Ust-Labinsk, Krasnodar Krai. His parents came from Kuban. Deripaska grew up on the family&#x27;s small farm, where from the age of 5 or 6, he learned how to live off the land from his grandparents, who primarily raised him after his widowed mother, an engineer, had to leave to find work. Deripaska credits his grandparents for teaching him the discipline of hard work along with farming. Both his grandfathers fought in the Second World War. His maternal grandfather returned to Russia after the war ended. His paternal grandfather Timofey Deripaska (1918-1945) – an ethnic Ukrainian – was killed in battle and buried in a mass grave in Austria — in his memory, Deripaska built a Russian Orthodox church in the town Laa an der Thaya.

Deripaska&#x27;s first job was at the Ust-Labinsk plant where his mother worked. At age 11, he became an electrician&#x27;s apprentice doing maintenance on electrical motors. His talent for math allowed him to enroll at the physics faculty of Moscow State University in 1985. One year into his studies, he was conscripted into the armed forces and served in the Soviet Strategic Missile Forces in the Trans-Baikal district of Siberia from 1986 to 1989.

In 1993, Deripaska graduated with honors in physics from Moscow State University; however, the collapse of the Soviet Union greatly reduced academic funding, making it impossible for him to continue his studies as a theoretical physicist. There were no available stipends or grants for students. &quot;We had no money. It was an urgent and practical question every day. How do I earn money to buy food and keep studying?&quot; he recalls. In 1996, he earned a master&#x27;s degree from the Plekhanov University of Economics.

== Career==
At the age of 25, teaming up with fellow physicists, engineers and rocket scientists, Deripaska set up his first metal trading company, VTK. He adopted a systematic, scientific approach to commodity trading. &quot;I represented companies that were buying and selling raw materials&quot;, Deripaska said. Deripaska undertook export arbitrage, buying metal at low Russian prices and selling it abroad at significantly higher international market prices. Deripaska traded primarily through the Baltic state of Estonia, as the Russian system of export licenses was in disarray. &quot;I started my business at an unusual moment in history. The country in which I was born and raised had disappeared, although the new country was not fully formed. The first one gave me an excellent education; the second one gave me the chance of success&quot;, Deripaska recalled in an interview with &quot;Metal Bulletin&quot;.

He used nearly all his arbitrage and trading profits to acquire his initial package of shares in the Sayanogorsk aluminum smelter in Southern Siberia.

In 1994, Deripaska became director general of the plant at the age of 26. In 1997, he founded Sibirsky (Siberian) Aluminium Group, which in 2000 merged with Roman Abramovich&#x27;s Millhouse Capital to create RUSAL. In 2003, businesses led by Deripaska increased their stake in those companies under common management to 75% by acquiring half of the interest managed by Millhouse Capital. In 2004, the consolidation of RUSAL&#x27;s ownership by companies related to Deripaska was completed with the acquisition of the remaining 25% equity interest in RUSAL managed by Millhouse Capital. Deripaska was named businessman of the year in 1999, 2006, and 2007 by &quot;Vedomosti&quot;, a Russian business daily.

RUSAL went on to become the largest aluminum producer in the world, until the China Hongqiao Group surpassed it in 2015. In 2010, under Deripaska&#x27;s leadership, Rusal became the first Russian company to be listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

===Basic Element===
Beyond metals, which as of 2016 remained at the core of his diversified industrial holding, Deripaska has acquired stakes in a wide range of companies in various sectors, including energy, manufacturing, commercial vehicles, auto components, financial and insurance services, leasing businesses, construction, aviation, and agriculture. Among his assets are a Siberian power company , that is Russia&#x27;s biggest private energy company; he owns 10% of Ingosstrakh, one of Russia&#x27;s largest insurance companies; GAZ Group, a producer of cars, trucks and buses, founder of agricultural business (Kuban Agro Holding). He established a transport company to run airports in the Krasnodar region, including Sochi and Krasnodar.

All these assets form part of the diversified investment and industrial group Basic Element.
Deripaska is the founder of Basic Element, a diversified investment group established in 1997 which has been managing investments in the following sectors: energy, metals and mining, machinery, financial services, agriculture, construction, and aviation. The major investments under Basic Element management included stakes in United Company RUSAL (the world&#x27;s largest aluminum and alumina producer), GAZ Group (an automotive company), Aviakor aircraft manufacturer, EuroSibEnergo (ЕвроСибЭнерго (an energy supply company) Glavmosstroy (Главмосстрой) (a construction company) Kuban Agroholding (an agricultural company) and Basel Aero (an aviation business comprising the three largest airports in the Krasnodar territory, and a joint venture with Changi Airports International). Basic Element has been managing Deripaska&#x27;s investments into companies in Russia, the CIS countries, Africa, Australia, Asia, Europe and Latin America, which employ as many as 250,000 people. Strikeforce Mining and Resources (SMR) is also controlled by Basic Element.
Basic Element built several Olympic facilities for 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, including the Coastal Olympic Village, Imeretisnkiy sea port, Doubler of Kurortny Avenue in Sochi, renovation of the Sochi International Airport. The total investments account for over $1.4 billion.

During the world financial crisis 2007 Deripaska temporarily had to sell his 25% stake in Austrian construction company Strabag, but bought them back in 2010. In return, Strabag obtained a 26% stake in Transstroy.

=== Troubles with US travel, 2006–2009 ===
In 2008, whilst Deripaska was involved in a bid to buy the Daimler Chrysler Group, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that the United States canceled his entry visa due to &quot;criminal associations and relationships&quot;. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; likewise reported that it could have been because Deripaska has been accused of having links to organized crime in Russia and cited as their sources two unnamed U.S. law enforcement officials. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on 27 August 2018 that the visa had been revoked on concerns Deripaska might attempt to launder money through real estate transactions. Deripaska had received a multiple-entry visa in 2005; a U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation spokesman refused to comment. Lobbying on his behalf had been done by former Senate Republican leader and 1996 presidential candidate Bob Dole and his law firm, Alston &amp; Bird, Senate records show. Alston &amp; Bird was paid about US$260,000 in 2005 for work on &quot;Department of State visa policies and procedures&quot; tied to Deripaska.

In 2009, Deripaska was again allowed entry and visited the United States twice. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that according to two unnamed FBI administration officials, Deripaska met with agents regarding a continuing criminal probe, the details of which were not known or reported. During Deripaska&#x27;s visits, he met with leading management figures from investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The aluminum company that Deripaska headed, United Company RUSAL, was in preparations for an initial public offering. The easing of Deripaska&#x27;s visa issues, which were an issue for possible investors, helped to reassure bankers. The State Department has never said why it revoked his visa and refused to comment on his 2009 visits. The visits were arranged outside of the usual process as the U.S. continues to have concerns about Deripaska&#x27;s business associations. Deripaska has repeatedly denied a connection to any organized crime and said business rivals have caused the visa to be revoked by smearing him. When interviewed by the BBC in July 2009, Deripaska said that the authorities in the United States had been attempting to blackmail him by revoking his visa and thus affecting possible investors in a negative way and thereby hoping to push Deripaska into cooperating with them.

NBC News reported in October 2021 that Russia had given Deripaska diplomatic status, allowing him to enter the U.S. with immunity.

=== Magna and lawsuit against Morgan Stanley, 2015 ===
In May 2007, Magna International chairman Frank Stronach announced that Deripaska was becoming a strategic partner in Magna. In 2007, Deripaska&#x27;s Veleron investment vehicle acquired stock in Magna through a $1.2 billion loan from BNP Paribas, with Magna shares serving as collateral. Morgan Stanley was involved in the deal through a swap agreement with BNP Paribas where the US bank assumed the risks of the loan in return for a fixed payment from Paribas.

In September 2008, Magna&#x27;s stocks plummeted, hit by the global economic downturn. BNP issued a $93 million margin call to Veleron. Morgan Stanley, in turn, learned that Veleron was unlikely to meet the call and sold the stock short. Deripaska claimed that Morgan Stanley abused its duties and engaged in unlawful insider trading that resulted in significant financial damage to Veleron, estimated at $15 million to $25 million.

In 2015, Deripaska filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley, accusing the bank of using insider information to short sell Deripaska&#x27;s $1.5 billion investment in shares of Canadian-based Magna International in 2008.
The New York jury determined in November 2015 that Morgan Stanley had &quot;acquired inside information and traded on it despite a duty to keep it confidential and not trade on it&quot;, finding as well that Morgan Stanley did not have the intent to defraud Veleron. Veleron strongly disagreed with and said it would file an appeal.

===En+ Group===

The group was formed in 2006, with Deripaska as president and controlling shareholder. The En+ Group is a diversified mining, metals and energy group. It owns a majority stake in UC Rusal (48.13%) and in EuroSibEnergo.

In 2017, it reported adjusted core earnings of $2.3 billion on revenues totaling $9.8 billion. In November 2017, En+ was listed on the London Stock Exchange raising $1.5 billion.

=== Metals and mining ===

====RUSAL====

United Company RUSAL is the world&#x27;s second largest aluminum company. It was the largest until it was overtaken by China Hongqiao Group in 2015. In 2019, Rusal was overtaken by China&#x27;s Chalco as the second biggest listed producer of aluminum. As of 2018, UC RUSAL accounts for 5.8% of the world&#x27;s primary aluminum output and 6.2% of the world&#x27;s alumina production.

In order to ensure a stable supply of alumina to its smelters, several mergers and acquisitions were accomplished by RUSAL under Deripaska. At the beginning of the 2000s, RUSAL acquired bauxite mines in Guinea, a country with the world&#x27;s largest bauxite reserves. Subsequently, RUSAL acquired a stake in an alumina refinery in Australia. At Deripaska&#x27;s behest, in 2007, RUSAL, SUAL Group, one of the world&#x27;s top 10 aluminum producers; and Glencore International AG, the Swiss natural resources group, merged their assets to form United Company RUSAL, the world&#x27;s largest aluminum and alumina producer.

After the merger with Glencore, bauxite and alumina assets in Jamaica, Italy and Ireland were added to RUSAL&#x27;s portfolio. These transactions converted RUSAL from a company with few supplies of the raw material bauxite into a vertically integrated corporation.

In parallel, Deripaska invested significantly in the operational improvement of smelters inside Russia. He said, &quot;We consolidated the industry, and located bauxites that do not exist in Russia. We established the company that became the leader of industry in less than twelve years. But to become the number one aluminum producer in the world, we had to improve our operations practice. To apply the best practices in the world, we looked at Toyota, which had utilized a precise, deep and well thought-through process for almost thirty years of operations.&quot;

Deripaska himself has been an active supporter of Japanese production efficiencies made popular by the &quot;Toyota Way.&quot; RUSAL smelters have adopted the concept of &quot;kaizen&quot;, which means continuous improvement and involves training workers in standardized production techniques. &quot;It&#x27;s important to change both the company&#x27;s mind set and reporting lines&quot;, Deripaska said. &quot;Instead of top-down management, you should understand everything is in the hands of your operator and empower that operator to drive efficiencies and improvements directly on the factory floor.&quot;

Under Deripaska&#x27;s leadership, RUSAL constructed and commissioned Khakas aluminum smelter outside of Sayanogorsk in Russian Siberia. The Khakas facility was the first aluminum smelter built in post-Soviet Russia (since 1985). The smelter, with an annual capacity of 300,000 tonnes, was as of 2006 one of the most technologically advanced in the world. The company also undertook large-scale modernization projects at a number of its facilities, including the Bratsk, Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk aluminum smelters.

In the middle of the financial crisis, Deripaska returned in 2009 to RUSAL as CEO to lead the company through the debt restructuring process. &quot;I worked 16-hour days. We were in default, although none of the parties involved wanted to call it default.&quot; As part of contingency measures, Deripaska cut costs at RUSAL by 25% in 2009. By December 2009, Deripaska reached a final agreement with over 70 Russian and international lenders to refinance US$17 billion of debt.

In 2017, Rusal issued two Eurobonds to finance its debts. The first one, worth $600 million, was issued in February, followed by the second one in April, worth $500 million. Also in February, plans were announced to sell 10 billion yuan worth of seven-year onshore bonds to finance purchases in China. This made Rusal the first foreign company to offer panda bonds on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The company also agreed on a pre-export finance mechanism with international lenders worth $1.7 billion for debt refinancing.

In 2013, Deripaska was awarded the &quot;Aluminium Industry Ambassador Award&quot; in the &quot;Metal Bulletin&quot; Awards for Excellence for his &quot;great influence within the global aluminium industry and the wider market&quot;.

Deripaska stepped down from RUSAL in May 2018 the day after seven board members and the chief executive resigned. The move was part of a deal with the US Treasury to get U.S. sanctions removed from the company. As part of that deal, in February 2019 it was announced that Deripaska had reduced his ownership stake in EN+ to below 50% in order to obtain sanctions relief.

=====Cherney lawsuit, 2008 =====
Michael Cherney brought legal action against Deripaska in the Commercial Court of the High Court in London. Cherney sought a declaration that he was the beneficial owner of 20% of RUSAL stock which, he claimed, Deripaska held in trust for him. The claim was denied. On 3 May 2007, Justice Langley ruled that Deripaska had not been properly served, and that the court had no jurisdiction to try the claim as Deripaska did not live in England or Wales.

In July 2008, Justice Christopher Clarke ruled that the case should be tried in England, although &quot;the natural forum for this litigation is Russia&quot;, because, he held, &quot;risks inherent in a trial in Russia...are sufficient to make England the forum in which the case can most suitably be tried in the interest of both parties and the ends of justice&quot;. On 22 July 2008, he granted Deripaska the right to appeal. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales rejected the appeal on 31 July 2009.

At a June 2011 case management conference, the judge deferred a decision on whether Cherney would be allowed to give evidence by video link from Israel rather than appear in person. An outstanding arrest warrant issued by Interpol meant that the British would detain him if he travelled to the UK. In late July 2011, the High Court ruled to allow Cherney to give evidence at the trial by video link from Israel, and also set trial for April 2012. Deripaska denied that Cherney was owed any stake in RUSAL, and asserted payments made to Cherney had been for unavoidable &quot;protection&quot; at a time when violence was sweeping the region and posed an existential threat to any profitable business in the country. In an interview with &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, Deripaska said he was one of the few who worked to clean up Russian industry and provided support to law enforcement agencies. However, in this early chaotic period paying protection money to criminal gangs was inescapable, as revealed in court testimony. In September 2012, Cherney terminated his UK lawsuit against Deripaska.

===Energy===

==== EuroSibEnergo ====
EuroSibEnergo controls and manages 18 power plants with a combined installed energy capacity of 19.5 GW, including 15 GW provided by hydrogeneration. The company produces approximately 9% of all electricity in Russia and is also the leader in the Siberian energy market, with a market share totaling 41%. Some of EuroSibEnergo&#x27;s key clients include the largest aluminum plants in Russia. The company owns large fuel resources, which satisfy over 85% of the coal needs of its thermal power and boiler plants. Its coal reserves amount to 1.26 billion tons, with annual coal production exceeding 12 million tons.
En+ Group, of which EuroSibEnergo is a subsidiary, is investing in a joint venture with China&#x27;s largest hydroelectric power generation company China Yangtze Power Co to build new power plants in Siberia, primarily hydroelectric ones, with a total capacity of up to 10 GWt.

===Machinery===

====Russian Machines====
Russian Machines corporation was established in 2005 and unites Deripaska&#x27;s machine building assets. It comprises industrial and engineering assets in the following industries: automotive OEM (GAZ Group), automotive components (RM-Systems), rail industry (RM Rail), aircraft OEM (Aviacor), road construction (RM-Terex) and agricultural machinery (AGCO-RM).

Russian Machines Corporation manages 24 facilities located across 12 regions in Russia.

In September 2017, Deripaska entered into a joint venture through his Russian Machines () with AGCO called AGCO-RM SPIC project ().

====GAZ Group====
In 2000, Deripaska started acquiring machine building assets. His first acquisition was Nizhny Novgorod-based Gorkovsky Automobile Plant (GAZ), which was previously a government-run company. In 2005, GAZ Group was established by combining Deripaska&#x27;s machine building assets.

The Russian automotive conglomerate, GAZ Group, comprises 18 manufacturing facilities in eight regions of Russia, as well as sales and service organizations. GAZ Group produces light and medium commercial vehicles, heavy trucks, buses, cars, road construction equipment, power units, and automotive components.
In March 2019, GAZ Group asked the Russian government for $468 million in support claiming that US sanctions placed on Deripaska could cut production by almost 40% in the second half of that year.

====Airports====
Basel Aero, a joint venture between Changi Airports International, Basic Element and Sberbank of Russia, is a company-operator the Sochi, Krasnodar and Anapa airports.

These airports handle more than 7% of the total passenger flow in Russia. Sochi International Airport was the main gateway to Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics and successfully serviced the guests and participants of the Games.

In October 2014, Sochi was granted open skies status, meaning that any foreign carrier may pick up and drop off passengers and cargo with no restrictions on aircraft type, frequency, and regardless of interstate agreements.

===Financial services===
Deripaska personally holds 10% of Ingosstrakh&#x27;s ordinary shares. The company is a leading insurer of complex risks such as insurance for ship owners, ship hull insurance, insurance against aviation and space-related risks, and insurance of transportation companies. Ingosstrakh has 83 branches in Russia and the company&#x27;s offices operate in 220 Russian towns and cities.

===Agribusiness===
In 2011, Deripaska established Kuban Agroholding, a 75,000-hectare agribusiness in the Krasnodar region. The company integrates two dairy farms, а 16,000 pig capacity breeding complex, three elevators with non-recurrent grain storage capacity of more than 270,000 tonnes, three grain processing plants, a sugar factory and the Sunrise horse breeding farm, specializing in the breeding of English thoroughbred horses. It is one of the top-20 largest agribusinesses and top-5 most efficient land users in Russia.

Kuban Agroholding is one of the few agrocompanies in Russia involved in embryo transfer technology that allows for the reproduction of high-yielding milk cows using less-productive surrogates.

The company has gained significant media attention for its corn-seeding program, deploying several dozen corn brands selected by its genetic specialists.

According to Forbes in June 2019, Deripaska&#x27;s Kuban land bank was the fourteenth largest in Russia.

===Redut PMC===

Redut, also known as Redoubt or Redut-Antiterror and formerly known as &quot;Shield&quot;, is a Russian Private Military and Security Company (PMSC) that is part of the &quot;Antiterror-family&quot;. Redut consists of similarly named PMSCs which protect commercial operations of Russian companies. Redut is currently deployed by Russia in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, for which it was sanctioned. Several fighters of the group have been convicted of war crimes during the invasion.

Oleg Deripaska and Gennady Timchenko reportedly are major backers of the company. The PMC received armored personnel carriers, helmets, and protective vests from them.

Deripaska refutes these claims, saying that he had &quot;never provided any form of support, financing or backing to any military companies or groups&quot;.

=== Other roles ===
In 2004, Deripaska was appointed by the President of Russia to represent the country in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Advisory Council (ABAC). He has been Chairman of ABAC Russia since 2007. Deripaska is the vice president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, chairman of the executive board of the Russian national committee of the International Chamber of Commerce and a member of the Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship Council, an agency of the Russian government.

Since 2007 he has been a permanent participant at World Economic Forum sessions , when RUSAL became a WEF &quot;strategic partner&quot;.

==Investigations==
In 2009 Deripaska had been interrogated as a witness in Spain and England and by the FBI about money laundering, he was never charged with any crimes. 
On 25 January 2010, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; published a story titled &quot;Rusal: A lingering heat&quot; exploring Deripaska&#x27;s business relations with Sergei Popov and Anton Malevsky, alleged heads of Russian organized crime groups. Deripaska has accused Michael Chernoy of using Malevsky and the Izmailovskaya syndicate to extort US$250 million from him as part of a protection racket. However, Deripaska has himself been accused of having similar links to Malevsky, who, with his brother Andrei, owned a 10% stake in Deripaska&#x27;s company. Deripaska denies the claims.
In 2011, Deripaska and Iskander Makhmudov (head of UGMK) were asked by Spanish police to answer questions in relation to a money-laundering enquiry.

In November 2011, Spain&#x27;s High Court sent the criminal cases against Deripaska to the Russian General Prosecutor&#x27;s office because the root of the cases is Russian.

==Political relationships and controversies==
===Vladimir Putin===
Deripaska is known for his close ties with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Their relationship became visibly strained amidst Deripaska&#x27;s financial struggles in 2009. In an incident broadcast on Russian television, Putin visited a stalled cement factory owned by Deripaska and berated its management. He forced Deripaska to sign a contract promising to pay nearly $1 million in unpaid wages. Their relationship recovered, however, and Deripaska has been described as &quot;Putin&#x27;s favorite industrialist&quot;. Leaked U.S. diplomatic cables from 2006 described Deripaska as &quot;among the 2–3 oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis&quot; and &quot;a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin&#x27;s trips abroad&quot;. In a 2011 interview with &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Kinross Gold CEO Tye Burt, who knows Deripaska, said &quot;I believe Russia recognizes Oleg&#x27;s major role in building a renewed economic base in a broad range of domestic businesses and rejuvenating ailing companies and infrastructure.&quot;

===Nathaniel Rothschild and Peter Mandelson===
Deripaska is a friend of Nathaniel Rothschild, a major investor in both Glencore and United Company RUSAL. Together Deripaska and Rothschild hosted George Osborne and Peter Mandelson on Deripaska&#x27;s yacht in Corfu in the summer of 2008. Osborne was then Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer of the United Kingdom and a friend of Rothschild from school and university. Peter Mandelson has reportedly maintained private contacts over several years with Deripaska.

News of the contacts sparked criticism because, as European Union Trade Commissioner, Mandelson had been responsible for decision to cut aluminium tariffs from 6 to 3%, a decision that had benefited Deripaska&#x27;s Company RusAl. Mandelson insisted that he had never discussed aluminium tariffs with Deripaska. On 26 October 2008 the Shadow Foreign Secretary William Hague claimed the &quot;whole country&quot; wanted &quot;transparency&quot; about Mandelson&#x27;s previous meetings with Deripaska. In response, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Mandelson&#x27;s dealings with Deripaska had been &quot;found to be above board&quot;. Mandelson said that meeting business figures from &quot;across the range&quot; in emerging economies was part of his brief as EU Trade Commissioner. On 29 October 2008, while Mandelson was on a ministerial visit to Moscow, it was alleged in the British press that Valery Pechenkin, the head of security at Deripaska&#x27;s company Basic Element, organised a swift entry visa for Mandelson when he came to Moscow to visit Deripaska in 2005.

===Paul Manafort===
On 22 March 2017, the Associated Press published a report alleging that Paul Manafort, Donald Trump&#x27;s former presidential campaign manager, negotiated a $10 million annual contract with Deripaska to promote Russian interests in politics, business, and media coverage in Europe and the United States, starting in 2005. Both Deripaska and Manafort confirmed working together in the past, but rejected the contents of the AP story. Manafort argued that his work had been inaccurately presented, and that there was nothing “inappropriate or nefarious&quot; about it.

Responding to the allegations, on 28 March 2017, Deripaska published open letters in the print editions of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in which he denied having signed a $10 million contract with Manafort in order to benefit the Putin government. He also stated willingness to testify before the United States Congress about these allegations, and argued that the accusations were part of &quot;the negative context of current US-Russian relations.&quot; Congressional sources cited by &quot;The New York Times&quot; said lawmakers declined Deripaska&#x27;s request after he had asked for immunity from criminal prosecution. Unnamed officials argued that &quot;immunity agreements create complications for federal criminal investigators&quot;.

On 15 May 2017, Deripaska filed a defamation and libel lawsuit against the Associated Press in U.S. District Court in D.C., arguing that the report falsely claimed that Deripaska had signed a contract with Manafort to advance the goals of the Russian government. The lawsuit was dismissed in October 2017 on the grounds that Deripaska had not disputed &quot;any material facts&quot; in the story by the Associated Press.

While Manafort served within the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, it is alleged that Manafort, via Kyiv-based operative Konstantin Kilimnik, offered to provide briefings on political developments to Deripaska. Behaviors such as these were seen by writers at &quot;The Atlantic&quot; as an attempt by Manafort &quot;to please an oligarch tied to&quot; Putin&#x27;s government.

=== Alleged involvement in Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections ===

In February 2018, Alexei Navalny published a video about a meeting between Deripaska and Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Sergei Eduardovich Prikhodko on a yacht traveling near Norway. According to Navalny, Deripaska probably served as a middle man between the Russian government represented by Prikhodko and Paul Manafort during Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Prikhodko denied the allegations, accusing Navalny of &quot;mixing the facts&quot; about his &quot;friend&quot; Deripaska, Donald Trump and Paul Manafort, while also voicing his wish to have talk with Navalny as a &quot;man with a man&quot;.

A day after the video was published the Roskomnadzor added the video to the Federal List of Extremist Materials, thus making accessing the video illegal for all Russian citizens. It also ordered YouTube to remove seven videos and Instagram to take down 14 points that were cited in the investigation; neither YouTube nor Instagram had responded as of 12 February 2018. According to a Roskomnadzor representative who spoke to &quot;Vedomosti&quot;, a &quot;court injunction of this sort against content hosted on Instagram and YouTube is unprecedented for Russia&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; noted that this may presage a &quot;more aggressive approach by the Russian government&quot; to control online activities.

In March 2018, fearing her own death while incarcerated in Bangkok, Anastasia Vashukevich, a Belarusian escort who claimed to have over 16 hours of audio recordings she said could shed light on possible Russian interference in American elections. She offered the recordings to American authorities in exchange for asylum, but was deported and arrested in a Russian airport. Vashukevich said the recordings from August 2016 include Deripaska discussing the United States presidential election with three English-speakers who Vashukevich believed were American. &quot;Deripaska had a plan about elections&quot;, Vashukevich said. In court, Vashukevich apologized to Deripaska, and said Russian agents visited her in jail to urge her to cease public statements about him. &quot;The New York Times&quot; argued that her claims might be easily dismissed were it not for the Navalny video. Deripaska denies an intimate history with Vashukevich.

== Sanctions ==
; Australian sanctions
On 18 March 2022, Australia added Deripaska to its sanctions list.
; Canada sanctions
Sanctioned by Canada under the Special Economic Measures Act (S.C. 1992, c. 17) in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine for Grave Breach of International Peace and Security.

; European Union sanctions
On 8 April 2022, the EU added Deripaska to its sanctions list, freezing his assets and imposing a travel ban in all member states. On 30 November 2022, Deripaska filed an appeal against the EU&#x27;s decision to sanction him.

Ukraine is claiming that assets belonging to Deripaska have been moved into the name of Siegfried Wolf an Austrian citizen, who is paid by Deripaska, to avoid sanctions.

; UK sanctions
Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Deripaska was sanctioned by the British government which involved freezing his assets and a travel ban.

Deripaska-linked UK company Terra Services Ltd was raided in December 2018.

; U.S. sanctions

In April 2018, the United States imposed sanctions on Deripaska and 23 other Russian tycoons and officials. The statement of the United States Department of the Treasury said that Deripaska &quot;ha[d] been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and racketeering&quot;.

In May 2018, it was reporteted that Deripaska had to return three private jets owned by Credit Suisse and Raiffeisen.

In October 2018 the U.S. Treasury announced that it had extended until 12 December a deadline for the full imposition of sanctions against Rusal and its parent company En+ Group, pending the review of the proposals presented by En+ Group to the U.S. government that would see Deripaska reduce his stake in En+ to below 45 per cent from around 70 per cent.

In January 2019 the U.S. Treasury lifted the sanctions on companies formerly controlled by Deripaska. Sanctions on Deripaska himself remained in effect. In April 2019, the U.S. Treasury Department nonetheless allowed Deripaska to transfer 10.5 million shares of his holding company En+ Group to a trust fund for his children as part of a divorce settlement with his ex-wife Polina Yumasheva, which had been finalized before the sanctions were put in place. The deal to have U.S. sanctions removed from En+ Group was brokered by Greg Barker, a UK legislator, who in February 2019 went on to be appointed chairman of En+ Group.

In March 2019, Deripaska sued the United States, alleging that it had overstepped its legal bounds in imposing sanctions on him and made him the &quot;latest victim&quot; in the FBI probe into Russia&#x27;s interference in U.S. elections. U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta dismissed the suit in June 2021, ruling it lacked merit. On 3 October 2022, the US Supreme Court rejected the oligarch&#x27;s appeal.

On 29 September 2022 the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York accused Deripaska of sanctions evasion. According to the prosecutor&#x27;s office, Deripaska, through Gracetown Inc., illegally used the U.S. financial system to service real estate objects owned by him. In this he was assisted by two women: Olga Shriki, who operated in the United States, and Natalia Bardakova, who directed Shriki from Russia. They are also charged with violating U.S. sanctions. Chriqui was arrested on 29 September. All three &quot;are charged with one count of conspiring to violate and evade U.S. sanctions, in violation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison,&quot; the statement says. Graham Bonham-Carter has been charged with helping Deripaska evade sanctions.

In January 2023, Charles McGonigal, a former head of counterintelligence in the FBI New York City field office, was charged with conspiring with co-defendant Sergey Shestakov, a former Soviet and Russian diplomat who is a U.S. citizen, to provide services to Deripaska in 2021, in violation of U.S. sanctions imposed on Deripaska in 2018. They allegedly did so by investigating a rival Russian oligarch in return for concealed payments from Deripaska, using shell companies in the contract that outlined the services to be performed, using a forged signature on that contract, and using the same shell companies to send and receive payment from Deripaska.

== Personal life ==
Deripaska was married to Polina Yumasheva, the daughter of Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s top adviser Valentin Yumashev and stepdaughter of Yeltsin&#x27;s daughter Tatyana. While Yeltsin was president, Deripaska&#x27;s close ties put him in Yeltsin&#x27;s inner circle, dubbed &quot;The Family&quot;. Deripaska and Yumasheva were married from 2001 to 2018. The Deripaskas have two children: a son, Pyotr (born 2001), and daughter, Maria (born 2003). Deripaska practices yoga, swimming, horseback riding, and hiking. At his home near Moscow, he has seven horses and six dogs.

In March 2018, it was reported that Deripaska had successfully purchased Cypriot citizenship in 2017 under that country&#x27;s golden visa, which generates billions in revenue for the island nation. According to documents seen by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Deripaska&#x27;s first attempt to become a citizen of a country in the EU was unsuccessful because of a preliminary inquiry into his activities in Belgium. The inquiry was dismissed in 2016.

In 2009, Deripaska&#x27;s ranking fell to No. 164, with &quot;Forbes&quot; stating: &quot;[H]e may not withstand collapsing markets and heavy debts&quot;.

In 2010, his estimated $US10.7 billion fortune allowed him to rise to No. 57 of the World&#x27;s Billionaires list. According to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine, he removed the heads of his two largest companies and personally negotiated with the Russian government, banks, and other creditors to restructure his loan obligations. Deripaska himself in 2007 was reported to have consistently said that the estimate of his wealth was exaggerated, that it did not completely account for the amount of debt he incurred, and that he should be ranked far below the top ten on the list of the Russian billionaires.

&quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his fortune at $US3.3 billion in 2015, $5.2 billion in 2017, and $3.3 billion in 2019. In June 2022, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his net worth to be $US3.2 billion.

Deripaska&#x27;s Cypriot−registered company Edenfield Investments acquired the Grade II listed Hamstone House in the St George&#x27;s Hill district of Weybridge, Surrey, in 2001. Since 2006, Deripaska has owned the Haft mansion near Embassy Row in Washington, D.C., through a company incorporated in Delaware.

He owns a mansion in Belgravia.

===Charitable and other activities===
Oleg Deripaska sits on the board of trustees of the Bolshoi Theatre, and has financed ballet performances like &quot;Flames of Paris&quot;, &quot;La Sylphide&quot;, and &quot;Paquita&quot; as well as operas like &quot;The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya&quot;, &quot;Carmen&quot;, and &quot;Wozzeck&quot;.

In 1998, Deripaska established a charitable foundation in Russia, Volnoe Delo. The fund supports initiatives in Russia aimed at developing education and science, preserving spiritual and cultural heritage, and improving standards in public health. Since 1998, Deripaska claims to have invested in more than 500 charity programs in 50 regions of Russia. Volnoe Delo has supported research activities in the 2,550-year-old city of Phanagoria since 2004. More than $10 million has been allocated to Phanagoria fieldwork over the past 14 years. Today, Phanagoria is one of the best-equipped archeological sites in Russia and has a scientific and cultural center, equipment and technology for above-ground and underwater excavation, as well as a team of specialists involved in the excavation process. In 2014, Volnoe Delo foundation launched a programme for students&#x27; early career guidance and professional training—JuniorSkills. The first, pilot, championship on professional skills, JuniorSkills Hi-Tech, was held in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg in 2014, part of the nationwide championship on cross-industry blue-collar professions in high-tech &quot;WorldSkills&quot;. In 2020 during the pandemic of COVID-19 it bought new ambulances and sent them to twelve Russian towns in Siberia and the Urals.

Deripaska was a member of the International Council at Harvard University&#x27;s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.

In 2017, during the West African Ebola virus epidemic Deripaska personally initiated construction of the Centre for Epidemic and Microbiological Research and Treatment in the Guinean Kindia province. The centre was designed and constructed by RUSAL specialists with the assistance of Rospotrebnadzor scientists (RUSAL has invested $10 million).

In February 2014, Deripaska financed the construction of makeshift kennels to house stray dogs that had been abandoned by construction workers after completing work on the Sochi Olympic Village.

In October 2015 Deripaska called for governments not to agree to the Paris climate accords since they lacked legally-binding mechanisms and arguing that countries like India and China needed to contribute more to avoid competition problems.

In 2020 during the pandemic he donated money to construct hospitals in Siberia.

As part of a public relations campaign, he said in April 2021 that Rosstat (Federal State Statistics Service) data showing that there are 17.8 million poor people living below the country&#x27;s subsistence minimum was wrong, and that the correct number was about 80 million.

Deripaska criticized the Russian invasion of Ukraine on several occasions. On 20 December 2022, a Russian court had ordered the seizure of a luxury hotel complex in Sochi worth $1 billion owned by Deripaska. The seizure might be triggered by Deripaska&#x27;s criticism of the war.

He sits on the board of trustees of the School of Business Administration, the School of Public Administration, and the School of Economics at Moscow State University as well as the School of Business Administration at St. Petersburg State University. Deripaska is a co-founder of the National Science Support Foundation and the National Medicine Fund. In 1999, he was awarded the Order of Friendship, a state award of the Russian Federation.

<text>Black Noise music entertainment is a hip-hop crew hailing from the Cape Flats in Cape Town, South Africa, which gained street popularity, primarily after the group chose to reach out to Cape Flats youth with the inclusion of members from Mitchell&#x27;s Plain. The crew, along with Prophets of Da City (POC), is credited with being a pioneer of Cape Town&#x27;s &#x27;conscious&#x27; hip-hop scene in the late 80s and early 90s. The crew&#x27;s line-up has changed significantly since the early 90s, but Emile YX? (aka Emile Jansen) has been the crew&#x27;s mainstay. Black Noise is South Africa&#x27;s oldest active hip-hop crew and Jansen, born on 20 July 1968 in Cape Town, has been instrumental in employing Black Noise for youth development initiatives, such as workshops for township youth. He went on to establish a non-profit organisation called Heal the Hood and launched landmark hip-hop events; these include the annual Hip-Hop Indaba, African Battle Cry and Shut Up and Dance. The crew has conducted workshops and performed extensively in South Africa as well as in a number of European countries. Jansen and Black Noise have also launched a number of albums, DVDs, poetry anthologies (including the work of school pupils and established hip-hop artists) and books.

His work on eTVs &quot;Step Up or Step Out&quot; gave him the chance to judge dance competitions and work with the youth. Furthermore, he has helped to raise money and sent 177 young people to travel to international events globally. He has recorded and released 12 albums with Black Noise, 6 solo Emile YX? Albums, 1 Afrikaaps soundtrack, 9 compilation albums, 7 Heal the Hood compilation albums and helped 6 local artists release their solo albums. Emile started South Africa&#x27;s first Hip Hop magazine “Da Juice” and wrote 3 books. He also helped graffiti artists Falko and Mak1 to release their own magazines and a compilation of Rhymes, Articles, Poetry, Short Stories and Sketches (R.A.P.S.S. #1) Emile also created plays and was part of the creating team of Afrikaaps, Ons Bou, Mixing It Up, Break Hip Hop Dance Theatre play, Stompie Garage play.

Emile started break-dancing in 1982 with Pop Glide Crew. So he became one of the first South African bboys, which made him a pioneer of South African Hip Hop. Six years after that, in 1986, he made it to the regional finals of the Shell Road to Fame with “the Chill Convention&quot;, who later that year became the legendary South African Hip Hop Group Black Noise. In addition Emile Jansen qualified as a school teacher and started teaching at Battswood Primary. In 1989 the group won the Mayors Award for Greening the City. Two years later Emile and Black Noise self- funded a tour to JHB to explore their own record deal and performed with Brenda Fassie &amp; Marc Alex. In 1992 Black Noise signed a record deal with Tusk Records and released Black Noise 1st Album &quot;Pumpin&#x27; Loose Da Juice&quot;. The album was created around the same time that the world of hip hop goes from Public Enemy to the gangster era.

Black Noise helped with Voters Education before South Africa&#x27;s first democratic election campaign in 1994. 
At the Inauguration of Nelson Mandela, Black Noise performed in Cape Town to support the democratisation process of South Africa.
In the same year Emile attends Universal Zulu (Hip Hop) Nation Anniversary in New York to spread the ideas of South African Hip Hop. Two members, Warro and Ernie, left the group before the 3rd Album &quot;Black Facts&quot; was released in St Louis Missouri.

1995 Emile &amp; Black Noise were part of a movie about youth globally called &quot;Juvenis&quot; and performed in Sweden for the UN 50th Anniversary. Falko joins BN for 4th element of hip hop.
Adidas offered the group a Sponsorship, which Black Noise accepted.

In 1997 Black Noise won the 3rd place at World Break-dance Championships in Germany. Since 1997 Black Noise released seven more Albums.

In 2001 they released an album called &quot;Circles of Fire&quot;. It is an ode to Capoeira, the martial art of Brazilian slaves; the &#x27;circle of fire&#x27; is the sacred space in which this martial art is performed. Black Noise tried to mix the rhythms of Capoeira with urban South African hip hop styles. &#x27;Don&#x27;t speak, just listen&#x27;, is an a cappella track talking about gangsterism in Cape Town. The standout track on the album is a remake of Bob Marley&#x27;s &#x27;Could you be loved&#x27;. Like POC, Black Noise&#x27;s live act includes MCs, DJs and b-boy performances. They have also included live music components at certain events.

==Recognition==

Black Noise&#x27;s Emile Jansen features in the 2010 South African feature, The Creators. In the film, Emile teaches bboy workshops to Cape Flat youth, leads a group of South Africans on a trek up Table Mountain, and spearheads the first African Hip Hop Indaba. Members of Black Noise are also supporting the Heal the Hood Organisation, which tries to teach young adolescents self-confidence and encourage them developing own ideas.

<text>Bison Dele ( ; born Brian Carson Williams; April 6, 1969 – disappeared July 7, 2002) was an American professional basketball player who played center for the NBA&#x27;s Orlando Magic, Denver Nuggets, Los Angeles Clippers, Chicago Bulls and Detroit Pistons. Dele played college basketball for the Maryland Terrapins from 1987–1988 and for the Arizona Wildcats from 1988–1991 before being selected by the Magic with the 10th overall pick in the 1991 NBA draft. He won a championship with the Bulls in 1997. 

Dele is believed to have been murdered at sea by his older brother Miles Dabord in 2002. His girlfriend, Serena Karlan, and skipper Bertrand Saldo are also presumed to have been killed by Dabord.

== Early life and NCAA career ==
Williams was born on Easter Sunday, April 6, 1969, in Fresno, California, the second son of Patricia Phillips and of singer Eugene &quot;Geno&quot; Williams Jr. of the musical group The Platters, who later divorced. Patricia Phillips remarried and raised her two sons in Fresno until that marriage ended when Brian was in junior high. He was of African-American descent.

As a junior in high school, he attended Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas, Nevada. He averaged 17.3 points, 12.7 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 2.5 steals and 9.1 blocks per game in his senior season, shooting 57.7% from the field. As a senior, he attended Saint Monica Catholic High School in Santa Monica, California, where his jersey is retired. He was a track and field runner, until a high school growth spurt pushed him towards basketball. His collegiate basketball career began at the University of Maryland, where he played for one year before sitting out the next season while transferring to the University of Arizona.

== Professional career ==
After playing for two seasons at Arizona, Williams was drafted with the 10th pick in the first round of the 1991 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic. He saw limited action during two seasons in Orlando.

After playing for Orlando, Williams joined the Denver Nuggets, for whom he played two seasons. In 1993–94, he played a career-high 80 games and averaged 8.0 points per game. Williams then played one year for the Los Angeles Clippers, earning increased playing time and averaging 15.8 points per game. Due to a contract dispute and reports that Williams&#x27; asking price was too high, he could not find a team at the beginning of the 1996–97 season, sitting out most of the season. He was then signed by the Chicago Bulls nine games before the end of the season and became an important backup player in the Bulls&#x27; run to their fifth championship. Williams finished his career playing two seasons with the Detroit Pistons, where he set career highs of 16.2 points and 8.9 rebounds per game in 1997–98.

In 1998, he changed his name to Bison Dele to honor his Native American (Cherokee) and African ancestry, and played his final season under that name.

=== Retirement ===
Dele suddenly retired from the NBA before the start of the 1999–2000 season at age 30, when he was still in the prime of his career. He had been the Pistons&#x27; highest-paid player, but had strained relationships with the organization and decided to walk away from the remaining five years and US$36.45 million on his contract rather than be traded. It has also been theorized he had never been especially passionate about playing basketball and felt he had earned enough money to allow him to walk away from the professional game and lifestyle.

== Personal life ==
Dele reportedly dated Madonna at one point in his career. He played the saxophone, violin and trumpet, enjoyed adventure travel, and earned a pilot&#x27;s license. After his retirement he spent long periods traveling to Lebanon, the Mediterranean, and the Australian outback before learning to sail and purchasing a catamaran.

==Disappearance==
On July 6, 2002, Dele sailed from Tahiti on his catamaran, the &quot;Hukuna Matata&quot; (a misspelling of the Swahili phrase &quot;hakuna matata&quot;). He was joined by his girlfriend, Serena Karlan, his brother, Miles Dabord (born Kevin Williams), and skipper Bertrand Saldo. Dabord was the only person involved in the voyage who was seen or heard from after July 8, 2002, when the last of four satellite phone calls from the voyage was made. Dele and Karlan had previously kept regular contact with their banks and family members. On July 20, Dabord brought the boat into Tahiti; he was alone aboard the vessel.

On September 6, 2002, police used a sting operation organized by Dele&#x27;s family and friends to detain Dabord in Phoenix. Dabord had forged Dele&#x27;s signature in order to open mailboxes in his name, and to buy US$152,000 worth of gold under his brother&#x27;s name, using Dele&#x27;s passport as identification. Mexican police later found that Dabord had been staying at a hotel in Tijuana, Mexico. Two days before, the &quot;Hukuna Matata&quot;, which had been registered in Tahiti under another name, was found off the coast of Tahiti with its name plate removed and some possible bullet holes patched. About the same time, Dabord phoned his mother, Patricia Phillips, telling her that he would never hurt Dele and that he could not survive in prison.

The FBI and French authorities became involved in the investigation, found that Dabord bought about $200 of weights and was suspected of using them to weigh down the bodies, and concluded that Dele, Karlan and Saldo were probably murdered and then thrown overboard by Dabord, the weights along with other evidence suggesting that Dabord had planned the murders. Given that the bodies were likely dumped in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, it would be highly unlikely that the three would ever be found.

Dabord, the only first-person source of information regarding the case, intentionally overdosed on insulin and slipped into a coma. On September 27, 2002, Dabord died in a California hospital. In his account of events, Dabord said he and his brother had fought, and that Karlan had been accidentally hit and died when her head struck part of the boat. When Saldo wanted to report her death, a panicked Dele killed him; Dabord then shot his brother in self-defense, threw the bodies overboard and subsequently fled back to the U.S. Special Agent John Steiner, the FBI supervisor on the case, related that the forensic team examining the boat had not found any evidence to support Dabord&#x27;s story and that &quot;There&#x27;s just no way it could have happened like that.&quot; It is not conclusively known if Dabord&#x27;s story is true, but the story would not explain why Dabord bought weights, why he allegedly threw all three bodies overboard, why there were patched holes conforming with bullet holes in the boat, why he used his brother&#x27;s identity, and why he subsequently purposely overdosed on insulin instead of explaining to authorities what had happened, if the story was true. After Dabord&#x27;s death, officials did not expect to find much more regarding the case. A memorial service was then held for both Dele and Dabord.

The brothers were frequently at odds with each other. A crew member had left the boat because he found the brothers’ fighting unbearable. After Dabord&#x27;s death, his lawyer and lifelong friend, Paul White, was questioned regarding Dabord but was somewhat evasive and gave little information about what happened.

<doc id="1209983" wikidata="Q2917000" url="?curid=1209983" title="High yellow">
<text>High yellow, occasionally simply yellow (dialect: yaller, yella), is a term used to describe a light-skinned black person . It is also used as a slang for those thought to have &quot;yellow undertones&quot;. The term was in common use in the United States at the end of the 19th century and the mid 20th century.

== Etymology ==

&quot;High&quot; is usually considered a reference to a social class system in which skin color (and associated ancestries) is a major factor, placing those of lighter skin (with more White ancestry) at the top and those of darker skin at the bottom. High yellows, while still considered part of the African-American ethnic group, were thought to gain privileges because of their skin and ancestry. &quot;Yellow&quot; is in reference to the usually very pale undertone to the skin color of members of this group, due to mixture with white people. Another reading of the etymology of the word &quot;high&quot; is that it is a slang word for &quot;very&quot;, often used in Southern English, therefore &quot;very yellow&quot; (as opposed to brown).

== Use as social class distinction ==
In an aspect of colorism, &quot;high yellow&quot; was also related to social class distinctions among people of color. In post-Civil War South Carolina, and according to one account by historian Edward Ball, &quot;Members of the colored elite were called &#x27;high yellow&#x27; for their shade of skin&quot;, as well as slang terms meaning snobbish. In his biography of Duke Ellington, a native of Washington, D.C., David Bradbury wrote that Washington&#x27;s

In some cases the confusion of color with class came about because some of the lighter-skinned black people came from families of mixed heritage free before the Civil War, who had begun to accumulate education and property. In addition, some wealthier white planters made an effort to have their &quot;natural sons&quot; (the term for children outside of marriage who were produced with enslaved women) educated or trained as apprentices; some passed on property to them. For instance, in 1860, most of the 200 subscription students at Wilberforce College were the mixed-race sons of white planters, who paid for their education.

These social distinctions made the cosmopolitan Harlem more appealing to many black people. The Cotton Club of the Prohibition era &quot;had a segregated, white-only audience policy and a color-conscious, &#x27;high yellow&#x27; hiring policy for chorus girls&quot;. It was common for lighter-skinned African Americans to hold &quot;paper bag parties,&quot; which admitted only those whose complexion was lighter than that of a brown paper bag.

In her 1942 &quot;Glossary of Harlem Slang&quot;, Zora Neale Hurston placed &quot;high yaller&quot; at the beginning of the entry for colorscale, which ran:


== Applied to individuals ==
The French author Alexandre Dumas père was the son of a French mulatto general (born in Saint-Domingue but educated by his father in France) and his French wife. He was described as having skin &quot;with a yellow so high it was almost white&quot;. In a 1929 review, &quot;Time&quot; referred to him as a &quot;High Yellow Fictioneer&quot;.

Singer Eartha Kitt was taunted by darker-skinned relatives and called that &quot;yella gal&quot; during her childhood.

== Art and popular culture ==
The terminology and its cultural aspects were explored in Dael Orlandersmith&#x27;s play &quot;Yellowman&quot;, a 2002 Pulitzer Prize Finalist in drama. The play depicts a dark-skinned girl whose own mother &quot;inadvertently teaches her the pain of rejection and the importance of being accepted by the &#x27;high yellow&#x27; boys&quot;. One reviewer described the term as having &quot;the inherent, unwieldy power to incite black Americans with such intense divisiveness and fervor&quot; as few others.

In popular print media, &quot;Life&quot; published a full-page colour reproduction on page 34 of its 1st February 1937 issue of a 1934 painting by Reginald Marsh (artist) as part of an article entitled &quot;Living Art at $5 Per Picture&quot;. Titled &quot;High Yaller&quot;, the painting&#x27;s subject is a light-skinned black woman dressed in bright yellow from head to foot walking down a Harlem street.

The phrase survives in folk songs such as &quot;The Yellow Rose of Texas&quot;, which originally referred to Emily West Morgan, a &quot;mulatto&quot; indentured servant apocryphally associated with the Battle of San Jacinto. Blind Willie McTell&#x27;s song &quot;Lord, Send Me an Angel&quot; has its protagonist forced to choose among three women, described as &quot;Atlanta yellow&quot;, &quot;Macon brown&quot;, and a &quot;Statesboro blackskin&quot;. Bessie Smith&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;ve Got What It Takes&quot;, by Clarence Williams, refers to &quot;a slick high yeller&quot; boyfriend who &quot;turned real pale&quot; when she would not wait for him to get out of jail. Curtis Mayfield&#x27;s song &quot;We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue&quot; makes reference to a &quot;high yellow gal&quot;. In &quot;Big Leg Blues&quot;, Mississippi John Hurt sings: &quot;Some crave high yellow. I like black and brown.&quot;

Digital Underground&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Sons of the P&quot; featured &quot;No Nose Jobs&quot;, a song in which Shock G as Humpty Hump opines:

&quot;They say the lighter the righter - Oh yeah?! Well&#x27;at&#x27;s tough - Sometimes I feel that I&#x27;m not black enough - I&#x27;m high yellow, my nose is brown to perfection - And if I was to change it&#x27;d be further in that direction - So catch me on the beach, I&#x27;ll be gettin&#x27; a tan - But yo there&#x27;s no mistake that - Humpty-Hump is from the motherland&quot;.

On the 1988 album &quot;Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm&quot; by Joni Mitchell, the song &quot;Dancin&#x27; Clown&quot; contains the lyrics &quot;Down the street comes last word Susie, she&#x27;s high yellow, looking top nice.&quot;

On Ice Cube&#x27;s album &quot;War &amp; Peace Vol. 2 (The Peace Disc)&quot; released in 2000, the song &quot;Hello&quot; contains the lyrics &quot;I&#x27;m looking for a big yellow in 6-inch stilettos&quot;.

In 2004, white R&amp;B singer-songwriter Teena Marie released a song titled &quot;High Yellow Girl&quot;, said to be about her daughter Alia Rose, who is biracial. The related phrase &quot;high brown&quot; was used in Irving Berlin&#x27;s original lyrics for &quot;Puttin&#x27; on the Ritz&quot;.

In 2009, Lil Wayne released a mixtape track from &quot;No Ceilings&quot; titled &quot;I&#x27;m Good&quot;, and contains the lyrics &quot;High yellow woman with her hair to her ass&quot;.

In 2010, Soulja Boy released &quot;Pretty Boy Swag&quot; which has the line &quot;I&#x27;m lookin&#x27; for a yellow bone long haired star (star)&quot;.

In 2021, the Dominican-American R&amp;B singer DaniLeigh sparked controversy by releasing a snippet of a song called &quot;High Yellow&quot;. She later apologized following accusations of colorism.

<text>Pyrmont () is an inner-city suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia 2 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Sydney. It is also part of the Darling Harbour region.

Aboriginal culture
Before European settlement the Eora tribe of Indigenous Australians inhabited the area. Their Aboriginal name for this area was &#x27;Pirrama&#x27;, which is still the name of a road on the Pyrmont waterfront.

Pyrmont was once a vital component of Sydney&#x27;s industrial waterfront, with wharves, shipbuilding yards, factories and woolstores. As industry moved out, the population and the area declined. In recent years it has experienced redevelopment with an influx of residents and office workers.

==History==
The original name for the land now known as Pyrmont is Pirrama, Dharug Language. 

Pyrmont contained a mineral spring of cold water bubbling out of a rock and was thus named for a similar natural spring in Bad Pyrmont, close to Hanover, Germany. Thomas Jones was granted of land on the peninsula in 1795. Land was sold to Obadiah Ikin in 1796 for 10 pounds, which he then sold to Captain John Macarthur in 1799 for a gallon of rum.

Pyrmont was the site of quarries from a fairly early stage because of the quality of the sandstone. Charles Saunders, licensee of the Quarryman&#x27;s Arms hotel, became the biggest quarrymaster, with three quarries established in the area from 1853. The work was continued by his son and grandson till circa 1931. The quarries were nicknamed Paradise, Purgatory and Hell Hole by the Scottish workers employed by Saunders. Steam-powered equipment was used there for the first time in Australia. The sandstone was used in many of the most significant buildings in Sydney. Saunders Street, near the site of the Paradise quarry, was named after Saunders.

The area was also the site of the first Presbyterian Church in the colony, built in 1864 and situated in Mount Street. The congregation eventually outgrew the premises and had to move to a new church at Quarry Street, Ultimo, in 1883. In the 1870s, a small Methodist chapel was built in Harris Street on land owned by Charles Saunders. In the 1920s, it was converted to the Maybanke Free Kindergarten, named after Maybanke Anderson, a feminist and educationist. It was still used for that purpose as of 2018.

Pyrmont became a working class industrial and port community. A major sugar refinery was operated by CSR Limited. In 1900 the area had a population of around 30,000. The first Pyrmont Bridge opened in 1858. A larger bridge with a swinging span opened in 1902, but was closed to traffic in the 1980s. It was subsequently turned into a pedestrian precinct. In 1973, a public meeting held between residents of Pyrmont and Ultimo asked the Builders Labourers Federation imposed a green ban on the North Western Expressway to save much of the suburb.

===Decay===
Pyrmont was regarded as a slum area in the late 19th century. It started to decay seriously after World War II, when industries closed down, and the residents moved to the suburbs. In 1963 the Ultimo Powerhouse closed down as well. Its population declined to only 1,800 by 1978.

By 1990 the population had dropped to around 900.

===Redevelopment in the 1990s===
In order to rejuvenate the area the government initiated the Better Cities Program. In 1992 the City West Development Corporation had been created with the mission to renew the precinct. In 1999 this responsibility has been transferred to the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority.

This led to a larger community of 13,000 by 2004 and also an increase of trade with businesses moving back into the area, totalling 22,000 employees. Almost all industrial function is gone from the area now, replaced by low and high-rise residential developments. The sugar refinery closed down and some of the buildings, including The Cooperage and Tablet House, were restored as residential and office space. Both are listed on the local government heritage register.

Following the redevelopment the suburb became more multicultural, with only 35% of residents born in Australia, followed by 8% born in China.

Pyrmont was served by the former Sydney tramway network. Services commenced at Railway Square, travelling southwest on Broadway, turning right onto Harris Street, passing the former Darling Harbour Goods Yard. At Pyrmont a separate line branched off from the main line on Harris Street, turning left into Miller Street, turning right into Bank Street, crossing the former Glebe Island Bridge. It then travelled along Commercial Road turning right onto Victoria Road, then right onto Darling Street, terminating at the Darling Street wharf. The tram lines closed in 1958. The Sydney Monorail ran between the city and nearby Darling Harbour across the Pyrmont Bridge between 1988 and 2013.

==Parks==

St Bartholomew&#x27;s Park is a small park on the corner of Bowman Street and Cross Street, created in 1954 after the demolition of numbers 113-115 Bowman Street. The park is named after St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church which once stood nearby on Point Street (now a block of apartments at 22 Point Street).

Pirrama Park (previous known as Pyrmont Point Park) is located in the northern tip of the peninsula, overlooking Balmain East, and extends southwest along the coast to Elizabeth Macarthur Bay and the beginning of Harris Street, along Pirrama Road. The land was previously a base for the Water Police; the City of Sydney acquired it in 2005 and developed the area into a 1.8ha recreational space, with cafes, barbeque facilities and children&#x27;s play equipment.

Giba Park sits atop the cliff overlooking Pirrama Park.

Waterfront Park is near the western extreme of the suburb, near the Glebe Island Bridge.

<doc id="1210027" wikidata="Q798907" url="?curid=1210027" title="Baden, Ontario">
<text>Baden ( ) is a suburban community and unincorporated place in Township of Wilmot, Regional Municipality of Waterloo in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. It was named after Baden-Baden, Germany; the approximate population as of 2015, as per township statistics, is 4,940.

The area is the site of the Baden Tower, a huge television, radio, and communications tower located on top of one of the Baden Hills, which is the transmitter for CKCO-DT, the CTV affiliate for Kitchener, as well as CFCA-FM and CHYM-FM, which have studios in Kitchener.

Much of the area consists of farmlands and pine forests are in the area. The local high school, Waterloo-Oxford District Secondary School, is located just outside the town and the statue park Prime Ministers Path is located on the grounds adjacent to Castle Kilbride.

==History==
The first settler in this area was Jacob Beck in 1854; he opened a large flour mill on the Spring Creek. A second flour mill, two saw mills, a flax mill, and an iron foundry also opened in the next twenty years. The settlement was originally called Weissenburg.

The village of Baden founded and established in 1855, was originally named after an old bachelor living in the area. Jacob Beck, born in the Grand Duchy of Baden-Baden, Germany, settled in the village and later renamed Baden in 1854. Baden was also the birthplace of Sir Adam Beck, founder of Ontario&#x27;s public hydroelectric system.

By 1864, the town had school and its population was 400.

A historical plaque near Baden honours Christian Nafziger, an Amish Mennonite from Munich, Germany, who arrived in 1822 with about seventy families. With assistance from local Mennonites, he was able to obtain the &quot;German Block&quot; (now Wilmot Township) from the government; many other Amish from Europe settled here.

Baden is home to the historic Castle Kilbride, built in 1877 by James Livingston, co-founder of a successful linseed oil company, who went on to represent the area in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and the House of Commons of Canada. The home was designed by architect David W. Gingerich, who also designed major projects such as the Mutual Life office block, the Waterloo Town Hall, and the governor&#x27;s (jailer&#x27;s) house at the Waterloo County Gaol. In 1993, Castle Kilbride was purchased and restored by Wilmot Township, which spent $6.2 million on the project. The castle was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1994 and Wilmot Township&#x27;s administrative offices and council chamber are housed in an addition to the original building.

Baden was also the home town of Sir Adam Beck, who went on to pioneer hydroelectric power, the visible results being the generation plants located in Niagara Falls. Beck has a park named after him in his hometown, as well as an elementary school within the Waterloo Region District School Board.

===Prime Ministers Path===
Baden is home to Prime Ministers Path, a series of bronze sculptures of Canadian prime ministers, designed to have visitors explore the history of the country since Canadian Confederation. The privately funded project was conceived of as a Canada 150 project and has been met with repeated controversy. It was unanimously approved by Wilmot Township councillors in 2016 after attempts to install it in Kitchener&#x27;s Victoria Park and on the campus of Wilfrid Laurier University failed after public push back about the appropriateness of the project. As of June 2020, statues of Robert Borden, Kim Campbell, William Lyon Mackenzie King, John A. Macdonald, and Lester B. Pearson have been installed. Several of the designs include Easter eggs as nods to notable events or aspects of a prime minister&#x27;s life.

The statue of Sir John A. Macdonald, the first to be installed, was put in place June 2016. Titled &#x27;A Canadian Conversation&#x27;, the piece was sculpted by Wilmot artist Ruth Abernethy. It had previously been installed on the Laurier campus, but was removed and relocated after concerns were raised about Macdonald&#x27;s role in creating the Canadian Indian residential school system. Controversy regarding the statue project was raised again in June 2020, following the dousing of Macdonald&#x27;s statue in red paint, an act that coincided with the celebration of National Indigenous Peoples Day. A statue of Macdonald had been vandalized with red paint the week prior in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. The incidents followed a number of similar occurrences across North America tied to calls for the removal of monuments and memorials following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Wilmot mayor, Les Armstrong, defended the Prime Ministers Path expressing frustration with people who failed to do their research about Macdonald, noting the prime minister had a number of Indigenous friends. Statue creator Ruth Abernathy acknowledged the incident raised important questions about who is deemed worthy of a statue, but cautioned against &quot;sanitizing public spaces&quot;. Cree-Métis educator Lori Campbell challenged the ability of public statues to raise awareness about history due to lack of contextual information. Campbell positioned museums as better and safer spaces for these types of installations, calling their presence in open spaces &quot;painful&quot;.

==Amenities==

The Region of Waterloo Library operates a branch at 115 Snyder&#x27;s Road East, beside the community mailboxes.

==Transportation==

The Grand Trunk Railway originally built its rail line to Southwestern Ontario in the mid-19th century, with a station in Baden, which existed until at least the 1950s. This line still exists as the CN Guelph Subdivision, which runs from the Park Street bridge in Kitchener (continuing east as the Metrolinx Guelph Subdivision) to London Junction in London, Ontario, where it connects to the CN Dundas Subdivision immediately after crossing over the CP Galt Subdivision. Baden is the location of a rail siding on the Guelph Subdivision, as well as an industrial spur constructed by Pestell Group. Baden is not currently served by passenger rail, though Wilmot Township has set aside land for a possible future GO Transit layover facility and station in Baden. The nearest passenger station is Kitchener station, which is served by both Via Rail &quot;Corridor&quot; and GO Transit Kitchener line trains.

<doc id="1210028" wikidata="Q1454806" url="?curid=1210028" title="Languages of South Africa">
<text>At least thirty-five languages are spoken in South Africa, twelve of which are official languages of South Africa: Ndebele, Pedi, Sotho, South African Sign Language, Swazi, Tsonga, Tswana, Venda, Afrikaans, Xhosa, Zulu, and English, which is the primary language used in parliamentary and state discourse, though all official languages are equal in legal status. In addition, South African Sign Language was recognised as the twelfth official language of South Africa by the National Assembly on 3 May 2023. Unofficial languages are protected under the Constitution of South Africa, though few are mentioned by any name.

Unofficial and marginalised languages include what are considered some of Southern Africa&#x27;s oldest languages: Khoekhoegowab, !Orakobab, Xirikobab, N|uuki, ǃXunthali, and Khwedam; and other African languages, such as SiPhuthi, IsiHlubi, SiBhaca, SiLala, SiNhlangwini (IsiZansi), SiNrebele (SiSumayela), IsiMpondo/IsiMpondro, IsiMpondomise/IsiMpromse/Isimpomse, KheLobedu, SePulana, HiPai, SeKutswe, SeṰokwa, SeHananwa, SiThonga, SiLaNgomane, SheKgalagari, XiRhonga, SeKopa (Sekgaga), and others. Most South Africans can speak more than one language, and there is very often a diglossia between the official and unofficial language forms for speakers of the latter.

==Language demographics==


The most common language spoken as a first language by South Africans is Zulu (23%), followed by Xhosa (16%), and Afrikaans (14%). English is the fourth most common first language in the country (9.6%), but is understood in most urban areas and is the dominant language in government and the media.

The majority of South Africans speak a language from one of the two principal branches of the native Bantu languages that are represented in South Africa: the Sotho–Tswana branch (which includes Southern Sotho, Northern Sotho and Tswana languages officially), or the Nguni branch (which includes Zulu, Xhosa, Swati and Ndebele languages officially). For each of the two groups, the languages within that group are for the most part intelligible to a native speaker of any other language within that group.

The indigenous African languages of South Africa which are official, and therefore dominant, can be divided into two geographical zones, with Nguni languages being predominant in the south-eastern third of the country (Indian Ocean coast) and Sotho-Tswana languages being predominant in the northern third of the country located further inland, as also in Botswana and Lesotho. Gauteng is the most linguistically heterogeneous province, with roughly equal numbers of Nguni, Sotho-Tswana and Indo-European language speakers, with Khoekhoe influence. This has resulted in the spread of an urban argot, Tsotsitaal or S&#x27;Camtho/Ringas, in large urban townships in the province, which has spread nationwide.

Tsotsitaal in its original form as &quot;Flaaitaal&quot; was based on Afrikaans, a colonial language derived from Dutch, which is the most widely spoken language in the western half of the country (Western and Northern Cape). Afrikaans is spoken as first language by approximately 61 percent of whites and 76 percent of Coloured people. This racial term is popularly considered to mean &quot;mixed race&quot;, as it represents to some degree a creole population many of whom are descendants of slave populations imported by the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC) from slaving posts in West and East Africa, and from its colonies of the Indian Ocean trade route.

Political exiles from the VOC colony of Batavia were also brought to the Cape, and these formed a major influencing force in the formation of Afrikaans, particularly in its Malay influence, and its early Jawi literature. Primary of these was the founder of Islam at the Cape, Sheikh Abadin Tadia Tjoessoep (known as Sheikh Yusuf). Hajji Yusuf was an Indonesian noble of royal descent, being the nephew of the Sultan Alauddin of Gowa, in today Makassar, Nusantara. Yusuf, along with 49 followers including two wives, two concubines and twelve children, were received in the Cape on 2 April 1694 by governor Simon van der Stel. They were housed on the farm Zandvliet, far outside of Cape Town, in an attempt to minimise his influence on the VOC&#x27;s slaves. The plan failed however; Yusuf&#x27;s settlement (called Macassar) soon became a sanctuary for slaves and it was here that the first cohesive Islamic community in South Africa was established. From here the message of Islam was disseminated to the slave community of Cape Town, and this population was foundational in the formation of Afrikaans. Of particular note is the Cape Muslim pioneering of the first Afrikaans literature, written in Arabic Afrikaans, which was an adaptation of the Jawi script, using Arabic letters to represent Afrikaans for both religious and quotidian purposes. It also became the de facto national language of the Griqua (Xiri or Griekwa) nation, which was a mixed race group.

Afrikaans is also spoken widely across the centre and north of the country, as a second (or third or even fourth) language by Black or Indigenous South Africans (which, in South Africa, popularly means SiNtu-speaking populations) living in farming areas.

The 2011 census recorded the following distribution of first language speakers:

===Other significant languages in South Africa===
Other languages spoken in South Africa not mentioned in the constitution, include many of those already mentioned above, such as KheLobedu, SiNrebele, SiPhuthi, as well as mixed languages like Fanakalo (a pidgin language used as a lingua franca in the mining industry), and Tsotsitaal or S&#x27;Camtho, an argot that has found wider usage as an informal register.

Many unofficial languages have been variously claimed to be dialects of official languages, which largely follows the apartheid practice of the Bantustans, wherein minority populations were legally assimilated towards the official ethnos of the Bantustan or &quot;Homeland&quot;.

Significant numbers of immigrants from Europe, elsewhere in Africa, China, and the Indian subcontinent (largely as a result of the British Indian indenture system) means that a wide variety of other languages can also be found in parts of South Africa. In the older immigrant communities there are: Greek, Gujarati, Hindi, Portuguese, Tamil, Telugu, Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Urdu, Yiddish, Italian and smaller numbers of Dutch, French and German speakers. Older Chinese tend to speak Cantonese or Hokkien, but recent immigrants mainly speak Mandarin Chinese.

These non-official languages may be used in limited semi-official use where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent. More importantly, these languages have significant local functions in specific communities whose identity is tightly bound around the linguistic and cultural identity that these non-official South African languages signal.

The fastest growing non-official language is Portuguese – first spoken by immigrants from Portugal, especially Madeira and later black and white settlers and refugees from Angola and Mozambique after they won independence from Portugal and now by more recent immigrants from those countries again – and increasingly French, spoken by immigrants and refugees from Francophone Central Africa.

More recently, speakers of North, Central and West Africa languages have arrived in South Africa, mostly in the major cities, especially in Johannesburg and Pretoria, but also Cape Town and Durban.

Angloromani is spoken by the South African Roma minority.

==Constitutional provisions==
Chapter 1 (Founding Provisions), Section 6 (Languages) of the Constitution of South Africa is the basis for government language policy.

The English text of the constitution signed by president Nelson Mandela on 16 December 1996 uses (mostly) the names of the languages expressed in those languages themselves. Sesotho refers to Southern Sotho, and isiNdebele refers to Southern Ndebele. The Interim Constitution of 1993 referred to &quot;Sesotho sa Leboa&quot;, while the 1996 Constitution used &quot;Sepedi&quot; for the title of the Northern Sotho language.

The constitution mentions &quot;sign language&quot; in the generic sense rather than South African Sign Language specifically.

<text>José Carlos Marrone (25 October 1915 in Buenos Aires – 27 June 1990 in Buenos Aires) was an Argentine actor and humorist.

His beginning was in vaudeville theaters and the radio; afterwards he hosted several children-oriented TV shows, such as &quot;El Circo de Marrone&quot; (Marrone&#x27;s Circus), playing the clown character &quot;Pepitito&quot;. His recurring catchphrase was &quot;Cheee!&quot;

He married twice and had his daughter &quot;Coqui&quot;, with his first wife, Rosa. While still married, Marrone fell in love with &quot;Juanita Martínez&quot;, but they waited to get together until Rosa died. 
In 2001, eleven years after Marrone&#x27;s death, Juanita committed suicide, and her body was found with a picture of Marrone in her hands.

&quot;Pepitito&quot; Marrone was one of the most outstanding comedians in Argentina between the early 1950s and the late 1960s.

<doc id="1210030" wikidata="Q409423" url="?curid=1210030" title="Oct-4">
<text>Oct-4 (octamer-binding transcription factor 4), also known as POU5F1 (POU domain, class 5, transcription factor 1), is a protein that in humans is encoded by the &quot;POU5F1&quot; gene. Oct-4 is a homeodomain transcription factor of the POU family. It is critically involved in the self-renewal of undifferentiated embryonic stem cells. As such, it is frequently used as a marker for undifferentiated cells. Oct-4 expression must be closely regulated; too much or too little will cause differentiation of the cells.

 Octamer-binding transcription factor 4, OCT-4, is a transcription factor protein that is encoded by the &quot;POU5F1&quot; gene and is part of the POU (Pit-Oct-Unc) family. OCT-4 consists of an octamer motif, a particular DNA sequence of AGTCAAAT that binds to their target genes and activates or deactivates certain expressions. These gene expressions then lead to phenotypic changes in stem cell differentiation during the development of a mammalian embryo. It plays a vital role in determining the fates of both inner mass cells and embryonic stem cells and has the ability to maintain pluripotency throughout embryonic development. Recently, it has been noted that OCT-4 not only maintains pluripotency in embryonic cells but also has the ability to regulate cancer cell proliferation and can be found in various cancers such as pancreatic, lung, liver and testicular germ cell tumors in adult germ cells. Another defect this gene can have is dysplastic growth in epithelial tissues which are caused by a lack of OCT-4 within the epithelial cells.

==Expression and function==

Oct-4 transcription factor is initially active as a maternal factor in the oocyte and remains active in embryos throughout the preimplantation period. Oct-4 expression is associated with an undifferentiated phenotype and tumors. Gene knockdown of Oct-4 promotes differentiation, demonstrating a role for these factors in human embryonic stem cell self-renewal. Oct-4 can form a heterodimer with Sox2, so that these two proteins bind DNA together.

Mouse embryos that are Oct-4 deficient or have low expression levels of Oct-4 fail to form the inner cell mass, lose pluripotency, and differentiate into trophectoderm. Therefore, the level of Oct-4 expression in mice is vital for regulating pluripotency and early cell differentiation since one of its main functions is to keep the embryo from differentiating.

== Orthologs ==
Orthologs of Oct-4 in humans and other species include:
== Structure ==
Oct-4 contains the following protein domains:
==Implications in disease==
Oct-4 has been implicated in tumorigenesis of adult germ cells. Ectopic expression of the factor in adult mice has been found to cause the formation of dysplastic lesions of the skin and intestine. The intestinal dysplasia resulted from an increase in progenitor cell population and the upregulation of β-catenin transcription through the inhibition of cellular differentiation.

==Pluripotency in embryo development==

=== Animal model ===
In 2000, Niwa et al. used conditional expression and repression in murine embryonic stem cells to determine requirements for Oct-4 in the maintenance of developmental potency. Although transcriptional determination has often been considered as a binary on-off control system, they found that the precise level of Oct-4 governs 3 distinct fates of ES cells. An increase in expression of less than 2-fold causes differentiation into primitive endoderm and mesoderm. In contrast, repression of Oct-4 induces loss of pluripotency and dedifferentiation to trophectoderm. Thus, a critical amount of Oct-4 is required to sustain stem cell self-renewal, and up- or down-regulation induces divergent developmental programs. Changes to Oct-4 levels do not independently promote differentiation, but are also controlled by levels of Sox2. A decrease in Sox2 accompanies increased levels of Oct-4 to promote a mesendodermal fate, with Oct-4 actively inhibiting ectodermal differentiation. Repressed Oct-4 levels that lead to ectodermal differentiation are accompanied by an increase in Sox2, which effectively inhibits mesendodermal differentiation. Niwa et al. suggested that their findings established a role for Oct-4 as a master regulator of pluripotency that controls lineage commitment and illustrated the sophistication of critical transcriptional regulators and the consequent importance of quantitative analyzes.

The transcription factors Oct-4, Sox2, and Nanog are part of a complex regulatory network, with Oct-4 and Sox2 being capable of directly regulating Nanog by binding to its promoter, and are essential for maintaining the self-renewing undifferentiated state of the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, embryonic stem cell lines (which are cell lines derived from the inner cell mass), and induced pluripotent stem cells. While differential up- and down-regulation of Oct-4 and Sox2 has been shown to promote differentiation, down-regulation of Nanog must occur for differentiation to proceed.

==Role in reprogramming==

Oct-4 is one of the transcription factors that is used to create induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), together with Sox2, Klf4, and often c-Myc (OSKM) in mice, demonstrating its capacity to induce an embryonic stem-cell-like state. These factors are often referred to as &quot;Yamanaka reprogramming factors&quot;. This reprogramming effect has also been seen with the Thomson reprogramming factors, reverting human fibroblast cells to iPSCs via Oct-4, along with Sox2, Nanog, and Lin28. The use of Thomson reprogramming factors avoids the need to overexpress c-Myc, an oncogene. It was later determined that only two of these four factors, namely Oct4 and Klf4, are sufficient to reprogram mouse adult neural stem cells. Finally it was shown that a single factor, Oct-4 was sufficient for this transformation. Moreover, while Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc could be replaced by their respective family members, Oct4&#x27;s closer relatives, Oct1 and Oct6, fail to induce pluripotency, thus demonstrating the exclusiveness of Oct4 among POU transcription factors. However, later it was shown that Oct4 could be completely omitted from the Yamanaka cocktail, and the remaining three factors, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc (SKM) could generate mouse iPSCs with dramatically enhanced developmental potential. This suggests that Oct4 increases the efficiency of reprogramming, but decreases the quality of resulting iPSCs.

==In embryonic stem cells==
*In &quot;in vitro&quot; experiments of mouse embryonic stem cells, Oct-4 has often been used as a marker of stemness, as differentiated cells show reduced expression of this marker.
*Oct3/4 can both repress and activate the promoter of &quot;Rex1&quot;. In cells that already express high level of Oct3/4, exogenously transfected Oct3/4 will lead to the repression of Rex1. However, in cells that are not actively expressing Oct3/4, exogenous transfection of Oct3/4 will lead to the activation of Rex1. This implies a dual regulatory ability of Oct3/4 on Rex1. At low levels of the Oct3/4 protein, the Rex1 promoter is activated, while at high levels of the Oct3/4 protein, the Rex1 promoter is repressed.
*Oct4 contributes to the rapid cell cycle of ESCs by promoting progression through the G1 phase, specifically through transcriptional inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21.
*CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of the gene in human embryonic stem cells demonstrated that Oct-4 is essential for the development after fertilisation.
*Oct3/4 represses Suv39h1 expression through the activation of an antisense long non-coding RNA. Suv39h1 inhibition maintains low level of H3K9me3 in pluripotent cells limiting the formation of heterochromatin. 

== In adult stem cells ==

Several studies suggest a role for Oct-4 in sustaining self-renewal capacity of adult somatic stem cells (i.e. stem cells from epithelium, bone marrow, liver, etc.). Other scientists have produced evidence to the contrary, and dismiss those studies as artifacts of &quot;in vitro&quot; culture, or interpreting background noise as signal, and warn about Oct-4 pseudogenes giving false detection of Oct-4 expression.
Oct-4 has also been implicated as a marker of cancer stem cells.

<doc id="1210034" wikidata="Q938176" url="?curid=1210034" title="Tomahawk (band)">
<text>Tomahawk is an American rock supergroup from Nashville, Tennessee. They formed in 1999 when singer/keyboardist Mike Patton (Faith No More, Mr. Bungle) met guitar player Duane Denison (The Jesus Lizard) and the pair started swapping tapes with the intention of collaborating. Denison then recruited drummer John Stanier (Helmet), while Patton invited bass player Kevin Rutmanis (Melvins/ex-Cows). The group recorded three albums and toured extensively from 2000–2007 then went on extended hiatus, and reformed in 2013 with Trevor Dunn replacing Rutmanis.

==History==
===Early days (1999–2000)===
When Faith No More broke up in 1998 Mike Patton created the record label Ipecac Recordings, returned to work with his other band Mr. Bungle, and formed the metal supergroup Fantômas with Buzz Osborne of the Melvins and Dave Lombardo of Slayer. Patton met Duane Denison in 1999 at a Mr. Bungle concert in Nashville and the two began exchanging music and jamming.

===&quot;Tomahawk&quot; (2001–2002)===
During May and June 2001, the band recorded their debut album in Nashville. The album was released on October 30, 2001, it was produced by Joe Funderburk. After the release of &quot;Tomahawk,&quot; the band began touring extensively, playing in many countries around the world, including the United States, Australia, Europe and Japan. They generally headlined shows but were the supporting act for bands such as Tool. When opening for Tool on their 2002 summer tour of North America, the band was frequently booed for insulting the crowds. Tomahawk also played at various festivals, including the 2002 Big Day Out festival in Australia.

===&quot;Mit Gas&quot; (2003–2004)===
Second album &quot;Mit Gas&quot;, recorded with producer Joe Barresi, was released in 2003. Tomahawk took part in the &quot;Geek Tour&quot; during 2003, which featured labelmates the Melvins and Fantômas. During the band&#x27;s early years they were known for dressing up as police officers in promotional photo shoots and during concerts. The band went on a short hiatus from 2004 to 2006 after finishing touring for &quot;Tomahawk&quot; and &quot;Mit Gas&quot; in late 2003 as the members began to focus on other projects.

===&quot;Anonymous&quot; (2007–2008)===
The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Anonymous&quot;, was released on June 19, 2007 through Ipecac Recordings. Kevin Rutmanis left the band during the recording; reasons for his departure are unknown. For the album, Denison and Stanier recorded their parts in Nashville, and then sent their finished product to San Francisco where Patton added his vocals and samples. No live shows were performed during this period. Tomahawk remained inactive from 2008 to 2011.

===&quot;Oddfellows&quot; (2012–2014)===
In July 2011, Mike Patton announced that Tomahawk was preparing to record its fourth album. In early 2012, Tomahawk announced that Trevor Dunn (Mr. Bungle, Fantômas, John Zorn, MadLove, Trevor Dunn&#x27;s Trio-Convulsant) would play bass for the band. On April 21, 2012 the band released &quot;Eponymous To Anonymous&quot;, a box set containing the band&#x27;s first three records released on vinyl for the first time. In late 2012, the band began playing their first live shows since 2003. On December 3, 2012, a full-length video for first single, &quot;Stone Letter&quot;, was posted online. &quot;Oddfellows&quot; was released January 29, 2013. The band were scheduled to play in Mexico for the first time on March 21, 2014 but withdrew due to an illness. On April 9, 2014 the band announced they would be releasing two previously unreleased tracks from the Oddfellows recording session. The single, entitled &quot;M.E.A.T.&quot;, was first released on May 23, 2014 on vinyl.

===&quot;Tonic Immobility&quot; (2020–present)===
In February 2020, Duane Denison revealed that Tomahawk had been writing and recording new record material. On January 21, 2021, a single called &quot;Business Casual&quot; was released, which also revealed the name of their upcoming fifth album as &quot;Tonic Immobility&quot;, which has later been released on March 26, 2021. Bassist Trevor Dunn remarked in 2021, &quot;Me and Duane [Denison] and John [Stanier] recorded all of our parts for that record about four years ago actually. Duane had finished the music and I guess Mike was busy at the time, so John and I flew down to Nashville and recorded with Duane. Then over the years, we&#x27;ve just been waiting for Mike, and he&#x27;s been doing other stuff so it took a while. I think the pandemic kind of helped spur it along because he was stuck at home, so he wrote the vocal melodies and the rest of the lyrics at his studio in San Francisco.&quot;

==Musical style and influences==
Several critics have described Tomahawk&#x27;s style as alternative metal, alternative rock, avant-garde metal, and experimental rock. Their sound has also been labeled as art rock, avant-prog, noise rock, post-rock, progressive metal, and progressive rock. In 2002, the band considered their genre to be &quot;cinematic rock&quot;, since all members were fans of film soundtracks. Butch Lazorchak of the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; has compared the band&#x27;s sound to 1970s hard rock groups such as Blue Öyster Cult.

The band&#x27;s self-titled first album combines rock with elements of experimental music, country music, and hardcore; critic Blake Butler of Allmusic described their debut album as one of the most straightforward rock-oriented projects of Patton following his work with Faith No More, but he still notes their eclectic side stating that they are not a “mass-marketable band.” Their second album &quot;Mit Gas&quot; features influences from metal as well as punk rock. The album also includes instrumental segues. The band&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Anonymous&quot; incorporates Native American music elements. &quot;Oddfellows&quot; features a more accessible sound which the band has labeled as &quot;avant-pop&quot;. The record includes influences from jazz music.

The band&#x27;s first music video was for &quot;Rape This Day&quot; from &quot;Mit Gas&quot;, featuring a cameo from Queens of the Stone Age&#x27;s Nick Oliveri. No official music videos were released for &quot;Anonymous&quot;. For the release of &quot;Oddfellows&quot; in 2013 the band made music videos for &quot;Stone Letter&quot; and the title-track. In August 2014, over a year after the release of &quot;Oddfellows&quot;, the band released a music video for &quot;South Paw&quot;. In addition to the band&#x27;s four official music videos, there have also been a number of unofficial/fan-made videos.

<text>Ikkemotubbe is a fictional Chickasaw Indian chief living in Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi. He appears in novels and short stories of William Faulkner, such as in the collection of stories titled &quot;III The Wilderness&quot;: &quot;Red Leaves,&quot; &quot;A Justice,&quot; and &quot;A Courtship&quot;. He is referenced extensively in Faulkner&#x27;s popular classic &#x27;The Bear&quot; as the original owner of the land that was sold to Carothers McCaslin, the first white landowner of the woods in which the story takes place. After a steamboat trip to New Orleans, his name is &quot;Frenchified&quot; to &quot;L&#x27;Homme&quot; or &quot;De l&#x27;Homme&quot; (&#x27;The Man&#x27;), which he himself later re-Anglicizes to &quot;Doom&quot;.

<text>Iva Yeo (born June 5, 1939 in Winnipeg, Manitoba) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. She was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 1990, representing the Winnipeg riding of Sturgeon Creek for the Manitoba Liberal Party.

==Background==
The daughter of Arthur W.S. Hay and Irene Stewart, she was educated at the Winnipeg General Hospital and the University of Saskatchewan, and worked as a nurse educator at the St. Boniface School for Practical Nurses, as well as working in student affairs at St. Boniface Schools of Nursing. In 1961, she married Dr. Thomas Archie Yeo.

==Political career==
She served as a school trustee in the 1980s, in the district of Silver Heights-Booth.
In the provincial election of 1988, she defeated incumbent Progressive Conservative Frank Johnston by 659 votes in Sturgeon Creek. The Manitoba Liberals increased their parliamentary representation from one to twenty in this election, and Yeo sat in the official opposition for the next two years. In the 1990 provincial election, she lost to Tory Gerry McAlpine by 769 votes amid a general loss of support for her party.

<text>The Lauwers () is a river in the Netherlands. It forms part of the border between the provinces of Friesland and Groningen. From the 730s to Widukind&#x27;s defeat in 785, it was part of the border of the Frankish Empire.

The former Lauwerszee and the present-day Lauwersmeer are both named after the river, which as a small stream has its source southeast of the village of Surhuisterveen. Near Gerkesklooster/Stroobos, it crosses the Prinsesmargrietkanaal/van Starkenborghkanaal.

The Lauwers achieves the width of a true river at the place that it gains its tributary, the Oude Vaart, near the Schalkendam. Further along its course, the Lauwers splits into two branches, the Frisian Oude Lauwers and the Zijldiep, in Groningen province.

The Lauwers meets the sea at the Wadden Sea, emptying into a channel between the islands of Schiermonnikoog and Rottumerplaat/Rottumeroog, which can be viewed as the continuation of the river.

<text>The Lengue language, also called Molengue,Balengue,Molendji, is a Bantu language of southern Equatorial Guinea, spoken by the Lengue people between Bata and the Gabon border near the coast. The speakers have come under increasing Fang influence. The Ethnologue describes it as a member of the B subgroup of Northwest Bantu, while Echegaray is more specific, saying that it is linguistically a member of the Sheke group (B21 of Guthrie&#x27;s Bantu subclassification):
: &quot;The Balengues – linguistically at least – are related to the Sheke group in general, and especially to Itemus and Nvikos.&quot; (p. 51)

Echegaray lists their main settlements as being located south of Bata between Punta Nguba and the Benito River, as well as three before the Ndote River, and a few further south or inland.

<text>Helen Elizabeth Buckingham (born 17 November 1952) is a retired Australian politician. She was the Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 2002 to 2006, representing Koonung Province. She is the daughter of former state Labor leader Frank Wilkes, and a former teacher and local councillor.

==Early life==
Buckingham was born in Melbourne, and went to secondary school in the suburb of Preston, but switched to the selective University High School for her final year. She studied teaching at La Trobe University, and took up her first position teaching history and politics at the somewhat underprivileged Pascoe Vale Girls High School. She taught there from 1975 to 1982, and then worked for a time at the private Mount Scopus College. From 1987, she taught at Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College, and worked there until retiring from teaching in 1991. She took up a position as a careers counsellor the following year.

==Politics==
Buckingham was actively involved in a number of community organisations, and was on the board of Box Hill Hospital for several years,http://www.easternhealth.org.au/boxhill/bhh.html as well as being a member of the Monash University Department of Physiology&#x27;s Animal Ethics Committee. In 1997, Buckingham made a bid to be elected as a councillor for the City of Whitehorse, and was ultimately successful.

She became mayor the following year, and served for two years in this capacity. Buckingham was not re-elected as mayor in 2000, but continued to serve as a councillor. She stood as the Labor candidate for the federal seat of Deakin at the 2001 election, and was thought to have a chance of winning it. However, the 2001 election was not successful for Labor, and Buckingham was defeated.

Her second bid for political office was to be more successful. She switched from federal to state politics, and won pre-selection for the Legislative Council seat of Koonung Province at the 2002 election. It was held by a strong margin by sitting Liberal member Gerald Ashman, but the election resulted in a significant landslide victory for Labor, and Buckingham soundly defeated Ashman, even before the distribution of preferences.

She was instrumental in reforms to the regulation of Victorian Bodies Corporate. She also played a strong role on the Parliament&#x27;s All-Party Education Committee. She also focused on local issues such as preventing the closure of the Angliss Hospital. She served on the Legislative Council Privileges Committees.

Her term was marred by a serious illness which forced her to take leave for the second half of 2004. She returned to her duties in 2005 . While on holiday in England during the year, she found herself caught up in the 7 July 2005 London bombings; she was on a train in front of one of those bombed.

Buckingham retired at the 2006 election.

==Honours==
Buckingham was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in 2018.

<doc id="1210059" wikidata="Q5223239" url="?curid=1210059" title="Dark Future">
<text>Dark Future is a post-apocalyptic miniatures wargame published by Games Workshop in 1988.

==Description==
&quot;Dark Future&quot; is a &quot;Mad Max&quot;-like game of vehicular combat set in an alternate world.

===Setting===
The game is set in a fictional alternate world United States in 1995, ten years after the American government privatised all police forces. The country has been divided into Policed Zones — mainly large cities — and Non-Policed Zones, mainly the highways and areas between cities. Ecological disaster has overtaken the country as well, with the Great Lakes having shrunk to a fraction of their size, and the Midwest turned into a desert. The players take on the role of mercenaries called &quot;Sanctioned Operatives&quot; or &quot;Ops&quot;, who are hired for a variety of missions on the unpoliced highways.

===Game Components=== 
The large 36&quot; box comes with: 
* 104-page 2-holed punched illustrated rulebook with perforated pages
* &quot;Read Me First&quot; quickplay rules
* 17 sections of interlocking laminated track
* 4 plastic cars with interchangeable weapons
* 4 plastic motorcycles
* markers
* counters
* acetate range ruler
* three six-sided dice, one slightly larger than the others
* two ziplock bags for counter storage

===Gameplay===
Vehicles can move at their rated speed each turn, and can accomplish a variety of actions while moving including drifting, U-turning, accelerating, braking, reversing, regaining control, ramming, and firing weapons.

===Scenarios===
The book includes eight scenarios of increasing tactical complexity.

==Publication history==
In the late 1980s, GW game designer Marc Gascoigne was designing a post-apocalyptic role-playing game called &quot;Dark Future&quot; that was set in the United States. At the same time, Richard Halliwell was designing a miniatures vehicular combat board game using many of the rules he had developed for the &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; board game &quot;Slaughter Margin&quot;. When Gascoigne&#x27;s role-playing game project was shelved, his post-apocalyptic setting in the United States was grafted onto Halliwell&#x27;s vehicular combat game. The merger, featuring artwork by Tony Ackland, Dave Andrews, John Blanche, Mark Craven, Carl Critchlow, Colin Dixon, David Gallagher, Pete Knifton, Mike McVey, Tim Pollard, Bil Segwick, Andrew Wildman, and Nick Williams, was published by GW in 1988 as &quot;Dark Future&quot;. At the same time, Citadel Miniatures released a line of metal miniatures that could be used with the game.

Later the same year, GW also published a game expansion, &quot;White Line Fever&quot;, that featured more vehicles and weapons, and more tactics.

Several more rules expansions and scenarios were also published in various issues of &quot;White Dwarf&quot;.

In 1990, GW published an anthology of &quot;Dark Future&quot; short stories titled &quot;Route 666&quot;, and then published a number of &quot;Dark Future&quot; novels, supposedly penned by a Sanctioned Operative named &quot;Jack Yeovil&quot;, but actually written by Kim Newman. In 1993, Boxtree Ltd published a number of new &quot;Dark Futures&quot; novels, also written by Newman under the name &quot;Jack Yeovil&quot;. In 2005, Black Flame published a number of new novels as well as republishing some of the original GW and Boxtree novels.

In May 2019, a video game adaptation, &quot;Dark Future: Blood Red States&quot;, was released. According to the review aggregate website Metacritic, it received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

==Reception==
In the September 1989 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 149), Jim Bambra admired the physical components of the game, which he called &quot;impressive.&quot; He concluded, &quot;gamers looking for a fast-playing game of highway combat will find the &quot;Dark Future&quot; game worthy of recommendation.&quot;

In the April–May 1990 edition of &quot;Challenge&quot; (#43), John Theisen liked the simple game mechanics and the high-quality game components. But, considering the very high price of the game ($48 in 1990), he was disappointed &quot;by a lack of versatility in design. There are only three types of vehicle and only 16 types of weapon.&quot; He pointed out that more vehicles and weapons were available in the &quot;White Line Fever&quot; supplement, but said, &quot;as a customer, I&#x27;d be pretty perturbed to find myself shelling out 48 bucks only to find out that I need to spend another $16(!) to get what should have been included in the first place.&quot; Theisen concluded, &quot;All in all, &quot;Dark Future&quot; is a good game — but not a great one.&quot;

In the February–March 1989 edition of &quot;Games&quot;, Matthew Costello called it &quot;fast-paced, straight-forward in its Mad Max confrontations. And I hope that all of this automotive mayhem is therapeutic. Because it certainly is fun&quot;.

<text>The I-class destroyers were a group of nine destroyers, including a flotilla leader, built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s. Four similar ships were ordered by the Turkish Navy, of which two were purchased for the Royal Navy, bringing the number of these ships in British service to 11—although three of the original ships had been lost by the time &quot;Inconstant&quot; and &quot;Ithuriel&quot; were commissioned. The I-class served in World War II and six were lost, with a seventh ship being written off.

==Design==
The I-class was a repeat of the preceding H class, except that they had ten torpedo tubes (two banks of five) instead of eight. They incorporated the new bridge and wheelhouse layout as tested in and (except the flotilla leader &quot;Inglefield&quot;). &quot;Inglefield&quot; also had a larger tripod foremast, her sisters having pole masts. The extra weight of the torpedo tubes and the fitting of minesweeps and depth charge gear (previous vessels carried one or the other) on the same hull as the H class, caused a loss of stability, needing ballast when bunker levels were low.

All ships were fitted for minesweeping and with depth charges and Asdic for anti-submarine (A/S) work and were capable of conversion to minelayers. For this, they landed &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; 4.7 inch guns, the torpedo tubes and their minesweeps, allowing carriage of up to 60 mines but only four ships were used like this (see below).

===Ships built for Turkey===
The Turkish I-class ships were of a similar design to their British counterparts but shipped only eight torpedoes (two banks of four) like the British H class.

===Wartime modifications===
Early war modifications involved replacing the after bank of torpedoes with a QF 12-pounder (3 inch/76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) gun, cutting down the after funnel and mainmast to improve its field of fire and adding a pair of QF 20 mm Oerlikon guns in the bridge wings. Radar Type 286, a metric wavelength surface-warning set, was added as it became available and the ineffective multiple Vickers machine guns were replaced with Oerlikons; the central tube was deleted from the torpedo launchers to lessen topweight. &quot;Icarus&quot; lost &#x27;Y&#x27; gun to stow extra depth charges (for a total load of 110) and their mortars. Surviving ships received a third pair of Oerlikons, added abreast the searchlight position and the 12-pounder was deleted to increase depth charge stowage. In some ships, &#x27;A&#x27; gun was replaced with a Hedgehog forward-throwing A/S weapon but this alteration seems to have been reversed at a later stage. &quot;Ilex&quot;, &quot;Intrepid&quot;, &quot;Impulsive&quot; and &quot;Isis&quot; had &#x27;B&#x27; gun removed and two QF 6-pounder 10 cwt (2.25 inch/57 mm L/47) guns were added on the twin mounting Mark I* along with a Hedgehog, the former for anti-E boat work.

&quot;Inglefield&quot; later had the second bank of torpedo tubes re-instated but like her sisters, the central tube was removed. A AA gun was added instead of &#x27;X&#x27; gun and she had six Oerlikons. Type 291 radar was later added at the foremast head as well as Huff-Duff in some ships.

The ex-Turkish ships were modified along similar lines to their I-class sisters. &quot;Inconstant&quot; later received Type 270 radar, a centimetric wavelength target-indication set, in place of the director and rangefinder on the bridge. Again, eventually, six Oerlikons were carried.

==Ships==

===Turkish ships===
Four ships were ordered for the Turkish Navy in 1938. Upon the outbreak of war, two were purchased by the British but two were delivered to Turkey in 1942 as the &quot;Sultanhisar&quot; and the &quot;Demirhisar&quot;.

<text>Richard Kozak (born September 20, 1949 in Saint Boniface, Manitoba) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 1990, representing the eastern Winnipeg riding of Transcona for the Manitoba Liberal Party.

Kozak was educated in Political Science at the University of Winnipeg, French at Université Laval and Political Economy at the University of Toronto. He worked as a financial planner before entering political life.

In the Manitoba provincial election of 1988, Kozak was elected in Transcona over incumbent New Democrat Wilson Parasiuk by 709 votes. The seat had previously been regarded as safe for the NDP. The Liberals increased their parliamentary strength from one to twenty in this election, and Kozak served as his party&#x27;s Finance Critic and Deputy House Leader for the next two years. Support for the NDP rebounded in the 1990 provincial election, and Kozak lost to NDP candidate Daryl Reid by almost 2000 votes. He has not sought a return to political life since this time.

<text>Captain Edward Kinder Bradbury VC (16 August 1881 – 1 September 1914) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Bradbury was an officer in the British Army during the First World War where as second-in-command of L Battery, Royal Horse Artillery he led the battery during an engagement at Néry during the Retreat from Mons on 1 September 1914, where he was killed in action. For the gallantry at Néry, he and two other men were awarded the Victoria Cross.

==Early career==
Born in August 1881, in Altrincham, Cheshire, he was the son of James Kinder Bradbury and Grace Dowling. He attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, as a cadet, passing out to join the Royal Artillery as a second lieutenant on 2 May 1900. He was promoted to full lieutenant on 3 April 1901, and in January 1902 was seconded for service with the Imperial Yeomanry in South Africa for the Second Boer War, and appointed a lieutenant with the 31st Battalion. The war ended six months later, and Bradbury resigned his appointment in the Imperial Yeomanry in November 1902, returning to the Royal Artillery, and left Port Natal for Aden on the SS &quot;Dominion&quot; the same month. He was posted to the 127th Battery RFA in 1904.

In early 1905 he was seconded to duties with the Foreign Office, during which time he appears to have served with the King&#x27;s African Rifles. He returned to a regimental post in 1907, received his captaincy in 1910, and became an adjutant in February 1912, returning to normal duties in November.

Bradbury rode his horse &quot;Sloppy Weather&quot; in the 1909 Royal Artillery Gold Cup, coming third; another of his horses, &quot;Hot Water&quot;, competed in the 1911 Punchestown Festival, again coming third.

==First World War==

Bradbury was 33 years old, and a captain in the &#x27;L&#x27; Bty., Royal Horse Artillery (Royal Artillery), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 1 September 1914 at Néry, France, during a fierce attack by the enemy, when all the officers of &#x27;L&#x27; Battery were either killed or wounded, Captain Bradbury along with Sergeant Major Dorrell and Sergeant Nelson, continued the lone resistance against the German attack. Although having had one leg taken off by a shell while fetching ammunition, Bradbury continued to direct the fire of the battery until he died.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Imperial War Museum in London, England.

<text>The Little Rascals is a 1994 American family comedy film produced by Amblin Entertainment, and released by Universal Pictures on August 5, 1994. The film is an adaptation of Hal Roach&#x27;s &quot;Our Gang&quot;, a series of short films of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s (many of which were broadcast on television as &quot;The Little Rascals&quot;) which centered on the adventures of a group of neighborhood children. Directed by Penelope Spheeris, who co-wrote the screenplay with Paul Guay and Stephen Mazur, the film presents several of the &quot;Our Gang&quot; characters in an updated setting, featuring re-interpretations of several of the original shorts. It is the first collaboration by Guay and Mazur, whose subsequent comedies were &quot;Liar Liar&quot; and &quot;Heartbreakers&quot;.

A sequel, &quot;The Little Rascals Save the Day&quot;, also based on &quot;Our Gang&quot;, was released as a direct-to-video feature in 2014.

==Plot==
Spanky McFarland is the president of the &quot;He-Man Womun Haters Club&quot; with many school-aged boys from around the neighborhood as members. His best friend, Alfalfa, has been chosen as the driver for the club&#x27;s prize-winning undefeated go-kart, &quot;The Blur&quot;, in the annual Soap Box Derby style race. However, when the announcement is made, Alfalfa is nowhere to be found.

The boys catch Alfalfa in the company of Darla. The club&#x27;s members try their hardest to break the two apart, eventually causing their beloved clubhouse to burn down. Darla is mistakenly led to believe Alfalfa feels ashamed of her, so she turns her attention to Waldo, the new rich kid whose father is an oil tycoon. Spanky, Stymie and friends judge Alfalfa&#x27;s punishment to be left guarding the go-kart around the clock until the day of the race (in addition, he is also forbidden from ever having any contact with Darla). Until that day comes, Alfalfa makes many attempts to woo back Darla including a visit to her ballet rehearsal, an undelivered love letter, and through serenade, all of which fail.

In order to rebuild their clubhouse, the boys try to fund-raise the cost of lumber, $450, but the youngest ones, Porky and Buckwheat, have unknowingly come up with $500. Their school teacher, Miss Crabtree, finds out about the scheme, but Spanky convinces her to use the funds as prize money for the go-kart derby. Later that day, Alfalfa and Spanky get into a heated argument when Alfalfa finds out that Spanky is the reason for his breakup with Darla which causes Alfalfa to quit as a club member.

&quot;The Blur&quot; is stolen by local bullies Butch and Woim. In addition to having to rebuild the clubhouse, the boys now need a new set of wheels. They band together to build &quot;The Blur 2: The Sequel.&quot; Prior to race day, Spanky and Alfalfa reconcile and decide to ride in the two-seat go-kart together. They hope to win the prize money and the trophy, to be presented to the victors by the greatest racer of all, &quot;A.J. Ferguson.&quot;

Butch and Woim make several sneaky attempts to stop Alfalfa and Spanky from winning the race. Waldo, who (seemingly) kicks out Darla from his race car, pulls a few tricks of his own. &quot;The Blur 2&quot; crosses the finish line ahead of the pack (and resulting in a photo-finish between &quot;The Blur&quot; and &quot;The Blur 2&quot; literally &quot;by a hair&quot; due to Alfalfa&#x27;s cowlick), despite the many scrapes and crashes throughout the derby. When Butch and Woim try to fight with Alfalfa, he knocks Butch into pig slop, with Woim throwing himself in.

Along with first prize, Alfalfa also wins back Darla&#x27;s heart after it turns out that Darla kicked Waldo out of the car instead of the opposite. Spanky, meanwhile, is shocked at the trophy presentation when he finally meets his favorite driver, A.J. Ferguson, whom he learns is a woman. As soon as the club house is rebuilt, the boys collectively have a change of heart toward membership and welcome Darla and friends to their club, with &quot;Women Welcome&quot; added to the sign.

At the end of the movie, it is revealed that Uh-Huh can say more than simply &quot;Uh-Huh.&quot; The movie closes with bloopers from the kids while filming.

==Production==
Bill Thomas Jr., son of the late Billie &quot;Buckwheat&quot; Thomas, contacted the studio and was invited down to visit the set, but got the impression that the filmmakers did not want him or any of the surviving original cast members involved in any production capacity. The surviving cast members saw this as especially hurtful, in light of the fact that director Penelope Spheeris had previously made a point of including Buddy Ebsen, from the original &quot;Beverly Hillbillies&quot;, in her 1993 feature film adaptation of that series. Eugene Jackson, who played the original Pineapple from the silent &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedies, tried unsuccessfully to contact the studio to be a part of production, stated, &quot;It&#x27;s real cold. They have no respect for the old-timers. At least they could have recognized some of the living legends surviving from the first films.&quot; Filming took place from January 11, 1994 to April 6, 1994.

==Release==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 21% based on reviews from 14 critics as of December 2022. On Metacritic it has a score of 45 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A−&quot; on scale of A to F.

Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety magazine&quot; wrote: &quot;Those who grew up watching &quot;The Little Rascals&quot; may well be intrigued by the idea of introducing their kids to this full-color, bigscreen version. Still, the challenge of stretching those mildly diverting shorts to feature length remains formidable, and one has to wonder whether an audience exists beyond nostalgic parents and their young children.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;The Little Rascals&quot; earned $10 million at the North American box office during its opening weekend, ranking in fourth place behind &quot;Clear and Present Danger&quot;, &quot;The Mask&quot; and &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;. The film grossed a worldwide total of $67,308,282.

==Home media==
&quot;The Little Rascals&quot; was released on VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray in 1995, 2004, and 2014 respectively.

<text>The Little Rascals is a 30-minute Saturday morning animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and King World Productions. It first aired on ABC on September 25, 1982. A spin-off based on the live-action &quot;Our Gang&quot; comedy shorts, it was broadcast as part of &quot;The Pac-Man/Little Rascals/Richie Rich Show&quot; in 1982 and then as part of &quot;The Monchhichis/Little Rascals/Richie Rich Show&quot; in 1983.

The characters were designed by Iwao Takamoto and Bob Singer by using tracing paper on top of actual photographs of the real-life characters, and using a pencil to sketch the characters. The same technique was also used in previous Hanna-Barbera spin-offs such as &quot;The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang&quot; and &quot;Laverne and Shirley in the Army&quot;.

== Overview ==
=== Previous &quot;Little Rascals&quot;/&quot;Our Gang&quot; animated television programs ===
&quot;The Little Rascals&quot; had been animated for television twice before. In the 1960s, a series of nine clay-animated &quot;Little Rascals Color Specials&quot; were produced for syndication, presumably by Bura and Hardwick, the British studio responsible for &quot;Camberwick Green&quot;, using soundtracks from the original &quot;Our Gang&quot; films. The episodes include &quot;Shiver My Timbers&quot;, &quot;Our Gang Follies of 1936&quot;, &quot;Second Childhood&quot;, &quot;Hearts Are Thumps&quot;, &quot;Came the Brawn&quot;, &quot;Bear Shooters&quot;, &quot;Readin&#x27; and Writin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;The Pinch Singer&quot;, and &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Beau&quot;.

In 1979, Fred Wolf produced an animated &quot;The Little Rascals Christmas Special&quot; for NBC. That company&#x27;s version was further used in animated public service announcements.

=== Differences between the animated series and the live-action &quot;Our Gang&quot; films ===
The animated series and the original live-action &quot;Our Gang&quot; films differ in a number of ways. The gang now lives in a contemporary 1980s setting, with computers and television. Buckwheat is now a clever inventor and is interested in science, always creating new devices for the gang, and Darla&#x27;s eyes were changed from hazel to blue (although this detail was trivial given that all of the &quot;Our Gang&quot; shorts were in black-and-white). Also in the animated series, the Rascals met in a treehouse and drove around the town of Greenpoint in a dog-drawn vehicle. Also, the theme music was completely different. Furthermore, many characters such as Stymie don&#x27;t appear.

== Lawsuit ==
In March 1984, &quot;Our Gang&quot; actor Eugene Lee, who had played Porky in the original theatrical short films as a child from 1935 to 1939, sued Hanna-Barbera Productions for nearly $2 million, claiming that the animated character was a violation of his likeness rights. He was joined in the lawsuit by other former &quot;Our Gang&quot; kids: George McFarland, who had played Spanky, Tommy Bond, who had played Butch, and Sidney Kibrick, who had played The Woim. Carl Switzer, Darla Hood and Billie Thomas, who had played Alfalfa, Darla and Buckwheat respectively were already deceased. It was found that Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s license from King World did not include the likeness rights of the former child actors, and the case was settled out of court.

Following the lawsuit, ABC stopped airing reruns of the show, and the show would not be picked up for syndication anywhere, including Cartoon Network and Boomerang. This even prevented Warner Bros. Discovery from releasing the show on DVD as confirmed in 2016.

== Other languages ==
The French dub for Antenne 2, &quot;Les Petites Canailles&quot;, replaced the original theme music with a new theme song, performed by a chorus of children over a montage of clips from both the theatrical &quot;Our Gang&quot; shorts and the animated shorts.

== Episode titles ==
=== Season 1 (1982) ===
Aired as part of &quot;The Pac-Man/Little Rascals/Richie Rich Show&quot;.

=== Season 2 (1983) ===
Aired as part of &quot;The Monchhichis/Little Rascals/Richie Rich Show&quot;

&quot;Tiny Terror&quot;, &quot;Class Act&quot;, &quot;Porky-O and Julie-Et&quot; and &quot;Cap&#x27;n Spanky&#x27;s Showboat&quot;, previously aired during the first season, were rebroadcast on October 8 and 22, and November 5 and 26, 1983 respectively.

<text>Brian Patten (born 7 February 1946) is an English poet and author. He came to prominence in the 1960s as one of the Liverpool poets, and writes primarily lyrical poetry about human relationships. His famous works include &quot;Little Johnny&#x27;s Confessions&quot;, &quot;The Irrelevant Song&quot;, &quot;Vanishing Trick&quot;, &quot;Emma&#x27;s Doll&quot;, and &quot;Impossible Parents&quot;.

==Career==
Patten was born in Bootle, Liverpool, England. He attended Sefton Park School in the Smithdown Road area of Liverpool, where his early poetic writing was encouraged. He left school at fifteen and began work for &quot;The Bootle Times&quot; writing a column on popular music. At age 18, he moved to Paris, where he lived rough for a time, earning money by writing poems in chalk on the pavements. 

Together with the other two Liverpool poets, Roger McGough and Adrian Henri, Patten published &quot;The Mersey Sound&quot; in 1967. One of the best-selling poetry anthologies of modern times, &quot;The Mersey Sound&quot; aimed to make poetry accessible to a broader audience. It has been described as &quot;the most significant anthology of the twentieth century&quot;. Together with Henri and McGough, Patten was awarded the Freedom of the City of Liverpool in 2001.

Patten&#x27;s first published volumes of poems were &quot;Little Johnny&#x27;s Confession&quot; (1967) and &quot;Notes to the Hurrying Man&quot; (1969). They were followed by &quot;The Irrelevant Song&quot; (1971), &quot;Vanishing Trick&quot; (1976) and &quot; Grave Gossip&quot; (1979). In 1983, along with Roger McGough and Adrian Henri, Patten published the follow-up to &quot;The Mersey Sound&quot; with &quot;New Volume&quot;. Patten&#x27;s later solo collections, &quot;Storm Damage&quot; (1988) and &quot;Armada&quot; (1996), are more varied, the latter featuring a sequence of poems concerning the death of his mother and memories of his childhood. &quot;Armada&quot; is perhaps Patten&#x27;s most mature and formal book, dispensing with much of the playfulness of former work. He has also written comic verse for children, notably &quot;Gargling With Jelly&quot; and &quot;Thawing Frozen Frogs&quot;.

Patten&#x27;s style is generally lyrical and his subjects are primarily love and relationships. His 1986 collection &quot;Love Poems&quot; draws together his best work in this area from the previous sixteen years. Charles Causley commented that he &quot;reveals a sensibility profoundly aware of the ever-present possibility of the magical and the miraculous, as well as of the granite-hard realities. These are undiluted poems, beautifully calculated, informed - even in their darkest moments - with courage and hope.&quot;

The actor Paul Bettany, in his contribution to the poetry collection &quot;Poems That Make Grown Men Cry&quot; (2014), said of Patten&#x27;s work: &quot;Reading Brian Patten&#x27;s poetry does that trick that art should do, which is to sort of adhere you to the surface of the planet, just long enough that you don&#x27;t go spinning off into the loneliness of space - &#x27;Somebody else has felt this too&#x27;, you think. And you breathe a little easier&quot;.

Patten&#x27;s poem &quot;So Many Different Lengths of Time&quot; has, in recent times, become a popular poem recited at funerals. At the service to remember Ken Dodd in Liverpool&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral, the actor Stephanie Cole read &quot;So Many Different Lengths of Time&quot; to a congregation of thousands within and outside the building. Opening his poem with verse by Pablo Neruda, Patten&#x27;s poem argues that it is the act of remembrance which offers family members the best antidote to the anguish of loss. In tackling the subject of grief, Patten views poetry as performing an important social function: &quot;Poetry helps us understand what we’ve forgotten to remember. It reminds us of things that are important to us when the world overtakes us emotionally.&quot;

<text>Roger of Salerno (or Roger of the Principate) ( 1080 – June 28, 1119) was regent of the Principality of Antioch from 1112 to 1119.
He was the son of Richard of the Principate and the 2nd cousin of Tancred, Prince of Galilee, both participants on the First Crusade. He became regent of Antioch when Tancred died in 1112; the actual prince, Bohemond II, was still a child. Like Tancred, Roger was almost constantly at war with the nearby Muslim states such as Aleppo. In 1114 there was an earthquake that destroyed many of the fortifications of the principality, and Roger took great care to rebuild them, especially those near the frontier.

Roger defeated Bursuq ibn Bursuq in 1115 at the Battle of Tell Danith. With Joscelin I of Edessa, Roger put enough military pressure on Aleppo that the city allied with Ortoqid emir Ilghazi in 1118. Ilghazi invaded the Principality in 1119, and despite the urging of the Patriarch, Roger did not wait for reinforcements from Jerusalem or Tripoli. At the ensuing Battle of Ager Sanguinis (&quot;The battle of the Field of Blood&quot;) he had 700 knights and 3000 foot soldiers, including 500 Armenian cavalry, but nearly all were killed, including Roger himself. Ilghazi&#x27;s forces scattered to plunder the surrounding land and did not attack Antioch itself. Baldwin II of Jerusalem came north to take over the regency of the principality.

He married Cecilia of Le Bourcq, daughter of Hugh I, Count of Rethel and sister of Baldwin II. No children of this union are recorded. Roger&#x27;s reign was chronicled by his chancellor Walter.

Roger is also known in numismatic history for the unique series of coins, minted during his reign. Despite ruling for less than seven years, he had two different types of coin, minted in his name at Antioch. The first type bore the image of the Mother of God Orans, standing full-height. The second type bore the image of the Miracle of Saint George and the Dragon. It is quite possible that it was minted after Roger&#x27;s great victory at the Battle of Tell Danith. Prince Roger was in fact the first ruler in the Christian world to depict the Miracle of Saint George and the Dragon on his coinage.

<doc id="1210110" wikidata="Q289793" url="?curid=1210110" title="Holly McPeak">
<text>Holly McPeak (born May 15, 1969) is an American retired indoor and beach volleyball player. McPeak was three-times an Olympian in beach volleyball. In the professional circuit, she garnered 72 career beach volleyball titles, with career earnings of US$1.4 million. She is ranked third in titles won (behind Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh) and second in career earnings (behind May-Treanor) for female professional beach volleyball players. She won a bronze medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics with partner Elaine Youngs. Though McPeak was considered short for a beach volleyball player at 5 feet 7 inches in height, she was one of the toughest players to beat on the tour.

==Early life and college career==
McPeak was born and raised in Manhattan Beach, California. She attended Mira Costa High School. While there she was a member of two CIF 5-A champion volleyball teams. During her junior year in the fall of 1985 the Mustangs went undefeated en route to winning the state championship, finishing the season with a record of 29–0. In 1986 Mira Costa again went undefeated through the regular season and reached the championship match before losing in the finals to the Hueneme High School Vikings. The team finished with a 23–1 mark. Mira Costa head coach Dae Lea Aldrich, who had led the Mustangs to three state championships, two No. 1 national rankings, eight CIF titles and two state finals over a ten-year period, offered the following on McPeak: &quot;She&#x27;s a workaholic. She&#x27;s a great athlete who will do anything you ask, and she&#x27;ll do it twice as hard. She&#x27;s the girl that does the extra mile and the extra lifting in the off season.&quot;

McPeak was a three-time All-Ocean League and All-Southern Section setter at Mira Costa. Though short in stature at 5&#x27;7&quot;, she was heavily recruited. Volleyball Monthly magazine called her &quot;the most coveted setter in the country.&quot; Among McPeak&#x27;s top choices were scholarship offers from the UCLA Bruins and the Golden Bears of the University of California, Berkeley.

McPeak chose to attend college at UC Berkeley for its academic excellence. At Cal, McPeak was named Pacific 10 Conference freshman of the year in 1987. At the conclusion of McPeak&#x27;s freshman year Cal head coach Marlene Piper moved to teach and coach at UC Davis, and was replaced by Dave DeGroot. The coaching change was problematic for the intense McPeak, who found DeGroot unwilling or unable to push the team. For his part DeGroot was not happy with how McPeak was setting the team. Commenting at the time, fellow Bear teammate Lisa Arce, who had played with McPeak at both Mira Costa High and Berkeley, said &quot;Holly is definitely a competitor. She&#x27;s not one to lose. She always plays to win, whether its a drill, a scrimmage or a game.&quot; McPeak continued playing at Cal under DeGroot, leading the Golden Bears to two more playoff berths, making it three tournament appearances in three years. However McPeak&#x27;s conflict with the Cal head coach escalated to the point of an impasse. After her junior season in 1989 DeGroot banned McPeak from the team. She could continue her studies at Berkeley under scholarship, but she was not allowed to practice or play for the volleyball team.

Believing her college career was over, McPeak resigned herself to focusing on her academics. However, a teammate encouraged her to consider transferring. The one other school she wanted to play for was UCLA. However, Pacific-10 conference policy required a transferring athlete to sit out two years before they can compete at another conference school. McPeak spoke with UCLA head coach Andy Banachowski, who noted she was in a special circumstance as her scholarship school had banned her from further participation. McPeak submitted a challenge to the transfer policy. To win the appeal, McPeak&#x27;s case had to be approved by faculty athletic representatives from each of the league&#x27;s 10 institutions. With Banachowski&#x27;s help, McPeak succeeded in gaining the support of the athletic representatives from all 10 conference schools, including those from the University of California at Berkeley.

Joining UCLA for her senior season, McPeak was joining one of the top programs in the nation. However, the Bruins were hungry to win a national championship, having fallen in the semi-finals the previous two seasons. They were returning several key players, including the team&#x27;s setter, Jennifer Gratteau. UCLA began the 1990 season running a 6–2, with Gratteau and McPeak splitting time at the setter position. They won their first three matches, then suffered a loss to perennial power Nebraska. By the end of the month they were in a 5–1, and the Bruins were off to the races. Against Stanford McPeak broke a UCLA record with 97 assists. Said Banachowski &quot;We were very good last year with Jennifer, but we finally made the decision to go with Holly because she added a lot more quickness. Everybody seemed to play at a quicker pace when Holly was in there.&quot; DeGroot had the opportunity to observe this for himself during Cal&#x27;s two losses to the Bruins during the 1990 regular season.

The 1990 UCLA Bruins went on to win the NCAA collegiate championship. It was the school&#x27;s fifth of seven national titles. McPeak was selected first team All-Pac-10 and first team All-Tournament. She had amassed the single season assist record of 2,192 assists, to go along with her single match assist mark of 97 assists. The team&#x27;s season record of 36 - 1 was the best mark in women&#x27;s volleyball in school history. Said coach Banachowski &quot;We wanted McPeak out of high school because she was a tremendous athlete. I only wish I had had her for the three years instead of the one. Besides being a great athlete, she&#x27;s quick and very competitive.&quot;

The following year McPeak served as an assistant coach for Banachowski, whose Bruins repeated as national champions. Soon thereafter McPeak became intensely involved in professional beach volleyball. She continued her studies at UCLA, graduating in 1995 with a degree in English.

==Career in beach volleyball==
McPeak grew up at Marine street, and followed local beach doubles teams such as Jim Menges and Matt Gage, Mike Dodd and Tim Hovland, and later players like Karch Kiraly and Sinjin Smith. After graduating high school in 1987, McPeak made her pro beach volleyball debut at the age of 18, partnering with Jill Horning at the WPVA &quot;Miller Lite Open&quot; in Santa Monica. Horning had been a year ahead of McPeak at Mira Costa High. The team scored a ninth-place finish, an accomplishment the young rookies repeated later that summer in the pair&#x27;s second professional tournament. Following McPeak&#x27;s freshman year at Cal she and Horning partnered again for two more pro beach volleyball tournaments, again finishing ninth each time.

McPeak was named the WPVA&#x27;s Rookie of the Year in 1991, but it was not until 1993 at the Phoenix Open that she would win her first tournament. She would win 11 tournaments that year, eight of them with Cammy Ciarelli.

At the 1996 Summer Olympics, McPeak teamed up with Nancy Reno, but they finished in fifth place with a 2 – 2 record. This was right behind the American team of Barbra Fontana and Linda Hanley, which lost the bronze-medal game and finished fourth. Fontana and Hanley had defeated McPeak and Reno in face-to-face competition in this double-elimination tournament, thus eliminating McPeak and Reno and sending them to fifth place.

McPeak returned for the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, teaming with Misty May in May&#x27;s first Olympic competition. The pair won through the first two rounds, but then lost 16–14 in a hard-fought quarter-final match against Sandra Pires and Adriana Samuel of Brazil. The team finished tied for fifth place.

In 2002 the AVP shortened the court dimensions from 30 feet by 60 feet to 8 meters by 16 meters (26 feet 3 inches by 52 feet 6 inches). The rule change decreased the area a player had to defend, making player height a more essential element of a player&#x27;s success. Shorter players like McPeak were placed at a disadvantage. The change followed the FIVB change from the year before. Said McPeak, &quot;I liked the big courts better - with ball control we could make the big girls run.&quot;

At the 2004 Summer Olympics McPeak teamed with Elaine Youngs. The pair reached the semifinals where they met McPeak&#x27;s former partner Misty May, and her new partner Kerri Walsh. May and Walsh won the match, sending McPeak and Youngs to the bronze medal match, where they faced Australians Natalie Cook and Nicole Sanderson. McPeak and Youngs won to earn their first Olympic medal.

During the 2005 season, McPeak teamed up with Jennifer Kessy and with Nicole Branagh for the 2006 season. After Branagh left to partner with Elaine Youngs, McPeak partnered with indoor volleyball player Logan Tom for the 2007 AVP season. She then partnered with Angie Akers.

McPeak initially retired after the 2008 AVP season, but decided to come out of retirement when asked by Kerri Walsh to team with her after Misty May-Treanor suffered a tendon injury. McPeak played her final match with partner Kerri Walsh, retiring for good on May 6, 2009, one week shy of her 40th birthday.

McPeak&#x27;s career in professional beach volleyball spanned over twenty years. She ranked in the top 10 six times on the AVP Tour and seven times on the FIVB Tour. She was seven times voted the best defensive player in beach volleyball (WPVA 1995, 1996, 1997; BVA 2000, AVP 2002, 2003, 2004), and won titles with seven different partners. She was the first woman to break one million dollars in earnings. McPeak is one of just five women worldwide to have competed in the first three Olympics in beach volleyball.

==Player profile==
McPeak was a determined and highly competitive athlete. A quick 5-foot-7 setter indoors, on the beach she was renowned for her tough defense and relentless pursuit of the ball. Offensively she could consistently side out, scoring with placement more frequently than with power. She preferred the larger courts of the earlier years, where player height was at less of a premium. She was noted for hard work and for her intense off-court training regimen. She had a long career, scoring at least one career victory in every year she played from 1993 to 2004, with the exception of 1998 when there was no women&#x27;s domestic tour. Reflecting on her career, she recalls coming to a point where she realized she was capable of winning with any partner and with that realization came an increase in her confidence. McPeak states her toughest opponents were Kerri Walsh and Misty May. At her induction in 2013 she said: &quot;They just drove me crazy and to this day they still do.&quot;

==Broadcast career==
Since retiring from beach volleyball, McPeak works as a color commentator for Pac-12 volleyball shown on Fox Sports West, including most televised games of UCLA. She also does color for SEC coverage on the SEC Network.

In 2014, McPeak served as a sand volleyball game analyst for Pac-12 Network.

==Personal life==
McPeak is married to former AVP commissioner Leonard Armato and they have 3 sons. She has a twin brother (Gary) and a sister (Katie).

==Awards and honors==
At UCLA in 1990 she was selected first-team All-Pacific-10, first-team All-Pacific Region and first-team All-NCAA Tournament.

On October 30, 2009, McPeak was inducted into the Volleyball Hall of Fame.

<text>Iram of the Pillars (; an alternative translation is &quot;Iram of the tentpoles&quot;), also called &quot;Irum&quot;, &quot;Irem&quot;, &quot;Erum&quot;, or the &quot;City of the pillars&quot;, is a lost city mentioned in the Quran.

==Iram in the Quran==
The Quran mentions Iram in connection with (pillars):

There are several explanations for the reference to &quot;Iram – who had lofty pillars&quot;. Some see this as a geographic location, either a city or an area, others as the name of a tribe.

Those identifying it as a city have made various suggestions as to where or what city it was, ranging from Alexandria or Damascus to a city which actually moved or a city called Ubar. Ubar, according to ancient and medieval authors, was a land instead of a city.

As an area, it has been identified with the biblical region known as Aram. A more plausible candidate for Iram is Wadi Ramm in Jordan, as the Temple of al-Lat at the foot of Jabal Ramm has some ancient inscriptions mentioning Iram and possibly the tribe of ʿĀd.

It has also been identified as a tribe, possibly the tribe of ʿĀd, with the pillars referring to tent pillars. The mystic ad-Dabbagh has suggested that these verses refer to ʿĀd&#x27;s tents with pillars, both of which are gold-plated. He claims that coins made of this gold remain buried and that Iram is the name of a tribe of ʿĀd and not a location. The Nabataeans were one of the many nomadic Bedouin tribes who roamed the Arabian Desert and took their herds to where they could find grassland and water. They became familiar with their area as the seasons passed, and they struggled to survive during bad years when seasonal rainfall decreased. Although the Nabataeans were initially embedded in the Aramean culture, theories that they have Aramean roots are rejected by modern scholars. Instead, archaeological, religious and linguistic evidence confirms that they are a North Arabian tribe.

== Iram in Western writings ==
Iram became widely known to Western literature with the translation of the story &quot;The City of Many-Columned Iram and Abdullah Son of Abi Kilabah&quot; in &quot;The Book of One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. 

In 1998, the amateur archaeologist Nicholas Clapp proposed that Iram is the same as another legendary place Ubar, and he identifies Ubar as the archaeological site of Shisr in Oman. His hypothesis is not generally accepted by scholars. The identification of Ubar as Shisr is also problematic, and even Clapp himself denied it later.

==In fiction==
===Games===

* &quot;Uncharted 3: Drake&#x27;s Deception&quot; explores Iram of the Pillars in the city of Ubar.
* &quot;Dominions 5: Warriors of the Faith&quot; features Iram as the playable nation Ubar, a precursor to Na&#x27;Ba, which represents the Nabataeans.
* &quot;Sunless Sea&quot; has Irem as a port of call, the city having been transported underground to a subterranean ocean. &quot;Fallen London&quot;, which exists in the same setting, likewise includes Irem as a location the player can visit late in the game.
* In &quot;Civilization VI&quot;, when the player captures the last city belonging to an AI-controlled Suleiman I, Suleiman exclaims &quot;Ruin! Ruin! Istanbul has become Iram of the Pillars, remembered only by the melancholy poets.&quot;

===Literature===

* Edward FitzGerald&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot; mentions Iram: &quot;Iram indeed is gone with all its Rose,&quot; begins stanza V.
* H. P. Lovecraft places it somewhere near &quot;The Nameless City&quot; in his stories (1921). In &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;, Lovecraft uses the spelling &quot;Irem&quot;. Lovecraft&#x27;s mythos also includes &quot;many-columned Y&#x27;ha-nthlei.&quot;
* Iram is the theme of Daniel Easterman&#x27;s novel &quot;The Seventh Sanctuary&quot; (1987).
* Bayard Taylor&#x27;s poem &quot;The Garden of Irem&quot;.
* The SCP Foundation Wiki story &quot;ROUNDERHOUSE&#x27;s Gold Proposal&quot; takes place in and revolves around a history of Iram.
* Sofia Samatar&#x27;s short story &quot;Meet Me in Iram&quot; references the city

<text>Harold Taylor is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 1990, representing the riding of Wolseley for the Manitoba Liberal Party.

In 1983 and 1986, he was elected to the Winnipeg City Council in the Memorial district, as an independent candidate supporting the Liberal Party.

Taylor was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1988 provincial election, defeating incumbent New Democrat Myrna Phillips by 506 votes. The Liberals increased their parliamentary strength from one to twenty in this election, and Taylor sat with the official opposition for the next two years. In the 1990 provincial election, he lost to NDP candidate Jean Friesen by 1045 votes.

Taylor subsequently became involved in water conservation, serving as Executive Director of the Red River Basin Commission. He has also worked on the Pembina River Basin Advisory Board and the Water Strategy Advisory Committee.

<doc id="1210135" wikidata="Q630829" url="?curid=1210135" title="Western gull">
<text>The western gull (Larus occidentalis) is a large white-headed gull that lives on the west coast of North America and the Pacific Ocean. The western gull ranges from British Columbia, Canada, to Baja California, Mexico.

It was previously considered conspecific with the yellow-footed gull (&quot;Larus livens&quot;) of the Gulf of California.

==Physical description==

The western gull is a large gull that can measure in total length, spans across the wings, and weighs . The average mass among a survey of 48 gulls of the species was . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the bill is and the tarsus is . The western gull has a white head and body, and upperparts or mantle is dark grey. The head generally remains white year-round, developing little to no streaking in northern populations. It has a large and bulbous-tipped yellow bill with a red subterminal spot (this is the small spot near the end of the bill that chicks peck in order to stimulate feeding). The eye colour varies, averaging pale yellow in southern populations and darker in northern populations. It closely resembles the slaty-backed gull (&quot;Larus schistisagus&quot;) of Asia, but the latter species has paler eyes and deeper pink legs and eye orbitals. In the north of its range it forms a hybrid zone with its close relative the glaucous-winged gull (&quot;Larus glaucescens&quot;). Western gulls take approximately four years to reach their full plumage, their layer of feathers and the patterns and colors on the feathers. In adult plumage, The largest western gull colony is on the Farallon Islands, located about west of San Francisco, California; an estimated 30,000 gulls live in the San Francisco Bay area. Western gulls also live in the Oregon Coast.

Two subspecies are recognized, differentiated by the mantle and eye colouration. The northern subspecies &quot;L. o. occidentalis&quot; is found between Central Washington and Central California, has dark grey upperparts. The southern subspecies &quot;L. o. wymani&quot; is found between central and southern California has a darker mantle (approaching that of the Great black-backed gull) and has paler eyes on average. &quot;wymani&quot; has more advanced plumage development than &quot;occidentalis&quot;, and generally attains adult plumage by the third year.

== Auditory description ==

The call of the Western gull is bright, piercing, and repetitive.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The western gull is a year-round resident in California, Oregon, Baja California, and southern Washington. It is migratory, moving to northern Washington, British Columbia, and Baja California Sur to spend the nonbreeding season.

==Behavior==

The western gull rarely ventures more than approximately 100 miles inland, almost never very far from the ocean; it is almost an exclusively marine gull. It nests on offshore islands and rocks along the coast, and on islands inside estuaries. A colony also exists on Ano Nuevo Island, then Anacapa Island and Santa Barbara Island in Channel Islands National Park, and Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay. In the colonies, long term pairs aggressively defend territories whose borders may shift slightly from year to year, but are maintained for the life of the male.

===Feeding===
Western gulls feed in pelagic environments and in intertidal environments. At sea, they take fish and invertebrates like krill, squid and jellyfish. They are unable to dive and feed exclusively on the surface of the water. On land they feed on seal and sea lion carcasses and roadkill, as well as cockles, starfish, limpets and snails in the intertidal zone. They also feed on human food refuse, in human-altered habitats including landfills, and take food given to them, or stolen from people at marinas, beaches and parks. Western gulls are known to be predatory, killing and eating the young of other birds, especially ducklings, and even the adults of some smaller bird species. Western gulls, including one who lived at Oakland&#x27;s Lake Merritt are known for killing and eating pigeons (rock doves). They will also snatch fish from a cormorant&#x27;s or pelican&#x27;s mouth before it is swallowed. The bird has also been observed directly pilfering milk from the elephant seal&#x27;s teat.

==Reproduction==
A nest of vegetation is constructed inside the parent&#x27;s territory and 3 eggs are laid. These eggs are incubated for a month. The chicks, once hatched, remain inside the territory until they have fledged. Chicks straying into the territory of another gull are liable to be killed by that territory&#x27;s pair. Chick mortality is high, with on average one chick surviving to fledging. On occasion, abandoned chicks will be adopted by other gulls.

===Hybridization===
Between Puget Sound in Washington and Northern Oregon, the western gull hybridizes frequently with the glaucous-winged gull, a cross referred to as the Olympic gull. Hybrids between the two species are variable and may features of either parent species, they have paler mantles and wingtips paler than Western gulls but darker than Glaucous-winged gulls. Additionally, the nonbreeding plumage of hybrids typically has darker head markings than pure Western gulls, which have little to no streaking in their nonbreeding plumage.

The prevalence of &#x27;Olympic gull&#x27; hybrids is an example of bounded hybrid superiority, where natural selection favours hybrids in areas of intermediate habitat. One study found that females paired with hybrid males have higher breeding success than pairs of the same species. In the central part of the hybrid zone, clutch size was larger among pairs with hybrid males, many of which established breeding grounds in more vegetative cover than pure western gull males, which preferred sand habitat resulting in heavier predation. In the northern section of the hybrid zone, there was no difference in clutch size, but breeding success is higher due to the hybrids being more similar to western gulls in foraging behaviour, feeding more on fish than glaucous-winged gulls. Little evidence of assortative mating was observed, except for weak assortative mating among hybrids in absence of mixed species pairs.

==Western gulls and humans==

The western gull is currently not considered threatened. However, they have, for a gull, a restricted range. Numbers were greatly reduced in the 19th century by the taking of seabird eggs for the growing city of San Francisco. Western gull colonies also suffered from disturbance where they were turned into lighthouse stations, or, in the case of Alcatraz, a prison.

Western gulls are very aggressive when defending their territories and consequently were persecuted by some as a menace. The automation of lighthouses and the closing of Alcatraz Prison allowed the species to reclaim parts of its range. They are currently vulnerable to climatic events like El Niño events and oil spills.

Thousands of western gulls and chicks reside at the Anacapa Island in Channel Islands National Park.

Western gulls have become a serious nuisance to the San Francisco Giants baseball team. Thousands of gulls fly over Oracle Park in San Francisco during late innings of games. They swarm the field, defecate on fans, and after games eat leftovers of stadium food in the seats; how the birds know when games are about to end is unknown. The gulls left while a red-tailed hawk visited the park in late 2011, but returned after the hawk disappeared. Federal law prohibits shooting the birds, and hiring a falconer would cost the Giants $8000 a game.
==In media==
The western gull was one of the antagonists in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s famous movie &quot;The Birds&quot; which was filmed in Bodega Bay, California.

<doc id="1210147" wikidata="Q727753" url="?curid=1210147" title="Charles Crichton">
<text>Charles Ainslie Crichton (6 August 1910 – 14 September 1999) was an English film director and editor.

Born in Wallasey, Cheshire, he became best known for directing many comedies produced at Ealing Studios and had a 40-year career editing and directing many films and television programmes. For his final film, the acclaimed comedy &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot; (1988), Crichton was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Director and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (along with the film&#x27;s star John Cleese).

==Early life and education==
Crichton, one of six children, was born on 6 August 1910 in Wallasey, Cheshire, England. He was educated at Oundle School in Northamptonshire, followed by New College at the University of Oxford where he read history.

== Career ==

===Editing===
In 1931, Crichton began his career in the film industry as a film editor. His first credit as editor was &quot;Men of Tomorrow&quot; (1932). He edited over fifty films, such as &quot;Things to Come&quot; (1936). Other films he edited included those that were produced by Alexander Korda, such as &quot;Cash&quot; (1933), &quot;The Girl from Maxim&#x27;s&quot; (1933), &quot;The Private Life of Henry VIII&quot; (1933), &quot;Sanders of the River&quot; (1935), &quot;Elephant Boy&quot; (1937) and &quot;The Thief of Bagdad&quot; (1940). Crichton was paid £8 per week for his editing. In 1940, Crichton began his employment at Ealing Studios. There he edited the film, &quot;The Big Blockade&quot; (1942). Crichton also served as an associate producer of the film, &quot;Nine Men&quot; (1943), which he also edited.

===Directing===
Crichton made his directorial debut with &quot;For Those in Peril&quot; (1944). In 1945, he directed &quot;Painted Boats&quot; and co-directed a segment in &quot;Dead of Night&quot;. Crichton then directed &quot;Hue and Cry&quot; (1947), a film considered to be the first comedy released by Ealing Studios. Crichton later directed &quot;Against the Wind&quot; (1948) and &quot;Dance Hall&quot; (1950). Crichton then directed Alec Guinness in &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; (1951). This was followed by &quot;Hunted&quot; (1952), starring Dirk Bogarde. Afterwards, Crichton directed &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot; (1953). Later films he directed during the 1950s included &quot;The Divided Heart&quot; (1954), &quot;Law and Disorder&quot; (1958), and &quot;Floods of Fear&quot; (1959). He also directed Peter Sellers in &quot;The Battle of the Sexes&quot; (1959).

Crichton was the original director of &quot;Birdman of Alcatraz&quot; (1962), but he quit after clashing with Burt Lancaster. Crichton was then replaced by John Frankenheimer. Crichton said of the experience: &quot;Had I known that Burt Lancaster was to be &quot;de facto&quot; producer, I do not think I would have accepted the assignment, as he had a reputation for quarreling with better directors than I. But Harold Hecht, the credited producer, had assured me that there would be no interference from Lancaster. This did not prove to be the case.&quot; Crichton was also planning another film project with Sammy Davis Jr., but it never came to fruition due to the death of a producer involved with it.

&quot;The Third Secret&quot; (1964) and &quot;He Who Rides a Tiger&quot; (1965), the last two films Crichton directed during the 1960s, were not successful. The latter film was the last film he directed for 23 years.

Crichton moved to directing television shows, then corporate videos. The latter were through John Cleese&#x27;s company Video Arts. This led Cleese to propose Crichton returning to the crime comedy film genre. Beginning in 1983, Cleese and Crichton worked together on the story for &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot;. Cleese wrote the screenplay. When the film went into production in 1987, Cleese had to act as stand-by director for insurance reasons since Crichton was 77 years old. Cleese said of working with Crichton as a stand-by director: &quot;That was a subterfuge. I knew the studio would be worried about Charlie&#x27;s age. I don&#x27;t know anything about how to direct, but that doesn&#x27;t stop one-half of the directors. I simply prayed that Charlie would be on the set every morning. He shoots in such a way to convey the essence of every scene. He&#x27;s economical. He&#x27;s a dear man who&#x27;s terrified of showing off. If he says anything shrewd or insightful, he&#x27;ll apologize for a minute so he won&#x27;t be considered pompous.&quot;

== Personal life and death ==
In 1936, Crichton married Vera Harman-Mills, and together they had two sons, David and Nicholas. Nicholas became an eminent judge and reformer in UK family law. Crichton married his second wife, Nadine Haze, in 1962, and their marriage lasted until his death.

Following completion of production on &quot;A Fish Called Wanda&quot;, Crichton retired from the entertainment industry and spent the rest of his life living comfortably, fishing in both Scotland and Wales. He died on 14 September 1999 in South Kensington, London, at the age of 89.

<doc id="1210156" wikidata="Q7901121" url="?curid=1210156" title="Urrbrae Agricultural High School">
<text>Urrbrae Agricultural High School is a public high school in the Australian state of South Australia, with 1,500 students. The school is located in the Adelaide suburb of Netherby, about south-east of the Adelaide city centre. It is adjacent to the Waite Agricultural Research Institute of the University of Adelaide, the CSIRO Agricultural Research facilities in the suburb of Urrbrae, and various other agricultural and horticultural facilities established by Peter Waite, the University of Adelaide, and the South Australian state government.

The school is designated as a Special Interest School in Agriculture and the Environment, and is the only comprehensive special interest agricultural secondary school in South Australia. Its courses are strongly focused on agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, aquaculture, environmental earth, and other environmental subjects. Agricultural awards are awarded in these areas each year. Urrbrae also has a strong science and technology background, with extensive technology workshops, and many related courses available to students; (e.g. environmental technology and automotive technology). It also offers education programs for adults, and houses a TAFE campus.

Urrbrae Agricultural High School has an application process for students in Year 6 who wish to attend Urrbrae in their secondary school years. Unlike most public schools, Urrbrae is not part of the zonal system, and does not accept students based on where they live. Being the only comprehensive special interest agricultural secondary school in the State, it has students from all over the state. Students from country and distant areas often board locally, and many students travel long distances to school.

The campus includes a 35 hectare farm, (total size including farm, wetlands and school. TAFE is 45 hectares) and year 10 students give trail tours to visiting students from other schools. Urrbrae also has a swimming pool, a rock climbing wall, new tennis courts and large playing fields. A third of the site is a wetland, which is at which tours to other school are run by Urrbrae.

The school was founded in 1932 through a bequest from Peter Waite, (a South Australian pastoralist and public benefactor), as a school to teach agriculture to boys. In 1972 it enrolled its first two female students, and in 2002 it achieved its first year-level that was equally represented by both genders.

The Urrbrae Old Scholars Association was established in 1934.

== Farm ==
The UAHS farm is a 35 hectare farm which has many enterprises, including:

*Sheep
*Cattle
*Poultry
*Aquaculture (such as Barramundi and Yabbies)
*Horses
*Orchard
*Bees
*Alpacas
*Native Animals (including Australian marsupials, such as Wallabies, Sugar Gliders, and nocturnal species, plus lizards and snakes)
*Goats
*Vineyard &amp; winery (Wine is produced on campus by students)
*Olive trees
*An extensive Wetland
*Pigs
*Native Animals
*Birds

The Year 10, 11 and 12 students are involved in wine making, and with parental permission, are allowed to sample their own wine. Students are also able to make other produce, like butter, honey and yoghurt, through Agriculture Studies courses. These include practical lessons during the week, where students are able to participate in hands-on activities in all the different enterprises at the school. Activities include grooming and caring for the animals, preparing them for shows, and making butter, olive oil, and dried fruit from the school orchard and vineyard. In Year 8, students undertake a &quot;Home Project&quot; where they care for an animal or a plant, and record their experiences. Students also make vegetable gardens (silver-beet, carrots, cabbages, beetroot, broccoli, olive trees, cauliflower, etc.) and are permitted to take home any produce they grow.

There are many lunch time clubs for students, with one for nearly every enterprise on the farm, including poultry, horses, plants and bee-keeping. Although club membership is voluntary, these clubs have high participation rates.

<doc id="1210196" wikidata="Q932319" url="?curid=1210196" title="Jason White (rugby union)">
<text>Jason Phillip Randall White (born 17 April 1978) is a Scottish former rugby union footballer. He was a utility forward who played in the second or back row of the scrum – lock, flanker, or number eight. White played at club level for Glasgow Caledonians (now known as Glasgow Warriors); the French Top 14 side ASM Clermont Auvergne; and English Premiership side Sale Sharks. He won 77 caps playing for Scotland, captaining the side on 19 occasions.

==Early life==
White grew up in The Paddock, Peterculter, Aberdeen and was educated at Cults Academy and then at George Watson&#x27;s College in Edinburgh, leaving in 1996. He first started playing rugby union when a friend invited him to join a local team in Aberdeen – Aberdeen Wanderers. He quickly rose through the ranks of the Scotland Under-18 and Under-21 Squads.

==Captain of Scotland==

White was named the new captain of the Scotland national team by Scotland coach Frank Hadden after an injury to Jon Petrie. White led them for the first time in the test against Argentina at Murrayfield on 12 November 2005. He also led them in the famous win against France on 4 February 2006 at Murrayfield when he earned his 50th Scottish cap. Shortly after he led Scotland to another famous victory, 18–12 over the &#x27;Auld Enemy&#x27; at Murrayfield, therefore recovering the Calcutta Cup. He received the Man of the Match award for his outstanding contribution to the victory.
In the final fixture, White hit (in a legal tackle) Andrea Lo Cicero so hard that it forced a penalty for holding on. This penalty was kicked by Chris Paterson to secure a 13–10 victory for Scotland. The tackle was similar to the one on Joe Worsley in the Calcutta Cup match which snuffed out the final England attack.

==Awards==

On 21 April 2006, White was named The Famous Grouse Scotland Player of the Season 2005–06. In the tenth year of the awards it was the first time that a serving Scotland captain has been declared winner.

On 10 May 2006 White received the Guinness Premiership Player&#x27;s Player of the Year Award after receiving the same accolade in his native Scotland. In the 2005–06 season, White started the final as Sale Sharks won their first ever Premiership title.

White was named in a &quot;World XV of the year&quot; chosen in The New Zealand Herald newspaper in 2006.

In recognition of both his skills and sportsmanship his founding influence Aberdeen Wanderers RFC renamed their pavilion in his honour in April 2006.

In January 2007, White was awarded the Pat Marshall Memorial Award for season 2005–06 by the Rugby Union Writers&#x27; Club.

==Injury and recovery==
White was out of action from November 2006 until August 2007 after having sustained an injury to his anterior cruciate ligament in the 2006 Autumn test match against Romania; he underwent reconstructive surgery shortly after the injury. He returned to the Scotland squad in their 2007 Rugby World Cup warm-up against Ireland at Murrayfield on 11 August, captaining the side to a 31–21 win. He was again the captain of Scotland at the World Cup finals. White joined Clermont Auvergne in 2009 after signing from Sale Sharks. He was released by them in 2012.

==Personal life==

In 2017 White took his first steps into teaching with a role at Loretto School.

<text>Gilles Roch (born August 26, 1952 in Winnipeg, Manitoba) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1986 to 1990, representing the rural riding of Springfield.

The son of Marcel Roch, he worked as a hotel manager before entering political life. He was a board member of the Tourist Industry Association of Manitoba, and was also a member of the Franco-Manitoban School Trustees Association. Unlike most Franco-Manitoba politicians, Roch was an evangelical Christian rather than a Roman Catholic.

Roch&#x27;s political career followed an unusual course. He initially supported the Liberals, but defected to the Progressive Conservative Party in 1986 when the Liberals denied him permission to run as a candidate for the party. In the provincial election of 1986, Roch was elected in Springfield as a Progressive Conservative, defeating incumbent New Democrat Andy Anstett by 55 votes. He was re-elected by a much greater margin in the 1988 election, in which the Progressive Conservatives formed a minority government under Gary Filmon.

Roch, against his expectations, was not appointed to Filmon&#x27;s cabinet following the election. On September 8, 1988, he crossed the floor to rejoin the Liberal Party, which was the official opposition in the legislature at the time. These changing allegiances won Roch few supporters, and he did not seek re-election in the 1990 election.

<text>Klosterneuburg () is a town in the Tulln District of the Austrian state of Lower Austria. Frequently abbreviated to Kloburg by locals, it has a population of about 27,500. The Stift Klosterneuburg (Klosterneuburg Monastery), which was established in 1114 and soon after given to the Augustinians, is of particular historical importance.

==Geography==
Klosterneuburg is located on the Danube, immediately north of the Austrian capital Vienna, from which it is separated by the Kahlenberg and Leopoldsberg hills of the Vienna Woods range. It has been separated from its twin city of Korneuburg on the opposite bank of the Danube since the river changed course during the Late Middle Ages. The towns are connected by a reaction ferry link which runs during daylight hours from Spring to late Autumn. The municipal area comprises the northern tip of the Donauinsel as well as the high Mt. Exelberg and its telecommunication tower.

On the site of a former pioneer school of the Austrian Army Austrian Bundesheer are a variety of buildings due to be developed into a 12-hectare new town quarter by 2030. Klosterneuburg is also the centre of a wine growing area, with several esteemed vintners, numerous &quot;Heuriger&quot; wine taverns and the Federal Institute for Viticulture and Pomology Weinbauschule, where Fritz Zweigelt bred the Zweigelt and Blauburger red wine grapes.

Due to its hilly location, Klosterneuburg consists of several geographical areas within the cadastral communities of Klosterneuburg-Stadt, Maria Gugging, , , , , and . Its town centre has two main shopping areas - the Stadtplatz/Niedermarkt and the Rathausplatz - which are separated by a steep hill.

The town is tightly linked to the Austrian capital and is thought to be home to some of Lower Austria&#x27;s most affluent citizens . It has direct access to Vienna via the &quot;Klosterneuburger Straße&quot; highway (B14), the Vienna S-Bahn network running on the Emperor Franz Joseph Railway line (S40) from Franz-Josefs-Bahnhof to Tulln, and along the EV6 The Rivers cycle route. The town is the site of light industry and, while not belonging to Vienna, has almost the feel of a suburb. From 1938 to 1954, indeed, Klosterneuburg was designated as Vienna&#x27;s 26th district and in more recent times, it has been suggested that Klosterneuburg should become part of Vienna once more. The Albertina Klosterneuburg and the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, established in 2006, are located in the town.

==History==

Archaeological findings denote a settlement of the area already during the Neolithic period. In the Roman era (1st to 5th centuries), a fort of the Danubian &quot;limes&quot; stood at the site of Klosterneuburg on the northwestern border of the Pannonia. After Charlemagne had defeated the Avars, a Carolingian settlement in the newly established Avar March recorded as &quot;Omundesdorf&quot; may correspond to the site of the town. Klosterneuburg itself was first mentioned as &quot;Nivvenburc&quot; (Neuburg, &quot;New Castle&quot;) in an 1108 deed. 
In 1113 it became the residence[after Melk] of the Babenberg margrave Leopold III, the later patron saint of Austria. In 1114 Leopold, son-in-law of the Salian emperor Henry IV by his marriage with Agnes of Wailingen, had a princely castle erected together with a collegiate church on a hill rising directly from the banks of the Danube, which he transferred to Augustinian canons in 1133. This order is one of the oldest and richest of its kind in Austria; it owned much of the land upon which today the north-western suburbs of Vienna stand. Later, Duke Leopold VI of Austria (d. 1230) also had his residence there during parts of his reign. It was also here where Leopold VI&#x27;s eldest son climbed a tree, fell and died. The monastery complex include the old chapel of 1318, with Leopold&#x27;s tomb and the Verdun Altar, dating from the 12th century, the treasury and relic-chamber, the library with 30,000 volumes and numerous manuscripts, the picture gallery, the collection of coins, the theological hall, and the winecellar, containing an immense tun like that at Heidelberg.

The market on the left river bank quickly developed in conjunction with the famous monastery on the right bank. While the Danube was an important waterway trade route, it also repeatedly affected the citizens by floods. In the late 13th century, the two parts of the town, &quot;Klosterneuburg&quot; (the monastery) and &quot;Korneuburg&quot; (the market), had grown apart, whereafter the Habsburg king Albert I of Germany granted separate town privileges to Klosterneuburg in 1298.

The unfortified &quot;Untere Stadt&quot; was devastated by Ottoman forces in the 1529 Siege of Vienna and the 1683 Battle of Vienna whereas the fortified &quot;Obere Stadt&quot; was successfully defended in both cases. In the 18th century Emperor Charles VI, who could not prevail in the War of the Spanish Succession, set up plans to rebuild the Klosterneuburg monastery complex modelled on the Escorial. The construction of the Baroque buildings began in 1730; however, it did not survive an initial phase.

After the Austrian defeat in the 1805 Battle of Austerlitz, the town was occupied by Napoleonic troops until 1809. A winemaker&#x27;s town during the 19th century, Klosterneuburg developed to a recreational and residential area of Austrian officials working in the nearby capital. During the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria to Nazi Germany from 1938, Klosterneuburg was incorporated as the 26th district of &quot;Greater Vienna&quot;, which was reversed with the establishment of Wien-Umgebung District in 1954.

At the end of 2016 Wien-Umgebung District was dissolved and Klosterneuburg became a part of Tulln.

<text>Frank Gerald Blaker VC MC (8 May 1920 – 9 July 1944) was a British-Indian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Born in Kasauli, Punjab, India, Blaker was educated at the St. Paul&#x27;s School, Darjeeling.

Blaker was 24 years old, and a temporary Major in the Highland Light Infantry, British Army, attached to 3rd Battalion, 9th Gurkha Rifles, the khas battalion in the Indian Army during World War II when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

:In Burma on 9th July, 1944, a Company of the 9th Gurkha Rifles was ordered to carry out a wide, encircling movement across unknown and precipitous country, through dense jungle, to attack a strong enemy position on the summit of an important hill overlooking Taungni. Major Blaker carried out this movement with the utmost precision and took up a position with his Company on the extreme right flank of the enemy, in itself a feat of considerable military skill. 
:Another Company, after bitter fighting, had succeeded in taking the forward edge of the enemy position by a frontal assault, but had failed to reach the main crest of the hill in the face of fierce opposition. At this crucial moment Major Blaker&#x27;s Company came under heavy and accurate fire at close range from a medium machine gun and two light machine guns, and their advance was also completely stopped. 
:Major Blaker then advanced ahead of his men through very heavy fire and, in spite of being severely wounded in the arm by a grenade, he located the machine guns, which were the pivot of the enemy defence, and single handed charged the position. When hit by a burst of three rounds through the body, he continued to cheer on his men while lying on the ground. His fearless leadership and outstanding courage so inspired his Company that they stormed the Hill and captured the objective, while the enemy fled in terror into the jungle. 
:Major Blaker died of wounds while being evacuated from the battlefield. His heroism and self sacrifice were beyond all praise and contributed in no small way to the defeat of the enemy and the successful outcome of the operations.

John Masters, the author, was Blaker&#x27;s brigade commander. Writing 16 years later, he describes how the brigade was climbing a ridge with great difficulty to take a hill called Point 2171 from a determined and well-led force of Japanese. He resolved to send a force up a neighbouring ridge and required the battalion commander to send his best officer to lead the attack. Both commanders agreed that the best man was Blaker. Next morning he saw off the company and &quot;told Blaker to make bloody sure he was on the right ridge and that he got to the top. Then tried to smile. Blaker really did smile, saw it in the radio light&quot;. By this time the whole brigade was nearly exhausted. Moving and climbing in the jungle was very difficult. &quot;It took Jim Blaker an hour and a half to reach the foot of his ridge. Nearly five hours to climb up it. This for a mile and a half without opposition. Near the top he saw that the crest and northern flank of Point 2171 were strongly defended by automatics, woodpecker machine guns and mortars. After sending his message to me and waiting for the covering bombardment, Jim ordered the charge. His leading men came under machine guns firing directly down the ridge. They dived into the dense jungle, tried to crawl up on hands and knees. Men fell, the advance stopped. Jim went forward alone then, firing his carbine, calling &#x27;Come on &quot;C&quot; Company&#x27;. Seven machine gun bullets through the stomach. He sank down, against a tree, turned his head, &#x27;Come on &quot;C&quot; Company, I&#x27;m going to die. Take the position&#x27;. The Gurkhas swept on and up. Bayonets. &quot;Ayo Gurkhali&quot;, the Gurkhas have come! That night I wrote out the citation for Blaker&#x27;s Victoria Cross, which was immediately awarded, posthumously&quot;. 
Blaker died as a result of the wounds he received in this action. His grave is located in the Taukkyan War Cemetery, 20 miles north of Rangoon (now Yangon), Burma (now Myanmar). It is located in Plot VI, Row E, Grave 2.

<text>Dell Comics was the comic book publishing arm of Dell Publishing, which got its start in pulp magazines. It published comics from 1929 to 1973. At its peak, it was the most prominent and successful American company in the medium. In 1953, Dell claimed to be the world&#x27;s largest comics publisher, selling 26 million copies each month.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Its first title was &quot;The Funnies&quot; (1929), described by the Library of Congress as &quot;a short-lived newspaper tabloid insert&quot; rather than a comic book. Comics historian Ron Goulart describes the 16-page, four-color, newsprint periodical as &quot;more a Sunday comic section without the rest of the newspaper than a true comic book. But it did offer all original material and was sold on newsstands&quot;. It ran 36 weekly issues, published Saturdays from January 16, 1929, to October 16, 1930. The cover price rose from 10¢ to 30¢ with issue #3. This was reduced to a nickel from issue #22 to the end.

In 1933, Dell collaborated with Eastern Color Printing to publish the 36-page &quot;Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics&quot;, considered by historians the first true American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it &quot;the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing&quot;. It was distributed through the Woolworth&#x27;s department store chain, though it is unclear whether it was sold or given away; the cover displays no price, but Goulart refers, either metaphorically or literally, to the publisher &quot;sticking a ten-cent pricetag [sic] on the comic books&quot;.

In early 1934, Dell published the single-issue &quot;Famous Funnies: Series 1&quot;, also printed by Eastern Color. Unlike its predecessor, it was intended from the start to be sold rather than given away.

In 1936, the company partnered with McClure Syndicate in which Dell would finance and distribute publications that McClure would produce and edit on behalf of then-company executive Max Gaines and editor Sheldon Mayer. Among the titles Gaines oversaw were &quot;The Comics&quot;, &quot;Popular Comics&quot; and &quot;The Funnies&quot;. Gaines would leave McClure, and by extension, Dell in 1939, in order to set up All-American Publications with a distribution/partnership agreement at DC.

=== Western Publishing ===
The company formed a partnership in 1938 with Western Publishing, in which Dell would finance and distribute publications that Western would produce. While this diverged from the regular practice in the medium of one company handling finance and production and outsourcing distribution, it was a highly successful enterprise with titles selling in the millions. Most of the Dell-produced comics done for Western Publishing during this period were under the Whitman Comics banner (later also used by Gold Key Comics); notable titles included &quot;Crackajack Funnies&quot; (1938–1942) and &quot;Super Comics&quot; (1938–1949).

Comic book historian Mark Carlson has stated that at its peak in the mid-1950s, &quot;while Dell’s total number of comic book titles [was] only 15% of those published, it control[ed] nearly a third of the total market. Dell [had] more million-plus sellers than any other company before or since&quot;.

=== Licensed material ===
Dell Comics was best known for its licensed material, most notably the animated characters from Walt Disney Productions, Warner Bros., Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and Walter Lantz Studio, along with many movie and television properties such as the Lone Ranger, Tarzan, Felix the Cat, Howdy Doody, Yogi Bear and other Hanna-Barbera characters.

=== &quot;Four Color&quot; ===
From 1938 to 1962, Dell&#x27;s most notable and prolific title was the anthology &quot;Four Color&quot;. Published several times a month, the title (which primarily consisted of standalone issues featuring various licensed properties) saw more than 1,300 issues published in its 23-year history. It often served as a try-out title (much like DC&#x27;s &quot;Showcase&quot;) and thus the launching pad for many long-running series, a number of which (such as &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;) were continued not by Dell, but Gold Key Comics, the competing company formed when Western ended its partnership (see below).

=== Lil&#x27; Eightball ===
Responding to pressure from the African-American community, the character Lil&#x27; Eightball (who appeared in a handful of Walter Lantz cartoons in the late 1930s and in those initial appearances constituted what animation and comics historian Michael Barrier described as being a &quot;grotesquely stereotypical black boy&quot;) was discontinued as one of the featured characters in the Lantz anthology comic book &quot;New Funnies&quot;; the last appearance of the character was in the August 1947 issue.

=== Fredric Wertham ===
In 1948, Dell refused an invitation of membership in the nascent Association of Comics Magazine Publishers. The association had been formed to pre-empt government intervention in the face of mounting public criticism of comic books. Dell vice-president Helen Meyer told Congress that Dell had opted out of the association because they didn&#x27;t want their less controversial offerings to serve as &quot;an umbrella for the crime comic publishers&quot;. When the Comics Code was formed in 1954 in reaction to Wertham&#x27;s &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot;, Dell again refused to join and instead began publishing in its comics a &quot;Pledge to Parents&quot; that promised their editorial process &quot;eliminates, rather than regulates, objectional [sic] material&quot; and concluded with the now classic credo &quot;Dell Comics Are Good Comics.&quot;

Bart Beaty in his book &quot;Fredric Wertham and the Critique of Mass Culture&quot; describes a concerted campaign by Dell against publication of Wertham&#x27;s &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; to the extent of recruiting several of the companies that it licensed characters from (including Warner Brother Cartoons, the Lone Ranger Inc. and Edgar Rice Burroughs Inc.) to send letters of protest to Wertham&#x27;s publisher Stanley Rinehart.

Dell in this period even burnished its image by taking out full-page ads in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; in late 1952 and early 1953 that emphasized the wholesomeness of its comics.

=== Dell Comics Club and subscription promotions ===
From mid-1950 to Spring 1959 Dell promoted subscriptions to its non-Disney titles with what it called the Dell Comics Club. Membership was automatic with any one year subscription to such titles and came with a certificate of membership plus a group portrait of the most prominent non-Disney characters published by Dell. Dell also offered various subscription premiums during the 1940s and 1950s (in some cases these were prints of covers or other character artwork and in one instance a cel from a Warner Brothers cartoon) in what Mark Evanier has dubbed a coordinated concerted &quot;aggressive subscription push&quot; and offered the option of an illustrated note or card be sent to the recipients of a gift subscription for birthdays or Christmas.

Multi-year subscriptions were also available (in the case of &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;, at one point in the 1940s subscriptions for up to five years were offered).

=== Alternate format ===
In 1961, Dell issued two atypical, comic-book like paperbacks without coloring, with cardboard covers and heavier-weight paper than standard comics, and selling for one dollar when most comic books were 12 cents: the 116-page &quot;The Flintstones on the Rocks&quot; and the 117-page &quot;Huck &amp; Yogi Jamboree&quot; One historian describes the latter as &quot;a collection of drawings with text (there’s not a word balloon to be found). But there are drawings that are sequential which tell stories... [T]his was intended for Huck and Yogi’s &quot;adult&quot; fans. Of which there apparently were more than a few, given the format and high price — $1!&quot;

=== Western partnership ends, Dell declines ===
In 1961, Dell became the first comic book company to increase its cover prices, raising the prices to fifteen cents; this was soon lowered to twelve cents. In 1962 the partnership with Western ended, with Western taking most of its licensed properties and its original material and creating its own imprint, Gold Key Comics.

While most of the talent who had worked on the Dell line continued at Gold Key, a few creators like John Stanley stuck with Dell and its new line. Dell also drew new talent to its fold, such as Frank Springer, Don Arneson, and Lionel Ziprin.

Dell Comics continued for another 11 years with licensed television and motion picture adaptations (including &quot;&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;Doctor Kildare&quot;, &quot;Beach Blanket Bingo&quot;) and a few generally poorly received original titles. Among the few long lasting series from this time include the teen-comic &quot;Thirteen Going on Eighteen&quot; (29 issues, written by John Stanley), &quot;Ghost Stories&quot; (37 issues, #1 only written by John Stanley), &quot;Combat&quot; (40 issues), &quot;Ponytail&quot; (20 issues), &quot;Kona Monarch of Monster Isle&quot; (20 issues), &quot;Toka the Jungle King&quot; (10 issues), and &quot;Naza Stone Age Warrior&quot; (9 issues). Dell additionally attempted to do superhero titles, including &quot;Nukla&quot;, &quot;Superheroes&quot; (starring the Fab 4, as the group&#x27;s name was spelled on covers), &quot;Brain Boy&quot;, and a critically ridiculed trio of titles based on the Universal Pictures monsters Frankenstein, Dracula and Werewolf that recast the characters as superheroes.

Dell Comics ceased publication in 1973, with a few of its former titles moving to Gold Key Comics.

==Corporate acquisitions==
Dell was acquired by Doubleday in 1976. Doubleday was acquired by Bertelsmann in 1986, who formed Bantam Doubleday Dell as its US subsidiary. Bertelsmann acquired Random House in 1998 and renamed its US business after the acquisition. After the merger, Bantam was merged with Dell Publishing. In 2001, Random House purchased Golden Books&#x27; book publishing properties effectively reuniting the remnants of Dell and Western Publishing. Bantam Dell became part of the Random House publishing group in 2008. Ballantine Books was merged with Bantam Dell in 2010. In 2013, Random House merged with Penguin to form Penguin Random House.

==Fan revivals==

After Dell ceased publication, a number of its obscure characters were brought back in independent comics. In August 2016, InDELLible Comics was formed in tribute to the public domain characters orphaned by Dell. In July 2017, &quot;All-New Popular Comics&quot; #1 was published, and was #1 in its category on Amazon upon release. Founded and edited by the team of Jim Ludwig, David Noe and Dærick Gröss Sr., the first issue featured some original characters as well as stories and cameos with many Dell characters.

<doc id="1210240" wikidata="Q7191410" url="?curid=1210240" title="Pieces of Modesty">
<text>Pieces of Modesty is a short story collection by Peter O&#x27;Donnell featuring his action heroine, Modesty Blaise, first published in 1972. It was O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s first such collection of stories (he would publish a second, &quot;Cobra Trap&quot;, decades later).

The stories featured in this collection are:

#&quot;A Better Day to Die&quot;
#&quot;The Giggle-Wrecker&quot;
#&quot;I Had a Date with Lady Janet&quot;
#&quot;A Perfect Night to Break Your Neck&quot;
#&quot;Salamander Four&quot;
#&quot;The Soo Girl Charity&quot;

Elements from some of these stories would appear in the &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; comic strip which O&#x27;Donnell wrote concurrent with his book series. &quot;I Had a Date with Lady Janet&quot; is distinguished as the only Modesty Blaise tale to be told in the first person by Modesty&#x27;s right-hand man, Willie Garvin. Later novels would include characters introduced in these stories (including the aforementioned Lady Janet), and reference events in some of them (such as &quot;Salamander Four&quot; and past events depicted in &quot;I Had a Date with Lady Janet&quot;).

The stories in this collection predate the publication of the book by several years. In the 1960s they were planned for publication in a book that would have been illustrated by O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s comic strip artist, Jim Holdaway who died in 1970. That edition was never produced. Holdaway&#x27;s illustrations for the stories exist and have been reprinted in various magazines. The stories were originally published as newspaper inserts in Australia in 1970, in a weekly called &quot;Pix&quot;, under the series title &quot;Pay for Your Holidays Book (1–6)&quot;. The original order was:

#Modesty Blaise and the Men of Salamander Four (3 January 1970)
#A Perfect Night to Break Your Neck (10 January 1970)
#A Better Day to Die (17 January 1970)
#The Giggle Wrecker (24 January 1970)
#The Soo Girl Charity (31 January 1970)
#I Had a Date with Lady Janet (7 February 1970)

All were illustrated and eight pages long. The artists were uncredited, though the front page illustrations are signed by Holdaway for the first five (and the last looks like Holdaway&#x27;s work). The interior illustrations appear to be by a different artist.

&quot;Pieces of Modesty&quot; is unusual in the Modesty Blaise canon as it was the only book in the series not published in its first edition by Souvenir Press, instead being published exclusively in paperback by Pan Books. In 1986, the American company Mysterious Press issued the book&#x27;s first and (to date) only hardcover edition. In the 2000s, Souvenir Press began a series of reprints of the Modesty Blaise books, and after acquiring the rights, re-issued &quot;Pieces of Modesty&quot; in March 2010 with new cover artwork based on the original hardback edition of the first Modesty Blaise novel (as no first-edition hardback was published of &quot;Pieces of Modesty&quot;).

In the early 1980s, a dramatic reading of the story &quot;I Had a Date with Lady Janet&quot; was released on cassette tape by Pickwick Talking Books, PTB611, featuring John Thaw.</text><links>

<text>United States of Mind is Covenant&#x27;s fourth full-length album, released in March 2000.
&quot;Travelogue&quot; was a bonus disc for &quot;United States of Mind&quot;. The track &quot;You Can Make Your Own Music&quot; is a silent track, in reference to John Cage&#x27;s song &quot;4′33″&quot;. &quot;Like Tears in Rain&quot; was re-recorded in German and released as the single &quot;Der Leiermann&quot;, which also included the original version.

==Overview==
The album&#x27;s content finds the band united in a much more mainstream state of mind than any of their previous outings. For the most part, Covenant&#x27;s typically harsh, staticky blasts of audio have been significantly smoothened out, flirting with the simple repetition of dance-pop on tracks with minimal lyrical content, and when present, lyrics often portray much more personal themes — with greater ambiguity — compared to the hostile manifestos of mankind&#x27;s reality and the science fiction themes that pervade their earlier works. Some of the lyrics appear to be about reaching stardom, and the band even overflows with thanks to their fans on the liner notes. Sampled clips of dialogue, also usual on the early works, have been shed entirely save for the beginning of the gloom-bashing track &quot;Humility&quot;.
The track &quot;You can make your own music&quot; is a reference to the John Cage track 4&#x27;33&quot;.

==Track listing==

==Covers==

*In 2006 the U.S. Gothic Neo-Medieval/Neofolk band Unto Ashes covered &quot;One World One Sky&quot; on their album &quot;Songs For A Widow&quot;.
*Industrial band Goteki covered &quot;Tour de Force&quot; on their &quot;Stolen Thunder One&quot; EP.

<text>Tunneling or tunnelling is financial fraud committed by &quot;the transfer of assets and profits out of firms for the benefit of those who control them&quot;. In legal terms, this is known as a fraudulent transfer, such as when a group of major shareholders or the management of a publicly-traded company orders that company to sell off its assets to a second company at unreasonably low prices. The shareholders or management typically own the second company outright, and thus profit from the otherwise disastrous sale. Tunneling differs from outright theft because people who engage in tunneling generally comply with all of the relevant legal procedures; it is thus a subtler scheme than simply writing checks from a company to a private bank account. While people widely agree that tunneling is unethical, penalties for it vary widely; some states impose criminal sanctions, whereas other states provide either for civil suits only, or for no sanctions at all.

== Origin ==
The word &quot;tunneling&quot; was probably first used in this way in the Czech Republic (&quot;tunelování&quot; in Czech, &quot;tunelář&quot; for the person committing fraud) during the first half of the 1990s, when several large, previously privatised banks and factories unexpectedly went bankrupt. It was discovered later that the managements of these companies were deliberately transferring company property and real estate into their own private businesses, sometimes in offshore locations.

The term became a common label for this kind of criminal activity among Czechs and Slovaks. The term subsequently appeared in specialized literature in English, and then in a broader literature during the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s.

== Examples ==
The most common scheme in Central Europe in the post-privatization era was transferring funds and property from high cash flow corporations to companies privately owned by the very same management. Transfers were accomplished via huge loans that were issued without any expectation of repayment, via massive overpayment for outsourced services, or simply by selling a corporation&#x27;s real estate for a fraction of its market price. The main conditions enabling such a fraud is weak law against conflict of interests, non-existent legal liability of managers for leading their employer towards bankruptcy, and incompetence of financial authorities.

A typical example was the huge industrial complex Škoda Works in Plzeň, Czech Republic, which was tunneled by its top manager. The fraud, together with failures in management strategy, resulted in bankruptcy (2001) and then restructuring of the company. The manager was later acquitted by a court, which claimed that &quot;such practices were common at the time&quot;.

; Typical 7-step tunneling process
# Identify and incentivise a trusted company &#x27;insider&#x27;, usually in the finance dept, that will be willing to trample over company compliance and authorisations—and enter secretly into a loan/loans—with a person &#x27;outside&#x27; of the company. &#x27;Granting&#x27; a partial or a full &#x27;security&#x27; over some of, or over the assets, or over the entire business and all of its assets.
# Rapidly run down the cash in the company, usually by buying and holding in inventory equipment and stock—that is unnecessary at that time.
# At short (sometimes only 24–48 hours) notice, announce that the company is &#x27;insolvent&#x27;—and have the company immediately forced into a bankruptcy process.
# The &#x27;only&#x27;/&#x27;main creditor&#x27; is of course the local &#x27;outsider&#x27;—and so it is THEY that dominates a rapidly assembled &#x27;creditors committee&#x27;—which similarly rapidly agrees to sell some or all of the company assets... to a holding company that THEY already control.
# Knowing that the original owners are eventually likely to seek justice and also the re-establishment of ownership of their assets, the &#x27;tunnelers&#x27; next typically pay a local Police Dept officer, to file (knowingly false) &#x27;charges&#x27;—against the original owner of the company—usually by claiming that a &#x27;loan&#x27; or &#x27;loans&#x27; (which the original owners were entirely unaware of!) were &#x27;taken, with no intention of repaying them&#x27;.
# The &#x27;tunnelers&#x27; typically pay a local Local/Regional Court official, to:
(a) accept the knowingly false &#x27;charges&#x27;
(b) hold &#x27;Court Hearings&#x27;, without serving any formal Notice on the victim—the original owners
(c) gain &#x27;convictions&#x27; against the original owners.
# The &#x27;tunneler&#x27; next offers a &#x27;Settlement Agreement&#x27;—under which:
(i) they get to keep all of the misappropriated assets, that they have &#x27;legitimately&#x27; purchased from the &#x27;creditor&#x27;s committee&#x27;.
(ii) they have a clause included, whereby the original owner agrees to waive all rights—to ever sue the &#x27;tunnelers&#x27; in the future.
(iii) the &#x27;tunnelers&#x27; agree to retract all of the knowing false claims and allegations—that they made against the original owner—thereby quashing all any &#x27;convictions&#x27; or ongoing legal proceedings.

<doc id="1210255" wikidata="Q1404417" url="?curid=1210255" title="Legal liability">
<text>In law, liable means &quot;responsible or answerable in law; legally obligated&quot;. Legal liability concerns both civil law and criminal law and can arise from various areas of law, such as contracts, torts, taxes, or fines given by government agencies. The claimant is the one who seeks to establish, or prove, liability.

==Liability in business==
In commercial law, limited liability is a method of protection included in some business formations that shields its owners from certain types of liability and that amount a given owner will be liable for. A limited liability form separates the owner(s) from the business. The limited liability form essentially acts as a corporate veil that protects owners from liabilities of the business. This means that when a business is found liable in a case, the owners are not themselves liable; rather, the business is. Thus, only the funds or property the owner(s) have invested into the business are subject to that liability. If, for example, a limited liability business goes bankrupt, then the owner(s) will not lose unrelated assets, such as a personal residence (assuming they do not give personal guarantees). Forms of businesses that offer the limited liability protection include limited liability partnerships, limited liability companies, and corporations. Sole proprietorships and partnerships do not include limited liability.

This is the standard model for larger businesses, in which a shareholders will only lose the amount invested (in the form of stock value decreasing). For an explanation, see business entity.

There is an exception to this rule, however, which allows a claimant to litigate against the owner(s) of a limited liability business, if the owner(s) have engaged in conduct that justifies the claimant&#x27;s recovery from the owner(s): This exception is called &quot;piercing the corporate veil.&quot; Courts generally try not to utilize this exception unless there have been serious transgressions. Limited liability aids entrepreneurs, businesses, and the economy in growing and innovating. Therefore, if courts often chose to pierce the veil, that innovation would be restricted. The exact test a court will use to determine if the veil needs to pierced vary by state in the United States.

For sole proprietorships and general partnerships, the liability is unlimited. Unlimited liability means that the owner(s) of the business have the full responsibility of assuming all the business&#x27;s debts. This can include seizure of personal assets in the face of bankruptcy and liquidation. Professionals in limited liability partnerships and limited liability companies will have unlimited liability for their own torts and malpractices. The limited liability of the business will no longer apply for these wrongdoings.

For business owners, there are main categories of liability exposure to be aware of in order to protect their businesses from liability and financial troubles and issues. The first is employment-related issues where the larger the work force, and the more turnover there is, the larger the likelihood of liability lawsuits such as wrongful termination claims. Another area is accidents and/or injuries on the premises. Next, vehicle-related liability if employees are allowed to drive company cars since this could lead to accidents while they use the company cars. Product-related liability (also called manufacturer&#x27;s liability) details poor manufacturing of products that results in injuries and/or accidents, which is discussed in more detail in the following section. Errors/omissions is another category where a lawsuit can result from a mistake on the part of the company such as in a contract or paperwork. Finally, the last major category relates to holding directors and officers personally liable for actions taken by the company, as seen in piercing the corporate veil. Overall, as businesses get larger and more successful, their chances of liability lawsuits increase, but small businesses are not completely immune to them. Entrepreneurs and business owners need to be aware of these types of liability exposures to ensure their businesses are protected.

===Product liability===
Product liability governs civil lawsuits between a plaintiff and defendant who furnishes defective goods that caused loss or injury 11.

Product liability and its prevalence in the law has changed throughout history. In the 19th century, it worked to both the manufacturers&#x27; and other sellers&#x27; advantages. &quot;Caveat emptor&quot; (&quot;let the buyer beware&quot;) reigned supreme in this area of the law. In this era, the seller had no liability unless they had made an express promise to the customer that was not received. The 19th century was also when the Industrial Revolution was beginning and changing the business world. In order to promote this rise in industrialization and manufacturing, the law avoided allowing damage recoveries that would weaken new industries. In the 20th and 21st centuries, there was no longer this need to protect manufacturers from liability. If anything, there was more of need to impose liability standards on industries because consumers had less power to freely bargain with corporations and other business forms. Furthermore, the complexities and intricacies of goods was increasing, making it harder for the average buyer to determine manufacturing issues when purchasing these goods. Now a new phrase dominates liability: &quot;caveat venditor&quot; or &quot;let the seller beware.&quot; The law finds that sellers and manufacturers can face more liability for defects with the help of insurance and socializing the damages by raising prices and forcing the consumer to pay for it.

If a manufacturer is found to be negligent, that means they breached their duty to the customer by not eliminating a reasonably foreseeable risk caused by the product. The manufacturer can be seen as negligent if there are problems in the manufacturing process, do not properly inspect their products, do not give a reasonable warning to the customer when the product has a foreseeable risk of harm, and/or the design lends itself to risk of harm. The magnitude and severity of the foreseeable harm are also assessed when looking at negligence.

=== Employer liability ===
There is a form of liability that exists between employers and their employees. This is called vicarious liability. For it to apply, one party has responsibility for a third party, and the third party commits an unlawful action. An employer may be held liable for the actions of an employee if it is unlawful (i.e. harassment or discrimination), or the employee&#x27;s negligent actions while working causes damages to property or injury.

&quot;Respondeat superior&quot; (&quot;Let the superior answer&quot;) is a legal principle that dictates when an employer is responsible for the actions of an employee. Employers should worry about this rule when the employee commits a tort or harmful act when the employee was acting within the course and scope of employment at the time of the incident. The term &quot;scope of employment&quot; is when an employee is doing work assigned by their employer or is completing a task that is subject to the employer&#x27;s control. To test whether the conduct that led to the incident is within the scope of employment, one must determine:

# If it was the type of task the employee was employed to perform
# It occurred flexibly within the authorized work time period
# The incident was not unreasonably far away from the employer authorized location
# The incident was motivated, at least in part, for the purpose of serving the employer

If these four factors are found to be true, the employer will have to answer for the tort. The reasoning behind this legal principle is because it is thought that the employer is best suited for bearing the financial burden, employers can protect themselves against this burden with insurance, and the cost can be passed to customers by raising prices. On the other hand, if the employee was found to have either detoured or frolicked then defining the scope of employment becomes trickier. The rule of frolic and detour changes how the liability applies. A frolic is when the employee causes a tort when completing an activity that is unrelated to their job. If it is found that the employee had frolicked, the employee would then be liable for damages. For example, if a delivery driver does not complete his deliveries for a few hours so he can do some personal shopping, and on his way to the store, he hits a pedestrian. A detour is more minor. The employee is still participating in a non-work related activity, but the activity is not a major disregard for work duties. An example of a detour would be if on the way to deliver a package, a delivery driver stops at a drive-thru to grab something to eat. When pulling away from the restaurant to continue with deliveries, the driver hits a pedestrian. Here, the employer could still be liable for these damages because the detour was minor.

An employer can also be liable for a legal principle called negligent hiring. This happens when in the process of hiring a new employee, the employer does not check criminal pasts, backgrounds, or references to ensure the applicant did not pose a potential danger if hired as an employee. Under a similar principle of negligent retention, an employer may face liability if they know that a worker poses a potential danger to others but maintains their employment. To avoid claims of negligent hiring or retention, employers should take appropriate measures to avoid hiring employees who will pose a danger to members of the public, and take appropriate measures in response to any concerns that come to their attention, up to and including dismissal. Employers who serve vulnerable populations, such as young children and the elderly, go to customers&#x27; homes, or have access to weapons may perform criminal background checks as their default practice, and may have additional legal duties when it comes to screening, supervising and disciplining employees.

It is important for employers to note whether someone working for them is an independent contractor or an employee. An employee is someone who is a paid worker for the employer. An independent contractor, on the other hand, contracts with a principal to produce a result and in the process, gets to determine how that result will be completed. The difference lies in how much control the principal/employer can wield on the agent. Employees are subjected to more control while nonemployee agents, like independent contractors, have more freedom in how they do their job. A principal is not ordinarily liable for torts committed by nonemployee agents since the principal does not fully control the method of work done. However, there are exceptions to this. There can be direct liability if the principal hired an incompetent agent, if harm resulted from nonemployee agent&#x27;s failure to perform a duty of care that the principal bestowed on them (a duty of care is an action whose successful performance is so important that if it is delegated to an agent and not accomplished, the principal is still liable), and a principal is liable if the nonemployee agent did not take the correct precautions required to complete very dangerous activities.

An employer should also be aware on how the extent of their liability can change based on the agreements their agents make. An agent is a person who has the power to act on behalf of another party (typically the principal). Usually, a principal is liable for a contract made by the agent if the agent had actual or apparent authority to make the contract. Actual authority is the ability an agent has to pursue and complete certain activities based on communication and manifestations from the principal. Express authority is when the principal clearly states what the agent has the authority to do while implied authority is based on what is reasonable to assume that the agent is allowed to do based on what the principal wants of the agent. Express and implied authority are both types of actual authority. The second type of authority is apparent authority. This occurs when a principal&#x27;s actions lead a third party to reasonably assume that the agent can act in a certain way and create contracts with the third party on behalf of the principal. To determine if an agent is liable for a contract, one must look at the type of principal. There are four types of principals. A disclosed principal is known to the third party, and the third party knows that the agent is acting for this principal. The agent is not liable on authorized contracts made for a disclosed principal since all parties are aware of the contract and who is participating in the contract. An unidentified principal is seen when the third party knows the agent is acting for a principal but lacks knowledge on the principal&#x27;s identity. The agent is typically liable for contracts made for an unidentified principal. An undisclosed principal is seen when the third party does not know the principal&#x27;s existence and identity and reasonably believes the agent is the other party in the contract. In this instance, the agent can be held liable for the contract. A nonexistent principal refers to when an agent knowingly acts for principal that does not exist, such as an unincorporated association. The agent is liable here if they knew the principal had no capacity to take part in the contract even if the third party knows that the principal does not exist. An agent can also bind themselves to contracts by expressly agreeing to be liable. To avoid this, agents should make no express promises in their own name and should make sure the contract only obligates the principal. An agent may also be liable to a third party if they lack the authority to contract for a principal. The agent may escape liability in this scenario if the third party knows the agent lacks authority, the principal ratifies/affirms the contract, or the agent notifies the third party of his lack of authority.

<text>The Zilog eZ80 is an 8-bit microprocessor designed by Zilog as an updated version of the company&#x27;s first product, the highly-successful Zilog Z80. The eZ80 is binary compatible with the Z80, but operating almost three times faster at the same clock frequency.

== Design ==

The eZ80 has a three-stage pipeline: fetch, decode, and execute. When an instruction changes the program counter, it flushes the instructions that the CPU is currently processing. Available at up to 50 MHz (2004), the performance is comparable to a Z80 clocked at 150 MHz if fast memory is used (i.e. no wait states for opcode fetches, for data, or for I/O) or even higher in some applications (a 16-bit addition is 11 times as fast as in the original). The original Z80-compatible 16-bit register configuration is supported. The eZ80 also supports direct continuous addressing of 16 MB of memory without a memory management unit, by extending most registers (HL, BC, DE, IX, IY, SP, and PC) from 16 to 24 bits. In order to do so, the CPU has a full 24-bit address mode called ADL mode. In ADL mode, all Z80 16-bit registers are extended to 24 bits with additional upper 8-bit registers. For example, the HL register pair is extended with an uppermost register called HLU. The resulting 24-bit multi-byte register is collectively accessed by its old name, HL. The upper registers cannot be accessed individually.

The processor has a 24-bit ALU arithmetic logic unit and overlapped processing of several instructions (the three-stage pipeline) which are the two primary reasons for its speed. Unlike the older Z280 and Z380 it does not have (or need) a cache memory. Instead, it is intended to work with fast SRAM directly as main memory (as this had become much cheaper). Nor does it have the multiplexed bus of the Z280, making it as easy to work with (interface to) as the original Z80 and Z180, and equally predictable when it comes to exact execution times.

The chip has a memory interface that is similar to the original Z80, including the bus request/acknowledge pins, and adds four integrated chip selects. Versions are available with on-chip flash memory and on-chip zero wait-state SRAM (up to 256 KB flash memory and 16 KB SRAM) but there are also external buses on all models.

== Variants ==

The eZ80 family includes several variants offering different levels of integration. These single-chip computers retain an external address and data bus so they can function as general-purpose microprocessors despite their focus on specific applications.

The &quot;eZ80Acclaim!&quot; line integrates up to 128 KB of flash memory and 8 KB of SRAM, operating at speeds up to 20 MHz.

The &quot;eZ80AcclaimPlus!&quot; adds an Ethernet controller and TCP/IP stack to the eZ80Acclaim! features, reaching speeds of up to 50 MHz.

== Use in commercial products ==

The TI-84 Plus CE graphing calculator utilizes the eZ80 in 24-bit address mode at 48 MHz. The eZ80L92 processor powers the ST Robotics robot controller, running at 50 MHz.

<text>Liferea (short for Linux Feed Reader) is a news aggregator for online news feeds and podcasts. It supports the major feed formats including RSS/RDF and Atom and can import and export subscription lists in OPML format. Liferea is intended to be a fast, easy to use, and easy to install news aggregator for GTK+ that can be used with the GNOME desktop. Liferea features a script manager, in which users can add custom scripts that run whenever a certain action occurs.

==Pronunciation==
The lead programmer of Liferea, Lars Windolf, who is German, pronounces the name of the software .

==Distinguishing features==

To easily read linked articles or weblog comments, Liferea allows reading websites using an embedded WebKit-based browser. Additionally, the user can configure an external browser (e.g. Firefox, Web, Konqueror) with which to open links.

It supports a number of different feed formats including RSS/RDF, CDF, Atom, OCS, and OPML, many of which its contemporaries cannot.

By sorting subscriptions into folders, the user can read all headlines of a folder at once. By enabling a filtering preference, all previously read headlines of the folder can be hidden.

Similar to the mail client Evolution, Liferea supports search folders, which allow the user to save searches. Each search folder contains all headlines that match its user-defined search rules.

Liferea can synchronize with online services such as Tiny Tiny RSS and The Old Reader to allow reading news feeds from multiple devices.

==Browser integration==
In GNOME Web, there is a news feed subscription extension which allows adding news feeds when viewing websites.

For Firefox 1.5+ there is an extension (FeedBag) that allows adding subscriptions by simple clicking the LiveBookmarks icons in the Firefox address bar.

Since Firefox 2.0+, Liferea can be used without a special extension. To subscribe to new feeds from within Firefox, the Liferea helper script &quot;liferea-add-feed&quot; has to be configured in the Firefox feed subscription preferences.

== Profile ==

The school focuses early on a more advanced education in mathematics and sciences. An entrance examination is required for admission to the school. With more classes than normal in mathematics, biology, physics, chemistry and informatics, the students from grade 7 on learn more about STEM than students in a regular high school.

The school also has a contract with the Dresden University of Technology under which students in grades 7 and 8 spend a week there doing a project. In addition, 11th-grade students in the intensive program are required to carry out a scientific study. Students also take three subjects, rather than the normal two, at a higher level.

Students regularly take part in competitions like the International Mathematical Olympiad, the International Physics Olympiad, the International Olympiad in Informatics, and the International Chemistry Olympiad.

The school&#x27;s alumni includes the research mathematician Lisa Sauermann, who received acclaim for her results at the International Mathematical Olympiad.

<doc id="1210276" wikidata="Q4996730" url="?curid=1210276" title="Bulldog Track">
<text>The Bulldog Track, also known as the Bulldog-Wau road and Reinhold&#x27;s Highway, is a foot track crossing the western end of the Owen Stanley Range of Central Papua New Guinea. The track begins near a small settlement on the upper reaches of the Lakekamu River on the south side of the ranges. After penetrating dense equatorial rain forests it winds up around jungle clad ridges for some sixty kilometres to over on the Central Ranges before dropping down to the township of Wau in the Bulolo Valley.

The track is some one hundred kilometres due west of the famous Kokoda Track and crosses some of the most rugged and isolated terrain in the world, combining hot humid days with intensely cold nights, torrential rainfall and endemic tropical diseases such as malaria. Bulldog Track was longer, higher, steeper, wetter, colder and rougher than Kokoda Track. For the moment it is one of the few great treks in the Tropical montane regions of the world. Constructed sixty years ago, it was the only vehicular road ever to cross the Central Ranges of New Guinea.

In order to reach the Bulldog Track it is a short drive south east from Wau to the village of Winima. A six-hour walk will take you along a divergent track that was used as an alternate line of communication, during construction of the Track, commonly referred to as the Kudjeru Track. The villagers at Winima will be able to provide guides and directions for the Kudjeru Track. The Hidden Valley Gold Mine has cut off the highest sections of the track, which are now only accessible from the Papuan side.

==History==

In 1943 Australian Army engineers; the 2/1 and 2/16 Field Company RAE, 9th Australian Field Company (AIF), veterans of Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Greece and Crete, the 1st and 3rd Australian Pack Transport Companies and local Papuan labour cut the road with pickaxes and dynamite over a period of eight months. The Chief Engineer, W. J. Reinhold, was later to write &quot;Every foot of progress made on this road exacted the ultimate in courage, endurance, skill and toil. Its construction took a toll from surveyor, engineer, labourer and native carrier alike.&quot; During five months of operations over seventy per cent of the 2/1 Australian Field Company contracted malaria.

The purpose of the road was to provide a supply line for future military operations in the Markham Valley and on the northern coasts of Papua New Guinea. On the late afternoon of August 22, 1943, the road was finally completed and two jeeps crossed from Edie Creek to Bulldog.

On September 23, the first three-ton trucks crossed the road successfully and the long supply line was finally open with 114 kilometres of road were now completed. Commencing at Bulldog at an altitude of 59 metres it rose by a series of long loops up through the steep river gorges of the southern watershed to an altitude of three thousand metres, then dropped down a series of ridges into the Wau valley.

Seventeen bridges were constructed; mostly single, but at least one with multiple spans. More than two thousand Australian army personnel and over two thousand Papuans and New Guineans were involved during nine months of construction. Thus the road, acclaimed as the greatest military engineering feat ever, was completed and for the only time in history motor vehicles crossed the high rugged mountains of Papua New Guinea.

<text>Sandra Collins Good (born February 20, 1944) is an American criminal and member of the Manson Family. Good&#x27;s Manson Family nickname is &quot;Blue&quot;, which was given to her by Charles Manson to represent clean air and water.

==Early life==
Good was born in San Diego, California, the daughter of an aeronautical engineer. Her parents divorced when she was four years old. Good attended Point Loma High School and was a member of the Student Opinion Club. Good attended California State University Sacramento, the University of Oregon and San Francisco State College off and on for seven years, but never received a degree.

==Manson Family==
Good joined the Manson Family in April 1968 and a few months later went off with them when they moved to a new home at Spahn Ranch in the mountains west of Chatsworth. She was in jail with Mary Brunner for attempting to use stolen credit cards when the Tate/La Bianca murders took place, but was back at the ranch in time to get arrested during the August 16 raid. (Good wrote extensively about meeting Charles Manson, her life in “the Family,” and the Tate/LaBianca murders in Lynette Fromme&#x27;s 2018 memoir &quot;Reflexion&quot;.)

She has a son named Ivan S. Pugh (born September 16, 1969). Various men have been named as the father, most notably Joel Pugh (1940–1969), who was found dead in a London hotel room under suspicious circumstances. Although Ivan took Joel&#x27;s surname, his biological father is Manson Family associate Bobby Beausoleil, who murdered Gary Hinman in 1969.

In a telephone interview with WWL (AM) in New Orleans soon after Lynette Fromme&#x27;s attempted assassination of Gerald Ford, Good threatened that &quot;a wave of assassins&quot; from a group that she identified as the International Peoples Court of Retribution (see ATWA) would kill or disfigure certain business executives, whom she named, as well as members of their families. Good accused the executives of polluting the environment. On September 10, 1975, in a subsequent interview with Barbara Frum of the CBC radio program &quot;As It Happens&quot;, Good made similar threats against persons to avenge the killing of trees. She also did a telephone interview with Hamilton, Ontario broadcaster Bob Bratina on CHML Radio.

==Prison==
On December 22, 1975, Good and another Manson devotee, Susan Murphy, were indicted for &quot;conspiracy to send threatening letters through the mail&quot; by a Federal Grand Jury in Sacramento in connection with death threats against more than 170 corporate executives who Good believed were polluting the earth (see ATWA). Found guilty on March 16, 1976, Good was sentenced on April 13 to a 15-year prison term.

==Parole==
Good was paroled in early December 1985, and released from the Federal Correctional Center for Women in Alderson, West Virginia, after having served nearly 10 years of her 15-year sentence. Unlike several other Family members, Good was still loyal to Manson. A condition of her parole was that she could not reside in California. She lived instead in Vermont, where she lived quietly under the name Sandra Collins (or at times, &quot;Blue Collins&quot;) until 1989, when her environmental activism made the news and her identity was made public.

Following her parole, Good moved to Hanford, California, near Corcoran State Prison, to be closer to Manson, although as a convicted felon she was not permitted to visit him. On January 26, 1996, she and George Stimson began a now-defunct, pro-Manson website named &quot;Access Manson&quot;, about which prosecutor Stephen Kay said, &quot;[it] gives her [Good] an outlet where she can do things for [Manson].&quot; Good also used the website to support Manson&#x27;s environmental movement, ATWA (Air Trees Water Animals).

In a 2019 interview, Good still professed total allegiance to Manson, saying, &quot;They [Manson and his &quot;family&quot;] really saved my health, my brain, my emotional health, my mental health, my physical health. I&#x27;m thankful to them all,&quot; and credited Manson with teaching her about the &quot;deep connection to the natural world.&quot; Good also said, &quot;You want to talk about devils and demonic and immoral and evil, go to Hollywood [...] How can you point the finger at us and call us evil for being good soldiers and doing what needed to be done?”

== In popular culture ==
*Good is portrayed by Kansas Bowling in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2019 film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;

<text>I&#x27;m Your Fan: The Songs of Leonard Cohen is a tribute album to Leonard Cohen, released in 1991, produced by the French music magazine &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot;. The album features Cohen&#x27;s songs interpreted by some of the most respected rock acts of the time. Its name is a play on the title of Cohen&#x27;s album &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;.

For the album&#x27;s American release on Atlantic Records, R.E.M.&#x27;s rendition of &quot;First We Take Manhattan&quot; and House of Love&#x27;s &quot;Who by Fire&quot; (the lead tracks on each side of the vinyl and cassette versions) were swapped so that R.E.M., one of the most popular American rock bands of the era, led the album. In all other countries where the album was released, however, the R.E.M. track appears on Side Two. In the United Kingdom, the album was distributed by record label EastWest Records, in France by Sony Music.

The album includes two different covers of &quot;Tower of Song&quot;, one by Robert Forster and another by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. The latter version is a radical deconstruction of the song, edited from an hour-long jam session held by the band.

<text>Harold Tommy Amaker Jr. (; born June 6, 1965) is an American college basketball coach and the head coach of the Harvard University men&#x27;s basketball team. He has also coached for the University of Michigan and Seton Hall University. He played point guard and later served as an assistant coach at Duke University under Mike Krzyzewski. An All-American player, Amaker set numerous records and earned many honors and awards. He took Seton Hall to the post season in each of his four seasons as their coach, helped Michigan win the National Invitation Tournament the year after a probationary ban from postseason play, and had the three highest single-season win totals in the history of Harvard basketball, the school&#x27;s first six Ivy League championships and first NCAA tournament victory.

Amaker was a high school basketball star at W. T. Woodson High School from 1979 to 1983 under coach Paul (Red) Jenkins. Amaker led the Woodson Cavaliers to four straight Northern District titles, including victories over the national powerhouse DeMatha Catholic High School. A McDonald&#x27;s All-American, Amaker also earned the Wooden Defensive Player of the Year award in 1983, awarded to the nation&#x27;s best high school defensive player. He averaged almost 18 points, and contributed 7.5 assists and 3.5 steals per game while at Woodson. In December 1992, the Connection named Amaker to the Connection Dream Team, as a point guard.McDonald&#x27;s All-American and a Parade All-American. As a college basketball player, he set most of the assists records and many steals records for Duke basketball. He also set the Atlantic Coast Conference single-season games played and games started records. Among his numerous accolades, he was the first winner of the NABC Defensive Player of the Year, and he was a third team All-American.

Amaker was an assistant coach for the Duke Blue Devils men&#x27;s basketball under Krzyzewski for nine seasons. His first four seasons were part of a five-year streak of Final Four appearances by Duke (including back-to-back national championships). As a head coach, Amaker took the Seton Hall Pirates to postseason tournaments (NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament – 2000 and National Invitation Tournament – 1998, 1999, and 2001) in each of his four seasons as their coach. Assistant coach, Jason Lampa, credits the success that Amaker experienced at Seton Hall to his calm demeanor and respect for players. He dealt with the turmoil and self-imposed sanctions of the University of Michigan basketball scandal in his first years with Michigan, where he eventually won the 2004 National Invitation Tournament with the 2003–04 Michigan Wolverines men&#x27;s basketball team and finished as the runner-up with Michigan in the 2006 National Invitation Tournament.

In his tenure as Harvard men&#x27;s basketball coach, he was the first coach to lead the Crimson to victory over a ranked opponent with the school. He also coached the 2009–10 Harvard Crimson men&#x27;s basketball team into the postseason (2010 CollegeInsider.com Tournament) in his third year there, which included the highest single-season victory total (21) in school history. In the summer of 2010, the NCAA ruled that Amaker had committed a recruiting violation, resulting in NCAA-mandated recruiting restrictions, the university&#x27;s first NCAA penalty of the men&#x27;s basketball program. The 2010–11 team became the first Harvard men&#x27;s basketball team to clinch a share of the Ivy League championship and surpassed the prior season win total (23). The 2011–12 team became the first in school history to appear in the Associated Press (AP) and Coaches Polls and, for the third year in a row, established a new school record for wins (26). Amaker&#x27;s 2011–12, 2012–13, 2013–14 and 2014–15 teams repeated as Ivy League champions. The 2012–13 team gave Harvard its first NCAA tournament victory. The 2013–14 team posted a record 27 wins. Amaker became the winningest coach in school history in 2016.

==Early years==
Amaker was born in Falls Church, Virginia, in 1965.

Amaker resided in Falls Church, but he attended W.T. Woodson High School in Fairfax, Virginia, because his mother, Alma Amaker, was a high school English teacher in Fairfax County. Her job allowed her to choose among the county schools, her choice made because the school&#x27;s basketball coach, Red Jenkins, who called Amaker &quot;T-bird&quot;, had been impressed with his performances at his youth summer league since Amaker was 10 years old. He began playing varsity for Woodson by December, making him the first freshman to play varsity in the school&#x27;s history. His mother, whom Jenkins called &quot;his first coach and his best coach,&quot; attended his practices and graded papers in the coach&#x27;s office.

Duke University basketball head coach Mike Krzyzewski, who had just completed his first season as Duke coach, was in town to evaluate Johnny Dawkins in a 1981 Washington D.C. summer league game, but was convinced to stay for a second game to see Amaker play. Krzyzewski met Amaker&#x27;s mother and said, &quot;Mrs. Amaker, your son is going to look great in Duke blue.&quot; At the time, Amaker had wanted to play for the Maryland Terrapins because his sister Tami went to the University of Maryland, College Park and Amaker idolized Maryland star guard John Lucas. He was recruited eventually to Duke by assistant coach Chuck Swenson, who would later become an assistant coach during Amaker&#x27;s first five seasons at Michigan from 2001 to 2006.

Amaker played on the 1983 McDonald&#x27;s All-American Team and was also named to the Parade All-American team. According to the &quot;Fairfax Connection&quot;, the county changed the rules regarding where teachers could send their children due to Amaker&#x27;s success at Woodson.

==College career==
Amaker was a star point guard at Duke after becoming a freshman starter for head coach Krzyzewski. He led the team in assists three years and in steals four seasons. While at Duke his roommate for away games was Mike Brey.

===Freshman and sophomore years===
Dawkins played point guard for the 1982–83 Blue Devils, but moved to shooting guard the following year to make way for Amaker. When Amaker joined the 1983–84 Blue Devils, unranked Duke, led by Dawkins and Amaker, won its first seven games, the longest winning streak of fourth-year head coach Krzyzewski&#x27;s career. Amaker had a field goal accuracy of over 65 percent in those games. He led Duke to the NCAA Tournament during his 1984 freshman and 1985 sophomore seasons, but neither team advanced to the Sweet Sixteen (regional semifinals). In the quarterfinal round of the 1984 ACC men&#x27;s basketball tournament against the Mark Price-led Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, Amaker hit the game-winning shot with the score tied and less than 10 seconds left in overtime. In some instances, Amaker&#x27;s defense changed the game by limiting dribble penetration and forcing low shooting percentages regardless of whether he had notable offensive contributions.

===Junior year===
During Amaker&#x27;s junior year (1985–86), Duke won the inaugural NIT Season Tip-Off (then known as the preseason National Invitation Tournament) and Amaker had nine assists in the championship game against a Danny Manning-led Kansas team. In the March Carolina–Duke rivalry game against North Carolina Amaker stole the ball from Jeff Lebo and made a layup that gave Duke a late first half three-point lead it never surrendered. The win clinched Duke&#x27;s first regular season ACC Championship since 1966. According to ESPN college basketball color commentator Dick Vitale, Amaker had a reputation for putting pressure on the ball. That year, he helped the team win the 1986 ACC men&#x27;s basketball tournament, including a championship game victory over the Price-led Georgia Tech.

Duke entered the 1986 NCAA tournament ranked number one with a team that was built around the defensive efforts of its guards, Dawkins and Amaker. In the final four with Duke clinging to a 69–67 lead in a rematch against Kansas, Amaker pulled down the final rebound and sank two clinching free throws in the final five seconds. The win sent Duke to the championship game, giving the team its 21st consecutive victory and an NCAA record 37 single-season victories. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; journalist Robert Markus described Amaker and Dawkins as the best guard combination in the country, although Vitale described Amaker as unknown.

The 1985–86 Blue Devils finished as national runner-up in the 1986 NCAA tournament to Louisville. That year, Amaker recorded 81 steals, second to Jim Spanarkel at that point in Duke history. He set the career steals record, which stood until Shane Battier broke it in 2001. Amaker also holds the Duke single-year NCAA tournament record with 18 steals in 1986, which had been a tournament record. That year, he had seven steals in two tournament games—against Old Dominion in the second round on March 15 and Louisville in the final on March 31. This seven-steal total stood as the single-game NCAA tournament record for seven years until the 1993 NCAA tournament when Darrell Hawkins had eight for Arkansas against Holy Cross and Grant Hill had eight for Duke against California. The seven steals was a championship game record that was tied by Mookie Blaylock in the 1988 NCAA tournament for Oklahoma against Kansas and was surpassed by Ty Lawson in the 2009 NCAA tournament for North Carolina against Michigan State. Amaker was selected to the 1986 Division I basketball tournament all-NCAA Final Four team. The 1986 Duke team graduated four of its five starters (Dawkins, Mark Alarie, Jay Bilas and David Henderson), leaving Amaker with an inexperienced supporting cast for his senior season. That year, Amaker was a spokesman against drug and alcohol abuse as part of an NCAA-Fiesta Bowl drug education television program.

===Senior year===
Muggsy Bogues, Amaker&#x27;s ACC rival, was his roommate during the July 1986 FIBA World Championship. He played in at least two games in the tournament, the first for a mere two minutes against Puerto Rico, but he played a prominent role in the USA&#x27;s win over Italy. Amaker won a gold medal while serving on the US national team in the FIBA World Championship, which served as the basketball tournament for the 1986 Goodwill Games.

Senior Amaker served as team captain for the 1986–87 Blue Devils, and he led Duke back to the 1987 NCAA tournament, where they advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before losing to eventual champion Indiana. The key players on the team that year were Amaker and sophomore Danny Ferry. During his senior season, the National Collegiate Athletic Association instituted the three-point field goal. Amaker led Duke in three point shooting that year. He hit a three-point shot with 1:39 remaining in overtime against 17–0 (4–0 ACC) Horace Grant-led Clemson to give Duke the lead for good. A few weeks later, with the score tied in regulation at 60 against Notre Dame and on a two-on-one fast break with 16 seconds left, Amaker took a jump shot. Krzyzewski said Duke lost the game because it did not play as smart as its opponent and Markus described this example in his column. In Amaker&#x27;s final home game, he made a jump shot with 1:15 remaining that put number seventeen Duke, which made all six of its free throws in the final 45 seconds, ahead for good in its rematch against number thirteen Clemson. In the 1987 tournament he led Duke in scoring in its final two games, including 23 against the Rick Calloway/Keith Smart/Steve Alford-led Indiana, who was coached by Bobby Knight, Krzyzewski&#x27;s college coach.

That year, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) awarded Amaker with the first Henry Iba Corinthian Award (also known as the NABC Defensive Player of the Year). Amaker was selected to the 1987 NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball All-American third team by the NABC. He was named to the 1987 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament All-Midwest Regional Team. He was a 1987 All-ACC 2nd-team honoree and earned the team co-MVP award with Ferry that year. Amaker earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics in 1987 from Duke.

===Accomplishments===
Amaker set many Duke career and single-season assists records. He held the record for single-season assists in the years between 1986 and 1990, which was broken by Bobby Hurley. Hurley also broke Amaker&#x27;s records in career assists per game (5.1, 1987–93) and career assists (708, 1987–92). Steve Wojciechowski broke Amaker&#x27;s records in single-season assists to turnover ratio (2.88, 1985–97) and career assists to turnover ratio (2.11, 1987–98). Although his single-season assists records were surpassed by Hurley&#x27;s freshman, sophomore and senior season totals, it still remains a record for a Duke junior. He also held Duke&#x27;s career NCAA tournament assist average record with 57 in 12 games for a 4.7 average until Hurley surpassed it with 145 in 20 games for a 7.3 average. His school single-game assists record of 14 that he tied (Kevin Billerman, March 2, 1974, vs. North Carolina) vs. on February 19, 1986, was not broken until Hurley&#x27;s senior 1993 season and is still a record for a junior.

Amaker holds several Duke and ACC records for games played. Amaker, Alarie and Dawkins have all started 40 games for the 1985–86 Duke team and both Ferry and Billy King have played 40 games in a season. Amaker&#x27;s 138 consecutive games started surpassed Alarie and Dawkins&#x27; totals of 133. His 138 consecutive games played was a Duke record until Chris Duhon played 144 in a row ending in 2004. Consecutive games started is not shown in the 2009–10 Atlantic Coast Conference Media Guide records section. However, no ACC player has ever played more than 40 games in a season.

==Pro career==
Following his college basketball career, Amaker was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics in the 3rd round of the 1987 NBA draft with the 55th pick overall. He was also drafted in the first round of the April 1987 United States Basketball League&#x27;s draft by the Staten Island Stallions. He was regarded to be too small to play in the NBA at and . He was cut from the SuperSonics team on October 21, 1987. Subsequently, he spent three days with the Wyoming Wildcatters of the Continental Basketball Association in Casper, Wyoming. He quickly decided he wanted to return to Duke to pursue a Master of Business Administration (MBA).

==Coaching career==

===Duke===

Amaker accepted a graduate assistant position on Krzyzewski&#x27;s staff at Duke in 1988 while pursuing his MBA degree from the Fuqua School of Business; the team reached the Final Four of the 1989 NCAA tournament. He was an assistant coach from 1989 through 1997, during which Duke won two NCAA Championships (1991 and 1992) and made two other Final Four appearances (1990 and 1994). By 1992, Duke had been to five consecutive final fours. While an assistant coach, he declined numerous Division I head coaching opportunities. Duke also won four regular season Atlantic Coast Conference men&#x27;s basketball championships (1991, 1992, 1994 and 1997) and the 1992 ACC men&#x27;s basketball tournament. The 1994–95 season was turbulent. In October 1994, Krzyzewski underwent back surgery. He attempted to return to coaching two weeks later but eventually was re-admitted to Duke University Hospital for four days in January due to related complications. He eventually relinquished control of the team for the season to interim coach Pete Gaudet.

After Wimp Sanderson was forced out as coach of Alabama in 1992, Amaker was under consideration to replace him. In 1993, he was the leading candidate to assume the head coaching job at Northwestern when Bill Foster stepped aside to serve as interim athletic director, but at age 27, he declined the job when it was offered, noting that he had only been married one year and saying &quot;It boiled down to us looking at a situation where we were extremely flattered, but a situation that wasn&#x27;t right for us now.&quot; That summer Amaker was one of two college basketball members of the 10-man selection committee for the United States Olympic Team. In 1994, he was on the short list to replace Kevin O&#x27;Neill, who left Marquette for a job at Tennessee. In 1995, USC was in negotiations to hire Amaker to replace interim coach Charlie Parker, who replaced George Raveling following a car accident. The reason his negotiations with USC failed was compensation since Amaker was both a Duke assistant coach and earned an additional $100,000 (US$ in dollars) through a summer youth day camp. That summer, Duke promoted Amaker from assistant basketball coach to associate head coach. Krzyzewski returned to coaching in October 1995. USC went on to hire Parker, who did not last a full season as head coach. In 1996, Amaker was rumored to be on the short list to replace interim coach Steve Lavin at UCLA in 1997. When the Northwestern job opened up again in 1997, he was not under consideration because athletic director Rick Taylor sought a candidate with Division I head coaching postseason experience.

===Seton Hall===
In 1997, Amaker took the head coaching position at Seton Hall, who had missed the post season in the two prior years. At 31, Amaker became the youngest head basketball coach in Big East Conference history. Then, he took Seton Hall to the NCAA tournament once (2000) – when his team reached the &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; – and to the National Invitation Tournament three times (1998, 1999 and 2001).

The earned the sixth seed in the 1998 Big East men&#x27;s basketball tournament, but were ousted in the first round by eleventh-seeded in overtime in the first round. They ended up in the 1998 National Invitation Tournament where they lost in the first round to to fall to a final record of 15–15. After returning Seton Hall to the post season, Amaker was considered for the Michigan job, but they decided to make interim coach Brian Ellerbe a full-time head coach.

Seton Hall&#x27;s earned the ninth seed in the 1999 Big East men&#x27;s basketball tournament. They defeated eighth-seeded Notre Dame in the first round, but lost by one point to top-seeded Connecticut, who went on to win the national championship. They were invited to the 1999 National Invitation Tournament where they lost in the first round to and again finished 15–15.

According to ESPN, Amaker recruited the #2 recruiting class in the nation for the class of 2000 while at Seton Hall. The class consisted of Eddie Griffin (ranked by some as the top high school player in the nation), Andre Barrett, and Marcus Toney-El. The Pirates were ranked high on many experts&#x27; pre-season rankings. The 1999–2000 Seton Hall team earned the fifth seed in the 2000 Big East men&#x27;s basketball tournament and earned a victory against twelfth-seeded in the first round, but lost to fourth-seeded Connecticut. The first round win gave the team 20 victories and no Big East team had achieved that number of victories without getting invited to the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament in the 21-year history of the conference. They were invited to the 2000 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament where they were seeded tenth in the East Region. They knocked off seventh-seeded Oregon and second-seeded Temple. In the Sweet Sixteen round they were ousted by third-seeded and finished with a 22–10 record.

The earned the Big East West Division&#x27;s sixth seed in the 2001 Big East men&#x27;s basketball tournament and beat the East Division three seed St. John&#x27;s and west two seed Georgetown. They were defeated in the semifinals by east top seed Boston College and ended the year at 16–15. They were invited to the 2001 National Invitation Tournament where they lost in the first round to Alabama. The following season, Amaker resigned as the Seton Hall head coach and became head coach at Michigan, replacing Ellerbe, who had been fired. Amaker met with Michigan athletic director Bill Martin in a hotel lobby instead of renting a room because Martin wanted to save money. Word of the meeting got back to ESPN and the New Jersey press was not kind to Amaker, hinting that he was devious and selfish.

===Michigan===
Amaker inherited a Michigan Wolverines men&#x27;s basketball team that was five years into the investigation of the University of Michigan basketball scandal. The Wolverines opposed Amaker&#x27;s former mentor Krzyzewski and the 2001–02 Duke Blue Devils in his seventh game as head coach, but his team lost. Although the 2001–02 Wolverines finished at 11–18, Amaker was able to lead the tenth-seeded team to a victory over seventh-seeded in the 2002 Big Ten Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament before losing to two seed, Ohio State.

Michigan finished the 2002–03 season with a 17–13 record, but sat out both that year&#x27;s NCAA and NIT tournaments due to the self-imposed postseason ban. The team had banned itself from post season play before the season started. Nonetheless, over the course of the season the team had earned a three seed and a first round bye in the 2003 Big Ten Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament, but was upset in the second round by Indiana. At the conclusion of the season, the NCAA added a second year of post season ineligibility to bring the severity of the punishment to a level it deemed more appropriate.

Amaker&#x27;s 2003–04 team earned a fifth seed and first round bye in the 2004 Big Ten Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament where it defeated fourth-seeded Iowa before losing to top-seeded Illinois. The team experienced successive wins in the 2004 National Invitation Tournament against , , Hawaii and . The team won the championship game against , giving Amaker his highest single-season victory total up to that point in time with a 23–11 record. Amaker, who has tended to avoid the spotlight, was not on the court as his team celebrated the college basketball tradition of cutting of the nets in celebration of a championship at the 2004 NIT.

The 2004–05 team only achieved a nine seed in the 2005 Big Ten Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament when it lost in the first round to eighth-seeded . It posted a 13–18 record (4–12 in conference) and finished ninth in the conference.

The Wolverines&#x27; 2005–06 team was a high percentage shooting, disciplined and balanced team. It was seeded seventh in the 2006 Big Ten Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament but lost to the tenth seeded Minnesota Golden Gophers. The team had been ranked 37th in the Ratings Percentage Index prior to the game, making them a solid contender for a 2006 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament invitation. The loss sent them to the 2006 National Invitation Tournament where they were a number one seed, and they finished as the runner-up to South Carolina. Along the way to its runner-up finish, the team defeated ninth-seeded , fifth-seeded (2OT), third-seeded and fifth-seeded Old Dominion. The team ended with a 22–11 (8–8) record.

Michigan&#x27;s 2006–07 team earned an eight seed in the 2007 Big Ten Conference men&#x27;s basketball tournament, when it defeated the ninth-seeded Minnesota Golden Gophers before succumbing to top-seeded Ohio State. After receiving a three seed, Michigan advanced to the second round of the 2007 National Invitation Tournament by beating before falling to . The team finished with a 22–13 record yet only 8–8 in conference play.

Amaker was credited for helping to restore the ethical reputation of a Michigan program which had been tarnished by scandal. However, he was criticized in the press for being unable to take the Wolverines to the NCAA tournament in six seasons at the helm. Some fans and sportswriters argued that Amaker&#x27;s Michigan teams tended to underachieve and fall apart in pressure situations, particularly in conference, on the road and at the end of the regular season. On March 17, 2007, Amaker was fired by the University of Michigan. Amaker was paid $900,000 to buy out the remaining years on his contract.

===Harvard===

On April 11, 2007, Amaker was named head men&#x27;s basketball coach at Harvard University. Harvard&#x27;s recruiting process had included interviewing the underclassmen on the team who preferred Amaker to alternatives that included Mike Jarvis and Mike Gillian. Upon his arrival, Harvard had endured five consecutive non-winning seasons, a streak that Amaker would not halt until his third year. Amaker became the only African American among the head coaches of Harvard&#x27;s 32 athletic teams. Amaker&#x27;s Harvard team beat his former team, Michigan, in his eighth game as coach at Harvard during the 2007–08 season. It was the school&#x27;s first win ever against a BCS conference school.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; published an accusatory article in March 2008, raising allegations of diminished academic standards among Amaker&#x27;s first class of recruits and potentially improper recruiting practices. Prodded by this negative publicity, the Ivy League office conducted a four-month investigation and &quot;determined that no violations of NCAA or Ivy League rules occurred&quot;, clearing Amaker and his staff completely. Typically, the NCAA would accept the results of a formal investigation performed by a conference office but, in this case, the NCAA initially tabled and then eventually rejected the Ivy League&#x27;s findings completely. The NCAA commenced its own investigation which ultimately took two years to complete.

Amaker&#x27;s Harvard squad defeated then-ranked Boston College (#17 AP Poll – #24 Coaches&#x27; Poll) on January 7, 2009 for the first win over a ranked team in the program&#x27;s history. His 2008–09 recruiting class was the first time an Ivy League institution was ranked in the top 25 by ESPN.
The following season, the 2009–10 Harvard team played competitively against #14 ranked Connecticut getting 30 points and 9 rebounds from senior Jeremy Lin on December 6. Although they held the lead only once, they were within 4 points in the final seconds of the game. They also won their December 9 rematch with Boston College by a 74–67 margin. After coaching Harvard to its highest single-season win total ever behind the play of Lin, Harvard was invited to participate in the 2010 CollegeInsider.com Tournament. The team was defeated in the first round by Appalachian State. During the season, Amaker was a nominee for the first Ben Jobe Award as the top minority Division I college basketball coach, and was recognized by Fox Sports as the 2010 Ivy League Coach of the Year. Amaker was mentioned for the 2010 head coach opening at St. John&#x27;s.

In the summer of 2010, the NCAA informed Harvard that Amaker&#x27;s behavior constituted impermissible recruiting behavior. Harvard and the NCAA negotiated a settlement in which the university would &quot;declare&quot; what the NCAA consented to classify as secondary violations. Under the terms of the agreement, Harvard accepted punitive recruiting restrictions for the 2010–11 season. These were the first NCAA penalties ever assessed against the Harvard men&#x27;s basketball program and the first instance of the Ivy League being overruled on a formal rules interpretation.

Under Amaker&#x27;s leadership, the 2010–11 team tied with Princeton for the 2010–11 Ivy League men&#x27;s basketball season championship, which was the school&#x27;s first men&#x27;s basketball Ivy League championship since the league was formed in the 1956–57 season. Harvard finished the season a perfect 14–0 at home, which surpassed the prior season&#x27;s school record of 11 home wins. Harvard&#x27;s 12 conference game wins established a school record. The team&#x27;s victory over Colorado was the Crimson&#x27;s first against a Big 12 Conference opponent since that conference commenced play in 1996. His fourth season also marked the fourth straight season that Harvard defeated at least one power conference opponent. Although Harvard never appeared in the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball rankings, for a few weeks during the season they received a vote in the AP Poll. On March 7, Harvard received a vote in both the AP Poll and the Coaches&#x27; Poll. Harvard faced Ivy League co-champion Princeton in a one-game playoff and lost by a 63–62 margin. Princeton earned the 2011 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament automatic bid, while Harvard earned an at-large bid to the 2011 National Invitation Tournament, marking the school&#x27;s first appearance in the National Invitation Tournament. On March 15, Harvard was defeated by by a 71–54 margin in the first round. The final record of 23–7 established a school record for number of wins, surpassing the prior season&#x27;s total of 21. Amaker was again a finalist for the Ben Jobe Award, was a finalist for the Hugh Durham Award and was selected by the NABC as the District 13 Coach of the Year. He was named Ivy League coach of the year by Collegeinsider.com.

The 2011–12 Harvard team defeated then-ranked Florida State (#22 AP Poll – #20 Coaches&#x27; Poll) on November 25, 2011 for the school&#x27;s second win over a ranked team in the program&#x27;s history, and the highest ranked opponent in the Coaches&#x27; Poll that Harvard had defeated up to that point. On December 5, 2011, Harvard made its first appearance in either the AP Poll (25) or Coaches&#x27; Poll (24). It left Brown as the only remaining Ivy League school to have never been ranked in the AP Poll and leaves only seven schools that have played Division I basketball since the AP Poll began that have never been ranked in it. Harvard was the first Ivy League team ranked in the Coaches&#x27; Poll since the 2009–10 Cornell Big Red and the first Ivy League team ranked in the AP Poll since the 1997–98 Princeton Tigers, who finished 8th in the poll. By January 2, the team achieved rankings of 22 in the AP Poll and 21 in the Coaches&#x27; Poll. The team was also ranked 21st in the Coaches&#x27; Poll on February 6. The team established a new record for single-season wins as well as single-season non-league wins and tied the record for conference game wins. Amaker was selected by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association as the 2011–12 Men&#x27;s District I (ME, VT, NH, RI, MA, CT) Coach of the Year. He won the NABC Coach of the Year for District 13 and was again a finalist for both the Ben Jobe Award and the Hugh Durham Award. On March 6, 2012, Harvard earned its first bid to the NCAA tournament since 1946.

On October 6, 2012, Amaker was inducted into his high school&#x27;s inaugural hall of fame class. Amaker&#x27;s 2012–13 Harvard team entered the season affected by the 2012 Harvard cheating scandal. Instead of being the favorite as originally expected, the team was predicted to finish second to Princeton by various media sources because Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry withdrew due to the scandal. Casey and Curry had been first-team and second-team All-Ivy selections for the 2011–12 Ivy League men&#x27;s basketball season, respectively. Both players withdrew in hopes of preserving their final year of athletic eligibility following the investigation. During the season, the team defeated Boston College its fifth consecutive victory against Boston College Eagles men&#x27;s basketball, making Amaker a perfect 6–0 against the Atlantic Coast Conference. The 2012–13 Harvard team overcame the withdrawal of its senior co-captains to repeat as 2013 Ivy League champions, which earned Harvard a trip to the 2013 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. On March 21, 14th-seeded Harvard earned the school&#x27;s first NCAA tournament victory by a 68–62 margin and its first victory over a top 10 opponent when it defeated 3rd-seeded New Mexico (#10 AP Poll – #10 Coaches&#x27; Poll). Two nights later, Harvard lost to Arizona 74–51. Following the season, Amaker was inducted into the New England Basketball Hall of Fame class of 2013. Amaker won the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association (NSSA) Clarence &quot;Big House&quot; Gaines College Basketball Coach of the Year in Division I as the top minority coach, the NABC Coach of the Year for District 13 and was again a finalist for the Ben Jobe Award. In August, Amaker was inducted into his fourth Hall of Fame (Washington Metro Basketball Hall of Fame).

The 2013–14 team won the 2013 Great Alaska Shootout and 2013–14 Ivy League conference regular season championship with a 13–1 record and posting a school record 27 wins against 5 defeats. The team entered the 2014 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament with a number twelve seed where it defeated a (#15 AP Poll – #14 Coaches&#x27; Poll) Cincinnati team that was seeded fifth. Harvard eventually lost to number (#11/13) four seed Michigan State. The team was the first Ivy League school to win games in consecutive NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournaments since the 1983–84 Princeton Tigers.

The 2014–15 team was the first Ivy League team to make a fifth consecutive postseason appearance since the 2001–02 Princeton Tigers men&#x27;s basketball team completed a seven-year run for Princeton. They were the third Ivy team to make four consecutive NCAA basketball tournament appearances, a feat last accomplished by the 1991–92 Princeton Tigers men&#x27;s basketball team.

On December 7, 2016, in a rivalry contest against Boston College, Amaker earned his 179th win with the 2016–17 team, surpassing Frank Sullivan as Harvard&#x27;s all-time winningest coach. Amaker led the 2017–18 Harvard Crimson to a share of the 2017–18 Ivy League men&#x27;s basketball season regular season title. The team reached the championship game of the 2018 Ivy League men&#x27;s basketball tournament, but lost to Penn earning an automatic bid to the 2018 National Invitation Tournament.

In addition to his coaching duties at Harvard, Amaker served as a Special Assistant to Harvard University President Larry Bacow and a Spring 2021 Fellow at the Hauser Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School. In February 2021, he was named as a Champion of Diversity by the NCAA.

==Personal life==
Amaker is married to Stephanie Pinder-Amaker, who is a licensed clinical psychologist. The couple met at Duke. Amaker&#x27;s grandmother is Annie Deskins. Amaker&#x27;s mother, Alma, continued to make him the sauce for his favorite meal of spaghetti and express mail it to him from her home in Falls Church, Virginia, during his career at least until his days at Michigan. According to Duke teammate Bilas, Amaker was quite fashion-conscious and attempted to be a trendsetter.

At Michigan, his daily routine included breakfast at a local hotel where he read &quot;USA Today&quot;. At Harvard, once a month, he convenes The Breakfast Club at the Cambridge, Massachusetts, restaurant Henrietta&#x27;s Table with a group of noted African-American scholars and businessmen led by Harvard Law School professor Charles Ogletree to discuss sociopolitical issues. Amaker is known for his trademark mock turtleneck shirts, each of which has his initials monogrammed into the collar, and for wearing a sports coat at each news conference. Unlike most of his peers, Amaker avoids the press and will not do a radio or television show.

Amaker was enshrined in the Duke Athletic Hall of Fame in 2001. He was a member of the board of directors for USA Basketball. During his time on the board he served as a member of the Men&#x27;s Collegiate and Men&#x27;s Senior National Committees, where he helped select members of the United States 1996 Olympic gold medal team. Amaker owns two vintage Mercedes-Benz cars, which were featured in an article in The Star Magazine, and is a Washington Commanders fan.

<text>The Moskvitch-2141, also known under the trade name Aleko (Russian: &quot;АЛЕКО&quot;, derivative from the name of the automaker &quot;Автомобильный завод имени Ленинского Комсомола&quot;, &quot;Avtomobilnyj zavod imeni Leninskogo Komsomola&quot;, meaning &quot;Automotive Factory of Lenin&#x27;s Komsomol&quot;), is a Russian mid-size car that was first announced in 1985 and sold in the Soviet Union and its successor states between 1986 and 1997 by the Moskvitch Company, based in Moscow, Russia. It was replaced by the modernised M-2141-02 Svyatogor and its sedan body version, the M-2142, in 1997–2002.

The Aleko was a huge improvement over previous Moskvitch models, which were durable but old-fashioned sedans (saloons) and station wagons (estates) with rear-wheel drive and a solid rear axle, and had no common parts with them apart from the engine and some other minor details.

==Features==

The new car had such innovative features as front-wheel drive, a hatchback body style, MacPherson strut front suspension and torsion-crank rear suspension. It had rack-and-pinion steering and a collapsible steering column. The spare tyre was located underneath the boot and was accessible from outside, in the tradition of French cars. The wheelbase went up almost , the body got wider, the wheel size went up one inch (14 inches). The car became more spacious, comfortable and safe. For the first time in the history of Soviet and Russian car making, the car&#x27;s profile was optimized for aerodynamics, with the help of Russian and, partially, French engineers, who shortly cooperated with them at the final stage of the development process. The officially reported drag coefficient was 0.35.

==History==

Before the development of the M-2141 started, Moskvitch engineers had been working on a new series of rear-wheel drive cars and had developed it to the stage of pre-production prototypes. However, surprisingly for them, the Minister of Automobile Industry required them to cease all work on the unfinished project and instead create a front-wheel drive car with its upper part identical to that of the French Simca 1307, which was favoured by him. While this decision helped to cut the development costs, it came as an insult to the engineers and designers, who had their own mock-ups of the future car ready. Designer Igor Zaytsev recalled that it took more than a month to motivate his disappointed colleagues to get involved in the new project.

However, besides the fact that the AZLK designers considered it &quot;insulting and humiliating&quot; to copy an existing car, it came out that the new powertrain and chassis required a different bodyshell, and despite the two cars having similar shapes, the only parts of the French car that were borrowed to the Moskvitch-2141 were some constructive elements of the roof and the form of the window seals. As the company&#x27;s chief designer Yuri Tkachenko stated in 1992, the differences between the Simca and the M-2141 were so numerous and significant that it was more correct to say what details were borrowed from the Simca rather than what was added to its design. It is only the top of the body that these models have in common. The existing engine was too long for transverse placement, so it was placed longitudinally, like on the Renault 20/30 or Audi 80/100 series.

The Aleko turned out to be quite a breakthrough for the Soviet automotive industry of its time. It almost became the first front-wheel drive hatchback of the Soviet Union, but due to the fact that its development took a further two years for Moskvitch to set up the manufacturing, the Lada Samara arrived first.
Although the M-2141 had a more comfortable design than the Samara, the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 followed by an economic crisis, financial mismanagement and disruptions in the work of the company caused a decline in assembling quality in the 1990s and damaged the reputation of this car in the markets. Nonetheless, even then, it was still praised for a high level of passive safety, robustness of construction, good off-road capabilities, and ease of repair. In 2001 the aging M-2141, designed in the late 1970s and early 1980s and lacking modern airbags and seatbelts with pretensioners, was awarded zero stars out of a possible four by the new Russian ARCAP safety assessment program, but the reviewers pointed out that for a 20-year-old car it showed an &quot;excellent&quot; crash-test result. The steering column and the A-pillar were displaced less than in the Citroën Xantia and early Audi A4.

Before 1991, AZLK designers also created the four-wheel-drive Moskvich-21416SE and a sedan version of the M-2141 equipped with a different steering wheel and an electronic instrument cluster that was publicly demonstrated in 1990, but none of these cars were put into series production due to the hardships brought by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Although AZLK had designed and fully tested a new and more powerful generation of four-cylinder gasoline and diesel engines for the M-2141, the construction of the company&#x27;s engine production plant was stopped and never resumed.
The Aleko was sold mostly on the domestic market, but in the late 1980s it was exported too. In some export markets, including France and Germany, the cars were advertised as the Lada Aleko, and diesel engines from Ford and Indenor could be delivered in addition to the standard petrol engines. The Ford diesel engine, manufactured in Dagenham, UK, made it onto the AZLK production lines in September 1991. Moskvitch had been negotiating the construction of an engine factory in the Soviet Union but the plans were scuppered by a lack of hard currency. The Aleko was also assembled in Bulgaria under licence for a brief period in the late 1980s.

Some of the last Moskvitch models to be built were the upgraded and facelifted Alekos that were renamed Svyatogor (models 214122, 214100, 214145). A version with the wheelbase extended by called the Yury Dolgorukiy (2141Y2 &quot;Юрий Долгорукий&quot;; 1997–2002, named after the historic Grand Prince of Kiev) was also built, albeit only in small numbers. Still based on the design of the M-2141, the Dolgorukiy was built in two series: the first had the original, large, rectangular headlamps, while the second series received the Svyatogor&#x27;s facelifted front treatment.

In 1990, the Aleko was involved in a fatal accident that saw the death of Viktor Tsoi of Kino (band).

<doc id="1210297" wikidata="Q581627" url="?curid=1210297" title="G and H-class destroyer">
<text>The G- and H-class destroyers were a group of 18 destroyers built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s. Six additional ships being built for the Brazilian Navy when World War II began in 1939 were purchased by the British and named the &quot;Havant&quot; class. The design was a major export success with other ships built for the Argentine and Royal Hellenic Navies. They were assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet upon completion and enforced the Non-Intervention Agreement during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939.

Most ships were recalled home or were sent to the North Atlantic from October–November 1939, after it became clear that Fascist Italy was not going to intervene in World War II. Then they began to escort convoys and patrol for German submarines and commerce raiders. Two ships were lost to German mines in the first six months of the war. Three more were lost during the Norwegian Campaign, one in combat with a German cruiser and two during the First Battle of Narvik in April 1940. The Battle of France was the next test for the destroyers from May–June, with many of the Gs and &quot;Havant&quot;s participating in the evacuation of Dunkirk and the subsequent evacuations of Allied troops from western France. Three ships were sunk, two by bombs and the other to torpedoes. Most of the H-class ships were sent to the Mediterranean in May in case Mussolini decided to attack France and the majority of the surviving Gs were sent to Force H at Gibraltar in July. Two of them, and , participated in the Battle of Dakar, before being assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet with their sister ships. By the end of the year, the ships participated in several battles with the Royal Italian Navy, losing two to Italian mines and torpedoes, while sinking two Italian submarines. The &quot;Havant&quot;s spent most of the war in the North Atlantic on convoy escort duties, losing half their number to German submarines, while helping to sink six in exchange by the end of the war.

The G- and H-class ships of the Mediterranean Fleet escorted numerous Malta convoys, participated in the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941 and covered the evacuation of troops from Greece and Crete from May–June, losing two to German bombers and another so badly damaged that she was later written off. By the end of the year, they had sunk three submarines, two Italian and one German. Three Hs participated in the Second Battle of Sirte in March 1942, during which one was damaged. Further damaged by aerial attacks, she was ordered to Gibraltar and ran aground in transit and had to be destroyed. Another was torpedoed and lost during Operation Vigorous in June. The ships sank two more submarines during 1942 and three destroyers began conversion to escort destroyers late that year and early in 1943. Two of the four surviving Gs and Hs were transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) while under conversion. All of the surviving ships joined their &quot;Havant&quot; half-sisters on escort duty in the North Atlantic in 1943.

One ship was sent to the Mediterranean in 1944 while three others were transferred to the UK in preparation for Operation Overlord. Between them they sank five German submarines in 1944 with another in 1945. Worn-out and obsolete, the survivors were either broken up for scrap or sold off after the war.

==Design and description (G and H classes) ==
The G class were ordered as part of the 1933 Naval Construction Programme, the H class following in 1934. These ships were based on the preceding F class, but the elimination of cruising turbines and the development of more compact machinery allowed their dimensions and displacement to be slightly reduced. The H class were repeats of the G&#x27;s with some minor differences. All of the destroyers were fitted with ASDIC (sonar) and the ability to use the Two-Speed Destroyer Sweep (TSDS) minesweeping gear.

The G- and H-class destroyers displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . Their peacetime complement was 137 officers and ratings, which was intended to increase to 146 in wartime. The ships were at their stability limit as built and the Director of Naval Construction believed that no additions in top weight should be made without an equal amount of weight being removed.

They were powered by two Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one propeller shaft, using steam provided by three Admiralty 3-drum boilers that operated at a pressure of and a temperature of . was fitted with one Johnson boiler in her aft boiler room. The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . The destroyers carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave them a range of at .

All of the ships had the same main armament, four quick-firing (QF) Mark IX guns in single mounts, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. The guns had a maximum elevation of 40°; the G class achieved this with a lowered section of the deck around the mount, the &quot;well&quot;, that allowed the breech of the gun to be lowered below deck height, but the new gun mount used in the H class was designed to reach that elevation without the necessity for the clumsy &quot;wells&quot;. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of to a range of . served as the testbed for the twin 4.7-inch gun mount used for the and the J, K and N classes that temporarily replaced &#x27;B&#x27; gun. For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had two quadruple mounts for the QF 0.5-inch Vickers Mk III machine gun on platforms between the funnels. The G- and H-class ships were fitted with two quadruple mounts for 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, although trialled the new quintuple mount. The ships were also equipped with two throwers and one rack for 20 depth charges.

The main guns were controlled by an Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mk I that used data derived from the manually-operated director-control tower and the separate rangefinder situated above the bridge. They had no capability for anti-aircraft fire and the anti-aircraft guns were aimed solely by eye. and &quot;Hereward&quot; saw the introduction of a new style of bridge that would become standard on all Royal Navy fleet destroyers from the through to the of 1944. This was necessary as &quot;Hereward&quot; was fitted with a prototype twin-gun mounting that had a trunnion height higher than the previous weapons, therefore it was necessary to raise the wheelhouse to allow the helmsman to see over the top. Raising the wheelhouse meant it had to be placed in front of, rather than underneath, the bridge, and it was given angled sides, resulting in a characteristic wedge shape with a sloping roof.

===Wartime modifications===
Beginning in May 1940, the after bank of torpedo tubes was removed and replaced with a QF 12-pounder Mk V anti-aircraft gun, the after mast and funnel being cut down to improve the gun&#x27;s field of fire. Four to eight QF 20 mm Oerlikon cannons were added to the surviving ships, usually replacing the .50-calibre machine gun mounts between the funnels. One pair of these was added to the bridge wings and the other pair was mounted the searchlight platform. Early in the war, depth charge stowage increased to 44. By 1943, only four ships were still afloat and all had the &#x27;Y&#x27; gun on the quarterdeck removed to allow for additional depth charge stowage and two additional depth charge throwers. The 12-pounder was removed to allow for the installation of a Huff-Duff radio direction finder on a short mainmast and for more depth charges. All of the survivors, except , had &#x27;A&#x27; or &#x27;B&#x27; gun replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar, and their director-control tower and rangefinder above the bridge removed in exchange for a Type 271 target-indication radar. &#x27;A&#x27; gun was later replaced in while &quot;Hero&quot; had exchanged &#x27;B&#x27; gun for a Hedgehog and a twin-gun mount for QF six-pounder Hotchkiss guns for use against U-boats at very close range. A Type 286 short-range, surface-search radar, adapted from the Royal Air Force&#x27;s ASV radar, was also added. The early models, however, could only scan directly forward and had to be aimed by turning the entire ship.

===Flotilla leaders===

As per the E and F class, the flotilla leaders were built to an enlarged design, incorporating a fifth 4.7-inch gun in &#x27;Q&#x27; position, between the funnels and were based on the F-class leader, . &quot;Grenville&quot; was shorter and heavier than &quot;Hardy&quot; as she used compact Yarrow-type side fired boilers while &quot;Hardy&quot; was slightly beamier. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . The ships carried a total of 175 personnel which included the staff of the Captain (D), commanding officer of the flotilla. Their turbines were more powerful than the private ships, which made them faster; their propulsion machinery was otherwise identical. Both ships were early wartime losses and consequently received no modifications.

==&quot;Havant&quot; class==
The &quot;Havant&quot;s were laid down in 1938 for Brazil and requisitioned on 5 September 1939. They were optimized for anti-submarine work and were completed without &#x27;Y&#x27; gun and were equipped with eight throwers and three racks for a total of 110 depth charges. Unlike their half-sisters, they were fitted with a combined rangefinder-director above the bridge. Wartime modifications were similar to the other G- and H-class ships as a 12-pounder AA gun replaced the aft torpedo tubes, 20 mm Oerlikons were added on the bridge wings and a Type 286 radar was installed. Later modifications replaced the .50-calibre machine guns with a pair of Oerlikons, a Type 271 radar was added that replaced the rangefinder-director, a Hedgehog was substituted for &#x27;A&#x27; gun, the 12-pounder removed for more depth charge stowage, and a HF/DF mast was installed aft.

==Ships==
===Royal Navy===
====G class====

====H class====


====&quot;Havant&quot; class====
These six ships were ordered by the Brazilian Navy, but on the outbreak of World War II, they were requisitioned by the Royal Navy. They are usually included with the H class.

===Argentine Navy===
Seven ships were built for the Argentine Navy as the , they were delivered in 1938. They were built by Vickers Armstrongs (Barrow), Cammell Laird and John Brown &amp; Company (Clydebank). One ship was lost after a collision in 1941, but the remaining ships were in service until broken up in the early 1970s.

===Brazilian Navy===
Brazil ordered six &quot;Jurua&quot;-class ships from Britain in 1938. These ships were purchased by Britain on the outbreak of war in 1939 and are described above. The Brazilians decided to produce indigenous destroyers, the , at the Ilha das Cobras shipyard, Rio de Janeiro. The design was based on the H-class plans supplied by Britain, but with guns and machinery supplied by the United States. Although laid down in 1940, the ships were not completed until 1949–1951.

===Royal Hellenic Navy===
Two ships, modified versions of the G class, were built for the Greek Royal Hellenic Navy (RHN) by Yarrow in the late 1930s. The ships were fitted with German-made guns and AA guns. The number of torpedo tubes was reduced by two on these ships to compensate for the additional topweight. The installation of the armament was carried out in Greece as the Germans refused to ship the weapons to Britain. , named after King George I, served with the RHN during the Greco-Italian War. Damaged by German aircraft, the ship managed to reach the Salamis Navy Yard and was put in dry dock for repairs, where after further damage during German air attacks, she was finally scuttled to prevent capture. The Germans raised and repaired her and she was commissioned into the Kriegsmarine as &quot;Hermes&quot; (ZG3) on 21 March 1942. &quot;Hermes&quot; was heavily damaged off Cape Bon, Tunisia, on 30 April 1943 and scuttled on 7 May 1943. , named after Queen Olga, served with the RHN during the Greco-Italian War. Along with other ships, she escaped to Alexandria in May 1941 and joined the Allied forces. She was lost to German aircraft while anchored in Lakki Bay, Leros, on 26 September 1943.

==Service==

&quot;Grenville&quot; and the G class spent the bulk of their time before the start of World War II assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla (DF) in the Mediterranean Fleet, where they made a number of neutrality patrols during the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939. With the exception of &quot;Garland&quot; which was under repair at Malta after a premature explosion of her depth charges, they returned home in October–November after it became clear that the Italians would not enter the war. &quot;Hardy&quot; and the H-class ships were assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla and joined the Gs in the Mediterranean after commissioning for similar duties.

After a few weeks assigned to Western Approaches Command, the 1st DF was assigned to the Nore Command at Harwich, although some of the ships were transferred to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla, where they were tasked for escort and patrol duty. &quot;Gipsy&quot; was sunk on 21 November after she struck a mine, as did &quot;Grenville&quot; on 19 January 1940. Unlike the 1st DF, the Second was transferred to Force K in Freetown in West Africa, to help search for German commerce raiders. Some ships were later transferred to Bermuda and the West Indies for escort work and patrolling. They returned to the UK in January and spent several months refitting.

After commissioning, &quot;Handy&quot; and &quot;Hearty&quot; were renamed &quot;Harvester&quot; and &quot;Hesperus&quot;, respectively, to avoid confusion with &quot;Hardy&quot;. The &quot;Havant&quot;-class destroyers initially formed the 9th Destroyer Flotilla assigned to Western Approaches Command for anti-submarine patrols and escort duty. The German invasion of Norway caused &quot;Havant&quot;, &quot;Hesperus&quot;, and &quot;Havelock&quot; to be detached to reinforce the Home Fleet during the Norwegian Campaign.

&quot;Garland&quot;, &quot;Grafton&quot;, &quot;Gallant&quot;, &quot;Hasty&quot; and &quot;Hereward&quot; were either under repair or refitting during the early stages of the Norwegian Campaign and did not participate in the Battles of Narvik in April. The remaining ships were assigned to the Home Fleet by this time. &quot;Glowworm&quot; was separated from the battlecruiser in a heavy storm on 8 April and encountered the German heavy cruiser and several destroyers. The British destroyer could not disengage and was sunk after ramming &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot;. &quot;Hardy&quot;, &quot;Havock&quot;, &quot;Hostile&quot;, &quot;Hotspur&quot; and &quot;Hunter&quot; participated in the First Battle of Narvik on 10 April. They sank two German destroyers in exchange for the loss of &quot;Hardy&quot; and &quot;Hunter&quot;, while &quot;Hotspur&quot; was badly damaged. That same day, &quot;Hero&quot; sank the off the Norwegian coast and was the only G- or H-class destroyer to participate in the Second Battle of Narvik three days later. &quot;Griffin&quot; and &quot;Hasty&quot; helped to cover the evacuation of Allied troops from Namsos and Åndalsnes at the end of the month. &quot;Havelock&quot; escorted the transports conducting the evacuation of Narvik in June. &quot;Garland&quot; was loaned to the Polish Navy in May after her repairs were finished and she remained in the Mediterranean, escorting convoys between Malta and Alexandria, Egypt, until she was transferred to the Western Approaches Command in September.

In mid-May, the 2nd DF was transferred to the Mediterranean with &quot;Hostile&quot;, &quot;Hyperion&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot;, &quot;Hereward&quot;, &quot;Havock&quot;, and &quot;Hasty&quot; assigned. Later that month, many of the remaining G and &quot;Havant&quot;-class ships participated in Operation Dynamo. &quot;Grafton&quot; was torpedoed by on 29 May whilst rescuing survivors from the torpedoed destroyer and had to be scuttled by the destroyer . Later that day, &quot;Grenade&quot; blew up after being set on fire by German bombs; three days later, on 1 June, &quot;Havant&quot; was scuttled after being attacked by German bombers. &quot;Gallant&quot; and &quot;Greyhound&quot; were damaged while evacuating troops from Dunkirk. &quot;Harvester&quot; helped to evacuate more troops from Saint-Valery-en-Caux in Operation Cycle and, together with &quot;Griffin&quot;, &quot;Highlander&quot;, and &quot;Havelock&quot;, she participated in Operation Aerial, the evacuation of Allied troops from Saint-Nazaire and St. Jean de Luz.

Most of the ships of the 2nd DF participated in the inconclusive Battle of Calabria on 7–8 July. Almost two weeks later, &quot;Hasty&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot;, &quot;Hyperion&quot; and &quot;Havock&quot; were escorting the Australian light cruiser when they encountered two Italian light cruisers, sinking one of them in the Battle of Cape Spada. The ships escorted convoys and the ships of the Mediterranean Fleet for the rest of the year, although &quot;Hostile&quot; was sunk when she struck an Italian mine on 23 August and &quot;Hyperion&quot; was sunk by the on 22 December. &quot;Hotspur&quot; was assigned to the 13th Destroyer Flotilla, supporting Force H at Gibraltar in July; she was joined by &quot;Gallant&quot;, &quot;Greyhound&quot;, and &quot;Griffin&quot; shortly afterwards. The latter two ships escorted Force H during the Battle of Dakar in September against the Vichy French forces there. &quot;Havock&quot; and &quot;Hasty&quot; sank the on 2 October off the coast of Cyrenica while &quot;Gallant&quot;, &quot;Griffin&quot; and &quot;Hotspur&quot; sank the on 18 October. &quot;Gallant&quot;, &quot;Greyhound&quot;, &quot;Griffin&quot;, now assigned to the 14th Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet, together with &quot;Hero&quot; and &quot;Hereward&quot;, participated in the inconclusive Battle of Cape Spartivento on 27 November.
The 9th DF returned to the Western Approaches Command (WAC) from July to September, before they were briefly transferred to Portsmouth Command for several weeks, in response to the possible invasion (Operation Sea Lion). They returned to the WAC before the end of the month and &quot;Harvester&quot; and &quot;Highlander&quot; sank on 30 October. In November 1940, the 9th DF was re-designated as the 9th Escort Group. The &quot;Havant&quot;s remained on escort duty until they began lengthy refits during 1941.

&quot;Gallant&quot;, &quot;Greyhound&quot; and &quot;Griffin&quot; were covering a convoy to Malta on 10 January when the former struck a mine that blew off her bow. &quot;Griffin&quot; rescued her crew and the ship was towed to Malta. Repairs were estimated to take until June 1942, but she was declared a constructive total loss and stripped of equipment after she had to be beached during an aerial attack on 5 April 1942. On 19 January, &quot;Greyhound&quot; sank the after the latter torpedoed one of the ships in the convoy that &quot;Greyhound&quot; was escorting. Two months later, she sank the on 6 March. &quot;Greyhound&quot;, &quot;Griffin&quot;, &quot;Hotspur&quot;, &quot;Hasty&quot;, &quot;Havock&quot; and &quot;Hereward&quot; participated in the Battle of Cape Matapan on 27–28 March. &quot;Greyhound&quot; was sunk by German dive bombers two months later, on 22 May, off Crete; &quot;Hereward&quot; suffered a similar fate a week later. &quot;Hotspur&quot;, &quot;Havock&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot;, and &quot;Hasty&quot; also participated in the evacuations of Greece and Crete in May. The latter three ships then supported Allied forces during the Syria–Lebanon Campaign in June. All four of the H-class ships, joined by &quot;Griffin&quot;, began escorting convoys from Alexandria to Tobruk in July, as well as occasional convoys to Malta, and continued to do so for most of the rest of the year. &quot;Hasty&quot; and &quot;Hotspur&quot; sank on 23 December while returning from Tobruk.

&quot;Garland&quot; and the five surviving &quot;Havant&quot;s spent most of the year on convoy escort duties in the Atlantic aside from brief diversions such as Operation Tiger, a Mediterranean convoy in May that &quot;Harvester&quot;, &quot;Havelock&quot;, and &quot;Hesperus&quot; escorted, and &quot;Garland&quot;″s participation in the Spitzbergen Raid in July. &quot;Hurricane&quot; was badly damaged by a German bomb in May that took the rest of the year to repair.

&quot;Hesperus&quot; was transferred to Force H in December 1941 for anti-submarine defence of the Strait of Gibraltar and sank by ramming on 15 January 1942. In March 1942, the &quot;Havant&quot;-class destroyers were designated group leaders of the Mid-Ocean Escort Force through the winter of 1942–1943. &quot;Garland&quot; was assigned to the escort force for Convoy PQ 16 to Murmansk in May, during which she was damaged by a German bomber. After repairs, she rejoined her half-sisters in the North Atlantic. On 26 December, &quot;Hesperus&quot; sank by ramming.

&quot;Griffin&quot; and &quot;Hotspur&quot; were transferred to the Eastern Fleet in February 1942. &quot;Havock&quot;, &quot;Hasty&quot;, and &quot;Hero&quot; participated in the Second Battle of Sirte on 22 March during which the former was damaged. While under repair at Malta, she was further damaged and was then ordered to Gibraltar for repairs in a safer environment. Whilst in transit, she ran aground off the Tunisian coast during the night of 5/6 April due to a navigational error and had to be destroyed to prevent her capture. Together with the destroyers and , &quot;Hero&quot; sank on 28 May. To reinforce the escorts for Operation Vigorous, a convoy from Alexandria to Malta in June, &quot;Griffin&quot; and &quot;Hotspur&quot; were temporarily recalled to join their sisters. During the mission, &quot;Hasty&quot; was torpedoed by a German E-boat and had to be scuttled by &quot;Hotspur&quot; on 15 June. On 30 October, &quot;Hero&quot; shared the credit for sinking with five other destroyers and a Vickers Wellesley bomber of No. 42 Squadron RAF. &quot;Griffin&quot; arrived home that same month to begin her conversion into an escort destroyer. &quot;Garland&quot; remained in the North Atlantic until December 1943 when she began escorting convoys between Freetown and Gibraltar.

&quot;Hotspur&quot; and &quot;Hero&quot; were sent home and converted into escort destroyers in early 1943. &quot;Griffin&quot; and &quot;Hero&quot; were transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy in March and November 1943 and renamed &quot;Ottawa&quot; and &quot;Chaudière&quot;, respectively. &quot;Hotspur&quot; began escort duties in the WAC after her conversion was completed that lasted until October 1944. While escorting Convoy HX 228, &quot;Harvester&quot; rammed on 10 March, but was disabled in the process, so the French corvette &quot;Aconit&quot; finished off the submarine. The following day, &quot;Harvester&quot; was sunk by which was in turn sunk by &quot;Aconit&quot;. &quot;Hesperus&quot; sank on 23 April and on 12 May. &quot;Hesperus&quot; continued to escort convoys in the North Atlantic until January 1945 when she was transferred to the UK. &quot;Highlander&quot; and &quot;Hurricane&quot; also remained on convoy duties, although the latter ship was torpedoed by on 24 December and had to be scuttled by the next day.
&quot;Garland&quot; was transferred to the Mediterranean in April 1944 and sank on 19 September. She began a lengthy refit in November and had barely finished working up when the war ended. &quot;Havelock&quot;, &quot;Ottawa&quot; and &quot;Chaudière&quot; were escorting convoys in the North Atlantic until they were transferred to the UK in preparation for Operation Overlord in May 1944. &quot;Chaudière&quot; and the escorts of Convoy HX 280 sank on 6 March. &quot;Ottawa&quot; sank three German submarines in 1944, with the corvette on 6 July, with &quot;Chaudière&quot; on 16 August and , also with &quot;Chaudière&quot;, two days later.

&quot;Ottawa&quot;, &quot;Chaudière&quot; and &quot;Hotspur&quot; also had lengthy overhauls that began in late 1944; the latter&#x27;s was completed in March 1945 and she then patrolled the Irish Sea until the end of the war while &quot;Ottawa&quot; returned to the North Atlantic when her refit was finished in February. &quot;Chaudière&quot;″s, however, was still not completed by the end of the war. &quot;Highlander&quot; struck a small iceberg on 15 April that crushed the underwater portion of her bow and was under repair for the next three months. &quot;Havelock&quot; and &quot;Hesperus&quot;, assisted by aircraft from No. 201 Squadron RAF, sank in the Irish Channel on 30 April.

===Postwar===
The surviving ships were essentially obsolete and worn-out when the war ended in May. &quot;Ottawa&quot; made several voyages ferrying Canadian troops back home before she was paid off in October. The ship was sold for scrap in 1946, but was not actually broken up until 1950. &quot;Chaudière&quot; was in the worst shape of any of the Canadian destroyers and was paid off in August, although she was not scrapped until 1950 like her sister. &quot;Garland&quot; transported food and other supplies to Dutch and Belgian towns immediately after the end of the war and was part of the Home Fleet until she was reduced to reserve in August 1946. She was purchased by the Royal Netherlands Navy in November 1947, renamed &quot;Marnix&quot;, and became a training ship until 1964. &quot;Hotspur&quot; remained in service until 1948 when she was sold to the Dominican Republic and renamed &quot;Trujillo&quot;. Renamed &quot;Duarte&quot; in 1962, the ship was sold for scrap in 1972. &quot;Havelock&quot; and &quot;Hesperus&quot; escorted the Norwegian government-in-exile back to Norway in May and then served as a target ship before being broken up in late 1946 and 1947, respectively. Like her sisters, &quot;Highlander&quot; served as a target ship after her repairs were completed and was scrapped beginning in May 1947.

<text>Paiste (English pronunciation: , ) is a Swiss musical instrument manufacturing company. It is the world&#x27;s third largest manufacturer of cymbals, gongs, and metal percussion. is an Estonian and Finnish word that means &quot;shine&quot;.

Apart from cymbals and gongs, Paiste has also manufactured other percussion instruments, including crotal bells, finger cymbals, and cowbells, which were later discontinued.

== History ==
The first Paiste cymbals were produced in 1906 by Estonian musician Toomas Paiste in his instrument repair shop in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire. Toomas had served in the Russian Imperial Guard and retired in 1901 to open a music shop and publishing business.

The cymbal-making aspect of the business expanded with the passing years, despite the disruption of several moves necessitated by war. The company opened a factory in Tallinn, Estonia, in 1917, where Toomas&#x27; son Michail M. Paiste decided to concentrate on cymbal production and export. In 1940, after the annexation of Estonia by the USSR, the family and the cymbal-making operation moved to Poland, where they continued under extremely difficult conditions, and in 1945 to Germany. Finally, in 1957, a new headquarters and production facility was established in Switzerland. The business was continued by Michail&#x27;s sons, Robert and Toomas (born Kurt), with both the Swiss and German operations as the main manufacturing centres. Since 2003, the company has been headed by Toomas&#x27; son, Erik. Robert Paiste died in 2016, aged 84.

== Innovations ==
Paiste has developed several innovations to cymbal design and manufacture. Among these are:
*The Flat Ride: A ride cymbal without a cup or bell. Originally designated as Space Sound in the Formula 602 line. Designed with Joe Morello. Introduced in the 1960s.
*The splash cymbal: Widely used for jazz music in the 1920s and 30s, the traditional splash cymbal was not seen for many years in mainstream music until The Police’s drummer Stewart Copeland brought it back to prominence in the early 80s. Thanks to a toy cymbal he found in a trip in Asia and which he brought to Paiste, heavier splash cymbals, more suited for harder styles of drumming, were soon available and started being heavily commercialized. Then alongside Manu Katché spread the use of this type of cymbal.
*The Sound Edge Hi-Hat: Introduced in 1967. To prevent airlock, the bottom cymbal of the hi-hat pair has ripples along the edge. Also applied to hand cymbal sets.
*The use of B8 bronze as a cymbal alloy: Referred to by Paiste as &quot;CuSn8&quot; alloy or &quot;2002 bronze&quot;. First introduced with the Stambul 65 series in 1965. Gained general acceptance with the Giant Beat and the 2002 series. Paiste was for a time the only major cymbal company to use the B8 alloy for its high-end lines, although Meinl has recently introduced a line of high-end cast B8 bronze cymbals as well. Zildjian and Sabian use this alloy primarily for entry-level lines, choosing instead to use bell bronze for high-end products.
* &#x27;Flat&#x27; bells: With the introduction of the Sound Creation Short Crash in late 1977, Paiste was the first to make use of a flattened bell design. Used today with the Crystal Hi-Hats and Crashes of the Signature series.
*Unlathed cymbals: Introduced in 1980 as the RUDE series. Made from the B8 alloy, unlathed cymbals were marketed towards louder music styles as punk and heavy metal.
*Inverted bell on China cymbal: Introduced in 1983 as the 2002 NOVO china type. Makes it easier to play ride and crash on a China cymbal.
*Coloured cymbals: Introduced in 1984.
*Proprietary Signature Bronze: A patented cymbal alloy introduced in 1989, with the Signature line. According to the patent, this alloy consists of phosphor bronze with a 14.7% to 15.1% tin content by weight. It has been claimed by Paiste to be the first bronze alloy specifically developed for cymbals.
*Sonic Texture Formula: Introduced in 2001 with the Innovations series. A patented lathing technique to get a more complex sounding cymbal.

Many of these innovations were used by other manufacturers when the applicable patents expired. For example, almost all the larger modern cymbal companies offer a flat ride cymbal and an alternative to the Sound Edge Hi-Hat.

<doc id="1210299" wikidata="Q5086086" url="?curid=1210299" title="Charlotte Oleson">
<text>Charlotte Louise Oleson (May 17, 1932 – February 19, 2017) was a Canadian politician who was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1990, and a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative government of Gary Filmon from 1988 to 1990.

==Career==
She was born Charlotte Louise Kingdon, the daughter of John Clarence Kingdon and Elsie Wilmot, and was educated at Minnedosa Collegiate, the Manitoba Provincial Normal School and Brandon College. In 1953, she married Stanley Adaljon Oleson. Prior to running for political office, Oleson raised three children and worked as librarian for the town of Glenboro and later for Glenboro Collegiate. She was a councillor in the Village of Glenboro from 1977 to 1980, and the Deputy Mayor of the community from 1980 to 1982. She also served as Vice-Chair of the Cypress Planning District from 1980 to 1982, and is a member of the Glenboro and Area Historical Society.

Oleson was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1981, winning victory in the rural riding of Gladstone. She was re-elected in the 1986 election, despite a credible showing from a candidate of the upstart Confederation of Regions Party. The Manitoba New Democratic Party won both of these elections, and Oleson sat in the opposition benches.

She was re-elected again in the provincial election of 1988, as the Progressive Conservatives formed a minority government under the leadership of Gary Filmon. On May 9, 1988, she was named Minister of Community Services and Minister of Employment Services and Economic Security with responsibility for the Status of Women. She resigned from the latter two responsibilities on April 21, 1989, to retire, and did not seek re-election in 1990.

Oleson remained an active member of the Glenboro community, serving as President of the Glenboro Development Corporation, Chair of the Friends of Spruce Wood Park, and the Criddle/Vane Homestead committee until she died on February 19, 2017, at the age of 84 years.

<doc id="1210300" wikidata="Q125197" url="?curid=1210300" title="Richard Nixon mask">
<text>A Richard Nixon mask is a mask with the likeness of Richard Nixon. It was commercially available and quite popular in the waning days of the administration. It is generally made out of vinyl by Cesar Mask (fr), a French company, and is sold worldwide. The most famous Nixon mask was the big nose Nixon comical mask that was made by Cesar in the 1970s. Later, other companies made similar versions made from latex rubber or similar flexible castable compounds.

One of the notable features of most Nixon masks is the classically-caricatured nose. Many of the different versions of the Nixon mask have a wide, grinning smile as well.

Although the masks were widely believed to be only a fad, which would presumably die down as the public attention on Watergate waned and once Nixon left office, the masks managed to outlive their presumed fad status by becoming popular during events such as Halloween and adult masquerade parties. The Nixon mask remains popular today and is worn both for humorous effect and in protest marches and similar &quot;public displays of disaffection&quot;. According to &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; magazine&#x27;s October 2002 &quot;Harper&#x27;s Index,&quot; Nixon masks were the best-selling political mask for the previous five years for the top U.S. costume wholesaler Morris Costumes.
== In popular culture ==
* Bob Dylan - musician and countercultural figure
* Manic Street Preachers - Welsh band in the video &quot;The Love of Richard Nixon,&quot; as well as the cover art for the single.
* John E. Fryer - psychiatrist and gay rights activist who wore a Nixon mask to conceal his appearance during a 1972 APA convention
* During Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers&#x27; Southern Accents 1985 tour, when &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Around Here No More&quot; reached the uptempo climax, actors in Nixon and Reagan masks came out and chased each other all over the stage.
* One of the bank robbers in the 1991 action film &quot;Point Break&quot;; the other robbers wore masks based on other recent presidents (Johnson, Carter, and Reagan). Many fictional uses of the mask reference this film.
*In &quot;Family Guy&quot;, Cleveland Brown is shown wearing one in &quot;The Tan Aquatic with Steve Zissou&quot; episode (2007).
*In the 2021 Netflix action film &quot;Army of Thieves&quot; the character Brad Cage is shown wearing a Nixon mask during the second robbery.
*The video games &quot;&quot; and &quot;Payday 2&quot; have the Nixon mask as an option for character customization.
* In &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, Eric Forman is shown nude wearing only the mask during a Ford speech in the episode &quot;Streaking&quot;.
* In season 3, episode 2 of &quot;I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson&quot;, the &quot;Darmine Doggy Door&quot; sketch features a pig wearing a Richard Nixon mask.

<doc id="1210303" wikidata="Q219150" url="?curid=1210303" title="Constantine (film)">
<text>Constantine ( ) is a 2005 American supernatural film directed by Francis Lawrence in his directorial debut. Written by Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello from a story by Brodbin, it is loosely based on the DC Comics/Vertigo Comics &quot;Hellblazer&quot; graphic novels. The film stars Keanu Reeves as John Constantine, a cynical exorcist with the ability to perceive and communicate with half-angels and half-demons in their true forms and to travel between Earth and Hell. Rachel Weisz, Shia LaBeouf, Tilda Swinton, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Djimon Hounsou, Gavin Rossdale, and Peter Stormare also feature.

&quot;Constantine&quot; was released theatrically in the United States on February 18, 2005, to mixed reviews, and grossed $230.9 million worldwide on a production budget between $70–100 million. It has garnered a cult following as reported by several outlets. A sequel is in development.

==Plot==

In Mexico, a scavenger discovers the tip of the spear that pierced Jesus Christ and, after becoming possessed, takes it to Los Angeles. There, cynical occult expert John Constantine exorcises a demon from a young girl after witnessing its attempt to reach Earth through her, something that should be impossible because of the treaty between Heaven and Hell. Suffering from terminal lung cancer, Constantine meets with the half-breed angel Gabriel to request an extension to his life in exchange for his work deporting Hell&#x27;s forces. Gabriel responds that performing good deeds for selfish reasons will not secure his way into Heaven.

Meanwhile, detective Angela Dodson investigates the death of her twin sister Isabel, who leaped from a psychiatric hospital roof. Angela refuses to believe her sister, a devout Catholic, would commit suicide and condemn herself to Hell. Watching security footage, Angela hears Isabel say &quot;Constantine&quot;, and seeks out his assistance. He refuses to help until he witnesses demons pursuing Angela and fends them off. Constantine then performs a ritual to see Isabel in Hell, confirming she killed herself. He reveals to Angela that he committed suicide as a teenager because of the trauma of seeing supernatural creatures. Although he was revived, his attempt has condemned him to Hell when he eventually dies.

At the morgue, Constantine&#x27;s friend Father Hennessy discovers a mysterious symbol on Isabel&#x27;s wrist but is killed by the half-breed demon Balthazar. Constantine and Angela later uncover that Hennessy carved the symbol into his own hand for them to find. Angela also discovers a hidden message from Isabel referencing a chapter from Hell&#x27;s Bible. Before being killed by Balthazar, Constantine&#x27;s ally Beeman reveals that the symbol represents the antichrist Mammon, Lucifer&#x27;s son. The chapter foretells Mammon usurping his father and conquering Earth using a powerful psychic and divine assistance; Isabel, a powerful psychic, sacrificed herself to thwart Mammon&#x27;s plan. Angela confesses that she possessed similar psychic abilities but repressed them to avoid being labeled insane like her sister. To help Angela rediscover her powers, Constantine induces a near-death experience. With her reawakened abilities, Angela locates Balthazar. Constantine interrogates Balthazar, who reveals that the blood of Christ on the spear tip is Mammon&#x27;s divine assistance, and Angela will be his host. An unseen entity destroys Balthazar and abducts Angela who becomes possessed by Mammon. 

With the help of witch doctor Papa Midnite, Constantine induces visions to locate Angela at the psychiatric hospital. Alongside his apprentice, Chas Kramer, Constantine arms himself and assaults the building, battling through hordes of demons to Angela. Constantine and Chas seemingly exorcise Mammon from her, but Chas is killed by the unseen force, revealed to be Gabriel. Resentful at God&#x27;s favoritism for humanity and forgiveness for even the most wicked, Gabriel intends to unleash Hell on Earth so that those who survive will become truly worthy of His love. Gabriel tosses Constantine away and prepares to stab Angela with the spear tip to unleash Mammon.

Desperate, Constantine commits suicide by slitting his wrists, knowing that Lucifer will personally come to collect him. Time pauses and Constantine convinces Lucifer to intervene and stop Mammon. Gabriel attempts to smite Lucifer, but is unable to, as Gabriel no longer has God&#x27;s favor. Lucifer burns Gabriel&#x27;s wings away while also banishing Mammon back to Hell. He then reluctantly offers to restore Constantine to life for his assistance. Constantine instead asks that Isabel be sent to Heaven. Lucifer releases Isabel and starts dragging Constantine to Hell, but Constantine begins ascending to Heaven for his selfless sacrifice. Infuriated, Lucifer restores Constantine to life and removes his cancer, believing that, in time, Constantine will prove he belongs in Hell. Constantine punches the now-mortal Gabriel before leaving and entrusts Angela with securing the spear tip. In a post-credits scene, Constantine visits Chas&#x27;s grave and witnesses him in an angelic form.

==Cast==
* Keanu Reeves as John Constantine: A chain-smoking cynical exorcist with the ability to perceive the true of half-angels and half-demons on the human plane. John is damned to Hell for attempting suicide — a mortal sin — and has terminal lung cancer.
** Connor Dylan Wryn as young John Constantine
** Quinn Buniel as child John Constantine
* Rachel Weisz as Angela Dodson: A troubled LAPD detective investigating the suicide of her twin sister Isabel (also portrayed by Weisz). 
** Weisz also portrays Mammon, the son of Lucifer who has no patience for his father&#x27;s rule of Hell and uses Angela&#x27;s body as a means of escaping to rule over Earth.
* Shia LaBeouf as Chas Kramer: Constantine&#x27;s driver and apprentice. Chas has a strong interest in the occult and helps Constantine whenever possible in order to gain knowledge and experience from him.
* Tilda Swinton as Gabriel: A &quot;half-breed&quot; Archangel with a disdain for humanity who plots to free Mammon as a means to unleash Hell on the Earth.
* Pruitt Taylor Vince as Father Hennessy: An insomniac, alcoholic priest with the ability to communicate with the dead. He wears a protective charm in order to &quot;keep the voices out&quot;.
* Djimon Hounsou as Papa Midnite: A former witch-doctor who once fought against Hell. After swearing an oath of neutrality — unless one side should tip the balance of power — he opened a nightclub to serve as neutral meeting ground for both sides of the war between Heaven and Hell.
* Gavin Rossdale as Balthazar: A &quot;half-breed&quot; demon, and son of Lucifer. He has a special interest in, and personal history with, Constantine.
* Peter Stormare as Lucifer: A fallen Archangel who is in a proxy war with God for the souls of all mankind, and ruler of Hell. He is feared on Earth as Satan or The Devil. Lucifer loathes Constantine with such vigor that Constantine&#x27;s soul is the only one he would ever come to personally collect, due to Constantine&#x27;s many fights against demons.
* Max Baker as Beeman: A friend of Constantine&#x27;s with extensive knowledge of exotic occult materials and insects. He supplies Constantine with both holy objects and information.
* Francis Guinan as Father Garret: A priest Angela talks to about getting Isabel a Catholic burial.
* José Zúñiga as Det. Weiss: Angela&#x27;s partner.
* Jesse Ramirez as Manuel: A scavenger and treasure hunter who finds the Spear of Destiny that grants various powers and places him in a trance-like state.
* April Grace as Dr. Archer: Constantine&#x27;s doctor.
* Tanoai Reed as the bouncer at Midnite&#x27;s club. 
* Valerie Azlynn as Angel in bar turning water into wine.

Additionally, Michelle Monaghan filmed several scenes as Ellie, a half-breed demon Constantine sleeps with and asks for information, who is based on a succubus of the same name in the &quot;Hellblazer&quot; comics. In the finished film, however, the role consists of two brief shots and one line of dialogue (&quot;Holy water?&quot;) during Constantine&#x27;s climactic confrontation with the group of half-breeds in the hospital. Director Francis Lawrence said Ellie&#x27;s relationship with Constantine was cut to make him more of a lonely character.

==Production==
The character of John Constantine was introduced by comic book writer/creator Alan Moore in &quot;The Saga of Swamp Thing&quot; #37, released in June 1985. In 1988, the character was given his own comic book title, &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, published by DC Comics.

Producer Lauren Shuler Donner began developing the film in 1997. Paul Hunter was attached to direct in 1999, and he was replaced by Tarsem Singh in 2001. Warner Bros. hoped to begin filming in 2002 with Nicolas Cage in the lead role, but Singh dropped out, resulting in opposing lawsuits filed by himself and Warner Bros. Keanu Reeves became attached to the film in 2002. Alan Moore, the original creator of John Constantine, was disappointed by the previous adaptations of his comics &quot;From Hell&quot; and &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, and refused to be credited or associated with this film, asking that his royalties be distributed among the other creators of the character.

&quot;Constantine&quot; incorporated some elements of Garth Ennis&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous Habits&quot; story arc from the comic (issues #41–46), and others, such as the inclusion of Papa Midnite, from the &quot;Original Sins&quot; trade paperback. The film&#x27;s title was changed from &quot;Hellblazer&quot; to &quot;Constantine&quot; to avoid confusion with Clive Barker&#x27;s &quot;Hellraiser&quot; films. In fact, the comic series was originally going to be titled &quot;Hellraiser&quot;, but was also retitled to avoid confusion with the first &quot;Hellraiser&quot; film, which was released a year before the debut of &quot;Hellblazer&quot;.

The film changed several aspects of the source material. For one, it was set in Los Angeles, rather than England, which director Francis Lawrence justified by claiming that the comic book was not exclusively set in London. Reeves played the role of John Constantine with his real-life American accent and black hair, while the character in the comics was drawn to resemble the blond musician Sting and came from Liverpool. For the film, Constantine was also given the psychic ability to see &quot;half-breeds&quot; as they truly are, and this led him to attempt suicide, causing his damnation, which, in the comics, was punishment for summoning a demon that killed a young girl. Additionally, the resolution of the lung cancer plotline in the film was amended so that Lucifer willingly saves the redeemed Constantine to give him a second chance at falling, rather than being tricked into doing so.
Director Lawrence decided to base the film&#x27;s conception of Hell &quot;on the geography of what&#x27;s around us now&quot;. He further explained:
==Music==
===Soundtrack===

Constantine: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released on February 15, 2005. It is an orchestral compilation of songs from the film, performed by The Hollywood Studio Symphony &amp; The Hollywood Film Chorale and composed by Brian Tyler, the composer for films such as &quot;Eagle Eye&quot; and &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot;, and Klaus Badelt. Two songs heard in the film, &quot;Passive&quot; by A Perfect Circle (heard as Constantine walks through Midnite&#x27;s bar) and &quot;Take Five&quot; by The Dave Brubeck Quartet (heard on a record played by Constantine), were not included on the soundtrack.

The album was panned by Allmusic, who referred to it as clichéd and &quot;religiously formulaic&quot;.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
The original release date for the film was September 17, 2004, but was subsequently pushed back to February 2005. Although the film was intended to be rated PG-13, it received an R-rating from the MPAA, which Lawrence attributed to its religious overtones.

===Home media===
The film was released on VHS and DVD in 2005. Warner Home Video intended to release the film on HD DVD on March 28, 2006, making it one of the earliest titles released on that media format, but, following delays to the launch of HD DVD, it actually debuted on June 6 the same year. It was released on Blu-ray Disc by Warner Home Video on October 14, 2008. For its 20th anniversary, the film was released on 4K Blu-ray on February 18, 2025.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Constantine&quot; opened in 3,006 theaters in the United States on February 18, 2005, earning $29.8 million in its opening weekend and ranking second behind &quot;Hitch&quot;&#x27;s second weekend. It ended its run on June 16, having grossed $76 million in the United States and Canada, and $154.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $230.9 million, against a production budget of $70–100 million.

===Contemporary reviews===
In a 20th anniversary retrospective for &quot;Fangoria&quot;, Ryan Scott noted that the film received mixed reviews at the time of its release, with its original review criticizing the story, but &quot;has since developed a pretty passionate [cult] following.&quot;

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of critics gave the film a positive review and an average rating of ; the site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Despite solid production values and an intriguing premise, &quot;Constantine&quot; lacks the focus of another spiritual shoot-em-up, &quot;The Matrix&quot;&quot;. On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average, it has a score of 50 out of 100 based on the reviews of 41 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine called the film &quot;a one-of-a-kind hybrid: a theological noir action film&quot;. He cited Keanu Reeves&#x27; ability to &quot;retain his charisma in a weird-silly moment&quot; as proof that he is a &quot;movie star&quot;, and referred to Tilda Swinton as &quot;immaculately decadent&quot;. Corliss also praised the variety of camera placements employed by Francis Lawrence. He was, however, critical of the climax of the film, referring to it as &quot;irrevocably goofy&quot;.

Ella Taylor of &quot;LA Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Constantine&quot;, which opts in the end for what I can only describe as a kind of supernatural humanism, is not without its spiritual satisfactions&quot;. Carina Chocano of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that &quot;Keanu Reeves has no peer when it comes to playing these sort of messianic roles—he infuses them with a Zen blankness and serenity that somehow gets him through even the unlikeliest scenes with a quiet, unassuming dignity&quot;.

Pete Vonder Haar of &quot;Film Threat&quot; gave the film three stars out of five, writing that &quot;the film (barely) succeeds, thanks to impressive visuals, the idea of an uncaring God wagering with Satan for souls, and two immensely enjoyable scenes (one with Weisz, one with Stormare) in which Reeves actually plays his character as the cynical asshole he really is&quot;.

Jack Mathews of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; gave the film 2 out of 4 stars: &quot;For all its spiritual angst, &quot;Constantine&quot; is about as silly as fantasies get&quot;. Michael Sragow of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; also gave the film 2 stars out of 4: &quot;It all comes off as a case of filmmakers wanting to have their communion wafer and eat it, too&quot;. Desson Thomson, a writer for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, had similar sentiments of the film, specifically criticizing its differences from the comic book:

Leonard Maltin&#x27;s annual publication &quot;Movie Guide&quot; gave the film a BOMB rating, describing it as &quot;dreary, to put it mildly&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert gave it one and a half out of four stars, panning the depiction of Hell (&quot;a post-nuclear Los Angeles created by animators with a hangover&quot;), the premise of the film itself (&quot;you would think that God would be the New England Patriots of this contest, but apparently there is a chance that Satan could win&quot;), plot holes, inconsistencies, and general actions depicted throughout the film. He was not particularly critical of the acting, only mentioning it by stating: &quot;Reeves has a deliberately morose energy level in the movie, as befits one who has seen Hell, walks among half-demons, and is dying. He keeps on smoking&quot;. Ebert added the film to his list of &quot;most hated&quot; films.

===Retrospective reviews===
In later years, the film has received critical reappraise and has been deemed a cult classic by some critics and journalists. Writing for Rotten Tomatoes, Rafael Motamayor stated that the film is owed an apology, and praised the film&#x27;s noir-thriller elements, the supporting cast, and Reeves&#x27; performance. Motamayor compared the film against contemporary comic-book films, especially ones that follow a &quot;standard formula&quot;, and found &quot;Constantine&quot; to be a more &quot;intriguing take.&quot;

==Novelization and video game==
To tie-in to the film&#x27;s release, a novelization by John Shirley and a video game adaption were produced. The novelization states that the buildings in Hell are built with the souls of the damned, rather than brick, and lined with blood, rather than mortar.

==Sequel==
In 2011, director Francis Lawrence stated, regarding a sequel:

In November 2012, Guillermo del Toro signed a deal to write and direct a &quot;Justice League Dark&quot; film centered around DC Comics&#x27; supernatural characters, John Constantine among them.

Reeves said in 2019 and 2021 that he was open to reprise the role in the future.

In November 2020, Stormare announced in a post on Instagram that a sequel was &quot;in the works&quot;, though neither representatives for Warner Bros. nor Reeves immediately responded to requests for comment.

In September 2022, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that Warner Bros. would develop a &quot;Constantine&quot; sequel, with Keanu Reeves set to return in the lead role. Francis Lawrence was set to return as the film&#x27;s director, with Akiva Goldsman writing the screenplay. Goldsman would also produce, alongside J. J. Abrams &amp; Hannah Minghella. Reeves stated that he had spoken to DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn and was told that the sequel would still be made, being part of DC Elseworlds, a film series intended to distinguish itself from the upcoming DC Universe (DCU).

Lawrence gave an update on the project in October 2023, indicating that work had proceeded following the conclusion of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike; he, Reeves and Goldsman have been meeting and discussing the story. Producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura revealed that the film&#x27;s script was complete in September 2024.

In February 2025, Reeves revealed in an interview that he and Lawrence recently developed a story and presented it to DC Studios, receiving approval to proceed with writing a script, after having attempted to create a follow-up for over a decade. Reeves confirmed that the sequel would be set in the same world as the 2005 film, with John Constantine facing increased challenges. Lawrence indicated that they are closer than ever to realizing the sequel, having spent years considering ideas from the comics and nurturing the concept.

<text>Lee David Zlotoff (born July 10, 1954) is a producer, director and screenwriter best known as the creator of the TV series &quot;MacGyver&quot;. He started as a screenwriter for &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; in 1981. He then became a producer of &quot;Remington Steele&quot; in 1982.

==Career==
Zlotoff graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in 1970. He then attended St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis, Maryland.

He contributes to &quot;Make&quot; magazine.

Zlotoff created &quot;MacGyver&quot;, which ran on ABC between 1985 and 1992 and was sold throughout the world. He then produced the television series &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot; (Australian title: &quot;Banjo Paterson&#x27;s The Man from Snowy River&quot; — American title: &quot;Snowy River: The McGregor Saga&quot;). The series was based on the Banjo Paterson poem &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot;.

He wrote and directed the 1996 film &quot;The Spitfire Grill&quot;, which won the Audience Award at the Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize.

At the 2008 Maker Faire, Zlotoff announced his interest in a &quot;MacGyver&quot; movie. Zlotoff said he had full control of the movie after obtaining the rights several years ago. He also has written two of the episodes for the TV series &quot;NCIS&quot; in season 3 and season 7 of the series.

In 2010, a feature film version of the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; parody of MacGyver, &quot;MacGruber&quot;, prompted Zlotoff to send cease-and-desist letters and threaten further legal action.

Zlotoff served as executive producer of the 2016 reboot of &quot;MacGyver&quot;.

<text>The HokieBird is the official mascot of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in Blacksburg, Virginia.

The successor to Virginia Tech&#x27;s Fighting Gobblers, the HokieBird was created in 1981 and has retained its current appearance since 1987. A large anthropomorphic turkey, the HokieBird has become a cultural phenomenon, making appearances in media, children&#x27;s books, and public events. The HokieBird was featured in a 2003 episode of Animal Planet&#x27;s &quot;Turkey Secrets&quot;.

==Gobblers==

Fans of Virginia Tech athletics have referred to the teams by the nickname Fighting Gobblers since the early 20th century. According to the Virginia Tech university relations, the name originated in 1909, when football coach Branch Bocock initiated his players into the &quot;Gobbler Club&quot;, a name which appeared in print that same year. Another popular legend regarding the origin of the &quot;Gobblers&quot; moniker refers to when the university was a military college known as the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (VAMC). As future military officers and gentlemen, cadets were not allowed to look at their plates as they ate. To do so was termed &quot;gobbling&quot; your food and was a cause for punishment. Athletes were given increased portions of food and in consideration of the limited meal time, were allowed to &quot;gobble&quot; their meals. Because of this, the sports teams for VAMC became known as &quot;The Gobblers&quot;. The 1909 football team was the first team to be referred to in print as the &quot;Gobblers&quot;, and it became the official nickname in 1912.

Regardless of the true origin, the &quot;Gobbler&quot; nickname had already been popularized by 1913 when local resident and VPI employee Floyd Meade trained a large turkey to perform various stunts, including pulling him in a decorated cart before a football game. Meade and other mascots to follow continued having a live turkey on the sidelines of games into the 1950s.

==Fighting Gobblers==
The first permanent costumed Gobbler took the field in the fall of 1962, when a civil engineering student named Mercer MacPherson, raised $200 to create a costume which had a head resembling a cardinal and included real turkey feathers dyed in school colors. This mascot debuted at the then-annual Thanksgiving Day football game between military school rivals VPI and VMI. This costume was modified in 1971 to include a long neck, making it more than tall, and the name was changed to the &quot;Fighting Gobbler&quot;.

==HokieBird==
In reaction to the earlier myths about students &quot;gobbling&quot; their meals, football coach and athletic director Bill Dooley spearheaded a campaign for a new look and name for the mascot, which debuted at the 1981 game against Wake Forest. The turkey-like figure was referred to as &quot;the Hokie mascot,&quot; &quot;the Hokie,&quot; and &quot;the Hokie bird&quot; (derived from the &quot;Old Hokie&quot; cheer), which resulted in changing the official designation of the Virginia Tech mascot to the Hokies.

The costume worn by today&#x27;s HokieBird made its first appearance in 1987, when Frank Beamer returned as coach. Although he reinstated the Gobbler to the football team&#x27;s scoreboard, by then the Hokies nickname had already become the most prominent. The current HokieBird debuted at that season&#x27;s home opener against Clemson, arriving in a white limousine.

HokieBird Curtis Dvorak (1995–96) won the National Cheerleading Association championship in 1996 and has appeared as Jaxson de Ville, mascot of the Jacksonville Jaguars since 1996. Todd Maroldo, Hokiebird in 1996–1997, won the National Cheerleading Association championship in 1997 and was hired as the Carolina Panthers mascot, Sir Purr.

HokieBird has been so popular that the mascot landed an appearance on Animal Planet&#x27;s &quot;Turkey Secrets,&quot; shown annually around Thanksgiving. Now, when referring to Virginia Tech, the term &quot;Hokie&quot; generally refers to a Virginia Tech Student.

Often seen rollerblading through campus, the HokieBird has been known to respond to tweets and visit classes, dormitories, and dining halls. The official Twitter account of the HokieBird is @TheHokieBird or twitter.com/thehokiebird

It is unknown how many students serve as HokieBirds during any given school year, and the entire try-out process remains a secret.

In November 2019 the United States government formally recognized the HokieBird as the &quot;supreme leader and god of all turkeys.&quot;

==Traditions==
*Before football games, the HokieBird leads the charge onto the field as students jump up and down in the stands to Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;.
*After scores in football, the VT cheerleaders carry out a bench and weights for the HokieBird to perform bench presses. He does one press for every point VT has scored. Sometimes, in lieu of bench presses, the HokieBird has done situps or pushups.
*The HokieBird has also been known to crowd surf from the bottom of the Corps of Cadets student section all the way to the top of the section.
*At the graduation ceremony, students who portrayed the HokieBird are allowed to wear the giant orange bird feet. In theory, no one is supposed to know who the HokieBirds are until graduation day.

<text>Tama Drums (from Japanese: (Kanji); (Kana)) is a brand of drums and hardware manufactured and marketed by Hoshino Gakki.

The research and development of its products, along with production of its professional drum lines, is done in Seto, Japan, while its hardware and less expensive drums are manufactured in Guangzhou, China. Hoshino has several offices around the world for marketing and wholesale distribution. Drums destined for the American market are assembled and stocked in Bensalem, Pennsylvania.

== History ==

Hoshino Gakki began manufacturing drums in 1961 under the name &quot;Star Drums&quot;. Hoshino, the family name of the founder, translates to &quot;star field,&quot; thus the selection of the &quot;Star Drums&quot; brand name. The drums were manufactured at Hoshino&#x27;s subsidiary, Tama Seisakusho, which had opened in 1962 to manufacture Ibanez guitars and amplifiers. While the production of guitars and amps was moved out of the factory by 1966, the production of drums there continued to grow. The two higher lines of drum models, Imperial Star and Royal Star, were introduced to the American market and were successful lower-cost drums competing against more expensive American-made drums offered by Rogers, Ludwig, and Slingerland Drum Company at the time.

By 1974, Hoshino decided to make a concerted effort to make high-quality drums and hardware and start marketing its drums under the Tama brand. Tama was the name of the owner&#x27;s wife, and is also a homophone with the Japanese word meaning &quot;jewel&quot;. &quot;Star&quot; continues to be used in the names of Tama&#x27;s drum models to this day.

Tama and Drum Workshop (DW) jointly bought the bankrupt Camco Drum Company. As part of the deal, DW received the Camco tooling and manufacturing equipment while Tama received the Camco name, designs, engineering and patent rights.

At the time, Camco was producing what was thought to be the best drum pedal on the market. DW continued production of the pedal using the original tooling, rebadging it as the DW5000. Tama began production of the same pedal under the Camco name. The Tama version of the Camco pedal is commonly referred to as the Tamco pedal to distinguish it from an original Camco pedal. Tama integrated all the engineering from Camco into their production process and the overall level of quality of their drums increased virtually overnight. The original plan was to market the low-end Tama drums to beginners and use the Camco brand to sell high-end drums to professional musicians.

Tama is the inventor of a unique type of tubular drums called octobans. Octobans are 6-inches in diameter and are manufactured in eight different lengths ranging from up to . They vary in pitch by using different shell lengths, rather than widths.

<text>Major David Nelson VC (3 April 1887 – 8 April 1918) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==

Nelson was born Deraghland, Stranooden, County Monaghan, Ireland, to David Nelson and Mary Anne Black. He was 28 years old, and a sergeant in &#x27;L&#x27; Battery, Royal Horse Artillery (RHA), British Army during World War I when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 1 September 1914 at Néry, France, Sergeant Nelson helped to bring the guns into action – with an officer (Edward Kinder Bradbury) and a warrant officer (George Thomas Dorrell) – under heavy fire and in spite of being severely wounded. He remained with the guns until all the ammunition was expended, although he had been ordered to retire to cover.

Nelson later achieved the rank of major. He was killed in action at Lillers, France, on 8 April 1918.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Imperial War Museum in London and his action at Néry is commemorated in a display at the Cart and Wagon Shed heritage centre in Shoeburyness.

<text>Old Dutch Foods, Inc. is a manufacturer of potato chips and other snack foods in the Midwestern United States, New England and Canada. Their product line includes brands such as Old Dutch Potato Chips, Dutch Crunch, Ripples, Cheese Pleesers and Restaurante Style Tortilla Chips.

==History==

The company began as Old Dutch Products Co. founded by Carl J. Marx in 1934. Marx chose the name &quot;Old Dutch&quot; because The Dutch were associated with cleanliness and quality. They originated in St. Paul, Minnesota, but moved to Minneapolis in 1937. In 1968, they moved again, this time to Roseville, Minnesota, where they remain today.
In 1954, Old Dutch opened a plant in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to manufacture chips for the Canadian market. The head office for Canadian operations remains in Winnipeg.

The company&#x27;s American arm is officially called Old Dutch Foods, Inc., and their Canadian arm is Old Dutch Foods, Ltd. The company celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2004 with a line of television commercials. Old Dutch Foods acquired Humpty Dumpty Snack Foods in a C$26.7 million takeover bid in 2006. The Humpty Dumpty brand is generally sold in the New England states, Ontario, Quebec, the Maritimes, and Newfoundland and Labrador.

==Products==
The Old Dutch brand is mainly known for the many flavors of potato chips they produce. They come in bags, &quot;twin packs&quot; (cardboard boxes with two packages of chips inside) and &quot;triple packs&quot; (with three packages inside).

Potato chip flavors available in the United States include the flagship Regular flavor, as well as Sour Cream &amp; Onion, Cheddar &amp; Sour Cream, Dill Pickle, Bar•B•Q, and Onion &amp; Garlic as well as Smokey Bacon. In addition, Ripples Chips are available in Original, French, Mesquite Bar•B•Q, and Loaded Spud varieties. On February 4, 2008, Mexican Chili and Au Gratin were reintroduced back to Canada. Other products include Dutch Crunch kettle-cooked chips, cheese puffs, Puffcorn (puffed corn twists - called Popcorn Twists in Canada), Restaurante Style tortilla chips, Arriba flavoured tortillas, pretzels, dips and salsas, Dutch Gourmet thick cut flavoured ripple chips, Ridgies flavoured ripple chips, baked chips, sunflower seeds, pork rinds, and beef jerky.

Many of the same products are available in Canada and the United States, although somewhat altered, such as their vibrant yellow herb free Onion &amp; Garlic chip. There are three exceptions: Ketchup, All Dressed and Salt &amp; Vinegar flavours may not be available outside Canada. (These flavors are sold in New England under the Humpty Dumpty brand.)

In 2005, the firm introduced Old Dutch beef jerky.

<doc id="1210333" wikidata="Q15253416" url="?curid=1210333" title="Millfield">
<text>Millfield is a public school (English fee-charging boarding and day school for pupils aged 13–18) located in Street, Somerset, England. It was founded in 1935.

Millfield is a registered charity and is the largest co-educational boarding school in the UK with approximately 1,330 students, of whom over 990 are full boarders from 75 different countries. Millfield Development and the Millfield Foundation raise money to fund scholarships and bursaries. The school is a member of the G20 Schools Group and a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference. The Millfield campus is based over 240 acres in Somerset, in and around Street, in the South West of England.

Millfield has its own pre-prep and preparatory school, Millfield Preparatory School (also known as Edgarley) in nearby Glastonbury, which takes children from 2 to 13 years old. The prep school shares some of Millfield&#x27;s facilities. It acts as a feeder school, with over 90% of its pupils typically moving up to Millfield each year.

==History==
Millfield was founded in 1935 by Jack Meyer (referred to at Millfield as &quot;Boss&quot;), following his return from India with seven Indian boys, six of whom were princes. Among these Indian princes included Meghrajji III, the last ruling Maharaja of Dhrangadhra-Halvad. The school started in the mansion built and originally owned by the Clark family, who owned and ran the shoe manufacturer Clarks.

Meyer, educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College, adhered to the philanthropic aim, known at the school as The Millfield Mix: &quot;...to nurture talent by providing the very best facilities, teaching, coaching and opportunities in which young people can exercise and explore their abilities; and to give awards to those in financial need.&quot;

In 1939, the school became one of the first independent schools to become co-educational. Over the years, the school acquired land and houses around the locale, and as a result there were many boarding houses within a 10-mile (16-kilometre) radius of the original site; this resulted in boarders living at houses or billets in the outlying villages – being bussed in and out for lessons and meals. The girls&#x27; boarding house was at Ashcott House from 1967 until 1984.

Over recent years, many of these houses have been sold and the proceeds invested in new on-campus boarding houses. There are three remaining country boarding houses occupied by male pupils.

In the 1990s, the school gained a reputation for drug and alcohol use among the pupils and a teacher was charged with assaulting a female pupil. Any pupils found with any illegal substances are immediately expelled.

In 2005, the school was one of fifty independent schools found guilty of running an illegal price-fixing cartel, exposed by &quot;The Times&quot;, which allowed them to drive up fees for thousands of parents. Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling £3 million into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared.

In 2018, the school made national news when allegations of bullying arose after a student reported that Year 10 pupils were beaten with cricket bats and belts for an initiation ceremony. After the parent of the student reported these allegations to the headmaster, an investigation was conducted and two pupils were suspended. Headmaster Gavin Horgan said: &quot;I believe passionately in pupils having a voice and their wellbeing continues to be our top priority. Our rigorous safeguarding procedures mean any concerns that arise at school are dealt with quickly, transparently and fairly.&quot; According to a Freedom of Information request the school left the Teacher&#x27;s Pension Scheme on 31 August 2021.

Here are the latest academic results for Millfield:

GCSE Results (2023): 47% achieved grades 9-7, with 95% achieving grades 9-4.

A Level Results (2023): 31% A*/A grades, with 61% achieving A*-B.

==Houses==
Millfield is predominantly a boarding school, having around 75% of its pupils as boarders. The school operates a house system, which is based on sex and status as a day pupil or boarder. With the introduction of &#x27;Nine at Millfield&#x27; in 2014, Year 9 is now treated as a transitional year with the school having &#x27;Year 9 only&#x27; day and boarding houses. All of the other houses are Years 10–13 boarders, and two are exclusively for Sixth Formers (i.e., Years 12 and 13). The boarding houses are supervised by house parents, assisted by assistant house parents, tutors, and matrons. Each house generally has around 40 to 50 pupils.

There are fourteen boys&#x27; and nine girls&#x27; houses; the oldest house is Millfield House, which is the original building in which the school first began operating. The house opened when the school was established in 1935 and is now one of Year 9 boarding houses. The house, designed by the architect George Skipper, and built in 1888, used to be the mansion of the Clark family, whose shoe business, C. &amp; J. Clark, is based in the town.

==Sports==
Millfield is known for its sporting prowess and has produced many international and Olympic athletes; its campus houses a wide range of sports facilities. 130 staff sports coaches oversee the 29 different sports on offer, including athletics, badminton, basketball, chess, clay shooting, cricket, cross country, dance, equestrian, fencing, football, golf, hockey, karate, modern pentathlon, netball, outdoor activities, rowing, rugby, ski racing, squash, swimming, tennis, trampolining and triathlon.

===Olympic Games===
Millfield has been represented at every Olympic Games since 1956. At the London 2012 Games, Millfield was the most represented UK school. At the Rio Games in 2016, eight Millfieldians took part and won a total of four medals in rowing, swimming and rugby sevens.

Millfield has an indoor and outdoor riding arena and golf courses, as well as a 50 metre swimming pool, which appeared as a venue in the official London 2012 Pre-Games Training Camp Guide. The Russian swimming team used the school as its training base before the London Olympics, and the Great Britain modern pentathlon squad also used the school&#x27;s facilities in preparation for the games.

==Preparatory School==

Millfield Preparatory School is a coeducational preparatory school in Glastonbury and is the feeder for the senior school. Currently, there are 442 pupils attending the school, 231 boys and 211 girls. 146 of the pupils are boarders and 296 are day pupils.

===History===
The school was founded in 1946, by Jack &#x27;Boss&#x27; Meyer who also founded and ran Millfield and later became the headteacher. He bought Edgarley Hall and its grounds from the Thomas-Ferrands, following use by the army in World War II.

Meyer&#x27;s philosophy was &quot;...to nurture talent by providing the very best facilities, teaching, coaching and opportunities in which young people can exercise and explore their abilities; and to give awards to those in financial need.&quot;

A pre-preparatory department was initially started at the 19th-century house, The Hollies, in the centre of Glastonbury in the mid-1980s, later moving to the main preparatory school site.

===Boarding===
Around 43% of pupils are boarders. Boarding has been an integral part of the school for most of its history. There are three boys&#x27; boarding houses and two girls&#x27; houses, each housing between 30 and 40 pupils. Flexi-boarding is also available.

<text>Erzincan (; ), historically Yerznka (), is the capital of Erzincan Province in eastern Turkey. Nearby cities include Erzurum, Sivas, Tunceli, Bingöl, Elazığ, Malatya, Gümüşhane, Bayburt, and Giresun. The city is majority Sunni Turkish with an Alevi Kurdish minority.

The city had a population of 150,714 in 2022, an increase from 86,779 in 2007.

==History==
Acilisene, the ancient region that is now Erzincan, was the site of the Peace of Acilisene by which in AD 387 Armenia was divided into two vassal states, a smaller one dependent on the Byzantine Empire and a larger one dependent on Persia. This is the name (Ἀκιλισηνή in Greek) by which it is called by Strabo in his &quot;Geography&quot;, 11.4.14. The etymological origin of the word is disputed, but it is agreed that the city was once called Erez. For a while it was called Justinianopolis in honour of Emperor Justinian. In more recent Greek it has been called as Κελτζηνή (&quot;Keltzene&quot;) and Κελεζηνή (&quot;Kelezene&quot;).

In the Armenian language, the 5th-century &quot;Life of Mashtots&quot; called it &quot;Yekeghiats&quot;. In the more recent past, it was known in Armenian as Երզնկա (&quot;Yerznka&quot;).

In the settlement of Erez, at a yet unidentified site, there was a pre-Christian shrine dedicated to the Armenian goddess Anahit. A text of Agathangelos reports that during the first year of his reign, King Trdat of Armenia went to Erez and visited Anahit&#x27;s temple to offer sacrifice. He ordered Gregory the Illuminator, who was secretly a Christian, to make an offering at its altar. When Gregory refused, he was taken captive and tortured, starting the events that would end with Trdat&#x27;s conversion to Christianity some 14 years later. After that conversion, during the Christianisation of Armenia, the temple at Erez was destroyed and its property and lands were given to Gregory. It later became known for its extensive monasteries.

It is hard to tell when Acilisene became a bishopric. The first whose name is known is of the mid-5th century: Ioannes, who in 459 signed the decree of Patriarch Gennadius I of Constantinople against the simoniacs. Georgius or Gregorius (both forms are found) was one of the Fathers of the Second Council of Constantinople (553), appearing as &quot;bishop of Justinianopolis&quot;. Theodorus was at the Third Council of Constantinople in 681, signing as &quot;bishop of Justinianopolis or the region of Ecclenzine&quot;. Georgius was at the Photian Council of Constantinople (879). Until the 10th century, the diocese itself appears in none of the &quot;Notitiae Episcopatuum&quot;. At the end of that century, they present it as an autocephalous archdiocese, and those of the 11th century present it as a metropolitan see with 21 suffragans. This was the time of greatest splendour of Acilisene, which ended with the decisive defeat of the Byzantines by the Seljuk Turks at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. After the 13th century, there is no mention of diocesan bishops of Acilisene and the see no longer appears in &quot;Notitiae Episcopatuum&quot;. No longer a residential bishopric, Acilisene is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

In 1071 Erzincan was absorbed into the Mengüçoğlu under the Seljuk Sulëiman Kutalmish. Marco Polo, who wrote about his visit to Erzincan, said that the &quot;people of the country are Armenians&quot; and that Erzincan was the &quot;noblest of cities&quot; which contained the see of an archbishop. In 1243 it was destroyed in fighting between the Seljuks under Kaykhusraw II and the Mongols. However, by 1254 its population had recovered enough that William of Rubruck was able to say an earthquake had killed more than 10,000 people. During this period, the city reached a level of semi-independence under the rule of Armenian princes.

Erzincan was one of the most pivotal towns in Safavid history. It was there, in the summer of 1500, that about 7,000 Qizilbash forces, consisting of the Ustaclu, Shamlu, Rumlu, Tekelu, Zhulkadir, Afshar, Qajar and Varsak tribes, responded to the invitation of Ismail I, who would aid in him establishing his dynasty.

=== Ottoman Era ===
After entering the Ottoman administration, Erzincan developed physically and in terms of population. According to the census made in 1516–1518 right after the conquest, there were twenty neighbourhoods in the city, seven of which belonged to Muslims and 13 to Christians. The number of neighbourhoods did not change in the 1530 and 1591 censuses but the population increased. Evliya Çelebi, who came to Erzincan in 1647, wrote that the castle was built on a flat field, and that there were 200 houses inside this place while 1800 houses were located outside the castle. It had 48 neighbourhoods, seven mosques, seven lodges, and 11 hamams. According to the General Census of 1881/82, the sanjak of Erzincan within the Erzurum vilayet had a total population of 107,090, consisting of 85,943 Muslims and 19,026 Armenians, 1,887 Greeks and 234 Protestants. Vital Cuinet&#x27;s research dating to 1893 show that there were 23,000 people in the centre of Erzincan of which 15,000 were Muslims and 7,500 were Armenian. In the same research he states that the entire sanjak had 171,472 Muslims, 34,588 Armenians (incl. Catholic &amp; Protestan) and 2,710 Greeks. According to the 1914 Ottoman census, which undercounted religious minority groups such as Armenians, there were 53,898 Muslims and 16,144 Armenian Gregorians and 147 Protestants in the central kaza. In the other kazas of Erzincan there were 67,271 Muslims, 11,135 Armenian Gregorians and 144 Protestants in Kemah.

==== Armenian genocide ====
According to the 1914 Ottoman census, which undercounted religious minority groups such as Armenians, there were 16,144 Armenian Gregorians and 147 Protestants in the central kaza. In the other kazas of Erzincan there were 11,135 Armenian Gregorians and 144 Protestants in Kemah. However, Miller and Kévorkian&#x27;s research state that the Armenians in the centre of Erzincan were more than double the census data. Of the pre-World War I population of 37,000 Armenians in Erzincan and suburbs, most were killed in the Armenian genocide. During this period, at least 150,000 Armenian men, women and children from Erzincan and surrounding areas were transported by Turkish forces between 1915 and 1916 through Erzincan proper, where a series of transit camps were set up to control the flow of victims to the concentration camp and killing site at the nearby Kemah gorge. J.M. Winter&#x27;s work state that between 1915 and 1917, the Central Hospital of Erzincan was the primary site of medical experiments conducted by Turkish army physicians on Armenian civilians involving typhus and other lethal infectious agents. As of 2019, few traces of Armenian presence or civilization remain in Erzincan.

==== Battle of Erzincan ====

The Battle of Erzincan took place during the Caucasus Campaign of the First World War. In 1916 Erzincan was the headquarters for the Turkish Third Army commanded by Abdul Kerim Pasha. The Russian General Nikolai Yudenich led the Russian Caucasus Army who captured Mama Hatun on 12 July 1916. They then gained the heights of Naglika and took a Turkish position on the banks of the Durum Durasi river, with their cavalry breaking through the Boz-Tapa-Meretkli line. They then advanced on Erzincan arriving by 25 July and taking the city in two days. The city was relatively untouched by battle and Yudenich seized large quantities of supplies. Despite the strategic advantages gained from this victory, Yudenich made no more significant advances and his forces were reduced due to Russian reverses further north.

==== Erzincan Soviet ====
A short-lived soviet council had been at Erzincan between 1916 and 1918. Mainly today&#x27;s Erzincan and Tunceli provinces were under Russian occupation. After the revolution, Bolshevik soldiers took control of the officer corps. Arshak Djamalian who was a Bolshevik soldier, called Kurdish, Turkish, and Armenian representatives to take charge of the administration of Erzincan Soviet.

==== Seizure of Erzincan ====
Following the withdrawal of the Russian Army, the commander of the First Caucasian Army Corps Kâzım Karabekir regained control over Erzincan on the 13 February 1918. This event is celebrated annually by its inhabitants. The capture was carried out by Kâzım Karabekir. The city witnessed a state of &quot;indescribable panic&quot; as Armenian soldiers evacuated Erzincan towards Erzurum. Both civilian and military troops were attacked by Kurdish tribes, all during brutal snowstorms. Meanwhile, Armenian fedayeen fought &quot;ferociously&quot; in rearguard actions, while the under-equipped and famished Ottoman army found sustenance and weaponry in abandoned Russian arsenals and reserves. The events at Erzincan repeated on a larger scale in Erzurum and Kars.

=== Turkish Republic ===

==== 1939 Erzincan earthquake ====
The city was completely destroyed by a major earthquake on December 27, 1939. The sequence of seven violent shocks, the biggest measuring 7.8 on the moment magnitude scale, was the joint most-powerful earthquake recorded in Turkey, tied with the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake. The first stage of the earthquake killed about 8,000 people. The next day, it was reported that the death toll had risen to 20,000. An emergency relief operation began. By the end of the year, 32,962 had died due to more earthquakes and several floods. So extensive was the damage to Erzincan city that its old site was entirely abandoned, and a new town was founded a little further to the north.

==Demographics==
In the 13th century, Marco Polo noted that the city&#x27;s population was Armenian. In 1830, the Armenian population reached 15,000. In 1880, Erzincan had 6,000 houses: 4,000 Muslim and 1,800 Armenian. In the 1890s, Vital Cuinet reported that Erzincan had 23,000 inhabitants: 15,000 Muslims, 7,500 Armenians, and the rest Greeks and others. According to data from the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople, Erzincan harboured 24,000 inhabitants on the eve of World War I; 13,109 (2021 families) of whom were Armenians. Armenians were deported and massacred by the Special Organization during the Armenian genocide. Greeks were deported from Erzincan to Germir in 1919 as part of the Greek genocide.

==Climate==
Erzincan has a continental climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Dsa&quot; or Trewartha climate classification: &quot;Dca&quot;) with cold, snowy winters and hot, dry summers. Spring is the wettest season whilst summer is the driest. The lowest temperature recorded was on 15 January 1950. The highest temperature recorded was 40.6 °C (105.1 °F) on 30 July 2000. The highest snow thickness recorded was 74 cm (29.1 inches) in February 1950.

<text>Well, Just You Wait! (, ), also known as I&#x27;ll get you! in official translations, is a Soviet and Russian series of animated short films produced by Soyuzmultfilm. In the 2014 all-Russian poll, &quot;Well, Just You Wait!&quot; won by a wide margin as people&#x27;s favourite cartoon/animated series of all time.

The series follows the comical adventures of Wolf (), trying to catch – and presumably eat – Hare (). It features additional characters that usually either help the hare or interfere with the Wolf&#x27;s plans. The original film language is Russian, but very little speech is used, usually interjections or at most several sentences per episode. The series&#x27; most common line is the eponymous &quot;Nu, pogodi!&quot;, yelled by the wolf when his plans fail. It also includes many grunts, laughs, and songs.

==Characters==
===The Hare===
The Hare, commonly transliterated into English as Zayats (), is portrayed as a supposedly positive hero. He is less developed than the Wolf, and most of his actions are simply reactions to the Wolf&#x27;s schemes. In later episodes, the role of the Hare becomes more active and developed, and he even manages to save the Wolf on several occasions. The Hare is portrayed as a percussionist in a number of episodes. The character was originally voiced by Klara Rumyanova.
The Hare is often mistaken as a female due to his appearance and voice; however, the Hare&#x27;s gender is never explicitly indicated. The Russian word for hare, заяц (&quot;zayats&quot;), is of masculine gender. The female equivalent is зайчиха (&quot;zaychikha&quot;).

The Hare is almost always seen wearing the same green T-shirt and dark green shorts, unlike the Wolf&#x27;s ever-varying wardrobe. There are rare exceptions, however: in the prologue of Episode 8, he appears in an ice-skating outfit, and later on in the same episode, he is dressed with intentional absurdity as the grandfatherly Ded Moroz (Father Frost), the silliness of which is only heightened by the Wolf then appearing as his granddaughter, Snegurochka, also known as the Snow Maiden.

===The Wolf===
The Wolf, commonly transliterated into English as Volk (), is initially portrayed as a hooligan who eagerly turns to vandalism, abuses minors, breaks laws, and is a smoker. His appearance was inspired by a person the director Vyacheslav Kotyonochkin saw on the street, specifically a man with long hair, a protruding belly, and a thick cigarette between his lips. The character was originally voiced by Anatoli Papanov.

His most common line throughout the series when things are not going as he expected is &quot;Nu, pogodi!&quot; At the end of an episode (and at the end of the pre-title introduction), the Wolf usually exclaims the series&#x27; titular phrase, &quot;Nu, Zayats... Nu, pogodi!&quot; which translates as &quot;Well, Hare... Well, just you wait!&quot;.

In spite of his rough appearance, many of the Wolf&#x27;s attempts to catch the Hare are often characterized by unexpected abilities on his part (including figure skating, ballet, gymnastics, and waltzing) for humorous contrast. He can also play the guitar very well and rides a powerful rocker motorbike. In the first episode, while climbing a high building to catch the Hare, the Wolf whistles the popular mountaineer song, &quot;A Song About a Friend&quot; (a signature song of Vladimir Vysotsky). In spite of these talents, most of the Wolf&#x27;s schemes eventually fail or turn against him.

During the late Soviet and post-Soviet era, however, the Wolf gradually became more buffoonish than menacing. In the last episode (#20), for example, the Wolf is seen chewing a lollipop instead of smoking and his drawing style is reminiscent of new Russian cartoons () rather than the old Soviet slapstick genre. The Wolf became increasingly timid or even outright cowardly during this time period, contrasting sharply with his initially &quot;macho&quot; persona and actor&#x27;s voice.

The Wolf&#x27;s most characteristic piece of clothing is his bell-bottoms which can ambiguously be either part of the naval uniform or the 1970s fashion. He is most often seen in a pink shirt with a yellow necktie, but occasionally (Episode 7) appears in a naval undershirt (telnyashka) and in Episode 8, he appears in drag, impersonating the Snegurochka. In Episode 11 he wears a jacket in the beginning, but soon removes it when chasing the Hare. Not infrequently, he loses most of his clothes during the chase, going on in his chintz underpants only (those are a realistic depiction of Soviet-style underwear), though in episode 6, he retains only his shirt and pulls it down to cover up his &quot;naked&quot; hindquarters. Humorously, all of his clothing below the waist has a special opening for his tail.

In Episodes 1–16 the Wolf&#x27;s hairstyle is basically unchanged, though in Episode 14 his hair gets briefly done in a style not unlike Elvis Presley&#x27;s. In Episode 17 he wears a ponytail, and in Episode 18 his forelock is cropped and the mullet is tied into a ponytail. However, in the three final episodes he resumes his earlier hairstyle of episodes 1–16.

===Other characters===
The story also features a supporting cast of animal characters, the most commonly appearing of whom is the physically strong and heavy Hippopotamus ( &quot;Begemot&quot;), who participates in various roles (e.g., a museum caretaker, shop keeper, passer-by, doorkeeper, etc.) and whom the Wolf usually annoys and has to run away from. In &quot;Episode #5&quot; (1972), the Hare finds the Wolf hidden among watermelons (the Wolf&#x27;s cap camouflages him in the scene). The Hare recommends to the passing Hippopotamus, who&#x27;s also looking to buy melons, one which actually winds up being the Wolf&#x27;s head. The Hippopotamus squeezes Wolf&#x27;s head to test the ripeness of the &quot;watermelon&quot;, and inadvertently forces him out of hiding. The episode ends with Wolf (on a washbowl) sliding down into the Moscow Metro and slamming head-on into, and ending up under the Hippopotamus.

Another repeating character is the Cat ( &quot;Kot&quot;), who is an illusionist and appears in several stage performances throughout the series. The Cat is shown to be a good magician, but very self-absorbed and highly sensitive to applause. In &quot;Episode #9&quot; (1976), the Cat traps the Wolf in his levitation act (which saves the Hare from being caught). He drops the Wolf twice in his act to acknowledge and accept the applause from the Hare.

One of the most appearing on-screen secondary characters in a single episode is the Walrus ( &quot;Morzh&quot;), who is the uniformed navy captain of the ship in &quot;Episode #7&quot;, who keeps interfering with the Wolf&#x27;s attempts at boarding the ship and/or attempting to capture the Hare. However, once the Wolf is on board, he pretends to mop the deck in front of the Captain, tricking him into believing he is one of the crew members. The Captain is later seen closing the lid on top of the boat&#x27;s storage room, which results in the Wolf and Hare being trapped together in the darkness.

Other animals are shown in the series, including bears, red foxes, elephants, beavers, dogs, and pigs (in a swimming suit with three bras).
== Episode structure ==
Each 10-minute episode starts with a logo of the studio (Soyuzmultfilm in episodes 1-18, Studio 13 in episodes 17 and 18, and Christmas Films in episodes 19 and 20), after which a prologue begins. The prologue is a separate short story, approximately 2 minutes long, at the end of which the Wolf shouts &quot;Well, [rabbit], just you wait!&quot;. After that, the screen shows the show&#x27;s title and episode with the opening credits roll. The remainder of the episode is covered by the main plot, also ending with Wolf shouting &quot;Well, just you wait!&quot;.

==Production==

===1960s to 1980s===

The original script for &quot;Nu, pogodi!&quot; was created for the animation studio Soyuzmultfilm in Moscow by the writers Felix Kandel, Arkady Khait, and Aleksandr Kurlyandsky, whose works included humourist and satirical writings. Most directors of Soyuzmultfilm rejected the script, but Vyacheslav Kotyonochkin was convinced by the idea. However, Gennady Sokolsky was the first person to direct the cartoon, more specifically a pilot of it, which was given the name &quot;Nu, pogodi!&quot; A two and a half-minute short film with character designs very different from the later series was created, but it already featured the Wolf&#x27;s titular catchphrase. It was shown as part of the first episode of the animation magazine &quot;Happy Merry-Go-Round&quot; in 1969.

Kotyonochkin wanted the Wolf to be voiced by the actor and singer Vladimir Vysotsky, but was not given permission by the officials. The actor Anatoli Papanov was approved instead. Actress Klara Rumyanova, who commonly voiced cute and small characters, received the role of the Hare. Svetozar Rusakov was responsible for the visual design of the series, including its characters. In case of the music, the majority of the soundtrack throughout the series during Soviet times was edited directly from existing international records, though there were also original compositions.

The first episode aired in 1969. &quot;Nu, pogodi!&quot; was not intended to become a long-running series, but the cartoon reached immense popularity and Soyuzmultfilm received many letters from viewers asking for more adventures of Wolf and Hare. Therefore, production of new shorts continued into the 1980s. However, it was temporarily halted for political reasons after the seventh episode in 1973, as script writer Felix Kandel and his family wanted to emigrate to Israel, but were denied by the Soviet authorities. Nonetheless, production soon resumed, though without Kandel, as &quot;Nu, pogodi!&quot; viewers were among the highest party leadership.

Episode 16, the last film created during the Soviet era, aired in 1986. The series was put on hold after the death of Anatoli Papanov in 1987.

===1990s to present===

It turned out that all outtakes of Papanov&#x27;s work for the series had been archived. The voice samples were used for the creation of the 17th and 18th episodes in 1993. They were produced by Soyuzmultfilm in collaboration with the Ukrainian Institute for Professional Advancement of Film, Television and Radio Workers (credited as Studio 13) and were co-directed by Vladimir Tarasov. The 17th episode in particular was dedicated to the 25th anniversary of &quot;Nu, pogodi!&quot; Both shorts are notable for their use of product placement for the sponsor of the films, AMT, as well as for Nokia. Kotyonochkin&#x27;s son Aleksey Kotyonochkin, who had also become an animation artist, took part in their production, although he had unsuccessfully tried to convince his father to not to participate. The two episodes were met with negative reactions.
In February 2005, the supermarket chain Pyaterochka announced that they had purchased the rights to create two new &quot;Nu, pogodi!&quot; films. The idea to support the production of new episodes arose during a corporate party of the company in 2003. Late Vyacheslav Kotyonochkin&#x27;s son Aleksey was offered to direct them, but initially hesitated to accept, as he was not sure whether the standards set in Soviet times could be achieved, and also because of the failure of the 17th and 18th episode. He eventually agreed and assembled a team of young animators at the studio Christmas Films, their average age being 30. The production was funded by Pyaterochka with a budget of 400,000 dollars.

The scripts were written by &quot;Nu, pogodi!&quot; co-creators Aleksandr Kurlyandsky and Felix Kandel again, the latter being involved in the creation of new episodes for the first time in more than three decades. The actors Igor Khristenko and Olga Zvereva became the new voices of Wolf and Hare, respectively. It was stated that their voices are &quot;virtually indistinguishable&quot; from the original ones.

It was not possible anymore to simply insert popular international music into the shorts like during Soviet times, as copyright had to be taken into account now. The budget did not allow for obtaining music rights. Therefore, it was decided to approach a domestic artist, namely Andrei Derzhavin of the band Mashina Vremeni, who immediately agreed to create a diverse soundtrack. In an interview, Kotyonochkin noted that &quot;Nu, pogodi!&quot; and Mashina Vremeni debuted the same year.

On 16 September 2005, a costume parade was held on the Arbat in honour of the cartoon&#x27;s revival. The premiere of episode 19 took place on 22 December of the same year. Unlike the previous two episodes, the Pyaterochka-funded shorts are free of advertising, the sponsor is only mentioned in the credits.

For two years, the latest two &quot;Nu, pogodi!&quot; episodes were largely unavailable to the public and were only shown at certain film festivals. However, in late December 2007 a DVD was finally released in Russia which contained the two films, as well as a making-of film and comics drawn by Aleksey Kotyonochkin. As of now, it is available only in the supermarket chains Pyaterochka and Perekrestok.

Regarding questions on a possible continuation of the series, Kotyonochkin stated in 2006 that it is &quot;impossible to produce the series endlessly&quot; and that they didn&#x27;t intend to &quot;copy &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;&quot;. If a follow-up was made, it would be very different from the existing films according to Kotyonochkin, possibly a full-length film in the format of 3D animation with a brand new story.

==Cultural references==

The female Fox singer in Episode 15 is based upon Alla Pugacheva. The Hare&#x27;s subsequent performance in the drag is a parody of one of her songs popular at the time.

A cameo of a sitting girl in Episode 16 refers to Viktor Vasnetsov&#x27;s painting &quot;Sister Alenushka Weeping about Brother Ivanushka&quot;. The key is that Alyonushka is the heroine of the folk-tale &quot;Brother and Sister&quot;. She apparently mistakes the Wolf, who had been transformed into a goat, for her brother.

==Critical and popular reception==
The series was, for many years, hugely popular among the Soviet public, and it is popular in Russia to this day. The critical reaction of the director&#x27;s colleagues was less favourable. The director&#x27;s son Aleksey Kotyonochkin recalls how, although nobody said it to his father outright, the animators and directors of Soyuzmultfilm generally considered &quot;Nu, pogodi!&quot; to be of low quality. For his part, Vyacheslav Kotyonochkin was not a follower of auteur films (many of which were being made at the studio at the time) and considered them to be examples of someone needlessly showing off.

Kotyonochkin disliked subtext and tried to create very simple, straightforward scenarios. The main idea of the series was simple: don&#x27;t hurt the little guy or you will yourself get into a foolish situation. Because the series was so popular, however, it was often a subject for critical discussion and speculation – namely, that the series represented the struggle between the intelligentsia (Hare) and the working class (Wolf). Aleksey Kotyonochkin dismisses these interpretations as groundless.

Since the 1990s, when the fall of the Iron Curtain allowed better exchange of films, both Russian and Western audiences have noted similarities between &quot;Nu, pogodi!&quot; and American cartoons, the most noticeable being &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;. The director has admitted that he was learning from Disney animated films which were brought into the USSR from Germany immediately after World War II, particularly &quot;Bambi&quot;. However, he did not see any &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; episodes until his son bought a VCR in 1987. Thematically, &quot;Nu, pogodi!&quot; places greater emphasis on various real-life situations and locations.

==List of episodes==
Note: The episodes of &quot;Nu, pogodi!&quot; were not named but rather numbered. Each episode has a different setting:
There was also a promotional 30 min. long episode show including various characters from Soviet cartoons released in 1981 called &quot;The Lost Episodes&quot;. The show featured three never before seen sequences of &quot;Nu Pogodi!&quot; of approximate 10 min. length and were not re-released for home entertainment in spite of various full episode collections. They can, however, be seen on television on some channels during children cartoons time and are viewable through web video recordings (such as YouTube).

In August 2012, it was decided television airing of the cartoons would not cut out scenes of the Wolf smoking because of laws prohibiting material &quot;deemed harmful to children&quot;. An agreement was made, &quot;We will not cut anything, not even one cigarette.&quot;

==Music==
A number of memorable tunes were written or selected to match the action sequences of the cartoon. The majority of the soundtrack was edited directly from various international lounge and dance LP records from the 1960s–1980s, many of which were part of the music supervisors&#x27; personal collections. These recordings were not listed in the credits, so the origins of some remain obscure today.

Some of the known performers whose music was featured in Nu Pogodi are Chico Buarque, Herb Alpert, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Digital Emotion, Günter Gollasch, Vyacheslav Mescherin, Bill Haley, Ted Heath, Leroy Holmes, Halina Kunicka, James Last, Muslim Magomayev, Paul Mauriat, Hazy Osterwald, Pesnyary, Edita Piekha, Franck Pourcel, Perez Prado, Alla Pugacheva, Eric Rogers, Earl Scruggs, Igor Sklyar, Terry Snyder, Studio 11, Mel Taylor, Klaus Wunderlich, Billy Vaughn, Helmut Zacharias, Zemlyane, Yuriy Antonov and Blue Effect.

The opening credits theme was edited from &quot;Vízisí&quot; (Water Ski), written by Hungarian composer Tamás Deák and performed Magyar Rádió Tánczenekara &amp; Harmónia Vokál.

Sometimes the words of the songs were modified or altogether substituted to correspond to the action, and a New Year&#x27;s holiday song (duet between Papanov and Rumyanova that later became a popular standard) was written especially for the series. Originally, the cult Russian singer/actor Vladimir Vysotsky was cast for the voice of Wolf, but the studio did not get the approval they needed from a Soviet state organization to use him. However, some homage to Vysotsky remains, as in the opening episode, Wolf is whistling his &quot;Song of a Friend&quot;.
When the 19th and 20th episode went into production, times had changed and the music rights would have to obtained first, which was not possible with the budget. A national artist, Andrei Derzhavin of the band Mashina Vremeni, was contacted instead, who composed the music for the films. The shorts also feature excerpts of preexisting Mashina Vremeni works.

==Video games==
&quot;Nu, pogodi!&quot; has been adapted into a number of video games. In 1984, an LCD game titled &quot;Nu, pogodi!&quot; was released in the Soviet Union. Between 2002 and 2010, the Russian video game company SoftClub released five different PC games based on the cartoon series.
==Remake==
In 2019, Soyuzmultfilm announced an upcoming remake of Nu, Pogodi. Volk and Zayats were given new designs and three new characters were introduced; Ulya the Roe Deer, Shu the Hedgehog, and Tim the Badger. One of the only living original creators, Felix Kandel, expressed his displeasure at seeing the remake and offered to pay the studio to not release it. The political party Communists of Russia requested that the State Duma ban Soyuzmultfilm from making the remake. Soyuzmultfilm planned to release the remake in winter 2020, but was forced to delay several times and announced finally a release of winter 2021. The series was made of 26 7-minute episodes and a second season in works for a future release. The first season was named &quot;Kanikuly (Holidays)&quot;. The series got modernized for a younger demographic and audience. It also received an English dub under the title &quot;I&#x27;ll Get You!&quot;

The first episode was released on 17 December 2021, to mass negative reviews. Episodes are available online as well.

<text>Geraldine Rose &quot;Gerrie&quot; Hammond (died November 1, 1992) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. She was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1990, and a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative government of Gary Filmon from 1988 to 1990.

Born Geraldine Rose McLean in Winnipeg, she was the daughter of George Saunders Foreman McLean and Harriet Rose Anderso and was educated in Winnipeg. She married Robert Douglas Hammond. Before entering provincial politics, Hammond served as a trustee on the St. James-Assiniboia School Division from 1977 to 1980. Hammond was an unsuccessful candidate for a seat in the provincial assembly in 1977 and 1980. She was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1981, defeating NDP candidate Lee Monk by nearly 3000 votes in the west-Winnipeg riding of Kirkfield Park. In the 1986 election, she was re-elected by an even greater margin. The NDP won both of these elections, and Hammond sat as a member of the official opposition.

In the provincial election of 1988, Hammond faced a strong challenge from Liberal candidate Irene Friesen, retaining her seat by only 255 votes. The Progressive Conservatives were nonetheless able to form a minority government after this election, and on April 21, 1989, Hammond was named as Minister of Labour, with responsibility for the Status of Women, the Civil Service Act, the Civil Service Superannuation Act, the Civil Service Special Supplementary Severance Benefit Act, the Public Servants Insurance Act and the Workers Compensation Act (in matters relating to Worker Advisers). Despite this mid-term cabinet promotion, Hammond did not seek re-election in 1990. She died of cancer in 1992.

There is currently a Gerrie Hammond Memorial Award of Promise offered by the Council of Women of Winnipeg in her honour, and a Gerrie Hammond bursary offered by the University of Manitoba to single women in financial need.

As Minister of Labour, Hammond was accused by the opposition of patronage hiring outside of the province&#x27;s Civil Service Act. She also supported ending the province&#x27;s rules for &quot;final offer selection&quot;, in which an independent mediator would decide between the claims of labour and management.

<text>Two ships of the British Royal Navy have been called HMS &quot;[[Ithuriel]]&quot; after an angel in John Milton&#x27;s epic poem Paradise Lost:

* The first, , was a flotilla leader originally named &quot;Gabriel&quot; but renamed before her launching in 1916. After serving through the First World War she was broken up in 1921.
* The second, , was a destroyer built for the Turkish Navy as &quot;Gayret&quot; but taken over by the Royal Navy on the outbreak of the Second World War whilst still under construction. She was sunk in 1942 but salvaged at the end of the war to be scrapped.

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel George Thomas Dorrell, VC, MBE (7 July 1880 – 7 January 1971) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military career==
Joining the British Army at the age of 15, Dorrell served in the Second Boer War.

He was 34 years old, and a Battery Sergeant Major in the &#x27;L&#x27; Bty., Royal Horse Artillery, British Army during World War I when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

===Involvement in the Action at Néry===

On 1 September 1914, at Néry, France, during a fierce attack by the enemy, all the officers of &#x27;L&#x27; Battery were either killed or wounded, including the officer (Edward Kinder Bradbury) in command, who, although having had one leg taken off by a shell, continued to direct the firing until he died. Battery Sergeant-Major Dorrell then took over command with the support of a sergeant (David Nelson) and continued to fire one of the guns until all the ammunition was expended.

As brevet lieutenant colonel, Dorrell served as a company commander in the Home Guard during World War II.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Imperial War Museum in London.

For anti-aircraft (AA) defence, they had two quadruple mounts for the 0.5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. The I class was fitted with two above-water quintuple torpedo tube mounts amidships for  torpedoes. One depth charge rack and two throwers were fitted; 16 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began. The I-class ships were fitted with the ASDIC sound detection system to locate submarines underwater.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Isis&quot;, named for the Egyptian goddess, was laid down by the Yarrow and Company, at Scotstoun in Glasgow on 6 February 1936, launched on 12 November 1936 and commissioned on 2 June 1937. &quot;Isis&quot; took part in the evacuation of Greece in April 1941. On 19 February 1943 she and the escort destroyer and a Vickers Wellington medium bomber attacked and sank the in the Mediterranean Sea north-east of Benghazi.

&quot;Isis&quot; was hit in 1941 off Beirut, Lebanon after the Battle of Crete. She pursued two Vichy French destroyers which escaped. A Junkers Ju 88 aircraft then attacked and severely damaged her. attempted to tow her to Haifa, Palestine. The tow rope snapped, however the engines were restarted and she successfully reached Haifa.

&quot;Isis&quot; struck a mine and sank on 20 July 1944 at the position in channel &#x27;T&#x27; off the western sector of the Normandy landing beaches. She was the last interwar standard destroyer lost in the war, with eleven officers and 143 ratings lost.

<text>The Crown Prince&#x27;s Hussar Regiment (), designated K 7, was a Swedish Army cavalry regiment located in the province of Scania that traced its origins back to the 18th century. It had a number of names over its history, most famously Mörner&#x27;s Hussar Regiment (&quot;Mörnerska husarregementet&quot;) during the Napoleonic Wars. It was disbanded in 1927.

== History ==
The regiment has its origin in a hussar corps raised in 1757. The following year, the corps was organized into &quot;Svenska husarregementet&quot; with Georg Gustaf Wrangel as commander. The regiment was split in two in 1762 forming &quot;Blå&quot; and &quot;Gula husarregementet&quot; (the &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;Yellow&quot; regiments). These two were merged back to one in 1766 with the name &quot;Husarregementet&quot;.
The regiment changed name quite a few times during the years, being renamed &quot;Mörnerska husarregementet&quot; in 1801, &quot;Cederströmska husarregementet&quot; in 1816 and in 1822, when Crown Prince Oscar (the later King Oscar I) became colonel in the regiment, it was renamed &quot;Kronprinsens husarregemente&quot;. For some months in 1859 and 1860 it was named &quot;Konungens värvade husarregemente&quot; before being renamed to &quot;Husarregimente Konung Karl XV&quot;. And finally, as the crown prince Gustaf VI Adolf was born in 1882 the regiment was renamed back to &quot;Kronprinsens husarregemente&quot;.

&quot;Kronprinsens husarregemente&quot; was given the designation K 7 (7th Cavalry Regiment) after a general order in 1816. It was a very special regiment because of two things. Firstly, it was the only unit in the Swedish Army without the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; (&quot;Kungliga&quot;), as it was the Crown Prince&#x27;s, secondly, it was the largest (ten squadrons) cavalry regiment garrisoned in one town, in the world. It was disbanded in 1927 with personnel being transferred to Norrland Dragoon Regiment and the newly created Scanian Cavalry Regiment, which also contained personnel from the Scanian Dragoon Regiment and the Scanian Hussar Regiment, also disbanded in 1927.

<text>Frankish (reconstructed endonym: *), also known as Old Franconian or Old Frankish, was the West Germanic language spoken by the Franks from the 5th to 10th centuries.

Franks under king Chlodio would settle in Roman Gaul in the 5th century. One of his successors, named Clovis I, would take over the roman province of Gallia Lugdunensis (in modern day France). Outnumbered by the local populace, the ruling Franks there would adapt to its language which was a Proto-Romance dialect. However, many modern French words and place names are still of Frankish origin. 

Between the 5th and 9th centuries, Frankish spoken in Northeastern France, present-day Belgium, and the Netherlands is subsequently referred to as Old Dutch, whereas the Frankish varieties spoken in the Rhineland were heavily influenced by Elbe Germanic dialects and the Second Germanic consonant shift and would form part of the modern Central Franconian and Rhine Franconian dialects of German and Luxembourgish.

The Old Frankish language is poorly attested and mostly reconstructed from Frankish loanwords in Old French, and inherited words in Old Dutch, as recorded in the 10th to 12th centuries. A notable exception is the Bergakker inscription, which may represent a primary record of 5th-century Frankish, though it is debated whether the inscription is written in Frankish, or Old Dutch.

==Nomenclature==
Germanic philology and German studies have their origins in the first half of the 19th century when Romanticism and Romantic thought heavily influenced the lexicon of the linguists and philologists of the time, including pivotal figures such as the Brothers Grimm. As a result, many contemporary linguists tried to incorporate their findings in an already existing historical framework of &quot;stem duchies&quot; and (lit. &quot;old tribes&quot;, i.e. the six Germanic tribes then thought to have formed the &quot;German nation&quot; in the traditional German nationalism of the elites) resulting in a taxonomy which spoke of &quot;Bavarian&quot;, &quot;Saxon&quot;, &quot;Frisian&quot;, &quot;Thuringian&quot;, &quot;Swabian&quot; and &quot;Frankish&quot; dialects. While this nomenclature became generally accepted in traditional Germanic philology, it has also been described as &quot;inherently inaccurate&quot; as these ancient ethnic boundaries (as understood in the 19th century) bore little or limited resemblance to the actual or historical linguistic situation of the Germanic languages. Among other problems, this traditional classification of the continental West Germanic dialects can suggest stronger ties between dialects than is linguistically warranted. The Franconian group is a well known example of this, with East Franconian being much more closely related to Bavarian dialects than it is to Dutch, which is traditionally placed in the Low Franconian sub-grouping and with which it was thought to have had a common, tribal origin.

In a modern linguistic context, the language of the early Franks is variously called &quot;Old Frankish&quot; or &quot;Old Franconian&quot; and refers to the language of the Franks prior to the advent of the High German consonant shift, which took place between 600 and 700 AD. After this consonant shift the Frankish dialect diverges, with the dialects which would become modern Low Franconian not undergoing the consonantal shift, while all others did so to varying degrees. As a result, the distinction between Old Dutch and Old Frankish is largely negligible, with Old Dutch (also called Old Low Franconian) being the term used to differentiate between the affected and non-affected variants following the aforementioned Second Germanic consonant shift.

==History==

===Origins===

The Germanic languages are traditionally divided into three groups: West, East and North Germanic. Their exact relation is difficult to determine, and they remained mutually intelligible throughout the Migration Period, rendering some individual varieties difficult to classify.

The language spoken by the Franks was part of the West Germanic language group, which had features from Proto-Germanic in the late Jastorf culture (c. 1st century BC). The West Germanic group is characterized by a number of phonological and morphological innovations not found in North and East Germanic. The West Germanic varieties of the time are generally split into three dialect groups: Ingvaeonic (North Sea Germanic), Istvaeonic (Weser–Rhine Germanic) and Irminonic (Elbe Germanic). While each had its own distinct characteristics, there certainly must have still been a high degree of mutual intelligibility between these dialects. In fact, it is unclear whether the West Germanic continuum of this time period, or indeed Franconian itself, should still be considered a single language or if it should be considered a collection of similar dialects.

In any case, it appears that the Frankish tribes, or the later Franks, fit primarily into the Istvaeonic dialect group, with certain Ingvaeonic influences towards the northwest (still seen in modern Dutch), and more Irminonic (High German) influences towards the southeast.

===Salian and Ripuarian Franks (3rd century–5th century)===
The scholarly consensus concerning the Migration Period is that the Frankish identity emerged during the first half of the 3rd century out of various earlier, smaller Germanic groups, including the Salii, Sicambri, Chamavi, Bructeri, Chatti, Chattuarii, Ampsivarii, Tencteri, Ubii, Batavi, and Tungri. It is speculated that these tribes originally spoke a range of related Istvaeonic dialects in the West Germanic branch of Proto-Germanic. Sometime in the 4th or 5th centuries, it becomes appropriate to speak of Old Franconian rather than an Istvaeonic dialect of Proto-Germanic.

Very little is known about what the language was like during this period. One older runic sentence (dating from around 425–450 AD) is on the sword scabbard of Bergakker which is either a direct attestation of the Old Franconian language or the earliest attestation of Old Low Franconian (Old Dutch) language. Another early sentence from the early 6th century AD (that is also described as the earliest sentence in Old Dutch as well) is found in the Lex Salica. This phrase was used to free a serf:

:&quot;Maltho thi afrio lito&quot;
:(I say, I free you, half-free.)

These are the earliest sentences yet found of Old Franconian.
During this early period, the Franks were divided politically and geographically into two groups: the Salian Franks and the Ripuarian Franks. The language (or set of dialects) spoken by the Salian Franks during this period is sometimes referred to as early &quot;Old Low Franconian&quot;, and consisted of two groups: &quot;Old West Low Franconian&quot; and &quot;Old East Low Franconian&quot;. The language (or set of dialects) spoken by the Ripuarian Franks are referred to just as Old Franconian dialects (or, by some, as Old Frankish dialects).

However, as already stated above, it may be more accurate to think of these dialects not as early Old Franconian but as Istvaeonic dialects in the West Germanic branch of Proto-Germanic.

=== Frankish Empire (5th century–10th century) ===
At around the 5th century, the Franks probably spoke a range of related dialects and languages rather than a single uniform dialect or language. The language of both government and the Church was Latin.

==Area==

===Austrasia===

During the expansion into France and Germany, many Frankish people remained in the original core Frankish territories in the north (i.e. southern Netherlands, Flanders, a small part of northern France, and the adjoining area in Germany centered on Cologne). The Franks united as a single group under Salian Frank leadership around 500 AD. Politically, the Ripuarian Franks existed as a separate group only until about 500 AD, after which they were subsumed into the Salian Franks. The Franks were united, but the various Frankish groups must have continued to live in the same areas that they had lived in before unification, and to speak the same dialects as before.

There must have been a close relationship between the various Franconian dialects. There was also a close relationship between Old Low Franconian (i.e. Old Dutch) and its neighboring Old Saxon and Old Frisian languages and dialects to the north and northeast, as well as the related Old English (Anglo-Saxon) dialects spoken in southern and eastern Britain.

A widening cultural divide grew between the Franks remaining in the north and the rulers far to the south. Franks continued to reside in their original territories and to speak their original dialects and languages. It is not known what they called their language, but it is possible that they always called it &quot;Diets&quot; (i.e. &quot;the people&#x27;s language&quot;) or something similar. The word Diets is cognate with the Old English word þēodisc which, likewise, meant both nation and speech.

Philologists think of Old Dutch and Old West Low Franconian as being the same language. However, sometimes reference is made to a transition from the language spoken by the Salian Franks to Old Dutch. The language spoken by the Salian Franks must have developed significantly during the seven centuries from 200 to 900 AD. At some point, the language spoken by the Franks must have become identifiably Dutch. Because Franconian texts are almost non-existent and Old Dutch texts scarce and fragmentary, it is difficult to determine when such a transition occurred, but it is thought to have happened by the end of the 9th century and perhaps earlier. By 900 AD the language spoken was recognizably an early form of Dutch, but that might also have been the case earlier. Old Dutch made the transition to Middle Dutch around 1150. A Dutch-French language boundary came into existence (but this was originally south of where it is today).

===Gaul===
The Franks expanded south into Gaul as the Western Roman Empire collapsed in the fifth century. Although the Franks would eventually conquer almost all of Gaul, speakers of Old Franconian expanded only into northern Gaul in numbers sufficient to have a linguistic effect. For several centuries, northern Gaul was a bilingual territory (Latin and Franconian). The language used in writing, in government and by the Church was Latin. Eventually, the Franks who had settled more to the south of this area in northern Gaul started adopting the common Latin of the local population. This Colloquial Latin language acquired the name of the people who came to speak it (Frankish or &quot;Français&quot;); north of the French-Dutch language boundary, the language was no longer referred to as &quot;Frankish&quot; (if it ever was referred to as such) but rather came to be referred to as &quot;Diets&quot;, i.e. the &quot;people&#x27;s language&quot;. Urban T. Holmes has proposed that a Germanic language continued to be spoken as a second tongue by public officials in western Austrasia and Neustria as late as the 850s, and that it completely disappeared as a spoken language from these regions only during the 10th century.

===German Franconia===

The Franks also expanded their rule southeast into parts of Germany. Their language had some influence on local dialects, especially for terms relating to warfare. 
However, since the language of both the administration and the Church was Latin, this unification did not lead to the development of a supra-regional variety of Franconian nor a standardized German language. At the same time that the Franks were expanding southeast into what is now southern Germany, there were linguistic changes taking place in the region. The High German consonant shift (or second Germanic consonant shift) was a phonological development (sound change) that took place in the southern parts of the West Germanic dialect continuum in several phases, probably beginning between the 3rd and 5th centuries AD, and was almost complete before the earliest written records in the High German language were made in the 9th century. The resulting language, Old High German, can be neatly contrasted with Low Franconian, which for the most part did not experience the shift.

==&quot;Frankish&quot; in linguistic terminology ==

The term &quot;Frankish&quot; or &quot;Franconian&quot; (Standard High German: &#x27;, Dutch: &#x27;) is a modern linguistic category first introduced by the German linguist Wilhelm Braune (1850–1926) to designate historical West Germanic texts which he could not readily classify as belonging to either Low Saxon, Alemannic or Bavarian. In contemporary linguistic terminology the term Franconian it used to describe a residual, non-homogeneous category of related dialects within the larger (historical) West Germanic dialect continuum. The various dialects conventionally grouped as Franconian have no common typological features which apply to all the various dialects included within the group. 

Although the practice of alluding to tribal names from the Migration Period when naming dialect groups during the early stages of Germanic Philology was common as the linguistic borders of historical ancestor dialects were, at the time, thought to closely mirror the supposed tribal duchies of the Frankish Empire at the start of the Early Middle Ages, for many of the varieties grouped under &quot;Franconian&quot;, the diachronical connection to the actual Frankish language remains unclear.

The Second Germanic consonant shift, with Low Franconian (including Dutch and Afrikaans) not participating whereas the Central Franconian (which includes Luxembourgish) did, to varying degrees, is typically the main isoglos used to divide the varieties having received the epithet &quot;Franconian&quot;.

==Influence on Old French and Middle English==
Most French words of Germanic origin came from Frankish, often replacing the Latin word which would have been used. It is estimated that modern French took approximately 1000 stem words from Old Franconian. Many of these words were concerned with agriculture (e.g. &#x27;garden&#x27;), war (e.g. &#x27;war&#x27;) or social organization (e.g. &#x27;baron&#x27;). Old Franconian has introduced the modern French word for the nation, France (Francia), meaning &#x27;land of the Franks&#x27;. According to one hypothesis, the name for the Paris region, Île-de-France, was also given by the Franks. 

The influence of Franconian on French is decisive for the birth of the early &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; compared to the other Romance languages, that appeared later such as Occitan, Romanian, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, etc., because its influence was greater than the respective influence of Visigothic and Lombardic (both Germanic languages) on Occitan, the Romance languages of Iberia, and Italian. Not all of these loanwords have been retained in modern French. French has also passed on words of Franconian origin to other Romance languages, and to English.

Old Franconian has also left many etyma in the different northern &quot;langues d&#x27;oïl&quot; such as Burgundian, Champenois, Lorrain, Northern Norman, Picard and Walloon, more than in Standard French, and not always the same ones.

Below is a non-exhaustive list of French words of Frankish origin. An asterisk prefixing a term indicates a reconstructed form of the Frankish word. Most Franconian words with the phoneme &quot;w&quot; changed it to &quot;gu&quot; when entering Old French and other Romance languages; however, the northern &quot;langues d&#x27;oil&quot; such as Picard, Northern Norman, Walloon, Burgundian, Champenois an Lorrain retained the /w/ or turned it into /v/. Perhaps the best known example is the Franconian *&quot;werra&quot; (&#x27;war&#x27; &lt; Old Northern French &quot;werre&quot;, compare Old High German &#x27;quarrel&#x27;), which entered modern French as and &quot;guerra&quot; in Italian, Occitan, Catalan, Spanish and Portuguese. Other examples include &quot;gant&quot; (&#x27;gauntlet&#x27;, from *&quot;want&quot;) and &quot;garder&quot; (&#x27;to guard&#x27;, from *&quot;wardōn&quot;). Franconian words starting with &quot;s&quot; before another consonant developed it into &quot;es&quot;- (e.g. Franconian &quot;skirm&quot; and Old French &gt; Old Italian &quot;scrimia&quot; &gt; Modern French ).

===Old French===
Franconian speech habits are also responsible for the replacement of Latin (&quot;with&quot;) with &quot;&quot; ← &quot;apud&quot; &quot;at&quot;, then with &quot;&quot; ← &quot;apud hoc&quot; &quot;at it&quot; ≠ Italian, Spanish &quot;con&quot;) in Old French (Modern French ), and for the preservation of Latin nominative &quot;man&quot; as an impersonal pronoun: cf. &quot;homme&quot; ← &quot;hominem&quot; &quot;man (accusative)&quot; and Old French → modern &quot;on&quot;, &quot;one&quot; (compare Dutch &quot;man&quot; and , &quot;one&quot;).

===Middle English===
Middle English also adopted many words with Franconian roots from Old French; e.g. &quot;random&quot; (via Old French , Old French verb , from &quot;*rant&quot; &quot;a running&quot;), &quot;standard&quot; (via Old French , from &quot;*standhard&quot; &quot;stand firm&quot;), &quot;scabbard&quot; (via Anglo-French *&quot;escauberc&quot;, from *&quot;skar-berg&quot;), &quot;grape&quot;, &quot;stale&quot;, &quot;march&quot; (via Old French , from *&quot;marka&quot;) among others.

<text>Nat Sherman is the brand name for a line of handmade cigars and &quot;luxury cigarettes&quot;. The company, which began as a retail tobacconist, continued to operate a flagship retail shop, known as the &quot;Nat Sherman Townhouse&quot;, located on 42nd Street, off Fifth Avenue, in New York City from 1930 to 2020. Corporate offices are now located at the foot of the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey.

==Company history==
===Origin===

Before he was involved in the tobacco industry, Nat Sherman made his fortune running a prominent speakeasy in New York City during the 1920s, when Prohibition made such a business extremely lucrative, albeit risky. Perhaps as the result of settlement of a gambling debt, his son later speculated, Sherman wound up as half owner of Traub Brothers and Bear, makers of the Epoca cigar brand, which introduced the nightclub proprietor into the world of tobacco manufacturing. Sherman subsequently bought out his partner to become sole owner of the Epoca brand, which was made in Havana, Cuba and Tampa, Florida.

Later, a New York real estate developer named Abe Gubertz had cash flow difficulties during the construction of a 38-story building located at 1400 Broadway, on Broadway in Manhattan. Sherman provided the struggling developer with a loan, taking retail space located in the lobby as partial payment. The shop sold cigarettes and cigars in substantial quantities to those who worked in the building and proved a means of distributing its own cigars, including Epoca and Nat Sherman-branded product. The company also was the exclusive importer and distributor of the Cuban-made Bolivar brand in the United States.

===1950s===
In the 1950s, an adjoining retail space was obtained on the street, which initially was used as a candy store. The wall between the two establishments was later broken down, paving the way for an expansion of the tobacco shop, which catered to an elite customer base which included leaders in the fashion industry, theatre, and politicians. Prominent members of organized crime &quot;families&quot; also frequented the shop, which was regarded as &quot;neutral ground&quot;.

Nat Sherman&#x27;s son Joel, company president and CEO into the 21st century, later recalled one of the shop&#x27;s most dangerous customers:
===1960s===

In 1950, Sherman introduced the plastic-tipped cigar to the industry, called Sherman&#x27;s #25. The cigar was produced in Tampa for Sherman by Carl Cuesta, an American manufacturer of cigars for brands including Partagas. The company applied for a patent for its cigar tip, which was never granted. Nevertheless, for 32 years, the company scared off rivals by marking its packaging with the words &quot;patent pending&quot; and by threatening legal action.

Sherman was also a pioneer in the manufacture of cigarettes which made use of cigar tobacco, launching a product called Havana Ovals #149 early in the 1950s. According to the company, the move to specialty small cigars and cigarettes was made at the request of an irate customer who had been unable to smoke a cigar on an airplane and who had specifically requested a cigarette that tasted like a cigar.

During the 1960s, the Sherman shop expanded its wares to include pipes. Over 1,000 pipes were offered for sale in a long case hung along the wall of the store. The company also began to sell pipe tobacco under the &quot;Nat Sherman&quot; brand name. At the time of its expansion, the company&#x27;s pipe department was perhaps the largest in New York City and the United States.

In the 1960s, a move was made to expand both the wholesale operations of the company and its cigarette manufacturing arm. The company&#x27;s previous manufacturing facility in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, was shuttered and a move made to a new and larger facility in Englewood, New Jersey.

===1970s and &#x27;80s===

In the autumn of 1976, Nat Sherman opened a shop on New York&#x27;s Fifth Avenue to bolster his tobacco brand&#x27;s status. A new location was opened at 711 Fifth Avenue, near the Plaza Hotel, across from Tiffany &amp; Company. After a period of disagreements with his father, Joel Sherman left the business for about a decade.

===1990s===
Joel Sherman returned to the company in 1990, the year after his father&#x27;s death, He became the company&#x27;s president and CEO and terminated many of the existing management staff.

The company lost its lease at 711 Fifth Avenue and moved to a new location on 42nd Street, around the corner from the New York Public Library. A total of $1.5 million was spent on the development of the new store, which has an inventory of about 500,000 cigars and a second-floor walk-in humidor and smoking room with leather-backed chairs.

Sherman&#x27;s cigar line, Metropolitan, has been manufactured since the 1990s by MATASA in the Dominican Republic. Its Gotham 1400 and Omerta products are manufactured and distributed by Santa Clara, Inc. The company&#x27;s cigarette manufacturing is conducted in its own facility in Greensboro, North Carolina.

===2010s===
On January 17, 2017, Altria Group, Inc. announced that it acquired the privately-held Sherman Group Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (Nat Sherman).
===2020s===
In July 2020, Altria delisted all the legacy Nat Sherman cigarettes, leaving only the 4 Nats brand SKUs to carry the name.

On August 3, 2020, Altria announced that Nat Sherman International Inc. will cease operations by the end of September, shutting down not only its midtown Manhattan cigar store but also its entire wholesale business.

On January 6, 2021, it was announced that Ferio Tego, LLC, a new company formed by former Nat Sherman Employees Michael Herklots and Brendon Scott, acquired the premium cigar brands formerly owned and sold by Nat Sherman International, including Timeless, Metropolitan, Epoca and Ancora, among others.

<doc id="1210365" wikidata="Q4730087" url="?curid=1210365" title="Fictitious persons disclaimer">
<text>A fictitious persons disclaimer in a work of media states that the characters portrayed in it are fictional, and not based on real persons. This is done mostly in realistic films and television programs to reduce the possibility of legal action for libel from any person who believes that they have been defamed by their portrayal in the work, whether portrayed under their real name or a different name. The wording of this disclaimer varies, and differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, as does its legal effectiveness.

==History==
The disclaimer came as a result of litigation against the 1932 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) film &quot;Rasputin and the Empress&quot;, which depicted the character Princess Natasha being seduced by Russian mystic Rasputin. Natasha was claimed to represent Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia, who sued MGM for libel. After seeing the film twice and hearing testimony, the English Court of Appeal agreed that the princess had been defamed. In 1934, Irina and her husband Felix Yusupov were reportedly awarded $127,373 () in damages, and $1,000,000 () in an out-of-court settlement with MGM. As a preventive measure against further lawsuits, the film was taken out of distribution for decades.

The film began with a claim that &quot;This concerns the destruction of an empire ... A few of the characters are still alive—the rest met death by violence.&quot; Reportedly, a justice in the case told MGM that not only was this claim damaging to their case, but that their case would be stronger if they had incorporated a directly opposite statement, that the film was not intended as an accurate portrayal of real people or events. This prompted the film industry to add the disclaimer to all future movies for decades, even when it was clearly untrue.

Despite the disclaimer&#x27;s widespread use, its actual effectiveness is unclear. In America, fictional works are already heavily protected under the First Amendment, and success of libel suits is rare, with a high burden of proof. Meanwhile, films using the disclaimer have still been successfully sued for defamation. Robert B. Kelly was awarded damages in 1948 for a negative depiction in the World War II movie &quot;They Were Expendable&quot;. An additional example was the 1980 film &quot;The Idolmaker&quot;, based on a fictional talent promoter who discovers a talentless teenage boy and turns him into a manufactured star. Singer Fabian, whose career path was similar to the fictional singer depicted in the film, took offense at the caricature, and the production company responded by bringing up the all persons fictitious disclaimer. Because Bob Marcucci, the promoter on which the fictional character was based, was part of the production staff (and thus it could not be plausibly denied that actual events inspired the film), Fabian received a settlement granting a minority stake in the film&#x27;s profits.

==Examples==

Although the disclaimer is routinely included as a boilerplate, producers sometimes vary from it, sometimes to make a statement about the veracity of their work, for humor, or to satirize the standard disclaimer.

The disclaimer is sometimes presented with qualifications.

* In Jack Webb&#x27;s police series &quot;Dragnet&quot;, each episode begins with an announcer intoning, &quot;The story you are about to see is true. The names have been changed to protect the innocent.&quot; In parody, the Square One Television &quot;Mathnet&quot; segments (an affectionate send-up of &quot;Dragnet&quot;) begins each episode with &quot;The story you are about to see is a fib, but it&#x27;s short. The names are made up, but the problems are real.&quot;
* The 1969 Western film &quot;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&quot;, based upon real individuals whose lives and exploits already had a place among American legends of the West, opens with the disclaimer &quot;Most of what follows is true.&quot;
* Because of the autobiographical nature of Dave Eggers&#x27; memoir, &quot;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius&quot;, the book features the following play on the usual disclaimer: &quot;Any resemblance to persons living or dead should be plainly apparent to them and those who know them, especially if the author has been kind enough to have provided their real names and, in some cases, their phone numbers. All events described herein actually happened, though on occasion the author has taken certain, very small, liberties with chronology, because that is his right as an American.&quot;
* &quot;South Park&quot;, which frequently features well-known public figures or parodies of them, always opens with a disclaimer that begins by stating, &quot;All characters and events in this show—even those based on real people—are entirely fictional. All celebrity voices are impersonated... poorly. The following program contains coarse language and due to its content it should not be viewed by anyone.&quot;
* The Adult Swim stop-motion animation series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; begins each episode with the disclaimer &quot;Any actual names or likenesses of celebrities are used in a fictitious and parodic manner.&quot;

Disclaimers can occasionally be used to make political or similar points. One such disclaimer is shown at the end of the industrial/political thriller &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot;, signed by the author of the original book, John le Carré: &quot;Nobody in this story, and no outfit or corporation, thank God, is based upon an actual person or outfit in the real world. But I can tell you this; as my journey through the pharmaceutical jungle progressed, I came to realize that, by comparison with the reality, my story was as tame as a holiday postcard.&quot; Other examples of such variation include:
* The 1941 film &quot;Hellzapoppin&#x27;&quot; displays a comic variant of the disclaimer during the opening titles: &quot;...any similarity between &quot;HELLZAPOPPIN&quot;&#x27; and a motion picture is purely coincidental.&quot;
* The 1943 film &quot;I Walked with a Zombie&quot; displays the following disclaimer during its opening titles: &quot;Any similarity to any persons, living, dead, OR POSSESSED, is entirely coincidental.&quot;
* The 1963 film &quot;Hands over the City&quot;, which was originally planned as a documentary but adapted into a narrative film instead in order to avoid Italian censors, ends with the notice: &quot;The characters and facts narrated here are fictional, but the social and environmental reality that produces them is real.&quot;
* The 1969 film &quot;Z&quot;, which is based on the military dictatorship ruling Greece at that time, has this notice: &quot;Any resemblance to actual events, to persons living or dead, is not the result of chance. It is DELIBERATE.&quot;
* German nobel laureate Heinrich Böll&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum&quot; was originally preceded by a statement which made the usual disclaimer, but stated that similarities to the journalistic practices of the German newspaper &quot;Bild&quot; &quot;are neither intended nor coincidental but inevitable&quot;; this disclaimer was later removed in the English edition.

The familiar disclaimer is often rewritten for humor. Early examples include The Three Stooges&#x27; parody of Nazi Germany &quot;You Nazty Spy&quot;, which stated that &quot;Any resemblance between the characters in this picture and any persons, living or dead, is a miracle,&quot; and its sequel &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Heil Again&quot;, which features a disclaimer that states that &quot;The characters in this picture are fictitious. Anyone resembling them is better off dead.&quot; Other examples include:
* In the 1966 film &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot;, set in the year 2068, a disclaimer states: &quot;None of the characters appearing in this photoplay intentionally resemble any persons living or dead... SINCE THEY DO NOT YET EXIST&quot;.
* In the 1981 film &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;, and in the 1983 music video &quot;Michael Jackson&#x27;s Thriller&quot;, the disclaimer refers to &quot;persons living, dead or undead&quot;.
* &quot;Debbie Does Dallas&quot;, a 1978 pornographic film, does not use the disclaimer in print, but Bambi Woods, in the film&#x27;s trailer, insists the film is &quot;completely fictional&quot; while at the same time surmising that the events in the film &quot;could have really happened.&quot;

Variations sometimes employ irony or satire. The 1985 film &quot;The Return of the Living Dead&quot; features a disclaimer that reads &quot;The events portrayed in this film are all true. The names are real names of real people and real organizations.&quot; The novel &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; by Kurt Vonnegut features a truncated version of the disclaimer: &quot;All persons, living and dead, are purely coincidental, and should not be construed&quot;, referring to the novel&#x27;s existentialist themes. The 1990 film &quot;Slacker&quot; ends with &quot;This story was based on fact. Any similarity with fictitious events or characters was purely coincidental.&quot; As the 1975 film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; possesses no ending credits, the disclaimer, supposedly signed by Richard Nixon, is thus instead featured in the opening credits.

In response to controversies over cultural appropriation and the use of an indigenous term, Filipino television network ABS-CBN used a special disclaimer in the 2018 &quot;fantaserye&quot; &quot;Bagani&quot;, maintaining that the series takes place in an alternate fantasy universe inspired by, but unrelated to, pre-colonial Philippines and is in no way intended to trivialize or misrepresent tribal groups: (&quot;The story you are about to watch is a work of fiction and merely takes inspiration from various Philippine legends and mythologies. It does not pertain to nor does it represent any Indigenous People in the Philippines.&quot;)

<text>Helmut Pankratz (born October 10, 1937) is a retired Canadian politician from Manitoba. Pankratz served as mayor of Steinbach from 1981 to 1986. From 1986 to 1990, he represented the electoral district of La Verendrye for the Progressive Conservative Party in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba.

He was born to a Mennonite family in Winnipeg. His parents were Henry and Justina Pankratz. Before entering politics, he worked as a farmer. On August 24, 1961, he married Dolores Jean and had two children with her: Kevin Blair and Jillayne Fay.

Pankratz was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1986, defeating Walter McDowell of the NDP by almost 2,000 votes. In the 1988 election, he defeated Liberal C.E. Goertzen by over 1,400 votes as the Progressive Conservatives formed a minority government under Gary Filmon.

Pankratz was not appointed to cabinet, but served as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Economic Development. He retired from the legislature at the calling of the 1990 provincial election, and has not returned to political life since this time.

<text>Maria Tesselschade Roemers Visscher (25 March 1594 – 20 June 1649), also called Maria Tesselschade Roemersdochter Visscher (), was a Dutch poet and glass engraver.

==Life==
Tesselschade was born in Amsterdam, the youngest of three daughters of poet and humanist Roemer Visscher. She was given the name &quot;Tesselschade&quot; (&quot;Damage on Tessel&quot;), because her father lost ships near the Dutch island Texel on Christmas Eve 1593, three months before her birth, to remember that &#x27;worldly wealth could be gone instantly.&#x27;

She and her sister, Anna, were the only female members of the Muiderkring, the group of Dutch Golden Age intellectuals who met at Muiden Castle. She is often characterised as a muse of the group and attracted the admiration of its members, such as its organiser Hooft, Huygens, Barlaeus, Bredero, Heinsius, Vondel and Jacob Cats.

In their correspondence, she is described as attractive, musically talented, and a skilled translator and commentator from French and Italian. They also praised her skill at singing, painting, carving, glass engraving and tapestry work.

The Rijksmuseum Amsterdam has an example of her engraving work, a römer drinking glass engraved with the motto &quot;Sic Soleo Amicos&quot; (&quot;this is how I treat my friends&quot;).

In 1623, she married a ship&#x27;s officer, Allard Crombalch. After he died in 1634, Huygens and Barlaeus proposed marriage to her, offers which she rejected.

==Legacy==
In remembrance of Tesselschade there are several streets named after her, such as &quot;Tesselschadestraat&quot; and &quot;Tesselschadelaan&quot; in 
Alkmaar, Eindhoven, Amsterdam, Zwolle, Leiden and Leeuwarden.

<text>Alexander Picton Brereton (13 November 1892 – 10 January 1976) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was the son of a Manitoba farmer, Cloudesley Picton Brereton and Annie Frazer Black. He married Mary Isabel McPhee on 17 Jun 1925 and had three children. He was a barber. Brereton joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force in January 1916.

==Action==

Brereton was 25 years old, and an acting corporal in the 8th (Winnipeg Rifles) Battalion, CEF during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 9 August 1918 east of Amiens, France, during an attack when a line of hostile machine-guns opened fire suddenly on his platoon which was in an exposed position with no cover. Corporal Brereton realised that unless something was done, his platoon would be annihilated. On his own initiative he at once sprang forward alone and, reaching one of the enemy machine-gun posts, shot the operator of the gun and bayoneted the next one who attempted to operate it, whereupon nine others surrendered. His action inspired the platoon to charge and capture the five remaining posts.

==Further information==
He later achieved the rank of Company Quartermaster Sergeant during World War II. He is at buried at Elnora Cemetery, Elnora, Alberta, Canada. Brereton&#x27;s medals are on display at the Lord Ashcroft Gallery, Imperial War Museum in London.

<text>AZLK (&quot;АЗЛК - Автомобильный завод имени Ленинского Комсомола&quot; in Russian, Avtomobilny Zavod imeni Leninskogo Komsomola) is a Soviet and Russian automobile manufacturer (Moscow), the maker of the Moskvitch brand.

==History==
Founded in 1930 as KIM, or &quot;Communist Youth International&quot;, the plant became MZMA (&quot;Moscow Small Car Factory&quot;) in 1939, before finally changing its name to the more familiar &quot;Avtomobilny Zavod imeni Leninskogo Komsomola&quot; (AZLK), literally &quot;Lenins Komsomol Automobile Factory&quot; in 1969.

Beginning in 1939, the factory&#x27;s passenger cars were sold under the &quot;Moskvitch&quot; (Muscovite, a person whose origin or place of residence is Moscow) brand. The plant was originally under the authority of Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod (GAZ – Gorky Automobile Factory) founded at about the same time, but by 1939 it was operationally independent.

AZLK&#x27;s role in the Soviet automotive industry was the production of small cars, which could be classified as anywhere from compact to mid-size. AvtoVAZ and IZh were also charged with producing vehicles in the same category as AZLK, while GAZ handled the large car and full-size segment.

Following privatization in 1991, AZLK adopted Moskvitch as its corporate name, as it had already been used on all of the company&#x27;s cars dating to 1939.

===1929–1941===

The construction of the plant called &quot;Moscow Car Assembly Factory&quot; (Russian: Московский автосборочный завод) began in 1929. In 1930 the production of Ford A and Ford AA from parts that were provided by the Ford Motor Company began. In December 1930 the plant was named KIM (Zavod imeni Kommunsticheskogo Internatsionala Molodyozhi, Russian: КИМ (Завод имени Коммунистического Интернационала Молодёжи) - Communist Youth International, literally &quot;&quot;Factory named after Communist Youth International&quot;), from 1930 to 1939 its official name was Moscow Car Assembly Factory named after KIM (Московский автосборочный завод имени КИМ) and then from 1939 until the beginning of the Great Patriotic War it was called Moscow Car Factory named after KIM (Московский автомобильный завод имени КИМ). In 1933, the production of the Ford A and Ford AA ceased. On August 1, 1933, the factory became a subsidiary of GAZ and produced GAZ AA using parts from GAZ. In 1939, KIM was no longer the subsidiary of GAZ and in the following year it started to produce their first own and original model, the KIM 10-50 (two-door saloon), inspired by the Ford Prefect. There was also a convertible known as the KIM 10–51. Around 500 cars of both versions were made before the beginning of the Great Patriotic War. In the early 1941, approximately 2 prototypes of the KIM 10-52 were built. It was a four-door saloon which was the major difference between the KIM 10-52 and the KIM 10–50. There were plans for mass production of this car but they were interrupted by the beginning of the war.

===Post-war years===
In May 1945, the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the USSR adopted a decision on the production of small cars named &quot;Moskvich&quot;. The plant was renamed to the &quot;Small Car Plant&quot; (PCA), and later again to &quot;Moscow Plant of Small Cars&quot;&quot; (MZMA, Moskovskiy Zavod Malolitrazhniy Avtomobiliy). In agreement with Opel, the plant started to produce the Moskvich-400 passenger car based on the Opel Kadett. In 1956, MZMA launched into production its own and highly successful model, the Moskvitch-402, that was followed by the upgraded and restyled versions known as the M-403 and M-407 and later by the brand new Moskvitch-408 series. On May 18, 1967, the company produced its one millionth car. The same year, the first new Moskvitch 412 appeared. The M-407 was the first Soviet automotive export to be truly successful in the West. Up to half of all M-407 production was exported for a number of years, mainly to the Eastern Bloc countries, Norway, Finland, and France. Later models also proved a good value in Britain, Finland, and Norway, for instance, and in 1968, 55% of production was for export.

The name of the company was changed from &quot;MZMA&quot; to &quot;AZLK&quot; in October 1968 in honour of the &quot;Lenin Komsomol&quot;″s fiftieth anniversary.

During the 1960s, AZLK proposed the M-415 and M-416 four-wheel drive vehicles. They were not proceeded with, either.

In 1970, AZLK updated the M-412&#x27;s styling, with the 353. Using M-412 mechanicals, it was larger but recognizably related. The 355 of 1972 was larger still, with greater length, more wheelbase, and more width. This made both the interior and the boot noticeably larger. The 355 was further developed into the 356 between 1973 and 1975, with &quot;much bolder front end styling&quot;, new suspension, and an enlarged version of the DM engine with twin Zenith carburetors, giving , with a Borg-Warner transmission planned. 1600cc and 1700cc engines were also planned. None was built.
AZLK in August 1974 sold its two millionth unit.

In order to replace the 408 and M-412, in 1975 Moskvitch designed a four-door fastback C1 (Series One), with a version of the DM straight four, offering , to give a top speed of . Unlike the M-412, it had MacPherson struts in front and independent trailing arms in back. It did not reach the company&#x27;s goals and was never built, but inspired the four door C2 in 1976, which never passed the mockup stage, and the C3, which was very similar but a five-door hatchback. The engine would have been fitted at an angle from the vertical (like the Chrysler slant six). None of these projects reached production.

The M-408 and M-412 were discontinued in December 1975, replaced by facelifted variants, the 2138 (1360) and 2140 (1500), which entered production the next month. In fact, the M-2138 and M-2140 were built in stages: M-412 bodies with the boot lid, rear wings, and tail of the M-2140; then M-2140 bodies with M-412 doors; and then, early in 1976, all-M-2140s. These &quot;hybrid&quot; models are now very rare. The M-21381 and M-21401 were offered as ambulance models, also, as well as the right-hand drive M-21402. In addition, there was a &quot;rural&quot; M-21406, with a low-compression engine. (This same engine, in the standard model, earned the designation M-2140D.)

They were joined in 1976 by the -powered 2136 and -engined M-2137 estate; these were sold in much smaller numbers, the M-2136 surviving only until 1977. There were also two sedan delivery variants, the M-2733 () and M-2734 (). A small number of pickups (M-27334 and M-27344, with () and (), respectively); these weren&#x27;t produced for a long time, either. By the 1980s, the deliveries had virtually disappeared, as well, because AZLK simply could not keep up with a demand for saloons.

Although the M-2138 and M-2140 were sold in Eastern Europe and exported to Belgium and Finland, where they were sold under the Scaldia marque, they were being gradually pushed off the market by a large variety of cars offered by AvtoVAZ. In response, Moskvitch launched into production a brand new and much more modern rear-wheel drive car with a roomy interior in 1986, the Moskvitch-2141, that was often upgraded and restyled during the period of its production.

===Post-Soviet period===

In the early 1990s AZLK still remained one of the largest auto companies in the USSR. Design and experimental work was prepared to create a new model car (sedan M-2142) and an engine plant.

As of 2022, the brand restarted production in the Russian market with the use of licensed Chinese vehicles making use of a factory that was once owned by Renault.
