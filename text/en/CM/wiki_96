<text>Hyperplasia (from ancient Greek ὑπέρ &quot;huper&quot; &#x27;over&#x27; + πλάσις &quot;plasis&quot; &#x27;formation&#x27;), or hypergenesis, is an enlargement of an organ or tissue caused by an increase in the amount of organic tissue that results from cell proliferation. It may lead to the gross enlargement of an organ, and the term is sometimes confused with benign neoplasia or benign tumor.

Hyperplasia is a common preneoplastic response to stimulus. Microscopically, cells resemble normal cells but are increased in numbers. Sometimes cells may also be increased in size (hypertrophy). Hyperplasia is different from hypertrophy in that the adaptive cell change in hypertrophy is an increase in the &quot;size&quot; of cells, whereas hyperplasia involves an increase in the &quot;number&quot; of cells.

== Causes ==
Hyperplasia may be due to any number of causes, including proliferation of basal layer of epidermis to compensate skin loss, chronic inflammatory response, hormonal dysfunctions, or compensation for damage or disease elsewhere. Hyperplasia may be harmless and occur on a particular tissue. An example of a normal hyperplastic response would be the growth and multiplication of milk-secreting glandular cells in the breast as a response to pregnancy, thus preparing for future breast feeding.

Perhaps the most interesting and potent effect insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF) has on the human body is its ability to cause hyperplasia, which is an actual splitting of cells. By contrast, hypertrophy is what occurs, for example, to skeletal muscle cells during weight training and is simply an increase in the size of the cells. With IGF use, one is able to cause hyperplasia which actually increases the number of muscle cells present in the tissue. Weight training enables these new cells to mature in size and strength. It is theorized that hyperplasia may also be induced through specific power output training for athletic performance, thus increasing the number of muscle fibers instead of increasing the size of a single fiber.

==Mechanism==

Hyperplasia is considered to be a physiological (normal) response to a specific stimulus, and the cells of a hyperplastic growth remain subject to normal regulatory control mechanisms. However, hyperplasia can also occur as a pathological response, if an excess of hormone or growth factor is responsible for the stimuli. Similarly to physiological hyperplasia, cells that undergo pathologic hyperplasia are controlled by growth hormones, and cease to proliferate if such stimuli are removed. This differs from neoplasia (the process underlying cancer and benign tumors), in which genetically abnormal cells manage to proliferate in a non-physiological manner which is unresponsive to normal stimuli. That being said, the effects caused by pathologic hyperplasia can provide a suitable foundation from which neoplastic cells may develop.

== Role in disease ==
Hyperplasia of certain tissues may cause disease. Pathologic hyperplasia in these tissues may occur due to infection, physiological stress or trauma, or abnormal levels of particular hormones, such as estrogen, ACTH, or cortisol.

===Types===

Some of the more commonly known clinical forms of hyperplasia, or conditions leading to hyperplasia, include:
* Benign prostatic hyperplasia, also known as prostate enlargement.
* Cushing&#x27;s disease – Physiopathology of hyperplasia of adrenal cortex due to increased circulating level of ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone).
* Congenital adrenal hyperplasia – Inherited disorder of gland (adrenal).
* Endometrial hyperplasia – Hyperproliferation of the endometrium, usually in response to unopposed estrogen stimulation in the setting of polycystic ovary syndrome or exogenous administration of hormones. Atypical endometrial hyperplasia may represent an early neoplastic process which can lead to endometrial adenocarcinoma. The development of endometrial adenocarcinoma from endometrial hyperplasia is a typical example of how the effects of pathologic hyperplasia can lead to neoplasia, and females who exhibit hyperplasia of the endometrium are indeed more likely to develop cancer of these cells.

* Hemihyperplasia – When only half (or one side) of the body is affected, sometimes generating limbs of different lengths.
* Hyperplasia of the breast – &quot;Hyperplastic&quot; lesions of the breast include &quot;usual ductal hyperplasia&quot;, a focal expansion of the number of cells in a terminal breast duct, and &quot;atypical ductal hyperplasia&quot;, in which a more abnormal pattern of growth is seen, and which is associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer.
* Intimal hyperplasia – The thickening of the tunica intima of a blood vessel as a complication of a reconstruction procedure or endarterectomy. Intimal hyperplasia is the universal response of a vessel to injury and is an important reason of late bypass graft failure, particularly in vein and synthetic vascular grafts.
* Focal epithelial hyperplasia (also known as Heck&#x27;s disease) – This is a wart-like growth in the mucous tissues of the mouth or, rarely, throat that is caused by certain sub-types of the human papillomavirus (HPV). Heck&#x27;s disease has not been known to cause cancer.
* Myofibre hyperplasia (also known as double-muscling) – seen in cattle, genetic mutations cause large muscles due to increased proliferation of myofibres and decreased adipose tissue.
* Sebaceous hyperplasia – In this condition, small yellowish growths develop on the skin, usually on the face. This condition is neither contagious nor dangerous.
* Compensatory liver hyperplasia – The liver undergoes cellular division after acute injury, resulting in new cells that restore liver function back to baseline. Approximately 75% of the liver can be acutely damaged or resected with seemingly full regeneration through hepatocyte division, i.e., hyperplasia. This is what makes living-donor liver transplants possible.

<doc id="1226317" wikidata="Q1617129" url="?curid=1226317" title="Hi-Five">
<text>Hi-Five is an American R&amp;B quintet from Waco, Texas. Hi-Five had a No. 1 hit on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Hot 100 in 1991 with &quot;I Like the Way (The Kissing Game)&quot;. 

The band was originally formed in 1989 as a trio: childhood friends Tony Thompson, Russell Neal, and Oklahoma native, Toriano Easley. Jive Records suggested adding childhood friends, Roderick &quot;Pooh&quot; Clark and Marcus Sanders, to the ensemble and later signed these founding members as Hi-Five.

During the release of their debut album, Toriano Easley was charged with a crime, which involved a dispute with his neighborhood friends, rendering him unable to continue with the group. The record label recruited New York native Treston Irby, as a replacement member. After the release of their second album, Russell Neal left the group after financial conflicts with the label. Unfortunately congruently, while the four members of the group were continuing to tour, Roderick &quot;Pooh&quot; Clark was injured in a vehicle collision, leaving him paralyzed from the neck down, resulting in his departure from the group. The label added Shannon Gill and Terrence Murphy as replacement members.

When the group decided to accept an offer from Giant records to change labels, while their Jive contract was still pending, Giant records, instead decided to focus their attention on lead singer Tony Thompson, neglecting the projects related to the group. Because of this discrepancy, the group disbanded. Tony Thompson was later signed to Bad Boy Records. In 2005, without consulting the initial members of Hi-Five, Tony Thompson put together several new vocalists to form a new incarnation of the band, under the Hi-Five name. This later resulted in a legal battle, between Thompson and former Hi-Five members, which put the band on even more haphazard terms. In 2007, lead singer Tony Thompson, died in drug related circumstances. In 2012, as a result of Thompson&#x27;s passing, the former members of Hi-Five decided to reunite in Thompson&#x27;s honor. 

== Early career ==
Hi-Five was originally signed to Jive Records in late 1989 and released their eponymous debut album in 1990. The album was produced by Teddy Riley and went platinum. It included singles &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Handle It&quot; (R&amp;B No. 10), &quot;I Can&#x27;t Wait Another Minute&quot; (Pop No. 8, R&amp;B No.1) and &quot;I Like the Way (The Kissing Game)&quot;, which went to number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the U.S. Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart (making it their biggest hit to date). 

The group&#x27;s second LP, &quot;Keep It Goin&#x27; On&quot;, was released in 1992. Though not as successful as their debut effort, several tracks from this album, including &quot;She&#x27;s Playing Hard to Get&quot; (Pop No. 5, R&amp;B No. 2) and the R. Kelly-penned &quot;Quality Time&quot; (Pop No. 38, R&amp;B No. 3) got major airplay in East Coast (US) urban markets. Shortly after this album was released, the group was involved in a vehicular accident, which left Roderick &quot;Pooh&quot; Clark paralyzed from the chest down.

In 1993, Hi-Five emerged with a third album, &quot;Faithful&quot;, which featured the songs &quot;Unconditional Love&quot; (Pop No. 92, R&amp;B No. 21) and &quot;Never Should&#x27;ve Let You Go&quot; (Pop No. 30, R&amp;B No. 10). &quot;Unconditional Love&quot; was also featured in the multi-platinum &quot;Menace II Society&quot; soundtrack, and received extensive airplay on urban contemporary stations throughout the summer of 1993 as the movie increased in popularity. &quot;Never Should&#x27;ve Let You Go&quot; was featured on the &quot;Sister Act 2&quot; soundtrack.

== Later career ==
On June 1, 2007, Tony Thompson&#x27;s body was discovered by security officers at around 10 p.m. near an air-conditioning unit outside of an apartment complex in his native Waco, Texas. An autopsy later determined that he had died from &quot;toxic effects of chlorodifluoromethane&quot;, or inhaling a toxic amount of freon. He is buried at Doris Miller Memorial Park in Waco.

In 2011, Treston Irby released his debut solo single &quot;Everything&quot; under the mantle Tru$ on his independent label, Bronx Most Wanted Ent. 

In 2012, Irby, Shannon Gill and Marcus Sanders reformed Hi-Five with two new members, Andre Ramseur (aka Dre Wonda) and Faruq Evans. They released a single called &quot;Favorite Girl&quot; also on the BMW label. Ramseur later left the group and was replaced by Billy Covington. 

On July 2, 2014, former Hi-Five member Russell Neal was charged with murder, over the fatal stabbing of his wife in Houston.

Hi-Five was featured on the TVOne music documentary series &quot;Unsung&quot; on August 6, 2014, chronicling the quintet&#x27;s upbringing in Waco, their rise to superstardom, tragedies among group members, and their comeback.

Former member Roderick “Pooh” Clark died on April 17, 2022, at the age of 49.

<text>Jochen Richard Mass (; born 30 September 1946) is a German former racing driver and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One from to . Mass won the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix with McLaren. In endurance racing, Mass won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in with Sauber.

Born and raised in Bavaria, Mass made appearances in Formula Super Vee, Formula Three and European Formula Two throughout his early career. He finished runner-up in the latter in 1973, having already taken victory at the 24 Hours of Spa alongside Hans-Joachim Stuck the year prior. Mass made his Formula One debut at the 1973 British Grand Prix with Surtees, making sporadic appearances before achieving a full-time seat in . Mass moved to McLaren from the onwards, where he achieved his only race win at the curtailed 1975 Spanish Grand Prix. In his final season with McLaren in , having taken several podiums with the team, Mass finished a career-best sixth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. After a non-classified championship finish in with ATS, Mass spent two seasons at Arrows. He was seriously injured at the 1980 Austrian Grand Prix, bruising his neck and fracturing vertebrae as his Arrows A3 rolled over during practice. After a year hiatus, Mass returned in with March. Following his crash with Mauro Baldi at the 1982 French Grand Prix—only two months after his involvement in the death of Gilles Villeneuve—Mass retired from Formula One, having achieved one win, two fastest laps and eight podiums.

Outside of Formula One, Mass entered 12 editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans from to , winning in alongside Manuel Reuter and Stanley Dickens, driving the Sauber C9, as well as finishing runner-up in the World Sportscar Championship, matching his result from 1984. He also finished runner-up at Le Mans in with Porsche. Mass was the champion of the Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft in 1985, as well as twice finishing runner-up in Interserie, all with Joest. Mass was also a race-winner in the British Saloon Car Championship. Upon retiring from motor racing, Mass became a commentator for RTL from 1994 to 1998. Since the 1990s, Mass has made frequent appearances at Goodwood events, including the &quot;Festival of Speed&quot; and the &quot;Revival&quot;. In popular culture, Mass appeared as himself in &quot;Rush&quot; (2013). 

==Personal life==

Jochen Richard Mass was born on 30 September 1946 in Dorfen, Bavaria. His fathers family came from Mecklenburg where his grandfather worked as a ship captain. This led to Maas working on ships of the Merchant navy after leaving school which started a lifelong passion for boats and sailing. His interest in racing started late when he attended a hillclimbing race where his girlfriend worked as a steward. He then quit working on a ship and started an apprenticeship at an Alfa Romeo dealership in Mannheim. The owner entered Alfas in numerous racing events, saw Maas&#x27; talent which started his racing career.

During his racing career Maas resided in Monaco. Today he lives in Southern France with his current wife Bettina. He has two sons with his first wife Esti and two daughters with Bettina.

==Life and career==

Mass participated in 114 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 14 July 1973 at the British Grand Prix. He won one GP race (1975 Spanish Grand Prix), secured no pole positions, achieved 8 podiums and scored a total of 71 championship points.

Mass is perhaps best known for his on-track incident with Gilles Villeneuve which led to the latter&#x27;s death. On 8 May 1982, with only 10 minutes left until the end of the qualifying session for the 1982 Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder, Villeneuve collided with Mass while attempting to overtake him. As Villeneuve came up behind Mass exiting a super-fast left turn, Mass moved to the right hand side of the track to let Villeneuve through. Villeneuve had already committed to the right hand side and the two cars touched wheels, launching the Canadian skyward. Villeneuve&#x27;s car hit the ground nose-first and was then torn apart in a series of violent cartwheels. His seat was dislodged and he was flung from his car, landing heavily among the catch fencing at the opposite side of the track. Mass stopped his car, jumped out and ran back to Villeneuve&#x27;s wrecked car. Villeneuve was flown to hospital and taken off life-support later that evening.

After leaving the Formula One circuit, Mass enjoyed great success in sports car racing, gaining international prominence with his performance during the European Touring Car Championship in the early 1970s. In 1972, he teamed up with Hans-Joachim Stuck to drive a Ford Capri RS2600 to victory at the Spa 24 Hours endurance race in Belgium. He went on to win that year&#x27;s World Sportscar Championship. He finished second to Clay Regazzoni and Arturo Merzario in a November 1972 9-hour race at the Kyalami Circuit, in Johannesburg, South Africa. Mass&#x27; co-driver in a Chevron B-21 was Gerry Birrell. Mass, driving a Surtees TS-15, tied with Jean Pierre Beltoise in qualifying for the
Jim Clark Memorial Formula Two auto race in April 1973 held at Hockenheim, both drivers recording times of 2 minutes, 2.8 seconds, for an average of 124.3 miles per hour.

Mass placed second to Jean-Pierre Jarier in a Formula Two race at Nivelles, in June 1973. He had finished second in the first heat and third in the second. In his first Formula One race at the 1973 British Grand Prix he wasn&#x27;t able to complete a lap, because he, as well as his two Surtees teammates, were part of the multi-car-collision that led to the end of Andrea de Adamichs career. He completed his first Formula One race at the 1973 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring. Mass came in seventh in a Surtees. 

After driving three races for them in 1973, he secured a full-time ride with Surtees for the 1974 season. Maas soon was unhappy with the team, because John Surtees couldn&#x27;t afford to pay him regularly and they were using cheap, low-quality material for the car which broke constantly. At the 1974 Monaco Grand Prix qualifying a part of the right rear suspension broke on his TS16. Maas blamed it on faulty material, while John Surtees insisted that Maas hit the wall somewhere on the track. Maas subsequently refused to start the race. He continued to race for the team for five more races until John Surtees agreed to let him out of his contract and Maas went on to sign with McLaren. At the last race of the season at Watkins Glen his replacement at Surtees Helmut Koinigg, whom Maas warned about the car on the flight to North America, died in an accident caused by suspension failure.

He drove a McLaren-Ford to third place in the 1975 Brazilian Grand Prix at Interlagos.

Mass won the 1975 Spanish Grand Prix after leader, Rolf Stommelen&#x27;s car hit a protective barrier, exploded into flames and catapulted into the crowd at the Montjuich circuit. Four spectators were killed and twelve were injured. Stommelen suffered multiple fractures and was in a critical condition after the accident. Mass was declared the winner in his Texaco McLaren-Ford, when the race was stopped immediately after the accident.

Merzario and Mass led an Alfa Romeo sweep of the first two positions in the 1975 Coppa Florio manufacturers championship automobile race at Pergusa. Mass was third in the 1975 French Grand Prix at Le Castellet. On lap 44 he broke the record set by Denny Hulme, clocking a time of 1:50.60 over the 3.61-mile circuit. Mass and Jacky Ickx teamed in a Porsche to claim victory in the Dijon Six-Hour Race. Mass won the eighth and final race of the 1976 World Sports Car Championship series. He completed the 4.2 kilometre, Salzburg course in 1 hour, 28 minutes, 25.24 seconds, with an average speed of 125 m.p.h. 

At the 1976 German Grand Prix Maas was in a good position to win his home Grand Prix. He was the only one to start on dry tires on a partially wet Nordschleife. The track dried and after the second lap he led with a good margin after the other drivers all needed to pit for dry tires. The race was stopped after the severe accident of Niki Lauda and restarted in dry conditions which eliminated Maas&#x27; advantage and he finished 3rd while his teammate James Hunt won the race.

Mass and Ickx drove a Porsche 935 in the 1977 24 Hours of Daytona endurance race. Mass was clocked at 126.477 m.p.h. around the 3.84 mile Daytona road course. Mass won both 20-lap heats of the 1977 Jim Clark Memorial race in Hockenheim. He drove a March-BMW.

After the 1977 season Maas left McLaren and signed with the ATS team, because of his good relationship with Robin Herd who was hired as the technical director. Herd left the team early in the season after disagreements with team owner Günter Schmid. Maas&#x27; season proved disastrous, scoring no points, failing to qualify for three races and having to sit out the last three races after braking his leg during testing. He subsequently left the team and moved to Arrows for 1979 season.

During his two seasons with Arrows he recorded five points finishes. His best showings were at the two Monaco GPs. In 1979 he was on road to a podium finish around 15 seconds behind the leading Ferraris when his brakes failed. After a lengthy repair pit stop he still finished sixth albeit seven laps down. In 1980 he recorded his best non-McLaren F1 finish there with a fourth place.

Mass&#x27; Arrows turned over several times at the 1980 Austrian Grand Prix at Zeltweg. He bruised his neck and wrenched a vertebra but was able to leave the hospital.

Mass was convinced to stop racing Formula One cars after an accident with Mauro Baldi at the 1982 French Grand Prix at Paul Ricard. His March and the Arrows of Baldi touched at maximum speeds, both cars flying off the track and through a containment fence. Mass&#x27;s car continued, hitting a tyre-lined guardrail. The March finally came to rest upside down and on fire, almost halfway into a spectator area. Amazingly he escaped with light burns only, and Baldi was uninjured.

Among his many victories, in 1985 he won the Circuito del Mugello 1,000 km race in Italy driving a Porsche 962C and in 1987 partnered with Bobby Rahal to claim victory at the 1987 12 Hours of Sebring race. Mass and Bobby Rahal combined to win the Champion Spark Plug Grand Prix at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course in Lexington, Ohio. Driving a Porsche 962, they inherited the lead 18 laps from the end. Mass won the most prestigious endurance race of all, the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in 1989 driving a Sauber Mercedes C9. It was the second triumph for Mercedes-Benz at Le Mans, their previous win having come in 1952. At Sauber he served as a mentor to their stable of young drivers including Michael Schumacher, Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Karl Wendlinger.

Jochen Mass now drives the Mercedes-Benz museum&#x27;s historic cars. In the 2004 Mille Miglia, he drove the original Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR that Stirling Moss had driven to victory in the 1955 race. To raise money for charity, the passenger seat next to him was auctioned off to the highest bidder.

From 1994 to 1998, he also announced the Formula One races for German broadcaster RTL.

Mass played himself in Ron Howard&#x27;s 2013 film &quot;Rush&quot;.

<text>Stefan Nils Edwin Johansson (born 8 September 1956) is a Swedish former racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One between and . In endurance racing, Johansson won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in with Joest.

Born and raised in Växjö, Johansson began his career in kart racing, winning the Swedish Championship in 1973. After achieving multiple national titles in Formula Ford, Johansson progressed to British Formula Three, winning the championship in 1980. Johansson also made his Formula One debut that year—at the with Shadow—but did not qualify for either round he contested. Following multiple race wins in European Formula Two and podiums in the World Sportscar Championship, Johansson returned to Formula One in with Spirit. After sporadic appearances for Tyrrell and Toleman in , Johansson signed for Ferrari the following season, achieving his maiden podium finish in Canada. Retaining his seat for , Johansson scored several podiums as he finished a career-best fifth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. Replaced by Gerhard Berger at Ferrari in , Johansson moved to McLaren to partner Alain Prost; he scored five podiums on his way to sixth in the standings, but left for Ligier at the end of the season. After a non-classified championship finish in , Johansson moved to Onyx, scoring the team&#x27;s only podium finish at the 1989 Portuguese Grand Prix. He was dropped by Onyx after the 1990 Brazilian Grand Prix, making further appearances for AGS and Footwork in before leaving Formula One, having achieved 12 podiums.

In addition to his 10 seasons in Formula One, Johansson entered 15 editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans between and , taking three class wins amongst an overall win in , driving the Porsche WSC-95 alongside Michele Alboreto and Tom Kristensen. He also competed in the IndyCar World Series from 1992 to 1996, both seasons of Grand Prix Masters, and the inaugural season of the FIA World Endurance Championship.

==Early life and career==
Stefan Nils Edwin Johansson was born on 8 September 1956 in Växjö, Sweden. Johansson began his career in kart racing, where he won the Swedish Championship in 1973. He then progressed to Formula Ford, winning the Swedish title in both 1977 and 1979.

Johansson competed in the British Formula Three Championship from 1978 to 1980, winning the series in his final year, driving for future McLaren chief executive Ron Dennis&#x27; Project Four team.

==Formula One career==
In Formula One he participated in 103 Grands Prix, debuting on 13 January 1980 for the Shadow Racing Team at the 1980 Argentine Grand Prix when he was still a Formula Three regular. He failed to qualify for the race and the next race in Brazil and he was not seen in Formula One again until 1983, after spending 1982 in the European Formula Two Championship with Spirit Racing, where he finished eighth overall, his best finish being third at Mugello in Italy.

===Spirit (1983)===
Johansson&#x27;s first Formula One race with Spirit was at the non-championship 1983 Race of Champions at Brands Hatch, where he failed to finish due to failure of the Honda engine on lap four. His qualifying time was almost 20 seconds off the pole time set by World Champion Keke Rosberg in his Williams-Cosworth, but his times in the race morning warm-up session were within a second of the Ferrari 126C2B of René Arnoux, who was fastest. He moved up to seventh place before pulling into the pits with another engine failure. Anecdotally, then-BBC commentator Murray Walker said on air that Spirit and Honda had completed thousands of miles of trouble-free testing until that point. Spirit continued to test and develop the 201C and Johansson re-entered Formula One at the 1983 British Grand Prix at Silverstone where he qualified the car in a credible 14th position. He raced in a further five Grands Prix in 1983, with a best finish of seventh in the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort.

===Tyrrell/Toleman (1984)===

Stefan Johansson was replaced at Spirit by Mauro Baldi for the season when the team lost its Honda engines to Williams and he didn&#x27;t race until he joined Tyrrell in Round 10 of the championship, the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch, as a replacement for the injured Martin Brundle. He then went on to drive for Toleman for the last few Grands Prix of the season in place of the injured Johnny Cecotto, finishing fourth in the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. While at Toleman, Johansson&#x27;s regular teammate was future triple World Drivers&#x27; Champion Ayrton Senna.

===Ferrari (1985–1986)===

Johansson signed a contract with Toleman for but it fell through when Toleman failed to secure a tyre agreement. Instead Johansson started again with Tyrrell as a replacement for the suspended Stefan Bellof before being called up to Ferrari when René Arnoux was mysteriously sacked after the first race of the season in Brazil. At his second race with Ferrari, namely their &#x27;home&#x27; race, the San Marino Grand Prix, two laps from home he passed Senna&#x27;s out-of-fuel Lotus to take the lead to the delight of the Tifosi, and would probably have won if his Ferrari 156/85 had not run out of fuel itself just half a lap later. His role at Ferrari for the 1985 season was primarily to support Michele Alboreto&#x27;s championship challenge, though he did finish second to the Italian at Canada, and backed it up with second in the next race at Detroit.

In , he often outpaced Alboreto, despite the Italian being the team&#x27;s lead driver. The V6 turbo in the Ferrari F1/86 lacked nothing in power compared to the Honda, BMW, Renault and TAG-Porsche engines, but the car itself proved to be difficult, with both drivers complaining through the season about lack of downforce and the car&#x27;s reluctance to drive well on all but the smoothest of circuits. Johansson finished fifth in the 1986 Drivers&#x27; Championship, his best-ever position, while Alboreto, who finished second in 1985, could only manage ninth place. There were many in Formula One, including highly respected then-BBC commentators Murray Walker and World Champion James Hunt, who believed that Ferrari were sacking the wrong driver, given that the Swede had generally outshone his more highly-paid teammate throughout the season.

===McLaren (1987)===
He was replaced at Ferrari by Austrian Gerhard Berger for and he moved to McLaren as number two driver behind double and reigning World Champion Alain Prost. McLaren weren&#x27;t as competitive in 1987 as they had been in 1984–1986, with Prost only adding three wins to his tally (and beating the record of 27 Grand Prix wins held by Jackie Stewart with his 28th win in Portugal) and failing to successfully defend his Drivers&#x27; Championship. Further podium finishes did follow for the Swede and Johansson finished sixth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Stefan Johansson&#x27;s position at McLaren was considered by many as just a stop gap signing by team boss Ron Dennis who had failed to lure Ayrton Senna from Lotus due to him being under contract until the end of 1987 and always intended signing the Brazilian for . Johansson famously finished the 1987 German Grand Prix on three wheels having had a puncture on the last lap. He also finished second behind Prost in Belgium and added further podium finishes in Brazil, Spain and Japan. Despite 11 podiums in three seasons, Johansson was still winless and was not wanted by a top team (he had hoped to join Williams in 1988 as a replacement for the departing 1987 World Champion Nelson Piquet but Williams signed Riccardo Patrese instead). He did return to McLaren in a test-driver capacity in 1990, testing the Honda V12 engine at Suzuka in Japan and helping with the development of a paddle shifter and a new gearbox.

===Ligier (1988)===
He joined Ligier for 1988, ironically alongside the man he replaced at Ferrari, René Arnoux, but the team&#x27;s first non-turbo powered car since , the Michel Beaujon-designed JS31 powered by a naturally aspirated Judd V8 engine, was totally uncompetitive, scoring no points and often failed to qualify, even against teams with much smaller budgets such as AGS and Rial (the French team&#x27;s low point of the year was when both Johansson and Arnoux failed to qualify for the French Grand Prix at Paul Ricard in the first weekend of July). Unfortunately for Johansson, he failed to come to grips with the JS31, recording six non-qualifications during the season (compared to Arnoux who only failed to qualify twice). He did record the car&#x27;s two best finishes of the year though, ninth placings in the opening race of the season in Brazil and the last race in Australia.

===Onyx/AGS/Footwork (1989–1991)===
Better was to follow in as he was signed to lead the new Onyx team. The car was temperamental and didn&#x27;t always qualify, but Johansson finished a surprise and popular third in Portugal for his last (and the team&#x27;s only) podium finish. He fell out with new team owner Peter Monteverdi in early 1990 and was duly sacked, making further appearances for AGS and Footwork in .

Johansson&#x27;s record of podium finishes without a win was equalled by Nick Heidfeld at the 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix, who then took the record outright at the 2011 Malaysian Grand Prix.

In his 11-year Formula One career, in which he drove for 10 different teams at 103 Grands Prix, Johansson achieved 12 podiums and scored a total of 88 championship points.

== CART career ==
For 1992 he moved over to CART Championship Car, winning the Rookie of the Year title with two third places, ahead of Belgium&#x27;s Éric Bachelart. His first pole came at Portland the next year, but as in Formula One he never won a race. From 1992 to 1996, he started 73 races and had his best season overall in 1994, finishing in 11th. During this time, he competed in the 1993–1995 Indianapolis 500. At the 1996 Molson Indy Toronto race, he was involved in an accident that claimed the life of fellow driver Jeff Krosnoff and track marshal Gary Avrin. After making wheel to wheel contact, Jeff&#x27;s car hit the barriers and also a tree and lamp post that was too close to the track. Krosnoff died instantly of the injuries sustained from hitting the lamp post.

==After Formula One: Sports Cars and team ownership==
Before his Formula One career Johansson had participated in sports car races such as 24 Hours of Le Mans, and had won two World Sportscar Championship races in the 1980s (the Mugello round in 1983, driving a Joest Racing Porsche 956 with Bob Wollek, and the 1988 Spa Francorchamps race in a Sauber C9 with Mauro Baldi).

After retiring from CART at the end of the 1996 season he returned to this type of racing. During 1997 he recorded two major race wins, at the 12 Hours of Sebring driving a Ferrari 333 SP with Andy Evans, Fermín Vélez and Yannick Dalmas. Later in 1997 Johansson also won at Le Mans where he drove a TWR-Porsche WSC-95 for Joest Racing alongside his Ferrari F1 teammate of 1985 and 1986 Michele Alboreto, and young Dane Tom Kristensen. For Kristensen it was to be the first of a record (as of 2013) 9 wins in the famous French classic.

In 1997, Johansson founded a successful Indy Lights team running Fredrik Larsson and Jeff Ward; in 1998 its drivers were Guy Smith and Luiz Garcia Jr.; for 1999 the seats went to Scott Dixon and Ben Collins.

During 1998 and 1999, Johansson raced for various sports car teams (like the unreliable Audi R8C Coupé at Le Mans) but in 2000 he started Johansson-Matthews racing with an American businessman called Jim Matthews. They competed in the American Le Mans Series using a Reynard 2KQ prototype. Unfortunately this wasn&#x27;t a successful vehicle in its original form (though it was later developed into various other successful cars including the Zytek that he later raced) and the partnership dissolved.

In 2001, Johansson campaigned an Audi R8 prototype with backing from Gulf Oil and the assistance of Mike Earle&#x27;s Arena team. That year he raced in the European Le Mans Series, the American Le Mans Series and at Le Mans itself. His co-drivers were Guy Smith and Patrick Lemarie. At Le Mans Smith was replaced by Tom Coronel.

2002 saw Johansson back in an Audi R8 but this time one run by the Miami based Champion Racing team. His co-driver was ex Formula One driver Johnny Herbert and they competed in the American Le Mans Series.

For 2003, he returned to CART as a team owner, running American Spirit Team Johansson with Jimmy Vasser and Ryan Hunter-Reay as drivers. This was one of many new teams for the 2003 CART season; ironically, Bachelart&#x27;s Mi-Jack Conquest Racing team was another. The team was under-funded, and although Hunter-Reay scored a fluke win in the wet conditions at Australia, it folded at the end of the season.

After only competing in a couple of celebrity races and occasional outings in the works Zytek in 2004 Johansson returned to full-time racing in 2005 driving the Chip Ganassi run New Century Mortgage sponsored &quot;Lexus Riley Daytona Prototype&quot; in the American &quot;Grand-Am Rolex Sports Car Series&quot;. With co-driver Cort Wagner he scored his best finish, a second place, at Mont Tremblant in Canada, they finished the year in fifth place in the championship.

In 2006 as well as the Grand Prix Masters series, Johansson has made occasional appearances in Grand-Am for the Cheever and CITGO teams, and has continued an association with the works Zytek team in the Le Mans Series.

2007 saw Johansson competing in a Highcroft Racing Courage-Acura in the LMP2 class of the American Le Mans Series, sharing with David Brabham. He was due to race a Zytek at Le Mans in 2007, but the team could not rebuild the car in time after a test-day accident, and Johansson made a last minute deal to drive a works Courage.

Johansson took part in the inaugural Speedcar Series in 2008, where luck once again deserted him as the victim of a lot of other drivers&#x27; accidents. For 2008 Johansson did not have a full-time sports car drive, but had some outings planned in the Highcroft Acura ARX-01 in the ALMS and a place with the Epsilon Euskadi team at Le Mans.

Outside the cockpit, Johansson has a number of business ventures (including managing several successful drivers such as Scott Dixon) and is a keen artist – he is particularly known for his watch designs. Also, Johansson does expert commentary on Viasat Motor during Formula One races on occasion.

In 2011, he raced a Pescarolo-Judd in the Petit Le Mans 10 Hours and a Ford GT3 in the Malaysian 12 Hours at Sepang.

In 2012, he returned to the 24 Hours of Le Mans, racing a Lola B12/80.

==Driver management==
He is the manager of several racing drivers, including New Zealander Scott Dixon, fellow Swede Felix Rosenqvist (winner of the 2015 European Formula 3 Championship), Canadian Zachary Claman DeMelo, Romain Grosjean and Ed Jones.

==In popular culture==

Johansson was the inspiration for the song &quot;Speedway at Nazareth&quot; by Mark Knopfler.

<text>Stefano Modena (born 12 May 1963) is an Italian former racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . 

Born and raised in Modena, Modena began his career in kart racing. After winning the junior direct-drive Karting World Cup in 1978, as well as back-to-back direct-drive European Championships in 1983 and 1984, Modena progressed to Italian Formula Three in 1985. Following several race victories the next season—and taking pole position at the Macau Grand Prix—Modena moved to International Formula 3000 in 1987, winning the championship in his debut season. He participated in 81 Formula One Grands Prix for Brabham, EuroBrun, Tyrrell, Jordan, debuting at the 1987 Australian Grand Prix. Modena achieved two podiums and 17 championship points across six seasons.

==Career==
Stefano Modena was born on 12 May 1963 in Modena, Emilia-Romagna, Italy. A former 125cc Junior Karting Champion in Italy, he spent two seasons in the Italian Formula Ford national series before joining Euroracing in his domestic Formula 3 series in 1985, placing 15th in an Alfa Romeo engined Ralt. For 1986 he switched to Team Seresina&#x27;s Reynard chassis and scored three wins to finish 4th overall, also placing 2nd at the Monaco support race and winning a round of the European series at Imola. In 1987 he joined Onyx for the Formula 3000 series, winning three rounds and being crowned as champion.

His raw speed saw many mark him as a future champion, resulting in Modena being offered a one-off drive for Brabham in the final race of the 1987 Formula One season. While he impressed by qualifying 15th at the 1987 Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide, his inexperience with the turbo charged BMW engine saw him stop three times to replace flat-spotted tyres before retiring with exhaustion before mid-distance. Modena was intent on becoming a full-time Grand Prix driver for 1988, testing for Benetton before the season. However, for a full-time drive he had to join the new EuroBrun team, who included many of the same Euroracing mechanics Modena had worked with in 1985. The EuroBrun ER188 with its 3.5 litre Ford Cosworth V8 engine was not competitive however, and Modena was consigned to run near the rear of the field for the year. He did however prove to be faster than his teammate, fellow F1 rookie and former Brun Motorsport sportscar driver, Argentina&#x27;s Oscar Larrauri.

1989 saw Brabham reform after a sabbatical in 1988, now owned by Swiss businessman Joachim Luthi (who had bought the team from Walter Brun, the owner of EuroBrun), but featuring a lot of the same staff as in 1987. Modena was offered one of the seats, driving alongside Martin Brundle. Equipped with Pirelli qualifying tyres Modena frequently qualified well, starting inside the top 10 on eight occasions despite using the Judd V8 engine. However, the car wasn&#x27;t reliable - though Modena&#x27;s sole points finish would come with his 3rd place at the Monaco Grand Prix, his first of two F1 podiums. Before the 1990 season Luthi would be imprisoned for fraud and Brabham endured a difficult year with ownership problems. Modena raised the team&#x27;s spirits by finishing 5th at the season-opening United States Grand Prix but after that results were rare.

He finally got his big break in 1991 when he was signed as replacement for Ferrari-bound Tyrrell team leader Jean Alesi. With a healthy group of sponsors, 1990 spec Honda engines, Pirelli tyres and a development of the successful 020 chassis much was expected of the combination, with some predicting race wins. While his season started off with 4th place at Phoenix many of the front runners had retired without Modena getting near them. The wet conditions at Imola saw similar attrition allowing Modena to reach 3rd place before transmission failure. The following race at Monaco saw an even better performance as he qualified on the front row alongside his friend and World Champion Ayrton Senna, harrying the McLaren driver until being held up in traffic and suffering a violent engine failure. A steadier run in Canada was rewarded with 2nd place after Nigel Mansell retired on the final lap. After that Modena&#x27;s form dropped off badly as Pirelli struggled to develop a consistent race tyre while the heavy Honda engines made the 020 chassis (originally designed for the Cosworth DFR V8) difficult to balance. While Modena continued to qualify frequently in the top half of the grid he struggled in races, only scoring one more point for 6th place at the Japanese Grand Prix.

The season was considered a huge disappointment, and Modena left Tyrrell for Jordan the following season. The team had made a strong debut in 1991 and many considered Modena was lucky to land a drive with them. However, their car was hindered by the underpowered Yamaha V12 engine and Modena struggled all season. He failed to qualify for four races and became unpopular with his team for his lack of mechanical sympathy and moody behaviour compared to teammate Maurício Gugelmin. This was confirmed by Gary Anderson, who had designed the 1992 car. Anderson said of Modena that the failures to qualify took his motivation away from him, and, due to his temper, he accumulated disappointments without being able to get over them. Despite scoring the team&#x27;s only point of the year at the final round in Australia he was unable to find a drive in Grand Prix racing for 1993.

Modena drove instead for Alfa Romeo in the Italian and German touring categories from 1993 to 1999, winning occasional races but never looking like a serious contender for the title. After a year with Opel in 2000, he retired from motorsport.

After retiring he participated to some twenty-four hours karting races and in 2003 he was hired by Bridgestone, to test first racing tires and then road tires. Over the years he has conducted hundreds of tests in every geographical and climatic condition, including France, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Germany, Poland, Belgium and Japan. Always for the Asian company he dedicated himself to the promotion, marketing and development of new road tires, travelling to Turkey, Indonesia, Thailand, New Zealand, the United States and Dubai.

Since the late nineties he has been living permanently in Rome with his wife and former actress Sveva Altieri, with whom he had two children: Ascanio, an archaeologist and journalist, and Vittoria, a jurisconsult.

Modena was known for being an eccentric character with bizarre habits verging on the obsessive, including not wanting to have his car parked on the left side of the team garage, and not allowing anyone to touch his race car once he was inside other than the team member who helped him with his safety belts. During his F1 career it was not unusual to see Modena get out of his car after being strapped and get back in before the warm-up lap if he had seen someone else touch the car. Modena was also known to race with his gloves inside out. However, as he has claimed, this wasn&#x27;t due to superstition.

<text>Piercarlo Ghinzani (born 16 January 1952) is an Italian former racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to .

Ghinzani participated in 111 Formula One Grands Prix for Osella, Toleman, Ligier and Zakspeed, debuting at the 1981 Belgian Grand Prix. He scored his only points finish at the 1984 Dallas Grand Prix with Osella, where he finished fifth. Ghinzani entered four editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans from to with Lancia, but retired with mechanical faults in each.

Upon retiring from motor racing, Ghinzani founded the eponymous racing team Team Ghinzani in 1992, which has since competed in A1 Grand Prix as &quot;A1 Team Italy&quot; from 2005 to 2009, as well as in several national and continental Formula Three championships.

==Early career==
Ghinzani started his racing career in Formula Ford. He then graduated to Formula Three, racing with the Allegrini Team. In 1976 he switched to Team Euroracing, and won the European Championship in 1977, giving March, who was supplying the chassis, its first European Formula Three title. In 1979 he won the Italian Championship. He also had a one-off in Formula 2 in 1978, finishing fourth at Pergusa on a March-BMW, and in 1979 tried to qualify the Dywa at the Monza round of the 1980 British Formula One Championship.

==Formula One==
Ghinzani debuted in Formula One on 17 May at the 1981 Belgian Grand Prix at Zolder, when Enzo Osella asked him to replace the injured Miguel Angel Guerra. In Ghinzani was invited to test for Tyrrell. Despite lapping faster than Michele Alboreto, Danny Sullivan, Chico Serra and Stefan Johansson, Ken Tyrrell deciced to retain Alboreto and Sullivan, and Ghinzani signed with Osella for his first full Formula One season. Despite achieving no points finishes, Ghinzani stayed with the team for . After qualifying 20th for the second race of the season at Kyalami in South Africa, he crashed in the morning warm-up at high speed through the Jukskei Sweep. His Osella hit the wall and with almost a full fuel load of 220 litres, went up in flames and he suffered burns to his hands and face that kept him out of the race. He recovered to score his first and only career points when he finished fifth at the 1984 Dallas Grand Prix in a race marked by high attrition, crumbling tarmac and oppressive heat.

After beginning with Osella, halfway through the season Ghinzani was hired by the Toleman team to partner fellow Italian Teo Fabi. Although the car at times displayed flashes of competitiveness (Fabi managed to qualify on pole in Germany), it was marred by unreliability problems, and both drivers were forced to retire for the rest of the season. In he returned to Osella, but his second stint with the team, which was running a turbocharged Alfa Romeo V8 engine, was unsuccessful.

For Ghinzani was contracted to the Ligier team, alongside former Grand Prix winner René Arnoux. The team planned to run the new turbocharged 4 cylinder Alfa Romeo engines, but those plans were scuppered by Arnoux&#x27;s scathing pre-season comments that likened the engine to dog food, leading Alfa&#x27;s parent company Fiat to pull the plug on the engine project. This forced the team to hastily adapt their cars to fit Megatron engines. (The Megatron was actually the BMW engine used by Brabham and previously by Arrows and Benetton before BMW retired from the sport). However, while both the Alfa and Megatron were 4-cylinder engines, their respective plumbing was completely different, forcing the team to miss the opening race of the season in Brazil while the rear suspension was re-designed to fit the new engine. Ghinzani occasionally ran in the points for Ligier, notably in Germany, before being forced to retire. During qualifying for the British Grand Prix, Ghinzani&#x27;s Ligier ran out of fuel in front of the pits. His mechanics jumped the pit wall, refuelled him on the track and then push-started him, a clear violation of the rules leading to Ghinzani&#x27;s exclusion from the remainder of the event. Before the incident, the Italian had set a time which would have put him 19th on the grid.

In Ghinzani drove for the German Zakspeed team, which ran its own 4 cylinder turbo engine, though generally without success. His best finish for the year was 14th in the German Grand Prix at a wet Hockenheim. Despite being one of the few teams to use turbo powered engines in 1988, Ghinzani and his teammate, young German Bernd Schneider, struggled to qualify for races and were often slower than the atmospheric cars.

Ghinzani&#x27;s final Formula One season was , where he once again raced with Osella as teammate to young Italian driver Nicola Larini. Ghinzani announced his decision to retire from Grand Prix racing before official practice of the final race of the 1989 season in Australia. He had qualified 21st, but his race ended when his Osella was hit from behind by the Lotus of triple World Champion Nelson Piquet on lap 19. 

Ghinzani holds the record for the most Formula One appearances without qualifying in the top ten. 
==Sports cars==
In 1982 Ghinzani drove for the Lancia Sports car racing team, winning a Group C World Championship event with Michele Alboreto at Mugello in 1982. He competed at the 24 Hours of Le Mans four times between 1980 and 1983 but failed to finish on all occasions.

==Team Ghinzani==
In 1992 Ghinzani founded Team Ghinzani. The team Ghinzani have raced in Italian, German and Formula 3 Euro Series since 2000 and also entered Italian Formula 3000/Euro Formula 3000 between 1999 and 2002. Since 2005–06 season, the outfit has managed A1 Team Italy in collaboration with Arco Motorsport, in the A1 Grand Prix series.

<text>Pedro Paulo Falleiros dos Santos Diniz (; born 22 May 1970) is a Brazilian former racing driver, businessman and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . 

Born and raised in São Paulo, Diniz began karting aged 18 and achieved minor success, before progressing to car racing in the Brazilian Formula Ford Championship and the British Formula 3 Championship. He first drove in Formula One with Forti for the 1995 season. The following year he switched to Ligier and moved to Arrows for 1997. In 1998, he finished 14th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, and subsequently moved to Sauber for 1999. He left Sauber after the 2000 season and bought a share in the Prost team, which folded a year later. Diniz was considered a pay driver during his career due to his family backing. He scored 10 championship points during his six-year Formula One career.

Since leaving motorsport, Diniz founded the Formula Renault 2.0 Brazil Championship which he ran from 2002 and 2006, later becoming a partner in Pão de Açúcar and operates an organic produce and dairy farm alongside his wife Tatiana Diniz. He is a board member of Food Tank, a non-profit organization that spotlights environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable ways of alleviating hunger, obesity, and poverty and works to create networks of people, organizations, and content to push for food system change.

==Early life and career==
Diniz was born in São Paulo, Brazil, on 22 May 1970. His father was Abílio dos Santos Diniz, a businessman who used to own the Brazilian distribution chain Companhia Brasileira de Distribuição and the supermarket chain Pão de Açúcar. Diniz struggled to find a good education and went to several schools around the local area.

Diniz began karting at the age of eighteen, and his career was funded by his father who supported his son&#x27;s hobby. He competed in several events around Brazil and his first racing success came when he won the Two Hours of São Paulo. Aged 19, Diniz moved up into car racing, competing in the Brazilian Formula Ford championship, where he finished ninth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. In 1990, Diniz moved to the Reyanud Alfa team and finished ninth overall, with his best performances being a podium position at Interlagos.

For 1991, Diniz moved to the British Formula 3 with the West Surrey Racing team, finishing 11th overall. He moved to the Edenbridge Racing team in 1992, driving a Reynard Mugen and took two podiums en route to eighth place overall.

==Formula One career==

===Forti (1995)===

Diniz entered Formula One, the highest category of circuit racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA), motorsport&#x27;s world governing body, with the Forti team, as team-mate to Roberto Moreno in 1995. In addition, this was the first of a three-year contract with Diniz and his backers. Despite his lack of success in F3000, he was guaranteed a seat as his family and sponsors were paying a significant amount of the team&#x27;s budget. Furthermore, retired driver René Arnoux was employed as a consultant and driver coach for Diniz. The season started with Diniz scoring three consecutive finishes, albeit outside of the points scoring positions—but was not classified for the races in Argentina and San Marino. He did not finish the next race in Spain due to a gearbox problem and finished tenth in Monaco. Diniz retired from the next five races he entered, primarily from car issues and spun off into retirement at Magny-Cours. He subsequently finished every remaining race of the season, apart from the Grand Prix held at Suzuka where he spun off. He finished the season scoring no points and was unclassified in the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Diniz&#x27;s good finishing record enabled him to establish himself as a steady, dependable driver. In December, Diniz signed for the Ligier team for 1996, despite team owner Tom Walkinshaw initially refusing to hold talks with the Brazilian driver. Ligier eventually signed Diniz after a shootout test session against other drivers in which Diniz was the fastest, also impressing the team with his approach and technical feedback. At the end of the season, Diniz and his sponsors were described as &quot;throwing their money away&quot; on the uncompetitive Forti. But the more significant impact of his first year in F1 was that the Brazilian had done nothing to assuage critics who had said he was a &quot;pay driver&quot;. It took him several years to prove that he was not just in the sport because of his funding.

===Ligier (1996)===
Diniz started the season by finishing outside of the points in the opening two races—tenth in Australia and eighth in Brazil. At the Argentine Grand Prix, his car burst into flames after a pit-stop due to its fuel valve sticking open; British newspaper The Sun famously printed the photo alongside the headline &quot;Diniz in the Oven&quot;. After failing to finish at Monaco, a race which his teammate Panis won, Diniz scored his first career point with a sixth-place finish at Catalunya. Six straight retirements followed before he scored another sixth-place finish at Monza. Following his poor season with Forti in 1995 little was expected of him for 1996, so there was mild surprise when he managed to out-qualify the better rated Panis at Hockenheim and establish himself as a driver capable of scoring points.
He finished the season 15th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with two points, six places and 11 points behind Panis.

After the season concluded, it was announced that Diniz would leave Ligier for the Arrows team for 1997, partnering reigning World Champion Damon Hill. An important factor was the amount of sponsorship Diniz brought to Arrows, estimated to be worth $13 million.

===Arrows (1997–98)===
;1997
For 1997, Diniz was confident heading into the season and his decision to join Arrows, saying: &quot;The all-round strength of the package Tom [Walkinshaw] has put together for 1997 made the decision very easy for me&quot;. Diniz started his season with a finish in Australia (although he was given dispensation to start despite falling outside the 107% qualifying time) and later suffered from consecutive retirements in the next five races. He managed to finish eighth in Canada, before picking up further consecutive retirements in the next four races. Diniz managed to secure a seventh-place finish in Belgium, however he had been running in an excellent third place before a problem at his first pit stop dropped him out of contention. Diniz suffering a further retirement in Italy, however he managed to secure finishes in the next three consecutive races, which included a points scoring finish at the Luxembourg Grand Prix and retired from the final race of the season at the European Grand Prix. Diniz&#x27;s reputation grew throughout the season from a mere pay driver to a genuine racing driver, he managed to out-qualify teammate Hill in Belgium and Japan, two of the most technically challenging tracks on the calendar, also having a number of strong race performances. In October, Arrows announced that Diniz had signed a one-year extension to his contract, remaining with the team for 1998. Diniz finished the season in sixteenth place in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, with two points, and finished four places behind team-mate Hill.

;1998
Diniz remained at Arrows for 1998, partnered by Mika Salo. Diniz endured a torrid start: his car suffered gearbox problems in the opening three rounds and endured engine failures in the races at San Marino and Spain. He scored his first point of the season with a sixth-place finish in Monaco and managed to finish the races in Canada and France. Diniz suffered three more consecutive retirements, and finished the races in Hungary and Belgium, in eleventh and fifth respectively. Diniz finished the season by retiring in the final three races. He finished 14th in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, and was tied on points with team-mate Salo.

At the end of the season, Diniz became embroiled in a contract dispute. On 12 October, Diniz chose to leave Arrows and signed a contract to join Sauber, having been previously linked to a seat at BAR. Arrows, however, insisted that they had the right to exercise their option to keep Diniz. Diniz argued that the Arrows option contained a clause allowing him to leave if Arrows did not deliver performances required by the driver. The dispute went to Formula One&#x27;s Contract Recognition Board, who ruled in favour of Diniz on 22 February. Arrows later sued Diniz for £4 million, for breach of contract. The case was later heard by the Commercial High Court in London in February 2001 and ruled that Arrows owner Tom Walkinshaw pay Diniz £500,000 in compensation. Arrows later applied for an appeal against the decision, and the Court of Appeal ruled in Diniz&#x27;s favour in February 2002.

===Sauber (1999–2000)===
;1999
For 1999, Diniz partnered experienced driver Jean Alesi at Sauber. He endured a torrid start: He was forced into retirement in the first five races held in the season; and in the sixth race of the season held in Canada, he managed to score his first point of the season with a sixth-place finish. Diniz suffered a retirement at the next round in France, before clinching consecutive sixth-place finishes in the next two races and later suffered further consecutive retirements in the following six races. In late August, it was announced that Diniz would remain at Sauber for 2000. At the European Grand Prix, Diniz was hit by Benetton driver Alexander Wurz who sent the Sauber driver into a barrel roll and suffered a bruised knee and shoulder, resulting from his car&#x27;s roll hoop becoming damaged. The season was somewhat of a disappointment for both the team and the driver, however although Diniz only finished four races all season he scored points in three of them. Diniz finished the season fourteenth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship and scored three points.

;2000

For 2000, Diniz again competed with Sauber and was partnered with Mika Salo. Team principal Peter Sauber stated Diniz and Salo would have equal status and that the former would use his experience over the upcoming season.

Diniz started off the season by retiring with transmission problems in Australia. He, along with Salo, were forced to withdraw from the Brazilian Grand Prix due to potentially dangerous wing failures during the weekend. He managed to finish in the next two races—eighth in San Marino and eleventh at the British Grand Prix—which was followed by a retirement at the Spanish Grand Prix due to a spin on the first lap. He was involved in a collision with Giancarlo Fisichella&#x27;s Benetton in Austria for which he received a stop-go penalty, and in Germany, Diniz collided with Prost driver Jean Alesi forcing both drivers to retire. Diniz finished the year scoring no points and was unclassified in the Drivers&#x27; Championship.

Diniz became unhappy at Sauber over a test session shoot out at Mugello against fellow countryman Enrique Bernoldi. He held talks with the Prost and Sauber teams during October, and could not find a race seat with either team. Diniz decided to withdraw from active motorsport and his family purchased a 40 percent stake of the Prost team for $10 million and took a management role within the team.

== Post-Formula One ==
In late 2001, the Diniz family sought to purchase the remaining stake in the Prost team, but negotiations with team principal Alain Prost resulted in no agreement. Diniz formally left the team in November as his relationship with Prost had deteriorated.

Diniz announced the creation of a new racing series, the Formula Renault 2.0 Brazil Championship in November 2001. Diniz was a partner of the Wonder Inn, Fernando de Noronha between July 2003 and May 2009. He subsequently became a partner in his father&#x27;s supermarket chain and operates an organic produce and dairy farm. He married Tatiana who works alongside Diniz and has two children.

Alongside his organic produce farm, Diniz founded Instituto Toca, a non-profit school and research initiative for sustainability. He is currently on the board of Peninsula Participações.

<text>Patrick André Eugène Joseph Depailler (; 9 August 1944 – 1 August 1980) was a French racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Depailler won two Formula One Grands Prix across eight seasons.

Depailler was born in Clermont-Ferrand, Puy-de-Dôme. As a child, he was inspired by Jean Behra. In Formula One, he joined a Tyrrell team that was beginning a long, slow decline, eventually moving to the erratic Ligier team before finally ending up with the revived Alfa Romeo squad in 1980. 

In August 1980, Depailler was killed during a private testing session at the Hockenheimring. He achieved two wins, one pole position, four fastest laps and 19 podiums in Formula One. Depailler holds the joint-record for the most podiums before winning a Grand Prix (15).

==Sports cars and Formula Two==
Depailler finished 0.9 seconds behind Peter Gethin in the 1972 Formula Two Pau Grand Prix. He battled Gethin closely
in a March 722 over the 70-lap course which curved through the French city. Both drivers lapped the field twice. Depailler came in 3rd in an April 1973 Formula Two race at the Nürburgring. He was driving a Ford Alpine. In May 1974 Depailler qualified his March in 1st position in qualifying for the Formula Two Pau Grand Prix. In June he crashed his March 742 through a guard rail during time trials for a Formula Two race in Salzburgring. Depailler was uninjured but qualifying was stopped so that workmen could replace a section of railing which was torn off in the accident.

In April 1976 the Renault sports car team suspended Depailler for three races after he was involved in a crash which knocked out both his car and the Renault of teammate Jean-Pierre Jabouille. The incident occurred on the second turn, slightly more than a mile after the beginning of a race at the Nürburgring. Depailler lost control and crashed, after which Jabouille also crashed while attempting to avoid his teammate. The drivers had been instructed not to contest the lead with each other. Depailler placed 2nd in the 1976 Swedish Formula One Grand Prix. He was 19 seconds behind winner Jody Scheckter. Depailler drove in the
International Race of Champions event at Riverside International Raceway in September 1978. He was behind the wheel of the Paul Newman entered Spyder-Chevy in the October 1978 California Grand Prix.

==Formula One==

===Tyrrell (1972–1978)===
Tyrrell had given Depailler drives at France and Watkins Glen in 1972. Using one of the older cars, Depailler had finished in seventh place in the latter race. So in December 1973 Depailler was chosen with Scheckter to drive for Tyrrell, to replace the deceased François Cevert and retired Jackie Stewart. Depailler captured the pole for the 1974 Swedish Grand Prix, his 9th race as a Formula One driver. He negotiated the Anderstorp course in a time of 1 minute, 24.758 seconds, for an average speed of 105.8 miles per hour. Depailler would finish 2nd in the race behind teammate Jody Scheckter; this proved his only podium of the year.

In January 1975 Depailler was given 25–1 odds of becoming the 1975 Formula One World Champion. He finished 5th in the 1975 Argentine Grand Prix in Buenos Aires. He took 3rd at Kyalami in the 1975 South African Grand Prix. Depailler stayed behind 2nd-place finisher, Carlos Reutemann, throughout the 78 laps of the event. On the first day of qualifying for the 1975 United States Grand Prix, Depailler crashed his Tyrrell into a catch fence at Watkins Glen. He was not injured.

Depailler came in 2nd in the 1976 Brazilian Grand Prix at Interlagos. He ended up 2nd to Clay Regazzoni on the 2nd day of qualifying, with a speed of . Depailler gained a 3rd-place finish but drew the ire of rival James Hunt, who went out on the 4th lap. Hunt claimed that Depailler forced him off the track and shook his fist at him after his exit from the race. Depailler, who wrestled with brake trouble, claimed that he did not see the English driver in his mirrors. Depailler placed his six-wheeled Tyrrell in 3rd position for the start of the 1976 Monaco Grand Prix. The Tyrrells of Scheckter and Depailler were the only cars able to stay on the same lap with Lauda&#x27;s Ferrari, who won from pole position. Depailler was 2nd to Hunt in the 1976 French Grand Prix at Le Castellet. Hunt held off a determined Depailler at Mosport Park in the 1976 Canadian Grand Prix. Both drivers were ill at the conclusion of the event, with Depailler having inhaled fumes over the last third of the race. He lost consciousness after pulling his car off at the first corner following the finish. He regained consciousness momentarily. Depailler finished 2nd ahead of Hunt (who nevertheless secured the 1976 Drivers&#x27; Championship by finishing third) at the 1976 Japanese Grand Prix, despite encountering tyre problems as the Fuji Speedway track dried from heavy rains.

He skidded off the Interlagos track at São Paulo during the 1977 Brazilian Grand Prix. He was hospitalized with a leg injury. Depailler qualified in the 6th row, 12th position, for the 1977 United States Grand Prix West. In December 1977 Depailler was promoted to the number one driver for Tyrrell, when Ronnie Peterson left to drive for
Lotus. At the same time Tyrrell revealed that it was quitting its experiment with six-wheeled Formula One cars.

Depailler was 3rd in the 1978 Argentine Grand Prix in an Elf-Tyrrell. Peterson passed Depailler on the last turn of the last lap at Kyalami, to claim the 1978 South African Grand Prix. Depailler&#x27;s car was running short of fuel, allowing Peterson to erase a 9-second gap to win.
Depailler climbed from 12th starting place to end in 3rd position in the 1978 United States Grand Prix West. Depailler gained his first Formula One triumph by winning the 1978 Monaco Grand Prix.
Piloting a Tyrrell-Ford 008, Depailler secured the 36th annual event. It was his first victory in 69 championship races, although he had been 2nd eight times.

===Ligier (1979)===

Depailler switched to the Ligier team for 1979. The team began to field cars with V-8 Ford Cosworth engines, rather than the French-built Matra V-12 engines of 1978. Depailler led the first 10 laps before his engine experienced problems in the 1979 Argentine Grand Prix. He was forced to make a pit stop but managed a 4th-place finish.
Depailler came in 2nd to his victorious teammate, Jacques Laffite, in the 1979 Brazilian Grand Prix. Laffite was more than 5 seconds ahead at the end of the race. Depailler made contact with the fence at &quot;Barbecue Bend&quot; in the 1979 South African Grand Prix.

Ligier team manager, Gerard Ducarouge, said that the Ligier JS-11 had been in the planning stages for some time. The JS-9 had been tested as a &quot;wing car&quot; following the 1978 United States Grand Prix West, but the wind tunnel tests proved unsatisfactory. The JS-11 was built and tested in December 1978, with positive results. The V-8 engine was lighter and the Cosworth exhaust system was modified so that it sounded much the same as the old Matra engine&#x27;s distinctive whine. The new body features of the JS-11 were revealed at the 1979 United States Grand Prix West.

Depailler posted a flag-to-flag win at Jarama in the 1979 Spanish Grand Prix. The win enabled him to tie Gilles Villeneuve in the standings for the Formula One world championship at the end of April, with 20 points each. Depailler posted a third position in qualifying for the 1979 Monaco Grand Prix on a staggered grid. Depailler was replaced in June 1979 by Ligier, after breaking both legs in a hang gliding incident on 3 June near his hometown of Clermont-Ferrand. His heel was also critically injured. The race team was receiving financial support from the French government, which specified that his replacement also be French; his replacement was the French-speaking Belgian veteran Jacky Ickx.

He had been healing well when he fell out of his hospital bed in early August, rebreaking one of the fractures. On 29 August, Depailler said that he was &quot;resigned not to race again until next year&quot;, although he expected to leave his Paris hospital by the end of the week. He had undergone a number of operations on his legs, but had hopes to attend both autumn North American rounds, at Montreal and the Watkins Glen, as a spectator.

===Alfa Romeo (1980)===

In 1980, Depailler joined the newly formed Alfa Romeo team, that was on a comeback trail: Depailler had worked his way back from his hang-gliding accident the previous year, and had equipped his car with special brakes designed to toughen his leg muscles, he was still driving in pain by the time of his fatal accident and the car was fast (he qualified 3rd for the 1980 United States Grand Prix West) but not reliable enough to finish.

== Death ==
Depailler suffered a fatal accident whilst testing at Hockenheim ten days prior to the 1980 German Grand Prix when a suspension failure pitched his Alfa Romeo 179 into the Armco barrier at the high-speed &quot;Ostkurve&quot;, inflicting fatal head injuries when the vehicle overturned and vaulted the barrier. The car skidded along the top of the guard rail for several hundred feet prior to flipping onto its top.

==Legacy==
A radio-controlled car racing circuit is named in honour of Depailler at his home town. The Mini Circuit Patrick Depailler is one of the oldest tracks in France and was used to host an International Federation of Model Auto Racing (IFMAR) meeting in 1999.

As a result of his fatal accident, a new chicane was built into the Ostkurve at the Hockenheim circuit in order to slow the cars down - previously it had been a flat out curving right hander. The new Ostkurve Schikane was first used during the 1982 German Grand Prix.

Depailler was portrayed by Xavier Laurent in the 2013 film &quot;Rush&quot;, directed by Ron Howard.

<doc id="1226336" wikidata="Q2661817" url="?curid=1226336" title="Amitābha Sūtra">
<text>The Amitābha Sūtra (Ch.: 阿彌陀經, pinyin: &quot;Āmítuó Jīng&quot;, or 佛說阿彌陀經, &quot;Fóshuō Āmítuójīng&quot;; Jp.: &quot;Amida Kyō&quot;, Vi.: &quot;A Di Đà Kinh&quot;), also known as the [Shorter] Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra (Sanskrit, &quot;The Array of &quot;the Blissful&quot; &quot;Land&quot;&quot;, or &quot;The Arrangement of Sukhāvatī&quot;) is one of the two Indian Mahayana sutras that describe Sukhāvatī, the pure land of Amitābha. The text was translated into Chinese in 402 by Kumārajīva (Taishō Tripiṭaka no. 366) and it is also known in Chinese as the &quot;Small Sutra&quot; (&quot;Xiaojing&quot;). 

The &quot;Amitābha Sūtra&quot; is highly influential in East Asian Buddhism, including China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam since it is considered one of the &quot;Three Pure Land&quot; sutras which are the key scriptures in Pure Land Buddhism. 

==History==
The &quot;Amitābha Sūtra&quot; was translated from an Indic language into Classical Chinese by Tripiṭaka master Kumārajīva in 402. The original &quot;Sukhāvatīvyūha sutras&quot; may have existed in India as early as the first or second centuries CE (during the Kushan era). They may have been composed Gandhari or some other Prakrit language. A later translation of this sutra was completed by Xuanzang (602-664 C.E.), but it is not as widely used as Kumārajīva&#x27;s, which is the standard edition in the East Asian tradition. 

The sutra was commented on by numerous East Asian authors. The 7th century Pure Land patriarch Shandao commented on the sutra in his &quot;Fashizan&quot; 法事讚 (&quot;Praise for Dharma Rites&quot;), which focuses on the rites associated with the recitation of the sutra. It was also commented on by Sengzhao (384–414), Zhiyi (538–597 CE), Wohnyo, Huijing (578-645 CE) and Kuiji (632-682 CE). 

The work of these figures raised the status of the &quot;Amitābha Sūtra&quot;, and it became a central text in Chinese Buddhism. Today, it remains very popular sutra in East Asian Buddhism. Its short length has also contributed to it becoming a widely chanted sutra in Buddhist temples and monasteries.

Later Chinese figures continued to comment on the sutra. During the Song dynasty, Yuanzhao (Chinese: 元照, 1048–1116) composed a commentary that draws on the various views found in Tiantai and in Shandao. Later in the Ming dynasty, Yunqi Zhuhong (1535–1615) composed a commentary which explains the sutra from the perspective of Huayan&#x27;s teaching of principle and phenomena. Another Ming era commentary by Ouyi Zhixu (1599–1655) has been translated into English as &quot;Mind Seal of the Buddhas&quot; by J.C. Cleary. A study of both the &quot;Amitabha&quot; and the &quot;Amitayus&quot; sutras (known as the &quot;longer&quot; &quot;Sukhāvatīvyūha&quot; in Sanskrit) was published by Luis O. Gomez in 1996.

In Japan, Hōnen also commented on the work along with the other Pure Land sutras. The influential Japanese Pure Land thinker Shinran (1173- 1263) also wrote a series of notes and marginalia to a copy of the sutra, which is now known as the &quot;Amida-kyō chū&quot; (阿弥陀経註). 

==Content==

The bulk of the &quot;Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot;, considerably shorter than other Pure Land sutras, consists of a discourse that Gautama Buddha gave at Jetavana in Śrāvastī to his disciple Śāriputra. The teaching concerns the wonderful adornments and features found in the buddhafield (or &quot;pure land&quot;) of Sukhāvatī (&quot;the Blissful&quot;), including jeweled ponds, colorful jeweled lotuses, raining flowers, jeweled trees that make Dharma sounds, and so on. It also discusses the beings that reside there, including the Buddha Amitābha (meaning &quot;Measureless Light&quot; or &quot;Boundless Radiance&quot;), who is said to be so called because &quot;the light of the Tathāgata Amitābha shines unimpeded throughout all buddha realms&quot;. 

The text also describes what one must do to be reborn in Sukhāvatī. In the sutra, Śākyamuni teaches that one must vow to be born in Sukhāvatī and single-mindedly focus on Buddha Amitābha, and then after death they will be reborn in the pure land. The key passage which describes these instructions states (translation from the Sanskrit edition):Moreover, O Śāriputra, beings should make vows towards that buddha-land. Why? Because, indeed, they come together with good people of such forms. O Śāriputra, beings do not arise in the buddha-land of Amitāyus Tathāgata by insignificant wholesome roots. O Śāriputra, whichever son of good family or daughter of good family, will hear the name of that bhagavān, Amitāyus Tathāgata, and having heard it will think of it, or will think of it with a mind that is undistracted for one night, or two nights, or three nights, or four nights, or five nights, or six nights, or seven nights, when that son of good family or daughter of good family will die, at their time of death, that Amitāyus Tathāgata, surrounded by a saṅgha of śrāvakas and headed by a chain of bodhisattvas will stand before them and they will die with an undisturbed mind. Having died, they will arise in the world system Sukvāvatī, the buddha-land of just that Amitāyus Tathāgata.  Therefore, then, O Śāriputra, seeing this intention, I thus say: a son of good family or a daughter of good family should devotedly make vows of aspiration towards that buddha-land. The Buddha then describes the various buddhas of the six directions and how they also teach the same teaching on rebirth in Sukhāvatī in their own buddhalands. Hence, the Buddha explains how an alternative title to this sutra is &quot;Embraced by all Buddhas&quot;, since all Buddhas expound the teaching of faith in the pure land.

The sutra ends with the Buddha stating that this teaching is actually very difficult to believe, calling it &quot;the most difficult of difficulties&quot; and &quot;the Dharma which is the most difficult to accept by all the world.&quot;

<text>Marc Surer (born 18 September 1951) is a Swiss former racing driver and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One from to .

Born in Arisdorf, Surer began kart racing aged 20. He moved to Germany in 1974 to compete in Formula Vee, as motor racing was banned in Switzerland following the 1955 Le Mans disaster. After finishing runner-up in the 1976 German Formula Three Championship, Surer progressed to European Formula Two, winning the title in 1979 with the BMW Junior Team. Making his Formula One debut at the that year with Ensign, Surer signed for ATS in . He participated in 88 Formula One Grands Prix, scoring 17 championship points.

==Racing career==
Surer started his career in karting in 1972. Due to the racing ban established in Switzerland after the 1955 Le Mans disaster, he moved to Germany in 1974, where he finished second in the local Formula Vee Championship. In 1976, he switched to European Formula 3, where he was noticed by Jochen Neerpasch, who hired him as a member of the BMW Junior Team alongside Eddie Cheever and Manfred Winkelhock. In 1978, he finished second in the Formula 2 Championship, eventually winning the series the following year in a works March-BMW.

Surer&#x27;s debut in Formula 1 took place at the end of 1979 and was somewhat troubled. He broke his legs in qualifying at the South African Grand Prix in an ATS at Kyalami in 1980 and again racing there in 1981 for Ensign. He recovered to give Ensign their best result with a 4th-place finish at the 1981 Brazilian Grand Prix, also setting the fastest lap of the race. He later drove for Theodore before establishing himself at Arrows for a couple of seasons, until BMW&#x27;s support earned him a seat at Brabham for 1985. Surer returned to Arrows in 1986 but eventually retired from Formula One halfway through the season due to a serious accident at the 1986 ADAC Hessen-Rallye in his Ford RS200 that severely injured him and killed his co-driver and friend Michel Wyder. BMW retained him as a driver, coach and later director of motorsport activities. In 1994 and 1995, Surer, alongside Johnny Cecotto and Jo Winkelhock, won the German Super Touring Car Championship.

In 1996, Surer began working as a television commentator at all Formula 1 events for Sky Sport (Germany) (formerly known as &quot;DF1&quot; and &quot;Premiere&quot;) next to the lead commentator Jacques Schulz. After Schulz&#x27;s withdrawal prior to the 2013 season, he has remained as a commentator alongside Sascha Roos.

==Formula One all-time ranking==
In 2016, in an academic paper that reported a mathematical modeling study that assessed the relative influence of driver and machine, Surer was ranked the 17th best Formula One driver of all time.

==Personal life==
Surer has been married twice to former Playboy models, first to Playmate Jolanda Egger, and then to Christina Surer between 1997 and 2000. On 3 December 2011 he married his longtime partner Silvia Renée Arias.

==Racing record==

<doc id="1226339" wikidata="Q2306414" url="?curid=1226339" title="Internal transcribed spacer">
<text>Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) is the spacer DNA situated between the small-subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and large-subunit rRNA genes in the chromosome or the corresponding transcribed region in the polycistronic rRNA precursor transcript.

== Across life domains ==
In bacteria and archaea, there is a single ITS, located between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes. Conversely, there are two ITSs in eukaryotes: ITS1 is located between 18S and 5.8S rRNA genes, while ITS2 is between 5.8S and 28S (in opisthokonts, or 25S in plants) rRNA genes. ITS1 corresponds to the ITS in bacteria and archaea, while ITS2 originated as an insertion that interrupted the ancestral 23S rRNA gene.

== Organization ==
In bacteria and archaea, the ITS occurs in one to several copies, as do the flanking 16S and 23S genes. When there are multiple copies, these do not occur adjacent to one another. Rather, they occur in discrete locations in the circular chromosome. It is not uncommon in bacteria to carry tRNA genes in the ITS.

In eukaryotes, genes encoding ribosomal RNA and spacers occur in tandem repeats that are thousands of copies long, each separated by regions of non-transcribed DNA termed &quot;intergenic spacer&quot; (IGS) or &quot;non-transcribed spacer&quot; (NTS).

Each eukaryotic ribosomal cluster contains the 5&#x27; external transcribed spacer (5&#x27; ETS), the 18S rRNA gene, the ITS1, the 5.8S rRNA gene, the ITS2, the 26S or 28S rRNA gene, and finally the 3&#x27; ETS.

During rRNA maturation, ETS and ITS pieces are excised. As non-functional by-products of this maturation, they are rapidly degraded.

== Use in phylogenetic inference ==
Sequence comparison of the eukaryotic ITS regions is widely used in taxonomy and molecular phylogeny because of several favorable properties:
* It is routinely amplified thanks to its small size associated to the availability of highly conserved flanking sequences.
* It is easy to detect even from small quantities of DNA due to the high copy number of the rRNA clusters.
* It undergoes rapid concerted evolution via unequal crossing-over and gene conversion. This promotes intra-genomic homogeneity of the repeat units, although high-throughput sequencing showed the occurrence of frequent variations within plant species.
* It has a high degree of variation even between closely related species. This can be explained by the relatively low evolutionary pressure acting on such non-coding spacer sequences.

For example, ITS markers have proven especially useful for elucidating phylogenetic relationships among the following taxa.

ITS2 is known to be more conserved than ITS1 is. All ITS2 sequences share a common core of secondary structure, while ITS1 structures are only conserved in much smaller taxonomic units. Regardless of the scope of conservation, structure-assisted comparison can provide higher resolution and robustness.

=== Mycological barcoding ===

The ITS region is the most widely sequenced DNA region in molecular ecology of fungi and has been recommended as the universal fungal barcode sequence. It has typically been most useful for molecular systematics at the species to genus level, and even within species (e.g., to identify geographic races). Because of its higher degree of variation than other genic regions of rDNA (for example, small- and large-subunit rRNA), variation among individual rDNA repeats can sometimes be observed within both the ITS and IGS regions. In addition to the universal ITS1+ITS4 primers used by many labs, several taxon-specific primers have been described that allow selective amplification of fungal sequences (e.g., see Gardes &amp; Bruns 1993 paper describing amplification of basidiomycete ITS sequences from mycorrhiza samples). Despite shotgun sequencing methods becoming increasingly utilized in microbial sequencing, the low biomass of fungi in clinical samples make the ITS region amplification an area of ongoing research.

<doc id="1226340" wikidata="Q171515" url="?curid=1226340" title="Jonathan Palmer">
<text>Jonathan Charles Palmer (born 7 November 1956) is a British businessman and former Formula One racing driver. Before opting for a career in motor racing, Palmer trained as a physician at London&#x27;s Guy&#x27;s Hospital. He also worked as a junior physician at Cuckfield and Brighton hospitals.

He is currently the majority shareholder and Chief Executive of MotorSport Vision (MSV), a company that runs six UK motorsport circuits, the PalmerSport corporate driving event at Bedford Autodrome and several racing championships including British Superbikes and GB3.

Prior to his business life, Palmer was active in Formula One between 1983 and 1989, and drove for Tyrrell, Williams, RAM, and Zakspeed. He won 14 Championship points from 83 starts. He also raced a Group C Porsche in sports car events between 1983 and 1990, winning the 1984 1000 km of Brands Hatch with co-driver Jan Lammers and taking second place at the 1985 24 Hours of Le Mans with co-drivers James Weaver and Richard Lloyd.

Palmer helped develop the McLaren F1 road car, and drove one to a new speed record for production cars.

==Racing career==
===Early career===
Following his education at Brighton College, Palmer raced an Austin Healey Sprite and a Marcos in club events while he was a medical student at Guy&#x27;s Hospital. He went on to work as a doctor at Cuckfield and Brighton hospitals, and opted for a professional driving career after he had participated in Formula Ford from 1978 to 1980. He won the British Formula 3 Championship in 1981, and landed a Williams Formula One test drive in 1982. The following year he won the European Formula Two Championship, and the British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club awarded him their Gold Star.

===Formula One===

Palmer joined Williams as a test driver for the 1982 and 1983 seasons whilst racing in F2, and made his Formula One debut at Brands Hatch on 25 September 1983, driving a Williams in the European Grand Prix. This drive was a &#x27;thank you&#x27; from Frank Williams and Patrick Head. He finished 13th out of 26 starters. Moving to the Skoal Bandit RAM March team in 1984, his six finishes yielded one 8th place, three 9th, one 10th, and one 13th. He joined Zakspeed in 1985, starting in eight races and retiring from all except the 1985 Detroit Grand Prix, where he finished 11th. Sixteen starts with the same team in 1986 resulted in eight retirements and a best finish of 8th in Detroit. At his home race at Brands Hatch that year, Palmer used his qualified general practitioner skills to assist the extrication of Ligier driver Jacques Laffite after Laffite suffered a career-ending crash on the opening lap.

In 1987, Palmer talked with McLaren boss Ron Dennis about becoming the team&#x27;s No. 2 driver to double World Champion Alain Prost. Dennis ultimately signed Stefan Johansson, and Palmer joined Tyrrell a week before the season&#x27;s opening race in Brazil. Although outpaced by its turbocharged competitors, Tyrrell&#x27;s naturally-aspirated Cosworth-powered car proved reliable, and it was nimble on tighter circuits. Palmer won championship points in three races, and it was in the Australian Grand Prix that he achieved his career-best fourth-place finish. He also won the Jim Clark Cup, a championship for drivers of normally aspirated cars. He stayed with Tyrrell for the next two seasons, during which his best results were two 5th-place finishes and three 6th. At the end of 1989 he signed as McLaren&#x27;s test driver.

===Sportscars===
Between 1983 and 1990 Palmer competed in the World Sportscar Championship at the wheel of a Group C Porsche. With co-driver Jan Lammers he won the 1984 1000 km of Brands Hatch. At Le Mans, his best result from five starts was second place in 1985, with co-drivers James Weaver and Richard Lloyd.

===Post F1===
In 1991 Palmer came seventh in the British Touring Car Championship, driving a Prodrive BMW. Also that year he became a pit lane reporter for the BBC F1 commentary team. Following James Hunt&#x27;s death from a heart attack after the 1993 Canadian Grand Prix, Palmer joined the BBC commentary box alongside Murray Walker. At the end of 1996 the BBC lost the rights to broadcast F1, and in 1997 Palmer joined the CBC for its annual commentary on the Grand Prix of Canada.

===Road car development===
Palmer&#x27;s work with McLaren included development of the McLaren F1 road car, and he drove one to a record-breaking 231 mph at the Nardo test track.

==Business career==
PalmerSport was founded in 1991 to run corporate hospitality motorsport events. This was initially run from the Bruntingthorpe airfield in Leicestershire before the lease was acquired to develop the site now known as Bedford Autodrome.

Palmer opened the venue in 1999 as four separate circuits with a total of six miles of track, to become the permanent home for PalmerSport. The venue is also used for trackdays.

Palmer launched the Formula Palmer Audi Championship in 1998 as a less costly alternative to Formula 3. Inaugural champion Justin Wilson went on to win the Formula 3000 championship. With Palmer managing his career, an innovative share issue in Wilson helped him secure a Formula One drive with Minardi.

In 2004, Palmer, John Britten, and Sir Peter Ogden acquired the Brands Hatch, Oulton Park, Snetterton and Cadwell Park circuits from Octagon, under the umbrella of MotorSport Vision (MSV). The company has turned around the fortunes of each circuit, and implemented a programme of improvements at each venue to develop better facilities for spectators and circuit users. Snetterton in particular has been revitalised under MSV ownership, with the circuit undergoing a near total redesign in 2011, with several new corners allowing for three different circuit configurations, and the addition of large spectator viewing areas.

The company, with Palmer as Chief Executive, organised the Formula Palmer Audi Championship, acquired the commercial rights for the British Superbike Championship, and secured the right to operate the FIA Formula Two Championship from 2009 to 2012. It now runs the GB3 and GB4 Championships, as well as several other club series and championships under the MSVR banner.

In 2009, MSV acquired the freehold of 800 acres of the Bedford Autodrome site and opened Bedford Aerodrome as a CAA licensed airfield in 2010.

MSV completed the freehold purchase of a substantial former military airbase near Laon in north-east France in 2015, which is planned to be developed into a major international motorsports complex.

In 2017 MSV acquired the Donington Park motor racing circuit, and implemented a multi-million pound program of improvements at the East Midlands track including a new bar, cafe and restaurant, a new circuit office, extensive resurfacing of paddock areas and internal roads and a new grandstand with views of the track.

On 30 September 2022 it was announced that MSV won the bid for purchasing Circuito de Navarra in northern Spain. MSV has since completed the first phase of its programme of improvements involving a complete overhaul of the race control complex. This included new screens and upgraded CCTV technology, along with a complete exterior redecoration of the race control tower and main pit buildings, including all the garage doors. This exterior aesthetic overhaul has extended beyond that area too, elevating the FIA Grade 1T and Grade 2 circuit&#x27;s presentation to match its status as one of Spain&#x27;s best motorsport venues.

==Personal life==
Palmer&#x27;s two sons have both had successful motor racing careers. Jolyon Palmer, the 2014 GP2 Series champion, drove for RenaultSport F1 Team during the 2016 and 2017 seasons and is now a commentator and columnist for BBC Sport F1. Jonathan&#x27;s younger son Will Palmer won the BRDC F4 Championship and the prestigious McLaren Autosport BRDC Award in 2015, and finished second in Renault Eurocup in 2017.

Palmer also has two daughters: Emily, an accountant, and Alice, a professional equestrian showjumper.

Palmer married Emma Collins in 2018, having separated from his first wife, Gill, in 2011.

His career almost ended with a huge crash in the Reims 12-hour sports car endurance race, in which he suffered a broken arm, so severely damaged that its movement was permanently restricted. However he returned in 1965 and won the Reims Formula 3 race, after which he graduated to Formula 2 for the following season.

==Formula One==

In 1966, Beltoise drove in the German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring in a Formula Two (F2) one litre Matra MS5-Cosworth. He finished one lap down but won the F2 class. However, it was his only Grand Prix that season.
In 1967 Beltoise competed in three Grands Prix with a Formula Two Matra MS7 1.6 litre Cosworth, and finished seventh at both Watkins Glen and Mexico City. He also won the 1967 Buenos Aires Grand Prix, which was not part of the World Championship calendar. In 1968 Beltoise began the season again with an F2 car but from the second race onward had Formula One machinery and finished second in the 1968 Dutch Grand Prix. In 1969 he was placed in Ken Tyrrell&#x27;s Matra team, whilst the works V12 engine was developed driving alongside Jackie Stewart, and finished second in the French grand Prix. Beltoise returned to the works Matra team for both 1970 and 1971. In 1971, racing in the Matra sports car team, he was involved in the accident in which Ignazio Giunti died during the 1000 km Buenos Aires, and his international racing license was suspended, although he was allowed to compete while on appeal. 

For 1972, he moved to the BRM team and won what turned out to be his only and BRM&#x27;s final championship-qualifying Formula One victory at the 1972 Monaco Grand Prix in heavy rain. In that same year, Jean-Pierre won a non-championship race in the end of the F1 season, at Brands Hatch, thus marking the last two victories of BRM make in Formula One. He spent three seasons with BRM, and finally retired from Formula 1 at the end of the 1974 season.

==Later career==
He later did most of the testing for the Ligier F1 team, although a proposed Formula One drive for 1976 went instead to Jacques Laffite and he thereafter turned his attention to touring car racing in France, twice winning the French title for BMW before entering rallycross in an Alpine-Renault with which he won the French title. In 1981 he returned to touring cars and raced for Peugeot throughout the 1980s. He was also a regular ice racer. His two sons, Anthony and Julien, are both race drivers.

In fiction, Beltoise frequently appeared in the &quot;Michel Vaillant&quot; series of comic books, amongst others being part of the winning Vaillante Le Mans team.

== Death ==

Beltoise died at his holiday home in Dakar, Senegal, on 5 January 2015, aged 77, following two strokes.

<text>Mary Weir (17 March 1910 – 28 November 2004), known as Molly Weir, was a Scottish actress. She appeared as the character Hazel the McWitch in the BBC TV series &quot;Rentaghost&quot;.

She was the sister of naturalist and broadcaster Tom Weir.

==Biography==
Born in Glasgow and brought up in the Springburn area of the city, Weir began in amateur dramatics. In her early professional career, she was a well-known radio actress, featuring in many comedy shows, such as &quot;ITMA&quot;. Her greatest theatrical success came in &quot;The Happiest Days of Your Life&quot;.

She made her film debut in 1949, and had a regular role as the housekeeper, Aggie McDonald, in the radio and television sitcom &quot;Life With The Lyons&quot;. During the 1970s and early 1980s she became famous as a writer, with several volumes of best-selling memoirs, notably, &quot;Shoes Were For Sunday&quot;. She also appeared in a series of television advertisements for &quot;Flash&quot; the household cleaning agent. In 1969, she appeared in &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; starring Dame Maggie Smith. She and Helena Gloag played the Kerr sisters, the sewing mistresses of Marcia Blaine School for Girls. In 1970 Weir and Gloag reprised their collaboration in &quot;Scrooge&quot;, playing old sisters in debt to Ebenezer Scrooge, played by Albert Finney.
In the 1970s she was one of the presenters of &quot;Teatime Tales&quot;, a television series broadcast by STV in which she recalled her childhood. The series also featured Lavinia Derwent and Cliff Hanley. In the 1980s, she lampooned this homely image in the comedy series &quot;Victoria Wood As Seen On TV&quot; and appeared in a pop video for The Bluebells 1983 hit &quot;Young At Heart&quot;.

At the 1979 general election, Molly Weir was one of &quot;a galaxy of stage and television stars&quot; to appear at an election rally in support of the Conservative Party.

She is also the subject of the 1988 song &quot;Molly&#x27;s Lips&quot; by The Vaselines, and later covered by Nirvana.

Following her death, Molly Weir&#x27;s ashes were scattered on the banks of Loch Lomond, a favourite holiday location; and almost all her estate (of nearly £1.9 million), was bequeathed to charities.

<text>The genus Bowenia includes two living and two fossil species of cycads in the family Stangeriaceae, sometimes placed in their own family Boweniaceae. They are entirely restricted to Australia.

==Description==
The chromosome count is 2n = 18.

==Species==

==Distribution==
The two living species occur in Queensland. &quot;B. spectabilis&quot; grows in warm, wet, tropical rainforests, on protected slopes and near streams, primarily in the lowlands of the Wet Tropics Bioregion. However, it has a local form with serrate pinna margins that grows in rainforest, &quot;Acacia&quot;-dominated transition forest, and also &quot;Casuarina&quot;-dominated sclerophyll forest on the Atherton Tableland, where it is subject to periodic bushfire. &quot;B. serrulata&quot; grows in sclerophyll forest and transition forest close to the Tropic of Capricorn.

==Fossils==
The fossil species &quot;Bowenia eocenica&quot; is known from deposits in a coal mine in Victoria, Australia, and &quot;B. papillosa&quot; is known from deposits in New South Wales. Both fossils are of Eocene age, and consist of leaflet fragments.

<text>The Team (corporately styled as The TEAM) was a Canadian sports radio network, which broadcast from 2001 to 2002. It was owned and operated by CHUM Limited, based on the existing format of their Ottawa station The Team 1200, and incorporated virtually all of the company&#x27;s AM radio stations across Canada. It was dissolved as a national network in 2002 amid poor ratings, although a few of its former stations retained the sports format and Team branding as standalone entities.

==History==

The network was launched on May 7, 2001, but struggled to build an audience in many cities. In Toronto, for example, the network had to compete against Telemedia&#x27;s The Fan 590, and found that much of its potential audience had already built a strong sense of loyalty to the more established station. The switch of 1050 CHUM, the network&#x27;s flagship station, away from its popular former oldies format was also controversial.

The network aired both original programming — its marquee Canadian sportscaster was Jim Van Horne, while other programs were hosted by Paul Romanuk, Mike Richards and Gene Valaitis — and syndicated sports programming from the United States, such as &quot;The Jim Rome Show&quot;.

In August 2002, after just over a year on the air, CHUM pulled the plug and most of the network&#x27;s stations reverted to their old pre-Team formats. However, the sports format and the Team branding were retained in Ottawa, where it had already been the station&#x27;s established format before the network was launched, and in Montreal and Vancouver, where it was also successful in the ratings. Most of these stations, and one in Edmonton which had licensed the brand name but which at the time was owned by a different company, continued to use the Team branding as of early 2011, but were no longer considered a network.

All of the stations, save the former Calgary affiliate, are now owned by CHUM&#x27;s successor Bell Media. In 2011, some of these stations were rebranded and integrated into a new TSN Radio network, starting with Toronto&#x27;s radio station CHUM on April 13, 2011; the Winnipeg and Montreal stations were added shortly thereafter, with Ottawa and Edmonton stations added in 2013. The two Bell Media-owned sports radio stations in Vancouver, while sharing some programming with the TSN Radio stations, retained the Team branding until September 8, 2014, when they were both re-branded as TSN Radio.

==The Team stations==
===CHUM-owned===

===Affiliates===
CFAC in Calgary and CFRN in Edmonton were also affiliates of the Team, although the stations were not CHUM-owned — CFAC was owned by Rogers and CFRN by Standard Broadcasting. After the Team network folded, both stations retained the sports format, although CFAC adopted the name &quot;The Fan 960&quot;, as Rogers had by this time acquired Toronto&#x27;s Fan 590. CFRN, now also owned by Bell Media Radio, continued to use the Team branding until joining TSN Radio in 2013; it was shut down in June 2023.

==Later==
Vancouver&#x27;s CFTE, a sister station to CKST, also converted to the Team branding in 2009, airing a similar but distinct schedule of sports programming from its sister. Meanwhile, CHUM&#x27;s Winnipeg AM station CFRW returned to an all-sports format on September 27, 2010, at the time, the station was known as &quot;Sports Radio 1290&quot; (without any Team branding). The station was subsequently relaunched as &quot;TSN Radio 1290&quot; on October 5, 2011.

Following the 2007 acquisition of CHUM by CTVglobemedia, majority owner of TSN, there had been occasional reports about CTV potentially using the remaining Team stations and/or the 1050 frequency in Toronto to launch a new sports radio station in Toronto or full radio network using TSN content and personalities. Plans on launching a new TSN Radio brand began in January 2011 and Toronto&#x27;s radio station CHUM (1050 AM) became the first station under the new TSN Radio network as &quot;TSN Radio 1050&quot; on April 13, 2011. CTVglobemedia was purchased by Bell Canada Enterprises in early 2011 and became Bell Media; the company completed its purchase of Astral Media, owner of The Team&#x27;s former Edmonton affiliate CFRN, in July 2013.

<doc id="1226356" wikidata="Q7243183" url="?curid=1226356" title="Primary transcript">
<text>A primary transcript is the single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) product synthesized by transcription of DNA, and processed to yield various mature RNA products such as mRNAs, tRNAs, and rRNAs. The primary transcripts designated to be mRNAs are modified in preparation for translation. For example, a precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) is a type of primary transcript that becomes a messenger RNA (mRNA) after processing.

Pre-mRNA is synthesized from a DNA template in the cell nucleus by transcription. Pre-mRNA comprises the bulk of heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). Once pre-mRNA has been completely processed, it is termed &quot;mature messenger RNA&quot;, or simply &quot;messenger RNA&quot;. The term hnRNA is often used as a synonym for pre-mRNA, although, in the strict sense, hnRNA may include nuclear RNA transcripts that do not end up as cytoplasmic mRNA.

There are several steps contributing to the production of primary transcripts. All these steps involve a series of interactions to initiate and complete the transcription of DNA in the nucleus of eukaryotes. Certain factors play key roles in the activation and inhibition of transcription, where they regulate primary transcript production. Transcription produces primary transcripts that are further modified by several processes. These processes include the 5&#x27; cap, 3&#x27;-polyadenylation, and alternative splicing. In particular, alternative splicing directly contributes to the diversity of mRNA found in cells. The modifications of primary transcripts have been further studied in research seeking greater knowledge of the role and significance of these transcripts. Experimental studies based on molecular changes to primary transcripts and the processes before and after transcription have led to greater understanding of diseases involving primary transcripts.

== Production ==
The steps contributing to the production of primary transcripts involve a series of molecular interactions that initiate transcription of DNA within a cell&#x27;s nucleus. Based on the needs of a given cell, certain DNA sequences are transcribed to produce a variety of RNA products to be translated into functional proteins for cellular use. To initiate the transcription process in a cell&#x27;s nucleus, DNA double helices are unwound and hydrogen bonds connecting compatible nucleic acids of DNA are broken to produce two unconnected single DNA strands. One strand of the DNA template is used for transcription of the single-stranded primary transcript mRNA. This DNA strand is bound by an RNA polymerase at the promoter region of the DNA.

In eukaryotes, three kinds of RNA—rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA—are produced based on the activity of three distinct RNA polymerases, whereas, in prokaryotes, only one RNA polymerase exists to create all kinds of RNA molecules. RNA polymerase II of eukaryotes transcribes the primary transcript, a transcript destined to be processed into mRNA, from the antisense DNA template in the 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; direction, and this newly synthesized primary transcript is complementary to the antisense strand of DNA. RNA polymerase II constructs the primary transcript using a set of four specific ribonucleoside monophosphate residues (adenosine monophosphate (AMP), cytidine monophosphate (CMP), guanosine monophosphate (GMP), and uridine monophosphate (UMP)) that are added continuously to the 3&#x27; hydroxyl group on the 3&#x27; end of the growing mRNA.

Studies of primary transcripts produced by RNA polymerase II reveal that an average primary transcript is 7,000 nucleotides in length, with some growing as long as 20,000 nucleotides in length. The inclusion of both exon and intron sequences within primary transcripts explains the size difference between larger primary transcripts and smaller, mature mRNA ready for translation into protein.

===Regulation===

A number of factors contribute to the activation and inhibition of transcription and therefore regulate the production of primary transcripts from a given DNA template.

Activation of RNA polymerase activity to produce primary transcripts is often controlled by sequences of DNA called enhancers. Transcription factors, proteins that bind to DNA elements to either activate or repress transcription, bind to enhancers and recruit enzymes that alter nucleosome components, causing DNA to be either more or less accessible to RNA polymerase. The unique combinations of either activating or inhibiting transcription factors that bind to enhancer DNA regions determine whether or not the gene that enhancer interacts with is activated for transcription or not. Activation of transcription depends on whether or not the transcription elongation complex, itself consisting of a variety of transcription factors, can induce RNA polymerase to dissociate from the Mediator complex that connects an enhancer region to the promoter. 

Inhibition of RNA polymerase activity can also be regulated by DNA sequences called silencers. Like enhancers, silencers may be located at locations farther up or downstream from the genes they regulate. These DNA sequences bind to factors that contribute to the destabilization of the initiation complex required to activate RNA polymerase, and therefore inhibit transcription.

Histone modification by transcription factors is another key regulatory factor for transcription by RNA polymerase. In general, factors that lead to histone acetylation activate transcription while factors that lead to histone deacetylation inhibit transcription. Acetylation of histones induces repulsion between negative components within nucleosomes, allowing for RNA polymerase access. Deacetylation of histones stabilizes tightly coiled nucleosomes, inhibiting RNA polymerase access. In addition to acetylation patterns of histones, methylation patterns at promoter regions of DNA can regulate RNA polymerase access to a given template. RNA polymerase is often incapable of synthesizing a primary transcript if the targeted gene&#x27;s promoter region contains specific methylated cytosines— residues that hinder binding of transcription-activating factors and recruit other enzymes to stabilize a tightly bound nucleosome structure, excluding access to RNA polymerase and preventing the production of primary transcripts.

===R-loops===

R-loops are formed during transcription. An R-loop is a three-stranded nucleic acid structure containing a DNA-RNA hybrid region and an associated non-template single-stranded DNA. Actively transcribed regions of DNA often form R-loops that are vulnerable to DNA damage. Introns reduce R-loop formation and DNA damage in highly expressed yeast genes.

===Transcription stress===

DNA damages arise in each cell, every day, with the number of damages in each cell reaching tens to hundreds of thousands, and such DNA damages can impede primary transcription. The process of gene expression itself is a source of endogenous DNA damages resulting from the susceptibility of single-stranded DNA to damage. Other sources of DNA damage are conflicts of the primary transcription machinery with the DNA replication machinery, and the activity of certain enzymes such as topoisomerases and base excision repair enzymes. Even though these processes are tightly regulated and are usually accurate, occasionally they can make mistakes and leave behind DNA breaks that drive chromosomal rearrangements or cell death.

==RNA processing==

Transcription, a highly regulated phase in gene expression, produces primary transcripts. However, transcription is only the first step which should be followed by many modifications that yield functional forms of RNAs. Otherwise stated, the newly synthesized primary transcripts are modified in several ways to be converted to their mature, functional forms to produce different proteins and RNAs such as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.

===Processing===
The basic primary transcript modification process is similar for tRNA and rRNA in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. On the other hand, primary transcript processing varies in mRNAs of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. For example, some prokaryotic bacterial mRNAs serve as templates for synthesis of proteins at the same time they are being produced via transcription. Alternatively, pre-mRNA of eukaryotic cells undergo a wide range of modifications prior to their transport from the nucleus to cytoplasm where their mature forms are translated. These modifications are responsible for the different types of encoded messages that lead to translation of various types of products. Furthermore, primary transcript processing provides a control for gene expression as well as a regulatory mechanism for the degradation rates of mRNAs. The processing of pre-mRNA in eukaryotic cells includes 5&#x27; capping, 3&#x27; polyadenylation, and alternative splicing.

===5&#x27; capping===

Shortly after transcription is initiated in eukaryotes, a pre-mRNA&#x27;s 5&#x27; end is modified by the addition of a 7-methylguanosine cap, also known as a 5&#x27; cap. The 5&#x27; capping modification is initiated by the addition of a GTP to the 5&#x27; terminal nucleotide of the pre-mRNA in reverse orientation followed by the addition of methyl groups to the G residue. 5&#x27; capping is essential for the production of functional mRNAs since the 5&#x27; cap is responsible for aligning the mRNA with the ribosome during translation.

===Polyadenylation===

In eukaryotes, polyadenylation further modifies pre-mRNAs during which a structure called the poly-A tail is added. Signals for polyadenylation, which include several RNA sequence elements, are detected by a group of proteins which signal the addition of the poly-A tail (approximately 200 nucleotides in length). The polyadenylation reaction provides a signal for the end of transcription and this reaction ends approximately a few hundred nucleotides downstream from the poly-A tail location.

===Alternative splicing===

Eukaryotic pre-mRNAs have their introns spliced out by spliceosomes made up of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins.

In complex eukaryotic cells, one primary transcript is able to prepare large amounts of mature mRNAs due to alternative splicing. Alternative splicing is regulated so that each mature mRNA may encode a multiplicity of proteins. The effect of alternative splicing in gene expression can be seen in complex eukaryotes which have a fixed number of genes in their genome yet produce much larger numbers of different gene products. Most eukaryotic pre-mRNA transcripts contain multiple introns and exons. The various possible combinations of 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; splice sites in a pre-mRNA can lead to different excision and combination of exons while the introns are eliminated from the mature mRNA. Thus, various kinds of mature mRNAs are generated. Alternative splicing takes place in a large protein complex called the spliceosome. Alternative splicing is crucial for tissue-specific and developmental regulation in gene expression. Alternative splicing can be affected by various factors, including mutations such as chromosomal translocation.

In prokaryotes, splicing is done by autocatalytic cleavage or by endolytic cleavage. Autocatalytic cleavages, in which no proteins are involved, are usually reserved for sections that code for rRNA, whereas endolytic cleavage corresponds to tRNA precursors.

== Research ==

5-Fluorouracil (FUra) exposure in methotrexate-resistant KB cells led to a two-fold reduction in total dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) mRNA levels, while the level of DHFR pre-mRNA with certain introns remained unaffected. The half-life of DHFR mRNA or pre-mRNA did not change significantly, but the transition rate of DHFR RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm decreased, suggesting that FUra may influence mRNA processing and/or nuclear DHFR mRNA stability.

In &quot;Drosophila&quot; and &quot;Aedes&quot;, hnRNA (pre-mRNA) size was larger in &quot;Aedes&quot; due to its larger genome, despite both species producing mature mRNA of similar size and sequence complexity. This indicates that hnRNA size increases with genome size.

In HeLa cells, spliceosome groups on pre-mRNA were found to form within nuclear speckles, with this formation being temperature-dependent and influenced by specific RNA sequences. Pre-mRNA targeting and splicing factor loading in speckles were critical for spliceosome group formation, resulting in a speckled pattern.

Recruiting pre-mRNA to nuclear speckles significantly increased splicing efficiency and protein levels, indicating that proximity to speckles enhances splicing efficiency.

==Related diseases==
Research has also led to greater knowledge about certain diseases related to changes within primary transcripts. One study involved estrogen receptors and differential splicing. The article entitled, &quot;Alternative splicing of the human estrogen receptor alpha primary transcript: mechanisms of exon skipping&quot; by Paola Ferro, Alessandra Forlani, Marco Muselli and Ulrich Pfeffer from the laboratory of Molecular Oncology at National Cancer Research Institute in Genoa, Italy, explains that 1785 nucleotides of the region in the DNA that codes for the estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) are spread over a region that holds more than 300,000 nucleotides in the primary transcript. Splicing of this pre-mRNA frequently leads to variants or different kinds of the mRNA lacking one or more exons or regions necessary for coding proteins. These variants have been associated with breast cancer progression. In the life cycle of retroviruses, proviral DNA is incorporated in transcription of the DNA of the cell being infected. Since retroviruses need to change their pre-mRNA into DNA so that this DNA can be integrated within the DNA of the host it is affecting, the formation of that DNA template is a vital step for retrovirus replication. Cell type, the differentiation or changed state of the cell, and the physiological state of the cell, result in a significant change in the availability and activity of certain factors necessary for transcription. These variables create a wide range of viral gene expression. For example, tissue culture cells actively producing infectious virions of avian or murine leukemia viruses (ASLV or MLV) contain such high levels of viral RNA that 5–10% of the mRNA in a cell can be of viral origin. This shows that the primary transcripts produced by these retroviruses do not always follow the normal path to protein production and convert back into DNA in order to multiply and expand.

<text>The Félibrige (; in classical Occitan, in Mistralian spelling, ) is a literary and cultural association founded in 1854 by Frédéric Mistral and other Provençal writers to defend and promote the Occitan language (also called the ) and literature. It is presided over by a (classical norm: ). The name possibly derives from an apocryphal Provençal story of Christ disputing in the temple with the seven doctors [sét félibre] of law.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;&quot; is derived from &quot;&quot;, word of unclear origin.

==Origins==

Le Félibrige was founded at the Château de Font-Ségugne (located in Châteauneuf-de-Gadagne, Vaucluse) on 21 May 1854 (Saint Estelle&#x27;s day), by seven young Provençal poets: Théodore Aubanel, Jean Brunet, Paul Giéra, Anselme Mathieu, Frédéric Mistral, Joseph Roumanille and Alphonse Tavan. Together, they aimed to restore the Provençal language and codify its orthography.

Its symbol is a seven-pointed star which, as Frederic Mistral writes in &quot;Lou tresor dóu Felibrige&quot;, is &quot;a tribute to its seven founders&quot;.

The movement was launched in Provence but quickly reached the entire Occitania. It spread among Occitanian writers such as Michel Camélat and Simin Palay (from Gascony and Béarn), Albert Arnavielle, Justin Bessou, Jacques and Gabriel Azaïs and Achille Mir (Languedoc), Arsène Vermenouze (Auvergne), Joseph Roux (Limousin), José Mange (Provence), Brémonde de Tarascon (Bouches-du-Rhône), Batisto Bonnet (Gard) and Charles Maurras.

The Félibrige is an organisation focussed on protecting and promoting Occitan language and culture, fighting for recognition of cultural diversity both within France and across the wider world. It is also one of the two organisations represented across Occitania since 1945, along with the Institut d&#x27;Estudis Occitans (IEO).
==Felebrigian festivals==
There is a yearly meeting, &quot;Santo Estello&quot;, held in a different town in the Pays d&#x27;Oc. The traditional banquet is ended with the ritual of the &quot;Copa Santa&quot;.

There are also other &quot;Fêtes Félibréennes&quot;:
* Since 1323, the Jeux floraux of Toulouse, considered as the model
* Jeux floraux of Barcelona
* Orange
* In 1868 at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence
* In 1895 at Vic-en-Carladès, with a programme of music and dance (Cabrette)
* In 1900 at the Château de Ventadour, under the name &quot;Fête de l&#x27;églantine&quot;
* In 1902 at Béziers
* In June 1903 and in 2009 at Sceaux
* In 1907 at Mauvezin, in the Hautes-Pyrénées
* In August 1914, at Sauveterre-de-Béarn
* At Puy-en-Velay
* In 1935 at Monistrol-sur-Loire
* Perhaps Argentat, after 1935 with the &quot;Chorale des gabariers de la Dordogne&quot;

==The &quot;Jardin des Félibres&quot; in Sceaux==
In 1950 Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine (one of the Parisien banlieue) was named &quot;Cité Félibréenne&quot;. A memorial garden for this event was created around the tomb of Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian, a French poet and romancier, well known for his fables and a noted Félibrigist (perhaps because his mother was Castilian). The garden displays eleven busts in all.

The garden is located behind the church of Saint Jean-Baptiste (&quot;Saint John the Baptist&quot;) in Sceaux. The entry, signed: &quot;Parc de Sceaux, Jardin des Félibres&quot; is located on Avenue du Président Franklin Roosevelt in Sceaux.

<text>The Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI) conference is an annual computer science conference organized by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) which focuses on the study of algorithms, programming languages and compilers. It is sponsored by the SIGPLAN special interest group on programming languages.

In 2003, the conference was given an estimated impact factor of 2.89 by CiteSeer, placing it in the top 1% of computer science conferences. 
== History ==

The precursor of PLDI was the Symposium on Compiler Optimization, held July 27–28, 1970 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and chaired by Robert S. Northcote. That conference included papers by Frances E. Allen, John Cocke, Alfred V. Aho, Ravi Sethi, and Jeffrey D. Ullman. The first conference in the current PLDI series took place in 1979 under the name &quot;SIGPLAN Symposium on Compiler Construction&quot; in Denver, Colorado. The next compiler construction conference took place in 1982 in Boston, Massachusetts. The compiler construction conferences then alternated with SIGPLAN Conferences on Language Issues until 1988, when the conference was renamed to PLDI. From 1982 until 2001, the conference acronym was SIGPLAN &#x27;xx. Starting in 2002, the initialism became PLDI &#x27;xx, and in 2006 it became PLDI xxxx.

<doc id="1226362" wikidata="Q5925662" url="?curid=1226362" title="James Alexandrou">
<text>James Alekos Alexandrou (born 12 April 1985) is a British actor and filmmaker from London. He is known for playing Martin Fowler in the BBC One soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; from 1996 to 2007. He was also the presenter of &quot;Bizarre Crime&quot; on BBC Three.

==Early life==
Alexandrou was born in London to a Greek Cypriot father and an English mother. He has two sisters, one older, one a twin, as well as a younger brother. He was educated at Chingford Foundation School in Waltham Forest, as well as at Anna Scher Theatre School.

==Career==
Alexandrou&#x27;s acting career began in 1996, when he auditioned successfully for the role of Martin Fowler in the BBC One soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;. The character was created shortly after the show&#x27;s inception in 1985, with the role becoming vacant following the departure of actor Jon Peyton Price in 1996. Alexandrou appeared as Grant in the short film &quot;Blessed Burden&quot; in 1999.

In July 2003 he participated in a &quot;Soap Stars Special&quot; edition of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;. Over Christmas of 2005, Alexandrou starred in the crime caper, &quot;Who Stole The Snowman?&quot; On 14 April 2006, it was announced that Alexandrou would leave &quot;EastEnders&quot; in Autumn 2007. He and Natalie Cassidy, who played his on-screen wife Sonia Fowler, left on 2 February 2007 (to tie in with the exits of Wendy Richard and Ray Brooks). When asked about his departure Alexandrou said, &quot;I&#x27;ve decided to leave the show to experience other aspects of my industry. Having turned 21, I felt it was a good time to leave. I owe everything to the show and would love to come back one day - that&#x27;s if &quot;EastEnders&quot; would have me.&quot; On 12 October 2014, it was announced that actor James Bye would be taking over playing the role in the character&#x27;s return to Albert Square. According to BBC News, Alexandrou was said to have &quot;given his blessing to the recasting of the role.&quot; When interviewed, Alexandrou implicitly stated that he had turned down the opportunity to return to the show. 

In early 2007, Alexandrou appeared in the play &quot;The Homecoming&quot; opposite Harold Pinter for BBC Radio 3.

Alexandrou toured the UK and Norway with the British Shakespeare Company from June to September 2007. He played Pistol in &quot;Henry V&quot;, and Orlando in &quot;As You Like It&quot;. It was incorrectly reported that he turned down the chance to replace Daniel Radcliffe in the &quot;West End&quot; revival of &quot;Equus&quot; in 2007.

In 2008 he appeared in &quot;In My Name&quot;, a new play by Steven Hevey, at the Old Red Lion Theatre, produced by Yaller Skunk Theatre Company. The play transferred to the Trafalgar Studio 2 from 1 to 19 July 2008. In October 2008, Alexandrou appeared in &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; at the Nottingham Playhouse, prior to a UK tour of the production.

In March 2009, he played the part of Romeo in the Globe Theatre&#x27;s production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. In October 2009, Alexandrou joined up with EastEnders cast members, Natalie Cassidy (Sonia Jackson) and Nina Wadia (Zainab Masood), to star in comedy shorts for &quot;BBC Raw Words&quot;.

In 2010 Alexandrou filmed his first feature film, &quot;Semper Fidel&quot; in Cuba. The film was released in 2014. He appeared in the role of The Man in John Goodrum&#x27;s play &quot;The Black Veil&quot; a thriller adapted from a Charles Dickens short story.

In 2011 Alexandrou took part in the BBC Learning project, &quot;Off By Heart Shakespeare&quot;, where he played Mercutio from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; delivering the speech; &quot;&#x27;tis not so deep as a well&quot;.

In 2012 Alexandrou toured theatres throughout the United Kingdom, with the Hull Truck Theatre starring as Phil, in the play &quot;DNA&quot;.

In April 2014, as part of the Shakespeare 450 celebrations, he played the Iago in Grassroots Shakespeare London&#x27;s production of &quot;Othello&quot; at Leicester Square Theatre in London&#x27;s West End and also performed sonnets at the Guildhall with Damian Lewis. Rehearsals were recorded by BBC World Service and James Alexandrou&#x27;s performance as Iago featured in their programme &quot;The Why Factor&quot;.

In February 2015, Alexandrou appeared in &quot;Silent Witness&quot; as Carl Parry. and in 2022 as Ronnie Reynolds in Call the Midwife.

==Personal life==
Alexandrou was in a relationship with &quot;EastEnders&quot; co-star Kara Tointon which began in April 2006. Their split was reported in November 2007.

<text>Beauty and the Beast ( – also the UK title) is a 1946 French surrealist romantic fantasy film directed by French poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau. Starring Josette Day as Belle and Jean Marais as the Beast, it is an adaptation of the 1757 story &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, written by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont and published as part of a fairy tale anthology.

The plot of Cocteau&#x27;s film revolves around Belle&#x27;s father, who is sentenced to death for picking a rose from the Beast&#x27;s garden. Belle offers to go back to the Beast in her father&#x27;s place. The Beast falls in love with her and proposes marriage on a nightly basis, which she refuses. Belle eventually becomes more drawn to the Beast, who tests her by letting her return home to her family, and telling her that if she does not return to him within a week, he will die of grief.

&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is now recognized as a classic of French cinema.

==Plot==
While scrubbing the floor at home, Belle is interrupted by her brother&#x27;s friend Avenant, who tells her she deserves better and suggests they get married. Belle rejects Avenant, as she wishes to stay home and take care of her father, who has suffered much since his ships were lost at sea and the family fortune along with them. Belle&#x27;s father arrives home announcing he has come into a great fortune that he will pick up the next day, along with gifts for his daughters, Belle and her shrewish sisters Adelaide and Felicie. Belle&#x27;s roguish brother Ludovic, believing they will soon be wealthy, signs a contract from a moneylender allowing him the ability to sue Ludovic&#x27;s father if he can not pay. Belle&#x27;s sisters ask for a monkey and a parrot as gifts, but Belle asks only for a rose.

However, the next day, Belle&#x27;s father finds on his arrival that his fortune has been seized to clear his debts and he is as penniless as before. He has no money for lodging and is forced to return home through a forest at night. He gets lost in the forest and finds himself at a large castle whose gates and doors magically open themselves. On entering the castle, he is guided by an enchanted candelabra that leads him to a laden dinner table where he falls asleep. Awakened by a loud roar, he wanders the castle&#x27;s grounds. Remembering that Belle asked for a rose, he plucks a rose from a tree which makes the Beast appear. The Beast threatens to kill him for theft but suggests that one of his daughters can take his place. The Beast offers his horse Magnificent to guide him through the forest and to his home.
Belle&#x27;s father explains the situation to his family and Avenant. Belle agrees to take her father&#x27;s place and rides Magnificent to the castle. Upon meeting the Beast, Belle faints at his monstrous appearance and is carried to her room in the castle. Belle awakens to find a magic mirror which allows her to see anything. The Beast invites Belle to dinner, where he tells her that she&#x27;s in equal command to him and that she will be asked every day to marry him. Days pass as Belle grows more accustomed to and fond of the Beast, but she continues to refuse marriage. Using the magic mirror, Belle sees that her father has become deathly ill. Belle begs for permission to visit her family, and the Beast reluctantly grants her permission to leave for a week. He gives Belle two magical items: a glove that can transport her wherever she wishes and a golden key that unlocks Diana&#x27;s Pavilion, the source of the Beast&#x27;s true riches. He tells Belle that he gives her these precious items to show his trust in her, and says that if she does not return at the end of the week, he will die of grief.

Belle uses the glove to appear in her bedridden father&#x27;s room, where her visit restores him to health. Belle finds her family living in poverty, having never recovered from Ludovic&#x27;s deal with the moneylender. Jealous of Belle&#x27;s rich life at the castle, Adelaide and Felicie steal her golden key and devise a plan to turn Ludovic and Avenant against the Beast. Avenant and Ludovic devise a plan of their own to kill the Beast, and agree to aid Belle&#x27;s sisters. To stall Belle, her sisters trick her into staying past her seven-day limit by pretending to love her. Belle reluctantly agrees to stay.

The Beast sends Magnificent with the magic mirror to retrieve Belle but Ludovic and Avenant find Magnificent first, and ride him to the castle. Belle later finds the mirror which reveals the Beast&#x27;s sorrowful face in its reflection. Belle realizes she is missing the golden key as the mirror breaks. Distraught, Belle returns to the castle using the magic glove and finds the Beast in the courtyard, near death from a broken heart.

Meanwhile, Avenant and Ludovic stumble upon Diana&#x27;s Pavilion. Thinking that their stolen key may trigger a trap, they scale the wall of the Pavilion. As the Beast dies in Belle&#x27;s arms, Avenant breaks into the Pavilion through its glass roof, whereupon he is shot with an arrow by an animated statue of the Roman goddess Diana and is himself turned into a Beast. As this happens, arising from where the Beast lay dead is Prince Ardent who is cured of being the Beast. He explains that because his parents did not believe in spirits, the spirits turned him into the Beast as revenge. Prince Ardent and Belle embrace, then fly away to his kingdom where she will be his Queen. He promises that her father will stay with them and Belle&#x27;s sisters will carry the train of her gown.

== Production ==
===Writing===
After the opening credits, Cocteau briefly breaks the fourth wall with a written preamble:
:


:Children believe what we tell them. They have complete faith in us. They believe that a rose plucked from a garden can plunge a family into conflict. They believe that the hands of a human beast will smoke when he slays a victim, and that this will cause him shame when a young maiden takes up residence in his home. They believe a thousand other simple things.

:I ask of you a little of this childlike sympathy and, to bring us luck, let me speak four truly magic words, childhood&#x27;s &quot;Open Sesame&quot;:

:Once upon a time...
===Filming===
The set designs and cinematography were intended to evoke the illustrations and engravings of Gustave Doré and, in the farmhouse scenes, the paintings of Jan Vermeer. The cinematography was performed by Henri Alekan. Christian Bérard and Lucien Carré covered production design.

=== Soundtrack ===
The score was composed by Georges Auric.

=== Filming locations ===
The outdoor locations were primarily filmed

* At Oise
** The Château de Raray
* At Val-d&#x27;Oise 
** At the Royaumont Abbey
* At Indre-et-Loire
** The Moulin de Touvoie in Rochecorbon is Belle&#x27;s home.
** Parçay-Meslay
* At the Alpes-Maritimes
** Èze

The scenes filmed in a studio were shot

* At the Franstudio Studio in Saint-Maurice, in the Val-de-Marne
* At the Eclair Studio in Épinay-sur-Seine
* At Joinville Studios in Joinville-le-Pont

=== The Beast&#x27;s makeup ===
At first, Jean Marais wanted to use a deer head, but decided against it, because in &quot;La Chatte blanche,&quot; the magical castle has a deer head as its door knocker. He also thought it would be linked to the myth of the Celtic god Cernunnos, the horned god. In addition, Jean Cocteau thought that the audience would think that the head of a deer would be ridiculous for a dangerous, ferocious beast. They got Jean Marais&#x27;s Alaskan Husky, Moulouk, to be the model of the beast&#x27;s face.

The beast&#x27;s makeup and prostheses took a long time to apply, taking about three hours to attach the beast&#x27;s mask and one hour for each claw. The teeth would be hooked into the actor&#x27;s mouth, which was not very practical for eating. This caused the actor to eat mainly soup.

In Vincent Pinel&#x27;s &quot;Century of Cinema,&quot; he writes (page 207), &quot;With the complexity of the set designer Christian Bérard, the cinematographer Henri Alekan, and his &quot;technical director&quot; René Clément, Jean Cocteau filmed &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1946). The impressive makeup of Jean Marais, including both hands and claws, took long hours to apply.&quot; Cocteau says, in his film journal, how the close-up shots of the beast resembles a deer. &quot;Clément, hiding behind the beast, moves the beast&#x27;s ears with a stick to make them stand up. The effect is amazing.&quot;

==Reception in the U.S.==
Upon the film&#x27;s December 1947 New York City release, critic Bosley Crowther called the film a &quot;priceless fabric of subtle images...a fabric of gorgeous visual metaphors, of undulating movements and rhythmic pace, of hypnotic sounds and music, of casually congealing ideas&quot;; according to Crowther, &quot;the dialogue, in French, is spare and simple, with the story largely told in pantomime, and the music of Georges Auric accompanies the dreamy, fitful moods. The settings are likewise expressive, many of the exteriors having been filmed for rare architectural vignettes at Raray, one of the most beautiful palaces and parks in all France. And the costumes, too, by Christian Bérard and Escoffier, are exquisite affairs, glittering and imaginative.&quot; According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, the film is a &quot;wondrous spectacle for children of any language, and quite a treat for their parents, too&quot;; but the magazine concludes &quot;Cocteau makes about a half-hour too much of a good thing—and few things pall like a dream that cannot be shaken off.&quot;

In 1999 &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert added the film to his The Great Movies list, calling it &quot;one of the most magical of all films&quot; and a &quot;fantasy alive with trick shots and astonishing effects, giving us a Beast who is lonely like a man and misunderstood like an animal.&quot; A 2002 &quot;Village Voice&quot; review found the film&#x27;s &quot;visual opulence&quot; &quot;both appealing and problematic&quot;, writing &quot;Full of baroque interiors, elegant costumes, and overwrought jewelry (even tears turn to diamonds), the film is all surface, and undermines its own don&#x27;t-trust-a-pretty-face and anti-greed themes at every turn.&quot; In 2010, the film was ranked #26 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot;.

==Adaptations and homages==

*Jacques Demy&#x27;s 1970 film &quot;Donkey Skin&quot; is a musical farce adapted from Charles Perrault&#x27;s incestuous fairy tale about a widowed king who wishes to marry his beautiful daughter. Demy pays homage to Cocteau in numerous references to &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, including the casting of actor Jean Marais as the king. At one point, the king woos the princess by reading from Cocteau&#x27;s poem, &quot;Ode à Picasso.&quot;
*American singer-songwriter Stevie Nicks wrote her 1983 ballad &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; after screening the film for the second time. While she performs the song, the film plays on the screen behind her and the band.
*The fourteenth episode of &quot;Faerie Tale Theatre&quot;, broadcast in August 1984, featured an adaptation of &quot;Beauty And The Beast&quot; which was an homage to this film. It borrowed many visual elements, including the makeup for the beast, along with segments of the dialogue translated from French into English. It featured Susan Sarandon as Belle and Klaus Kinski as the Beast.
*Disney&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)&quot; featured many visual tributes to Cocteau&#x27;s version, most notably the idea of living furniture. 
*In 1994, composer Philip Glass created an opera version — also called &quot;La Belle et la Bête&quot; — one of a &quot;Cocteau Trilogy&quot; of operas. In its initial incarnation the musicians and singers would perform the work on stage with a restored, newly subtitled print of the film playing on a screen behind them. In the original presentation, Belle was sung by the mezzo-soprano Janice Felty. (The current Criterion Collection Blu-ray release offers the ability to view the movie while listening to either Glass&#x27;s score or the original soundtrack.)
*The 2003 American miniseries &quot;Angels in America&quot; features a dream sequence which duplicates the set design of the Beast&#x27;s castle. A character is shown reading a book about Cocteau before the dream begins.
*The Vienna Art Orchestra&#x27;s 1995 production &quot;The Vienna Art Orchestra plays for Jean Cocteau&quot; was performed with a showing of the film, and uses its text.

== Awards ==

* Won the Prix Louis Dullec in 1946
* Nominated for Grand Prize of the Festival for the 1946 Cannes Film Festival 
* Best Actor nominee for Jean Marais for the Bambi Awards in 1948
* Listed as part of the British Film Institute&#x27;s list of Top 50 films you should see by the age of 14.

<doc id="1226368" wikidata="Q123221384" url="?curid=1226368" title="Juno, Florida">
<text>Juno was a town in Palm Beach County, Florida. Settlement in Juno dated back to at least early 1889, when residents of Dade County, which then stretched from modern-day Martin County to Miami-Dade County, voted for the area to become the county seat. Located at the north end of the Lake Worth Lagoon, Juno soon became the southern terminus of the Jupiter and Lake Worth Railway, which is often referred to as the Celestial Railroad due to its stations at Juno, Mars, Venus, and Jupiter. Juno&#x27;s status as the seat of Dade County attracted people and businesses to the town, including &quot;The Tropical Sun&quot;, which became the first newspaper in South Florida.

Described as a small but thriving town in its first few years, growth in the community did not last after Henry Flagler refused to purchase the Jupiter and Lake Worth Railway in the mid-1890s while extending his Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) southward, bypassing Juno. The FEC not only drove the Jupiter and Lake Worth Railway out of business but also shifted economic and population increases to the fledgling communities of Palm Beach and West Palm Beach. Additionally, the Dade County seat returned to Miami in 1899. Juno effectively became abandoned following a 1907 fire that destroyed many buildings and the former townsite is now partially located in present-day North Palm Beach and Palm Beach Gardens.

==History==

By 1888, people residing in the Lake Worth Lagoon region, including local politicians such as Elisha Newton Dimick, Alan E. Heyser, George W. Lainhart, and George W. Potter, began petitioning to move the county seat to the area from the settlements along Biscayne Bay. With a larger population than the Biscayne Bay Country communities, residents of the Lake Worth Lagoon region won the special election in February 1889 to move the county seat. Dade County covered a vast section of southeast Florida at the time, including modern-day Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, Martin, and parts of Okeechobee counties, but a small population of 995 people and just 224 dwellings according to the 1890 census. While many people in the Biscayne Bay Country accepted the results, others threatened violence, causing the Lake Worth Lagoon delegation who arrived to retrieve county records to canoe through the Everglades overnight up to the New River. Juno, then unnamed, likely became the county seat due to its location at the northern terminus of the Lake Worth Transportation Company steamship line. Sometime between March 1889 and January 1890, residents selected the name &quot;Juno&quot;, the wife of the Roman god Jupiter.

Newly-elected Dade County clerk A. F. Quimby stored the public records at the home of county commissioner Albert M. Fields until a courthouse could be constructed. Fields agreed to donate of land for the courthouse, which was located near where the Oakbrook Square shopping center stands today. C. C. Haight received the contract to build the courthouse at a cost of $1,495. Upon opening in the summer of 1890, the courthouse building featured offices for county clerk, judge, and sheriff on the first floor and a full-sized courtroom on the second floor, which could be repurposed for social functions such as dances or church or fraternal organization meetings. The county constructed a jailhouse nearby in 1892, spending about $350 on the building but another $850 for jail cells made of iron.

In 1891, Guy Metcalf moved the &quot;Indian River News&quot; to Juno from Melbourne and renamed the publication &quot;The Tropical Sun&quot;, which became the first newspaper in South Florida. Martin County historians Greg and Alice L. Luckhardt described Juno as including &quot;a post office, train station, saloon, hotel, Guy Metcalf&#x27;s &quot;Tropical Sun&quot; newspaper, lawyer Charles C. Chillingworth&#x27;s office located in the new courthouse, and abundant pineapple fields.&quot; Chillingworth recalled in 1932 that Juno featured &quot;at various times about seven dwelling houses, two boarding houses, one newspaper building and one very small railroad station and a small store building on the dock near the water&#x27;s edge.&quot; and did not have any banks, churches, medical practices, or schools, until a small one-room schoolhouse opened near the end of its time as the county seat.

Construction of Henry Flagler&#x27;s Royal Poinciana Hotel in Palm Beach began on May 1, 1893. Residents of Juno assumed that Flagler would purchase the Jupiter and Lake Worth Railway to avoid the flatwoods area to the west, which frequently flooded. Flagler indeed attempted to buy the railroad, but the high price compelled him to decide to continue his Florida East Coast Railway through the flatwoods. In &quot;The Florida Historical Quarterly&quot;, Nathan D. Shappee described Flagler spurning Juno as &quot;a blow from which the county seat and the Celestial Railroad never recovered.&quot; Metcalf moved &quot;The Tropical Sun&quot; to West Palm Beach in January 1895.

Juno&#x27;s jailhouse briefly held Sam Lewis, who shot and killed three people in Lemon City in 1895, including Rhett McGregor, considered the first law enforcement officer in Dade County to be murdered while on duty. A posse arrived at the jailhouse on August 17 to abduct Lewis. Although they successfully removed Lewis, the scuffle led to the death of the jailer. Thereafter, the mob hanged Lewis from a telephone pole, an incident considered the first lynching in South Florida. The 1896-1897 edition of the Business Directory, Guide and History of Dade County, Fla. estimated that approximately 100 people lived in Juno and predicted that the community would unlikely ever be more than a farming town with a post office. By March 1899, 500 registered voters in Dade County signed a petition for another county seat referendum, scheduled to occur on May 10. The referendum led to the county seat being relocated to Miami, lessening interesting in Juno even further. Juno had been mostly abandoned by 1907. A forest fire on April 12 of that year burned down all remaining buildings and dwellings, most of which were unoccupied.

==Legacy==
Former residents and local pioneers erected a monument in the 1930s where the southern terminus of the Jupiter and Lake Worth Railway once stood upon request by Chillingworth, by then a county judge. Several years later, vandals defaced the monument and machinery later damaged it during a re-surfacing of U.S. Route 1. Today, a marker stands in Palm Beach Gardens along U.S. Route 1 just north of Florida State Road 786 (PGA Boulevard), which notes that the Daughters of the American Revolution&#x27;s (DAR) Seminole chapter first constructed it in 1938.

The present-day town of Juno Beach, incorporated in 1953, is located a few miles north of the former community of Juno. Juno Ridge, a census-designated place, is located near the DAR&#x27;s historical marker. According to the Historical Society of Palm Beach County, a brick cistern has been preserved inside modern-day North Palm Beach&#x27;s Twelve Oaks subdivision, where the town dock once stood.

==Notable resident==
Ivy Julia Cromartie Stranahan, a philanthropist and advocate for the Seminole tribe, noted in an autobiography that she and her family lived in Juno for several years during her childhood, before moving to Lemon City by 1899.

<doc id="1226370" wikidata="Q4970784" url="?curid=1226370" title="British Rail Class 401">
<text>The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation 2-BIL to the DC third rail electric multiple units built during the 1930s to work long-distance semi-fast services on the newly electrified lines from London to Eastbourne, Portsmouth and Reading. This type of unit survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated TOPS Class 401.

==Construction==
The 2-BIL units (2-car Bi-Lavatory stock) were so-called because each set had two lavatories, one in each car. They were built in four batches, each for service on newly electrified lines:
The different batches were broadly similar, though in the first one, the driving motor brake car had a smaller brake compartment and seven full compartments, rather than six-and-a-half in the later batches.

Several of the cars were destroyed in World War II at various points on the system. Some unit numbers were withdrawn, while others received a single replacement car from the small batch of postwar all-steel 2-HAL units which were built as replacements.

==Formations==
The first two batches of 2-BIL stock were subject to the EMU renumbering scheme implemented during January and February 1937. The renumbering of these units, and the original formations of all 2-BIL units, are set out in the table below (*Unit 1890 was renumbered 1900 in January 1936):

The first ten 2-BIL units (2001 to 2010) had an earlier form of multiple unit control. They were compatible with the 4-LAV units of the same era, but not with the remainder of the 2-BIL sets. They normally operating from Brighton, where the 4-LAV were also based, on local services. The remaining sets spent their lives on the services for which they were constructed, although they were fully mixed in operation, and it was common for units to be exchanged between areas of operation even within a day&#x27;s normal work. Commuter services into London Waterloo, Victoria and London Bridge found them typically marshalled up to 8-car units.

An unusual feature of their operation in the 1950s and 1960s was that there were about 30 more diagrams for these units than sets actually existed, while for the subsequent 2-HAL units (Class 402) there were more than 30 spare units, so a significant number of the daily 2-BIL diagrams were operated by the latter units, typically marshalled together as one of the sets in a full 8-car formation.

==7TC==
In 1963, a 7-coach trailer set was formed by placing five former 4-SUB trailer cars between the two driving cars from unit 2006. The set was intended for use on the Oxted line, where it was hauled by diesel locomotives.

The motors from former DMBS car number 10573 were removed, and the whole set was re-wired to enable the hauling diesel locomotive to provide the electric train heating. Six out of nine compartments of one of the 4-Sub Trailer Second cars (number 11485) were refitted as first class compartments, thereby making it a Trailer Composite.

The set was originally numbered 900 in the old hauled carriage set number series, but this was amended in February 1966 to 701 in the new series for trailer control units. Despite this, and its designation as 7-TC (7-car Trailer Control stock), it was not a real trailer control unit in that a locomotive could not be operated remotely from the unit&#x27;s driving cars.

The unit was stored from December 1967 and then withdrawn in April 1969. However, while the two driving cars were scrapped the following year, all five trailers were reused in other units. Four returned to 4-SUB formations, but 11485 underwent a further conversion, this time to a 4EPB Trailer Second, and was renumbered 15084. Full details of the 7-TC formation, the origin of the individual cars and their subsequent disposal are set out in the table below:

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 1 August 1962, unit No.2088 was derailed at , West Sussex when a set of points moved under it due to an electrical fault. Thirty-eight people were injured.

==Withdrawal==
After withdrawal in 1971, various 2-BIL units in company with 2-HAL units were noted at Stratford in east London destined for scrapping by Kings of Norwich, or being hauled west for scrapping in the Newport area.

==Preservation==
Only one 2-BIL unit has survived into preservation, namely number 2090, formed of carriages 10656 and 12123, which is in the care of the National Railway Museum, York. This unit is also the only pre-war main line EMUs in existence, which is still in original formation. A Class 503, which was kept at the Locomotive Storage Ltd facility in Margate, has 2 carriages slated for scrap [9]
==Model railways==
In 2013, Hornby Railways introduced a DCC-ready OO gauge model of the 2-BIL, with versions in both SR green and BR green.

In 2010, Electrifying Trains produced a BR green 2-BIL model in O gauge.

<doc id="1226387" wikidata="Q7493044" url="?curid=1226387" title="Sheila Ferguson">
<text>Sheila Diana Ferguson (born October 8, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and author, who has worked primarily in the United Kingdom. Between 1966 and 1986, she was a member of the American female soul music group The Three Degrees, singing lead vocals on most of the group&#x27;s biggest hits, most notably &quot;When Will I See You Again&quot;, which had international success, topping the UK Singles Chart and peaking at #2 in the US.

Following her departure from The Three Degrees in 1986, Ferguson went on to have her own solo singing career, touring internationally, making multiple TV appearances, and releasing a solo album titled &quot;A New Kind of Medicine&quot;. She has forged a prolific stage and screen career in the UK, starring in numerous musicals, soul legend tours, and her own sitcom &quot;Land of Hope and Gloria&quot;. She is also the best-selling author of &quot;Soul Food: Classic Cuisine from the Deep South&quot;.

==Early life==
Sheila Diana Ferguson was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Despite attending more than 10 schools as a child, she was academically gifted and had originally wanted to become a psychologist. A teenage crush on the singer Marvin Gaye led her to try her hand at singing in the hope that, by doing so, she would be able to meet him. She achieved this dream some time later when, appearing at the Apollo Theater, she talked to Gaye in his dressing room.

While at high school, Ferguson was introduced by her teacher to Richard Barrett, who had previously been a singer with a group called The Valentines, and later had gone on to become a manager. Barrett placed Ferguson&#x27;s first single, &quot;Little Red Riding Hood/How Did That Happen&quot; with Landa Records,#706. Subsequently signed to Swan Records, Ferguson also recorded the first two songs she wrote herself &quot;I Weep for You&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me Lover&quot; out of three solo singles for the label during 1965.

Other solo songs she recorded were &quot;How Did That Happen&quot;, written by Ugene Dozier, &quot;And in Return&quot; and &quot;Are You Satisfied&quot;, written by General Johnson (later to become known to the world as the lead singer of Chairmen of the Board).

Ferguson recorded two up-tempo numbers written for her by a talented up and coming songwriter by the name of Leon Huff. Huff would later team up with Kenny Gamble to form the Philadelphia International Records. These were &quot;Heartbroken Memories&quot; and &quot;Signs of Love&quot;.

==Career==
===Soul music===
====The Three Degrees====
Although Barrett signed Ferguson as a solo artist, he was already in the process of creating a group called The Three Degrees with the line up of Fayette Pinkney, Shirley Porter and Linda Turner. By 1966, the line up had changed to be Fayette Pinkney, Helen Scott and Janet Harmon. However, Scott announced she would be leaving the group in order to get married. Having previously appeared with the group as a cover when one of the girls fell ill, Ferguson was asked by Pinkney and Harmon to become a permanent member. In 1967, Harmon left the group and was replaced by Valerie Holiday. Barrett signed them to several record labels, and by 1970, they were signed to Roulette Records and released their first album &quot;Maybe&quot;, the title song of which reached #4 in the US R&amp;B charts. The singles &quot;I Do Take You&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re the Fool&quot; followed as well as second album &quot;So Much Love&quot;.

In 1971, the group appeared in the Oscar-winning film &quot;The French Connection&quot; singing &quot;Everybody Gets to Go to the Moon&quot;, and in 1973, they appeared in the sitcom &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;.

It was during this year that The Three Degrees enjoyed their greatest success when signed by Philadelphia International Records and working with Gamble and Huff. Their first song under this label was &quot;TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)&quot;, which was the theme song for &quot;Soul Train&quot;. Under this label the group began to tour internationally. The self-titled &quot;The Three Degrees&quot; was released in 1973 and yielded hits such as &quot;Dirty Ol&#x27; Man&quot; (which went to #13 in the UK Singles Chart) and &quot;Year of Decision&quot; (which went to gold in the Netherlands and Belgium).

However, the subsequent release of &quot;When Will I See You Again&quot; ensured international recognition when the song became #1 in the UK charts for two weeks in August 1974 (the first time this had been achieved by an all female group since The Supremes). Following an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, other countries followed suit and &quot;When Will I See You Again&quot; did extremely well worldwide reaching #2 in the U.S. where it sold over two million copies and earned the group a gold record in 1974.

The group recorded two live albums in 1975 and a further studio album &quot;The Three Degrees International&quot;. This album was called &quot;Take Good Care of Yourself&quot; in the UK, the title song of which reached the top 10 in the same country. The album itself reached #6 in the UK Albums Chart.

In 1976, they released the album &quot;A Toast of Love&quot; (for the Far East market), the title song of which was released internationally. This was the year that Fayette Pinkney left and was replaced by former member Helen Scott. They then released &quot;Standing Up for Love&quot;, an album, in 1977.

In 1978 and 1979, they released two disco-styled albums &quot;New Dimensions&quot; and &quot;3D&quot;. From these albums. they had four top 20 hits in the UK with &quot;Givin&#x27; Up, Givin&#x27; In&quot;, &quot;Woman in Love&quot;, &quot;The Runner&quot; (co-written by Ferguson) and &quot;My Simple Heart&quot;. They also released &quot;A Collection of Their 20 Greatest Hits&quot;, a compilation album.

The group performed at Prince Charles&#x27; 30th birthday party, and in 1979, filmed their own TV special &quot;The Three Degrees at The Royal Albert Hall&quot; with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.

In 1980 they released &quot;Gold&quot;, another compilation album, which reached the top 10 in the UK Album Charts, and in 1982, they recorded a TV show for the BBC (&quot;Take Three Degrees&quot;), performing their greatest hits. They then released two albums &quot;Album of Love&quot; and &quot;Live in the UK&quot;. The single &quot;Liar&quot;, co-written by Ferguson, was released. and in 1985, they released &quot;The Heaven I Need&quot; and &quot;This Is The House&quot;, produced by Stock, Aitken and Waterman.

Ferguson left The Three Degrees in 1986 as a result of wanting to spend more time being a mother to take care of her very young daughters of the time. Sheila had mentioned in a 2006 interview that after she gave birth to her daughters, she was still singing and touring with The Three Degrees, but it caused her to limit her availability to her daughters and whenever she came home from her singing projects and tours, her daughters were noticeably clinging onto the nanny, instead of her. Realizing that her long absences from home caused her daughters to become emotionally distant from her, she then made the ultimate decision to leave the group. Additionally, in the 2006 interview, which separately featured Ferguson and Valerie Holiday (other Three Degrees member), it was revealed that in 1986 Ferguson called the other members of Three Degrees on a phone call to inform she was leaving the group. Both Ferguson and Holiday claimed on their own ends that the phone call conversation ended very abruptly. Holiday commented she was very upset feeling this conversation should have been in person, and not on a phone call. She commented that it was very difficult finding someone to replace Ferguson in the group, which eventually they did, but Holiday permanently took over Ferguson&#x27;s former spot as the lead singer of the group, and has been in this current role since her departure. Since then, Ferguson has had very limited contact with The Three Degrees and she has never made any public appearances with The Three Degrees. Though in a 2011 interview with The Three Degrees on the British TV show, &quot;Lorraine&quot;, they mentioned that because they and Ferguson are from their home city of Philadelphia, they sometimes come back to their home city to visit family and friends and, at times, Ferguson and The Three Degrees members may encounter each other, but very often their encounters with Ferguson are only for short moments and one of the members, Helen Scott, mentioned their occasional encounters with Sheila Ferguson is like . Although Ferguson no longer has any professional relational encounters with The Three Degrees, she still will perform hit songs that she originally recorded and sang with The Three Degrees; such as &quot;When Will I See You Again&quot;, &quot;Dirty Ol Man&quot;, &quot;Year of Decision&quot;, &quot;Woman In Love&quot;, &quot;Giving Up Giving In&quot;, and &quot;Take Good Care Of Yourself&quot;.

<text>Beihai Park is a public park and former imperial garden immediately northwest of the Forbidden City in Beijing, China. 

First built in the 12th century, Beihai is among the largest of all surviving Chinese gardens and contains numerous historically important structures, palaces, and temples. Once part of the Imperial City, it has been open to the public since 1925. As with many of Chinese imperial gardens, Beihai was designed to imitate renowned scenic spots and architecture from various regions of China, particularly Jiangnan around the Yangtze Delta. Various aspects of the park evoke the elaborate pavilions and canals of Hangzhou and Yangzhou, the delicate gardens of Suzhou, and the natural scenery around Lake Tai with its famously porous stones. Beihai Park itself is now reckoned one of the masterpieces of Chinese gardening and landscaping.

The present park has an area of around with a lake that covers more than half of its area. At its center is Jade Flower Island &quot;Qiónghuádǎo&quot;), whose highest point is . The park&#x27;s lake is connected at its northern end to the Shichahai.

&quot;Beihai&quot; is the pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of the garden&#x27;s Chinese name, meaning &quot;Northern Sea&quot;. The name corresponds to the &quot;Central Sea&quot; &quot;Zhōnghǎi&quot;) and &quot;Southern Sea&quot; &quot;Nánhǎi&quot;) immediately to the park&#x27;s south, still usedunder the combined name Zhongnanhaias the restricted headquarters of China&#x27;s paramount leaders.

==History==
In 1179, Emperor Zhangzong of the Jurchen Jin dynasty had a country resort built northeast of Zhongdu, his empire&#x27;s central capital located in what is now southwestern Beijing. Taiye Lake was excavated along the Jinshui River and the Palace of Great Peace &quot;Dàníng Gōng&quot;) was erected on Jade Flower Island in the lake.

During the reign of Kublai Khan of the Mongol Yuan dynasty, the island was redesigned by various architects and officials including Liu Bingzhong, Guo Shoujing, and Amir al-Din. Taiye Lake was enclosed within the walls of the Imperial City of the Yuan Empire&#x27;s new capital Khanbaliq.

The Ming dynasty was initially based at Nanjing but moved to Beijing under the Yongle Emperor, with construction of his palace complex beginning in 1406. At this time, Taiye Lake was divided by bridges into three lakes described as the &quot;Northern&quot;, &quot;Central&quot;, and &quot;Southern Seas&quot;. These lakes formed part of an extensive royal estate within the Imperial City called the Western Garden (, &quot;Xīyuàn&quot;).

In 1747, the Qianlong Emperor ordered that three rare calligraphy works made by Wang Xizhi, Wang Xianzhi, and Wang Xun then housed within the Hall of Mental Cultivation along with 134 other calligraphic works from the Imperial Collection were to be carved into stone and displayed at the Pavilion of Reviewing the Past beside Beihai.

==Notable places==
Beihai Park includes several Buddhist temples within its grounds, including the Temple of Everlasting Peace &quot;Yǒng&#x27;ān Sì&quot;) and the Chanfu Temple. 

The White Dagoba or Pagoda , &quot;Báitǎ&quot;) is a Tibetan-style stupa placed on the highest point on Jade Flower Island, built to honor the visit of the 5th Dalai Lama in 1651. It is high and made of white stone. It houses reliquaries with Buddhist scriptures, monks&#x27; robes and alms bowls, and relics, the ash and bones of monks left after their cremation. Sun, moon, and flame engravings decorate the surface of the tower. Destroyed by the 1679 Sanhe-Pinggu earthquake, it was rebuilt the following year. Damage from the 1976 Tangshan earthquake was repaired the same year.

On the lake&#x27;s north bank lies the Five Dragon Pavilions, five connected pavilions with spires and pointed upswept eaves, built under the Ming.

The Nine-Dragon Wall lies north of the Five Dragon Pavilions. It was built in 1402 and is one of three walls of its kind in China. It is made of glazed bricks in seven colors. Nine complete dragons playing in the clouds decorate both sides of the wall.

Many smaller gardens exist throughout the park. The Jingxin or Quieting Heart Room is a garden on the north bank that covers more than . 

The Hall of Received Light (&quot;Chengguangdian&quot;) is the main structure in the Round City &quot;Tuánchéng&quot;). It is a spacious building with a double-eaved roof made of yellow glazed tiles bordered in green. Inside there is a Buddha that is tall, which was presented to the Guangxu Emperor of the Qing by a Khmer king. It is carved from a single piece of pure white jade inlaid with precious stones. The Eight-Nation Alliance damaged the statue&#x27;s left arm during the 1900 Battle of Beijing.

The Taihu rocks in Beihai Park were shipped from Henan Province. There are also various pieces of art ranging from Yuan jade jars to a collection of 495 centuries-old stelas.

==Legacy==
The Five-Pavilion Bridge and Lotus Tower in Yangzhou&#x27;s Slender West Lake Scenic Area were self-consciously modeled on Beihai Park&#x27;s Five Dragon Pavilions and White Dagoba to curry favor with the Kangxi and Qianlong Emperors during their southern tours of Jiangnan in the 18th century.

<text>Diane Dolores Modahl (née Edwards, born 17 June 1966) is an English former middle distance runner who specialised in the 800 metres. She won Gold in the 800 m title at the 1990 Commonwealth Games, Silver at the 1986 Commonwealth Games, and Bronze at the 1998 Commonwealth Games.

Her career best 800 m time of 1:58.65 in 1990, ranks her 11th on the UK all-time list.

Her cousin is retired boxer Chris Eubank.

==Career==
Born Diane Dolores Edwards in Manchester, to Jamaican parents, she won the 1984 English Schools 800 metres title in 2:05.7. She emerged as one of Britain&#x27;s top 800m runners as a 20-year-old in 1986, winning the AAA Championships title ahead of Lorraine Baker. She went on to win a silver medal at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh in 2:01.12, finishing second to Kirsty Wade. A month later at the 1986 European Championships, she reached the semi-finals of the 800m, where she was eliminated in 2:00.84.

In 1987, Edwards won the UK Championship 800m title in June, ran a personal best of 1:59.30 to finish fourth at the Oslo Grand Prix on 4 July, and retained her AAAs 800m title, to earn selection for the 1987 World Championships, where she reached the semifinals and ran 1:59.34. In 1988, she earned selection for the Seoul Olympic Games, where she ran 1:59.66 in the semifinals, qualifying for the final. In the final, she finished eighth in 2:00.77. She had one of the best seasons of her career in 1989, including running 2:00.83 to finish third in the 800m at the IAAF Grand Prix Final in Monaco, behind Ana Quirot and Christine Wachtel. She was ranked number seven on the 1989 &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; world merit rankings at 800m.

In January 1990, Edwards won the gold medal in the 800m at the Commonwealth Games, winning in 2:00.25. On 14 July 1990 she broke the English record in the 800m with 1:58.65 in Oslo, a time that would remain the best of her career. The previous record was 1:58.98 by Shireen Bailey in 1987, the UK record being held by the Scottish born Welsh athlete Kirsty Wade (1:57.42). In August, Edwards reached the final at the 1990 European Championships, finishing eighth. After struggling with injury, she won her third AAAs 800m title in 1992, to earn selection for the Barcelona Olympics, where she reached the semifinals.

In 1993, now competing as Diane Modahl, she had perhaps the best season of her career, consistently running below two minutes for 800m, with her seasons best being 1:59.00 in Zurich. At the 1993 World Championships in Stuttgart, she ran 1:59.12 in the semifinals to qualify for the final. In the final, won by Maria Mutola, she finished fourth in 1:59.42. Modahl was ranked in the top ten of the &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot; 800m world merit rankings for the second time in 1993, again at number seven. In 1994, she won her fifth AAAs 800m title and won the 800m at the European Cup in Gateshead, edging out Patricia Djate of France. However at that years European Championships in Helsinki, she was eliminated in the semifinals, running 2:02.18.

Modahl returned to competition in 1996 and finished second behind Kelly Holmes in the 800 metres at the British Olympic trials in June, running 1:59.87. At the Atlanta Olympic Games in August, she pulled a hamstring in her heat, 50m from the finish. In 1998, she won her sixth AAAs 800m title, before going on to win the 800m bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur in the world class time of 1:58.81. She competed at her fourth Olympic Games in Sydney 2000, where she was eliminated in the heats running 2:02.41. She retired in 2002.

== Legal challenge against positive drug test ==
In 1994, following a routine drug test, Modahl was sent home from the Victoria Commonwealth Games in Canada by the British Athletics Federation and subsequently banned from competition, after the results were returned positive. Modahl challenged the IAAF&#x27;s drug-testing procedures and said she intended to produce evidence at the hearing which will show &quot;once and for all that no doping offence has been committed&quot;.

On returning to the UK, and adamant of her innocence, Diane engaged lawyers to make the case that the laboratory in Lisbon which tested her sample had major flaws in their processing. The case revealed that the laboratory had stored her urine sample on a table in the stadium in a room heated at 35 °C for three days, causing serious bacterial degradation. The evidence supported Modahl&#x27;s claim of innocence and she won the case. Modahl said, &quot;I have declared my innocence, I have never taken any banned substance&quot;.

The British Athletics Federation lifted Modahl&#x27;s ban on 25 July 1995. On 25 March 1996 the IAAF cleared Modahl of the charges.

The High Court, Court of Appeal and the House of Lords in London, whose panels included prominent judges such as Lord Irvine and Lord Woolf also stated in their summaries that Modahl should be seen as being innocent of all charges.

Ultimately, the cost financially ruined Modahl and contributed to the financial collapse of the BAF in 1998, which was replaced by UK Athletics.

Modahl and her husband Vicente wrote a book about their experiences, &quot;The Diane Modahl Story - Going the Distance&quot;, published in 1995. A second updated edition was released in 1996 after Modahl won her case.

== Career after athletics and charity work ==

Diane retired from competition in 2002 but remained heavily involved in sport.

In 2010, Diane established the Diane Modahl Sports Foundation (DMSF), a registered charity, alongside her husband, Vicente. DMSF brings athletics coaching opportunities to young people, particularly those living in disadvantaged areas.

Modahl was Lay Adviser to the Central Manchester Clinical Commissioning Group 2014–2015, Non Executive Director Primary Care Trust (PCT) NHS Manchester 2011–2014, and was previously the Chief Ambassador for the National Charity – Street Games.

<text>Hexaborane, also called hexaborane(10) to distinguish it from hexaborane(12) (B6H12), is a boron hydride cluster with the formula B6H10. It is a colorless liquid that is unstable in air.

== Structure ==

Hexaborane(10) is classified as a &quot;nido&quot;-cluster. The boron atoms define a pentagonal pyramid, with four bridging hydrogen atoms and six terminal ones. The point group of the molecule is &quot;C&quot;s.

== Preparation and reactions ==
A laboratory route begins with bromination of pentaborane(11) followed by deprotonation of the bromide to give [BrB5H7]−. This anionic cluster is reduced with diborane to give the neutral product:
:K[BrB5H7] + 1/2 B2H6 → KBr + B6H10
It can also be generated by pyrolysis of pentaborane(11).

B6H10 can be deprotonated to give [B6H9]− or protonated to give [B6H11]+. It can act as a Lewis base towards reactive borane radicals, forming various &quot;conjuncto&quot;-clusters.

<text>The National Lacrosse Hall of Fame and Museum, is located in Sparks, Maryland, at the USA Lacrosse headquarters. Prior to moving to its present location in 2016, the hall of fame and museum was located in Baltimore, Maryland, on the Homewood campus of Johns Hopkins University. The museum showcases the history of the game of lacrosse, from its Native American origins to its present-day form.

The first members of the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame were inducted in 1957. The museum displays photographs, art, vintage equipment and uniforms, trophies, as well as other memorabilia and artifacts relating to the sport of lacrosse.

<doc id="1226420" wikidata="Q3696032" url="?curid=1226420" title="Kentucky State Capitol">
<text>The Kentucky State Capitol is located in Frankfort and is the house of the three branches (executive, legislative, judicial) of the state government of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==

===Previous buildings===
From 1792 to 1830, two buildings were used as the capitol, both of which burned completely.

In 1830, another capitol was built and was used until 1910. During a bitterly contested 1899 state governor election, Democratic Party claimant William Goebel was assassinated at the capitol on his way to be inaugurated. The need for a larger building for a growing state government resulted in the replacement of that capitol building, which is now a museum operated by the Kentucky Historical Society.

===Current 1910 building===
In 1904, the Kentucky General Assembly chose Frankfort (rather than Lexington or Louisville) as the location for the state capital and appropriated $1 million for the construction of a permanent state capitol building, to be located in southern Frankfort. The official ground-breaking was August 14, 1905 and construction was completed in 1909 at a cost of $1,180,434.80. The building was dedicated on June 2, 1910.

The capitol was designed by Frank Mills Andrews, a distinguished and award-winning architect. He used the Beaux-Arts style and included many classical French interior designs. The staircases, for example, are replicas of those of the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
Between 1912 and 1963, five statues of historical figures from Kentucky were erected in the rotunda of the capitol. The first was a bronze statue of Abraham Lincoln, which was donated in 1912. Statues of Henry Clay and Ephraim McDowell were added in 1930. Both of these are the bronzed plaster models used for the bronze statues that represent Kentucky in the National Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. In 1936, a marble statue of Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederate States of America, was placed in the rotunda. The statue of Davis was paid for by both donations and public funds, and erected under the auspices of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The Kentucky General Assembly voted to fund a bronze statue of Alben Barkley, former Vice President of the United States, and it was added to the rotunda in 1963.

In 2018, a plaque in front of the statue of Jefferson Davis, which referred to Davis as a &quot;patriot&quot; and a &quot;hero&quot;, was removed by the Kentucky Historic Properties Commission. On June 4, 2020, Governor Andy Beshear stated that he believed the statue of Davis should be removed. On June 13, 2020, the Kentucky Historic Properties Commission voted 11–1 to remove the statue from the Capitol. The Davis statue was to be moved to the Jefferson Davis Monument State Historic Site situated in Fairview, Kentucky, the birthplace of Davis.

In November 2022, a bronze statue of Nettie Depp by Amanda Matthews, Depp&#x27;s great-great niece, was unveiled inside that capitol. It is the first permanent large-scale monument of a woman inside the state capitol. While Nettie&#x27;s influence was not statewide, the Historic Properties Advisory Commission considered her a representative example of Kentucky women who achieved professional and personal success. The statue&#x27;s unveiling occurred in November 2022.
==Layout==

The main part of the Capitol has three floors. The first floor contains the offices of the governor (and his or her staff), lieutenant governor, secretary of state, and attorney general. It also features a rotunda with statues of famous Kentuckians and other exhibits, including Kentucky Women Remembered.

The rotunda contains four statues of notable historical figures from Kentucky. In the center of the rotunda stands a bronze statue of President Abraham Lincoln. Three more statues line the walls of the rotunda: bronze statues of Henry Clay, Vice President Alben Barkley, and Ephraim McDowell.

The second floor contains the courtroom of the state Supreme Court, as well as the chambers of the justices. The state law library is nearby. The State Reception Room is also located on the second floor.

The chambers of the House of Representatives and Senate face each other on opposite ends of the third floor. Some high-level legislative offices (such as for the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate) are also located there.

The Capitol also has a partial fourth floor which houses the galleries of the House and Senate, as well as a few offices for legislative committee staffers.

In addition, there is a partially buried basement level with mostly offices for clerks and maintenance personnel. However, it also contains a small gift shop and lunch counter as well as a tunnel to the neighboring Capitol Annex building. The Annex houses General Assembly committee rooms, General Assembly members offices and a cafeteria.

==Security==
The Capitol used to be completely open during normal business hours, and local residents often used the marble hallways for exercise (the Frankfort equivalent of &quot;mall walking&quot;). Currently, anyone without proper state credentials must go through a metal detector. Security for the complex is provided by officers from the Facilities Security Branch of the Kentucky State Police along with specifically assigned state troopers.

There have been two separate generations of trams in London, from 1860 to 1952 and from 2000 to the present. There were no trams at all in London between 1952 and 2000.

== History ==

=== Horse trams ===

The first generation of trams in London started in March 1861 when a horse tramway began operating between Marble Arch and Notting Hill Gate. This was followed a month later by a route along Victoria Street in Westminster. 
These first lines were operated by an American entrpreneur, George Francis Train. Initially, there was strong opposition as, although it was popular with its passengers, the first designs had rails that stood proud of the road surface and created an obstruction for other traffic. This came to a head in 1861 when Train was arrested for &quot;breaking and injuring&quot; the Uxbridge Road and his plans were put on hold.

Eventually Parliament passed legislation permitting tram services, on the condition that the rails were recessed into the carriageway and that the tramways were shared with other road users. Costs of maintenance of the tramway and its immediate neighbouring road carriageway would be borne by the tram companies, thus benefiting the ratepayers, who had been bearing the full cost of highway repairs since the abolition of turnpikes. Fares were set at 1d (1 penny) per mile, with half-price early and late workmen&#x27;s services. After a demonstration line was built at the Crystal Palace, the first lines authorised by the Act of Parliament in 1870 ran from:
* Blackheath to Vauxhall via Peckham and Camberwell
* Brixton joining the Camberwell line at Kennington
* Whitechapel to Bow
* Kensington to Oxford Street

The new tram companies all adopted the same standard gauge, with the intention of being able to link up services at later dates. Horse tram lines soon opened all over London, typically using two horses to pull a 60-person car. They proved popular as they were cheaper, smoother, roomier and safer than the competing Omnibus or Hackney carriages. Replacement by electric vehicles commenced in 1901; the last horse-drawn trams were withdrawn in 1915.

=== Powered trams ===
There were several early attempts to run motor-powered trams on the London tramlines: John Grantham first trialled an experimental steam tramcar in London in 1873 but withdrew it after it performed poorly. From 1885, the North London Tramways Company operated 25 Merryweather and Dick, Kerr steam engines hauling long-wheelbase Falcon Engine &amp; Car Works trailers, until its liquidation in 1891. Although several towns and cities adopted steam trams, the problems associated with track weight, acceleration, noise and power held back their general acceptance in London.

Between 1881 and 1883, a small number of trams powered by compressed air were trialled on the Caledonian Road tramway.

In 1884, a cable tram was introduced for Highgate Hill, the first cable tramway in Europe, which was followed by a second cable line to draw trams up Brixton Hill to Streatham. Both these systems were replaced within 15 years by electric trams.

The electric tram took some decades to establish itself in London. After the storage battery was invented, an electric tram was tested on the West Metropolitan Tramways line between Acton and Kew in 1883 but it was not until 1901 that Croydon Corporation introduced the first fully operational electric tram services in the Greater London area, using power delivered from overhead wires. Meanwhile, Imperial Tramways, under the directorship of James Clifton Robinson, had acquired the worn-out tram network in West London, which it renovated and extended from Shepherds Bush to Acton, Ealing, Chiswick and Uxbridge, as the London United Tramways Company, using overhead electrification throughout and its own network of ornate power stations, starting with Chiswick.

=== Underground trams ===

There were plans to run an underground tram line between South Kensington and the Albert Hall but it was withdrawn in 1891 and a pedestrian only route, the South Kensington subway, was built instead. The Kingsway tramway subway did go ahead - this started in 1902 going from Theobalds Road to the Victoria Embankment. In the 1930s, the arched tunnels were removed to accommodate double decker trams. The last tram using the subway system ran on the night of 5/6 April 1952.
=== First electric trams ===

After the slow start, electric trams rapidly became very popular; by 1903, there were 300 electric tramcars in London, which carried 800,000 passengers over Whitsun weekend in 1903. The London County Council Tramways first electric line opened in May 1903 between Westminster Bridge and Tooting and the LCC sold 3.3 million tickets in its third year of business, five times the traffic carried by its horse trams. The LCC saw the electric trams as a way of driving social change, as its cheap, fast service could encourage workers to move out of the crowded inner city and live healthier lives in the suburbs. Soon other London boroughs introduced their own electric services, including West Ham, Leyton, Dartford and Bexley. Although the City of London and the West End of London never gave permission for tram lines to be built, trams were allowed to use the Victoria Embankment and cross the Thames over Westminster and Blackfriars Bridges; on 14 September 1909, Lord Mayor George Wyatt Truscott opened the widened Blackfriars Bridge and drove the first tram across it.

By 1914, the London tram operators formed the largest tram network in Europe but the onset of World War I saw a halt in the expansion of the trams and thousands of conductors left to join the armed forces to be replaced by &quot;substitute&quot; women conductors known as &#x27;conductorettes&#x27; (A tram driver, like an omnibus driver, was deemed as a reserved occupation as it was considered that women did not have the physical capability of operating the heavy electrical controller or the brakes. Also, the tram driver was in an exposed position as the trams did not have windscreens, because the Metropolitan Police considered them dangerous).

Several different companies and municipalities operated London&#x27;s electric tramways. The largest was the LCC, with lines equipped with conduit current collection. Other operators mainly used the more conventional overhead electric wires. Many of London&#x27;s trams had to be equipped with both systems of electricity supply, with routes being equipped with change points. The overhead wires were made of copper, which weighed half a pound a foot.

During their heyday, tram services covered much of inner London and reached out to the suburbs, assisted by facilities like the Kingsway tramway subway, which enabled the longest tram route entirely within the County of London to operate: a weekend service between Archway, then part of Highgate, and Downham via Brockley, .

Route coverage might have been wider still but the terms of the 1870 Act meant that the passage of new tramways had to be negotiated individually with local authorities, who would sometimes impose prohibitively expensive improvement works as a condition of approval. Passengers had to make a hazardous journey into the middle of the street before they could board a tram.

After the War, money for investment and maintenance became harder to find, as passengers migrated to the new motor bus services. In the 1930s, The London United and Metropolitan Electric companies purchased a large fleet of modern double-deck Feltham trams, built by the Union Construction Company at Feltham. LUT accompanied this change by introducing electric trolleybuses using twin overhead wires as a cheaper alternative for of its routes in 1931.

A Royal Commission on Transport, held between 1928 and 1931, ensured that the tram companies retained complete responsibility for the maintenance of its rails and highway, which was shared with other road users who contributed its wear. But this was accompanied by Parliamentary bills in 1930 and 1933 that set up the London Passenger Transport Board to operate the LCC&#x27;s existing bus and London Underground service and to purchase and manage all of London&#x27;s tramways. Under the LPTB, there was no new investment in tram services and the maintenance of services became a hot political issue in elections in South London, an area poorly served by Underground trains. The merged tram services were held back from introducing new, quieter and more comfortable track and vehicles, in favour of trolleybus services and tubes provided under the New Works Programme. Although the trams returned gross annual revenues of £850,000 (equivalent to £ in ), the net surplus was £128,000 (equivalent to £ in ), after costs were taken by the LCC, partly to repay the debt of £18m resulting from the merger.

=== Abandonment ===
At this time, trams were starting to be considered out-dated and inflexible and the phasing-out and replacement by diesel buses or trolleybuses started in earnest around 1935, when a large proportion of the trams and of the tracks and ancillary equipment were nearing the end of their useful life. Replacement continued until hostilities stopped the conversion programme in June 1940, leaving only the South London trams and the routes that went through the Kingsway subway into North London. After World War II, shortages of steel and electrical machinery were cited as reasons for not investing in maintenance, while the LCC reported that the service ran at a loss.
On 15 November 1946 the London Passenger Transport Board announced that the remaining trams in London would be replaced by diesel buses, stated as being &quot;eminently flexible and much cheaper&quot;. (London Transport Tramways Handbook, Willoughby and Oakley 1972). The market for trams became smaller as other tramways were being forced to close at that time, as the 1948 nationalisation of electricity suppliers removed access to cheap electricity for those undertakings which owned their local power company.

Alexander Valentine, one of the five full-time members of the London Transport Executive, saw trams as a major cause of road congestion, which would be relieved by the introduction of buses, with the aesthetic benefit of doing away with overhead wires and their noisy operation. A report in The Economist in 1952 suggested a more comprehensive list of reasons for their demise, including:
* the 1870 Tramways Act, which placed a great financial burden on the operator for road maintenance even though it was not responsible for all the wear;
* London had streets that were too narrow, unlike continental cities;
* London&#x27;s housing developments were too far away from tram routes;
* authorities were prejudiced against trams (Lord Ashfield, chairman of the LPTB, was a constant opponent of trams).

The capital cost of replacing and updating the worn-out infrastructure and trams was also seen as prohibitive when compared with the £9 m capital cost of buying buses with a slightly smaller carrying capacity.

&quot;Operation Tramaway&quot;, the replacement of the tram service by diesel buses, was announced in July 1950 by Lord Latham of the London Transport Executive. Retirement started in October 1950 and London&#x27;s final first-generation trams ran in the early hours of 6 July 1952 to a rousing reception at New Cross Depot.

No general improvement in traffic flow was seen after the trams were withdrawn.

During the closure cycle of London&#x27;s tram system, almost 100 of the most modern trams known as the &quot;Feltham&quot; class and dating from 1931 were withdrawn and sold to Leeds where they continued in service until the abandonment of that city&#x27;s trams in 1959. Some London tramcars have been preserved on static display at London&#x27;s Transport Museum (in Covent Garden) and in working order at the National Tramway Museum at Crich, Derbyshire. A working London tram can also be seen and ridden on at the East Anglia Transport Museum in Carlton Colville near Lowestoft, Suffolk.

== Current trams ==

The current generation of trams started with the opening of Tramlink in 2000. 
Croydon previously had many tramlines. The first to close was Addiscombe – East Croydon Station route through George Street to Cherry Orchard Road in 1927 and the last Purley - Embankment and Croydon (Coombe Road) - Thornton Heath routes closed in April 1951. However, in spring 1950, the Highways Committee was presented by the Mayor with the concept of running trams between East Croydon station and the new estate being constructed at New Addington. This was based on the fact that the Feltham cars used in Croydon were going to Leeds to serve their new estates on reserved tracks. In 1962 a private study, with assistance from BR engineers, showed how easy it was to convert the West Croydon - Wimbledon train service to tram operation and successfully prevent conflict between trams and trains. These two concepts became joined in joint LRTL/TLRS concept of New Addington to Wimbledon every 15 mins via East and West Croydon and Mitcham plus New Addington to Tattenham Corner every 15 mins via East and West Croydon, Sutton and Epsom Downs. A branch into Forestdale to give an overlap service from Sutton was also included. During the 1970s, several BR directors and up-and-coming managers were aware of the advantages. In fact, Peter Parker was very well aware of this even before becoming chairman. Chris Green, upon becoming managing director, Network South East, published his plans in 1987 expanding the concept to take in the Tattenham Corner and Caterham branches and provide a service from Croydon to Lewisham via Addiscombe and Hayes. Working with Tony Ridley, then managing director, London Transport, the scheme was brought out into the open, and Scott Mackintosh was appointed Light Rail Manager in 1989.

The scheme was accepted in principle in February 1990 by Croydon Council, which worked with what was then London Regional Transport (LRT) to propose Tramlink to Parliament, resulting in the Croydon Tramlink Act 1994 giving LRT the legal power to build and run Tramlink. The new Act still incorporated major parts of the 1870 Tramways Act which had held back previous private tram companies. However, as most of the routes affected were managed by the same authority, the obligation to maintain the road surface was not a new cost.

Tramlink operates with modern articulated tramcars of Bombardier low-floor design called &quot;CR4000&quot;, based upon the &quot;K4000&quot; type of the Cologne Stadtbahn, with the tram units numbered from 2530. This number was the next in sequence from the last London tram, number 2529, withdrawn in 1952.
Since it opened on 11 May 2000, the 38 km of track have been operated by FirstGroup on behalf of Transport for London on three routes across South London. 
It features accessible low platforms that match the 350 mm high car floor or tram stops at the same height as the pavement. Much of the track is dedicated tramway, with some sections shared with other road vehicles, including some of the same roads served by the previous generation of trams. The off-street track includes new rights-of-way, adapted former railway lines and one section running alongside a Network Rail line. Part of the formation between Mitcham and Hackbridge was originally used by the Surrey Iron Railway, the world&#x27;s first public railway, authorised by Act of Parliament in 1803.

== Future ==
New tram systems and extensions to existing tram lines have been discussed or planned:
* Tramlink extensions linking the Croydon-Beckenham route from Harrington Road up Anerley Hill to Crystal Palace, using an existing rail right of way. Previous schemes have considered extensions to Purley, Streatham and Tooting Also, Beckenham extension to Lewisham had been previously mooted.
* West London Tram from Shepherd&#x27;s Bush to Uxbridge. This scheme was &quot;put on hold&quot; after the approval of Crossrail

Two more tram systems were planned but their development has been abandoned:

* Cross River Tram linking Kings Cross and Camden to Peckham and Brixton
* In the lead-up to the 2008 mayoral election, Ken Livingstone proposed an Oxford Street Tram that would run along Oxford Street from Marble Arch to Tottenham Court Road. It would have been tied into plans to pedestrianise Oxford Street and Marble Arch, funded through property development. Construction would have begun in 2012 with completion in 2018

=== Sutton Link Extension ===

* The Sutton Link is a proposed tram line in South London, aiming to connect Colliers Wood to Sutton via St Helier. Initially proposed in the early 2000s, public consultations on the route were held in the late 2010s. A preferred route was announced in February 2020. However, financial constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic led Transport for London to suspend the project in July 2020. Despite being included in the London Plan, the project faced further delays in 2023 due to a &quot;weak business case&quot; and a lack of funding.

<doc id="1226427" wikidata="Q148633" url="?curid=1226427" title="Galium">
<text>Galium is a large genus of annual and perennial herbaceous plants in the family Rubiaceae, occurring in the temperate zones of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Some species are informally known as bedstraw.

There are over 600 species of &quot;Galium&quot;, with estimates of 629 to 650 as of 2013. The field madder, &quot;Sherardia arvensis&quot;, is a close relative and may be confused with a tiny bedstraw. &quot;Asperula&quot; is also a closely related genus; some species of &quot;Galium&quot; (such as woodruff, &quot;G. odoratum&quot;) are occasionally placed therein.

==Genetic variability==

The phenotypic plasticity and genetic variability of this species allows it to be constantly shifting to best fit its environment adjusting life cycles, seed germination, productivity, growth form, freezing tolerance, etc. Herbicides at the recommended amount is not effective enough to decrease catchweed bedstraw biomass or population, twice the amount is needed.

==As invasive species==

Cattle and other livestock don&#x27;t often feed on this plant making it thrive and dominating over other species. &quot;G. mollugo&quot; in particular, is a thriving invasive species since it can go in and dominate in areas where other alien species wouldn&#x27;t be able to, growing very fast in best conditions.

<text>David Leonard Congdon (born 16 October 1949) is a former British Conservative Party politician. He was the member of parliament (MP) for Croydon North East, South London from 1992 to 1997.

== Political career ==
Congdon had served as a councillor for many years and served as Deputy Leader of Croydon Council. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the 1992 general selection, succeeding the outgoing speaker Bernard Weatherill who was retiring from the Commons.

The Croydon seats were reorganised ahead of the 1997 general election, with the loss of one seat. Congdon competed against Sir Paul Beresford, then-MP for Croydon Central, for the Conservative Party nomination for the new merged seat and won. He then lost in the ensuing election in 1997 to Labour&#x27;s Geraint Davies. Sir Paul Beresford, meanwhile, successfully contested Mole Valley and continued as an MP.

Congdon stood once again against Geraint Davies at the 2001 general election and lost. He then worked for MENCAP, and did not stand again at the 2005 election, when the Conservative candidate Andrew Pelling recaptured the seat from Davies.

== Personal life ==
Congdon is now retired and lives, with his wife Theresa, in Old Coulsdon. He has one daughter Rebecca and two grandchildren.

Whilst leading the 1961 World Drivers&#x27; Championship, having taken his maiden victories at the Dutch and British Grands Prix, von Trips died as a result of an accident during the at Monza. After a collision with Jim Clark, von Trips lost control of his Ferrari 156, fatally wounding himself and 15 spectators as his car went airborne. Ferrari withdrew from the remaining —having already won the World Constructors&#x27; Championship—with teammate Phil Hill taking the title by one point to von Trips.

==Early life and family==
The son of a noble Rhineland family, von Trips was born in Cologne, in the Rhine Province, which at the time was part of the Free State of Prussia during the years of the Weimar Republic. He was an aristocrat and count. Regarding personal names, &quot;Graf&quot; is a German title, translated as Count, not a first or middle name; the feminine form is &quot;Gräfin&quot;. Von Trips grew up in a Romantic-moated castle in Horrem (now a district of Kerpen), Cologne. The inheritance of his parents, the castle, and the agricultural and fruit-growing possessions weighted heavily on the young von Trips, who one day had to take sole responsibility for all these lands. From 1951 onwards, he struggled to train to become a qualified farmer as his true passion was racing.

==Formula One and sports car driver career==

Von Trips had diabetes during his career and he always had high sugar snacks during the races to compensate for his low blood sugar levels. Von Trips participated in 29 Formula One World Championship Grand Prix races, debuting on 2 September 1956. He won two races, secured one pole position, achieved six podiums, and scored a total of 56 championship points. Friends and fellow draws gave him the &quot;Taffy&quot; nickname.

Von Trips sustained a concussion when he spun off track at the Nürburgring during trial runs for a sports car race held in May 1957. His Ferrari was destroyed. It was the only one of its marque to be entered in the Gran Turismo car class of larger than 1600 cc. Von Trips was forced out of a Royal Automobile Club Grand Prix at Silverstone, in July 1958, when his Ferrari came into the pits on the 60th lap with no oil. The following August, he was fifth at Porto in the 1958 Portuguese Grand Prix, which was won by Stirling Moss in a Vanwall. Von Trips completed 49 laps and was one lap behind at the finish. Moss was more than five minutes ahead of Mike Hawthorn, who finished second in a Ferrari.
In July 1960, von Trips was victorious in a Formula Two event in a Ferrari, with a newly introduced engine in the rear. The race was in Stuttgart and was called the Solitude Formula Two Grand Prix. It was a 20-lap event with the winner averaging over . He won the Targa Florio, 10-lap race, in May 1961. Von Trips achieved an average speed of in his Ferrari with Olivier Gendebien of Belgium as his co-driver. Von Trips and Phil Hill traded the lead at Spa, Belgium, during the 1961 Belgian Grand Prix. Hill led most of the way in front of a crowd of 100,000 people. Ferraris captured the first four places at the race conclusion with von Trips finishing second. The Formula One World Championship driver competition at this juncture in 1961 was led by Hill with 19 points followed by von Trips with 18.

In 1961, von Trips established a go-kart race track in Kerpen, Germany. The track was later leased by Rolf Schumacher, whose sons, Michael and Ralf, made their first laps there. In the words of a 2007 German documentary film about von Trips, &quot;If he had won then, he would have become as famous as Michael Schumacher later was – it would have been a kind of second miracle in Bern!&quot;

==Death==
The 1961 Italian Grand Prix on 10 September saw von Trips tightly locked in the battle for the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship that year with his American teammate Phil Hill. On the second lap of the race at Monza, his Ferrari collided with Jim Clark&#x27;s Lotus on the long straight before Parabolica, approaching what is now Curva Alboreto; he had made contact with Clark while he was trying to overtake him, which caused him to lose control of his car and went straight into the crowd at high speed. His car became airborne and crashed into a side barrier, fatally throwing von Trips from the car, and killing fifteen spectators. Von Trips died before reaching hospital. The toll of the accident remains the worst in the history of Formula One. As a result of the accident, the FIA banned Formula One from competing on circuits with steeply-banked corners.

Clark and his car were subjected to an investigation; he was initially accused of manslaughter, before the charges were dropped. At the time, Clark described the accident by saying: &quot;Von Trips and I were racing along the straightaway and were nearing one of the banked curves, the one on the southern end. We were about 100 metres from the beginning of the curve. Von Trips was running close to the inside of the track. I was closely following him, keeping near the outside. At one point von Trips shifted sideways so that my front wheels collided with his back wheels. It was the fatal moment. Von Trips&#x27;s car spun twice and went into the guardrail along the inside of the track. Then it bounced back, struck my own car and bounced down into the crowd.&quot; Movie footage of the crash that surfaced after the race showed that Clark&#x27;s memory of the incident was inaccurate; after colliding with Clark, von Trips&#x27;s car rode directly up an embankment on the outside of the track and struck a fence behind which spectators were closely packed. At the time of his death, von Trips was leading the Formula One World Championship. He had previous incidents at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza, where he crashed cars in the 1956 Italian Grand Prix and the 1958 Italian Grand Prix, and was injured in both events.

<text>Stewart Grand Prix was a Formula One constructor and racing team founded by triple Formula One champion Jackie Stewart and his son Paul Stewart in 1996. The team competed in F1, as the Ford works-supported team, for only three seasons, from 1997 to 1999. The 1999 season was by far its strongest, yielding one win (Johnny Herbert at the ) and one pole position (Rubens Barrichello at the ) en route to finishing fourth overall in the Constructors Championship.

At the end of 1999, Ford bought the team outright and it was renamed Jaguar Racing. In 2004 Jaguar Racing was sold to energy drink company Red Bull GmbH and was rebranded Red Bull Racing in .

==Origins==
The team&#x27;s origins are traced back to the end of 1988 when Jackie Stewart&#x27;s son Paul set up Paul Stewart Racing, having bought the Gary Evans Motorsport Team. This team entered the 1989 British Formula 3 season with a workforce of 10 employees. The team attracted the sponsor Camel. Paul Stewart drove the car alongside German Otto Rensing. The team had a single win with Stewart at Snetterton. In 1990, the team expanded with a move to new headquarters in Milton Keynes, and was divided into three sections; preparation for European Formula 3000, Formula 3 and Formula Vauxhall Lotus. Within a few years, the team enjoyed success, winning 12 titles and 119 races in various categories.

In late 1995, Stewart Racing expressed disinterest in moving up to F1, considering that short-lived entries Simtek, Pacific and Forti either had folded or looked likely to fold. This position was reversed in January 1996 when Jackie Stewart secured a five-year development deal with Ford to make it a factory team. Before, Ford had been in a deal as a factory engine supplier to Sauber. The team gained finance from Malaysia as a promotion for the country in general. Stewart were in consultation with John Barnard about a business plan with a budget of £24 million.

==Racing history==
===1997===

The first car, named the Stewart SF01 was launched on 19 December 1996. With factory backing from Ford as well as free engines, Stewart Grand Prix entered the 1997 Australian Grand Prix with drivers Rubens Barrichello and Jan Magnussen. The only success of their first year came at the rain-affected where Barrichello finished second. Magnussen in the second car finished just outside the points in seventh after losing his front wing at the chicane. Elsewhere, the cars were consistent midfield runners and Barrichello was often in a position to challenge for points. Stewart&#x27;s reliability was poor, as the Ford Zetec-R V10 engine installed in the SF01 chassis proved to be powerful, yet extremely fragile. This restricted the team to just eight classified finishes out of a possible thirty-four. Stewart finished the season in ninth place in the constructors&#x27; championship with six points, ahead of other established teams like Tyrrell and Minardi.

===1998===

For the next year, the team developed the Stewart SF02, hoping to improve results and score regular points as well as some more podiums. However it turned out that 1998 was also a struggle for the team, with neither driver able to step onto the podium. Indeed, even points were hard to come by. The first came at the hands of Barrichello in Spain with a fifth place finish. The only highlight of the season came two rounds later with a double points finish in Canada where Barrichello and Magnussen finished fifth and sixth respectively. After a number of poor drives, Magnussen was replaced mid season by Dutchman Jos Verstappen from the French Grand Prix onward. Ironically it was the race after Magnussen scored his first and only world championship point. Both drivers did not score any more points for the rest of the season. Despite this and scoring one point less than the year before, Stewart finished the season eighth in the constructors&#x27; championship, one place better than in 1997.

In the end the driver change did not make a great difference as Verstappen also struggled with the car. Unhappy with the team, Verstappen left Stewart at the end of the season and was replaced by Johnny Herbert for the next year.

At the end of the 1998 season, technical director Alan Jenkins left Stewart Grand Prix, and was replaced by Jordan&#x27;s Gary Anderson.

===1999===

After Ford acquired Cosworth in July 1998, they risked designing and building a brand-new engine for 1999. The Stewart SF3 was quick out of the box, however both cars over-heated on the grid of the first race, the Australian Grand Prix, after qualifying competitively. This put Herbert out instantly and made Barrichello start from the pit lane. Barrichello received a stop-go penalty during the race and finished fifth. The car was consistently competitive throughout the season, however the engine initially proved fragile as both cars blew their engines at the Brazilian race which meant the engine was rarely run at full power. Stewart&#x27;s competitiveness was affirmed by running first in Brazil for a long spell of the race and qualifying on pole for the French Grand Prix with Barrichello. Johnny Herbert won a popular victory at the rain soaked 1999 European Grand Prix at the new Nürburgring after other leading contenders crashed off the track or lost time in the pits changing tyres. Barrichello finished third, in a result most observers indicated that Stewart deserved given their strength over the season. Herbert also became unwittingly influential in the championship at the next and penultimate race, the Malaysian Grand Prix. Running third behind the Ferraris of Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine, a mistake in the closing laps allowed Mika Häkkinen to slip past and claim the final podium position which gave the championship contender vital points. The Ferraris were disqualified for car irregularities and the win allowed Häkkinen to gain his second championship. The Stewarts as a result finished second and third in the race. However Ferrari won an appeal and the initial result was reinstated. Häkkinen however went on to win the championship later in Japan and Stewart came fourth in the constructors&#x27; championship with 36 points, beating teams such as Williams and Benetton. Stewart&#x27;s last race was the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix.

After Ford increased its commitment by buying the team out, it became known as Jaguar Racing for the 2000 season. Disappointing results however, led to the team being sold for the 2005 season, becoming Red Bull Racing.

<text>El Filibusterismo (; &quot;The Subversive&quot; or &quot;The Subversion&quot;, as in the Locsín English translation, are also possible translations), also known by its alternative English title The Reign of Greed, is the second novel written by Philippine national hero José Rizal. It is the sequel to &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot; and, like the first book, was written in Spanish. It was first published in 1891 in Ghent.

The novel centers on the &quot;Noli-El Fili&quot; duology&#x27;s main character Crisóstomo Ibarra, now returning for vengeance as &quot;Simoun&quot;. The novel&#x27;s dark theme departs dramatically from the previous novel&#x27;s hopeful and romantic atmosphere, signifying Ibarra&#x27;s resort to solving his country&#x27;s issues through violent means, after his previous attempt in reforming the country&#x27;s system made no effect and seemed impossible with the corrupt attitude of the Spaniards toward the Filipinos.

The novel, along with its predecessor, was banned in some parts of the Philippines as a result of their portrayals of the Spanish government&#x27;s abuses and corruption. These novels, along with Rizal&#x27;s involvement in organizations that aimed to address and reform the Spanish system and its issues, led to Rizal&#x27;s exile to Dapitan and eventual execution. Both the novel and its predecessor, along with Rizal&#x27;s last poem, are now considered Rizal&#x27;s literary masterpieces.

Both of Rizal&#x27;s novels had a profound effect on Philippine society in terms of views about national identity, the Catholic faith and its influence on the Filipino&#x27;s choice, and the government&#x27;s issues in corruption, abuse of power, and discrimination, and on a larger scale, the issues related to the effect of colonization on people&#x27;s lives and the cause for independence. These novels later on indirectly became the inspiration to start the Philippine Revolution.

Throughout the Philippines, the reading of both the novel and its predecessor is now mandatory for high school students throughout the archipelago, although it is now read using English, Filipino, and the Philippines&#x27; regional languages.

==Plot==
In the events of the previous novel, Crisóstomo Ibarra, a reform-minded &quot;mestizo&quot; who tried to establish a modern school in his hometown of San Diego and marry his childhood sweetheart, was falsely accused of rebellion and presumed dead after a shootout following his escape from prison. Elías, his friend who was also a reformer, sacrificed his life to give Crisóstomo a chance to regain his treasure and flee the country, and hopefully continue their crusade for reforms from abroad. After a thirteen-year absence from the country, a more revolutionary Crisóstomo has returned, having taken the identity of Simoun, a mysterious wealthy jeweler whose objective is to drive the government to commit as much abuse as possible in order to drive people into revolution.

Simoun goes from town to town presumably to sell his jewels. Reaching San Diego, he detours to the Ibarras&#x27; forested land to retrieve more of his treasures buried in the mausoleum. There, his true identity as Crisóstomo Ibarra is discovered by a now-grown Basilio, who was also in the mausoleum visiting his mother&#x27;s grave. In the years since the death of his mother, Basilio had been serving as Capitán Tiago&#x27;s servant in exchange for being allowed to study, and is now an aspiring doctor on his last year at university as well as administrator and apparent heir to Capitán Tiago&#x27;s wealth. Simoun reveals his motives to Basilio and offers him a place in his plans. Too secure of his place in the world, Basilio declines.

At Barrio Sagpang in the town of Tiani, Simoun stays at the house of the village&#x27;s &quot;cabeza de barangay&quot;, Tales. Having suffered misfortune after misfortune in recent years, Kabesang Tales is unable to resist the temptation to steal Simoun&#x27;s revolver and join the bandits. In Los Baños, Simoun joins his friend, the Captain-General, who is then taking a break from a hunting excursion. In a friendly game of cards with him and his cronies, Simoun raises the stakes higher and higher and half-jokingly secures blank orders for deportation, imprisonment, and summary execution from the Captain-General.

Later on, Simoun goes to Manila and meets Quiroga, a wealthy Chinese businessman and aspiring consul-general for the Chinese empire. Knowing Quiroga is heavily in his debt, Simoun offers him a steep discount if the former stores his massive arsenal of rifles in Quiroga&#x27;s warehouses, to be used presumably for extortion activities with Manila&#x27;s elite. Despite his hatred of guns and weaponry, Quiroga reluctantly agrees to do the job and uses his bazaar as a front.

During the Quiapo Fair, a talking heads exhibit ostensibly organized by an American named Mr. Leeds but secretly commissioned by Simoun is drawing popular acclaim. Padre Bernardo Salví, now chaplain of the Convent of the Poor Clares, attends one of the performances. The exhibit is set in Ptolemaic Egypt but features a tale that closely resembled that of Crisóstomo Ibarra and María Clara, and their fate under Salví. The show ends with an ominous vow of revenge. Deeply overcome with guilt and fear, Salví recommends the show be banned, but not before Mr. Leeds sailed for Hong Kong.

Months pass and the night of Simoun&#x27;s revolution comes. Simoun visits Basilio in Tiago&#x27;s house and tries to convince him again to join his revolution. He reveals his plan for the attack: a cannon volley shall be fired, at which point Kabesang Tales, now a bandit identifying himself as Matanglawin, and Simoun, who managed to deceive and recruit a sizable rogue force among the government troops, will lead their forces into the city. The leaders of the Church, the University, scores of bureaucrats, the Captain-General himself, as well as the bulk of officers guarding them are all conveniently located in one place, the theater where a controversial and much-hyped performance of &quot;Les cloches de Corneville&quot; is taking place. While Simoun and Matanglawin direct their forces, Basilio and several others are to raid the Convent of the Poor Clares and rescue María Clara.

However, Basilio reports to Simoun that María Clara died just that afternoon, after suffering the travails of monastic life under Salví, who always lusted after her. Simoun, driven by grief, aborts the attack and becomes crestfallen throughout the night. It will be reported later on that he suffered an &quot;accident&quot; that night, leaving him confined to his bed. 

The following day, posters threatening violence to the leaders of the university and the government are found at the university doors. A reform-oriented student group to which Basilio belonged is named the primary suspects; the members are arrested, including Basilio, despite his absence from the group&#x27;s mock dinner the night before. They are eventually freed through the intercession of relatives, except for Basilio who is an orphan and has no means to pay for his freedom. During his imprisonment, he learns that Capitán Tiago has died, leaving him with nothing; it is revealed that Tiago&#x27;s will was actually forged by his spiritual advisor Padre Írene, who also supplied him with opium; his childhood sweetheart Juli has committed suicide to avoid getting raped by parish priest Camorra when she tried asking for help on Basilio&#x27;s behalf; and that he has missed his graduation and will be required to study for another year, but now with no funds to go by. Released through the intercession of Simoun, a darkened, disillusioned Basilio joins Simoun&#x27;s cause wholeheartedly.

Simoun, meanwhile, has been organizing a new revolution, and he reveals his plans to a now committed Basilio. The wedding of Juanito Peláez and Paulita Gómez will be used to coordinate the attack upon the city. As the Peláez and Gómez families are prominent members of the Manila elite, leaders of the church and civil government are invited to the reception. The Captain-General, who declined to extend his tenure despite Simoun&#x27;s urging, is leaving in two days and is the guest of honor. 

Simoun will personally deliver a pomegranate-shaped crystal lamp as a wedding gift. The lamp is to be placed on a plinth at the reception venue and will be bright enough to illuminate the entire hall, which was also walled with mirrors. After some time the light will flicker as if to go out. When someone attempts to raise the wick, a mechanism hidden within the lamp containing fulminated mercury will detonate, igniting the lamp which is actually filled with nitroglycerin, killing everyone in an enormous blast.

At the sound of the explosion, Simoun&#x27;s mercenaries will attack, reinforced by Matanglawin and his bandits who will descend upon the city from the surrounding hills. Simoun postulates that in the chaos, the masses, already worked to a panic by the government&#x27;s heavy-handed response to the poster incident, as well as rumors of German ships in the bay to lend their firepower to any uprising against the Spanish government, will step out in desperation to kill or be killed. Basilio and a few others are to put themselves at their head and lead them to Quiroga&#x27;s warehouses, where Simoun&#x27;s guns are still being kept. The plan thus finalized, Simoun gives Basilio a loaded revolver and sends him away to await further instructions. 

Basilio walks the streets for hours and passes by his old home, Capitán Tiago&#x27;s riverside house on Anloague Street. He discovers that this was to be the reception venue – Juanito Peláez&#x27;s father bought Tiago&#x27;s house as a gift for the newlywed couple. Sometime later, he sees Simoun enter the house with the lamp, then hastily exit the house and board his carriage. Basilio begins to move away but sees Isagani, his friend and Paulita Gómez&#x27;s former lover, sadly looking at Paulita through the window. Noting how close they were to the condemned house, Basilio tries to head Isagani off, but Isagani was too dazed with grief to listen to him. In desperation, Basilio reveals to Isagani how the house is set to explode at any time then. But when Isagani still refuses to heed him, Basilio flees, leaving Isagani to his fate.

Seeing Basilio&#x27;s demeanor, Isagani is belatedly unnerved by the revelation. Isagani rushes into the house, seizes the lamp, and throws it into the river. With this, Simoun&#x27;s second revolution fails as well.

In the following days, as the trappings at the reception venue are torn down, sacks containing gunpowder are discovered hidden under the boards all over the house. Simoun, who had directed the renovations, is exposed. With the Captain-General having left for Spain, Simoun is left without his protector and is forced to flee. A manhunt ensues and Simoun is chased as far away as the shores of the Pacific. He then spends the rest of his days hiding in the ancestral mansion of Padre Florentino, Isagani&#x27;s uncle.

One day, the lieutenant of the local Guardia Civil informs Florentino that he received an order to arrest Simoun that night. In response, Simoun drinks the slow-acting poison which he always kept in a compartment in his treasure chest. Simoun then makes his final confession to Florentino, first revealing his true name, to Florentino&#x27;s shock. He goes on to narrate how thirteen years before, as Crisóstomo Ibarra, he lost everything in the Philippines despite his good intentions. Crisóstomo swore vengeance. Retrieving some of his family&#x27;s treasure that Elias had buried in the Ibarra mausoleum in the forest, Crisóstomo fled to foreign lands and engaged in trade. He took part in the war in Cuba, aiding first one side and then another, but always profiting. There Crisóstomo met the Captain-General who was then a major, whose goodwill he won first by loans of money, and afterwards by covering his criminal activity. Crisóstomo bribed his way to secure the major&#x27;s promotion to Captain-General and his assignment to the Philippines. Once in the country, Crisóstomo then used him as a blind tool and incited him to all kinds of injustice, taking advantage of the Captain-General&#x27;s insatiable lust for gold.

The confession is long and arduous, and night has fallen when Crisóstomo finishes. In the end, Florentino assures the dying man of God&#x27;s mercy, but explains that his revolution failed because he has chosen means that God cannot sanction. Crisóstomo bitterly accepts the explanation and dies.

Realizing that the arresting officers will confiscate Crisóstomo&#x27;s possessions, Florentino divests him of his jewels and casts them into the sea, proclaiming that they are best hidden under the waters for the time being to ensure that they cannot be used to distort justice or incite greed, and that God shall provide the means to draw them out should people need wealth for a righteous cause.

==Major characters==

*Simoun – Crisóstomo Ibarra in disguise, returning as the wealthy jeweler Simoun. His appearance is described as being tanned, having a sparse beard, long white hair, and large blue-tinted glasses. He was sometimes crude and confrontational. He was derisively described by Custodio and Ben-Zayb as an American mulatto or a British Indian. While presenting as the arrogant elitist on the outside, he secretly plans a violent revolution in order to avenge himself for his misfortunes as well as hasten Elías&#x27; reformist goals.
*Basilio – son of Sisa and another character from &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot;. In the events of &quot;El Fili&quot;, he is an aspiring and successful physician on his last year at university and was waiting for his license to be released upon his graduation. After his mother&#x27;s death in the &quot;Noli&quot;, he applied as a servant in Capitán Tiago&#x27;s household in exchange for food, lodging, and being allowed to study. Eventually he took up medicine, and with Tiago having retired from society, he also became the manager of Tiago&#x27;s vast estate. He is a quiet, contemplative man who is more aware of his immediate duties as a servant, doctor, and member of the student association than he is of politics or patriotic endeavors. His sweetheart is Juli, the daughter of Kabesang Tales whose family took him in when he was a young boy fleeing the Guardia Civil and his deranged mother.
*Isagani – Basilio&#x27;s friend. He is described as a poet, taller and more robust than Basilio although younger. He is the nephew of Padre Florentino but is also rumored to be his son with his old sweetheart. Isagani was finishing his studies at the Ateneo Municipal and is planning to take medicine. A member of the student association, Isagani is proud and naive, and tends to put himself on the spot when his ideals are affronted. His unrestrained idealism and poeticism clash with the more practical and mundane concerns of his girlfriend, Paulita Gómez. When Isagani allows himself to be arrested after their association is outlawed, Paulita leaves him for Juanito Peláez. In his final mention in the novel, he was bidding goodbye to his landlords, the Orenda family, to stay with Florentino permanently.
*Father Florentino – Isagani&#x27;s uncle and a retired priest. Florentino was the son of a wealthy and influential Manila family. At his influential mother&#x27;s insistence, he broke off an affair with his sweetheart and entered the priesthood, devoting himself to his parish. An &quot;indio&quot; (native), Florentino was a secular priest, one unaffiliated with the Catholic religious orders, yet his parish drew in huge income. When the 1872 Cavite mutiny broke out, he promptly resigned from priesthood, fearing unwanted attention. He retired to his family&#x27;s large estate along the shores of the Pacific. He is described as white-haired, with a quiet, serene personality and a strong build. He did not smoke or drink. He was well respected by his peers, even by Spanish friars and officials.
*Father Fernández – a Dominican who was a friend of Isagani. Following the incident with the posters, he invited Isagani to a dialogue, not so much as a teacher with his student but as a friar with a Filipino. Although they failed to resolve their differences, they each promised to approach their colleagues with the opposing views from the other party – although both feared that given the animosity that existed between their sides, their own compatriots may not believe in the other party&#x27;s existence.
*Capitán Tiago – Don Santiago de los Santos. María Clara&#x27;s father. Having several landholdings in Pampanga, Binondo, and Laguna, as well as taking ownership of the Ibarras&#x27; vast estate, Tiago still fell into depression following María&#x27;s entry into the convent. He alleviated this by smoking opium, which quickly became an uncontrolled vice, exacerbated by his association with Padre Írene who regularly supplied him with the substance. Tiago hired Basilio as a capista, a servant given the opportunity to study as part of his wages; Basilio eventually pursued medicine and became his caregiver and the manager of his estate. Tiago died of shock upon hearing of Basilio&#x27;s arrest and Padre Írene&#x27;s embellished stories of violent revolt.
*Captain-General – the highest-ranking official in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period. The Captain-General in the novel is Simoun&#x27;s friend and confidant, and is described as having an insatiable lust for gold. Simoun met him as a major during the Ten Years&#x27; War in Cuba. He secured the major&#x27;s friendship and promotion to Captain-General through bribes. When he was posted in the Philippines, Simoun used him as a pawn in his own power plays to drive the country into revolution. The Captain-General was shamed into not extending his tenure after being rebuked by a high official in the aftermath of Basilio&#x27;s imprisonment.
*Father Bernardo Salví – a Franciscan friar, the former parish priest of San Diego and now the director and chaplain of the Santa Clara convent. The epilogue of &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot; implies that Salví regularly rapes María Clara when he is present at the convent. In &quot;El Filibusterismo&quot;, he is described as her confessor. In spite of reports of Ibarra&#x27;s death, Salví believed that Ibarra is still alive and lived in constant fear of his revenge.
*Father Hernando de la Sibyla – a Dominican introduced in &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot; as the curate of Binondo, who now serves as the director and chaplain of the University of Santo Tomas. He is described as a liberal friar who prefers reason.
*Father Millon – a Dominican who serves as a physics professor in the University of Santo Tomás.
*Quiroga – a Chinese businessman who aspired to be a consul for China in the Philippines. Simoun coerced Quiroga into hiding weapons inside the latter&#x27;s warehouses in preparation for the revolution.
*Don Custodio – Custodio de Salazar y Sánchez de Monteredondo, a famous &quot;contractor&quot; who was tasked by the Captain-General to develop the students association&#x27;s proposal for an academy for the teaching of Spanish, but was then also under pressure from the priests to protect their prerogatives as monopolizers of instruction. Some of the novel&#x27;s most scathing criticism is reserved for Custodio, a Peninsular Spaniard portrayed as an opportunist who married his way into high society, who regularly criticized favored ideas that did not come from him, but was ultimately, laughably incompetent.
*Ben-Zayb – A columnist for the Manila Spanish newspaper &quot;El Grito de la Integridad&quot;. Ben-Zayb is his pen name and is an anagram of Ybáñez, an alternate spelling of his last name Ibáñez. His first name is not mentioned. Ben-Zayb is said to have the looks of a friar, and believes that in Manila they think because he thinks. He is deeply patriotic, sometimes to the point of jingoism. As a journalist, he had no qualms twisting details to make a story sound better than it actually was. Father Camorra derisively calls him an ink-slinger.
*Father Camorra – the parish priest of Tiani. Ben-Zayb&#x27;s regular foil, he is said to look like an artilleryman in counterpoint to Ben-Zayb&#x27;s friar looks. He stops at nothing to mock and humiliate Ben-Zayb&#x27;s liberal pretensions. In his own parish, Camorra has a reputation for unrestrained lustfulness. He drives Juli into suicide after attempting to rape her inside the convent. For his misbehavior he was &quot;detained&quot; in his order&#x27;s luxurious riverside villa just outside Manila.
*Father Írene – Capitán Tiago&#x27;s spiritual adviser. Along with Don Custodio, Írene is severely criticized as a priest who allied with temporal authority for the sake of power and monetary gain. Known to many as the final authority who Custodio consults, the student association sought his support and gifted him with two chestnut-colored horses, yet he betrayed the students by counseling Custodio into making them fee collectors in their own school, which was then to be administered by the Dominicans instead of being a secular and privately managed institution as the students envisioned. Írene secretly but regularly supplies Capitán Tiago with opium while exhorting Basilio to do his duty. Írene embellished stories of panic following the outlawing of the student association Basilio was part of, hastening Capitán Tiago&#x27;s death. With Basilio in prison, he then removed Basilio out of Tiago&#x27;s last will and testament, ensuring he inherited nothing.
*Placido Penitente – a student of the University of Santo Tomas who had a distaste for study and would have left school if it were not for his mother&#x27;s pleas for him to stay. He clashes with his physics professor, who then accuses him of being a member of the student association, whom the friars despise. Following the confrontation, he meets Simoun at the Quiapo Fair. Seeing potential in Placido, Simoun takes him along to survey his preparations for the upcoming revolution. The following morning Placido has become one of Simoun&#x27;s committed followers. He is later seen with the former schoolmaster of San Diego, who was now Simoun&#x27;s bomb-maker.
*Paulita Gómez – the girlfriend of Isagani and niece of Doña Victorina, the old &quot;Indio&quot; who passes herself off as a &quot;Peninsular&quot;, who is the wife of the quack doctor Tiburcio de Espadaña. In the end, she and Isagani part ways, Paulita believing she will have no future if she marries him. She eventually marries Juanito Peláez.

Characters from Barrio Sagpang:

*Kabesang Tales – Telesforo Juan de Dios, a former &quot;cabeza de barangay&quot; of Barrio Sagpang in Tiani. He was a sugarcane planter who cleared lands he thought belonged to no one, losing his wife and eldest daughter in the endeavor. When the Dominicans took over his farm, he fought to his last money to have it retained in his possession. While his suit against the Dominicans was ongoing, he was kidnapped by bandits while he was patrolling his fields. When in spite of all Tales lost the case, he not only lost his farm but was also dealt with a heavy fine. He later joined the bandits and became one of their fiercest commanders.
*Tandang Selo – father of Kabesang Tales and grandfather of Tano and Juli. A deer hunter and later a broom-maker, he and Tales took in the young, sick Basilio who was then fleeing from the Guardia Civil. On Christmas Day, when Juli left to be with her mistress, Selo suffered some form of stroke that impaired his ability to speak. After Juli&#x27;s suicide, Selo left town permanently, taking with him his hunting spear. He was later seen with the bandits and was killed in an encounter with the Guardia Civil – ironically by the gun of the troops&#x27; sharpshooter Tano, his grandson.
*Juli – Juliana de Dios, the girlfriend of Basilio and the youngest daughter of Kabesang Tales. When Tales was captured by bandits, Juli petitioned Hermana Penchang to pay for his ransom. In exchange, she had to work as Penchang&#x27;s maid. Basilio ransomed her and bought a house for her family. During Basilio&#x27;s prison stint, Juli approached Tiani&#x27;s curate, Padre Camorra, for help. When Camorra tried to rape her, Juli jumped to her death from the church&#x27;s tower.
*Tano – Kabesang Tales&#x27;s son, second to Lucia who died in childhood. He was nicknamed &quot;Carolino&quot; after returning from Guardia Civil training in the Carolines. His squad was escorting prisoners through a road that skirted a mountain when they were ambushed by bandits. In the ensuing battle, Tano, the squad&#x27;s sharpshooter, killed a surrendering bandit from a distance, not knowing it was his own grandfather Selo.
*Hermana Penchang – the one among the &quot;rich folks&quot; of Tiani who lent Juli money to ransom Kabesang Tales from the bandits. In return, Juli will serve as her maid until the money was paid off. Penchang is described as a pious woman who speaks Spanish; however, her piety was clouded over by the virtues taught by the friars. While Juli was in her service, she made her work constantly, refusing to give her time off so she can take care of her grandfather Selo.
*Hermana Báli – Juli&#x27;s mother-figure and counselor. She accompanied Juli in her efforts to secure Kabesang Tales&#x27; ransom and later on Basilio&#x27;s release. Báli was a panguinguera – a gambler – who once performed religious services in a Manila convent. When Tales was captured by bandits, it was Báli who suggested to Juli the idea to borrow money from Tiani&#x27;s wealthy citizens, payable when Tales&#x27; legal dispute over his farm was won.

Student association for the teaching of Spanish:

* Macaraig – the leader. He is described as wealthy, with his own coach, driver, and set of horses. He is said to own several houses and he is lending one to serve as the schoolhouse for their planned Spanish language academy. After the outlawing of the group, he was the first to post bail. He then left the country after his release.
* Sandoval – a Peninsular who had come to Manila as a government employee and was finishing his studies, and who had completely identified himself with the cause of the Filipino students. After the outlawing of the group, he still managed to pass his courses through sheer oratorical skill.
* Pecson – described as chubby, pessimistic, and having an annoying grin. He is Sandoval&#x27;s regular foil when Sandoval launches into any kind of patriotic, optimistic speech. After they receive disappointing news about their Spanish language academy project, it was Pecson who suggested a torch-lit dinner at the Panciteria Macanista de Buen Gusto, just a block away from the Binondo Church and Convent, served by naked Chinese waiters. From there Sandoval and Pecson became more gracious to each other.
* Tadeo – a truant and charlatan who regularly dreamed of an eternal &quot;holiday&quot; from school, but was all the same beloved by professors and passed courses. A longtime Manila resident, he is seen having fun by telling outrageous stories about himself to a newcomer student from his home province. After the outlawing of the group, he alone seemed to welcome imprisonment as it meant not going to school. His holiday realized at last, he &quot;celebrated&quot; by setting up a bonfire using his books upon his release. 
*Juanito Peláez – Isagani&#x27;s rival for Paulita Gómez&#x27;s affection. He was the son of a Timoteo Peláez, a metalworks trader. He was a favorite of his professors. A regular prankster, he was said to have developed a hump by playing some trick and then hunching behind his classmates. He paid his dues to the student association, but broke away just as easily when the association was outlawed. Following Isagani&#x27;s arrest, Paulita breaks off from Isagani to marry Juanito.

<doc id="1226448" wikidata="Q1144373" url="?curid=1226448" title="Hatha Yoga Pradipika">
<text>The Haṭha Yoga Pradīpikā ( or Light on Hatha Yoga) is a classic fifteenth-century Sanskrit manual on haṭha yoga, written by Svātmārāma, who connects the teaching&#x27;s lineage to Matsyendranath of the Nathas. It is among the most influential surviving texts on haṭha yoga, being one of the three classic texts alongside the &quot;Gheranda Samhita&quot; and the &quot;Shiva Samhita&quot;.

More recently, eight works of early hatha yoga that may have contributed to the &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot; have been identified.

==Title and composition==

Different manuscripts offer different titles for the text, including &quot;Haṭhayogapradīpikā&quot;, &quot;Haṭhapradīpikā&quot;, &quot;Haṭhapradī&quot;, and &quot;Hath-Pradipika&quot;. It was composed by Svātmārāma in the 15th century as a compilation of the earlier haṭha yoga texts. Svātmārāma incorporates older Sanskrit concepts into his synthesis. He introduces his system as a preparatory stage for physical purification before higher meditation or Raja Yoga.

==Summary==
The &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradīpikā&quot; lists thirty-five earlier Haṭha Yoga masters (&quot;siddhas&quot;), including Ādi Nātha, Matsyendranāth and Gorakṣanāth. The work consists of 389 &quot;shlokas&quot; (verses) in four chapters that describe topics including purification (Sanskrit: &quot;ṣaṭkarma&quot;), posture (&quot;āsana&quot;), breath control (&quot;prāṇāyāma&quot;), spiritual centres in the body (&quot;chakra&quot;), &quot;kuṇḍalinī&quot;, energetic locks (&quot;bandha&quot;), energy (&quot;prāṇa&quot;), channels of the subtle body (&quot;nāḍī&quot;), and energetic seals (&quot;mudrā&quot;).

* Chapter 1 deals with setting the proper environment for yoga, the ethical duties of a yogi, and the &quot;asanas&quot;.
* Chapter 2 deals with &quot;pranayama&quot; and the &quot;satkarmas&quot;.
* Chapter 3 discusses the &quot;mudras&quot; and their benefits.
* Chapter 4 deals with meditation and &quot;samadhi&quot; as a journey of personal spiritual growth.

It runs in the line of Hindu yoga (as opposed to the Buddhist and Jain traditions) and is dedicated to The First Lord (Ādi Nātha), one of the names of Lord Śiva (the Hindu god of destruction and renewal). He is described in several Nāth texts as having imparted the secret of haṭha yoga to his divine consort Pārvatī.

=== Mechanisms ===
The &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot; presents two contradictory models of how Hatha Yoga may lead to immortality (&quot;moksha&quot;), both culled from other texts, without attempting to harmonise them.

The earlier model involves the manipulation of Bindu; it drips continually from the moon centre in the head, falling to its destruction either in the digestive fire of the belly (the sun centre), or to be ejaculated as semen, with which it was identified. The loss of Bindu causes progressive weakening and ultimately death. In this model, Bindu is to be conserved, and the various mudras act to block its passage down the Sushumna nadi, the central channel of the subtle body.

The later model involves the stimulation of Kundalini, visualised as a small serpent coiled around the base of the Sushumna nadi. In this model, the mudras serve to unblock the channel, allowing Kundalini to rise. When Kundalini finally reaches the top at the Sahasrara chakra, the thousand-petalled lotus, the store of Amrita, the nectar of immortality stored in the head, is released. The Amrita then floods down through the body, rendering it immortal.

==Modern research==

The &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot; is the hatha yoga text that has historically been studied within yoga teacher training programmes, alongside texts on classical yoga such as Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot;. In the twenty-first century, research on the history of yoga has led to a more developed understanding of hatha yoga&#x27;s origins.

James Mallinson has studied the origins of hatha yoga in classic yoga texts such as the &quot;Khecarīvidyā&quot;. He has identified eight works of early hatha yoga that may have contributed to its official formation in the &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot;. This has stimulated further research into understanding the formation of hatha yoga.

Jason Birch has investigated the role of the &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradīpikā&quot; in popularizing an interpretation of the Sanskrit word &quot;haṭha&quot;. The text drew from classic texts on different systems of yoga, and Svātmārāma grouped what he had found under the generic term &quot;haṭha yoga&quot;. Examining Buddhist tantric commentaries and earlier medieval yoga texts, Birch found that the adverbial uses of the word suggested that it meant &quot;force&quot;, rather than &quot;the metaphysical explanation proposed in the 14th century &quot;Yogabīja&quot; of uniting the sun (&quot;ha&quot;) and moon (&quot;ṭha&quot;)&quot;.

<doc id="1226454" wikidata="Q173105" url="?curid=1226454" title="Danny Sullivan">
<text>Daniel John Sullivan III (born March 9, 1950), better known as Danny Sullivan, is an American former racing driver. He earned 17 wins in the CART Indy Car World Series, including the 1985 Indianapolis 500. Sullivan won the 1988 CART Championship, and placed third in points in 1986. Sullivan also scored a victory in IROC. He competed in the 1983 Formula One season with Tyrrell, scoring 2 championship points.

==Before racing==
Sullivan was born in Louisville, Kentucky to a building contractor father. He attended the Kentucky Military Institute and then the Jim Russell Racing School. He had several odd jobs before his racing career, including lumberjack, and most famously, New York City cab driver.

==Formula One==
Sullivan was given a 21st birthday present of a course at the Jim Russell Racing Drivers School at the Snetterton circuit in England. He competed in Formula Ford, Formula Three and Formula Two before returning to race in the United States.

In 1980–81, he drove for Garvin Brown Racing in the SCCA Can-Am Series, scoring one victory in 1981 at the season-ending Caesars Palace Grand Prix.

In 1982, he made his début in the PPG Indycar series, and was recruited by the Tyrrell Formula One team for the season at the request of primary sponsor Benetton, who wanted an American driver. Sullivan competed in the fifteen races of the 1983 season, scoring two points with a fifth place at the Monaco Grand Prix and finishing seventeenth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. He also performed strongly in the non-championship Race of Champions held at the Brands Hatch circuit in April, seeing off an early race challenge from World Champion Alan Jones, before finishing second behind reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg, finishing only half-a-second behind the Williams after 40 laps of racing.

Nevertheless, he was somewhat overshadowed by his more experienced teammate, Michele Alboreto (who won the 1983 Detroit Grand Prix for the team, its last F1 victory), and was not retained at the end of the season.

==CART career==
For 1984, Sullivan returned to North America, where he competed in the CART PPG Indy Car series. He first landed at Shierson Racing, winning three races including the Pocono 500, and placing 4th in points. In 1985, he moved to Penske Racing, winning the 1985 Indianapolis 500. His victory at Indy, known in auto racing lore as the &quot;spin and win&quot; is one of the most legendary moments in Indy 500 history.

Sullivan would set the pace at Indy again in 1988, qualifying second and leading 91 of the first 101 laps. Sullivan was part of the all-Penske front row with teammates Rick Mears and Al Unser Sr. A wing adjuster broke on Sullivan&#x27;s car just after the halfway mark, and his car hit the outside wall in turn one, ending his day. Nevertheless, he rebounded, posting finishes of 4th or better over the next six races, winning at Portland and the Michigan 500. The win at Michigan completed a career Indy car Triple Crown (Indianapolis, Michigan, Pocono). He finished the season with five top-5 finishes over the final five races, including two wins. At the second-to-last race of the season at Laguna Seca, Sullivan won the pole position, led the most laps, and won the race. With still one race remaining, Sullivan clinched the 1988 CART championship, holding an insurmountable 35-point lead. It was Sullivan&#x27;s first championship title and Penske&#x27;s first since 1985.

In 1989, Sullivan suffered a broken arm in a crash during practice for the Indy 500, and would miss two races. He rebounded to win the Pocono 500 in August - his second win in that event - and one other race to place a respectable 7th in points. Sullivan&#x27;s last season with Penske Racing was 1990. He won two races in 1990, including the season finale at Laguna Seca. He won the pole and led wire-to-wire in his final start for Roger Penske.

In 1991, Sullivan switched to the Patrick Racing Alfa Romeo team. After going winless in 1991 in a very uncompetitive machine, he parted ways with Patrick. Sullivan won two more CART races between 1992 and 1993, driving for Galles-Kraco Racing. He scored the first win for the Galmer chassis at Long Beach. It came after he bumped teammate and race leader Al Unser Jr. on the backstretch with less than four laps to go. The incident sparked friction within the team. His later years were plagued with inconsistency, leading to a semi-retirement in 1994. His brief tenure at Galles was described as particularly toxic.

In 1986, Sullivan was a guest star on the television show &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (&quot;Florence Italy&quot;) playing a race car driver accused of murdering a prostitute. The episode featured some short outdoor scenes in the pit lanes of the Miami Grand Prix. Sullivan had limited dialogue in the episode; his longest piece of dialogue was in a police station interrogation scene.

Also in 1991, the Leland Corporation released the arcade game &quot;Danny Sullivan&#x27;s Indy Heat&quot;, featuring his likeness.

==After Indy==
In 1994, Sullivan took a sabbatical from Indy car racing. After being released from Galles Racing very late after the 1993 season, Sullivan was unable to find a new ride as most seats at that point had already been filled. He joined ABC/ESPN as a color commentator. He also attempted to run selected events in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series that season. However, he failed to qualify for several events; he qualified for only one race (the 1994 Brickyard 400), and finished 33rd for a very underfunded team. In 1994, he had some guest starts for Alfa Romeo in the DTM and together with Thierry Boutsen and Hans-Joachim Stuck he was third overall with the Dauer 962 LM at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

He returned to CART racing for one final year in 1995. His season ended early after a serious crash at Michigan International Speedway. While recovering from a broken pelvis and other injuries, he announced his retirement from open-wheel competition. He returned to ABC-TV for 1996–1998.

Sullivan was a paid celebrity endorser for Danny Sullivan Lexus in Jacksonville, Florida. The Lexus Dealership was owned primarily by members of the Davis family, who were the founders of Winn Dixie supermarkets.

Sullivan was also instrumental in the Red Bull Driver Search program to find an American driver to compete in Formula One. The program successfully promoted American Scott Speed from California, who drove for the Scuderia Toro Rosso team in and .

He was the drivers&#x27; representative on the stewards&#x27; panel for the 2010 German Grand Prix, 2010 Singapore Grand Prix, 2012 Hungarian Grand Prix, 2013 Australian Grand Prix, 2014 Spanish Grand Prix, 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, 2018 Bahrain Grand Prix, 2018 Chinese Grand Prix, and 2018 Monaco Grand Prix.

Sullivan and Michael Andretti were inducted into the Motorsports Walk of Fame on April 5, 2010, along the route of the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, which both men have won.

Sullivan serves as a senior advisor at Tempus Jets and its parent company, Orion Air Group, LLC. He also has various business relationships with Lexus, ABC/ESPN, CBS, Red Bull, Acura, and Toyota.

==Awards==
Sullivan was inducted into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2012, and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame in 2022.

<text>Gianni Morbidelli (born 13 January 1968) is an Italian racing driver. He participated in 70 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 11 March 1990. He achieved one podium, and scored a total of 8.5 championship points. He most recently competed in the TCR International Series.

==Racing career==

===Early career===
Morbidelli was born in Pesaro. His father, Giancarlo Morbidelli, was the founder of the Morbidelli motorcycle company which had some success in Grand Prix motorcycle racing. Morbidelli started karting in 1980. He won the EUR-AM championship in 1986, before moving to Italian Formula Three. He became Italian Formula 3 and Formula 3 European Cup champion in 1989, as well as winning two races in Italian Touring Cars. He then moved to the Scuderia Italia Formula One team, doing the first 2 races of the F1 season as stand-in for Emanuele Pirro, before concentrating on Formula 3000. He won 1 race and finished 5th in the 1990 championship, as well as undertaking test driver duties for Scuderia Ferrari for that year.

===Formula One===

Resuming his F1 career at the end of the season, Morbidelli competed in the final two races of the season with Minardi, where he remained until the end of . He briefly joined Ferrari for the 1991 Australian Grand Prix, drafted in after Alain Prost was fired by the team, where Morbidelli earned his first Formula One points, earning half a point for 6th after a rain-shortened race. A lack of sponsorship led to him leaving Minardi to rejoin Italian Touring Cars for 1993, where he drove an Alfa Romeo 155 to two wins for Alfa Corse, before being hired by Footwork Arrows for . He managed four-point-scoring positions in two years with the team, including his only podium place finish in the 1995 Australian Grand Prix, earning third place in a race of high attrition. Morbidelli became Footwork Arrows&#x27; most successful driver, with a total of eight points for the team.

Morbidelli also competed in the Italian Superturismo Championship for 1995, scoring two race wins, and, after spending a year out in 1996 testing for Jordan, gained another podium that year. Back in Formula One for , he raced in several mid-season events for Sauber as a replacement for Nicola Larini. He scored no points and was not classified in the championship for that year. His unsuccessful season, and two injuries by separate testing accidents, led to Morbidelli retiring from Formula One racing.

===Post-Formula One===

In 1998 he drove for Volvo in the British Touring Car Championship, but was not as competitive as his teammate Rickard Rydell, who won that year&#x27;s title. His only competitive showing was in the summer meeting at Thruxton, where he charged from near the back of the back to finish fourth, passing many cars in the process. Morbidelli then spent several years in various European touring car series&#x27;, with a high point in the 2001 European Touring Car Championship, where he raced the BMW 320i to fifth place in the championship, winning the last race at Estoril. Morbidelli raced in the Italian round of the 2004 season in a SEAT Toledo, but scored no points and did not contest in further meetings.

Morbidelli drove a Lamborghini in several grand tourer races in 2005, and moved back to touring cars for 2006. Competing in the World Touring Car Championship for N-Technology, he managed two second places in an Alfa Romeo 156. Not as competitive as when he was driving the BMW, he moved back to GT racing for 2007, winning two races in the ADAC GT Masters series. He has had considerable success in the Italian Superstars Championship, where Morbidelli won the title with both Audi RS4 and BMW M3 three years in a row from 2007. The short-lived Speedcar Series gave him another championship title, where he won the 2008–09 championship. The season featured a close fight with defending champion Johnny Herbert, with Morbidelli finishing one place ahead in the final round to win the title.

He is making his WTCC return in 2014, driving a Chevrolet Cruze for Münnich Motorsport. He made his debut in the FIA World Rallycross Championship with the same team at his home round in 2015.

<doc id="1226456" wikidata="Q78548" url="?curid=1226456" title="Harald Ertl">
<text>Harald Ertl (31 August 1948 – 7 April 1982) was an Austrian racing driver and motorsport journalist. He was born in Zell am See and attended the same school as Grand Prix drivers Jochen Rindt, Helmut Marko and Niki Lauda.

Ertl sported an &#x27;Imperial&#x27;-style moustache and full beard. He worked his way through the German Formula Vee and Super Vee, and then on to Formula Three, before a successful switch to Touring Cars. During this period, he gained sufficient sponsorship to enter Formula One, where he drove with various outfits between 1975 and 1980. Ertl was one of the four drivers who helped to get Niki Lauda out of his burning Ferrari in the 1976 German Grand Prix.

Ertl was killed in an aeroplane crash in 1982, when the small plane he was travelling in suffered from engine failure.

==Early racing career==
In 1969, he bought a Formula V car (Austro Vau), won six races, but also rolled it at the Nürburgring. He was second in the European Cup with a Kaimann chassis in 1970, and started also in a round of the Championnat de France with a March-Ford 703, at Aéroport Dijon-Longvic circuit. He continued with F3 the following season, undertaking a selection of races in England, best result being ninth at Brands Hatch.

In 1971, he also moved to the European Touring Car Championship, driving an Alfa Romeo, gaining a third place at Monza in the Monza 4 hours. For 1972, he switched to the BMW-Alpina team in the Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft. The best result of the season, with a fourth place in the first race, Internationale ADAC-Eifelrennen, held on the Nürburgring Nordschleife.

1973 saw Ertl continue to mix Formula Three and Touring Cars, with little success, until the September, when at the side of Derek Bell, they would win the RAC Tourist Trophy, with both drivers each winning their respective heat, to take an aggregate victory.

For 1974, his main target was the Deutsche Formel 3 Polifac Trophy. Once again, his best result came at the Nürburgring, where finished fourth. Meanwhile, he also raced in the Formal Super Vee Gold Pokal, taking 19th in the final standings. During this season, Ertl made his F2 debut, racing at both the European Championship for F2 Drivers events at Hockenheim.

In 1975 Ertl signed for Fred Opert Racing to continue racing in F2. By the third race for the team he was on the podium. A third place in the Internationales ADAC-Eifelrennen, held on the Nürburgring Nordschleife enabled him gather enough money together, including sponsorship from Warsteiner to start racing in F1.

==Formula One career==
In 1975, sponsorship obtained from Warsteiner had allowed him to drive a Hesketh 308 in Formula One, prepared by Hesketh Racing in Warsteiner&#x27;s golden livery. In his debut at the German Grand Prix, he finished 8th. He went on to retire in his home GP, then finished ninth at Monza.

Encouraged by these results, a full season with Hesketh was planned for 1976. In the South African Grand Prix he qualified in the last row and finished 15th. The next races saw him either not qualify at all, or at the back of the grid, with early retirements due to mechanical failures. Despite not being satisfied with the value the team gave him for the money, he almost scored a point when coming in seventh at the 1976 British Grand Prix, albeit three laps down.

Two weeks later at the 1976 German Grand Prix, Ertl was one of the four drivers who helped pull Niki Lauda from his burning Ferrari after Lauda&#x27;s infamous crash during the second lap of the race. The rest of the season saw two more eighth places finishes as highlights, at home and at the wet Japanese Grand Prix.

Ertl continued with Hesketh for a third season, taking in some European races, finishing 9th at the 1977 Belgian Grand Prix. He left Hesketh after the 1977 French Grand Prix where he again failed to qualify for the race.

For a few races in 1978, Ertl entered with Ensign, but things were even worse there, with the cars failing to finish or even worst, when he did not survive prequalifying at Monza. At the same event, he got another chance with the spare car of German-language ATS team, as regular driver Jochen Mass injured himself in the pre-Monza test a few days prior. He still failed to make the cut.

Two years later, Ertl tried once again with ATS in the 1980 German Grand Prix with the same result. The last Formula One Grand Prix he took part in was the 1978 Austrian Grand Prix, in his home country.

While not racing F1, Ertl was still racing in F2 albeit with very little success. In these three seasons, he finished just once in the top six.

==DRM years==
Away from single-seaters, Ertl returned to Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft (DRM) in 1977, now that the series had switched to Group 5.

Based on experience with their BMW, Schnitzer Motorsport developed a Toyota Celica LB Turbo for Ertl in 1977. Schnitzer switched back to BMW for the 1978 season, retaining the services for Ertl. This move made him one of the main contenders for the title. With the Kremer Racing Porsche of Bob Wollek being bit off the pace, while the Ford entrant, Zakspeed’s Escort being outdated, and their Ford Capri Turbo was unreliable. Ertl would win five of the 11 races during the season, with a second place at the season finale, a Super Sprint event at the Nürburgring, he would win the championship.

Despite taking the title with Schnitzer, Ertl switched to Zakspeed for the next two seasons. 1979 started off promising with a win in the opening round at Zolder, then followed it up with a third in Hockenheim in the next race. Although he would win once more at Mainz-Finthen, the season turned miserable with six non-finishes or non-starts out of 11 races, in Zakspeed’s Ford Capri Turbo. Meanwhile, Zakspeed also developed a mid-engined Lotus Europa for the 1000km Nürburgring. That also did not finish the race. The following season was like the previous one, when Ertl continued to be unlucky: 8 poles, 4 wins and 6 retirements.

==Death==

Ertl did not race internationally at all in 1981, but planned a return for the 1982 Renault 5 Turbo Cup. However before these plans came through, he was killed in an aircraft accident at the age of 33. He was travelling in a Beechcraft Bonanza flown by his brother-in-law Jörg Becker-Hohensee from Mannheim to their holiday home in Sylt in Northern Germany for an Easter vacation. Less than a quarter of the way through the intended flight distance engine failure caused the plane to crash at Hohenahr near Giessen. Ertl&#x27;s wife Vera and son Sebastian were injured but Becker-Hohensee, Ertl and his niece were killed.

<doc id="1226457" wikidata="Q171561" url="?curid=1226457" title="Harry Schell">
<text>Harry Lawrence O&#x27;Reilly Schell (June 29, 1921 – May 13, 1960) was an American racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . 

Born and raised in Paris, Schell was the son of American motorsport executive and heiress Lucy O&#x27;Reilly Schell. With his Formula One debut at the 1950 Monaco Grand Prix, Schell became the first American driver to start a Formula One Grand Prix. 

Schell died after crashing his Cooper T51 during practice for the non-championship 1960 BRDC International Trophy at Silverstone.

==Early life==

Schell was born in the 16th arrondissement, Paris, France, the son of expatriate American and sometime auto racer Laury Schell; his mother was the wealthy American heiress Lucy O&#x27;Reilly Schell. O&#x27;Reilly was an auto racing enthusiast who had met Laury while visiting France; they soon became familiar names on the rallying scene together. She became heavily invested in the Delahaye concern, first campaigning sports cars for them and then championing the development of a Delahaye Grand Prix car, which she ran under the Ecurie Bleue banner. Frenchman René Dreyfus won the 1938 Pau Grand Prix for the team in a shock upset over Mercedes, but the Delahaye project failed to raise the necessary backing and was never developed to its full extent.

Shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, Schell&#x27;s parents were involved in a road accident in which Laury was killed and O&#x27;Reilly severely injured. When France was occupied by Germany, Schell and his mother returned to America, where she managed the operations of René Le Bègue and René Dreyfus during the 1940 Indianapolis 500. Having already volunteered in the Finnish Air Force during their Winter War with Russia in 1939, Harry then earned a commission in the United States Tank Corps when America entered the Second World War.

==Racing career==

After the war, Schell attempted to qualify for the 1946 Indianapolis 500, failing to make the event. He went on to race in Europe, driving Coopers in Formula 3, Formula 2 and even the Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship upon its inception in 1950. His first appearance was in a Cooper powered by a J.A.P. V-twin engine at Monte Carlo; it ended in an accident at the harbor chicane that involved the majority of the field.

Though Schell never won a championship Grand Prix and enjoyed life as a playboy and womanizer, he was highly respected in period; he twice stood on the podium with a best place of second in the 1958 Dutch Grand Prix, won the Caen Grand Prix of 1956, and balanced those with periodic sports car outings. He partnered with Stirling Moss in securing a second place at the 1957 12 Hours of Sebring, and took third place at the same event in 1959. His most notable spells in Formula One came for BRM, Vanwall, and the Maserati factory effort as a team mate to the five-time champion Juan Manuel Fangio. He also drove for Scuderia Ferrari for two races at the 1955 Monaco Grand Prix and the 1955 Valentino Grand Prix.

Schell carved out a reputation as a safe and prudent competitor and could be counted on as a consistent points scorer, but he also proved his class when the opportunity presented itself. In the 1954 Spanish Grand Prix, he took the lead from the start in his private Maserati and drove off into the distance before spinning out of first place and then retiring with a transmission failure. At the 1956 French Grand Prix, he relieved an ill Mike Hawthorn after his own Vanwall had gone out with an early engine failure and drove back into second position. The Ferrari team, operating under the assumption that Schell was a lap adrift, had been caught out, and a dramatic fight for the lead ensued, but Schell&#x27;s effort went for nought as he was forced to make a lengthy pit stop soon after. He had succeeded, however, in displaying the full potential of the Vanwall on the world stage for the first time. Driving a Ferrari 375 Indy for Luigi Chinetti&#x27;s North American Racing Team at the 1958 Race of Two Worlds, Schell joined Phil Hill (Scuderia Ferrari 296 Dino) and Masten Gregory (Ecurie Ecosse Jaguar D-Type) on the Monza high banking as the only American drivers not entered in an American Championship Car.

By the start of 1960, and nearing 40, Schell&#x27;s prospects appeared dim, and he campaigned a private Cooper run under his family&#x27;s Ecurie Bleue banner. That changed, however, when he was contracted by the British Racing Partnership team before the start of the European Grand Prix season for a full program of events, to be teamed with Tony Brooks and the up-and-coming Chris Bristow in year-old Coopers. Schell died in practice for the non-championship International Trophy event at Silverstone in 1960, when he crashed his Cooper at Abbey Curve. Schell was driving at approximately 100 mph when his car slid into the mud on the side of the track and lost a wheel. The Cooper somersaulted and penetrated a safety barrier, causing a brick wall to collapse.

Prior to his death, Schell had been extremely vocal in the promotion of the roll-bar on European racing cars, a safety feature required in America. By the 1500cc formula of 1961, it had become standard in Formula One.

<text>Henri Jacques William Pescarolo (; born 25 September 1942) is a French former racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . In endurance racing, Pescarolo is a four-time winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and won the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1991 with Joest.

Born and raised in Paris, Pescarolo began his career in a Lotus Seven aged 22. Pescarolo participated in 64 Formula One Grands Prix, achieving one fastest lap, one podium finish, and 12 championship points. He also entered the 24 Hours of Le Mans a record 33 times between and , with four overall and six class wins; he won several other major sportscar racing events, including the: 24 Hours of Daytona, 1000 km of Monza, 1000 km of Spa-Francorchamps, 6 Hours of Nürburgring and 1000 km Buenos Aires. Pescarolo also drove in the Dakar Rally in the 1990s, before retiring from racing aged 57. 

Upon his retirement from motor racing in 1999, Pescarolo founded the eponymous racing team, Pescarolo Sport, which competed at Le Mans until . He was widely known for his distinctive green helmet, and full-face beard that partially covers burns suffered in a crash.

==Early career and Formula One==

Born in Montfermeil near Paris, Pescarolo began his career in 1965 with a Lotus Seven. He was successful enough to be offered a third car in the Matra Formula 3 team for 1966, but the car was not ready until mid-season. However, in 1967 he won the European Championship with Matra and was promoted to Formula 2 for 1968. That season he was team-mate to Jean-Pierre Beltoise and achieved several second places and a win at Albi, which led to him being given a drive in Matra&#x27;s Formula One team for the last three races of 1968.

His career suffered a setback, in 1969, when he crashed on the Mulsanne Straight at Le Mans whilst testing the Matra sports car. Pescarolo was badly burned and did not compete again until mid-season. He returned at the German GP where he drove a Formula 2 Matra into fifth place winning the small capacity class, in his only Grand Prix race that season.

For 1970 Pescarolo was signed full-time by Matra for their Formula One team and once again as team-mate to Beltoise, put in a solid season with a third place at the Monaco Grand Prix being the high point. He also won the Paris 1000 km and Buenos Aires 1000 km sports car races partnered with Beltoise. Pescarolo was not retained by Matra, and in 1971, 1972, and 1973 with Motul sponsorship, he drove for the fledgling Formula One team run by the young Frank Williams, but with little success. In 1974, Pescarolo drove for BRM, again with Motul backing, but the team&#x27;s best days were gone and a ninth place in Argentina was his best result in a season with many retirements.

Pescarolo did not compete in Formula One in 1975 but returned to the championship in 1976 with a Surtees privately entered by BS Fabrications. Although neither car nor driver was considered to be competitive, failing to qualify for 2 of 9 Grands Prix entered, Pescarolo did begin to show speed in the final 5 races, even scoring a season&#x27;s best finish of 9th at the 1976 Austrian Grand Prix.

==Career after Formula One – sportscars==

After Pescarolo&#x27;s retirement from Formula One, he went on to start his own team, which competed until 2012 in the Le Mans Endurance Series and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, which he won as a driver four times (1972, 1973, 1974 and 1984). His team, Pescarolo Sport, was notably sponsored by Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 2 and by &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot;. During the five years that Pescarolo has campaigned Courage C60 prototypes, so many modifications have been made to the model that Courage allowed the team to name the car after themselves, such was the differences between their model and the standard C60. In 2005, it was developed further still to meet the &quot;hybrid&quot; regulations, before the change to LMP1/2 format.

In 1977, 1978 and 1979 Pescarolo drove in Australia&#x27;s most famous motor race, the Bathurst 1000 for touring cars held at the Mount Panorama Circuit, driving on all three occasions with 1974 race winner John Goss. Unfortunately all races resulted in a DNF for the Goss built Ford XC Falcon GS500 Hardtops, completing only 113 laps (of 163) in 1977, 68 in 1978 and 118 in 1979. The 1977 race saw Pescarolo&#x27;s Le Mans rival Jacky Ickx win the race in a semi-works Falcon driving with Allan Moffat.
Pescarolo holds the record for Le Mans starts with 33 and has won the race on four occasions as a driver. He has yet to win the race as a team owner, coming very close in 2005 with the Pescarolo C60H. His team did manage to win the LMES championship in the same year. His team was also second at Le Mans in 2006, followed by a third in 2007 behind a pair of diesel-powered prototypes.

Pescarolo drove the Dakar Rally in the 1990s, and is also a keen helicopter pilot.

<doc id="1226461" wikidata="Q171733" url="?curid=1226461" title="Howden Ganley">
<text>James Howden Ganley (born 24 December 1941) is a former racing driver from New Zealand. From 1971 to 1974 he participated in 41 World Championship Formula One Grands Prix. He placed 4th twice and scored points 5 times for a total of 10 championship points (only the top 6 places scored points). He also participated in numerous non-Championship Formula One races.

== Personal and early life ==
When he was thirteen years old, he attended the 1955 New Zealand Grand Prix at Ardmore which inspired him and provided him with an impetus to follow a career in racing. Immediately after leaving school, Ganley became a reporter for the &quot;Waikato Times&quot; and wrote a column for &quot;Sports Car Illustrated&quot;. He moved to the United Kingdom in 1961 and pursued a career as a mechanic.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Between 1960 and 1962, Ganley competed in many events throughout New Zealand driving a Lotus Eleven. Throughout this period, he was earning a living by working as a foreman for a concreting company.

In 1970, Ganley finished second to Peter Gethin in the European Formula 5000 championship. This caught the attention of the BRM Formula One team, who signed him to a contract for 1971.

=== Formula 5000 ===

In 1970, Ganley finished the European Formula 5000 Championship in 2nd place with help from his friend and mechanic Barry Ultahan.

=== Formula One ===
In , Ganley started off the season promisingly with fifth place at the non-championship Race of Champions. At the end of 1971, having scored two points finishes during the year, Ganley was awarded the &quot;Wolfgang von Trips Memorial Trophy&quot; for the best performance by a newcomer to Grand Prix racing.
In Ganley raced for the Marlboro BRM team and finished 13th in the Championship with 4 points. His highest finish for the season was 4th at the Nürburgring. For the season Ganley signed up to drive an Iso–Marlboro car for Frank Williams Racing. At the 1973 Canadian Grand Prix he was almost declared the winner because of a timing mix up with the pace car; when the results were corrected, Ganley was classified sixth.

A suspension failure in practice for the 1974 German Grand Prix while driving for the Maki team left Ganley with serious foot and ankle injuries that ended his Grand Prix career.

=== Ganley F1 Car ===
In 1975 a Ganley F1 project was initiated. The Ganley-Cosworth 001 car was hand-built by Howden Ganley on his premises at Windsor. It was almost readied, and Ganley had two DFV engines at hand, but it never ran in anger. Ganley eventually used the equipment to start Tiga Race Cars with fellow driver Tim Schenken the following year.

=== Sportscars ===
Ganley and François Cevert drove a Matra-Simca MS670 to second place in the 1972 24 Hours of Le Mans.

=== Tiga Race Cars ===

In 1976 Ganley and former Formula One driver Australian Tim Schenken founded Tiga Race Cars as a British-based race car constructor and race team. The team had plans to compete in Formula One in 1978, but the project did not proceed due to sponsorship withdrawal.

<doc id="1226463" wikidata="Q171720" url="?curid=1226463" title="Jackie Oliver">
<text>Keith Jack Oliver (born 14 August 1942) is a British former Formula One driver and team-owner from England. He became known as the founder of the Arrows team as well as a racing driver, although during his driving career he won both the 24 Hours of Le Mans race and the Can-Am championship. Oliver was also the second person to complete the informal triple Crown of endurance racing.

==Driving career==

Oliver began a long career in motorsport in 1961, driving a Mini in British club saloon racing. In 1962 and 1963 he raced for Ecurie Freeze in a Marcos GT. In 1964 He raced in a Lotus Elan driving for D.R. Fabrications team and entered GT racing, scoring some excellent results, and then having a difficult time in Formula Three, where his natural speed was blighted by mechanical failures.

Nevertheless, for 1967 he was drafted into the Team Lotus Formula Two team, which also saw him making his Grand Prix debut in the F2 class at the German Grand Prix, where he came fifth overall and won the F2 class. In 1968, he was called up to F1 by Colin Chapman to take over the works Formula One seat for Team Lotus after the death of Jim Clark. The season would turn out to be difficult, with Oliver struggling for finishes. He led the British Grand Prix until an engine failure, and would only finish twice, his best result being third place at the season-closing Mexican Grand Prix. In F2 he was reasonably successful driving a Lotus running for the Herts and Essex Aero Club team. At the end of the year the team was invited to compete in the four races making up the Argentine Temporada. The Herts and Essex Team finished third overall in the series.

With Jochen Rindt signing for Lotus for 1969, Oliver switched to BRM. He was to suffer disappointing two years at the Bourne team, which would effectively kill off his Grand Prix career. In two years, he would muster just four finishes, with his only points scores being sixth place in the 1969 Mexican Grand Prix, and fifth in the 1970 Austrian Grand Prix. However, in 1970, he led much of the Race of Champions holding off Stewart and was a strong third for most of the Dutch and British GP. The poor result in the Austrian GP which Team boss, Louis Stanley thought he should have won, saw the best car go to Pedro Rodríguez from then on, but Oliver still led some laps at the slipstream Italian race. Stanley described Oliver, as &#x27;good, but not nearly as good as he thought&#x27;. The majority of his other races saw the BRM break down. Most pundits and sponsor, Yardley, were surprised and disappointed after Oliver was sacked by BRM. Jackie Stewart, judged Oliver a very good GP and Can-Am driver.

His best results in these seasons would come from endurance racing, in John Wyer&#x27;s Gulf Ford GT40, winning the 12 Hours of Sebring and 24 Hours of Le Mans events with Jacky Ickx in 1969, and the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 1000 km Monza in 1971 with Rodríguez.

In 1969, he debuted in CanAm, initially for Autocoast in the TI-22, and then for Don Nichols&#x27; Shadow team. 1971 saw him out of a full-time Formula One drive, though he had three drives in a third McLaren. 1972 saw him concentrate mainly on CanAm with Shadow, though he would take a one-off drive for BRM at the 1972 British Grand Prix, where he retired.

For 1973, Shadow entered F1, and Oliver was nominated as team leader. The Shadow DN1 proved a difficult chassis, and once again his season was blighted by mechanical errors. However, in the Canadian Grand Prix he ran well, and many believe he actually won the race, but the lap charts were thrown into confusion by a rain shower meaning multiple pit-stops, and a staggeringly inept deployment of a pace car by the organisers. As it was, Oliver was classified third, his only points finish of the year.

1974 saw Oliver concentrate on CanAm, taking the series title for Shadow. He was becoming more involved in the management side of Shadow, but would compete in Formula 5000 for the team for three seasons, and even briefly returned to F1, finishing fifth in the 1977 Race of Champions, and taking 9th in the Swedish Grand Prix.

He also competed in 8 NASCAR Cup Series races between 1971 and 1972, the majority of them for Donlavey Racing. He attempted the 1972 Daytona 500 but failed to qualify.

==Arrows==

At the end of 1977 he left Shadow along with financer Franco Ambrosio, designers Tony Southgate and Alan Rees, engineer Dave Wass and driver Riccardo Patrese to form the Arrows Grand Prix team.

Arrows would become famous for competing in a record 382 Grands Prix without achieving a single victory. However, the team would always have well-presented cars which would usually be competitive, if not front-runners, and would often give breaks to talented drivers - besides Patrese, Thierry Boutsen, Gerhard Berger, Marc Surer and Martin Donnelly would all drive for the team early in their respective racing careers.

Oliver sold much of his stake to the Japanese Footwork Corporation in 1990, remaining as director, but the team failed to move forward and the company pulled out at the end of 1993 due to financial trouble. Oliver had his team back, but money was tight, and in 1996 he again sold most of his shares to Tom Walkinshaw&#x27;s TWR group. Oliver remained on the board until 1999, when he sold his remaining shares.

<doc id="1226464" wikidata="Q810029" url="?curid=1226464" title="Basil Hall Chamberlain">
<text>Basil Hall Chamberlain (18 October 1850 – 15 February 1935) was a British academic and Japanologist. He was a professor of the Japanese language at Tokyo Imperial University and one of the foremost British Japanologists active in Japan during the late 19th century. (Others included Ernest Satow and W. G. Aston.) He also wrote some of the earliest translations of haiku into English. He is perhaps best remembered for his informal and popular one-volume encyclopedia &quot;Things Japanese&quot;, which first appeared in 1890 and which he revised several times thereafter. His interests were diverse, and his works include an anthology of poetry in French.

==Early life==
Chamberlain was born in Southsea (a part of Portsmouth) on the south coast of England, the son of an Admiral William Charles Chamberlain and his wife Eliza Hall, the daughter of the travel writer Basil Hall. His younger brother was Houston Stewart Chamberlain. He was brought up speaking French as well as English, even before moving to Versailles to live with his maternal grandmother in 1856 upon his mother&#x27;s death. Once in France, he acquired German as well. Chamberlain had hoped to study at Oxford, but instead started work at Barings Bank in London. He was unsuited to the work and soon had a nervous breakdown. It was in the hope of a full recovery that he sailed out of Britain, with no clear destination in mind.

==Japan==
Chamberlain landed in Japan on 29 May 1873, employed by the Japanese government as an &quot;o-yatoi gaikokujin&quot;. He taught at the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in Tokyo from 1874 to 1882. His most important position, however, was as professor of Japanese at Tokyo Imperial University beginning in 1886. It was here that he gained his reputation as a student of Japanese language and literature. (He was also a pioneering scholar of the Ainu and Ryukyuan languages.) His many works include the first translation of the &quot;Kojiki&quot; into English (1882), &quot;A Handbook of Colloquial Japanese&quot; (1888), &quot;Things Japanese&quot; (1890), and &quot;A Practical Guide to the Study of Japanese Writing&quot; (1905). A keen traveller despite chronic weak health, he cowrote (with W. B. Mason) the 1891 edition of &quot;A Handbook for Travellers in Japan&quot;, of which revised editions followed.

Chamberlain was a friend of the writer Lafcadio Hearn, once a colleague at the university, but the two became estranged over the years. Percival Lowell dedicated his travelogue &quot;Noto: An Unexplored Corner of Japan&quot; (1891) to Chamberlain.

Chamberlain sent many Japanese artefacts to the Pitt Rivers Museum at Oxford.

He left Japan in March 1911 and moved to Geneva, where he lived until his death in 1935.

<text>Johannes Antonius &quot;Jan&quot; Lammers (born 2 June 1956) is a Dutch racecar driver, most notable for winning the 1988 24 Hours of Le Mans world endurance race, for Silk Cut Jaguar/TWR; after four seasons in Formula One racing, from 1979 through 1982, for the F1 teams of Shadow, ATS, Ensign and Theodore, respectively. After a world-record setting ten-year hiatus, Lammers made a brief Formula One comeback, for two races, with team March in 1992. Aside from racing in these two of the highest leagues of global auto-sports, Lammers has raced in an exceptionally wide number of racing series and competitions, domestic and abroad, over four decades.

Later in life, Lammers became a team owner as well, first setting up his own Formula Opel Lotus team, Vitaal Racing, winning the EFDA Opel Lotus Euroseries with Peter Kox in 1989, then creating the Racing for Holland outfit that raced in sportscars class in 2001-2007. Between 2005 and 2009, he was the seatholder of the Dutch A1 Grand Prix team. During his Racing for Holland days, Lammers combined racing and management duties to win the 2002 and 2003 FIA Sportscar Championship.

One of the most versatile drivers in modern motor racing history, Lammers started in touring cars, to become the youngest Dutch champion in history in 1973 while repeating the act in 1976. He also raced in the European Renault 5 Turbo Cup, taking the 1983 and 1984 European titles. As a single-seater driver, his steps towards Formula One include securing the title in the 1978 European Formula 3 Championship. He remains the only Dutch driver to have done so. At the zenith of his career in Group C sports-prototypes, Lammers lifted the crown in the 1992 Japanese Sportscar Championship.

Lammers has further raced in Formula Ford, Formula 2, IndyCar racing, International F3000, Japanese F3000, the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC), BPR Global GT, FIA GT, the European Le Mans Series, the IMSA SportsCar Championship, the American Le Mans Series, Grand-Am, and the Dakar Rally.

Guest appearances include the Grand Prix Masters for retired F1 drivers, the BMW M1 Procar Series, the Dutch Supercar Challenge, the Dubai 24 Hours and Gulf 12 Hours endurance races, the VW Scirocco R-Cup and the Dutch domestic Tulpenrallye.

In recent years, Lammers was an important figurehead / ambassador for reviving the Dutch Formula One GP on the coastal dunes situated Zandvoort circuit, achieved since 2021.

==Early career==

=== Touring cars ===

Born in Zandvoort, Lammers grew up washing cars at the nearby school for advanced and anti-skid driving skills training, run by Dutch touring-car legend Rob Slotemaker. Encouraged by Slotemaker, and while still under-age for a regular Dutch driving licence, the teenager nicknamed ‘Jantje’ (‘Little John’) was also hired to teach drivers on a private, closed track, how to safely recover a car from a skid situation. Having recognised Lammers&#x27; talent, Slotemaker set him up in a Simca Rallye 2 for the 7,500-9,000 guilder Group 1 production car class in the 1973 Dutch Touring Car Championship. At 16 years of age, Lammers won his first-ever car race and continued to take the season title in his rookie year, becoming the youngest Dutch national auto racing champion in history.

Two more years in the Simca followed in a revised 8,000-10,000 guilder class, Lammers taking four more wins in 1974 but narrowly missing out on a title repeat. Wins elude him in 1975 but his name has already been made. In 1976, he switched to an Opel Dealer Team Holland-run Opel Kadett GT/E to take his second Dutch title.

== Road to Formula One ==

=== Formula Ford ===
Dovetailing his 1976 touring-car campaign with a first season in Formula Ford, Lammers quickly realises his future is in single-seaters. Driving a Crosslé in the Benelux, German and European Championship, the touring-car boy wonder surprises everyone by grabbing pole position at his first race, winning at the Jyllandring and Mengen and shining in the soaking wet finale of the Formula Ford Festival at Brands Hatch.

=== Formula 3 ===

Stepping up with Hawke to Formula 3 in 1977 proves to be a false dawn, as the Hawke proves no match for the Marches and the Ralts. For 1978, he switches to the Racing Team Holland outfit run by Alan Docking, with fellow future Formula 1 driver Huub Rothengatter and later Indy 500 winner Arie Luyendijk as his team mates. This is an inspired move as it leads to Lammers winning the 1978 European Formula 3 Championship after a close battle with Swede Anders Olofsson, while beating highly touted rivals such as Alain Prost, Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell. Lammers takes wins at Zandvoort, Magny-Cours, Karlskoga and in the famous Lotteria race at Monza to lift the crown. At the time, leading British magazine Autosport predicts: &quot;He just has to be a World Champion of the eighties.&quot;

=== Formula 2 ===
Having received an offer from the works March Formula 2 team, Lammers decides to jump the category to go straight into Formula One with Shadow in 1979. He will make his single Formula 2 appearance in 1980, driving a March-BMW in his home race at Zandvoort, where he retires from third place.

== Formula One ==
Lammers spends four seasons in Formula One, racing largely uncompetitive machinery and failing to score a World Championship point in any of his 41 appearances. His talent is universally recognised, though, and the Dutchman only narrowly misses out on the chance to join Ferrari in 1982 as a replacement of Gilles Villeneuve who was killed at Zolder earlier in the year. The drive goes to Patrick Tambay instead.

In 1979, Lammers and fellow rookie Elio de Angelis join Shadow, but the team led by American Don Nichols is in its death throes, and the pair fail to make an impact with a poor car, with de Angelis scoring the team&#x27;s only points that year, being an excellent fourth place, at Watkins Glen. Lammers’ best result is a ninth place in the Canadian GP. Both are invited by Colin Chapman to test for Lotus, with De Angelis getting the job for 1980, as Lammers is unwilling to wait for Chapman’s decision. Instead, he decides to sign for the German-owned ATS team.

The underfunded outfit hands Lammers the old D3 car while team leader Marc Surer debuts with the new D4, but when Surer breaks his legs in an accident, Lammers gets his hands on the new D4. He immediately qualifies fourth on the grid at Long Beach but the car breaks on the opening lap of the race. This would remain the highpoint of his F1 career. Other notable ATS performances include battling Jody Scheckter’s Ferrari at Zolder, and retiring from a points-scoring position at Jarama. When Surer makes a return to ATS, Lammers is forced to jump ship to Ensign. In contrasting fortunes, his former teammate De Angelis has a fine season at Lotus while Lammers fails to qualify the cumbersome Ensign on several occasions.

For 1981, Lammers is invited for a test to become Nelson Piquet’s teammate at Brabham, but team principal Bernie Ecclestone chooses to go with Mexican pay driver Hector Rebaque. Instead, Lammers rejoins ATS and shines in the controversial non-championship South African GP at Kyalami where he fights De Angelis for second place until he is hit by brake problems. When Swede Slim Borgudd arrives with healthy funding from pop band ABBA, Lammers has to move over. 

In 1982, Lammers switches to Theodore but the underfunded team fails to hand him the opportunity to shine. At Monaco, Lammers’ TY02 has to stay on nude rims for a day because the team doesn&#x27;t get any tyres. Still seen as a natural talent, he is asked by Renault to replace the injured Prost at Detroit, only for the championship leader to recover in time. Lammers steps back into the Theodore but before the start of the first session he is approached by Ferrari to replace Gilles Villeneuve from Zandvoort on. In a twist of fate, the Theodore’s throttle sticks during the session and Lammers hits the wall to break his thumb. As a result, Patrick Tambay signs the Ferrari contract. At Zandvoort, instead of driving the Ferrari, Lammers takes part in his last Grand Prix before Tommy Byrne takes over the seat.

Late 1985, Lammers is given a test by Toleman at Estoril but with the team unable to get a tyre contract for 1986, plans for a Formula One return fall through. In 1989, another Formula One opportunity comes to nothing when Lammers is asked by Ken Tyrrell to replace Michele Alboreto, but the Dutchman decides to stick with TWR Jaguar, and Tyrrell signs up Jean Alesi instead.

Then in 1992, Lammers makes a surprise Formula One comeback when he steps in at March for the final two races of the season – a full ten years after his initial final Grand Prix, a record career gap in Formula One. Replacing Karl Wendlinger, Lammers laps sixth fastest in wet free practice at Suzuka, before retiring from the race with a broken gearbox. At Adelaide, he finishes 12th. Looking set to continue with March in 1993, his Formula One ambitions receive a blow when the team is denied an engine deal by Ilmor unless bills are paid. This leaves Lammers a spectator at Kyalami, after which the team folds.

Another Formula One option hits the rocks when Lammers is signed by the DAMS F3000 team for its debut season in 1996, having already tested their GD-01 car all through 1995. The project remains stillborn when DAMS fails to gather sufficient funding.

== Sportscars ==
Fed up with driving inferior machines at the back of the Formula One grid, Lammers decides to switch to sportscar racing where he becomes a mainstay for the next three decades, both as a driver and a team owner. His time in Group C includes seasons with Richard Lloyd Racing’s private Porsche 956, the works Jaguar team and the works Toyota team, while in the days of LMP900 and LMP1, Lammers runs his own Racing for Holland team with the Japanese Dome S101 chassis. His final call at Le Mans comes in 2017 and 2018 when he races the Racing Team Nederland Dallara in LMP2, sharing with Rubens Barrichello and Jumbo Supermarkets CEO and team owner Frits van Eerd.

=== Prototypes ===
Having turned his back on Formula One, Lammers starts his World Sportscar Championship career in 1983 by joining top Porsche privateer Richard Lloyd Racing, taking several podium finishes with Thierry Boutsen, Keke Rosberg and Jonathan Palmer, while finishing sixth on his Le Mans debut. In 1984, he is paired with Palmer, and the Canon-liveried 956 takes victory over the works cars at Brands Hatch. The two add podiums at Monza, the Nürburgring, Sandown Park and Imola, and retire from Le Mans in a winning position.

A mid-season switch sees Lammers snapped up by Tom Walkinshaw at TWR Jaguar, and on his debut for the team at a very hot Shah Alam in Malaysia he brings home the Jag in second place. Meanwhile, he makes his IMSA GTP debut racing a March-Buick at Miami with Roberto Guerrero. In the 1986 Daytona 24 Hours, driving the BF Goodrich Porsche 962, he is heading for victory when his brakes fail, leading to a sizeable crash that he is lucky to escape from. Later in the season, when his promising IndyCar adventure collapses with the disappointing Eagle, Walkinshaw is quick to lure Lammers back to TWR. The Dutchman is immediately competitive with second at Spa and third at Jerez, before racing for Nissan at Watkins Glen in IMSA GTP.

In 1987, Lammers joins TWR Jaguar – now sponsored by Silk Cut – as a proper works driver, and is teamed with Grand Prix veteran John Watson. They win at Jarama, Monza and Fuji and take podiums at Silverstone, Brands Hatch and Spa. At Le Mans, third driver Win Percy crashes their car out of the race. Team orders mean that they finish second in the championship.

1988 would become Lammers’ most successful season in Group C racing. Now paired with ex-Lotus Formula One driver Johnny Dumfries, the two finish second at Spa and third at Brno, before being joined by Andy Wallace at the Le Mans 24 Hours. Lammers drives for 13 hours to be the anchor in a popular win for TWR Jaguar, the first for the marque since 1957. For this, he is congratulated by Queen Elizabeth II and rewarded with the title of Honorary Member of the BRDC. In IMSA, Lammers is part of the crew that wins the Daytona 24 Hours, after he is moved over from his retired car to join Martin Brundle, Raul Boesel and John Nielsen in the lead Jaguar entry, winning the race. With regular teammate Davy Jones, Lammers wins at Del Mar and ends up on the podium at West Palm Beach, Lime Rock, Mid-Ohio and Sears Point.

In 1989, the Jaguars were outclassed by the resurgent Mercedes effort, with Lammers only managing to score a second place at Jarama with Patrick Tambay. In the US, Lammers is more successful, winning in Portland and Del Mar, taking second in the Daytona 24 Hours, Lime Rock, Mid-Ohio and Road America and third at Sears Point and Topeka. The following year, Lammers wins the Daytona 24 Hours again, this time paired with Andy Wallace and Davy Jones, before taking third in the Sebring 12 Hours. In the WSC, however, Jaguar’s new turbo engine proves fast but unreliable, and together with Wallace, Lammers only picks up a pair of second places. Switching to the proven atmospheric V12 for Le Mans, Jaguar takes the double, but Lammers is in the second Jaguar across the line, having to recover from an earlier crash by teammate Franz Konrad.

Having opted for a switch to Toyota, Lammers decides to wait in the wings for the new programme to come alive in 1992. In the World Championship, mated with Geoff Lees, Lammers takes two podium finishes, second at Suzuka and third at Magny-Cours. In the Japanese Sports-Prototype Championship, however, two wins at Fuji and Mine add up to another title for the Dutchman. One more Toyota appearance follows in 1993, finishing sixth for the Japanese constructor in the Le Mans 24 Hours.

In 1995, Lammers returns to IMSA to compete at Daytona and Sebring in the Auto Toy Store Spice-Chevrolet SE90. With Andy Wallace, he wins the Sebring 12 Hours on the road but a timekeeping error declares the Fermín Velez/Andy Evans/Eric van de Poele Ferrari 333SP as the winner, while as a guest driver, Lammers joins Derek Warwick and Mario Andretti in a Courage-Porsche C36 to finish sixth in the 1996 Le Mans 24 Hours.

In 1999 and 2000, Lammers returns to prototype racing, as Konrad Motorsport moves up to the LMP class with a Ford-engined Lola B98/10, followed by a B2K/10, while in the US he joins J&amp;P Motorsports to race a Panoz LMP-1 Roadster-S. In the meantime, he progresses with setting up his own team for 2001. At Konrad, teaming up with countrymen Tom Coronel and Peter Kox serves as a prequel to that.

Lammers embarks on a new era of sportscar success in 2001 when he rekindles his ties with Japanese manufacturer Dome to race their Judd-engined S101, entering it in the new FIA Sportscar Championship and the Le Mans 24 Hours with young Dutch-born but Belgian-licensed Val Hillebrand as his teammate. For Le Mans, the Dutchman offers small segments of bodywork to small, private sponsors, giving the car the look of a driving chequered flag. A contribution of 2200 euros is enough to become a Racing for Holland sponsor. Lammers and Hillebrand dominate the final round of the championship before going into the new season as clear favourites, while placing themselves amongst the Audis at Le Mans. With three wins and five podiums Lammers and Hillebrand indeed take the 2002 title in the leading SR1 class, before doubling up in 2003, again with three wins and five podiums. Meanwhile in 2002, Lammers races the Crawford SSC2K at Daytona and joins Champion for Sebring to take third in their Audi R8.

When the FIA Sportscar Championship collapses after 2003, the Dome continues at Le Mans, where Lammers takes seventh in 2004 along with Elton Julian and countryman John Bosch, the trio copying the result in 2005. In the meantime, the Dutchman guests at Doran-Lista to take fourth in the 2004 Daytona 24 Hours and with Dyson Racing at Sebring and the Petit Le Mans, finishing third in the latter. In the 2005 Daytona 24 Hours, Lammers steps into the Howard-Boss Motorsports Crawford DP03 to claim another US podium with third. Rejoining them for 2006, their second cooperation gains no results.

With the start of the Le Mans Series in 2005, Racing for Holland signs up for assorted rounds in 2005, 2006 and 2007, but by now the Dome is outclassed by the more recent LMP1 designs. After he shuts down the team while continuing to pay off its debts well into the next decade, Lammers returns as a gun for hire in 2008. In an LMP2 season dominated by Jos Verstappen and the Van Merksteijn Porsche RS Spyder, Lammers teams up with the Swiss Horag-Lista team’s RS Spyder to finish the year fourth in class, along with teammate Didier Theys. At Le Mans in 2008, he joins Greg Pickett and Klaus Graf in the Charouz Racing System Lola-Judd B07/17, but the car fails to finish.

Having gone into semi-retirement from 2010, Lammers hooks up with Hope Racing to race the experimental SwissHyTech Hybrid-engined ORECA 01, and does one 2016 Le Mans Cup round in the Racing Team Holland Ligier-Nissan JSP3, but waits until 2017 for his final foray in top-level prototype racing, signing up for a three-year spell with Racing Team Nederland, the team funded by Dutch supermarket mogul Frits van Eerd. Racing their Dallara-Gibson P217 in the LMP2 class of the European Le Mans Series, Lammers and Van Eerd claim a seventh and eighth as their best results in a full 2017 ELMS season. In 2018 and 2019, Lammers acts as third driver to Van Eerd and Giedo van der Garde at Le Mans before closing the curtain on his active career.

=== GTs ===
On the back of the failed DAMS Formula One project, Lammers joins the Lotus Racing outfit for BPR Global GT in 1996. The GTI team is headed by countryman Toine Hezemans along with Ian Foley and George Howard-Chappell and runs a pair of Lotus Esprit V8s in the GT1 category. Teamed with Alex Portman, Perry McCarthy, Chris Goodwin, Andy Wallace, Fabien Giroix and Mike Hezemans, he claims pole at the Nürburgring and takes second at Silverstone, but apart from that the car proves very unreliable. In 1997, its Lotus Elise GT1 successor is outclassed by McLaren-BMW and Mercedes in the inaugural FIA GT Championship. After the Lotus takeover by Proton, the GT1 programme is quickly canned.

In 1998, Lammers races the Bitter GT1 for Team Hezemans before switching to GT2 with Roock Racing and Konrad Motorsport, while helping to develop Nissan’s new R390 GT1 car. At Le Mans, he joins Erik Comas and Andrea Montermini to finish sixth, as the Nissans get beaten by Porsche’s 911 GT1. Late in the season, Lammers returns to Konrad to share a 911 GT2 with Franz Konrad in the Petit Le Mans, followed by a win at Laguna Seca.

Following a five-year GT break, the Dutchman teams up with Prodrive to drive their Ferrari 550 Maranello in the 2003 Petit Le Mans, finishing fourth in the GTS class, and then in 2008, having closed down his own team, Lammers makes a few guest appearances in GT racing, driving the Spa 24 Hours in the Lamborghini Murciélago R-GT for the IPB-Spartak team. Meanwhile, he does a full season of ADAC GT sharing Reiter Engineering’s Lamborghini Gallardo GT3 with countryman Marius Ritskes, with three second places as his best results. Continuing in 2009 under the Racing Team Holland banner (not to be confused with Racing for Holland), the duo fails to score any more points. A one-off at Spa in the team’s GT4 Ford Mustang FR500C fails to materialise.

Another single GT4 appearance takes place in 2016 with a Ginetta G55 GT4 drive in the Paul Ricard 24 Hours for Team Africa Le Mans. His final two GT races come at his farewell weekend at Le Mans in 2019, sharing a Bentley Continental GT3 with Greg Mills for the same Team Africa Le Mans.

== Other championships ==

=== IndyCar ===
In 1985, Lammers grabs the opportunity to make his IndyCar debut, taking a drive with the small AMI Racing team. His strong performance in their March-Cosworth 85C allows him to be snapped up by the Forsythe-Green team, racing their Lola-Cosworth T800 and T900 in the final three races of the season, The Dutchman immediately scores points for them with fifth at Laguna Seca. At Miami, Lammers challenges Danny Sullivan for victory before making a mistake towards the end. This leads to Dan Gurney’s All-American Racers signing Lammers as their lead driver for the 1986 season, but that year’s Eagle GC86 proves uncompetitive and Gurney withdraws the team ahead of the Indianapolis 500. Taking over the Machinists Union GC86 for three races later in the season leads to an eighth at Laguna Seca and ninth at Miami.

=== F3000 ===
1986 is a season that proves Lammers’ ultimate versatility, as he races in IndyCars, the WSC and Formula 3 while also taking up on an offer from Eddie Jordan Racing to replace Russell Spence in the team’s March-Cosworth 86B. His single appearance at the Le Mans-Bugatti circuit results in an 11th-place finish.

In 1991, while waiting for Toyota’s new sportscar programme to come on song, Lammers is in Japan to help Dome with the development of the Mugen-engined F102, their new F3000 car. Rewarded with a one-off race outing at Suzuka, he takes third in his single appearance in the All-Nippon F3000 Championship.

More F3000 follows in 1993 after his Formula One deal with March fails to materialise. Accepting an offer to join the Italian Il Barone Rampante team to follow in the footsteps of Rubens Barrichello, Lammers takes fourth at Enna as his best result before the team is forced to close shop before the end of the season.

Two years later, Lammers is back in F3000 as he joins the Vortex team owned by Dutch transport magnate Henny Vollenberg. He wins the F3000 South African GP at Kyalami, beating Kenny Bräck and teammate Tarso Marques, and does three more European rounds before quitting the team when key staff decide to leave.

=== Macau GP ===
Making a surprise return to Formula 3, Lammers joins the Macau GP grid in 1985, racing a Ralt-Volkswagen RT30 for Intersport Racing. He embarrasses many of the regulars by qualifying and finishing third. In 1986, he repeats the trick with Murray Taylor Racing’s similar Ralt, again finishing third. Returning to Intersport in 1987, Lammers goes one better to take second place in their Ralt-Toyota RT31, storming up from 11th on the grid, while his final Macau appearance comes in 1988, again with Intersport. This time, he hauls his Ralt-Toyota RT32 up to sixth from 17th on the grid.
=== BTCC ===
After his less successful 1993 season, Lammers makes a surprise move to join the touring car trail during the BTCC’s burgeoning Super Touring era. Teaming with his old friends from TWR, he becomes teammate to Rickard Rydell in a pair of Volvo 850 SE cars. With its estate shape, the 850 SE is a crowd puller but it lacks ultimate pace and Lammers finishes no higher than fifth.

== One-make series ==

=== BMW Procar ===
In 1980, during his time at ATS and Ensign, Lammers takes part in the second season of the BMW M1 Procar Series that is run on Grand Prix weekends, with several Grand Prix drivers such as Jones, Lauda, Pironi and Piquet being part of the show. Lammers wins the opening race at Donington Park, finishes second at Avus and the Norisring, starts from pole position at Monaco and is the title favourite until Hans-Joachim Stuck drives him off the track at Imola.

=== Renault 5 Turbo Cup ===
In his final Formula One season, Lammers becomes a regular in the European Renault 5 Turbo Cup, representing Renault Netherlands and taking home one win. He continues in the series in 1983 to take four wins and the championship, and repeats the trick in even more dominant fashion in 1984, lifting eight victories on his way to the title.

=== Grand Prix Masters ===
In 2005 and 2006, the Grand Prix Masters are set up as a one-make motor racing series featuring retired Formula One drivers. Lammers takes part in the sole event of 2005, finishing ninth at Kyalami, and also races in both 2006 events, taking seventh at Losail and retiring from the race at Silverstone.

=== VW Scirocco R-Cup ===
Having already retired as a full-time professional driver, Lammers guests in four races across three seasons (2010, 2011 and 2013) of the VW Scirocco R-Cup, with ninth in the 2013 Hockenheim round as his best result.

== Other appearances ==

=== Rallies ===

As further proof of his versatility, Lammers adds the Dutch Tulpenrallye to his portfolio in 1979, driving for the Opel Dealer Team. Over two decades later, he is invited to join Frits van Eerd’s new Dakar Rally enterprise in 2010. In the first of five Dakar outings in the Ginaf X2222 4x4 truck, Lammers fails to finish, before returning in the Ginaf works team in 2011, finishing 19th, and three more years with his own Ginaf-supported team, with 25th place in 2013 as his best result. In 2012, Lammers revives the chequered Racing for Holland livery for a sponsorship concept similar to the one he explored in the previous decade.

== Team principal ==
Next to his career as a professional racing driver, Lammers has acted as the team principal of his own team on three very different occasions.

=== Vitaal Racing ===
Between 1989 and 1991, Lammers runs his Opel Dealerteam Holland-supported Vitaal Racing outfit in Formula Opel Lotus. In his first year, he joins forces with Marlboro Challenge winner Peter Kox, and together they win the EFDA Opel Lotus Euroseries as well as the Benelux series. In 1990, Lammers takes on another Marlboro Challenge winner, as Marcel Albers is promoted from Formula Ford, resulting in sixth in the final European standings.

=== Racing for Holland ===
Setting up Racing for Holland at the start of the 21st century proves to be the birth of Lammers’ final period of sportscar success at the highest level. With their Dome-Judd S101, Racing for Holland takes two consecutive titles in the FIA Sportscar Championship in 2002 and 2003 and continues with the Dome until 2007. Lammers later revives the Racing for Holland moniker – and a similar sponsorship scheme – for three of his Dakar outings in the following decade.

=== A1GP ===
Not known as Racing for Holland as such, the team is the seatholder for the Netherlands in the A1 Grand Prix series that runs between 2005 and 2009. Lammers starts off with Jos Verstappen as his driver, who takes victory at Durban in the opening 2005-’06 season, while Jeroen Bleekemolen acts as the team’s reserve driver. Bleekemolen steps up into the leading role for in 2006-’07, winning the Beijing street race, as Renger van der Zande takes his place as a backup driver, himself taking part in three races. Bleekemolen continues in 2007-’08, now supported by Arie Luyendyk Jr. Ditching its cheap Avon-shod Lola-Zytek chassis for pukka Michelin-tyred Ferrari cars, the A1GP organisation hurry into bankruptcy in a final 2008-‘09 season in which Robert Doornbos and Jeroen Bleekemolen take turns at the wheel, each winning a sprint race on their way to fourth for the Netherlands in the final standings.

== New responsibilities ==

=== Dutch GP ===
After his decision to go into full retirement after the 2019 season, Lammers quickly assumes another duty, as he steps in to become sporting director of the organisation founded to revive the Dutch GP at Zandvoort. Starting in 2020, Lammers is more than just an ambassador for the event, and after a Covid-induced postponement in 2020, the Dutch dream is finally realised in 2021, when the first Dutch GP since 1985 is staged.

== Personal life ==
Lammers has two children from his marriage with Fardous Hashem.

Currently, Lammers is in a relationship since 2001 with Mariska Hoyinck. Together they have a son, René.

Lammers’ youngest son René Lammers is currently competing in karts. The 15-year-old is a frontrunner in the FIA European Karting Championship, having won both the WSK Super Masters Series and WSK Champions Cup in 2021 as well as the WSK Euro Series in 2020 in the 60 Mini category. Young Lammers is also a two-time winner of the Trofeo Andrea Margutti and also competed in the shootout for a place in the Ferrari Driver Academy.

<text>Jean Marie Behra (16 February 1921 – 1 August 1959) was a Formula One driver who raced for the Gordini, Maserati, BRM, Ferrari and Porsche teams.

==Appearance and personality==
Behra was small in stature, stocky, and weighed 178 pounds. Behra had big shoulders and was scarred from 12 crashes. In 1955 he had an ear torn off from a collision. He sometimes drove magnificently, while at other times he drove with a lack of enthusiasm. Behra was known for being hard-charging and temperamental, which led to confrontations with Ferrari team managers after being accused of overstressing engines at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Reims Grand Prix race in 1959. He was dismissed from the Ferrari team after assaulting a team manager, shortly before his death.

==Career synopsis==
He raced motorcycles for Moto Guzzi prior to changing to sports cars and Grand Prix racing. In January 1950 he drove (with Julio Quinlin) a Simca 8 coupé to third place in the Monte Carlo Rally. Behra began driving cars competitively in 1952. Joakim Bonnier claimed that he learned the majority of his racing skill from Behra. Although he never achieved victory in a World Championship Formula One race, he managed an unquenchable thirst for motorsport, being considered a formidable competitor to the day he died. He hit the headlines when he won the non-title 1952 Reims Grand Prix. Between then and 1959 he scored many victories, but none in Formula One World Championship races.

==Gordini==
Behra was in a Gordini in the Panamericana road race in the Mexican state of Oaxaca in November 1952. He won the first stage of the five-day race from Mexico&#x27;s southern border to the United States border at Ciudad Juárez near El Paso. He started 19th and finished with a time of 3 hours, 41 minutes, and 44 seconds. On the second day of competition Behra crashed his car on a curve approximately fifty miles from Puebla. In April 1954 Behra passed the leader in the last ten minutes on his way to victory in the Grand Prix of Pau, France. He finished ahead of Maurice Trintignant after having to make many pit stops due to mechanical trouble. Behra drove a six-cylinder Gordini.

==Maserati==
Behra finished first at the Grand Prix de Pau for a second consecutive year, this time at the wheel of a Maserati. Alberto Ascari led until the 19th lap but dropped back after brake failure. A crowd of 50,000 watched as only eleven of sixteen starters finished the race. Behra and Luigi Musso were teammates in the 1,008 kilometer Supercortemaggiore Grand Prix at Monza, Italy. The two Italians shared a 3000cc Maserati that won and established course and lap records for 6.3 kilometer track.

Behra had surgery on his leg in June 1956,
forcing him to miss a 1,000 kilometer Monza Grand Prix. He earned the pole position for the Rouen GP, a non-championship race for 3000cc sports cars, in July 1956. His Maserati was clocked at an average speed of nearly 155.46 kilometers per hour. Behra drove a Maserati to capture the Grand Prix of Rome, a 2000cc sports car event, in October 1956. His winning distance was 166.030 kilometers. He covered one lap in 2 minutes, 16.9 seconds, to average 174.003 kilometers an hour. This established a record for the Castelfusano track.

Behra had his best season in the Formula One World Championship in 1956, finishing 4th overall in the championship, with 5 podiums out of 7 starts.

In April 1957 Behra turned in the quickest time for the Pau Grand Prix. He circuited the 2.77 meter course in
1 minute 35.7 seconds, which was a half second slower than his lap record time. The race covered a distance of 304.6 kilometers or about . Behra won the race which was run through the streets of Pau, with an average speed of .
Behra was injured while testing a car for the Mille Miglia in May 1957. He recovered and entered a Maserati in the 24 hours of Le Mans on 22 June. Behra was triumphant in a Maserati at Kristianstad, Sweden in August 1957. He drove in a Swedish 6-hour Grand Prix at the Rabelov, 6,537 meter,
asphalt track. He followed this with a win in the Grand Prix of Modena, Italy in September.

==Porsche==
Behra drove a Porsche to victory in the 6th Rouen Grand Prix. He bested the British drivers, Graham Hill and Alan Stacey. Behra took 4th place at Oporto in the 1958 Portuguese Grand Prix, driving for BRM. He drove a Porsche to achieve first place in the Grand Prix of Berlin, Germany held in September. He
navigated the twenty circuits of the track with a time of . in 48 minutes, 14.8 seconds. Altogether he scored wins in 8 straight European races in 1958. In each sports car event he piloted a Porsche Spyder. In Formula One he drove exclusively for BRM that year. Behra
finished 4th at Riverside International Raceway in a small Porsche RSK, in October 1958. He made a quick exit and took an airplane to Europe,
where he left for the Grand Prix of Morocco at Casablanca. He
was in such a hurry that he left Riverside, California in an ambulance to make his flight.

==Final season and death==
In 1959 he moved to Ferrari where he partnered with Tony Brooks. Behra won a international race of Formula One cars at Aintree, in April 1959. He averaged 88.7 miles per hour in an event in which Brooks took second place, 10 seconds behind.

While still contracted to the team, he began development of a Formula Two car based on a Porsche 718 RSK. The team, known as Behra-Porsche, entered the 1959 Monaco Grand Prix with Maria Teresa de Filippis at the wheel but did not qualify. Despite the lack of initial success, Behra regarded the project as &quot;tremendous fun&quot; and was rewarded when Hans Herrmann drove the car to second in the prestigious Reims F2 race supporting that year&#x27;s French Grand Prix. In so doing, Behra had beaten Scuderia Ferrari&#x27;s own F2 entries, enraging Enzo Ferrari and doing little to ease tensions in an already strained relationship with the team. Things came to a head later that weekend, after he retired from the Grand Prix with a piston failure. Behra was involved in a strong discussion in a restaurant in which he punched team manager Romolo Tavoni and another patron, and was instantly dismissed from the team.

Less than a month later he crashed his Porsche RSK in rainy weather in the sports car race that preceded the German Grand Prix at AVUS, in Berlin, Germany. He was thrown from his car and fatally injured when he hit a flagpole, causing a skull fracture.

The sports car race featured entries of small, under 1,500 c.c. engine capacity. After three laps Behra
was third behind Wolfgang von Trips and Bonnier, who eventually finished one and two.
The AVUS was unique among race tracks. It used a strip of the Autobahn in length. The north and south bound lanes were fifty feet apart. At one end was a hairpin turn which drivers negotiated at around . At the other end was a high, steeply banked loop. Behra lost control in the pouring rain, while going . The Porsche began to fishtail with the tail of the car going higher and higher up the slick, steep bank. Then the Porsche spun and went over the top of the banking, with its nose pointing toward the sky. It landed heavily on its side on top of the banking. It remained there wrecked, while the race continued on underneath. Behra was thrown out and for a fleeting moment he could be seen against the background of the sky, with his arms outstretched as though attempting to fly. He impacted one of eight flagpoles arranged at the summit of the embankment
which bore the flags of the competing nations. The flagpole toppled over when Behra collided with it,
about halfway to its top.

Behra came down into trees and rolled almost into a street where drivers and cars often waited in a paddock to practice. A doctor arrived from a Red Cross ambulance close by. He examined Behra briefly and shook his head. A hospital bulletin stated that Behra broke most of his ribs in addition to the skull fracture which killed him. Currently AVUS is a vital part of the German public highway system as Autobahn A 115.

==Mourning==
Behra was buried in Nice on 7 August, six days after his fatal crash. He had three funeral services: one in Berlin, another in Paris, and a final one in Nice. At the Nice service, 3,000 mourners lined the streets from wall to wall.

Behra left a nineteen-year-old son, Jean Paul. Behra&#x27;s demise left only Maurice Trintignant among living French drivers of fame. Trintignant comforted Behra&#x27;s family and called on the young men of France to defend the colours of their country in international motor racing. Conspicuously absent among those present in the racing community was Enzo Ferrari. He dropped Behra as a factory driver ten days before his death when he learned that Behra was going to race a Porsche at Avus in breach of their agreement and sent no remembrance to the funeral masses.

<doc id="1226469" wikidata="Q1321244" url="?curid=1226469" title="William George Aston">
<text>William George Aston (9 April 1841 – 22 November 1911) was an Anglo-Irish diplomat, author, and scholar of the languages and histories of Korea and Japan.

==Early life==
Aston was born near Derry, Ireland. He distinguished himself at Queen&#x27;s College, Belfast (now Queen&#x27;s University Belfast), which he attended 1859–1863. There he received a very thorough philological training in Latin, Greek, French, German and modern history. One of his professors was James McCosh.

==Career==
Aston was appointed in 1864 student interpreter to the British Legation in Japan. He mastered the theory of the Japanese verb, and in Edo began, with Ernest Mason Satow, those profound researches into the Japanese language which laid the foundations of the critical study of the Japanese language by western scholars. Aston passed the examination for entry to the Consular Service in 1884, and served in the British consular service in Tokyo, Kobe and Nagasaki.

From 1884 to 1885, Aston served as the United Kingdom&#x27;s consul-general in Korea. He returned to consular duties in Tokyo as Secretary of British Legation in 1885. Aston retired from the foreign service on a pension in 1889 because of ill-health and settled in England. He was appointed CMG in the 1889 Birthday Honours.

===Japan===
Aston made a major contribution to the fledgling study of Japan&#x27;s language and history in the 19th century. Along with Ernest Mason Satow and Basil Hall Chamberlain, he was one of three major British Japanologists active in Japan during the 19th century.

Aston was the first translator of the &quot;Nihongi&quot; into the English language (1896). Other publications were two Japanese grammars (1868 and 1872) and &quot;A History of Japanese Literature&quot; (1899). He lectured to the Asiatic Society of Japan several times, and many of his papers are published in their &quot;Transactions&quot;.

In 1912 Cambridge University Library acquired 10,000 rare Japanese volumes from the collections of Aston and Satow which formed the starting point of the Library&#x27;s Japanese collection.

Okamoto Kidō recalls in chapter eleven on the development and adaption of drama of his book, 明治劇談ランプの下にて, Meiji Gekidan Ranpu no Shitanite (On the Theatre of the Meiji Period - Under the Lamp) (in English) meeting Aston at the British Legation...

Inevitably, I made up my mind to read the scripts of a foreign country. Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I was at the time occasionally babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that I would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.

But that I didn’t appreciate the techniques of playwriting from just listening it was certainly kind of him and I certainly often went to his room to listen to and discuss drama. The following summer, July if I remember correctly, I went as usual to visit him when Mr. Aston, laughing, said &#x27;similarly you don’t know about this person’s publications&#x27; and showed me five books containing six volumes in temporary bindings which had been published. They, the Kawatake Mokuami script series, had been published as articles by the Ginza’s Kabuki Shinpō (Kabuki News) Company. They covered &#x27;Nakamitsu&#x27;, &#x27;Four Thousand Ryō&#x27; (Yonsenryō) (in Japanese) and ‘Kagatobi’. When I went I had no idea that they had been successively published and had been delivered from a Ginza bookstore. I leapt for joy and straight away started going to him and borrowing them so that I could indulge myself by reading them.
===Korea===
In 1884, Aston was the first European diplomatic representative to reside in Korea. Political instability caused him to leave in 1885. In 1885–1887, Aston continued Korean language studies in Tokyo with Kim Chae-guk. This Korean teacher composed a number of stories for Aston to use as practice. Aston donated these manuscript versions of Korean folk tales to the Asiatic Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia and they were published in 2004. This part of Aston&#x27;s personal collection is now preserved in the Academy of Sciences in St Petersburg.

==Later years==
After retiring from the consular service, Aston published books on Japanese literature and Japanese religion as well as a number of articles on Korean subjects. He died 22 November 1911 at Beer, Devon. Along with the Japanese books already mentioned Aston&#x27;s substantial collection of Chinese and Korean books was acquired by Cambridge University Library after his death.

==Research notes==
The only known likeness of Aston is in the National Portrait Gallery in London. A 1911 crayon drawing of Aston by Minnie Agnes Cohen only suggests what he might have looked like as a younger man. Very little is known about Aston&#x27;s personal life because he left no letters or diaries.

<doc id="1226470" wikidata="Q171462" url="?curid=1226470" title="Jean-Pierre Jabouille">
<text>Jean-Pierre Alain Jabouille (1 October 1942 – 2 February 2023) was a French racing driver and engineer, who competed in Formula One from to . Jabouille won two Formula One Grands Prix over the course of seven seasons.

Jabouille raced in 55 Formula One Grands Prix, collecting two wins during the first years of Renault&#x27;s turbocharged programme in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Jabouille also raced the 24 Hours of Le Mans from the late 1960s to the early 1990s, driving for Alpine, Matra, Sauber, and Peugeot and collecting four third-place overall finishes in 1973, 1974, 1992, and 1993.

==Early and personal life==
Jean-Pierre Alain Jabouille was born on 1 October 1942 in Paris, then occupied by Nazi Germany.

==Career==
Jabouille first made his mark in French Formula Three in 1967, and continued in 1968, maintaining the car himself on his way to the runner up spot behind François Cevert. For 1969 he was contracted as a development driver by Alpine, having several disjointed runs in Formula Two and sports cars. In 1973, he co-drove a Matra to 3rd at the Le Mans 24 Hours, and repeated this feat in 1974, when he also won the Formula neo race at Hockenheim, and finished as runner-up in the European 2-litre series for Alpine. He also made his first appearances in Formula One, failing to qualify an Iso–Marlboro at the French Grand Prix, and a Surtees at the Austrian Grand Prix.

1975 saw Jabouille sever his ties with Alpine, and gain Elf backing to make his own Formula Two chassis. He finished runner-up to Jacques Laffite, but finally made his full Grand Prix debut, finishing 12th in a works Tyrrell at the French Grand Prix. For 1976 he concentrated on Formula Two, finally winning the title.

===Formula One===
Jabouille was signed up by Formula One team Renault to develop their new 1.5l turbocharged engine for 1977. The RS01 car debuted at the 1977 British Grand Prix, but initially the turbo engine (a first for Formula One) was fragile and suffered from severe turbo lag, making it difficult to drive on tight circuits. However, Jabouille, who was an engineer by trade persevered and developed the RS01 throughout, recording several notable qualifying positions in 1978, and landed the marque&#x27;s first points with 4th place at the United States Grand Prix East at Watkins Glen, a circuit particularly tough on fuel consumption- one of the Renault turbo&#x27;s biggest weaknesses.

1979 saw Renault expand to run a second car for René Arnoux. Jabouille secured Renault&#x27;s first Formula One pole at the South African Grand Prix, and then won their first victory, fittingly at the French Grand Prix, also from pole. This was the first victory for a turbocharged car in Formula One. He took two more poles, at the German and Italian Grands Prix, but poor reliability meant the win was his only score.

In 1980, Jabouille took two more poles and another win at the Austrian Grand Prix. A suspension failure in the Canadian Grand Prix caused a sizeable accident, which left him with a broken leg, just after he had signed with Ligier for 1981. His injuries saw him sit out the first two races of the 1981 season, but it soon became clear he was not fully fit, failing to qualify for two of his four attempts, at which point he decided to retire from Formula One. Subsequently, he stayed with Ligier and became team manager in 1982. In 1984 he transferred to Ligier&#x27;s joint entry with Curb Racing in the 1984 CART series, as team manager.

===Sportscars===
Jabouille returned to racing in the mid-1980s, driving in the French Supertouring Championship before joining Peugeot to help develop their sports car programme at the 24 Hours of Le Mans. This culminated in third places for the marque in both the 1992 and 1993 races. In 1994 he succeeded Jean Todt as director of Peugeot Sport, but unsuccessful seasons for Peugeot as engine suppliers in Formula One with McLaren and Jordan saw him sacked in 1995. Following that, he ran his own sports car team in the ISRS.
==Death==
Jabouille died on 2 February 2023 at the age of 80.

<text>Jyrki Juhani Järvilehto (; born 31 January 1966), commonly known as JJ Lehto, is a Finnish former racing driver and broadcaster, who competed in Formula One from to . In sportscar racing, Lehto won the American Le Mans Series in 2004 and is a two-time winner of the 24 Hours of Le Mans in and , as well as a two-time winner of the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1999 and 2005.

Born and raised in Espoo, Lehto began competitive kart racing aged eight before graduating to Formula Ford in 1981. A protégé of 1982 World Drivers&#x27; Champion Keke Rosberg, Lehto won several national and continental Formula Ford titles prior to dominating the 1988 British Formula Three Championship with Pacific. Lehto competed at 70 Formula One Grands Prix for Onyx, Italia, Sauber and Benetton, making his debut at the 1989 Portuguese Grand Prix with the former. He achieved a podium finish with Italia at the 1991 San Marino Grand Prix.

Upon retiring from motor racing, Lehto became a commentator and pundit for MTV3. In June 2010, Lehto was injured in a boating incident in Ekenäs, during which an unnamed associate was killed. Lehto was found guilty of negligent homicide and driving under the influence, and sentenced to 28 months in prison. He appealed the conviction to the Turku Court of Appeal, who overturned the verdict in November 2012, due to inconclusive evidence that Lehto was driving the boat.

==Early career==
Like many racing drivers Lehto began in karts at age 8, winning numerous events, before graduating to Formula Ford at the early age of 15. A switch to single seaters saw him dominate the Scandinavian Formula Ford. He then won the British and European Formula 2000 championship in 1987 and went on to win the coveted British Formula 3 title in 1988, driving for Pacific Racing. In 1989 Lehto drove in Formula 3000, again for Pacific Racing. The season was not successful and he failed to score any podium finishes. He did not participate in the last race which was held in Dijon-Prenois. He was a protégé of Finnish 1982 Formula One World Champion Keke Rosberg, who first suggested that Jyrki Järvilehto should abbreviate his name to the more manageable JJ Lehto.

==Formula One career==
In 1989 Lehto tested for Ferrari before making his Formula One debut for the Onyx team as a late-season replacement for Bertrand Gachot. Though he failed to prequalify for his first race at Estoril he impressed with his speed in the tough sessions and made his first start in the following meeting. In the wet season finale at Adelaide he ran as high as 5th before retiring with waterlogged electrics. Over the summer Onyx were sold to Swiss racer turned businessman Peter Monteverdi. Lehto, marked by many as a star of the future, was paired with Gregor Foitek but financial difficulties hampered his season, leading to the team&#x27;s withdrawal after the Hungarian Grand Prix (one of five events the Finn failed to qualify for – though he had been hindered by the team&#x27;s poor preparation, including a driveshaft being fitted the wrong way around for several meetings, and favouritism towards Foitek, whose father was involved with the buyout).

For 1991 he was signed by the ambitious Scuderia Italia team, financed by Beppe Lucchini with a Dallara chassis, Judd V10 engines and Emanuele Pirro in the second car. Due to poor results in 1990 the cars had to prequalify but soon established themselves as decent midfield runners. In the wet San Marino Grand Prix Lehto impressed by lasting in a race of attrition to finish 3rd, scoring his first F1 points. He impressed elsewhere but did not score again through poor reliability and bad luck (only finishing on four other occasions). He stayed with the team in 1992, now paired with Pierluigi Martini and using Ferrari V12 engines but the new Dallara B192 chassis had severe handling problems. Lehto&#x27;s best result was 7th at Spa, his worst a failure to qualify at the Hungaroring.

He landed the second seat (alongside Austrian Karl Wendlinger) at the new, much-anticipated Sauber team for 1993, running Ilmor engines. The season started very well as Lehto survived a late downpour at Kyalami to score 5th place on the team&#x27;s debut, then finished 4th at Imola despite a late engine failure. However, after a collision with Wendlinger at Monaco his relationship with both his teammate and Sauber became frosty and his season tailed off with no more points scored.

For 1994 he saw off competition from Michele Alboreto and Luca Badoer to land the second seat at Benetton alongside Michael Schumacher. However, he injured his neck testing the new B194 in pre-season with test driver Jos Verstappen taking his place for the first two rounds of the championship. Lehto returned to the cockpit for the ill-fated San Marino Grand Prix despite some question marks over his fitness. He qualified 5th but stalled on the grid, his car being struck from behind by Pedro Lamy&#x27;s Lotus. Despite running 3rd in Spain before an engine failure and scoring a point in Canada (after the disqualification of Christian Fittipaldi) it was clear his injuries had not healed fully and he was replaced once again by Verstappen for the French Grand Prix. He returned to the cockpit for the Italian and Portuguese rounds in place of the suspended Schumacher but did not impress and was released entirely soon afterwards when the team signed Johnny Herbert. This freed him up to drive in the last two rounds for Sauber – Wendlinger&#x27;s injuries from an accident in practice before the 1994 Monaco GP had failed to heal and his previous replacement Andrea de Cesaris was unreachable.

==Post-Formula One career==

After his Formula One career stalled, and advised by his manager Keke Rosberg, Lehto joined the German Touring Car Championship, DTM, in 1995 and 1996. Even though rated highly, victories eluded him, but this loss was probably made up by his successes in GT and sports car racing.
He was a late addition to the 1995 edition of the 24 Hours of Le Mans in a McLaren F1 GTR, but he won the race outright, at his third attempt, sharing the car with Yannick Dalmas and Masanori Sekiya. Lehto was an integral part of the win, gaining the lead for the team by driving a few stints during the rainy night. While others were driving cautiously, Lehto was seen to be sliding the car, lapping at times 30sec faster than everyone else. He had three more guest appearances in the same car the next year, winning another race, before he got picked up by BMW to join the factory squad in the inaugural FIA GT season, partnering Steve Soper. Even though success came initially easily, including a win in front of his home crowd at the Thunder In Helsinki event, the might of Mercedes-Benz caught up with the McLarens and left Lehto conceding the title to former DTM rival Bernd Schneider.

After an unsuccessful 1998 campaign as a Mercedes-Benz factory driver in the American-based single-seater CART series with Team Hogan, Lehto stayed Stateside but returned to the BMW camp, which entered their V12 LMR sportscar racer in the American Le Mans Series, ALMS. Even though he ended up winning four races, Lehto lost the title on the account of a formality (he was not awarded the points gained for winning the 12 Hours of Sebring because he did not have an American racing license at that time). 2000 proved less successful as the near-unbeatable Audi R8 entered the scene.

BMW and Lehto stayed in the ALMS series, but stepped down to the GT-class with the controversial M3 GTR. The team was virtually unbeatable but Lehto lost out in the championship to the driver he shared the car with, Jörg Müller, as the latter had more fastest laps and laps in the lead to his name.

He found the M3 already not fast enough to his liking, so it was not surprising when Lehto turned down BMW&#x27;s offer to join them in the European Touring Car Championship (ETCC) the following year, having to race a near standard 320i tin-top racer. 2002 started with unemployment, but he was picked up by Cadillac as an addition to their Northstar LMP sportscar programme at Le Mans and in the ALMS series. Although the car was not on the pace of the Audi R8s or Panoz LMPs, the car&#x27;s fortunes did seem to turn for the better when it started to notch up regular podium finishes in the second half of the year. Cadillac&#x27;s mother company General Motors pulled the plug on the project, leaving Lehto again without a job if it had not been for Champion Racing, who offered him a drive in their Audi R8.

Lehto won four times in 2003 (including the prestigious Petit Le Mans event at Road Atlanta), but it was not until the factory Audi squad left the ALMS series that he was finally able to reap full rewards in 2004 and score his first championship success since his 1988 title in the British Formula Three, picking up six victories on the way.

A disappointing second half of the 2005 season prevented him from scoring double championship success, but nonetheless he managed to end his last year in full-time racing on an impressive note when winning both the 12 Hours of Sebring and the 24 Hours of Le Mans again.

In 2006 it was announced the Solaroli team would purchase two Porsche RS Spyders to be entered in the ALMS series. One car would be driven by Lehto, partnered by Johnny Herbert. However, even though getting confirmation about the deal going through in early 2007, nothing ever materialised.

Lehto did show up at the 2007 edition of the 24 Hours of Daytona to team up with Colin Braun and Max Papis in the Krohn Racing Pontiac-Riley. His first participation in the event was not a success though as the car suffered from a misfire, and after having spent a long time in the pits, finished 17th.

In 2008 he made an unexpected return to the race tracks when he showed up at the Malaysian Grand Prix to drive in the Speedcar support race, taking over the No. 90 car previously vacated by Narain Karthikeyan.

In 2001 Lehto joined Finnish television as an expert race commentator and remained a mainstay at MTV3&#x27;s Finnish Formula One race broadcasts (and also for the pay-channel MTV3 MAX) until 2010, alongside Oskari Saari.

== Boating incident ==

On 17 June 2010, Lehto was involved in a boating incident in Ekenäs. The incident happened when the boat carrying Lehto and his friend, whose identity was not released, hit the base of a bridge in a canal. Lehto was injured and the other man was killed in the incident. Lehto had been drinking throughout the day and was heavily intoxicated at the time of the incident.

In January 2011, &quot;Ilta-Sanomat&quot; reported that the police investigations had concluded that no one besides Lehto could have been driving the boat at the time of the incident. Lehto faced charges of negligent homicide, reckless driving and driving under the influence. Regardless of the pending trial, Lehto made a return to sportscasting on the Finnish sports-channel , commentating on a DTM event. On 14 December 2011, the District Court found Lehto guilty of drunk sailing and negligent homicide, and sentenced him to two years and four months in prison. Lehto however appealed the decision, and on 30 November 2012, the Turku Court of Appeal cleared him of all charges relating to the incident, finding the evidence regarding who had been driving the boat inconclusive.

<text>Sandhurst is a village in the borough of Tunbridge Wells in Kent, England, close to the border with East Sussex. It is situated on the A268 road near the villages of Hawkhurst and Northiam.

The Black Death in 1348-49 is believed to be the cause of why the church in Sandhurst is so far from the main village, although it could also be explained by an increase in trade heading from Hawkhurst to Rye, where the majority of the village now rests.

==Facilities==
* Sandhurst Primary School is in the centre of the village and was founded in 1909.
* &#x27;Johnson&#x27;s of Sandhurst&#x27;, formerly &#x27;Mace&#x27; after a supplier change, is the main shop, selling a variety of food and other items as well as housing the post office. There are also a beauty salon, a tea room, a garage and a hardware store.
* St. Nicholas&#x27; Church is located in Sandhurst Cross, about a mile south from the main village. There is also a Baptist church, located on the A268, Rye Road.
* Sandhurst windmill (Ringle Crouch Green) has been rebuilt from the base, which was all that remained. It now serves as a house, but supplies electricity.
* There is a social club on the back road in the village, open to members and guests, providing live entertainment as well as facilities for darts, pool, and television.
* The New Swan is the only public house in the village, offering food and drinks as well as regular live entertainment and karaoke nights.
* There are two tea rooms in the village.

==Roads==
The main road through the village is the A268, Rye Road. Bodiam Road leads to Bodiam in the south; Sponden Lane at the western end of the village goes to Benenden, to the north of the village. Sandhurst is served by the Arriva Southern Counties number 5 bus to Maidstone, but not on Sundays.

==Twinning==
Sandhurst is twinned with the village of Heuringhem in northern France. There is an active Sandhurst Twinning Association.

==Landmarks==
Significant landmarks in the village include the clock tower, which was built in 1889 in memory of Arthur Oakes and is a grade II listed building, and Sandhurst War Memorial, which was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and unveiled in 1923 and sits in an elaborate setting; it is also grade II listed.

<doc id="1226482" wikidata="Q161090" url="?curid=1226482" title="Galium odoratum">
<text>Galium odoratum, the sweet woodruff or sweetscented bedstraw, is a flowering perennial plant in the family Rubiaceae, native to much of Europe. It is widely cultivated for its flowers and its sweet-smelling foliage.

==Description==

A herbaceous plant, it grows to long, often lying flat on the ground or supported by other plants. The leaves are simple, lanceolate, glabrous, long, and borne in whorls of 6–9. The small (4–7 mm diameter) flowers are produced in cymes, each white with four petals joined together at the base. The fruits are 2–4 mm diameter, produced singly, and each is covered in tiny hooked bristles which help disperse them by sticking temporarily to clothing and animal fur.

It owes its sweet smell to the presence of the compound coumarin.

==Distribution and habitat==
The plant is native to much of Europe from Spain and Ireland to Russia, as well as Western Siberia, Turkey, Iran, the Caucasus, China and Japan. It is also sparingly naturalised in scattered locations in the United States and Canada.

==Ecology==
This plant prefers partial to full shade in moist, rich soils. In dry summers it needs frequent watering. Propagation is by crown division, separation of the rooted stems, or digging up of the barely submerged perimeter stolons. It is ideal as a groundcover or border accent in woody, acidic gardens where other shade plants fail to thrive. In the Northeast United States, deer and chickens avoid eating it.

==Toxicity==
Industrial usage of the plant for sweets was prohibited in Germany in 1974, due to coumarin, the flavorant found in woodruff, being toxic to rats and mice in studies. It has however not been found to be harmful to humans, even in large doses, in which it follows a different metabolic pathway. The flavour is still popular for sweets in Germany, but is achieved artificially with 6-methyl coumarin. Products targeted towards adults, such as alcoholic drinks, are still permitted to include coumarin, in limited quantities.

==Uses==
It is widely cultivated for its flowers and its sweet-smelling foliage.

As the epithet &quot;odoratum&quot; suggests, the plant is strongly scented, the sweet scent being derived from coumarin. This scent increases on wilting and then persists on drying, and the dried plant is used in potpourri and as a moth deterrent. It was, and partially is, used to flavour May wine (called &quot;Maibowle&quot; or &quot;Maitrank&quot; in German), sweet juice punch, syrup for beer (Berliner Weisse), brandy, jelly, jam, a soft drink (Tarhun, which is Georgian), ice cream, and herbal tea. Also very popular are sweet woodruff flavoured jellies, with and without alcohol. In Germany, where it is called Waldmeister, it was and to some extent still is also used to flavour sherbet powder, that features prominently in Günter Grass&#x27;s novel &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; (1959).

<text>A general union is a trade union (called &quot;labor union&quot; in American English) which represents workers from all industries and companies, rather than just one organisation or a particular sector, as in a craft union or industrial union. A general union differs from a union federation or trades council in that its members are individuals, not unions. The creation of general unions, from the early nineteenth century in the United Kingdom and somewhat later elsewhere, occurred around the same time as efforts began to unionise workers in new industries, in particular those where employment could be irregular.

Proponents of general unions claim that their broader range of members allows more opportunities for solidarity action and better coordination in general strikes and the like. Detractors claim that the broader remit means they tend to be more bureaucratic and respond less effectively to events in a single industry.

In the United Kingdom, general unions include the GMB and the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union. In Australia a good example of a general union is the Australian Workers&#x27; Union.

<text>Lorenzo Bandini (21 December 1935 – 10 May 1967) was an Italian racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Bandini won the 1964 Austrian Grand Prix with Ferrari. In endurance racing, Bandini won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in , as well as the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1967, both with Ferrari.

Born in Libya and raised in Florence, Bandini was initially a mechanic before competing in motorcycle racing. His racing career started in 1957, driving a borrowed Fiat 1100, before he achieved a class win at the Mille Miglia one year later. He soon progressed to Formula Junior, where he attracted the attention of Enzo Ferrari. Bandini made his Formula One debut in with Scuderia Centro Sud, before signing for Ferrari the following year. On debut for Ferrari, at the , Bandini finished third behind Bruce McLaren and teammate Phil Hill, claiming his maiden podium finish. He competed at seven Grands Prix in for both teams, amongst winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans and finishing runner-up at the 12 Hours of Sebring, driving the Ferrari 250 P. Bandini retained his seat at Ferrari in , scoring his sole victory at the —amongst several further podiums—on his way to a career-best fourth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. He scored several podiums in his and campaigns, finishing the seasons in sixth and ninth, respectively.

During the 1967 Monaco Grand Prix, Bandini was fatally injured when his Ferrari 312 overturned and caught fire. The Lorenzo Bandini Trophy was established in memorial of Bandini, honouring individuals and teams for achievements in Formula One since 1992.

==Early life==

Bandini was born in Barce in Cyrenaica, Libya, then an Italian colony. The family returned to Italy in 1939 and moved near Florence. His father died when he was 15. Bandini left home and found a job as an apprentice mechanic in the Freddi workshop in Milan.

==Racing career==
Bandini made his way into auto racing from competing on motorcycles. He started racing cars in 1957 in a borrowed Fiat 1100. Goliardo Freddi, acknowledging Bandini&#x27;s talent, decided to support him. Bandini would later marry Freddi&#x27;s daughter, Margherita, in 1963, and remained involved with the family&#x27;s garage in Milan.

He achieved a first class victory at the Mille Miglia, in a Lancia Appia Zagato, in 1958, and a class win the same year in the 500cc Berkeley in the 12-hour race at Monza. He then purchased a Volpini Formula Junior car and placed third in his first race in Sicily. In 1959 and 1960 he drove a Formula Junior Stanguellini. In 1960 he placed fourth in the Formula Junior World Championship.

In 1961 Bandini and fellow Italian driver Giancarlo Baghetti were both in contention for a Formula One seat at Scuderia Ferrari. Ferrari opted for Baghetti, and Bandini went to drive for Guglielmo &quot;Mimmo&quot; Dei&#x27;s Scuderia Centro Sud. At a non-championship race, he finished third at Pau. Bandini drove his first world championship race at Spa later in 1961. He retired with engine failure. During the winter of 1961-1962 he drove in the &quot;Tasman&quot; races in Australia and New Zealand.

In 1962 Bandini was hired by Ferrari for the 1962 and 1963 seasons, and moved to Maranello, near the team&#x27;s headquarters. His debut in a works Ferrari at the Monaco Grand Prix, finishing third.

For 1963 Bandini was retained by Ferrari for sports car races only. Along with Ludovico Scarfiotti, he won the Le Mans 24 Hours race and placed second in the Targa Florio that year, occasionally racing in Formula One for Scuderia Centro Sud. His string of good results, including a fifth place at the British Grand Prix, convinced Ferrari to retain him as a Formula One driver as well for the rest of the season.

In 1964 Bandini had his best Formula One season. He won the first Austrian Grand Prix at the Zeltweg circuit and scored two more podiums in Germany and Italy. At the Mexican Grand Prix, Bandini was running second when he decided to let his teammate John Surtees pass, enabling him to score enough points to win the World Championship.

In 1965 Bandini won the Targa Florio.

In 1966 Surtees left Ferrari in mid-season. Bandini was promoted to team leader. He was unlucky not to win the French and U.S. Grands Prix that year which he dominated before mechanical problems struck while holding a huge lead. Bandini&#x27;s best finish was a second place at the Monaco Grand Prix in a 2.4 liter V-6 Ferrari behind Jackie Stewart&#x27;s BRM. Later in the season Bandini helped director John Frankenheimer with his movie &quot;Grand Prix&quot;. Bandini recommended the location at the harbour chicane for a crash scene in the movie filmed at the Monte Carlo circuit. In &quot;The Making of Grand Prix&quot;, actress Eva Marie Saint noted bitterly that this spot would be the site of Bandini&#x27;s fatal accident in the race one year later. &quot;Grand Prix&quot; was praised for its realism of racing, to which Bandini played a big role. The movie won 3 Oscars.

In 1967 Bandini won the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 1000 km of Monza, both teamed with Chris Amon.

==Accident and death==
On 7 May 1967 Bandini was racing at the Monaco Grand Prix for Scuderia Ferrari, running second to Denny Hulme. On the entry to the harbour chicane on the 82nd lap he lost control of his open-wheel 312, its left rear wheel hit the guard rail, and sent it into an erratic skid. Impacting a light pole, the car overturned, collided with protective straw bales which lined the harbour, and trapped Bandini beneath it. 

Either sparks ignited fuel from a ruptured tank, or fuel leaked from it onto a hot brake line or exhaust pipe and it burst into flames. 
Bandini was pulled out, unconscious; a second fire occurred afterwards, when the fuel tank itself burst into flames.

Bandini, who had only ever had a minor accident in his racing career, during a 1957 Formula Junior race, was gravely injured. Sustaining third degree burns covering more than 70% of his body, a chest wound, and ten chest fractures, he succumbed three days later at the Princess Grace Polyclinic Hospital in Monte Carlo. He was 31 years old.

Though concerns were raised about the promptness of his rescue, investigators from the Principality of Monaco ruled on 10 May that the security operation had &quot;functioned properly.&quot; Straw bales were immediately banned from all Formula One races, and replaced by an extended guard-rail in Monaco the following year. 

Bandini&#x27;s funeral was held in Reggiolo on 13 May. 100,000 people attended. He was later buried in the Lambrate cemetery, in Milan.

==In popular culture==
Bandini is portrayed by Francesco Bauco in &quot;Ford v Ferrari&quot;, a 2019 film about the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans auto race.

<text>Louis Claude Rosier (5 November 1905 – 29 October 1956) was a French racing driver and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . In endurance racing, Rosier won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in in a privateer Talbot-Lago T26C-GS.

Rosier competed in Formula One under his own Écurie Rosier banner, making privateer entries in machinery from Talbot-Lago, Ferrari, and Maserati; he also competed for the works teams of Talbot and Maserati, the former of which he scored back-to-back podium finishes with at the Swiss and Belgian Grands Prix in .

Rosier competed in nine editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans between and , winning in alongside his son Jean-Louis Rosier, which remains the only father-and-son victory in Le Mans history. In October 1956, Rosier died as a result of injuries sustained whilst sportscar racing in a Ferrari 750 Monza at Montlhéry.

==Career highlights==
Louis Claude Rosier was born on 5 November 1905 in Chapdes-Beaufort, Puy-de-Dôme, France.

He participated in 38 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 13 May 1950. He achieved 2 podiums, and scored a total of 18 championship points. He won the Dutch Grand Prix twice in consecutive years between 1950 and 1951, the Circuit d&#x27;Albi, Grand-Prix de l&#x27;Albigeois and the 24 Hours of Le Mans with his son Jean-Louis Rosier. Rosier owned the Renault dealership of Clermont-Ferrand.

In 2016, in an academic paper that reported a mathematical modeling study that assessed the relative influence of driver and machine, Rosier was ranked the 19th best Formula One driver of all time.

==Formula One and sports car competition==

Rosier finished 4th at Silverstone in a Talbot, in October 1948. The event was the RAC International Grand Prix, the first grand prix to be held in England since 1927. He drove a 4.5-liter, unsupercharged Talbot-Lago to 3rd place at the 1949 British Grand Prix at Silverstone. He was a lap behind the winner with a speed of .
Rosier won an International Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps in June 1949. He piloted a Talbot in the , 32-lap event, achieving a time of 3 hours, 15 minutes, and 17 seconds. He assumed the lead after 23 laps, coming across the finish line ahead of Luigi Villoresi.
Rosier won the 1950 24 Hours of Le Mans in a blue Talbot. He teamed up with his son Jean-Louis Rosier who only drove two laps during the race, which means Louis won the race practically by himself. He finished one lap ahead of Pierre Meyrat who drove a car of the same marque. The Rosiers covered 256 laps, , in 23:54:2.2. Rosier captured the Grand Prix d&#x27;Albi in Albi, France in May 1953. He drove a Ferrari, covering the 18 laps of the finals, , in 56:36:8. He averaged . Rosier placed second in a Ferrari at
a Grand Prix in Aix-Les-Bains, in July 1953. His time was 2:24:48.1. In April 1956 Rosier finished 4th in a Maserati, in a 201-mile race at Aintree. Stirling Moss drove a blue Maserati to victory in the 67-lap event for Formula One cars, with an average speed of . Rosier finished 5th at the 1956 German Grand Prix behind the wheel of a Maserati.

== Écurie Rosier ==

Louis Rosier was the owner and manager of a racing team, the &quot;Ecurie Rosier&quot;. Originally set up to run Rosier&#x27;s Talbot-Lago T26 (for either Rosier or a guest driver), and later evolved to an actual team running 250Fs and finally Ferrari 500s simultaneously for Rosier and another driver. Throughout the 1950s, Écurie Rosier provided drives in Formula One for Henri Louveau, Georges Grignard, Louis Chiron, Maurice Trintignant, André Simon and Robert Manzon.

== Circuit Louis Rosier ==
Louis Rosier was one of the key sponsors of the Charade race track. After World War II, Jean Auchatraire (president of the racing section of the local Automobile Club) and Louis Rosier promoted the idea of a race track around Clermont-Ferrand.

A set of preliminary designs were drawn up for a circuit of a length between 4 and 6 km, meeting the latest safety regulations with large parking capacity at a location just outside the city limits on a hilly landscape.

The Le Mans disaster (death toll: 84 lives) on 11 June 1955 brought the project to a halt. All race events were postponed. No further events were allowed to take place on temporary urban tracks. Racing events were only to be allowed on dedicated race-tracks, providing that they met a new set of rules. In Clermont-Ferrand, as was the case for many other new race tracks, new safety devices were being imagined and discussed, reviewed and assessed. But the concept of a &quot;mountain race track&quot; moved forward. It would be the only one of its kind in France.

Auchatraire, Rosier and Raymond Roche (the manager of Reims-Gueux race track) worked together to get the project accepted by the political community before searching for funding. But Rosier was killed at Montlhéry on 26 October 1956 and would not witness his project come to fruition. The racetrack was opened on 27 July 1958, with the name of its famous founder &quot;Circuit de Charade Louis Rosier&quot;. Soon after, several champions participated in racing events on the track, each of them, including Stirling Moss, making very positive statements about the track and its surrounding.

== Car manufacturer==

Rosier&#x27;s Renault dealership in Clermont-Ferrand was one of the largest Renault dealerships in France. Rosier&#x27;s dealership also sold other industrial and farming equipment. The building housing this important business has been destroyed.

In 1951, Louis Rosier designed a prototype based on the 4CV Renault.

In 1953, using the concept of a barchetta that he raced at Le Mans, Rosier, together with Italian coachbuilder Rocco Motto, designed a cabriolet, still using 4CV Renault sub assemblies. This model was built in a quantity of about 200 units by Brissonneau. It was even introduced at a car show in New York.

Some time later he designed a roadster using Renault Frégate elements with an aluminum body developed by Rocco Motto, on a multi-tubular frame. The engine was seriously revised, the body was lightened, the results was an interesting 950 kg for 80 hp.

==Death==
On 7 October 1956 Louis Rosier was competing in the Coupe du Salon sports car race at Montlhéry in a Ferrari 750 Monza. During the race he crashed, sustaining head injuries. Three weeks later, on 29 October 1956, Rosier succumbed to the injuries received in the crash.

<text>The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation 2-HAL to the electric multiple-unit passenger trains built during the late 1930s to work long-distance semi-fast services on the newly electrified lines from London Victoria to Maidstone and Gillingham (Kent). This type of unit survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated TOPS Class 402.

==Construction==
A development of the earlier 2-BIL units, the 2-HAL units (2-car Half Lavatory stock) were so-called because only one car in each unit had a lavatory. They were built in three batches:
The handful of post-war units were of completely different appearance, of all-steel construction, and looked very like the standard 4-SUB units being built at the same time, with flat ends, whereas the main 2-HAL units had the domed end appearance of the first 10 prototype &quot;Queen Mary&quot; 4-SUB units.

In the early 1960s the Eastern Division was fully changed over to EP-braked electric stock, and the 2-HAL units operating from Victoria to Maidstone/Gillingham etc. were removed to the Central and Western Divisions, being replaced by the large new build of 2-HAP units. The units then remained in service on these divisions until replaced at the end of their life by new 4-VEP units.

==Formations==
The original formations of these units are set out in the table below:
==Departmental service==
===De-icing units===
In 1967, three units were converted for de-icing the 3rd rail and were renumbered 001 - 003. These units operated from depots at Eastleigh and Bournemouth.

===Stores units===
In 1970, two units were converted for use transporting stores between depots. Renumbered 022 and 023 these units linked Eastleigh Works and other depots on the Southern Region and followed a set route on a weekly schedule. Unit 022 was allocated to Slade Green and served Stewarts Lane, Hither Green, Ashford, Ramsgate and Slade Green while Unit 023 was allocated to Brighton and served Wimbledon, Selhurst, New Cross Gate, Brighton and Fratton.

===2-PAN===
In 1971, six units were converted for use conveying parcels and newspaper traffic. They were renumbered 061-066 and designated 2-PAN (2-car Parcels and Newspapers stock), reusing the PAN code originally allocated to 6-PAN (Pantry) stock. Their life was not extended by long; within two years, all had been withdrawn.

==Withdrawal==
After withdrawal in 1971, various 2-HAL units in company with 2-BIL units were noted at Stratford in east London destined for scrapping by Kings of Norwich, or being hauled west for scrapping in the Newport area.

<text>Straubing (; Central Bavarian: &quot;Strauwing&quot;) is an independent city in Lower Bavaria, southern Germany. It is seat of the district of Straubing-Bogen. Annually in August the Gäubodenvolksfest, the second largest fair in Bavaria, is held.

The city is located on the Danube forming the centre of the Gäuboden.

==History==

The area of Straubing has been continuously settled since the Neolithic. The conquest by the Romans in 16–14 BC had a dramatic impact on the whole region. Even today many traces of the 400-year Roman occupation can be found: for example, the famous &#x27;Römerschatz&#x27; (Roman treasure) which was excavated in 1950 and which is shown in the Gäubodenmuseum. &quot;Sorviodurum&quot;, as the Romans called it, was an important military support base.

After the fall of the Roman Empire Straubing became a centre of settlement of the Bavarii, mostly around St. Peter&#x27;s Church (built in the 9th century) between Allachbach and Danube. According to the customs of the Bavarii the settlement was named after their leader &quot;Strupinga&quot;, which later evolved into the name Straubing.

In 1218 a new part of the city (called &#x27;new town&#x27;) was founded by Duke Ludwig I Wittelsbach of Bavaria. Straubing became the capital of the Duchy of Bavaria-Straubing under Duke Wilhelm I when Bavaria was divided among the sons of Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor in 1349. In 1429 Straubing passed to Ernest, Duke of Bavaria-Munich, who ordered the murder of Agnes Bernauer in Straubing. The grave of Agnes Bernauer cannot be found. But in the graveyard of St. Peter&#x27;s Church is a chapel built by Duke Ernest.

In 1633, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Swedish army successfully besieged the city.
Nowadays, this new town is the centre of Straubing with many shops, offices, restaurants and a pedestrian area. Most buildings there still have medieval style. The nightlife of Straubing, with many pubs and discothèques, is concentrated in this area.

The most important buildings are the Gothic cathedral-like Basilica of St. Jacob, the Romanesque St. Peter&#x27;s Church, the Carmelite monastery with its Baroque church and library, St. Vitus&#x27;s, where you can find a life-size personification of &quot;state and church&quot; joined in holy matrimony.

Between 1933 and 1945 most of the members of the then small Jewish community of Straubing were murdered or forced to emigrate.
In 2006, Straubing had a lively Jewish community with around 950 members.

During a rally in June 1940, when Straubing and Bogen held its Kriegskreistag, some 20,000 people gathered at the &quot;Großdeutschlandplatz&quot;. Among the speakers were Gauleiter Wächtler and &quot;Gauamtsleiter&quot; Erbersdobler. In July 1940, the &quot;Donau-Zeitung&quot; reported that the Straubing &quot;Kreisleiter&quot;, Anton Putz, had flown toward France and not returned.

In 1944 and 1945, Straubing suffered from several American air raids. The local military hospital was destroyed to the extent of 80 percent with a loss of 45 patients.

In November 2016 a fire destroyed a greater part of the medieval city hall.

Straubing has many industrial areas and a port at the river Danube with access to the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal, a connection from the North Sea to the Black Sea. It is the centre of the Bavarian high tech offensive in biotechnology.

<text>Luca Badoer (born 25 January 1971) is an Italian former racing driver. Badoer has raced for the Scuderia Italia, Minardi, Forti and, most recently, Ferrari teams. In addition to his racing duties, Badoer was one of the active test and reserve drivers for Ferrari from 1998 to 2010 and in 2009 stood in for Ferrari&#x27;s regular race driver Felipe Massa at the European Grand Prix and the Belgian Grand Prix after the Brazilian was injured during qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix and his original replacement, Michael Schumacher, pulled out due to injury.

, Badoer holds the record for the most Grand Prix starts (50) and the most race laps completed (2364) without scoring a point, although all of his races before his 2009 comeback came during a period when only the top six finishers scored points. Under the 2010 scoring system, he would have scored 26 points over his career. He nearly achieved a points finish in the 1999 European Grand Prix when a strong drive saw him reach fourth place, but the gearbox on his Minardi failed with 13 laps remaining.

==Early career==
Badoer was born in Montebelluna, Veneto, Italy. He raced karts in his youth starting in 1985 and scored two wins. In 1986, Badoer drove in the 100cc category to become the karting champion of Venice and became national champion the following year. He won the Italian championship in the 100cc international class in 1988.

===Formula Three and Formula 3000===
In 1989, Badoer moved to single-seater racing, joining the Trivellato team in the Italian Formula Three Championship driving a Dallara/Alfa Romeo. In 1990 he moved to the MRD Team. Driving a Ralt RT33 Alfa Romeo, he defeated Alex Zanardi and Roberto Colciago to win the final race of the 1990 season and finished 10th in the championship. In 1991 he moved to the Supercars team driving a Dallara 391 Alfa Romeo to win four races in succession, but was disqualified after a technicality concerning his tyres. Badoer finished 4th overall in the championship taking 33 points. In 1992 Badoer graduated to the Formula 3000 Championship, where he was selected to drive for Crypton Engineering. Badoer won four races, including a dominating display at Pergusa where he finished 21 seconds ahead of Emanuele Naspetti. While beating a field that included Rubens Barrichello and David Coulthard, Badoer became one of only four drivers to win the Formula 3000 title at the first attempt (the others being Stefano Modena in 1987, Christian Fittipaldi in 1991 and Jörg Müller in 1996). winning four races en route to the title.

==Formula One==

===1993===
Badoer had an offer of a long-term contract with Tyrrell to join the team, starting in the 1993 season. Badoer rejected this offer and signed with BMS Scuderia Italia instead.

Badoer&#x27;s debut in Formula One in was mired by BMS Scuderia Italia&#x27;s uncompetitive Lola chassis, which, despite Ferrari engines, was the slowest car in the championship in terms of qualifying pace. In South Africa, Badoer retired after 20 laps due to gearbox failure. In Brazil, Badoer qualified 21st and finished 12th after an incident forced him to pit for a new nose cone. At Donington, he fell victim to a new rule limiting qualifying to the fastest 24 cars (his time was only good enough for 26th). The round at Imola saw Badoer race as high as sixth, but finish seventh. This remained Badoer&#x27;s best result in Formula One. In Spain, he was unable to finish and at Monaco, Badoer finished the last of the runners. He managed to finish 15th in Canada. At Magny-Cours, Silverstone, Hockenheim and Budapest, Badoer failed to finish, twice to suspension failure. Going into Spa, the Lola team was gaining reliability and Badoer finished 13th. At his home race at Monza he was ahead of Christian Fittipaldi and battled for several laps before the Brazilian hit Badoer&#x27;s car and eventually finished 10th. At Estoril, Badoer finished 14th after starting last. After the race, Lola did not travel to the races in Japan and Australia after the team announced they were to merge with Minardi in 1994.

Benetton offered both Alboreto and Badoer tests in their cars to see who would partner Michael Schumacher for 1994 but eventually chose JJ Lehto and Alboreto went to Minardi to line up alongside Pierluigi Martini while Badoer became Minardi&#x27;s test driver.

===1995===

Badoer took over Alboreto&#x27;s seat after the latter retired. In the underfunded team using a Ford V8 after a deal with Mugen-Honda fell through, he started with a gearbox failure in Brazil with a good qualifying in Argentina. During the race, Badoer collided with the back of Mika Salo&#x27;s Tyrrell and hit Rubens Barichello&#x27;s Jordan later on bringing out the red flag. Badoer did not make the restart, having no spare chassis. His best results were eighth places in Canada and Hungary and ninth in Japan.

===1996===
In he switched to Forti Corse to be teammates with Andrea Montermini after Pedro Diniz left to join Ligier. During the season, he was only able to qualify for six of the ten races the team entered. In the 1996 Argentine Grand Prix Badoer was involved in a heavy collision with Diniz, whose Ligier struck him from behind and flipped his Forti upside down. He emerged from the collision unhurt but Argentine safety marshals were heavily criticised for failing to assist Badoer in a timely manner because they feared a fire would break out. At Imola, Badoer had a newer car and outqualified Montermini by more than a second. He finished 10th and the last of the runners. In Monaco, Badoer remained at the back and collided with Jacques Villeneuve at Mirabeau forcing both drivers to retire. He did not qualify in Spain but started 20th in Canada. In France, Badoer started ahead of Eddie Irvine after the Ferrari was relegated to the back. Forti Corse folded after that year&#x27;s British Grand Prix.

==FIA GT Championship==
In 1997 Badoer moved to the new FIA GT Championship, driving a Lotus Elise GT1 for GBF Engineering with co-driver Mimmo Schiattarella. Following retirements at Hockenheim and Silverstone, Badoer and Schiattarella finished 20th in Helsinki. The pair retired again at the Nurburgring and Zeltweg and finished 12th at Donington completing 151 laps. A race at Mugello saw Badoer retire with loose bodywork. While driving for GBF, Badoer was hired as Scuderia Ferrari&#x27;s test driver, a role he maintained until 2010.

==Return to Formula One==
===Minardi (1999)===
Badoer returned to Formula One racing in , again with the Minardi team. At Melbourne, Badoer raced as high as fifth at some point until gearbox problems forced him to retire with 15 laps to go. Prior to Brazil, he suffered a testing accident which left him with a broken hand. Stéphane Sarrazin took his seat for the race. He returned for Imola with his hand still causing problems but managed to finish eighth. He suffered from gearbox problems and a spin in Monaco and Spain. In July, Ferrari&#x27;s number one driver Michael Schumacher broke his leg in an accident at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. As Ferrari&#x27;s test driver, Badoer expected to be promoted to the race seat in Schumacher&#x27;s absence, but the team opted for Mika Salo instead, prompting criticism from former Ferrari driver Jean Alesi, who had himself turned the position down. His best chance to score points came at the chaotic 1999 European Grand Prix, only for gearbox failure to take him out 13 laps from the end when he was running in fourth position; teammate Marc Gené was promoted to sixth as a result (he would finish there to score the point widely believed to be the deciding factor in the 1999 Drivers&#x27; Championship, holding off Ferrari&#x27;s Eddie Irvine after McLaren&#x27;s Mika Häkkinen had passed him following a car failure that took Jacques Villeneuve out from fifth position). Badoer was so upset he broke down in tears after climbing out of the car.

Badoer overall started 48 races for backmarkers Scuderia Italia, Minardi and Forti Corse between 1993 and 1999.

===2000s: Ferrari test driver===


Unable to find a satisfactory race seat in Formula One after 1999, Badoer focused on his job as the permanent test driver for Ferrari, covering thousands of kilometres at the Mugello and Fiorano test circuits each year. He is credited with making a vital contribution to Ferrari&#x27;s first Formula One Drivers&#x27; Championship win for 21 years in 2000.

At the opening ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Badoer demonstrated one of the team&#x27;s 2005 cars in the centre of the stadium. After the pit crew assembled the car, Badoer revved the engine, and performed several doughnuts, creating a large cloud of tyre smoke and leaving circular black marks on the white platform.

===Ferrari (2009)===
On 11 August 2009, it was confirmed that Badoer would return to Formula One racing after almost 10 years, to replace the injured Felipe Massa at the 2009 European Grand Prix in Valencia. Massa was injured during the qualifying session for the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix when a piece of suspension fell from the rear of Rubens Barrichello&#x27;s Brawn GP car and struck Massa&#x27;s helmet, fracturing his skull, knocking him unconscious and causing him to crash into a tyre wall. Michael Schumacher was set to replace Massa, but a neck injury Schumacher sustained in a German superbike test earlier in the year forced him to pull out. The BBC reported that Badoer was given the job as a &quot;thank you for his commitment to the team&quot;. Badoer&#x27;s ten years-wait is a little shorter than the ten years and three months between Jan Lammers&#x27;s appearances at the 1982 Dutch Grand Prix and the 1992 Japanese Grand Prix.

In the first practice session for the 2009 European Grand Prix at the Valencia Street Circuit, where he had never driven before, Badoer came last and was three seconds off the pace of fastest man Rubens Barrichello and 2.5 seconds down on team mate Kimi Räikkönen. He was 1.3 seconds down on Räikkönen in second practice, and 1.9 seconds off in final practice. He qualified 20th and last for the race, with a time almost 1.5 seconds slower than Scuderia Toro Rosso driver Jaime Alguersuari, who was 19th. He was also caught speeding in the pit-lane four times during Friday practice. These offences earned him a reprimand and three separate fines totalling €5,400. Badoer explained: &quot;I am used to a 100kph limit in testing and so when I pressed the speed limiter button at the usual point in the pitlane, it did not give the car enough time to slow to the right speed.&quot;

A number of drivers defended Badoer&#x27;s performance. Lewis Hamilton said: &quot;I think he&#x27;s done a good job. He&#x27;s not put it in the wall. He&#x27;s kept it on the track. It&#x27;s an incredibly tall order to jump into the footsteps of Felipe Massa. He hasn&#x27;t even raced for ten years, so I think anyone who has taken that long out of the car is going to struggle, but instead I think he has done a good job just to keep it on the track and bit-by-bit he will catch up&quot;. Heikki Kovalainen stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what else you could have expected. Sometimes the tyres warm up, or they overheat or they don&#x27;t warm up, and it&#x27;s much more complicated than a few years ago where they brought out tyres that worked straightaway in different conditions. I think that knocks the driver&#x27;s confidence very easily – if the tyres are not working 100 percent you can&#x27;t push if you don&#x27;t feel you have the grip&quot;.

BBC commentator and former F1 driver Martin Brundle argued in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that the inclusion of Badoer and Romain Grosjean in the race was dangerous, since new rules that ban further testing until 1 January 2010 mean that they have been unable to gain the experience necessary to race. Badoer had never driven the Ferrari F60 before, having last tested the Ferrari F2008 at the Autódromo Internacional do Algarve in Portimão, Portugal in December 2008. Elsewhere, Brundle stated: &quot;It is surprising to some that Ferrari has not elected to use fellow tester Marc Gené who once stood in pretty successfully at Williams. The problem is that, with the testing ban for 2009, none of the test drivers are really up to speed. I personally would have tried a sharp and fit up-and-coming star of which there are many around&quot;. During his race commentary, Brundle suggested that Ferrari should use Massa&#x27;s absence to give a potential future star a drive.

In racing at Valencia, Badoer became the first Italian to drive for Ferrari in 15 years. 
Badoer made up six places at the start of the race and ran 14th on the first lap before he was hit from behind by Grosjean and spun. He eventually finished in 17th place out of 18 finishers, posting a fastest lap which was faster than both Toro Rossos. Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali indicated after the race that Badoer would keep the seat for the Belgian Grand Prix.

At the Belgian Grand Prix, Badoer again qualified last after a spin on his last lap of the first qualifying session. At the start of the race, Badoer avoided the accidents on the first lap and finished in 14th place, last of those drivers to finish the full race distance, despite setting the fastest sector one time of the race. Badoer was replaced by Force India driver Giancarlo Fisichella starting at the Italian Grand Prix, although over the five remaining races of the season he also failed to score any points. Badoer blamed the negative media coverage of his driving for Ferrari&#x27;s decision to replace him.

==Retirement==
At the end of 2010, Badoer retired from Ferrari as test driver and was replaced by Jules Bianchi. He ended his 12-year role at Ferrari with a demonstration of the Ferrari F60, the car Badoer raced in 2009 on a Ferrari-themed day at the Bologna Motor Show on 8 December 2010. He also took part in a forum for &quot;Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;, where he stated his only regret was that he &quot;was only able to do two races [for the Scuderia]&quot;. In January 2011, Badoer drove the Ferrari F60 with a special livery on the ice of the Madonna di Campiglio for his final act with the team.

==Personal life==
Badoer is married and has two children - Rocco and Brando. In 2017 Brando debuted in the WSK karting series, and in December 2023 Brando finished 6th in the Italian F4 Championship driving for Van Amersfoort Racing.
18 year old Brando has become a member of the McLaren Driver Development Programme.

<text>Luigi Musso (28 July 1924 – 6 July 1958) was an Italian racing driver, who competed in Formula One from to . Musso won the 1956 Argentine Grand Prix with Ferrari.

Born in Rome, Musso started his career in sportscar racing before progressing to Formula One in with Maserati at the . He returned in , finishing second at the to score his maiden podium finish. Musso raced full-time for Maserati in , repeating his podium feat at the . After three seasons at Maserati, he joined rivals Ferrari in . On debut for Ferrari, Musso won the alongside Juan Manuel Fangio, completing 30 of the 98 laps, but his season was curtailed after a sportscar crash at the Nürburgring. During his time at Ferrari, Musso entered into a fierce rivalry with British drivers Mike Hawthorn and Peter Collins. Multiple podiums followed in , as Musso beat both Hawthorn and Collins to third in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship, amongst winning the 1000km Buenos Aires in the World Sportscar Championship.

During the 1958 French Grand Prix at Reims, Musso died whilst chasing Hawthorn, when his Ferrari 246 went airborne and critically injured him. He achieved one win, one fastest lap and seven podiums in Formula One, as well as three non-championship race victories.

==Racing career==
Musso was born in Rome and began his racing career driving sports cars before making his début on the Formula One circuit on 17 January 1954, driving a Maserati. In 1954 he won the Coppa Acerbo, a non-championship Formula One race. At Zandvoort, in the 1955 Dutch Grand Prix, Musso placed third in a Maserati. At the end of the 1955 Formula 1 season he switched to Ferrari. He shared victory in the 1956 Argentine Grand Prix with Juan Manuel Fangio, however his season was cut short after a crash in a sports car race at Nürburgring.

Musso triumphed in a Ferrari 290 MM in the City of Buenos Aires sports car race on 20 January 1957. He was the third driver of the car. Stirling Moss finished second in a &#x27;light powered&#x27; Maserati 300S. Moss made a last-ditch effort for his team at the end but came up short. A second Ferrari 290 MM, driven by Eugenio Castellotti, came in third. The Ferrari team gained eight points toward the 1957 World Sports Car Championship in the event. The same year he won the Grand Prix de la Marne. Although the Marne was also not part of the Drivers&#x27; Championship, Musso nevertheless finished third in the overall standings for the season. With Olivier Gendebien he won the 1958 Targa Florio driving a Ferrari Testa Rossa. Later in the year he shared a 4-litre modified Formula One Ferrari 412 MI with Phil Hill and Mike Hawthorn in the 2nd Race of Two Worlds on the Monza banked oval. They finished 3rd overall in a car that gave way to the purpose-built American oval-track racing cars.

==Rivalry with Hawthorn and Collins==
Many years after Musso&#x27;s death, Fiamma Breschi, Musso&#x27;s girlfriend at the time of his death, revealed the nature of Musso&#x27;s rivalry with fellow team Ferrari drivers Mike Hawthorn and Peter Collins in a television documentary, &quot;The Secret Life of Enzo Ferrari&quot;. Breschi recalled that the antagonism between them encouraged all three to take more risks. She said: &quot;The Englishmen (Hawthorn and Collins) had an agreement. Whichever of them won, they would share the winnings equally. It was the two of them against Luigi, who was not part of the agreement. Strength comes in numbers, and they were united against him. This antagonism was actually favourable rather than damaging to Ferrari. The faster the drivers went, the more likely it was that a Ferrari would win.&quot; Breschi related that at the time of his death, Musso was in debt, and thus winning the French Grand Prix (traditionally the largest monetary prize of the season) was all-important to him.

Within a year, Collins and Hawthorn were also dead, and Breschi could not suppress a feeling of release. She said: &quot;I had hated them both, first because I was aware of certain facts that were not right, and also because when I came out of the hospital and went back to the hotel, I found them in the square outside the hotel, laughing and playing a game of football with an empty beer-can. So when they died, too, it was liberating for me. Otherwise I would have had unpleasant feelings towards them for ever. This way I could find a sense of peace.&quot;

==Death==
Musso was fatally injured during the 1958 French Grand Prix at Reims when his Ferrari hurtled off the course on the 10th lap of the 50 lap race. Running wide at the tricky &quot;Gueux Curve&quot; while chasing the leader, fellow Ferrari driver Mike Hawthorn, Musso&#x27;s Ferrari struck a ditch and somersaulted. Musso was airlifted to hospital with critical head injuries and died later that day. Hawthorn went on to win the race.

<text>Luigi Villoresi (16 May 1909 – 24 August 1997) was an Italian racing driver. He competed in Formula One at the time of its inception.

== Biography ==

Born in Milan, Lombardy, and nicknamed &quot;Gigi&quot;, Villoresi was the older brother of race car driver Emilio Villoresi, and co-piloted with him in several races at the beginning of their careers. From a prosperous family, Villoresi could afford to buy a car and began competing in local rallies at the age of twenty-two with a Lancia Lambda and a few years later acquired a Fiat Balilla with which he and his brother Emilio competed in the Mille Miglia. In 1935, he raced in the Coppa Ciano, finishing third and went on to capture the Italian driving championship in the 1100cc sports car class. The following year he and his brother purchased a Maserati which they drove individually in different races. Emilio was so successful that he was signed to drive an Alfa Romeo for Scuderia Ferrari in the 1937 season.

In 1938, Luigi Villoresi became part of the Maserati team, driving the 8CTF model that Maserati had designed to compete with the dominant German Silver Arrows. In 1939, Maserati introduced the Maserati 4CL which Villoresi drove to victory at the 1939 South African Grand Prix. Unfortunately, his brother Emilio died later that year while testing an Alfa Romeo 158/159 Alfetta factory racer at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza. A little over two weeks after his brother&#x27;s death, he drove his Maserati to victory at the 1939 Adriatic Grand Prix. His racing career was interrupted by the onset of World War II. At war&#x27;s end, he went to America to compete in the 1946 Indianapolis 500, and afterwards he then returned to race for Maserati until 1949 when he signed again with Ferrari debuting in Formula One on 21 May 1950.

== 1949 ==

Villoresi finished second in the 1949 Buenos Aires Grand Prix-President Juan Peron Grand Prix. Alberto Ascari was the winner with a time of 1 hour, 30 minutes, 23.9 seconds, for an average speed of . Villoresi won the first Grand Prix de Bruxelles, beating Alexander Orley of the United States. The winning time was over distance. Orley was six seconds behind. Louis Rosier was victorious in a blue Talbot, in a Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps, in June 1949. He took the lead following 23 laps and came across the finish line in front of Villoresi. Villoresi was third in a international race at Silverstone in September 1949. Italian drivers made a clean sweep of the first three positions with Ascari first and Giuseppe Farina second as 100,000 fans looked on. English driver St. John Horsfall died when his car crashed at a turn.

== 1950–1951 ==

Villoresi skidded on oil, penetrated a barrier, and killed three spectators at the Grand Prix des Nations race in Geneva (Switzerland). Nino Farina impacted Villoresi&#x27;s car at high speed but was uninjured. Villoresi broke his left leg and suffered head injuries which were treated at a hospital. The Grand Prix of 272 kilometres was won by Juan Manuel Fangio. The 1951 British Grand Prix was taken by José Froilán González of Argentina. Villoresi finished third, two laps behind the winner, with an average speed of . Villoresi completed 88 laps, 2 behind Gonzalez.

== 1952 ==

In July 1952 Villoresi won the French Grand Prix at Les Sables d&#x27;Olonne, driving a Ferrari. He captured the three-hour, race, with an average speed of . Ferrari achieved a 1,2,3 sweep at the Grand Prix d&#x27;France in La Baule, in August 1952. Alberto Ascari was first, followed by Villoresi and Rosier. Ascari had already clinched the Formula One World Championship before this event. Villoresi drove a Ferrari to win the 1952 Grand Prix of Modena in 1:5:21 over a distance of 100 laps, . His average speed was .

== 1953–1954 ==

Villoresi displayed his agility as a driver in the 1953 Italian Grand Prix at Monza. Giuseppe Farina made contact with the Maserati driven by Onofre Marimón as he was approaching the finish line. Villoresi made a brilliant manoeuvre while racing at The crowd came to its feet to witness his quick thinking in pulling his car off the track at great speed. Villoresi then finished third after winner Fangio and Farina, who was two seconds behind at the end. The race marked the first time a Ferrari did not win an event in races counting toward the Formula One World Championship. Fangio drove a Maserati to an average speed of over the grand prix.

Already 41 years old, Villoresi served as an elder statesman for the Formula One team, notably as Alberto Ascari&#x27;s mentor who became his closest friend. In 1954, he and Ascari joined the new Lancia racing team but Ascari&#x27;s death in the spring of the following year profoundly affected Villoresi and his career went into steep decline.

Villoresi was critically injured while testing a Lancia Aurelia near Rimini, Italy in April 1954. He was riding with his mechanic when he skidded while attempting to avoid a Fiat driving in the opposite direction. Both Villoresi and his mechanic were pinned beneath the Lancia. A group of farmers came to their aid, using oxen to lift the car. Both men remained conscious. Villoresi sustained a number of deep head wounds, facial lacerations, and bruises all over his body. He was listed in serious, but not critical condition.

== 1955–1958 ==

Villoresi was third after Ascari and Luigi Musso in the May 1955 Naples Grand Prix, a event. Villoresi was in a Lancia.

He wrecked his car in the 1956 Grand Prix of Rome, a 2-Litre sports car event.
The race was won by Jean Behra in a Maserati.

Villoresi was one of nine drivers, from a starting field of 303, in a January 1958 Monte Carlo auto rally, who completed the first leg of the rigorous touring car event, without incurring a penalty. The endurance event featured cars from eight different European starting locales. Of the starters, 72 entrants crossed the finish line but 13 were disqualified because of lateness. The 59 who remained from the opening round faced a , 22-hour portion, extending from Monte Carlo through the maritime Alps. Villoresi drove a Lancia.

Villoresi retired from Grand Prix racing in 1957 after 31 Formula One championship starts without a victory but made it to the podium eight times while scoring a total of 49 championship points. Villoresi continued rally racing and won the Acropolis Rally in Greece in 1958 before retiring to a home in Modena.

Villoresi died in 1997 at the age of 88.

<text>Salehurst is a village in the Rother district of East Sussex, England, within the civil parish of Salehurst and Robertsbridge. It lies immediately to the north-east of the larger village of Robertsbridge, on a minor road; it is approximately north of Hastings, just east of the A21 road.

In historical terms, Salehurst is much older than its neighbour; before the bridge over the River Rother was built, it already existed, and it is named in the Domesday Book of 1086. At the time, the river crossing was by ford or ferry, but in the 12th century, a newly established order of Cistercian monks constructed the bridge, and the two settlements of Robertsbridge and Northbridge Street came into being; eventually, since the main road now bypassed the village, they became much more important than Salehurst.

Salehurst lies approximately three miles from Bodiam, Sussex, the site of Bodiam Castle. One owner of Bodiam Castle was the Levett family, who lived at Salehurst during their &#x27;occupation&#x27; of the castle. In 1588, John Levett of Salehurst contributed to the Armada loan, and in 1607, his sons John and Thomas of Salehurst were regranted by the College of Arms their right to the Levett coat of arms issued to their Sussex ancestors.

John Colepeper, 1st Baron Colepeper (–1660), was an English peer, military officer, and politician who, as Chancellor of the Exchequer (1642–43) and Master of the Rolls (1643), was an influential counsellor of King Charles I during the English Civil War. His family came from Wigsell in the parish of Salehurst.

==St Mary the Virgin==
The parish church is dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin. It is reputed to be the largest rural parish church in East Sussex. Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner, (1854–1925) is buried in the churchyard. Rev. John Lord (1614–81) was rector from 1640 until his death; in 1937, his descendants donated to the church a portrait of him which had been owned by the family for generations.

<text>Luis Pérez-Sala Valls-Taberner (born 15 May 1959) is a Spanish retired racing driver who competed in Formula One, Formula 3, Formula 3000 and Touring Cars. He was also the team principal of HRT Formula 1 Team during the 2012 F1 season.

Pérez-Sala started his racing career in karting before graduating to racing production-based cars in the early 1980s, initially competing in Renault 5s before competing internationally in the Alfa Romeo Alfasud Sprint Cup in 1983. He competed in the 1984 FIA European Formula 3 Championship in a Ralt-Alfa Romeo, steadily improving across the season and taking a second place at Knutstorp and a fifth at Jarama to place tenth in the season standings. In 1985 he switched to the Italian Formula 3 Championship, finishing seventh overall and scoring a win. The following year he moved to Formula 3000 with great success, winning races at Birmingham and Enna in 1986 and finishing fourth in that year&#x27;s championship. He remained in F3000 for the following year, joining the factory Lola team, taking wins at Donington Park and the Le Mans Bugatti Circuit and finishing as runner-up to Stefano Modena in the championship. He became famous for his arguments with Alfonso de Vinuesa, caused by political views: the pair were involved in a spectacular crash in the F3000 race at Spa-Francorchamps in 1987.

The Minardi Formula One team signed Pérez-Sala for the season, alongside compatriot Adrián Campos - the first time two Spanish drivers had raced together as team-mates in F1. He made his debut for them on 3 April 1988, at the season&#x27;s opening race in Brazil, where he qualified 20th but failed to finish the race when his rear wing collapsed. Over the next five rounds, he continually outpaced Campos, who was replaced by Pierluigi Martini (Pérez-Sala&#x27;s F3000 team-mate in 1986) from round six of the Championship in Detroit.

Martini and Pérez-Sala were teammates in both 1988 and , with Martini outqualifying, outracing and outscoring Pérez-Sala. Pérez-Sala&#x27;s only point came from a sixth place in the 1989 British Grand Prix. This was the first F1 points score by a Spanish driver in thirty years, and the first race in Minardi&#x27;s history in which both of the team&#x27;s cars finished in the points. Along with the two points Martini scored for finishing fifth in the same race, the pair scored enough points to keep Minardi out of pre-qualifying for the rest of the season. At the end of the 1989 season, after failing to qualify for the season ending Australian Grand Prix (while Martini qualified a brilliant 3rd behind only the McLaren-Honda cars of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost), he left Formula One having started 26 of the 32 Grands Prix that he entered. After his retirement from Formula One, Pérez-Sala became a regular in the Spanish Touring Car Championship, winning the series in 1991 and 1993, before moving into sportscar and endurance racing. He and team-mate Manel Cerqueda won the GTB class title in the Spanish GT Championship in 2003 and 2004, and finished second overall in the championship in 2008 - his last season in competition before retiring.

Since 1990, Pérez-Sala has worked as a commentator and analyst for a number of media outlets, including RTVE, &quot;El País&quot; and TV3. In addition he is an instructor for racing drivers, and is involved in the &quot;Joves Pilots del Circuit de Catalunya&quot; programme, an initiative backed by the Generalitat de Catalunya, the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya and the motorsport authorities in Catalonia whose graduates include Jaime Alguersuari, Miguel Molina, Dani Clos, Albert Costa and Miki Monrás.

In July 2011, he was recruited as a consultant for the Hispania F1 team, which was founded by former Minardi teammate Campos. On 15 December 2011, it was announced that he would become team principal of HRT, replacing Colin Kolles.

His nephew, Daniel Juncadella, is also a racing driver, best known for winning the 2011 Macau Grand Prix Formula Three race, and has also competed in the Formula 3 Euro Series.
