<text>The Maryland Zoo — also known as The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore and formerly as The Baltimore City Zoo or the Baltimore Zoo — is a 135-acre park located in historic Druid Hill Park in the northwestern area of the City of Baltimore, Maryland, with the postal address of 1876 Mansion House Drive. Druid Hill was opened in 1876 as the first major park purchase by the City under Mayor Thomas Swann (1809-1883), (and later as 33rd Governor of Maryland, 1866-1869) and was later designed by famed nationally-known landscaper Frederick Law Olmsted (1822-1903).

Additional work on various park buildings was contributed by future Baltimore City Hall architect George A. Frederick (1842-1924), and Park Commissioner John H.B. Latrobe (son of earlier famed British-American architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe (1764-1820), who also was an accomplished lawyer, author, artist, amateur architect and civic leader. Olmsted had earlier won a contest for the design of plans for New York City&#x27;s famed Central Park in mid-town Manhattan in 1858, a year after it opened, and worked on the massive public works project during its construction from 1858 to 1873. The Maryland Zoo is now currently home to over 1,500 animals and is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).

==History==
The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore is generally considered to be the third oldest (or by some other circumstances, the second oldest) zoological park in the United States, having opened in 1876, sixteen years after the historic Park itself was purchased and opened to the city public. For a number of decades in the 20th century, it was operated and supervised by the Baltimore City Board of Park Commissioners, and organized in 1860 with the first major city park at Druid Hill and later the city Department of Parks and Recreation, through their subordinate Bureau of the Zoo. It was later assisted by the organization of a group of supportive friends, animal and wildlife lovers in the Baltimore City Zoological Society, which performed a saving function in the late 1960s when changing demographic and historical populations in the surrounding communities around Druid Hill Park resulted in increased crime and some harassment incidents to the animal population, resulting in a few deaths and maimings, resulted in a protective fence being erected around the zoo campus, and entrance ticketing center and gates which previously had been open to the surrounding Park.

In later decades, by 2004, a course of action between the City and the Society resulted in a semi-private and new independent operation arrangement with a separate board of trustees for the Zoo with increased private, state and suburban counties funding to supplement the restricting resources of the central City. This also resulted in a renaming of the old City Zoo as &quot;The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore.&quot;

From the 1950s to the 1970s, the City Zoo was made famous locally through the media-savvy and through the new medium of television with programs and promotions of Dr. Arthur Watson, the long-time zoo director. In 1980, when the famous iconic &quot;Harborplace&quot; festival marketplace pavilions at the Inner Harbor by developer James Rouse, opened by downtown Baltimore&#x27;s waterfront business district and its Patapsco River and Harbor, one of the stalls/stores was of stuffed and children&#x27;s play fiber animals called &quot;Dr. Watson&#x27;s Zoo,&quot; owned and operated by the now retired Dr. Watson.

In 2004, the zoo was struck by financial problems and was forced to reduce its collection size temporarily by closing parts of the zoo. The original Main Valley was closed due to its age, being incapable of holding animals comfortably with their older style of iron-barred cages and stone walls, and in addition, the Reptile House which is located some distance away from the main zoo in an adjacent section of the Park was closed. The reptiles, as well as gibbons, tigers, and snow leopards, were sent to other zoos and aquariums. By 2008, Baltimore&#x27;s Maryland Zoo was featured in &quot;America&#x27;s Best Zoos 2008.&quot;

On September 28, 2021, the zoo reopened the original Main Valley to guests as a walking path, providing the zoo&#x27;s history and several historic landmarks. &quot;While there are some bird species still residing in the Crane Barn, which has been updated throughout the years, there are no animals in the old exhibits and cages as they are hopelessly outdated and non-functional, Animals will not be returning to the obsolete cages, but we have launched a planning process to consider ways to accommodate the return of animals to Main Valley at some point in the future.” said Kirby Fowler (The Maryland Zoo&#x27;s President and CEO).

On August 23, 2022, the Zoo unveiled a ten-year master plan that aims to enhance the visitor experience and include new habitats for the animals.

==Exhibits==

The zoo has five main areas: Schaefer Plaza, Zoo Central, Maryland Wilderness, Northern Passage, and African Journey. Visitors enter the main ticketing gate of the zoo at Schaefer Plaza named in honor of former Baltimore Mayor and Maryland Governor William Donald Schaefer (1921-2011). The plaza features a gift shop, a playground area known as &quot;Celebration Hill&quot;, the zoo&#x27;s original lion statues, and the black-tailed prairie dog exhibit. Guests continue down the historic &quot;Main Valley&quot;, to access the exhibits. The enclosures in the Main Valley are currently empty. A passenger shuttle also connects visitors to Zoo Central free of charge. Zoo Central features a concessions area, carousel, and children&#x27;s train ride that traverses the north side of the African Journey exhibit.

The small-model diesel train makes a one-mile circuit and over a 105-foot bridge through parts and scenery of the Zoo, remembering the heritage of the old Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in the city and state, with its long-time decorated colors of blue and gray colors on the locomotive and cars of the old historic road, first railroad built in America since 1827. There has been a zoo train for many years, though the equipment and route has changed several times. The current zoo train from 2010 is pulled by a bright red new detailed scale replica of the 1863-era &quot;C. P. Huntington&quot; locomotive, named for a famous railroading tycoon and magnate in California and Virginia in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

===African Journey===
The largest area of the zoo, &quot;The African Journey&quot; displays a wide range of animals originating from the continent of Africa. The main exhibit areas are:
* African Aviary: features an enclosed walk-through aviary home to the blue-bellied roller, hadada ibis, African spoonbill, Von der Decken&#x27;s hornbill, hamerkop, fulvous whistling duck, spur-winged lapwing, Waldrapp ibis, Red-crested pochard, and Marbled duck.
* African Watering Hole: Features a watering hole environment with dama gazelle (Addra), lesser kudu, saddle-billed stork, white rhinoceros, plains zebra, and ostrich. The Caribbean flamingo, ground hornbill, sitatunga, Sulcata tortoise, leopard tortoise, leopard, Cheetah, and Cape porcupine are located around the watering hole area along the boardwalk.
* African Overlook: Features the lion exhibit area and giraffe viewing area. Warthog and blue duiker are located nearby.
* Chimpanzee Forest: Indoor and outdoor areas home to the chimpanzee, red-tailed guenon, Panamanian golden frogs, East African black mud turtle, and slender-snouted crocodile.
* Elephant Savannah: Large observation area for the African elephant. 
* Giraffe Crossing: home to the Giraffe House, feeding station, and okapi.
* Lemur Lane: An outdoor exhibit featuring the red ruffed lemur, ring-tailed lemur, colobus monkey, and Coquerel&#x27;s sifaka.

Renovations on the elephant exhibit facility began 2007. In March 2006, the Maryland Zoo announced it would be accepting three female African elephants from the Philadelphia Zoo in Pennsylvania as part of the expanded elephant exhibit, but construction was then indefinitely delayed and later the elephant loan was canceled. However, two new elephants came to the Maryland Zoo from Arkansas in 2007. On March 19, 2008, &quot;Felix,&quot; one of the Zoo&#x27;s female elephants, gave birth to a 290-pound male calf named &quot;Samson&quot;, the first elephant born in the Zoo&#x27;s history. In spring 2010, the Zoo&#x27;s warthogs had two male offspring, which were viewable beginning in May of that year. In February 2017, the first giraffe calf was born at the Zoo in over 20 years. Willow was born to parents Juma and Caesar, and was 6&#x27;1&quot;, and 125 lbs at birth.

In March 2018, the zoo announced plans to expand the zoo&#x27;s elephant, giraffe and lion exhibits. This $20 million project was made to improve living standards for the animals and also to give a much better viewing experience for guests of the zoo. The details of this initiative included the expansion of the Elephant habitat from 0.92 acres (0.37 ha) to 2.1 acres (0.85 ha), the expansion of the Giraffe habitat by 33%, the removal of what used to be &quot;Rock Island&quot; and several new viewing areas for the lions. The renovations finished in the summer of 2019.
 In July and December 2019, the Zoo welcomed two baby chimpanzees.

===Maryland Wilderness featuring The Children&#x27;s Zoo===

Displaying animals found in Maryland, visitors can watch otters swim over their heads, jump across lily pads, explore a cave, or climb into giant bird nests.

*&quot;The Bog&quot;: formerly featured the endangered bog turtle, now in the Meadow tunnel.
*&quot;Marsh Aviary and Lily Pads&quot;: surrounds a man-made stream featuring many species of ducks and other Maryland birds such as the turkey vulture, black-crowned night heron, and Sandhill crane.
*&quot;The Stream&quot;: includes habitats river otters and eastern hellbenders. One can visit a submerged archway, and watch as otters swim overhead. Nearby is a Bobcat exhibit, renovated from the former Red fox exhibit.
*&quot;The Cave&quot;: a beautifully sculpted life-size model of a cave, featuring more than a dozen small exhibits including Seba&#x27;s short-tailed bats, red-spotted newts, and others.
*&quot;Giant Tree and Slide&quot;: features many native reptiles and amphibians animals, mainly snakes. The slide is a fun way for kids to get back to the ground.
*&quot;Meadow&quot;: has animals such as Eastern box turtles, American toads, and a broadhead skink. Kids can poke their heads in large bubble-like windows coming out of the ground. It also features a tunnel that leads to terrariums inside.
*&quot;The Farmyard&quot;: features a variety of domestic breeds that can be touched; the highlight is a petting area of friendly African pygmy goats and Nigerian dwarf goats called &quot;Goat Corral&quot;, sponsored by Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital. Other animals included in the section include Cotswold sheep, Indian peafowl, Miniature Donkey, alpaca, trumpeter swan, Kunekune pigs, and Miniature Texas Longhorn.

The &quot;Maryland Wilderness&quot; featuring The Children&#x27;s Zoo is dedicated to donator and supporter, Lyn P. Meyerhoff (1927-1988), who was the wife of philanthropist Harvey Meyerhoff.

===Northern Passage===

The Northern Passage currently features grizzly bears, a North American porcupine, and a rescued bald eagle. It originally opened in 2003 as the Polar Bear Watch and formerly featured polar bears, arctic foxes, snowy owls, and common ravens. Guests can view the bears from underwater viewing areas, or from the windows of an actual massive Tundra Buggy, purchased from the Canadian company that creates these one of kind vehicles for viewing the polar bear in its natural habitat.

The exhibit was formerly home to Magnet the polar bear. Magnet was born in 1988 at the Toledo Zoo in Ohio and arrived at the zoo in 1991. He won the Beast in Show contest put forth by Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Zoo Tycoon&quot; for best zoo animal in December 2001. Magnet was available as a downloadable patch for the game and during the game, polar bears purchased via the Magnet icon would play with a red ball. The real Magnet was euthanized in April 2015 due to kidney disease. During his later years, he lived with two female polar bears, Alaska and Anoki, but did not produce any offspring.

Beginning in March 2017, the Polar Bear Watch became home to two rescued orphaned grizzly bear cubs. They are named Nova and Nita after their names were chosen in a public contest in April 2017. The polar and grizzly bears regularly rotated around each exhibit. As of November 2021, polar bears were removed from the exhibit and the name of the exhibit changed to the Northern Passage.

====Penguin Coast====

The Zoo’s state-of-the-art African penguin exhibit located between Northern Passage and African Journey opened on September 27, 2014. It brings guests up-close to nearly 60 (and growing) African black-footed penguins, white-breasted cormorants, and great white pelicans in a vivid re-creation of their natural habitat along the coasts and islands of South Africa. There is an underwater viewing window and view to a tidal pool that creates a wave-like effect for the birds.

The Zoo gives guests an extra peek into the lives of the penguins with the opportunity to see them get their daily fill of fish with morning and afternoon feedings.

Penguin Coast also includes an interpretive building which includes a multi-purpose room for education programs and animal demonstrations, restrooms, and indoor space for special events.

===Past animals===
*Snow leopard
*Gibbon
*Siberian tiger
*Hippopotamus
*Spider monkey

==Conservation==
The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore has been always active in many conservation programs, notably &quot;Polar Bears International,&quot; &quot;Project Golden Frog,&quot; and their work with African black-footed penguins. The zoo has the largest amount of African penguins in North America due in part to their active breeding program of the penguins. The zoo also helps rehabilitate local wildlife, especially birds of prey, such as bald eagles.
==In popular culture==
*The Maryland Zoo is the focus of &quot;The Big Zoo&quot; in Little Mammoth Media&#x27;s BIG Adventure Series, which was released in 1995. In the educational video, they talk how the zoo works for children including all the animals, the hospital, and what zookeepers do as well. The video also includes a special interview with then-zoo director Roger Birkel.

<text>The former Seneca Army Depot occupied between Seneca Lake and Cayuga Lake in Seneca County, New York. It was used as a munitions storage and disposal facility by the United States Army from 1941 until the 1990s. The property was transferred to the Seneca County Industrial Development Agency, which sold it.

Home to the world&#x27;s largest herd of white deer, the base is in the towns of Varick and Romulus. Adjacent to the storage facility is the now-closed Seneca Army Airfield, whose long runway could handle large cargo aircraft.

== History ==
During the 1940s, the Army stored radioactive materials in connection with the Manhattan Project in igloos E0801 through E0811, on the south end of the Depot. Despite no formal confirmation from the Department of Defense, it is known that during the cold war the depot held the largest stockpile of Army nuclear weapons in the country. The Army RADCON team performed a survey on these igloos during the week of May 13, 1985.

In 1978 the United States Coast Guard opened a Loran-C transmitter station on the base. It closed in 2010, made obsolete by GPS.

The depot was a major employer in the region. It was linked to the outside world by the airfield, railroad lines and highways (NY-96 and NY-96A).
The depot was not included in any of the 1990s Base Realignment and Closure plans. After the 1995 base recommendations, the Army announced that the base would close. The Seneca County Industrial Development Agency filed suit in federal court. The lawsuit ended when the Army agreed to provide the same benefits to the community as were available to those in the formal closure process. The depot formally shut down on September 30, 2000.

In August 2002, The Glen Region of the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) began using the airfield for autocross racing competitions, but site availability after August 2011 is not yet determined.

In early 2007, the Cornell 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge Team began using the depot&#x27;s private roads to test its autonomous vehicles. Some warehouses are leased to The Advantage Group, which runs a storage and shipping business. Much of the housing at the depot has been sold to private developers and is now available as part of the area&#x27;s civilian housing stock. Much of the railroad track and outer yards are being used for railroad car storage. As of 2008, no customers ship by rail. The depot&#x27;s former airfield is slated for use as a New York State Police training center. In early 2007, Cilion announced plans to build an ethanol plant on a portion of the former depot, but the project languished and appears to have died in the face of rising costs for corn and public concern about the wisdom of the project. An article dated July 20, 2009 in the Watertown Daily Times stated that the Fort Drum-based 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) would soon start using the depot for combat training.

A portion of the southern end of the base was transferred to New York State and used for the construction of Five Points Correctional Facility, a maximum security prison. Land also was transferred to Seneca County for the construction of a county jail and sheriff&#x27;s office.

== Demonstrations against nuclear weapons storage ==
Beginning on July 4, 1983, and running for several years, antiwar and anti-nuclear activists mounted major protests at the facility, staging civil disobedience protests and establishing the Seneca Women&#x27;s Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice. Major events in 1983 took place in August and October. During the October event, many people including Dr. Benjamin Spock climbed the fence surrounding the depot and were detained. Most fence climbers were released after being given &quot;ban and bar letters&quot; telling them they would be charged with trespass if they were apprehended inside the depot again.

Demonstrations continued for several years, mostly originating from within the Women&#x27;s Peace Encampment for a Future of Peace and Justice, which operated from an old farmhouse on Route 96 in Romulus.

== Current disposition of the depot land ==
The Seneca County Industrial Development Agency marketed the land to manufacturers or other industry.

Much of the land is dotted with large, concrete munitions storage bunkers known as &#x27;igloos&#x27;. Development started on the depot&#x27;s northeastern section, but much of it is non-taxable. the depot is home to a maximum-security state prison, the Five Points Correctional Facility and the Seneca County Law Enforcement Center, which includes the county jail. The non-profit, Hillside Family of Agencies that is headquartered in Rochester, NY closed in the fall of 2019. There are a few private businesses including First Light, which uses some of the ammunition bunkers.

== The White Deer herd ==
The white deer, long the symbol for the depot, began appearing after the fence was erected in 1941. A handful of White-tailed deer that carried a recessive gene for all-white coats were isolated within the depot. The depot initially allowed only brown-coated deer to be killed, so the herd of white deer grew to more than 200, although hunters are occasionally allowed inside to kill a white deer. 

The white deer are naturally occurring, not albinos, and have not pink, but brown eyes. The white deer live alongside another 600 brown white-tailed deer. Seneca White Deer, a non-profit group, received clearance to run limited bus tours in 2006, 2009, and 2012. These tours &quot;turned out to be hugely successful&quot;.

In 2016, the property was sold to local businessman Earl Martin of Seneca Iron Works for $900,000 and established as Deer Haven Park, LLC. An agreement was later made between Martin and Dennis Money, founder of Seneca White Deer, Inc., to lease part of the land and operate it as a conservation park for the white deer, although White Deer later shut down, citing financial problems.
On June 27, 2020 self-guided auto tours with the option to download an auto tour app were made available.

<text>The Queens Zoo (formerly the Flushing Meadows Zoo and Queens Wildlife Center) is an zoo at Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens, New York City, between Grand Central Parkway and 111th Street. The zoo is managed by the Wildlife Conservation Society and is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Built along with the Queens Zoo is a children&#x27;s zoo, which was originally called the Heckscher Children&#x27;s Farm.

New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses had wanted to add a zoo to Flushing Meadows–Corona Park after the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Plans for the zoo were first announced in 1964 as part of the Queens Botanical Garden, but construction for the zoo did not begin until August 20, 1966. The Heckscher Children&#x27;s Farm, the first part of the new zoo, opened on February 28, 1968, and the rest of the Flushing Meadows Zoo opened on October 26, 1968. The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation contracted Wildlife Conservation Society to operate the zoo in 1988. The zoo was closed for renovations for four years, reopening in 1992; it added numerous animals and exhibits after it reopened. The Queens Zoo was nearly shuttered in 2003 due to budget cuts.

The zoo is home to more than 75 species that are native to the Americas. Unlike contemporary zoos, the Queens Zoo did not put animals in cages except when necessary; since the zoo&#x27;s habitats are open-air, it focuses mostly on animals native to the Americas. The main zoo (now the zoo&#x27;s wild side), on the eastern portion of the site, contains landscape features such as a marsh and artificially warmed rocks. The domestic side of the zoo, originally the Heckscher Children&#x27;s Farm, includes domesticated animals. The zoo&#x27;s aviary is a geodesic dome designed by Thomas C. Howard of Synergetics, Inc. and used during the 1964 fair.

== History ==
The zoo is part of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in the New York City borough of Queens. The park&#x27;s site was part of the 1939–1940 New York World&#x27;s Fair grounds, and the land saw little development during the next quarter-century. The site of the zoo was part of the Transportation Zone during the 1964–1965 New York World&#x27;s Fair, when the Chrysler Pavilion and Lowenbrau beer garden occupied the zoo&#x27;s site. By the 1960s, Queens was the only New York City borough without a zoo. Even before the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair opened, New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses had wanted to add a zoo to Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. The zoo was part of Moses&#x27;s plans for a system of parks in Queens.

=== Planning ===
Moses announced plans for the Queens Zoo in February 1964, when he indicated that it would be built as part of an expansion of the Queens Botanical Garden, on the eastern side of Flushing Meadows. In contrast to existing zoos where animals were kept in cages, the zoo was to have an open-air layout where animals could roam. The zoo would have covered either or . That March, Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. requested that the New York City Council revise the City Administrative Code to permit the zoo&#x27;s construction, and New York state legislators introduced bills to allow the Queens Botanical Garden Society to operate the zoo. The City Council signaled its support for the state legislation, but plans for the zoo were stymied because of opposition to Moses&#x27;s plans for Flushing Meadows. The zoo was supposed to have been funded using profits from the 1964 fair, but the exposition proved highly unprofitable.

Before the fair closed, there was talk of converting the fair&#x27;s geodesic dome into an aviary for the proposed zoo. Moses&#x27;s successor, Newbold Morris, announced plans in October 1965 to spend $1.5 million on the Queens Zoo. Morris recommended that the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA) fund the restoration of the nearby New York City Pavilion, allowing the city government to divert funds for the City Pavilion&#x27;s restoration to the zoo&#x27;s construction. Ultimately, the TBTA agreed to provide $1.2 million for the zoo in February 1966, which was later increased to $1.92 million. This funding was made possible by a provision that allowed the TBTA to spend money on parks along certain highways. The zoo was planned to cover , and the Heckscher Foundation for Children agreed to donate $120,000 for a children&#x27;s zoo within the Queens Zoo. Preliminary plans were being drawn up by early 1966. By that July, the city government was planning to construct the zoo on the site of the fair&#x27;s former transportation area, west of the Grand Central Parkway, rather than next to the Queens Botanical Garden.

Moses attended the zoo&#x27;s groundbreaking ceremony on August 20, 1966, and the children&#x27;s zoo partially opened that September. Later that year, the TBTA announced more detailed plans for the zoo, which included a concession building and an aviary within the fair&#x27;s geodesic dome. The agency also planned to award a $2 million contract for the zoo&#x27;s operation. The TBTA awarded $2.82 million in construction contracts for the final sections of the zoo in June 1967, and the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) took over the land the same month. At that point, the children&#x27;s zoo was planned to be completed in late 1967, followed by the rest of the zoo early the next year. Ultimately, the zoo cost $3.5 million to construct.

=== City operation ===

==== Opening and early years ====

The first animals began moving into the Heckscher Children&#x27;s Farm in February 1968, and Moses dedicated the children&#x27;s farm on February 28 of that year. Moses opened the rest of the Flushing Meadows Zoo on October 26, 1968. The children&#x27;s farm was initially free to enter, as was the rest of the zoo. The zoo also had pony rides and a carousel, for which an additional fee was charged. Tatiana Gillette-Infante, a former debutante, was hired as the Flushing Meadows Zoo&#x27;s first supervisor. Soon after the zoo opened, there were reports of people cutting fences, abusing the zoo&#x27;s birds, and stealing animals from the children&#x27;s farm for joyrides. In addition, the zoo frequently experienced blackouts, as the park&#x27;s underground electrical ducts ran through marshland. The zoo recorded 100 blackouts in its first three years, some of which had lasted as long as five days. These issues prompted Gillette-Infante to request that the city hire more zookeepers.

By the early 1970s, Gillette-Infante alleged that the city government was neglecting the zoo. She temporarily closed the aviary in October 1970 due to staffing shortages, and she closed the entire zoo the following June for similar reasons. Gillette-Infante also wanted the city government to upgrade the zoo&#x27;s electrical system, and NYC Parks added a secondary power supply to the zoo in 1970. The aviary temporarily closed in May 1971 because visitors frequently attacked the birds and because the aviary&#x27;s paths kept collapsing. Due to a lack of city funding, City Council member Thomas Manton warned in 1971 that the zoo might have to scale back its activities or even close altogether. The city government began regularly checking up on the zoo&#x27;s animals in 1972, and Gillette-Infante wanted the city to add an animal clinic and a quarantine facility for newly arrived animals. As part of a planned United States Bicentennial celebration at Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, there were proposals to renovate the zoo.

==== Mid- and late 1970s ====
The Flushing Meadows Zoo continued to experience maintenance, funding, and staffing issues during the mid-1970s, and electricity was still inconsistent. The lack of money and staff forced the zoo to postpone a planned renovation of the aviary in early 1973. There were discussions about reopening the zoo&#x27;s aviary in mid-1973, though the aviary remained closed over the following months. The zoo&#x27;s insect house was also shuttered. Security at the zoo was increased in 1974 following several incidents at the Prospect Park and Central Park zoos. Additional policemen were stationed in the surrounding area, and the zoo began employing curatorial staff 24 hours a day. Shirley Weinstein of the Mid-Queens Community Council alleged that the zoo was being neglected; at the time, the zoo had over 100 animals. Gillette-Infante recalled that local residents often left unwanted pets there in the 1970s.

NYC Parks commissioned the naturalist Roger A. Caras in 1974 to study conditions in the city&#x27;s three municipal zoos at Flushing Meadows, Central Park, and Prospect Park. Though Caras found fewer problems at the Flushing Meadows Zoo than the two other zoos, he recommended that all three zoos be taken over by the New York Zoological Society. City parks commissioner Edwin L. Weisl also supported the takeover, and he preferred that the zoos be closed if the Zoological Society could not take over operations. By the beginning of 1975, the city was negotiating to transfer operation of the zoos to the Zoological Society. Protestors wanted the zoos to be closed entirely, and the Society for Animal Rights sued in April 1975 to compel the city to close the three municipal zoos. The city government also sold off some of the zoos&#x27; animals, citing overcrowding. A state-government report questioned whether the city government, which was in the midst of a major fiscal crisis, should be using its limited funds to maintain the Flushing Meadows Zoo and the city&#x27;s other small zoos. The aviary remained closed during the late 1970s, and the zoo&#x27;s last seals died in 1976.

The zoo&#x27;s opponents continued to advocate for its closure. Tony Carding of the World Federation for the Protection of Animals wrote that, while the zoo was &quot;a more humane and potentially educational attempt at exposing captive wild animals to public view&quot;, the site had high amounts of noise pollution. A groundhog pen was added to the zoo in 1978. The same year, U.S. Congressman Benjamin Rosenthal proposed adding the surrounding park to the Gateway National Recreation Area, allowing the National Park Service to take over the zoo&#x27;s operation, but this legislation was not successful. By the following year, the zoo had only five exhibits, and it suffered from a lack of funds and staff. The seal pool was completely empty, and the zoo as a whole did not have many North American animals. Further contributing to its unpopularity, the Flushing Meadows Zoo closed at 4 p.m. each day, and the city government was not planning any major renovations.

=== WCS operation ===

==== 1980s takeover agreement ====
By 1980, the city government was again negotiating to hand over control of the three municipal zoos to the New York Zoological Society. The society had wanted to take over only the Central Park Zoo, but the city government insisted that the group also take control of the two other zoos. Mayor Ed Koch and the New York Zoological Society signed a fifty-year agreement in April 1980, wherein the Central Park, Prospect Park, and Flushing Meadows zoos would be administered by the Society. As part of the takeover, the Society planned to implement an admission fee, and it would spend $4.5 million renovating the zoo and adding animals. Queens borough president Donald Manes requested that the city provide $2 million for the zoo&#x27;s renovation in its budget for fiscal year 1981. Negotiations continued for another year and a half, and the New York City Council and Board of Estimate had to approve the admission fees as well. The zoo received four sea lions in 1981, and it also received a lion cub despite having no lion enclosure.

The Zoological Society signed an agreement in October 1981 to manage and renovate the zoos. Although the Board of Estimate approved the agreement that month, the society was not scheduled to take over the zoo immediately. As part of the agreement, the three municipal zoos were to be renovated. The Flushing Meadows Zoo was originally planned to be renovated between 1984 and 1985 for $5 million, though designs for the renovation were incomplete at the end of 1981. The zoo launched a program the next year, in which it showed exotic animals to children across Queens. NYC Parks began promoting the zoo in 1985 after finding that many Queens residents did not know about its existence. The same year, NYC Parks formed the Friends of the Queens Zoo group to oversee improvements at the zoo. By then, the zoo had 200 animals. Following a mauling at the Prospect Park Zoo, signs and fences were installed around the bear enclosure, and security at the zoo was increased. In addition, the zoo still experienced power shortages, and a U.S. federal inspector raised concerns that the zoo&#x27;s clinic lacked consistent electricity. The aviary also reopened .

==== Renovation and 1990s ====
The Zoological Society began drawing up plans for the zoo in 1986; the renovation was part of a larger project to refurbish Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. The Flushing Meadows Zoo was in better condition compared with the Central Park and Prospect Park zoos, so it needed fewer renovations. The Board of Estimate gave NYC Parks permission to hire a construction contractor for the zoo in April 1987, and Lehrer, McGovern &amp; Bovis were hired to rebuild the zoo. The city government announced in July 1987 that the zoo would close for renovations, and it began moving animals out of the zoo. At the time, the zoo&#x27;s renovation was scheduled to take two or three years. The Zoological Society sought to continue hosting North American species there. The Flushing Meadows Zoo was supposed to have closed in late 1987, but its closure was delayed while the animals were relocated. The zoo&#x27;s 30 employees were reassigned to other parks in New York City. The animals were sent to various sites in the northeast U.S. Some chickens remained behind, and the operator of the neighboring Flushing Meadows Carousel fed the chickens for the next several years.

The Flushing Meadows Zoo was temporarily closed for renovations on August 8, 1988, and workers began razing the existing structures. The project included new exhibits, a refurbished petting zoo, and rebuilt pathways, in addition to landscaping changes. The old walls and fences were replaced or concealed, and greenery and rocks were added. At the end of 1989, city officials allocated $550,000 for new equipment at the zoo. The renovation ultimately was finished in 1991, but the zoo remained closed because of a lack of funding from the city government. Weeds started to grow in the zoo due to a lack of maintenance, and the Zoological Society hired security guards to patrol the site. Additionally, because all of the animals had been sold off, the Zoological Society had to get new animals. Mayor David Dinkins ultimately agreed to provide funding for the zoo after Queens borough president Claire Shulman threatened to prevent the nearby USTA National Tennis Center from being expanded. The zoo&#x27;s annual operating costs at the time were about $1–2 million. In total, the project had cost $16 million or $17 million.

The zoo reopened on June 25, 1992; it was renamed the Queens Zoo, and it began charging an admission fee. The city planned to expand a parking area near the zoo as well, and new entrances to Flushing Meadows–Corona Park from 111th Street were built to provide more direct access to the zoo. Even after the renovation and renaming, the Queens Zoo struggled to attract guests. The Zoological Society was renamed the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in 1993, and the zoo was rebranded as the Queens Wildlife Center, though it continued to be known as the Queens Zoo. People frequently dumped unwanted animals at the zoo after it reopened, particularly during Easter, prompting objections from WCS officials. The zoo had 400 animals by the mid-1990s, and it recorded around 180,000 annual visitors during that decade. A Chinese alligator exhibit was added in 1997. Even after the renovation, few people knew about the Queens Zoo, especially because visitors tended to frequent the better-known Bronx and Central Park zoos.

==== 2000s to present ====

The WCS requested $950,000 from the city government for a parrot habitat in 2000, and it requested $4.2 million from Queens borough president Claire Shulman the next year for a jaguar exhibit. Shulman ultimately provided $4.3 million from both projects. By then, the WCS had added several species to the zoo and was adding more birds to the aviary. The zoo saw 200,000 annual visitors, and the WCS was hiring multilingual volunteers and printing brochures in multiple languages to attract more visitors. The zoo was officially renamed the Queens Zoo in May 2001 after the WCS found that visitors were confused about the &quot;Wildlife Center&quot; name. The same year, the barn on the domestic side was expanded. Following the September 11 attacks later that year, the zoo recorded increased attendance, in part because local residents were no longer traveling far. When the zoo celebrated the tenth anniversary of its reopening in 2002, the WCS was about to begin constructing the parrot and jaguar habitats.

In 2003, Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed eliminating funding for the Prospect Park and Queens zoos to fill a citywide budget gap, effectively forcing the WCS to close the zoos. The changes would have resulted in a total savings of around $5.6 million or $5.8 million. At the time, the Queens Zoo received $3.5 million per year, and closing the zoo would have cost $4 million; only about 10% of the zoo&#x27;s operating costs were funded by the WCS itself. The WCS would have needed to relocate 400 animals from the zoo if it were closed. In response to the announcement, local residents signed petitions opposing the budget cuts; one such petition garnered more than 100,000 signatures. There were discussions about restoring the funds in exchange for raising admission fees and introducing private sponsorships at the zoos, and the WCS also contemplated renting out the zoos for private events. That June, the city government ultimately agreed to restore $4.8 million for the Prospect Park and Queens zoos, though the WCS had to fire staff, discontinue programs, and double admission fees. Funding for the zoo was accidentally removed from the city&#x27;s budget in 2004, though it was quickly restored.

A parrot exhibit opened at the zoo in July 2004, and the prairie dog habitat was replaced two years later with a habitat for southern pudu. The WCS also renovated the zoo&#x27;s aviary in 2006 with $640,000 from the office of borough president Helen M. Marshall. Though the Queens Zoo had initially focused on keeping North American animals, the zoo also included many South American animals as well by the late 2000s. This helped attract more visitors, particularly South American immigrants who lived nearby. Robin Dalton, who had served as the zoo&#x27;s director since it reopened, retired in 2006. The zoo&#x27;s logtime curator, Scott Silver, became its director following a two-year search. After Silver was promoted, he sought to increase visitation by completing the jaguar habitat and adding a children&#x27;s playground. At the time, the zoo attracted about 200,000 annual visitors, most of who came from the surrounding neighborhood. In addition, three interactive exhibits were added to the Queens Zoo in 2008.

The zoo had still not constructed the jaguar habitat in 2010 due to a lack of funds. A Wi-Fi network was added to the zoo in 2012 as part of a program to improve Wi-Fi access across New York City parks. In addition, borough president Melinda Katz provided $480,000 for renovations to the aviary and the overpass over the zoo&#x27;s marsh. In March 2020, the Queens Zoo and the WCS&#x27;s other facilities were shuttered indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. The zoo reopened that July; visitors were initially required to reserve timed tickets, and the zoo&#x27;s paths were temporarily converted to one-way paths to allow social distancing.

== Description ==

The Queens Zoo is located at 5351 111th Street within Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens, New York City, near 53rd Avenue and west of Grand Central Parkway. It operates year-round. The Queens Zoo has been operated by the Wildlife Conservation Society since its reopening in 1992, and it is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.

The zoo is divided into a wild side, where animals roam around in landscaped exhibits, and a domestic side, where visitors could interact with domesticated animals. One of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park&#x27;s paths separates the two sides. There is a walk-through aviary within the wild side of the zoo. To the north of the zoo is the New York Hall of Science museum, while to the west is the Terrace on the Park banquet hall. Near the zoo&#x27;s entrance are two fountains, known as the Fountain of the Planet of the Apes and the Fountain of the Grapes of Wrath. The Flushing Meadows Carousel is next to the domestic side of the zoo (originally the children&#x27;s farm).

=== Wild side ===
The main zoo (now the zoo&#x27;s wild side) is located on the eastern portion of the site. The wild side originally covered ; following the 1990s renovation, the wild side covered an oval-shaped plot of about . There were originally pools and ponds throughout the zoo, including a seal pool measuring . In contrast to other zoos, the Queens Zoo did not put animals in cages except when necessary. Animals stayed outdoors, and dry moats and low fences surrounded each animal&#x27;s enclosure. Most animals&#x27; enclosures were designed to resemble their natural habitats. High chain-link fences were used for the former wolf enclosure, which also had a moat surrounding it. Another fence surrounded the entirety of the zoo. The main entrance has a decorative gate by Albino Manca and Clarke &amp; Rapuano, known as &quot;Gates of Life&quot;.

Following the 1990s renovation, the main pond was enlarged, and a marsh was added. The wolves were removed, and new exhibits were added for bears, bison, bobcats, coyotes, mountain lions, prairie dogs, Roosevelt elk, sandhill cranes, and water birds. The habitats include hidden landscape features, such as artificially warmed rocks in the mountain-lion exhibit, as well as tree stumps with sprinklers in the bison range. Vegetation was placed over the fences to hide them, and hills were added to several habitats to allow visitors to more easily see the animals. To mimic the conditions found in the wild, zookeepers hide food in landscape features such as tree trunks and logs. A sea lion pool and a sea lion store occupy the center of the wild side&#x27;s eastern end, and there is an administration building at the southern end.

Informational signs are placed throughout the zoo. The modern zoo also includes a winding pathway around the perimeter of the oval path. Observation platforms lead off the pathway into several habitats. In addition, there is a &quot;graveyard&quot; with information about extinct species.

==== Aviary ====
The zoo&#x27;s aviary is at the northeast corner of the wild side. It consists of a geodesic dome designed by Thomas C. Howard for the 1964 fair, based on a concept by Buckminster Fuller. The dome was originally located on what is now the site of the Buzz Vollmer Playground in the northern section of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. The dome is wide and was one of the largest single-layer structures of its time. For the fair&#x27;s 1964 season, it was used as a multipurpose event facility with 2,100 seats. The following year, the dome became a memorial to former British prime minister Winston Churchill, with numerous artifacts from Churchill&#x27;s life. The memorial was sponsored by the nonprofit organization People to People. The dome was dismantled and stored after the fair; it was later reassembled in the zoo with a mesh netting instead of a solid tent.

Prior to the fair&#x27;s 1965 season, there had been discussions about using the dome as an aviary after the fair. When the dome was reinstalled in the zoo, landscape architects Gilmore David Clarke and Michael Rapuano redesigned its interior as an aviary, while Andrews &amp; Clark were hired as the engineers. Rocks, bushes, and trees were added inside. The aviary also had an asphalt walkway, as well as a , spiral bridge. Birds were allowed to fly throughout the aviary, as there were no cages. In the 1970s, the aviary&#x27;s birds were recorded as including guinea hens, mynas, peacocks, Chinese pheasants, and quail. After the zoo reopened in 1992, the aviary included a walkway winding upward to the height of the trees. The modern interior includes native plantings such as white pine trees, and the trees are constantly pruned so visitors could see the birds there. The dome is covered with netting to prevent the birds from escaping. By 2006, the aviary had 90 birds from 20 species.

=== Domestic side ===
The western side of the zoo is dedicated to domestic animals. Built as a children&#x27;s zoo called the Heckscher Children&#x27;s Farm, it was designed in the style of an American homestead. When the Queens Zoo was being developed, the children&#x27;s farm was supposed to contain amusement rides. At the time of its opening, the children&#x27;s zoo included pigs, cows, sheep, donkeys, ponies, rabbits, and ducks, most of whom had been raised at the Central Park Zoo. There was a one-story structure that exhibited live insects; at the time of its completion, the insect house was the only one in the New York City area. The children&#x27;s farm included a concession stand shaped like a farmhouse, and a dairy house was added in the 1990s. By the 2000s, the domestic side of the zoo had a barn with educational programs.

=== Events and activities ===
The zoo has hosted various events over the years. For example, it has hosted the annual Bison Bonanza, with bison-themed children&#x27;s activities such as face painting and storytelling. The zoo has also presented children&#x27;s activities during events such as the Fall Fun festival, International Migratory Bird Day, Winter Breakout, Natural History Happening, and the International Harvest Festival. There have been other events such as annual sheep-shearing weekends and winter camps for children. During the 1990s, the Queens Zoo also hosted Groundhog Day ceremonies, in which people looked at the shadows of the zoo&#x27;s prairie dogs to forecast an early spring; the practice ended in 2006 when the prairie dogs were relocated.
In addition, the zoo hosts classes, and high-school students help operate the zoo&#x27;s education and animal-care programs. These programs are provided in several languages.

== Animals ==
The zoo is home to as many as 112 species as of 2013, which are native to both North and South America. Initially, the zoo only housed animals that were native to North America. According to park commissioner August Heckscher, the zoo could keep only North American animals because it operated throughout the year and because all the exhibits were outdoors. The animals at the zoo also do not migrate south during the winter. The zoo&#x27;s menagerie still focused on North American species after its 1990s renovation, but it has since expanded to include other species such as South American spectacled bears and American alligators. There is a small clinic for injured and sick animals; the clinic at the Bronx Zoo handles more serious injuries or illnesses. As part of a WCS program, almost all of the zoo&#x27;s animals undergo animal enrichment training.

Originally, the zoo&#x27;s animals included bears, wolves, bison, raccoons, otters, and waterfowl. After the zoo&#x27;s 1990s renovation, it had 250 animals from 40 species, and species such as cougars, Roosevelt elk, and prairie dogs were added for the first time. The zoo&#x27;s menagerie had grown to 400 animals by 2001. The zoo is home to Andean bears, pumas, California sea lions, coyotes, burrowing owls, Canadian lynxes, Southern pudus, thick-billed parrots, American alligators, American bison, trumpeter swans, bald eagles, great horned owls, snowy owls, and Chacoan peccaries.

The zoo breeds Andean bears as part of a program to preserve the species; the first Andean bear was born at the zoo in 2017, and eight Andean bears have been born there . The zoo has had breeding programs for Southern pudu since 2005, pronghorn antelopes since 2008, and New England cottontail rabbits since 2015. There is also a breeding program for Puerto Rican crested toads. Several animals have been rescued and resettled at the zoo, including a coyote caught in Central Park, two lion cubs rescued from Montana, and five coyote pups rescued from Massachusetts.

== Reception ==
When the zoo opened, a reviewer for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; said that &quot;the city&#x27;s latest animal farm is small...and beautiful&quot;. The same writer said in 1969 that &quot;we vote it as one of the most beautiful&quot; attractions in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, particularly praising the aviary and the seal pool. &quot;Newsday&quot; wrote in 1977 that &quot;the Queens Zoo may strike visitors as a sylvan paradise&quot;, especially as compared with the cages in the Central Park Zoo, because animals at the Queens Zoo were allowed to roam around. By the late 1970s, the zoo&#x27;s decline led one local politician to describe the Flushing Meadows Zoo as a &quot;poor man&#x27;s zoo&quot;, while &quot;Newsday&quot; remarked that the zoo &quot;scarcely attracts Flushing citizens out for a walk&quot;, let alone tourists. Just before the zoo&#x27;s renovation in 1987, &quot;Newsday&quot; wrote that the zoo was &quot;a quiet, well-kept and surprisingly natural haven&quot;, despite the presence of the nearby Grand Central Parkway.

After the zoo reopened in 1992, Sarah Lyall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said: &quot;The Queens Zoo isn&#x27;t the old Noah&#x27;s Ark hodgepodge [...] but is rather a modest but carefully chosen collection of 40 species from North America.&quot; Another &quot;Times&quot; writer, Dulcie Leimbach, described the zoo as &quot;a comfortable yet exotic visit&quot; and likened the landscape to a wooded backyard. A &quot;Newsday&quot; writer described the zoo&#x27;s new design as evoking &quot;a natural rather than a zoo setting&quot;. A &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reporter wrote in 1996 that &quot;you&#x27;re sure to feel at home on this range&quot; because of the zoo&#x27;s activities and animals. A writer for the &quot;Poughkeepsie Journal&quot; likened the zoo to a national park in 2007, and one writer for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; described the zoo in 2013 as &quot;a romantic paradise of tall trees, flowering shrubs and rocky outcroppings disturbed only by the roar of the Grand Central Parkway.&quot; A &quot;New York Times&quot; writer characterized the aviary as the &quot;most charming (and definitely the chirpiest) oasis in the park&quot;.

<text>Zeller&#x27;s congruence is an algorithm devised by Christian Zeller in the 19th century to calculate the day of the week for any Julian or Gregorian calendar date. It can be considered to be based on the conversion between Julian day and the calendar date.

== Formula ==
For the Gregorian calendar, Zeller&#x27;s congruence is

:formula_1

for the Julian calendar it is

:formula_2

where 

* &quot;h&quot; is the day of the week (0 = Saturday, 1 = Sunday, 2 = Monday, ..., 6 = Friday)
* &quot;q&quot; is the day of the month
* &quot;m&quot; is the month (3 = March, 4 = April, 5 = May, ..., 14 = February)
* &quot;K&quot; the year of the century formula_3. (The &quot;adjYear&quot; (adjusted year) is explained in the Note below.)
* &quot;J&quot; is the zero-based century (actually formula_4) For example, the zero-based centuries for 1995 and 2000 are 19 and 20 respectively (not to be confused with the common ordinal century enumeration which indicates 20th for both cases).
* formula_5 is the floor function or integer part
* mod is the modulo operation or remainder after division

Note: In this algorithm January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year. E.g. if it is 2 February 2010 (02/02/2010 in DD/MM/YYYY), the algorithm counts the date as the second day of the fourteenth month of 2009 (02/14/2009 in DD/MM/YYYY format) So the &quot;adjusted year&quot; above is:
:formula_6 = the actual year, for months from March to December.
:formula_6 = the previous year, for January and February.

For an ISO week date Day-of-Week &quot;d&quot; (1 = Monday to 7 = Sunday), use
:formula_8

== Analysis ==
These formulas are based on the observation that the day of the week progresses in a predictable manner based upon each subpart of that date. Each term within the formula is used to calculate the offset needed to obtain the correct day of the week.

For the Gregorian calendar, the various parts of this formula can therefore be understood as follows:

* formula_9 represents the progression of the day of the week based on the day of the month, since each successive day results in an additional offset of 1 in the day of the week.
* formula_10 represents the progression of the day of the week based on the year. Assuming that each year is 365 days long, the same date on each succeeding year will be offset by a value of formula_11.
* Since there are 366 days in each leap year, this needs to be accounted for by adding another day to the day of the week offset value. This is accomplished by adding formula_12 to the offset. This term is calculated as an integer result. Any remainder is discarded.
* Using similar logic, the progression of the day of the week for each century may be calculated by observing that there are 36,524 days in a normal century and 36,525 days in each century divisible by 400. Since formula_13 and formula_14, the term formula_15 accounts for this.
* The term formula_16 adjusts for the variation in the days of the month. Starting from January, the days in a month are {31, 28/29, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31}. February&#x27;s 28 or 29 days is a problem, so the formula rolls January and February around to the end so February&#x27;s short count will not cause a problem. The formula is interested in days of the week, so the numbers in the sequence can be taken modulo 7. Then the number of days in a month modulo 7 (still starting with January) would be {3, 0/1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3}. Starting in March, the sequence basically alternates 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, but every five months there are two 31-day months in a row (July–August and December–January). The fraction 13/5 = 2.6 and the floor function have that effect; the denominator of 5 sets a period of 5 months.
* The overall function, formula_17, normalizes the result to reside in the range of 0 to 6, which yields the index of the correct day of the week for the date being analyzed.
The reason that the formula differs between calendars is that the Julian calendar does not have a separate rule for leap centuries and is offset from the Gregorian calendar by a fixed number of days each century.

Since the Gregorian calendar was adopted at different times in different regions of the world, the location of an event is significant in determining the correct day of the week for a date that occurred during this transition period. This is only required through 1929, as this was the last year that the Julian calendar was still in use by any country on earth, and thus is not required for 1930 or later.

The formulae can be used , but &quot;Year 0&quot; is in fact year 1 BC (see astronomical year numbering). The Julian calendar is in fact proleptic right up to 1 March AD 4 owing to mismanagement in Rome (but not Egypt) in the period since the calendar was put into effect on 1 January 45 BC (which was not a leap year). In addition, the modulo operator might truncate integers to the wrong direction (ceiling instead of floor). To accommodate this, one can add a sufficient multiple of 400 Gregorian or 700 Julian years.

== Examples ==
For 1 January 2000, the date would be treated as the 13th month of 1999, so the values would be:

:formula_18
:formula_19
:formula_20
:formula_21

So the formula evaluates as formula_22.

(The 36 comes from formula_23, truncated to an integer.)

However, for 1 March 2000, the date is treated as the 3rd month of 2000, so the values become

:formula_18
:formula_25
:formula_26
:formula_27

so the formula evaluates as formula_28.

== Implementations in software ==

=== Basic modification ===

The formulas rely on the mathematician&#x27;s definition of modulo division, which means that −2 mod 7 is equal to positive 5. Unfortunately, in the truncating way most computer languages implement the remainder function, −2 mod 7 returns a result of −2. So, to implement Zeller&#x27;s congruence on a computer, the formulas should be altered slightly to ensure a positive numerator. The simplest way to do this is to replace with and with .

For the Gregorian calendar, Zeller&#x27;s congruence becomes
:formula_29

For the Julian calendar, Zeller&#x27;s congruence becomes
:formula_30
One can readily see that, in a given year, the last day of February and March 1 are a good test dates.

As an aside note, if we have a three-digit number abc, where a, b, and c are the digits, each nonpositive if abc is nonpositive; we have (abc) mod 7 = 9*a + 3*b + c. Repeat the formula down to a single digit. If the result is 7, 8, or 9, then subtract 7. If, instead, the result is negative, then add 7. If the result is still negative, then add 7 one more time. Utilizing this approach, we can avoid the worries of language specific differences in mod 7 evaluations. This also may enhance a mental math technique.

=== Common simplification ===
Zeller used decimal arithmetic, and found it convenient to use &quot;J&quot; and &quot;K&quot; values as two-digit numbers representing the year and century. But when using a computer, it is simpler to handle the year as a single 4-digit number.
For the Gregorian calendar, Zeller&#x27;s congruence becomes
:formula_31

where formula_32 is formula_6, defined in the section above.

In this case there is no possibility of underflow due to the single negative term because formula_34.

For the Julian calendar, Zeller&#x27;s congruence becomes
:formula_35

The algorithm above is mentioned for the Gregorian case in , Appendix B, albeit in an abridged form that returns 0 for Sunday.

=== Other variations ===
At least three other algorithms share the overall structure of Zeller&#x27;s congruence in its &quot;common simplification&quot; type, also using an and the &quot;modified year&quot; construct. 

* Michael Keith published a piece of very short C code in 1990 for Gregorian dates. The month-length component (formula_16) is replaced by formula_37.
* J R Stockton provides a Sunday-is-0 version with formula_38, calling it a variation of Zeller.
* Claus Tøndering describes formula_39 as a Sunday-is-0 replacement.

Both expressions can be shown to progress in a way that is off by one compared to the original month-length component over the required range of , resulting in a starting value of 0 for Sunday.

<text>Philip Craig Russell (born October 30, 1951) is an American comics artist, writer, and illustrator. His work has won multiple Harvey and Eisner Awards. Russell was the fourth mainstream comic book creator to come out as openly gay, following Andy Mangels in 1988, Craig Hamilton in 1989, and Eric Shanower in 1990.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Philip Craig Russell was born October 30, 1951 in Wellsville, Ohio. He entered the comics industry in 1972 as an assistant to Dan Adkins. Russell first became well known with his 11–issue &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; run and subsequent graphic novel featuring Killraven, hero of a future version of H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, collaborating with writer Don McGregor. Comics historian Peter Sanderson wrote that, &quot;McGregor&#x27;s finest artistic collaborator on the series was P. Craig Russell, whose sensitive, elaborate artwork, evocative of &quot;Art Nouveau&quot; illustration, gave the landscape of Killraven&#x27;s America a nostalgic, pastoral feel, and the Martian architecture the look of futuristic castles.&quot; At DC Comics, Russell inked Batman stories in &quot;Batman Family&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot; over the pencils of Michael Golden and Jim Starlin respectively.

Withdrawing for a while from mainstream comics, Russell produced a number of experimental strips, many of which were later published in his &quot;Night Music&quot; series and in &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot;.

=== &quot;Elric&quot; (1982–1997) ===

Russell&#x27;s first &quot;Elric&quot; story, the Roy Thomas scripted &quot;The Dreaming City&quot;, was published by Marvel Comics in 1982 as &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; #2, following initial publication of the first half of the graphic novel in &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot;. For the next series, &quot;Elric of Melnibone&quot;, also written by Roy Thomas, Russell shared art duties with Michael T. Gilbert. This story was published by Pacific Comics as &quot;Elric&quot; issues #1–6 in 1983–1984. Russell did not return to Elric until 1997 when he collaborated directly with Michael Moorcock on &quot;Elric: Stormbringer&quot;, co-published by Dark Horse Comics and Topps Comics.

=== &quot;Night Music&quot; (1984–1990) ===
In 1984, Russell began &quot;Night Music&quot;, an ongoing anthology series for Eclipse Comics featuring some of his most heralded literary and operatic adaptations. Russell has previously used the same title for a black and white collection of the earliest of these works, published by Eclipse Comics. Included in this series was &quot;The King&#x27;s Ankus&quot;, adapted from Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Book&quot;. Russell had previously inked a number of &quot;Jungle Book&quot; adaptations drawn by Gil Kane, published in &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot; #8–11 (May–Nov. 1983). The series included &quot;Pelleas &amp; Melisande&quot;, adapted from Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s play of the same name which had been turned into an opera by Claude Debussy, and &quot;Salome&quot; adapted from Oscar Wilde&#x27;s play of the same name which was the basis for Richard Strauss&#x27;s opera. Opera would continue to resurface in Russell&#x27;s work, including a four-part adaptation of &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, taken from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s opera.

=== Other works ===
Russell inked Mike Mignola&#x27;s pencils on the &quot;Phantom Stranger&quot; limited series in 1987. Russell illustrated issue #50 of writer Neil Gaiman&#x27;s comic book series &quot;The Sandman&quot;. The story was titled &quot;Ramadan&quot; and was later included in the collection &quot;The Sandman: Fables and Reflections&quot;. Russell drew the first story in Gaiman&#x27;s later Sandman graphic novel, &quot;Endless Nights&quot;, and adapted both Gaiman&#x27;s short story &quot;Murder Mysteries&quot; and his children&#x27;s book &quot;Coraline&quot; into comics form. He has adapted another Gaiman Sandman work, &quot;&quot;, and a Robert E. Howard Conan the Barbarian story, &quot;The Jewels of Gwahlur&quot;. Russell got involved with a collaborative art project with the Web-based artist group Kaleidospace in 1994.

In 1991, Kent State University student Michael Mould began translating Ruggero Leoncavallo&#x27;s opera &quot;Pagliacci&quot; into English for a comics adaptation, but died on USAir Flight 405 before he could complete it. Marc Andreyko finished Mould&#x27;s translation as &quot;The Clowns&quot;, a one-shot written by Russell and illustrated by Galen Showman. Published in 1998 by Dark Horse Comics, &quot;The Clowns&quot; is dedicated in memory of Mould.

Beginning in 2000, Dark Horse Comics published Russell&#x27;s adaptation of Richard Wagner&#x27;s operatic cycle, &quot;The Ring of the Nibelung&quot; as 14 comic books; in 2001, the series won two Eisner Awards: for Best Finite Series/Limited Series, and for Best Artist/Penciller/Inker or Penciller/Inker Team. The series since been published as a single-volume hardcover book. He has adapted the fairy tales of Oscar Wilde into comic-book albums from NBM Publishing.

In December 2007, Desperado published &quot;The Art of P. Craig Russell&quot;, a 256-page retrospective of Russell&#x27;s career. It was nominated for the 2008 Eisner Award for Best Comics-Related Book. A documentary feature about the artist, &quot;Night Music: The Art of P. Craig Russell&quot;, premiered at the 2008 Mid-Ohio Con in Columbus, Ohio.

In November 2015, Wayne Alan Harold Productions published the &quot;P. Craig Russell Sketchbook Archives&quot;, a 250-page hardcover art book featuring the best of Russell&#x27;s personal sketchbooks. The same publisher is currently creating an Artist&#x27;s Edition-type line of 12&quot; x 17&quot; hardcovers that reproduce Russell&#x27;s original art at full-size.&quot;

<text>The Central Park Zoo is a zoo located at the southeast corner of Central Park in New York City. It is part of an integrated system of four zoos and one aquarium managed by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). In conjunction with the Central Park Zoo&#x27;s operations, the WCS offers children&#x27;s educational programs, is engaged in restoration of endangered species populations, and reaches out to the local community through volunteer programs.

Its precursor, a menagerie, was founded in 1864, becoming the first public zoo to open in New York. The present facility first opened as a city zoo on December 2, 1934, and was part of a larger revitalization program of city parks, playgrounds and zoos initiated in 1934 by New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks) commissioner Robert Moses. It was built, in large part, through Civil Works Administration and Works Progress Administration (WPA) labor and funding. The Children&#x27;s Zoo opened to the north of the main zoo in 1960, using funding from a donation by Senator Herbert Lehman and his wife Edith.

After 49 years of operation as a city zoo run by NYC Parks, Central Park Zoo closed in 1983 for reconstruction. The closure was part of a five-year, $35 million renovation program, that completely replaced the zoo&#x27;s cages with naturalistic environments. It was rededicated on August 8, 1988, as part of a system of five facilities managed by the WCS, all of which are accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).

== Description ==

The Central Park Zoo is part of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), an integrated network of four zoos and an aquarium spread throughout New York City. Located at East 64th Street and Fifth Avenue, the zoo is situated on a plot in Central Park. Visitors may enter through the Fifth Avenue entrance or from within Central Park.

The Central Park Zoo is a major tourist attraction within Central Park, drawing more than one million people every year. According to a 2011 study by the Central Park Conservancy, the zoo and its surroundings were visited by an estimated four million people each year. However, the WCS cites much lower figures since it only counts patrons with tickets. In 2007, it recorded that 1.01 million people visited the Central Park Zoo, and in 2006, 1.03 million people. , the Central Park Zoo had 1,487 animals representing 163 species.

=== Main zoo ===
Trellised, vine-clad, glass-roofed pergolas link the three major exhibit areas—tropic, temperate and polar—housed in discrete buildings of brick trimmed with granite, masked by vines. The exhibit areas are centered around a square central garden that contains a square sea lion pool in its center. The sea lion pool is surrounded by glass fencing to allow visitors to observe the sea lions and their daily feedings.

==== Exhibits and other buildings ====
The structure at the central garden&#x27;s southwestern corner is the &quot;Tropic Zone&quot;, which contains a two-story representation of a rain forest. The rain forest contains Rodrigues flying foxes, Seba&#x27;s short-tailed bats, emerald tree boas, pythons, cotton-top tamarins, white-eared titis, toucans, black-and-white ruffed lemurs from the Bronx Zoo and a large variety of birds including scarlet ibis, emerald starlings, superb starlings, pied avocets, speckled mousebirds, sunbittern, troupials, Taveta golden weaver, blue-crowned motmots, crested couas, blue-gray tanagers, African pygmy goose, ochre-marked parakeets, white-fronted amazons, blue-headed macaws, plum-headed parakeets, Derbyan parakeets, Fischer&#x27;s lovebirds, golden conures, red bird-of-paradise, superb bird-of-paradise, Nicobar pigeons, black-naped fruit doves, green peacocks, Victoria crowned-pigeons, coroneted fruit doves, kagus, blue-and-yellow and green winged macaws. The zoo also keeps piranhas, pig-nosed turtles, and red-footed tortoises. There is also a large free-flight area for birds. The elephant house of the original menagerie was formerly located at the site.

To the west of the garden is the &quot;Temperate Territory&quot;, a landscaped series of paths surrounding a lake. It hosts animals such as red pandas, white-naped cranes, snow monkeys, and snow leopards. A snow leopard exhibit in the Temperate Territory opened in June 2009. The Temperate Territory is located on the site of the 1934 zoo&#x27;s cafeteria.

The northern side of the garden is adjacent to the &quot;Penguins and Sea Birds&quot; section. This multilevel structure contains a chilled penguin house that contains macaroni penguins, king penguins, chinstrap penguins, gentoo penguins, Atlantic puffins, tufted puffins and an outdoor pool with harbor seals, as well as an outdoor grizzly bear exhibit. It is located on the site of a lion house that was built in 1934 along with the original menagerie.

The eastern side of the central garden is next to the Arsenal, technically located outside the zoo. The structure was completed in 1851 and originally intended as a weapons and ammunition storehouse for the New York State Militia. It once served as an actual zoo building, but now contains NYC Parks Department offices. Central Park Zoo also includes a 4D theater, located to the north of the Arsenal, while a gift shop and ticket booth are located to the south of the Arsenal.

The southern side of the garden contains the Intelligence Garden, located at the site of the original menagerie&#x27;s horned animal/small mammal house. Its name is inspired by a rare-animal menagerie created by King Wen of Zhou in 1100 B.C. A cafeteria, the Dancing Crane Cafe, is located to the south of the Intelligence Garden.

==== Art and conservation programs ====
Several works of public art can be found in the Central Park Zoo. Five structures, preserved from the original zoo built in 1934, still feature their original animal-themed limestone friezes sculpted by Frederick Roth. The same artist created a pair of bronze statues for the original zoo, &quot;Dancing Goat&quot; and &quot;Dancing Bear&quot;, which now flank the zoo&#x27;s southern entrance. &quot;Tigress and Cubs&quot;, one of the park&#x27;s oldest statues, was created by Auguste Cain in 1867 and installed on a rock outcrop near the Lake, but moved to the zoo in 1934.

The zoo coordinates breeding programs for some endangered species as part of the Species Survival Plan, such as thick-billed parrots and red pandas. In 2011, the WCS announced that the Central Park Zoo was the first North American zoo to hatch ducklings of critically endangered scaly-sided mergansers. In addition, the first example of whispering in non-human primates was observed at the Central Park Zoo in 2013, when tamarin monkeys were heard whispering around a staff member that they disliked.

The zoo hosts educational venues as well as exhibits. The volunteer program at the Central Park Zoo engages members of the community; it is a combination outreach and educational program for adults. Volunteer guides conduct tours for visitors, while volunteer augment the educational program. Docents enroll in a four-month training program. The zoo also offers several programs for students.

=== Children&#x27;s Zoo ===
The Children&#x27;s Zoo is located north of the main zoo. It is officially named the Tisch Children&#x27;s Zoo after businessman Laurence A. Tisch, whose donation funded the zoo&#x27;s 1990s renovation. The Children&#x27;s Zoo contains a petting zoo with mini nubian goats (a crossbreed between Nigerian dwarf and Nubian goats), sheep, pigs, alpacas, Patagonian cavies, and the only cow in Manhattan, as well as the Acorn Theatre, a performing arts theater. Admission to the Children&#x27;s Zoo is included with the purchase of tickets to the main zoo.

The Lehman Gates by Paul Manship are a notable feature retained from the original Children&#x27;s Zoo. They were donated by Herbert and Edith Lehman in 1960 in honor of their 50th anniversary, and as part of their donation toward the construction of the Children&#x27;s Zoo itself. The gates were renovated in the 1980s. Additionally, the Delacorte Clock, a gift of George T. Delacorte dedicated in 1965, is mounted on a three-tiered tower above the arcade between the Wildlife Center and the Children&#x27;s Zoo.

== History ==

=== Original menagerie ===

==== Planning and creation ====
The zoo was not part of the original Greensward Plan for Central Park created by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. However, a menagerie near the Arsenal, on the edge of Central Park located at Fifth Avenue facing East 64th Street, spontaneously evolved from gifts of exotic pets and other animals informally given to the park. The first animal, a bear cub tied to a tree, was left in Central Park in 1859, followed by a monkey the next year. These animals were popular with the park&#x27;s visitors even though there was no formal zoo at the time. Soon, people began donating other animals such as cranes, a peacock, and goldfish. Unsolicited donations came from a variety of people, from prominent figures to young boys. The donations also included dead animals. The Central Park planning commission recorded all of these donations in its annual reports.

The American Zoological and Botanical Society, which sought to create a zoo somewhere in New York City, was created in early 1860. The group began discussing possible sites for a zoo, among them Central Park. By 1862, were set aside for the construction of a future &quot;zoological and botanical garden&quot;, later the Central Park Zoo. However, since the zoo&#x27;s site was not yet formally designated, the animals were kept in the Central Park Mall. Popular animals included three bald eagles and a bald-headed monkey. In 1864, a formal zoo received charter confirmation from New York&#x27;s assembly, making it the United States&#x27; second publicly owned zoo, after the Philadelphia Zoo, which was founded in 1859. By then, the park had over 400 animals. More than 250 animals would be donated in 1864–1865 alone.

Originally the zoo was supposed to be located in Manhattan Square, on the west side of Central Park where the American Museum of Natural History is now located, though this location was never used as a zoo. Up to twelve sites would eventually be considered for the zoo throughout the last three decades of the 19th century, including the North Meadow of Central Park. Some animals were moved to the Arsenal in 1865, and larger animals grazed there during summers. A &quot;deer park&quot; was established at the current site of the Metropolitan Museum of Art three years later. In 1870, when the Tammany Hall political organization took control of the Central Park commission, it mandated that the Central Park menagerie buy its own animals rather than accept donations, and it moved the animals to five structures behind the Arsenal. The same year, Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins sculpted dinosaur figures for the Paleozoic Museum, a proposed dinosaur museum near the zoo, but they were destroyed in a fit of vandalism that the Geologists&#x27; Association described as &quot;perplexing&quot;.

==== Popularity and decline ====
The menagerie became popular because of its free admission and proximity to working-class Lower Manhattan; by 1873, it saw 2.5 million annual visitors. The first permanent menagerie building was constructed behind the Arsenal in 1875. The menagerie reached peak popularity in the mid-1880s after a chimpanzee nicknamed &quot;Mike Crowley&quot; was imported from Liberia. Observers such as former president Ulysses S. Grant showed up at the Monkey House to see the chimpanzee, overfilling the building past capacity. However, Irish-American groups took offense to the chimpanzee&#x27;s nickname, saying that the names given to animals in the Central Park menagerie were stereotypically Irish, and thus derogatory to that ethnic group. Frederick Law Olmsted also disapproved of the menagerie, believing Central Park to be better suited for scenic vistas than for entertainment, though he admitted that the zoo was the most popular part of the park.

By the 1890s, wealthy residents of nearby neighborhoods were clamoring for the zoo to be relocated somewhere else, such as the North Meadow. However, these efforts met resistance, as the Central Park menagerie was popular among the general public and among the politicians that represented them. This subsequently led to the creation of the Bronx Zoo, a much larger, privately operated zoo in the Bronx in 1897. Though wealthy residents hoped that people would travel to the Bronx Zoo for its superior facilities, the Central Park Zoo continued to be popular even after the Bronx Zoo opened in 1899. The Central Park menagerie attracted over three million people annually by 1902, more than the Museum of Natural History and the Metropolitan Museum combined, despite only receiving one-fifth as much money as either of the museums.

Through the early 20th century, the quality of the menagerie declined through neglect from the city government, which administered the zoo. The zoo accepted creatures of all kinds, even those with health problems, but offered insufficient veterinary care. In 1919, some of the structures at the Central Park menagerie were modified to accommodate the addition of new animals. Subsequently, in 1932, a new concrete structure was built for the zoo&#x27;s wolves because the previous steel enclosure was deemed insufficient to contain the wolves. By then, the zoo was extremely rundown, and its 22 cages were regarded as &quot;flimsy and rat-ridden&quot;. The wooden sheds posed a fire hazard, and the enclosures were so ineffective that zookeepers guarded the lion house to prevent the lions from escaping.

=== Current zoo ===

==== Construction of new zoo ====
After assuming office in January 1934, New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia hired Robert Moses to head a newly unified Parks Department. Moses soon prepared extensive plans to reconstruct the city&#x27;s parks, renovate existing facilities and create new swimming pools, zoos, playgrounds and parks. Moses acquired substantial Civil Works Administration, and later, Works Progress Administration funding and soon embarked upon an eight-year citywide construction program, relieving some of the high unemployment in New York City in this Depression year.

Plans for the new Central Park Zoo were prepared by Aymar Embury II within a 16-day span in February 1934 and were announced the following month. Embury&#x27;s plans called for nine terracotta and brick structures to replace the structures in the menagerie. These structures included seven new animal enclosures, as well as a comfort station and a garage. A sea lion pool, designed by Charles Schmieder, was to be located in the center of the new zoo, surrounded by the zoo enclosures on three sides. The new structures were designed in such a way that they could be maintained easily. The buildings, to cost $411,000, were designed in conjunction with new enclosures at the Prospect Park Zoo.

The reconstruction of the zoo was initially criticized by individuals who thought that the money spent on building a zoo would be better utilized on the construction of new schools around the city. During the reconstruction, the previous structures were entirely demolished. While construction was ongoing, animals were temporarily moved to other zoos. The rebuilt zoo opened on December 2, 1934, at a ceremony where former governor Al Smith was given the honorary title of &quot;night superintendent&quot;. By April 1936, the renovated zoo had seen six million visitors since its reopening. To prevent the recurrence of rat infestations, Moses also instituted a rat-elimination program in and around the zoo.

==== 1960s and 1970s ====
In June 1960, U.S. Senator Herbert Lehman and his wife Edith donated $500,000 toward the construction of a new children&#x27;s zoo just north of the existing zoo. Work began that November, and the children&#x27;s zoo was officially opened on June 27, 1961. The children&#x27;s zoo featured attractions like a petting area with ducks, rabbits, and chickens; a large fiberglass whale statue dubbed &quot;Whaley&quot; (which acted as the entrance to the small zoo); a Noah&#x27;s Ark feature; and a medieval castle feature. The animals were housed in small storybook-style structures bordering an irregular pond. By 1967, the wooden railings around the main zoo&#x27;s enclosures were rotting, and NYC Parks commissioner August Heckscher II had authorized repairs to these railings. The same year, the zoo cafeteria was renovated after a new concessionaire took control of the cafe.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the New York City Subway&#x27;s 63rd Street lines, the present-day , were being built directly underneath the zoo. A graffiti wall was erected along the line&#x27;s length through Central Park. The tunnel provided a subterranean gathering place for very early subway artists who hung around together in Central Park, and was named &quot;Zoo York&quot; by &quot;ALI&quot;, founder of the SOUL ARTISTS graffiti crew. The name came about because it was in a &quot;zoo&quot; in New &quot;York&quot;, hence &quot;Zoo York&quot;. The construction of the subway line itself was controversial because it called for of cut-and-cover tunneling, which required digging an open trench through Central Park and then covering it over. One of the concerns was that the Central Park Zoo, and a bird sanctuary outside the zoo, were located very close to the boundary of the trench. Eventually, the New York City Transit Authority, which operated the New York City Subway, agreed to reduce disruption by halving the length of the cut.

A nature kiosk at Central Park Zoo was added in 1972, and a $500,000 renovation for the Lion House was proposed the following year. By then, the Central Park Zoo was quite dilapidated: in November 1974, protesters gathered outside the zoo to protest the conditions there. NYC Parks commissioner Gordon Davis described the zoo as a &quot;Rikers Island for animals&quot;. Even so, the zoo was one of the most popular attractions in Central Park through the 1980s, according to surveys taken during that era.

Around the same time, there was a plan to shift control of the Central Park, Prospect Park, and Queens Zoos from the city government to the New York Zoological Society, a quasi-public conservation organization. At the time, none of the zoos had dedicated curatorial staff and all had only a skeletal zookeeping staff. The society proposed sending the larger animals to different zoos with more humane conditions, and animal-rights groups sued the city in an effort to close the two zoos and move the animals to the larger Bronx Zoo. A 1976 report by the World Federation for the Protection of Animals found that all three zoos were operating in &quot;shameful conditions&quot;, and that the animals at the Central Park and Prospect Park Zoos were living in poorly maintained facilities.

==== 1980s renovation ====

The administration of mayor Ed Koch and the New York Zoological Society (renamed the Wildlife Conservation Society, or WCS, in 1993) signed a fifty-year agreement in April 1980, wherein the Central Park, Prospect Park, and Queens Zoos would be administered by the Society. They proposed renovation plans for all three zoos in 1981. The Central Park Zoo&#x27;s renovation plan called for the demolition of five of the six structures around the sea lion pool (except for the Arsenal), as well as new classrooms and auditoriums for students, and a snack bar to replace the zoo&#x27;s concessions. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;the caging of these animals in inadequate spaces has long enraged animal lovers.&quot; Starting in November 1982, the Central Park Zoo&#x27;s animals were temporarily moved to other zoos while construction was ongoing. Most of the large animals were permanently rehoused in larger, more natural spaces at the Bronx Zoo. The zoo had three &quot;problem animals&quot; that few other zoos wanted to take, but even they found homes.

The main zoo was closed in late 1983, though the children&#x27;s zoo remained open. Demolition continued through 1984, though construction on the new zoo did not begin until the following year. The subsequent redesign was executed by Kevin Roche of Kevin Roche John Dinkeloo Associates. The facility&#x27;s menagerie cages were replaced with three naturalistic habitats that blended with Central Park&#x27;s scenery. Four of the original buildings were preserved in the redesigned zoo, though the cramped outdoor cages were demolished. The central feature of the original zoo, the sea lion pool, was retained.

The renovation was originally budgeted at $8.3 million. The renovated zoo was then planned to reopen in 1985 at a cost of $14 million, but the project was delayed for three years. The zoo reopened to the public on August 8, 1988. The renovation ended up costing $35 million. Of this, the city contributed $22 million while the Society contributed the balance. In order to pay for the zoo construction, the Society started charging admission for zoo patrons for the first time in the zoo&#x27;s history. With the reopening of the Central Park Zoo, the Society aimed to designate each of its three small zoos with a specific purpose. The Central Park Zoo would be focused toward conservation; the Prospect Park Zoo would be primarily a children&#x27;s zoo; and the Queens Zoo would become a zoo with North American animals.

==== 1990s to present ====
By the early 1990s, some of the structures at the Children&#x27;s Zoo had collapsed, and there were reports that the animals were being neglected. Under threat of closure by federal regulators, the city closed the zoo in 1991. Though the WCS had a plan to renovate the zoo, it languished for years because the restoration needed approval from the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC), which had designated several zoo buildings as landmarks. Furthermore, there were disputes over what the theme of the renovated Children&#x27;s Zoo should be. The $6 million plan to renovate the Children&#x27;s Zoo was approved by the LPC in 1996, though it was opposed by preservationists who wanted to prevent the zoo&#x27;s structures from demolition. The renovation was initially supposed to be funded by $3 million from Henry and Edith Everett, but the Everetts withdrew their gift due to disputes over how the money should be spent. With the help of a $4.5 million grant from businessman Laurence A. Tisch, the Children&#x27;s Zoo was renovated and renamed the Tisch Children&#x27;s Zoo upon its reopening in September 1997.

In June 2009, the Allison Maher Stern Snow Leopard Exhibit opened with three snow leopards, moved from the Bronx Zoo. The exhibit, costing $10.6 million, was the first new feature in the zoo since its 1988 renovation. In March 2020, the Central Park Zoo and the WCS&#x27;s other facilities were shuttered indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. The zoo reopened that July.

== Hoax ==
A famous hoax regarding the zoo is known as the &quot;Central Park Zoo escape&quot; and the &quot;Central Park menagerie scare of 1874&quot;. It was a hoax perpetrated by James Gordon Bennett Jr. in his newspaper, the &quot;New York Herald&quot;. J. I. C. Clarke was the primary writer of the hoax, under the direction and inspiration of the &quot;Herald&quot;″s managing editor, T. B. Connery, who often walked through the zoo, and had witnessed the near-escape of a leopard. The &quot;Herald″&quot;s cover story of November 9, 1874, claimed that there had been a mass escape of animals from the Central Park Zoo and that several people had been killed by the free-roaming beasts. A rhinoceros was said to be the first escapee, goring his keeper to death and setting into motion the escape of other animals, including a polar bear, a panther, a Numidian lion, several hyenas, and a Bengal tiger.

At the end of the lengthy article, which was divided across several pages of the newspaper, the following notice was the only indication that the story horrifying readers across the city was a hoax: &quot;... of course, the entire story given above is a pure fabrication. Not one word of it is true.&quot; That was not enough to assuage critics, however, who accused Bennett of inciting panic when the extent of the hoax became widely known. The authors later claimed their intent was merely to draw attention to inadequate safety precautions at the zoo, and claimed to be surprised at the extent of the reaction to their story.

== Notable animals ==
*In the early 20th century, Bill Snyder was hired at the zoo; he purchased Hattie, an Asian elephant, in 1920. Hattie died in 1922.
*Pattycake, a female western lowland gorilla, was born at the zoo in 1972 and was thus the first gorilla successfully born in captivity in New York. Her handlers assumed she was a male and originally named her &quot;Sonny Jim&quot;. She moved to the Bronx Zoo in 1982, where she remained until her death in 2013.
*Gus, a male polar bear, lived at the zoo from 1988 to 2013, when he had to be euthanized after being diagnosed with an inoperable tumor.
*Flaco, a Eurasian eagle owl, was taken to the zoo in 2010. Flaco escaped when his enclosure was damaged in 2023; he was found dead outside the park in 2024.

== In media ==
The Central Park Zoo is depicted in the 2005 animated film &quot;Madagascar&quot; as the place from which the main characters escaped.

<text>The 1991 West Virginia derecho was a serial derecho (storm) that started in Arkansas in the early morning hours of April 9, 1991, and made its way northeast, finally dying out over Pennsylvania late that evening.

It was the worst severe weather event for West Virginia since the 1974 Super Outbreak.

==Description==
Two people were killed and 145 were injured in the event, mainly from falling trees, flying debris, and mobile homes and trailers being overturned. Western and central West Virginia were affected by hail and several roads were blocked.

Most of the destructive damage occurred in Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, western Maryland, and Western Pennsylvania. The fatalities associated with this storm occurred in Charleston, West Virginia and Huntington, West Virginia as a result of the high winds.

==Damage claims==
In West Virginia alone, there were 8,000 insurance damage claims for homes and businesses. More than 200,000 people lost power in the derecho. Many people experienced flickering lights and power surges. This derecho was the worst severe weather event for West Virginia since the 1974 Super Outbreak.

== What is a Derecho? ==
There are several criteria for a mesoscale convective system (MCS) to be considered a derecho. The system needs to have sustained winds of 58 mph, and stretch along a boundary at least 250 miles long (400 miles since 2022). There must also be isolated wind gusts of 75 mph or greater.

== Formation of a Derecho ==
# There needs to be sufficient convective available potential energy (CAPE) in the atmosphere for several thunderstorm cells to form. 
# There needs to be sufficient inflow of air in the lower atmosphere, with strong upper level divergence in the upper atmosphere. 
# There needs to be an elevated mixed layer leading to a rapid decrease in temperature with height. 
# There needs to be high values of vertical wind shear (45 mph or greater) in the lowest 5 kilometers of the atmosphere. 
# The system usually has a bow echo type of shape. 
This is a rather simplified list of conditions needed to form a derecho. However, when all of these conditions occur simultaneously in the atmosphere, a derecho storm system has the &quot;potential&quot; to form.

<doc id="1207129" wikidata="Q6664794" url="?curid=1207129" title="Location arithmetic">
<text>Location arithmetic (Latin &quot;arithmetica localis&quot;) is the additive (non-positional) binary numeral systems, which John Napier explored as a computation technique in his treatise &quot;Rabdology&quot; (1617), both symbolically and on a chessboard-like grid.

Napier&#x27;s terminology, derived from using the positions of counters on the board to represent numbers, is potentially misleading because the numbering system is, in facts, non-positional in current vocabulary.

During Napier&#x27;s time, most of the computations were made on boards with tally-marks or jetons. So, unlike how it may be seen by the modern reader, his goal was not to use moves of counters on a board to multiply, divide and find square roots, but rather to find a way to compute symbolically with pen and paper.

However, when reproduced on the board, this new technique did not require mental trial-and-error computations nor complex carry memorization (unlike base 10 computations). He was so pleased by his discovery that he said in his preface:

== Location numerals ==

Binary notation had not yet been standardized, so Napier used what he called location numerals to represent binary numbers. Napier&#x27;s system uses sign-value notation to represent numbers; it uses successive letters from the Latin alphabet to represent successive powers of two: a = 20 = 1, b = 21 = 2, c = 22 = 4, d = 23 = 8, e = 24 = 16 and so on.

To represent a given number as a location numeral, that number is expressed as a sum of powers of two and then each power of two is replaced by its corresponding digit (letter). For example, when converting from a decimal numeral:

: 87 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 16 + 64 = 20 + 21 + 22 + 24 + 26 = abceg

Using the reverse process, a location numeral can be converted to another numeral system. For example, when converting to a decimal numeral:

: abdgkl = 20 + 21 + 23 + 26 + 210 + 211 = 1 + 2 + 8 + 64 + 1024 + 2048 = 3147

Napier showed multiple methods of converting numbers in and out of his numeral system. These methods are similar to modern methods of converting numbers in and out of the binary numeral system, so they are not shown here. Napier also showed how to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and extract square roots.

=== Abbreviated and extended form ===

As in any numeral system using sign-value notation (but &quot;not&quot; those using positional notation), digits (letters) can be repeated such that multiple numerals can represent a single number. For example:

: abbc = acc = ad = 9

Additionally, the order of digits does not matter. For example:

: abbc = bbca = bcba = ... = 9

Because each digit in a location numeral represents twice the value of its next-lower digit, replacing any two occurrences of the same digit with one of the next-higher digit does not change the numeral&#x27;s numeric value. Thus, repeatedly applying the rules of replacement aa → b, bb → c, cc → d, etc. to a location numeral removes all repeated digits from that numeral.

Napier called this process abbreviation and the resulting location numeral the abbreviated form of that numeral; he called location numerals containing repeated digits extended forms. Each number can be represented by a unique abbreviated form, not considering the order of its digits (e.g., abc, bca, cba, etc. all represent the number 7).

=== Arithmetic ===

==== Addition ====

Location numerals allow for a simple and intuitive algorithm for addition:

# join the numerals end-to-end
# when necessary, rearrange this conjoined numeral&#x27;s digits so they are in ascending order
# abbreviate this rearranged and conjoined numeral

For example, to add 157 = acdeh and 230 = bcfgh, join the numerals end-to-end:

: acdeh + bcfgh → acdehbcfgh

rearrange the digits of the previous result (because the digits of acdehbcfgh are not in ascending order):

: acdehbcfgh → abccdefghh

and abbreviate the previous result:

: abccdefghh → abddefghh → abeefghh → abffghh → abgghh → abhhh → abhi

The final result, abhi, equals 387 (abhi = 20 + 21 + 27 + 28 = 1 + 2 + 128 + 256 = 387); this is the same result achieved by adding 157 and 230 in decimal notation.

==== Subtraction ====

Subtraction is also intuitive, but may require expanding abbreviated forms to extended forms to perform borrows.

Write the minuend (the largest number you want to diminish) and remove from it all the digits appearing in the subtrahend (the smallest number). In case the digit to be removed does not appear in the minuend, then &quot;borrow&quot; it by expanding the unit just larger. Repeat until all the digit of the subtrahend have been removed.

A few examples show it is simpler than it sounds :

* Subtract 5 = ac from 77 = acdg :
: acdg - ac = acdg = dg = 8+64 = 72. 
* Subtract 3 = ab from 77 = acdg :
: acdg - ab = abbdg - ab = abbdg = bdg = 2+8+64 = 74.

* Subtract 7 = abc from 77 = acdg :
: acdg - abc = abbccg - abc = abbccg = bcg = 2+4+64 = 70.

==== Doubling, halving, odd and even ====

Napier proceeded to the rest of arithmetic, that is multiplication, division and square root, on an abacus, as it was common in his times. However, since the development of micro-processor computer, a lot of applicable algorithms have been developed or revived based on doubling and halving.

Doubling is done by adding a numeral to itself, which mean doubling each of its digit. This gives an extended form, which has to be abbreviated if needed. This operation can be done in one step by changing each digit of a numeral to the next larger digit. For example, the double of a is b, the double of b is c, the double of ab is bc, the double of acfg is bdgh, etc.

Similarly, multiplying by a power of two, is just translating its digits. To multiply by c = 4, for example, is transforming the digits a → c, b → d, c → e... 
Halving is the reverse of doubling: change each digit to the next smaller digit. For example, the half of bdgh is acfg.

One sees immediately that it is only feasible when the numeral to be halved does not contain an a (or, if the numeral is extended, an odd number of as). In other words, an abbreviated numeral is odd if it contains an a and even if it does not.

With these basic operations (doubling and halving), all the binary algorithms can be adapted starting by, but not limited to, the Bisection method and Dichotomic search.

==== Multiplication ====

Napier performed multiplication and division on an abacus, as was common in his times. However, Egyptian multiplication gives an elegant way to carry out multiplication without tables using only doubling, halving and adding.

Multiplying a single-digit number by another single-digit number is a simple process. Because all letters represent a power of 2, multiplying digits is the same as adding their exponents. This can also be thought of as finding the index of one digit in the alphabet (a = 0, b = 1, ...) and incrementing the other digit by that amount in terms of the alphabet (b + 2 =&gt; d).

For example, multiply 4 = c by 16 = e

c * e = 2^2 * 2^4 = 2^6 = g

or...

&quot;AlphabetIndex&quot;(c) = 2, so... e =&gt; f =&gt; g

To find the product of two multiple digit numbers, make a two column table. In the left column write the digits of the first number, one below the other. For each digit in the left column, multiply that digit and the second number and record it in the right column. Finally, add all the numbers of the right column together.

As an example, multiply 238 = bcdfgh by 13 = acd

The result is the sum in the right column &#x27; = &#x27; = bcekl = 2+4+16+1024+2048 = 3094.

It is interesting to notice that the left column can also be obtained by successive halves of the first number, from which the even numbers are removed. In our example, acd, bc (even), ab, a. Noticing that the right column contains successive doubles of the second number, shows why the peasant multiplication is exact.

==== Division, remainder ====

Division can be carried out by successive subtractions: the quotient is the number of time the divisor can be subtracted from the dividend, and the remainder is what is left after all the possible subtractions.

This process, which can be very long, may be made efficient if instead of the divisor we subtract multiple of the divisor, and computations are easier if we restrict to multiple by a power of 2.

In fact, this is what we do in the long division method.

==The grid==

Location arithmetic uses a square grid where each square on the grid represents a value. Two sides of the grid are marked with
increasing powers of two. Any inner square can be identified by two numbers on these two sides, one being vertically below the inner
square and the other to its far right. The value of the square is the product of these two numbers.

For instance, the square in this example grid represents 32, as it is the product of 4 on the right column and 8 from the bottom row. The grid itself can be any size, and larger grids simply permit us to handle larger numbers.

Notice that moving either one square to the left or one square up doubles the value. This property can be used to perform binary
addition using just a single row of the grid.

===Addition===
First, lay out a binary number on a row using counters to represent the 1s in the number. For example, 29 (= 11101 in binary) would be placed on the board like this:

The number 29 is clearly the sum of the values of the squares on which there are counters. Now overlay the second number on this row. Say we place 9 (= 1001 in binary) on it like this.

The sum of these two numbers is just the total value represented by the counters on the board, but some of the squares have more than one counter. Recall however, that moving to the left of a square doubles its value. So we replace two counters on a square with one counter to its left without changing the total value on the board. Note that this is the same idea used to abbreviate
location numerals. Let&#x27;s start by replacing the rightmost pair of counters with a counter to its left, giving:

We still have another square with two counters on it, so we do it again:

But replacing this pair created another square with two counters on it, so we replace a third time:

Now each square has just one counter, and reading off the result in binary 100110 (= 38) gives the correct result.

===Subtraction===
Subtracting is not much more complicated than addition: instead of adding counters on the board we remove them. To &quot;borrow&quot; a value, we replace a counter on a square with two to its right.

Let&#x27;s see how we might subtract 12 from 38. First place 38 (= 100110 in binary) on a row, and then place 12 (= 1100 in binary) under it:

For every counter on the lower row that has a counter above it, remove both counters. We can remove one such pair on the board,
resulting in:

Now we need to &quot;borrow&quot; counters to get rid of the remaining counter on the bottom. First replace the leftmost counter on the top row with two to its right:

Now replace one of the two counters with two more to its right, giving:

We can now take away one of the counters on the top row with the remaining counter on the bottom row:

and read off 26, the final result.

===Some properties of the grid===

Unlike addition and subtraction, the entire grid is used to multiply, divide, and extract square roots. The grid has some useful properties utilized in these operations. First, all the squares on any diagonal going from the bottom left to the top right have the same value.

Since a diagonal move can be broken down into a move to the right (which halves the value) followed by a move
up (which doubles the value), the value of the square stays the same.

In conjunction with that diagonal property, there is a quick way to divide the numbers on the bottom and right edges of the grid.

Locate the dividend 32 along the right side and the divisor 8 on the bottom edge of the grid. Extend a diagonal from the dividend and locate the square where it intersects a vertical line from the divisor. The quotient lies at the right end of the grid from this square, which for our example is 4.

Why does this work? Moving along the diagonal does not change the value; the value of the square on the intersection is still the dividend. But we also know it is the product of the squares along the bottom and right edge. Since the square on the bottom edge is the divisor, the square on the right edge is the quotient.

Napier extends this idea to divide two arbitrary numbers, as shown below.

==Multiplication==
To multiply a pair of binary numbers, first mark the two numbers
on the bottom and the right side of the grid. Say we want to
multiply 22 (= 10110) by 9 (= 1001).

Now place counters at every &quot;intersection&quot; of vertical and
horizontal rows of the 1s in each number.

Notice that each row of counters on the grid is just
22 multiplied by some
power of two. In fact, the total value of the counters is the
sum of two rows
: 22*8 + 22*1 = 22*(8+1) = 22*9
So the counters on the board actually represent the product
of the two numbers, except it is not possible to &quot;read off&quot; the
answer just yet.

Recall that moving counters diagonally does not change the value,
so move all the counters on inner squares diagonally until they
hit either the bottom row or the left column.

Now we make the same moves we did for addition. Replace two counters on a square with one to its left. If the square is on the left column, replace two counters with one &quot;above&quot; it. Recall that the value of a square doubles if you move up, so this does not change the value on the grid.

Let&#x27;s first replace the two counters on the second square at the bottom with one to its left which leaves two counters at the corner.

Finally, replace the two counters on the corner with one above it
and &quot;read off&quot; the binary number in an L-shaped fashion, starting from
the top left down to the bottom left corner, and then over to the
bottom right.

Read the counters along the L but do not double count the corner square.
You will read the binary result 11000110 = 198 which is indeed 22*9.

Why can we read the binary number in this L-shaped fashion? The
bottom row is of course just the first six powers of two, but
notice that the leftmost column has the next five powers of
two. So we can directly read off an 11 digit binary number from
the L-shaped set of 11 squares that lie along the left and bottom
sides of the grid.

Our small 6x6 grid can only multiply numbers each up to 63, and in
general an &quot;n&quot;x&quot;n&quot; grid can multiply two numbers each up to
2&quot;n&quot;-1. This scales very fast, so board with 20 numbers per side, for
instance, can multiply numbers each up to a little over one million.

==Division==
Martin Gardner presented a slightly easier to understand
version of Napier&#x27;s division method, which is what is
shown here.

Division works pretty much the reverse of multiplication. Say we want
to divide 485 by 13. First place counters for 485 (= 111100101) along
the bottom edge and mark 13 (= 1101) along the right edge. To save
space, we&#x27;ll just look at a rectangular portion of the board because
that&#x27;s all we actually use.

Starting from the left, the game is to move counters diagonally into
&quot;columns of divisors&quot; (that is, with one counter on each row marked
with a 1 from the divisor.) Let&#x27;s demonstrate this with the leftmost
block of counters.

Now the next block of counters we might try would begin with the
leftmost counter on the bottom, and we might attempt something like

except that we do not have any counters that we can move diagonally from the bottom edge into squares that would form the rest of the &quot;column of divisors.&quot;

In such cases, we instead &quot;double down&quot; the counter on the bottom row and form a column one over to the right. As you will soon see, it will always be possible to form a column this way. So first replace the counter on the bottom with two to its right.

and then move one diagonally to the top of the column, and move
another counter located on the edge of the board into its spot.

It looks like we still do not have a counter on the bottom edge to move
diagonally into the remaining square, but notice that we can instead
double down the leftmost counter again and then move it into the
desired square.

and now move one counter diagonally to where we want it.

Let&#x27;s proceed to build the next column. Once again, notice that moving the leftmost counter to the top of the column does not leave enough counters at the bottom to fill in the remaining squares.

So we double down the counter and move one diagonally into the next column over. Let&#x27;s also move the rightmost counter into the column, and here is how it looks after these steps.

We still have a missing square, but we just double down again and move
the counter into this spot and end up with

At this point, the counter on the bottom edge is so far to the right
that it cannot go diagonally to the top of any column, which signals
that we are done.

The result is &quot;read&quot; off the columns—each column with counters is
treated as a 1 and empty columns are 0. So the result is
100101 (= 37) and the remainder is the binary value of any counters
still left along the bottom edge. There is one counter on the third
column from the right, so we read it as 100 (= 4) and we get 485
÷ 13 = 37 with a remainder 4.

<text>Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium (PDZA) is the only combined zoo and aquarium in the Pacific Northwest, located in Tacoma, Washington, US, owned by Metro Parks Tacoma. Situated on in Tacoma&#x27;s Point Defiance Park, the zoo and aquarium are home to over 9,000 specimens representing 367 animal species. The zoo was founded in 1905; the aquarium was founded in 1935 near Commencement Bay and relocated within the zoo in 1963. Both are accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. In Pierce County, Washington, this is said to be one of the most popular tourist destinations, bringing in over more than 600,000 visitors per year.

==History==
The Zoo was founded in 1905, and moved closer to its current location in 1914. The Point Defiance Park Aquarium opened on the waterfront in 1936 as an entity separate from the zoo.

By the late 1940s, several Zoo buildings were in disrepair and had to be rebuilt. The 36-year-old animal house was demolished and a new one with sandstone walls and 3/4-inch-thick viewing windows was built in its place. It housed some big cats and white-cheeked gibbons.

In the 1960s, the Point Defiance Park Aquarium had been incorporated into the Zoo. A new aquarium, now known as the North Pacific Aquarium, was built on Zoo grounds in 1963. The North Pacific Aquarium closed in 2018 with the opening of the Pacific Seas Aquarium.

By the end of the decade, a breeding program was begun for red wolves, which had been declared an endangered species in 1967.

Turn-of-the-century cages were deteriorating again in the early 1970s. After a $7 million bond measure was passed in 1977, the Zoo opened the Arctic Tundra complex in 1981 and the Rocky Shores area in 1982. With a smaller bond passed in 1986, the South Pacific Aquarium was built and then opened in 1989.

The Zoo experienced financial trouble in the 1990s, culminating in the probation of its AZA accreditation in 1999. Another bond, passed in that year, and a local sales tax increase shored up funds for improvements. With over $35 million at its disposal, the Zoo built a new animal hospital, an outdoor animal theater, an Asian Forest Sanctuary, much of the Kids&#x27; Zone children&#x27;s zoo, and a renovated entrance.

In 2008, an addition to Kids&#x27; Zone, Animal Avenue, was opened. The red wolf exhibit was renovated and re-opened in 2010, and a clouded leopard exhibit called Cats of the Canopy opened on August 27, 2011.

=== Beluga Whales ===
The zoo used to house beluga whales. A previous couple of belugas, Millie and Christy, died almost in unison in 2000. Mauyak was sent to Shedd Aquarium in 1997 for breeding, where she gave birth not only to Qannik but also to Miki.

In March 2009 one of the two belugas, Qannik, died of a blood infection. Beethoven, Qannik&#x27;s tankmate, was sent to SeaWorld, San Antonio, on 5 June 2009. Turner (Beethoven&#x27;s brother) died three years earlier on 7 September 2006 of chronic liver failure, which resulted in Qannik being brought to the zoo in June 2007, soon after Beethoven had recovered from a severe infection.

It&#x27;s unknown yet if there will be new belugas since Beethoven&#x27;s departure. None are scheduled to arrive any time in the foreseeable future and Rocky Shores currently (temporarily or permanently) houses harbor seals and California sea lions where belugas used to swim.

=== Zoolights ===
Since 1988, the zoo has hosted an annual holiday light display within the park called Zoolights. This event is usually held between November and January. There are more than 800,000 lights on display based on holiday and zoo animal themes. Visitors can purchase tickets to walk through the park at night and view the various lights.
==Exhibits==

The exhibits reflect the zoo&#x27;s theme of ecosystems from the Pacific rim: Southeast Asia, the Pacific Northwest, the tundra, and aquatic environments.
;Asian Forest Sanctuary
This 5 acre (2.0 ha) exhibit complex which opened on July 1, 2004 simulates the forests of southeast Asia with a waterfall, streams, and plants native to the region such as bamboo. The complex is designed so that species are rotated to different parts of the exhibit each day. Asian Forest Sanctuary includes Sumatran tigers, northern white-cheeked gibbons, siamangs, and formerly an Asian elephant named Suki that died in August 2024.

An expansion called &quot;Cats of the Canopy&quot; opened on August 27, 2011, and focuses on the clouded leopard. Viewing is provided by a wide glass window along a gravelly stream bed and into a heated den. The twenty-foot high enclosure also allows the cats to climb through the trees.

Kazu, an endangered male Malayan tapir, was born on July 12, 2019.

;Rocky Shores
Completed in 1982, this exhibit is based on the shoreline of Cape Flattery, Washington and serves as home to harbor seals, California sea lions, sea otters, horned puffins, common murres, and tufted puffins in separate pools. In the middle of the exhibit area is a building for underwater viewing. The exhibit formerly contained beluga whales until they were taken to a zoo in Texas in 2007. It also contains Pacific walruses Balzik and Lakina, half siblings from Aquarium du Quebec, born in 2016. The zoo&#x27;s previous two walruses Mitik and Pakak were shipped to another zoo where they had females.

;Arctic Tundra
1981 saw the opening of this exhibit area, which forms a semicircle at one end of the zoo. Muskoxen and reindeer are housed in a large meadow on the outside of the pathway&#x27;s arc, while Polar bears and Arctic fox live on the inside of the arc. The polar bears have an eleven-foot-deep pool with above- and underwater viewing.

;The Aquariums
There are two aquariums: the Pacific Seas Aquarium and South Pacific Aquarium. They each house species from different parts of the Pacific Ocean. In September 2018, the Pacific Seas Aquarium opened, replacing the North Pacific Aquarium that opened in 1963. The Pacific Seas Aquarium&#x27;s Baja Bay tank features scalloped hammerheads, spotted eagle rays and green sea turtles. Other highlights in the exhibit include a Puget sound tank, a kelp forest tank, a cold water invertebrate touch tank, jellyfish globe and kreisels, a schooling fish exhibit, a giant Pacific octopus, and Japanese spider crabs. The Pacific Seas Aquarium was built with the latest green life support system technology and includes a rainwater capture system for use in non potable water supplies.

The 1989-era South Pacific Aquarium simulated tropical Pacific environments, and in 2024 it reopened to the public as the Tropical Reef Aquarium. It features coral reef tanks, a lagoon exhibit, a blue hole exhibit, and a touch tank. The lagoon has small fish and eels, while the Outer Reef tank has nurse sharks, blacktip reef sharks, grey reef sharks, whitetip reef sharks, zebra sharks, and a tasselled wobbegong. In the touch tank are stingrays, epaulette sharks, and whitespotted bamboo sharks. As of 2024, shark dives at the Outer Reef Habitat are open to the public.

;Red Wolf Woods
The habitat was rebuilt in 2009 and opened again in the summer of 2010. The exhibit consists of two separate meadows with a rocky creek, hollow log, and other landscaping. The conservation center is designed to look like an abandoned farm building.

;Kids&#x27; Zone
A number of animals are present including Nigerian dwarf goats, and Parma Wallabies. There are also colorful play structures and a petting zoo with activities such as goat feeding present.

&quot;Animal Avenue&quot;, a children&#x27;s zoo expansion, allows people to meet a variety of species including meerkats, ring-tailed lemurs, and black and white ruffed lemurs.

Along with two other sections of the Kids&#x27; Zone &quot;Magical Movement&quot; and &quot;Contact Junction&quot;.

Botanical Garden

The certified Point Defiance Zoo Botanical Garden displays a collection of a variety of bamboos (over 50 species), massive meadows filled with Lobelia tupa, fragrant perennials to attract pollinators, and many varieties of trees and shrubs planted throughout the grounds. The collection boasts a variety of flora from the Baja Peninsula, the Southern Hemisphere, Alaskan landscape, plants from South Eastern United States, wildflowers, desert garden, Asian Forest Sanctuary, and the Native Northwest. The landscaping was developed in an effort to share how and why animals, plants, and people need to coexist. The Zoo is home to hundreds of varieties of plants from decorative to functional, and also provides botanical garden tours monthly by the Zoo Horticulturist.

;Other exhibits

Unincorporated exhibits include an artificial tide pool, a Magellanic penguin habitat, a seasonal budgie exhibit and Indian Peafowl which roam freely throughout the Zoo grounds. The zoo also formerly had Camel Rides but when they decided to build the Nature Play Garden, the Dromedary Camels moved back to their owners at a local farm.

==Conservation==
One focus of the zoo&#x27;s conservation work is the red wolf. Beginning in 1969, the zoo collected wild red wolves and successfully bred them for the first time in 1977. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had removed the last fourteen wolves from the wild by 1980, and in 1984 the zoo received approval from the AZA to start a Species Survival Plan. By 1987 the number of red wolves in captivity was large enough to release some of them back into the wild. Reintroduced wolves continue to survive and breed in the wild, and by 2002 the world population was 175 in captivity and about 100 in the wild. One of the biggest threats to the wild population is coyote-wolf hybridization.

A 2021 effort to breed endangered Sumatran tigers ended in the death of a six-year-old female tiger who was fatally wounded by her two-year-old potential mate. This was an attempt to save the endangered species considering there are roughly only four hundred Sumatran tigers left in the wild.

<doc id="1207136" wikidata="Q6872429" url="?curid=1207136" title="Miracle Monday">
<text>Miracle Monday is a novel written by Elliot S. Maggin, starring the DC Comics superhero Superman. It was published in 1981. A revised edition was published in 2017. This is Elliot S. Maggin&#x27;s second Superman novel, following &quot;&quot;. As with Maggin&#x27;s first novel, the original edition was published as a tie-in with the then-current Superman film series, with the first edition including a photograph of Christopher Reeve as the character; the novel is not, however, an adaptation of any of the films, nor does it take place in the same continuity as the movies.

&quot;Miracle Monday&quot; tells the story of Superman trying to stop an entity of pure evil from causing universal chaos. The story introduces the time traveler Kristin Wells. The character later appeared in the Superman comics, both as herself and as Superwoman. The novel introduces the holiday Miracle Monday, which occurs annually on the third Monday of May. The holiday would also make an appearance in the Superman comics and in the television series &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot; (S2E15).

==Plot summary==
In the story, Samael, the ruler of Hell, sends his greatest agent of evil, C. W. Saturn, to Earth, to destroy Superman morally. Saturn is able to enter our dimension thanks to Lex Luthor having used a form of magic to escape prison, leaving a &#x27;hole&#x27; between worlds. At the same time, Kristin Wells, a history graduate student from the far future, uses time travel technology to arrive in the present, for the purpose of finding out the origin of the holiday known as Miracle Monday, which is known only to be somehow connected to Superman. She infiltrates Clark Kent&#x27;s circle of friends by becoming Lois Lane&#x27;s assistant. To her dismay, because she does not belong in the present, Saturn is able to possess her. Saturn then proceeds to cause worldwide havoc, taunting Superman that the only way for him to stop it would be by killing its host—thus making him break his vow against killing. Saturn even reveals Superman&#x27;s secret identity to the world, to further drive him into desperation.

Ultimately, Superman refuses to kill Kristin, even if it means he would have to spend the rest of his life battling Saturn. At that moment, because of the rules that bind demons, Saturn is defeated, and forced to grant Superman a wish. He asks that everything that happened since Saturn&#x27;s arrival be undone, and it is granted, with Saturn then being banished back to Hell. However, a lingering memory of the events remained within the souls of humanity, causing them to begin celebrating the day every year, on the third Monday of May, starting the Miracle Monday tradition. Kristin then returns to the future to reveal this fact to the public.

==Impact==
Mark Waid has cited the ending of &quot;Miracle Monday&quot; as his favorite moment from a Superman story. Paul Kupperberg credited Maggin for writing the &quot;definitive&quot; comic book story about Man of Steel, and cited all three of his Superman novels as favorites. 

The ten-page story &quot;The Miracle Monday Dinner&quot; subsequently appeared in &quot;Superman&quot; #400 (1984). Kristin Wells debuted in the comics as Superwoman in &quot;DC Comics Presents Annual&quot; #2 (1983) and appeared again in &quot;DC Comics Presents Annual&quot; #4 (1985). She made a cameo appearance in &quot;Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?&quot;, the final Superman story by Alan Moore and Curt Swan.

In 2018, Maggin did an audiobook reading of the novel on his podcast, &quot;Elliot Makes Stuff Up&quot;. In 2022, the Miracle Monday holiday was referenced in an episode of &quot;Superman and Lois&quot;.

<doc id="1207150" wikidata="Q3857431" url="?curid=1207150" title="Mike Mularkey">
<text>Michael Rene Mularkey (born November 19, 1961) is an American former professional football coach and tight end in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Florida, and was selected by the San Francisco 49ers in the ninth round of the 1983 NFL draft and lasted until the final round of cuts. Mularkey then signed with the Minnesota Vikings with whom he played for six seasons before playing another three with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Mularkey has since served as the head coach of the Buffalo Bills, Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans, the offensive coordinator for the Steelers, Miami Dolphins and Atlanta Falcons, and the tight ends coach for the Dolphins, Titans, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Falcons.

==Early life==
Mularkey was born in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. He attended Northeast High School in Oakland Park, Florida, and played quarterback for the Northeast Hurricanes high school football team.

==College career==
Mularkey attended the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played tight end for coach Charley Pell&#x27;s Florida Gators football team from 1980 to 1982. Mularkey finished his college career with 55 receptions for 628 yards and three touchdowns.

==Professional career==
In 1983, Mularkey was a ninth-round draft pick for the San Francisco 49ers, but was released before appearing in a game. He went on to play with the Minnesota Vikings until the conclusion of the 1988 season. In 1989, Mularkey signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers as a free agent for the final three years of his playing career. In his nine NFL seasons, Mularkey played in 114 regular-season games, started 46 of them, and caught 102 passes for 1,222 yards and nine touchdowns.

===Career statistics===
==Coaching career==

===Concordia University-St. Paul, Minnesota===
Mularkey was given his first coaching position as an offensive/defensive line coach at Concordia University in St. Paul Minnesota for the 1993–94 season, working under head coach Tom Cross. Mularkey held the offensive/defensive lineman coaching position for one season.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
Mularkey started his NFL coaching career in 1994 with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as a quality control coach for both the offense and defense. In 1995, Mularkey was promoted to tight ends coach and held the position for one season.

===Pittsburgh Steelers===
Mularkey was hired as the Steelers&#x27; tight ends coach in 1996 and held the position until the end of the 2000 season, when he replaced Kevin Gilbride as the team&#x27;s offensive coordinator. Mularkey has a reputation for being an offense-oriented head coach with a penchant for trick plays. His skill for creating special packages to utilize multi-dimensional players such as Hines Ward and Antwaan Randle El earned Mularkey the nickname &quot;Inspector Gadget.&quot; For the 2001 season, Mularkey was named the Assistant Coach of the Year by Pro Football Writers of America.

===Buffalo Bills===
In 2004, Mularkey left the Steelers and was hired by the Buffalo Bills to succeed Gregg Williams as the team&#x27;s head coach. The Bills started the season with a record of 0–4, but rallied to a 9–7 record by the end of the season which was sparked by a six-game winning streak during which the Bills scored more points than in any other similar stretch in franchise history. However, a loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the regular-season finale kept the Bills out of the playoffs. Overall, they were seventh in the league in total offense. This would be the Bills&#x27; last winning season until 2014.

Mularkey&#x27;s second season in Buffalo was far less successful. Dogged by a quarterback controversy between J. P. Losman and Kelly Holcomb and a series of defensive personnel problems, Mularkey led the team to a 5–11 record and a sixth consecutive year out of the playoffs – the longest such active streak in the American Football Conference (AFC). Mularkey&#x27;s offensive schemes continued to be touted by then-general manager Tom Donahoe, despite the lack of production, finishing 24th in total offense.

On January 12, 2006, Mularkey resigned as head coach of the Bills, citing a disagreement in the direction of the organization, who had recently hired new management, including ex-coach Marv Levy.

===Miami Dolphins===
On January 22, 2006, Mularkey was hired to be the Miami Dolphins&#x27; offensive coordinator. As the offensive coordinator under Miami&#x27;s head coach, Nick Saban, Mularkey had an unsuccessful season with injuries to his first-string quarterback Daunte Culpepper and starting running back Ronnie Brown. The Dolphins only scored 16.3 points per game, ranking 29th in the NFL. Following the season, it was announced Saban had resigned as Dolphins head coach and he accepted the position of head coach of the Alabama Crimson Tide football team at the University of Alabama on January 3, 2007.

Upon the hiring of former San Diego Chargers offensive coordinator Cam Cameron as Dolphins head coach on January 19, 2007, it was announced that Mularkey would no longer serve as offensive coordinator but would remain with the team in another capacity. On March 15, it was officially announced that Cameron himself would call the offensive plays in 2007, leaving Mularkey to serve as tight ends coach.

===Atlanta Falcons (first stint)===
On January 25, 2008, it was announced that Mularkey would become the next offensive coordinator for the Atlanta Falcons.

In Mularkey&#x27;s first season in Atlanta, the Falcons finished with an 11–5 record and the offense rushed for 152.5 rushing yards per game, second most in the league. The Falcons also finished 10th in the NFL in scoring (up from 29th the previous year) with 24.4 points per game, and sixth in yards with 361.2 per game.

Following a 13–3 season in 2010, Mularkey was named the Offensive Coordinator of the Year by &quot;Sporting News&quot;. He interviewed with multiple NFL teams for their head coaching vacancies for 2011.

===Jacksonville Jaguars===
On January 11, 2012, Mularkey accepted the head coaching job for the Jacksonville Jaguars, making him the third full-time head coach in franchise history. His first win came in Week 3 against the Indianapolis Colts.

Mularkey led the team to a 2–14 record, which was the worst in franchise history up to that point, and was fired after only one season on January 10, 2013. He had two years remaining on a three-year contract. However, Jaguars general manager David Caldwell, who had been hired two days prior, decided that the Jaguars needed &quot;an immediate and clean restart&quot; after winning only seven games in the past two seasons.

===Tennessee Titans===
On January 22, 2014, the Tennessee Titans announced they hired Mularkey as their tight ends coach. He was given the title of assistant head coach the following season.

On November 3, 2015, the Titans relieved Ken Whisenhunt of head coaching duties and announced that Mularkey would step in as interim head coach for the rest of the season. He had a 2–7 record as interim head coach as the Titans finished with a league-worst 3–13 record.

On January 16, 2016, the Titans announced that they would retain Mularkey as their full-time head coach on a three-year contract in a highly criticized move by their fans and the media, who characterized the hire as &quot;uninspired&quot; and &quot;awful&quot;. Mularkey was given full control over his staff, and two days later, Mularkey hired former Atlanta Falcons wide receivers coach Terry Robiskie as the offensive coordinator and promoted assistant defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau to defensive coordinator. Mularkey stated that the Titans would run an &quot;exotic smashmouth&quot; offense in 2016, meaning that they would go run-heavy, like a 1970s offense.

After starting the season 1–3, the Titans beat the Cleveland Browns and Miami Dolphins to improve to 3–3. Thanks to a last-minute narrow Week 2 16–15 road victory over the Detroit Lions, a Week 10 47–25 blowout victory over the Green Bay Packers, and a game-winning 53-yard field goal to narrowly beat the Kansas City Chiefs on the road 19–17 in Week 15, the team came within just one game of earning an AFC South division title and a trip to the playoffs, ending with a 9–7 record, the first winning season for Tennessee since 2011. The Titans also sent five players to the Pro Bowl, their highest number since 2008.

In 2017, the Titans again finished with a 9–7 record, making the playoffs for the first time in nine years with a 15–10 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars in the regular-season finale. The Titans sent six players to the Pro Bowl. In the Wild Card Round, the Titans rallied from a 21–3 halftime deficit against the Kansas City Chiefs to narrowly win on the road by a score of 22–21; this was their first playoff victory since 2003.

After the Titans&#x27; 35–14 road loss to the New England Patriots in the Divisional Round the following week, Mularkey and the Titans agreed to part ways.

===Atlanta Falcons (second stint)===
After a year away from coaching, Mularkey was hired to be the Falcons&#x27; tight end coach on January 8, 2019.

<text>World War III is a miniseries that aired on the NBC television network on January 31, 1982.

==Plot==

The story begins in 1987. At the critical point of the Cold War, two US Air Force airmen monitor their radar screens at a quiet and remote NORAD facility in Alaska. Suddenly, one of the radar operators notices an unidentified aircraft sneaking in on the leading edge of a weather front. He alerts his partner about the threat and begins to contact Elmendorf AFB. The other Airman retrieves a silenced MAC-10 from his desk and kills him. He then proceeds to shoot the remaining station personnel while they are sleeping in their bunks. Lighting a cigarette, the traitor notifies Elmendorf that the station will be out of commission for the next hour to repair a malfunctioning generator. It is learned later that the traitor was a deep cover KGB operative who had been in the Air Force for 15 years. The necessary blind spot has been created in the radar for the plane to continue undetected into Alaska.

Out of the plane, the Soviets launch a secret incursion into Alaska. The Soviets have inserted a cold weather Spetsnaz assault force of approximately 35 to 40 KGB desant ski troops led by Soviet Colonel Alexander Vorashin (Jeroen Krabbé) into northern Alaska with a track-driven armored vehicle. Vorashin&#x27;s orders are to seize control of a strategically-located pumping station along the Trans-Alaska Pipeline to threaten the placement of floating explosive devices in the stream of oil and to destroy substantial portions of the pipeline. The operation is being conducted in response to the US grain embargo of the Soviet Union, just as the 1980 grain embargo was in response to the 1979 Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan. The governments of Canada, Australia, and Argentina have joined the US in the embargo, which has caused severe food shortages and domestic unrest inside the Soviet Union. A squad of 18 lightly-armed soldiers of the Alaska Army National Guard and Alaskan Scouts, which is on a training exercise, is discovered, ambushed, and killed by the Soviet invaders. At Fort Wainwright, Colonel Jake Caffey (David Soul), a combat veteran of the Vietnam War, is sent by his commanding officer to locate the soldiers, who are 24 hours late in reporting back from the training exercise. Caffey flies to the National Guard temporary patrol base to meet with the other half of the Guard company. Caffey goes out on a search mission and discovers one of the Alaskan Scouts still alive and learns of the Soviet incursion. Caffey then shadows the Soviet troops after notifying the Fort Wainwright commander, General Roberts. The general flies to the scene but is killed in a firefight. Caffey takes command of the Guardsmen and notifies the Pentagon by radio of the situation.

Upon learning of the situation, US President Thomas McKenna (Rock Hudson) orders Caffey&#x27;s National Guard troops to be federalized and orders Caffey to do all that he can to stop the Soviet troops. McKenna orders a media blackout on the emergency but then orders US forces to be mobilized in response to the Soviet incursion under the pretext of unscheduled training exercises. McKenna fears that the US people will demand a declaration of war against the Russians for the attack. Fierce winter weather prevents US military units from bases and forts in southern Alaska from reinforcing Caffey&#x27;s unit. Caffey deduces the Soviet assault unit&#x27;s goal. He uses the two US Army helicopters at his disposal to move his unit to a new pumping station ahead of the Soviets.

Meanwhile, Soviet Premier Gorny (Brian Keith) has learned that the Soviet military and KGB leadership have executed the plan without his permission. He is informed of the US mobilization and orders Soviet forces to a similar posture. In Alaska, Colonel Caffey realizes that his men have an inadequate supply of ammunition, grenades, and mines. Using combat tactics that he learned in Vietnam, Caffey sets up a defensive perimeter around the pumping station making use of surplus lengths of large-bore oil pipe to establish a position from which to ambush the enemy. The Soviet troops approach the pumping station, unaware of the American soldiers&#x27; presence until they trigger US land mines buried in the snow. The Soviets suffer casualties and fall back, but they continue to surround the buildings. McKenna and Gorny secretly meet in Iceland to negotiate an end to the crisis. They are unable to reach an agreement, and both return to their countries but promise each other that the talks will continue.

The US responds to the Soviets&#x27; continuing mobilizations, as officials recognize that they are consistent with a fictional contingency plan, Красный Флаг, or &quot;Red Flag.&quot; McKenna orders all American ballistic missile submarines, surface warships, B-1s, and B-52s to deploy in readiness for war. He directs US bombers to fly continuous paths just outside Soviet airspace. Caffey and his soldiers continue to repel the Soviet attacks on the pumping station in Alaska, but his soldiers are running low on ammunition and supplies. McKenna contacts Caffey by radio and asks him and his soldiers to hold out at all costs in the hope that the weather will break so that reinforcements can be sent to relieve them. Caffey obeys but hopes for a diplomatic solution. Gorny also hopes for a negotiated settlement to the crisis. However, hardline members of the Communist Party and the KGB, who remain incensed by the Soviet food shortage, suddenly launch a coup d&#x27;état. They use a car bomb to assassinate Gorny while he visits the school that is attended by his young son, Sasha.

In the meantime, the Soviet troops in Alaska launch a final assault on the pumping station. Soviet Colonel Vorashin, however, has become concerned about the rapidly-growing prospect of a nuclear war and requests a parley with Caffey. After an emotional conversation, Vorashin and Caffey agree to discontinue the fighting. However, at that moment, the Russian political officer, Major Nicolai Samaaretz, hurls a grenade, which kills both men.

The situation collapses in bloodshed, with a sergeant of the Alaskan Scouts managing to send one final message that the last US position is being overrun. Receiving the news, McKenna calls the Soviet leadership and discovers that Gorny is unavailable to speak with him. The Soviet leadership claims that Gorny has been felled by severe intestinal flu and that their forces will withdraw to pre-crisis positions, but McKenna does not believe them and realizes that pro-war elements of the KGB are seizing control of the Soviet Union. Once the telephone conference ends, McKenna submits to the National Security Council his belief that Gorny has been killed and that total war is imminent. He is correct since at that moment, the coup leaders decide on an all-out nuclear strike, some of them mistakenly believing that US law requires the President to obtain congressional approval before an American nuclear attack. However, McKenna has already deduced the enemy strategy. Horrified and nearly in tears, he concludes that the situation is unrecoverable and so orders a full nuclear counterstrike on the Soviet Union.

==Cold War themes==
The film focuses on a number of Cold War themes, including brinksmanship, political loyalty and the mutual distrust as both sides attempt to resolve the issue diplomatically while they escalate their military alert levels to force the other to back down.

==Cast==
The cast included Rock Hudson as the US president, Brian Keith as the Soviet premier, and Cathy Lee Crosby and David Soul as US military officers. It also included Jeroen Krabbé, Robert Prosky, Katherine Helmond and James Hampton.

==Production notes==
Robert L. Joseph wrote the miniseries.

The director, Boris Sagal, was killed in a helicopter accident in Oregon during the early stages of production. He was replaced by David Greene.

According to Rock Hudson and other sources, prior to Sagal&#x27;s death, the ending of the miniseries was left open-ended so that either a sequel miniseries or a full season series could be spun off if the first miniseries was a ratings success. However, it was not, and the miniseries concludes with the US releasing nuclear forces against the Soviets and vice versa since the Soviets feel that the US will not abandon the grain embargo. The miniseries ends with a photo montage that is rather similar to &quot;Fail-Safe&quot; of large groups of people across the globe in various international settings looking up to the skies. It includes the sound effects of missiles and jets escalate in tone and volume and concludes with a shot of a sunset and a quick cut to black.

==Novelization==

A novelization of the teleplay, which differs from the miniseries as aired in several key respects, was written by Harold King under the pen name Brian Harris. Its 1981 publication by Pocket Books anticipated the airing of the miniseries by several months. It is undocumented whether the changes were King&#x27;s, or whether they reflected an earlier draft of the script. Among the key differences (1) Gorny is not killed by the KGB but in the end does their bidding (2) the US forces actually beat back the Soviet attempted seizure of the pipeline but because of a loss of communications, the US and Soviet leaders never learn this.

<doc id="1207161" wikidata="Q844471" url="?curid=1207161" title="Ultrashort pulse">
<text>In optics, an ultrashort pulse, also known as an ultrafast event, is an electromagnetic pulse whose time duration is of the order of a picosecond (10−12 second) or less. Such pulses have a broadband optical spectrum, and can be created by mode-locked oscillators. Amplification of ultrashort pulses almost always requires the technique of chirped pulse amplification, in order to avoid damage to the gain medium of the amplifier.

They are characterized by a high peak intensity (or more correctly, irradiance) that usually leads to nonlinear interactions in various materials, including air. These processes are studied in the field of nonlinear optics.

In the specialized literature, &quot;ultrashort&quot; refers to the femtosecond (fs) and picosecond (ps) range, although such pulses no longer hold the record for the shortest pulses artificially generated. Indeed, x-ray pulses with durations on the attosecond time scale have been reported.

The 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Ahmed H. Zewail, for the use of ultrashort pulses to observe chemical reactions at the timescales on which they occur, opening up the field of femtochemistry.
A further Nobel prize, the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics, was also awarded for ultrashort pulses. This prize was awarded to Pierre Agostini, Ferenc Krausz, and Anne L&#x27;Huillier for the development of attosecond pulses and their ability to probe electron dynamics.

==Definition==

There is no standard definition of ultrashort pulse. Usually the attribute &#x27;ultrashort&#x27; applies to pulses with a duration of a few tens of femtoseconds, but in a larger sense any pulse which lasts less than a few picoseconds can be considered ultrashort. The distinction between &quot;Ultrashort&quot; and &quot;Ultrafast&quot; is necessary as the speed at which the pulse propagates is a function of the index of refraction of the medium through which it travels, whereas &quot;Ultrashort&quot; refers to the temporal width of the pulse wavepacket.

A common example is a chirped Gaussian pulse, a wave whose field amplitude follows a Gaussian envelope and whose instantaneous phase has a frequency sweep.

===Background===
The real electric field corresponding to an ultrashort pulse is oscillating at an angular frequency &quot;ω&quot;0 corresponding to the central wavelength of the pulse. To facilitate calculations, a complex field &quot;E&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is defined. Formally, it is defined as the analytic signal corresponding to the real field.

The central angular frequency &quot;ω&quot;0 is usually explicitly written in the complex field, which may be separated as a temporal intensity function &quot;I&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) and a temporal phase function &quot;ψ&quot;(&quot;t&quot;):

: formula_1

The expression of the complex electric field in the frequency domain is obtained from the Fourier transform of &quot;E&quot;(&quot;t&quot;):

: formula_2

Because of the presence of the formula_3 term, &quot;E&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;) is centered around &quot;ω&quot;0, and it is a common practice to refer to &quot;E&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;-&quot;ω&quot;0) by writing just &quot;E&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;), which we will do in the rest of this article.

Just as in the time domain, an intensity and a phase function can be defined in the frequency domain:

: formula_4

The quantity formula_5 is the &quot;power spectral density&quot; (or simply, the &quot;spectrum&quot;) of the pulse, and formula_6 is the &quot;phase spectral density&quot; (or simply &quot;spectral phase&quot;). Example of spectral phase functions include the case where formula_6 is a constant, in which case the pulse is called a bandwidth-limited pulse, or where formula_6 is a quadratic function, in which case the pulse is called a chirped pulse because of the presence of an instantaneous frequency sweep. Such a chirp may be acquired as a pulse propagates through materials (like glass) and is due to their dispersion. It results in a temporal broadening of the pulse.

The intensity functions—temporal formula_9 and spectral formula_5 —determine the time duration and spectrum bandwidth of the pulse. As stated by the uncertainty principle, their product (sometimes called the time-bandwidth product) has a lower bound. This minimum value depends on the definition used for the duration and on the shape of the pulse. For a given spectrum, the minimum time-bandwidth product, and therefore the shortest pulse, is obtained by a transform-limited pulse, i.e., for a constant spectral phase formula_6. High values of the time-bandwidth product, on the other hand, indicate a more complex pulse.

==Pulse shape control==
Although optical devices also used for continuous light, like beam expanders and spatial filters, may be used for ultrashort pulses, several optical devices have been specifically designed for ultrashort pulses. One of them is the pulse compressor, a device that can be used to control the spectral phase of ultrashort pulses. It is composed of a sequence of prisms, or gratings. When properly adjusted it can alter the spectral phase &quot;φ&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;) of the input pulse so that the output pulse is a bandwidth-limited pulse with the shortest possible duration. A pulse shaper can be used to make more complicated alterations on both the phase and the amplitude of ultrashort pulses.

To accurately control the pulse, a full characterization of the pulse spectral phase is a must in order to get certain pulse spectral phase (such as transform-limited). Then, a spatial light modulator can be used in the 4f plane to control the pulse. Multiphoton intrapulse interference phase scan (MIIPS) is a technique based on this concept. Through the phase scan of the spatial light modulator, MIIPS can not only characterize but also manipulate the ultrashort pulse to get the needed pulse shape at target spot (such as transform-limited pulse for optimized peak power, and other specific pulse shapes). If the pulse shaper is fully calibrated, this technique allows controlling the spectral phase of ultrashort pulses using a simple optical setup with no moving parts. However the accuracy of MIIPS is somewhat limited with respect to other techniques, such as frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG).

==Measurement techniques==
Several techniques are available to measure ultrashort optical pulses.

Intensity autocorrelation gives the pulse width when a particular pulse shape is assumed.

Spectral interferometry (SI) is a linear technique that can be used when a pre-characterized reference pulse is available. It gives the intensity and phase. The algorithm that extracts the intensity and phase from the SI signal is direct. Spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction (SPIDER) is a nonlinear self-referencing technique based on spectral shearing interferometry. The method is similar to SI, except that the reference pulse is a spectrally shifted replica of itself, allowing one to obtain the spectral intensity and phase of the probe pulse via a direct FFT filtering routine similar to SI, but which requires integration of the phase extracted from the interferogram to obtain the probe pulse phase.

Frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) is a nonlinear technique that yields the intensity and phase of a pulse. It is a spectrally resolved autocorrelation. The algorithm that extracts the intensity and phase from a FROG trace is iterative. Grating-eliminated no-nonsense observation of ultrafast incident laser light e-fields (GRENOUILLE) is a simplified version of FROG. (&quot;Grenouille&quot; is French for &quot;frog&quot;.)

Chirp scan is a technique similar to MIIPS which measures the spectral phase of a pulse by applying a ramp of quadratic spectral phases and measuring second harmonic spectra. With respect to MIIPS, which requires many iterations to measure the spectral phase, only two chirp scans are needed to retrieve both the amplitude and the phase of the pulse.

Multiphoton intrapulse interference phase scan (MIIPS) is a method to characterize and manipulate the ultrashort pulse.

==Wave packet propagation in nonisotropic media==
To partially reiterate the discussion above, the slowly varying envelope approximation (SVEA) of the electric field of a wave with central wave vector formula_12 and central frequency formula_13 of the pulse, is given by:
:formula_14
We consider the propagation for the SVEA of the electric field in a homogeneous dispersive nonisotropic medium. Assuming the pulse is propagating in the direction of the z-axis, it can be shown that the envelope formula_15 for one of the most general of cases, namely a biaxial crystal, is governed by the PDE:
:formula_16
::formula_17
where the coefficients contains diffraction and dispersion effects which have been determined analytically with computer algebra and verified numerically to within third order for both isotropic and non-isotropic media, valid in the near-field and far-field.
formula_18 is the inverse of the group velocity projection. The term in formula_19 is the group velocity dispersion (GVD) or second-order dispersion; it increases the pulse duration and chirps the pulse as it propagates through the medium. The term in formula_20 is a third-order dispersion term that can further increase the pulse duration, even if formula_19 vanishes. The terms in formula_22 and formula_23 describe the walk-off of the pulse; the coefficient formula_24 is the ratio of the component of the group velocity formula_25 and the unit vector in the direction of propagation of the pulse (z-axis). The terms in formula_26 and formula_27 describe diffraction of the optical wave packet in the directions perpendicular to the axis of propagation. The terms in formula_28 and formula_29 containing mixed derivatives in time and space rotate the wave packet about the formula_30 and formula_31 axes, respectively, increase the temporal width of the wave packet (in addition to the increase due to the GVD), increase the dispersion in the formula_31 and formula_30 directions, respectively, and increase the chirp (in addition to that due to formula_19) when the latter and/or formula_35 and formula_27 are nonvanishing. The term formula_37 rotates the wave packet in the formula_38 plane. Oddly enough, because of previously incomplete expansions, this rotation of the pulse was not realized until the late 1990s but it has been &quot;experimentally&quot; confirmed. To third order, the RHS of the above equation is found to have these additional terms for the uniaxial crystal case:
::formula_39
The first and second terms are responsible for the curvature of the propagating front of the pulse. These terms, including the term in formula_40 are present in an isotropic medium and account for the spherical surface of a propagating front originating from a point source. The term formula_41 can be expressed in terms of the index of refraction, the frequency formula_42 and derivatives thereof and the term formula_43 also distorts the pulse but in a fashion that reverses the roles of formula_44 and formula_45 (see reference of Trippenbach, Scott and Band for details).
So far, the treatment herein is linear, but nonlinear dispersive terms are ubiquitous to nature. Studies involving an additional nonlinear term formula_46 have shown that such terms have a profound effect on wave packet, including amongst other things, a &quot;self-steepening&quot; of the wave packet. The non-linear aspects eventually lead to optical solitons.

Despite being rather common, the SVEA is not required to formulate a simple wave equation describing the propagation of optical pulses.
In fact, as shown in, even a very general form of the electromagnetic second order wave equation can be factorized into directional components, providing access to a single first order wave equation for the field itself, rather than an envelope. This requires only an assumption that the field evolution is slow on the scale of a wavelength, and does not restrict the bandwidth of the pulse at all—as demonstrated vividly by.

==High harmonics==
High energy ultrashort pulses can be generated through high harmonic generation in a nonlinear medium. A high intensity ultrashort pulse will generate an array of harmonics in the medium; a particular harmonic of interest is then selected with a monochromator. This technique has been used to produce ultrashort pulses in the extreme ultraviolet and soft-X-ray regimes from near infrared Ti-sapphire laser pulses.

==Applications==

===Advanced material 3D micro-/nano-processing===
The ability of femtosecond lasers to efficiently fabricate complex structures and devices for a wide variety of applications has been extensively studied during the last decade. State-of-the-art laser processing techniques with ultrashort light pulses can be used to structure materials with a sub-micrometer resolution. Direct laser writing (DLW) of suitable photoresists and other transparent media can create intricate three-dimensional photonic crystals (PhC), micro-optical components, gratings, tissue engineering (TE) scaffolds and optical waveguides. Such structures are potentially useful for empowering next-generation applications in telecommunications and bioengineering that rely on the creation of increasingly sophisticated miniature parts. The precision, fabrication speed and versatility of ultrafast laser processing make it well placed to become a vital industrial tool for manufacturing.
===Micro-machining===
Among the applications of femtosecond laser, the microtexturization of implant surfaces have been experimented for the enhancement of the bone formation around zirconia dental implants. The technique demonstrated to be precise with a very low thermal damage and with the reduction of the surface contaminants. Posterior animal studies demonstrated that the increase on the oxygen layer and the micro and nanofeatures created by the microtexturing with femtosecond laser resulted in higher rates of bone formation, higher bone density and improved mechanical stability.

=== Multiphoton Polymerization ===
Multiphoton Polymerization (MPP) stands out for its ability to fabricate micro- and nano-scale structures with exceptional precision. This process leverages the concentrated power of femtosecond lasers to initiate highly controlled photopolymerization reactions, crafting detailed three-dimensional constructs. These capabilities make MPP essential in creating complex geometries for biomedical applications, including tissue engineering and micro-device fabrication, highlighting the versatility and precision of ultrashort pulse lasers in advanced manufacturing processes.

<text>Epilepsia partialis continua is a rare type of brain disorder in which a patient experiences recurrent motor epileptic seizures that are focal (hands and face), and recur every few seconds or minutes for extended periods (days to years). It is sometimes called Kozhevnikov&#x27;s epilepsia named after Russian psychiatrist Aleksei Yakovlevich Kozhevnikov who first described this type of epilepsy.

==Signs and symptoms==
During these seizures, there is repetitive focal myoclonus or Jacksonian march.
After a seizure has subsided, Todd&#x27;s phenomenon may be observed, which includes weakness.

==Causes==
There are numerous causes for this kind of seizure and they differ depending somewhat on the age at which the seizures begin. Epilepsy most often occurs at the extremes of life – in childhood or in very old age – but can develop at any time throughout one&#x27;s life.

Although these seizures are usually due to large, acute brain lesions resulting from strokes in adults and focal cortical inflammatory processes in children (Rasmussen&#x27;s encephalitis), possibly caused by chronic viral infections, edema, or autoimmune processes.

They are very medication and therapy-resistant, and the primary therapeutic goal is to stop secondary generalization. There are also many other reasons why these seizures occur. For example, they could be due to genetics, infections, or problems with brain development. Commonly the cause is unknown.

An infection of the brain (encephalitis) can also be a contributing factor. Although this sort of infection is uncommon it can be due to a virus, bacterium, or (very rarely) fungus. If a seizure happens during the infection itself, the person most likely does not have epilepsy but has &quot;symptomatic seizures&quot; or seizures occurring because of a known injury to the brain. Once the infection is stopped the seizures will stop. Another more common infection is &quot;meningitis&quot;, infection of the membranes surrounding the brain. Since this infection does not directly involve the brain it might not appear as a possible cause of epilepsy, but has been shown that meningitis can cause epilepsy, which would give rise to the possibility of developing epilepsy partialis continua. These infections are most likely to result in epilepsy when they occur at an early age.

Problems with brain development can also be a factor. The brain undergoes a complicated process during development in which neurons are born and must travel to the surface of the brain. Here they wind up carefully placed in six distinct layers of the cerebral cortex. Throughout the brain, the placement of these neurons is normally quite precise. If this system does not work exactly right, neurons can develop outside their appropriate areas. If this happens then the firing or circuitry of the brain is not right, and an abnormal, epileptic circuit can result.

==Treatment==
Identification of the underlying cause plays an important role in treatment. Brain abscesses or tumors can be—at least temporarily or partially, if not fully and permanently—surgically treated and chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is given to the patient. If seizures do continue, various anticonvulsant medication regimens that can be tolerated by the patient can be tested and if need be, administered, either orally, or in emergency conditions such as status epilepticus after tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures, intravenously. If stroke or other similar, transient disorders occur (cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischemic attack, TIA), then neurological imaging of the affected lobes or hemispheres of the brain can be performed (CT, MRI, PET, etc.) and, if not absolutely contraindicated, antithrombolytic therapy might be given if it can be tolerated due to the seizures; if a hemorrhagic stroke has occurred and surgery can be performed to cauterize the vessel or otherwise stop the bleeding, it will be attempted if it can be done safely.

<text>Sequencer, released in May 1996, is the second album by the Swedish musical group Covenant. In March 1997, a second edition by the name &quot;Sequencer: Beta&quot; was released, containing an additional track.

In the US, the album was released in 1997 on the 21st Circuitry label, and again in July 1999 on Metropolis Records. These releases both combine the original Sequencer album (minus &quot;Luminal&quot;), with the &quot;Stalker&quot; CD single, separated by an extra half-minute of silence after &quot;Flux&quot;.

The first pressing on the Off Beat label had a mastering error in &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;. 250 discs were pressed before they stopped the production, and only 100 reached the record stores. They are now rare collectors&#x27; items and can be identified by the orange cover art (while the art on the corrected Off Beat release is purple), the label Off Beat (as opposed to Metropolis Records), and a loud crack in the song &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;.

<doc id="1207185" wikidata="Q6815500" url="?curid=1207185" title="Memorial Quadrangle">
<text>The Memorial Quadrangle is a residential quadrangle at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Commissioned in 1917 to supply much-needed student housing for Yale College, it was Yale&#x27;s first Collegiate Gothic building and its first project by James Gamble Rogers, who later designed ten other major buildings for the university. The Quadrangle has been occupied by Saybrook College and Branford College, two of the original ten residential colleges at Yale. The collegiate system of Yale University was largely inspired by the Oxbridge model of residential and teaching colleges at the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in the UK.

The building was donated by Anna M. Harkness to memorialize her son, Yale College graduate Charles W. Harkness, who died in 1916. Charles&#x27; brother, Edward Harkness, became the primary benefactor of Yale&#x27;s residential college system fifteen years later, a scheme which required a partial reconfiguration of the Memorial Quadrangle to create its two residential colleges. Harkness Tower, a large masonry tower on the building&#x27;s west side, was named in memory of Charles Harkness, a memorial to whom is found in the tower&#x27;s chapel.

==Building==
Construction began in 1917, the bicentennial of Yale&#x27;s first building in New Haven, and was completed in 1921. As initially built, the Quadrangle contained dorm rooms for 630 students, a dining hall, and seven courtyards. Dry moats with low walls, a frequent architectural motif at Yale, were first used by this building and were planted with ivy, flowers, and trees by landscape architect Beatrix Jones Farrand with an eye to both increased privacy and street beautification.

Harkness Tower, the most visible symbol of Yale on the New Haven skyscape, is placed on an axis unifying it with Yale&#x27;s Old Campus. The shorter Wrexham Tower is modeled on the tower of St Giles&#x27; Church in Wrexham, Wales, where Elihu Yale is buried.

The building is divided into seven courtyards, which Rogers framed with materials and decorative elements giving each distinct character. Three—Killingworth Court, Saybrook Court, and the largest, Branford Court—commemorate Connecticut towns significant to the school&#x27;s founding, and a fourth, Wrexham Court, commemorating the city of Wrexham in Wales, the resting place of Elihu Yale. The other three, on the building&#x27;s southern side and now part of Branford College, are named for early debating societies in Yale College: Brothers in Unity Court, Linonia Court, and Calliope Court after the Calliopean Society. Walls around these southward courtyards are several stories shorter than those on the north, allowing light to fill all of the quadrangle&#x27;s open spaces more evenly.

The building&#x27;s masonry exterior is richly ornamented, and much of the decoration commemorates distinguished university graduates. The gate beneath Harkness Tower, crafted by Samuel Yellin, is the most ornate of his many works at Yale. G. Owen Bonawit designed unique stained glass windowpanes for each student room.

==Residential college integration==

From 1921 to 1929 the building housed Yale College seniors. In 1928, a donation from Edward Harkness began Yale&#x27;s residential college system, the buildings of which were also planned and designed by Rogers. Rogers split the Quadrangle into two residential colleges—Saybrook and Branford, so named for the courtyards they contain—and added mid-sized elements such as masters&#x27; houses, fellow&#x27;s quarters, and dining halls. During the conversion, the &quot;Gold Coast&quot; of student rooms in the middle of the Quadrangle was hollowed out to make way for the Saybrook College dining hall. The colleges opened on September 25, 1933.

==Influence==
The Memorial Quadrangle became the template for Yale&#x27;s residential college system. First announced as a &quot;Quadrangle Plan,&quot; the colleges were built around the same courtyard and dining hall design pioneered. In addition to the two colleges that were created within the Memorial Quadrangle, six others—Jonathan Edwards, Davenport, Calhoun, Trumbull, and Berkeley—followed the same Collegiate Gothic style. Because of his initial work on the Memorial Quadrangle, Rogers became the de facto architect of Yale&#x27;s central campus through the 1920s and 1930s: eight of the ten early residential colleges were his design, as were Sterling Memorial Library, Sterling Law Building, and the Hall of Graduate Studies. Many of the artisans who worked on the Memorial Quadrangle with Rogers, including G. Owen Bonawit and blacksmith Samuel Yellin, were commissioned again for these later buildings.

The quadrangle was an antecedent of the Collegiate Gothic style used throughout the United States, and of large residential campuses of the 20th century, including Harvard College and Rice University. In particular, plans for creating a residential undergraduate campus at the University of Chicago made heavy reference to the Memorial Quadrangle.

<text>Elaine Cafferty Carbines (born 4 February 1957) is an Australian former politician. She was a member of the Labor Party and represented Geelong Province in the Victorian Legislative Council from September 1999 to November 2006.

==Early life==
Carbines was born in Manchester, England, but moved to Australia in 1968 after completing her elementary schooling. She received her secondary education at Mitcham High School, and studied teaching (BA 1978, Dip Ed 1979) at Monash University. It was at university where she joined the Labor Party, in response to the controversial dismissal of Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam by Governor-General John Kerr. After graduating, she worked as a secondary school teacher, mostly in underprivileged areas for the next twenty years.

In 1988, she gained a Diploma of Humanities from La Trobe University.

==Political life==
Throughout her working life, Carbines remained active in politics, having been a party member since university. She was the secretary of Labor&#x27;s Belmont branch in 1994, and of the Portarlington branch from 1995 to 1997. In 1996, she made an unsuccessful bid for the seat of Bellarine in the Legislative Assembly. She was a delegate to the party&#x27;s state conference, representing the federal electorate of Corangamite, from 1995 to 2009.

Carbines was also actively involved in several environmental campaigns, most notably the attempt to stop the move of the Coode Island chemical plant to the environmentally sensitive Point Lillias, and a proposal to build a rowing course on the site of the Belmont Common, another environmentally sensitive area on the outskirts of Geelong. When Carbines won Labor pre-selection to make a second run for office - this time for the Legislative Council seat of Geelong Province in the lead-up to the 1999 state election, the campaign against both developments became a key part of her platform. On election day, she received a swing of nearly five percent, and defeated sitting Liberal member Bill Hartigan on preferences.

Carbines was a member of the Road Safety and Library Committees in her first three years in office. She also led the Live Music Taskforce, which attempted to solve issues related to live music venues in Melbourne perceived to be under threat due to noise complaints and development. In March 2002, in the leadup to the election due later that year, she was made Parliamentary Secretary for Education and Training. In December that year, after Labor&#x27;s election victory, she was instead made Parliamentary Secretary for the Environment.

Carbines was a vocal advocate on issues of broader social significance, such as the treatment of refugees, recognition of the Australian Aboriginal flag and the issue of Tibetan independence movement. As a member of the Parliamentary Friends of Tibet Group, Carbines was among those who put their names to an advertisement taken out by the Australia-Tibet Council during a visit to Australia by Chinese President Hu Jintao in 2003.

Rumours began circulating as early as 2004 that Carbines would face a challenge to her preselection for the 2006 state election due to factional manoeuvring, with local media reporting in October 2005 that she was facing the prospect of being placed in an unwinnable position on the Labor Party&#x27;s ticket for the newly created Western Victoria Region. Carbines lost her seat to Peter Kavanagh of the Democratic Labor Party after a recount.

== Post politics ==
After politics, Carbines became the CEO of the G21 Geelong Regional Alliance from 2010 to 2020. Currently, she is the Deputy Chair of Ports Victoria, G-Force Recruitment and Barwon Water and a Director of Northern Futures and AWA Alliance Bank.

In the 2020 Australia Day Honours Carbines was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia, recognising her service to conservation and the environment.

==Personal life==
She is married to Shane Carbines, a former umpire and senior official with the Geelong Football Umpires League. She is the stepmother of Anthony Carbines, a current sitting member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly.

<text>Boris is a tiny lunar impact crater that is located on the Mare Imbrium, to the northeast of the crater Delisle. It lies near the southwest extremity of a sinuous rille that is designated Rima Delisle. This rille meanders to the northeast, towards the crater Heis, before vanishing into the lunar mare. The name &quot;Boris&quot; is a common Russian male given name; the crater is not named after a specific person.

<text>Branford College is one of the 14 residential colleges at Yale University.

==Founding==

Branford College was founded in 1933 by partitioning the Memorial Quadrangle (built in 1917-21) into two parts: Saybrook and Branford with Branford being the largest part. In the start of the academic year in 1933, Branford College opened its doors. Clarence Whittlesey Mendell, Dean of Yale College, had been named Master in 1931 and he held the post until 1943. What impressed quite a few visitors to Branford was the calm and subdued character of the College. Chauncey Tinker commented that Saybrook was like an anthill, but Branford was like an oyster bed. In records of the time, the main thing that stands out about Branford is the activity among its students, and of encouragement of activity on the part of Master Mendell, who commented that oyster beds produce pearls.

Branford College was named for the nearby town of Branford, Connecticut, where Yale was briefly located. The base of Harkness Tower, one of the university&#x27;s most prominent structures and one of the tallest free-standing stone structures in the world, forms one corner of Branford&#x27;s main courtyard. The tower contains a 54-bell carillon. Frank Lloyd Wright is said to have been asked where he would choose to be if he could be anywhere in the U.S. and responded that he would pick Harkness Tower so he would not have to look at it. Since Branford&#x27;s courtyards have many squirrels, the college adopted the squirrel as its mascot.
The college has a longstanding rivalry with neighboring Jonathan Edwards College as well as a less formal one with Saybrook, both of which frequently attempt to steal Branford&#x27;s college flag. Branford is the sister college of Quincy House at Harvard, Pembroke College at Oxford and Christ&#x27;s College at Cambridge. It is tradition for Branfordians to host members of Quincy House when Yale hosts Harvard during The Game.

==Facilities==

There are two &quot;common rooms&quot; in addition to the primary common room (located underneath the Dining Hall). Located between Linonia and Branford Courts is the Fellows&#x27; Lounge, where the Fellows of the College meet. This room is called the Trumbull Room, in memory of the first art gallery at Yale, which was built to house the paintings of John Trumbull.

The Branford Dining Hall is located above the common room parallel to York Street. The large, vaulted main dining hall contains a 15th-century Burgundian fireplace. A smaller, cozier room traditionally called The Pit, also known as the Small Dining Hall, is frequently reserved by student groups for dinner meetings.

The other &quot;Common Room&quot; is the Mendell Room, named for Branford&#x27;s first master, Clarence Whittlesey Mendell. Confusingly, this room also had several other names. It was originally dubbed the &quot;Cabinet Commons&quot; when it was constructed. It quickly came to be known as the &quot;Ship Room&quot; after the carving over the mantle, which depicts the phantom &quot;Great Ship&quot; lost at sea off the coast of New Haven. During the early days of the College, it was used as a &quot;Music Room,&quot; and a record player was installed for the use of College students. It was only after the death of Master Mendell that the room was renamed in his honor. The room, which is located between the Branford and Brothers in Unity Courts (joined by the Jared Eliot gateway) is used for seminars and meetings of small student organizations.
The Branford College Library is located in the middle courtyard of Branford College, named Calliope Court. The student rooms and common areas are decorated with stained glass by G. Owen Bonawit. Branford&#x27;s architect, James Gamble Rogers, required that at least one pane on every window be broken and then soldered back together, resulting in a Y-shape in many of the windows.

The student-led committee, Branford College Council (BCC), coordinates events around Branford College.

The basement of the College houses the College&#x27;s student-run buttery, a computer cluster, a small weight room, two squash courts, a dance studio, a basketball court, a digital media center, a game room, a student kitchen, a pottery studio, a printing press, and laundry facilities. The basement was remodeled just more than a decade ago, with the rest of the college. 
First-year Branfordians live in entryways A through C of Vanderbilt Hall on Old Campus and share the building with the first-year students of Saybrook College, who live in entryways D through F of the same building. The college was renovated in 2000 as part of the University&#x27;s renovation of all the residential colleges.

<doc id="1207205" wikidata="Q839494" url="?curid=1207205" title="Carnauba wax">
<text>Carnauba (; ), also called Brazil wax and palm wax, is a wax of the leaves of the carnauba palm &quot;Copernicia prunifera&quot; (synonym: &quot;Copernicia cerifera&quot;), a plant native to and grown only in the northeastern Brazilian states of Ceará, Piauí, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte, Maranhão and Bahia. It is known as the &quot;Queen of Waxes&quot;. In its pure state, it is usually available in the form of hard yellow-brown flakes. It is obtained by collecting and drying the leaves, beating them to loosen the wax, then refining and bleaching it.
As a food additive, its E number is E903.

==Composition==

Carnauba consists mostly of aliphatic esters (40 wt%), diesters of 4-hydroxycinnamic acid (21.0 wt%), ω-hydroxycarboxylic acids (13.0 wt%), and fatty alcohols (12 wt%). The compounds are predominantly derived from acids and alcohols in the C26-C30 range. It is distinctive for its high content of diesters and its methoxycinnamic acid.

It is sold in grades of T1, T3 and T4 according to its purity level, which is accomplished by filtration, centrifugation and bleaching.

==Properties==
As it creates a glossy finish, carnauba wax is used in automobile waxes, shoe polishes, dental floss, food products (such as sweets), polishes for musical instruments, and floor and furniture waxes and polishes. It is commonly used for paper coatings in the United States. It is also used in some surfboard waxes.

Due to its hypoallergenic and emollient properties as well as its gloss, carnauba wax is used as a thickener in cosmetics such as lipstick, eyeliner, mascara, eye shadow, foundation, deodorant, and skincare and sun care preparations. 

It is also used to make cutler&#x27;s resin for attaching handles to bladed tools and weapons.

It is the finish of choice for most briar tobacco smoking pipes.

Although too brittle to be used alone, carnauba wax is often combined with other waxes (principally beeswax) to treat and waterproof leather products, where it provides a high-gloss finish and increases leather&#x27;s hardness and durability.

It is also used in the pharmaceutical industry as a coating to make tablets easier to swallow. A very small amount (less than 1/100 of 1% by weight, e.g. 30 grams per 300 kg) is sprinkled onto a batch of sprayed and dried tablets then tumbled for a few minutes to coat them. 

In 1890 carnauba wax was patented as a replacement for the standard paraffin/beeswax mixture used in phonograph cylinders.

Carnauba wax may be used as a mold release agent for manufacturing fibre-reinforced plastics. An aerosol form is made by dissolving it in a solvent. Unlike silicone or PTFE, carnauba is suitable for use with liquid epoxy, epoxy molding compounds (EMC), and some other plastic types. It is not very soluble in chlorinated or aromatic hydrocarbons.

It is used in melt/castable explosives to produce an insensitive explosive formula such as Composition B, which is a blend of RDX and TNT.

==Production and export==
In 2006, Brazil produced 22,409 tons of carnauba wax, of which 14% was solid and 86% was in powder form.
There are 20 to 25 exporters of carnauba wax in Brazil who, after buying it from middlemen or directly from farmers, refine the wax before shipping it to the rest of the world. 
The four largest exporters are Pontes, Brasil Ceras, Foncepi, and Carnauba do Brasil, who together account for around €25 million of the export market. According to the German television program &quot;Markencheck&quot;, conditions for many carnauba production workers are quite poor; one Brazilian Labor Ministry official found conditions &quot;that could be described as slavery.&quot;

According to the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade, the major destinations for exported carnauba wax are:
* United States (25%)
* Japan (15–25%)
* Germany (10–15%)
* Netherlands (5%)
* Italy (5%)
* Other countries (18%)
The Initiative for Responsible Carnauba (IRC) was founded in 2018 as part of the Private Business Action for Biodiversity project, in association with the Union for Ethical BioTrade (UEBT). Its aim is to foster responsible production that respects workers’ rights and preserves biodiversity. In an established working group with 20 local manufacturers and international distributors and brands, the IRC has set social, traceability and biodiversity standards and helped local producers implement them, with the UEBT&#x27;s support. In collaboration with the local NGO Associação Caatinga, the Initiative has created a manual of good practices for the sector and 12 short learning videos, available on YouTube and sharable via WhatsApp, to inform field workers of their rights and about good biodiversity practices.

==Technical characteristics==

*INCI name: &quot;Copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax&quot;
*Melting point: (among the highest of natural waxes; higher than beeswax, )
*Relative density: ~0.97
*Among the hardest of natural waxes
*Practically insoluble in water or ethyl alcohol
*Soluble by heating in ethyl acetate or xylene

<doc id="1207207" wikidata="Q250624" url="?curid=1207207" title="Little–Parks effect">
<text>In condensed matter physics, the Little–Parks effect was discovered in 1962 by William A. Little and Ronald D. Parks in experiments with empty and thin-walled superconducting cylinders subjected to a parallel magnetic field. It was one of the first experiments to indicate the importance of Cooper-pairing principle in BCS theory.

The essence of the Little–Parks effect is slight suppression of the cylinder&#x27;s superconductivity by persistent current.

==Explanation==
The electrical resistance of such cylinders shows a periodic oscillation with the magnetic flux piercing the cylinder, the period being

formula_1

where is the Planck constant and is the elementary charge. The explanation provided by Little and Parks is that the resistance oscillation reflects a more fundamental phenomenon, i.e. periodic oscillation of the superconducting critical temperature .

The Little–Parks effect consists in a periodic variation of the with the magnetic flux, which is the product of the magnetic field (coaxial) and the cross sectional area of the cylinder. depends on the kinetic energy of the superconducting electrons. More precisely, the is such temperature at which the free energies of normal and superconducting electrons are equal, for a given magnetic field. To understand the periodic oscillation of the , which constitutes the Little–Parks effect, one needs to understand the periodic variation of the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy oscillates because the applied magnetic flux increases the kinetic energy while superconducting vortices, periodically entering the cylinder, compensate for the flux effect and reduce the kinetic energy. Thus, the periodic oscillation of the kinetic energy and the related periodic oscillation of the critical temperature occur together.

The Little–Parks effect is a result of collective quantum behavior of superconducting electrons. It reflects the general fact that it is the fluxoid rather than the flux which is quantized in superconductors.

The Little–Parks effect can be seen as a result of the requirement that quantum physics be invariant with respect to the gauge choice for the electromagnetic potential, of which the magnetic vector potential forms part.

Electromagnetic theory implies that a particle with electric charge travelling along some path in a region with zero magnetic field , but non-zero (by formula_2), acquires a phase shift , given in SI units by

formula_3

In a superconductor, the electrons form a quantum superconducting condensate, called a Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) condensate. In the BCS condensate all electrons behave coherently, i.e. as one particle. Thus the phase of the collective BCS wavefunction behaves under the influence of the vector potential in the same way as the phase of a single electron. Therefore, the BCS condensate flowing around a closed path in a multiply connected superconducting sample acquires a phase difference determined by the magnetic flux through the area enclosed by the path (via Stokes&#x27; theorem and formula_4), and given by:

formula_5

This phase effect is responsible for the quantized-flux requirement and the Little–Parks effect in superconducting loops and empty cylinders. The quantization occurs because the superconducting wave function must be single valued in a loop or an empty superconducting cylinder: its phase difference around a closed loop must be an integer multiple of , with the charge for the BCS electronic superconducting pairs.

If the period of the Little–Parks oscillations is 2π with respect to the superconducting phase variable, from the formula above it follows that the period with respect to the magnetic flux is the same as the magnetic flux quantum, namely

formula_6

==Applications==
Little–Parks oscillations are a widely used proof mechanism of Cooper pairing. One of good example is the study of the Superconductor Insulator Transition.

The challenge here is to separate Little–Parks oscillations from weak (anti-)localization, as in Altshuler et al. results, where authors observed the Aharonov–Bohm effect in a dirty metallic film.

==History==
Fritz London predicted that the fluxoid is quantized in a multiply connected superconductor. Experimentally has been shown, that the trapped magnetic flux existed only in discrete quantum units &quot;h&quot;/2&quot;e&quot;. Deaver and Fairbank were able to achieve the accuracy 20–30% because of the wall thickness of the cylinder.

Little and Parks examined a &quot;thin-walled&quot; (Materials: Al, In, Pb, Sn and Sn–In alloys) cylinder (diameter was about 1 micron) at &quot;T&quot; very close to the transition temperature in an applied magnetic field in the axial direction. They found magnetoresistance oscillations with the period consistent with &quot;h&quot;/2&quot;e&quot;.

What they actually measured was an infinitely small changes of resistance versus temperature for (different) constant magnetic field. The figure to the right shows instead measurements of the resistance for varying applied magnetic field, which corresponds to varying magnetic flux, with the different colors (probably) representing different temperatures.

<doc id="1207224" wikidata="Q6821356" url="?curid=1207224" title="Mesker Park Zoo and Botanic Garden">
<text>The Mesker Park Zoo and Botanic Garden is a zoo that opened in 1928 in Evansville, Indiana, United States. It is located in Mesker Park on Evansville&#x27;s northwest side and is run by the City of Evansville.

The Mesker Park Zoo and Botanic Garden is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.

==History==
The zoo was founded in 1928 by Gilmore M. Haynie and other business leaders. Karl Kae Knecht, a local cartoonist for the &quot;Evansville Courier &amp; Press&quot;, helped popularize the idea of a zoo. It initially opened with two lion cubs, some antelope, and an elephant.

In 1933, a 1:3 scale replica of the &quot;Santa Maria&quot; was opened as a monkey exhibit. The &quot;Monkey Ship&quot; was originally home to rhesus macaques, and eventually housed capuchin monkeys, lemurs, and juvenile American alligators in the pool surrounding the ship. The exhibit was closed in 1991 as the animals were moved to naturalistic habitats, and the ship and pool were eventually restored as a bumper boat attraction for children.

In 2008 the zoo finished a major expansion including the $15 million tropical rainforest exhibit and a new entry complex. The new exhibit was credited with drawing more than 38,000 visitors in its first month. One of two existing lakes in the zoo was filled in to make the exhibit, which added more than 150 animals to the zoo.

In 2017, the zoo added Engelbrecht Carousel, with an adjacent bird aviary added in 2018. This is the zoo&#x27;s second carousel; its historic original carousel was moved to Carowinds in 1979. The total cost for this project is $3 million.

The Penguins of Patagonia exhibit, featuring over a dozen Humboldt Penguins native to parts of Chilé and Peru, opened to visitors in late October 2021. Additionally, the zoo plans to revamp the African Rift area when funding becomes available.

==Exhibits==
Mesker Park was one of the first zoos in the United States to use a moat system to display animals in naturalistic exhibits resembling the animals&#x27; native habitat. Over the years, the zoo has continued to make improvements in habitat design.

===Amazonia===
&quot;Amazonia&quot; is a Central/South American focused rainforest exhibit that opened in 2008. While there are large structures within the exhibit designed to look like vegetation, many of the plants seen within are in fact living plants, maintained by the zoo&#x27;s grounds crew. As such, the exhibit grows and changes in time as plants are added and occasionally trimmed so as to not completely block out the sunlight. The exhibit added more than 150 animals to the zoo and is currently highlighted by jaguars, Baird&#x27;s tapir, bats, black howler monkeys, squirrel monkeys, prehensile-tailed porcupines, Arrau turtles, Cuvier&#x27;s dwarf caiman, and several fish species from the Amazonian River system. The open spaces of the exhibit also function as a free-flight bird aviary, and house over ten species of birds.

=== Penguins of Patagonia ===
Penguins of Patagonia is an outdoor humboldt penguin exhibit.

===North America===

North America includes a large Mexican gray wolf enclosure. 

===Discovery Center===

The Discovery Center is an indoor/outdoor exhibit that focuses on conservation, education, and endangered species. It also houses the zoo&#x27;s education department and many of the animal used in educational programs. This exhibit contains Francois&#x27; langur, red pandas, hyacinth macaw, ocelot and several smaller reptile enclosures. Of particular note is the hellbender salamander exhibit, where the zoo displays and raises juvenile eastern hellbenders as part of a statewide conservation program, in association with Purdue University and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.

===Lemur Forest===

Lemur Forest was opened in 1999 to house the zoo&#x27;s lemurs. It currently holds three species: ring-tailed lemurs, red ruffed lemurs and Coquerel&#x27;s sifaka.

===African Rift===

The African Rift area includes reticulated giraffes, Grant&#x27;s zebras, sitatunga, and white storks in large open areas. In July 2018, the zoo welcomed a new 10-month-old giraffe named Clementine.

===Kley Building===

The Kley Building was built in the 1950s and houses several exhibits. The upper floor contains a newly renovated nocturnal exhibit, a reptile exhibit hall featuring rhinoceros iguana and Komodo dragon, and a hall used for meetings or special events. The lower floor contains the indoor portion of the zoo&#x27;s Indian rhinoceros exhibit. This floor was once home to Bunny, an asian elephant, and Donna, formerly the world&#x27;s oldest living captive hippopotamus. Donna was euthanized at the age of 60 in 2012, because of age-related failing health. A small statue of Donna was constructed by the Zoo&#x27;s Panorama playground in her memory.

===Asia &amp; Australia===
This area reproduces habitats for Asian and Australian animals. It includes the outdoor exhibits for the zoo&#x27;s Indian rhinoceros, as well as Bactrian camels, Siberian tiger, Malayan sun bear, Sichuan takin, laughing kookaburra, and emu.

===Children&#x27;s Enchanted Forest===
This exhibit is geared towards children and contains several playground elements and a seasonal petting zoo in addition to traditional zoo exhibits. It is home to North American river otters, eastern black-and-white colobus monkeys, binturong, crested porcupine, and scarlet macaws. Nearby attractions include the Engelbrecht Carousel a budgerigar aviary, a Müller&#x27;s gibbon exhibit and seasonal exhibits for tortoises.

===Lake Victoria===

Lake Victoria is home to wild resident and migrating birds, as well as turtles and fish. Visitors can walk along two sides of the lake, or rent paddle boats to explore the lake during warmer months. This is the largest lake in the zoo, and is the feature around which the zoo was built.

===African Panorama===

African Panorama is a set of enclosures built around a large, open African savanna exhibit, with observation platforms at the top of the hill, or a trail visitors can use at the bottom. The main exhibit features Abyssinian ground hornbills, ostriches, greater kudu and sitatunga. A smaller exhibit feature a giant anteater and Patagonian mara.

== Botanical features ==
In addition to the live plants inside Amazonia, the grounds of the Mesker Park Zoo feature several gardens designed for guest experience, as well as plants specifically cultivated for zoo animal consumption. Zookeepers harvest these plants throughout the year as part of their animals&#x27; diets.

Each year, in February, a variety of orchids line the Amazonia exhibit as part of the Orchid Escape event. There is also a plant sale fundraiser in the spring, where guests can purchase young specimens of plants seen throughout the zoo.

== Additional attractions and programs ==
The zoo also contains a playground, cafe, gift shop, and tram. The zoo also provides a wide variety of programming, from birthday parties to summer camps to outreach programs, as well as teen and adult volunteer opportunities.

==Conservation==
Many of the animals at the zoo are part of breeding programs organized by the AZA and the zoo is therefore recommended to breed (or not breed) its animals in accordance with those programs. Some recent births include Francois&#x27; langur, sitatunga, takin, African crested porcupine, colobus monkey, and lesser tenrec.

Mesker Park Zoo houses Mexican gray wolves, a critically endangered animal, and works with United States Fish and Wildlife Service as part of their recovery plan for this species. The zoo participates in cross-fostering, which involves producing litters of pups in captivity that are reintroduced into wild packs to bolster the species&#x27; wild gene pool and increase the wild population.

The zoo is also involved in eastern hellbender conservation, and is partnered with Purdue University and Indiana&#x27;s Department of Natural Resources in their efforts to repopulate this subspecies of salamander. The zoo currently has a public display of tanks holding juvenile hellbenders, which are returned to their habitat once they have reached a certain, less predated size, and an off-display adult stream containing several adult salamanders. In 2020, Mesker Park Zoo was the first facility where eastern hellbender salamanders bred naturally in human care, which the animal curators attribute to adjustments in the water parameters and sex ratio of salamanders in the artificial stream.

<text>Vaughn Bodē (; July 22, 1941 – July 18, 1975) was an American underground cartoonist and illustrator known for his character Cheech Wizard and his artwork depicting voluptuous women. A contemporary of Ralph Bakshi, Bodē has been credited as an influence on Bakshi&#x27;s animated films &quot;Wizards&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Bodē has a huge following among graffiti artists, with his characters remaining a popular subject.

Bodē was inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame for comics artists in 2006.

==Career==

He was born Vaughn Bode on July 22, 1941.

In 1963, at age 21, and while living in Utica, New York, Bodē self-published &quot;Das Kämpf&quot;, considered one of the first underground comic books. Created after Bodē&#x27;s stint in the U.S. Army, &quot;Das Kampf&quot; has been called &quot;a war-themed spoof on Charles Schulz&#x27;s 1962 book &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Puppy&quot;.&quot; With money borrowed from his brother Vincent, Bodē photocopied about 100 copies of the 52-page book and (mostly unsuccessfully) attempted to sell it around the Utica area.
In the mid 1960s Bodē was living in Syracuse, New York, attending classes at Syracuse University and contributing to &quot;The Sword of Damocles&quot;, a student-run, though not university-sanctioned, humor magazine similar to &quot;The Harvard Lampoon&quot;. It was here that Bodē&#x27;s most famous comic creation, Cheech Wizard, first saw publication. Cheech Wizard (sometimes characterized as a &quot;cartoon messiah&quot;) is a wizard whose large yellow hat (decorated with black and red stars) covers his entire body except his legs and his big red feet. Cheech Wizard is constantly in search of a good party, cold beer, and attractive women. Usually depicted without arms, it is never actually revealed what Cheech Wizard looks like under the hat, or exactly what kind of creature he is, although in the episode entitled &quot;The Unmasking of Cheech Wizard&quot;, when he &quot;doffs the hat&quot;, it is evident that underneath was a low-rent Oz man all along (in an interview, reference is made to the frontal lump in the hat caused by crossed arms). Characters pressing the issue generally are rewarded with a swift kick to the groin by Cheech. After an initial run in &quot;The Sword of Damocles&quot;, the strip continued for a few more years in &quot;The Daily Orange&quot;, the student-written newspaper at Syracuse University.

In 1968, Bodē illustrated the cover &amp; interior art for R. A. Lafferty&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Space Chantey&quot;, published by Ace Double. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he illustrated covers and interior art for the science fiction digests &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, &quot;Fantastic&quot;, &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot;, &quot;Witzend&quot; and &quot;Worlds of If&quot;.

Discovered by fellow cartoonist Trina Robbins, Bodē moved to Manhattan in 1969 and joined the staff of the underground newspaper the &quot;East Village Other&quot;. It was here that Bodē met Spain Rodriguez, Robert Crumb and other founders of the quickly expanding underground comics world. At the &quot;East Village Other&quot;, he helped found &quot;Gothic Blimp Works&quot;, an underground comics supplement to the magazine, which ran for eight issues, the first two edited by Bodē.

Bodē&#x27;s post-apocalyptic science fiction action series &quot;Cobalt 60&quot; featured an antihero wandering a devastated post-nuclear land, seeking to avenge the murder of his parents. &quot;Cobalt-60&quot; debuted as a ten-page black-and-white story in the science fiction fanzine &quot;Shangri L&#x27;Affaires&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Shaggy&quot;) #73, published in 1968. Bodē won the 1969 Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist largely on the strength of &quot;Cobalt 60&quot;, but he never did anything else with the character. (&quot;Cobalt-60&quot; was later &quot;completed&quot; in the early 1980s by Bodē&#x27;s son Mark Bodé, with stories by Larry Todd, who was Vaughn&#x27;s friend and collaborator in the 1960s on projects for &quot;Eerie&quot;, &quot;Creepy&quot;, and &quot;Vampirella&quot; magazines.)

Beginning in 1968 and continuing until his untimely death, Bodē entered a prolific period of creativity, introducing a number of strips and ongoing series, most of which ran in underground newspapers or erotic magazines:

* Bodē&#x27;s strip &quot;War Lizards&quot;, a look at the Vietnam War from the hostile stance of the period&#x27;s counterculture, was told with anthropomorphic reptiles instead of people. It ran sporadically in the &quot;East Village Other&quot;, &quot;Witzend&quot;, &quot;Pig Society&quot;, and Bodē&#x27;s own &quot;Junkwaffel&quot; from 1969–1972.
* Bodē&#x27;s comic strip &quot;Deadbone&quot;, about the adventures of the inhabitants of a solitary mountain a billion years in the past, ran in the men&#x27;s magazine &quot;Cavalier&quot; from 1969–1975. Originally in black-and-white, when colored the strip changed its title to &quot;Deadbone Erotica&quot; and later simply to &quot;Erotica&quot;.
* Episodes of &quot;Cheech Wizard&quot; ran in the &quot;Funny Pages&quot; of &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine in almost every issue from 1971 to 1975.
* Bodē&#x27;s black-and-white science fiction parody &quot;Sunpot&quot; appeared in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in the early 1970s. (It was later republished, in color, in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;.)
* Bodē&#x27;s monthly comic strip feature &quot;Purple Pictography&quot; ran in &quot;Swank&quot; magazine in 1971–1972. (Bernie Wrightson did the painted art for five of &quot;Purple Pictography&quot; episodes based on Bodē&#x27;s scripts and rough layouts.)

Print Mint published four issues of Bodē&#x27;s solo series &quot;Junkwaffel&quot; from 1971 to 1974. Bodē&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;The Man&quot;, published by Print Mint in 1972, is about a caveman who accidentally makes important observations about life.

=== Cartoon Concert tour===
Beginning in 1972, Bodē toured with a show called the &quot;Cartoon Concert&quot;, that featured him vocalizing his characters while their depictions were presented on a screen behind him via a slide projector (in a performance similar to a chalk talk). The first of these &quot;Cartoon Concerts&quot; was presented in October 1972 at the Detroit Triple Fan Fair in front of 80 people. He next did the Concert at Bowling Green State University, and eventually performed it at several comic book conventions, including the November 1972 Creation Con in New York City. Observing the crowd reaction, The Bantam Lecture Bureau immediately signed him on, and the show became very popular on the college lecture circuit. Bodē even performed it at the Louvre, in Paris.

== Personal life ==
=== Early life ===
Bodē was born in Utica, New York, the son of Kenneth and Elsie Bodé. Vaughn was one of four children, including his older brother Victor and younger siblings Vincent and Valerie. Vaughn&#x27;s father was an alcoholic; he started drawing as a way of escaping a less-than-happy childhood. Bodē&#x27;s parents divorced when he was around ten years old, and he was sent to live with an uncle near Washington, D.C.

After joining the Army at age 19, Bodē went AWOL but later received an honorable discharge due to a psychiatric diagnosis.

Bodē married Barbara Hawkins at age 20 in 1961. Their son Mark was born in 1963. Barbara divorced Bodē in 1972, and he moved to San Francisco in 1973 (with some of his underground contemporaries, including Robbins and Spain).

=== Sexuality ===
Around 1970–1971, conversations with the guru Prem Rawat and fellow cartoonist Jeffrey Catherine Jones (with whom Bodē shared a studio in Woodstock, New York) led Bodē to cross-dressing, transvestism, and even a short-lived experiment with female hormones. Bodē described his sexuality as &quot;auto-sexual, heterosexual, homosexual, mano-sexual, sado-sexual, trans-sexual, uni-sexual, omni-sexual.&quot;

=== Death ===
Bodē&#x27;s death was due to autoerotic asphyxiation. His last words were to his son: &quot;Mark, I&#x27;ve seen God four times, and I&#x27;m going to see him again soon. That&#x27;s No. 1 to me, and you&#x27;re No. 2.&quot; Thirty-three years old at the time of his death, Bodē&#x27;s ashes were dropped from a Cessna airplane over the waters off the coast of Point Reyes.

He left behind a library of sketchbooks, journals, finished and unfinished works, paintings, and comic strips. Most of his art has since been published in a variety of collections, mostly from Fantagraphics.

== Influence ==
Bodē was a friend of animator Ralph Bakshi, and warned him against working with Robert Crumb on the animated film adaptation of Crumb&#x27;s strip &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;. Bodē has been credited as an influence on Bakshi&#x27;s films &quot;Wizards&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

Bodē has a huge following among graffiti artists and his work can often be seen replicated in the world of street art. As the original New York graffiti train writers (such as DONDI) chose to replicate his characters, images from his work have remained popular throughout the history of graffiti.

His son Mark Bodé is also an artist, producing works similar to the elder Bodē&#x27;s style, and further cementing his father&#x27;s legacy. In 2004, Mark completed one of his father&#x27;s unfinished works, &quot;The Lizard of Oz&quot;, a send-up of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, starring Cheech Wizard one more time.

==Awards==
The Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist was bestowed upon him in 1969, and he was nominated for Best Professional Artist the following year. He also won the Yellow Kid Award, awarded by the International Congress of Cartoonists and Animators at the Italian Lucca comics festival, in 1974. He was a finalist for induction into the Eisner Hall of Fame in 1998 and 2002, before finally being inducted in 2006. He was awarded the Inkpot Award in 1975.

<doc id="1207232" wikidata="Q4799475" url="?curid=1207232" title="Arthur Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham">
<text>Arthur Hamilton Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham (8 November 1868 – 21 July 1947) was an English soldier, diplomat, politician, philanthropist and patron of the arts. After military postings and an assignment to the British Embassy in Washington, he retired from the military in 1900. He entered politics, was first elected in 1900, and later served as Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and First Lord of the Admiralty following the First World War. He donated his country house, Chequers, to the nation as a retreat for the Prime Minister, and co-founded the Courtauld Institute of Art.

==Early life and family==

Arthur Hamilton Lee was born at The Rectory, Bridport, Dorset in 1868. His father, Rev. Melville Lauriston Lee was rector of the town&#x27;s Anglican St. Mary&#x27;s Church. He was a grandson of Sir John Theophilus Lee, who as a midshipman was present at the Battle of the Nile.

==Education and early military career==
After attending Cheltenham College, Lee entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He was commissioned into the Royal Artillery as a second lieutenant on 17 February 1888. He was posted to the Far East, China, as Adjutant of the Royal Hong Kong Regiment (the Volunteers). He was promoted lieutenant on 18 February 1891. He returned to England in 1891, and was stationed on the Isle of Wight for the next two years.

==Professor at Royal Military College of Canada==
On 18 August 1893, at the age of 24, Lee became a professor of Strategy and Tactics, at the Royal Military College of Canada, in Kingston, Ontario, with the local rank of captain. Since only 11 to 30 cadets annually entered the College in those days, Lee would have instructed about 140 cadets in his five years at the college (1893–1898), consisting of cadet numbers 320 to 457. Cadet No. 433, future Major General Thomas Victor Anderson, D.S.O., a future Chief of Staff of the Canadian Army, recalled that Lee was known around the Royal Military College as &#x27;The Nipper&#x27;, which the cadets christened him because he used to sing George Grossmith&#x27;s songs with gusto. He enjoyed riding and walking in winter across the ice to Wolfe Island, and to town. He was a regular attendant at St. George&#x27;s Cathedral (Kingston, Ontario) to hear the dean Buxton Smith. When Colonel Gerald Kitson, K.R.R.C., became RMC Commandant in 1897, Captain Lee came to live with the Kitsons in the Commandant&#x27;s residence. In 1894, Lee initiated a Military Survey of the Canadian Frontier, and supervised its progress until its completion in 1896. During the summer of 1897 he was a Special Correspondent for the London &quot;Daily Chronicle&quot;, covering the earlier stages of the Klondike Gold Rush, based on his travels to Alaska and the Yukon. In 1900, when Lee resigned as British Military Attaché in Washington, D.C., Colonel Kitson resigned as Commandant of RMC to take over the Washington post vacated by Lee.

==Diplomatic postings==
He did not receive substantive promotion until the completion of his RMC appointment on 18 April 1898. He became the British military attaché with the United States Army in Cuba during the Spanish–American War, later in 1898. He received the U.S. campaign medal, was made an honorary member of the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry—the famous Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Rough Riders&quot;—and met Theodore Roosevelt. On 28 January 1899 Lee, who was still not 30 years old, was appointed military attaché at the British Embassy in Washington, with the temporary rank of Lieutenant Colonel (for the duration of his appointment). Although he would have preferred to have been on active service in South Africa, since the Boer War had just started, Lee enjoyed the challenging diplomatic assignment and became a regular correspondent of Roosevelt. Theodore Roosevelt wrote of Lee: &quot;The military attachés came out to look on-English, German, Russian, French and Japanese. With the Englishman, Captain Arthur Lee, a capital fellow, we soon struck up an especially close friendship; and we saw much of him throughout the campaign.&quot; Roosevelt also wrote:&quot;Captain Lee, the British attaché, spent some time with us; we had begun to regard him as almost a member of the regiment.&quot; Later in life Theodore Roosevelt wrote to Rudyard Kipling and told him not to share the contents of the letter with anyone, &quot;except Arthur Lee, to whom you are entirely at liberty to show it.&quot;

==Marriage, retirement from military==
On 23 December 1899 Lee married Ruth Moore (died 1966), daughter of New York banker John Godfrey Moore. He had first met her at parties in Kingston and Gananoque, and had taken her to balls at the Royal Military College, Kingston. Ruth was left a substantial inheritance after her father&#x27;s death shortly before the wedding. Lee was promoted brevet major on 8 August 1900, returned to regimental duty on 22 August 1900, and retired from the army on 12 December 1900.

==Politics==
In 1900, Lee returned to England and embarked upon a political career. He was elected as a Conservative Member of Parliament for the Hampshire constituency of Fareham in the 1900 general election while still a regular officer. He represented Fareham for the next 18 years until his elevation to the peerage.
He served as Civil Lord of the Admiralty from 1903 to 1905 under William Palmer, 2nd Earl of Selborne. He also continued military service during this period as a member of the Volunteer Force.

The resignation of Arthur Balfour as Conservative Prime Minister in favour of Liberal Leader, Henry Campbell-Bannerman, in 1905 and the defeat of the Conservative Party in the elections of 1906 and 1910 postponed Lee&#x27;s further office for a decade. He was Chairman of the Parliamentary Aerial Defence Committee, from 1910 to 1914. He also introduced the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1912.

==First World War==
At the beginning of the First World War Lee served as Lord Kitchener&#x27;s personal commissioner to report on the Army Medical Services in France, with the rank of temporary colonel. From October 1915 he served David Lloyd George at the Ministry of Munitions, and followed him to the War Office in 1916. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 12 July 1916.

On 8 June 1917, with Lloyd George now Prime Minister, Lee became Director-General of Food Production under Rowland Prothero as President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. Having then left the army he was permitted to retain the honorary rank of colonel. He was recognised for his work on 1 January 1918, being appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire. He was elevated to the peerage on 9 July that year as Baron Lee of Fareham, of Chequers in the County of Buckinghamshire, shortly before he resigned as Director-General of Food Production after disagreements with Prothero. He then became a member of the House of Lords.

==Joins Cabinet==
Lee joined the Cabinet and the Privy Council in August 1919 when he was appointed Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, succeeding Prothero. He became First Lord of the Admiralty on 18 February 1921, and was selected as a second British delegate to attend the Washington Naval Conference, along with Arthur Balfour, later that year. He resigned from Lloyd George&#x27;s government in 1922, and was promoted to Viscount Lee of Fareham, of Bridport in the County of Dorset, on 9 December that year.

==Productive from House of Lords==
Conservative Prime Ministers Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin, along with Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, all benefited substantially from Viscount Lee&#x27;s dedicated work during the decade of the 1920s, as Lee was not content to rest upon his laurels in the House of Lords. He went on to chair Royal Commissions on the civil service in India (1923–1924), London cross-river traffic (1926), and Police Powers and Procedure (1928). He was also Chair of the Radium Commission and of the Committee on Police Pay and Pensions (1925). He was appointed Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India on 1 January 1925, and he was promoted Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1929 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours. He was also appointed Knight of Grace in the Venerable Order of Saint John on 20 June 1930.

==Chequers==

Lee and his wife took on a long lease of Chequers, a country house and estate in Buckinghamshire, in 1909. The Lees bought the property in 1912 after the owner died, and began restoration. In 1917, they gave the estate, and the entire contents of the house which included a library, historical papers and manuscripts and a collection of Cromwellian portraits and artefacts, in trust to the nation to be used as the official residence and retreat of successive British Prime Ministers in perpetuity, enabled by the Chequers Estate Act 1917, the first piece of legislation to recognize the figure of a Prime Minister. The Lees left the property in January 1921, and Lloyd George was the first Prime Minister to use the property.

==Patron of the arts, and later life==
After furnishing Chequers, Lee began a second collection. He gained the financial backing of Samuel Courtauld and Joseph Duveen, and established the Courtauld Institute of Art with the University of London. The institute, the first to offer degrees in the history of art in Britain, opened in 1932 with William George Constable as its director at Lee&#x27;s request. Also with Courtauld, he persuaded the University of London to accept the transfer of the Warburg Institute from Hamburg; it was loaned to him prior to its re-establishment in 1944. He also donated a silver collection and other objects to Hart House, at the University of Toronto in Canada in 1940. In 1935 he donated a Madonna of Venetian painter Bartolomeo Vivarini (c. 1480) to Westminster Abbey. 

Additionally, in the 1920s Lee was a trustee of the Wallace Collection and of the National Gallery. He served as chairman of the latter in 1931–2, and was a member of the Royal Fine Art Commission from 26 May 1926 until his death.

Between 1917 and 1939 Lee was President of Cheltenham College.

Lee wrote his autobiography, entitled &quot;A Good Innings&quot; in 1941, and this was privately published in three volumes that year. It was later republished by his good friend Alan Clark, also a Conservative politician, for publishers J. Murray in 1974 (see below).

==Death==
Lord Lee died at Old Quarries, a grade II listed building in Avening, Gloucestershire, in 1947. Lee had no children and his viscountcy became extinct upon his death.

His widow, Viscountess Lee, presented to the Royal Military College of Canada Museum a silver-headed walking stick of her late husband, which he had used daily at RMC fifty-four years earlier. The stick has two silver bands listing the places where Lee served, or visited, between 1888 and 1904, which include the Royal Military College of Canada. Lady Lee also presented the RMC Museum with three photographs of Lord Lee –- two of them taken in Kingston, one in uniform in 1893, and the other in 1896 wearing a checked suit, silver-topped stick in hand. The third is a photograph of the portrait by Herbert James Gunn in full regalia of a Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath.

<text>Brookfield Zoo Chicago, known until 2024 as simply Brookfield Zoo, and also known as the Chicago Zoological Park, is a zoo located in Brookfield, Illinois. Brookfield Zoo is owned by the Forest Preserve District of Cook County and is managed by the Chicago Zoological Society. It is largest zoo in the Chicago metropolitan area and houses approximately 450 species of animals in an area of .

Brookfield Zoo opened on July 1, 1934, and quickly gained international recognition for using moats and ditches instead of cages. 
The zoo was also the first in the United States to exhibit giant pandas, one of which (Su Lin) has been taxidermied and put on display in Chicago&#x27;s Field Museum of Natural History. In 1960 the zoo opened the first fully indoor bottlenose dolphin exhibit in the United States, and in the 1980s the zoo introduced the first fully indoor tropical rainforest simulation exhibit, which was the largest indoor zoo exhibit in the world at that time. It is often listed as one of the best zoos in the United States.

==History==
===20th century===

In 1919, Edith Rockefeller McCormick donated land she received from her father as a wedding gift to the Cook County Forest Preserve District for development as a zoological garden. The district added to that plot and in 1921 the Chicago Zoological Society was established. Construction did not begin until 1926 after a zoo tax was approved. Construction slowed during the onset of the Great Depression, but regained momentum by late 1931. Construction went on at an increased pace and the zoo opened on July 1, 1934. By the end of September 1934, over one million people had visited the zoo; reaching four million by 1936.

The 1950s saw the addition of a veterinary hospital, a children&#x27;s zoo, and the Roosevelt Fountain, named for U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt. The zoo experienced a decline in the 1960s until a large bond issue from the Forest Preserve District allowed it to expand. The zoo opened the nation&#x27;s first fully indoor dolphinarium in the 1960s.

In the early 1980s the zoo constructed Tropic World, an indoor simulated tropical rainforest exhibit. Tropic World was designed by French architect Pierre Venoa and was completed in 1984. In 1996, a 3-year-old boy was injured when he fell into an enclosure within Tropic World. The incident gained worldwide attention after Binti Jua, a female western lowland gorilla, tended to the child until zoo staff rescued him.

===21st century===

In the early 21st century, the zoo underwent upgrades including construction of the Hamill Family Play Zoo, a large wolf exhibit, an interactive butterfly tent, group catering pavilions, and the largest non-restored, hand-carved, wooden carousel in the United States. Great Bear Wilderness, a $27.3 million exhibit for grizzly and polar bears, opened in 2010. The interiors of several existing buildings were reconfigured into immersion exhibits based upon ecosystems rather than by clades. These included exhibits related to South American coasts, swamps of the Southern United States, and various exhibits related to deserts, the African savanna, and the Australian Outback.

The zoo&#x27;s reptile house, the first building to open in 1934, closed in 2005 and was converted into the Mary Ann McLean Conservation Leadership Center which does not display live animals, but it details the zoo&#x27;s larger conservation mission.

In 2011, the zoo faced protests from In Defense of Animals over the deaths of their African elephants, and as a result Brookfield Zoo no longer displays elephants or hippopotamus. 
The Children&#x27;s Zoo, which opened in August 1953, was dismantled in early 2013, and a new family-based series of exhibits known as Wild Encounters opened on the site on July 1, 2015.

The zoo has been closed only five times in its history: On September 14, 2008, after damage from a weekend rainstorm; on February 2, 2011, after a major blizzard; on April 18–19, 2013, after flooding from a severe rainstorm; January 30–31, 2019, due to below-freezing temperatures;, from March 19 to July 1, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and on January 12, 2024, due a winter storm.

In September 2023, the zoo received the largest private donation in its history, $40 million, from an anonymous donor.

==Notable staff==
Chicago cartoonist John T. McCutcheon was the president of the Chicago Zoological Society from 1921 until 1948 and oversaw the zoo&#x27;s construction, opening and its early years, including helping it through the war years, when the zoo saw a decrease in attendance.

Grace Olive Wiley briefly worked as a reptile curator at the zoo in 1935.

George B. Rabb was the director from 1976 until 2003, having originally worked as a researcher and an assistant to the director.

== Conservation programs ==
Brookfield Zoo Chicago has a conservation project in Punta San Juan, Peru. Disney World partnered with the zoo by giving a $25,000 grant assigned specifically to the work in Punta San Juan, Peru, which helped the Chicago Zoological Society conservationists gain clearance into the highly restricted and protected area. The CZS has hired multiple people that already worked for the reserve to help build a conservation research team. Samples are taken from wildlife such as South American sea lions, Inca terns, Peruvian boobies, guanay cormorants, Grey gulls, and the endangered Humboldt penguins. The team uses the information they gathered to research the environment, observe the species, and monitor populations. Project results further knowledge about the ocean and help save endangered species. Team members also continuously have groups of children, of varying ages, go out to clean up garbage that accumulates on the beaches of Punta San Juan from the Pacific Ocean.

== Economics ==

In 2014, revenue of Brookfield Zoo Chicago was made up by $26.6 million from admissions and guest services, $15.2 million from taxes, $11.5 million from membership dues, $11.5 million from contributions, sponsorships, and net assets released, and $1.2 million from investments and other income. Expenses in 2014 included $15.7 million for admissions and guest services, $15 million for animal collections and conservation programs, $10.7 million for care of buildings and grounds, $7.9 million for management and general, $5.9 million for public education and communications, $3.8 million for marketing and public relations, $3.4 million for fundraising, and $1.4 million for membership. Revenue totaled $66 million and spending totaled $63.8 million during 2014.

In 2010, Governor Pat Quinn granted Brookfield Zoo Chicago $15.6 million to aid repairing and remodeling many parts of the zoo. This included updating the north entrance to the zoo on 31st Street and Golfview Avenue.

The CZS has hosted several fundraising events, Wines in the Wild and Wild Wild Whirl, where they collected various donations ranging in totals from $130,000 to $1.5 million.

A total of 808 volunteers help the zoo with 74,401 community service hours which equates to $1.86 million of work.

Economic movement approaches $150 million, 2,000 jobs, 580 volunteers, and around 2.2 million visitors every year.

<doc id="1207239" wikidata="Q4732270" url="?curid=1207239" title="Alliance (Firefly)">
<text>The Alliance, formally known as the Union of Allied Planets, is a powerful fictional corporate supergovernment and law-enforcement organization in the &quot;Firefly&quot; franchise that controls the majority of territory within the known universe.

It consists of Sihnon, a mostly East and Southeast Asian–themed planet led by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), and Londinium, a world with mostly Northern American and Western European influences led by the United States of America (USA). It retains a mixture of both Western and Eastern cultures. English and Mandarin Chinese are commonly used languages, with most of the inhabitants under the Alliance being bilingual.

Originally composed solely of a number of &quot;core worlds&quot;, several years prior to the show&#x27;s time frame the Alliance fought the Unification War to bring all colonized worlds under its control. The Independent Faction or &quot;Browncoats&quot; wanted the outer worlds to remain autonomous and attempted to resist Alliance control. The war raged for several years, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides, until the Alliance emerged victorious. An armistice was signed between the Alliance and the Independent Faction, thus ending the war and securing Alliance control over the entirety of the system.

==Name==
The scripts for the pilot, &quot;Serenity&quot;, and the first broadcast episode, &quot;The Train Job&quot;. refer to an &quot;AngloSino&quot; flag on the IAV spaceship &quot;Dortmunder&quot; and on the stolen boxes. The Alliance flag shown in the pilot is a blending of the American and Chinese flags, having the blue field and the red and white stripes of the United States flag and the red field and yellow stars of the Chinese flag. Two versions of this flag, one with 13 stripes and one with five stripes, appear in the series.

The alliance is formally described as the Union of Allied Planets in the episode &quot;Ariel&quot;.

==Corporations==
The Blue Sun corporation is a powerful conglomerate with much influence within the Alliance. Joss Whedon compared it with &quot;Coca-Cola or Microsoft&quot; and said that &quot;practically half the government was Blue Sun.&quot; Their agents are &quot;Hands of Blue.&quot; The Weyland-Yutani corporation from &quot;Alien&quot; is also alluded to; its logo appears on Alliance weapons. In the movie &quot;Serenity&quot;, the Alliance also hires local security companies.

==Universe==

The two worlds that make up the &quot;core planets&quot; (the first worlds to be terraformed) are Sihnon, a mostly East and Southeast Asian–themed planet, and Londinium, a world with mostly American and Western European influences. The alliance of the two worlds leads up to a multi-racial, multi-ethnic, and multi-religious universe.

The Alliance may have some elements of a monarchy. In &quot;Serenity,&quot; Malcolm Reynolds (&quot;Serenity&quot;&#x27;s captain) said &quot;I&#x27;d like to be king of all Londinium&quot; and many of Inara Serra&#x27;s customers are Lords. However, &quot;King of all Londinium&quot; may just be an idiom (cf &quot;king of the world&quot; in modern usage) and Lord could merely be a political title.

There is also evidence that the Alliance may have some elements of a technocracy, as in a flashback within the episode &quot;Safe&quot;, Simon Tam&#x27;s parents chastised Simon&#x27;s fear for River as potentially threatening his future, including the possibility of becoming the medical-elect, presumably the equivalent of an elected Technocrat representing the Medical sector.

In &quot;Serenity&quot;, the movie set in the &quot;Firefly&quot; universe, it is revealed that the Alliance is run by a Parliament, as well as a prime minister. This invites the possibility that the Alliance is a constitutional monarchy and Westminster parliamentary system with the inclusion of technocratically elected members, where outside of the central planets, oligarchies through lordships represent local colonial governance.

It appears that this Alliance was a melding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and the United States of America (USA). The Alliance retains a mixture of both Western and Eastern cultures from the &quot;Earth-That-Was&quot;, the original home of all humans, spearheaded by the Americans and the Chinese.

Generally, the Alliance is rather authoritarian, although Joss Whedon, the series&#x27; creator, has said this is at least partly because the show is seen from the viewpoint of those hostile to the Alliance. Whedon himself admits that sometimes, the Alliance is like the predominant view that the United States saw itself in World War II: doing &quot;very good things&quot;, helping people and spreading democracy. At other times the Alliance can tend towards black ops and power-grabbing, although rarely more so than any real-world democracy.

Due to the melding of American and Chinese influences in the Alliance, most people in the &quot;Firefly&quot; universe are equally adept in speaking both English and Mandarin Chinese; some characters on the show speak Chinese at times (usually when using obscenities, so Whedon wouldn&#x27;t have to bleep anything out and ruin the suspension of disbelief), and many signs are printed in both English and Chinese. Additionally, during the episode &quot;Out of Gas,&quot; &quot;Serenity&quot;″s warning messages over the intercom are repeated in both English and Cantonese. The Chinese spoken is based on Mandarin (intermixed with Cantonese), but the pronunciation is heavily corrupted from the real-world language by the actors.

Chinese appears to be the superior language in Alliance society as it is used for written public communications and for polite address between strangers. For example, when the Alliance agent McGinnis, answers the intercom in the episode &quot;Ariel&quot;, he uses, (&quot;ni hao&quot;) rather than &quot;hello&quot;.

==Alliance military==

The Alliance operates a fleet of massive spaceships, resembling huge floating cities, that act as both military and police in the space between the various planets of the &quot;Firefly&quot; Universe. Alliance ships have the registry prefix IAV (Interstellar Alliance Vessel): e.g., IAV &quot;Dortmunder&quot; and IAV &quot;Magellan&quot;. The pilot episode of the series reveals that the large city-ships carry smaller gunships; these are never named nor described further. In the episode &quot;Bushwhacked,&quot; it is revealed that Alliance ships have nurseries.

In the film &quot;Serenity&quot;, there appear a fleet of sleeker, more streamlined warships, suggesting that the film had a higher CGI budget.

Alliance ground troops are nicknamed &quot;purple bellies&quot; (in contrast to the Independent &quot;browncoats&quot;). Crewmembers on Alliance starships wear gray uniforms resembling those worn by Imperial German Army from World War I; officers and enlisted crew are identically dressed (except for headgear: officers wear hats, enlisted crew wear berets). In &quot;Serenity&quot;, Alliance crew members wear blue uniforms.

The exact structure of the Alliance military, such as its rank system and branch organization, is not described. Some Alliance officers are seen with naval ranks, such as Commander, and others with ground force ranks such as Colonel and General.

==Future==
During the events of the 2005 film, the crew of &quot;Serenity&quot; discover the truth behind River Tam&#x27;s insanity; she had discovered the truth behind the Reavers, in which the Alliance had inadvertently created the first Reavers in an attempt to create peace on the planet Miranda. Malcolm Reynolds resolves to reveal this to the universe, and after a lengthy battle with the Operative, succeeds in doing so, ruining the Operative&#x27;s faith in the Alliance&#x27;s methods and revealing the existence of the Reavers (plus the true colors of the Alliance) to the system at large. Before he departs, the Operative tells Mal of how much trouble he had caused the Alliance (in the shooting script, he states that they had gotten multiple complaints from several worlds), and warns him that, although their regime is weakened, they will be after him in revenge.

==Critical analyses==
Author Stanley C. Pelkey notes the marked influence of the Western genre on the &quot;Firefly&quot; franchise. He says that in contrast to most westerns, the central civilizing force (the Alliance) is portrayed as evil. He goes on to say that little concrete evidence is given to support this, especially in the series as opposed to the movie. He notes an example where the Alliance gave medical aid to a &quot;Serenity&quot; crew member, and then let the ship go, and contrasts it with the implausibility of similar treatment being afforded to the rebels by an Imperial Star Destroyer from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; milieu. Pelkey says that even in the movie with its &quot;dark revelation,&quot; there is still some ambiguity about the Alliance&#x27;s moral alignment.

Whedon himself has said the Alliance sometimes represents a &quot;beautiful shining light of democracy&quot; but at other times reflects the American government as it was when it intervened in Vietnam, which Whedon sees as something the U.S. had no right to do, nor any ability to do successfully.

<text>Bredikhin is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon. It lies just to the west of the crater Mitra, and northeast of Raimond.

This is a worn crater formation with features that have been dusted by material from the ray system of Jackson, about three crater diameters to the northwest. The rim is overlaid by a small crater along the west-northwest, and by a formation of craterlets along the southwest. The most prominent feature within the interior is the crater which overlays much of the northwest floor, including the midpoint.

Bredikhin lies within the Dirichlet-Jackson Basin.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Bredikhin.

<text>Frederic Mompou Dencausse (), or Federico Mompou (16 April 1893 – 30 June 1987), was a Spanish composer and pianist.

== Life ==

=== Early years ===
Mompou was born in Barcelona to the lawyer Frederic Mompou and his wife Josefina Dencausse, who was of French origin. His brother Josep Mompou (1888–1968) became a painter. His sketch of a simple farmhouse appeared on the covers of all of Frederic&#x27;s published music.

Mompou studied piano under Pedro Serra at the Conservatori Superior de Música del Liceu before going to Paris, to study at the Conservatoire de Paris, which was headed by Gabriel Fauré. Mompou had heard Fauré perform in Barcelona when he was nine years old, and his music and performing style had made a powerful and lasting impression on him. He had a letter of introduction to Fauré from Enrique Granados, but it never reached its intended recipient. He entered the Conservatoire (with another Spaniard, José Iturbi), but studied with Isidor Philipp, head of the piano department. He also took private piano lessons with Ferdinand Motte-Lacroix and harmony and composition lessons with Marcel Samuel-Rousseau. His extreme shyness, introspection and self-effacement meant that he could not pursue a solo career, but chose to devote himself to composition instead. In 1917 he returned to Barcelona, fleeing the war. His first published work, &quot;Cants magics&quot;, appeared in 1920, mainly as a result of the advocacy of his friend Agustin Quintas.

=== 1920s–1950s ===
Mompou returned to Paris in 1921, by which time his music was being regularly performed publicly, by his former teacher Motte-Lacroix and others, and he found himself the darling of Paris. In 1921, his &quot;Scènes d&#x27;enfants&quot; (1915–18), performed by Motte-Lacroix, inspired the French critic Émile Vuillermoz to proclaim Mompou &quot;the only disciple and successor&quot; to Claude Debussy. Mompou himself often performed his own compositions, but only at private soirees, never in public. However, his time in Paris was not easy. He published no music between 1931 and 1941, when he left for his native Catalonia, fleeing the German occupation of Paris. In that time, his father died and his brother became seriously ill. The Spanish Civil War troubled him greatly, although he was initially supportive of the Falangists. His personal financial situation was often dire enough to lead him away from music and into various business ventures, including an attempt to revive the traditional family bell foundry.

Kenneth MacMillan&#x27;s ballet &quot;La Casa de los Pájaros&quot; (&quot;The House of Birds&quot;), set to orchestrations by John Lanchbery of various piano pieces by Mompou, was premiered at Sadler&#x27;s Wells in London in 1955 and was also staged at the 4th Festival de Música y Danza at Granada.

In 1956 appeared &quot;Don Perlimpin&quot; (also seen as &quot;Don Perlimpinada&quot;), a ballet written in collaboration between Mompou and Xavier Montsalvatge and based on a play by Federico García Lorca. Most of the music was by Mompou, but Montsalvatge helped with the orchestration and linking passages and added two numbers of his own.

In 1957, aged 64, Mompou married the pianist Carmen Bravo, who was 30 years his junior. It was the first marriage for both of them and they had no children.

=== Later years ===

In 1975 and 1976 he was a jury member for the first Paloma O&#x27;Shea Santander International Piano Competition. In Barcelona he became a member of the Royal Academy of Sant Jordi; he lived there until his death in 1987 at the age of 94 from respiratory failure. He is buried at the Montjuïc Cemetery in Barcelona.

===Discoveries===
After the death of his widow in 2007 about 80 unpublished and hitherto unknown works were discovered in Mompou’s files at his home and also in the files of the National Library of Catalonia. Some of them were given performances in Barcelona in 2008 by Jordi Masó and Mac McClure. Many others were given their premiere performances in 2009 by Marcel Worms.

===Awards===
During his career Mompou received numerous awards, including: &quot;Chevalier des arts et lettres&quot; (France), Premio Nacional de Música (Spain), Doctor &quot;honoris causa&quot;, Universitat de Barcelona (1979) and Medalla d&#x27;Or de la Generalitat de Catalunya (1980).

== Style ==
Mompou is best known as a miniaturist, writing short, relatively improvisatory music, often described as &quot;delicate&quot; or &quot;intimate&quot;. His principal influences were French impressionism, Erik Satie and Gabriel Fauré, resulting in a style in which musical development is minimized and expression is concentrated into very small forms. He was fond of ostinato figures, bell imitations (his mother&#x27;s family owned the Dencausse bell foundry and his grandfather was a bell maker), and a kind of incantatory, meditative sound, the most complete expression of which can be found in his masterpiece &quot;Musica Callada&quot; (or the &quot;Voice of Silence&quot;) based on the mystical poetry of Saint John of the Cross.
He was also influenced by the sounds and smells of the maritime quarter of Barcelona, the cry of seagulls, the sound of children playing and popular Catalan culture. He often dispensed with bar lines and key signatures. His music is rooted in the chord G–C–E–A–D, which he named &quot;Barri de platja&quot; (the Beach Quarter).

== Recordings ==
Mompou himself recorded a few of his piano pieces for EMI in 1950 and then a much larger portion of his piano output, including the &quot;Musica callada&quot;, for Ensayo in 1974. The later recordings have been reissued in a boxed set of 4 CDs by Brilliant Classics. For decades, other pianists rarely recorded his works, with major figures such as Arthur Rubinstein, Guiomar Novaes, Magda Tagliaferro, and Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli recording just a handful of his pieces. In the late 1950s, Mompou&#x27;s wife, Carmen Bravo, recorded some of his works for EMI.

Alicia de Larrocha recorded a larger selection (for Decca in Europe, and London in the US). After Mompou&#x27;s death, his works have received greater attention. Pianists such as Stephen Hough in 1997 and Arcadi Volodos in 2013 have released albums devoted to his music. Jordi Masó recorded a cycle of Mompou&#x27;s piano works for Naxos Records. Other contemporary pianists who have recorded Mompou&#x27;s pieces include Daniil Trifonov, Alexandre Tharaud, Herbert Henck, Clelia Iruzun, Jenny Lin, Aaron Krister Johnson, and Javier Perianes. British pianist Martin Jones recorded the complete piano works of Mompou for Nimbus, including those unpublished in Mompou&#x27;s lifetime, many of which were discovered when his apartment was cleared out in 2008. The Spanish soprano Victoria de los Ángeles recorded Mompou&#x27;s song cycle &quot;El combat del somni&quot;; a film of her singing one of these songs in her living room with the composer as her accompanist was recorded in 1971.

Guitarist Andrés Segovia recorded Mompou&#x27;s &quot;Suite Compostelana&quot;, which was dedicated to him.

<doc id="1207258" wikidata="Q6495157" url="?curid=1207258" title="Late-May 1998 tornado outbreak and derecho">
<text>The Late-May 1998 tornado outbreak and derecho was a historic tornado outbreak and derecho that began on the afternoon of May 30 and extended throughout May 31, 1998, across a large portion of the northern half of the United States and southern Ontario from southeastern Montana east and southeastward to the Atlantic Ocean. The initial tornado outbreak, including the devastating Spencer tornado, hit southeast South Dakota on the evening of May 30. The Spencer tornado was the most destructive and the second-deadliest tornado in South Dakota history. A total of 13 people were killed; 7 by tornadoes and 6 by the derecho. Over two million people lost electrical power, some for up to 10 days.

The derecho was the most violent line of thunderstorms observed on earth during the 1998 calendar year according to the National Weather Service review shortly after the year was over. It was the climax of an unusually heavy derecho season in the North-Central United States and adjacent parts of Canada and the Northeast United States, and this storm combined the characteristics of the two major forms of derecho, the serial and progressive derecho, known as a hybrid derecho. At various points of its evolution, it displayed textbook or record manifestations of supercell and derecho-related phenomena such as the right-mover supercell, evolution of supercells into a linear meso-scale feature which rapidly became a derecho, cumulonimbus with overshooting top and dome, bow echo, bookend vortices, regular and rotor downbursts, gust front, gustnado, rear inflow notch, classic derecho radar signature, effects of infrasound and atmospheric electricity, haboobs, and wind effects on bodies of water including seiches and exposure of bottoms of water features by the wind. The disturbance which was originally the derecho finally disappeared off the coast of Norway more than a week later.

==May 30 South Dakota event==

The first severe weather of the outbreak was reported at 12:30 p.m. in southeast Montana. Several hours later a supercell thunderstorm produced hail across southeast Montana, kicking off the outbreak in earnest. Numerous reports of very large hail were received throughout the outbreak with the largest official report of north of St. Lawrence in east-central South Dakota. The hail itself produced thousands of dollars in damage. Many reports of severe straight-line winds and damage were also reported. Numerous storm chaser reports suggest that significant severe weather events also occurred in the sparsely populated area traversed by the storm.

Later that evening, a supercell in southeastern South Dakota produced a series of tornadoes. The family of tornadoes that crossed the Spencer area was observed by a Doppler on Wheels (DOW) radar (Wurman et al. 1997, Wurman 2001). The DOW observed the tornadoes from before 8:04 through 8:45 pm local time (01:04–01:45 UTC)(Alexander and Wurman 2005) and the passage of a destructive F4 tornado through Spencer itself from 8:37-8:38 (01:37-01:38 UTC). DOW measurements of tornadic winds over the largely destroyed southern portion of Spencer have permitted the first (and only as of December 2006) direct comparison of measured winds with F (or EF) Scale damage ratings as reported in the above referenced articles. Peak observed Doppler winds of near corresponded well with the documented F4 damage.

The DOW observations showed that the list of tornadoes derived from damage surveys alone, and the F-scale rating of that damage, may be incomplete and underestimate actual tornado intensity (Wurman and Alexander 2005). Single tornadoes may be mis-characterized as multiple tornadoes due to breaks in the observed damage. DOW measurements suggest that the F4 tornado may have had a multiple-vortex structure as it struck Spencer.

Storm chasers William T. Reid, Martin Lisius, Keith Brown, and Cheryl Chang forecasted and intercepted the large and destructive Spencer, South Dakota tornado moments before it entered the town. The chase team was positioned east of town and first observed the tornado at approximately 8:35 pm and captured numerous photographs, video, and 35mm motion picture film of the event as it unfolded.

==Confirmed tornadoes==
===May 30 event (South Dakota)===
===May 30 event (Derecho)===

==Spencer, South Dakota==

The Spencer, South Dakota F4 tornado was the most destructive and second deadliest tornado in the history of the state. It was also the fifth deadliest tornado of the year. It began as a large, dust-cloaked tornado northwest of Farmer, South Dakota in Hanson County, concurrent with the demise of the second &quot;Fulton&quot; tornado. Continuing toward the east-southeast, it struck several farmsteads before crossing the Hanson/McCook County line a half mile west-northwest of Spencer. At this time, the tornado was being observed by the University of Oklahoma&#x27;s &quot;Doppler on Wheels&quot; crew, whose mobile Doppler weather radar data showed up to 220 mph winds in the tornado only a few decameters above the ground.

This tornado carved a wide path directly across the town of Spencer between 8:38 and 8:44 pm CDT, destroying or damaging all but a few houses on the Northeast side of town, and blowing over the water tower. Several homes in town were swept from their foundations by the tornado. The tornado killed six people, injured 150 (which is more than one-third of the town residents), and destroyed most of the town&#x27;s 190 buildings. Many trees and power lines were downed, and vehicles were destroyed as well. 5 of the 6 fatalities occurred in an apartment building that collapsed. Damage was estimated at $18 million. The population of the town diminished soon after to less than half of what it was previous to the tornado, from 315 to 145 in April 1999.

==May 30–31 Southern Great Lakes derecho==

This derecho got its start from a developing low pressure system that moved into the northern Great Plains and Great Lakes. The derecho formed from the same storm system that spawned the Spencer, South Dakota Tornado, which killed six people. The supercell thunderstorm which produced that tornado transitioned into the derecho which killed another six people. It would become the most destructive natural disaster to hit the Upper Midwest in recent memory.

===Minnesota===
The most damage in Minnesota occurred at the northern edge in Sibley and McLeod Counties. Winds ranged from in those two counties.

After the derecho raced through Minnesota, tens of thousands of trees were blown down. There were 500,000 customers without power. Over 100 homes were destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Twenty-two people were injured. The derecho caused $50 million in damage in southern Minnesota and northern Wisconsin.

===Wisconsin===
The derecho raced across Wisconsin in only three hours killing one person in Washington County when a tree fell through the roof and onto her bed where she was sleeping. It injured 37 people in Wisconsin. Many utility companies and emergency customers said that this was the most damaging straight-line wind thunderstorm event in 100 years. Five thousand homes and businesses were damaged and 24 were destroyed.

An area of south-central, south-east, and east-central Wisconsin reported wind gusts of over from this thunderstorm complex with an all-time official state record gust of north-east of Watertown in Dodge County. As with other derechos like the July 4, 1977 blow-down in northern Wisconsin, there were other unofficial reports of higher winds as well as estimates of such, including winds of sustained for a number of minutes and gusts up to also in Dodge County and/or adjacent sections of Fond du Lac County.

The roar of the wind from the derecho was audible up to away as the storm traversed this region. Road signs and other metal structures were found thrown about and even violently twisted in the area of 100 mph-plus wind from north-east Dane County through Dodge and Fond du Lac and Washington counties—evidence of both straight-line winds and rotor downbursts were widespread in this area as well as many other points along the path of the storm, and the sound of wind and perhaps hail and the effects of infrasound from some parts of the storm complex was also reported. In the latter case, some people reported strange feelings of pressure, and dogs, cats, and raccoons went wild.

The derecho also caused boating accidents by generating a seiche on Lake Michigan which was reported to be around high as it first struck the Michigan coastline of Lake Michigan further north in Muskegon County.

===Central Great Lakes===
The storm raced through Michigan in only two hours at an average speed of . Four people were killed in Michigan, and 146 were injured. Total damage was estimated at $172 million (1998 dollars). 250 homes and 34 businesses were destroyed. In Grand Haven the Story &amp; Clark smokestack at the Piano Factory Condominiums was destroyed when the force of the high wind caused it to crumble, and trees collapsed all over the city, some falling onto roofs. Damage in Spring Lake was worse, due to a highly localized zone of higher winds. The Mill Pointe Condominiums suffered serious damage, including the collapse of one unit. Others were subsequently removed. A factory lost its roof in the storm, and a number of businesses were damaged severely, one beyond repair. Country Estates Mobile Home park also suffered serious damage. Extensive damage to Grandville (approximately inland) led to the city being closed off, with no traffic allowed to enter in the day after the derecho&#x27;s passage. A woman was killed in Pinconning, about north of Detroit, when a tree fell on her house.

This derecho would go on to break the record for biggest power outage ever in the state of Michigan (but later surpassed by the 2003 North America blackout). 860,000 people lost power, slightly more than the number from the Southern Great Lakes Derecho of 1991. It blew down five 345-kilovolt transmission towers owned by Consumers Energy.

A total of 13 counties in Central Lower Michigan were declared federal disaster areas.

One person drowned in Ontario when his boat turned over from the derecho&#x27;s strong winds. Buildings in Toronto lost numerous windows and significant damage was observed in areas such as Trenton, Napanee, Picton and Kingston. Heavy thunderstorm activity was also reported in Ottawa and Montreal, but without damage.

It caused $300,000 worth of damage in central New York before reforming into a tornado outbreak at around 11 am on May 31.

===Summary===
Overall, the derecho traveled from southern Minnesota to central New York in 15 hours at an average speed of . It became one of the most damaging derecho events in North America&#x27;s history, causing $300 million (1998 USD) in damage.

==May 31 New York and Pennsylvania tornadoes==
On Sunday, May 31, Friday&#x27;s cold front, which stalled over southern Pennsylvania, started moving quickly back northward as a warm front as strong low pressure approached the Great Lakes. North of the warm front, most of the Hudson Valley and Western New England were under a cool and stable marine air mass, as a result of southeast winds from the Atlantic Ocean. Around 8 am, the warm front was located roughly over the Mohawk River to central and northern Massachusetts, producing powerful thunderstorms. After the warm front&#x27;s passage, sunshine broke out and strong heating commenced across the Northeast with temperatures quickly rising from the 50s through the 70s into the 80s, and dewpoints skyrocketing from the lower 40s into the upper 60s. Surface winds began blowing from the southeast at around 30 mph, while the winds at mid-levels were from the southwest at 60 to 80 mph, and the winds at jetstream level were still ranging from 120 to 150 mph from the west. High levels of instability were present as well. This created an unusually highly sheared environment in the Northeast.

The Storm Prediction Center issued a High Risk for severe thunderstorms across Northern Pennsylvania, most of New York, Western Massachusetts and Western Vermont. A High Risk had never before been issued for the Northeastern United States, and hasn&#x27;t been since this event. This indicated an abnormally dangerous weather situation for this region of the country, a situation more common in the Plains States, Midwest and Deep South.

Around 1 pm, the Michigan derecho was moving into New York from Ontario and rapidly weakening. The decaying squall line broke apart into discrete convection over New York and Pennsylvania, which quickly re-intensified into tornadic supercells.

The most destructive tornado of the day was an F3 that tore through Mechanicville and the adjacent town of Stillwater. It caused major damage to Mechanicville&#x27;s old industrial section located on Route 4 and 32 along the Hudson River. One of the two historic smokestacks (visible from 2 miles away) was knocked down by the tornado. In 2005, the other smokestack and the conjoined building were bulldozed. The tornado was rated F3 (winds estimated at 200 MPH at the time) on the Fujita scale, and was iles) wide. In total, 70 homes and businesses were completely demolished, and hundreds more damaged. Extensive deforestation occurred along the path as well. 68 people were injured, but no loss of life occurred. Pink insulation was reported falling from the sky ahead of the tornado, in Valley Falls, New York, 12 miles east of Mechanicville. Film negatives from Mechanicville were reportedly found there as well.

Numerous other strong tornadoes touched down across upstate New York and Pennsylvania that evening, several of which reached F2 to F3 intensity. One F3 caused major damage in the city of Binghamton. The other F3 caused major damage in the village of Windsor. This outbreak was likely the most intense, widespread, and long duration severe weather event in modern New York state history. Other less intense tornadoes touched down in surrounding states.

<text>A domestic ice cream maker is a machine used to make small quantities of ice cream for personal consumption. Ice cream makers may prepare the mixture by employing the hand-cranking method or by employing an electric motor. The resulting preparation is often chilled through either pre-cooling the machine or by employing a machine that freezes the mixture.

An ice cream maker has to simultaneously freeze the mixture while it so as to aerate the mixture and keep the ice crystals small (less than 50 μm). As a result, most ice creams are ready to consume immediately. However, those containing alcohol must often be chilled further to attain a firm consistency.

== History ==
Around 1832, Augustus Jackson achieved fame for creating multiple ice cream recipes and pioneering a superior ice cream preparation technique by adding salt to the ice.

In 1843, Nancy M. (Donaldson) Johnson of Philadelphia received the first U.S. patent for a small-scale hand-cranked ice cream freezer. The ice cream freezer was a pewter cylinder.

Dubbed the &quot;Queen of Ices&quot;, Victorian English culinary entrepreneur Agnes Marshall was granted a patent for an ice cream machine that could freeze a pint of ice cream in five whole minutes.

== Process ==
Ice cream makers may prepare the mixture by employing the hand-cranking method or by employing an electric motor. The resulting preparation is often chilled through either pre-cooling the machine or by employing a machine that freezes the mixture. An ice cream maker has to simultaneously freeze the mixture while churning it so as to aerate the mixture and keep the ice crystals small (less than 50 μm). As a result, most ice creams are ready to consume immediately. However, those containing alcohol must often be chilled further to attain a firm consistency. Some machines—such as certain lower-priced countertop models—require the resulting mixture to be frozen for additional time after churning is complete.

== Models ==
=== Hand-cranked machines ===

Nancy Johnson patented the first hand-cranked model in 1843. William Young produced the machine as the &quot;Johnson Patent Ice-Cream Freezer&quot; in 1848.

Hand-cranked machines&#x27; ice and salt mixture must be replenished to make a batch of ice cream. Usually, rock salt is used. The salt causes the ice to melt and lowers the temperature in the process, due to freezing point depression. The temperature at which salt water freezes is lower than the temperature at which fresh water freezes. The saltwater does not freeze amid below-zero temperatures due to the salt content. The sub-freezing temperature helps slowly freeze the edible mixture, making the ice cream.

Some small manual units comprise a bowl with coolant-filled hollow walls. These have a volume of approximately one pint (500 ml). The paddle is often built into a plastic top. The mixture is poured into the frozen bowl and placed in a freezer. The paddles are hand-turned every ten minutes or so for a few hours until reaching the desired consistency and flavor.

=== Electric machines ===

There are four types of electric ice cream machines. Each has an electric motor that drives the bowl or the paddle to stir the mixture. The major difference between the four is how the cooling is performed.

==== Counter-top machines ====
Counter-top machines use a double-walled bowl with a solution between the walls (typically distilled water and urea) that freezes below . In a domestic freezer, this requires up to 24 hours before the machine is ready. Once frozen, the bowl is put into the machine, the mixture is added to the bowl, and the machine started. The paddles rotate, stirring the mixture as it gradually freezes through contact with the frozen bowl. After twenty to thirty minutes, the solution between the double walls thaws, and the ice cream freezes. This type of machine has the advantage of being relatively inexpensive; however, a pre-frozen bowl makes only one batch at a time. The bowl must be refrozen to make another batch. Multi-batches require extra bowls for the machine, which require extra freezer space.

==== Small freezer-unit machines ====

Small freezer-unit machines sit inside the freezer (or the freezer part of the refrigerator) and operate similar to a food processor in slow-motion. Every few seconds, the paddles stir the mixture to prevent formation of large ice crystals. When the ice cream sufficiently freezes, the paddles automatically stop rotating and lift. Since the mixture is cooled in the freezer, it takes longer to freeze than other ice cream makers, which work by placing the ice cream bowl in direct contact with the cooling element. A disadvantage is that the freezer door has to be closed over the flat cord, which is plugged into the nearest power outlet. However, some modern refrigerators have a built-in ice-cream maker as an accessory or a specialized electrical outlet for freezer-unit machines. It is not necessary to ¨pre¨-freeze this type of ice cream maker. However, some people feel that this type of machine produces a lower-quality ice cream because of its slow-motion method. Also available are cordless, battery-operated ice-cream makers that may be placed directly in the freezer, although as 

==== Built-in freezer machines ====

More expensive, and usually larger, machines have a freezing mechanism built in and do not require a bowl to be pre-chilled. A few minutes after starting the cooling system, the mixture can be poured in and the paddle started. As with coolant-bowl machines, ice cream is ready in twenty to thirty minutes depending on the quantity and recipe. These machines can be used immediately with no preparation, and they make any number of batches of ice cream without a delay between batches. Some of these machines cannot be moved without waiting twelve hours before use since moving the unit upsets coolant in the freezing system. These machines are normally kept permanently in one position ready for use making them impractical in smaller kitchens.

==== Ice-salt coolant machines ====

The fourth type of electric ice cream maker uses an outer tub filled with ice and salt for chilling using freezing point depression. An inner canister holds the ice cream mixture and churn and scraper assembly. A high-speed electric motor, geared at approximately 75rpm, drives a mechanism that simultaneously rotates the canister, counter-rotates the scraper, and holds the churn paddles stationary. As the canister turns, the ice cream mixture freezes against the inner wall of the canister. The counter-rotating scraper constantly removes the frozen product from the canister wall and returns it to the mixture. The continuing turning motion of the canister against the stationary churn paddles causes the mixture to become increasingly thick. Enough time, ice and salt produces a smooth &quot;hard packed&quot; ice cream.

<text>Bronk is an eroded crater that lies on the far side of the Moon, out of sight from the Earth. It lies to the southeast of the larger crater Kovalevskaya. Less than one crater diameter to the east-northeast is the smaller crater Bobone.

This crater has been worn and eroded by subsequent impacts. A small crater overlays the eastern rim, and much of the northeastern and northern parts of the rim have been disorganized by lesser impacts. There is a depression in the southern rim and the southwest rim has an outward bulge or slump. The interior floor is also rough and somewhat irregular, with several tiny craterlets marking the surface.

<text>Chai Soua Vang (born September 24, 1968), more commonly known as Chai Vang, is an American man who was convicted of first degree intentional homicide, having pleaded self-defense after allegedly being fired upon. Vang, a six-year veteran of the California National Guard, shot eight people while he was trespassing upon a hunting group in northern Wisconsin on November 21, 2004; six were killed and two were wounded.

Vang, who lived in Saint Paul, Minnesota at the time of the shootings, is imprisoned at the Anamosa State Penitentiary, as of 2006.

==Biography==
Vang was born in Laos to a family of Hmong descent. During the Laotian Civil War, Vang spent most of his childhood in a refugee camp in Thailand before he and his siblings relocated to the United States in 1980 and settled in California. Vang lived in Sacramento and enlisted in the California National Guard at age 21. He served from 1989 to 1995, during which time he was decorated with a Good Conduct medal and attained a sharpshooter qualification badge (mid-level, above the rank of Marksman). Sometime around , Vang and his family moved to St. Paul, Minnesota. Vang is the father of seven children. He is also a family shaman (&quot;txiv neeb&quot;) and was a hunting enthusiast.

On Christmas Eve 2001, police responded to a 911 call from Vang&#x27;s house, according to a Minneapolis Police Department report. The quarrel allegedly began when Vang said he wanted to go out and his wife, Xiong, did not want him to leave. Vang&#x27;s daughter, Kia, recalled running out of her room and seeing her father with a gun. Police arrested Chai Vang, but charges never were filed because, according to the police, Xiong did not cooperate with investigators. A few months later, Xiong moved with the couple&#x27;s five children to live with her parents in Milwaukee.

Vang&#x27;s second marriage ended after he allegedly nearly choked his wife to death for gambling away $3,000.

== Shootings ==

On the weekend of the shootings, Vang went out deer hunting with two friends and their two sons in northwest Wisconsin, a region where deer hunting is particularly popular, east of Birchwood, Wisconsin around the town of Meteor. Meteor extends over a large sparsely populated area. The land in the area is a mix of public and private. It is believed that Vang and his friends began their day on public land, but he later went onto a private tract of land.

On Sunday, November 21, a hunting party of about 15 people were in a cabin on this private land. Terry Willers, one of the two co-owners of the land, left the cabin and saw Vang sitting in a deer stand. Willers used a handheld radio to ask the people still in the cabin whether or not anyone should be in the stand. Upon receiving a response in the negative, he approached Vang and told him to leave the property and allegedly called Vang racial slurs. Vang then apologized and started moving south towards a trail through a forested area of the property. According to Terry Willers&#x27; testimony, &quot;As Bob got back on the radio and asked me where he was at and I said, uh, he&#x27;s heading south down on the food plot right now. I radioed in to the cabin that I had a tree-rat and I had chased him off.&quot; At that point five of the hunters from the cabin who had heard the radio message arrived at the tree stand. Lauren Hesebeck, a surviving victim, stated &quot;Bob had said I&#x27;m going to go talk to him to find out who he is, why he&#x27;s there, and make sure he doesn&#x27;t, you know, knows that he&#x27;s on private property and that he&#x27;s not welcomed there. Denny had said to me this ought to be interesting, let&#x27;s go and see what&#x27;s going on. We got in the back of it standing up (ATV), hanging on the rear bar.&quot; After following the directions given by Terry Willers, they proceeded to approach Vang further down the trail. Crotteau then suggested making a note of his hunting license number to make a report to the DNR and, according to Hesebeck&#x27;s testimony, Crotteau flipped over the hunting tag on Vang&#x27;s back to get his license number.

The events after the confrontation are disputed. A violent altercation broke out and four of the eight victims were shot in the back, and three of these four were hit by multiple rounds. Vang is believed to have fired about 20 rounds from a Saiga rifle chambered in 7.62×39mm, which was recovered by police. One of the wounded hunters died the next day, bringing the toll to six dead and two wounded. Vang raised his rifle in one smooth, continuous sweeping motion as he circled right, kneeled, and aimed at Terry Willers. Vang later said, “If I don’t shoot him, he would shoot me.” Hours after the shooting, Hesebeck told his wife that Willers did fire at Vang, though he later testified claiming that no one pointed a gun at or fired at Vang.

Vang&#x27;s first shot missed Willers as he ran and dove for cover, but Willers landed atop his rifle and couldn&#x27;t turn over before Vang&#x27;s second shot hit his lower left neck, neutralizing him. Vang instantly turned toward the men on their machines and shot Roidt; the round killed him before he fell, as his ATV, still in gear, moved slowly forward. Vang then shot and killed Drew. As the Crotteaus fled in fear, Vang fired three shots at Hesebeck at close range while chasing him around the ATV. The third round partially disemboweled Hesebeck, who fell and lay still.

Bob Crotteau fled and called the cabin on his walkie-talkie, to tell Laski to bring guns. While Vang&#x27;s first shot missed, a second hit and killed Bob Crotteau. Willers, meanwhile, had regained feeling in his fingers, and called the cabin for help.

By that time Vang was chasing Joey Crotteau, who fled down a trail. Vang sprinted to cut the corner to the trail, to close the gap, and shot him in the lower back at about 65 yards. Vang reloaded, and approached closer, as Crotteau struggled forward, and shot him again. Vang then closed in and shot him twice more from behind, including a final round into his head.

Vang, after reversing his blaze-orange jacket to its camo side, hid near a curve in the trail when he heard the ATV approaching. Thinking Jessica Willers and Laski were likely armed and looking for him, Vang waited until they passed. When he fired, the bullet struck Willers in the left buttock, and struck Laski, shattering his lower spine and abdomen. Vang ran over, shot Laski through the back, and then stepped behind Willers, and fired a shot through her neck.

Vang returned to the site of the first shootings to retrieve his scope. As he neared the site, he and Hesebeck came face to face. Vang said, “You&#x27;re not dead yet?” He raised his rifle and fired, as Hesebeck grabbed Willers’ rifle with his right hand and dove for cover. The shots went past over Hesebeck&#x27;s head.

Though he could point but not aim the rifle because of a wounded left arm, Hesebeck tried to shoot back. But when he pulled the trigger, the safety was still engaged. He dragged the unfamiliar rifle alongside his body to feel for the safety, and pushed it in. He pointed it again and fired once. He then heard a slight metallic sound from Vang&#x27;s rifle, and realized Vang was out of bullets.

Vang fled the scene on foot and discarded his remaining ammunition, later stating that he did not want to shoot anyone else. Vang eventually came across another hunter riding an ATV (who had no affiliation with the victims), and this hunter offered to give him a ride, eventually taking him to Vang&#x27;s cabin. Vang was arrested when he returned to his cabin five hours after the shooting. An officer waiting for Vang placed him into custody and transported him to the Sawyer County Jail. His bail was set at $2.5 million.

=== Victims ===
The victims were part of a group of about 15 people who made an annual opening-weekend trip to the Crotteau-Willers property. Among those killed were father and son Robert and Joey Crotteau and Willers&#x27; daughter Jessica Willers.

Those who were killed:

* Robert Crotteau, 42, hit center-mass.
* Joseph “Joey” Crotteau, 20, four hits center-mass.
* Alan Laski, 43, three hits center-mass.
* Mark Roidt, 28, single headshot.
* Jessica Willers, 27, two hits center-mass.
* Denny Drew, 55, single gutshot.

Those who survived:
* Lauren Hesebeck, 48, neck gunshot
* Terry Willers, 47, shoulder gunshot

== Investigation ==
There have been conflicting reports about what may have led to the shootings. According to subsequent oral statements by Vang, one of the local hunters, Terry Willers, took the first shot at him from about away, and therefore the shootings were in self-defense. No shell casing was ever recovered from Willers&#x27; gun even though during the trial Hesebeck admitted to firing a single shot later during the incident when Vang, noticing that Hesebeck was still alive, fired at him again. Hesebeck testified no shot was fired before Vang started shooting. Additional forensic analysis of Willers&#x27; gun was not performed by the local law enforcement which caused the court to take a break from trial. The statements of both Vang and Hesebeck state that Vang removed the scope from his rifle before firing his first shot. Vang stated that race was a factor, alleging that during the verbal dispute, some of the local hunters yelled out racial slurs at him such as &quot;chink&quot; and &quot;gook&quot;. On the stand, Hesebeck admitted that Robert Crotteau had called Vang a &quot;Hmong asshole.&quot; Hesebeck also admitted that he told law enforcement that Robert Crotteau had problems with trespassers in the past, specifically citing Hmong hunters, who often travel to Wisconsin from Minnesota to hunt. The term &quot;Mud Duck&quot; is often used in western Wisconsin to refer to Minnesota residents, similar to &quot;Cheesehead&quot; being used to describe Wisconsin residents. Willers used this term to describe Chai Vang when he radioed back to the cabin. Though the term does not necessarily have a racial connotation, the defense argued that it did, due to the fact that Willers and the others did not know at the time that Vang was from Minnesota.
The criminal complaint states that Vang shot four of the victims in the back, and Vang himself admits he shot one victim in the back. He also shot many of them multiple times. The prosecution made use of these facts in arguing against the claim of self-defense.

== Trial ==
The trial of Chai Soua Vang began Saturday, September 10, 2005, at the Sawyer County Courthouse in Hayward. Due to pre-trial publicity within the Twin Cities and Duluth-Superior media markets, twelve jurors and two alternates were selected from Dane County, and transported by bus approximately northwest to Sawyer County, where they were sequestered.

Vang told the jury he feared for his life and began firing only after another hunter&#x27;s shot nearly hit him. He detailed for the jurors how the other hunters approached him, and how he responded by shooting at each one. He says he shot two of the victims in the back because they were &quot;disrespectful.&quot; He recounted with clarity how he killed each victim. While saying on the stand, &quot;(he wished) it wasn&#x27;t happening,&quot; Vang contended that three of the hunters deserved to die:

&quot;Did Mr. [Robert] Crotteau deserve to die?&quot; Wisconsin Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Chai Soua Vang replied.

Vang further testified that Joseph Crotteau &quot;deserved to die&quot; because he accused Vang of giving him the finger and &quot;tried to cut in front of me to stop me from leaving&quot;, further saying that Alan Laski had provoked him by using a gun to threaten his life. Vang re-enacted his deeds while on the stand, using his hands and arms to imitate the motions of firing a rifle. Vang&#x27;s lawyers commented that some of his abnormal remarks were due to the language barrier. Therefore, when Vang responded affirmatively to the question that the Crotteaus and Laski &quot;deserved to die,&quot; he had misunderstood Lautenschlager&#x27;s question and had meant that the men contributed to the circumstances that led to their deaths.
=== Conviction ===
On September 16, 2005, Chai Soua Vang was found guilty of all six charges of first degree intentional homicide and three charges of attempted homicide. Vang&#x27;s public defender, Steve Kohn, noted that Vang faced verbal abuse and racial epithets in his confrontation with the hunters, and that the jury selected for the trial was all Caucasian, despite the jury selection pool including minorities. On November 8, 2005, he was sentenced to six consecutive life terms plus seventy years (forty for two counts of attempted homicide plus five additional years for each count of homicide in the first degree); a sentence of life without parole. At the time, Wisconsin was one of 12 states in the United States that did not have the death penalty.

<doc id="1207290" wikidata="Q1938265" url="?curid=1207290" title="Youthquake (album)">
<text>Youthquake is the second studio album by the English pop band Dead or Alive, released on 3 May 1985 by Epic Records. The album was their commercial breakthrough in Europe and the United States, due to its lead single &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot;, which was a No. 1 hit on the UK singles chart and a Top 20 hit on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Additional single releases from the album included &quot;Lover Come Back to Me&quot;, &quot;In Too Deep&quot; and &quot;My Heart Goes Bang (Get Me to the Doctor)&quot;. 

This was Dead or Alive&#x27;s first collaboration with the Stock Aitken Waterman production team. The recording was marked by tension and clashes between band and producers, which engineer Phil Harding alleges almost escalated to violence. &quot;Youthquake&quot; was re-released in the UK on compact disc in 1994, with the two bonus tracks that were previously included on the original CD and cassette versions of the album.

The album peaked at No. 9 on the UK Albums Chart and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales of over 100,000 copies. It also peaked at No. 31 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales over 500,000. In Canada, the album peaked at No. 8 and was certified platinum. The album cover was taken by Peruvian fashion and portrait photographer Mario Testino.

==Critical reception==
Upon its release the album received a mixed reception. &quot;Smash Hits&quot; Ian Cranna gave the album a favourable 8 out 10 rating, but criticised the album&#x27;s production which he found too often relegated the songs and the vocals to the background in favour of &quot;emotionless, clattering computer rhythms. Played loud, virtually every track could be a dancefloor favourite or potential hit: played at home, it takes ages for the songs to come through their unsympathetic surroundings.&quot;

In an unfavourable review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Rob Tannenbaum wrote: &quot;With layers of sleek sequencers and static percussion invoking the locked dance groove of disco, Youthquake maintains a high energy pace best suited for aerobics. Because without the dynamic production or provocative lyrics or even plain old good singing that recommend the best of its peers, this LP is like a night at Area – initially entertaining, occasionally sexy, but very suddenly a bore.&quot;

<doc id="1207292" wikidata="Q3964183" url="?curid=1207292" title="Solace (Xavier Rudd album)">
<text>Solace is the second album from Australian roots musician Xavier Rudd, released in Australia on 28 March 2004 and which debuted in the top twenty of the ARIA album chart on 5 April 2004. It is his first record distributed by a major label with distribution by Universal Music Australia. &quot;Solace″&quot;s success earned Rudd two ARIA Music Awards nominations for Best Breakthrough Artist (album) and Best Blues and Roots Album at the 2005 ceremony, but lost to Jet&#x27;s &quot;Get Born&quot; and John Butler Trio&#x27;s &quot;Sunrise Over Sea&quot;, respectively.

==Conception and production==
The album was recorded entirely on his own featuring his guitar, several didgeridoos, a wooden box, an array of slide and acoustic guitars and percussion instruments. It was recorded in Vancouver. His personal friend and producer, Todd Simko, helped him through the recording.

==Songs==
The second song, &quot;3 Degrees&quot; is a short track about a time where Rudd describes an event that took place in Nashville, Tennessee. The ninth song, &quot;A Fourth World&quot;, was played by Rudd in front of live crowd and told them he did not have a name for it yet. After the show a fan went up to him and said he thought he had a good name for the song. He said &quot;a fourth world&quot; because there is a third world, but &quot;there&#x27;s also a fourth world where people who don&#x27;t have an existence, who are sort of trapped.&quot;

The eleventh song, &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot;, is a cover of Bob Marley&#x27;s 1975 song. While on tour with Melissa Ferrick he was struck by her performance of &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot;. He decided to record his own version that would recapture the melancholy he experienced from hearing Melissa&#x27;s version. Two songs, &quot;Shelter&quot; and &quot;Let Me Be&quot;, were released as singles in Australia.

&quot;Let Me Be&quot; was ranked number 54 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2003, while &quot;Shelter&quot; was ranked 56 and &quot;Solace&quot; 59 on the Triple J Hottest 100, 2004.

<text>Sophisticated Boom Boom is the debut studio album by the English pop band Dead or Alive, released on 20 April 1984 by Epic Records. Featuring mostly synth-pop and dance elements, the album contains the band&#x27;s first UK top 40 single, a cover version of KC and the Sunshine Band&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s the Way (I Like It)&quot;. That song, along with &quot;Misty Circles&quot;, were hits on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The album was a minor success in the UK where it peaked at No. 29.

The original cassette version of the album was released with three bonus tracks. In 2007, the album was re-released on CD by Cherry Red Records with seven bonus tracks. The cover photograph was taken by Peter Ashworth and was inspired by the cover of Kate Bush&#x27;s 1978 studio album &quot;Lionheart&quot;. The original title for the album was &quot;Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know&quot;, but it was rejected by the label. It would later become the title of the band&#x27;s third studio album.

The title matches that of the 1965 song by The Shangri-Las.

<text>Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know is the third studio album by the English pop band Dead or Alive, released in December 1986 on Epic Records. Continuing their association with the Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW) production team, Dead or Alive scored several hit singles from this album, including &quot;Brand New Lover&quot; and &quot;Something in My House&quot;. In addition to an image of singer Pete Burns, the cover features one of the game walls at the Château de Raray, where some of the scenes for &quot;La Belle et la Bête&quot; were filmed. The cover photographer was Bob Carlos Clarke. The phrase &quot;Mad, Bad, and Dangerous to Know&quot; itself comes from a statement by Lady Caroline Lamb describing controversial English literary figure Lord Byron.

Production of the album was marked by arguments between the band and SAW, with the latter frustrated by the band&#x27;s refusal to branch into house music, and singer Pete Burns unwilling to hand over songwriting duties to the producers. Burns expressed frustration with his record company&#x27;s attitude to his single choices, complaining the label only relented on scheduling &quot;Brand New Lover&quot; for release after Bananarama had a hit with their Dead or Alive-inspired cover of &quot;Venus&quot;, and alleging they also refused to give &quot;Something in My House&quot; a Halloween release date.

While Burns claimed vicious studio arguments during production of the album made him ill, recording engineer Karen Hewitt stated the singer appeared to thrive on his often explosive and confrontational dynamic with Mike Stock and Matt Aitken during the album sessions. Fellow album engineer Yoyo described tensions as mostly good humoured and centred on artistic disagreements, rather than personal animosity.

<text>Sexual medicine or psychosexual medicine as defined by Masters and Johnsons in their classic Textbook of Sexual Medicine, is &quot;that branch of medicine that focuses on the evaluation and treatment of sexual disorders, which have a high prevalence rate.&quot; Examples of disorders treated with sexual medicine are erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, and prostate cancer. Sexual medicine often uses a multidisciplinary approach involving physicians, mental health professionals, social workers, and sex therapists. Sexual medicine physicians often approach treatment with medicine and surgery, while sex therapists often focus on behavioral treatments.

While literature on the prevalence of sexual dysfunction is very limited especially in women, about 31% of women report at least one sexual dysfunction regardless of age. About 43% of men report at least one sexual dysfunction, and most increase with age except for premature ejaculation.

== Scope ==
Sexual medicine addresses issues of sexual dysfunction, sex education, disorders of sex development, sexually transmitted infections, puberty, and diseases of the reproductive system. The field connects to multiple medical disciplines with varying degrees of overlap including reproductive medicine, urology, psychiatry, genetics, gynaecology, andrology, endocrinology, and primary care.

However, sexual medicine differs from reproductive medicine in that sexual medicine addresses disorders of the sexual organs or psyche as it relates to sexual pleasure, mental health, and well-being, while reproductive medicine addresses disorders of organs that affect reproductive potential.

== History ==
The concept of sexual medicine did not arise in North America until the latter half of the 20th century, specifically around the time of the sexual revolution during the 1960s and 70s where the baby boomer generation had an increase in birth control pill use. Prior to that, open discussion of sex was seen as taboo. Psychoanalytic theories about sexuality, such as those proposed by Sigmund Freud and Helene Deutsch, were considered highly controversial. It was not until the post-World War II baby boom era and the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s that sex, and subsequently sexual disorders, became a more accepted topic of discussion.

In fact, urologists were the first medical specialty to practice sexual medicine. Not only does their practice focus on the urinary tract (the kidneys, urinary bladder, and urethra), there is a large emphasis on male reproductive organs and male fertility. Today, sexual medicine has reached a wider range of medical specialties, as well as psychologists and social workers, to name a few.

What really opened the doors for societal normalcy of sexual medicine was the Massachusetts Male Aging Study performed in 1994 that clearly defined erectile dysfunction (ED) as a condition that affects a large population of American males. It also had reported that, if possible, men would be willing to improve their sexual performance if a medication was deemed to be safe. On March 27, 1998, sildenafil citrate was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ED. The approval of Sildenafil transformed the way America talked about a topic that was once very private before.

== Diagnosis ==
Sexual medicine plays a role in a wide range of medical specialties, from a primary care provider to a sexual health physician to a sexologist. A physician&#x27;s role in taking a sexual history is vital in diagnosing someone who presents with a sexual dysfunction.

There is some anxiety that arises when sex comes up for discussion, especially between a healthcare provider and an individual. It is reported that only 35% of primary care physicians have taken a sexual history and, due to this, there is a gap in achieving holistic healthcare. Clinicians fear individuals are not willing to share information, but in reality, it may be that the provider is shying away from the discussion. This steering away can be a result of lack of training, lack of structured tools and knowledge to assess a sexual history, and fears of offending individuals they are treating. Thus, knowing how to take an objective sexual history can help a clinician narrow down the pathogenesis of an individual&#x27;s sexual health problem.

Issues related to sexual or reproductive medicine may be inhibited by a reluctance of an individual to disclose intimate or uncomfortable information. Even if such an issue is on an individual&#x27;s mind, it is important that the physician initiates the subject. Some familiarity with the doctor generally makes it easier for people to talk about intimate issues such as sexual subjects, but for some people, a very high degree of familiarity may make an individual reluctant to reveal such intimate issues. When visiting a health care provider about sexual issues, having both partners of a couple present is often necessary, and is typically a good thing, but may also prevent the disclosure of certain subjects, and, according to one report, increases the stress level.

Taking a sexual history is an important component of sexual medicine when diagnosing an individual with a sexual dysfunction. A sexual history incorporates social, medical, and surgical information, and should touch on all factors that affect an individual&#x27;s sexuality. Essentially, it is a conversation between a health care provider and an individual that is geared towards obtaining information about the person&#x27;s sexual health status. If this is done properly, it will be easier for the physician to address concerns the individual may have. Some people may not be comfortable in sharing information, but it is the role of the physician to create a comfortable and non-judgemental, private environment for those they are working with to speak openly.

Sexual dysfunctions in men are often associated with testosterone deficiency. Signs and symptoms of testosterone deficiencies vary in each individual. Therefore, physical examinations could be done for men who suspect testosterone deficiencies to identify physical signs of the disorder. Common physical signs include fatigue, increased body fat, weight gain, muscle weakness, and depressed mood.

Laboratory tests may also be used to assist with diagnosis, such as blood glucose levels, lipid panel, and hormonal profile. Additionally, diagnostic categories of sexual disorders are listed in both the ICD-10 and DSM-5. ICD-10 categorizes the disorders by sexual desire, sexual arousal, orgasm, and sexual pain, while DSM-5 categorizes the dysfunctions by gender, substance/medication induced, paraphilic, or gender dysphoria.

== Risk factors for sexual dysfunction ==
The risk of developing a sexual dysfunction increases with age in both men and women. There are several risk factors that are associated with sexual dysfunction in both men and women. Cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, genitourinary disease, psychological/psychiatric disorders, and presence of a chronic disease are all common risk factors for developing a sexual dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is a risk factor that is specifically associated with erectile dysfunction. Past family medical history of sexual dysfunction disorders are also a risk factor for development.

Sociocultural factors may also contribute to sexual problems, such as personal, religious, or cultural beliefs about sex. Personal well-being may also impact an individual&#x27;s sexual activity. Stress and fatigue may contribute to developing a decreased sexual response or interest. Fatigue may result from poor sleep or another underlying medical problem. Current or past sexual abuse, whether physical or emotional, is also a risk factor for developing sexual problems.

== Disorders of sexual function ==
Sexual dysfunctions are sexual problems that are continuous in a person&#x27;s life, adding stress and difficulty to personal relationships. Congenital or acquired, these conditions refer to any pathology which interferes with the perception of satisfactory sexual health. Varied conditions include absent sexual organs, hermaphrodite and other genetic malformations, or trauma such as amputation or lacerations.

Examples of conditions which may be treated by specialists in this field include:

Female

* Vaginismus
* Genito-pelvic pain-penetration disorder
* Vulvodynia
* Imperforate hymen
* Vaginal septum
* Vaginitis
* Endometriosis
* Atrophic vaginitis
*Vaginal yeast infection
* Pelvic floor dysfunction

Male

* Premature ejaculation
* Delayed ejaculation
* Erectile dysfunction
* Retrograde ejaculation
* Anejaculation 
* Hard Flaccid Syndrome

Non-exclusive

* Lack or loss of sexual desire (Libido)
* Hypoactive sexual desire disorder
* Lack of sexual enjoyment
* Sexual arousal disorder
* Failure of sexual response
* Anorgasmia
* Hypersexuality
* Dyspareunia
* Substance or medication induced sexual dysfunction
* Painful orgasm
* Chronic pelvic pain
* Sexually transmitted infection
* Hypogonadism
*Sexuality issues
*Pelvic floor dysfunction

== Treatment ==
Once a diagnosis of sexual dysfunction has been made, treatment is often integrative and individualized. Sexual medicine experts aim to discover both the physical and psychologic factors that are the cause of an individual&#x27;s sexual dysfunction.

===Male sexual dysfunction===

The most common male sexual dysfunction disorders are erectile dysfunction (ED), low libido, and ejaculatory dysfunction.

Once etiology and cardiovascular risk factors for ED have been identified, lifestyle or non-pharmacological therapy can be initiated to mitigate risk factors. As of 2018, the American Urological Association (AUA) ED guidelines recommend shared medical decision-making between patient and provider over first-, second-. and third-line therapies. However, phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors, such as sildenafil (Viagra) and tadalafil (Cialis), are often recommended due to their favorable efficacy and side effect profile and work by increasing the lifespan of the vasodilator nitric oxide in the corpus cavernosum. Alternative treatments for ED are the use of vacuum-assisted erection devices, intracavernosal injection or intraurethral administration of alprostadil (prostaglandin E1), and surgery if necessary.

Treatment for decreased libido is often directed towards the cause of the low libido. Low levels of hormones such as testosterone, serum prolactin, TSH, and estradiol can be associated with low libido, and thus hormone replacement therapy is often used to restore the levels of these hormones in the body. Low libido can also be secondary to use of medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and so reduction of dose of the SSRI is used to improve libido. Additionally, low libido due to psychological causes is often approached with psychotherapy.

Similarly, treatment of ejaculatory dysfunction such as premature ejaculation is dependent on the etiology. SSRIs, topical anesthetics, and psychotherapy are commonly used to treat premature ejaculation.

=== Female sexual dysfunction ===
Similar to male sexual dysfunctions, sexual problems in women are also prevalent; however, they differ in the kind of dysfunction. For example, males have more problems related to function of their reproductive organs, where as for women it is more common to experience psychological problems, like lack of a sexual desire and more pain related to sexual activity. In 2008, 40% of U.S. women reported they were experiencing low sexual desire.

Treatment approach is dependent on the type of dysfunction the women is experiencing.

The treatment of female sexual dysfunction is varied as multiple causes are often identified. Following evaluation of symptoms and diagnosis, the woman&#x27;s goals for treatment are determined and used to track progress. Health professionals are also trained to include the woman&#x27;s sexual partner in the treatment plan, including noting any sexual dysfunction of the partner. Referral of the woman or couple to a sex therapist is also common to increase communication and expression of concerns and desires. Finally, conditions associated with the documented sexual dysfunction are simultaneously treated and included in the treatment plan.

Non-pharmacologic treatment for female sexual dysfunction can include lifestyle modifications, biofeedback, and physical therapy. Pharmacologic therapy can include topical treatments, hormone therapy, antidepressants, and muscle relaxants.

In fact, low sexual desire is the most common sexual problem for women at any age. With this, sexual ideas and thoughts are also absent. Counseling sessions addressing changes the couple can make can improve a woman&#x27;s sexual desire. Other ways to treat include: trying a new sex position, using a sexual toy or device, having sex in an unusual location. Also, a woman enjoying her time with her partner outside of the bedroom, on a &quot;date night&quot;, can improve the relationship inside the bedroom.

Sexual pain is another large factor for women, caused by Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM), which includes hypoestrogenic vulvovaginal atrophy, provoked pelvic floor hypertonus, and vulvodynia. These can all be treated with lubricants and moisturizers, estrogen, and ospemifene.

===Psychiatric barriers===

Sexual disorders are common in individuals with psychiatric disorders. Depression and anxiety disorders are strongly connected with reduced sex drive and a lack of sexual enjoyment. These individuals experience a decreased sexual desire and sexual aversion. Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, and eating disorders, are all associated with an increased risk of sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction of sexual activity. Many factors can induce sexual dysfunction in individuals with psychiatric disorders, such as the effects of antipsychotics and antidepressants. Treatment may include switching medications to one with less sexual dysfunction side effects, decreasing the dose of the medication to decrease these side effects, or psychiatric counseling therapy.

===Lifestyle barriers===

General health greatly relates to sexual health in both males and females. Sexual medicine specialists take into consideration unhealthy lifestyle habits that may contribute to the sexual quality of life of individuals who are experiencing sexual dysfunction. Obesity, tobacco smoking, alcohol, substance abuse, and chronic stress are all lifestyle factors that may have negative impacts on sexual health and can lead to the development of sexual dysfunctions. Both obesity and tobacco smoking have negative impacts on cardiovascular and metabolic function, which contributes to the development of sexual dysfunctions. Chronic smoking causes erectile dysfunction in men due to a decrease in vasodilation of vascular endothelial tissue. Alcohol dependence can lead to erectile dysfunction in mend and reduced vaginal lubrication in women. Long term substance abuse of multiple recreational drugs (MDMA, cocaine, heroin, amphetamine), leads to a decrease in sexual desire, inability to achieve orgasm, and a reduction of sexual satisfaction. Chronic stress may potentially contribute to sexual dysfunction, as it can induce high levels of cortisol, which may cause harmful effects in if it remains altered long term. High levels of cortisol have been shown to cause a reduction in gonadic steroids and adrenal androgens. Studies have shown that these steroids and adrenal androgens have effects on genital arousal as well as sexual desire.

Sexual medicine experts are responsible for promoting healthy lifestyle habits in order to help prevent sexual dissatisfaction. Adoption of healthy lifestyle routines include: avoiding drugs, smoke, and excessive alcohol, as well as incorporating regular physical activity accompanied by a balanced diet and use of stress-management strategies. These habits can be proposed before trying to incorporate pharmacological therapies and/or psychiatric therapies.

== Sexual dysfunction in transgender persons ==
Limited research has been performed on sexual dysfunction in those who are transgender, but preliminary research suggests that initiating a sexual relationship is difficult for some. One recent study published in the &quot;Journal of Sexual Medicine&quot; surveyed 518 transgender individuals about sexual dysfunction and disturbances and reported that difficulty initiating sexual encounters and difficulties achieving orgasm were the most prevalent sexual dysfunctions experienced in the study sample.

== Challenges ==
While the awareness of sexual health importance has increased in regards to individuals&#x27; general health and well-being, there is still a taboo that follows sexual health. The perception of sexual health varies among different cultures, as the notion is tied with many cultural norms, religion, laws, traditions, and many more. Sexual medicine is a unique component of the medical practice that has its own challenges. The main obstacle that stands between these discussions have been reported as the lack of education regarding sexual issues in individuals. The discussion of sexual health and taking a sexual history faces barriers as physicians infrequently address these topics in visits, and individuals are reluctant to discuss openly due to the perception that it is the physician&#x27;s duty to initiate the topic and fears that the conversation will make the physician uncomfortable.

Another challenge in sexual medicine is that in a standard process of drug discovery and development, human tissue and cells are not used in testing the candidate drug. Instead, animal models are often used to study sexual function, pathophysiology of diseases that cause sexual dysfunction, and new drugs. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships are studied in animal models to test the safety and efficacy of candidate drugs. With animal models, there is a limitation to understanding sexual dysfunction and sexual medicine, as the results achieved can only mount to predictions.

Identification and treatment of female sexual dysfunctions are also a challenge as women often encounter difficulty within multiple disorders and sexual phases. The various sexual phases that are encompassed within female sexual dysfunctions (FSD) include hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD), female orgasmic disorder (FOD) and female sexual pain disorders (FPD). Because many of these domains overlap, it is difficult to identify the target of treatment and many limitations are placed in the approach for research. Risk factors for female sexual dysfunctions were observed to be embedded with biopsychosocial aspects in epidemiological studies such as depression, urinary tract symptoms, cancer and cancer treatment, relationship problems, and menopausal transition. As a result, a multidimensional approach must be taken in the identification and treatment of female sexual dysfunctions.

The issue of psychological dilemmas that are associated with sexual dysfunctions is another challenge that is faced in sexual medicine. There are many psychological aspects that are tied in with sexual dysfunctions. Despite much of sex therapy originating from psychological and cognitive-behavioral practices, many of the psychological dynamics have been lost in the sexual medicine protocols. Approaching from a psychological and existential perspective helps link the understanding between sexual function and sexual dysfunction in the individual. Because the psychological aspects underneath the sexual distress are not being addressed within sexual therapy and treatments are mostly focused on the specific symptoms in sexual medicine, there are many situations where individuals still experience disappointment and dissatisfaction within sexual activities despite the dysfunction being resolved.

<text>Enchantment is an English language fantasy novel by American writer Orson Scott Card. First published in 1999, the novel is based on the Ukrainian version of &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; and other folk tales. Various forms of magic, potions, and immortal deities also play an important role in the story.

== Plot ==
The protagonist and narrator is Ivan Smetski, a young Ukrainian-American linguist who specializes in Old Church Slavonic, a language from 10th-century Ruthenia. In 1992, Ivan returns to his native town of Kyiv to pursue additional graduate studies. While there he re-discovers the body of a woman that he had seen as a child, apparently sleeping in the woods. He awakens her with a kiss, and she tells him, in Old Church Slavonic, that she is Katerina, a princess of the kingdom of Taina.

Transported back to the 10th century, Ivan follows Katerina back to Taina where he finds the Christian kingdom terrorized by the traditional Russian arch-villainess Baba Yaga. Ivan and Katerina marry and escape back to the 20th century to avoid the machinations of Baba Yaga, who has enslaved a god and laid claim to Taina&#x27;s throne, and the &quot;druzhinnik&quot; Dimitri who covets the throne. Baba Yaga&#x27;s magical powers, however, allow her to follow Ivan and Katerina to modern times.

Back in Ukraine, Ivan discovers that his cousin is in reality the immortal god Mikola Mozhaiski. Returning to the United States, Ivan further discovers that his mother is a magic user, with the same powers as Katerina. After Katerina discovers Dimitri&#x27;s plot through scrying, Ivan and Katerina return to Taina, deftly avoiding Baba Yaga who magically &quot;skyjacks&quot; their intended Boeing 747 back to the 10th century. Returning to Taina, Ivan and Katerina confront Dimitri, the enslaved god, and Baba Yaga. Though the Castle of Taina is destroyed, the two emerge victorious. They and their children split the rest of their days between the modern world and Taina.

==Creation and inspiration==
In a 1998 interview given during work on the novel, Card stated that he had realized he knew little about Slavic history and suggested that the novel was inspired by extensive research in the area. In 2008, Card also credited singer/songwriter Bruce Cockburn&#x27;s album &quot;The Charity of Night&quot; as an influence on his writing of the book. In the same article, he stated that he believed &quot;Enchantment&quot; might be his best novel.

<text>Fighter Squadron 213 (VF-213)-(VFA-213)
also known as the Blacklions, is a renowned United States Navy fighter squadron. Established in 1955, the squadron operated a variety of aircraft over its history, beginning with the McDonnell F2H Banshee. Subsequent aircraft included the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II and the iconic Grumman F-14 Tomcat, which they flew until their conversion to the F/A-18F Super Hornet.

==History==
===1950s===

Fighter Squadron Two One Three (VF-213) was established on 22 June 1955 at NAS Moffett Field, California. The first cruise was aboard flying the F2H Banshee. When they returned, they transitioned to the F4D Skyray which they flew for two deployments on . They then transitioned to the F3H Demon, which gave the squadron the capability to fire the newly deployed AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile. VF-213 deployed next for a third cruise aboard USS &quot;Lexington&quot;.

===1960s===

In June 1961, VF-213 moved to NAS Miramar, which became their home for the next 36 years. Three years later, in February 1964, VF-213 accepting the first of their new F-4B Phantom IIs.

===Vietnam War===
In November 1965, VFA-213 joined Attack Carrier Air Wing 11 (CVW-11) and made 9 deployments to Vietnam and the Western Pacific aboard as follows:

*From 17 October 1963 to 20 July 1964, equipped with F-4Bs.
*From 19 October 1965 to 13 June 1966. On 28 April F-4B #150645 was hit by antiaircraft fire over North Vietnam, both crewmen ejected successfully and were rescued. On 18 May F-4B #152257 was hit by antiaircraft fire near the Mu Gia Pass, both crewmen ejected successfully and were rescued.
*From 5 November 1966 to 19 June 1967. On 20 December a squadron aircraft and one from VF-114 shot down two Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force (VPAF) Antonov An-2 with AIM-7 Sparrow missiles. On 4 February F-4B #153007 was hit by antiaircraft fire over North Vietnam, both crewmen LT Donald Thompson and LT Allan Collamore were killed, their remains were identified in February 2001.
*From 18 November 1967 to 28 June 1968.
*From 30 December 1968 to 4 September 1969. On 3 July F-4B #153015 was lost, both crewmen ejected successfully and were rescued.
*From 6 November 1970 to 17 July 1971, reequipped with F-4Js.
*From 17 February to 20 November 1972. On 18 June F-4J #157273 was hit by antiaircraft fire, both crewmen ejected successfully and were rescued.
*From 23 November 1973 to 9 July 1974.
*From 21 May to 15 December 1975.

===1970s===
In September 1976, VF-213 began the transition to the F-14A Tomcat. The first cruise with the F-14 was with CVW-11 aboard USS &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; in October 1977. After the &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; cruise, the carrier air wing switched to and took part in two Mediterranean cruises in 1979 with John Monroe &quot;Hawk&quot; Smith as CO and 1981.

===1980s===
In December 1981, VF-213 added a new mission as they began training with the Tactical Air Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS) and in September 1982, VF-213 deployed aboard . During Indian Ocean operations, the squadron achieved a new milestone by flying the longest Tomcat flight from a carrier on a TARPS mission.

In 1985, they were mobilized for the filming of Top Gun on the for takeoffs &amp; landings and AIM-9 Sidewinder &amp; AIM-7 Sparrow firing scenes.

On 24 January 1986 they were deployed with to the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean, where VF-213 often intercepted Soviet and Indian aircraft. During this deployment, tensions between the U.S. and Libya escalated, necessitating the decision to move USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; through the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean Sea. Upon arrival in the Gulf of Sidra CVW-11 aircraft flew patrols for two months, although encounters with Libyan aircraft were rare. The ship transited the Strait of Gibraltar and around the Cape of Good Hope before continuing onto Perth, Australia and across the Pacific to their home port.

1988 saw VF-213 flying cover over reflagged oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and participating in Operation Praying Mantis. In 1990 VF-213 and the rest of the air wing switched aircraft carriers to . The first cruise on USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; was a six-week transit from NAS Norfolk to NAS Alameda, via Cape Horn.

The squadron won the &quot;BOOLA BOOLA&quot; award in March 1989 for their professional completion of all missile test firings. In late 1989, VF-213 and CVW-11 went around the world on USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; for a WESTPAC deployment ending at NAS Norfolk for refurbishment. In December 1989, the squadron participated in Operation Classic Resolve on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, providing support for the Philippine government during a coup attempt.

===1990s===

The squadron deployed to WestPac on USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; in May 1991 in support of UN sanctions against Iraq. VF-213 flew combat air patrol and TARPS missions, recording the devastation of Kuwait oil fields. In 1993, VF-213 became the sole F-14 squadron on &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;. That same year, VF-213 flew in support of Operation Restore Hope in Somalia and Operation Southern Watch over Iraq.

Kara Hultgreen, the first qualified female F-14 pilot in the US Navy, was assigned to VF-213, and on 25 October 1994, her F-14 crashed while on approach to USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;. Both she and her RIO ejected, but only the RIO survived.

The 1995 WestPac cruise again saw the squadron flying over the skies of southern Iraq. In 1996, VF-213 moved to USS &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; for the 1996–1997 WESTPAC deployment. During this deployment VF-213 fired twenty six AIM-54 Phoenix and six AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles, including one event where six planes launched twelve Phoenix missiles. These mass firings were conducted to reduce the numbers of older Phoenix missiles in inventory, as they were being removed from service.

After the 1997 cruise, VF-213 moved from NAS Miramar to NAS Oceana and transitioned to the F-14D Super Tomcat, becoming the fourth F-14 squadron to receive the D model.

In 1998 they moved to , and began work-ups for their next cruise. During the 1998-1999 deployment, VF-213 was the first squadron to fire an AIM-54C Phoenix with the aircrew on night vision goggles. Two months into the deployment, VF-213 participated in Operation Desert Fox, which was the Navy&#x27;s largest combat evolution since the Gulf War. This successful deployment included the longest combat line period in over 25 years. F-14Ds from VF-213, as well as the rest of the embarked carrier air wing aboard USS &quot;Carl Vinson&quot;, joined other US air assets in the final strikes of that operation. Highlights of the cruise included the execution of 19 strikes, dropping 20 laser-guided bombs, supporting 11 combined strikes, flying 70 missions, and logging 230 combat sorties, including 45 reconnaissance missions imaging more than 580 targets.
On 5 January 1999, two F-14Ds on patrol over Iraq were directed to intercept two Iraqi MiG-25s south of the &quot;no fly zone&quot;. The Tomcats fired two AIM-54 missiles, the first ever Phoenix combat-launch by the US Navy. The Iraqi jets turned north and the missiles fell short of their targets. VF-213/CVW-11 returned home in the spring of 1999.

===2000s===
After the September 11 attacks, USS &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; with CVW-11 was the second carrier battle group after Enterprise on station in the North Arabian Sea, preparing for attacks against Afghanistan. On 7 October 2001 during a CVW-11 strike, VF-213 dropped the first bombs of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) on an SA-3 site near Kabul International Airport. VF-213 also conducted reconnaissance, utilizing their TARPS pods, and also provided laser weapon guidance for F/A-18 Hornets and GPS weapons coordinates for Hornets and USAF strike aircraft. During the ten weeks VF-213 were supporting OEF they flew over 500 combat sorties, over 2600 combat flight hours and expended 435,000 pounds of ordnance and provided reconnaissance with their TARPS pods. VF-213 was also the first F-14 unit to use its internal 20 mm cannon in combat during the Battle of Mazar e Sharif VF-213 received the 2001 Commander Naval Air Pacific Fleet Battle &quot;E&quot;, Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Safety &quot;S&quot;, Clifton Award and the Commander Fighter Wing Atlantic Golden Wrench for their performance in 2001.

After the 2001 cruise ended in 2002, VF-213 changed air wings from CVW-11 to CVW-8. On 22 March 2003, VF-213 deployed aboard to the Mediterranean Sea in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. During the war VF-213 would fly 198 strike, combat air patrol and ground forces support missions, delivering 102 laser-guided bombs and 94 JDAM bombs.
VF-213 was paired up with VF-31 for the 2005–2006 final F-14 Tomcat cruise on board USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;. During the cruise, VF-213 and VF-31 received ROVER upgrades to their aircraft, enabling them to transmit real-time images from their LANTIRN sensor to ground operators. VF-31 and 213 collectively completed 1,163 combat sorties, and dropped 9,500 pounds of ordnance during reconnaissance, surveillance, and close air support missions in support of OIF.

On 10 March 2006, VF-213 returned to NAS Oceana after the final F-14 cruise. All 22 Tomcats flew together in a wedge formation over NAS Oceana.

VF-213 began their transition/downgrade to the F/A-18F Super Hornet in April 2006 and was re-designated VFA-213 on 2 April 2006. VFA-213 was the first Super Hornet squadron to fly AESA-equipped Super Hornets. VFA-213 became the first squadron to receive Dual-Cockpit Cueing System for both pilot and naval flight officer, retrofitted with an aft cockpit Joint Helmet Mounted Cueing System (JHMCS), on 18 May 2007.

On 13 May 2008 an F/A-18F from the squadron operating from USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; accidentally dropped a 500-pound laser-guided bomb outside of the Pinecastle bombing range near the Ocala National Forest. The bomb explosion started a wildfire which burned of vegetation. No one was injured in the blaze, but the emergency response cost $342,946. A Navy investigation determined that technical misunderstandings and crew fatigue contributed to the mishap. The two crew members of the jet were later returned to flying status after a board review.

VFA-213, along with CVW-8 and USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;, participated in Joint Task Force Exercise 08-4 Operation Brimstone off the coast of North Carolina between 21 and 31 July 2008. The British carrier , the amphibious assault ship with associated units, the Brazilian Navy frigate &quot;Greenhalgh&quot;, and the French submarine also participated in the event.

On 8 September 2008, VFA-213 and the rest of CVW-8 deployed on board USS &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot; on a regularly scheduled deployment. On 4 October the &quot;Roosevelt&quot; Carrier Group arrived in Cape Town, South Africa, the first visit by a US aircraft carrier since 1967 and three days later the carrier left Cape Town. CVW-8 and CVN-71 supported Operation Enduring Freedom and flew more than 3,100 sorties and dropped more than 59,500 pounds of ordnance while providing close air support for ISAF-forces in Afghanistan.

===2010s===
On 11 May 2011, the squadrons of CVW-8 embarked on &#x27;s maiden deployment, scheduled to conduct operations in the US 5th and 6th Fleet areas of operations.

On 27 January 2017, VFA-213 departed on a combat deployment in support of Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), embarked on board USS &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot;. From 10 February 2017 to 9 March 2017, the command conducted OIR combat operations from the Mediterranean Sea. VFA-213 resumed combat operations on 23 March 2017 from the Persian Gulf until 22 May 2017.

In January 2018, VFA-213 participated in the initial flight deck certification for the US Navy&#x27;s newest aircraft carrier, .

On 14 March 2018, a Super Hornet from VFA-213 crashed near Key West killing the pilot and naval flight officer.

During April and May 2018, the squadrons of CVW-8 conducted joint operations with French Naval Forces out of NAS Oceana. Following those operations, the air wing and French aircraft embarked on USS &quot;George H. W. Bush&quot;, conducting strike missions.

In September 2018, VFA-213 attended the Naval Weapons Systems Evaluation Program (NWSEP) out of Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, with a five aircraft detachment. During the detachment, VFA-213 employed 19 air-to-air missiles, including nine AIM-7 Sparrows, seven AIM-9M Sidewinders, one AIM-9X Sidewinder, and two AIM-9X Block II Sidewinders. Subsequently, the command earned the 2018 Commander, Naval Air Forces Atlantic Grand Slam award for demonstrating the highest capability to maintain and utilize air-to-air missile weapons systems.

==In popular culture==

VF-213 is prominently featured and referenced in the movie &quot;Top Gun&quot;, which opens with footage of F-14s from VF-213 and VF-114 taking off on the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. A fictional depiction of VF-213 appears in the movie as the squadron of characters Tom &quot;Iceman&quot; Kazansky and Ron &quot;Slider&quot; Kerner (played by Val Kilmer and Rick Rossovich respectively). Despite the fictional squadron&#x27;s designation, it uses the insignia design of VFA-25, a squadron which never flew the F-14 in real life.

In the Seinfeld episode, The Busboy, the Busboy is wearing a VF-213 T shirt.

<doc id="1207392" wikidata="Q928960" url="?curid=1207392" title="Streamline Moderne">
<text>Streamline Moderne is an international style of Art Deco architecture and design that emerged in the 1930s. Inspired by aerodynamic design, it emphasized curving forms, long horizontal lines, and sometimes nautical elements. In industrial design, it was used in railroad locomotives, telephones, buses, appliances, and other devices to give the impression of sleekness and modernity.

In France, it was called the &quot;style paquebot&quot;, or &quot;ocean liner style&quot;, and was influenced by the design of the luxury ocean liner SS &quot;Normandie&quot;, launched in 1932.

==Influences and origins==

As the Great Depression of the 1930s progressed, Americans saw a new aspect of Art Deco, i.e., streamlining, a concept first conceived by industrial designers who stripped Art Deco design of its ornament in favor of the aerodynamic pure-line concept of motion and speed developed from scientific thinking. The cylindrical forms and long horizontal windowing in architecture may also have been influenced by constructivism, and by the New Objectivity artists, a movement connected to the German Werkbund. Examples of this style include the 1923 Mossehaus, the reconstruction of the corner of a Berlin office building in 1923 by Erich Mendelsohn and Richard Neutra. The Streamline Moderne was sometimes a reflection of austere economic times; sharp angles were replaced with simple, aerodynamic curves, and ornament was replaced with smooth concrete and glass.

The style was the first to incorporate electric light into architectural structure. In the first-class dining room of the SS &quot;Normandie&quot;, fitted out 1933–35, twelve tall pillars of Lalique glass, and 38 columns lit from within illuminated the room. The Strand Palace Hotel foyer (1930), preserved from demolition by the Victoria and Albert Museum during 1969, was one of the first uses of internally lit architectural glass, and coincidentally was the first Moderne interior preserved in a museum.

==Architecture==

Streamline Moderne appeared most often in buildings related to transportation and movement, such as bus and train stations, airport terminals, roadside cafes, and port buildings. It had characteristics common with modern architecture, including a horizontal orientation, rounded corners, the use of glass brick walls or porthole windows, flat roofs, chrome-plated hardware, and horizontal grooves or lines in the walls. They were frequently white or in subdued pastel colors.

An example of this style is the Aquatic Park Bathhouse in the Aquatic Park Historic District, in San Francisco. Built beginning in 1936 by the Works Progress Administration, it features the distinctive horizontal lines, classic rounded corners railing and windows of the style, resembling the elements of ship. The interior preserves much of the original decoration and detail, including murals by artist and color theoretician Hilaire Hiler. The architects were William Mooser Jr. and William Mooser III. It is now the administrative center of Aquatic Park Historic District.

The Normandie Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which opened during 1942, is built in the stylized shape of the ocean liner SS &quot;Normandie&quot;, and displays the ship&#x27;s original sign. The Sterling Streamliner Diners in New England were diners designed like streamlined trains.

Another example is Hollywood, California&#x27;s Julian Medical Building, which has been described as a &quot;landmark&quot;, &quot;an architectural masterpiece&quot;, and &quot;one of the crowning achievements of Streamline Moderne.&quot; The building&#x27;s distinctive features include a rounded Moderne corner, windswept tower, and pylon-separated horizontally-reinforced windows.

Although Streamline Moderne houses are less common than streamline commercial buildings, residences do exist. The Lydecker House in Los Angeles, built by Howard Lydecker, is an example of Streamline Moderne design in residential architecture. In tract development, elements of the style were sometimes used as a variation in postwar row housing in San Francisco&#x27;s Sunset District.

==Paquebot style==

In France, the style was called &quot;Paquebot&quot;, meaning ocean liner. The French version was inspired by the launch of the ocean liner &quot;Normandie&quot; in 1935, which featured an Art Deco dining room with columns of Lalique crystal. Buildings using variants of the style appeared in Belgium and in Paris, notably in a building at 3 boulevard Victor in the 15th arrondissement, by the architect Pierre Patout. He was one of the founders of the Art Deco style. He designed the entrance to the Pavilion of a Collector at the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts, the birthplace of the style. He was also the designer of the interiors of three ocean liners, the &quot;Ile-de-France&quot; (1926), the &quot;L&#x27;Atlantique&quot; (1930), and the &quot;Normandie&quot; (1935). Patout&#x27;s building on Avenue Victor lacked the curving lines of the American version of the style, but it had a narrow &quot;bow&quot; at one end, where the site was narrow, long balconies like the decks of a ship, and a row of projections like smokestacks on the roof. Another 1935 Paris apartment building at 1 Avenue Paul Doumer in the 16th arrondissement had a series of terraces modelled after the decks of an ocean liner.

The Flagey Building was built on the Place Eugène Flagey in Ixelles (Brussels), Belgium, in 1938, in the &quot;paquebot&quot; style, and has been nicknamed &quot;Packet Boat&quot; or &quot;paquebot&quot;. It was designed by , and selected as the winning design in an architectural competition to create a building to house the former headquarters of the Belgian National Institute of Radio Broadcasting (INR/NIR). The building was extensively renovated, and in 2002, it reopened as a cultural centre known as Le Flagey.

==Automobiles==

The defining event for streamline moderne design in the United States was the 1933–34 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, which introduced the style to the general public. The new automobiles adapted the smooth lines of ocean liners and airships, giving the impression of efficiency, dynamism, and speed. The grills and windshields tilted backwards, cars sat lower and wider, and they featured smooth curves and horizontal speed lines. Examples include the 1934 Chrysler Airflow and the 1934 Studebaker Land Cruiser. The cars also featured new materials, including bakelite plastic, formica, Vitrolight opaque glass, stainless steel, and enamel, which gave the appearance of newness and sleekness.

Other later examples include the 1950 Nash Ambassador &quot;Airflyte&quot; sedan with its distinctive low fender lines, as well as Hudson&#x27;s postwar cars, such as the Commodore, that &quot;were distinctive streamliners—ponderous, massive automobiles with a style all their own&quot;.
==Planes, boats and trains==

Streamlining became a widespread design practice for aircraft, railroad locomotives, and ships. 
==Industrial design==
Streamline style can be contrasted with functionalism, which was a leading design style in Europe at the same time. One reason for the simple designs in functionalism was to lower the production costs of the items, making them affordable to the large European working class. Streamlining and functionalism represent two different schools in modernistic industrial design.

<text>In botany and plant taxonomy, a series is a subdivision of a genus, a taxonomic rank below that of section (and subsection) but above that of species.

Sections and/or series are typically used to help organize very large genera, which may have hundreds of species.

==Cultivar marketing==
The term &quot;series&quot; is also used (in seed marketing) for groupings of cultivars, but this term has no formal status with that meaning in the &quot;ICNCP&quot;.

<text>Crimson Fox is a codename for two superheroines appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics.

==Publication history==
The first two holders of the Crimson Fox moniker first appeared in &quot;Justice League Europe&quot; #6 and were created by Keith Giffen and Bart Sears. Identical twins, Vivian and Constance D&#x27;Aramis shared the role of Crimson Fox to allow each something of a normal life, although Vivian was much more enthusiastic about their superheroic life. Crimson Fox originally appeared as part of Justice League Europe.

The unrevealed Crimson Fox first appeared in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; vol. 4 #11.

==Fictional character biography==
===Vivian and Constance D&#x27;Aramis===
The sisters ran Revson, a major Parisian perfume company (which may perhaps explain the origin of their pheromone powers). To make their heroic actions easier, they faked Constance&#x27;s death, so that one of them could operate as Crimson Fox (&quot;La Renard Rouge&quot; or &quot;La Renard Rousse&quot; in French) while the other attended business functions. Readers of her/their comic book appearances could easily tell the difference between the two due to Vivian&#x27;s more pronounced French accent. She was also always portrayed as a more carefree and outgoing woman than her sister. Both sisters (first Vivian, and later Constance) fell in love with fellow hero Metamorpho.

The first two Crimson Foxes are deceased. Vivian D&#x27;Aramis met her fate at the hands of French supervillain Puanteur in &quot;Justice League International&quot; #104 (October 1995). Puanteur died in the same issue. When the Justice League Europe team was reformed as La Fraternité de Justice et Liberté, the team did not know that member Icemaiden had been surreptitiously replaced by the daughter of supervillain The Mist. This new Mist killed three members of the team, including slitting Constance D&#x27;Aramis&#x27; throat, in &quot;Starman&quot; (vol. 2) #38.

===Unrevealed===
One Year Later in the pages of &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (vol. 4) #11, (June 2006), it was revealed that a new woman has taken the mantle of the Crimson Fox, again operating as a French superhero in Paris. She was unwillingly pressed into service and membership by the Global Guardians, who intended to pursue Green Lantern.

The new Crimson Fox told Hal Jordan that she is the heiress to the D&#x27;Aramis fortune, though her specific relationship to Vivian and Constance, as family or otherwise, remains unknown.

==Powers and abilities==
The original Crimson Fox twins had superhuman speed and agility and could emit pheromones that stimulated intense sexual attraction in men. Their gloves were equipped with deadly steel talons. After Vivian&#x27;s death, Constance retreated into her animal persona and developed enhanced senses.

The new Crimson Fox has a similarly equipped costume as the previous version and seems to possess identical pheromone powers.

==In other media==
===Television===
* An unidentified Crimson Fox makes non-speaking appearances in &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; as a member of the Justice League.
* An unidentified Crimson Fox appears in &quot;Powerless&quot;, portrayed by Atlin Mitchell in the pilot episode &quot;Wayne or Lose&quot; and by Deanna Russo in subsequent episodes.

===Merchandise===
The Vivian D&#x27;Aramis incarnation of Crimson Fox received an action figure in Mattel&#x27;s &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; toyline as part of a six-pack. Mattel planned to release individual figures of Crimson Fox, but the line was cancelled.

<doc id="1207429" wikidata="Q59468" url="?curid=1207429" title="Neue Galerie New York">
<text>The Neue Galerie New York (German for &quot;New Gallery&quot;) is a museum of early twentieth-century German and Austrian art and design located in the William Starr Miller House at 86th Street and Fifth Avenue in New York City. Established in 2001, it is one of the most recent additions to New York City&#x27;s famed Museum Mile, which runs from 83rd to 105th streets on Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.

==History==
The museum was first conceived by two close friends: art dealer and museum exhibition organizer Serge Sabarsky, and entrepreneur, philanthropist, and art collector Ronald S. Lauder. The two men shared a passionate commitment to early twentieth-century German and Austrian art and design. They met in 1967, just before Sabarsky opened his Serge Sabarsky Gallery at 987 Madison Avenue. The gallery quickly earned a reputation as New York’s leading gallery for Austrian and German Expressionist art, and Lauder was a frequent visitor and client. Over the years, the two men discussed opening a museum to showcase the very best work from the period. When Sabarsky died in 1996, Lauder chose to carry on the task of creating Neue Galerie New York, as a tribute to his friend.

==Collection==
The collection of the Neue Galerie is divided into two sections. The second floor of the museum houses works of fine art and decorative art from early twentieth-century Austria, including paintings by Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka, and Egon Schiele and decorative objects by the artisans of the Wiener Werkstaette and their contemporaries. The third floor exhibits various German works from the same era, including art movements such as &quot;Der Blaue Reiter&quot; (The Blue Rider), &quot;Die Brücke&quot; (The Bridge), and the Bauhaus. Featured artists on this floor include Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Lyonel Feininger, Otto Dix, and George Grosz.

In 2006, Lauder purchased Klimt&#x27;s painting &quot;Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I&quot; from Maria Altmann on behalf of the Neue Galerie. Citing a confidentiality agreement, Lauder would only confirm that the purchase price was more than the last record price of US$104.2 million US for Picasso&#x27;s 1905 &quot;Boy With a Pipe&quot;. The press reported the price for the Klimt at US$135 million, which would make it at that time the most expensive painting ever sold. It has been on display at the museum since July 2006.

==Facility==
The museum is housed in the former William Starr Miller House, a Louis XIII/Beaux-Arts structure located on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 86th Street. The Neue Galerie opened there on November 16, 2001. Selldorf Architects was responsible for the complete renovation and conversion into a museum. In addition to its gallery spaces, the museum also contains a bookstore, design shop, and two Viennese cafés, Café Sabarsky and Café Fledermaus.

== Café Sabarsky ==
Café Sabarsky, which bears the name of Neue Galerie co-founder Serge Sabarsky, draws inspiration from Viennese cafés. It is outfitted with period objects, including lighting fixtures by Josef Hoffmann, furniture by Adolf Loos, and banquettes that are upholstered with a 1912 Otto Wagner fabric. A Bösendorfer grand piano graces one corner of the Café, and is used for all cabaret, chamber, and classical music performances at the museum.

Café Sabarsky was operated by restaurateur Kurt Gutenbrunner until 2020. Since at least 2022, Christopher Engel has been the executive chef.

== Management ==
As of April 2020, the museum is headed by President and founder Ronald S. Lauder as well as an advisory Board of Trustees. Since the museum&#x27;s opening it has been led by Renée Price, Director, who was born in Vienna, Austria, and was formerly the Director of the Serge Sabarsky Gallery.

<text>Cannon is a lunar impact crater that is located near the east-northeastern limb of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It lies just to the northwest of the Mare Marginis, and south-southeast of the crater Plutarch. Farther to the east-northeast is Hubble.

This is a worn and eroded formation with an interior floor that has been resurfaced by lava. A small crater overlies the north rim, which forms a notch in the side. Tiny craters also lie across the rim northeast and at the southern edge. The interior is level and nearly featureless, with only a few tiny scattered craterlets to mark the surface. This floor has the same albedo as the surrounding terrain.

The crater is named after Annie Jump Cannon, an astronomer who classified 300,000 stellar bodies.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Cannon.

<doc id="1207463" wikidata="Q1018548" url="?curid=1207463" title="Býleistr">
<text>Býleistr (Old Norse: ; also Byleist) is the brother of Loki in Norse mythology.

== Name ==
The meaning of the Old Norse name is uncertain. The most popular propositions are compounds formed with the word (&#x27;storm&#x27;), either as (&#x27;storm-relieving&#x27;), (&#x27;storm-flasher&#x27;), or (&#x27;violent storm&#x27;).

Various forms are attested in the manuscripts of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;: &#x27;Býleistr&#x27; (&quot;Codices&quot; &quot;Regius&quot; and &quot;Wormianus&quot;), &#x27;Blýleistr&#x27; (&quot;Codex Trajectinus&quot;), or &#x27;Býleiptr&#x27; (&quot;Codex Upsaliensis&quot;).

== Attestations ==
Although there is no action involving Býleistr in the original sources, Loki is frequently called by the kenning &#x27;Byleist&#x27;s brother&#x27; (&quot;bróðir Býleists&quot;), such as in &quot;Völuspá&quot; , &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot; , or &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; .

In both &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Snorri Sturluson explicitly states that Byleist is, along with Helblindi, one of Loki&#x27;s two brothers.

Based on this relation, a number of scholars have considered Býleistr to be a son of Fárbauti and his consort Laufey. However, his exact role in the ancient mythic complex surrounding Loki&#x27;s family remains unclear.

<doc id="1207508" wikidata="Q1035198" url="?curid=1207508" title="Capuanus (crater)">
<text>Capuanus is a lunar impact crater that lies along the southern edge of the Palus Epidemiarum. It was named after Italian astronomer F. Capuano di Manfredonia. The outer rim is eroded and indented by lesser crater impacts, with notches in the north, west, and southern parts of the rim. The interior floor has been resurfaced by basaltic lava, which is connected to the surrounding lunar mare by a narrow, crater-formed gap in the northern rim. Dotting the floor of the crater are a number of domes, which are believed to have formed through volcanic activity.

The rim reaches its maximum altitude along the western face, where it merges with ridges along the edge of the mare. To the northeast the rim dips down very close to the surface, and barely forms a curving ridge in the surface. The southeastern rim is overlaid by a pair of craters.

To the north of Capuanus is the western extreme of the wide rille named Rima Hesiodus, which runs to the east-northeast. To the west-northwest is the crater Ramsden, and between Capuanus and Ramsden lies a system of intersecting rilles named the Rimae Ramsden.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Capuanus.

<doc id="1207509" wikidata="Q3446272" url="?curid=1207509" title="Wesleyan College">
<text>Wesleyan College is a private, liberal arts women&#x27;s college in Macon, Georgia, United States. Founded in 1836, Wesleyan was the first college in the world chartered to grant degrees to women. It opened in 1839, two years after the opening of Mount Holyoke College.

==History==
The school was chartered on December 23, 1836, as the Georgia Female College, and it opened its doors to students on January 7, 1839. The school was renamed as Wesleyan Female College in 1843, when its affiliation changed from the Methodist-Episcopal Church to the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. The college shortened its name in 1917 to the present Wesleyan College.
Wesleyan has the world&#x27;s oldest alumnae association, begun in 1859. Wesleyan College is the birthplace of the first sororities in the United States: the Adelphean Society in 1851, now known as Alpha Delta Pi, and the Philomathean Society in 1852, now known as now Phi Mu. The two sororities together are referred to as the &quot;Macon Magnolias&quot;. In 1914, the school disbanded sororities on its campus.

==Academics==
Wesleyan College has an undergraduate student population of around 600 with an acceptance rate of 67%. It has a student-faculty ratio of 7:1. In any given year, students from more than 20 states and over 20 countries around the world attend the school. Wesleyan offers 25 majors, 35 minors, and eight pre-professional programs. Students can earn a bachelor of arts, bachelor of fine arts, or bachelor of science in nursing degree. Wesleyan is affiliated with the United Methodist Church.

===Rankings=== 
In the 2025 edition, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Wesleyan College No. 6 out of 131 Regional Universities South and No.17 in Top Performers on Social Mobility. It received five stars out of five in reviews.

==Campus==
Wesleyan College has a 200-acre (800,000 m2) campus dotted with revivalist Georgian style brick buildings and features a 6.3-acre (25,000 m2) lake, Foster Lake.

Non-residential buildings on the (main) upper campus include:
* Candler Alumnae Center was built in 1946 and was presented to the College by the late Judge John Slaughter Candler of Atlanta in memory of his parents, Samuel and Martha Beall Candler. It was designed by renowned architect Phillip Shutze with the assistance of librarian Katharine Payne Carnes and originally housed the campus library. Candler Hall was renovated in 1971 as the Candler Alumnae Center and is currently home to the Office of Alumnae Affairs, the Office of Institutional Advancement, the Oval Hall ballroom, and the Benson Meeting Room.
* The Loggia is a two-level portico connecting the Olive Swann Porter Building with Persons Hall. The top-level balcony overlooks the courtyard between the residence halls and the campus fountain. It is revered for its exceptional architectural design and marble columns and staircase. The Loggia has been a symbol of Wesleyan College since its construction in 1928.
* The Lucy Lester Willet Memorial Library is a three-story Georgian-style brick building that was constructed in 1968 and is dedicated to the memory of Lucy Lester Willet, class of 1881. During the 2016-2017 school year, Willet Library underwent extensive renovations, opening a new 24-hour student academic center on the first floor of the building, complete with study carrels, computer labs, conference rooms, a testing center, the campus writing center, and a second-floor lounge with sitting areas, televisions, and vending machines. The library also houses the college&#x27;s branch of the Confucius Institute.
* The Munroe Science Center houses the biology, chemistry, nursing, neuroscience, and environmental science departments. Built in 2006, the 42,000-square-foot building was made possible by the generosity of the Munroe sisters and their families. The Munroe Science Center boasts numerous teaching laboratories, two classrooms, modern research labs for faculty-student research, animal facilities, a rooftop greenhouse, an astronomy observation deck, and the Center for Women in Science and Technology. On the west wing of Munroe is the nursing wing which houses the nursing classroom and state of the art nursing simulation lab.
* The Olive Swann Porter Student Life Center (OSP) was built in 1928 in remembrance of the wife of James Hyde Porter, a long-time trustee of Wesleyan College. Furniture, antiques, and paintings from the college&#x27;s extensive collection can be found throughout the building, most notably in the Burden Parlor and Manget Dining Room. Many offices of the Division of Student Affairs are housed in the Olive Swann Porter Building, including Health Services, the Center for Career Development, and the Office of the Dean of Students. OSP also contains the Anderson Dining Hall, Hurdle Café, Trice Conference Room, campus bookstore and post office, Lane Center for Service and Leadership, Belk Student Leadership Suites, and music practice rooms equipped with pianos. The Olive Swann Porter Building is connected to the Persons and Banks residence halls.
* The Porter Family Memorial Fine Arts Building was completed in 1954 and proudly houses the impressive Goodwyn-Candler-Panoz Organ, donated to the College by Asa G. Candler, Jr. of Coca-Cola fame, in its 1,129-seat auditorium. The Porter Family Memorial Fine Arts Building contains classrooms, offices, and studios for the College&#x27;s music and theatre departments, as well as the east and west wings of the Cowles Myles Collier Art Gallery, and the Porter-Grassmann Studio Theatre used for student-produced plays and dance performances.
* Porter Gymnasium was built in 1928 and includes a heated swimming pool, a weight room, and a gymnasium floor marked for all indoor activities with bleacher seating for 700 spectators. Classrooms, dressing rooms, a dance studio, an athlete lounge, and shower baths are housed inside the building, as well.
* Tate Hall was one of the first academic buildings, along with Taylor Hall, on Wesleyan College&#x27;s new Rivoli campus in 1928. It now contains classrooms and offices for the College&#x27;s communications, women&#x27;s studies, English, history, modern languages, religion, philosophy, and mathematics departments. The President&#x27;s Office, Business Office, Registrar&#x27;s Office, and other administrative offices are located on the first floor of Tate Hall.
* Taylor Hall was one of the first academic buildings, along with Tate Hall, on Wesleyan College&#x27;s new Rivoli campus in 1928. Taylor Hall originally housed the school&#x27;s science departments, but following renovations in 2009–2010, the building now houses laboratories and classrooms for education, physics, psychology, and business. The building also contains the 200-seat Peyton Anderson Amphitheatre on its ground floor.



Non-residential buildings on the lower campus include the following.
* Huckabee Hall houses the Office of Admissions.
* Pierce Chapel opened in 2015 and sits on a knoll overlooking Foster Lake. The chapel has a capacity of about 300 in the sanctuary, which is used primarily for worship services and occasionally as a venue for recitals, concerts, special events, and weddings. The Corn Center on the lower-level of the chapel provides meeting space for faith-based programs, campus groups, and the Chaplain&#x27;s office.
* The Valeria McCullough Murphy Art Building was built in 1964 and contains 10,000 square feet of floor space designed exclusively for the teaching of the studio arts, art history, and computer graphic design. The building houses faculty offices for the College&#x27;s visual arts department and is also the location of the Frances and Dennie McCrary Art Gallery used for faculty, student, and professional exhibitions.

==Student life==
===Student body===
In 2024, the student body was 38% White, 38% Black, 11% Hispanic, 6% of two or more races, 5% international students, 1% Asian, and 1% of unknown classification.

===Organizations===
There are four major student boards: CRU (Council on Religious Unity), CJA (Council on Judicial Affairs), CAB (Campus Activities Board), SRC (Student Recreation Council), which are represented as a part of SGA (Student Government Association). Wesleyan boasts the Nu Omega chapter of Alpha Kappa Psi, the professional business fraternity. It also has over 25 special interest clubs, academic honor societies including the Phi Kappa Phi, Beta Beta Beta and Omicron Delta Epsilon; musical groups, art clubs, service organizations, religious groups, and departmental leadership groups. Sororities have been prohibited since 1917.

===Events===
There are several popular events of the International Cherry Blossom Festival every springtime, such as the grand finale fireworks display. Porter Auditorium was once the home of the Macon Symphony Orchestra, and it still hosts many musical and theatrical events and competitions.

===Residence halls===
* Banks Hall was built in 1928 and houses freshmen. It is connected to the Olive Swann Porter Building via a breezeway.
* Elizabeth Turner Corn Hall North and Ernest &amp; Pauline Corn Hall South were opened in 1999.

<text>In Norse mythology, Gulltoppr (Old Norse: , &quot;golden mane&quot;) is one of the horses of the gods. Gulltoppr is mentioned in a list of horses in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot; and in &quot;Nafnaþulur&quot; section of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. According to &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, he is the horse of Heimdallr. Rudolf Simek theorizes that Snorri assigned a horse to Heimdall in an attempt to systematize the mythology.

==In popular culture==
Gulltoppr appears as a sub-boss in &quot;God of War Ragnarök&quot;. Similarly to Norse mythology, he serves as Heimdall&#x27;s personal mount. However, he is depicted as a horned leonine creature native to Asgard called a &quot;Gradungr&quot;.

<doc id="1207548" wikidata="Q598628" url="?curid=1207548" title="Jon Busch">
<text>Jon Busch (born August 18, 1976) is an American professional soccer coach and former player, who played as a goalkeeper. Busch is currently the goalkeeping coach for USL Championship club Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC.

He is best remembered for his captivating saves, despite his shorter stature for an elite goalkeeper, and spent most of his 21-year professional playing years in Major League Soccer, appearing for the Columbus Crew, Chicago Fire and San Jose Earthquakes. Busch also represented the United States at both youth and senior level.

Arguably his best season was in 2008 when he was named MLS Goalkeeper of the Year. As of the end of the 2015 season, Busch ranks fourth in MLS history in number of shutouts.

==Youth and college==
Busch played at Guilderland High School in Guilderland, New York, near Albany, where he was named a high school All-American. He was ranked within the top 25 best players in the nation as a senior.

In college, Busch was a NSCAA First Team All-American in 1996, when he help lead UNC Charlotte to their first ever appearance in the College Cup and a school-record 19 wins. He recorded a career-high 12 shutouts that season, including two in the NCAA Tournament and a career-low 0.89 goals against average (GAA) en route to being named Conference USA Defensive Player of the Year. Overall, he was a First Team All-Conference selection three times and was named to Soccer America&#x27;s First Team Freshman All-America team in 1994. In total, Busch spent 3 seasons with UNC Charlotte.

== Club career ==

=== A-League Years (1997–2001) ===
Busch was undrafted out of college by Major League Soccer. Instead, he spent a number of years in the United Soccer Leagues. He was drafted in 1997 by Nashville Metros with the 2nd overall pick in the A-League draft, but opted to split his first year with Worcester Wildfire and Carolina Dynamo. Busch then moved on to Hampton Roads Mariners, where he spent 3 seasons. He was named the team MVP in his second season. His breakout season came in 2001 with the Hershey Wildcats. He won 14 games and posted 13 shutouts while leading the team to the A-League National Championship match. Busch was named the A-League Goalkeeper of the Year and was selected the Division II circuit&#x27;s first-team All-League keeper.

=== Columbus Crew (2002–2006) ===
Major League Soccer took note of his USL play and it resulted in Busch being drafted by Columbus Crew with the 23rd overall pick of the 2002 MLS SuperDraft. Busch did not become a starter for the Crew immediately, sharing the duties in his first MLS season with incumbent Tom Presthus. He became a starter by 2003, but did not do very well as Columbus floundered in the standings. In contrast, both the Crew and Busch had terrific 2004 regular seasons, as the team, led by Busch&#x27;s goaltending, embarked on a league-record 18-game undefeated streak. Busch was a finalist for the 2004 MLS Goalkeeper of the Year Award for his performance, and his impact on the team&#x27;s season was cited as the third-highest impact of any MLS player on any MLS team in the history of the league by MLSnet writer Jeff Bradley. In 2005, he was sidelined by a knee injury for most of the season, leading the Crew to acquire Jonny Walker. The Crew&#x27;s goalkeeping injury woes intensified in 2006, as Busch was one of several injured keepers on the team roster, managing only eight games. He was waived prior to the 2007 season.

=== Chicago Fire (2007–2009) ===
Busch found himself the only player picked in the 2007 MLS Waiver Draft, selected by Toronto FC. On March 21 of the same year, he was waived by Toronto as the team found itself over the limit for senior international roster spots. He was subsequently traded to Chicago Fire in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the 2009 MLS Supplemental Draft. Busch was to serve primarily as a backup keeper in 2007 and only made it into three matches all season.

However, with the departure of starter Matt Pickens to Queens Park Rangers of England&#x27;s second-tier Football League Championship, Busch ultimately inherited the starter&#x27;s role with the Fire to start the 2008 season. He was named Fire MVP for the 2008 season after being the only Fire player to start and play 90 minutes in every MLS match during the regular season (2700 minutes). Busch posted the best saves percentage in the league (78.2) after making 122 saves on 156 shots faced. Busch tied for most shutouts in the league (10), while also tying a Fire single season shutout record shared with Matt Pickens for his 10 shutouts in 2007. For his efforts, Busch was named the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year. In March 2010, Busch was waived by the Chicago Fire.

=== San Jose Earthquakes (2010–2014) ===

Shortly after being waived, Busch was signed by San Jose Earthquakes. In 2014, Busch recorded a league best and franchise record 138 saves in a season, besting Joe Cannon&#x27;s mark set in 2000.

=== Chicago Fire (2015) ===
Busch returned to Chicago for his second stint with the club in January 2015. At the end of the season his contract option was declined.

=== Indy Eleven (2016–2017) ===
In January 2016, Busch signed as a free agent with the NASL club Indy Eleven. He will also serve as the club&#x27;s Director of Goalkeeping, with duties to include first team coaching and scouting, serving as a guest coach with the Indy Eleven NPSL squad and assisting with the Indy Eleven Summer Soccer Clinic series.

===Retirement===
In May 2018, Busch made one last transfer move back to his first MLS club, Columbus Crew SC. He and the club had agreed a one-day contract so he could officially retire as a player of Crew SC, the club which he called home in his retirement letter.

== International career ==
Busch earned his first and only cap for the United States on March 9, 2005. He shut out Colombia in a friendly, but despite the performance was not called back into the squad.

He has also represented the U.S. at the U-17 and U-20 levels, as well as having played in the 1993 FIFA U-17 World Championship in Japan.

==Coaching==
Busch obtained his &quot;B&quot; coaching license in January 2003. While playing for the Columbus Crew, he also trained goalkeepers in Columbus&#x27; youth soccer league, the Ohio Football Club. He became the academy goalkeeping coach at Indy Eleven in 2017, while also working with United States youth squads. Busch was appointed to a coaching position at Scottish club Hibernian in February 2022.

In January 2023, Busch was appointed goalkeeping coach for the Pittsburgh Riverhounds of the USL Championship.

==Personal==
Busch is the son of Madeline and Robert Busch. Robert Busch is a Lutheran pastor. Jon Busch married Nicole Blair on December 11, 2004.

<doc id="1207618" wikidata="Q2955868" url="?curid=1207618" title="Champions of Norrath">
<text>Champions of Norrath: Realms of EverQuest is a 2004 action role-playing video game for the PlayStation 2, set in the &quot;EverQuest&quot; universe. The game is playable with one single player or cooperative for up to four players, but with a Network Adapter, players can take the game online with others and kill others or join to form groups of adventurers. It uses a re-worked and expanded &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate: Dark Alliance&quot; game engine. A sequel called &quot;&quot; was released in 2005.

==Plot==
&quot;Champions of Norrath&quot; features a traditional role-playing video game storyline, in which the player acts as a hero who must save the world via a series of quests and battles. Divided into five acts, the game begins with a quest to assist the elves in their war against the orcs, who have formed an alliance with goblins (which is strange to the citizens of Norrath). In later acts, the player must eventually travel to the underworld and beyond thanks to the antics created by the strange orc leader and his contacts. The game takes place in the focal world of the &quot;EverQuest&quot; universe known as Norrath, prior to the events of the first &quot;EverQuest&quot; online RPG, which was itself prior to &quot;The Shattering&quot; of the moon Luclin. The game applies many elements of the &quot;EverQuest&quot; universe. There are three main antagonists in the storyline: Pelys, leader of the orcs, Vanarhost, a vampire in the Underworld who also narrates the entire game and Innoruuk, the God of Hatred.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay is a traditional hack and slash with several additional elements. During the opening sequence, the player selects a race, appearance, and skills. From there, the game continues to follow classic RPG standards, as the player fights monsters, explores forests, towns, godly domains and dungeons, obtains gold to purchase weapons, and so on. As the player gains experience, he or she will level up and increase character statistics and abilities.

All characters have a series of spells and skills, which can be enhanced via the Ability Tree. The Ability Tree allows the player flexibility in choosing skills, chiefly because points may be invested in several choices at once. These abilities can increase damage, add new spells, etc. These choices are limited by several factors, including the character&#x27;s level, the skill&#x27;s prerequisites, and the total number of ability points in the character&#x27;s reserve. The points cannot be regained once used.

Equipment is often dropped by enemies, though there is a shop to buy items. Sometimes, the items dropped by enemies are much better than anything for sale in the shop. Each item has a weight and each character has a weight limit (which is increased by strength). Together, this allows for a limited amount of equipment to be carried at any given time, but items known as &quot;Gate Scrolls&quot; allow players to warp back to the nearest shop and sell excess inventory. Moreover, the armor and weapons are customizable through rare items, which allows players to fuse a weapon with statistical bonuses, elemental attack, and increased weapon attack speed.

Dungeons in the game cover many forms of terrain. As with most RPGs, many dungeons in &quot;Champions of Norrath&quot; feature a boss or large group of enemies that must be defeated to advance or obtain a special item. Traps and secret passages are also common in dungeons (for instance, destructible walls). Furthermore, the game offers two advanced bonus dungeon levels upon completion of the game.

It is possible to import and export characters, which allows the player to save or load a character anywhere in the game while keeping the statistics and items of that character. This is important for scenarios which require a transfer of characters, such as online play (now defunct), multiplayer games, and the sequel, &quot;&quot;.

Savepoints and portals play a key role in the gameplay. First, savepoints also double as checkpoints, which may be accessed if a character dies. The Portals are activated when the player walks near the Portal. They allow the player to jump to key locations in each region.

Before the servers shutdown on April 2, 2013, players were able import their character(s) for online play, which could be accessed from a save point. This mode of play allowed for players to join parties or quests. Players could join anywhere in the game, despite completion in the one player mode. Up to four players could join in the same game. It was a cooperative type multiplayer game that disabled damage a player can inflict upon a fellow player.

==Characters==
There are five types of playable characters that can be used throughout the game: Barbarian Warriors, Wood Elf Rangers, High Elf Clerics, Erudite Wizards, and Dark Elf Shadowknights. Each come in male and female varieties, which have no impact on gameplay other than appearance. This choice cannot be changed after the character is made.

==Reception==
&quot;Champions of Norrath&quot; received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

<doc id="1207626" wikidata="Q7053662" url="?curid=1207626" title="North Adelaide Football Club">
<text>The North Adelaide Football Club, nicknamed the Roosters, is an Australian rules football club affiliated with the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) and SANFL Women&#x27;s League (SANFLW). The club plays its home games at Prospect Oval, located in Prospect, a northern suburb of Adelaide. North Adelaide’s history can be traced directly back to the formation of the Medindie Football Club in 1881. Medindie was elevated to the South Australian Football Association (SAFA, later to become the SANFL) in 1888 as the Medindie Football Club (nickname Dindies and from 1890s Dingoes), changing its name to North Adelaide in 1893 with the promise of support from North Adelaide residents. It is the fourth oldest club still in operation in the SANFL after South Adelaide (1877), Port Adelaide (1877) and Norwood (1878). As the Port Adelaide SANFL team merged with the Port Adelaide AFL team in 2013 and now plays in the SANFL as an AFL Reserves team, some will argue that North Adelaide is now the third oldest SANFl club still in operation in the SANFL. North Adelaide&#x27;s first premiership was won in 1900 (which finally broke the dominance of the 3 older clubs), and the club has won a total of fourteen senior men&#x27;s premierships in the SANFL, most recently in 2018.

==History==
In 1880 a group of schoolboys from Prince Alfred College and the now defunct Whinham College got together and played football on a section of the Park Lands, previously known as Hawker&#x27;s Paddock. It was so called locally because it was leased from the City of Adelaide by George Hawker, a well known citizen of the suburb of Medindie. The schoolboys dubbed their football team the Medindie Football Club. They wore the red and white colours of Prince Alfred College and played other football teams on the site. One of those schoolboys was Charles Nitschke who would become Captain of the Medindie Club and would be known as the founding Father of North Adelaide Football Club.
One of the club&#x27;s first reported games were in May 1882 against Prince Alfred and St Peters Colleges Second Twenties both on Medindie&#x27;s home ground.

Medindie was a foundation member in 1885 of the South Australian Junior Football Association, before being admitted to the Adelaide and Suburban Football Association in 1886.

At the Annual General Meeting on 16 March 1888, held at the Red Lion Hotel, the Secretary Charles Nitschke was elected a Life Member for his valuable services to the club.

At the start of 1888, during a split of the SAFA, the Medindie Club was invited to join with 3 senior clubs, Port Adelaide, South Adelaide and the Adelaide (1885), into forming a new Senior South Australia Football Association. Once the dispute was settled the club was still invited to join the senior Association for the 1888 SAFA season.

On 14 March 1893, at a meeting held at Temperance Hall, Tynte Street, North Adelaide it was unanimously decided to renamed itself from Medindie to North Adelaide. Although several other early clubs, including Victorians and Hothams which used the name of &quot;North Adelaide&quot; prior to 1893, none of them bore ties to the current club.

North Adelaide started playing at Prospect Oval from 1922 with the first game of the season on Monday 8 May 1922 against Glenelg and it has remained their home ground ever since.

North Adelaide competed in the first match played at Football Park (now known as AAMI Stadium) in round 5, 1974. Their opponent was Central District. The match was won by Central District.

The longest serving coach for the club is Michael Nunan – 12 seasons from 1981 to 1992.

The Captain&#x27;s record is held by Ian McKay, captaining the team for 8 years from 1948 to 1955.

The North Adelaide Football Club officially renamed both ends of Prospect Oval in 2012 after the two official Icons of the club. The northern end around the goals was named the &quot;Ken Farmer End&quot;, while the southern end was named the &quot;Barrie Robran End&quot;.

South Australian Football Hall of Fame and Australian Football Hall of Fame inductee Jack &#x27;Dinny&#x27; Reedman and future North Adelaide Premiership Captain began his career at Medindie in 1884.

North Adelaide was a foundation member of the SANFL Women&#x27;s competition in 2017. The Roosters lost two grand finals in the league before eventually claiming their maiden women&#x27;s premiership in 2020.

==Club Icons==
The North Adelaide Football Club has named two of their past champions as Icons. They are:

* Ken Farmer – All-time leading SANFL goal kicker with 1,419 from 1929 to 1941. Premiership player in 1930 and 1931. Premiership coach in 1949 and 1952. Since 1981 the leading goalkicker in each SANFL season has been awarded the &quot;Ken Farmer Medal&quot;. He kicked 105 goals in 1930 to become the first SA League player to kick 100 goals in a season. He was a prolific goalkicker, kicking 100 goals in a season in 11 consecutive seasons (1930–1940). Farmer also holds the record for the most goals in an SANFL match – 23 against West Torrens at Prospect on 6 July 1940. Farmer scored ten or more goals in thirty-seven matches, and 1,419 goals in total over his career, at an astounding average of 6.3 per match.
* Barrie Robran – Triple Magarey Medallist (1968, 1970, 1973). Premiership player in 1971 and 1972, is North Adelaide&#x27;s other iconic player, Barrie Robran, played 201 League games for the Roosters and 10 State games, and won 3 Magarey Medals (1968, 1970 and 1973). He was the first SANFL player to be made a &quot;Legend&quot; in the Australian Football Hall of Fame, and the only &quot;Legend&quot; not to have played VFL or AFL.

==Club song==
North Adelaide have had many versions of their club song in the past. All versions have contained the same lyrics, but have been changed rhythm wise to keep up with the times. The lyrics and tune, by well known Australian singer/songwriter Johnny Mac, are the only completely original written in the league, as all the other clubs have written lyrics to well known tunes. The most recent version was brought in during the early 2000s, but all versions can still be found on the club song CD.

<doc id="1207627" wikidata="Q906510" url="?curid=1207627" title="Marriage à la mode (play)">
<text>Marriage à la Mode is a Restoration comedy by John Dryden, first performed in London in 1673 by the King&#x27;s Company. It is written in a combination of prose, blank verse and heroic couplets. It has often been praised as Dryden&#x27;s best comedic endeavour, and James Sutherland accounts for this by observing that &quot;the comic scenes are beautifully written, and Dryden has taken care to connect them with the serious plot by a number of effective links. He writes with ... one of the most thoughtful treatments of sex and marriage that Restoration comedy can show.&quot;

The play contains two songs, &quot;Why Should a Foolish Marriage Vow&quot; by Robert Smith and &quot;Whilst Alexis Lay Pressed&quot; by Nicholas Staggins, both set to Dryden&#x27;s lyrics and printed in the 1673 book &quot;Choice Songs and Ayres for One Voyce to Sing to the Theorbo-Lute or Bass-Viol&quot;.

==Characters==
* Polydamas, Usurper of Sicily.
* Leonidas, the rightful Prince, unknown.
* Argaleon, favourite to Polydamas.
* Hermogenes, foster-father to Leonidas.
* Eubulus, his friend and companion.
* Rhodphil, captain of the guards.
* Palamede, a courtier.
* Palmyra, daughter to the Usurper.
* Amalthea, sister to Argaleon.
* Doralice, wife to Rhodophil.
* Melantha, an affected lady.
* Philotis, woman to Melantha.
* Beliza, woman to Doralice.
* Artemis, a court lady.

==Plot synopsis==
The setting is in Sicily. The plot concerns two separate storylines, one a romance between Palmyra and Leonidas, who were separated from their parents as babies and who were raised together by Hermogenes, who has kept their past a secret. When Hermogenes is recognized by the usurper-king Polydamas, he declares that Leonidas is Polydamas&#x27;s son. However, as Leonidas&#x27;s new position of prince then forbids him to marry Palmyra, much misery is brought to the couple. When the lovers refuse to stop seeing each other, Palmyra is sentenced to death. Hermogenes then steps forward and reveals that he was lying before: in fact Leonidas is his own son, he says, and he had lied in the hopes of bettering the boy by making him prince, whereas Palmyra is the real child of Polydamas. After offering proof of this new claim, Palmyra is established as princess, but again this prevents her and Leonidas from marrying. Hermogenes eventually admits that he once again was withholding information, and reveals the whole truth to Leonidas—Leonidas is the son of the rightful king, whose throne was usurped by Polydamas. As soon as he learns this, Leonidas forms a rebellion against Polydamas, wins, and establishes himself the new king, finally allowing himself and Palmyra to be married.

The second storyline, which intertwines with the first, concerns Rhodophil and his friend Palamede. Palamede has fallen in love with Rhodophil&#x27;s wife Doralice, and Rhodophil is in love with Palamede&#x27;s fiancée Melantha. Each of the women seem to find their pursuers agreeable, and great care is taken by all parties to keep their meetings secret from each other, with disastrous results as the two couples seem to always choose the same locations and tactics for meeting. When finally the actions of everyone are discovered, Palamede and Rhodophil decide that since their tastes in women are so similar, each would be best sticking to his rightful claim. Palamede then manages to win the heart of Melantha, and amicably break off his relationship with Doralice.

==Sources==
Dryden borrowed from two plays by John Fletcher and his collaborators for &quot;Marriage À-la-Mode.&quot; He adapted its main plot from &quot;Beggars&#x27; Bush&quot; and its subplot from &quot;Rule a Wife and Have a Wife.&quot;

==Production history==
The King&#x27;s Company first performed &quot;Marriage à la Mode&quot; in London in 1673. William Wintershall played Polydamas, Edward Kynaston was Leonidas, Michael Mohun was Rhodophil, Edward Lydall was Argaleon, Marmaduke Watson was Eubulus and Nicholas Burt was Palamede; the role of Hermogenes was taken by William Cartwright the younger. Elizabeth Cox played Palmyra, Rebecca Marshall played Doralice, Elizabeth James was Amalthea, and Elizabeth Boutell was Melantha.

Arthur Hutchings composed a comic opera based on the play in 1956.

<doc id="1207664" wikidata="Q354764" url="?curid=1207664" title="Sigma Corporation">
<text>is a Japanese company, manufacturing cameras, lenses, flashes and other photographic accessories. All Sigma products are produced in the company&#x27;s own Aizu factory in Bandai, Fukushima, Japan. Although Sigma produces several camera models, the company is best known for producing high-quality lenses and other accessories that are compatible with the cameras produced by other companies.

The company was founded in 1961 by Michihiro Yamaki, who was Sigma&#x27;s CEO until his death at age 78 in 2012.

Sigma products work with cameras from Canon, Nikon, Fujifilm, Pentax, Sony, Olympus and Panasonic, as well as their own cameras.

Sigma has also made lenses under the Quantaray name, which have been sold exclusively by Ritz Camera. Similarly, Sigma lenses were sold exclusively by the former Wolf Camera, but following the merger of Wolf and Ritz, both brands could be purchased.

Sigma&#x27;s digital SLRs, the SD9, SD10, SD14 and SD15, plus the latest SD1 are unusual in their use of the Foveon X3 image sensor. The company&#x27;s mirrorless cameras, the Sigma SD Quattro and SD Quattro H, use the Foveon Quattro sensor, an updated version of the Foveon X3. All use the SA lens mount. The Sigma DP series of high-end compact P&amp;S cameras also use the Foveon Quattro sensor, which gives them a much larger sensor than other cameras of this type.

In September 2018 Sigma became one of the founding members of the L-Mount Alliance; it announced that it will cease to develop SA-mount cameras and instead use the Leica L-Mount. A new full-frame mirrorless camera, Sigma FP, was launched in 2019 along with a range of L-Mount lenses and adapters.

Sigma is the world&#x27;s largest independent lens manufacturer and is a family-owned business.

==Cameras==
Sigma has made a number of film SLR cameras, including the SA-300, SA-5, SA-7 and SA-9.

Up until the Sigma FP, all Sigma SLR, DSLR, and mirrorless cameras used the Sigma SA mount, which is mechanically similar to the Pentax K mount and electrically an adaptation of the Canon EF lens mount lens control system.

Sigma has been one of the first companies to experiment with putting the Foveon X3 sensor in consumer digital cameras. During photokina 2010, Sigma announced a new flagship DSLR camera, the SD1, featuring a 46MP Foveon X3 sensor. In recent years their DSLR range has been discontinued in favor of mirrorless designs.

Sigma also produced the DP series of high-end compact digital cameras. The Foveon APS-C sized sensors were similar to those used in the DSLR line. The most-recent line made use of the Quattro sensor, a variant of the Foveon design that had higher resolution top layers and lower resolution lower layers combined into a final image, claimed to be equivalent to a 39 megapixel color filter array image. The four compact cameras were differentiated by their fixed prime lens, with the ultra wide DP0, the wide DP1, the normal DP2 and the telephoto DP3.

In February 2016, Sigma announced two new mirrorless cameras—the SD Quattro and SD Quattro H. Both cameras used the full-depth Sigma SA mount, allowing the use of existing SA-mount lenses, and also used Foveon Quattro sensors. The SD Quattro uses an APS-C sensor with 19.6 MP in the top layer, while the SD Quattro H used an APS-H (1.35x crop) sensor with 25.5 MP in the top layer. The company claimed that the Foveon Quattro technology produced a level of detail equivalent to that of a Bayer sensor with twice the pixel count.

In July 2019, Sigma announced the Sigma fp, a small form-factor, 24.6MP full-frame mirrorless camera. At the time of launch it was the world&#x27;s smallest. This was followed by the FP-L in 2021 with a 61mp sensor. Both cameras were able to shoot up to 14-bit RAW video.

==Software==
Sigma produces multiple software packages for use with their cameras and lenses.

* SIGMA Photo Pro - Software for post-production of their camera&#x27;s .X3F raw image format. It is available both for Mac OS and Microsoft Windows.
* SIGMA Optimization Pro - Software for updating lens firmware and performing calibration and customization.
* SIGMA Capture Pro - Software allowing remote control and image capture from select Sigma cameras.

==Lenses==

Sigma makes autofocus lenses for the Sigma SA, Canon EF, Nikon F, Fujifilm X, Minolta/Sony α, Pentax K and Four Thirds lens mounts. Each lens may not be available in all mounts, and may lack certain features (such as HSM) on certain mounts.

In August 2013, Sigma announced that starting the following month, it would offer a mount conversion service for its newest &quot;Global Vision&quot; lenses—those with either an &quot;A&quot; (Art), &quot;C&quot; (Contemporary), or &quot;S&quot; (Sport) as part of their model name. For a cost that varies with lens and market—from $80 to $250 in the U.S., not including shipping costs—owners can send their lenses to their local Sigma company, which in turn sends them to Japan for mount replacement, including calibration and optimization for the new camera system. Lenses designed for DSLRs can be converted to Canon EF, Nikon F, Pentax K, Sigma SA, or Sony A mounts; those designed for MILCs can be converted to Micro Four Thirds or Sony E-mount.

===Designations===

* ASP — Aspherical lens elements
* APO — Apochromatic lens element(s), originally for &quot;Advanced Performance Optics&quot;, not necessarily apochromatic
* OS — In-lens &quot;Optical Stabilization&quot;, analogous to Nikon VR or Canon IS

<doc id="1207705" wikidata="Q809428" url="?curid=1207705" title="Bartica">
<text>Bartica is a town located on the west bank of the Essequibo River in Cuyuni-Mazaruni (Region 7), at the confluence of the Cuyuni and Mazaruni Rivers with the Essequibo River in Guyana. It is the regional capital of Cuyuni-Mazaruni.

Considered the &quot;Gateway to the Interior&quot;, the town has a population of 8,004 as of 2012, and is the launching point for people who work in the bush, mining gold and diamonds.
==History==
The town developed from an Anglican missionary settlement, established in 1837, and consecrated in 1843. The name &quot;Bartica&quot; comes from an indigenous word meaning &quot;red earth&quot;, abundant in the area. According to the Georgetown Daily Chronicle of July 30, 1892, the ornithologist Whitely died in his camp on the Annie Scapy River near Bartica. He was in a state of delirium from malaria and also depressed by the loss of his bird hunting haul when his boat sank. This was probably the reason why he eventually shot himself.

==Education==
Bartica has two secondary school Bartica Secondary and Three Miles Secondary and three primary schools, St. Anthony&#x27;s Primary and St. John-the-Baptist and Two Miles Primary. There are several other primary schools in the surrounding riverine communities.
==Health==
The region 7 hospital is located in Bartica and is known for having implemented the country’s first electronic Health Information System in 2005, developed by Peace Corps volunteers Geoffrey Thompson and Jason Knueppel.

==Tourism==

Bartica can be reached from Parika, Essequibo and Linden, Demarara. The Denham Suspension Bridge, also known as the Garraway Stream Bridge, links Bartica to Mahdia.

Bartica Airport is southwest of the town.

North of Bartica lie the ruins of the Dutch fort Kyk-Over-Al, former government seat for the County of Essequibo. Bartica is also close to Marshall Falls.

There are several hotels in the town including the Platinum Inn, The New Modern Hotel, Balkarran&#x27;s Guest House (D factor to D interior), and Zen&#x27;s Plaza. There is also a thriving nightclub located in the Modern Hotel building. Several Brazilians live in Bartica, so one can find Brazilian restaurants and bars. There are several restaurants as well as local fast food joints.

There are also several resorts around the Bartica area including Baganara Island Resort, Aruwai H2O Resort, Shanklands (not open at the moment), Whitewater and a Guesthouse in Byderabo. From Bartica, persons can also gain access to pristine riverain communities to experience the true indigenous way of life.

During the Easter weekend every year, Bartica hosts the Bartica Regatta, with a growing variety of entertaining holiday activities including water sports (featuring mostly speed boats), cricket, boxing, soccer, talent shows, a street parade, and a Miss Bartica Regatta Pageant. The Regatta attracts people from all parts of Guyana, and even from other countries. There is also a summer Regatta, which is held annually in August.

==Notable people==
* Frank Bowling (1934-), an abstract painter.
* Dianne Ferreira-James (1970-), international FIFA referee
* Ivor Mendonca (1934-2014), a West Indian cricketer
* Kaysia Schultz (1997-), a West Indian cricketer

==Massacre==

On the 17th of February 2008 Bartica was allegedly attacked by Rondell Rawlins&#x27; heavily armed gang. Twelve people, including three policemen, were shot dead as the gang terrorized the town. The Bartica Police Station was overrun by the gunmen during the rampage and several business places robbed during the hour-long mayhem. The gang and attack is believed to linked to the Lusignan Massacre three weeks earlier. The perpetrators were killed on August 28, 2008 at one of their hideouts near the Guyanese capital Georgetown in a shootout with the police.

<doc id="1207727" wikidata="Q6439720" url="?curid=1207727" title="Kryptonite lock">
<text>Kryptonite is an Allegion-owned brand of bicycle lock for securing a bicycle to a pole or other fixture, when the owner wants to leave the bicycle in a public place. The basic design, made of hardened steel of circular cross section bent into a U-shape with a removable crossbar, has been emulated by numerous other manufacturers, and adapted with variations in size and shape for other applications, such as locking motorcycles.

The product was named after kryptonite, the fictitious substance that can thwart the powerful comic-book hero Superman. The name is used under a limited trademark agreement with DC Comics dating back to 1983.

== History ==
The Kryptonite u-lock was developed by Stanley Kaplan. Kaplan partnered with Michael Zane, whose father had a metal manufacturing company, to produce and market the locks. In 1972 Michael Zane bought the lock and company from Kaplan. In the early 1970s, in the US, the only proven method to secure one&#x27;s bicycle was by the use of case hardened security chains with hexagonal links, but some cyclists were making the mistake of using inexpensive chains or cables that could be breached by thieves using commonly available tools. Indeed, local hardware stores would often sell inexpensive chain cut to length using simple bolt cutters. The first Kryptonite lock model was made of sheet metal cut and bent to shape, but the company soon went to the now universal circular cross section.

In an early test of the Kryptonite lock, a bicycle was locked to a signpost in Greenwich Village in New York City for thirty days. Thieves stripped the bicycle of every part that could be removed, but the lock resisted all attempts to break it.

Ingersoll Rand acquired Kryptonite in 2001. In 2013 Ingersoll Rand&#x27;s security products were placed in a spin-off company called Allegion.

== Design ==
Until 2004, Kryptonite locks used the tubular pin tumbler locking mechanism. In 2005, after it was demonstrated that the tubular pin tumbler locks used on Kryptonite locks could easily be opened with the shaft of a Bic ballpoint pen of matching diameter, Kryptonite changed their locks from the tubular to a disc mechanism, preventing the use of cylindrically shaped objects to defeat the locking system.
After this problem became public, Kryptonite offered a free exchange program for all owners of locks with tubular mechanisms.
Kryptonite launched a Messenger Collection in 2015, created with input from actual bicycle messengers in New York City.

<text>A monogastric organism has a simple single-chambered stomach (one stomach). Examples of mono-gastric omnivores include humans hamsters and rats. Furthermore, there are monogastric carnivores such as cats. A monogastric organism is contrasted with ruminant organisms (which have four-chambered complex stomachs), such as cattle, goats, and sheep. Herbivores with monogastric digestion can digest cellulose in their diets by way of symbiotic gut bacteria. However, their ability to extract energy from cellulose digestion is less efficient than in ruminants. 

Herbivores digest cellulose by microbial fermentation. Monogastric herbivores which can digest cellulose nearly as well as ruminants are called hindgut fermenters, while ruminants are called foregut fermenters. These are subdivided into two groups based on the relative size of various digestive organs in relationship to the rest of the system: colonic fermenters tend to be larger species such as horses and rhinos, and cecal fermenters are smaller animals such as rabbits and rodents. Great apes derive significant amounts of phytanic acid from the hindgut fermentation of plant materials.

Monogastrics cannot digest the fiber molecule cellulose as efficiently as ruminants, though the ability to digest cellulose varies amongst species.

A monogastric digestive system works as soon as the food enters the mouth. Saliva moistens the food and begins the digestive process. (Note that horses have no (or negligible amounts of) amylase in their saliva). After being swallowed, the food passes from the esophagus into the stomach, where stomach acid and enzymes help to break down the food. Once food leaves the stomach and enters the small intestine, the pancreas secretes enzymes and alkali to neutralize the stomach acid.

<text>Bealeton is a census-designated place (CDP) in Fauquier County, Virginia, United States, at the intersection of U.S. Route 17 and State Route 28. The population was 5,882 at the 2020 census.

Public schools in Bealeton include Grace Miller Elementary, Cedar Lee Middle, and Liberty High School. Bealeton is home to its own post office, with ZIP code 22712.

==Geography==
Bealeton is located in southwestern Fauquier County. U.S. Route 17 leads north to Warrenton, the county seat, and southeast to Fredericksburg. VA 28 leads northeast to Manassas and southwest to U.S. Routes 29 and 15, which lead an additional to Culpeper.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.23%, is water. The area drains south via Marsh Run to the Rappahannock River.

==History==
Bealeton was originally a stop on the former Orange and Alexandria Railroad (absorbed ultimately into the Southern Railway in 1894, now Norfolk Southern), and the old railroad station building can be seen in the Bealeton Station development in front of the Bealeton Library building. The building was previously located on County Road 805, Bealeton Road, which runs parallel and near the railway. The area was a major traveling point during the Civil War and saw many skirmishes related to nearby engagements.

Despite the presence of Confederate troops during the early years of the war, Union troops succeeded in pushing the Confederate line south of the Rappahannock River and eventually into Fredericksburg. This move led to the control of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, thus allowing the Union army to transport supplies deep into southern Virginia.

Bealeton lost importance with the decline of railroad travel and became a bedroom community of Warrenton and Northern Virginia primarily. This was aided by the comprehensive plan that made authorized water and sewer availability in 1967. Bealeton retains many large farms and provides a unique blend of agriculture, commercial, and residential development.

==Local attractions==

Since 1970, Bealeton has been home to one of the last barnstorming air shows in America, simply called the &quot;Flying Circus&quot;. Open every Sunday, May through October, activities include All-American barnstorming, wing walking, parachuting, aerobatic performances and open-cockpit biplane rides.

Bealeton is also the home of the world&#x27;s largest old-fashioned roller skate. It was originally created as a float for a fireman&#x27;s parade and put in place in front of the rink by Hugo Stribling when he opened Hugo&#x27;s Skateway in 1978. The skating rink has changed hands several times since Hugo&#x27;s was sold in 2007. The most recent owners closed the doors in January 2017 after their lease was terminated.

Morais Vineyards &amp; Winery opened in 2011 and is Bealeton&#x27;s only vineyard and winery, located right on Route 17. It is considered a Portuguese-style winery with a wedding venue that attracts thousands of people each year.

The Bealeton wedding venue Great Marsh Estate was featured in season 7 of Neflix&#x27;s &quot;Love is Blind.&quot; The wedding venue opened in 2017 following the foreclosure of a private property built in 1989. It features an 8,000sqft Georgian-Revival building along with 121 acres of land.

<text>Central District Football Club is an Australian rules football club that plays in the South Australian National Football League. Based at Elizabeth in the City of Playford about 25 km north of Adelaide, South Australia, the club&#x27;s development zones include the outer Adelaide northern suburbs of Salisbury, Elizabeth, Golden Grove, Greenwith, Township of Gawler, One Tree Hill and Barossa Valley Districts.

==Origins and background==

Football clubs had been first established in the outer northern areas beyond metropolitan Adelaide at Salisbury (1880), Kapunda (1866) and Gawler (1868) who fielded a team for 4 seasons (1887–1890) in the early years of the South Australian Football Association (1877–1906), which would eventually become the South Australian National Football League.

Gawler finished bottom of the ladder for the 1890 SAFA season with 2 draws from its 14 games and was withdrawn at the end of the season. It then formed its own local competition, the predecessor of the current Barossa Light &amp; Gawler Football Association. In 1899, with the introduction of compulsory Electorate Football Districts, Gawler (which was assigned the Electoral district of Barossa) wrote to the SAFA informing them that they were interested in joining.

In November 1936 a deputation from the Gawler Football Association meet with delegates of the SANFL regarding a proposal to admitting a team. The Barossa and Light Association and the Adelaide Plains Association were not in favor of combining to enter a team in the League competition, but would not prevent the League fixing the boundaries of the suggested new League football district to embrace those districts. A suggestion was made by one of the League delegates that Gawler might be prepared to substantiate its claims&#x27; that it was near League standard by sending a team to play in the Association (B grade) in the metropolitan area for 12 months, but this was immediately rejected by the deputation. The proposal was rejected by the league on the grounds of costs to the other clubs and that the question of Gawler&#x27;s admission be held in abeyance for a year.

During the mid-1950s a team from the newly created and developing satellite City of Elizabeth (to the outer north of Adelaide between the older townships of Salisbury and Gawler) was absent from the SANFL ranks. Fred Rogers, Secretary of the Gawler Football League and heavily involved with the local junior competition, made an unofficial approach to SANFL President Thomas Seymour Hill regarding an admission of a League club from the growing Northern suburbs of Adelaide.

==Birth of a new SANFL Club==

A new team, the Central District Football Club was formed in 1959, and served a five-year apprenticeship in the SANFL reserves competition (1959–1963), before entering the senior ranks together with Woodville Football Club for the 1964 SANFL season. For the inaugural season in the Reserves, Charlie Pratt a key member of the strong West Torrens sides of the late 1940s and early to mid 1950s was appointed coach. John Delo, a former West Torrens ruckman, who was now residing at Salisbury was appointed the club&#x27;s first captain.

The name Central District was synonymous with a Queen&#x27;s Birthday Holiday Football Carnival contested by the Gawler, Barossa, Adelaide Plains and Mid-North Football Leagues. The club&#x27;s name was derived to represent a district, bringing together people from the fast-growing urban northern Adelaide areas of Salisbury, Elizabeth, together with Gawler, Adelaide Plains, Barossa Valley and the Mid-North. The new football Club gave an entire area a team to follow in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) competition.

==Club Colours and Supporters==

Uniquely for an Australian Rules Football Club, Centrals have a very strong British migrant identity and supporter base as Elizabeth was a centre of UK migrant settlements in Adelaide, South Australia. The colours and emblem of the club also reflect this rich British background. The colours were adopted from a UK soccer side depicted on a souvenir card. However, the exact identity of which club inspired the colours has not been revealed. To this day, many Central supporters carry Union Jack flags at matches and sport UK soccer paraphernalia. The colours were also influenced by Footscray in the VFL, the new club&#x27;s inaugural patron, and the same Bulldog emblem was adopted for its working-class connotations.

With this British background, Centrals also have a reputation for their fans singing and chanting in the manner of UK Association Football supporters. The chants &#x27;Ceeeeentrals&#x27; and &#x27;You Dogs&#x27; are their most well known chants/songs.

During the Premiership years from 2000 – 2010, Centrals enjoyed healthy home crowds, with the highest being 7,329 against Sturt in 2006.

==Early Years (1964–1970)==

West Adelaide 1961 Premiership Player and 1962 Margarey Medallist Ken Eustice was appointed as Central&#x27;s Captain and Coach for the 1964 Season. Whilst waiting for his clearance from West Adelaide, Gary Window was the acting Captain. Central&#x27;s first season in the league ranks. the 1964 SANFL season ended without a single league victory, and therefore finished bottom of the table with an average losing margin of 64 points (Centrals have won only one wooden spoon since, being in the 1977 season). The first league victory came against Woodville by 17 points in the 2nd round of the 1965 season. From its first season of league football in 1964, Centrals struggled for success during its early years. From 1964 to 1970 (first 7 seasons), the Bulldogs failed to qualify for the Finals. They played 140 matches – won 32 (22.86%) and lost 108 (including every match against Port Adelaide and Sturt).

==Finals Campaign Disappointments (1971–1999)==

===First Finals Campaigns (1971 and 1972)===

Centrals made the Top 4 for the first time for the 1971 SANFL season after winning just 3 games in the first 10 rounds, they won 9 out of the last 11 games including a first-ever win against Port Adelaide. The Bullogs played and won its first-ever final (1971 First semi-final) against Sturt after trailing by 5pts at 3 quarter time by 27 points. This was Central&#x27;s first-ever win against the Double Blues after 16 straight losses and ended Sturt&#x27;s run of 5 consecutive winning Premierships from 1966 to 1970. However, before a crowd of 42,909, the Bulldogs lost the preliminary final to Port Adelaide by 29 points after scores were level at half time. The reserve&#x27;s team captain-coached by former seniors&#x27; player Gary Window also had a successful season after finishing the reserve&#x27;s minor premiers (16 wins, 5 loses); they defeated Sturt both in the 2nd Semi Final and then also the 1971 Reserves Grand Final to collect the club&#x27;s first Trophy.

Tony Casserley was appointed captain-coach the following year for the 1972 SANFL season. Centrals started the season with their best ever form, winning 10 out of the first 12 games (only lost against Port Rd 7 and Sturt Rd 10) and had their best minor round to date (14 wins and just 7 losses) and again making the Top 4. The Bulldogs won the first semi-final this time against Norwood by 30 points but again lost the preliminary final against Port Adelaide this time by 6 points (15–14 to 15–20) after leading at 3 quarter time by 21 points.

===First Minor Premiership (1979)===

After finishing with the wooden spoon in 1977, Daryl Hicks, a former premiership player with Sturt (1966–69) and State Player was appointed coach in 1978 and took the Bulldogs to the minor premiership for the first time in the 1979 SANFL season (15 wins 1 draw and 6 losses) but lost the second semi final to Port Adelaide by 26 points after leading at half-time by 14 points and then lost the preliminary final against South Adelaide by 13 points after trailing by 35 points at 3 quarter time (Scoring 7–5 to 4–1 in the last quarter). This made the Centrals one of few teams in the SANFL to have won the minor premiership and not made the grand final.

The 1980 SANFL season started with a Blockbuster game at Home to the 1979 Premiers Port Adelaide in Rd1. In the previous 16 seasons (1964 to 1979) Centrals had only defeated Port Adelaide 5 times (1971 Rd 14, 1973 3 times – Rd 1, Rd 10, Rd 20, 1979 – Rd 18).
With Centrals leading by 24 points at 3 quarter time, the game ended in a thrilling draw (9–18 to 9–18), with Port scoring 4–6 to Centrals 0–6 in the last quarter before an almost full house at Elizabeth with 15,696 spectators (a record crowd for Elizabeth Oval until broken in 1984). The following week, Centrals after trailing by 19pts at 3 quarter time defeated the 1979 Grand Finalists South Adelaide by 1 pt. After two thrilling games to start the 1980s, the rest of the decade entered into disappointment as Centrals failed to win any finals game after qualifying for the finals series under 3 different coaches – Daryl Hicks (1982), Kevin Neale (1984) and Neil Kerley (1988 and 1989).

In 1984, Kevin Cowboy Neale a former St Kilda Premiership player from 1966 replaced Daryl Hicks as Coach. In one of its best ever Minor Seasons Neale coached Central District to 3rd place in the minor round in 1984 just 1 win of top position with 16 wins and 6 losses (Which was a better record than 1979 and included 2 wins over Norwood that season&#x27;s premiers – Rd2 by 43 pts and Rd14 by 95 pts). The minor round was competitive all year. At the end of Round 17 the Bulldogs were on top of the ladder but dropped to 3rd after losses to Port Adelaide in Rd 18 and Glenelg in Rd 19. Round 20 with two rounds left the top 3 teams were only separated by 1 win and very little percentage (Port 15 wins 54.96% , Glenelg 15 wins 54.80%, Centrals 14 wins 54.44%, South 13 wins 55.44% and Norwood 5th with 11 wins). However, despite leading at 1/4 time the Bulldogs again lost both finals (like in 1979) this time the Qualifying Final to Glenelg by 48pts and the 1st Semi Final to Norwood by 13 pts to finish in 4th. (Whilst Norwood went from 5th place and took out their 2nd flag within 3 years). The next 3 seasons the club failed to qualify for the finals under Neale finishing in 6th in 1985 and 1986 and then 8th place in 1987.

In 1988, Neil Kerley was appointed Coach. The club finished the minor round in 2nd place in 1988 (15 wins and 1 draw just the 1/2 game behind Port Adelaide after being at the top of the ladder after Round 19. Loses to Woodville in Rd 20 and Port Adelaide in Rd21 cost the club the minor premiership). The Bulldogs again lost both finals in 1988 and 1989 and finished in 4th place. Again it then dropped out of the top 5 and finished 7th in 1990.

The club lost 12 consecutive finals games it contested between the 1972 Preliminary until the 1994 1st Semi Final. As a result, though often competitive at times in the course of the minor rounds against the stronger teams Centrals became known as something of a choking team in the final series during the 1980s and 90s (i.e. it plays well except for when it really matters).

===Finals Losses Hoodoo Broken (1994) and First Grand Finals (1995 and 1996)===

Alan Stewart is the person most widely thought responsible for the upsurge in Centrals fortunes. Stewart only played two league matches for the Bulldogs and spent the rest of his playing career in the reserves; however, it was as a coach in both the youth sections—and eventually the league team—that he is most revered for at the club. Taking over from Neil Kerley in 1991, Stewart transformed the ethos of the club in only a matter of years. In 1994, Centrals made the SANFL Cup Grand Final (now no longer a separate competition), their first-ever Grand Final appearance, narrowly losing to Woodville-West Torrens. Later in the same year, Centrals defeated Norwood in the 1994 First Semi Final by 4 points, breaking a sequence of 4 Final losses to the Redlegs, and giving the club its first win in any final since beating the same team in the 1972 First Semi-Final.

With the finals hoodoo finally broken after 22 seasons, Centrals finished Minor Premiers for the 2nd time in 1995 (16 wins 1 draw and 5 losses), but lost to Port Adelaide in the 2nd Semi-Final by just 2 points (after trailing by 27 points at three-quarter time). However, the following week Centrals won their first-ever Preliminary Final, this time against Norwood by 24 points to make their first league grand final, against , an event of such significance in the SANFL that the 1995 Grand Final sold out (the first time this had happened since the Adelaide Crows had entered the AFL in 1991). Central&#x27;s Captain Roger Girdham won the toss and controversially chose to kick into the wind in the first quarter. Unfortunately for the Centrals, they trailed by just 5 points—3.6 (24) to 3.11 (29)—at half-time but were outplayed in the second half and beaten 13.16 (94) to 6.10 (46) in front of 45,786 spectators, and Alan Stewart left the club immediately afterward, ironically taking up a recruitment position with Port Adelaide in time for their entry into the Australian Football League for the 1997 Season.

Former Sydney Swans star player Stephen Wright (brother of former player Michael Wright) became league coach in 1996, and Centrals finished minor premiers for the 3rd time (15 wins, 5 losses) and for the first time defeated Port Adelaide in a finals match after 8 successive losses (2nd Semi-Final by 24 points), which saw Centrals make their second Grand Final, once again facing Port Adelaide (who defeated Norwood in the preliminary final by just 4 points after a late goal). Despite having a 4–0 win–loss record (Rd2, Rd11, Rd20, and 2nd Semi) over Port Adelaide for the season which made Centrals the favourites for the 1996 SANFL Grand Final, they again lost to the Port Magpies 11.14 (80) to 6.8 (44) in front of 46,120 at Football Park. As of 2023, this is the record crowd for an SANFL match involving Central District and stands as the best-attended SANFL Grand Final since the formation of the Adelaide Crows for the 1991 AFL Season when 50,589 saw Port Adelaide defeat Glenelg in 1990.

Stevie Wright who was the Premiership Coach (1993 and 1994) at Clarence in Tasmania enticed Danny Hulm a 22-year-old midfielder who was a member of the 1993 and 1994 Clarence premiership teams, Tasmania representative (1994–1996) and Best on Ground in the 1996 Tasmania Grand Final to join Centrals in 1997. Danny won Central&#x27;s Best and Fairest in 1997 in his first season at the club, represented South Australia 3 times (1998–2000), Vice Captained South Australia in 1999 and Captained South Australia in 2000.

Peter Jonas a former Central&#x27;s player and all Australian in 1979 became Coach in 1998. John Platten and Scott Lee were appointed co-captains. Centrals 1998 Finals campaign ended with a lost to Port Adelaide this time in the Elimination Final. Danny Hulm was appointed Club Captain in 1999.

At the end of the 1999 season Central&#x27;s Finals record was Played 26 – Won 6, Lost 20.

==Decade of Domination – 12 Consecutive Grand Finals (2000–2011)==

From the 2000 Season, Centrals built a decade of domination a dynasty rivalled in SANFL history only by the great Port Adelaide teams of the 1950s and 1990s and Sturt teams of the 1960s. Centrals were clearly the dominant side in the 2000s SANFL football competition winning 9 premierships (2000–2001, 2003–2005, 2007–2010) and appearing in every Grand Final between 2000 and 2011, and were the wealthiest SANFL club by some considerable margin (not counting Port Adelaide). Centrals played in 28 Finals games between 2000 and 2011 for a total of 25 wins (which included 12 consecutive 2nd Semi Final wins) and just 3 losses the 2002, 2006, 2011 Grand Finals.

2000 – For more than 100 years one of Port Adelaide, Norwood, North Adelaide or Sturt appeared in every Grand Final. The year 2000 saw the two newest teams Central District and Woodville-West Torrens play off in the Grand Final with Centrals prevailing by 22 points (8.13 to 5.9) for their first SANFL Premiership. Coach Peter Jonas joined St Kilda under SA and VFL/AFL Legend Malcolm Blight and inaugural Premiership captain Daniel Hulm retired at age 25 due to a persistent groin injury and having secured a job in London. Personal tragedy struck when Danny was killed instantly after being hit by a fast train at Surbiton Station in London on 13 March 2001.

2001 – Former North Melbourne and Melbourne Player Alastair Clarkson aged 32 was appointed senior coach and Daniel Healey Captain. The Bulldogs won back to back flags against the Eagles which become known as &quot;Bark to Bark&quot;. []

2002 – Centrals after finishing minor premiers with a 18 wins to 2 losses record (both losses against Norwood who finished the minor round in 2nd place with a 17–3 record) and then winning the 2nd Semi Final by 14 points which was their 4th victory of the season over Sturt (Previous margins 38, 50 and 30 points) the Bulldogs had a shock loss to the Double Blues in the Grand Final in an attempt for a 3rd successive flag. After losing the toss of the coin and having to kick against the wind in the first quarter, missing a chance for early goal and then Damian Hicks going off with injured ribs Centrals had their worst start in a Grand Final scoring just 1 point in the 1st quarter. Sturt then continued to outplay the Dogs in the 2nd quarter with scores being 7.7 (49) to 0.1 (1) at the 19min mark of the term. A couple of goals before half time didn&#x27;t help to close the gap with scores being 2.4 (16) to 8.7 (55). Sturt to continue to outscore Centrals in the last two quarters with the final scores being 6.9 (45) to 13.14 (92) for the Dogs to suffer an even worst defeat than when the losing the Grand Final in 1996 to Port Adelaide.

2003 – 2002 Reserves Premiership Coach and Former player Roy Laird was appointed coach following Alastair Clarkson&#x27;s departure in February 2003. Scott Lee was appointed Assistant and Reserves Coach. The Bulldogs collected their 3rd Flag within the last 4 years when they defeated West Adelaide. Centrals become the first club to win the League, Reserves and Under 19&#x27;s titles in the same season.

2004 – Central&#x27;s 4th Premiership in the 2004 Grand Final against Woodville-West Torrens by 125 points was the biggest winning margin in an SANFL finals match. Future club captain and coach for the 2021 season Paul Thomas was also the club&#x27;s 5th Magarey Medallist.

2005 – Central&#x27;s 5th Premiership (and 3rd in sequence) in the 2005 Grand Final was their 4th against Woodville-West Torrens this time by 28 points.

2006 – Saw the introduction of night SANFL matches under lights at Elizabeth Oval. In the first league match under lights, a crowd of 7,329 attended the match against Sturt. Also in 2006, Centrals played in their seventh consecutive SANFL Grand Final, equalling the record for the most consecutive Grand Final appearances, and setting a new SANFL record for seven consecutive second-semi final wins. After 8 consecutive finals victories against Woodville-West Torrens from 2000 to 2005, Centrals were defeated by the Eagles for the first time in the Grand Final.

2007 – Centrals won the minor round premiership, and then their sixth premiership flag in their 8th consecutive Grand Final appearance. Centrals, therefore, became the only club in SANFL history to have contested 8 consecutive Grand Finals, and also the only SANFL club with 8 consecutive 2nd Semi Finals wins. On 30 June 2007, Centrals defeated Norwood by 158 points, the Redlegs biggest loss on record.

2008 – Centrals extended this record run of consecutive Grand Final appearances to 9, also winning their 9th consecutive Second Semi Final. They also equalled the SANFL record of 7 Premierships in a decade by defeating Glenelg in the SANFL Grand Final before a crowd of over 34,000 at AAMI Stadium.

2009 – Centrals further extended these records, winning their 10th consecutive second-semi final, making their 10th consecutive Grand Final and winning their 8th premiership when they defeated Sturt in the Grand Final. The club&#x27;s record of 10 Grand Finals and 8 premierships in a single decade (2000–2009) is now the all-time record in the long history of the SANFL, surpassing the dynasties of Norwood in the 1880-90s, Port in the 1950s and 1980-90s, and Sturt in the 1960s.

2010 – Central District won their 4th flag in a row beating Norwood by 6 points in front of more than 34,000 people. Ian Callinan won the Jack Oatey Medal for best on ground with 4 goals and twin brothers Chris and James Gowans equalled the record of career premiership medals won by Port Adelaide&#x27;s Geof Motley when they collected their 9th SANFL Premiership Medal.

2011 – Centrals domination continued in the 2011 SANFL season. They won the minor premiership with 17 wins from their 20 games to finish three games clear of Norwood who finished second while captain Paul Thomas finished third in the Magarey Medal count, only 3 votes behind winner James Allan from North Adelaide. This caused controversy as Thomas, who was judged by many to be best on ground for the Dogs Round 22 win over Norwood, was not awarded any Magarey votes (which are awarded on a 3–2–1 basis) by the umpires for the game as he was reported for a high tackle on Norwood&#x27;s Darren Pfeiffer in the final quarter of the match. Ultimately Thomas didn&#x27;t have to face the tribunal as the Match Review Committee, who viewed the video evidence from the ABC telecast, deemed he had no case to answer but by that time the votes were locked away leading many, including Thomas and the CDFC believe he was robbed of his second medal win.

By finishing minor premiers, Centrals earned themselves a week&#x27;s rest before their Second Semi-final match on 25 September. The Bulldogs easily defeated Norwood 12.5 (77) to 4.9 (33) in the 2nd semi to move into their record 12th consecutive SANFL Grand Final and their 14th since 1995. Centrals opponent was Woodville-West Torrens who after losing to Norwood by 61 points in the Qualifying defeated Norwood in the Preliminary Final by 44 points. In the Grand Final Centrals after trailing at every break (including by 24 points at 3/4 time) staged a remarkable comeback in the final quarter and fell just short by 3 points against The Eagles on Grand Final day with their last scoring shot in the dying seconds of the game being a behind. It was the Bulldogs 3rd Grand Final lost since 2000 and brought to an end a run of 4 consecutive Grand Final victories.

Between 2000 and 2011, such was the domination by the Bulldogs that they were the first side to qualify for the SANFL Grand Final every year with only 2002, 2006 and 2011 not being premiership-winning years. While their Grand Final record was 9–3, the Bulldogs held a remarkable 12–0 record in the Second Semi Final for the same period. In stark contrast to the period from 1964 to 1999, Centrals Finals record for the period 2000 to 2011 was Played 28 – Won 25 Lost 3 (2002,2006 &amp; 2011 Grand Finals).

==Finals Qualifications without success (2012–2017)==

2012 – The run of 12 consecutive Grand Finals appearances ended in 2012 after finishing the Minor Round in 2nd position, Centrals lost both finals – Qualifying to West Adelaide by 27 points and the 1st Semi Final to North Adelaide by 88 points.

2013 – Centrals qualified for the Finals for the 14th successive season but lost the Elimination Final to North Adelaide.

2014 – For the 1st time since 1999 and only the 2nd time in 21 seasons Centrals failed to qualified for the Finals – finishing 7th after winning just 2 games (against Norwood and North Adelaide) in the first 9 rounds but then winning 7 out of the last 8 games (losing to Norwood) before losing in the last round to North Adelaide and missing the finals by one win and percentage. So in a season of 2 halves – Centrals defeated every team once (including 4 of 5 finalists in the 2nd half of the season), but also lost to every team once.

2015 – After being out of the Top 5 all season, Centrals made another late dash and qualified by percentage for the Finals by defeating 5th place South Adelaide on their home ground in the last round. Centrals won 6 out of their last 8 games including their last 3 games, whilst South Adelaide lost 4 out of their last 5 games. In the first 2 weeks of the Finals Centrals defeated both of the 2014 Grand Finalists. Norwood in the Elimination Final (ending their quest for a 4th successive Flag) and Port Adelaide by 5 pts in the 1st Semi. However, the run of 5 wins came to halt in the Preliminary Final with a lost to West Adelaide who went on to win their First Flag since 1983.

2016 – Qualifying for the Finals in 5th place and for the 16th time in the last 17 seasons – Centrals were decisively defeated by the Adelaide Crows Reserves in the Elimination Final.

2017 – Centrals again qualified for the Finals in 5th place on percentage after Glenelg lost in the last round. Centrals (5th), South (6th), Glenelg (7th) all finished with 8 wins and were separated only on Percentage. Centrals defeated Norwood in the Elimination Final – giving the Dogs their 5th successive victory over the Redlegs in Finals. Centrals lost to Sturt in the 1st Semi Final after trailing by 2 pts at 3 quarter time in what was a close game all day by 7 points. Sturt went on to defeat Port Adelaide in the Grand Final by 1 point.

Centrals Finals record from 2012 to 2017 was played 9, won 3 (Norwood twice, Port Adelaide once) Lost 6

==No Finals Qualifications (2018–2022)==

2018 – After qualifying for the Finals 17 times out of the last 18 seasons (2000–2017) and 23 times out of the last 25 seasons (1993–2017). Centrals failed to qualify for the finals finishing in 8th place their lowest result since 1992.

2019 – At the end of the season Roy Laird retired after 17 Seasons (which included 7 League Flags) as the League Coach.

Following the departure of Roy Laird as coach the club has slumped to 2nd last place for seasons 2020 to 2022.

==Finals Qualifications (2023–2024)==

2023 - Central qualified for finals for the first time in 5 years in 4th place after defeating Port Adelaide in the last minor round game. Both teams then played in the elimination final the following week where Central defeated Port for the 2nd time in 2 weeks this time by 7 pts. However, the finals campaign came to an end following a lost to Sturt in the 1st semi final.

<text>Carmichael is a lunar impact crater that is located along the eastern edge of the Sinus Amoris, in the northeastern quadrant of the Moon&#x27;s near side. Its diameter is 20 km. It was named after American psychologist Leonard Carmichael, and lies within a couple of crater diameters south-southwest of the smaller crater Hill. Further to the east-northeast is the prominent crater Macrobius. Carmichael was designated Macrobius A before being given its current name by the IAU.

Carmichael is generally circular, with a small floor at the middle of the sloping interior walls. There is a low rise of scree along the southeast inner wall. The crater is free of notable impacts along the rim or the interior, although a tiny craterlet is situated in the lunar mare just outside the rim to the south-southwest.

<doc id="1207792" wikidata="Q3149417" url="?curid=1207792" title="Imperial Federation">
<text>The Imperial Federation was a series of proposals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to create a federal union to replace the existing British Empire, presenting it as an alternative to colonial imperialism. No such proposal was ever adopted, but various schemes were popular in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and other colonial territories. The project was championed by Unionists such as Joseph Chamberlain as an alternative to William Gladstone&#x27;s proposals for home rule in Ireland.

Many proposals were put forward, but none commanded majority support. The Imperial Federation League, the main advocacy group, split into two factions in 1893, with one group promoting imperial defence and the other encouraging imperial trade. Various proposals were put forward, with most of them calling for a single state with an imperial parliament headquartered in London. Such proposals were never put into effect, and decolonisation would eventually happen to a vast majority of Britain&#x27;s colonies beginning from the mid 20th century.

The new parliament was envisioned to cooperatively deal with internal trade, foreign relations, defence, and other issues that affected the entire federation. The new parliament would have representatives from India that would rule the latter directly, while the dominions such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland, and South Africa as well as crown colonies such as Cyprus, Gibraltar, Malta, and Singapore would have internal self-government, although still accountable to this new parliament in London, similar to devolution that was granted to Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales during the late 20th century. In the Imperial Federation, Ireland would also have self-government, which was expected to reduce demand for independence in Ireland.

==Motivations==
By the 1880s the British Empire covered a quarter of the world&#x27;s land area, and included a fifth of the world&#x27;s population. There was no doubt about the vastness of the potential, and there was agreement that opportunities were largely wasted because politically and constitutionally there was no unity, no common policies, no agreed central direction, no &quot;permanent binding force&quot; said Alfred Milner. Associations were formed and discussions were held to come up with a solution.

The British Empire consisted of many colonies, several of which were largely self-governing dominions (Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the Straits Settlements). Most were ruled by colonial officials including India, the West Indies, and Fiji. The future of the empire remained uncertain, as it was unclear what the result would be if all colonies eventually became self-governing. Among other concerns, it would be very difficult for British interests to be maintained if every colony was essentially already sovereign.

New national identities emerging throughout the dominions was also a cause for concern. Growing autonomy for Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa led to each of them adopting coats of arms of their own rather than continuing to use those of the United Kingdom. Some felt that the growing status of the dominions was not reflected in British symbols such as the Union Jack, and this led to calls for the creation of unifying symbols such as a British Empire flag to represent a new multinational reality.

Creating an Imperial Federation thus became a popular alternative proposal to colonial imperialism. The plan was never firm, but the general proposal was to create a single federal state among all colonies of the British Empire. The federation would have a common parliament and would be governed as a superstate. Thus, Imperial unity could be maintained while still allowing for democratic government. The colonies would increase their influence while Britain would be able to share the costs of imperial defence. The best features of large states could be combined with the best features of small states. It was seen as a method of solving the Home Rule problem in Ireland, as England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland (along with the other members of the Old Commonwealth) would have their own Parliaments. Westminster would become a purely Imperial body.

Supporters of the Imperial Federation regarded the United Kingdom as having two possible futures: imperial union of its colonies consisting of different ethnic groups and continued long-term importance in global affairs, or imperial dissolution and the reduction of the status of the country to a second-class nation with little to no power projection. In response to claims that geography was against federation on such a large scale, it was said that scientific advancements would solve the difficulty. Edward Ellis Morris reminded listeners to his lecture in 1885 that it was now as easy to reach London from Melbourne or Singapore as it had been to reach London from Orkney at the time of the Acts of Union 1707, or to reach Washington, D.C. from San Francisco before 1869.

Albert Venn Dicey in 1897 proposed an Anglo-Saxon &quot;intercitizenship&quot; during an address to the Fellows of All Souls at Oxford.

==Organisation==
The Imperial Federation League was founded in London in 1884 and subsequent branches were established in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Barbados, and British Guiana. While the proposal was often associated with segments of the British Conservative Party, it was also popular among Liberal Imperialists (proponents of New Imperialism) such as William Edward Forster. Several members of the Imperial Federation League were motivated by ethnonationalism, drawing inspiration from the writing of theorists such as Sir Charles Dilke and John Robert Seeley to call for a &quot;Greater Britain&quot; which would also encompass the predominantly white self-governing colonies and dominions. The League could not agree on its primary role of focusing on either defence or trade, and was dissolved in 1893.

Canadian advocates of imperial federation were termed &quot;Canadian Imperialists&quot; and their ideology was &quot;Canadian Imperialism&quot; in Canadian historiography since Carl Berger&#x27;s 1970 book &quot;The Sense of Power&quot; identified this as a separate ideology from Canadian nationalism. Noted Canadian Imperialists included George Monro Grant, Sir George Robert Parkin, Stephen Leacock, Sir Sam Hughes, and George Taylor Denison III.

In 1900, Thomas Hedderwick, a Scottish Liberal Party MP, raised the issue in the British House of Commons. Recalling to the House the contributions of Dadabhai Naoroji and Mancherjee Bhownagree, Indian MPs serving in the House of Commons, Hedderwick mooted the possibility that an autonomous India might one day be represented in an Imperial Parliament.

==Obstacles==
One of the main obstacles to the scheme was what one of its proponents, Richard Jebb, called colonial nationalism. The granting of authority to a super-parliament composed of many competing interests was seen by opponents as a compromise to the powers of the local parliaments. Leading colonial supporters of imperial federation, such as Australian prime minister Alfred Deakin and Canadian Minister of Militia and Defence Sir Sam Hughes, however saw the movement as a way to increase the influence of the dominions over imperial defence and foreign policy. The colonial branches of the Imperial Federation League in fact outlived the demise of the home branch in London, which collapsed in 1896 when it failed to resolve internal disputes over imperial trade policy.

While Joseph Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1895 to 1903, was sympathetic to the idea, his proposals for a permanent Imperial Council or Council of the Empire which would be a kind of Imperial Parliament passing policies that would bind colonial governments, was rejected at the 1897 Colonial Conference and 1902 Colonial Conferences due to fears that such a scheme would undermine the autonomy of colonies. Similarly, proposals for centralising the Empire&#x27;s armed forces were also rejected as were his proposals for an Empire customs union. At subsequent Imperial Conferences, proposals for Imperial preferential trade were rejected by the British Liberal governments due to their preference for international free trade. It would not be until the British Empire Economic Conference in 1932 that Imperial Preference would be implemented; however, the policy did not survive World War II.

==Decline==
Support for imperial federation waned with World War I which produced greater feelings of national identity in several dominions, Canada and Australia in particular. Defence concerns and problems of imperial cooperation were partially resolved through the system of Colonial or Imperial Conferences and with growing sentiments by various dominion governments for greater independence resulting in the Balfour Declaration of 1926 and the Statute of Westminster 1931. It was last discussed seriously at the governmental level at the 1937 Imperial Conference where it was dismissed.

The idea of Imperial unity was carried on after World War I by Lionel Curtis and the Round Table movement, which continues to this day as a forum and promoter of the Commonwealth of Nations and also by the Royal Commonwealth Society which continues to promote the Commonwealth.

In recent years, following the United Kingdom&#x27;s decision to leave the European Union, many of the concepts behind the Imperial Federation have found a new life within the CANZUK movement. Critics sceptical of the CANZUK movement make the argument that &quot;distance and the size of trading partners matter more than historical links in determining trading relationships between countries&quot;. Conversely, advocates argue that technological advances now make it possible to fly from the United Kingdom to Australia in under 24 hours, seriously overcoming the limitation of distance which hampered the idea a century ago. They remark that internet and the ability to instant message/call the other side of the world has greatly increased the connectivity between these four countries. In August 2018 the Canadian Conservative Party proposed a CANZUK treaty which aims to achieve free trade in goods and services, visa-free travel arrangements, reciprocal healthcare, increased consumer choice, increased travel protection, and security co-ordination between the four countries. The CANZUK treaty has some political support in the minor political parties of other CANZUK countries, with the New Zealand ACT Party, the British Unionist Party, and the UK Libertarian Party all explicitly stating their support for CANZUK. The Australian Liberal Democrats have not referenced CANZUK directly but have stated support for policies which align with the aims of CANZUK.

<doc id="1207794" wikidata="Q1051986" url="?curid=1207794" title="Cayley (crater)">
<text>Cayley is a small lunar impact crater that is located in a lava-flooded region to the west of Mare Tranquillitatis. It was named after the 19th-century English mathematician Arthur Cayley. It lies to the northwest of the smaller crater De Morgan and the larger D&#x27;Arrest. West and slightly north of Cayley is Whewell, a crater of about the same dimensions. To the north is a linear rille designated Rima Ariadaeus, which follows a course to the east-southeast.

==Description==
This is a circular, bowl-shaped formation with a small interior floor at the midpoint. (Small being relative to the overall diameter, as it occupies about one-fourth the total cross-section.) The sloping interior walls are relatively light in hue, having a higher albedo as the surrounding terrain. However it is not nearly as bright as the slightly larger crater Dionysius to the east-southeast, and lacks a ray system.

The smooth, rolling plains to the east of this crater are called the Cayley Formation. It is somewhat similar to the lunar maria, but has a slightly higher albedo and is overlapped at the eastern edge by the Mare Tranquillitatis. Lunar scientists suspect that this plain may have resulted from deposits of ejecta from the formation of large impact basins such as Mare Imbrium or Mare Orientale. (The most likely source is the Mare Imbrium impact basin to the northwest.)

Cayley is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

<text>Anne-Marie Martin (born Edmonda Benton; November 11, 1957) is a Canadian screenwriter, equestrian, and former actress who is best known for playing Sgt. Dori Doreau in the American television comedy series &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot; from 1986 to 1988, as well as her roles in several horror films, such as &quot;Prom Night&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Boogens&quot; (1981).

==Early life==
Martin was born Edmonda Benton in Toronto, Ontario on November 11, 1957. Prior to embarking on a screen acting career, she worked for theater director Hrant Alianak in Toronto, performing at the Theatre Passe Muraille.

== Career ==

In her early career, Martin was credited under the name Eddie Benton, most notably in the unsuccessful series pilot/telefilm &quot;Dr. Strange&quot; (1978), for which she was paid $2,000 a week. She subsequently appeared in the slasher film &quot;Prom Night&quot; (1980), &quot;Savage Harvest&quot; (1981), &quot;The Boogens&quot; (1981), and had a cameo in &quot;Halloween II&quot; (1981); as well as numerous TV series guest roles. Among these were Stella Breed, a woman with psychokinetic powers in the &quot;Buck Rogers in the 25th Century&quot; episode &quot;Twiki is Missing&quot;, and an officer who faces an amputation after injury in the line of duty on &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot;.

Prior to this, Martin appeared in &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot; (1979), a low-budget Canadian science fiction film that attempted to capitalize on the popularity of &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. Martin had previously auditioned for the role of Princess Leia in &quot;Star Wars&quot;. She was also a regular on the short-lived 1977 series &quot;Rafferty&quot; opposite Patrick McGoohan and appeared in the equally short-lived &quot;Time Express&quot; in 1979.

In the early 1980s, she appeared in a &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot; episode in which she and Victor French traded bodies. From 1982 to 1985, she appeared as attorney Gwen Davies on the soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. Alan Spencer subsequently cast her in &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot;, as Dori Doreau; he also wrote an episode of the series that allowed her to, if not exactly change bodies with Sledge Hammer, at least impersonate him. Martin appeared as Doreau on the series from 1986 until 1988.

== Personal life ==
Martin married author Michael Crichton in 1987 (she had a small role in Crichton&#x27;s film &quot;Runaway&quot; three years earlier), and following the cancellation of &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot;, retired from TV and film acting. In 1989, they had a daughter, Taylor-Anne. Martin co-wrote, with Crichton, the screenplay to the 1996 film &quot;Twister&quot;. The couple separated in 2001 and divorced in 2003.

Martin went on to pursue her love of horses and ride competitively. She rode for Team USA in the World Championship competition for Icelandic horses.

<text>Bruland is a farming village located about east of the town of Førde in the municipality of Sunnfjord in Vestland county, Norway. The population (2001) of Bruland was 212. It is located just south of the river Jølstra, along the European route E39 highway. The lake Holsavatnet is located about east of Bruland and the small Moskog area lies at the western end of that island. The name of the hamlet, &quot;Bruland&quot; literally means &#x27;land of bridges&#x27;. Historically, many of the people who worked on the local farm took the surname &quot;Bruland&quot;.

Bruland was the home of the bailiff or for the whole Sunnfjord region from 1567 until the end of the nineteenth century. One of the farm buildings at Bruland was moved there from the island of Svanøya (in Flora municipality) in 1789. Many of the old buildings have been restored and are now protected.

<text>Shmuel Zakai (; born 1963) is an Israeli Brigadier General who was forcibly discharged from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in November 2004 by order of chief of staff Moshe Yaalon.

Zakai resigned as commander of the IDF&#x27;s Gaza Division, a position he had held since March 2004, after failing a polygraph test during an investigation into leaks to the Israeli media during the Days of Penitence operation in the northern Gaza Strip in October 2004. Zakai was accused of leaking reports to the media that the IDF wanted to end the operation before the political echelon did.

After resigning as head of the Gaza Division, Zakai was removed from the IDF altogether after 24 years of service, with Yaalon saying that his actions had constituted &quot;an abandonment of a division during combat.&quot; He was replaced by Aviv Kochavi, a former commander of the Paratroopers Brigade.

Zakai&#x27;s previous positions include:
*2002–2004: Commander, Edom Division
*1999–2001: Commander, Golani infantry brigade
*1998–1999: Commander, Hiram Formation (Northern Command)
*1995–1996: Battalion commander, IDF Officer&#x27;s School
*1993–1994: Deputy commander, Hiram Formation
*1981–1994: Served in various positions in the Golani Brigade, up to battalion commander.

Zakai was reportedly close to Defense Minister and former chief of staff Shaul Mofaz, who promoted him to brigadier general before he attained a division command.

Zakai is a graduate of the IDF Staff College and has a degree in humanities from Tel Aviv University.

<text>Condon is a lunar impact crater that lies on the eastern shore of the Sinus Successus, a bay along the northeast edge of Mare Fecunditatis. It was named after American physicist Edward U. Condon in 1976. It lies midway between the larger crater Apollonius to the north and the smaller Webb to the south on the Mare Fecunditatis. Condon was previously designated Webb R.

This is a lava-flooded crater remnant with only low rim segments surviving to the east and west. There is a break in the rim to the south and a wider break to the northwest of the crater. The crater interior is nearly level, and mark only by a few low rises in the surface.

<doc id="1207807" wikidata="Q687294" url="?curid=1207807" title="Lord Howe woodhen">
<text>The Lord Howe woodhen (Hypotaenidia sylvestris) also known as the Lord Howe Island woodhen or Lord Howe (Island) rail, is a flightless bird of the rail family, (Rallidae). It is endemic to Lord Howe Island off the Australian coast. It is currently classified as endangered by the IUCN.

==Description==
The Lord Howe woodhen is a small olive brown bird, with a short tail and a downcurved bill. Wings are chestnut with darker bars. The eyes have a red iris.

==Ecology==
The species lives in sub-tropical forests, feeding on earthworms, crustaceans, fruit, and occasionally taking the eggs of shearwaters and petrels.

Woodhens mate for life and are usually encountered in pairs. They are territorial and will appear from the forest&#x27;s understory to investigate the source of any unusual noise. A mated pair will defend an area of approximately three hectares, with offspring being expelled from this area once grown. The population of birds is thus restricted by the amount of available territory.

== Decline and recovery ==
When explorers first discovered Lord Howe Island in 1788, they identified 15 bird species including the then common woodhen. Being flightless, curious, and having never been hunted, they became a readily available source of food for visiting sailors and the island&#x27;s early human population. Since its discovery and the arrival of settlers on the island in 1834, nine of these 15 species became extinct. The woodhen declined in numbers until the late 1970s, when surveys showed that the population had dropped to fewer than 30 birds, confined to the difficult to access summit regions of the island&#x27;s two mountains, Mount Gower and Mount Lidgbird. The woodhen was at the very brink of extinction in 1980, with just 15 individuals found.

A comprehensive study was carried out to determine the cause of the decline, which was eventually attributed to the introduction of feral pigs. The elimination of the pigs and other disruptive animals (goats), plus a programme of ex-situ conservation (captive breeding) which commenced in May 1980 (the first egg was laid in June 1980), allowed the Lord Howe woodhen to recover its numbers. The captive breeding program was funded with $150,000 from the Foundation for National Parks &amp; Wildlife, which was spent to construct the compound and to employ scientists involved in this project.

In 2007–2008 there were about 250 birds on the island, which may be the optimal population size for this area. The population of adult birds in 2018 was 212.
Following a successful rodent eradication on Lord Howe Island from 2019-2021, the woodhen population has increased significantly. A woodhen survey in 2021 found 598 birds, and in a further survey in March 2022 there were thought to be at least 779.

The analysis of the threats to the Lord Howe woodhen, and the implemented solution, is considered a model for conservation biology. A number of possible causes of the decline were identified on the island, from introduced rats to Tasmanian masked owls. However, only the elimination of the pigs would have saved the species from extinction, and identifying the cause and solution in a timely manner was crucial to the success of the programme.

Following success with the woodhen, there have been recovery efforts for other endemic species on Lord Howe Island, including the Lord Howe flax snail (&quot;Placostylus bivaricosus&quot;) and the Lord Howe currawong (&quot;Strepera graculina crissalis&quot;).

==Gilbert rail==
A rail, known only from a single specimen in the form of an alcohol-preserved skin at Harvard, was originally believed to have been collected on one of the Gilbert Islands and named as the Gilbert rail, &quot;Gallirallus conditicius&quot; (Peters &amp; Griscom, 1928).

However, the island attributed to this holotype is low, rocky and sandy, and has no habitat suitable for a rail.

It now appears that a curatorial error led to the specimen being labeled to the wrong collection, and the specimen is actually an immature female Lord Howe woodhen. It differs from that species only in a paler crown, throat and underparts, and browner head, but long immersion in alcohol could have changed the colour. The island to which the specimen was originally attributed is 4,500 km from Lord Howe Island, and it appears improbable that two flightless rails could evolve separately with no morphological differences.

<doc id="1207820" wikidata="Q1079821" url="?curid=1207820" title="Cremona (crater)">
<text>Cremona is a lunar impact crater that is located along the north-northwestern limb of the Moon. From the Earth this crater is viewed from the side, and the visibility is affected by libration effects. To be viewed in any detail, this crater must be seen or photographed from orbit. It is located midway between the crater Boole to the south-southeast and, on the far side of the Moon, the crater Lindblad.

This is a relatively old, worn crater that is overlaid by a number of smaller craters. The rim has been worn down and rounded by lesser impacts, leaving only a wide depression in the surface with somewhat irregular interior walls. Small craters lie across the north and northwestern rims, and the satellite crater Cremona L is laid across the southern rim. A band of tiny craterlets lies across the northeastern part of the rim, continuing part of a pattern of multiple craterlets that continue to the north.

The craters Cremona B and C form a double-crater pair in the northwestern part of the floor. The inner wall on the western side is unusually wide, forming a rough interior surface. The floor in the eastern half is more level, and contains the remnant of a central peak attached to the eastern rim of Cremona C.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Cremona.

<text>The Arabat Spit (; ; ) or Arabat Arrow is a barrier spit that separates the large, shallow, salty Syvash lagoons from the Sea of Azov. The spit runs between the Henichesk Strait in the north and the north-eastern shores of Crimea in the south. It is the largest of several spits of the Sea of Azov.

==Name==
The spit is commonly called the Arabat Arrow (, &quot;Arabatska strilka&quot;; ; , &quot;Arabatskaya strelka&quot;) in Russia and Ukraine. It has been called an &quot;arrow&quot; since at least the middle of the 19th century.

The &quot;Arabat&quot; part of the name comes from the Arabat Fortress, a 17th-century Turkish fort at the southern end of the spit. &quot;Arabat&quot; derives from either Arabic &quot;rabat&quot; meaning a &quot;military post&quot; or Arabic &quot;rabad&quot; meaning a &quot;suburb&quot;.

==Geography and geology==
The Arabat Arrow is long, and from wide. Its surface area is and thus the average width is . The spit is low and straight on the Azov Sea side, whereas its Sivash side is more convoluted. It contains two areas which are wide and have brown-clay hills. They are located and from the Henichesk Strait.

The top layers of other parts of the spit are formed by sand and shells washed by the flows of the Azov Sea. Its vegetation mostly consists of various weed grasses, thorn, festuce grasses, spear grass, crambe, salsola, salicornia, Carex colchica, tamarisk, rose hip, liquorice, etc. 

Offshore water is shallow with the depth reaching only some from the shore. Its temperature is around in winter (near freezing), in spring and autumn, and in summer; air temperature is almost the same.

The spit is very young and was created by sedimentation processes around 1100–1200 AD.

==History==
The Arabat Arrow was wild until 1835 when a road and five stations at intervals were built along it for postal delivery. Later in the 19th century, 25 rural and 3 military settlements and one village named Arabat appeared on the spit. The rural population amounted to some 235 people whose occupation was mostly fishing, farming, and salt production. The latter activity is traditional for the region due to the vast areas of shallow and very saline water in the Sivash lagoons. Salt production in the 19th century was about on the Arabat Arrow alone.

During the deportation of Crimean Tatars on May 18, 1944, most of the Tatars were forcibly transported from Crimea to Central Asia in freight wagons. The Soviet authorities tried to drown the Crimean Tatars from the Arabat spit in the sea on a barge, and those who tried to swim ashore were shot.

Nowadays, the spit is a health resort and its Azov Sea side is used as a beach.

While the spit is geophysically part of the Crimean Peninsula, politically its northern half belongs to Kherson Oblast, Ukraine, while its southern portion is located within the boundaries of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, a territory internationally recognized as part of Ukraine, which came under Russian military occupation in 2014. Since then, the Russian Federation administers the peninsula as the Republic of Crimea. The entirety of the spit was occupied during the annexation, although Russia withdrew its forces from the northern Kherson side in December 2014. The entire spit came under Russian control on 25 February 2022, one day after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

On 5 January 2023, Vladimir Saldo, head of the Russian occupation authorities in Kherson Oblast, stated that a new city would be planned on the spit. He urged preferential mortgages be offered to attract residents from the Russian Federation.

==Populated places==
The rural communities of Henicheska Hirka, Shchaslyvtseve and Strilkove are located in the northern section of the spit, within the Kherson Oblast. The community of Solyane is located in the southern part of the spit, administered as part of the Republic of Crimea.

== Tourism ==
Arabat Spit is a popular place for summer vacation among Ukrainians because of the warm water of the Sea of Azov. There are a variety of hotels and guesthouses on the first line of the sea. Arabat Spit is popular among kitesurfers and windsurfers.

<text>Cusanus is a lunar impact crater that is located near the northeastern limb of the Moon. In this location the crater appears very foreshortened when observed from the Earth, and its visibility is affected by libration. The northern rim of Cusanus is nearly joined to the south-southeastern rim of the larger crater Petermann. To the west is Baillaud and to the southeast is Hayn.

The rim of this crater has been eroded and rounded due to a history of minor impacts. The s are still visible along the inner walls, although they are less sharply defined compared to younger crater formations. A pair of tiny craters form a notch along the eastern rim, and there is a slight inward bulge along the western inner wall.

The interior has been resurfaced with lava, leaving a flat and relatively featureless floor. But the lava was not of sufficient depth to significantly reduce the width of the inner walls.

The name of the crater was approved by the IAU in 1935.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Cusanus.

<doc id="1207830" wikidata="Q419806" url="?curid=1207830" title="Cerium(III) chloride">
<text>Cerium(III) chloride (CeCl3), also known as cerous chloride or cerium trichloride, is a compound of cerium and chlorine. It is a white hygroscopic salt; it rapidly absorbs water to form hydrates, which may be of variable composition.The hexa- and heptahydrate CeCl3·7H2O are known. All forms are highly soluble in water, and the anhydrous derivative is soluble in ethanol and acetone.

==Preparation of anhydrous CeCl3==
Simple rapid heating of the hydrate alone may cause small amounts of hydrolysis.

A useful form of anhydrous CeCl3 can be prepared if care is taken to heat the heptahydrate gradually to over many hours under vacuum. This may or may not contain a little CeOCl from hydrolysis, but it is suitable for use with organolithium and Grignard reagents. Pure anhydrous CeCl3 can be made by dehydration of the hydrate either by slowly heating to with 4–6 equivalents of ammonium chloride under high vacuum, or by heating with an excess of thionyl chloride for three hours. The anhydrous halide may alternatively be prepared from cerium metal and hydrogen chloride. It is usually purified by high temperature sublimation under high vacuum. Soxhlet extraction of with thf gives .

==Uses==
Cerium(III) chloride can be used as a starting point for the preparation of other cerium salts, such as the Lewis acid cerium(III) trifluoromethanesulfonate.

===Organic synthesis===
Cerium(III) chloride is a reagent in several procedures used in organic synthesis. 
Luche reduction of alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds has become a popular method in organic synthesis, where CeCl3·7H2O is used in conjunction with sodium borohydride. For example, carvone gives only the allylic alcohol 1 and none of the saturated alcohol 2. Without CeCl3, a mixture of 1 and 2 is formed.

It can also deprotect MEM group to alcohol in the presence of other acetal protecting groups (e.g. THP.)

Another important use in organic synthesis is for alkylation of ketones, which would otherwise form enolates if simple organolithium reagents were to be used. For example, compound 3 would be expected to simply form an enolate without CeCl3 being present, but in the presence of CeCl3 smooth alkylation occurs:


It is reported that organolithium reagents work more effectively in this reaction than do Grignard reagents.

<doc id="1207834" wikidata="Q14934884" url="?curid=1207834" title="Long Bay Correctional Centre">
<text>The Long Bay Correctional Complex, commonly called Long Bay, is a correctional facility comprising a heritage-listed maximum and minimum security prison for males and females and a hospital to treat prisoners, psychiatric cases and remandees, located in Malabar, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The complex is located approximately south of the Sydney CBD and is contained within a site. The facility is operated by Corrective Services New South Wales, a department administered by the Government of New South Wales.

The Complex accepts sentenced and unsentenced felons under New South Wales and/or Commonwealth legislation and comprises three separate facilities including the Long Bay Hospital (a maximum security institution for medical and psychiatric cases); the Metropolitan Special Programs Centre (a maximum/minimum security institution); and the Special Purpose Centre (a maximum security institution for inmates requiring special protection).

Designed by Walter Liberty Vernon, the complex is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register with the following statement of significance:
The prisons&#x27; yards are built in an Panopticon style.

==History==
===Indigenous history===
Before the 1780s, local Aboriginal people in the area used the site for fishing and cultural activities - rock engravings, grinding grooves and middens remain in evidence.
In 1789, Governor Philip referred to &quot;a long bay&quot;, which became known as Long Bay. Aboriginal people are believed to have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 20,000 years. The population of Aboriginal people between Palm Beach and Botany Bay in 1788 has been estimated to have been 1500. Those living south of Port Jackson to Botany Bay were the Cadigal people who spoke Dharug, while the local clan name of Maroubra people was &quot;Muru-ora-dial&quot;. By the mid nineteenth century the traditional owners of this land had typically either moved inland in search of food and shelter, or had died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers.

===Colonial history===
One of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street.

Randwick takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821–86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841as a 21 year old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the he bought from Marsh, and called his property &quot;Randwick&quot;. The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude&#x27;s stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.

Randwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St.Paul&#x27;s Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive.

In 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859.

Randwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony&#x27;s history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860. When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish Randwick Racecourse, Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait&#x27;s venture prospered, however and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick. The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation. Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life.

Today, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby University of NSW and the Prince of Wales Hospital.

===Long Bay Gaol history===

Long Bay was opened due to the imminent closure of Darlinghurst Gaol. The State Reformatory for Women was opened in 1909 and the State Penitentiary for Men was opened beside it in 1914. Gallows were in operation at the complex from 1917 to 1939. The reformatory became part of the prison in the late 1950s, known as the Long Bay Penitentiary. After the Silverwater Women&#x27;s Correctional Centre (formerly known as Mulawa) was opened in 1970, the women&#x27;s prison was vacated and converted into a medium security prison for men.

A report on prison reform released in 1946 found overcrowding at Long Bay. It recommended that sewerage replace pan systems in major gaols and that prisoners should have two more hours each day out of their cells.

On Christmas Eve (24 December) 1985, Australian musician Paul Kelly performed at Long Bay.

A significant public health case arose in July 1990 when a mentally ill, HIV-positive prisoner was being escorted in the exercise yard. The prisoner took a syringe filled with his blood and stabbed a probationary prison officer. The prison officer was diagnosed with the virus five weeks later and died in 1997, aged 28.

In the late 1990s the facility was redeveloped to offer special treatment units which offer programs for sex offenders; those with intellectual disabilities; drug and alcohol abuse; or the use of violence.

Australian serial killer Ivan Milat spent the rest of his life in prison at Long Bay until his death on 27 October 2019.

===Katingal facility===
In 1975, a prominent supermax prison block was completed, known as Katingal. It was designed to house terrorists as well as problematic prisoners which had been identified as difficult offenders within the NSW prison system, replacing the intractable section at Grafton Gaol. It was considered to be inescapable and dubbed as an ‘electronic zoo&#x27; by inmates due to its electronically controlled confinement with artificial lights and air, depriving inmates from almost all contact from the outside world. The facility with its 40 prison cells had electronically operated doors, accompanied by several surveillance cameras, which were to supplement the existent security facilities within the unit. Although the unit did not have windows, it was serviced by a fully integrated air-conditioning system which circulated fresh air throughout. Additionally, inmates were permitted to engage in physical exercise in two purpose-built yards situated at each end of the unit. Several &#x27;blind spots&#x27; that were not corrected during the initial design and construction of the facility led to a single escape by inmate, Russell &#x27;Mad Dog&#x27; Cox, an armed robber and hostage-taker, who escaped after cutting through a bar on the roof of one of the exercise yards. He remained on the run for 11 years. 

The facility became the centre of mainly critical media attention, and was heavily criticised by Justice John Nagle during proceedings of the Nagle Royal Commission (1976–1978) who recommended its immediate closure. The recommendation that Katingal be closed was accepted, but only after a campaign lasting months.

On 17 March 1989, Michael Yabsley, Minister for Corrective Services, announced that Katingal would be reopened as a correctional facility. When it was realised that the redevelopment of the site would cost double the 8 million allocated, plans were put on hold until a feasibility study was completed on the entire Long Bay prison complex. Demolition of Katingal began in March 2006.

== Description ==
Male Penitentiary:
The former Male Penitentiary comprised 6 two-storey cell wings, a debtors&#x27; prison, workshop, hospital and observation ward, all arranged around three sides of the complex with a &quot;sterile zone&quot; between them and the perimeter wall. The kitchen block stood in the centre facing the entrance block. The Penitentiary incorporated 352 single cells of size 3.96x2.13m and 3 punishment cells.

Four of the six wings had back-to-back cells opening directly to the outdoors.

The same palette of materials was used by Vernon throughout the dual prison establishment. Walls are predominantly of brick, good quality &quot;commons&quot; of a drab brown colour, with plain or rusticated sandstone dressing around windows and doors, and roofs of corrugated iron.

Entrance Block:
The exception is the entrance block which evokes a medieval castle gatehouse in Federation Gothic style. Technological advances such as electric lighting, reinforced concrete floors and the new tramway were made full use of in the design.

As at 8 November 2000, most of the external brickwork of the cell wings have been painted and unsympathetic alterations and additions have occurred over the years. However, most of the original fabric remains intact. All buildings appear to be in good condition.

=== Modifications and dates ===
The workshop, kitchen and observation ward have been demolished and the back-to-back cell wings have been disused for some time.

*s the Penitentiary was reported as overcrowded, receiving 70% of all gaol entries and functioning as a remand centre. The overflow was accommodated by timber huts erected between the male and female prisons, and part of the women&#x27;s prison in 1945.
*1962 Penitentiary absorbed the old Reformatory.
*1978 Observation Ward demolished. Christmas Day 1978, workshops were burnt down during a riot.
*1993 after a series of name changes, the Penitentiary, together with the former Reformatory, was renamed Reception and Industrial Centre.
*2008 Forensic Hospital established outside the prison wall on western &quot;corner&quot; of site. The Pharmacy was established in the ground floor of this hospital.

==Current divisions==
 it was reported that the prison held approximately 1,200 prisoners, with capacity estimated as 1,000, resulting in overcrowding of the correctional centre.

=== Long Bay Hospital ===
The new Long Bay Hospital is a maximum security facility which holds a total of 120 inmate patients in four wards. It is jointly administered by Corrective Services NSW and NSW Health&#x27;s Justice Health and Forensic Mental Health Network (Justice Health). The hospital became operational in July 2008, replacing the old Long Bay Hospital which was completely demolished in October 2008. The site of the old Long Bay Hospital is now the Long Bay Forensic Hospital, which took its first patients in late November 2008.

The old hospital was prominent in the news in January 2006 when rapist and armed robber Robert Cole, who was serving a 14-year sentence, lost and slipped through the bars of his &quot;A&quot; ward cell. Cole was recaptured three days later at Bondi Junction and was sentenced to an additional and cumulative 12 months for the escape.

It was again in the news from 2015, when David Dungay, an Aboriginal man, died aged 26 in the hospital. Dungay had diabetes and schizophrenia, and died after being held down by five officers who had asked him to stop eating biscuits, while being injected with a sedative by a prison nurse. A coronial inquest in November 2019 found that none of the officers should face disciplinary action, saying that their “conduct was limited by systemic efficiencies in training”, but the professional conduct of the nurse should be reviewed by the Nursing Board.

===Metropolitan Special Programs Centre (MSPC)===

Until recently called the &#x27;Malabar Special Programs Centre&#x27;, the MSPC is a maximum through to minimum security facility which houses many types of inmates. It is the second largest gaol in terms of inmate population in New South Wales. It holds remand inmates, medical transients (inmates undertaking medical treatment), inmates with short sentences and inmates undertaking therapeutic programs. The programs areas of the gaol comprises the Violent Offenders Therapeutic Program (VOTP), Developmentally Delayed Program, Lifestyles Unit (for HIV-positive inmates), which has been unused and empty since 2002, the Kevin Waller Unit for at-risk female inmates (currently used as an assessment unit for aged male inmates), Acute Crisis Management Unit (ACMU) for active suicidal and self-harmers, Multi Purpose Unit or Segregation (high risk inmates on segregation orders and inmates requiring non association for safety) and CUBIT (CUstody Based Intensive Therapy) sex offender program.

A large part of the maximum security area is a transit area where prisoners await a bed in their gaol of classification, or stay whilst obtaining medical treatment/surgery, or are held on remand whilst awaiting trial. 
&#x27;Metropolitan Medical Transit Centre/LBH2&#x27; was a maximum security facility used to hold inmates who had been discharged from Long Bay Hospital or were awaiting medical appointments. Since closure in January 2006 the MSPC now undertakes the role of housing inmates receiving medical treatment. The MMTC re-opened in 2009 but now holds general population remand and medical transit inmates.

===Special Purpose Centre (SPC)===
The Special Purpose Centre is a maximum security facility which holds inmates requiring special, or strict, protection. As of 2001, the SPC had the capacity to hold up to 65 inmates who are placed in this unit as selected by an Interdepartmental Committee that includes senior police and correctional personnel who authenticate the information supplied by the offenders to ensure that protection is warranted. Many of these offenders are informers who never return to mainstream prison population and are only ever referred to by a number (&quot;such as CP01, Commissioners Pleasure 01&quot;). Corrective Services NSW advises that there are, however, numerous examples of inmates who make the transition from the SPC to other centres. The identities of inmates housed in this location are not disclosed and staff working there must sign confidentiality agreements.

This Centre is often referred to as the &quot;bomb shelter&quot; or &quot;super grass&quot; by other inmates and houses police informants, inmates with bad debts and anyone else the commissioner of corrective services deems to be at risk and unable to be managed in standard protective custody.

==Notable prisoners==

The following individuals have served all or part of their sentence at the Long Bay Correctional Centre:

One of the killers of Dr Victor Chang, Chiew Seng Liew, a Malaysian citizen, was in Long Bay jail. He was released into the custody of waiting immigration officials and was deported to Malaysia.

==Cultural depictions==
Long Bay Gaol has featured in several books and music: 
* &quot; Hope Album 1993 A Pioneering Music Rehabilitation Programe&quot; Produced by Vincent Ruello Published through Warner Chappell Music
* &quot;Australia&#x27;s Hardest Prison: Inside the Walls of Long Bay Gaol&quot; (2014), a non-fiction work by James Phelps
* &quot;Long Bay&quot; (2015), a novel by Eleanor Limprecht telling the story of Rebecca Sinclair, who was sentenced to three years&#x27; Hard Labour for manslaughter after conducting an abortion, and was one of the gaol&#x27;s first inmates in 1909.
* &quot;Permission to Lie&quot; (2011), a collection of short stories by Julie Chevalier set in prisons in Australia and the United States of America. Seven of the stories are set in Long Bay Gaol.

== Heritage listing ==
As at 8 November 2000, the former State Penitentiary is of considerable significance. It was the first purpose-built Penitentiary in NSW and includes a rare example of back-to-back cells. In conjunction with the former Female Reformatory, it is an important development in Australian penal design and is the most complete expression of Frederick Neitenstein&#x27;s philosophy of reform. The siting of the Penitentiary has a strong visual impact in the surrounding landscape. The original buildings are of a unified scale and materials resulting in a harmonious appearance. The place has been used continuously as the principal prison complex in NSW and as Sydney&#x27;s major metropolitan gaol for over 80 years. It has research potential in penal practices and building technology of the time.

Long Bay Correctional Centre was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

<text>da Vinci is a lunar impact crater that is located in the eastern part of the Moon, to the northwest of Mare Fecunditatis. It lies along the eastern shore of the Sinus Concordiae, a bay along the eastern edge of Mare Tranquillitatis. Nearby craters include Watts to the southeast and Lawrence to the southwest, both smaller in dimension than da Vinci.

This formation has been heavily damaged and reshaped until it is scarcely recognizable as a crater. Sections of the low eastern rim and a portion to the northwest are still somewhat intact, although they more closely resemble curved ridges than a crater wall. There are gaps in the rim to the south and north, and the interior is irregular with portions having been resurfaced.

The terrain along the northern and western exterior of the crater is irregular and hilly. A low ridge to the southeast runs to the vicinity of Watts.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to da Vinci.
