<text>Information and communications technology (ICT) is an extensional term for information technology (IT) that stresses the role of unified communications and the integration of telecommunications (telephone lines and wireless signals) and computers, as well as necessary enterprise software, middleware, storage and audiovisual, that enable users to access, store, transmit, understand and manipulate information.

ICT is also used to refer to the convergence of audiovisuals and telephone networks with computer networks through a single cabling or link system. There are large economic incentives to merge the telephone networks with the computer network system using a single unified system of cabling, signal distribution, and management. ICT is an umbrella term that includes any communication device, encompassing radio, television, cell phones, computer and network hardware, satellite systems and so on, as well as the various services and appliances with them such as video conferencing and distance learning. ICT also includes analog technology, such as paper communication, and any mode that transmits communication.

ICT is a broad subject and the concepts are evolving. It covers any product that will store, retrieve, manipulate, process, transmit, or receive information electronically in a digital form (e.g., personal computers including smartphones, digital television, email, or robots). Skills Framework for the Information Age is one of many models for describing and managing competencies for ICT professionals in the 21st century.

==Etymology==
The phrase &quot;information and communication technologies&quot; has been used by academic researchers since the 1980s. The abbreviation &quot;ICT&quot; became popular after it was used in a report to the UK government by Dennis Stevenson in 1997, and then in the revised National Curriculum for England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2000. However, in 2012, the Royal Society recommended that the use of the term &quot;ICT&quot; should be discontinued in British schools &quot;as it has attracted too many negative connotations&quot;. From 2014, the National Curriculum has used the word &quot;computing,&quot; which reflects the addition of computer programming into the curriculum.

Variations of the phrase have spread worldwide. The United Nations has created a &quot;United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force&quot; and an internal &quot;Office of Information and Communications Technology&quot;.

==Monetization==
The money spent on IT worldwide has been estimated as US$3.8 trillion in 2017 and has been growing at less than 5% per year since 2009. The estimated 2018 growth of the entire ICT is 5%. The biggest growth of 16% is expected in the area of new technologies (IoT, Robotics, AR/VR, and AI).

The 2014 IT budget of the US federal government was nearly $82 billion. IT costs, as a percentage of corporate revenue, have grown 50% since 2002, putting a strain on IT budgets. When looking at current companies&#x27; IT budgets, 75% are recurrent costs, used to &quot;keep the lights on&quot; in the IT department, and 25% are the cost of new initiatives for technology development.

The average IT budget has the following breakdown:
* 34% personnel costs (internal), 31% after correction
* 16% software costs (external/purchasing category), 29% after correction
* 33% hardware costs (external/purchasing category), 26% after correction
* 17% costs of external service providers (external/services), 14% after correction

The estimated amount of money spent in 2022 is just over US$6 trillion.

== Technological capacity ==
The world&#x27;s technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 1986 to 15.8 in 1993, over 54.5 in 2000, and to 295 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007, and some 5 zettabytes in 2014. This is the informational equivalent to 1.25 stacks of CD-ROM from the earth to the moon in 2007, and the equivalent of 4,500 stacks of printed books from the earth to the sun in 2014. The world&#x27;s technological capacity to receive information through one-way broadcast networks was 432 exabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 715 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 1993, 1.2 (optimally compressed) zettabytes in 2000, and 1.9 zettabytes in 2007. The world&#x27;s effective capacity to exchange information through two-way telecommunication networks was 281 petabytes of (optimally compressed) information in 1986, 471 petabytes in 1993, 2.2 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2000, 65 (optimally compressed) exabytes in 2007, and some 100 exabytes in 2014. The world&#x27;s technological capacity to compute information with humanly guided general-purpose computers grew from 3.0 × 10^8 MIPS in 1986, to 6.4 x 10^12 MIPS in 2007.

==Sector in the OECD==
The following is a list of OECD countries by share of ICT sector in total value added in 2013.
==ICT Development Index==
The ICT Development Index ranks and compares the level of ICT use and access across the various countries around the world. In 2014 ITU (International Telecommunication Union) released the latest rankings of the IDI, with Denmark attaining the top spot, followed by South Korea. The top 30 countries in the rankings include most high-income countries where the quality of life is higher than average, which includes countries from Europe and other regions such as &quot;Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Japan, Macao (China), New Zealand, Singapore, and the United States; almost all countries surveyed improved their IDI ranking this year.&quot;

==The WSIS process and development goals==
On 21 December 2001, the United Nations General Assembly approved Resolution 56/183, endorsing the holding of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) to discuss the opportunities and challenges facing today&#x27;s information society. According to this resolution, the General Assembly related the Summit to the United Nations Millennium Declaration&#x27;s goal of implementing ICT to achieve Millennium Development Goals. It also emphasized a multi-stakeholder approach to achieve these goals, using all stakeholders including civil society and the private sector, in addition to governments.

To help anchor and expand ICT to every habitable part of the world, &quot;2015 is the deadline for achievements of the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which global leaders agreed upon in the year 2000.&quot;

==In education==
There is evidence that, to be effective in education, ICT must be fully integrated into the pedagogy. Specifically, when teaching literacy and math, using ICT in combination with Writing to Learn produces better results than traditional methods alone or ICT alone.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), a division of the United Nations, has made integrating ICT into education as part of its efforts to ensure equity and access to education. The following, which was taken directly from a UNESCO publication on educational ICT, explains the organization&#x27;s position on the initiative.Information and Communication Technology can contribute to universal access to education, equity in education, the delivery of quality learning and teaching, teachers&#x27; professional development and more efficient education management, governance, and administration. UNESCO takes a holistic and comprehensive approach to promote ICT in education. Access, inclusion, and quality are among the main challenges they can address. The Organization&#x27;s Intersectoral Platform for ICT in education focuses on these issues through the joint work of three of its sectors: Communication &amp; Information, Education and Science.

Despite the power of computers to enhance and reform teaching and learning practices, improper implementation is a widespread issue beyond the reach of increased funding and technological advances with little evidence that teachers and tutors are properly integrating ICT into everyday learning. Intrinsic barriers such as a belief in more traditional teaching practices and individual attitudes towards computers in education as well as the teachers own comfort with computers and their ability to use them all as result in varying effectiveness in the integration of ICT in the classroom.

=== Mobile learning for refugees ===
School environments play an important role in facilitating language learning. However, language and literacy barriers are obstacles preventing refugees from accessing and attending school, especially outside camp settings.

Mobile-assisted language learning apps are key tools for language learning. Mobile solutions can provide support for refugees&#x27; language and literacy challenges in three main areas: literacy development, foreign language learning and translations. Mobile technology is relevant because communicative practice is a key asset for refugees and immigrants as they immerse themselves in a new language and a new society. Well-designed mobile language learning activities connect refugees with mainstream cultures, helping them learn in authentic contexts.

=== Developing countries ===
==== Africa ====

ICT has been employed as an educational enhancement in Sub-Saharan Africa since the 1960s. Beginning with television and radio, it extended the reach of education from the classroom to the living room, and to geographical areas that had been beyond the reach of the traditional classroom. As the technology evolved and became more widely used, efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa were also expanded. In the 1990s a massive effort to push computer hardware and software into schools was undertaken, with the goal of familiarizing both students and teachers with computers in the classroom. Since then, multiple projects have endeavoured to continue the expansion of ICT&#x27;s reach in the region, including the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project, which by 2015 had distributed over 2.4 million laptops to nearly two million students and teachers.

The inclusion of ICT in the classroom, often referred to as M-Learning, has expanded the reach of educators and improved their ability to track student progress in Sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, the mobile phone has been most important in this effort. Mobile phone use is widespread, and mobile networks cover a wider area than internet networks in the region. The devices are familiar to student, teacher, and parent, and allow increased communication and access to educational materials. In addition to benefits for students, M-learning also offers the opportunity for better teacher training, which leads to a more consistent curriculum across the educational service area. In 2011, UNESCO started a yearly symposium called Mobile Learning Week with the purpose of gathering stakeholders to discuss the M-learning initiative.

Implementation is not without its challenges. While mobile phone and internet use are increasing much more rapidly in Sub-Saharan Africa than in other developing countries, the progress is still slow compared to the rest of the developed world, with smartphone penetration only expected to reach 20% by 2017. Additionally, there are gender, social, and geo-political barriers to educational access, and the severity of these barriers vary greatly by country. Overall, 29.6 million children in Sub-Saharan Africa were not in school in the year 2012, owing not just to the geographical divide, but also to political instability, the importance of social origins, social structure, and gender inequality. Once in school, students also face barriers to quality education, such as teacher competency, training and preparedness, access to educational materials, and lack of information management.

==== Growth in modern society and developing countries ====
In modern society, ICT is ever-present, with over three billion people having access to the Internet. With approximately 8 out of 10 Internet users owning a smartphone, information and data are increasing by leaps and bounds. This rapid growth, especially in developing countries, has led ICT to become a keystone of everyday life, in which life without some facet of technology renders most of clerical, work and routine tasks dysfunctional.

The most recent authoritative data, released in 2014, shows &quot;that Internet use continues to grow steadily, at 6.6% globally in 2014 (3.3% in developed countries, 8.7% in the developing world); the number of Internet users in developing countries has doubled in five years (2009–2014), with two-thirds of all people online now living in the developing world.&quot;

==== Limitations ====
However, hurdles are still large. &quot;Of the 4.3 billion people not yet using the Internet, 90% live in developing countries. In the world&#x27;s 42 Least Connected Countries (LCCs), which are home to 2.5 billion people, access to ICTs remains largely out of reach, particularly for these countries&#x27; large rural populations.&quot; ICT has yet to penetrate the remote areas of some countries, with many developing countries dearth of any type of Internet. This also includes the availability of telephone lines, particularly the availability of cellular coverage, and other forms of electronic transmission of data. The latest &quot;Measuring the Information Society Report&quot; cautiously stated that the increase in the aforementioned cellular data coverage is ostensible, as &quot;many users have multiple subscriptions, with global growth figures sometimes translating into little real improvement in the level of connectivity of those at the very bottom of the pyramid; an estimated 450 million people worldwide live in places which are still out of reach of mobile cellular service.&quot;

Favourably, the gap between the access to the Internet and mobile coverage has decreased substantially in the last fifteen years, in which &quot;2015 was the deadline for achievements of the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which global leaders agreed upon in the year 2000, and the new data show ICT progress and highlight remaining gaps.&quot; ICT continues to take on a new form, with nanotechnology set to usher in a new wave of ICT electronics and gadgets. ICT newest editions into the modern electronic world include smartwatches, such as the Apple Watch, smart wristbands such as the Nike+ FuelBand, and smart TVs such as Google TV. With desktops soon becoming part of a bygone era, and laptops becoming the preferred method of computing, ICT continues to insinuate and alter itself in the ever-changing globe.

Information communication technologies play a role in facilitating accelerated pluralism in new social movements today. The internet according to Bruce Bimber is &quot;accelerating the process of issue group formation and action&quot; and coined the term accelerated pluralism to explain this new phenomena. ICTs are tools for &quot;enabling social movement leaders and empowering dictators&quot; in effect promoting societal change. ICTs can be used to garner grassroots support for a cause due to the internet allowing for political discourse and direct interventions with state policy as well as change the way complaints from the populace are handled by governments. Furthermore, ICTs in a household are associated with women rejecting justifications for intimate partner violence. According to a study published in 2017, this is likely because &quot;access to ICTs exposes women to different ways of life and different notions about women&#x27;s role in society and the household, especially in culturally conservative regions where traditional gender expectations contrast observed alternatives.&quot;

==In health care==

* Telehealth
** A review found that in general, outcomes of such ICT-use – which were envisioned as early as 1925 – are or can be as good as in-person care with health care use staying similar.
* Artificial intelligence in healthcare
* Software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation
* mHealth
* Clinical decision support system and expert system
* Health administration and hospital information system
* Other health information technology and health informatics

==In science==
Applications of ICTs in science, research and development, and academia include:
* Internet research
* Online research methods
* Science communication and communication between scientists
* Scholarly databases
* Applied metascience

==Models of access==
Scholar Mark Warschauer defines a &quot;models of access&quot; framework for analyzing ICT accessibility. In the second chapter of his book, &quot;Technology and Social Inclusion: Rethinking the Digital Divide&quot;, he describes three models of access to ICTs: devices, conduits, and literacy. Devices and conduits are the most common descriptors for access to ICTs, but they are insufficient for meaningful access to ICTs without third model of access, literacy. Combined, these three models roughly incorporate all twelve of the criteria of &quot;Real Access&quot; to ICT use, conceptualized by a non-profit organization called Bridges.org in 2005:

# Physical access to technology
# Appropriateness of technology
# Affordability of technology and technology use
# Human capacity and training
# Locally relevant content, applications, and services
# Integration into daily routines
# Socio-cultural factors
# Trust in technology
# Local economic environment
# Macro-economic environment
# Legal and regulatory framework
# Political will and public support

=== Devices ===
The most straightforward model of access for ICT in Mark Warschauer&#x27;s theory is devices. In this model, access is defined most simply as the ownership of a device such as a phone or computer. Warschauer identifies many flaws with this model, including its inability to account for additional costs of ownership such as software, access to telecommunications, knowledge gaps surrounding computer use, and the role of government regulation in some countries. Therefore, Warschauer argues that considering only devices understates the magnitude of digital inequality. For example, the Pew Research Center notes that 96% of Americans own a smartphone, although most scholars in this field would contend that comprehensive access to ICT in the United States is likely much lower than that.

=== Conduits ===
A conduit requires a connection to a supply line, which for ICT could be a telephone line or Internet line. Accessing the supply requires investment in the proper infrastructure from a commercial company or local government and recurring payments from the user once the line is set up. For this reason, conduits usually divide people based on their geographic locations. As a Pew Research Center poll reports, Americans in rural areas are 12% less likely to have broadband access than other Americans, thereby making them less likely to own the devices. Additionally, these costs can be prohibitive to lower-income families accessing ICTs. These difficulties have led to a shift toward mobile technology; fewer people are purchasing broadband connection and are instead relying on their smartphones for Internet access, which can be found for free at public places such as libraries. Indeed, smartphones are on the rise, with 37% of Americans using smartphones as their primary medium for internet access and 96% of Americans owning a smartphone.

=== Literacy ===

In 1981, Sylvia Scribner and Michael Cole studied a tribe in Liberia, the Vai people, who have their own local script. Since about half of those literate in Vai have never had formal schooling, Scribner and Cole were able to test more than 1,000 subjects to measure the mental capabilities of literates over non-literates. This research, which they laid out in their book &quot;The Psychology of Literacy&quot;, allowed them to study whether the literacy divide exists at the individual level. Warschauer applied their literacy research to ICT literacy as part of his model of ICT access.

Scribner and Cole found no generalizable cognitive benefits from Vai literacy; instead, individual differences on cognitive tasks were due to other factors, like schooling or living environment. The results suggested that there is &quot;no single construct of literacy that divides people into two cognitive camps; [...] rather, there are gradations and types of literacies, with a range of benefits closely related to the specific functions of literacy practices.&quot; Furthermore, literacy and social development are intertwined, and the literacy divide does not exist on the individual level.

Warschauer draws on Scribner and Cole&#x27;s research to argue that ICT literacy functions similarly to literacy acquisition, as they both require resources rather than a narrow cognitive skill. Conclusions about literacy serve as the basis for a theory of the digital divide and ICT access, as detailed below:There is not just one type of ICT access, but many types. The meaning and value of access varies in particular social contexts. Access exists in gradations rather than in a bipolar opposition. Computer and Internet use brings no automatic benefit outside of its particular functions. ICT use is a social practice, involving access to physical artifacts, content, skills, and social support. And acquisition of ICT access is a matter not only of education but also of power.Therefore, Warschauer concludes that access to ICT cannot rest on devices or conduits alone; it must also engage physical, digital, human, and social resources. Each of these categories of resources have iterative relations with ICT use. If ICT is used well, it can promote these resources, but if it is used poorly, it can contribute to a cycle of underdevelopment and exclusion.

== Environmental impact ==
=== Progress during the century ===
In the early 21st century a rapid development of ICT services and electronical devices took place, in which the internet servers multiplied by a factor of 1000 to 395 million and its still increasing. This increase can be explained by Moore&#x27;s law, which states, that the development of ICT increases every year by 16–20%, so it will double in numbers every four to five years. Alongside this development and the high investments in increasing demand for ICT capable products, a high environmental impact came with it. Software and Hardware development as well as production causing already in 2008 the same amount of CO2 emissions as global air travels.

There are two sides of ICT, the positive environmental possibilities and the shadow side. On the positive side, studies proved, that for instance in the OECD countries a reduction of 0.235% energy use is caused by an increase in ICT capital by 1%. On the other side the more digitization is happening, the more energy is consumed, that means for OECD countries 1% increase in internet users causes a raise of 0.026% electricity consumption per capita and for emerging countries the impact is more than 4 times as high.

Currently the scientific forecasts are showing an increase up to 30700 TWh in 2030 which is 20 times more than it was in 2010.

=== Implication ===
To tackle the environmental issues of ICT, the EU commission plans proper monitoring and reporting of the GHG emissions of different ICT platforms, countries and infrastructure in general. Further the establishment of international norms for reporting and compliance are promoted to foster transparency in this sector.

Moreover it is suggested by scientists to make more ICT investments to exploit the potentials of ICT to alleviate CO2 emissions in general, and to implement a more effective coordination of ICT, energy and growth policies. Consequently, applying the principle of the coase theorem makes sense. It recommends to make investments there, where the marginal avoidance costs of emissions are the lowest, therefore in the developing countries with comparatively lower technological standards and policies as high-tech countries. With these measures, ICT can reduce environmental damage from economic growth and energy consumption by facilitating communication and infrastructure.

=== In problem-solving ===
ICTs could also be used to address environmental issues, including climate change, in various ways, including ways beyond education.

<doc id="1197969" wikidata="Q401047" url="?curid=1197969" title="Manganite">
<text>Manganite is a mineral composed of manganese oxide-hydroxide, MnO(OH), crystallizing in the monoclinic system (pseudo-orthorhombic). Crystals of manganite are prismatic and deeply striated parallel to their length; they are often grouped together in bundles. The color is dark steel-grey to iron-black, and the luster brilliant and submetallic. The streak is dark reddish brown. The hardness is 4, and the specific gravity is 4.3. There is a perfect cleavage parallel to the brachypinacoid, and less-perfect cleavage parallel to the prism faces. Twinned crystals are not infrequent.

The mineral contains 89.7% manganese sesquioxide; it dissolves in hydrochloric acid with evolution of chlorine.

==Occurrence==

Manganite occurs with other manganese oxides in deposits formed by circulating meteoric water in the weathering environment in clay deposits and laterites. It forms by low temperature hydrothermal action in veins in association with calcite, barite, and siderite. Often associated with pyrolusite, braunite, hausmannite and goethite.

Manganite occurs in specimens exhibiting good crystal form at Ilfeld in the Harz Mountains of Germany, where the mineral occurs with calcite and barite in veins traversing porphyry. Crystals have also been found at Ilmenau in Thuringia, Neukirch near Sélestat in Alsace (newkirkite), Granam near Towie in Aberdeenshire, and in Upton Pyne near Exeter, UK and Negaunee, Michigan, United States, and in the Pilbara of Western Australia. Good crystals have also been found at Atikokan, Ontario and Nova Scotia, Canada. As an ore of manganese it is much less abundant than pyrolusite or psilomelane.

Although described with various other names as early as 1772, the name &quot;manganite&quot; was first applied in a publication by W. Haidinger in 1827.
==Applications==
The mineral was used in prehistoric times as a pigment, by humans, and as a fire starter by Neanderthalers. Manganite is believed to have been used in prehistoric times to start a wood fire. Manganite lowers the combustion temperature of wood from 350 degrees Celsius to 250 degrees Celsius. Manganite powder has been a common find in Neanderthal archaeological sites.

<doc id="1197979" wikidata="Q6646340" url="?curid=1197979" title="Listen Here! (sampler album)">
<text>Listen Here! is a sampler album released by Transatlantic Records in 1968. It was the second significant UK contemporary music sampler release in the period.

Transatlantic, founded in 1961, was a prototype for many of the UK independent labels that followed it. It established the UK folk-rock market, first by importing American records, and then by recording British artists. With the advent of psychedelia and flower power, the Transatlantic stable of artists achieved increasing popularity, culminating in the formation of the supergroup Pentangle. Meanwhile, Transatlantic had been extending its eclecticism, recording such as the eccentric audio collageist Ron Geesin, and The Purple Gang, whose &quot;Granny Takes A Trip&quot; was banned by the BBC in 1967. 

CBS had released the extremely successful contemporary music budget sampler with &quot;The Rock Machine Turns You On&quot; in 1967. Before CBS could follow up, Transatlantic released &quot;Listen Here!&quot; early in 1968. Like &quot;Rock Machine&quot; the record was priced at 14/11d (£0.75), but Transatlantic took promotion one stage further by not only printing the track listing on the front, but also the price. The record was designed to preview not only the forthcoming Pentangle double album, but solo records by members Bert Jansch and John Renbourn. &quot;Listen Here!&quot; also served to introduce a new group The Sallyangie, with siblings Mike and Sally Oldfield.

<doc id="1197980" wikidata="Q224527" url="?curid=1197980" title="Downregulation and upregulation">
<text>In biochemistry, in the biological context of organisms&#x27; regulation of gene expression and production of gene products, downregulation is the process by which a cell decreases the production and quantities of its cellular components, such as RNA and proteins, in response to an external stimulus. The complementary process that involves increase in quantities of cellular components is called upregulation.

An example of downregulation is the cellular decrease in the expression of a specific receptor in response to its increased activation by a molecule, such as a hormone or neurotransmitter, which reduces the cell&#x27;s sensitivity to the molecule. This is an example of a locally acting (negative feedback) mechanism.

An example of upregulation is the response of liver cells exposed to such xenobiotic molecules as dioxin. In this situation, the cells increase their production of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which in turn increases degradation of these dioxin molecules.

Downregulation or upregulation of an RNA or protein may also arise by an epigenetic alteration. Such an epigenetic alteration can cause expression of the RNA or protein to no longer respond to an external stimulus. This occurs, for instance, during drug addiction or progression to cancer.

==Downregulation and upregulation of receptors==

All living cells have the ability to receive and process signals that originate outside their membranes, which they do by means of proteins called receptors, often located at the cell&#x27;s surface imbedded in the plasma membrane. When such signals interact with a receptor, they effectively direct the cell to do something, such as dividing, dying, or allowing substances to be created, or to enter or exit the cell. A cell&#x27;s ability to respond to a chemical message depends on the presence of receptors tuned to that message. The more receptors a cell has that are tuned to the message, the more the cell will respond to it.

Receptors are created, or expressed, from instructions in the DNA of the cell, and they can be increased, or upregulated, when the signal is weak, or decreased, or downregulated, when it is strong. Their level can also be up or down regulated by modulation of systems that degrade receptors when they are no longer required by the cell. 

Downregulation of receptors can also occur when receptors have been chronically exposed to an excessive amount of a ligand, either from endogenous mediators or from exogenous drugs. This results in ligand-induced desensitization or internalization of that receptor. This is typically seen in animal hormone receptors. Upregulation of receptors, on the other hand, can result in super-sensitized cells, especially after repeated exposure to an antagonistic drug or prolonged absence of the ligand.

Some receptor agonists may cause downregulation of their respective receptors, while most receptor antagonists temporarily upregulate their respective receptors. The disequilibrium caused by these changes often causes withdrawal when the long-term use of a drug is discontinued.

Upregulation and downregulation can also happen as a response to toxins or hormones. An example of upregulation in pregnancy is hormones that cause cells in the uterus to become more sensitive to oxytocin.

== Example: Insulin receptor downregulation ==
Elevated levels of the hormone insulin in the blood trigger downregulation of the associated receptors. When insulin binds to its receptors on the surface of a cell, the hormone receptor complex undergoes endocytosis and is subsequently attacked by intracellular lysosomal enzymes. The internalization of the insulin molecules provides a pathway for degradation of the hormone, as well as for regulation of the number of sites that are available for binding on the cell surface. At high plasma concentrations, the number of surface receptors for insulin is gradually reduced by the accelerated rate of receptor internalization and degradation brought about by increased hormonal binding. The rate of synthesis of new receptors within the endoplasmic reticulum and their insertion in the plasma membrane do not keep pace with their rate of destruction. Over time, this self-induced loss of target cell receptors for insulin reduces the target cell&#x27;s sensitivity to the elevated hormone concentration.

This process is illustrated by the insulin receptor sites on target cells, e.g. liver cells, in a person with type 2 diabetes. Due to the elevated levels of blood glucose in an individual, the β-cells (islets of Langerhans) in the pancreas must release more insulin than normal to meet the demand and return the blood to homeostatic levels. The near-constant increase in blood insulin levels results from an effort to match the increase in blood glucose, which will cause receptor sites on the liver cells to downregulate and decrease the number of receptors for insulin, increasing the subject&#x27;s resistance by decreasing sensitivity to this hormone. There is also a hepatic decrease in sensitivity to insulin. This can be seen in the continuing gluconeogenesis in the liver even when blood glucose levels are elevated. This is the more common process of insulin resistance, which leads to adult-onset diabetes.

Another example can be seen in diabetes insipidus, in which the kidneys become insensitive to arginine vasopressin.

==Drug addiction==
Family-based, adoption, and twin studies have indicated that there is a strong (50%) heritable component to vulnerability to substance abuse addiction.

Especially among genetically vulnerable individuals, repeated exposure to a drug of abuse in adolescence or adulthood causes addiction by inducing stable downregulation or upregulation in expression of specific genes and microRNAs through epigenetic alterations. Such downregulation or upregulation has been shown to occur in the brain&#x27;s reward regions, such as the nucleus accumbens.

==Cancer==

DNA damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer. DNA damage can also increase epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair. Such mutations and epigenetic alterations can give rise to cancer (see malignant neoplasms). Investigation of epigenetic down- or upregulation of repaired DNA genes as possibly central to progression of cancer has been regularly undertaken since 2000.

Epigenetic downregulation of the DNA repair gene &quot;MGMT&quot; occurs in 93% of bladder cancers, 88% of stomach cancers, 74% of thyroid cancers, 40–90% of colorectal cancers, and 50% of brain cancers. Similarly, epigenetic downregulation of &quot;LIG4&quot; occurs in 82% of colorectal cancers and epigenetic downregulation of &quot;NEIL1&quot; occurs in 62% of head and neck cancers and in 42% of non-small-cell lung cancers.

Epigenetic upregulation of the DNA repair genes &quot;PARP1&quot; and &quot;FEN1&quot; occurs in numerous cancers (see Regulation of transcription in cancer). &quot;PARP1&quot; and &quot;FEN1&quot; are essential genes in the error-prone and mutagenic DNA repair pathway microhomology-mediated end joining. If this pathway is upregulated, the excess mutations it causes can lead to cancer. PARP1 is over-expressed in tyrosine kinase-activated leukemias, in neuroblastoma, in testicular and other germ cell tumors, and in Ewing&#x27;s sarcoma. FEN1 is upregulated in the majority of cancers of the breast, prostate, stomach, neuroblastomas, pancreas, and lung.

<text>PHP-GTK is a set of language bindings for the programming language PHP which allow GTK graphical user interface (GUI) applications to be written in PHP. PHP-GTK provides an object-oriented programming interface to GTK classes and functions. PHP-GTK partly supports GTK2, but GTK3 is unsupported.

== History==
PHP-GTK was originally conceived by Andrei Zmievski, who is also actively involved in the development of PHP and the Zend Engine. The idea was received well by the PHP community, and more people started to get involved with the project. James Moore and Steph Fox were among the first to join in, contributing a great deal to PHP-GTK through their documentation efforts, and Frank Kromann, also from the PHP development team, supplied Windows binaries for the project.

The first version of PHP-GTK was released in March 2001. More people began to get involved, and several extensions were contributed introducing new GUI widgets, such as Scintilla and GtkHTML. PHP-GTK 1.0 was released in October 2003 alongside several extensions, including a wrapper for libglade, which allowed the cross-platform Glade Interface Designer UI builder to be used in creating PHP-GTK applications.

Zmievski and Fox continued to work on the project, with Fox maintaining PHP-GTK for Windows.

In 2008 PHP-GTK 2.0.0 was released to fully use PHP 5.2&#x27;s powerful object model support, and to bring the improved portability of GTK 2.6, and its new set of widgets. The project also has support for GtkSourceView, which provides a source code editor widget. Around half the classes have been fully documented. Scott Mattocks, a member of the PHP-GTK documentation group, has also written a book on the subject of PHP-GTK programming.

In 2015 PHP-GTK 2.0.1 was released to be compatible with PHP 5.5 and GTK 2.24.

The project is compatible with only GTK 2, not version 3.

WxPHP (WxWidgets for PHP) exists as an alternative to develop GTK PHP applications.

== Example ==
&lt;?php

function pressed()
 echo &quot;Hello again - The button was pressed!\n&quot;;

$window = new GtkWindow();
$button = new GtkButton(&#x27;Click&#x27;);
$button1 = new GtkButton(&#x27;Click&#x27;);

$window-&gt;set_title(&#x27;Hello World!&#x27;);
$window-&gt;connect_simple(&#x27;destroy&#x27;, array(&#x27;Gtk&#x27;, &#x27;main_quit&#x27;));
$button-&gt;connect_simple(&#x27;clicked&#x27;, &#x27;pressed&#x27;);
$button1-&gt;connect_simple(&#x27;clicked&#x27;, &#x27;pressed&#x27;);
$window-&gt;add($button);
$window-&gt;show_all();

Gtk::main();
The sample PHP-GTK 2 program instantiates a codice_1 widget with the title &quot;Hello World!&quot;, containing a codice_2 labelled &quot;Click Me.&quot; When the button is pressed, the message &quot;Hello again - The button was pressed!&quot; is displayed on the console via the callback codice_3.

== Deployment ==

Several tools have sprung up that assist the simple deployment of PHP-GTK applications. PHP compilers such as PriadoBlender and Roadsend PHP (Currently only compatible with PHP-GTK 1, while latest snapshot includes PHP-GTK 2) enable compiling applications written in PHP-GTK to a standalone binary executable. Alan Knowles&#x27; PHP Extension and Application Repository (PEAR) package, bcompiler, also allows compiling PHP into bytecode to hide the source code.

<text>The Chinese Wikipedia () is the written vernacular Chinese edition of Wikipedia. It was created on 11 May 2001. It is one of multiple projects supported by the Wikimedia Foundation. 

The Chinese Wikipedia currently has articles, registered users, and active editors, of whom have administrative privileges.

The Chinese Wikipedia has been blocked in mainland China since May 2015. Nonetheless, the Chinese Wikipedia is still one of the top ten most active versions of Wikipedia by number of edits and number of editors, due to contributions from users from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Chinese diaspora. 

Taiwan and Hong Kong contribute most of the page views to the Chinese Wikipedia.

== History ==

The Chinese Wikipedia was established, along with 12 other Wikipedias, in May 2001. At this time, the Chinese Wikipedia did not support Chinese characters, and had no encyclopedic content.

In October 2002, the first Chinese-language page, the main page, was written. A software update on 27 October 2002 allowed Chinese language input. The domain was set to be &quot;zh.wikipedia.org&quot;, with &quot;zh&quot; based on the ISO 639-1 code for the Chinese language. On 17 November 2002, the user Mountain translated the Computer science article into &quot;&quot;, thus creating its first encyclopedic article.

To accommodate the orthographic differences between simplified Chinese characters and traditional Chinese characters, from 2002 to 2003, the Chinese Wikipedia community gradually decided to combine the two originally separate versions of the Chinese Wikipedia. The first running automatic conversion between the two orthographic representations started on 23 December 2004, with the MediaWiki 1.4 release. The needs from Hong Kong and Singapore were taken into account in the MediaWiki 1.4.2 release, which made the conversion table for zh-sg default to zh-cn, and zh-hk default to zh-tw.

Initially, most articles on the Chinese Wikipedia were translated from the English version. The first five administrators were promoted on 14 June 2003.

Wikipedia was first introduced by mainland Chinese media in the newspaper &quot;China Computer Education&quot; on 20 October 2003, in the article &quot;I join to write an encyclopedia&quot; (). On 16 May 2004, Wikipedia was first reported by Taiwanese media in the newspaper &quot;China Times&quot;. Since then, many newspapers have published articles about the Chinese Wikipedia, and several sysops have been interviewed by journalists.

Ivan Zhai of the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; wrote that the blocks from the mainland authorities in the 2000s stifled the growth of the Chinese Wikipedia, and that by 2013 there was a new generation of users originating from mainland China who were taking efforts to make the Chinese Wikipedia grow. In 2024, there were 3.6 million registered users on the Chinese Wikipedia, and in July 2013, 7,500 of these users were active, with most of them originating from Hong Kong and Taiwan.

== Naming ==

The Chinese name of Wikipedia was decided on 21 October 2003, following a vote. The name () means &quot;Wiki Encyclopedia&quot;. The Chinese transcription of &quot;Wiki&quot; is composed of two characters: , whose ancient sense refers to &quot;ropes or webs connecting objects&quot;, and which alludes to the Internet; and , meaning the &quot;foundations of a building&quot;, or &quot;fundamental aspects of things in general&quot;. The name can be interpreted as &quot;the encyclopedia that connects the fundamental knowledge of humanity&quot;.

The most common Chinese translation for wiki technology is ; however, it can be or , which are also transcriptions of the word &quot;wiki&quot;. As a result, the term has become associated exclusively with Wikimedia projects.

The Chinese Wikipedia also has a sub header: , which means, &quot;The sea embraces all rivers, and its capacity makes it great.&quot; The sub header originated from the first half of a couplet composed by the Qing Dynasty official Lin Zexu.

== Community ==

According to Wikimedia Statistics, in January 2021, the majority of viewers and editors on the Chinese Wikipedia were from Taiwan and Hong Kong. Numerous viewers and users are from Macau, Singapore, Malaysia, United States and other countries with a high Chinese diaspora; but there are some viewers from China as well.

According to a survey conducted between April 2010 and March 2011, edits to the Chinese Wikipedia were 37.8% from Taiwan, 26.2% from Hong Kong, 17.7% from mainland China, 6.1% from United States, and 2.3% from Canada.

In April 2016, the project had 2,127 active editors who made at least five edits in that month.

The most discussed and debated topics on the Chinese Wikipedia are political issues in modern Chinese history. For example, the six most edited articles as of August 2007 were Taiwan, Chinese culture, China itself, Mao Zedong, Chiang Kai-shek, and Hong Kong, in that order. In contrast, issues such as the Israeli–Palestinian conflict are much less contentious.

Due to the audience base, Wikipedians from China, Taiwan, and other regions had engaged in editing conflicts over political topics related to Cross-Straits relations. Due to the censorship in mainland China, Chinese Wikipedia&#x27;s audience comes primarily from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore and the diasporas in Malaysia, the United States, Canada, Australia, South Korea (including Koreans from China), totaling approximately 60 million people. Chinese Wikipedia has more than 9,100 active editors as of July 2021, and this number is increasing.

Approximately half of Chinese Wikipedia&#x27;s 610 million pageviews monthly come from Taiwan, with approximately 20% coming from Hong Kong, 8% from United States, 4% from Malaysia and the rest from Singapore, Macau, mainland China and the Chinese diaspora. In 2021, the monthly pageviews of Chinese Wikipedia underwent a spike in growth from around 380 million to 620 million pageviews in six months.

=== Administrators ===
As of June 2019, there are 78 administrators, or sysops. They are all elected by Chinese Wikipedians. Most of them come from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. There are also a few who come from the United States, Singapore, and Japan.

=== Meetings ===
The first Chinese Wikipedian meeting was held in Beijing on 25 July 2004. Since then, Chinese Wikipedians from different regions have held many gatherings in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Shenyang, Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Currently, a regular meetup is held once every two weeks in Shanghai, Taipei and Hong Kong, and once every month in Tainan City, Taiwan. In July 2006, Taiwanese Wikipedians also held a &quot;travelling meetup&quot;, travelling by train through four Taiwanese cities over a period of two days. In August 2006, Hong Kong hosted the first annual .

Chinese Wikipedians advertise Wikipedia in different ways. Many of them use Weibo, a Chinese socializing website similar to Twitter. Several Chinese Wikipedians created the Wikipedia monthly magazine, or journal, called &quot;The Wikipedians&quot; in December 2012, which is currently published once a month.

=== State persecution of volunteers ===
Chinese Wikipedia volunteers who edit on topics considered controversial by state authorities, such as the Hong Kong protests, can face harassment and persecution.

== Character conversion system ==

Initially, there were virtually two Chinese Wikipedias under the names of &quot;zh&quot; (or &quot;zh-cn&quot;) and &quot;zh-tw&quot;. Generally, users from regions that used Traditional Chinese characters (such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau) wrote and edited articles using Traditional Chinese characters whereas those from regions that used Simplified Chinese characters (such as mainland China, Singapore, and Malaysia) wrote using Simplified Chinese characters. Many articles had two uncoordinated versions; for example, there was a Traditional Chinese article on France located at , but also a Simplified Chinese article, located at article on France. Further exacerbating the problem were differences in vocabulary (particularly nouns) and writing systems, between mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. For example, a pineapple is called in mainland China, {{lang|zh-Hant|菠蘿]], in Hong Kong and Macau, {{lang|zh-sg|黄梨}} in Singapore and Malaysia, and {{lang|zh-tw|鳳梨}} in Taiwan.

To deal with this untenable near-forking of the project, starting around January 2005 the Chinese Wikipedia began providing a server-side mechanism to automatically convert different characters and vocabulary items into the user&#x27;s local ones, according to the user&#x27;s preference settings. These are two configurations which allow either for conversion of script only, or one of six settings which also take into account regional vocabulary differences:{{efn|}}

The user can also choose to read each article in whichever script it is stored in, without conversion.

Conversion is done through a set of character conversion tables{{where|date=May 2020}} that may be edited by administrators. To provide an alternative means to convert characters correctly when automatic conversion fails, a special template was created to allow manually converting characters and article titles on a given page.

Furthermore, page title conversion is used for automatic page redirection. Articles previously named in different characters or different translations have been merged, and can be reached by both Traditional and Simplified Chinese titles.

== Wikipedia in other varieties of Chinese ==
The Chinese Wikipedia is based on written vernacular Chinese, the official Chinese written language in all Chinese-speaking regions, including mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore. This register is largely associated with the grammar and vocabulary of Standard Chinese, the official spoken language of mainland China, Taiwan, and Singapore (but not exclusively of Hong Kong and Macau, which largely use Cantonese). Readers from Taiwan and Hong Kong contribute most of the page views of the Chinese Wikipedia.

The varieties of Chinese are a diverse group encompassing many regional topolects, most of which are mutually unintelligible and often divided up into several larger dialect groups, such as Wu (including Shanghainese and Suzhounese), Min Nan (of which Taiwanese is a notable dialect), and Cantonese. In regions that speak non-Mandarin languages or regional Mandarin dialects, the Vernacular Chinese standard largely corresponding to Standard Chinese is nevertheless used exclusively as the Chinese written standard; this written standard differs sharply from the local dialects in vocabulary and grammar, and is often read in local pronunciation but preserving the vocabulary and grammar of Standard Chinese. After the founding of the Chinese Wikipedia, many users of non-Mandarin Chinese varieties began to request Wikipedia editions in non-Mandarin varieties. However, they were met with significant opposition, based on the fact that Mandarin-based Vernacular Chinese is the only form used in scholarly or academic contexts. Some also proposed the implementation of an automatic conversion program similar to that between Simplified and Traditional Chinese; however, others noted that although conversion between Simplified and Traditional Chinese consists mainly of glyph and sometimes vocabulary substitutions, different regional varieties of Chinese differ so sharply in grammar, syntax, and semantics that it would have been unrealistic to implement an automatic conversion program.

Objections notwithstanding, it was determined that the following Chinese varieties were sufficiently different from Standard Chinese and had a sufficiently large number of followers to justify the creation of six Wikipedias for different varieties:

Finally, requests were also made, and granted, to create a Classical Chinese Wikipedia (zh-classical), based on Classical Chinese, an archaic register of Chinese with grammar and vocabulary drawn from classical works and used in all official contexts until the early 20th century, when it was displaced by the Vernacular Chinese standard.

All of the above Wikipedias have sidestepped the Traditional/Simplified Chinese issue. The Wu Wikipedia uses Simplified Chinese exclusively, and the Classical Chinese Wikipedia uses Traditional Chinese exclusively. The Gan and Cantonese Wikipedias default to Traditional, but have a conversion function similar to the Chinese Wikipedia. The Min Nan Wikipedia uses Pe̍h-ōe-jī. The Mindong Wikipedia and Hakka Wikipedias currently use Bàng-uâ-cê and Pha̍k-fa-sṳ respectively, which can be converted to Traditional Chinese characters, thus avoiding the issue completely.

The Eastern Min Wikipedia (Bàng-uâ-cê: Bànguâpedia) is the Mindong Chinese edition of Wikipedia, run by the Wikimedia Foundation. The project was started on 30 September 2006.{{Failed verification|date=January 2025}} The writing system used in Mindong Wikipedia is Foochow Romanized, a romanized orthography based on the standard Fuzhou dialect that was introduced by Western missionaries in the 19th century, and Chinese characters although most articles are in Foochow.

The Eastern Min Wikipedia was originally written using only Bàng-uâ-cê. On 23 June 2013, influenced by the usage of Chinese characters on the Hakka Wikipedia, Eastern Min Wikipedia began to set up a Chinese character homepage, and since then, many Chinese articles have been created. This project is also the second project in the Chinese Wikipedia to use both the Latin alphabet and the Chinese character writing system.

As of the end of November 2014, there were a total of 1,496 articles on the Eastern Min Wikipedia, with one administrator and one active editor (one who registered and edited more than five times a month). It ranked 202nd among all Wikipedia languages in terms of number of entries.

The Hakka Wikipedia (Pha̍k-fa-sṳ: Hak-kâ-ngî Wikipedia) is the Hakka Language version of Wikipedia. As of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}, it contains {{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|hak|N}} articles and has {{NUMBEROF|USERS|hak|N}} registered users, including {{NUMBEROF|ACTIVEUSERS|hak|N}} active contributors and {{NUMBEROF|ADMINS|hak}} administrator.
The Hakka Wikipedia was originally written only in Pha̍k-fa-sṳ. For users who are not familiar with vernacular characters, a Hakka dictionary and a simple comparison table are provided on the homepage. The vernacular part is mainly based on the Sixian dialect of Taiwanese Hakka (i.e. the Roman pinyin of Taiwan Hakka). There are also many entries written in the vernacular of mainland Hakka, and even written in Hagfa Pinyim.

On 10 March 2015, the Hakka edition had 4,512 articles and 13,485 registered users, making it the 155th language edition of Wikipedia by number of articles and the 161st by number of registered users, among the 287 active language editions.

== Censorship by the People&#x27;s Republic of China ==
{{See also|Great Firewall#Circumvention}}

The People&#x27;s Republic of China and internet service providers in mainland China have adopted a practice of blocking contentious Internet sites in mainland China, and Wikimedia sites have been blocked at least three times in its history.

On 19 May 2015, Chinese Wikipedia was blocked again within mainland China. Because all Wikipedias rely on HTTPS links, Chinese censors cannot see what page an individual is viewing; this also makes it more difficult to block a specific set of pages.

=== First block ===
The first block lasted from 2 to 21 June 2004. It began when access to the Chinese Wikipedia from Beijing was blocked on the 15th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.

Possibly related to this, on 31 May an article from the IDG News Service was published, discussing the Chinese Wikipedia&#x27;s treatment of the protests. The Chinese Wikipedia also has articles related to Taiwan independence, written by contributors from Taiwan and elsewhere. A few days after the initial block of the Chinese Wikipedia, all Wikimedia Foundation sites were blocked in mainland China. In response to the blocks, two moderators prepared an appeal to lift the block and asked their regional internet service provider to submit it. All Wikimedia sites were unblocked between 17 and 21 June 2004. One month later, the first Chinese Wikipedian moderators&#x27; meeting was held in Beijing on 25 July 2004.

The first block had an effect on the vitality of the Chinese Wikipedia, which suffered sharp dips in various indicators, such as the number of new users, the number of new articles, and the number of edits. In some cases, it took anywhere from 6 to 12 months to regain the stats from May 2004. On the other hand, on today&#x27;s site, some of the articles are put under protection which may last for a month or more without any actions.

=== Second block ===
The second and less serious outage lasted between 23 and 27 September 2004. During this four-day period, access to Wikipedia was erratic or unavailable to some users in mainland China – this block was not comprehensive and some users in mainland China were never affected. The exact reason for the block is unknown. Chinese Wikipedians once again prepared a written appeal to regional ISPs, but the block was lifted before the appeal was actually sent, for an unknown reason.

=== Third block and temporary unblocks ===
The third block began on 19 October 2005, and there was no indication as to whether this block was temporary or permanent, or what the reasons or causes for this block were. According to the status page currently maintained on the Chinese Wikipedia, the Florida and Korea servers were blocked, whereas the Paris and Amsterdam servers were not. Dozens of editors from across mainland China reported that they could only access Wikipedia using proxy servers, although there were isolated reports that some users could access Wikipedia without using a proxy. Most Chinese people were not able to connect to the site at all.

During October and November 2006, it first appeared that the site was unblocked again. Many conflicting reports came from news outlets, bloggers, and Wikipedians, reporting a possible partial or full unblocking of Wikipedia. Some reports indicated a complete unblock; others suggested that some sensitive topics remained blocked, and yet others suggested that the Chinese Wikipedia was blocked whereas other-language versions were not. From 17 November onwards, the complete block was once again in place.

On 15 June 2007, China lifted the block for several articles, only to then block an increasing number of articles. On 30 August 2007, all blocks were lifted, but then a block was placed on Wikipedia for all languages on 31 August 2007. As of 26 January 2008, all languages of Wikipedia were blocked, and as of 2 April 2008, the block was lifted.

By 5 April 2008, the Chinese Wikipedia became difficult to access from the Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou. Connections to the Chinese Wikipedia were completely blocked as of 6 April 2008. Any attempt to access the Chinese Wikipedia resulted in a 60-second ban on all Wikimedia websites. However, users were able to log on to the Chinese Wikipedia using https. All other languages were accessible, but politically sensitive searches such as Tibet were still blocked.

On 3 July 2008, the government lifted the ban on accessing the Chinese Wikipedia. However, some portions of the site were still inaccessible. On 31 July 2008, BBC reported that the Chinese Wikipedia had been unblocked that day in China; it had still been blocked the previous day. This came within the context of foreign journalists arriving in Beijing to report on the upcoming Olympic Games, and websites like the Chinese edition of the BBC were being unblocked following talks between the International Olympic Committee and the Games&#x27; Chinese organizers.

=== Fourth block ===
On 19 May 2015, both the encrypted and unencrypted Chinese-language versions of Wikipedia were blocked.

=== Fifth block ===
On 23 April 2019, all versions of Wikipedia were blocked in China.

== Controversy and criticism ==
{{Over-quotation|section|date=June 2017}}

===2006 allegations of self-censorship===
In December 2006, the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; Asia-Pacific published an article saying that sensitive topics received subdued treatment on the Chinese Wikipedia.

{{blockquote|But on sensitive questions of China&#x27;s modern history or on hot-button issues, the Chinese version diverges so dramatically from its English counterpart that it sometimes reads as if it were approved by the censors themselves.
For some, the Chinese version of Wikipedia was intended as just such a resource, but its tame approach to sensitive topics has sparked a fierce debate in the world of online mavens over its objectivity and thoroughness.
On the evidence of entries like this, for the moment, the fight over editorial direction of Wikipedia in Chinese is being won by enthusiasts who practice self-censorship.}}

On 1 December 2006, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published another report by Howard W. French, titled &quot;Wikipedia lays bare two versions of China&#x27;s past.&quot;

{{blockquote|Some say the object should be to spread reliable information as widely as possible, and that, in any case, self-censorship is pointless because the government still frequently blocks access to Wikipedia for most Chinese Internet users. &#x27;There is a lot of confusion about whether they should obey the neutral point of view or offer some compromises to the government,&#x27; said Isaac Mao, a well-known Chinese blogger and user of the encyclopedia. &#x27;To the local Wikipedians, the first objective is to make it well known among Chinese, to get people to understand the principles of Wikipedia step by step, and not to get the thing blocked by the government.}}

The report was subsequently repeated by CBS and by Chinese-language media outlets such as the &quot;Apple Daily&quot; in Taiwan.

Some Chinese Wikipedians then tried to clarify the situation. One Chinese Wikipedian sent a comment that was subsequently published in the &quot;Apple Daily&quot; in Taiwan. The comment stated:

{{blockquote|... control over our content does not stem from any political motive, and we try to the extent of our abilities (even if we cannot do it perfectly) to prevent the influence of ideology; the motive, goal, and standards of control are very clear: to create an encyclopedia with rich content, good quality, and open copyright. All of our editing and deletion policies stem from this. There is no doubt about this point, and this will not change under any political pressure or personal beliefs.

Regarding the description of Mao Zedong on the Chinese Wikipedia, one can simply go online and see for oneself; in order to understand the operation of Wikipedia or to edit it oneself, just a few more mouse clicks would suffice. As Wikipedia continues to attract awareness, the number of users is increasing, and the media has increased interest in Wikipedia as well. Unfortunately, even a reputable international media source such as the &quot;New York Times&quot; was unable to find out the actual situation before passing biased judgment on Wikipedia. We can also see here that in quoting media overseas, even a notable one, one must still be cautious and check once again for oneself. (&quot;Translated&quot;)|author=|title=|source=}}

In another email addressed to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing list, a Chinese Wikipedian stated:

{{blockquote|
# Chinese Wikipedia has and conforms to a high standard of neutral point of view, and Chinese Wikipedians take this policy seriously.
# There is no such thing called &quot;self-censorship&quot; at Chinese Wikipedia; indeed any intention for such practice at Chinese Wikipedia will be denounced by most Chinese Wikipedians.
# Chinese Wikipedia is written by people from various places of the world, including Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Asia, America, Europe, etc. Indeed, editors from Mainland China are disproportionately scarce because of the current block obviously imposed by the PRC government (though it never admitted that).}}

Previous proposals to self-censor the Chinese Wikipedia in light of the P. R. Chinese government&#x27;s censorship policies have been made before, but were overwhelmingly rejected by the community.

=== 2010 administrator controversy ===
{{Undue weight|date=February 2025 |to=the Ming Pao article and their interview with Shizhao}}
In April 2010, Hong Kong newspaper &quot;Ming Pao&quot; reported the large-scale censorship of contents about 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre and Hong Kong-related contents in which an administrator named &quot;Shizhao&quot; (&quot;百無一用是書生&quot; a.k.a. &quot;時昭&quot;) was involved. The report also mentioned the failed recall of the administrator.

In a follow-up, &quot;Ming Pao&quot; interviewed Shizhao and stated that he was not a member of the 50 Cent Party. He added that for controversial topics such as the 1989 protests, he would be a little more cautious. In the interview, he denied that he had attempted to delete an article about the Concert for Democracy in China (民主歌聲獻中華), and stated that he merely questioned the notability of the concert by adding a template to the article.

However, he had started a discussion to delete an article about a song criticizing the Hong Kong government ({{zh|c=福佳始終有你|p=Fú jiā shǐzhōng yǒu nǐ}}) in 2007, enraging many Hong Kong netizens. Shizhao added that, at the time, he had already edited more than 50,000 times, deleting several articles including &quot;Manual for Librarians&quot;. He joked about the incident, saying, &quot;some may consider that is a kind of hate to libraries and hence is not suitable for monitoring Wikipedia.&quot;

=== Chinese government interference ===
Chinese officials and scholars have accused the Chinese Wikipedia of having an anti-Chinese government bias. Chinese academics Li-hao Gan and Bin-Ting Weng published a paper titled &quot;Opportunities And Challenges Of China&#x27;s Foreign Communication in the Wikipedia&quot;, in which they argue that &quot;due to the influence by foreign media, Wikipedia entries have a large number of prejudiced words against the Chinese government&quot;. Jie Ding, an official from the China International Publishing Group, also published an article stated that &quot;there is a lack of systematic ordering and maintenance of contents about China&#x27;s major political discourse on Wikipedia&quot;. He also urged Wikipedia to reflect the voices and views of the Chinese government in an objective way. Lokman Tsui, an assistant professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said in an interview with the BBC that &quot;there are some misunderstandings about China abroad&quot;.

In October 2021, WMF&#x27;s application to become an observer at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) was blocked by the Chinese government over the existence of a Wikimedia Foundation affiliate in Taiwan and accusation of &quot;anti-China false information&quot;.

==== VPN exemptions ====
Despite being censored in mainland China, and as VPNs are normally not allowed to edit Wikipedia, Wikipedia administrators from China have permitted for a select number of mainland users. According to the Slate, &quot;one former Chinese Wikipedia editor told me that over the past few years there has been a &#x27;defection&#x27; of volunteer editors leaving Baidu Baike to join Chinese Wikipedia because the contributors wanted the privilege of working on a higher-quality internet encyclopedia—one that also carries a great deal of international power.&quot;

== Competitors ==
On 20 April 2006, the online Chinese search engine company Baidu created Baidu Baike, an online encyclopedia that registered users can edit, pending administrator reviews. The content of the encyclopedia is self-censored in accordance with the regulations of the People&#x27;s Republic of China government. Within weeks, the number of articles in Baidu Baike had surpassed that of the Chinese Wikipedia. However, Baidu Baike has been accused of copying and reproducing articles from Chinese Wikipedia.
As of October 2009, Hudong surpassed Baidu Baike as China&#x27;s largest online encyclopedia in terms of number of articles it owns. Hudong has since been renamed to Baike.

Baidu Baike and Hudong are both commercial products. Whereas the Chinese Wikipedia is released under the GNU Free Documentation License, Baidu Baike and Hudong are fully copyrighted by their ownership; contributors forfeit all rights upon submission. However, Baidu Baike has been accused of &quot;widespread copyright infringement&quot; by mass-copying Wikipedia pages and incorporating them into Baidu Baike pages since 2007.

<doc id="1197994" wikidata="Q5686044" url="?curid=1197994" title="Hayashi Hidesada">
<text>was a Japanese samurai and retainer of Oda clan, who lived during the Sengoku period. He was also known as . His court title was Governor of Sado Province (&quot;Sado no Kami&quot;). 
The Hayashi family, a branch of the Inaba clan, originated from the village of Oki in the Kasugai District of Owari Province.

== Biography ==
Michikatsu, born in the early decades of the 16th century, served the Oda clan, first under Oda Nobuhide, and then under the young Oda Nobunaga, upon Nobunaga&#x27;s assignment to Nagoya Castle. Hidesada was the head &quot;karō&quot;; together with Hirate Masahide, he served as Nobunaga&#x27;s guardian. In 1546, he assisted at Nobunaga&#x27;s genpuku ceremony.

Soon after Nobuhide&#x27;s death in 1551, Hidesada became concerned about Nobunaga&#x27;s erratic behavior, and secretly supported Oda Nobuyuki, Nobunaga&#x27;s brother, as successor to the family headship. 

In 1555, Nobunaga killed Oda Nobutomo and captured Kiyosu Castle; Hidesada was made to defend Nagoya Castle. Nobunaga unified the Oda clan by defeating all opponents, and took control of Owari Province. However, Hidesada was still deeply dissatisfied with Nobunaga.

In 1556, Hidesada together with Shibata Katsuie gathered troops to oust Nobunaga and replace him with Oda Nobuyuki. They lost in the Battle of Inō and a temporary truce was brokered by Nobunaga, who did not want to continue a fight that might draw an invasion from neighboring &quot;daimyōs&quot;. Hidesada and Katsuie were both pardoned and retained their positions to work for the Oda clan. Two years later, Nobuyuki was tricked again by Nobunaga; this time, he was killed.

In November 1575, he decided to retire. Oda Nobutada was then made the heir to the clan leadership, and Hidesada was ordered to mentor Nobutada. 

In August 1580, Nobunaga suddenly decided to banish Hidesada from all positions for having supported Nobuyuki in the past. The reason seems to be highly trivial and it is most likely that Nobunaga decided that Hidesada had outlived his usefulness and decided to trim down the number of retainers. He probably lived in Kyoto from that point onward, and died a few months later.

<doc id="1198001" wikidata="Q7990675" url="?curid=1198001" title="Wharfedale line">
<text>The Wharfedale line is one of the rail services in the West Yorkshire Metro area of northern England. The service connects Ilkley with Leeds and Bradford, and is operated by Northern Trains. West Yorkshire Metrocards are available for use on the line, covering Zones 3–5. The line is served predominantly by four-coach Class 333 electric multiple units as well as some three-coach Class 331 EMUs.

==The route==
The line was originally owned by the Midland Railway from Leeds to Burley-in-Wharfedale. At this point the line became joint property, with the North Eastern Railway, and was known as the &quot;Otley &amp; Ilkley Joint Railway&quot; (O&amp;IJt). The two lines from Leeds and Bradford come together at &quot;Esholt Junction&quot; – the location of an 1892 crash – south of Guiseley.

The route from Leeds leaves the main line near Calverley and continues along the Aire valley until climbing a hill to:

* Guiseley railway station
* Menston railway station
* Burley-in-Wharfedale railway station
* Ben Rhydding railway station
* Ilkley railway station

A new station, Kirkstall Forge, opened in 2016 on the Aire Valley section of the route between Leeds and Guiseley. The station at Kirkstall Forge provides a service on the Wharfedale line outside of peak hours only. Plans also exist to reinstate the O&amp;IJt branch line to Otley from &quot;Milner Wood Junction&quot;, between Menston and Burley.

The first section of the route from Bradford Forster Square is also used by the Airedale and Leeds–Bradford lines. The service to Ilkley branches north of Shipley railway station to:

* Baildon railway station a reopened station
* Esholt: station closed 
* Esholt Junction for the line to Leeds.
* and on to Guiseley, Menston, Burley-in-Wharfedale, Ben Rhydding and Ilkley

The line was electrified throughout using 25 kV AC Overhead between 1994 and 1995 by British Rail.
The now-closed and lifted Skipton-Ilkley line continued west of Ilkley via Addingham, Bolton Abbey and Embsay to Skipton. The section from Embsay to Bolton Abbey has been reopened by enthusiasts who operate steam locomotives as the Embsay and Bolton Abbey Steam Railway.

<doc id="1198005" wikidata="Q4698668" url="?curid=1198005" title="Airedale line">
<text>The Airedale line is one of the rail services in the West Yorkshire Metro area centred on West Yorkshire in northern England. The service is operated by Northern, on the route connecting Leeds and Bradford with Skipton. Some services along the line continue to Morecambe or Carlisle. The route covered by the service was historically part of the Midland Railway.

According to SELRAP, the Airedale line is the most heavily used passenger route outside the South East of England.

== The route and its history ==
The first section, between Leeds and Bradford (Forster Square station), was opened by the Leeds and Bradford Railway on 1 July 1846. A number of the intermediate stations were closed in March 1965 (as a result of the Beeching Axe), however the line and its major stations remained open. Some of the closed stations, such as , were re-opened during the 1980s.

In 1994 under Regional Railways, the line was electrified at 25 kV AC overhead between Leeds and Skipton, and new British Rail Class 333 trains were introduced in the early 2000s. Investment in the line has seen passenger numbers grow, and now overcrowding on trains is a problem. New stock and longer trains were introduced by the former Northern franchise Arriva Rail North in 2019 to tackle this issue.

The route is described below. The line originally included a number of stations which are now closed:
* Leeds – the station was named &quot;Leeds (Wellington)&quot; to differentiate it from the other main line stations in the city, belonging to the North Eastern Railway (NER)
* 
* Kirkstall Forge
* 
** Location of &quot;Apperley Junction&quot; for the Wharfedale line
* Apperley Bridge &amp; Rawdon – closed in 1965; new Apperley Bridge station opened in 2015
** Location of &quot;Apperley Viaducts&quot;
** Location of &quot;Thackley Tunnel&quot;
* This is the location of the triangular junction for the branch line serving Shipley and . The main line, which was opened from here to Skipton by the Leeds and Bradford Extension Railway in 1847, continues:
* Saltaire
** Location of &quot;Bingley tunnel&quot;
*Crossflatts
* Keighley
** Location of the &quot;Worth Valley Branch junction&quot; to Oxenhope. The branch is now the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway heritage line.
* Steeton &amp; Silsden
* 
* Skipton.

Trains of the Leeds–Morecambe line and Settle–Carlisle line also run along the Airedale line from Leeds.

== The line today ==

The line is operated by Northern Trains. The fare structure is as follows (these show the West Yorkshire Metro rail zones):
*Zone 1
** Leeds railway station
*Zone 2
** Kirkstall Forge
*Zone 3
** Apperley Bridge to Crossflatts. Shipley is also served by the Leeds–Bradford line and the Wharfedale line
*Zone 4
** Keighley
*Zone 5
** Steeton &amp; Silsden
*Zone 7 (from 17 May 2009)
**Cononley to Skipton

== The future ==
Network Rail previously looked at ways of increasing capacity on the line. Because of the difficulty of lengthening platforms at Shipley, it will be hard to introduce longer trains (i.e. 5 or 6 carriages) as was proposed on the neighbouring Wharfedale line. It was therefore proposed to run more trains per hour between Leeds and Keighley, a new platform at Keighley would have helped accommodate this. New stations were opened at Apperley Bridge in December 2015 and Kirkstall Forge in June 2016.

London North Eastern Railway currently operate a small number of daily services on the line, between Skipton/Bradford and London King&#x27;s Cross. These are operated by Class 91s and Class 801s. East Coast wanted to run more frequent services from December 2009 but to do so the line would need more capacity.

A 2008 report by &quot;Modern Railways&quot; claimed that a solid hourly service would operate on the line as far as Long Preston, but would serve Carlisle and Lancaster alternately. It may also become a freight artery to improve capacity on the West Coast Main Line. Network Rail&#x27;s own plans involved new signalling and other improvements for the sections of the line beyond Skipton. Carlisle services would be increased to a basic two-hour pattern with extra services to &#x27;fill in the gaps&#x27; at peak times during the day to give a 1 train/h frequency. Lancaster services would be made more frequent, however it was suggested they would be terminated at Skipton, rather than continuing through to Leeds. All of these plans were dependent on getting enough government funding.

<doc id="1198013" wikidata="Q338106" url="?curid=1198013" title="Alunite">
<text>Alunite is a hydroxylated aluminium potassium sulfate mineral, formula KAl3(SO4)2(OH)6. It was first observed in the 15th century at Tolfa, near Rome, where it was mined for the manufacture of alum. First called &quot;aluminilite&quot; by J.C. Delamétherie in 1797, this name was contracted by François Beudant three decades later to alunite.

Alunite crystals morphologically are rhombohedra with interfacial angles of 90° 50&#x27;, causing them to resemble cubes. Crystal symmetry is trigonal. Minute glistening crystals have also been found loose in cavities in altered rhyolite. Alunite varies in color from white to yellow gray. The hardness on the Mohs scale is 4 and the specific gravity is between 2.6 and 2.8. It is insoluble in water or weak acids, but soluble in sulfuric acid.
Sodium can substitute for potassium in the mineral, and when the sodium content is high, is called natroalunite.
Alunite is an analog of jarosite, where aluminium replaces Fe3+. Alunite occurs as a secondary mineral on iron sulfate ores.

Alunite occurs as veins and replacement masses in trachyte, rhyolite, and similar potassium rich volcanic rocks. It is formed by the action of sulfuric acid bearing solutions on these rocks during the oxidation and leaching of metal sulfide deposits. Alunite also is found near volcanic fumaroles. The white, finely granular masses closely resemble finely granular limestone, dolomite, anhydrite, and magnesite in appearance. The more compact kinds from Hungary are so hard and tough that they have been used for millstones.

Historically extensive deposits were mined in Tuscany and Hungary, and at Bulahdelah, New South Wales, Australia. It is currently mined at Tolfa, Italy. In the United States it is found in the San Juan district of Colorado; Goldfield, Nevada; the ghost town of Alunite, Utah near Marysvale; and Red Mountain near Patagonia, Arizona. The Arizona occurrence lies appropriately above a canyon named &quot;Alum Gulch&quot;. Alunite is mined as an ore of both potassium and aluminium at Marysvale. Some of the ore deposits were located by airborne and satellite multispectral imaging.

An article in the May/June 2019 issue of Archaeology magazine states that in China, in Henan province, an assortment of ceramic objects and jars were found, dating back 2000 years. In one of the jars, a mixture of alunite and potassium nitrate was found. The mixture was then thought to be a &quot;mixture of immortality&quot; mentioned in ancient Chinese texts. Obviously, this does not appear to have succeeded.

<text>SGH Warsaw School of Economics (, &quot;SGH&quot;) is the oldest and most prestigious business school in Poland. 

SGH Warsaw School of Economics was founded in 1906 as a private school named &quot;August Zieliński Private Trade Courses for Men&quot;. On 30 July 1919, it became a separate legal entity and was granted the status of an institution of higher education. The school was renamed &quot;Szkoła Główna Handlowa (SGH)&quot; in 1933. After World War II, SGH was nationalized and its name changed to &quot;Szkoła Główna Planowania i Statystyki (Main School of Planning and Statistics)&quot;, abbreviation SGPiS. The school regained its pre-war name after the fall of communism in 1991.

SGH Warsaw School of Economics offers courses leading to bachelor&#x27;s or master&#x27;s degrees to both full-time and extramural students. It also provides programs for doctoral and postgraduate degrees. Its Finance and Accounting program was ranked among the Top 60 Masters in Management by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; in 2018.

SGH Warsaw School of Economics cooperates with around 200 higher education institutions worldwide within student and staff exchange areas. It is a member of the Community of European Management Schools and International Companies (CEMS), the Erasmus Programme, the Partnership in International Management Network (PIM), and the European University Association (EUA).

The main campus is located at the northern edge of the Mokotów district of Warsaw. Bus and tram stops, as well as the Pole Mokotowskie metro station, are nearby.

==Organizational structure==
SGH Warsaw School of Economics abandoned the traditional departmental structure segregating students based on their major.

Professors and research and teaching programs are grouped in five Colleges (Collegiums) and several extra-collegial units, such as the foreign language teaching center.

==Courses offered==
Full-time and part-time studies are conducted in two levels. Bachelor studies, which last for six semesters, lead to a Bachelor&#x27;s professional title. Holders of such a title may apply for a place and begin Master&#x27;s studies, which last for four semesters. Accumulating the required minimum points, as well as credit terms, is necessary to earn a diploma. Individual subjects are divided into mandatory selections for particular fields, optional for those subjects, additional courses that develop knowledge unrelated to specific subjects, and courses essential for all economists. Certain subjects can have different numbers of points for each of these types of items.

SGH full-time students are offered the following fields of study in Polish:
* Economics,
* European Master in Law and Economics,
* European Studies,
* Finance and Accounting,
* Quantitative Methods in Economics and Information Systems,
* Management (Business Administration),
* Public Sector Economics (Public Administration),
* Social Policy,
* Spatial Economic Policy,
* International Economics,
* Big Data.

From the 2006/2007 Academic Year SGH Studies are divided into:
* Bachelor&#x27;s Studies (undergraduate) – 6-semester
* Master&#x27;s Studies (graduate) – 4-semester
* Doctoral Studies – 6-semester
* System based on ECTS credits

During the first three semesters, all SGH students study basic macro- and micro-economics, mathematics, statistics, philosophy, social science, law, history, geography, and languages. After passing the required examinations for the first three semesters, they must register for one of the six offered areas of study. The BA degree is granted after completing a required number of credits (about six semesters of studies), and the MA (MSc) degree is awarded after completing about eight to ten semesters (including six semesters for the BA), which is the maximum period of tuition-free study at SGH. Students do not necessarily have a BA diploma before applying for a master&#x27;s degree. The time required for the degree in the given specialization depends mostly on the students themselves due to the free choice of courses (some limitations apply), professors, and the maximum workload per semester.

==International cooperation==
SGH cooperates with over 250 foreign universities, as well as with many international organizations. The main partners are universities from the European Union, North America, and Asia. Each year, the international exchange involves about 500 SGH students, and the university hosts over 300 students from foreign institutes. Significant international cooperation programs include LLP Erasmus, CEMS (The Global Alliance in Management Education), Polish-German Academic Forum at SGH, Partnership in International Management (PIM), as well as double diploma programs (i.e. with Technische Universität Berlin), and other bilateral agreements.

==Student organizations==
The Student Union, an elective body representing all SGH students in the School&#x27;s Senate and participating in setting all study regulations, provides students with housing and financial aid as well as organizes a wide range of cultural events.

<text>The decisional Diffie–Hellman (DDH) assumption is a computational hardness assumption about a certain problem involving discrete logarithms in cyclic groups. It is used as the basis to prove the security of many cryptographic protocols, most notably the ElGamal and Cramer–Shoup cryptosystems.

==Definition==

Consider a (multiplicative) cyclic group formula_1 of order formula_2, and with generator formula_3. The DDH assumption states that, given formula_4 and formula_5 for uniformly and independently chosen formula_6, the value formula_7 &quot;looks like&quot; a random element in formula_1.

This intuitive notion can be formally stated by saying that the following two probability distributions are computationally indistinguishable (in the security parameter, formula_9):
* formula_10, where formula_11 and formula_12 are randomly and independently chosen from formula_13.
* formula_14, where formula_15 are randomly and independently chosen from formula_13.

Triples of the first kind are often called DDH triplet or DDH tuples.

==Relation to other assumptions==

The DDH assumption is related to the discrete log assumption. If it were possible to efficiently compute discrete logs in formula_1, then the DDH assumption would not hold in formula_1. Given formula_19, one could efficiently decide whether formula_20 by first taking the discrete formula_21 of formula_4, and then comparing formula_23 with formula_24.

DDH is considered to be a stronger assumption than the discrete logarithm assumption, because there are groups for which computing discrete logs is believed to be hard (And thus the DL Assumption is believed to be true), but detecting DDH tuples is easy (And thus DDH is false). Because of this, requiring that the DDH assumption holds in a group is believed to be a more restrictive requirement than DL.

The DDH assumption is also related to the computational Diffie–Hellman assumption (CDH). If it were possible to efficiently compute formula_7 from formula_26, then one could easily distinguish the two probability distributions above. DDH is considered to be a stronger assumption than CDH because if CDH is solved, which means we can get formula_7, the answer to DDH will become obvious.

==Other properties==

The problem of detecting DDH tuples is random self-reducible, meaning, roughly, that if it is hard for even a small fraction of inputs, it is hard for almost all inputs; if it is easy for even a small fraction of inputs, it is easy for almost all inputs.

==Groups for which DDH is assumed to hold==

When using a cryptographic protocol whose security depends on the DDH assumption, it is important that the protocol is implemented using groups where DDH is believed to hold:

* The subgroup formula_28 of formula_29-th residues modulo a prime formula_30, where formula_2 is also a large prime (also called a Schnorr group). For the case of formula_32, this corresponds to the group of quadratic residues modulo a safe prime.
* The quotient group formula_33 for a safe prime formula_34, which consists of the cosets formula_35. These cosets formula_36 can be represented by formula_37, which implies formula_38. Since formula_33 and formula_28 are isomorphic, and the isomorphism can be computed efficiently in both direction, DDH is equally hard in both groups.
* A prime-order elliptic curve formula_41 over the field formula_42, where formula_43 is prime, provided formula_41 has large embedding degree.
* A Jacobian of a hyper-elliptic curve over the field formula_42 with a prime number of reduced divisors, where formula_43 is prime, provided the Jacobian has large embedding degree.

Importantly, the DDH assumption does not hold in the multiplicative group formula_47, where formula_43 is prime. This is because if formula_3 is a generator of formula_47, then the Legendre symbol of formula_4 reveals if formula_11 is even or odd. Given formula_4, formula_5 and formula_7, one can thus efficiently compute and compare the least significant bit of formula_11, formula_12 and formula_58, respectively, which provides a probabilistic method to distinguish formula_7 from a random group element.

The DDH assumption does not hold on elliptic curves over formula_42 with small embedding degree (say, less than formula_61), a class which includes supersingular elliptic curves. This is because the Weil pairing or Tate pairing can be used to solve the problem directly as follows: given formula_62 on such a curve, one can compute formula_63 and formula_64. By the bilinearity of the pairings, the two expressions are equal if and only if formula_65 modulo the order of formula_66. If the embedding degree is large (say around the size of formula_43) then the DDH assumption will still hold because the pairing cannot be computed. Even if the embedding degree is small, there are some subgroups of the curve in which the DDH assumption is believed to hold.

<text>Rules of Engagement is a 2000 American war legal drama film, directed by William Friedkin, written by Stephen Gaghan, from a story by Jim Webb, and starring Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson. Jackson plays U.S. Marine Colonel Terry Childers, who is brought to court-martial after Marines under his orders kill several civilians outside the U.S. embassy in Yemen.

==Plot==

In 1968, during the Vietnam War, a disastrous American advance leaves U.S. Marine Lieutenant Hayes Hodges wounded and his men dead. His fellow platoon leader Lieutenant Terry Childers executes a North Vietnamese prisoner to intimidate a captive officer into calling off a mortar attack on Hodges&#x27; position; sparing the officer&#x27;s life, Childers rescues Hodges. In 1996, Hodges, now a colonel, is set to retire after 28 years as a JAG officer. At his pre-retirement party at the Camp Lejeune Officers Club, he is honored by his old friend, Colonel Terry Childers, now the commanding officer of a Marine Expeditionary Unit.

Childers and his unit are deployed to Southwest Asia as part of an Amphibious Readiness Group, called to evacuate the U.S. Ambassador to Yemen when a routine anti-American demonstration at the embassy erupts in rock-throwing, Molotov cocktails, and gunfire. Escorting Ambassador Mourain and his family safely to a helicopter, Childers retrieves the embassy&#x27;s American flag. Under heavy fire from snipers on nearby rooftops, three Marines are killed, and Childers orders his men to open fire on the crowd, resulting in the deaths of 83 irregular Yemeni soldiers and civilians, including children; the remaining Marines and embassy staff are saved.

Following this, American relations in the Middle East severely deteriorate, so U.S. National Security Advisor Bill Sokal pressures the military to court-martial Childers, hoping to salvage relations by placing all blame for the incident on the colonel. Childers asks Hodges to serve as his defense attorney, and he reluctantly accepts. Hodges rejects a plea deal from the prosecutor, Major Biggs, who is convinced of Childers&#x27; guilt but privately refuses to consider the death penalty. With little time to prepare a defense, Hodges goes to Yemen, where witnesses and police claim that the Marines fired first on the unarmed crowd. Visiting the abandoned embassy and some of the wounded, he notices an undamaged security camera and scattered audio cassette tapes.

Returning to the U.S., Hodges confronts Childers about the complete lack of evidence to support his version of events, resulting in a fistfight. Sokal burns a videotape revealing the crowd was armed and fired on the Marines, and forces Mourain to lie on the stand that the crowd was peaceful, and that Childers ignored his orders and was violent and disrespectful to him and his family. Hodges meets with Mourain&#x27;s wife, who admits Childers acted valiantly but refuses to testify. Captain Lee, who hesitated to follow Childers&#x27; order, is unable to testify to having seen gunfire from the crowd. A Yemeni doctor testifies that the tapes Hodges found are propaganda inciting violence against Americans, but declares the protest was peaceful.

With Sokal on the stand, Hodges presents a shipping manifest proving that the tape from the undamaged camera – the tape Sokal burned – was delivered to Sokal&#x27;s office but disappeared, with footage that would likely have exonerated Childers. Taking the stand, Childers explains that he was the only surviving Marine able to see the crowd was armed. On cross-examination, Biggs goads Childers into admitting that he ordered his men to open fire by shouting &quot;waste the motherfuckers&quot;. Childers loses his temper, declaring that he would not sacrifice the lives of his men to appease the likes of Biggs, to Hodges&#x27; dismay.

The prosecution presents Colonel Binh Le Cao, the Vietnamese officer whose life he spared, as a rebuttal witness, testifying that Childers executed an unarmed prisoner of war. During Hodges&#x27; cross-examination, Cao agrees that Childers took action to save American lives, and that if circumstances were reversed, Cao would have done the same. After the trial, Hodges confronts Sokal about the missing tape, vowing to uncover the truth. Childers is found guilty of the minor charge of breach of peace, but cleared of conduct unbecoming an officer, and murder; Biggs approaches Hodges about investigating Childers&#x27; actions in Vietnam, but Hodges declines to testify. Leaving the courthouse, Cao and Childers salute each other.

An epilogue reveals that Sokal was found guilty of destroying evidence and Mourain of perjury, both losing their jobs, while Childers retired honorably.

==Cast==

In addition, Baoan Coleman portrays retired NVA Colonel Binh Le Cao, while G. Gordon Liddy has a cameo as a talk show host. This was also one of the last movie roles that David Graf played before dying from a heart attack the following year.

==Production==
===Development===
The script was based on an original screenplay by future U.S. senator James Webb. It had previously been in development at Universal Pictures for about ten years before being acquired by Paramount Pictures, where the script was further developed under producer Scott Rudin, with Sylvester Stallone in talks to star in the film. William Friedkin was hired to direct, but had trouble collaborating with Webb on script rewrites. Rudin passed the project over to Richard Zanuck, who then hired Stephen Gaghan to rewrite the screenplay, Gaghan dived into the project, reading the Tim O&#x27;Brien&#x27; novels &quot;The Things They Carried&quot; and &quot;Going After Cacciato&quot;, and watching the 1957 film &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;. Webb hated Gaghan&#x27;s work and frustrated the filmmaker&#x27;s attempts to receive cooperation from the Department of Defense, which was eventually obtained nonetheless.

===Filming===
Location shooting took place in Ouarzazate, Morocco, Nokesville, Virginia, Warrenton, Virginia (military base scenes), Hunting Island, South Carolina (Vietnam scenes), and Mount Washington, Virginia (Gen. Hodges&#x27; estate scenes).

The film was assisted in its production by the United States Department of Defense and the United States Marine Corps.

==Reception ==

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, of critics&#x27; reviews are positive, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;The script is unconvincing and the courtroom action is unengaging.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 45% based on reviews from 31 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;C−&quot; on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, gave it two and a half out of four stars, praising its &quot;expert melodrama&quot; while criticizing an &quot;infuriating screenplay&quot;. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;lazily plotted, grotesquely dishonest, and dripping with a creepy strain of Islamophobia&quot;. Charles Gittins, writing from a legal perspective for CNN, wrote that &quot;the movie succeeds in capturing the details of a successful military operation and showing the possible political fallout from such an operation. The drama lags, however, once it enters the courtroom where &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot; is neither accurate nor compelling.&quot;

The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee described it as &quot;probably the most racist film ever made against Arabs by Hollywood&quot;, comparing it with &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; and &quot;The Eternal Jew&quot;. Director William Friedkin, dismissed accusations that the film was racist:
Let me state right up front, the film is not anti-Arab, is not anti-Muslim and is certainly not anti-Yemen. In order to make the film in Morocco, the present King of Morocco had to read the script and approve it and sign his name ... and nobody participating from the Arab side of things felt that the film was anti-Arab. The film is anti-terrorist. It takes a strong stand against terrorism and it says that terrorism wears many faces ... but we haven&#x27;t made this film to slander the government of Yemen. It&#x27;s a democracy and I don&#x27;t believe for a moment they support terrorists any more than America does.

Friedkin later stated the film &quot;was a box office hit but many critics saw it as jingoism&quot;. He says that James Webb later saw the film on the recommendation of his friend Colonel David Hackworth; Webb then rang Friedkin to say how much he liked it.

Jack G. Shaheen in a review for the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs called it &quot;the most blatantly racist movie I have ever seen&quot;. Another review in Senses of Cinema said that the &quot;political perspective of Rules of Engagement seems to belong to another era altogether. It carries an almost anachronistic fondness for the war in Vietnam, and seems intent on validating America’s involvement in the conflict&quot;.

<text>The Antigua and Barbuda national football team is the national team of Antigua and Barbuda.

Founded in 1928, it is controlled by the Antigua and Barbuda Football Association, a member of the CONCACAF and the Caribbean Football Union (CFU). The team has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup or the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

==History==

===First international match===
On November 10, 1972, Antigua and Barbuda&#x27;s first match was a 1974 FIFA World Cup qualifying match versus Trinidad and Tobago in Port of Spain. The match was a 11–1 thrashing which to this day is this national team&#x27;s worst defeat.

===Friendlies against European teams===
On 17 December 2005, the Antigua and Barbuda national team played their first match against a European opponent after the Hungarian Football Federation invited &quot;the Benna Boys&quot; to play Hungary in an international friendly at Lockhart Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This was the first match coached by former national striker Derrick Edwards. Hungary defeated Antigua and Barbuda 3–0.

On 2 May 2016, the Estonian Football Association announced that their national team would play Antigua and Barbuda in an international friendly on 22 November. It was the team&#x27;s second match against a European opponent. Estonia won the game 1–0.

===2018 drug bust in Jamaica===
During the March 2018 FIFA Calendar Antigua and Barbuda played Jamaica, drawing 1–1 away at Sabina Park, levelling in the last seconds of match from a header from Peter Byers. Upon the team&#x27;s preparation for their departure back to Antigua, assistant coach Derrick Edwards and equipment manager Danny Benjamin were arrested and charged with possession of, dealing in, and taking steps to export marijuana, and conspiracy at the Norman Manley International Airport. Initially, Edwards was awarded bail and Benjamin was held without bail; after a month, both Edwards and Benjamin were placed under house arrest and curfew and gave up their travel documents. Both men were acquitted of the crime on 14 June, citing there was not enough evidence to prove their involvement in the carrying the drugs with the intention of smuggling them out of Jamaica.

==Team image==

===Nicknames===
The official nickname of the Antigua and Barbuda national football team is &quot;the Benna Boys&quot;, referring to a genre of Antiguan and Barbudan music similar to calypso. The name was selected in a contest with the fanbase in 2012 after the team advanced to the third round of the 2014 World Cup qualifiers. &quot;The Benna Boys&quot; beat out other entries in the contest such as &quot;Beach Boys&quot;, &quot;Iron Bandits&quot;, &quot;Rhythm Warriors&quot; and &quot;Party Crashers&quot;. In the past, the national team was unofficially known as &quot;the Wadadli Boys&quot;, another name that was in the contest but did not win.

===Kit suppliers===

The kit of the national team has been manufactured by Spanish-based Joma since March 2021, ahead of the first round of the 2022 World Cup qualifiers.

<text>A currier is a specialist in the leather-processing trade. After the tanning process, the currier applies techniques of dressing, finishing and colouring to a tanned hide to make it strong, flexible and waterproof.
The leather is stretched and burnished to produce a uniform thickness and suppleness, and dyeing and other chemical finishes give the leather its desired colour.

After currying, the leather is then ready to pass to the fashioning trades such as saddlery, bridlery, shoemaking or glovemaking.

<doc id="1198028" wikidata="Q6209481" url="?curid=1198028" title="Joe Deters">
<text>Joseph Theodore Deters (born April 4, 1957) is an American politician and lawyer who has served as a justice of the Ohio Supreme Court since 2023.

== Early life, family, and education ==
Deters is a lifelong Cincinnatian. He is one of eight children born to Nancy and Donald Deters. His grandfather, Daniel Tehan, was a longtime Hamilton County Sheriff.

Deters graduated from St. Xavier High School in 1975. He graduated with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Cincinnati in 1979, and his Juris Doctor from the University of Cincinnati College of Law in 1982.

==Career==
Deters began his career in public service in 1982 as an Assistant Hamilton County Prosecutor. In 1988, after six years as an Assistant Prosecutor, Deters was elected the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts. In 1992, Deters returned to the Hamilton County Prosecutor&#x27;s office when he was appointed and later elected Prosecuting Attorney. He was reelected in 1996.

In 1999, Deters was sworn in as Ohio&#x27;s 44th State Treasurer. Deters resigned from office in 2004 amid a pay-to-play scandal that saw Deters&#x27;s former chief of staff, Matt Borges plead guilty to improper use of a public office. Borges traded campaign contributions for preferential treatment in receiving state contracts. Deters was never implicated or charged in the scheme.

In the fall of 2004, Deters became a write-in candidate for his former position, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney. He was elected Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney on November 2, 2004, with nearly 60% of the vote. He was reelected in 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2020. Deters resigned as Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney after being appointed to the Supreme Court of Ohio in 2023. On April 1, 2005, Deters and Matthias Heck were sued in their official capacity in a federal lawsuit, &quot;Citizens for Tax Reform v. Deters&quot;.

As Prosecutor, Deters has managed high-profile cases that have attracted national and international attention. In 1987, he led the investigation of Donald Harvey, a convicted serial killer who pleaded guilty to murdering 37 people as apla hospital orderly. Approximately 30 years later, he prosecuted his fifth serial killer, Samuel Little, who murdered two Cincinnati women over the course of a 30-year killing spree. In total, Deters has prosecuted six serial killers.

In 2012, Deters was highly critical of Xavier University for expelling Dezmine Wells, one of its basketball players, due to a rape allegation. Prior to the school hearing on the matter, a grand jury had refused to prosecute Wells, and Deters—who is known for being tough on crime and said the prosecutor&#x27;s office had conducted a thorough investigation—maintained that the accusation lacked any credibility and the decision &quot;wasn&#x27;t even close.&quot; He said that the school proceedings had egregiously violated Wells&#x27; right to a fair hearing by putting the burden of proof on Wells instead of his accuser, had assigned incompetent staff to examine the forensic evidence, and prevented Wells from presenting evidence which would have proven his innocence. After learning of Xavier&#x27;s decision, he called for the university to reexamine Wells&#x27; expulsion.

On July 29, 2015, Deters oversaw the indictment of University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing in the killing of Sam DuBose during a traffic stop. He called the killing &quot;totally unwarranted&quot; and &quot;senseless.&quot; His comments regarding the killing received some criticism from the public. Many critics also pointed to the published comments of the editorial board of the Cincinnati Enquirer which had previously criticized Deters for his remarks about a violent assault earlier that month which he had decided not to charge as a racially motivated crime. In describing the people responsible for the assault, Deters called such people &quot;soulless and unsalvageable&quot; and implied that he perceived a race or broadly generalized socioeconomic status origin to this type of violence when he said further:

Nevertheless, the office worked quickly to complete the investigation, filing charges just 10 days after the initial shooting. However, a divided jury failed to reach a verdict on two separate occasions, prompting Deters’ announcement that the County would not try the case a third time.

Following a violent 2021 Fourth of July weekend in Cincinnati, which included a shooting at a downtown park, Deters announced that the office would no longer offer plea bargains in any cases involving gun violence or possession of illegal firearms. He added, “People must be held accountable for their choices. As a community, we must stand together and say ‘enough is enough.’”

In 2023, Xavier University announced that Justice Deters would be serving in the new position of Justice In Residence on campus. In this role, Deters will be participating in classroom discussions with students as well as advise students in his area of expertise.

==Political positions==
Throughout his tenure, Deters has gained a reputation for being a “tough on crime” prosecutor, believing in strict punishments for violent crime, including the death penalty. He has maintained this stance, even after a Vatican official rebuked Deters, a Roman Catholic, for pursuing the death penalty for serial killer Anthony Kirkland, who killed two adult women and two young girls between 2006 and 2009. Responding to the official, Deters said:

He has repeated that he was elected to uphold Ohio law, which includes the death penalty. To critics, he states, “If the citizens of Ohio want the law changed, they should contact their state representative and let him or her know. I have no quarrel with that.”

In July 2018, Deters said he wants the state to bring back death penalty by firing squad amid complaints about lethal injection.

However, since assuming office, Deters has also supported diversion programs, aiming to help “low-level, nonviolent offenders avoid jail time, find rehabilitation, and get their lives back on track.” In 2010, he helped establish the Hamilton County Drug Court – the first in the state of Ohio. Other programs his office have sponsored include Mental Health Court, Juvenile Diversion Program, and CHANGE Court, a specialized court serving those charged with prostitution and related offenses.

==Affiliations==
Deters is a member of the Cincinnati Bar Association, National District Attorneys Association, and Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association. He has served on the University of Cincinnati Board of Trustees, Ohio Organized Crime Commission, and the Southern Ohio Leukemia Foundation.

==Personal life==
He has four children and two grandchilden. Since October 2021, he is married to Tanya O&#x27;Rourke.

==Electoral history==

=== 1988 - Clerk of Courts Election ===
In 1988, Deters was appointed Hamilton County Clerk of Courts and sought election to the office that year. He campaigned on the platform to revitalize and modernize the office, which he had previously described as operating in “the dark ages.” Upon winning election, he first adopted a zero tolerance policy concerning theft in the office, aggressively pursuing employees who embezzled funds. Furthermore, he ceased the practice of political payroll deductions, which, at the time, had been prevalent within many county offices across Ohio. As Clerk, he administered a yearly budget of more than 10 million dollars.

=== 1992 - Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney Election ===
Likewise, in 1992, Deters was appointed Hamilton County Prosecutor and sought election to the office later that year. As a candidate, he led the ticket for administrative offices, promising to implement policies and innovations that would elevate the office to a higher level, including a Victims Assistance Program, an Environmental Prosecution Unit, and a County Public Corruption Unit. He defeated Democrat Robert Gutwiller, winning 64.1 percent of the vote.

=== 1996 - Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney Election ===
In 1996, Deters ran for re-election unopposed, capturing over 250 thousand votes.

=== 1998 - Ohio State Treasurer Election ===
With endorsements from the Ohio Fraternal Order of Police and Ohio Certified Public Accountants, Deters sought to capture the position of State Treasurer, promising to ensure the safety of public monies and diversify the state’s debt portfolio. He defeated Democrat John Donofrio, earning 70 percent of the vote.

=== 2002 - Ohio State Treasurer Election ===
In 2002, Deters battled Democrat Mary O. Boyle, a former State Legislator, for re-election to the Treasurer seat. If re-elected, Deters sought to continue the process of digitizing the office, receiving and distributing money electronically. A close race, Deters won the reelection after capturing roughly 53 percent of the vote.

=== 2004 - Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney Election ===
Deters entered the 2004 Prosecutor race after then-Hamilton County Prosecutor Michael Allen withdrew amid allegations of sexual harassment. Given that this was also a Presidential Election year, Deters felt it was crucial to enter so that Republicans could retain viability and legitimacy within the region. A write-in candidate, he faced Democrat Fanon Rucker, who previously served as an Assistant Prosecutor for the City of Cincinnati. Deters eventually won with 57 percent of the vote.

=== 2008 - Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney Election ===
In 2008, Deters ran for re-election unopposed, again capturing over 250 thousand votes.

=== 2012 - Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney Election ===
Facing Former City of Cincinnati Prosecuting Attorney Janaya Trotter, Deters campaigned on the promise to continue removing violent offenders from the streets and ensuring the safety of Hamilton County residents. Deters later defeated Trotter, garnering 59 percent of the vote.

=== 2016 - Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney Election ===
In his bid for a sixth term, Deters faced Alan Triggs, a former assistant prosecutor and Magistrate Judge. Deters campaigned on a similar platform, aggressively prosecuting violent criminals while seeking opportunities for diversion programs, where appropriate. He won by among the narrowest margins of his career in this race, winning roughly 54 percent of the vote.

=== 2020 - Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney Election ===
A re-match of the 2004 write-in campaign, Deters faced and eventually defeated Fanon Rucker in the 2020 Election. Calling it the “most satisfying” victory of his political career, Deters won after his campaign targeted voters who had become dissatisfied with then-Republican President Donald Trump, overcoming the president’s 65 thousand-vote deficit in Hamilton County.

<doc id="1198042" wikidata="Q22815127" url="?curid=1198042" title="Mirrodin">
<text>Mirrodin is the name of the &quot;&quot; expert-level block containing the Mirrodin (October 2, 2003, 306 cards), Darksteel (February 6, 2004, 165 cards) and Fifth Dawn (June 4, 2004, 165 cards) expansion sets. The Mirrodin expansion set, as well as the rest of the block, is centered on artifacts and was only the second set to do so (from a card frequency point of view) since &quot;Antiquities&quot;. The percentage of artifact cards is much higher than in any preceding set. Each of the expansion symbols in the Mirrodin block depicts a legendary artifact: (&quot;Mirrodin&quot;), (&quot;Darksteel&quot;) and (&quot;Fifth Dawn&quot;).

==Storyline: The world of Mirrodin==
The setting for &quot;Mirrodin&quot; is a plane by the same name. An artificial world created by the planeswalker Karn, originally named Argentum, and named after the Mirari by Memnarch, Mirrodin&#x27;s environments and inhabitants mix organic and metallic. Mirrodin is orbited by four satellites, which are called suns and moons interchangeably, that correspond to red, black, white and blue magic. Green was notably absent until Glissa Sunseeker became a conduit for its birth.

The set focuses on five main regions on Mirrodin, each corresponding to a part of the Magic color pie:
* The Oxidda Chain, a range of mountains populated by goblins and the human Vulshok tribe.
* The Tangle, a dense jungle populated by elves, the human Sylvok tribe and beasts.
* The Mephidross, a mucky swamp, and a home of Nim (zombies) and the human Moriok tribe.
* Quicksilver Sea, a sea of mercury populated by Vedalken and the human Neurok tribe.
* Razor Grass Fields, the plains of Mirrodin, overgrown with sharp metallic grass and home to the Leonin, the human Auriok tribe and Loxodon.

The main character of the story is the elf Glissa Sunseeker, who visits all these places, guided by revenge against the machines that killed her family. The story is captured in the novel &quot;The Moons of Mirrodin&quot; by Will McDermott. &quot;Magic&quot; returned to the setting of Mirrodin with the Scars of Mirrodin block.

===Darksteel===
&quot;The Darksteel Eye&quot; is the second novel in the Mirrodin Cycle by Jess Lebow. It continues the journey of Glissa, after the infiltration of the Synod and the recollection of all the golem Bosh&#x27;s memories. They now must travel back across Mirrodin to seek the power that resides in the center of Mirrodin.

===Fifth Dawn===
The final book in this expansion series is named &quot;The Fifth Dawn.&quot; In the story, Glissa, Bosh, and Slobad journey deep within Mirrodin&#x27;s core to confront the insidious Memnarch. With them is the Kaldra avatar—an immensely powerful being of energy summoned when Kaldra&#x27;s sword, shield, and helm were brought together. But what was supposed to be the world&#x27;s salvation turns out to be a vile trick. With a single spell, Memnarch seizes the avatar and turns it on Glissa and her companions. Kaldra&#x27;s avatar relentlessly pursues Glissa into the Tangle, destroying everything in its way. Finally, at the Radix, Glissa&#x27;s destiny becomes clear. As rage and despair overcome her, Glissa&#x27;s body calls forth a great column of green mana from Mirrodin&#x27;s core, annihilating the avatar in the process. Now that mana hangs overhead in a glowing sphere—the green sun at last, Mirrodin&#x27;s fifth dawn.

==Set history==

===Mirrodin===
&quot;Mirrodin&quot; is notable for being the first expansion set to feature the new card front design (which debuted in &quot;8th Edition&quot;). The high number of artifacts in &quot;Mirrodin&quot; highlighted the inherent flaw of the new border design — artifact cards, which were now bordered in a very light grey instead of brown, were very hard to distinguish from white cards. The problem prompted Wizards of the Coast to change the bordering background of artifact cards to a much darker grey in &quot;Fifth Dawn&quot;. Also due to complications when switching to the new card frame, mana symbols in the text box of &quot;Mirrodin&quot; cards are greyed out instead of being in color. Beginning with &quot;Mirrodin&quot; Wizards reduced the size of their large expansion sets from 350 to 306 cards. This was due to regular complaints, that Wizards was producing too many cards and players could not keep up. Beginning with &quot;Darksteel&quot; Wizards also increased the size of small expansion sets from 143 to 165 cards. Thus the number of cards released each year would stay the same, but then &quot;Magic&quot; developer Randy Buehler explained that Wizards believed this change would make it easier for collectors and players to keep up with the number of new cards as these would be released more homogeneously over the course of the year.

===Darksteel===
&quot;Darksteel&quot; was the first &quot;small&quot; expansion to have 165 cards, whereas previous small expansions had 143, (with the exception of &quot;Legions&quot; which had 145 as a balance among the five colors.)

===Fifth Dawn===
The name &quot;Fifth Dawn&quot; is derived from the plane&#x27;s five suns. Each sun is associated with a color of mana and the green sun, which has long been absent, returns to the sky as part of this set&#x27;s storyline. &quot;Fifth Dawn&quot; adds a new twist to artifact theme of &quot;Mirrodin&quot; and &quot;Darksteel&quot;: it encourages using colored mana for playing artifact spells, via the Sunburst mechanic (see below). &quot;Fifth Dawn&quot; introduced an enhanced design for artifact cards, which uses a darker inner border to help players distinguish artifacts from white cards. &quot;Fifth Dawn&quot; theme decks contained a few reprints from &quot;Mirrodin&quot; and &quot;Darksteel&quot; with the improved card face.

==Mechanics==
&quot;Mirrodin&quot; introduced a number of new mechanics, including Equipment, Affinity, Imprint and Entwine. The artifact subtype Equipment, which has become a staple of &quot;Magic&quot;, represented weapons, clothing and armor that could be wielded or worn by creatures. Equipment functions like the older &quot;Enchant Creature&quot; cards (now called Auras) in that they provide some effect while attached to the creature. Unlike Auras, however, Equipment can only be attached to creatures you control in most cases, and remain in play even if the creature they were attached to leaves play. Affinity reduces the total cost of the spell by the number of permanents in play of a certain type, which in the case of Mirrodin was always artifacts or basic land types. Entwine was an optional cost on modal instants and sorceries, which allows a player to choose all effects (rather than only one) if the Entwine cost was paid. The Imprint keyword allowed an artifact to gain additional effects if another card is exiled and imprinted on that artifact. Mirrodin also had an infamous cycle of artifact lands.

&quot;Darksteel&quot; continued the Equipment, Affinity, Imprint and Entwine mechanics, and introduced the indestructible and modular keywords. Something that is or has indestructible can&#x27;t be destroyed by damage or &quot;destroy effects&quot;. In &quot;Darksteel&quot;, indestructible cards (all of which were artifacts) are made of the titular metal, though other things have been deemed indestructible when it became a common mechanic in later sets (similar to Double Strike, introduced in the &quot;Onslaught)&quot;. Modular was a keyworded ability of artifact creatures, these creatures would come into play with a set number of counters and, upon the destruction of that creature, could transfer them to another artifact creature. Modular was part of a larger theme of charge counters on artifacts throughout the set.

Fifth Dawn introduced the Sunburst and Scry mechanics. Artifacts with Sunburst get +1/+1 counters (if the card is a creature) or charge counters (if noncreature) for each color of mana used to pay the artifact&#x27;s mana cost. &quot;Scry X&quot; means &quot;Look at the top X cards of your library. Put any number of them on the bottom of your library and the rest on top in any order.&quot; X was always 2 in Fifth Dawn, but other numbers were introduced when Scry was reprised for subsequent sets.

==Notable cards==
One notable cycle in Mirrodin was the cycle of artifact lands (, , , and ). These enhanced the power of cards with the &quot;Affinity&quot; mechanic by increasing the number of artifacts in play while still being considered lands. Due to abuse, they are banned or restricted in some formats. Other notable cards include and .

<text>The Anguilla National Football Team is the national team of Anguilla, a British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean, and is controlled by the Anguilla Football Association. It is affiliated to the Caribbean Football Union of CONCACAF. The team has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup or the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

==History==
===2002 World Cup qualification===

Anguilla entered the World Cup qualifiers for the first time for the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan.

In the first round of the qualifiers, Anguilla were drawn against the Bahamas. On 5 March 2000, Anguilla hosted the first leg in front of 250 people at Webster Park in The Valley, losing by a scoreline of 3–1. In front of a Bahamian crowd of just 330, the second leg was played at the Thomas Robinson Stadium in Nassau on 19 March 2000, with Anguilla losing 2–1, and thereby eliminated by an aggregate scoreline of 5–2.

===2006 World Cup qualification===

During the qualifiers for the 2006 World Cup in Germany, Anguilla faced the Dominican Republic in the first round. The first leg was played to a goalless draw at the Estadio Olímpico Juan Pablo Duarte in Santo Domingo on 19 March 2004. Newly introduced FIFA stadium requirements forced Anguilla to play their &quot;home&quot; leg at the same Dominican Republic stadium two days later, with the Dominican Republic winning the second leg and thus the first round by a scoreline of 6–0.

===2010 World Cup qualification===

During the qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Anguilla was drawn against El Salvador in the first round. On 6 February 2008, they lost 12–0 at the Estadio Cuscatlán in San Salvador, where striker Rudis Corrales scored five times and Ronald Cerritos three. This time, Anguilla played their &quot;home leg&quot; at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C. in the United States on 26 March 2008. In front of 22,670 spectators, Anguilla lost the second leg 4–0, thereby losing to El Salvador by an aggregate score of 16–0.

===2014 World Cup qualification===

In the first round of the qualifiers for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, Anguilla were again drawn to play the Dominican Republic, as they had eight years previously. On 8 July 2011, they lost 2–0 at the Estadio Panamericano in San Cristobal, and losing 4–0 in the same Dominican Republic stadium just two days later. This put the Dominican Republic through to the second round with the same 6–0 aggregate scoreline as their previous encounter.

===2018 World Cup qualification===

In the first round of the qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup in Russia, Anguilla were drawn to play Nicaragua. On 23 March 2015, they lost the first leg 5–0 at the Estadio Nacional Dennis Martínez in Managua, Nicaragua and, on 29 March 2015, were eliminated at Ronald Webster Park in The Valley in Anguilla with a 3–0 loss, to send Nicaragua through to the second round by a score of 8–0 on aggregate.

===2022 World Cup qualification===

In the first round of the qualifiers for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Anguilla were drawn into group D with Dominica, Barbados, Dominican Republic, and Panama, whom they’d each play once. Their first match of the campaign was against Dominican Republic on 27 March 2021, at the DRV PNK Stadium in Fort Lauderdale. This game would make it the 3rd time the two teams faced in World Cup qualifying games. Anguilla lost 6–0, making this the same as the last two aggregate scores for the teams. On 31 March 2021, they faced Barbados at Estadio Olímpico Félix Sánchez in Santo Domingo, Anguilla lost to a late 1–0 goal by Emile Saimovici. Then, on 2 June 2021 they lost 3–0 to Dominica at Estadio Olímpico Félix Sánchez in Santo Domingo. And on 6 July, at Estadio Nacional de Panamá in Panama City, Anguilla suffered a massive 13–0 defeat. They ended of round 1 with 0 points, 0 goals, and 23 goals against.

===2026 World Cup qualification===
At the commencement of 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification, Anguilla advanced beyond the first round of qualifying for the first time in their history after beating Turks and Caicos Islands 1–1 on aggregate after penalties.

In the second round, they were drawn into Group F with Suriname, El Salvador, Puerto Rico and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

===Overall World Cup qualification record===
The pair of shutouts against Nicaragua in March 2015 extended Anguilla&#x27;s scoreless run in World Cup qualification to eight matches, encompassing three World Cups over an eleven-year period. The goals Anguilla scored in March 2000 against the Bahamas in each leg of their first World Cup qualifying appearance remain their only two goals, with 41 goals conceded, no wins, one draw and nine losses from their ten World Cup qualifying matches to date.

<text>Tudḫaliya is the name of several Hittite kings or royals. It is not clear how many kings bore that name, and numbering schemes vary from source to source.

*Tudḫaliya (sometimes called Tudḫaliya I) is deduced from his early placement in a later offering list as a hypothetical pre-Empire king who might have reigned in the early 17th century BC.
*[[Tudhaliya I|Tudḫaliya I]] (sometimes considered identical with the following, as Tudḫaliya I/II ), ruled in the mid-15th century BC, son of Kantuzzili.
*[[Tudhaliya II|Tudḫaliya II]] (sometimes considered identical with the preceding, as Tudḫaliya I/II or renumbered as Tudḫaliya I ), ruled at the start of the 14th century BC, father-in-law of Arnuwanda I.
*[[Tudhaliya III|Tudḫaliya III]] (sometimes renumbered as Tudḫaliya II ), in the early 14th century BC, the son of Arnuwanda I and predecessor of Šuppiluliuma I.
*[[Tudhaliya the Younger|Tudḫaliya the Younger]] (sometimes numbered as Tudḫaliya III ), in the mid-14th century BC, the son of Tudḫaliya III, he probably never reigned.
*[[Tudhaliya IV|Tudḫaliya IV]] (very rarely renumbered as Tudḫaliya III ), ruled around 1230 BC, the son of Ḫattušili III.
*Tudḫaliya V possibly ruled around 1180 BC, perhaps the son of Šuppiluliuma II.
*Tudḫaliya, Neo-Hittite king(s) of Carchemish, fl. 

== In the Bible ==
Some biblical scholars suggested that &quot;Tidal, king of Nations&quot; (Goyim), who is mentioned in the Book of Genesis 14 as having joined Chedorlaomer in attacking rebels in Canaan is based on one of the Tudhaliyas. In modern academia, Tidal is considered to be a literary figure, not a historical figure. The discussion about Tidal relates to the Battle of Siddim in the Bible; the exact geographical location of Tidal is disputed. &#x27;Tidal, king of Goyim&#x27;, may also be related to the island kingdoms in Mediterranean Sea.

<doc id="1198064" wikidata="Q3259261" url="?curid=1198064" title="Loop (band)">
<text>Loop are an English rock band, formed in 1986 by Robert Hampson in Croydon. The group topped the UK independent charts with their albums &quot;Fade Out&quot; (1989) and &quot;A Gilded Eternity&quot; (1990). Their dissonant &quot;trance-rock&quot; sound drew on the work of artists like the Stooges and Can, and helped to resurrect the concept of space rock in the late 1980s.

The group split in 1991, with Hampson going on to form the experimental project Main with guitarist Scott Dawson, and Mackay and Wills forming The Hair and Skin Trading Company. In 2013, the 1989–90 line-up of Hampson, Dawson, John Wills, and Neil Mackay briefly reformed for a series of gigs, and the following year Hampson unveiled a new line-up of the band with himself as the sole original member.

==Career==
Loop were formed in 1986 by Robert Hampson (vocals, guitar), with his then-girlfriend Becky Stewart on drums. Stewart was later replaced by John Wills (The Servants) and Glen Ray, with James Endeacott on guitar. Their sound was influenced by Krautrock and No Wave influences and relied heavily on three chord riffs. Initially releasing records on Jeff Barrett&#x27;s Head label, their first release was 1987&#x27;s &quot;16 Dreams&quot;, with debut album &quot;Heaven&#x27;s End&quot; following later that year. The band was then signed up by Chapter 22 Records.

Loop returned with a more polished sound with the &quot;Collision&quot; single in 1988. A second album &quot;Fade Out&quot; followed in 1989, reaching No. 51 on the UK album chart. Endeacott left the band in 1988, Scott Dowson joined the following year. They changed labels again to Beggars Banquet subsidiary Situation Two, releasing the &quot;Arc-Lite&quot; single in 1989 and the third and final studio album &quot;A Gilded Eternity&quot; in 1990. The band played at the Reading Festival in 1989.

The band split in 1991, with Hampson briefly joining Godflesh before forming Main with Dowson. Hampson&#x27;s Main project was discontinued in 2006 and while he now releases under his own name in 2010 he announced the return of Main, albeit as a collaborative project with other sound artists. Wills and Mackay went on to form The Hair and Skin Trading Company, which last released in 1995. Wills now performs and records as Pumajaw.

Loop recorded three Peel sessions for John Peel (11 August 1987, 14 June 1988 and 21 January 1990). A collection of these sessions entitled &quot;Wolf Flow&quot; was released in 1992. Following the split Loop&#x27;s official studio albums were re-released on their Reactor label. Some of the records featured cover versions of Suicide, The Pop Group and Can tracks. 

Hampson&#x27;s MySpace pages referred to friendly pressure to again re-release the Loop albums and these were eventually released in November 2008 on the Reactor label.

==Reformation==
Loop reformed for 2013 and 2014 activities, as presented by a statement from Robert Hampson. The line-up included the original &quot;Gilded Eternity&quot; era members Robert Hampson, John Wills, Neil Mackay and Scott Dowson. In November 2013, the band played their first comeback show and also co-curated the final holiday camp edition of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in Camber Sands, England. Wills, wishing to focus on his own musical projects, left the band and was replaced by Wayne Maskell. Loop then played in April 2014 as headliners of the Roadburn Festival, followed by more than 20 dates in the USA, headlining the opening night of Milwaukee Psych Fest 2014 at Cactus Club on 24 April. They concluded this comeback tour with the Primavera Sound festival in Barcelona in May 2014.

In November 2014, a new line-up emerged; still led by Hampson (vocal, guitar), the band performed with Hugo Morgan (bass) and Maskell (drums) from The Heads as well as Dan Boyd (guitar). They played at the Garage (London) and in the Netherlands. Their set featured a new song, &quot;Precession&quot;. They also announced they would be playing ATP Iceland 2015.

The band released a 4-song EP &quot;Array 1&quot; on ATP Recordings on 22 June 2015.

In June 2018, the band played as part of Robert Smith&#x27;s curation of the Meltdown Festival.

The first studio album in 31 years, &quot;Sonancy&quot;, was released on 25 March 2022. It was followed by a UK tour in May 2023.

==Musical style==
Their musical style has been described as space rock, psychedelic rock, drone rock, and noise rock.

<text>PU-Sarruma (PU-LUGAL-ma, mPU-&quot;Šàr-(rù)-ma&quot;, possibly representing &quot;Hišmi-Šarruma&quot;) is a conjectured pre-Empire king of the Hittites. The conjecture was forwarded by Emil Forrer and is not commonly accepted.

He would have reigned around 1600 BC (short chronology).

== Family ==
Hišmi-Šarruma would correspond to the grandfather of Hattusili I and the father-in-law of Labarna I and true father of Papahdilmah, mentioned (but not by name) by Hattusili. Hišmi-Šarruma was also a father of Tawannanna.

Virtually nothing is known of PU-Šarruma&#x27;s life, who is a very shadowy figure. PU-Šarruma&#x27;s sons had turned against their father, so that, while he was in the city of Šanahwitta, he named his son-in-law Labarna as his successor. However, Papahdilmah still had support among the king&#x27;s servants and chief officers.

<text>The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust is a specialist mental health trust based in north London. The Trust specialises in talking therapies. The education and training department caters for 2,000 students a year from the United Kingdom and abroad. The Trust is based at the Tavistock Centre in Swiss Cottage. The founding organisation was the Tavistock Institute of Medical Psychology founded in 1920 by Hugh Crichton-Miller.

The Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust was formed in 1994, when the Tavistock Clinic merged with the neighbouring Portman Clinic in Fitzjohns Avenue. The Portman specialises in areas of forensic psychiatry, including the treatment of addictive, sociopathic and criminal behaviours and tendencies.

It has developed as a centre for psychoanalysis within the NHS since being included at its founding in 1948. 

The Trust and predecessor organisations have been influential beyond medicine, including in the British Army, management consultancy, prison and probation services.

==Early history==
It owes its name to the fact that its original location was in Tavistock Square in central London. When it moved later to larger premises, it took its name with it.
Although Hugh Crichton-Miller was a psychiatrist who developed psychological treatments for shell-shocked soldiers during and after the First World War, clinical services were always destined for both children and adults. The clinic&#x27;s first patient was a child. From its foundation it was also clear that to offer free treatment to all who need it meant that the Tavistock Clinic needed to generate income by providing training to clinical professionals who could eventually help people across the UK and beyond. The clinical staff were also researchers. These principles remain influential to this day.
Following its foundation the Tavistock Clinic developed a focus on preventive psychiatry, expertise in group relations – including army officer selection – social psychiatry, and action research. There was an openness to different streams of research and thought as, for instance, the famous series of lectures given by the Swiss psychiatrist and one time collaborator of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, which were attended by doctors, churchmen and members of the public, including H. G. Wells and Samuel Beckett.

Its staff, who were still mainly unpaid honorary psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers, were interested in researching and consulting to leadership within the armed forces. The staff also offered treatment to members of the civilian population who might be traumatised by the prospect of a further world war, which could bring bombing of cities, evacuation of children and the shocks of loss and bereavement.

==Post-war history==
After the Second World War, the Tavistock Clinic benefited from the Northfield Hospital experience and from the arrival of talented professionals from Europe, many fleeing Nazi persecution. In 1948 it became a leading clinic within the newly created National Health Service. At this point its education and training services were managed separately by the Tavistock Institute for Medical Psychology, which was also the umbrella for the Tavistock Institute, involved in social action research and thinking about group relations and organisational dynamics, and for work with marital couples. The clinic was managed on a democratic model by a professional committee and developed further its distinct focus on multi-disciplinary and community-centred work. At the Clinic&#x27;s centenary in 2020 many post-war Tavistock staff contributed personal chapters in &quot;The Tavistock Century&quot; (edited by Margot Waddell and Sebastian Kraemer, Phoenix Publishing House https://firingthemind.com/product/9781912691715/)

===Children and young people===
New developments in child and adolescent mental health were particularly fruitful in the immediate post-war period. In 1948 the creation of the children&#x27;s department supported the development of training in child and adolescent psychotherapy. Dr John Bowlby supported this new training and naturalistic infant observation. He also developed Attachment Theory. Husband and wife clinicians James Robertson and Joyce Robertson showed in their film work the impact of &quot;separation&quot; in temporary substitute care on young children for example, when their parent was admitted to hospital. The Australian Hazel Harrison was teacher-in-charge from 1954 to 1956 where she worked with Bowlby. They looked in detail at English pre-school education.

The Tavistock Clinic opened its &quot;Adolescent Department&quot; in 1959, recognising the distinctive developmental needs and difficulties of younger and older adolescents. In 1967 it absorbed the &quot;London Child Guidance Clinic&quot;, founded in 1929.

In 1989 the Tavistock established the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), a highly specialised clinic for young people presenting with difficulties with their gender identity.
In July 2022, following a critical independent review from Hilary Cass, it was announced that this service would be discontinued and replaced with regional clinics providing a more &quot;holistic&quot; approach.

===Training in education===
By the 1960s The Tavistock Clinic was also providing both 1-year and 4-year professional training courses in educational psychology, the latter embracing a teacher training element through Leicester University School of Education. For a number of years the senior tutor and principal psychologist for these courses was Irene Caspari who did much to promote the concept and practice of Educational therapy. In the 1970s systemic psychotherapy became the Tavistock Clinic&#x27;s newest professional training. Applications of the clinical ideas and skills of its multidisciplinary clinicians are at the heart of its education and training, with academically validated programmes developing from the early 1990s with the University of East London, and later with the University of Essex and Middlesex University.

===Reflecting on the workplace===
Work discussion, supervised clinical practice and experiential group relations work are central to many trainings all of which aim to equip mental health workers with the emotional, organisational, and relational capacities to operate confidently in front line settings. A BBC TV series &#x27;Talking Cure: Jan&#x27; brought the work of the Clinic to a wider audience in 1999 and remains relevant today. Organisational consultancy by former CEO Anton Obholzer, featured in the TV series, and their edited collection, with Vega Roberts, &#x27;The Unconscious at Work: Individual and Organizational Stress in the Human Services&#x27;, remains one of the classic texts to emerge from the Tavistock Clinic.

===Public sphere===
The Tavistock&#x27;s tradition of social and political engagement has been renewed in recent years through its programme of Policy Seminars which model a dialogic, exploratory approach to policy analysis and debate with the social epidemiologist, Richard G. Wilkinson, the psychologist, Oliver James and the columnist, Polly Toynbee, among recent contributors. The series of &quot;Thinking Space&quot; events follows a similar model of participatory engagement around themes of diversity, racism, and sexual orientation.

The Tavistock Institute, which had been part of the Tavistock family, moved to its own premises in 1994. The Tavistock Centre for Couples Relationships, TCCR, formerly the Tavistock Institute of Marital Studies, was always a separate, charitably-funded organisation which left the Tavistock Centre for new premises in 2009.

==NHS Trust==
In 1994, the Tavistock Clinic joined with the Portman Clinic to become the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust. In 2006 the Trust acquired NHS Foundation Trust status and become the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust. It is an active member of UCL Partners, the Academic Health Service Centre located in North London.

Paul Burstow, a former Minister of State for Care and Support in the Cameron-Clegg coalition government, became Chair of the Trust in November 2015.

===Services===
The Trust provides clinical services for children and families, young people and adults. It also provides multi-disciplinary training and education. These programmes include core professional training, for example in psychiatry, psychology, social work and advanced psychotherapy training, as well as applied programmes for anyone working in the mental health or social care workforce.

Since 2010, the clinical work of the Trust has diversified, with new services, such as the Family Drug and Alcohol Court in Milton Keynes, and the City and Hackney community psychotherapy service.

It is the largest provider of transgender services in England, but funding for the service has not kept pace with demand. In August 2019, 5,717 people were on the waiting list for a first appointment, and average waiting time was about two years. The Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) at the Tavistock Centre has come under scrutiny due to reports that concerns over children&#x27;s welfare were &quot;shut down&quot;. The Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust have defended their practices. In July 2022, following criticism in the interim report by Hilary Cass, it was announced that this service would be discontinued, and replaced with regional clinics providing a more &quot;holistic&quot; approach. It was set to close at the end of March 2024.

In February 2023, BBC journalist Hannah Barnes&#x27; book, &quot;Time to Think: The Inside Story of the Collapse of the Tavistock&#x27;s Gender Service for Children&quot; was published. Barnes describes the premise of the book by saying, &quot;I wanted to write a definitive record of what happened [at GIDS] because there needs to be one.&quot;

===Performance===
The Tavistock was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. At that time, it had 449 full-time equivalent staff, and a sickness absence rate of 0.92%. 84% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 73% recommended it as a place to work.

The Trust borrowed £58 million in 2016, which it intends to repay by selling its current sites.

===Discrimination claim===
The Tavistock has been accused of forcing racist ideology on students, with lectures such as &quot;Whiteness - A Problem of Our Time&quot;, and in 2022 a claim against the Trust for discrimination on the basis of race and religion was commenced.

==Notable contributors to the clinic==

Over the years many hundreds of staff members, at all levels, have contributed to the work of this institution. This list is merely representative of some of the lasting contributors to the different fields encompassed by the Clinic.

==The Scottish Institute of Human Relations==

In line with Hugh Crichton-Miller&#x27;s original vision for clinics to be set up in communities across the country, his dream was not realised in his &#x27;native&#x27; Scotland for another 50 years. However, with Jock Sutherland&#x27;s return to Edinburgh in 1968, he became the catalyst for the formation of an organisation modelled on the London centre, albeit on a smaller scale. The Scottish Institute of Human Relations (SIHR), now defunct, was constituted as a charitable educational institution in Edinburgh in the early 1970s. Eventually a branch was opened in Glasgow. The &#x27;MacTavi&#x27;, as it was sometimes fondly called, worked closely with the National Health Service in Scotland and provided psychoanalytic training and courses for professionals in the health and educational systems and beyond. It also guided adults and children into treatment for the forty years of its operation. SIHR was finally dissolved in 2013 and its centres closed down. Some of its functions were taken over by a number of other organisations, specifically psychoanalytic training has become the remit of the Scottish Association for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy (SAPP).

<text>Harshavardhana (Sanskrit: हर्षवर्धन; 4 June 590 – 647) was an emperor of Kannauj from April 606 until his death in 647. He was the king of Thanesar who had defeated the Alchon Huns, and the younger brother of Rajyavardhana, son of Prabhakaravardhana and last king of Thanesar. He was one of the greatest kings of the Kingdom of Kannauj, which under him expanded into a vast realm in northern India.

At the height of Harsha&#x27;s power, his realm covered much of northern and northwestern India, with the Narmada River as its southern boundary. He eventually made Kanyakubja (present-day Kannauj, Uttar Pradesh state) his imperial capital, and reigned till 647 CE. Harsha was defeated by the Emperor Pulakeshin II of the Chalukya dynasty in the Battle of Narmada, when he tried to expand his empire into the southern peninsula of India.

The peace and prosperity that prevailed made his court a centre of cosmopolitanism, attracting scholars, artists and religious visitors from far and wide. The Chinese traveller Xuanzang visited the imperial court of Harsha and wrote a very favourable account of him (as Shiladitya), praising his justice and generosity. His biography &quot;Harshacharita&quot; (&quot;The Life of Harsha&quot;) written by the Sanskrit poet Banabhatta, describes his association with Sthanesvara, besides mentioning a defensive wall, a moat and the palace with a two-storied &quot;Dhavalagriha&quot; (white mansion).

== Early years ==

Much of the information about Harsha&#x27;s youth comes from the account of Bāṇabhaṭṭa. Harsha was the second son of Prabhakarvardhana, king of Thanesar. After the downfall of the Gupta Empire in the middle of the 6th century, Northern India was split into several independent kingdoms. The northern and western regions of the Indian Subcontinent passed into the hands of a dozen or more feudatory states. Prabhakaravardhana, the monarch of Sthanvesvara, who belonged to the Vardhana family, extended his control over neighbouring states. Prabhakaravardhana was the first monarch of the Vardhana dynasty with his capital at Sthanvesvara. After Prabhakaravardhana&#x27;s died in 605, his eldest son, Rajyavardhana, ascended the throne. Harshavardhana was Rajyavardhana&#x27;s younger brother. This period of kings from the same line has been referred to as the Vardhana dynasty in many publications.

At the time of Hiuen Tsang&#x27;s visit, Kanyakubja was the imperial capital of Harshavardhana, the most powerful sovereign in Northern India.

K.P. Jaiswal in Imperial History of India, says that according to a 7-8th century Buddhist text, Mañjuśrī-mūla-kalpa, Harsha was born of King Vishnu (Vardhana) and his family was of Vaishya varna. This is supported by some more writers.

==Ascension==

Harsha&#x27;s sister Rajyashri had been married to the Maukhari monarch, Grahavarman. This king, some years later, had been defeated and killed by King Devagupta of Malwa and after his death Rajyashri had been captured and imprisoned by the victor. Harsha&#x27;s brother, Rajyavardhana, then the king at Sthanesvara, could not accept this affront to his sister and his family. So he marched against Devagupta and defeated him. However, Shashanka, the King of Gauda in Eastern Bengal, then entered Magadha as a friend of Rajyavardhana, but was in a secret alliance with the Malwa king. Accordingly, Shashanka treacherously murdered Rajyavardhana. In the meantime, Rajyashri escaped into the forests. On hearing about the murder of his brother, Harsha resolved at once to march against the treacherous King of Gauda, but this campaign remained inconclusive and beyond a point he turned back. Harsha ascended the throne at the age of 16. His first responsibility was to rescue his sister and to avenge the killings of his brother and brother-in-law. He rescued his sister when she was about to immolate herself.

==Reign==
As Northern India reverted to small republics and small monarchical states ruled by Gupta rulers after the fall of the prior Gupta Empire, Harsha united the small republics from Punjab to central India, and their representatives crowned him emperor at an assembly in April 606 giving him the title of Maharajadhiraja. Harsha established an empire that brought all of northern India under his rule. The peace and prosperity that prevailed made his court a centre of cosmopolitanism, attracting scholars, artists and religious visitors from far and wide. The Chinese traveller Xuanzang visited the imperial court of Harsha, and wrote a favourable account of him, praising his justice and generosity.

Pulakeshin II repelled an invasion led by Harsha on the banks of Narmada in the winter of 618–619. Pulakeshin then entered into a treaty with Harsha, with the Narmada River designated as the border between the Chalukya Empire and that of Harshavardhana.

Xuanzang describes the event thus:

: &quot;Shiladityaraja (i.e., Harsha), filled with confidence, marched at the head of his troops to contend with this prince (i.e., Pulakeshin); but he was unable to prevail upon or subjugate him&quot;.

In 648, Tang Chinese emperor Tang Taizong sent Wang Xuance to India in response to emperor Harsha having sent an ambassador to China. However once in India, he discovered that Harsha had died and the new king Aluonashun (supposedly Arunāsva) attacked Wang and his 30 mounted subordinates. This led to Wang Xuance escaping to Tibet and then mounting a joint expedition of over 7,000 Nepalese mounted infantry and 1,200 Tibetan infantry and attacking Indian state on June 16. The success of this attack won Xuance the prestigious title of the &quot;Grand Master for the Closing Court.&quot; He also secured a reported Buddhist relic for China. 2,000 prisoners were taken from Magadha by the Nepali and Tibetan forces under Wang. Tibetan and Chinese writings document describe Wang Xuance&#x27;s raid on India with Tibetan soldiers. Nepal had been subdued by the Tibetan King Songtsen. The Indian pretender was among the captives. The war happened in 649. Taizong&#x27;s grave had a statue of the Indian pretender. The pretender&#x27;s name was recorded in Chinese records as &quot;Na-fu-ti O-lo-na-shuen&quot; (Dinafudi is probably a reference to Tirabhukti).

Xuanzang mentions that Harsha waged wars to bring &quot;the Five Indias under allegiance&quot; in six years. Xuanzang uses the term &quot;Five Indias&quot; (or &quot;Five Indies&quot; in some translations) inconsistently, variously applying it to refer to Harsha&#x27;s territories in northern India or to the entire subcontinent, grouped around Central India in the four directions. Based on this statement, historians such as R.K. Mookerji and C.V. Vaidya have dated Harsha conquests to 606-612 CE. However, it is now known that Harsha engaged in wars and conquests for several more years. Moreover, whether Xuanzang used the term &quot;Five Indias&quot; to describe Harsha&#x27;s territory in a narrower or wider sense, his statement is hyperbole it cannot be used to make conclusions about Harsha&#x27;s actual territory. While Harsha was the most powerful emperor of northern India, he did not rule the entire northern India.

==Religion and Religious Policy==
Like many other ancient Indian rulers, Harsha was eclectic in his religious views and practices. His seals describe his ancestors as worshippers of the Hindu sun god, Surya, his elder brother as a Buddhist, and himself as a Shaivite Hindu. His land grant inscriptions describe him as &quot;Parama-maheshvara&quot; (supreme devotee of Shiva). His court poet Bana also describes him as a Shaivite Hindu.

Harsha&#x27;s play &quot;Nāgānanda&quot; tells the story of the Bodhisattva Jīmūtavāhavana, and the invocatory verse at the beginning is dedicated to the Buddha, described in the act of vanquishing Māra (so much so that the two verses, together with a third, are also preserved separately in Tibetan translation as the *Mārajit-stotra). Shiva&#x27;s consort Gauri plays an important role in the play, and raises the hero to life using her divine power.

According to the Chinese Buddhist traveler Xuanzang, Harsha was a devout Buddhist. Xuanzang states that Harsha banned animal slaughter for food, and built monasteries at the places visited by Gautama Buddha. He erected several thousand 100-feet high stupas on the banks of the Ganges river, and built well-maintained hospices for travellers and poor people on highways across India. He organized an annual assembly of global scholars, and bestowed charitable alms on them. Every five years, he held a great assembly called Moksha. Xuanzang also describes a 21-day religious festival organized by Harsha in Kanyakubja; during this festival, Harsha and his subordinate kings performed daily rituals before a life-sized golden statue of the Buddha.

Since Harsha&#x27;s records describe him as a Shaivite Hindu, his conversion to Buddhism would have happened, if at all, in the later part of his life. Even Xuanzang states that Harsha patronised scholars of all religions, not just Buddhist monks. According to historians such as S. R. Goyal and S. V. Sohoni, Harsha was personally a Shaivite Hindu and his patronage of Buddhists misled Xuanzang to portray him as a Buddhist.

== Literary prowess ==
Harsha is widely believed to be the author of three Sanskrit plays Ratnavali, Nagananda and Priyadarsika. While some believe (e.g., ) that it was Dhāvaka, one of Harsha&#x27;s court poets, who wrote the plays as a paid commission, Wendy Doniger is &quot;persuaded, however, that king Harsha really wrote the plays ... himself.&quot;

==In popular culture==
A 1926 Indian silent film, &quot;Samrat Shiladitya&quot;, about the emperor was directed by Mohan Dayaram Bhavnani.

<text>Sheila Ison Wellstone (August 18, 1944 – October 25, 2002) was the wife of and advisor to United States Senator Paul Wellstone, with whom she died in a plane crash, and an advocate for various causes, particularly prevention of domestic violence.

Sheila Ison was born and raised in Kentucky, where (although the granddaughter of coal miners) she grew up in a middle class Southern Baptist family with two siblings. She was uprooted when as a high school junior her family moved to Washington, DC, where at the age of sixteen whe met and started dating her future husband Paul Wellstone. She attended the University of Kentucky but dropped out at the age of nineteen to marry Paul, then a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Paul Wellstone&#x27;s Jewish parents were not at first enthusiastic at the prospect, as Sheila was Christian and in fact her parents were members of a country club that had no Jewish members, but withdrew their objections presently.

After her husband finished his PhD in political science, he accepted an offer to teach at Carleton College in Northfield, MN, and the couple moved to Minnesota in 1969. The couple had three children, David, Mark, and Marcia. While in Minnesota, Wellstone worked as a librarian at Northfield High School. She left that position upon her husband&#x27;s successful campaign to become a U.S. Senator in 1990. She became an advocate for human rights, the environment, and peace. Wellstone focused much of her work on domestic violence, assisting survivors and pursuing policies to support its prevention. In late 2000, she was listed in one news story as a possible candidate for U.S. Senate or Governor of Minnesota in 2002, but she did not run.

While campaigning with her husband in his 2002 re-election campaign, she died in a plane crash near Eveleth, Minnesota, along with her husband and daughter Marcia. The Sheila Wellstone Institute continues her commitment to building power and visibility to ensure that ending violence against women and children is a national priority.

<text>Jonathan Joseph &quot;Candy&quot; Candido (December 25, 1913 – May 19, 1999) was an American radio performer and voice actor. He was best remembered for his famous line &quot;I&#x27;m feeling mighty low&quot;. Candido was known for providing many animal vocalizations.

==Early and personal life==
Born as Jonathan Candido on Christmas Day in 1913 in New Orleans, Louisiana, Candido, was a bassist and vocalist in Ted Fio Rito&#x27;s big band, and they can be seen in a Soundie, &quot;Ma, He&#x27;s Making Eyes at Me&quot;. He was a childhood friend of Louis Prima, becoming part of his band in 1924. In 1933, he married Anita Bivona.

== Career ==

=== Radio ===
Candido&#x27;s distinctive, four-octave speaking voice became familiar to radio listeners and moviegoers. Speaking his lines in his normal tenor, he would suddenly adopt a high, squeaky soprano and just as suddenly plunge into a gruff bass. His weekly repetition of &quot;I&#x27;m feelin&#x27; miiiighty low&quot; on Jimmy Durante&#x27;s radio show made it a national catchphrase. The running gag became so familiar that he recorded a song of the same title with Durante. The line can be heard in the 1950 Bugs Bunny cartoon &quot;Homeless Hare&quot;, although it was not spoken there by Candido.

=== Voices ===
Candido provided the voice of an angry apple tree in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939), and provided the voice of a skeleton in &quot;Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion&quot;, and he later teamed with Bud Abbott during Abbott&#x27;s attempted comeback in 1960. He was the voice of the bear in the &quot;Gentle Ben&quot; TV series, and he worked as a voice actor on animated films, notably for Walt Disney, where he portrayed the voice of the Indian Chief in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1953), one of Maleficent&#x27;s goons in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; (1959), the Captain of the Guard the crocodile in &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (1973), and the deep voiced prisoner in the Haunted Mansion attraction. Other animated films with Candido voices include Chuck Jones&#x27; adaptation of &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; (1970), and the Ralph Bakshi movies &quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot;. His final and personal favorite role was as Fidget the peg-legged bat in &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot; (1986).

=== Films ===
His various credited and uncredited roles as an actor, bassist and vocalist in live-action films include &quot;Sadie McKee&quot; (1934), &quot;Roberta&quot; (1935), &quot;Only Angels Have Wings&quot; (1939), &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; as the belligerent apple tree (1939), &quot;Rhythm Parade&quot; (1942), &quot;Campus Rhythm&quot; (1943), &quot;Sarge Goes to College&quot; (1947), &quot;Smart Politics&quot; (1948), and &quot;The Great Rupert&quot; (1950).

=== Recording ===
Candido recorded a few children&#x27;s 78 RPM records for Capitol Records:
* CAS-3105 - Side One &quot;I&#x27;m Popeye the Sailor Man&quot;, Side Two &quot;The Little White Duck&quot; (1952)
* CAS-3156 - Side One &quot;You&#x27;re Nothin&#x27; But a Nothin&#x27;&quot;, Side Two &quot;Barnacle Bill the Sailor&quot; (1953)

==Death==
Candido died from natural causes in his sleep at the age of 85 on May 19, 1999, in his home in Burbank, California. He was survived by his wife Anita, four children, eight grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren, and two great-great-grandchildren. He was interred in San Fernando Mission Cemetery.

<doc id="1198085" wikidata="Q299472" url="?curid=1198085" title="Ḫattušili I">
<text>Hattusili I (&quot;Ḫattušili&quot; I) was a king of the Hittite Old Kingdom. He reigned ca. 1650–1620 BC (middle chronology), or ca. 1640–1610 BC (low middle chronology).

== Family ==
Ḫattušili was possibly a nephew of his predecessor Labarna&#x27;s wife, Tawananna (the title was apparently used as a given name). Tawananna was a daughter of PU-Sarruma (Hišmi-Sarruma), and one brother is known, Papahdilmah, who fought with Labarna for the throne and lost. Papahdilmah could possibly be the father of Ḫattušili, but another brother of Tawananna could have been as well, due to lack of evidence. Ḫattušili&#x27;s wife was named Kadduši and his grandson was Muršili I, who succeeded him, having been chosen as heir instead of Ḫattušili&#x27;s nephew. 

==Reign==
Excavations in Zincirli Höyük, Southern Turkey, suggest that a complex there was destroyed in the mid to late 17th century BC, possibly by Hattusili I in a military campaign, which could confirm the middle chronology dating for his reign. This destruction was recently radiocarbon-dated to sometime between 1632 and 1610 BC. This event could have been part of Ḫattušili&#x27;s campaign against Zalpa in order to disrupt an exchange network connected to Aleppo that previously linked the Euphrates, North Syria, and Central Anatolia. Aslihan K. Yener dates destruction of Level VII Palace at nearby Alalakh, located around 100 km southeast of Tilmen Höyük, in the second year of Hattusili&#x27;s reign, 1628 BC.

He used the title of Labarna at the beginning of his reign. It is uncertain whether he is the second king so identified, making him Labarna II, or whether he is identical to Labarna I, who is treated as his predecessor in Hittite chronologies.

During his reign, he moved the capital from Neša (Kaneš, near modern Kültepe) to Ḫattuša (near modern Boğazkale), taking the throne name of &quot;Ḫattušili&quot; to mark the occasion.

He is the earliest Hittite ruler for whom contemporary records have been found. In addition to &quot;King of Ḫattuša&quot;, he took the title &quot;Man of Kuššara&quot;, a reference to the prehistoric capital and home of the Hittites, before they had occupied Neša.

==Annals of Ḫattušili I==

A cuneiform tablet found in 1957 written in both the Hittite and the Akkadian language, known as Annals of Hattusili I, provides details of five years of his reign, and is considered by Trevor R. Bryce as a copy, after the lifetime of this king, written in 13th century BCE.
In it, he claims to have extended the Hittite domain to the sea. In the first year of campaign he reached the cities of Sanahuitta and Zalpa, he failed to conquer the former but sacked the later. And in the second year, he claimed to have subdued Alalakh and other cities in Syria, located west of Euphrates and north of Carchemish, which were allied to Yamhad kingdom. In the third year, he campaigned against Arzawa in western Anatolia, as the Annals only say he: &quot;went to the land of Arzawa and took away its cattle and sheep.&quot; In the fourth year, he finally captured Sanahuitta after five months of siege. In the fifth year, the last of his campaigns, the Annals recorded a long list of conquered cities and lands when he crossed the Euphrates, claiming that no one did it before but king Sargon of Akkad, who crossed the river in the opposite direction.

==Last days==

The end of his reign is of historical importance because of his Succession Proclamation. This document, written in first person, tells of Ḫattušili coming back wounded from his last military campaign. On his deathbed he is enraged by the attitude of his heir and how he is conspiring with his mother and cousins. Ḫattušili then explains that for these reasons Mursili, his grandson, will be the next king instead, and urges the army and public servants to obey him. 

The arguments are in a tablet, classified as CTH 6, also known as the &quot;Testament of Hattusili I,&quot; in which he rejects his nephew as his successor, and designates his grandson Muršili I to occupy the throne. This Testament as well as the Annals survived only as a late 13th century BCE copy.

This apparently worked since Muršili indeed became king and continued Ḫattušili&#x27;s military campaigns, finally conquering Aleppo and sacking Babylon.

<text>David Parker is head of climate monitoring at the Hadley Centre, Exeter, England.

He has published extensively on the land and marine temperature record and its consistency. In 2002, he was an organiser of a &quot;Workshop on Advances in the Use of Historical Marine Climate Data&quot;.

In 2004, he has published a paper in Nature, showing that the urban heat island effect has not affected the historical temperature record. In this article, Parker shares his observations of the minimum temperature over 24 hours worldwide since 1950 that were expressed as anomalies. Also it includes his reasoning to why urbanization has not systematically exaggerated the observed global warming trends in minimum temperature. He further goes on to mention how the criterion for “calm” was changed while the global trend for minimum temperature remained unchanged. From his analysis he finds that windy and calm nights warmed at the same rate. Both the windy and calm increased at a rate of (0.16 + 0.03 C). He compares his small sample of 26 stations in North America and Siberia with global trends from 1950 to 1953, covering over 5,000 stations. Estimates of recent global warming, supported by Parker’s analysis shows that urban warming has not introduced significant biases. “The reality and magnitude of global-scale warming is supported by the near-equality of temperature trends on windy nights with trends based on all data.” (Parker) This paper has been commented on by Roger Pielke, Sr., et al.

<text>The Duchy of Brunswick () was a historical German state that ceased to exist in 1918. Its capital was the city of Brunswick (). It was established as the successor state of the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. In the course of the 19th-century history of Germany, the duchy was part of the German Confederation, the North German Confederation and from 1871 the German Empire. It was disestablished after the end of World War I, its territory incorporated into the Weimar Republic as the Free State of Brunswick.

==History==

===Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel===
The title &quot;Duke of Brunswick and Lüneburg&quot; () was held, from 1235 on, by various members of the Welf (Guelph) family who ruled several small territories in northwest Germany. These holdings did not have all of the formal characteristics of a modern unitary state, being neither compact nor indivisible. When several sons of a duke competed for power, the lands often became divided between them; when a branch of the family lost power or became extinct, the lands were reallocated among surviving members of the family; different dukes might also exchange territories. The unifying element of all these territories was that they were ruled by male-line descendants of Duke Otto I (ruled 1235–1252).

After several early divisions, Brunswick-Lüneburg re-unified under Duke Magnus II (d. 1373). Following his death, his three sons jointly ruled the duchy. After the murder of their brother Frederick I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, brothers Bernard and Henry redivided the land, Henry receiving the territory of Wolfenbüttel.

From 1432 forward the Principality of Wolfenbuettel became the capital of the Duchy of Brunswick and Luneburg. It is widely understood and confirmed that from the year 1546 forward there became two dynastic lines of the house of Este-Guelph Brunswick: &quot;the senior&quot;, from Brunswick-Wolfenbuettel, and one called &quot;the younger branch&quot; from Calenburg-Hanover.
The ruling monarchs of Brunswick and Lunenburg continued to govern the greater Duchy from the Wolfenbuettel principality till 1754, when temporarily the Brunswick principality was used as a capital to mitigate while the Brunswick wished to become an Imperial free city.

===Duchy of Brunswick===
====Formal sovereignty confirmed====
The territory of Wolfenbüttel was recognized as a sovereign state by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. It had been a portion of the medieval Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg. The northern principality known as Lüneburg remained fragmented and largely under control of Wolfenbuettel. However, in 1702, the Prince of Calenberg and Celle averted the extinction of the line through a marriage with the low-born Eleonore d&#x27;Esmier d&#x27;Olbreuse, who from 1705 passed to her successors a united Lüneburg to said princes, later i.e. the Elector of Hanover. The princes of Wolfenbüttel maintained their supremacy over the subject vassal state of Lüneburg, but recognized its semi-sovereignty. 

The Wolfenbüttel principality had from 1807 to 1813 been held as part of the Kingdom of Westphalia. The Congress turned it into an independent country as the Duchy of Brunswick. These acts were protested by the de facto and de jure Duke Charles II in annual protests until his death. His grandson Ulric de Civry (brother of Frédéric de Civry) continued in full ducal regalia and claim maintaining these protests (against Prussia, Hanover, and even some parts of the Council of Vienna) until his assassination in 1935 at Geneva Switzerland.

====Charles II (1815–1830)====
The underage Duke Charles, the eldest son of Duke Frederick William (who had been killed in action), was put under the guardianship of George IV, the Prince Regent of the United Kingdom and Hanover.

First, the young duke had a dispute over the date of his majority. Then, in 1827, Charles declared some of the laws made during his minority invalid, which caused conflicts. After the German Confederation intervened, Charles was forced to accept those laws. His administration was considered corrupt and misguided.

In the aftermath of the July Revolution in 1830, Charles had to leave the country. His absolutist governing style had alienated the nobility and bourgeoisie, while the lower classes were disaffected by the bad economic situation. During the night of 7–8 September 1830, the ducal palace in Braunschweig was stormed by an angry mob, set on fire and destroyed completely. Charles fled the country, but without abdicating.

====William VIII (1830–1884)====
When Charles&#x27; brother William VIII arrived in Brunswick on 10 September, he was received joyfully by the people. William originally considered himself only his brother&#x27;s regent, but after a year declared himself ruling duke. Charles made several desperate attempts, unsuccessfully, to depose him.

William left most government business to his ministers, and spent most of his time outside of his state at his possessions in Oels. After the revolution of 1830, liberal reforms were made and a new constitution was adopted on 12 October 1832. While the number of voters was limited by a system of census suffrage to about 40% of Brunswick&#x27;s male population, the parliament of Brunswick was granted more rights than in most other German states at the time and the duke&#x27;s budget and powers were significantly limited.

While William joined the Prussian-led North German Confederation in 1866, his relationship to Prussia was strained, since Prussia refused to recognize Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover, his nearest male-line relative, as his heir.

While the Kingdom of Hanover was annexed by Prussia in 1866, the Duchy of Brunswick remained sovereign and independent. It joined first the North German Confederation and in 1871 the German Empire.

In the 1870s, it became obvious that the then-senior branch of the ruling House of Welf would die with Duke William. By house law, a member of the House of Hanover would have ascended the ducal throne. However, the Hanoverians still refused to accept the Prussian annexation of their kingdom. As a result, Prussia was unwilling to let George V of Hanover or his son, Ernest Augustus, succeed to Brunswick. Berlin would only agree to the Hanoverians becoming dukes of Brunswick under severe conditions, including swearing allegiance to the German constitution and renouncing all claim to Hanover.

By a law of 1879, the Duchy of Brunswick established a temporary council of regency to take over at the duke&#x27;s death. If Ernest Augustus–who had been created the Duke of Cumberland in the British peerage–were unable to succeed, the council would also be empowered to appoint a regent. With William&#x27;s death in 1884, the Wolfenbüttel line came to an end. The Duke of Cumberland then proclaimed himself Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick. However, since he still claimed to be the rightful King of Hanover, the Federal Council ruled that he would violate the peace of the German Empire if he succeeded to Brunswick. Lengthy negotiations ensued, but were never resolved.

====Regency (1884–1913)====
Two regents were appointed: first, Prince Albert of Prussia until his death in 1906, and then Duke John Albert of Mecklenburg.

====Ernest Augustus (1913–1918)====

The need for a regent ended in 1913. The Duke of Cumberland&#x27;s eldest son having died in 1912, the elderly duke renounced Brunswick in favor of his youngest son, Ernest Augustus, who married Emperor Wilhelm II&#x27;s daughter, swore allegiance to the German Empire and renounced all claims to Hanover. Accordingly, he was allowed to ascend the throne of the duchy in November 1913.

In the midst of the German revolutions of 1918, the duke had to abdicate, and the Free State of Brunswick was founded as a member state of the Weimar Republic.

==Geography==
The Duchy of Brunswick consisted of several non-connected parts - three larger and seven smaller ones. The biggest and most populous of those was the area surrounding the cities of Braunschweig, Wolfenbüttel and Helmstedt as well as the Elm, which extended from the river Aller in the north to the Harz mountains in the south. The western part with the town of Holzminden extended from the river Weser in the east to the Harz Foreland in the west. The southern part with the town of Blankenburg was located in the Harz mountains. The Duchy&#x27;s smaller exclaves were Thedinghausen near Bremen, Harzburg, Calvörde, Bodenburg and Östrum, Ostharingen near Goslar, Ölsburg near Peine and a small woodland near the Fallstein. The Duchy of Brunswick was almost entirely surrounded by the Prussian Provinces of Hanover and Saxony, in the south-east it also bordered the Duchy of Anhalt and in the west the Principality of Waldeck-Pyrmont and the Prussian Province of Westphalia.

The western part of the Duchy lay in the Weser Uplands, the central and southern parts in the northern Harz Foreland and the Harz mountains. The northern part was located on the border between the North German Plain and the Central Uplands of Germany. The Duchy&#x27;s highest peak was the Wurmberg at 971 metres (3,186 ft). The major rivers that ran through Brunswick were the Weser, Aller, Leine, Oker, Bode and Innerste.

===Main parts and exclaves of Brunswick by size===
==Districts==
The Duchy of Brunswick was subdivided into six districts (&quot;Kreise&quot;) in 1833. The districts were further subdivided into cities or towns (&quot;Städte&quot;) and more rural townships (&quot;Ämter&quot;).

==Demographics==

In 1910, the Duchy of Brunswick had a population of 494,339 people.

According to the 1885 census, 84.90% (316,208 people) of the Duchy&#x27;s inhabitants held citizenship of Brunswick, while 54,738 people (14.70%) were citizens of other German states. 1506 people (0.40%) were foreign nationals, among those 785 came from Austria-Hungary, 133 from the United Kingdom, 112 from the United States, 91 from Italy, 83 from the Russian Empire, and 81 from Switzerland.

===Religion===

In 1905, 450,760 people or 92.5% of the population adhered to the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Brunswick. 26,504 (5.5%) people were Catholic, 4720 (0.97%) adhered to Reformed churches. 1815 (0.39%) people were of Jewish faith.

===Largest municipalities by population===
==Economy==

In 1905, out of 1,000 residents 455 were working in the industrial sector, mining or construction, 289 were working in agriculture and forestry, 121 in commerce, 57.3 were employed in the civil service and 70 were working in miscellaneous other professions.

==Transport==

The Duchy of Brunswick State Railway was the first state railway in Germany. The first section of its Brunswick–Bad Harzburg railway line connecting Braunschweig and Wolfenbüttel opened on 1 December 1838, as the first railway line in Northern Germany. In the 1870s, the Duchy of Brunswick State Railway merged with the Royal Prussian State Railways. Some other railways of secondary importance were operated by the Brunswick State Railway Company, founded in 1884.

==Sports==

In 1847, MTV Braunschweig was founded as the first sports club in Brunswick.

Brunswick also played a pioneering role in the history of association football in Germany: Konrad Koch, a school teacher from Braunschweig, was the first to write down a German version of the rules of football, and, together with August Hermann, also arguably organized the first football match in Germany between pupils from his school &quot;Martino-Katharineum&quot; in 1874.

The Duchy of Brunswick Football Association (German: &quot;Fußballbund für das Herzogtum Braunschweig&quot;) was founded in May 1904. Eintracht Braunschweig, founded in 1895, quickly became one of the leading football clubs in Northern Germany. To this day, the team plays in the colours blue and yellow, derived from the flag of Brunswick.

==Coat of arms==

The Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg was formed out of the possessions of senior branch of the House of Brunswick. The House of Brunswick originated from the Italian House of Este. This family acquired the inheritance of the Guelph family by marriage — around the year 1000 — of Azzo II with Kunigunde of Altdorf, daughter of Welf II. Again important possessions were gained in (Lower) Saxony by the marriage of Henry the Black to Wulfhilde of Saxony (d 1126), daughter of the last member of the House of Billung, who had been Dukes of Saxony for five generations. They were made Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg in 1235. In 1269 the house of Brunswick-Lüneburg divided into the branches of Lüneburg and Brunswick (later Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, the later Duchy of Brunswick). In 1432 the Principality of Calenberg, the later Electorate of Hanover, split from Brunswick(-Wolfenbüttel), and in 1705 acquired the territory of Lüneburg.

Both branches used in their arms the two lions of Brunswick, the blue lion of Lüneburg and the white steed of Saxony. The use of the lion as a heraldic animal in the House of Guelph goes back to Henry the Lion in the 12th century at least. However, Henry used only a single lion as his symbol. Later accounts by medieval writers that the two golden lions of Brunswick were granted to Henry by the English king, his father-in-law, are deemed fictional by modern historians. It was Henry&#x27;s sons from his marriage with Matilda of England, the future Holy Roman Emperor Otto IV and Henry V, Count Palatine of the Rhine, who adapted the Royal Arms of England to display their royal lineage. While Otto&#x27;s coat of arms showed the three golden lions of England, Henry used only two. The two lions of Henry V then went on to become the symbol of the House of Guelph. The blue lion of Lüneburg was adopted by John I of Lüneburg, who based his coat of arms on the coat of arms of Denmark to emphasise his kinship with the Danish kings. The dukes of Brunswick later added the blue lion to their arms as well, to show their own claim to the territory of Lüneburg.

The white steed was said to be the emblem of the eighth century Saxon duke Widukind, who according to legend rode a black horse before his baptism and a white horse afterwards. In truth, the use of the horse as a symbol for Saxony only goes back to the 14th century, when the House of Guelph, after the ducal title of Saxony had fallen to the House of Ascania, adopted the fictional &quot;ancient&quot; symbol to represent themselves as the true descendants of the old Saxon dukes. Due to the legend associated with it, the white horse became a very popular symbol among the population of Brunswick, even more so than the lions.

Over time, the arms of smaller territories that had been acquired by the Dukes of Brunswick were added to the coat of arms. The coat of arms of the Duchy of Brunswick eventually consisted of a crown and shield, supported by two wild men, on which the blue lion of Lüneburg, the two golden lions of Brunswick, the Saxon steed and the arms of various counties were displayed. The lesser coat of arms of the Duchy of Brunswick showed a crowned shield with the white horse on a red background. The Saxon steed was dropped from the coat of arms during the reign of William VIII. The greater coat of arms of the Duchy of Brunswick, as adopted in 1834, shows a shield with a ducal crown on top and surrounded by the insignia of the Order of Henry the Lion. Displayed on the shield are, from left to right, the blue lion of Lüneburg, the two lions of Brunswick, and the arms of the Counts of Eberstein, Homburg, Diepholz (upper half), Lauterberg, Hoya and Bruchhausen, Diepholz (lower half), Honstein, Regenstein, Klettenberg and Blankenburg. The new lesser coat of arms introduced under William VIII was a return to the arms of Brunswick-Lüneburg, displayed on a crowned shield supported by two lions. The Latin inscriptions read &quot;IMMOTA FIDES&quot; (&quot;unswerving faithfulness&quot;) and &quot;NEC ASPERA TERRENT&quot; (&quot;they are not afraid of difficulties&quot;).

The flag of the Duchy of Brunswick was blue over yellow, and is remarkably similar to the flag of Ukraine. The standard of the dukes of Brunswick given by Siebmachers Wappenbuch, Nuremberg 1878, shows the white horse on a red cloth - this, however, is today assumed to have been in error. The state flag introduced in 1912 was blue over yellow, with a crowned shield with the white horse on a red background in the center.

<text>The Aruba national football team (Dutch: Arubaans voetbalelftal; Papiamento: Seleccion Arubano di futbol) is the national team of Aruba. It was founded in 1932 and is affiliated with the Caribbean Football Union (CFU), CONCACAF and FIFA (since 1988) and is controlled by the Arubaanse Voetbal Bond.

The team has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup or the CONCACAF Gold Cup.

==History==

Between 1924 and 1933, Aruba only played against Curaçao, although these matches are not considered official. In the 1950s these matches were used to select the best players for the Netherlands Antilles team. Aruban players like Jani Brokke played for the Netherlands Antilles at the 1952 Olympic Games. Under the flag of the Curaçao Football Association (C.V.B.), they won gold with the Netherlands Antilles team at the 1950 Central American and Caribbean Games and participated in the 1953 CCCF Championship.

In the 1950s the A.V.B. organised friendly matches and mini tournaments on the island. Examples are the 1952 match between Aruba and football club Botafogo (3-1) and the 1953 series between Aruba, Surinam, British Guiana and professional club La Salle F.C. from Venezuela. Aruba participated in its first tournament at the 1955 CCCF Championship, where they finished in 5th place. In 1958, A.V.B. and C.V.B. merged into the Netherlands Antillean Football Union. Aruba took part in the Netherlands Antilles national football team until their secession in 1986.

Following its split from the Netherlands Antilles, the Aruba Football Federation was affiliated in 1988 with CONCACAF and FIFA. Aruba entered qualifying for the 1989 Caribbean Cup, and in its first group match it suffered the worst defeat in its history, at the hands of Trinidad and Tobago, which crushed them 11–0. They played their first World Cup qualifying match against the Dominican Republic as part of the 1998 World Cup qualifying. Aruba has participated in all the qualifying tournaments for the World Cup since, without being able to get past the first qualifying round.

Aruba has also yet to qualify for the Caribbean Cup. However, they showed some progress in the preliminary round of the 2014 Caribbean Cup by getting two wins against Turks and Caicos (1–0) and British Virgin Islands (7–0), the latter being the biggest victory in its history. These results allowed them to reach 120th place in the FIFA World Ranking for the month of June 2014, their best ranking to date. Following these victories, Aruba lost 2–0 against French Guiana and were eliminated.

Aruba began their 2018 World Cup qualification in the second round against Barbados, losing 2–0 at home and 1–0 away, however FIFA ruled that Barbados had fielded an ineligible player, giving Aruba a 3–0 second leg victory and advancing them to the third round. Despite that, in the next round they were defeated again, this time by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines who won 3–2 on aggregate. Aruba failed to progress in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers, finishing 4th in the first round.

<text>James Lileks is an American journalist, columnist, author, and blogger living in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He is the creator of The Gallery of Regrettable Foods website.

== Career ==

===Columnist===
Lileks began his writing career as a columnist for the &quot;Minnesota Daily&quot; while he was a student at the University of Minnesota. After college, he wrote for &quot;City Pages&quot;, a Twin Cities alternative tabloid. He served as a general columnist for &quot;City Pages&quot; until 1988, when he was hired as a columnist for the &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot;. This led to a columnist job with Newhouse News Service and thence &quot;The Washington Post&quot; for a period in the early 1990s. In the mid-1990s, Lileks returned to the Twin Cities for a job with the &quot;Star Tribune&quot;, retaining his Newhouse column until late 2006. The &quot;Star Tribune&quot; discontinued Lileks&#x27;s column in 2007, eventually naming him editor of the now defunct community website buzz.mn.

Lileks also writes a regular column (&quot;Athwart&quot;) for &quot;National Review&quot;.

Lileks is currently a columnist for the StarTribue (his column at StarTribune).

===Radio personality===
Lileks&#x27;s first foray into radio came in 1987, while he was a writer with &quot;City Pages&quot;. He became a regular guest on the Geoff Charles show, an afternoon talk show on KSTP. When Charles left the Twin Cities, Lileks filled the slot and served as an afternoon-drive host on KSTP for a time in the late 1980s. In the mid-1990s, after returning from Washington DC, Lileks reappeared on KSTP with a new program, &quot;The Diner&quot; – a show set in a fictional 1950s-era diner.
The show lasted several years on weekday evenings and then a few more as a weekend-evening program before leaving the air in the late 1990s. As of October 23, 2013, &quot;The Diner&quot; was revived on Ricochet.com.

In late 2006, &quot;The Diner&quot; was revived in podcast form. Selected original &quot;Diner&quot; programs and new original Diners are available on Lileks&#x27;s website. Lileks is also a weekly guest on the Hugh Hewitt show, Pajamas Media&#x27;s weekly &quot;PJM Political&quot; show on Sirius-XM Satellite Radio&#x27;s POTUS channel, and a frequent guest and guest host on the Northern Alliance Radio Network program.

Lileks has also been a monologist for the public affairs program &quot;Almanac&quot;, carried on Minnesota PBS television stations.

===Website===

Lileks&#x27;s blog, the &quot;Daily Bleat&quot;, began in 1997. The Bleat covers many topics in his personal life (including his daughter Natalie (referred to as &quot;Gnat&quot; until she became old enough to object) and the family dog, Scout), politics from a conservative viewpoint, and cultural points of interest ranging from art and architecture to movies and music (one perennial topic is the Minnesota State Fair). Lileks&#x27;s website also hosts a vast repository of vintage advertisements and other ephemera from the 1920s to the 1970s.

===Other work===
Lileks is a regular contributor to the social networking and blogging network Ricochet.com, and co-hosts the site&#x27;s flagship podcast with Rob Long and Peter Robinson.

== &quot;Star Tribune&quot; controversy and resolution==

On May 7, 2007, Lileks announced that his home paper, the &quot;Minneapolis Star Tribune&quot;, was ending his column in the interest of budget cuts and putting him on a straight local-news beat.

The move, which was forced by cuts in other parts of the &quot;Star Tribune&quot;″s newsroom, drew criticism from many, Mike Argento, president of the National Society of Newspaper Columnists, said in reaction to the news:

It&#x27;s just a reflection of the sad state of the newspaper industry. Many of the people running newspapers don&#x27;t have a vision. They&#x27;re concerned with dollars and cents, and the bottom line. They should look at the future, not just slash and burn.

On June 5, 2007, the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; changed course and announced Lileks would serve as editor of buzz.mn, a community website. Buzz.mn ceased publication of new content in July 2009.

<text>Piermaria Jorge Oddone (born March 26, 1944, in Arequipa, Peru) is a Peruvian-American particle physicist.

Oddone earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1965 and a PhD in physics from Princeton University in 1970.

From 1972, Oddone worked at the US Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. In 1987 he was appointed director of the Physics Division at Berkeley Lab, and later became the laboratory deputy director for scientific programs. In 1987, he proposed the idea of using an Asymmetric B-factory to study the violation of CP symmetry in the decay of B-mesons.

In the late seventies and early eighties, Oddone was a member of the team that developed the first Time Projection Chamber (TPC). This technology was subsequently used for many particle and nuclear physics experiments. He led the TPC collaboration from 1984 to 1987.

He was appointed director of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) and took up office on 1 July 2005.

Oddone received the 2005 Panofsky Prize in Experimental Particle Physics for the invention of the Asymmetric B-Factory to carry out precision measurements of CP violation in B-meson decays.

He was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1990 &quot;for significant research in elementary- particle physics and contributions to the development of apparatus as well as of the infrastructure required for future advances of the field&quot; 

In 2011 at an international symposium held in Vatican City, he gave a talk &quot;Achievements in Subnuclear Physics at Fermilab&quot;. He was chair of the International Committee for Future Accelerators, a working group of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics, from 2012 to 2013. In September 2012, Oddone announced he would retire on July 1, 2013, after 8 years serving as lab director.

<text>George Hearn (born June 18, 1934) is an American actor and bass-baritone singer, primarily in Broadway musical theatre. 

Some of his Broadway credits include Albin in &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;, the title role in &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;, Max von Mayerling in &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, John Dickinson in &quot;1776&quot;, Mr. Otto Frank in &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;, and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz in &quot;Wicked&quot;.

For his work, he won 2 Tony Awards for &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; and &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;. As well as being nominated for 3 others. He also was nominated for an Olivier Award for &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;.

==Early years==
Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Hearn studied philosophy at Southwestern at Memphis, now Rhodes College before he embarked on a career in the theater, training for the stage with actress turned acting coach Irene Dailey. Most of Hearn&#x27;s early performances were in traditional productions at the New York Shakespeare Festival and theaters at Lincoln Center.

==Career==
Hearn&#x27;s career began in 1963 when he played Sir Dinidan in a national tour of &quot;Camelot&quot; with Biff McGuire and Jeannie Carson, standing by for McGuire, who played King Arthur. He first garnered a notice as John Dickinson in the acclaimed 1969 musical &quot;1776&quot; and as Liv Ullmann&#x27;s leading man in the musical version of &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; (1979).

On March 4, 1980, he replaced Len Cariou in the title role of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; opposite Dorothy Loudon. Later in 1980 Hearn and the show&#x27;s original star, Angela Lansbury, headed the show&#x27;s touring company, then reprised their roles for a Showtime production of the musical, which won him an Emmy Award for his portrayal.

In 1983 Hearn created the role of Albin in the original Broadway production of &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot; written by Harvey Fierstein and Jerry Herman. Hearn originated the gay anthem &quot;I Am What I Am&quot;. He won the Tony Award, Drama Desk Award and Outer Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Best Actor in a Musical for his portrayal of Albin. Hearn also appeared in the West End production (which opened in May 1986).

In 1985, Hearn starred as Long John Silver in an Edmonton production of &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot;, a musical adaptation of &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. Despite its credentials, including composer Jule Styne, it never was staged again.

Hearn and Lansbury remained friends, and the actress invited him to guest star on several episodes of her CBS sleuth series &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; in the early 1990s.

He won a second Tony award for his role as Max Von Mayerling in the original Broadway production of &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot;, and was nominated again for playing Otto Frank in the 1997 revival of &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;.

On July 20, 2004, Hearn returned to Broadway for the first time in four years, starring as the Wizard in the Broadway musical &quot;Wicked&quot;, remaining until May 29, 2005. Hearn later returned to the musical for a limited two-week engagement from January 17 through February 1, 2006.

In 2008 he starred in a production of &quot;The Visit&quot; by John Kander and Fred Ebb alongside Chita Rivera at the Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia. &quot;The Visit&quot; opened to positive reviews on May 13, 2008, and closed June 22, 2008.

Hearn&#x27;s recordings include &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1994 Los Angeles Cast, and later the Broadway Cast Recording), &quot;Sweeney Todd Live at the New York Philharmonic&quot;, &quot;Mack &amp; Mabel&quot; (1988 London Concert Cast), &quot;I Remember Mama&quot; (1985 Studio Cast), &quot;Follies in Concert&quot; (1985 Live Performance), and &quot;A Stephen Sondheim Evening&quot; (1983 Concert Cast).

Hearn was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame on January 29, 2007.

==Personal life==
Hearn&#x27;s spouses include Susan Babel, Mary Harrell, with whom he had one son; Dixie Carter (1977–1979); girlfriend and Sweeney Todd co-star Betsy Joslyn (1979–1984); and current wife Leslie Simons. Hearn and Simons have two sons. He currently resides in Essex, New York.

<text>Jimmy Wayne Barber (born October 23, 1972) is an American country music singer and songwriter. He released his self-titled debut album in 2003 on the DreamWorks Records label. Four singles were released from it, including &quot;Stay Gone&quot; and &quot;I Love You This Much&quot;, which both reached Top Ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts. A second album, &quot;Do You Believe Me Now&quot;, was released in August 2008 via Big Machine Records subsidiary Valory Music Group, and its title track became his first Number One hit in late 2008. &quot;Sara Smile&quot; followed in 2009.

== Early life ==
Jimmy Wayne was born on October 23, 1972, in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, and grew up in Bessemer City. His biological father abandoned him, and he and his sister were raised in and out of foster homes or were left with other people when their mother would leave them or was in prison. She served four months in prison in 1985 when Wayne was 12. After entering a group home, Wayne ran away and lived with his mother for a brief time before living on the streets and with his sister, Patricia, for a short while. He was invited to move in with an elderly couple, Russell and Bea Costner, (just down the road from where his mother was living), after being hired to mow their lawn. After finishing high school and earning a degree in Criminal Justice, he worked as a guard at the Gaston Correctional Facility, where he worked as a corrections officer for four years before moving to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue his musical interests.

==Musical career==
In Nashville, Wayne worked as a songwriter for Acuff-Rose Music, collaborating with Dean Dillon, Sanger D. Shafer and others while practicing his guitar and songwriting skills. One of his first cuts as a songwriter was &quot;Put Your Hand in Mine,&quot; released by Tracy Byrd in late 1999 from the album &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;. By 2001, Wayne had signed to a recording contract with DreamWorks Records&#x27; Nashville division.

===&quot;Jimmy Wayne&quot;===
Wayne released his debut single, &quot;Stay Gone,&quot; in 2003. This song was inspired by his sister, Patricia, who explained her marital troubles to him by saying &quot;everything would be better if her husband would just stay gone,&quot; according to CMT. This song went on to peak at No. 3 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts that year. It was also the first release from his self-titled debut album, produced by Chris Lindsey and James Stroud. &quot;I Love You This Much,&quot; the next single, went on to peak at No. 6, followed by &quot;You Are&quot; and &quot;Paper Angels,&quot; both at No. 18. The album also included the song &quot;Blue and Brown,&quot; which Wayne wrote about a foster brother who ended up a prison inmate at the correctional facility Wayne worked. &quot;Paper Angels&quot;, written about the Salvation Army&#x27;s Angel Tree program, earned him a William Booth Award from the organization.

===Big Machine and Valory (2006–2009)===
After DreamWorks closed in 2005, Wayne was transferred to Big Machine Records. His first release for the label was &quot;That&#x27;s All I&#x27;ll Ever Need,&quot; which he co-wrote with Mark Nesler and Tony Martin. This song was slated to be the lead-off single to a second album with a projected release date of early 2007.

Wayne later moved to Big Machine&#x27;s sister label, Valory Music Group. His first single for Valory, &quot;Do You Believe Me Now,&quot; entered the country charts in April 2008 and became his third Top Ten in August 2008. A second studio album, titled &quot;Do You Believe Me Now&quot;, was released on August 26. For the week of September 13, 2008, the title track became his first and only Number One hit on the Hot Country Songs chart. &quot;I Will&quot; was released in October 2008 as the second single from &quot;Do You Believe Me Now&quot;, and it peaked at No. 18. The next single, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be That&quot;, debuted at No. 56 in May 2009, reaching a peak of No. 46.

===&quot;Sara Smile&quot; (2009–2010)===
In September 2009, Wayne released a cover version of Hall &amp; Oates&#x27; 1976 single &quot;Sara Smile&quot;, with backing vocals from the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s pop duo themselves. This cover is the lead-off single to his second album of the same name for Valory, released on November 23. The song has become Wayne&#x27;s seventh Top 40 country single, as well as Hall &amp; Oates&#x27; first Top 40 country single. The album&#x27;s second single is &quot;Just Knowing You Love Me,&quot; a duet with Whitney Duncan, which debuted and peaked at No. 59 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart.

Wayne joined Brad Paisley and Dierks Bentley on the American Saturday Night tour in mid-2009.

Wayne was dropped by Big Machine Records/Valory Music Company in May 2010 midway through his walk halfway across America to raise awareness for the 30,000 youth aging out of foster care every year in the U.S.

==Meet Me Halfway==
On January 1, 2010, Wayne set out on a walk from Nashville, Tennessee, to Phoenix, Arizona, to raise awareness to the plight of the 30,000 children who age out of foster care every year in America, into homelessness homeless youth aging out foster system. Called the &quot;Meet Me Halfway&quot; campaign, he walked a day, only taking days off the walk for scheduled concerts and to go to the California State Capitol to speak in favor of a bill that would increase the age kids age out of the foster system from 18 to 21.

He successfully arrived in Phoenix on August 1, 2010, after suffering a broken foot four days prior, having successfully walked 1,700 miles over seven months. Even after completing his walk, Wayne continues to advocate for foster children. He has been a spokesperson for CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates), a national network of volunteers who represent the best interests of abused and neglected children in the courtroom and other settings. and says his goal is to have the age that youth &quot;age out&quot; of foster care raised from 18 to 21 across all 50 states and to bring awareness to the cause of foster youth who are aging out of the system.

==Writing==
In 2012, he co-wrote the novel &quot;Paper Angels&quot;, a Christmas story about a child who receives help from the Salvation Army&#x27;s Angel Tree program and the man who picked his name. He wrote &quot;Walk to Beautiful: The Power of Love and a Homeless Kid Who Found the Way&quot; with Ken Abraham. The autobiography, published in 2014, details his life story which inspired the &quot;Meet Me Halfway&quot; campaign. In 2017, he wrote and published &quot;Ruby The Foster Dog&quot;, a children&#x27;s book, published by Broadstreet Kids in November 2017. The book chronicles Wayne&#x27;s adopting a dog during his walk halfway across America. The story is told from the dog&#x27;s perspective. Simultaneously, Wayne released &quot;Ruby Toons&quot;, a 13-song album of songs reflecting themes in Ruby The Foster Dog.

<doc id="1198154" wikidata="Q365548" url="?curid=1198154" title="Malawi national football team">
<text>The Malawi national football team () represents Malawi in association football and is controlled by the Football Association of Malawi. Before 1966, it was known as the Nyasaland national football team.

Known as the Flames, Malawi has qualified for three Africa Cup of Nations, in 1984, 2010 and 2021. They also won the CECAFA Cup in 1978, 1979 and 1988 and finished fourth in the 2024 Four Nations Football Tournament.

==History==
===Coaches===
The first full-time coach of the Malawi national football team was Ron Meades. The British Council arranged for his appointment through the English Football Association to coach the team for the Republic Celebrations, playing Madagascar and Zambia. Ray Batchelor was coach for four years from 11 November 1967 to 10 October 1971, guiding the team in 23 friendly matches and two Olympic Games. Players during this time included future coaches in Henry Moyo, Brian Griffin, and Yasin Osman. Other coaches included Brazilian Wander Moreira, British Ted Powell, and the first locally-born coach, Alex Masanjala, who was appointed as an interim before Henry Moyo. Moyo was the first former national player to coach the Flames, and stayed in the position for five years. As of January 2019, only nine coaches had been in charge for more than 20 games. The most successful coaches were Powell, Moyo, and Kim Splidsboel (2000–2002) from Denmark.

===Tournaments===
Malawi first qualified for an African Cup of Nations in 1984, when only eight teams competed in the tournament in Ivory Coast. After a 3-0 defeat against Algeria, World Cup participants in 1982 and 1986, the Malawi drew 2-2 in the second game against eventual finalists Nigeria. With a 0–1 loss against Ghana, Malawi ended the group stage with 1 point at the bottom of the table and was eliminated from the tournament.

After 26 years, Malawi took part in an Africa Cup of Nations again in 2010. The team benefited from the fact that the continental elimination round for the 2010 FIFA World Cup also served as the qualifying round for AFCON. In the group matches of the third round, Malawi, third place behind Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Burkina Faso and with a record of only four points and 4–11 goal difference, was enough to make it to the continental finals.

At the tournament in Angola, Kinnah Phiri&#x27;s team caused a big surprise. In the first group game, Malawi defeated Algeria, which had qualified for the World Cup, 3-0. One of the goalscorers was striker Russel Mwafulirwa, who at the time was under contract for the Swedish first division club IFK Norrköping and was thus one of only two players in the 23-man squad active in Europe. Malawi lost the second game against hosts Angola, 2-0.

For Malawi to have reached the quarter-finals for the first time, a draw in the last group game would have been enough. However, the team lost 3-1 to Mali. After just three minutes, the Malawians were 2-0 down, a goal from Mwafulirwa did nothing to avert the team&#x27;s elimination.

<doc id="1198160" wikidata="Q1146002" url="?curid=1198160" title="Cabinet of curiosities">
<text>Cabinets of curiosities ( and ), also known as wonder-rooms ( ), were encyclopedic collections of objects whose categorical boundaries were, in Renaissance Europe, yet to be defined. Although more rudimentary collections had preceded them, the classic cabinets of curiosities emerged in the sixteenth century. The term &quot;cabinet&quot; originally described a room rather than a piece of furniture. Modern terminology would categorize the objects included as belonging to natural history (sometimes faked), geology, ethnography, archaeology, religious or historical relics, works of art (including cabinet paintings), and antiquities. In addition to the most famous and best documented cabinets of rulers and aristocrats, members of the merchant class and early practitioners of science in Europe formed collections that were precursors to museums.
Cabinets of curiosities served not only as collections to reflect the particular interests of their curators but also as social devices to establish and uphold rank in society. There are said to be two main types of cabinets. As R. J. W. Evans notes, there could be &quot;the princely cabinet, serving a largely representational function, and dominated by aesthetic concerns and a marked predilection for the exotic,&quot; or the less grandiose, &quot;the more modest collection of the humanist scholar or virtuoso, which served more practical and scientific purposes.&quot; Evans goes on to explain that &quot;no clear distinction existed between the two categories: all collecting was marked by curiosity, shading into credulity, and by some sort of universal underlying design&quot;.

In addition to cabinets of curiosity serving as an establisher of socioeconomic status for its curator, these cabinets served as entertainment, as particularly illustrated by the proceedings of the Royal Society, whose early meetings were often a sort of open floor to any Fellow to exhibit the findings his curiosities led him to. However purely educational or investigative these exhibitions may sound, the Fellows in this period supported the idea of &quot;learned entertainment,&quot; or the alignment of learning with entertainment. This was not unusual, as the Royal Society had an earlier history of a love of the marvellous. This love was often exploited by eighteenth-century natural philosophers to secure the attention of their audience during their exhibitions.

==History==

===To c. 1600===

The earliest pictorial record of a natural history cabinet is the engraving in Ferrante Imperato&#x27;s &quot;Dell&#x27;Historia Naturale&quot; (Naples 1599) (&quot;illustration&quot;). It serves to authenticate its author&#x27;s credibility as a source of natural history information, by showing his open bookcases (at the right), in which many volumes are stored lying down and stacked, in the medieval fashion, or with their spines upward, to protect the pages from dust. Some of the volumes doubtless represent his herbarium. Every surface of the vaulted ceiling is occupied with preserved fishes, stuffed mammals and curious shells, with a stuffed crocodile suspended in the centre. Examples of corals stand on the bookcases. At the left, the room is fitted out like a &quot;studiolo&quot; with a range of built-in cabinets whose fronts can be unlocked and let down to reveal intricately fitted nests of pigeonholes forming architectural units, filled with small mineral specimens. Above them, stuffed birds stand against panels inlaid with square polished stone samples, doubtless marbles and jaspers or fitted with pigeonhole compartments for specimens. Below them, a range of cupboards contain specimen boxes and covered jars.
In 1587 Gabriel Kaltemarckt advised Christian I of Saxony that three types of items were indispensable in forming a &quot;Kunstkammer&quot; or art collection: firstly sculptures and paintings; secondly &quot;curious items from home or abroad&quot;; and thirdly &quot;antlers, horns, claws, feathers and other things belonging to strange and curious animals&quot;. When Albrecht Dürer visited the Netherlands in 1521, apart from artworks he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of coral, some large fish fins and a wooden weapon from the East Indies. 

The highly characteristic range of interests represented in Frans II Francken&#x27;s painting of 1636 (&quot;illustration, above&quot;) shows paintings on the wall that range from landscapes, including a moonlit scene—a genre in itself—to a portrait and a religious picture (the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;) intermixed with preserved tropical marine fish and a string of carved beads, most likely amber, which is both precious and a natural curiosity. Sculptures both classical and secular (the sacrificing &quot;Libera&quot;, a Roman fertility goddess) on the one hand and modern and religious (&quot;Christ at the Column&quot;) are represented, while on the table are ranged, among the exotic shells (including some tropical ones and a shark&#x27;s tooth): portrait miniatures, gem-stones mounted with pearls in a curious quatrefoil box, a set of sepia chiaroscuro woodcuts or drawings, and a small still-life painting leaning against a flower-piece, coins and medals—presumably Greek and Roman—and Roman terracotta oil-lamps, a Chinese-style brass lock, curious flasks, and a blue-and-white Ming porcelain bowl.
The &quot;Kunstkammer&quot; of Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor (ruled 1576–1612), housed in the Hradschin at Prague, was unrivalled north of the Alps; it provided solace and retreat for contemplation that also served to demonstrate his imperial magnificence and power in the symbolic arrangement of their display, ceremoniously presented to visiting diplomats and magnates. 

Rudolf&#x27;s uncle, Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria, also had a collection, organized by his treasurer, Leopold Heyperger, which put special emphasis on paintings of people with interesting deformities, which remains largely intact as the Chamber of Art and Curiosities at Ambras Castle in Austria. &quot;The Kunstkammer was regarded as a microcosm or theater of the world, and a memory theater. The Kunstkammer conveyed symbolically the patron&#x27;s control of the world through its indoor, microscopic reproduction.&quot; Of Charles I of England&#x27;s collection, Peter Thomas states succinctly, &quot;The &quot;Kunstkabinett&quot; itself was a form of propaganda.&quot;

===17th century===

Two of the most famously described seventeenth-century cabinets were those of Ole Worm, known as Olaus Wormius (1588–1654) (&quot;illustration, above right&quot;), and Athanasius Kircher (1602–1680). These seventeenth-century cabinets were filled with preserved animals, horns, tusks, skeletons, minerals, as well as other interesting man-made objects: sculptures wondrously old, wondrously fine or wondrously small; clockwork automata; ethnographic specimens from exotic locations. Often they would contain a mix of fact and fiction, including apparently mythical creatures. Worm&#x27;s collection contained, for example, what he thought was a Scythian Lamb, a woolly fern thought to be a plant/sheep fabulous creature. However he was also responsible for identifying the narwhal&#x27;s tusk as coming from a whale rather than a unicorn, as most owners of these believed. The specimens displayed were often collected during exploring expeditions and trading voyages.

Cabinets of curiosities would often serve scientific advancement when images of their contents were published. The catalog of Worm&#x27;s collection, published as the &quot;Museum Wormianum&quot; (1655), used the collection of artifacts as a starting point for Worm&#x27;s speculations on philosophy, science, natural history, and more.

Cabinets of curiosities were limited to those who could afford to create and maintain them. Many monarchs, in particular, developed large collections. A rather under-used example, stronger in art than other areas, was the Studiolo of Francesco I, the first Medici Grand-Duke of Tuscany. Frederick III of Denmark, who added Worm&#x27;s collection to his own after Worm&#x27;s death, was another such monarch. A third example is the Kunstkamera founded by Peter the Great in Saint Petersburg in 1714. Many items were bought in Amsterdam from Albertus Seba and Frederik Ruysch. The fabulous Habsburg Imperial collection included important Aztec artifacts, including the feather head-dress or crown of Montezuma now in the Museum of Ethnology, Vienna. 

Similar collections on a smaller scale were the complex &quot;Kunstschränke&quot; produced in the early seventeenth century by the Augsburg merchant, diplomat and collector Philipp Hainhofer. These were cabinets in the sense of pieces of furniture, made from all imaginable exotic and expensive materials and filled with contents and ornamental details intended to reflect the entire cosmos on a miniature scale. The best preserved example is the one given by the city of Augsburg to King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden in 1632, which is kept in the Museum Gustavianum in Uppsala. The curio cabinet, as a modern single piece of furniture, is a version of the grander historical examples.

The juxtaposition of such disparate objects, according to Horst Bredekamp&#x27;s analysis (Bredekamp 1995), encouraged comparisons, finding analogies and parallels and favoured the cultural change from a world viewed as static to a dynamic view of endlessly transforming natural history and a historical perspective that led in the seventeenth century to the germs of a scientific view of reality.

===18th century and after===
In seventeenth-century parlance, both French and English, a &quot;cabinet&quot; came to signify a collection of works of art, which might still also include an assembly of objects of &quot;virtù&quot; or curiosities, such as a &quot;virtuoso&quot; would find intellectually stimulating. In 1714, Michael Bernhard Valentini published an early museological work, &quot;Museum Museorum&quot;, an account of the cabinets known to him with catalogues of their contents.
In the second half of the eighteenth century, Belsazar Hacquet (c. 17351815) operated in Ljubljana, then the capital of Carniola, a natural history cabinet () that was appreciated throughout Europe and was visited by the highest nobility, including the Holy Roman Emperor, Joseph II, the Russian grand duke Paul and Pope Pius VI, as well as by famous naturalists, such as and . It included a number of minerals, including specimens of mercury from the Idrija mine, a &quot;herbarium vivum&quot; with over 4,000 specimens of Carniolan and foreign plants, a smaller number of animal specimens, a natural history and medical library, and an anatomical theatre.

A late example of the juxtaposition of natural materials with richly worked artifice is provided by the &quot;Green Vaults&quot; formed by Augustus the Strong in Dresden to display his chamber of wonders. The &quot;Enlightenment Gallery&quot; in the British Museum, installed in the former &quot;Kings Library&quot; room in 2003 to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the museum, aims to recreate the abundance and diversity that still characterized museums in the mid-eighteenth century, mixing shells, rock samples and botanical specimens with a great variety of artworks and other man-made objects from all over the world.

Some strands of the early universal collections, the bizarre or freakish biological specimens, whether genuine or fake, and the more exotic historical objects, could find a home in commercial freak shows and sideshows.

===England===

In 1671, when visiting Thomas Browne (1605–1682), the courtier John Evelyn remarked,

Late in his life Browne parodied the rising trend of collecting curiosities in his tract Musaeum Clausum, an inventory of dubious, rumoured and non-existent books, pictures and objects.
Sir Hans Sloane (1660–1753) an English physician, member of the Royal Society and the Royal College of Physicians, and the founder of the British Museum in London, began sporadically collecting plants in England and France while studying medicine. In 1687, the Duke of Albemarle offered Sloane a position as personal physician to the West Indies fleet at Jamaica. He accepted and spent fifteen months collecting and cataloguing the native plants, animals, and artificial curiosities (e.g. cultural artifacts of native and enslaved African populations) of Jamaica. This became the basis for his two volume work, &quot;Natural History of Jamaica&quot;, published in 1707 and 1725. Sloane returned to England in 1689 with over eight hundred specimens of plants, which were live or mounted on heavy paper in an eight-volume herbarium. He also attempted to bring back live animals (e.g., snakes, an alligator, and an iguana) but they all died before reaching England.
Sloane meticulously cataloged and created extensive records for most of the specimens and objects in his collection. He also began to acquire other collections by gift or purchase. Herman Boerhaave gave him four volumes of plants from Boerhaave&#x27;s gardens at Leiden. William Charleton, in a bequest in 1702, gave Sloane numerous books of birds, fish, flowers, and shells and his miscellaneous museum consisting of curiosities, miniatures, insects, medals, animals, minerals, precious stones and curiosities in amber. Sloane purchased Leonard Plukenet&#x27;s collection in 1710. It consisted of twenty-three volumes with over 8,000 plants from Africa, India, Japan and China. Mary Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort (1630–1715), left him a twelve-volume herbarium from her gardens at Chelsea and Badminton upon her death in 1714. Reverend Adam Buddle gave Sloane thirteen volumes of British plants. In 1716, Sloane purchased Engelbert Kaempfer&#x27;s volume of Japanese plants and James Petiver&#x27;s virtual museum of approximately one hundred volumes of plants from Europe, North America, Africa, the Near East, India, and the Orient. Mark Catesby gave him plants from North America and the West Indies from an expedition funded by Sloane. Philip Miller gave him twelve volumes of plants grown from the Chelsea Physic Garden.

Sloane acquired approximately three hundred and fifty artificial curiosities from North American Indians, Inuit, South America, Lapland, Siberia, East Indies, and the West Indies, including nine items from Jamaica.
&quot;These ethnological artifacts were important because they established a field of collection for the British Museum that was to increase greatly with the explorations of Captain James Cook in Oceania and Australia and the rapid expansion of the British Empire.&quot;
Upon his death in 1753, Sloane bequeathed his sizable collection of 337 volumes to England for £20,000. In 1759, George II&#x27;s royal library was added to Sloane&#x27;s collection to form the foundation of the British Museum.
John Tradescant the Elder (circa 1570s–1638) was a gardener, naturalist, and botanist in the employ of the Duke of Buckingham. He collected plants, bulbs, flowers, vines, berries, and fruit trees from Russia, the Levant, Algiers, France, Bermuda, the Caribbean, and the East Indies. His son, John Tradescant the Younger (1608–1662) traveled to Virginia in 1637 and collected flowers, plants, shells, an Indian deerskin mantle believed to have belonged to Powhatan, father of Pocahontas. Father and son, in addition to botanical specimens, collected zoological (e.g., the dodo from Mauritius, the upper jaw of a walrus, and armadillos), artificial curiosities (e.g., wampum belts, portraits, lathe turned ivory, weapons, costumes, Oriental footwear and carved alabaster panels) and rarities (e.g., a mermaid&#x27;s hand, a dragon&#x27;s egg, two feathers of a phoenix&#x27;s tail, a piece of the True Cross, and a vial of blood that rained in the Isle of Wight). By the 1630s, the Tradescants displayed their eclectic collection at their residence in South Lambeth. Tradescant&#x27;s Ark, as it came to be known, was the earliest major cabinet of curiosity in England and open to the public for a small entrance fee.

Elias Ashmole (1617–1692) was a lawyer, chemist, antiquarian, Freemason, and a member of the Royal Society with a keen interest in astrology, alchemy, and botany. Ashmole was also a neighbor of the Tradescants in Lambeth. He financed the publication of &quot;Musaeum Tradescantianum&quot;, a catalogue of the Ark collection in 1656. Ashmole, a collector in his own right, acquired the Tradescant Ark in 1659 and added it to his collection of astrological, medical, and historical manuscripts. In 1675, he donated his library and collection and the Tradescant collection to the University of Oxford, provided that a suitable building be provided to house the collection. Ashmole&#x27;s donation formed the foundation of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford.

Places of exhibitions of and places of new societies that promoted natural knowledge also seemed to culture the idea of perfect civility. Some scholars propose that this was &quot;a reaction against the dogmatism and enthusiasm of the English Civil War and Interregum [sic].&quot; This move to politeness put bars on how one should behave and interact socially, which enabled the distinguishing of the polite from the supposed common or more vulgar members of society. Exhibitions of curiosities (as they were typically odd and foreign marvels) attracted a wide, more general audience, which &quot;[rendered] them more suitable subjects of polite discourse at the Society.&quot; 

A subject was considered less suitable for polite discourse if the curiosity being displayed was accompanied by too much other material evidence, as it allowed for less conjecture and exploration of ideas regarding the displayed curiosity. Because of this, many displays simply included a concise description of the phenomena and avoided any mention of explanation for the phenomena. Quentin Skinner describes the early Royal Society as &quot;something much more like a gentleman&#x27;s club,&quot; an idea supported by John Evelyn, who depicts the Royal Society as &quot;an Assembly of many honorable Gentlemen, who meete inoffensively together under his Majesty&#x27;s Royal Cognizance; and to entertaine themselves ingenously, whilst their other domestique avocations or publique business deprives them of being always in the company of learned men and that they cannot dwell forever in the Universities.&quot;

Cabinets of Curiosities can now be found at Snowshill Manor and Wallington Hall, and the Ashmolean Museum has a display of items from its disparate Ashmole and Tradescant founding collections.

===United States===
Thomas Dent Mutter (1811–1859) was an early American pioneer of reconstructive plastic surgery. His specialty was repairing congenital anomalies, cleft lip and palates, and club foot. He also collected medical oddities, tumors, anatomical and pathological specimens, wet and dry preparations, wax models, plaster casts, and illustrations of medical deformities. This collection began as a teaching tool for young physicians. Just prior to Mütter&#x27;s death in 1859, he donated 1,344 items to the American College of Physicians in Philadelphia, along with a $30,000 endowment for the maintenance and expansion of his museum. Mütter&#x27;s collection was added to ninety-two pathological specimens collected by Doctor Isaac Parrish between 1849 and 1852. The Mütter Museum began to collect antique medical equipment in 1871, including Benjamin Rush&#x27;s medical chest and Florence Nightingale&#x27;s sewing kit. In 1874 the museum acquired one hundred human skulls from Austrian anatomist and phrenologist, Joseph Hyrtl (1810–1894); a nineteenth-century corpse, dubbed the &quot;soap lady&quot;; the conjoined liver and death cast of Chang and Eng Bunker, the Siamese twins; and in 1893, Grover Cleveland&#x27;s jaw tumor. The Mütter Museum is an excellent example of a nineteenth-century grotesque cabinet of medical curiosities.

P. T. Barnum established Barnum&#x27;s American Museum on five floors in New York, &quot;perpetuating into the 1860s the Wunderkammer tradition of curiosities for gullible, often slow-moving throngs—Barnum&#x27;s famously sly but effective method of crowd control was to post a sign, &#x27;THIS WAY TO THE EGRESS!&#x27; at the exit door&quot;.

In 1908, New York businessmen formed the Hobby Club, a dining club limited to 50 men, in order to showcase their &quot;cabinets of wonder&quot; and their selected collections. These included literary specimens and incunabula; antiquities such as ancient armour; precious stones and geological items of interest. Annual formal dinners would be used to open the various collections up to inspection for the other members of the club.

== Declining influence ==
By the early decades of the eighteenth century, curiosities and wondrous specimens began to lose their influence among European natural philosophers. As Enlightenment thinkers placed growing emphasis on patterns and systems within nature, anomalies and rarities came to be regarded as potentially misleading objects of study. Curiosities, previously interpreted as divine messages and expressions of nature&#x27;s variety, were increasingly seen as vulgar exceptions to nature&#x27;s overall uniformity.

==In contemporary culture==
The Houston Museum of Natural Science houses a hands-on Cabinet of Curiosities, complete with taxidermied crocodile embedded in the ceiling a la Ferrante Imperato&#x27;s &quot;Dell&#x27;Historia Naturale&quot;. In Los Angeles, the modern-day Museum of Jurassic Technology anachronistically seeks to recreate the sense of wonder that the old cabinets of curiosity once aroused. 

In Spring Green, Wisconsin, the house and museum of Alex Jordan, known as House on the Rock, can also be interpreted as a modern day curiosity cabinet, especially in the collection and display of automatons. In Bristol, Rhode Island, Musée Patamécanique is presented as a hybrid between an automaton theater and a cabinet of curiosities and contains works representing the field of Patamechanics, an artistic practice and area of study chiefly inspired by Pataphysics. 

The idea of a cabinet of curiosities has also appeared in recent publications and performances. For example, &quot;Cabinet&quot; magazine is a quarterly magazine that juxtaposes apparently unrelated cultural artifacts and phenomena to show their interconnectedness in ways that encourage curiosity about the world. The Italian cultural association Wunderkamern uses the theme of historical cabinets of curiosities to explore how &quot;amazement&quot; is manifested within today&#x27;s artistic discourse. In May 2008, the University of Leeds Fine Art BA programme hosted a show called &quot;Wunder Kammer&quot;, the culmination of research and practice from students, which allowed viewers to encounter work from across all disciplines, ranging from intimate installation to thought-provoking video and highly skilled drawing, punctuated by live performances.

The concept has been reinterpreted at The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, Fine Art &amp; Natural History. In July 2021 a new Cabinet of Curiosities room was opened at The Whitaker Museum &amp; Art Gallery in Rawtenstall, Lancashire, curated by artist Bob Frith, founder of Horse and Bamboo Theatre.

Several internet bloggers describe their sites as &quot;wunderkammern&quot; either because they are primarily links to interesting things, or inspire wonder similarly to the original wunderkammern (see External Links, below). Researcher Robert Gehl describes such internet video sites as YouTube as modern-day wunderkammern, although in danger of being refined into capitalist institutions &quot;just as professionalized curators refined Wunderkammers into the modern museum in the 18th century.&quot;

<text>Jürgen Stroop (born Josef Stroop, 26 September 1895 – 6 March 1952) was a German SS commander during the Nazi era, who served as SS and Police Leader in occupied Poland and Greece from 1942-1943 (in Poland) and 1943-1944 (in Greece) He was a SS-General (Brigadefuhrer Und Gruppenfuhrer) from 1942-1945 . He led the suppression of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943 and wrote the Stroop Report, a twelve-page account of the operation annexed with many original documents and pictures. Following the defeat of Germany, Stroop was prosecuted during the Dachau Trials and convicted of murdering nine U.S. prisoners of war. After his extradition to Poland, Stroop was tried, convicted, and executed for crimes against humanity.

==Early life==
Josef Stroop (he applied to change his first name in 1938, which was authorized 1941) was born in the Principality of Lippe, in the German Empire. His father, Konrad Stroop, was Lippe&#x27;s chief of police. His mother, Katherine, was a homemaker. In a conversation with Kazimierz Moczarski while imprisoned in 1949, Stroop recalled his devoutly religious Roman Catholic mother as &quot;a near fanatic&quot;, who subjected him to childhood physical abuse.

Both of his parents were enthusiastic monarchists. During parades in Detmold, Konrad Stroop often pointed out Leopold IV, Prince of Lippe and said, &quot;Remember this always. This is our Prince. Obey him and serve him as I have.&quot; Young Josef&#x27;s sense of German patriotism was fostered by growing up in the shadow of the &quot;Hermannsdenkmal&quot;.

Stroop enlisted in the Prussian Army in 1914 and served in several infantry regiments along the Western Front. He was wounded in action near La Bassée in October 1914. To the outrage of his devout mother, Stroop married Katharina, the daughter of a minister from the Protestant Church of Lippe, on 3 July 1923. Katharina Stroop remained a loyal and obedient wife despite her husband&#x27;s many infidelities. Their marriage produced a daughter, Renate, in February 1928, and a son, Olaf, in February 1936.

During the early 1920s, Stroop joined the &quot;Tannenbergbund&quot; and embraced Germanic neo-paganism under the influence of General Erich Ludendorff and his wife Mathilde. He later recalled that Mathilde Ludendorff revealed &quot;the truth about the Catholic Church in Germany and returned us to the true Germanic gods. By recalling the pure, pre-Germanic ways, she pointed out the rottenness of the Judeo-Christian ethic and showed how the organized Church had been strangling the Reich for twelve hundred years.&quot; Stroop further recalled, &quot;It was thanks to what I was lucky enough to learn from her books that I was able to rid myself of religious prejudice and mark &quot;Gottgläubig&quot; in the column concerning belief.&quot;

In another conversation with Moczarski, Stroop called Catholicism &quot;a catch-all of religions, infected with Judaism.&quot; He further claimed that Christianity was created as a Jewish conspiracy for &quot;the weakening and debasement of man through guilt.&quot;

==SS career==
Stroop joined the Nazi Party and SS in 1932. In 1933, he was appointed leader of the state auxiliary police. One year later, he was promoted from the rank of SS-&quot;Oberscharführer&quot; to SS-&quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot;. Subsequently, he worked for the SS administration in Münster and Hamburg.
In 1934, Bishop Clemens von Galen of Münster attacked the racist ideologies of the new regime, partly poking fun at it, partly critiquing its ideological basis as published by Alfred Rosenberg. He declared it unacceptable to refuse the Old Testament because of its Jewish authorship, and to limit morality and virtue to the perceived usefulness of a particular race.

In retaliation, Stroop and a von Galen family member of the SS made an official visit to the Bishop. Both were instructed to pressure the Bishop into approving Rosenberg&#x27;s doctrines. If he refused, they were ordered to threaten him with the confiscation of Church property and an anti-Catholic propaganda campaign.

The visit began well, with the bishop commending Stroop&#x27;s mother for her devout Catholicism and charitable work in Detmold. However, the Bishop turned the tables on his two visitors. He categorically refused to accept or praise Rosenberg&#x27;s doctrines of euthanizing or forcibly sterilizing disabled people. To Stroop&#x27;s further shock, the Bishop denounced the Nazis for trying to introduce Germanic neo-paganism into his diocese. He scoffed at marriage ceremonies and funerals conducted before altars dedicated to Wotan. Stroop, who attended such a ceremony only days before, was stunned that the bishop had learned of it so quickly.

At the end of the meeting, von Galen stated the Church would remain loyal to the State in all lawful matters. He expressed his deep love for Germany and reminded them he was the first Catholic Bishop to publicly acknowledge the new regime.

Stroop lamented the fact that von Galen&#x27;s German patriotism &quot;was tainted by Papist ideals, harmful to Germany for centuries. Besides, the Archbishop&#x27;s orders came from outside the Fatherland, a fact which disturbed us. We all know, despite its diverse factions, the Catholic Church is a world community, which sticks together when the chips are down.&quot;

In September 1938, Stroop was promoted again, this time to the rank of SS-&quot;Standartenführer&quot; (colonel), and served near Reichenberg (Liberec), in the Sudetenland. In conversation with Moczarski, Stroop happily reminisced about his many visits to the hot springs at Karlsbad (Karlovy Vary). For this reason, their cellmate, Gustav Schielke, expressed disgust: instead of serving in combat, &quot;&quot;Herr General&quot; did battle in spas.&quot;

===Early World War II===
After the German invasion of Poland, Stroop served as commander of the SS section in Gnesen (Gniezno). During the occupation of Poland, Stroop was transferred to Poznań as head of &quot;Selbstschutz&quot;, the notorious &quot;self-defense&quot; formation of the local ethnic Germans.

In May 1941, Stroop changed his forename from Josef to Jürgen for ideological reasons and in honor of his dead infant son. From 7 July to 15 September 1941, Stroop served in combat on the Eastern Front in the SS Division Totenkopf. He was awarded an Iron Cross 2nd Class. On 16 September 1942, he was promoted to SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; and assigned as an Inspector of the SiPo and SD of the Higher SS and Police Leader for Russia South. Beginning October 1942, Stroop commanded an SS garrison at Kherson, before becoming the SS and Police Leader (SSPF) for Lemberg (Lviv) in February 1943. Stroop was SS inspector of &quot;Durchgangsstrasse&quot; IV, a large forced labor project to build a road from Lemberg to Stalino (now Donetsk).

===Suppression of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising===
Stroop was involved in the month long suppression of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, an action which cost the lives of just over 57,000 people. He was sent to Warsaw on 17 April 1943 by SS leader Heinrich Himmler, as a replacement for SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; Ferdinand von Sammern-Frankenegg, who was relieved of duty. Stroop took over from Sammern-Frankenegg following the latter&#x27;s failure to suppress the uprising at the onset. He commented to war crimes investigators:

Stroop ordered the entire Ghetto to be systematically burned down and blown up, building by building. 57,065 of the survivors, including men, women, and children were either killed on the spot or deported for extermination. In conversation with Moczarski, Stroop described the destruction of the Ghetto in great detail. Stroop also disclosed that, unlike the men under his command, he always left the Ghetto at mealtimes and overnight.
In his daily report 1 May 1943 Stroop reported: &quot;Progress of large scale operation on 1 May 1943. Start 0900 hours. 10 searching parties were detailed, moreover a larger battle group was detailed to comb out a certain block of buildings, with the added instruction to burn that block down. Within this block of buildings there existed a so-called armament factory which had not yet been entirely evacuated, although it had had enough time to do so. It was not exempted from the operation. Today&#x27;s operation a total of 1,026 Jews were caught, of whom 245 were killed, either in battle or while resisting. Moreover, a considerable number of bandits and ringleaders were also caught. In one case a Jew who had already been made ready for transport fired three shots against a 1st Lieutenant of Police, but missed his mark...&quot;. Nearly 6 years later Stroop recalled this shooting episode (quoted in the book &quot;Conversations with an Executioner&quot; by Kazimierz Moczarski):
Stroop expressed confusion that the Ghetto&#x27;s Jewish combatants, whom he viewed as &quot;Untermenschen&quot;, fought effectively against his men.

===SS and Police Leader of Warsaw===


After the suppression, Stroop ordered the destruction of Warsaw&#x27;s Great Synagogue on May 16, 1943. Stroop&#x27;s description was quoted in &quot;Conversations with an Executioner&quot;:
At that point, Stroop assumed the position of SS and Police Leader of Warsaw. Krüger presented an Iron Cross 1st Class to him on 18 June 1943 for the Warsaw Ghetto &quot;action&quot; at a gala reception in Warsaw&#x27;s Łazienki Park. Stroop&#x27;s detailed 75-page report on the suppression of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was bound in black leather. Stroop detailed the capture/and or killing of 57,065 Warsaw Ghetto inmates while German forces had 110 casualties [17 dead/93 wounded]. It included copies of all communiqués and many photographs; two separate copies were sent to SS Police Leader East Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger and Heinrich Himmler while Stroop kept a copy as well as an unbound file copy. Titled &quot;The Jewish Quarter of Warsaw is no more!&quot;, it would later be used as evidence at the Nuremberg Trials.

===Occupied Greece===
In September 1943, Stroop was named the Higher SS and Police Leader (HSSPF) in Greece.
On 16 October, the government of Ioannis Rallis published a decree which put the Security Battalions, Hellenic Gendarmerie and City Police under Stroop&#x27;s orders. The local civilian administration found his methods and behavior unacceptable, and withdrew cooperation, forbidding the local Order Police from having anything to do with him, which made his position untenable. Consequently, he was removed and replaced by Walter Schimana, and on 9 November, was appointed Commander of SS-&quot;Oberabschnitt Rhein-Westmark&quot; (an SS administrative district named for the Rhine and Gau Westmark) in Wiesbaden, serving there until the close of the war.

===Plot of 20 July 1944===

According to Moczarski, no subject enraged Stroop more than the 20 July plot against Adolf Hitler. Whenever the subject came up, Stroop cursed those involved, &quot;in unprintable terms,&quot; as a &quot;murderous band of generals and Jew-ridden civilians.&quot; Stroop blamed Germany&#x27;s defeat on Germans: &quot;A few weaklings poisoned by enemy agents and infected with subversive ideologies were all it took to undermine us. The minute we suffered military defeats, the cancerous elements in our society swung into action, organizing Mafias and creating &#x27;patriotic discussion groups.&#x27; In the end, they destroyed our nation.&quot;

Stroop proudly related his involvement in the purge of anti-Nazi Germans following the plot&#x27;s failure. He expressed annoyance that Field Marshal Erwin Rommel should have been allowed to commit suicide rather than being hanged from a meat hook. He also praised Roland Freisler of the &quot;Volksgerichtshof&quot; as &quot;a fine judge.&quot; Stroop also boasted about his participation in dealing with Field Marshal Günther von Kluge for his involvement in the plot. As General Wilhelm Burgdorf did with Rommel, Stroop claimed to have offered the Field Marshal a choice between suicide and a show trial before Judge Freisler. To Stroop&#x27;s outrage, Kluge demanded his day in court. Stroop then claimed he shot Kluge in the head. Himmler announced the Field Marshal was a suicide.

===Murder of US prisoners of war===
Between October 1944 and March 1945, nine airmen of the United States Army Air Forces were summarily executed after they were shot down and captured in Stroop&#x27;s district. They were Sergeant Willard P. Perry, Sergeant Robert W. Garrison, Private Ray R. Herman, Second Lieutenant William A. Duke, Second Lieutenant Archibald B. Monroe, Private Jimmie R. Heathman, Lieutenant William H. Forman, and Private Robert T. McDonald.

After Moczarski reminded him the killing of POWs was defined as criminal under the Hague and Geneva Conventions, Stroop responded, &quot;It was common knowledge American flyers were terrorists and murderers who used methods contrary to civilized norms ... We were given a statement to that effect from the highest authorities. It was accompanied by an order from Heinrich Himmler.&quot; As a result, he explained, all nine POWs were taken to the forest and given &quot;a ration of lead for their American necks.&quot;

===End of the war===
In late March 1945, Stroop was forced to retreat from Wiesbaden as the advancing U.S. Army crossed the Rhine bridgeheads. Upon his arrival in Pottenstein, Bavaria, Stroop received word Himmler wished to meet him in Berlin. On 14 April, Stroop met Himmler in his private train near Prenzlau. With a pass signed by Himmler, Stroop traveled to the Alpine Redoubt with a group of teenaged Hitler Youth members he was training for war. To obtain gasoline and other scarce supplies, Stroop showed Himmler&#x27;s signed order and claimed to be transporting his Werwolf unit to build an Alpine bastion for the salvation of the Reich.

However, after a secret conference at Taxenbach, Austria, Stroop and his fellow Werwolf commanders decided to change into Wehrmacht uniforms and surrender to the Western Allies. Soon after, Stroop abandoned his Werwolf unit near Kufstein and fled north. On 10 May 1945, Stroop surrendered to the American forces in the village of Rottau, Bavaria.

Stroop told Moczarski he was carrying a cyanide tablet, which he intended to take if captured. After Moczarski asked him his reasons for not taking it, Stroop replied, &quot;It&#x27;s really quite simple. I was afraid.&quot; At the time he surrendered, Stroop carried forged discharge papers made out to a Wehrmacht Captain of Reserve Josef Straup. He kept to this story for nearly two months, before admitting his identity on 2 July 1945.

==Trial at Dachau==

In the case of &quot;U.S. vs. Jurgen Stroop, et al&quot;, the former General and 21 of his subordinates were prosecuted by the U.S. Military Tribunal at Dachau for the &quot;liquidation&quot; of the nine U.S. POWs executed in his district and for being a member of the SS. Lieutenant Colonel William Dwinnel, a U.S. Army lawyer from Brooklyn, New York appeared for the prosecution. Brigadier General Emil C. Kiel of the United States Army Air Forces was assigned as the trial&#x27;s judge. Stroop later called Kiel &quot;a cunning devil,&quot; and expressed a belief the General was Jewish.

In conversation with Moczarski, Stroop lamented, &quot;Nearly all of those judges were Jews or Freemasons. I studied them very closely. Most of them had dark hair.&quot; He further lamented one of his U.S. Army defense lawyers was wearing a Masonic ring in court. According to Gustav Schielke, his cellmate:

Stroop behaved like a swine in the dock. He acted innocent as a lamb, pretending the killings were news to him. Because of his incriminations, several fellow defendants were sentenced to death, as many as thirteen of the twenty-two. As senior commander of the SS and police, &quot;he&quot; gave all the orders, Herr Moczarski, yet he stated in court his underlings killed the American airmen. How could a top German officer act like that?

After an eight-week trial, Kiel sentenced Stroop to death by hanging on 21 March 1947. As for his codefendants, one was acquitted, one escaped and was never tried, 12 of them received death sentences, and the other 7 received prison terms ranging from three to 15 years. In November 1947, a death warrant was signed by General Lucius D. Clay. By then, however, Stroop had been extradited to Warsaw. Three of his condemned codefendants had their death sentences reduced to prison terms, while the other nine were executed by hanging at Landsberg Prison in 1948.

In late May 1947, Stroop was flown to Berlin-Tempelhof Airport, and extradited to the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. He was extradited with Erich Muhsfeldt. He recalled, &quot;My heart sank when I saw those Polish officers at Tempelhof. So, the Americans were liars after all! They promised me time and again I&#x27;d never be given to the Communists and my death sentence for killing the U.S. airmen would be commuted to life imprisonment.&quot;

==Trial in Warsaw and execution==

Stroop&#x27;s trial began on 18 July 1951 at the Warsaw Criminal District Court and lasted three days. He was tried at the same time as Franz Konrad (SS officer) who had been responsible for the requisition of Jewish assets in the Warsaw Ghetto. The trial was intended to include Hermann Höfle as co-defendant and so try the main culprits of the deportation, exploitation and liquidation of the Ghetto, but Hofle managed to escape to Italy and avoid extradition to Poland. Stroop stood accused of four crimes:
:1. Belonging to the SS, a criminal organization.
:2. Liquidating the Warsaw Ghetto, leading to the murder of more than 50,000 people and deporting hundreds of thousands of other Jews to the death camps.
:3. Ordering the shooting of one hundred Poles on 16 July 1943.
:4. Participating in the mass murder of Polish civilians in the Warthegau.

On 23 July 1951, the Court sentenced Stroop and Franz Konrad to death by hanging. In passing sentence, the Court declared,
Since the character and magnitude of Stroop&#x27;s crimes, his attitude and his twisted explanations not only indicate a total lack of repentance but actually confirm that he retains his Nazi view of the world, the Court is unable to find the slightest extenuating circumstance in the accused Stroop&#x27;s conduct. His actions show that he is a being devoid of human feeling, a Fascist hangman who tracked his victims with cold and relentless cruelty, an executioner who must be removed from the society of man.
Stroop was hanged at Mokotów Prison at 7 p.m. 6 March 1952. In 1961, Moczarski wrote to the Procurator General of the Polish Republic and received a letter about Stroop&#x27;s last moments. According to the Procurator&#x27;s letter, Stroop was calm, &quot;exhibiting his usual arrogance&quot;, in the day before his hanging. He expressed no &quot;last wish&quot;. Several days before the hanging, the prison director asked Stroop whether he could reconcile his conscience with the fact he murdered women and children in the Ghetto and watched others do so at his orders; he replied he felt no guilt about killing Jews. Stroop did not utter a word about Germany, Hitler, or future revenge.

== &quot;Conversations with an Executioner&quot; ==

While awaiting trial in Warsaw&#x27;s Mokotów Prison, Stroop spent 255 days in a cell with Kazimierz Moczarski, a former officer in the pre-war Polish Army and his co-accused, SS-&quot;Untersturmfuhrer&quot; Gustav Schielke. Moczarski, under the codename &quot;Maurycy&quot;, served in Poland&#x27;s anti-Nazi and anti-Soviet resistance movement, the &quot;Armia Krajowa&quot; (AK) in World War II. By the time they met, he had been incarcerated for more than three years after communist judges sentenced him on 18 January 1946.

Moczarski was ordered by the AK to assassinate Stroop for crimes against the Polish Nation during his tenure as SS and Police Leader of Warsaw. Due to the unpredictability of Stroop&#x27;s movements, Moczarski was unable to carry out the mission. Following the Soviet-led transformation of Poland into a Marxist-Leninist police state, Moczarski was arrested and tortured by the Polish Ministry of State Security, spending four years on death row before his release in 1956.

During their incarceration, Stroop opened-up in detail about his life. He also shared with Moczarski his letters from his mother, wife, and children in West Germany. Moczarski recalled: &quot;The letters from his mother Stroop gave me to read ... seemed to indicate Frau Stroop did not view as crimes the acts for which Stroop is jailed.&quot;

Moczarski collected notes and wrote a memoir about his 255-day incarceration from 2 March 1949 until 11 November 1949 in one cell with Stroop after his release from prison and re-habilitation in 1956 during the anti-Stalinist Polish October.&lt;ref name=&quot;Podgórski/scribd&quot;&gt;Andrzej Szczypiorski (1977), Moczarski Kazimierz, &quot;Rozmowy z katem&quot; text with &quot;Notes&quot; and &quot;Biography&quot; by Andrzej Krzysztof Kunert (PDF 1.86 MB, available from Scribd.com). Retrieved &lt;/ref&gt; His first draft was written in secrecy. Fifteen years after his ordeal ended, Moczarski published his memoir in installments in the Polish magazine &quot;Odra&quot; monthly in 1972–74. He did not witness the publication of his work in book form. The first shortened book version was released in 1977, two years after Moczarski&#x27;s death. The full text without communist censorship was published in 1992 after the collapse of the Soviet Union, by Polish Scientific Publishers PWN. Moczarski died 27 September 1975 in Warsaw, weakened by the years of physical torture endured during his communist &#x27;interrogations&#x27; by the UB secret police.

The book titled &quot;Rozmowy z katem&quot;, with excerpts published in newspapers and magazines during his lifetime, was translated and published in English as &quot;Conversations with an Executioner&quot; by Prentice-Hall in 1981, hardcover, and is translated into several languages. On 18 April 2012, Philip Boehm&#x27;s stage adaptation of Moczarski&#x27;s memoir premiered at the Upstream Theater in St. Louis, Missouri, US.

<text>Nosler, Inc. is an American manufacturing company based in Bend, Oregon, known for producing ammunition and handloading components and specializing in high-performance hollow-point and soft-point hunting bullets. The current companies also include subsidiaries Nosler Custom and Nosler Reloading. Nosler&#x27;s contributions to shooting sports include both polymer-tipped bullet designs and new manufacturing techniques used in their production.

==Early history==
John Amos Nosler was born on April 4, 1913, in Brawley, California. While hunting moose in British Columbia in 1946, while using his Winchester Model 70 chambered in .300 H&amp;H Magnum, the bullets he was using failed to penetrate deeply enough to reach vital organs and kill the animal quickly. At the time, most jacketed bullets employed a single copper alloy envelope (the jacket) around a single lead alloy core. The jacket on most military bullets was closed in front and opened at the base. These full metal jacket bullets offered good penetration, but often failed to expand and passed completely through an animal leaving a comparatively small wound. Soft-point hunting bullets like Nosler was using had the jacket applied in the opposite direction to completely cover the base, but open at the nose. These bullets would expand to leave a large wound channel, but sometimes broke into small pieces with inadequate momentum to overcome resistance of moving through bone or muscle tissue.

The experience inspired Nosler to develop a new bullet design, intended to expand readily at low impact velocities yet maintain integrity at high impact velocities (see terminal ballistics). These &quot;Nosler Partition&quot; bullets used a specially designed jacket enclosing two separate lead alloy cores. The front core was open on the nose to expand easily, but expansion would stop at the partition (which was a solid layer of copper extending right across the bullet, not just the thin shell of copper which composed the jacket). The portion of the bullet behind the partition has the structural integrity of a full metal jacket bullet, but the expanded forward jacket leaves a larger wound channel. Bullets were originally manufactured for personal use, using hand made, lathe-turned jackets. In 1948 Nosler began to sell the partition bullets commercially, forming Nosler, Inc.

Further innovations by Nosler included new techniques of manufacturing bullet jackets that yielded more consistent expansion, better core bonding techniques to prevent separation of the lead core from the copper jacket, and the plastic Ballistic Tip (polymer nose cone) used to provide hollow point bullets a streamlined shape of boat tail Spitzer bullets. The Nosler Ballistic Tip design has been copied by other manufacturers, such as the V-Max, ELD and A-Tip (aluminum tip) series bullets by Hornady. John Nosler sold the production facilities to his son in 1988, and died at his home in Bend, Oregon, on October 10, 2010.

==Company information==
Today, Nosler makes a number of different hunting bullets for rifle, handgun, and muzzle-loaders. They also manufacture brass and sell loaded ammunition, and Nosler Custom has recently begun to sell limited edition and semi-custom hunting rifles. The original Partition design bullet still is the company&#x27;s flagship product. It has undergone many refinements over the years, but the basic design concept has remained unchanged.

==Company news==
Nosler experienced a massive explosion at their plant in Bend, Oregon, on June 2, 2010. No one was harmed in the blast.

In February 2015, Nosler announced plans to expand their long-standing operations in Bend, Oregon to their neighboring city of Redmond, where the company purchased 60 acres of undeveloped land in December 2014. Construction of a 30,000 sq. ft. building is planned for completion in 2016 and will house Nosler&#x27;s growing ammunition and cartridge brass operations, including the manufacturing of their SSA by Nosler product line based on the company&#x27;s acquisition of Silver State Armory in 2013. The expansion is expected to add approximately 20 jobs in Central Oregon and will allow the original Bend plant to focus exclusively on bullet production.

==Company developments==
In 2006 Nosler announced its very first rifle offering, the Model 48 Trophy Grade.

Nosler announced the company&#x27;s first proprietary cartridge, the 26 Nosler, as the world&#x27;s most powerful 6.5mm cartridge commercially available during SHOT Show in January 2014. In January 2015, Nosler introduced the company&#x27;s second cartridge, the 28 Nosler, a 7mm rifle cartridge based on the 26 Nosler case. Since their release, the 26 Nosler and 28 Nosler have been known for high muzzle velocities and extremely flat trajectories. The parent case for both cartridges is based on the .300 Remington Ultra Magnum case.

In October 2014, Nosler introduced Ballistic Tip Ammunition as the latest product offering in their factory loaded ammunition. The ammunition is loaded exclusively with Nosler&#x27;s line of Ballistic Tip hunting bullets, a polymer-tipped projectile made popular by the company when introduced in 1984 as a premium choice for hunting medium-sized game such as deer, antelope and wild hogs. The Ballistic Tip Ammunition line pairs the performance of the Ballistic Tip projectile with Nosler&#x27;s own component brass.

Late 2014 Nosler revamped the Model 48 line. It did away with the Trophy Grade Rifle and replaced it with the Patriot Rifle. The new rifle has a Basix trigger and Bell and Carlson stock. For the most accuracy out of the Patriot, Nosler incorporated an aluminum bedding chassis into the aramid-fiber reinforced carbon fiber stock, and the barrel is free-floated. The stock is a hand laid-up laminate that is elephant gray with black epoxy webbed over the surface. Which means it&#x27;s never going to warp or crack. The comb is straight with a pancake cheekpiece and a thick, solid pistol grip. The Patriot rifle chambered in .26 Nosler should be an effective hunting combination from the mountains to the prairies.

Early 2016 Nosler introduced its third cartridge the .30 Nosler.

October 2016 Nosler introduces a new line of Competition / Target Bullets - RDF Bullets

October 2016 Nosler introduces the .33 Nosler

January 2017 Nosler introduced the .22 Nosler.

<doc id="1198166" wikidata="Q489618" url="?curid=1198166" title="HEK 293 cells">
<text>Human embryonic kidney 293 cells, also often referred to as HEK 293, HEK-293, 293 cells, are an immortalised cell line derived from HEK cells isolated from a female fetus in the 1970s.

The HEK 293 cell line has been widely used in research for decades due to its reliable and fast growth and propensity for transfection. The cell line is used by the biotechnology industry to produce therapeutic proteins and viruses for gene therapy as well as safety testing for a vast array of chemicals.

== History ==
HEK 293 cells were generated in 1973 by transfection of cultures of normal human embryonic kidney cells with sheared adenovirus 5 DNA in Alex van der Eb&#x27;s laboratory in Leiden, the Netherlands. The cells were obtained from a single, aborted or miscarried fetus, the precise origin of which is unclear. The cells were cultured by van der Eb; the transfection with adenoviral DNA was performed by Frank Graham, a post-doc in van der Eb&#x27;s lab. They were published in 1977 after Graham left Leiden for McMaster University. They are called HEK since they originated in human embryonic kidney cultures, while the number 293 came from Graham&#x27;s habit of numbering his experiments; the original HEK 293 cell clone was from his 293rd experiment. Graham performed the transfection a total of eight times, obtaining just one clone of cells that were cultured for several months. After presumably adapting to tissue culture, cells from this clone developed into the relatively stable HEK 293 line.

Subsequent analysis has shown that the transformation was brought about by inserting ~4.5 kilobases from the left arm of the adenoviral genome, which became incorporated into human chromosome 19.

For many years it was assumed that HEK 293 cells were generated by transformation of either a fibroblastic, endothelial or epithelial cell, all of which are abundant in kidneys. However, the original adenovirus transformation was inefficient, suggesting that the cell that finally produced the HEK 293 line may have been unusual in some fashion. Graham and coworkers provided evidence that HEK 293 cells and other human cell lines generated by adenovirus transformation of human embryonic kidney cells have many properties of immature neurons, suggesting that the adenovirus preferentially transformed a neuronal lineage cell in the original kidney culture.

A comprehensive study of the genomes and transcriptomes of HEK 293 and five derivative cell lines compared the HEK 293 transcriptome with that of human kidney, adrenal, pituitary and central nervous tissue. The HEK 293 pattern most closely resembled that of adrenal cells, which have many neuronal properties. Given the location of the adrenal gland (&quot;adrenal&quot; means &quot;next to the kidney&quot;), a few adrenal cells could plausibly have appeared in an embryonic kidney derived culture, and could be preferentially transformed by adenovirus. Adenoviruses transform neuronal lineage cells much more efficiently than typical human kidney epithelial cells. An embryonic adrenal precursor cell therefore seems the most likely origin cell of the HEK 293 line. As a consequence, HEK 293 cells should not be used as an &quot;in vitro&quot; model of typical kidney cells.

HEK 293 cells have a complex karyotype, exhibiting two or more copies of each chromosome and with a modal chromosome number of 64. They are described as hypotriploid, containing less than three times the number of chromosomes of a haploid human gamete. Chromosomal abnormalities include a total of three copies of the X chromosomes and four copies of chromosome 17 and chromosome 22. The presence of multiple X chromosomes and the lack of any trace of Y chromosome derived sequence suggest that the source fetus was female.

The 293T cell line was created in Michele Calos&#x27;s lab at Stanford by stable transfection of the HEK 293 cell line with a plasmid encoding a temperature-sensitive mutant of the SV40 large T antigen; it was originally referred to as 293/&quot;tsA1609neo&quot;. The first reference to the cell line as &quot;293T&quot; may be its use to create the BOSC23 packaging cell line for producing retroviral particles.

== Variants ==

Multiple variants of HEK 293 have been reported.
=== HEK 293T ===
The transfection used to create 293T (involving plasmid pRSV-1609) conferred neomycin/G418 resistance and expression of the tsA1609 allele of SV40 large T antigen; this allele is fully active at 33 °C (its permissive temperature), has substantial function at 37 °C, and is inactive at 40 °C. 293T is very efficiently transfected with DNA (like its parent HEK 293). Due to the expression of SV40 large T antigen, transfected plasmid DNAs that carry the SV40 origin of replication can replicate in 293T and will transiently maintain a high copy number; this can greatly increase the amount of recombinant protein or retrovirus that can be produced from the cells.

The full genome sequences of three different isolates of 293T have been determined. They are quite similar to each other but show detectable divergence from the parental HEK 293 cell line.

=== HEK293-ENT1KO ===
This mutant strain does not express of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter ENT1. The gene was knocked out using CRISPR-CAS9 and the cell line retains ENT2 expression.

== Applications ==

HEK 293 cells are straightforward to grow in culture and to transfect. They have been used as hosts for gene expression. Typically, these experiments involve transfecting in a gene (or combination of genes) of interest, and then analyzing the expressed protein. The widespread use of this cell line is due to its transfectability by the various techniques, including calcium phosphate method, achieving efficiencies approaching 100%.

Examples of such experiments include:
* Effects of a drug on sodium channels
* Inducible RNA interference system
* Isoform-selective protein kinase C agonist
* Interaction between two proteins
* Nuclear export signal in a protein

HEK 293 cells were adapted to grow in suspension culture, as opposed to proliferation on plastic plates, in 1985. This enabled the growth of large amounts of recombinant adenovirus vectors.

A more specific use of HEK 293 cells is in the propagation of adenoviral vectors. Viruses offer an efficient means of delivering genes into cells, which they evolved to do, and are thus of great use as experimental tools. However, as pathogens, they also present a risk to the experimenter. This danger can be avoided by the use of viruses which lack key genes, and which are thus unable to replicate after entering a cell. In order to propagate such viral vectors, a cell line that expresses the missing genes is required. Since HEK 293 cells express a number of adenoviral genes, they can be used to propagate adenoviral vectors in which these genes (typically, E1 and E3) are deleted, such as AdEasy. However, homologous recombination between the inserted cellular Ad5 sequence and the vector sequence, although rare, can restore the replication capacity to the vector.

An important variant of this cell line is the 293T cell line. It contains the SV40 large T-antigen that allows for episomal replication of transfected plasmids containing the SV40 origin of replication. This allows for amplification of transfected plasmids and extended temporal expression of desired gene products. HEK 293, and especially HEK 293T, cells are commonly used for the production of various retroviral vectors. Various retroviral packaging cell lines are also based on these cells.

== Native proteins of interest ==

Depending on various conditions, the gene expression of HEK 293 cells may vary. The following proteins of interest (among many others) are commonly found in untreated HEK 293 cells:
* Corticotrophin releasing factor type 1 receptor
* Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors EDG1, EDG3 and EDG5
* Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3
* Transient receptor potential TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, TRPC6

== Bioethics ==
Alvin Wong, a Catholic bioethicist, argues that despite the uncertainty over the origin of the embryonic cells used to obtain the cell line, one can infer that it came from a voluntary abortion. To some, this may present an ethical dilemma for using HEK 293 and derivative products, such as vaccines and many medications.

On 21 December 2020, the Roman Catholic Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stated that the moral duty to avoid vaccines made from cell lines derived from fetuses is, &quot;not obligatory if there is grave danger, such as the otherwise uncontainable spread of a serious pathological event -- in this case, the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19&quot;. The statement then justifies the use of other vaccines, &quot;all vaccinations recognized as clinically safe and effective can be used in good conscience...&quot;

During the COVID-19 pandemic, anti-vaccination activists noted that HEK 293 cells are used in the manufacturing of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (AKA AZD1222). The cells are filtered out of the final products.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, the maker of REGN-COV2, a therapeutic antibody cocktail used to alleviate symptoms of patients with COVID-19, did not use HEK 293T cells to produce the antibody cocktail but did use those cells to assess the potency of the drug.

In response to ethical concerns of vaccine production, several strategies for clinicians to discuss with their patients have been suggested.

<text>The Halifax Forum is an arena and multi-purpose facility in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Its uses include sporting events, bingo, ice skating, concerts and markets. It was built in 1927 on the site of the former Nova Scotia Provincial Exhibition which was badly damaged by the Halifax explosion in 1917. It opened on 26 December 1927 and incorporated the first artificial ice surface east of Montreal. It is the second biggest arena in Nova Scotia, and the fifth biggest in Atlantic Canada. The building was added to the Canadian Register of Historic Places in 2003.

==Sports==
It is the former home of the Nova Scotia Voyageurs of the American Hockey League. The Voyageurs won the Calder Cup three times at the forum: 1971-72, 1975-76, and 1976-77. The Voyageurs moved to the new Halifax Metro Centre (now the Scotiabank Center) in 1979. Other former tenants include the Halifax Junior Canadians, Halifax Wolverines (senior team), and the AUS St. Mary&#x27;s Huskies. The arena now hosts Dalhousie Tigers hockey, Halifax Macs of the Nova Scotia U18 Major Hockey League and the QMJHL&#x27;s Mooseheads preseason games.

It is also home to basketball, boxing and curling. The arena&#x27;s capacity for hockey is 5,796 and about 6,300 with standing room. The arena&#x27;s capacity for basketball is 6,800. The forum&#x27;s capacity for concerts is 7,300. The largest audience for an event held at the Forum was reportedly close to 8,600 people, at the first live World Wrestling Federation show in Halifax, on July 18, 1987, which featured a main event match between then-WWF champion Hulk Hogan and Randy &quot;Macho Man&quot; Savage. During the 2011 Canada Games, the Forum hosted the boxing competitions.

==Concert and event venue==

The hall also hosts trade shows and concerts. In 2018 the venue hosted two nights of John Mellencamp&#x27;s Sad Clowns &amp; Hillbillies tour.

== Nova Scotia Voyageurs ==
The Nova Scotia Voyageurs were a professional ice hockey team, based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. They played in the American Hockey League, from 1971 to 1984. Originally chartered as the Houston Apollos of the Central Hockey League, the organization was relocated to Montreal after five seasons due to low attendance and travel costs. The Voyageurs (or &quot;Vees&quot; for short) played their first two seasons (1969–71), as the Montreal Voyageurs and were the affiliate of the National Hockey League&#x27;s Montreal Canadiens.

In 1971, they relocated to Halifax, Nova Scotia. They were the first AHL team to be located in Atlantic Canada, and would be the first to play in the Halifax Metro Centre in 1979. The team was also the first Canadian club to win the Calder Cup, and were the class of the league for many years - only in two seasons did the team garner a losing record, and the Voyageurs never missed the playoffs. The team eventually moved to Sherbrooke, Quebec to become the Sherbrooke Canadiens.

The Vees won three Calder Cups, the first in 1972. Nova Scotia won again in 1976 and 1977, while their parent Canadiens were winning back-to-back Stanley Cups; this is the only time an NHL/AHL affiliated combo have won both Cups in the same year twice.

The team was replaced in Halifax by the Nova Scotia Oilers, an affiliate of the Edmonton Oilers and subsequently the Halifax Citadels, an affiliate of the Quebec Nordiques.

With the success of the Voyageurs in its existence of 13 seasons, it spawned a period of 34 consecutive years where there would be at least one AHL team in Atlantic Canada. This was largely due to the desire of several Canadian NHL franchises to continue to pay players sent down to the minors in Canadian dollars throughout the 1980s and 1990s. However, by the late 1990s, many of the remaining AHL teams in Atlantic Canada had disappeared, either by relocation or by the franchise being rendered dormant. The last remaining team in this long period would be the St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs, which moved from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador in 2005 to Toronto, Ontario to play as the Toronto Marlies. The AHL did not return to Atlantic Canada until 2011 with the St. John&#x27;s IceCaps.

== Halifax Mooseheads ==
The Halifax Mooseheads are a Canadian major junior ice hockey club in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The team was founded in 1994 and began play in the Dilio Division of the QMJHL from the 1994–95 season. They have appeared in the President&#x27;s Cup Finals four times, winning in 2013. The other three appearances were in 2003, 2005 and 2019. They hosted the Memorial Cup tournament in 2000 and 2019 and won the Memorial Cup in 2013. The team plays their home games in the Scotiabank Centre with a capacity of 11,093 seats.

The Mooseheads were the first team from Atlantic Canada to join the QMJHL. With the Mooseheads&#x27; success, the QMJHL then expanded to several other east coast cities. The QMJHL&#x27;s eastward expansion has been credited with elevating the skill level and the career opportunities for hockey talent from the region. In the 2018–19 season, three of the NHL&#x27;s top seven scorers were QMJHL alumni from Halifax; two of them former Mooseheads.

== Dalhousie Tigers ==
The Dalhousie Tigers are the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s athletic teams that represent Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The Tigers field 14 varsity teams with seven men&#x27;s teams and seven women&#x27;s teams that primarily compete in the Atlantic University Sport conference of U Sports. The university also offers numerous intramural and club sports that are available to students, staff, alumni, and Dalpex members.

== Saint Mary&#x27;s Huskies ==
The Saint Mary&#x27;s Huskies are the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s athletic teams that represent Saint Mary&#x27;s University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Their primary home turf is Huskies Stadium located in the centre of the University&#x27;s campus.

In September 2007, Saint Mary&#x27;s announced the plans to build the new Homburg Centre for Health &amp; Wellness that will comprise the current gymnasium (The Tower), the new Dauphinee Arena, and a new building to connect the two. The centre is to be named after Dr. Richard Homburg, who provided a $5 million gift to the project, the largest gift the university had received in its 205-year history. The Dauphinee Arena, completed in 2019, has an NHL-sized ice surface and a capacity for 1200. Before they had play at the Halifax forum. The arena is named for the late Mr. Bob Dauphinee who was a strong supporter of the Huskies hockey team for over 50 years. Upon his death in 2001, Mr. Dauphinee had left an estate gift to the university of $2.1 million.

<text>Siyuan Bridge () is a large, complex overpass in northeastern Beijing, China.

Similar to Wuyuan Bridge further north and Sanyuan Bridge further south, it links three roads instead of just two for a normal overpass. The Airport Expressway, China National Highway 101, and the 4th Ring Road are linked.

Siyuan Bridge is extremely complex. Approaching east (coming in from the west), one faces two exits within a few metres of each other, and the second exit splits into two on the bridge. Half a kilometre away lies yet another exit. The exits for the portion coming in from the east are even more complex (three separate exits), and there is no entrance into the Airport Expressway heading south. Odder still, drivers heading for Beijing Capital International Airport can only enter the 4th Ring Road heading west, but those coming into central Beijing can pick both directions.</text><links>

<text>Cass Technical High School (simply referred to as Cass Tech) is a four-year Public magnet high school in Midtown Detroit, Michigan, United States. It was established in 1907 and is part of the Detroit Public Schools Community District. It is named after Lewis Cass.

Until 1977, Cass was Detroit&#x27;s only magnet school and the only non-neighborhood enrollment school in Detroit. It remains one of few magnet schools in Detroit. Entrance is based on test scores and middle school grades. Students are required to choose a curriculum path—roughly equivalent to a college &quot;major&quot; —in the ninth grade. Areas of study include among others arts and communication, business management and marketing, engineering and manufacturing, human services, and science and arts.

== History ==

The school was founded in 1907 on the third floor of Cass Union School on Grand Union Avenue, subsequently moving to its own wing. After that school was mostly destroyed by a fire, a building for Cass Tech was built on the site and opened in October 1912, but was soon overcrowded. A new building nearby on Second Avenue was designed in Collegiate Gothic style by Malcolmson and Higginbotham with Albert Kahn as construction architect; construction began in 1916, the cornerstone was laid in 1917, and after delays caused by World War I austerity measures, the building opened in September 1922. It had a capacity of 3,600 students and was connected to the High School of Commerce, which opened earlier the same year in Cass Tech&#x27;s former building, by Victory Memorial Arch, a pedestrian bridge over Main Street that was a memorial to students killed in the war. By 1942 the school had more than 4,500 students and was the largest in Michigan. In 1985, an addition on the south side was opened, designed by Albert Kahn &amp; Associates, which included performing arts facilities, a new pool, and a student cafeteria, and a wing of the building was remodeled for computer and business classes. Departments in the 1922 building were grouped by floor; facilities included a foundry and machine shops that were used for training by Ford outside school hours, and the auditorium was used as a practice hall by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. The 1922 building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in March 2011.

In 2008, due to declining enrollment, teacher staffing was reduced and some classes that were not very popular with students were removed.

== Academics ==

Cass offers over twenty advanced placement courses including language composition, history, chemistry, calculus, and physics. Cass Tech students&#x27; strong academic performances draw recruiters from across the country, including Ivy League representatives eager to attract the top minority applicants. However, in 2019, Cass Tech was not among the 78 Michigan high schools with the highest average SAT scores. In 2021, &quot;U.S. News&quot; ranked Cass Tech 84th among Michigan high schools, and reported a 62.9% percentile score on the SAT.

=== Awards ===
In 1984, Cass Tech was honored by the U.S. Department of Education among 262 schools that should &quot;shine as inspirational model for others,&quot; a list that included public and private schools.

In 2006, Cass represented DPS at the National Academic Games Olympics and won the Team Sweepstakes award.

== Music ==

=== Harp and vocal ===
The school&#x27;s Harp program was established in 1925.

=== Bands ===
There are beginner, intermediate, advanced and jazz band classes, as well as a marching band. The CTMB (marching band), under the direction of Sharon Allen, has performed for Patti LaBelle, Sinbad, and Jay Z as well as various college and university homecomings. The marching band was also a part of the 2007 Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida, but was not televised. In 2008, the band performed at Texas Southern University. In 2010, the CTMB participated in Norfolk State University&#x27;s Homecoming and won first place in the McDonald&#x27;s Battle of the Bands. The CTMB went to the 2013 inauguration for President Barack Obama.

The concert band program rose to prominence under the direction of Harry Begian, who led the Cass Tech bands from 1947 through 1964. Under his baton, the concert band performed twice at the Mid-West Band and Orchestra Clinic, and played literature at a level far beyond that normally performed by a public high school band, including the Symphony in B-flat by Paul Hindemith and La Fiesta Mexicana by H. Owen Reed.

== Athletics ==

=== Football ===

The Cass Tech Technicians football team (also referred to as the Technicians) is a high school football program in Division 1 Public School League, representing Cass Technical High School.

Cass Tech won the 2011, 2012, 2016, and 2024 MHSAA Division I state championships.

=== Basketball ===
* 1956 Boys Class A State Champions
* 1975 Boys Class A State Champions
* 2023 Boys Division 1 State Champions

=== Track and field ===
Cass Tech&#x27;s track and field history goes back to 1926 when Eddie Tolan and his teammate Loving won the interscholastic track meet at Northwestern University. Tolan came to be known as the &quot;Midnight Express&quot;. He set world records in the 100-yard dash and 100 meters event and Olympic records in the 100 meters and 200 meters events. He was the first African-American to receive the title of the &quot;world&#x27;s fastest human&quot; after winning gold medals in the 100 and 200 meters events at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In March 1935, Tolan won the 75, 100 and 220-yard events at the World Professional Sprint Championships in Melbourne, Australia to become the first man to win both the amateur and professional world sprint championships. In his full career as a sprinter, Tolan won 300 races and lost only 7.

==== Northwestern Interscholastic Track Meet ====
* March 1926: 1st Place – National Champions
* March 1927: 3rd Place
* March 1928: 3rd Place

== Campus ==
=== Architecture ===
A new campus opened in May 2005 in an adjacent lot on Grand River Avenue to the north of the original building.

The former building, including the extension, was left vacant (with classroom fittings and supplies inside). The alumni association announced plans in April 2007 to renovate it as a multi-use center including arts spaces, retail, and residences, but in July 2007 a fire damaged the 1922 section. The school district listed the building for demolition later that year. Demolition began in December 2010 and was completed in August 2011. At the time of demolition, the school building was approximately and weighed more than . Over 90% of the material in the building was recycled for other uses or as backfill.

The indie rock band Mattiel&#x27;s 2017 song, &quot;Cass Tech&quot;, laments the building&#x27;s 2011 demolition.

<text>Pitḫana (Pythanas) was a Bronze Age king, during the 18th century BC (middle chronology), of the Anatolian city of Kuššara, and a forerunner of the later Hittite dynasty.

During his reign he conquered the city of Kanesh, heart of the Assyrian trading colonies network in Anatolia, and core of the Hittite-speaking territories.

The seal of an agricultural official Ilī-Samas has been discovered with several texts at Tell al-Rimah. The seal describes Ilī-Samas as being a servant of a name that may be Pitḫana, which could correspond to King Pitḫana of Kuššara. If so, the seal is dated to approximately year 20 of the reign of King Samsu-iluna of Babylon (c. 1730 BC according to the middle chronology or c. 1666 BC according to the short chronology).

He was succeeded by his son, Anitta, who is best known for conquering Hattusa, the future Hittite capital, and memorializing his achievement using the Hittite language.

<text>The , popularly known as G-Cans, is an underground water infrastructure project in Kasukabe, Saitama, Japan. It is the world&#x27;s largest underground flood water diversion facility, built to mitigate overflowing of the city&#x27;s major waterways and rivers during rain and typhoon seasons. It is located between Showa and Kasukabe in Saitama prefecture, on the outskirts of the city of Tokyo in the Greater Tokyo Area.

Work on the project started in 1992 and was completed by early 2006. It consists of five concrete containment silos with heights of and diameters of , connected by of tunnels, beneath the surface, as well as a large water tank with a height of , with a length of , with a width of , and with fifty-nine massive pillars connected to seventy-eight pumps that can pump up to of water into the Edo River per second.

<text>Centre 200 is Cape Breton&#x27;s primary sports and entertainment facility, located in Sydney, Nova Scotia. It is home to the QMJHL&#x27;s Cape Breton Eagles. Besides ice hockey, the arena hosts many other events, such as rock concerts, figure skating, and antique/custom car shows. The facility features an obstruction-free sports arena that seats 5,000 people, expandable seating to 6,500 for concert hall purposes, and exhibit space of with the possibility of another upon removal of telescopic seating.

==History==
===Notable events===
Centre 200 was conceived as a bicentennial project of the municipality, and was constructed on the former site of the old &quot;Sydney Forum&quot; in the downtown area. The venue opened in early 1987, and hosted a concert by musician Bryan Adams as its first major event. It was the primary sporting venue for the 1987 Canada Winter Games and hosted the opening ceremonies which were attended by then-Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.

From 1988 to 1996, the arena was home to professional ice hockey, the American Hockey League&#x27;s Cape Breton Oilers, until the parent Edmonton Oilers elected to relocate the team to Hamilton, Ontario. In 1993, the Oilers won the AHL&#x27;s Calder Cup championship in front of a sellout crowd at Centre 200.

In 1993 and 1994, the arena was home to the Cape Breton Breakers of the National Basketball League (NBL). The NBL folded on July 9, 1994.

The arena hosted the MJAHL&#x27;s Cape Breton Islanders for the 1996–97 season.
Prior to the 1997–98 QMJHL season, the Granby Prédateurs, winners of the 1996 Memorial Cup, relocated from Granby, Quebec to Sydney, Nova Scotia and were renamed the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles (and later Cape Breton Eagles). The team, which won a division title in 2003–04, remains Centre 200&#x27;s primary tenant. Future National Hockey League stars such as Sidney Crosby, Marc-André Fleury, and Vincent Lecavalier have skated at Centre 200 as QMJHL players.

In March 2000, Centre 200 hosted the 2000 Esso Canadian National Championship for women&#x27;s ice hockey, during which Ontario defeated Quebec to win the gold medal. Centre 200 co-hosted the 2003 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, along with the Halifax Metro Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The arena is very popular for community ice hockey, annually hosting both the &quot;Sydney Academy Blue and White Pepsi Challenge Cup&quot; and the &quot;Royal Canadian Legion Bantam AAA Challenge Cup&quot;. The tournaments and games provide hospitality for teams from all over Nova Scotia and generally draw large crowds.

Centre 200 hosted the &quot;2008 QMJHL Entry Draft&quot;, which was projected to inject over $2 million into the local economy. The arena also hosted game one of the 2008 ADT Canada-Russia Challenge in November 2008.

Aside from ice hockey, Centre 200 has also hosted performances by popular acts such as Rush, Metallica, Elton John, The Tragically Hip, Celine Dion, Rod Stewart, Nickelback, Rita MacNeil, The Rankin Family, World Wrestling Entertainment events, among many others.

In March 2009, it was announced that major renovations would occur to the arena, thanks to financial contributions from the Provincial and federal governments, the municipality and $500,000 from the Cape Breton Screaming Eagles. Renovations include a new video scoreboard, 13 luxury boxes and new club seating. It is anticipated that the renovations will increase the building&#x27;s capacity to over 5,000.

In December 2013–January 2014, Centre 200 was one of the host arenas for the 2014 World U-17 Hockey Challenge. Team USA went on to win the tournament 4–0 against Team Pacific.

In 2018, the venue hosted concerts by Bryan Adams and Chicago. 

Centre 200 was host for both the 2019 Scotties Tournament of Hearts Canadian national women&#x27;s curling competition, and the 2024 World Women&#x27;s Curling Championship.

===Naming===

Centre 200 is named in honour of the two-hundredth anniversary of the founding of Sydney, which took place in 1785. In the original vision, the venue was to have a larger seating capacity and be named &quot;Centre 2000&quot; but funding issues led to a smaller venue than originally proposed.

===Location===
Centre 200 is located on George Street, which lies in the heart of Sydney. The arena is connected to a Casino Nova Scotia which was added in 1995, and hosts a Tim Hortons restaurant within its parking lot, generally bringing good business to both venues when Centre 200 hosts an event. However, frequent traffic congestion and shortage of convenient parking spaces has drawn criticism from attendees.

<text>The 27 MHz CB27/81 Bandplan is a list of the channel frequencies for FM CB radio in the United Kingdom.

Unlike CB usage in the United States, and subsequently elsewhere in the world, the original UK 40 channels progress in order with 10 kHz spacing. These channels apply to UK-only radios meeting MPT-1320 (marked CB 27/81) and MPT-1382 (marked PR 27/97, these may also feature the additional 40 CEPT channels). In 2006, the UK 27/81 Bandplan was introduced by the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s Comreg as one of two sets of channels available for the Wireless Public Address System (WPAS) licensing scheme (similar to the UK&#x27;s CADS – Community Audio Distribution System), as many Irish churches were already illegally using UK 27/81 CB equipment for this purpose. Usage of the 27/81 channels for CB however remains illegal in the Republic of Ireland, though usage has been noted in areas near the Northern Ireland border.

By convention, channel 9 is set aside for emergency use, channel 14 is a &#x27;calling&#x27; channel, where one CBer can call someone else before they both move to another channel for the bulk of their conversation. Channel 19 is commonly used by mobile stations (in vehicles).

<text>Marshall Hain were a British pop-rock duo known for their 1978 hit &quot;Dancing in the City&quot;, a UK No. 3 hit single on the UK Singles Chart in mid-1978 and number 3 in Australia.

==Overview==
The duo comprised keyboard player Julian Marshall and vocalist and bass player Kit Hain, who met while they were pupils at Dartington Hall School.

&quot;Dancing in the City&quot;, written by both members, was also a hit in Europe and Australia, where it spent 24 weeks in the Australian Charts during August through to December 1978, peaking at 3. In the United States the song reached No. 43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in the winter of early 1979. &quot;Dancing in the City&quot; also climbed to the top of the South African singles charts that same year, receiving extensive airplay and was included on Vol 5 of the long-running compilation album series &quot;Pop Shop&quot;.

They followed this up with the ballad &quot;Coming Home&quot;, which reached No. 39 in the UK Singles Chart later that year. Both singles were on the Harvest record label. &quot;Coming Home&quot; was backed by strings and fretless bass, and they released an album entitled &quot;Free Ride&quot;. In 1979 they called it quits. &quot;Free Ride&quot; peaked at number 56 in Australia.

Hain continued pursuing a recording career and released two albums in the UK: 1981&#x27;s &quot;Spirits Walking Out&quot;, which included a minor hit &quot;Danny&quot;, and 1983&#x27;s &quot;School For Spies&quot;. She also had songs recorded by the Who&#x27;s lead singer Roger Daltrey (four songs on three albums), Kiki Dee, and Barbara Dickson, before moving to the US in 1985. There she concentrated on her songwriting. She has written with Aimee Mann (&quot;RIP in Heaven&quot; and &quot;Crash and Burn&quot; on Til Tuesday&#x27;s &quot;Everything&#x27;s Different Now&quot; album), Heart and Cyndi Lauper, and had songs recorded by Peter Cetera and Chaka Khan (the top 5 AC hit &quot;Feels Like Heaven&quot; written with Mark Goldenberg), Cher (&quot;Fires of Eden&quot; also written with Goldenberg and recorded by Judy Collins), Fleetwood Mac (&quot;Winds of Change&quot;), as well many other recording artists, garnering chart success worldwide. Her songs also have been licensed for use in MTV&#x27;s &quot;The Hills&quot; as well as network shows including &quot;The Unit&quot; and &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. She also released a third solo album, &quot;Cry Freedom&quot;, in Belgium in 1995 (Tempo/EMI). In 2012 she started a career as an author under her married name, Kit Grindstaff.

Marshall stayed in the UK and became a member of the Flying Lizards, who had a top 10 hit in both the UK and Australia with their cover of &quot;Money (That&#x27;s What I Want)&quot; in 1979. The song reached No. 50 in the U.S.

Marshall later formed the duo Eye to Eye with singer-songwriter Deborah Berg. Eye to Eye released a single called &quot;Am I Normal?&quot; which was written by Marshall and Berg. This failed to chart in the UK although their song &quot;Nice Girls&quot; charted in the U.S., reaching No. 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the summer of 1982. A second song, &quot;Lucky,&quot; reached No. 88 in the U.S. during the autumn of 1983.

&quot;Am I Normal?&quot; was covered by David (real name Virginia David) in 1983 on the Stiletto record label. It was produced by Andy Hill, but also failed to chart in the UK, despite being playlisted on BBC Radio 1.

<text>Merlin Theodore Minshall (21 December 1906 – 3 September 1987) was a British naval officer and adventurer. He is often claimed to have been one of the inspirations behind James Bond, the fictional spy created by Ian Fleming. Minshall worked for Fleming during the Second World War, as a member of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Naval Intelligence Division.

==Life==
Son of Colonel Thomas Herbert Minshall, DSO (1873–1872), a well known consultant electrical engineer and newspaper proprietor and Theodora Minshall née Wigham-Richardson (1871–1932), who worked for the British Secret Service during the First World War. He was educated at Charterhouse and University College, Oxford. Upon graduation Minshall trained as an architect at London University, before embarking on his boat the &quot;Hawke&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Sperwer&quot;, which is Dutch for Hawke, and on display in the Netherlands in the indoor museum of the Zuiderzee Museum in Enkhuizen) on his quest to be the first Englishman to sail across Europe to the Black Sea. Minshall acquired the &quot;Hawke&quot; in Bosham, from Gerald Hulse in 1931 in exchange for a sports car. Hulse had only purchased the &quot;Hawke&quot; the year before from Dr. Marmaduke Fawkes who had owned the boat since 1926, having brought it over from the Netherlands. Minshall was accompanied by his first wife, Elizabeth, but they separated during this trip and were later divorced.

The subsequent encounter with the German agent, Lisa Kaltenbrunner came while sailing down the River Danube. She hitched a lift on his yacht – but it was no coincidence. She had been sent to discover whether he was charting the river and investigating oil storage depots for British intelligence. Having seduced him, she attempted to poison him, but Minshall survived, and the knowledge he had gained did indeed prove useful to the British in a subsequent operation during the war.

Minshall was also well known as an amateur racing driver, who specialised in the kind of road races that are generally illegal today. A two time competitor in the Monte Carlo rally, his greatest triumph came in 1937, when he was presented with a trophy by Benito Mussolini for winning the 1937 Italian Foreign Challenge Trophy – a three-day, 4,000-mile road race between Rome and Sicily. It involved over 400 cars, and led to the death of four drivers. He also was the first man to drive an air cooled vehicle north to south across the Sahara desert.

At the outbreak of World War II, he was recalled to duty as part of the RNVR where he had a varied career, including working for Ian Fleming. Initially he was a watchkeeper in the Admiralty operations room in London. In early 1940 he was a major participant in the failed scheme to block the Danube in Rumania to disrupt German oil imports, working under diplomatic cover as British Vice Consul in Bucharest. Later, in November 1940, leading a joint NID/SOE team Minshall ran Operation Shamrock, where a commandeered fishing smack was used as an observation platform for monitoring German U-boat traffic in the Gironde estuary. Minshall was Mentioned in Dispatches for his part commanding that operation.

Subsequently, he ran a section at HMS &quot;Flowerdown&quot;, using direction finding and transmitter analysis (&quot;Z machines&quot;) to identify the positions of individual ships. As such, during May 1941 he played a part in the hunt for the &quot;Bismarck&quot;. Posted to Fiji, he managed to get his posting changed to New Zealand, where he worked on various intelligence projects, including establishing a Z machine intercept station at Rapuara near Blenheim. Recalled to the UK, he was landed in occupied Yugoslavia as officer in charge of the Allied Naval Mission to Tito in Yugoslavia.

Minshall was married four times, the first to Elizabeth Dorothy Magdalene Loveday, from whom he was divorced in 1935. His second wife was Isolde Llewellyn, his third Janine Paulette Sergent of Lyons and fourth Christina Marjorie Zambra, great niece of the Scottish artist Harrington Mann, with whom he had four sons Peter, Matthew, Luke and Timothy.

==Autobiography==
Minshall wrote about his life in a book entitled &quot;Guilt-Edged&quot;, published in 1975. Its content is summed up by Len Deighton in the foreword:

&quot;His mother was an spy in World War I. Ian Fleming was his boss throughout the Second World War. Unwittingly sucked into the world of Nazi espionage during an innocent sailing trip, he was seduced by a lovely but lethal German agent and met Field Marshal Göring face to face. He was the first man to cross the Sahara on a motorcycle and while travelling through the Congo, he accidentally discovered a secret German army. But Romania set the scene for the height of espionage activity – when he single handedly pirated a ship from under Nazi eyes and blew up a vital link in German tanker communications. The man is Merlin Minshall and this is his unique story.&quot;

<text>In electrical engineering, a function generator is usually a piece of electronic test equipment or software used to generate different types of electrical waveforms over a wide range of frequencies. Some of the most common waveforms produced by the function generator are the sine wave, square wave, triangular wave and sawtooth shapes. These waveforms can be either repetitive or single-shot (which requires an internal or external trigger source). Another feature included on many function generators is the ability to add a DC offset. Integrated circuits used to generate waveforms may also be described as function generator ICs.

Although function generators cover both audio and radio frequencies, they are usually not suitable for applications that need low distortion or stable frequency signals. When those traits are required, other signal generators would be more appropriate.

Some function generators can be phase-locked to an external signal source (which may be a frequency reference) or another function generator.

Function generators are used in the development, test and repair of electronic equipment. For example, they may be used as a signal source to test amplifiers or to introduce an error signal into a control loop. Function generators are primarily used for working with analog circuits, related pulse generators are primarily used for working with digital circuits.

== Electronic instruments ==

=== Principles of Operation ===
Simple function generators usually generate triangular waveform whose frequency can be controlled smoothly as well as in steps. This triangular wave is used as the basis for all of its other outputs. The triangular wave is generated by repeatedly charging and discharging a capacitor from a constant current source. This produces a linearly ascending and descending voltage ramp. As the output voltage reaches upper or lower limits, the charging or discharging is reversed using a comparator, producing the linear triangle wave. By varying the current and the size of the capacitor, different frequencies may be obtained. Sawtooth waves can be produced by charging the capacitor slowly with low current, but using a diode over the current source to discharge quickly - the polarity of the diode changes the polarity of the resulting sawtooth, i.e. slow rise and fast fall, or fast rise and slow fall.

A 50% duty cycle square wave is easily obtained by noting whether the capacitor is being charged or discharged, which is reflected in the current switching comparator output. Other duty cycles (theoretically from 0% to 100%) can be obtained by using a comparator and the sawtooth or triangle signal. Most function generators also contain a non-linear diode shaping circuit that can convert the triangle wave into a reasonably accurate sine wave by rounding off the corners of the triangle wave in a process similar to clipping in audio systems.

A walking ring counter, also called a Johnson counter, and a (linear) resistor-only shaping circuit is an alternative way to produce an approximation of a sine wave.
This is perhaps the simplest numerically-controlled oscillator.
Two such walking ring counters are perhaps the simplest way to generate the continuous-phase frequency-shift keying
used in dual-tone multi-frequency signaling and early modem tones.

A typical function generator can provide frequencies up to 20 MHz. RF generators for higher frequencies are not function generators in the strict sense since they typically produce pure or modulated sine signals only.

Function generators, like most signal generators, may also contain an attenuator, various means of modulating the output waveform, and often the ability to automatically and repetitively &quot;sweep&quot; the frequency of the output waveform (by means of a voltage-controlled oscillator) between two operator-determined limits. This capability makes it very easy to evaluate the frequency response of a given electronic circuit.

Some function generators can also generate white or pink noise.

More advanced function generators are called arbitrary waveform generators (AWG). They use direct digital synthesis (DDS) techniques to generate any waveform that can be described by a table of amplitudes and time steps.

=== Specifications ===
Typical specifications for a general-purpose function generator are:
* Produces sine, square, triangular, sawtooth (ramp), and pulse output. Arbitrary waveform generators can produce waves of any shape.
* It can generate a wide range of frequencies. For example, the Tektronix FG 502 (ca 1974) covers 0.1 Hz to 11 MHz.
* Frequency stability of 0.1 percent per hour for analog generators or for a digital generator.
* Maximum sinewave distortion of about 1% (accuracy of diode shaping network) for analog generators. Arbitrary waveform generators may have distortion less than below and less than above 
* Some function generators can be phase locked to an external signal source, which may be a frequency reference or another function generator.
* Amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), or phase modulation (PM) may be supported.
* Output amplitude up to peak-to-peak.
* Amplitude can be modified, usually by a calibrated attenuator with decade steps and continuous adjustment within each decade.
* Some generators provide a DC offset voltage, e.g. adjustable between -5V to +5V.
* An output impedance of .

=== Software ===
A completely different approach to function generation is to use software instructions to generate a waveform, with provision for output. For example, a general-purpose digital computer can be used to generate the waveform; if frequency range and amplitude are acceptable, the sound card fitted to most computers can be used to output the generated wave.

== Circuit elements ==

===Waveform generator===
An electronic circuit element used for generating waveforms within other apparatus that can be used in communications and instrumentation circuits, and also in a function generator instrument. Examples are the Exar XR2206 and , which can generate sine, square, triangle, ramp, and pulse waveforms at a voltage-controllable frequency.

===Function generator===
An electronic circuit element that provides an output proportional to some mathematical function (such as the square root) of its input; such devices are used in feedback control systems and in analog computers. Examples are the Raytheon QK329 square-law tube and the Intersil ICL8048 Log/Antilog Amplifier.

<text>Mary Brown&#x27;s Centre (formerly Mile One Centre) is an indoor arena and entertainment venue located in downtown St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The arena opened in May, 2001, replacing Memorial Stadium. At full capacity the arena can seat 7,000 people.

The arena is currently home to the Newfoundland Rogues of the BSL, the St. John&#x27;s Jr. Caps of the SJJHL, the St. John&#x27;s Sr. Caps of the AESHL, and the future home of the Newfoundland Regiment of the QMJHL.

==Naming rights==
During construction, the City of St. John&#x27;s sold the naming rights to brewing company Molson under a 10-year deal valued at $1.5 million. The agreement would have also included rights to be the venue&#x27;s exclusive beer supplier. Molson then resold the naming rights to Danny Williams, then-owner of Cable Atlantic, for $600,000. Before the arena opened, however, Williams sold Cable Atlantic to Rogers Communications in order to pursue politics, but retained the naming rights personally. Ultimately Williams chose to name the arena Mile One Centre, based on St. John&#x27;s being the easternmost city in Canada.

On October 14, 2021, it was announced that the naming rights to the arena had been bought by the Newfoundland-originated fried chicken restaurant chain Mary Brown&#x27;s; it was rebranded as Mary Brown&#x27;s Centre on November 5, 2021.

==Sports==
===Hockey===

The building was originally home to the St. John&#x27;s Maple Leafs of the American Hockey League. The Leafs played out of the centre from 2001 to 2005 before relocating to Toronto, Ontario to become the Toronto Marlies. Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment (MLSE) stated that the relocation was necessary to better monitor prospects for the co-owned Toronto Maple Leafs.

The Dobbin family were granted an expansion Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) franchise in 2004 to be later named the St. John&#x27;s Fog Devils. The Fog Devils began playing at Mile One Centre in 2005. However, the Fog Devils would relocate to Verdun, Quebec, after three seasons in St. John&#x27;s to become the Montreal Junior Hockey Club. Many reasons were attributed to the Fog Devils&#x27; demise including lack of fan support, a poor lease agreement and high travel costs. The Fog Devils&#x27; departure left Mile One Centre without a major tenant for the first time since the building opened.

Professional hockey returned to St. John&#x27;s in 2011 when Winnipeg-based True North Sports and Entertainment announced a lease agreement with former Newfoundland and Labrador premier Danny Williams that saw their AHL franchise (formerly known as the Manitoba Moose) relocated to the Mile One Centre. The St. John&#x27;s IceCaps played their inaugural season in 2011–12 and as the minor league affiliate of True North&#x27;s National Hockey League team, the Winnipeg Jets. In honour of this development, the Kraft Hockeyville pre-season game between the Jets and the Ottawa Senators (which was originally to be held in Conception Bay when announced as it was prior to the relocation of the Atlanta Thrashers to become the Jets, causing the Moose to become the IceCaps) was moved to the Mile One Centre. In March 2015, it was announced that the Jets would move their AHL team from St. John&#x27;s back to Winnipeg as the Moose in 2015–16. The IceCaps&#x27; organization was then able to get the Montreal Canadiens&#x27; AHL team, the Hamilton Bulldogs, to relocate to St. John&#x27;s for the start of the 2015–16 season, retaining the IceCaps name. However, this was only a temporary move while the Canadiens built a rink for their AHL team in Laval, Quebec. In 2017, the Canadiens-owned franchise left and became the Laval Rocket.

In 2018, after a year without a hockey tenant at Mile One, St. John&#x27;s was granted an ECHL expansion team with the Newfoundland Growlers. The Growlers won the Kelly Cup championship in their inaugural season. On October 27, 2021, the Growlers were evicted from the arena citing workplace misconduct by the ownership of the team, Deacon Sports and Entertainment (DSE), and the Growlers had to play their first six home games of the 2021–22 season in nearby Conception Bay South. The city and DSE came to an agreement for the team to return in November 2021. The Growlers ceased operations on April 2, 2024, due to failing to fulfill the ECHL&#x27;s league bylaws as well as financial reasons, leaving the arena again without a hockey tenant.

In 2024, the QMJHL announced that the Acadie–Bathurst Titan will relocate to St. John&#x27;s for the 2025–26 season.

===Basketball===
After long negotiations, the arena became the home to the St. John&#x27;s Edge of the National Basketball League of Canada beginning with the 2017–18 season bringing professional basketball to St. John&#x27;s. On July 15, 2021, the St. John&#x27;s Edge were removed from Mile One when the city did not renew the lease with the team to play in the arena, opting to grant a lease to a different ownership group with an American Basketball Association franchise.

===Other sporting events===
The arena hosts the annual Herder Memorial Trophy tournament, the largest hockey tournament in the province. It hosted the 2002 AHL All-Star Game and the 2014 AHL All-Star Game in which the AHL All-Stars faced Färjestad BK of the Swedish Hockey League.

On September 22, 2014, Mile One Centre held two split squad preseason games for the Ottawa Senators vs. the New York Islanders. New York won both games 3–2, the latter game on a shootout. The Senators faced the Carolina Hurricanes at Mile One for another preseason game on September 27, 2015.

In October 2003, the arena was to host an NBA pre-season game between the Toronto Raptors and Cleveland Cavaliers, with lineups featuring NBA All-Star Vince Carter and an 18 year old rookie making his NBA debut by the name of LeBron James. Both teams suited up and took pre-game warm-ups, but an unseasonably warm day in St. John&#x27;s led to excess condensation inside the arena and pooling of moisture on the court, leading Raptors General Manager Glen Grunwald to take a microphone to centre court and announce the game would be cancelled in front of a sold-out crowd.

Other hosted sporting events include:
* 2004 World U-17 Hockey Challenge
* 2005 Skate Canada International
* 2005 Scott Tournament of Hearts
* 2008 5th World Junior Street &amp; Ball Hockey Championship
* During the 2010-2011 hockey season, Hockey Canada used the arena as host venue for the Four Nations Cup and the Telus Cup.

The arena hosted the 2017 Tim Hortons Brier, the Canadian men&#x27;s curling championship.

==Other events==
The 2002 Juno Awards were presented at Mary Brown&#x27;s Centre on April 14, 2002, marking the first time the presentation had been hosted outside of Ontario or British Columbia. The arena subsequently hosted the 2010 Juno Awards.

Mary Brown&#x27;s Centre was the main venue for the third annual Avalon Expo sci-fi/comics/pop-culture convention on August 25–27, 2017.

The first musical act to play at Mile One Centre was Live in 2001. Over the years the venue has hosted many concerts, including: Nickelback, Alanis Morissette, The Tragically Hip, B. B. King, Our Lady Peace, Joe Cocker, Backstreet Boys, Bryan Adams, Barenaked Ladies, Blue Rodeo, Gordon Lightfoot, Billy Talent, Simple Plan, Elton John, Feist, Neil Young, Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, Pearl Jam, Bachman &amp; Turner, Celtic Thunder, Leonard Cohen, Journey, Sting, Tegan and Sara, Sarah McLachlan, Carly Rae Jepsen, Hedley, Bob Dylan, Jackson Browne, James Taylor, and Hilary Duff.

<text>Mount Nimba () is a mountain along the border of Guinea, Ivory Coast and Liberia in West Africa. The summit is on the border of Guinea and Ivory Coast and at is the highest peak for both countries and of the Nimba Range. The mountain is part of the Guinea Highlands, which straddles the borders between the three countries. The nearest major settlements are the town Yekepa in Liberia and the towns of Bossou and N&#x27;Zoo in Guinea.

== Toponymy ==
The mountain is named after the French geographer Jacques Richard-Molard, who died in an accident at the mountain site in 1951. Before that it was called Mount Nouon.

== Geology ==
The mountain is rich in iron ore and cobalt. The mix of iron rich quartzite sheets, schists and granite gneiss have characterised the geological pedogenesis.

== Conservation ==
Mount Richard-Molard lies within the Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve, which currently covers 17,540 hectares and straddles the borders of Guinea and Ivory Coast.

== World Heritage status ==
Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve is a site with outstanding universal value and was therefore nominated to the World Heritage List in 1981. It has been listed as World Heritage in Danger since 1992.

This site was added to Guinea&#x27;s &quot;Tentative List&quot; for consideration for UNESCO World Heritage Site status on 29 March 2001, in the cultural category.

Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve has been listed as a World Heritage Site in both Guinea and Ivory Coast, under the criteria for natural heritage.

<doc id="1198216" wikidata="Q5400688" url="?curid=1198216" title="Estate planning">
<text>Estate planning is the process of anticipating and arranging for the management and disposal of a person&#x27;s estate during the person&#x27;s life in preparation for future incapacity or death. The planning includes the bequest of assets to heirs, loved ones, and/or charity, and may include minimizing gift, estate, and generation-skipping transfer taxes. Estate planning includes planning for incapacity, reducing or eliminating uncertainties over the administration of a probate, and maximizing the value of the estate by reducing taxes and other expenses. The ultimate goal of estate planning can only be determined by the specific goals of the estate owner, and may be as simple or complex as the owner&#x27;s wishes and needs directs. Guardians are often designated for minor children and beneficiaries with incapacity.

==Devices==
Estate planning may involve a will, trusts, beneficiary designations, powers of appointment, property ownership (for example, joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entirety), gifts, and powers of attorney (specifically a durable financial power of attorney and a durable medical power of attorney).

More sophisticated estate plans may cover deferring or decreasing estate taxes or business succession.

===Wills===

Wills are a common estate planning tool, and are usually the simplest device for planning the distribution of an estate. It must be created and executed in compliance with the laws of the jurisdiction where it is created. If probate proceedings occur in a different jurisdiction, it is important to ensure that the will complies with the laws of that jurisdiction, or that the jurisdiction will follow the provisions of a valid out-of-state will even if those provisions might be invalid for a will executed in that jurisdiction.

=== Trusts ===
A trust may be used as an estate planning tool to direct the distribution of assets after the person who creates the trust passes away or becomes incapacitated. Trusts may be used to provide for the distribution of funds for the benefit of minor children or developmentally disabled children. For example, a spendthrift trust may be used to prevent wasteful spending by a spendthrift child, or a special needs trust may be used for developmentally disabled children or adults. Trusts offer a high degree of control over management and disposition of assets. Furthermore, certain types of trust provisions can provide for the management of wealth for several generations past the settlor. Typically referred to as dynasty planning, these types of trust provisions allow for the protection of wealth for several generations after a person&#x27;s death.

=== Advance directives ===
An estate plan may include the creation of advance directives, which are documents that direct what will happen to a person&#x27;s personal care if the person becomes legally incapacitated. For example, an estate plan may include a healthcare proxy, durable power of attorney, and living will.

After widespread litigation and media coverage surrounding the Terri Schiavo case, estate planning attorneys often advise clients to also create a living will, which is a form of an advance directive. Specific final arrangements, such as whether to be buried or cremated, are also often part of estate plan documents.

==Tax==
Income, gift, estate, and generation-skipping transfer tax planning plays a significant role in choosing the structure and vehicles used to create an estate plan.

In the United States, assets left to a spouse who is a U.S. citizen or any qualified charity are not subject to U.S. Federal estate tax. Assets left to any other heir, including the decedent&#x27;s children, may be taxed if that portion of the estate has a value in excess of the lifetime gift, estate, and generation-skipping transfer tax exemption amount. As of 2023, the federal exemption amount was $12,920,000. For a married couple, the combined exemption is $25,840,000.

=== Tax strategies ===
One way to minimize or avoid U.S. Federal gift, estate and generation-skipping transfer taxes is to distribute the property in incremental gifts during the person&#x27;s lifetime. Individuals may give away as much as $17,000 per year (in 2023) to another person without incurring gift tax or using up any of their lifetime exemption amount. Other tax-free alternatives include paying tuition expenses or medical expenses free of gift tax, but only if the payments are made directly to the educational institution or medical provider.

Other tax-advantaged alternatives to leaving property, outside of a will, include qualified or non-qualified retirement plans (e.g. 401(k) plans and IRAs) certain &quot;trustee&quot; bank accounts, transfer on death (or TOD) financial accounts, and life insurance proceeds.

Because life insurance proceeds generally are not taxed for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, a life insurance trust could be used to pay estate taxes. However, if the decedent holds any incidents of ownership like the ability to remove or change a beneficiary, the proceeds will be treated as part of decedent&#x27;s estate and generally will be subject to the U.S. Federal estate tax. For this reason, a trust vehicle often is used to own the life insurance policy. The trust must be irrevocable to avoid taxation of the life insurance proceeds, and it typically called an irrevocable life insurance trust (or ILIT).

==Probate==

Countries whose legal systems evolved from the British common law system, like the United States, typically use the probate system for distributing property at death. Probate is a process where
#the decedent&#x27;s purported will, if any, is entered in court,
#after hearing evidence from the representative of the estate, the court decides if the will is valid,
#a personal representative is appointed by the court as a fiduciary to gather and take control of the estate&#x27;s assets,
#known and unknown creditors are notified (through direct notice or publication in the media) to file any claims against the estate,
#claims are paid out (if funds remain) in the order or priority governed by state statute,
#remaining funds are distributed to beneficiaries named in the will, or heirs (next-of-kin) if there is no will, and
#the probate judge closes out the estate.

===Probate avoidance===
Due to the time and expenses associated with the traditional probate process, modern estate planners frequently counsel clients to enact probate avoidance strategies. Some common probate-avoidance strategies include:
#revocable living trusts (sometimes called revocable inter vivos trusts),
#joint ownership of assets and naming death beneficiaries,
#making lifetime gifts, and
#purchasing life insurance.

If a revocable living trust is used as a part of an estate plan, the key to probate avoidance is ensuring that the living trust is &quot;funded&quot; during the lifetime of the person establishing the trust. After executing a trust agreement, the settlor should ensure that all assets are properly re-registered in the name of the living trust. If assets (especially higher value assets and real estate) remain outside of a trust, then a probate proceeding may be necessary to transfer the asset to the trust upon the death of the testator.

===Designation of a beneficiary===
Although legal restrictions may apply, it is broadly possible to convey property outside of probate, through such tools as a living trust, forms of joint property ownership that include a right of survivorship, payable on death account, or beneficiary designation on a financial account or insurance policy. Beneficiary designations are considered distributions under the law of contracts and cannot be changed by statements or provisions outside of the contract, such as a clause in a will.

In the United States, without a beneficiary statement, the default provision in the contract or custodian-agreement (for an IRA) will apply, which may be the estate of the owner resulting in higher taxes and extra fees. Generally, beneficiary designations are made for life insurance policies, employee benefits, (including retirement plans and group life insurance) and Individual Retirement Accounts. 
*Identity: A specific, identifiable individual or business must be designated as beneficiary for life insurance policies. Businesses may not be the beneficiary of a group life insurance policy or a retirement plan.
*Contingent beneficiary: If the primary beneficiary predeceases the contract owner, the contingent beneficiary becomes the designated beneficiary. If a contingent beneficiary is not named, the default provision in the contract or custodian-agreement applies.
*Death: For retirement plan assets, at the account owner&#x27;s death, the primary beneficiary may select his or her own beneficiaries if the remaining balance will be paid out over time. There is no obligation to retain the contingent beneficiary designated by the IRA owner.
*Multiple accounts: A policy owner or retirement account owner can designate multiple beneficiaries. However, retirement plans governed by ERISA provide protections for spouses of account holders that prevent the disinheritance of a living spouse.

===Mediation===
Mediation serves as an alternative to a full-scale litigation to settle disputes. At a mediation, family members and beneficiaries discuss plans on transfer of assets. Because of the potential conflicts associated with blended families, step siblings, and multiple marriages, creating an estate plan through mediation allows people to confront the issues head-on and design a plan that will minimize the chance of future family conflict and meet their financial goals.

==Worldwide==

=== Malaysia ===
In West Malaysia and Sarawak, wills are governed by the Wills Act 1959. In Sabah, the Will Ordinance (Sabah Cap. 158) applies. The Wills Act 1959 and the Wills Ordinance applies to non-Muslims only. Section 2(2) of the Wills Act 1959 states that the Act does not apply to wills of persons professing the religion of Islam. For Muslims, inheritance will be governed under Syariah Law where one would need to prepare Syariah compliant Islamic instruments for succession.

Section 2 of the Wills Act 1959 defines a will as a &#x27;declaration intended to have legal effect of the intentions of a testator with respect to his property or other matters which he desires to be carried into effect after his death and includes a testament, a codicil and an appointment by will or by writing in the nature of a will in exercise of a power and also a disposition by will or testament of the guardianship, custody and tuition of any child&#x27;.

==== Validity ====
In Malaysia, a person writing a will must comply with the formalities stated in Section 5 of the Wills Act 1959 in order for the will to be valid and effective.

Under the Wills Act 1959, the youngest age to write a Will is when he/she is 18 years old, whereas for Sabah, it is 21 years old. At the time of signing a Will, the testator as the maker of the Will, must have sound mind which means he/she must be fully aware of the document he/she is signing is a Will, understand the contents of his/her Will and is not intoxicated by drugs or any mental illness affecting his/her mental capacity. At the time of signing, he must not be under duress or undue influence. In addition, when the Will is signed by the testator, there must be at least two witnesses who are at least 18 years old, of sound mind and they are not visually impaired. The role of the witnesses is only to attest that the testator signed his/her Will.

#. The Will must be made in written form. No will shall be valid unless it is in writing and executed in the manner provided in section 5(2) of the Wills Act 1959.
# Testator must be at the age of majority. The testator must be at least 18 years old as stipulated under the Age of Majority Act 1971 in Peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak, whereas in Sabah, the age of majority is 21 years old as stated under Section 4 of the Wills Ordinance 1953.
# Signing of Will. The Will must be attested by two or more witnesses in the presence of the testator and each other. A beneficiary or his/her spouse cannot be a witness to the will. No beneficiary or his/her spouse will be entitled to receive any devise, legacy, estate, interest, gift or appointment if the beneficiary or his/her spouse is the attesting witness to the will.
# Sound Mind. The testator must be of &#x27;sound mind&#x27; (&quot;testamentary capacity&quot;) as provided by Section 3 of the Wills Act 1959. If the testator is ill or of old age, it is advisable to obtain a letter from the medical practitioner stating that the testator is of sound mind and not under the influence of any medication.

==== Revocation of the Will ====

# Marriage: marriage will revoke a will made earlier by the testator unless it was expressed in the will that it was made in contemplation of marriage, and shall not be revoked by the solemnisation of the marriage contemplated to the named fiancé(e).
# Writing a new will: only the latest will would be recognised as the valid one by the courts
# Declaration in writing of an intention to revoke the will: the testator makes a written statement about their intention to revoke the will. The said statement has to be signed by the testator in the presence of two witnesses.
# Conversion to the Islamic faith: Section 2(2) of the Wills Act 1959 states that the Act does not apply to wills of persons professing the religion of Islam. When the testator (previously a non-Muslim) embraces the Islamic faith, the will made previously shall be void as it no longer comes under the ambit of the Wills Act 1959. The testator, after conversion, can write a new will in accordance with the Islamic Laws whereby only one third of the total estate can be disposed of by way of a will, and the remaining two thirds by Sijil Faraid (a certificate of Muslim inheritance law). If the Muslim testator would like to dispose of more than one third of their total estate, the consent of all lawful beneficiaries must be obtained.
# Intentional destruction: pursuant to Section 14 of the Wills Act of Malaysia a will can be burnt, torn or otherwise intentionally destroyed by the testator or a third party in the presence of the testator and under their direction, with the intention to revoke the will. Accidental or malicious destruction by a third party does not render the revocation effective.

====Intestate succession====

If a person dies without a will, the Distribution Act 1958 (which was amended in 1997) applies. It provides for a list of heirs who are entitled and this is best shown in the table below:
=== Canada ===

Inheritance law in Canada is constitutionally a provincial matter. Therefore, the laws governing inheritance in Canada is legislated by each individual province. 

=== United States ===
In the United States, the process of estate planning is regulated. The U.S. law of estate planning overlaps to some degree with elder law, which additionally includes other provisions such as long-term care.

<doc id="1198223" wikidata="Q4533553" url="?curid=1198223" title="Jubilee Issue">
<text>The postage and revenue stamps of the United Kingdom issued in 1887 are known as the &quot;Jubilee&quot; issue because they were issued during the year of the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria to the throne in 1837. They continued in use throughout the remainder of Victoria&#x27;s reign, and many of the designs were reused in the stamps of Edward VII. The Jubilee issue includes the first British stamps to be printed in two colours.

==Origins==
The variety of colours and designs was partly in response to the much-disliked &quot;Lilac and Green&quot; issues of 1883-1884. The 1884 Stamp Committee was formed to make decisions about improved replacements. After several meetings, and considering a number of essays by De La Rue (many of which survive in the marketplace), they produced a report recommending the use of surface printing, two colours in fugitive inks, coloured paper, and the dropping of the corner letters that had distinguished stamps on the sheet.

==Issue==
The 1887 issue generally followed the Committee&#x27;s recommendations and the d, d, 2d, d, 3d, 4d, 5d, 6d, 9d and 1s values were put on sale 1 January 1887. A 10d value followed on 24 February 1890 and the d value on 15 September 1892. The stamps continued in use largely unchanged, though specialists identify shade variations, to the end of the century. From 17 April 1900, the halfpenny value was reprinted in blue-green, and the one-shilling value went to a two-colour scheme of carmine rose and green from 11 July 1900.

==Values==
Because of the lengthy period of use, the lower values of the issue are still quite common today and used copies are worth only a few pennies. Higher values generally rise in price according to the denomination, topped by an unmounted mint 1-shilling value, at about £150.

==Errors==

There are many known errors of this issue:
*The d exists with printing on the gummed side, with double impressions and imperforate.
*The d exists with the purple part of the design printed twice.
*The d can be found with printing on the gummed side and missing the &#x27;d&#x27; in the value.

The d, the d, the 2d, the d, the 3d, the 4d and the 10d all exist imperforate.

As well as this, all the stamps can be found with their watermarks inverted and with a &quot;SPECIMEN&quot; overprint. Most of the stamps in this issue can be found with slight colour variations and two different dies also exist.

<text>Gliese 876 is a red dwarf star away from Earth in the constellation of Aquarius. It is one of the closest known stars to the Sun confirmed to possess a planetary system with more than two planets, after GJ 1061, YZ Ceti, Tau Ceti, and Wolf 1061; as of 2018, four extrasolar planets have been found to orbit the star. The planetary system is also notable for the orbital properties of its planets. It is the only known system of orbital companions to exhibit a near-triple conjunction in the rare phenomenon of Laplace resonance (a type of resonance first noted in Jupiter&#x27;s inner three Galilean moons). It is also the first extrasolar system around a normal star with measured coplanarity. While planets b and c are located in the system&#x27;s habitable zone, they are giant planets believed to be analogous to Jupiter.

==Distance and visibility==
Gliese 876 is located fairly close to the Solar System. According to astrometric measurements made by the Gaia space observatory, the star shows a parallax of 214.038 milliarcseconds, which corresponds to a distance of . Despite being located so close to Earth, the star is so faint that it is invisible to the naked eye and can only be seen using a telescope.

==Stellar characteristics==

As a red dwarf, Gliese 876 is much less massive than the Sun: estimates suggest it has only 35% of the mass of the Sun. The surface temperature of Gliese 876 is cooler than the Sun and the star has a smaller radius. These factors combine to make the star only 1.3% as luminous as the Sun, and most of this is at infrared wavelengths. Estimating the age and metallicity of cool stars is difficult due to the formation of diatomic molecules in their atmospheres, which makes the spectrum extremely complex. By fitting the observed spectrum to model spectra, it is estimated that Gliese 876 has a slightly lower abundance of heavy elements compared to the Sun (around 75% the solar abundance of iron). Based on chromospheric activity the star is likely to be around 6.5 to 9.9 billion years old, depending on the theoretical model used. However, its membership among the young disk population suggest that the star is less than 5 billion years old but the long rotational period of the star implies that it is at least older than 100 million years. Like many low-mass stars, Gliese 876 is a variable star, classified as a BY Draconis variable. Its brightness fluctuates by around 0.04 magnitudes. This type of variability is thought to be caused by large starspots moving in and out of view as the star rotates. Gliese 876 emits X-rays, as most Red Dwarfs do.

The variability of the star&#x27;s brightness was first detected by Edward W. Weis. It was given its variable star designation, IL Aquarii, in 1997.

==Planetary system==

===Observation history===

On June 23, 1998, an extrasolar planet was announced in orbit around Gliese 876 by two independent teams led by Geoffrey Marcy and Xavier Delfosse. The planet was designated Gliese 876 b and was detected by Doppler spectroscopy. Based on luminosity measurement, the circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ) is believed to be located between 0.116 and 0.227 AU. On January 9, 2001, a second planet designated Gliese 876 c was detected, inside the orbit of the previously-discovered planet. The relationship between the orbital periods initially disguised the planet&#x27;s radial velocity signature as an increased orbital eccentricity of the outer planet. Eugenio Rivera and Jack Lissauer found that the two planets undergo strong gravitational interactions as they orbit the star, causing the orbital elements to change rapidly. On June 13, 2005, further observations by a team led by Rivera revealed a third planet, designated Gliese 876 d inside the orbits of the two Jupiter-size planets. In January 2009, the mutual inclination between planets b and c was determined using a combination of radial velocity and astrometric measurements. The planets were found to be almost coplanar, with an angle of only 5.0° between their orbital planes.

On June 23, 2010, astronomers announced a fourth planet, designated Gliese 876 e. This discovery better constrained the mass and orbital properties of the other three planets, including the high eccentricity of the innermost planet. This also filled out the system inside e&#x27;s orbit; additional planets there would be unstable at this system&#x27;s age. In 2014, reanalysis of the existing radial velocities suggested the possible presence of two additional planets, which would have almost the same mass as Gliese 876 d, but further analysis showed that these signals were artifacts of dynamical interactions between the known planets. In 2018 a study using hundreds of new radial velocity measurements found no evidence for any additional planets. If this system has a comet disc, it is not &quot;brighter than the fractional dust luminosity 10−5&quot; according to a 2012 Herschel study. None of these planets transit the star from the perspective of Earth, making it difficult to study their properties.

GJ 876 is a candidate parent system for the ʻOumuamua object. The trajectory of this interstellar object took it near the star about 820,000 years ago with a velocity of 5 km/s, after which it has been perturbed by six other stars.

===Orbital arrangement===
Gliese 876 has a notable orbital arrangement. It is the first planetary system around a normal star to have mutual inclination between planets measured without transits (previously the mutual inclination of the planets orbiting the pulsar PSR B1257+12 had been determined by measuring their gravitational interactions). Later measurements reduced the value of the mutual inclination, and in the latest four-planet models the incorporation mutual inclinations does not result in significant improvements relative to coplanar solutions. The system has the second known example of a Laplace resonance with a 1:2:4 resonance of its planets. The first known example was Jupiter&#x27;s closest Galilean moons - Ganymede, Europa and Io. Numerical integration indicates that the coplanar, four-planet system is stable for at least another billion years. This planetary system comes close to a triple conjunction between the three outer planets once per orbit of the outermost planet.

===Planets===
The outermost three of the known planets likely formed further away from the star, and migrated inward.



; Gliese 876 d
Gliese 876 d, discovered in 2005, is the innermost known planet. With an estimated mass 6.7 times that of the Earth, it is possible that it is a dense terrestrial planet.

; Gliese 876 c

Gliese 876 c, discovered in 2001, is a 0.74 Jupiter-mass giant planet. It is in a 1:2 orbital resonance with the planet b, taking 30.104 days to orbit the star. The planet orbits within the habitable zone. Its temperature makes it more likely to be a Class III planet in the Sudarsky extrasolar planet classification. The presence of surface liquid water and life is possible on sufficiently massive satellites should they exist.

; Gliese 876 b

Gliese 876 b, discovered in 1998, is around twice the mass of Jupiter and revolves around its star in an orbit taking 61.104 days to complete, at a distance of only 0.21 AU, less than the distance from the Sun to Mercury. Its temperature makes it more likely to be a Class II or Class III planet in the Sudarsky model. The presence of surface liquid water and life is possible on sufficiently massive satellites should they exist.

; Gliese 876 e

Gliese 876 e, discovered in 2010, has a mass similar to that of the planet Uranus and its orbit takes 124 days to complete.

<text>Pearse Island is an island in western British Columbia, Canada, in the Portland Inlet, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean. The island was first charted in 1793 by George Vancouver during his 1791-95 expedition. It was named by George Henry Richards, captain of , circa 1860, in honour of William Alfred Rombulow Pearse of the Royal Navy, who had been commander of .

==Location and territorial claims==
The island is in size. It is separated from the mainland of Alaska by the wide Pearse Canal, which forms part of the Canada–United States border in this area. The island is north of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. It and neighbouring islands figured in one of the territorial and marine-boundary quarrels of the Alaska boundary dispute (the island was formerly claimed by the United States).

==Features==
The former Pearse Island Indian Reserve No. 43 is on the northeast end of the island. It is now named Wil Milit as a result of the Nisga&#x27;a Treaty and is no longer an Indian Reserve, but is fee-simple. Western LNG, a Houston-based company, with the Nisga’a Nation and Rockies LNG, is developing its first floating LNG production facility, a proposed 12-million-tonne-per-year LNG project, on the northern tip of Pearse Island near the Nisga’a village of Gingolx, British Columbia.

==Pearse Canal Island==
Pearse Canal Island is located at the southern end of the Pearse Canal, at , and is the site of a light operated by the Canadian Hydrographic Service.

<text>Class 157 &quot;Strathclyde Sprinter&quot; was the designation applied to a range of diesel multiple unit trains of the Sprinter family which were planned for regional use in the United Kingdom, in particular with the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive. As well as the class number, British Rail reserved carriage numbers in the &quot;526xx&quot; and &quot;576xx&quot; series for these units.

As the privatisation of British Rail began, the intended use of the new trains in the Strathclyde area on a range of both existing and newly reopened routes was shelved, owing to the lack of funding available for the reopenings that had been specified by the local authorities. An additional issue was Hunslet&#x27;s attempt to transfer its intellectual property rights over a number of its engineering designs to another company throughout 1994. 

In the end, the order for the new trains was cancelled and due to this the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive ended up procuring a batch of Class 170 diesel multiple units as replacements.

<text>Portland Canal is an arm of Portland Inlet, one of the principal inlets of the British Columbia Coast. It is approximately long. The Portland Canal forms part of the border between southeastern Alaska and British Columbia. The name of the entire inlet in the Nisga&#x27;a language is &quot;&quot;, with meaning &quot;at the back of (someplace)&quot;. The upper end of the inlet was home to the Tsetsaut ( in Nisgaʼa), who after being decimated by war and disease were taken under the protection of the Laxsgiik (Eagle) chief of the Nisgaʼa, who holds the inlet&#x27;s title in native law.

Despite its naming as a canal, the inlet is a fjord, a completely natural and not man-made geographic feature, and extends northward from the Portland Inlet at Pearse Island, British Columbia, to Stewart, British Columbia, and Hyder, Alaska. Observatory Inlet joins the Portland Canal at Ramsden Point, where both merge with Portland Inlet. Pearse Canal joins Portland Canal at the north end of Pearse Island.

Portland Canal was given its name by George Vancouver in 1793, in honour of William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland. The use of the word &quot;canal&quot; to name inlets on the British Columbia Coast and the Alaska Panhandle is a legacy of the Spanish exploration of the area in the 18th century. For example, Haro Strait between Victoria and the San Juan Islands was originally . The English cognate to the Spanish is &quot;channel&quot;, which is found throughout the coast, cf. Dean Channel. George Vancouver used both terms in his naming of inlets, Hood Canal for example.

The placement of the international boundary in the Portland Canal was a major issue during the negotiations over the Alaska boundary dispute, which heated up as a result of the Klondike Gold Rush and ended by arbitration in 1903. Together with Pearse Canal and Tongass Passage, the Portland Canal is defined by the Alaska Boundary Settlement (the Hay-Herbert Treaty) as part of Portland Channel (Canal), a term used as forming the marine boundary in the Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1825 but which was undefined at the time.

<doc id="1198253" wikidata="Q268666" url="?curid=1198253" title="Nass River">
<text>The Nass River is a river in northern British Columbia, Canada. It flows from the Coast Mountains southwest to Nass Bay, a sidewater of Portland Inlet, which connects to the North Pacific Ocean via the Dixon Entrance. Nass Bay joins Portland Inlet just south of Observatory Inlet.

The English name &quot;Nass&quot; is derived from the Tlingit name &quot;Naas&quot; which means &quot;intestines&quot; or &quot;guts&quot; in reference to the river&#x27;s large food capacity in its fish (Naish &amp; Story 1963; Leer, Hitch, &amp; Ritter 2001). Can also be a Tlingit word for &quot;food depot&quot;. Former spellings are Naas and Nasse. The Nisga&#x27;a name for the river is &quot;K&#x27;alii Aksim Lisims&quot; &quot;Lisims (river name) Valley&quot;. The Gitxsan name is &quot;Git-Txaemsim&quot; meaning People of Txeemsim (Raven or Trickster); &quot;Xsitxemsem&quot; in the dialect of the Gitanyow). &quot;Lisims&quot; means &quot;murky&quot; in Nisga&#x27;a, referring to the river&#x27;s silt-laden flow.

The last of the river are navigable. The river is a commercially valuable salmon fishery. The basin of the Nass is the location of the first modern-day treaty settlement in British Columbia, between the government of that province and the Nisga&#x27;a Nation. The name Nisga&#x27;a is a reduced form of , which is a loan from Tongass Tlingit, where it means &quot;people of the Nass River&quot;.

On the term:
==History==

About 220 years ago, as recorded by the oral history of the Nisga&#x27;a people, the Nass River was dammed by a long lava flow which came from the Tseax Cone and destroyed the Nisga&#x27;a villages and caused the death of at least 2000 Nisga&#x27;a people by volcanic gas and poisonous smoke. The volcano has been active on at least two occasions (220 and 650 years ago) in the last millennium. Because of our knowledge of this previous disaster, modern ing techniques should include studies of the gases emitted by the volcanoes and the institution of a warning system to alert people living down slope from the volcanoes.

==Hazards==
If the Tseax Cone were to erupt again, there could be a repeat of the poisonous gas disaster that happened to the Nisga&#x27;a people 220 years ago. The eruption could also cause forest fires and could potentially dam local rivers such as the Nass River and the Tseax if the volume of the lava flows are large enough. If the lava flows were to again reach the Nass River, it could have disastrous short-term consequences for the important salmon fisheries on the Nass River system.

==Tributaries==

<doc id="1198260" wikidata="Q7826429" url="?curid=1198260" title="Toronto Jazz Festival">
<text>The Toronto Jazz Festival is a jazz event in Toronto which takes place for 10 days in late June through early July. Like the Beaches International Jazz Festival, most of the events are outdoors and located throughout the downtown core. The hub of the festival is Nathan Phillips Square, with more than 40 other locations spread out all across the city. It attracts over 500,000 people and is the city&#x27;s third largest annual music festival next to NXNE and The Beaches International Jazz Festival. Incorporating a blend of jazz styles - from straight-ahead to bop to fusion to avant-garde- with tastes of other genres (for example, blues, funk, R&amp;B, hip-hop, Latin, etc...) the festival has something for everyone. It was formerly known as the DuMaurier Jazz Festival, until the ban on tobacco advertising by the federal government forced the need for a new sponsor. Today, the festival is sponsored by TD Bank and has since dropped the word &quot;Downtown&quot; from its title.

Originally started in 1987, the Festival was co-founded by Executive Producer Patrick Taylor and Former Artistic Director Jim Galloway; currently, the Artistic Director is Josh Grossman. Roy Thomson Hall, the CN Tower and Metro Convention Centre were the three venues for that inaugural season. Miles Davis, Roberta Flack and Tony Bennett were the headliners that year.

<text>An extracorporeal procedure is a medical procedure which is performed outside the body. Extracorporeal devices are the artificial organs that remain outside the body while treating a patient. Extracorporeal devices are useful in hemodialysis and cardiac surgery.

==Circulatory procedures==
A procedure in which blood is taken from a patient&#x27;s circulation to have a process applied to it before it is returned to the circulation. All of the apparatuses carrying the blood outside the body are collectively termed the extracorporeal circuit.
* Intra-surgical cell salvage (aspiration, washing and Autotransfusion)
* Apheresis
** Plasmapheresis vs cytapheresis
** centrifugal apheresis vs filtration apheresis vs adsorption
** cascade apheresis
* Hemoadsorption/Hemoperfusion
* Plasma Adsorption
* Aquapheresis
* Hemodialysis
* Hemofiltration
* Hemodiafiltration
* Renal replacement therapy
** Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) 
* Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal
* Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation
* Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)
* Cardiopulmonary bypass during open heart surgery
* Liver support system
* Biospleen and other extrocorporeal bionic or non bionic spleen-like blood cleansing device

==Other procedures==
Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL), which is unrelated to other extracorporeal therapies, in that the device used to break up the kidney stones is held completely outside the body, whilst the lithotripsy itself occurs inside the body.

Extracorporeal radiotherapy, where a large bone with a tumour is removed and given a dose far exceeding what would otherwise be safe to give to a patient.

Extracorporeal pulsatile circulatory control (EPCC) is a process by which brain function (animal model) is kept intact, keeping the organ alive and functioning independent from the rest of the body for several hours.

<doc id="1198263" wikidata="Q7804545" url="?curid=1198263" title="Tim and the Hidden People">
<text>Tim and the Hidden People by Sheila K. McCullagh is a 1970s and 80&#x27;s reading scheme, also known as Flightpath to Reading, originally devised for young children and intended for children with a reading age of eight-and-a-half to nine years. It consists of 32 books, each 32 pages long and illustrated by Pat Cook (1974-1979) and later Ray Mutimer (1980), written in a simple vocabulary. Four paperback &quot;novella&quot; books intended for older readers were also published in 1983 by Arnold-Wheaton.

Sheila McCullagh also wrote many other books, including &quot;Puddle Lane, The Village with Three Corners, Dragon Pirate Stories, and Griffin Pirate Stories&quot;.

==Plot==
The &quot;Tim and the Hidden People&quot; books are about a boy called Tim who lives in a house in The Yard. The books begin with Tim finding a key which enables him to see the Hidden People, he befriends Tobias the black cat and has many adventures. Tobias has a son, Sebastian, who also has special power as one of the &quot;strange ones&quot; - those who are half &quot;ordinary folk&quot; and half &quot;Hidden people&quot;.

==Reception==
Writing for the Times Educational Supplement in July 1980, Anne Barnes described the Tim and the Hidden People stories as &quot;quite adventurous&quot; saying &quot;Tim encounters enough mysteries to keep the reader in suspense to the end&quot;. &quot;Child Education&quot; magazine described the series as &quot;excellent&quot; in an August 1979 review.

The books were cited as an inspiration by the author Victoria Biggs, who used the &quot;Hidden People&quot; as an analogy for those suffering from dyspraxia. Author and director Tom Harper also cited the series as an early inspiration.

<doc id="1198268" wikidata="Q7631153" url="?curid=1198268" title="Subgroup growth">
<text>In mathematics, subgroup growth is a branch of group theory, dealing with quantitative questions about subgroups of a given group.

Let formula_1 be a finitely generated group. Then, for each integer formula_2 define formula_3 to be the number of subgroups formula_4 of index formula_2 in formula_1. Similarly, if formula_1 is a topological group, formula_8 denotes the number of open subgroups formula_9 of index formula_2 in formula_1. One similarly defines formula_12 and formula_13 to denote the number of maximal and normal subgroups of index formula_2, respectively.

Subgroup growth studies these functions, their interplay, and the characterization of group theoretical properties in terms of these functions.

The theory was motivated by the desire to enumerate finite groups of given order, and the analogy with Mikhail Gromov&#x27;s notion of word growth.

Let formula_15 be a finitely generated torsionfree nilpotent group. Then there exists a composition series with infinite cyclic factors, which induces a bijection (though not necessarily a homomorphism).

:formula_16

such that group multiplication can be expressed by polynomial functions in these coordinates; in particular, the multiplication is definable. Using methods from the model theory of p-adic integers, F. Grunewald, D. Segal and G. Smith showed that the local zeta function
:formula_17
is a rational function in formula_18.

As an example, let formula_19 be the discrete Heisenberg group. This group has a &quot;presentation&quot; with generators formula_20 and relations
:formula_21
Hence, elements of formula_19 can be represented as triples formula_23 of integers with group operation given by
:formula_24
To each finite index subgroup formula_25 of formula_19, associate the set of all &quot;good bases&quot; of formula_27 as follows. Note that formula_19 has a normal series
:formula_29
with infinite cyclic factors. A triple formula_30 is called a &quot;good basis&quot; of formula_25, if formula_32 generate formula_25, and formula_34. In general, it is quite complicated to determine the set of good bases for a fixed subgroup formula_25. To overcome this difficulty, one determines the set of all good bases of all finite index subgroups, and determines how many of these belong to one given subgroup. To make this precise, one has to embed the Heisenberg group over the integers into the group over p-adic numbers. After some computations, one arrives at the formula
:formula_36
where formula_37 is the Haar measure on formula_38, formula_39 denotes the p-adic absolute value and formula_40 is the set of tuples of formula_41-adic integers
:formula_42
such that
:formula_43
is a good basis of some finite-index subgroup. The latter condition can be translated into

:formula_44.

Now, the integral can be transformed into an iterated sum to yield
:formula_45
where the final evaluation consists of repeated application of the formula for the value of the geometric series. From this we deduce that formula_46 can be expressed in terms of the Riemann zeta function as
:formula_47

For more complicated examples, the computations become difficult, and in general one cannot expect a closed expression for formula_48. The local factor

:formula_49

can always be expressed as a definable formula_41-adic integral. Applying a result of MacIntyre on the model theory of formula_51-adic integers, one deduces again that formula_52 is a rational function in formula_18. Moreover, M. du Sautoy and F. Grunewald showed that the integral can be approximated by Artin L-functions. Using the fact that Artin L-functions are holomorphic in a neighbourhood of the line formula_54, they showed that for any torsionfree nilpotent group, the function formula_48 is meromorphic in the domain

:formula_56

where formula_57 is the abscissa of convergence of formula_52, and formula_59 is some positive number, and holomorphic in some neighbourhood of formula_60. Using a Tauberian theorem this implies
:formula_61
for some real number formula_57 and a non-negative integer formula_63.

==Congruence subgroups==
==Subgroup growth and coset representations==
Let formula_19 be a group, formula_25 a subgroup of index formula_66. Then formula_19 acts on the set of left cosets of formula_27 in formula_69 by left shift:

:formula_70

In this way, formula_25 induces a homomorphism of formula_19 into the symmetric group on formula_73. formula_69 acts transitively on formula_73, and vice versa, given a transitive action of formula_19 on

:formula_77

the stabilizer of the point 1 is a subgroup of index formula_66 in formula_19. Since the set

:formula_80

can be permuted in

:formula_81

ways, we find that formula_8 is equal to the number of transitive formula_69-actions divided by formula_81. Among all formula_15-actions, we can distinguish transitive actions by a sifting argument, to arrive at the following formula

:formula_86

where formula_87 denotes the number of homomorphisms

:formula_88

In several instances the function formula_87 is easier to be approached then formula_8, and, if formula_87 grows sufficiently large, the sum is of negligible order of magnitude, hence, one obtains an asymptotic formula for formula_8.

As an example, let formula_93 be the free group on two generators. Then every map of the generators of formula_93 extends to a homomorphism

:formula_95

that is

:formula_96

From this we deduce

:formula_97

For more complicated examples, the estimation of formula_87 involves the representation theory and statistical properties of symmetric groups.

<text>Luke Michael Haines (born 7 October 1967) is an English musician, songwriter and author. He has recorded music under various names and with various bands, including The Auteurs, Baader Meinhof and Black Box Recorder.

==Career==

===&quot;New Wave&quot;===
Haines formed numerous bands when he was at school. At college he joined The Servants who recorded two commercially unsuccessful albums. It was only when Haines formed The Auteurs with Glenn Collins and girlfriend Alice Readman, who had also been drafted into The Servants on occasion, in 1991, that he began to achieve some success.

Regular gigging in London and an &quot;NME&quot;-sponsored gig brought them to the attention of Hut Records. They released their first single, &quot;Showgirl&quot; in 1993, and their debut album &quot;New Wave&quot; a month later. Haines claimed the album started Britpop, though he later showed disdain towards the movement. The album sold only 12,000 copies but was nominated for a Mercury Prize, although the eventual winners were Suede

===Brush with fame===
Their second album, &quot;Now I&#x27;m a Cowboy&quot;, (1994) featured &quot;Lenny Valentino&quot;, which became one of their best-known songs. Soon after, Haines broke both of his ankles, resulting in the cancellation of much of their 1994 European tour. At the time he claimed &quot;I jumped off a fifteen-foot wall[...]to finish the tour and get the insurance&quot; but later, in the sleeve notes to greatest hits collection &quot;Das Capital&quot;, he denied that it was deliberate, writing &quot;I merely drank too much wine and fell over.&quot; Confined to a wheelchair for most of 1995, Haines began writing the Auteurs&#x27; third album, &quot;After Murder Park&quot;. Bleaker and more introspective than previous albums, it was produced by Steve Albini and recorded at Abbey Road studios in North London.

===New projects===
The Auteurs recorded a session for John Peel on 20 February 1996. Soon after, Haines formed solo side project called Baader-Meinhof named after the German far-left terrorist group. The Auteurs briefly disbanded, only to reunite them back together again once more for their fourth album &quot;How I Learned to Love the Bootboys&quot;.

===Black Box Recorder===
Following the release of what turned out to be the final Auteurs record, Haines formed Black Box Recorder with John Moore (formerly of The Jesus and Mary Chain) and Sarah Nixey. The band produced three commercially successful albums, &quot;England Made Me&quot;, &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, and &quot;Passionoia&quot;. There is also a B-sides collection, &quot;The Worst of Black Box Recorder&quot;. &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; produced the eponymous single, which has been the biggest hit of Haines&#x27; career so far. Although no official split announcement was made, the band have been on hiatus since the mid-2000s.

===Going solo===
In 2000 Haines wrote the soundtrack for &quot;Christie Malry&#x27;s Own Double Entry&quot;, a film adaptation of the B. S. Johnson novel. Director Paul Tickell had originally expressed a wish to license &quot;How I Learned to Love the Bootboys&quot; as the soundtrack for the film but couldn&#x27;t afford the rights. In the same year Haines released &quot;The Oliver Twist Manifesto&quot;, a solo album released under his own name.

Soon after the sale of Virgin Records to French company Fnac, David Boyd of Hut Records (owned by Virgin) enlisted Haines to release an Auteurs greatest hits collection, giving the band the opportunity to re-record the songs as they saw fit. &quot;Das Capital: The Song Writing Genius of Luke Haines&quot; therefore consisted mostly of new versions of Auteurs songs with the inclusion of a string quartet, with some new tracks. A box set covering his career to date, &quot;Luke Haines is Dead,&quot; was issued in 2005, and two new albums were expected in 2006, including the soundtrack to the abandoned musical &quot;Property&quot;, which also features Sarah Nixey. It remains unreleased. Cherry Red Records released a &quot;Best of The Servants&quot; compilation, with sleeve notes by Haines, the same year.

&quot;Off My Rocker at the Art School Bop&quot; was released in October 2006. Haines worked with pop producer Richard X on some tracks. The album was preceded by a double A-sided single &quot;Off My Rocker at the Art School Bop (Richard X version)&quot;, backed with &quot;I Am The Best Artist/Skinny White Girls.&quot; Haines toured the UK and Ireland in support of the album during November 2006, with John Moore guesting on bowed saw and backing vocals at some dates. Haines also played at book signings for David Peace during the promotional tour for his novel &quot;The Damned United&quot;.

Haines and Peter Buck, formerly of R.E.M., collaborated on an album, &quot; Beat Poetry for Survivalists&quot;, which was released in 2020.

===Black Box Recorder reformation===
In December 2007, Black Box Recorder teamed up with Art Brut to create the single &quot;Christmas Number One&quot; under the collaborative title of The Black Arts. In October 2008 Black Box Recorder appeared at a Nick Sanderson tribute concert. It was subsequently announced on Luke Haines&#x27; web site that the band would play their first headlining gig for five years at The Luminaire, Kilburn, London in February 2009.

===Writing===
Haines&#x27; memoir &quot;Bad Vibes: Britpop and My Part in Its Downfall&quot; was published on 1 January 2009 by William Heinemann Ltd. The book covers Haines&#x27; experiences during the Britpop era 1991 to 1997. &quot;Post Everything: Outsider Rock and Roll&quot;, his second volume of memoirs, was published in July 2011. Haines&#x27; first cookbook, &quot;Outsider Food and Righteous Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll&quot;, was published in 2015.

In May 2009 a novel about Haines by Tim Mitchell &quot;Truth and Lies in Murder Park&quot; was published by benben press. The book includes material based on interviews with Luke, and explores the themes of his music. In issue four of the comic book &quot;Phonogram&quot;, Haines appears as a spirit guide leading the main character through a metaphorical land representing Britpop.

===Documentary===
A documentary on Haines by Irish director Niall McCann, called &quot;Art Will Save the World&quot;, premiered at the East End film festival in Dalston on 6 July 2012. It was also shown at the Barcelona, Copenhagen and Cork film festivals. It featured interviews with Jarvis Cocker, John Niven, David Peace and Stewart Home along with extensive interviews with Haines.

<text>Illinois Route 71 is a southwest-to-northeast state highway in north central Illinois. It runs from the end of Interstate 180 in Hennepin to U.S. Route 34 in Oswego. This is a distance of .

== Route description ==

Outside of Hennepin, the road stretches east to an intersection with Interstate 39 near Oglesby, paralleling I-39 to the north for several miles on a concurrency with Illinois Route 351 before turning eastward again near LaSalle-Peru.

Between LaSalle-Peru and Ottawa, Route 71 parallels the south bank of the Illinois River and passes Starved Rock State Park. It then crosses the Illinois River on a simple four-lane girder bridge. It overlaps Illinois Route 23 through downtown Ottawa and U.S. Route 6 east from Route 23 before intersecting with Interstate 80. From here it continues to the northeast, passing through Norway, Newark, and Yorkville. Its eastern terminus is near downtown Oswego at an intersection with U.S. Highway 34 and Wolf&#x27;s Crossing Road.

The now-defunct Prairie Parkway project, a limited-access highway, would have had an interchange with Route 71 southwest of High Point Road near Yorkville.

The stretch between US 34 and Orchard Road in Oswego was widened to four lanes in each direction, with the addition of center turn lane, in which the project was completed in the fall of 2015. There are also current plans to build a silica sand mine off of IL 71 near Starved Rock State Park, pending final approval by the City of Ottawa. The plan is currently opposed by environmental groups due to the intended use of the sand in fracking practices and the potential damage caused by airborne dust and blasting operations.

== History ==
Before 1938, Illinois Route 71 originally connected from US 51 (now IL 251) at Twelvemile Corner to US 30 at Aurora. In 1938, IL 71 moved onto a new route as US 30 was rerouted through Twelvemile Corner. It traveled from IL 29 near Bureau Junction to IL 23 at Ottawa. Before that, it was part of Illinois Route 89 as well as Illinois Route 7A, and Illinois Route 89A. In 1939, a ferry that crossed the Illinois River was replaced by a truss bridge. In 1942, IL 71 was extended towards US 34 in Oswego. In 1947, the road between Norway and Yorkville was finished and then opened to traffic. In 1969, IL 71 was truncated from Bureau Junction to Hennepin after IL 26 was extended to Peoria.

== Points of interest ==
Just south of Norway, there is a memorial dedicated to Norwegian immigrants who settled in the area, with a small park, a cemetery, and a plaque from King Olav V. This memorial commemorates the Fox River Settlement. Dating from 1834, this was the location of the first permanent Norwegian-American immigrant settlement in the Midwest.

Near E. 26th Road, south of Norway, Illinois, there is also a crashed airplane that serves as a &quot;memorial&quot; of sorts to commemorate the 1980s agricultural crash, which affected the rural farming county.

<doc id="1198286" wikidata="Q3399468" url="?curid=1198286" title="Jamal al-Fadl">
<text>Jamal Ahmed al-Fadl (, ; born 1963) is a Sudanese militant and former associate of Osama bin Laden in the early 1990s. Al-Fadl was recruited for the Afghan war through the Farouq mosque in Brooklyn. In 1988, he joined Al-Qaeda and took an oath of fealty to Bin Laden. After a dispute with Bin Laden, al-Fadl defected and became an informant to the United States government on al-Qaeda&#x27;s activities.

==Al-Qaeda==
Initially working at a grocery store in Brooklyn, Al-Fadl was recruited to join the cause of the Afghan mujahideen &quot;through the Farouq mosque in Brooklyn&quot;, presumably when he was in the U.S. in the mid-1980s. Al-Fadl traveled to Pakistan and began attending training camps where he learned how to shoot AK-47s, RPGs and how to handle explosives. He eventually became a &quot;senior employee&quot; of al-Qaeda.

He attended meetings on August 11 and 20, 1988, with Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Mohammed Atef, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, Wael Hamza Julaidan, and Mohammed Loay Bayazid and eight others to discuss the founding of &quot;al-Qaeda&quot;. In Khartoum, he traveled to Hilat Koko with Mamdouh Mahmud Salim in late 1993 or early 1994, and met with Amin Abdel Marouf to discuss chemical weapons.

Al-Fadl became a business agent for al-Qaeda but resented receiving a salary of only $500 a month while some of the Egyptians in al-Qaeda were given $1,200 a month. When Osama bin Laden discovered that al-Fadl had skimmed about $110,000 and asked for restitution, the latter defected and became an informant for the United States.

==Defection==
After embezzling $110,000 from the organization, al-Fadl &quot;defected&quot;. He contacted the CIA via the United States&#x27;s Eritrean embassy and, receiving encouragement from FBI special agents Jack Cloonan and Dan Coleman (who were &quot;seconded&quot; to the CIA&#x27;s Bin Laden unit), he returned (after staying in Germany for a while) to the United States, in spring 1996. While in protective custody, al-Fadl won a modest sum in scratch tickets in the New Jersey lottery, which was taken away by his guards.

For the next three years Cloonan and his colleagues oversaw al-Fadl in a safehouse. From December 1996, al-Fadl began to provide &quot;a major breakthrough of intelligence on the creation, character, direction, and intentions of al Qaeda&quot;; &quot;bin Laden, the CIA now learned, had planned multiple terrorist operations and aspired to more&quot; — including the acquisition of weapons-grade uranium. Al-Fadl, who had &quot;passed the polygraph tests he was given&quot;, became a key witness in the US v. bin Laden trial that began in February 2001.

His upkeep during the first 12 years of his life in Witness Protection were deemed &quot;expensive&quot;, as he reportedly was an &quot;incessant troublemaker&quot; who suffered severe emotional mood swings, a taste for womanizing and financial scheming.

==Testimony in court ==
Al-Fadl testified in a trial, &quot;United States v. Osama bin Laden&quot;, No. S(7) 98 Cr. 1023 (S.D. N.Y.), Feb. 6, 2001 (transcript pp. 218–219, 233); Feb. 13, 2001 (transcript pp. 514–516); Feb. 20, 2001 (transcript p. 890).

In January 2001, the trial began in New York City of four men accused of the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in east Africa. The U.S also wanted to prosecute Osama bin Laden in his absence under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). To be able to do so under American law, the prosecutors needed evidence of a criminal organization, which would then allow them to prosecute the leader, even if he could not be linked directly to the crime.

Al-Fadl was taken on as a key prosecution witness, who, along with a number of other sources, claimed that Osama bin Laden was the leader of a large international terrorist organization which was called al-Qaeda. al-Fadl provided a list of 25 names he claimed were the key members of the group, which included five identifiable Saudis and six identifiable Egyptians.

===Fatwa===
In giving testimony, Jamal al-Fadl described a 1992 fatwa issued by &quot;Abu Hajer al Iraqi&quot; (Mamdouh Mahmud Salim) at the request of Al Qaeda leadership, that was putatively based on an earlier fatwa by the influential 14th-century Salafi scholar Ibn Taymiyyah (&quot;Ibn al Tamiyeh&quot;) permitting the killing of Muslim supporters of the &quot;Tartars&quot; (Mongols) who threatened to invade the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt. The fatwa has been described as a pivotal development in that it provided al-Qaeda with justification for the killing of Muslim civilians and bystanders.
Q. Can you tell us now what Abu Hajer al Iraqi said about Ibn al Tamiyeh?&lt;BR&gt;
A. He said that our time now is similar like in that time, and he say Ibn al Tamiyeh, when a tartar come to Arabic war, Arabic countries that time, he say some Muslims, they help them. And he says Ibn al Tamiyeh, he make a fatwah. He said anybody around the tartar, he buy something from them and he sell them something, you should kill him. And also, if when you attack the tartar, if anybody around them, anything, or he&#x27;s not military or that -- if you kill him, you don&#x27;t have to worry about that. If he&#x27;s a good person, he go to paradise and if he&#x27;s a bad person, he go to hell.

===Al-Fadl&#x27;s debriefing===
Patrick J. Fitzgerald, who would later become well known for serving as the Special Prosecutor who investigated the Bush Presidency&#x27;s leak of the identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame, played a lead role in debriefing al-Fadl.
The transcripts from his debriefing ran to 900 pages. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;: 

The &quot;New York Times&quot; profiled al-Fadl on December 9, 2007. Their review of the transcripts described his anxieties over testifying, the emotional difficulties enforced idleness caused, and the emotional difficulties his entire family faced due to isolation and culture shock. The article describes his wife, who didn&#x27;t speak English, demanding he refuse to testify, and threatening to leave him and return to Sudan.

<doc id="1198288" wikidata="Q492194" url="?curid=1198288" title="Group B">
<text>Group B was a set of regulations for grand touring (GT) cars used in sports car racing and rallying introduced in 1982 by the Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA). Although permitted to enter a GT class of the World Sportscar Championship alongside the faster and more popular Group C prototypes, Group B cars are commonly associated with international rallying during 1982 to 1986, when they were the highest class used in the World Rally Championship (WRC) and regional and national rally championships.

The Group B regulations fostered some of the fastest, most powerful, and most sophisticated rally cars ever built, and their era is commonly referred to as the golden era of rallying. However, a series of major accidents, some fatal, were believed to be caused by their outright speed, with lack of crowd control at events. After the death of Henri Toivonen and his co-driver Sergio Cresto in the 1986 Tour de Corse, the FIA banned the group from competing in the WRC from the following season, dropped its prior plans to introduce Group S, and designated Group A as the top class of rally cars with engine limits of 2000 cc and 300 bhp.

In the following years, ex-rally Group B cars found a niche in the European Rallycross Championship until being dropped in 1993. By 1991, the World Sportscar Championship had moved on from Group B and C, with the GT championships formed in the 1990s preferring other classes such as the new GT1. The last Group B cars were homologated in 1993, though the FIA made provisions for national championships and domestic racing until as late as 2011.

==Overview==
=== New FISA groups ===

In 1982, the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) restructured the production car category of Appendix J of the International Sporting Code to consist of three new groups.

The outgoing Group 1 and Group 2 were replaced with Group N and Group A, for unmodified and modified production touring cars respectively. These cars had to have four seats (although the minimum size of the rear seats was small enough that some 2+2 cars could qualify) and be produced in large numbers. Their homologation requirement was 5000 units in a 12-month period between 1982 and 1992. From 1993, the requirement was reduced to 2500 units.

Group B was for GT cars with a minimum of two seats, redefined as sports grand touring cars in 1986. It combined and replaced Group 3 and Group 4, two grand touring groups already used in rallying, and the production-derived Group 5 silhouette cars used in circuit racing. Group 5 cars had never been permitted in the World Rally Championship for Manufacturers.

=== Homologation ===
The number of cars required for homologation—200—was just 4% of the other groups&#x27; requirements and half of what was previously accepted in Group 4. As homologation periods could be extended by producing only 10% of the initial requirement each subsequent year (20 in Group B&#x27;s case compared to 500 for A and N), the group made motorsport more accessible for car manufacturers before taking the group&#x27;s technicalities and performance into account. &#x27;Evolutions&#x27; could be included within the original homologation without needing to produce a new initial run, allowing manufacturers to tweak various aspects of their competing car within the requirement to produce only 20 &#x27;evolved&#x27; cars. Together, these homologation rules resulted in Group B &#x27;homologation specials&#x27;—extremely rare cars that were only produced to satisfy the homologation quota rather than for sales, if they continued to exist beyond presentation to FIA officials in the first place.

Group B could be used to homologate production sports cars which were ineligible for Group N or A due to not having four seats or not being produced in large enough numbers (such as the Ferrari 308 or the Porsche 911). Furthermore, the low production requirement encouraged manufacturers to use competition-oriented space frames instead of the unibodies typically used in most series-production road cars.

Existing cars already homologated within Groups 2, 3 and 4 could be transferred to Group B, with many being automatically transferred by the FISA secretariat.

== Regulations ==
=== Specific regulations ===
Group B followed Article 252 and 253, which covered such things as safety cages or parts defining a car, like windshields or side-view mirrors. Article 256 covered regulations specific to Group B, with 5 paragraphs over half a page, and included most of the 7 pages of Article 255 for Group A. The first two paragraphs of 256 covered the definition of &quot;(Sports) Grand Touring Cars&quot; with a minimum of two seats, and their homologation requirements.

The section, &quot;3) Fittings and Modifications Allowed&quot; states, &quot;All those allowed for Group A...&quot; referring to the base rule set of what is allowed to be modified, how it can be modified, and what can be removed from the homologation road cars.

If forced induction is present, restrictions apply as though the engine capacity is 1.4 times its actual value. If the engine is a Wankel rotary or similar, then the capacity is considered to be &quot;twice the volume determined between the maximum and minimum capacity of the combustion chamber.&quot; The equivalent capacity, formula_1, for a turbine engine is much more complicated, derived with the formula formula_2 (1982) or formula_3 (1986), where formula_4 is the &quot;high pressure nozzle area&quot; (cm2), and formula_5/formula_6 is the &quot;pressure ratio&quot; of the compressor.

=== Resulting builds ===

Ultimately, there were few restrictions on technology, design or materials permitted. For example, fiberglass bodywork was used in the Ford RS200, a car without a common commercially available counterpart, though silhouette race cars using space frame chassis were still common even when consumer car equivalents were mass produced, for example in the case of the Peugeot 205 T16 or Lancia Delta S4. The rules provided for manufacturers who wanted to compete in rallying with mid-engine and RWD or 4WD, but their RWD production models had been gradually replaced by FWD counterparts. By reducing the homologation minimum from 400 in Group 4 to 200, FISA enabled manufacturers to design specialized RWD or 4WD homologation specials without the financial commitment of producing their production counterparts in such large numbers.

When the Group N, A, and B rules were decided upon, weight and engine displacement restrictions were thought the only way to control speed. This meant that there were no restrictions on boost, resulting in power output increasing from the winning cars&#x27; 250 hp in 1981 to there being at least two cars producing in excess of 500 by 1986, the final year of Group B in rally. Turbocharged engines were not yet common in road-going cars and had only been introduced in the early 1960s, but in the early and mid-1980s, engineers learnt how to extract extraordinary amounts of power from turbocharging. Some Group B manufacturers went further; Peugeot, for example, installed a Formula One-derived antilag system to their engine, although the technology was new and not very effective, and Lancia twincharged their Delta S4. Nowadays, the power output of turbo engines is limited via intake restrictors, and in the Groups Rally hierarchy, each class has an explicit weight/power ratio limit.

Across Groups N, A, and B, there were 15 classes based on engine displacement, with a 1.4 equivalence factor applied for forced induction engines. Each class had weight and wheel size limits. Notable classes for Group B were the 3000 cc class (2142.8 cc with forced induction) with a 960 kg minimum weight (Audi Quattro, Lancia 037), and the 2500 cc class (1785 cc with FI) with a 890 kg minimum weight (Peugeot 205 T16, Lancia Delta S4). The original Renault 5 Turbo had a turbocharged 1.4 L engine, so it was in the 2000 cc class. Renault later increased the size of the engine somewhat for the Turbo Maxi to be able to fit larger tires (at the expense of higher weight). The Ferrari 288 GTO and the Porsche 959 were in the 4000 cc (2857 cc with FI), 1100 kg class, which would probably have become the normal class for circuit racing if Group B had seen much use there.
== Rallying ==
=== 1982–1983 ===

The existing Groups 1–4 were still permitted in the World Rally Championship during the first year of the new groups. Although some freshly homologated Group B cars were entered from the first round in Monte Carlo, no car from the group made podium at any of the season&#x27;s 12 rallies.

Although the Audi Quattro was still in essence a Group 4 car, it carried Hannu Mikkola to the driver&#x27;s title in 1983. Lancia had designed a new car to Group B specifications, but the Lancia 037 still had rear-wheel drive and was thus less stable than the Quattro over loose surfaces. Nevertheless, the 037 performed well enough for Lancia to capture the manufacturers&#x27; title, which was generally considered more prestigious than the drivers&#x27; title at the time, with a win to spare. In fact, so low was Lancia&#x27;s regard for the Drivers Championship that they did not enter a single car into the season finale RAC Rally, despite the fact that driver Walter Röhrl was still in the running for the title. This may have been, in part, because Röhrl &quot;never dreamed of becoming a world champion.&quot;
The lenient homologation requirements quickly attracted manufacturers to Group B. Opel replaced their production-derived Ascona with the Group B Manta 400, and Toyota built a new car based on their Celica. Like the Lancia 037, both cars were rear-wheel drive; while proving successful in national rallying in various countries, they were less so at the World Championship level, although Toyota won the 1983 Ivory Coast Rally with Björn Waldegård behind the wheel.

=== 1984–1985 ===

In 1984, Audi beat Lancia for both the manufacturers&#x27; title and drivers&#x27; titles, the latter of which was won by Stig Blomqvist, but received unexpected new competition midway through the year. Peugeot had joined with its Group B 205 T16. Like the Quattro, the T16 also had four-wheel drive, but was smaller and lighter. At the wheel was 1981 driver&#x27;s champion Ari Vatanen, with future Ferrari Formula One team manager and FIA President Jean Todt overseeing the operation.

A crash prevented the T16 from winning its first rally, but the writing was on the wall for Audi. Despite massive revisions to the Quattro, including a shorter wheelbase, Peugeot dominated the 1985 season, although not without mishap—Vatanen plunged off the road in Argentina and was seriously injured when his seat mounts broke in the ensuing crash. Fellow Peugeot driver Timo Salonen won the 1985 driver&#x27;s title with five wins.

Although the crash was a sign that Group B cars had already become dangerously quick (despite Vatanen himself having a consistent record of crashing out while leading), several new Group B cars debuted in 1985:
* Late in the year, Lancia replaced their outclassed 037 with the Delta S4, which featured both a turbocharger and a supercharger for optimum power output.
* Ford returned after several years away with the RS200 and the Sierra RS Cosworth (though the latter went on to compete in Group A).
* Citroën developed and entered the BX 4TC, which had proven too heavy and cumbersome to be successful.
* Rover created the distinctive Metro 6R4, which featured boxy bodywork and a large wing on the front of the car.

=== 1986 ===

For the 1986 season, defending champion Salonen drove the new Evolution 2 version of Peugeot&#x27;s 205 T16 alongside ex-Toyota driver Juha Kankkunen. Audi&#x27;s new Sport Quattro S1 boasted over 600 hp (450 kW) and a huge snowplow-like front end. Lancia&#x27;s Delta S4 would be in the hands of Finnish prodigy Henri Toivonen and Markku Alén, and Ford readied its high-tech RS200 with Stig Blomqvist and Kalle Grundel.

On the &quot;Lagoa Azul&quot; stage of the Rally de Portugal near Sintra, Portuguese driver Joaquim Santos crested a rise, turning to his right to avoid a small group of spectators. This caused him to lose control of his RS200. The car veered to the right and slid off the road into another group of spectators. Thirty-one people were injured and three were killed. All of the top teams immediately pulled out of the rally and Group B was placed in jeopardy.
Disaster struck again in early May at the Tour de Corse. Lancia&#x27;s Toivonen was the championship favorite, and once the rally got underway, he was the pace setter. Seven kilometers into the 18th stage, Toivonen&#x27;s S4 flew off the unguarded edge of a tightening left-hand bend and plunged down a steep wooded hillside. The car landed upside down with its fuel tanks ruptured by the impact. The combination of a red-hot turbocharger, Kevlar bodywork, and leaking fuel ignited the car and set fire to the dry undergrowth. Toivonen and co-driver Sergio Cresto died in their seats. With no witnesses to the accident, it was impossible to determine what caused the crash other than that Toivonen had left the road at high speed. Some cite Toivonen&#x27;s ill health at the time (he reportedly was suffering from the flu); others suggest mechanical failure or simply the difficulty of driving the car (although Toivonen, like Vatanen, had a career full of crashing out while leading rallies). Up until that stage he was leading the rally by a large margin, with no other driver challenging him.

The crash came a year after Lancia driver Attilio Bettega had crashed and died in his 037. While that fatality was largely blamed on the unforgiving Corsican scenery (and bad luck, as his co-driver, Maurizio Perissinot, was unharmed), Toivonen and Cresto&#x27;s deaths, combined with the Portugal tragedy and televised accident of F1 driver Marc Surer in another RS200 which killed co-driver Michel Wyder, compelled the FIA to ban all Group B cars immediately for 1987. Audi decided to quit Group B entirely after the Corsica rally.

The final days of Group B were also controversial. The Peugeots were disqualified from the Rally Sanremo by the Italian scrutineers as the &#x27;skirts&#x27; around the bottom of the car were found to be illegal. Peugeot immediately accused the Italians of favouring Lancia. Their case was strengthened at the next event, the RAC Rally, when the British scrutineers passed the Peugeots as legal in identical trim. FISA annulled the result of the Sanremo Rally eleven days after the final round in the United States. As a result, the championship title was passed from Lancia&#x27;s Markku Alén to Peugeot&#x27;s Juha Kankkunen. Salonen had won another two rallies during the 1986 season, becoming the most successful Group B-era driver with a total of seven wins.

=== Beyond WRC ===
Although 1987 saw the end of Group B rally car development and their appearance on the world rally scene, the cars did not disappear outright. They were still permitted in regional championships, providing they met the limit of 1600cc for four-wheel drive or were homologated prior to 1984. Future FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem was one privateer who contested rounds of the 1987 Middle East Rally Championship in an Audi Quattro A2 and Opel Manta 400. Independent teams would enter the European Championship too, though the limited options of permitted Group B cars were not as competitive or ubiquitous as newer Group A cars.

Porsche&#x27;s 959 never entered a WRC event, though it did compete in the Middle East championship and won the Paris-Dakar Rally in 1986. Peugeot adapted their T16 to run in the Dakar Rally. Ari Vatanen won the event in 1987, 1989 and 1990. Improved Peugeot and Audi cars also competed in the Pikes Peak Hillclimb in Colorado. Walter Röhrl&#x27;s Quattro S1 won the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb in 1987 and set a new record at the time. Audi used their Group B experience to develop a production based racing car for the Trans-Am and IMSA GTO series in 1988 and 1989 respectively.

Many ex-rally cars found homes in European rallycross events from the beginning of 1987 until the end of 1992. The MG Metro 6R4 and Ford RS200 became frequent entries in national championships. For 1993, the FIA replaced the Group B models in the European Rallycross Championship with prototypes that had to be based on existing Group A models.

=== Group S ===

The cancellation of Group B, coupled with the tragedies of 1986, brought about the scrapping of Group B&#x27;s proposed replacement: Group S.

Group S rules would have limited car engine power to 300 hp (225 kW). To encourage innovative designs, ten examples of a car would have been required for homologation, rather than the 200 required for Group B. By the time of its cancellation, at least four Group S prototypes had been built: the Lancia ECV, the Toyota MR2-based 222D, the Opel Kadett Rallye 4x4 (a.k.a. Vauxhall Astra 4S) and the Lada Samara S-proto, and new cars were also planned by both Audi (the 002 Quattro) and Ford (a Group S modification of the RS200). The cancellation of Group S angered many rally insiders who believed the new specification to be both safer than Group B and more exciting than Group A.

The Group S concept was revived by the FIA in 1997 as the World Rally Car specification, which persisted until 2021. WRC cars were limited to and required 2500 examples of a model but, unlike Group S, also had to share certain parts with their base production models.

== Circuit racing ==
From their introduction in 1982, Group B cars found a home in the World Endurance Championship, formerly the World Sportscar Championship, though were secondary to the Group C racing prototypes. The 1983 season had the first significant entry list including Porsche 930, BMW M1 and Ferrari 308 GTB LM vehicles. Porsche won the FIA GT Cup in 1983, handing it over to BMW in 1984 and 1985. From 1986, the championship retired Group B in favor of IMSA-regulated cars, becoming the World Sports Prototype Championship.

The Porsche 961 prototype, intended to be the basis for Group B homologation, won the GTX class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1986 but crashed and caught fire in 1987. The Ferrari 288 GTO had the minimum requirement of cars built and sold to the public, but never saw competition in its category. The WSPC grids it was intended for were filled up by a batch of Group C cars (there would be no production sports car-based racers in European racing, including Le Mans, until 1993), but it saw limited use in an IMSA GTO race in 1989.

== Legacy ==

The era of Group B is often considered one of the most competitive and compelling periods in rallying. The combination of a lightweight chassis, sophisticated aerodynamics, and massive amounts of horsepower resulted in the development of a class of cars whose performance has not yet been surpassed within their category, even three decades later. In reference to their dubious safety record, the class has also earned an unsavory nickname among some rally enthusiasts: &quot;Killer B&#x27;s&quot;. In contrast to this, many others refer to the Group B era as the Golden Age of Rallying.

Many racing video games feature Group B cars for the player to drive. The 2017 video game &quot;Gran Turismo Sport&quot; features a rally car category known as &quot;Gr. B&quot;, an obvious homage to Group B. This particular category features predominantly fictional rally cars based on newer models, such as the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution X and the Subaru WRX STI, although it does include the Pikes Peak version of the Audi Quattro. For the game&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Gran Turismo 7&quot;, an actual Group B car—the Peugeot 205 T16—was added to the class.

<doc id="1198292" wikidata="Q1995471" url="?curid=1198292" title="Treaty of Worms (1743)">
<text>The Treaty of Worms was a political alliance formed between Great Britain, Austria and the Kingdom of Sardinia, signed on 13 September 1743, during the War of the Austrian Succession.

It was an ambitious piece of foreign policy on the part of the British government which sought to split the Emperor Charles VII, prince-elector of Bavaria, from French influence, whilst simultaneously resolving the differences between the Emperor, Queen Maria Theresa of Hungary and King Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia.

== Contents of the treaty ==
Under the terms of the treaty, Maria Theresa agreed to transfer to the King of Sardinia the city and part of the duchy of Piacenza, the Vigevanesco, part of the duchy of Pavia, part of the county of Anghiera which lay to the west of Lake Maggiore, and claims to the marquisate of Finale. She also engaged to maintain 30,000 men in Italy, to be commanded by Savoy-Sardinia.

Great Britain agreed to pay the sum of £300,000 for the ceding of Finale, and to furnish an annual subsidy of £200,000, on the condition that Savoy-Sardinia should employ 45,000 men. In addition to this fiscal arrangement, Britain agreed to send a fleet into the Mediterranean.

Under a separate, secret convention, agreed contemporaneously with the Treaty, but which was neither formally ratified nor publicly acknowledged, it was stipulated that Britain would pay Maria Theresa an annual subsidy of £300,000, for as long &quot;as the necessity of her affairs should require.&quot;

The terms of the Treaty of Worms relative to the ceding of the marquisate of Finale to Savoy-Sardinia were particularly unjust to the Genoese, since the territory had been guaranteed to them by the fourth article of the Quadruple Alliance of 2 August 1718 between Britain, France, Austria, and the Netherlands.

==Criticism==
The Treaty of Worms was presented to the Commons on 9 January 1744, and was considered in the entire house on 1 February 1744.

===William Pitt===
William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham, speaking in the House of Commons on 1 December 1743 roundly condemned the Treaty in the following statement which occurred during the course of an address of thanks he was giving after the Battle of Dettingen:
===Thomas Carlyle===
Thomas Carlyle had this to say on the terms of the treaty:

<text>Stewart is a district municipality at the head of the Portland Canal in northwestern British Columbia, Canada, near the Alaskan panhandle. In 2021, it had a population of 517.
==History==
The Nisga&#x27;a, who live around the Nass River, called the head of Portland Canal , meaning &quot;safe house&quot; or &quot;strong house&quot;, probably because it served them as a retreat from the harassment of the Haida and Tlingit from the outer coast. They travelled in the area seasonally to pick berries and hunt birds. It and the rest of the Portland Canal had previously been the domain of the Tsetsaut people, also called the Skam-a-Kounst Indians, or in Nisga&#x27;a, an Athapaskan people who became decimated by war and disease and were driven out of the Stewart area by either Haida or Nisga&#x27;a in 1856–57.

The Portland Canal was first explored and named in July 1793 by Captain George Vancouver in honour of William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland (1738–1808), Home Secretary from 1794 to 1801. Vancouver met two friendly native people at the current site of Stewart. The area around the Portland Canal was again explored in 1896 by Captain D.D. Gaillard of the United States Army Corps of Engineers (after whom the Gaillard Cut in the Panama Canal was later named). Two years after Gaillard&#x27;s visit, the first prospectors and settlers arrived. Among them was D. J. Raine, for whom a creek and a mountain in the area are named. The Stewart brothers arrived in 1902. In 1905, Robert M. Stewart, the first postmaster, named the town Stewart.

Gold and silver mining dominated the early economy. Nearby Hyder, Alaska, boomed with the discovery of rich silver veins in the upper Salmon River basin in 1917 and 1918. Hyder became an access and supply point for the mines, while Stewart served as the port for Canadian mining activity, which was centred on the town of Premier, which was accessed by a road from Hyder.
Other mines in the area were the Jumbo, BC Silver, Red Cliff, and Porter-Idaho. More large camps were south of Stewart at Anyox and Maple Bay.

Disney&#x27;s &quot;Eight Below&quot;, starring Paul Walker and Jason Biggs, was partially filmed here. The exterior shots from John Carpenter&#x27;s science fiction classic &quot;The Thing&quot; were filmed within Salmon Glacier.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Stewart had a population of 517 living in 256 of its 337 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 401. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Transportation==
Stewart is accessible by highway from the British Columbia highway system, via Highway 37A, by boat through the Portland Canal, or by air through Stewart Airport.

==Location==

West of Stewart is Hyder, Alaska, which is only from the town. Northwest of Stewart, and accessible only by way of Hyder, is Premier, British Columbia, notable for being in Canada, but accessible only through a portion of the United States that is accessible only from Canada.

East of the town is Meziadin Junction, which is from the town. Also east is Kitwanga, British Columbia, which is located from the town, and Dease Lake, British Columbia, which is located north of Stewart. It is the northernmost point on Canada&#x27;s Pacific coast.

==Climate==
Stewart has a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;), with about per year of precipitation, much of it as snow, and an average yearly temperature of , according to Environment Canada. Stewart is Canada&#x27;s most northerly ice-free port. Due to its proximity to the ocean, the climate retains strong maritime influences, with winters being far milder than locations farther inland. With an average of 985 hours of annual sunshine, Stewart is one of the cloudiest places in the world.

<doc id="1198308" wikidata="Q3304288" url="?curid=1198308" title="British United Traction">
<text>British United Traction (BUT) was a manufacturer of railway equipment and trolleybuses. It was established in 1946 as a joint venture between AEC and Leyland.

==History==

British United Traction was established in 1946 when AEC and Leyland amalgamated their trolleybus interests. Neither had produced trolleybuses since the early years of World War II. With both forecasting that demand would return to pre-war levels as networks began to close, a joint venture was formed. The new company was organised so that AEC would design and produce vehicles for the UK market while Leyland looked after export markets, although there were some exceptions to this. The only noticeable difference between the manufacturers&#x27; output was the wheels.

Initially vehicles were produced at Leyland&#x27;s Ham, London factory, with the first vehicles completed in 1947 for Johannesburg. After the factory closed 1948, production moved to AEC&#x27;s Southall and Leyland&#x27;s Leyland, Lancashire factories. Following AEC&#x27;s acquisition of Crossley Motors, AEC transferred its production to the latter&#x27;s Stockport factory. Trolleybus production wound down in the late 1950s, however a final batch for Wellington was built at Scammell&#x27;s, Watford factory in 1964.

==Diesel engines for railways==

British United Traction was a major supplier of diesel engines for British Rail&#x27;s first-generation diesel multiple units. These engines were built in , and versions and were branded AEC, Leyland or Leyland-Albion.

A version was supplied to the Ulster Transport Authority for its UTA MPD class railcar.

<doc id="1198312" wikidata="Q1869012" url="?curid=1198312" title="London Racers">
<text>The London Racers was a British ice hockey club based in London, England formerly members of the Elite Ice Hockey League. Although founded in 2003, it claimed to be a successor of the Harringay Racers club established in 1936. Due to a lack of suitable ice facility the club suspended its team operations part way through the 2005–06 season. It was the last professional ice hockey club to play in London.

==2003–04 season==
Formed and organized in only a few weeks, the Racers played their home games at Alexandra Palace. Erik Zachrisson captained the team. Their first season was a difficult one, as the team failed to win for some 40 games. Finally, a win arrived with a 3–0 victory over the Cardiff Devils. Another win followed as the team beat the Basingstoke Bison 4–0, but the team finished with a ghastly 3–49–2–2 record, still (as of 2010) the worst in league history.

==2004–05 season==
The team moved to the 1,200 capacity Lee Valley Ice Centre in Leyton, east London, although the arena was considered small for Elite League hockey. The offseason saw the hiring of former American Hockey League player Dennis Maxwell as Coach, who assembled a much stronger team, including perennial British all-star Steve Moria, and, with the 2004–05 NHL lockout, defenceman Eric Cairns and centre Scott Nichol from the National Hockey League. They made the playoffs in the sixth slot (out of seven teams) with a 19–19–9–3 record, but were eliminated by the Cardiff Devils.

==2005–06 season==
On 5 November, during a game against the Nottingham Panthers, defenseman Blaž Emeršič sustained serious facial injuries after colliding with a protruding object in the rink boardings. Days later on 13 November a piece of plexiglass was smashed. When the same section of glass smashed again at a training session the following Tuesday, serious questions regarding the safety of players and spectators were raised. Unable to find a new venue or secure agreement on improving safety at Lee Valley, the Racers withdrew their team from competitions on 21 November and subsequently folded.

<text>Banking regulation and supervision refers to a form of financial regulation which subjects banks to certain requirements, restrictions and guidelines, enforced by a financial regulatory authority generally referred to as banking supervisor, with semantic variations across jurisdictions. By and large, banking regulation and supervision aims at ensuring that banks are safe and sound and at fostering market transparency between banks and the individuals and corporations with whom they conduct business. 

Its main component is prudential regulation and supervision whose aim is to ensure that banks are viable and resilient (&quot;safe and sound&quot;) so as to reduce the likelihood and impact of bank failures that may trigger systemic risk. Prudential regulation and supervision requires banks to control risks and hold adequate capital as defined by capital requirements, liquidity requirements, the imposition of concentration risk (or large exposures) limits, and related reporting and public disclosure requirements and supervisory controls and processes. Other components include supervision aimed at enforcing consumer protection, sometimes also referred to as conduct-of-business (or simply &quot;conduct&quot;) regulation and supervision of banks, and anti-money laundering supervision that aims to ensure banks implement the applicable AML/CFT framework. Deposit insurance and resolution authority are also parts of the banking regulatory and supervisory framework. Bank (prudential) supervision is a form of &quot;microprudential&quot; policy to the extent it applies to individual credit institutions, as opposed to macroprudential regulation whose intent is to consider the financial system as a whole.

==Semantics==

Banking supervision and regulation are closely intertwined, to the extent that in some jurisdictions (particularly the United States) the words &quot;regulator&quot; and &quot;supervisor&quot; are often used interchangeably in its context. Policy practice, however, makes a distinction between the setting of rules that apply to banks (regulation) and the oversight of their safety and soundness (prudential supervision), since the latter often entails a discretionary component or &quot;supervisory judgment&quot;. The global framework for banking regulation and supervision, prepared by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, makes a distinction between three &quot;pillars&quot;, namely regulation (Pillar 1), supervisory discretion (Pillar 2), and market discipline enabled by appropriate disclosure requirements (Pillar 3).

Bank licensing, which sets certain requirements for starting a new bank, is closely connected with supervision and usually performed by the same public authority. Licensing provides the licence holders the right to own and to operate a bank. The licensing process is specific to the regulatory environment of the jurisdiction where the bank is located. Licensing involves an evaluation of the entity&#x27;s intent and the ability to meet the regulatory guidelines governing the bank&#x27;s operations, financial soundness, and managerial actions. The supervisor monitors licensed banks for compliance with the requirements and responds to breaches of the requirements by obtaining undertakings, giving directions, imposing penalties or (ultimately) revoking the bank&#x27;s license. Bank supervision may be viewed as an extension of the licence-granting process. Supervisory activities involve on-site inspection of the bank&#x27;s records, operations and processes or evaluation of the reports submitted by the bank. Arguably the most important requirement in bank regulation that supervisors must enforce is maintaining capital requirements.

As banking regulation focusing on key factors in the financial markets, it forms one of the three components of financial law, the other two being case law and self-regulating market practices. Compliance with bank regulation is ensured by bank supervision.

==History==

Banking regulation and supervision has emerged mostly in the 19th century and especially the 20th century, even though embryonic forms can be traced back to earlier periods. Landmark developments include the inception of U.S. federal banking supervision with the establishment of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 1862; the creation of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as the first major deposit guarantee and bank resolution authority in 1934; the creation of the Belgian Banking Commission, Europe&#x27;s first modern banking supervisor in 1935; the start of formal banking supervision by the Bank of England in 1974, marking the eventual generalization of the practice among jurisdictions with large financial sectors; and the emergence of supranational banking supervision, first by the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank in 1983 and the Banking Commission of the West African Monetary Union in 1990 and then, at a much larger scale, with the start of European Banking Supervision in 2014.

==Objectives==

Given the interconnectedness of the banking industry and the reliance that the national (and global) economy hold on banks, it is important for regulatory agencies to maintain control over the standardized practices of these institutions. Another relevant example for the interconnectedness is that the law of financial industries or financial law focuses on the financial (banking), capital, and insurance markets. Supporters of such regulation often base their arguments on the &quot;too big to fail&quot; notion. This holds that many financial institutions (particularly investment banks with a commercial arm) hold too much control over the economy to fail without enormous consequences. This is the premise for government bailouts, in which government financial assistance is provided to banks or other financial institutions who appear to be on the brink of collapse. The belief is that without this aid, the crippled banks would not only become bankrupt, but would create rippling effects throughout the economy leading to systemic failure. Compliance with bank regulations is verified by personnel known as bank examiners.

The objectives of bank regulation, and the emphasis, vary between jurisdictions. The most common objectives are:
* prudential—to reduce the level of risk to which bank creditors are exposed (i.e. to protect depositors)
* systemic risk reduction—to reduce the risk of disruption resulting from adverse trading conditions for banks causing multiple or major bank failures
* to avoid misuse of banks—to reduce the risk of banks being used for criminal purposes, e.g. laundering the proceeds of crime
* to protect banking confidentiality
* credit allocation—to direct credit to favored sectors
* it may also include rules about treating customers fairly and having corporate social responsibility.

Among the reasons for maintaining close regulation of banking institutions is the aforementioned concern over the global repercussions that could result from a bank&#x27;s failure; the idea that these bulge bracket banks are &quot;too big to fail&quot;. The objective of federal agencies is to avoid situations in which the government must decide whether to support a struggling bank or to let it fail. The issue, as many argue, is that providing aid to crippled banks creates a situation of moral hazard. The general premise is that while the government may have prevented a financial catastrophe for the time being, they have reinforced confidence for high risk taking and provided an invisible safety net. This can lead to a vicious cycle, wherein banks take risks, fail, receive a bailout, and then continue to take risks once again.

==Instruments and requirements==

===Capital requirement===

The capital requirement sets a framework on how banks must handle their capital in relation to their assets. Internationally, the Bank for International Settlements&#x27; Basel Committee on Banking Supervision influences each country&#x27;s capital requirements. In 1988, the Committee decided to introduce a capital measurement system commonly referred to as the Basel Capital Accords. The latest capital adequacy framework is commonly known as Basel III. This updated framework is intended to be more risk sensitive than the original one, but is also a lot more complex.

===Reserve requirement===

The reserve requirement sets the minimum reserves each bank must hold to demand deposits and banknotes. This type of regulation has lost the role it once had, as the emphasis has moved toward capital adequacy, and in many countries there is no minimum reserve ratio. The purpose of minimum reserve ratios is liquidity rather than safety. An example of a country with a contemporary minimum reserve ratio is Hong Kong, where banks are required to maintain 25% of their liabilities that are due on demand or within 1 month as qualifying liquefiable assets.

Reserve requirements have also been used in the past to control the stock of banknotes and/or bank deposits. Required reserves have at times been gold, central bank banknotes or deposits, and foreign currency.

===Corporate governance===
Corporate governance requirements are intended to encourage the bank to be well managed, and is an indirect way of achieving other objectives. As many banks are relatively large, and with many divisions, it is important for management to maintain a close watch on all operations. Investors and clients will often hold higher management accountable for missteps, as these individuals are expected to be aware of all activities of the institution. Some of these requirements may include:
* to be a body corporate (i.e. not an individual, a partnership, trust or other unincorporated entity)
* to be incorporated locally, and/or to be incorporated under as a particular type of body corporate, rather than being incorporated in a foreign jurisdiction
* to have a minimum number of directors
* to have an organizational structure that includes various offices and officers, e.g. corporate secretary, treasurer/CFO, auditor, Asset Liability Management Committee, Privacy Officer, Compliance Officer etc. Also the officers for those offices may need to be approved persons, or from an approved class of persons
* to have a constitution or articles of association that is approved, or contains or does not contain particular clauses, e.g. clauses that enable directors to act other than in the best interests of the company (e.g. in the interests of a parent company) may not be allowed.

===Financial reporting and disclosure requirements===
Among the most important regulations that are placed on banking institutions is the requirement for disclosure of the bank&#x27;s finances. Particularly for banks that trade on the public market, in the US for example the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires management to prepare annual financial statements according to a financial reporting standard, have them audited, and to register or publish them. Often, these banks are even required to prepare more frequent financial disclosures, such as Quarterly Disclosure Statements. The Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 outlines in detail the exact structure of the reports that the SEC requires.

In addition to preparing these statements, the SEC also stipulates that directors of the bank must attest to the accuracy of such financial disclosures. Thus, included in their annual reports must be a report of management on the company&#x27;s internal control over financial reporting. The internal control report must include: a statement of management&#x27;s responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company; management&#x27;s assessment of the effectiveness of the company&#x27;s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the company&#x27;s most recent fiscal year; a statement identifying the framework used by management to evaluate the effectiveness of the company&#x27;s internal control over financial reporting; and a statement that the registered public accounting firm that audited the company&#x27;s financial statements included in the annual report has issued an attestation report on management&#x27;s assessment of the company&#x27;s internal control over financial reporting. Under the new rules, a company is required to file the registered public accounting firm&#x27;s attestation report as part of the annual report. Furthermore, the SEC added a requirement that management evaluate any change in the company&#x27;s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during a fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the company&#x27;s internal control over financial reporting.

===Credit rating requirement===
Banks may be required to obtain and maintain a current credit rating from an approved credit rating agency, and to disclose it to investors and prospective investors. Also, banks may be required to maintain a minimum credit rating. These ratings are designed to provide color for prospective clients or investors regarding the relative risk that one assumes when engaging in business with the bank. The ratings reflect the tendencies of the bank to take on high risk endeavors, in addition to the likelihood of succeeding in such deals or initiatives. The rating agencies that banks are most strictly governed by, referred to as the &quot;Big Three&quot; are the Fitch Group, Standard and Poor&#x27;s and Moody&#x27;s. These agencies hold the most influence over how banks (and all public companies) are viewed by those engaged in the public market. Following the 2007–2008 financial crisis, many economists have argued that these agencies face a serious conflict of interest in their core business model. Clients pay these agencies to rate their company based on their relative riskiness in the market. The question then is, to whom is the agency providing its service: the company or the market?

European financial economics experts – notably the World Pensions Council (WPC) have argued that European powers such as France and Germany pushed dogmatically and naively for the adoption of the &quot;Basel II recommendations&quot;, adopted in 2005, transposed in European Union law through the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). In essence, they forced European banks, and, more importantly, the European Central Bank itself, to rely more than ever on the standardized assessments of &quot;credit risk&quot; marketed aggressively by two US credit rating agencies – Moody&#x27;s and S&amp;P, thus using public policy and ultimately taxpayers&#x27; money to strengthen anti-competitive duopolistic practices akin to exclusive dealing. Ironically, European governments have abdicated most of their regulatory authority in favor of a non-European, highly deregulated, private cartel.

===Large exposures restrictions===
Banks may be restricted from having imprudently large exposures to individual counterparties or groups of connected counterparties. Such limitation may be expressed as a proportion of the bank&#x27;s assets or equity, and different limits may apply based on the security held and/or the credit rating of the counterparty. Restricting disproportionate exposure to high-risk investment prevents financial institutions from placing equity holders&#x27; (as well as the firm&#x27;s) capital at an unnecessary risk.

===Activity and affiliation restrictions===
In the US in response to the Great Depression of the 1930s, President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s under the New Deal enacted the Securities Act of 1933 and the Glass–Steagall Act (GSA), setting up a pervasive regulatory scheme for the public offering of securities and generally prohibiting commercial banks from underwriting and dealing in those securities. GSA prohibited affiliations between banks (which means bank-chartered depository institutions, that is, financial institutions that hold federally insured consumer deposits) and securities firms (which are commonly referred to as &quot;investment banks&quot; even though they are not technically banks and do not hold federally insured consumer deposits); further restrictions on bank affiliations with non-banking firms were enacted in Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHCA) and its subsequent amendments, eliminating the possibility that companies owning banks would be permitted to take ownership or controlling interest in insurance companies, manufacturing companies, real estate companies, securities firms, or any other non-banking company. As a result, distinct regulatory systems developed in the United States for regulating banks, on the one hand, and securities firms on the other.

==Bank supervisors==

Most jurisdictions designate one public authority as their national prudential supervisor of banks: e.g. the National Administration of Financial Regulation in China, the Financial Services Agency in Japan, or the Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom. The European Union and United States have more complex setups in which multiple organizations have authority over bank supervision. 

===European Union===

The European Banking Authority plays a key role in EU banking regulation, but is not a banking supervisor. In the banking union (which includes the euro area as well as countries that join on a voluntary basis, lately Bulgaria), the European Central Bank, through its supervisory arm also known as ECB Banking Supervision, is the hub of banking supervision and works jointly with national bank supervisors, often referred to in that context as &quot;national competent authorities&quot; (NCAs). ECB Banking Supervision and the NCAs together form European Banking Supervision, also known as the Single Supervisory Mechanism. Countries outside the banking union rely on their respective national banking supervisors. 

===United States===
The United States relies on state-level bank supervisors (or &quot;state regulators&quot;, e.g. the New York State Department of Financial Services), and at the federal level on a number of agencies involved in the prudential supervision of credit institutions: for banks, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; and for other credit institutions, the National Credit Union Administration and Federal Housing Finance Agency.

<doc id="1198319" wikidata="Q5582821" url="?curid=1198319" title="Good Netkeeping Seal of Approval">
<text>The Good NetKeeping Seal of Approval or GNKSA is a designation that indicates a piece of Usenet newsreader (client) software meets a set of usability and formatting standards. The name is a play on the &quot;Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval&quot;, a set of consumer reports issued by Good Housekeeping Magazine.

The original GNKSA author thought that many newbies to Usenet posted malformed or inappropriately-sent articles because their software did not encourage better netiquette. For instance, software which made it easy to confuse &quot;replying to a sender by email&quot; with &quot;posting a followup to a newsgroup&quot; led to users mistakenly publishing what was intended to be a private response, or vice versa.

Some of the guidelines from GNKSA 2.0 are:
*The user can see the essential header fields, including &quot;Newsgroups&quot; and &quot;Followup-To&quot;.
*The user can edit all header fields when composing a followup.
*There is a clear difference between &#x27;followup&#x27; and &#x27;reply&#x27;.
*Followups preserve the Subject and References of the original article, unless the user explicitly changes them.
*News software respects &quot;Followup-To&quot; and &quot;Reply-To&quot; specifications.
*What the user writes is what gets posted, as is.

Additional requirements concern accurate codice_1 headers, signature block formatting, and the ability to cancel and supersede articles.

<doc id="1198322" wikidata="Q1330641" url="?curid=1198322" title="Adventures of Lolo">
<text>Adventures of Lolo is a puzzle video game released in 1989 by HAL Laboratory for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is a compilation of puzzles from &quot;Eggerland: Meikyū no Fukkatsu&quot; and &quot;Eggerland: Sōzō he no Tabidachi&quot;. It is the fifth game in the &quot;Eggerland&quot; series, the third one released in Europe, but the first one released in North America. It was available on the Wii&#x27;s and Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console in North America and in PAL regions, as well as on the Nintendo Switch Online&#x27;s virtual Nintendo Entertainment System library.

The game received two direct sequels: the Japanese &quot;Adventures of Lolo&quot;, that consists entirely of new stages, and the American &quot;Adventures of Lolo 2&quot;, that is another collection of stages from earlier Japanese games. However, in 1994, a game titled &quot;Adventures of Lolo&quot; was released for Game Boy in Europe and Japan. Said Game Boy release was not the same game as the original NES release of the same name, but rather the tenth installment in the series, with continued additions to the base gameplay.

==Premise and gameplay==

The player assumes the role of Lolo, a round anthropomorphic creature. Lolo attempts to rescue Princess Lala, who has been kidnapped by the evil King Egger. Lolo travels to Egger&#x27;s castle, with 50 rooms arranged in 10 floors of five. Within each room, Lolo must collect several hearts in order to open a treasure chest and collect the gem inside, which will open the exit to the next room or floor. The player must navigate the obstacles in each room and avoid or neutralize several different types of enemies, which vary by movement and attack pattern. All enemies disappear once Lolo picks up the gem.

The player can move, slide certain blocks around the screen, and fire a limited number of shots at enemies. When an enemy is shot, it becomes encased in an egg for a short time; this can be pushed to a new location, used as a bridge to cross water, or shot again to make it disappear temporarily. Lolo can gain other powers on specific screens, such as the ability to smash rocks or build a bridge. Some enemies are not affected by Lolo&#x27;s shots.

One life is lost whenever Lolo is shot or touched by certain enemies. Others will not kill him, but can impede his movement by standing still or freezing in place when touched. The player can restart a screen at any time, at the cost of one life.

==Development and release==
&quot;Adventures of Lolo&quot; was developed and published by HAL Laboratory for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in North America in April 1989 and in Europe in February 1991. A Nintendo representative commented that Nintendo was &quot;trying to stretch the kids&#x27; imaginations&quot; with &quot;Lolo&quot;. It was re-released for the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2007 on 8 June in North America and on 6 August in PAL regions. It was also re-released for the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console by Nintendo in 2014 for North America on 15 May and in PAL regions on 21 August as well as for the Nintendo 3DS in PAL regions on 16 October 2014 and in North America on 8 January 2015, and then re-released again for the Nintendo Switch&#x27;s Online Service in December 2018.

==Reception==
&quot;Adventures of Lolo&quot; has received positive reception from critics and fans alike. &quot;Lolo&quot;″s success was surprising to its developer HAL Laboratory. &quot;Game, Set, Watch&quot;″s Todd Ciolek called it the &quot;leader of the [block-shoving] movement&quot;, garnering a cult following. IGN called it one of Satoru Iwata&#x27;s successes, describing it as something that was &quot;all about fun, appeal and simplicity over an abundance of bells and whistles&quot;. The &quot;Toronto Star&quot; listed it as one of their recommended NES games for children. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Dan Whitehead praised it for not being &quot;yet another cutesy platformer&quot;, calling it a &quot;diverting casual game&quot;. He stated that it was not a &quot;classic title that everyone should rush to own&quot;, but it was still a quality title. Writer Justin McElroy commented that he had fond memories of it, and has no worry of how well it has aged since its release on the NES, feeling that puzzle games stay &quot;enjoyable forever&quot;; however, he criticized the music, saying that its looping drove players &quot;ever closer to the dark edge of madness&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Frank Provo called it addictive, commenting that the gameplay holds up in the current day. He added that while the characters were cute, the graphics were simple, and that the game could be finished in one day. &quot;Wired&quot;″s Chris Kohler called its Virtual Console release a &quot;tempting choice&quot;. IGN&#x27;s Cam Shea said that it was not worth paying for, though it had more value than many other Virtual Console titles. IGN&#x27;s Levi Buchanan named it one of the best Virtual Console titles, saying that it will last for hours.

Author Steven Schwartz called &quot;Lolo&quot; a strategic game, and that players who have successfully done logic problems in magazines would have an easier time with this game. Similarly, Dennis Lynch of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called it a &quot;challenge of logic, not brute force&quot;, as well as &quot;addictive&quot;. He also noted that &quot;Lolo&quot; was a game that would appeal to both genders. 1UP.com&#x27;s Jeremy Parish called it a great puzzle game, calling it &quot;highly recommended&quot; due to its combination of its complexity and simplicity. IGN&#x27;s Lucas M. Thomas felt that it would be intriguing to fans of puzzle-action games, calling it &quot;simple on the surface, but deceptively complex once you get going&quot;. GameSpy&#x27;s Benjamin Turner commented that it was &quot;hard as hell&quot;, and would &quot;put any Mensa member to the test&quot;. Fellow GameSpy writer Christian Nutt bemoaned HAL for abandoning &quot;Lolo&quot; for &quot;Kirby&quot;. Nintendo Life&#x27;s Darren Calvert called its level designs &quot;ingenious&quot;, commenting that they will &quot;tax the old grey matter&quot;. Nintendo World Report&#x27;s Michael Cole commented that its gameplay remained fresh in its Wii release, as well as &quot;approachable&quot;.

&quot;Adventures of Lolo&quot;″s gameplay has been compared to several other video games by critics. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s Heidi Kemps compared &quot;Ivy the Kiwi?&quot;″s gameplay to &quot;Lolo&quot;″s. Selby Bateman of &quot;Game Players&quot; magazine compared the adventurous experience of &quot;Lolo&quot; to &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot;, calling the former more sophisticated. 1UP.com&#x27;s Kevin Gifford compared it to &quot;Wrecking Crew&quot;. IGN compared &quot;Kickle Cubicle&quot; to &quot;Lolo&quot;, though noting that it was easier. Writer Danny Cowan compared the video game &quot;Roll Away&quot; and said that it was similar to the &quot;find the key/find the exit&quot; gameplay of &quot;Lolo&quot;. It has also been the inspiration for other video games; video game developer Ryan Clark attributed the inspiration for his video game &quot;Professor Fizzwizzle&quot; in part to &quot;Adventures of Lolo&quot;. &quot;LIT&quot; developer Adam Tierney drew inspiration for &quot;LIT&quot; from &quot;Lolo&quot;.

===Legacy===
&quot;Adventures of Lolo&quot; was followed by two sequels for the Japanese FamiCom and two sequels for the NES: the Japanese &quot;Adventures of Lolo&quot; and &quot;Adventures of Lolo 2&quot;, consisting of new stages, the American &quot;Adventures of Lolo 2&quot; (another compilation of stages from earlier games) and &quot;Adventures of Lolo 3&quot; (based on the Japanese &quot;Adventures of Lolo 2&quot;, but consisting mostly of new stages). A Game Boy follow-up was released in 1994 in Japan as &quot;Lolo no Daibouken&quot;, but it was localized with the same name, &quot;Adventures of Lolo&quot;.

Lolo and Lala, the game&#x27;s protagonists, have appeared under the monikers Lololo and Lalala in &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; and later in its adaptation in &quot;Kirby Super Star&quot;, as well as in &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Avalanche&quot;, where they play an antagonistic role. After these appearances, they have remained as occasional recurring characters in the Kirby series, making cameos in various installments. Both game series are made by HAL Laboratory, Inc. Both Lololo and Lalala also appear in the series&#x27; anime adaptation: . There is also a Lolo reference in &quot;Super Meat Boy.&quot;

<text>Japan Remote Control Co., Ltd. (日本遠隔制御株式会社; &quot;Nippon Enkaku Seigyo Kabushiki Gaisha&quot;) (commonly called source Propo, source Racing, or hum) was a Japanese manufacturer of popular radio control devices including transmitters, receivers, servos, electronics, programmable robots and model aircraft. JR has ceased production of RC equipment.

==Overview==
Unique to JR Propo&#x27;s radios is the company&#x27;s patented ABC&amp;W technology, or Automatic Blocking Circuit with Window. Simply put, this system rapidly reroutes incoming signals through a series of ever-smaller electronic &quot;windows,&quot; effectively blocking out spurious signals which cause radio &quot;glitching&quot;. Any signal that does get through the system is filtered before being sent to the servos all without noticeable lag or delay. If the signal is unable to be processed, it is rejected, again without noticeable reaction.

Competing brands of radio control systems include, Spektrum RC, Sanwa, Futaba, Hitec, KO Propo, Jeti, Acoms and Multiplex Modelsport.

<text>English Electric DP1, commonly known as Deltic, is a prototype demonstrator locomotive employing two Napier Deltic engines, built by English Electric in 1955.

The high power of the locomotive at an acceptably low axleload resulted in 22 similar locomotives being ordered by British Railways for use on East Coast Main Line express passenger services, the serial production of which became the British Rail Class 55.

==Background and design==

The English Electric company, which had absorbed the aeroengine-maker D. Napier &amp; Son into its group at the instruction of the Ministry of Aircraft Production in 1942, was a major builder of diesel and electric locomotives. The two George Nelsons (Sir George, and his son, known in the works as &quot;Half&quot;) saw the potential of Napier&#x27;s Deltic engine for rail traction and in 1954–1955 built a demonstrator at its Dick, Kerr works in Preston. Officially numbered DP1, its internal project title was &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and it was intended that the locomotive would carry that name. However, in 1954, before completion, Hudswell Clarke announced a range of small diesel-mechanical locomotives using the same name. After initial trials in 1955, the locomotive received the word &quot;Deltic&quot; in large cream capital letters on its sides, and the name became synonymous with the locomotive.

Long aluminium beadings on the sides were painted cream, a visual device to make the locomotive&#x27;s high sides appear more slender and add to the impression of speed. Three curved chevrons on each nose, in the same cream, added to that effect. To British eyes, the locomotive&#x27;s bulldog nose styling was reminiscent of American locomotives, such as the EMD E-unit or ALCO PA designs (partly because English Electric initially planned to offer the type for export), with high noses and small, somewhat swept-back cab windows set behind them. To add to the American look of the locomotive, a large headlight was to have been fitted to each nose (the lights were never installed but would have been of the rotating &#x27;Mars Light&#x27; type as fitted to North American locomotives of the era). Two 18-cylinder Deltic engines were fitted, derated from the 1,750 horsepower (1.3 MW) of the marine engines used in minesweepers to 1,650 horsepower (1.2 MW) each, generating 3,300 horsepower (2.5 MW) total. This derating reduced the stress on the engines, thereby increasing the service life and length of time between overhauls.

==Service and testing==

The locomotive first saw service on the London Midland Region of British Railways in 1955, generally operating fast London to Liverpool freight trains; it was withdrawn and after modifications re-entered services in 1956. Tests were carried out on the Settle to Carlisle line in August/September 1956, after which it operated passenger trains, &quot;The Shamrock&quot; and &quot;The Merseyside Express&quot;, between London Euston and Liverpool Lime Street, followed by London-Carlisle trains, and in 1957, returning to London-Liverpool trains. The region&#x27;s chief mechanical and electrical engineer, J.F. Harrison, rejected the design, believing high-speed engines (i.e. 1500 rpm) unsuitable for railway applications.

In 1957, Gerry Fiennes, the line traffic manager on the former Great Northern route out of London King&#x27;s Cross station, was seeking high power locomotives to run services on the East Coast Main Line, having found the 2000 hp English Electric type 4 locomotives produced under the 1955 modernisation plan lacking sufficient power for his planned timings; as a consequence he proposed using &#x27;Deltic&#x27; type locomotives on the line. Objections to the order included those arising from: a limited permitted top speed due to the mass of the locomotive; the potential for the order to delay a proposed (1957) electrification scheme of the line; as well as the size which required modifications to the King&#x27;s Cross platforms. An order was placed in 1959 for 22 Class 55s to replace 55 steam locomotives.

==Preservation==
DP1 was in service until 24 November 1960 when a severe oil leak in one of the engines was discovered. The locomotive was sent to English Electric Company&#x27;s Works at Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire the next day for repair. However no repairs were sanctioned and the locomotive was withdrawn from service in March 1961 having completed . Plans to test it in Canada fell through, and the locomotive was donated in April 1963 to the Science Museum, South Kensington and placed on public display.

After 30 years at the Science Museum, it was transferred to the National Railway Museum, York in October 1993. About 11 years later it was moved north to the National Railway Museum Shildon, County Durham in July 2004. In August 2012 it was loaned to The Ribble Steam Railway in Preston, Lancashire, which is barely a mile away from where it was originally built, returning to Shildon in October 2015 
 where it remains as of January 2023.

Restoring the two Deltic engines installed in DP1 to running condition is not feasible. The engines (Type E158, D18-12) although similar, differ from those used in British Rail Class 55 locomotives (Type E169, D18-25B). Aside from the original issue with the severe oil leak in the phasing gear cover, significant engine components were removed for use as spare parts for the Royal Navy prior to DP1 being donated to the Science Museum as the locomotive was not owned by British Railways.

==Models==

The Kitmaster company produced an unpowered polystyrene injection moulded model kit for OO gauge. In late 1962, the Kitmaster brand was sold by its parent company (Rosebud Dolls) to Airfix, who did not release model kits of this locomotive. In time, the Airfix tools passed on to Dapol who rediscovered the moulding tools and have since produced the model kit.

In 2007 model manufacturer Bachmann Branchline and the National Railway Museum announced the release of an OO gauge model of the DP1 for sale at the NRM Shop. Bachmann used laser-scanning (see 3D scanner) of the machine at the National Railway Museum Shildon to collect dimensional data of the locomotive. The model was praised for its attention to fine detail and smooth and powerful running. The model was produced in a limited edition of 3,000 items in total. 500 were supplied with a display plinth and a &quot;Merseyside Express&quot; headboard. Bachmann released a British N gauge model under the Graham Farish brand in 2010.

In February 2023 Hornby announced a new diecast Dublo tooling in OO gauge of the Deltic prototype locomotive, English Electric DP1 &#x27;Deltic&#x27;, fitted with sound (R30297TXS).

<text>Syed Hussain Sibt-e-Asghar Naqvi, commonly known by his pen name Jaun Elia, 14 December 1931 – 8 November 2002), was a Pakistani poet. One of the most prominent modern Urdu poets of (odes), popular for his unconventional ways, he &quot;acquired knowledge of philosophy, logic, Islamic history, the Muslim Sufi tradition, Muslim religious sciences, Western literature, and &quot;Kabbala&quot;&quot;. He was fluent in Urdu, Arabic, Sindhi, English, Persian, Sanskrit and Hebrew.

== Early life and family ==
Jaun Elia was born on 14 December 1931 in Amroha, India into an educated Shia family. His father, Shafiq Hasan Elia, was a scholar of literature and astronomy well-versed in the Arabic, English, Persian, Hebrew and Sanskrit languages, and who corresponded with leading intellectuals like Bertrand Russell. Jaun Elia was the youngest of his siblings: his brother Rais Amrohvi was a poet and psychoanalyst while another brother, Syed Mohammed Taqi, was a philosopher and a translator who had translated Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. Indian film director Kamal Amrohi was his first cousin. Another relative in Pakistan is actor Munawar Saeed, famous for his roles as a villain.

Described as a child prodigy, Jaun was initially educated at the Syed-ul-Madaris in Amroha, a madrasa affiliated with the Darul Uloom Deoband.

He married writer Zahida Hina  in the year 1970. They divorced in the year 1984.

== Writing career ==
He began writing poetry when he was 8 but published his first collection, &quot;Shayad&quot;, when he was 60.

== Political views ==

=== Partition and migration to Pakistan ===
Being a communist, Elia opposed the partition of India. However, he eventually migrated to Pakistan in 1957, and decided to live in Karachi.

=== Communism ===
In his poems, he supported communism in Pakistan. References to class consciousness are also seen in his poems. He also was described as &quot;An anarchist, a nihilist, and a poet&quot; by dunyanews.tv.

== Legacy and popular culture == 

Poet Pirzada Qasim said:
In 2020, Punjabi rapper Kay Kap&#x27;s album &quot;Rough Rhymes for Tough Times&quot; featured a song entitled &quot;Bulaava&quot; which had couplets from the poem &quot;Pehnaayi Ka Makaan&quot; written and recited by Jaun Elia.

In 2020, Pakistani rock-fusion band Nishtar Park released a single &quot;Purane Aur Naye Sawal&quot; which was based on Elia&#x27;s ghazal &quot;Umr Guzaregi Imtihan Mein Kya&quot;.

In 2023, Urdu rapper Talha Anjum’s album &quot;Open Letter&quot; featured a song entitled &quot;Secrets&quot; which was strongly influenced by Jaun Elia’s poem &quot;Be-dilli Kya Yuhin Din Guzar Jaenge&quot;. Talha Anjum’s other works are also heavily influenced by Jaun Elia’s poetry.

<text>Action Quake 2 is a mod for the video game &quot;Quake II&quot; created by The A-Team. &quot;Action Quake 2&quot; was developed to recreate the look and feel of an action movie, having a fast pace and a semi-realistic damage system. It features many maps recreating realistic settings, such as city streets and office buildings, with a balanced range of weapons and equipment inspired by action movies.

&quot;Action Quake 2&quot; is essentially a version of deathmatch and team deathmatch in which most of the classic elements have been modified to some degree. Damage to extremities such as a shot to the leg with any weapon will cause damage and bleeding, along with crippling the player&#x27;s movement until they bandage themselves. Originally released in 1998, there is still an active community of players as of 2024.

== Overview ==

With a then unique style of play, realistic weapons and fast pace, &quot;Action Quake 2&quot; became one of the most popular &quot;Quake II&quot; mods. The mod caught the attention of id Software in June 1998, who wished to include it in their upcoming &quot;Quake II: Internet Pack No. 1 (Netpack 1): Extremities&quot;, a commercial add-on product for &quot;Quake II&quot;. This expansion CD was released in the U.S. on November 26, 1998, included was the final version 1.0c of &quot;Action Quake&quot;, along with 11 other publicly available mods, a collection of &quot;Quake 2&quot; deathmatch maps, and player skins. Members of the development team would later go on to work on titles such as &quot;Action Half-Life&quot; and &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;.

== Gameplay ==
There are six main modes of gameplay in &quot;Action Quake 2&quot;: Deathmatch (Free For All) and Teamplay. In Deathmatch, spawn points are distributed over most of the map, and players battle out in a free-for-all fashion in an attempt to get the most kills possible. The map changes when one of two conditions is met: either the timelimit is reached (and whoever has the most frags &quot;wins&quot;), or the fraglimit is reached (and whoever reaches it &quot;wins&quot;). By default, each player spawns with only pistol, and a combat knife. Additional equipment can be picked up throughout the map, but in &quot;Action Quake 2&quot; DM all weapons other than pistols, knives, and grenades are &quot;unique&quot;, meaning that only one exists on that map at any time. Other modes are variations on these themes including Capture The Flag, team Deathmatch, Espionage and Offline play.

In Teamplay, players are split into two teams and play is round based. Players select one primary weapon and one item to use, in addition to the default pistol and knife. The teams spawn on opposite sides of the map and are then let loose to kill each other. If one team eliminates the other, they win the round.

== Legacy ==
Decades after the release, the game still had an active community in Finland. It sparked a remake using Id Tech 3 called &quot;Reaction&quot;. An updated standalone version based on the Open-Source release of Quake II called &quot;AQtion&quot; was re-released on Steam in 2022.

<text>Buraq Hajib, also spelt Baraq Hajib (died 1234), was a Khitan who founded the Qutlugh-Khanid dynasty in the southern Persian province of Kirman the early 13th century after the conquest of the sinicised Qara Khitai (Western Liao dynasty) by the Mongol Empire. The dynasty founded by Buraq Hajib ended in the 14th century.

==Origin==
The Khitans in northern China were known as خطا in Arabic (&quot;Khata&quot;) and are mentioned by Muslim chroniclers as having fought against Muslims and founded the Qara Khitai (Western Liao dynasty). After the destruction of the Qara Khitai realm by the Mongols under Genghis Khan in 1218, the former land of the Qara Khitai became absorbed into the Mongol Empire. A small part of the population under Buraq Hajib settled in the Persian province of Kirman, converted to Islam, and established a local dynasty there.

==Early years==

Buraq Hajib is thought to be a member of Qara Khitai dynasty and a son of a Khitan noble Kulduz. Buraq Hajib and his brother Hamīd Pur (or Khan Temür) Tayangu were detained or captured by Muhammad of Khwarezm in 1210, and were given important posts. He was initially in the service of Khwarazm prince Ghiyas-ad-Din Purshah, under whom he was nicknamed &quot;Qutlugh Khan&quot;. He was soon appointed as the commander of Isfahan for Khwarazmshahs. He arrived at Kerman at first as a commander of Purshah&#x27;s army, joining him in the battle against Salghurid atabeg Sa&#x27;d I. However, he had an argument with Purshah&#x27;s vizier Tajaddin Karim ash-Sharq and left for India hearing approachment of a Mongol army under command of Tolun Cherbi (step-son of Hoelun). While on his way to India, Buraq was attacked by the local governor of Kirman - Shuja ad-Din Abul-Qasim, but Buraq managed to defeat him thanks to defection of Turks and decided to start a siege of Kirman. He had submit to Jalal ad-Din at first, offering her daughter&#x27;s hand, who in turn helped him to conquer Kirman. He quickly got involved in local politics, aiding Nasrid emir Ali b. Harb in his struggle to throne in 1225.

== Reign ==
In 1228 Khwarazm prince Ghiyas-ad-Din Purshah sought refuge in Kirman after incurring the wrath of his brother, Sultan Jalal ad-Din. Using favorable situation, Buraq forced him to give his mother&#x27;s hand, marrying her. After a revelation of conspiracy involving two Khitan nobles and Ghiyas-ad-Din. he and his mother was soon murdered by Buraq. Sometime later Buraq converted to Islam and requested the Abbasid Caliph for investiture and was granted a title of Qutlugh Sultan. His next action was to ally to Atabegs of Yazd through marriage. Buraq later submitted to the Mongol Empire, and he and his successors were conferred the title of Qutlugh Khan, and allowed to ruled as vassal of the Mongols. Throughout its rule the dynasty continued to be known as Qara Khitai. There were a total of 9 rulers of the Kirmanid dynasty, two of whom were female.

He sent his son Rukn al-Din Mubarak Khwaja to Ögedei&#x27;s court just before his death in 1234/5. He was succeeded by his nephew Qutb al-Din Mohammad.

== Family ==
He had at least two wives - a widow of Muhammad II of Khwarazm and Uka Khatun. His only son was Rukn al-Din Mubarak Khwaja who was born of Uka Khatun. Kutlugh Turkan was probably one of his concubines, although according to Fatema Mernissi she was his daughter Khan Turkan (see below). He had at least 4 daughters:

* A daughter - married to Jalal ad-Din
* Sevinch Khatun - married to Chagatai
* Khan Turkan - married to his nephew Qutb al-Din Mohammad. According to Vladimir Minorsky, her identity was mistaken for Kutlugh Turkan.
* Yaqut Turkan - married to Mahmud Shah (r. 1229-1241), Atabeg of Yazd
* Maryam Turkan - married to Mohyi al-Din, nephew of Sam ibn Wardanruz, Atabeg of Yazd

<doc id="1198384" wikidata="Q4830437" url="?curid=1198384" title="Axholme Joint Railway">
<text>The Axholme Joint Railway was a committee created as a joint enterprise between the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;Y) and the North Eastern Railway (NER) and was established by the North Eastern Railway Act 1902 (2 Edw. 7. c. clxviii) of 31 July 1902. It took over the Goole and Marshland Railway, running from Marshland Junction near to and , and the Isle of Axholme Light Railway, running from Reedness Junction to . Construction of the Goole and Marshland Railway had begun in 1898, and by the time of the takeover in early 1903, was virtually complete. The Isle of Axholme Light Railway was started in 1899, but only the section from Reedness Junction to was complete at the takeover. The northern section opened on 10 August 1903, and the line from Crowle to Haxey Junction opened for passengers on 2 January 1905.

A branch to Hatfield Moor was opened in 1909, but traffic from the peat works at Hatfield did not start to use the railway until 1913, when the company extended their line into the works. Traffic was mainly agricultural produce, together with peat from Hatfield Moor and from Swinefleet Peat Works which processed peat from Thorne Moors. Passenger services ceased in 1933, although occasional excursion trains continued to be run. The Haxey Junction to section closed in 1956, the Hatfield Moor Branch closed in 1964, and the remainder closed in 1965. However, most of the tracks were retained and operated as a long siding, to allow it to be used to carry heavy parts from Keadby Power Station across the Stainforth and Keadby Canal, as the bridge on the A161 road could not support the weight. The road bridge was replaced in 1970, and the rails were finally removed in 1972.

==History==
The Isle of Axholme lies to the west of the River Trent and to the east of Hatfield Chase, a vast area of low-lying land which was described as a badly drained swamp in the 1620s. It was recorded as Axeyholme, with the three syllables &quot;Ax-ey-holme&quot; meaning water-island-island being contributed by successive groups of Celts, Angles and Danes. In the reign of King Charles I, the Dutch drainage engineer Cornelius Vermuyden set about draining Hatfield Chase, containing some of wetland, in 1626. The River Don, River Torne and River Idle were re-routed and re-channelled, and although there were some flaws in the initial scheme, and considerable social unrest, including damage of the drainage works, the unrest was finally resolved in 1719, and the agriculture of the area prospered. The Stainforth and Keadby Canal cut across the region in 1802, providing some transport facilities, but the coming of the railway age resulted in calls for railways to be built to carry the agricultural produce to market.

===Precursors===
The South Yorkshire Railway built a line which ran broadly parallel to the Stainforth and Keadby Canal, passing through . Two plans for railways from London to York, which would have crossed the Isle, were proposed but not built, while the more local Isle of Axholme Extension Railway would have linked Haxey, Epworth, Crowle and Thorne. In 1846, the railway financier George Hudson proposed a line from Goole to be called the Isle of Axholme, Gainsborough and York and North Midland Junction Railway, which failed to obtain an act of Parliament, but much of its route was used by the railway which did eventually get built.

In 1882, the Isle of Axholme and Marshland Steam Tramway was authorised by the &#x27;. It would run from Haxey to Crowle, and would use a gauge of . However, in 1883 the company joined forces with, and was then taken over by, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway to resist a proposal for the Goole, Epworth and Owston Railway. The defeat of the rival scheme was resented by local businessmen. Under an act of Parliament, the &#x27; (48 &amp; 49 Vict. c. liv), the tramway was abandoned and the Isle of Axholme Railway was authorised, but this too was abandoned three years later by another act of Parliament, the (51 &amp; 52 Vict. c. viii). Nothing more happened, until the passing of the Light Railways Act 1896 (59 &amp; 60 Vict. c. 48), which meant that rural railways could be authorised by an order from the Board of Trade, rather than having to obtain a costly act of Parliament.

===Proposals===
The Goole and Marshland Light Railway was one of the first to take advantage of the new Light Railways Act 1896 (59 &amp; 60 Vict. c. 48). A public enquiry held in Goole on 8 October 1897 showed that the plans, which would cost £59,602 to implement, had local support, and the farmers&#x27; club estimated that the railway would carry 51,625 tons of agricultural produce per year. The Goole and Marshland Light Railway Order 1898 was issued on 16 August 1898, enabling construction to proceed. It sanctioned four railways and a road. Leaving the Doncaster to Goole main line (Hull and Doncaster Branch), a line composed of two of the railways ran to Adlingfleet via , and there were branches to Swinefleet and Luddington. of road were needed to provide access to the railway. The maximum speed was restricted to , and locomotives with tenders were not allowed to run tender-first.

The Isle of Axholme Light Railway was proposed in 1897, running from to Crowle via and . At Haxey, it would join the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway, while at Crowle it would pass over and also connect to the Great Central Railway, and would join the Goole and Marshland Light Railway at . Two branches, to Hatfield Moor and Newlands, were proposed. Like its northern neighbour, the plans had strong local support, and a light railway order, the Isle of Axholme Light Railway Order 1899, was granted on 11 March 1899. A request by the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation Company that the swing bridge over the canal near Crowle should be maintained in the open position to allow free passage of boats, rather than in the closed position to prefer the railway, was refused, as was an application for running powers over the line by the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway.

Neither railway remained independent for long. Both were negotiating with the North Eastern Railway by January 1900, and agreement was reached that the larger railway would run both of the new lines, also representing them at the Railway Clearing House. As well as the agricultural traffic, the route would provide access to coal from the South Yorkshire coalfields. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway also needed routes into the coalfields, and the two companies agreed with the two new railways on a takeover plan. The North Eastern Railway Act 1902 (2 Edw. 7. c. clxviii) of 31 July 1902 dissolved, transferred to and vested both companies in the North Eastern and the Lancashire and Yorkshire railway companies jointly, with three directors appointed by each company. They paid £73,500 for the Goole and Marshland line, which had been completed, and £27,500 for the Isle of Axholme Light Railway, which was still in the early stages of construction.

===Construction===
Construction of the Goole and Marshland Light Railway began on 22 September 1898 at Eastoft, where the first sod was cut by the chairman, William Halkon. There was some initial disagreement with the North Eastern Railway over Marshland Junction, but this was resolved in December, and the first section of the virtually flat railway was opened from Marshland Junction to Reedness Junction on 8 January 1900, initially for goods traffic only. A locomotive and two open wagons were used to form a Directors&#x27; train to inspect the line to Eastoft on 26 June, and the North Eastern Railway carried out a survey in December before purchasing the line. At the time, the railway was open as far at , and the final section to Garthorpe was expected to be laid within a month. Eastoft station was completed, and the expected Reedness Junction, Luddington and Garthorpe stations to be finished to a similar standard. Garthorpe station was eventually renamed .

The railway claimed its first lives when two contractor&#x27;s locomotives collided in thick fog near Eastoft on 4 January 1901. Both of the locomotives were damaged, and the crew of one were scalded when the boiler tubes burst. The driver died the following day, and the stoker a few days after that. Another inspection train was run on 26 June 1901, starting from Reedness Junction and visiting, according to the &quot;Crowle Advertiser&quot;, Creyke Siding, Garthorpe and Crowle. The train consisted of two first-class carriages and an open truck. A dinner was held at the Darby and Joan Hotel in Crowle, before the party returned to Reedness. Although Creyke siding was mentioned, this term was normally applied to a siding serving Creyke&#x27;s peat works on the North Eastern Railway main line to the south of Marshland Junction.
The cutting of the first sod for the Isle of Axholme Light Railway was an altogether grander occasion. It took place on 20 July 1899, and was reported at great length in the &quot;Epworth Bells&quot; newspaper. The ceremony was performed by Miss Bletcher, the daughter of one of the Directors, after which a luncheon for a large number of people was held in a marquee. Following speeches, about 400 children were given a free tea in the Temperance Hall, while adults were catered for in the schoolrooms of four local chapels. Sports were then held, watched by a crowd of 1,500, and finally there was a fireworks display. Most of the children later received a commemorative medal.

Construction proceeded slowly, to the extent that there were letters in the local newspaper complaining about the delays. The first train ran into Epworth on 25 November 1901, to test the new bridge, and the event was attended by a crowd of over 400. The line involved more earthworks than the Goole and Marshland Light Railway, with major cuttings at Haxey and Epworth, where steam excavators were used, and a swing bridge over the canal at Crowle. The first fatality was a 15-year-old boy who was hit by a rock during blasting, and died at Doncaster Hospital in early 1902.

By the end of 1902, the section from Crowle to Reedness Junction was finished, as was the line from Epworth to Haxey Junction. The railways became part of the Axholme Joint Railway in early 1903, and the northern sections, from Marshland Junction to Fockerby and Crowle, were opened for passengers and goods on 10 August 1903 19 November 1903. Only Crowle swing bridge remained to be finished by March 1904, and the southern section opened for goods traffic on 14 November. The Board of Trade required several improvements to be made before it passed the line as suitable for passengers, and the formal opening took place on 2 January 1905. The work had involved excavating of earth to form the cuttings between Epworth and Haxey, and another had been used to construct the embankments by Crowle swing bridge. of bricks and of concrete had also been used. Since 17 February 1904, the official name of the undertaking had been the Isle of Axholme Joint Railway (NE and L&amp;Y Joint).

===Hatfield Moor branch===
An application for a light railway order for the Hatfield Moor Extension Light Railway was made in November 1904, and was granted on 5 August 1905. The contract to build it was given to John Moffat of Manchester on 27 September 1907, and the contract price was £14,649. Construction took one and a half years, and the branch opened on 1 March 1909. Because the area through which it ran is low-lying, and had been the subject of drainage schemes since 1626, the railway had several bridges over rivers and drains. Between Epworth and Sandtoft goods station, it crossed the Folly Drain, the New Idle River and the River Torne. Beyond the station it crossed the North Idle Drain, and then ran along the bank of the Hatfield Waste Drain to reach its terminus at Hatfield Moor, close to the Hatfield Peat Works, then owned by the British Moss Litter Company (BMLC).

Facilities were limited, with a borehole deep supplying a water column at Sandtoft, and a run-round loop with a lever frame at Hatfield Moor, where the staff consisted of a single porter. Traffic was agricultural, but the railway company hoped to obtain the peat traffic. They held discussions in September 1909, but the continued to transport their peat overland to Maud&#x27;s Bridge goods yard, on the Doncaster to Scunthorpe line. The Axholme Joint Railway then built a loading dock for the peat, which was completed in December 1911, but still did not succeed in getting the peat traffic. An agreement was eventually made in April 1913, which required the Railway Company to extend their line into the peat works. When completed, all peat left the works on the Axholme Joint Railway. It continued to serve the works until 30 September 1963, and was formally closed on 29 February 1964.

There was a siding from the main line to Swinefleet Works, which was also owned by the British Moss Litter Company. The works had a steam railway which ran northwards from the works to the banks of the River Ouse at Swinefleet Clough. The line crossed the intended route of the Reedness Junction to Fockerby Branch, and the North Eastern Railway met with the in October 1902, hoping that they could persuade them to waive their right to a level crossing, in return for a payment. The exact outcome is not clear, but a siding was laid into the works, which was operational from 10 August 1903, and the peat railway was lifted at about that time. Peat was brought to the works by a network of railways spreading out southwards across Thorne Moors.

===Operation===
Passenger traffic was sparse through most of the life of the railway. In 1905, three trains per day ran from Goole to Haxey Junction and back, with a separate train operating on the Fockerby Branch. By November, only the morning and evening train ran, except on Wednesdays. A coal strike in 1912 resulted in all services being withdrawn except on Wednesdays and Saturdays for a period of three weeks. At a public meeting held in October 1920, users complained about the poor service and the lack of trucks to carry goods. The chairman of the Isle of Axholme Rural District Council was particularly exasperated by the fact that the trains arrived at Haxey Junction shortly after the trains on the other line had departed.

Motor buses appeared in the district from 1924, and passenger numbers dropped. Cheap fares and a steam railcar did not halt the decline, although in the last days of operation, five trains were run on Saturdays, three on Wednesdays and two on other weekdays. The last trains ran on 15 July 1933, with all passenger services suspended from Monday 17 July. In addition to timetabled services, excursions were run, with Epworth, the birthplace of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism being popular. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway published a booklet entitled &quot;Epworth: What to see and how to get there&quot; to entice people to travel there from Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire. Excursions from the Isle of Axholme to Blackpool were popular, with over 600 passengers on such a trip in 1913, and 750 visiting the Great Yorkshire Show at Hull in 1922. Excursions to Blackpool continued to be run even after timetabled passenger services were withdrawn.

Early freight traffic consisted of agricultural products, including carrots, celery, clover, peas, potatoes, sugar beet and swedes, together with large volumes of peat from Swinefleet Works near Reedness Junction and from Hatfield Works on the Hatfield Moor Branch. Traffic into the area included manure. In the 1920s, stations notified the control centre at Goole of the number of wagons they would need for consignments of peas and potatoes, and could also request additional trains. 4,000 tons of green peas were despatched during the 1926 growing season, and in the following year, 7,000 bundles of celery left Epworth station in a three-day period. Traffic started to decline in the 1930s, as motor lorries began to take some of the trade. By 1937, there were only three workings each day, and those were run if required. The peat works at Hatfield was still supplying an average of six wagon-loads per day.

===Closure===
The line closed to passengers on 15 July 1933. The section from Haxey Junction to Epworth was closed on 1 February 1956, by which time most of the traffic was peat, supplemented by seasonal sugar-beet. The branch to Hatfield Moors was rarely used from 1962, when small diesel locomotives had replaced steam traction, and was closed on 30 September 1963. The rest of the system closed on 5 April 1965.

Although closed, the line was not lifted, and was maintained as a long siding until 1972, on behalf of the Central Electricity Generating Board, who paid for its maintenance. This was to facilitate the maintenance of the stators from Keadby Power Station, which were too heavy to be transported over the bridge where the A161 road crossed the Stainforth and Keadby Canal. When required, the heavy haulage company Pickfords would move a stator by road to Ealand depot, to the south of Crowle. It would then be loaded onto the railway, and moved across the canal to Belton, where it would be transferred back to the road vehicle. The A161 road bridge was replaced by Lindsey County Council in 1970, and the complicated manoeuvres became unnecessary. Consequently, the rails were removed in 1972.

==Route==
The Goole and Marshland Light Railway ran from Marshland Junction, south east of Goole on the North Eastern Railway Hull to Thorne line, to Reedness Junction with a branch line from Reedness to Fockerby on the River Trent estuary. The junction with the North Eastern Railway faced Goole, and all traffic started from or proceeded to Goole. Since the railway served the needs of the agricultural community, there were many sidings, where wagons could be stored for loading and unloading. On the first section, these were Plumtree Farm siding, Dougherty&#x27;s siding, Corner&#x27;s siding, Smith&#x27;s siding, Glossop&#x27;s siding, and Goole Fields siding, before the railway crossed over Swinefleet Warping Drain on a steel girder bridge to reach Reedness station.

Between Smith&#x27;s and Glossop&#x27;s sidings, the track was crossed by a tramway owned by the British Moss Litter Company and used for conveying peat. The tramway had been built in 1896, and a ground frame was installed to control conflicting train movements. The proposed that the tramway should be cut in two, with each half extended westwards, to run alongside Smith&#x27;s siding and a new siding opposite it on the other side of the main line, but this was rejected. In 1905 they proposed a tunnel under their line, with gradients on the tramway not exceeding 1 in 20 on both sides. Although agreements were drawn up, the plan does not appear to have been implemented. The tramway was of narrow gauge, was about long, and used a steam locomotive. It served Old Goole Mill, although further details of either the mill or the locomotive have not been found. Although the mill closed soon after 1902, it was used for storing peat until 1914, and the tracks were not lifted until many years later. In 1903, some twelve trains per day crossed over the Axholme Joint Railway on the tramway.

The bridge over Swinefleet Warping Drain was the subject of an unusual request from Colonel Thompson in 1906, who asked permission for 16 of his female potato pickers to cross it to reach their place of work. To access it, they would need to walk through the goods yard and along the main line, but it would save them having to walk much further each day. The request was granted, provided that the Colonel indemnified the railway against any claims made if the ladies were involved in an accident.

At Reedness, the Fockerby Branch turned to the north, and the Axholme Light Railway route swung to the south. Reedness Junction had a brick-built water tower, a house for the station master, and sidings to the north, accessible from the Fockerby Branch. It was some from the village centre of Swinefleet, and from Reedness village. The Branch was long. Blackers siding and Whitgift siding were passed before the line reached Eastoft station, which was north of the village centre. There were two sidings to the north. After crossing the road beside the Adlingfleet Drain, the proposed line to Adlinfleet would have continued beside the drain, but the line to Fockerby as built turned to the south-east. It passed Boltgate siding to reach Luddington station, with two sidings to the south, but still from the village. Next came Pindar&#x27;s siding, after which the line curved to the north to reach Fockerby, where there were two sidings and a run-around loop. 
Returning to Reedness Junction, the line started as the Axholme Light Railway ran from there to Haxey. After Moor&#x27;s Farm siding, Peat Moss Works siding, which serviced Swinefleet Peat Works, and Spilman&#x27;s siding, the line reached Crowle. Here there was a passing loop and three sidings to the west. To the south of the station was Ealand Depot, with two sidings, which were added after representations were made by farmers. Beyond, the line rose on an embankment to Crowle swing bridge, crossing three brick arches over a road and a drain, a girder bridge over the Scunthorpe to Doncaster main line, and another brick arch as it approached. The main girders were long, and the bridge was built by the Cleveland Bridge &amp; Engineering Company of Darlington. To the south of it was a twelve-arched viaduct known as Crowle Arches, which crossed the Hatfield Waste Drain, the North Engine Drain, the River Torne and the A18 road, and beyond that, another nine-arched viaduct spanning the South Engine Drain and the Folly Drain, beyond which the railway started to descend to return to ground level.

Hagg Lane siding, near the village of Belton, was next, from where John Blether agreed to forward 2,500 tons per year. Using Army-surplus equipment from the First World War, he built of gauge tramway in 1920 to bring produce from his farm to the sidings. The length of track was gradually extended to , and the wagons were pulled by horses. Usage declined after the Second World War, and the tramway was closed in 1953. Belton station had a passing loop, with three sidings and a loading dock, which was used for sugar-beet traffic. The station was regularly used by the photographer J. Bottomley in the 1920s, who would arrive with his photographic caravan loaded on a truck, and recorded life in the district.

A brickworks and clay pit were served by the next siding. It was not constructed until 1936, and continued in use until the line closed. The line rose on an embankment to cross the A161 road, and then entered a cutting, where it was joined by the Hatfield Moors branch, the two running parallel for some before the cutting became an embankment, and they joined near Epworth station. Epworth had a passing loop and sidings to the east, with the track crossing the High Street on a brick bridge to the south of the station.

Next came Burnham Lane siding, and then a high embankment, pierced by two brick bridges, which were wide enough for double track, although they only ever carried a single track, followed by another deep cutting. Haxey station had a passing loop and three sidings. It was originally called Haxey Central, and then Haxey Town AJR, and eventually became Haxey Town. The line continued on an embankment, crossed Ferry Drain and Warping Drain by a brick bridge, and turned to the south-east to reach the terminus at Haxey Junction Station. The adjacent station on the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway line between Doncaster and Gainsborough, to which it was connected by a line which required two reversals, was called .
Marshland Junction to Haxey was a distance of , although working timetables normally showed the distance from Goole, which was from Haxey. The freight-only branch from Epworth to Hatfield Moors was long.

==Motive power==
During the construction of the two railways, three contractors locomotives worked on the Goole and Marshland Railway, and four on the Isle of Axholme Light Railway. All were built by the Manning Wardle company in Leeds. The first, named &quot;Margaret&quot;, was an 0-4-0 saddle tank with outside cylinders, while the remainder, built to four different designs, were 0-6-0 saddle tanks with inside cylinders. None were owned by the two railways, and five of them were auctioned at a sale of contractors&#x27; plant held at Crowle Wharf in October 1904.

Once the contractors&#x27; locomotives ceased working on the line, locomotives were supplied from Goole shed, and were usually Barton Wright 0-6-2 side tanks or Barton Wright 0-6-0 goods engines with tenders. The locomotives took their name from William Barton Wright, who was the chief mechanical engineer for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway at the time they were introduced. They were designed and built by Kitson and Company in Leeds. Although classified as goods engines, the 0-6-0 locomotives were employed on both goods and passenger services. They continued to work on the line until the early 1960s. Most of the 0-6-2s had been withdrawn by 1914, and their duties were performed by Aspinall 2-4-2 side tanks.

In 1907, the company looked at using petrol-electric autocars for the passenger services, but were advised that they would not be economic, as conventional trains would still be required on Wednesdays and Saturdays to cope with the volume of traffic. However, in July 1926 they conducted trials with a Sentinel-Cammell steam railcar, which was borrowed from the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), who had absorbed the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, bought 13 steam railcars in 1926 and 1927, one of which was allocated to Goole shed for work on the Axholme Joint Railway. A similar vehicle was ordered in February 1930 specifically for the railway, and entered service in December. The steam power unit was built by the Sentinel Waggon Works in Shrewsbury, and the bodywork was built at Nottingham, at the former works of Cammell Laird, by then part of the Metropolitan-Cammell Carriage, Wagon and Finance Company. Before passenger services were withdrawn in 1933, it ran , working two return trips from Goole to Haxey Junction on weekdays, three on Wednesdays, and five on Saturdays. It was then sold to the and continued in use until 1944.

From 1947, Ivatt 2-6-0 lightweight tender locomotives were allocated to Goole shed, and were soon operating on the Axholme Joint Railway. The last two Barton Wright 0-6-0 locomotives left Goole shed in December 1950 for Wakefield and all of the seven Ivatt locomotives are thought to have worked on the line. They were popular with the crews, as the tender was fitted with a back sheet for the cab, and was low enough to provide good visibility when running tender-first across the moors on the return journey to Goole. In 1957 they were briefly replaced by four elderly J10 0-6-0 tender engines, transferred from Liverpool, but all were withdrawn in 1958. Small diesel shunters were allocated to Goole shed in 1960, for use in the docks, but were also used on the Axholme Joint Railway. Only one of the Ivatt 2-6-0 locomotives was left at Goole by mid-1962.

Although there were no passenger services after 1933, occasional rail tours ran along the line. The last passenger train was a 4-car diesel multiple unit, hired by the North Axholme Secondary School at Crowle on 1 April 1965. It left Goole at 11:30 am, carrying 184 pupils, members of staff, invited guests and the press. Passing through Reedness Junction, the train ran to Fockerby, where it was met by pupils from Garthorpe Primary School. It then returned to Reedness, and followed the route through Crowle to Epworth, by then the terminus. It returned to Ealand siding, where some of the passengers left the train, and the rest detrained at Crowle. The average speed for the journey was .

<text>Sharon Robinson (born in 1958 in San Francisco) is an American singer, keyboardist, songwriter, and record producer. She is best known for frequent writing and collaborating with Leonard Cohen, although she has written songs for a number of other artists including The Pointer Sisters, Aaron Neville, Brenda Russell, Diana Ross, Don Henley, Michael Bolton, Randy Crawford, Patti LaBelle, Roberta Flack, The Temptations, Bettye LaVette, and others.

== Career ==
Robinson first recorded an album on Baby Grand in 1977. Allegedly because of the tax shelter issues with the label, she was reluctant to use her own name, hence the outfit / project was named Terea (a name she had used in the past and it is believed to be her middle name). On the untitled album she is backed by members of Street Feet (who also released an album on Baby Grand in 1977).

Robinson toured as a back-up singer for Cohen in 1979 and 1980, and then again during 2008–2013. They collaborated on writing the songs &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; and &quot;Waiting for the Miracle&quot;, released in 1988 and 1992 respectively. In 2001, she co-wrote, produced, arranged, and performed the backing tracks (as well as appearing alongside Cohen on the cover) for his album &quot;Ten New Songs&quot;. Robinson contributed to three tracks on Cohen&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;Dear Heather&quot;, and dueted with Cohen on &quot;The Letters&quot;.

She was given a Grammy Award in 1985 for the song &quot;New Attitude&quot; (from the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; soundtrack) which was recorded by Patti LaBelle. In 2004, Robinson was interviewed about her life, career, and work with Leonard Cohen.

In 2005, Robinson wrote the song &quot;The High Road&quot; specifically for Bettye LaVette for her album &quot;I&#x27;ve Got My Own Hell to Raise&quot;, which was #59 on Amazon&#x27;s best of 2005 Editor&#x27;s picks. Robinson&#x27;s recent work includes songs written for Chris Botti.
In 2008, Robinson released her debut solo album &quot;Everybody Knows&quot;, which includes three songs she co-wrote with Cohen: &quot;Alexandra Leaving&quot;, &quot;Everybody Knows&quot;, and &quot;Summertime&quot;, their first collaboration, originally recorded by Diana Ross for her 1987 album &quot;Red Hot Rhythm &amp; Blues&quot;. The set includes &quot;The High Road&quot;, and six new tracks written by Robinson. On October 27, 2008, Vibrant Records released &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; in the United Kingdom and Europe, replacing the original artwork from Leonard Cohen with a photo of Robinson. In February 2009, Vibrant Records closed due to the bankruptcy of its distributor Pinnacle. In April 2009, UK label Freeworld Records re-released &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; in Europe with the original Leonard Cohen-drawn cover art. Robinson self-released the album in the U.S.

In 2008 Robinson joined The Leonard Cohen World Tour which lasted until December 2013. In August 2013 she was profiled in a cover story in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. A book of her photographs was released in December 2014 along with exhibits in New York and Los Angeles, and performances in those cities and Toronto. She appeared on Cohen&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Old Ideas&quot; singing, arranging choirs, and playing synth bass on four tracks. She performed songs from both her albums and also songs she co-wrote with Cohen on a tour in March and April 2015, coinciding with the release of her second solo album, entitled &quot;Caffeine&quot; performing in Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, France, Ireland, Scotland, and England. &quot;Caffeine&quot; included 10 new tracks written and produced by Robinson herself, with one song, &quot;Lucky&quot;, co-written with Cohen in the 1980s but not recorded.

In 2015, Robinson released a four-track EP titled &quot;Sharon Robinson EP 1&quot;, covering songs by Tom Waits, Otis Redding, Bruce Hornsby, and Eric Clapton. After her second 2015 tour was postponed, she toured in Europe again in August and September 2016. In August 2016, she was the guest of honor at the 10th Leonard Cohen Event, held in Amsterdam.

<text>Everything and More: A Compact History of Infinity is a book by American novelist and essayist David Foster Wallace that examines the history of infinity, focusing primarily on the work of Georg Cantor, the 19th-century German mathematician who created set theory. The book is part of the W. W. Norton &quot;Great Discoveries&quot; series.

Neal Stephenson provided an &quot;Introduction&quot; to a reissued paperback edition (2010), which Stephenson reprinted in his collection &quot;Some Remarks: Essays and Other Writing&quot;.

Reviewers, including Rudy Rucker, A.W. Moore and Michael Harris, have criticized its style and mathematical content.
