<text>Michael Edward Shanahan ( ; born August 24, 1952) is an American football coach, best known as the head coach of the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL) from 1995 to 2008. During his fourteen seasons with the Broncos, he led the team to two consecutive Super Bowl victories in XXXII and XXXIII; along with being the first Super Bowl championships in team history, they were the seventh team to win consecutive Super Bowls in NFL history. His head coaching career spanned a total of twenty seasons and also included stints with the Los Angeles Raiders and Washington Redskins. He is the father of San Francisco 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan.

==Early career==
Shanahan played high school football at East Leyden High School, Franklin Park, Illinois, where he played wishbone quarterback for coach Jack Leese&#x27;s 1968 and 1969 Eagles teams. Shanahan held the single-game rushing record of 260 yards on 15 carries (which was set in a 32–8 win over Hinsdale South on September 20, 1969) until it was broken in 1976 by Dennis Cascio but is now held by Angel Maldonado with 312 yards on 25 carries in 2009. He graduated from high school in 1970.

He was a quarterback at Eastern Illinois University, where he joined Delta Sigma Phi Fraternity. In 1972, a piercingly hard hit on the practice field ruptured one of his kidneys, which caused his heart to stop for thirty seconds and nearly killed him. A priest was summoned to administer the last rites to Shanahan, a devout Roman Catholic.

==College coaching==
In 1975 and 1976, Shanahan was a graduate assistant on Barry Switzer&#x27;s staff at the University of Oklahoma. In 1977, he became the offensive backfield coach at Northern Arizona University. NAU went 9–2 and played in the NCAA Division II Football Championship playoffs. He left after one season to return to his alma mater as offensive coordinator. He helped Eastern Illinois win the Division II football championship. Shanahan then worked as the offensive coordinator for the University of Minnesota for a single season, before accepting the same position at the University of Florida under head coach Charley Pell in 1980. Shanahan stayed with the Gators through 1983.

==NFL career==
===Assistant coaching stints===
Shanahan first served as a receivers coach and later offensive coordinator for the Denver Broncos under Dan Reeves from 1984 to 1987. This firmly places Mike Shanahan on the Tom Landry tree of coaching, as Dan Reeves was one of Landry&#x27;s greatest disciples. It was his skill as an offensive mind that garnered Shanahan the attention of maverick Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis. After Shanahan and the Raiders parted ways four games into the 1989 season, Shanahan returned to the Broncos as quarterbacks coach on October 16, 1989. He was fired a couple years later by Reeves after finding himself in the middle of a growing feud between Reeves and quarterback John Elway.

===Los Angeles Raiders===
Shanahan was hired by the Los Angeles Raiders in 1988 to replace longtime Raiders coach Tom Flores. He was the Raiders&#x27; first head coach hired from outside the organization since Davis himself 23 years earlier. Shanahan (who proved very unpopular with the players) and the micromanaging Davis clashed almost immediately, and this was only exacerbated after the Raiders finished a disappointing 7–9, losing four of their last five games. Tensions increased towards the end of the season when wide receivers coach and Shanahan loyalist Nick Nicolau got into a heated argument with assistant coach Art Shell (a Davis loyalist) in which Nicolau reportedly accused Shell of having a job only by virtue of his friendship with Davis. When Shell went to Davis later to ask if this was true, Davis&#x27; response was to immediately fire Nicolau. Shanahan responded by firing running backs coach Joe Scannella and offensive coordinator Tom Walsh (both Davis hires), but Davis ordered them both back to work. At the end of the season, Shanahan fired defensive assistants Willie Brown and Charlie Sumner. An enraged Davis re-hired Brown to a different position in the organization. When the Raiders began 1–3 in 1989, Shanahan himself was fired and replaced by Shell. Shanahan&#x27;s final Raiders record was 8–12 in less than two seasons, going 2–7 after a 6–5 start.

===San Francisco 49ers===
In 1992, Shanahan was hired as offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers under head coach George Seifert, capping his rise with a victory in Super Bowl XXIX after the 1994 season. His years under Seifert placed him in the Bill Walsh coaching tree. In 1994 while coaching for the 49ers, Shanahan added to the ongoing feud between him and Raiders owner Al Davis when he had then quarterback Elvis Grbac throw a football at Davis&#x27; head, which missed by a few inches as Davis was able to dodge it just in time; afterwards Davis responded with an obscene gesture.

===Denver Broncos===
Shanahan&#x27;s success with the 49ers earned him a head coaching spot once more, this time back in Denver with the Broncos beginning in 1995. He led the Broncos to back-to-back Super Bowl championships in the 1997 and 1998 seasons, during which time the Broncos set a then-record for victories in two seasons.

Between 1996 and 1998, the Broncos set the NFL record for victories by going 46–10 over a three-year span. The 1998 Broncos won their first 13 games on their way to a 14–2 mark. Shanahan, taking his cue from West Coast offense guru Bill Walsh, was well known for scripting the first 15 offensive plays of the game, and helped the 1998 Broncos set an NFL record for first quarter points scored in a season. In 2005, he passed Dan Reeves as the winningest coach in franchise history.

Shanahan is known for an offense featuring zone running plays and play-action passes. He has often found unheralded running backs from later rounds of the annual NFL Draft and then turned them into league-leading rushers behind small-but-powerful offensive lines. Examples of this phenomenon are Terrell Davis, Mike Anderson, Olandis Gary, Clinton Portis, Reuben Droughns and Tatum Bell, all of whom have had at least one 1,000-yard season in a Denver uniform during Shanahan&#x27;s tenure.

In 1999, with the assistance of writer Adam Schefter, Shanahan penned &quot;Think Like a Champion&quot;, a motivational book about leadership; it was published by HarperCollins. In 2006, he cooperated with Stefan Fatsis&#x27;s endeavor to spend a year as a Broncos place-kicker, and much of the resulting book &quot;A Few Seconds of Panic&quot; (2008) covers Shanahan&#x27;s coaching from the player&#x27;s point of view.

After Elway&#x27;s retirement and Davis&#x27; career-ending injuries, Shanahan went six years without a playoff win (including three seasons when the Broncos failed to qualify for the postseason), a drought which caused criticism from fans. The playoff drought ended during the 2005–06 postseason when the Broncos defeated the two-time defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots in the AFC Divisional Round of the playoffs at Invesco Field at Mile High. The victory, however, would be Shanahan&#x27;s last playoff win as a head coach.

Shanahan was fired after the 2008 NFL season following a collapse that caused the Broncos to miss the playoffs for a third consecutive year. Although the Broncos held an 8–5 record by Week 14 and would have won the AFC West with one more victory, the team lost their remaining three games and the 8–8 San Diego Chargers won the division on a tiebreaker.

===Washington Redskins===

In the early part of the 2009 season, it was reported that the Washington Redskins were interested in naming Shanahan their head coach, replacing Jim Zorn. Although this was reported by several media outlets, the Redskins&#x27; vice president of football operations, Vinny Cerrato, stated that a coaching change would not be considered until the end of the season. On November 18, 2009, ESPN&#x27;s Adam Schefter reported that the Buffalo Bills had contacted Shanahan about their head coaching vacancy after the team parted ways with former coach Dick Jauron.

On January 5, 2010, Shanahan was formally introduced as the Redskins&#x27; 24th full-time head coach. As part of the deal, he was also named vice president of football operations, with the final say on football matters. He was one of several coaches who also had the title or powers of general manager, along with New England&#x27;s Bill Belichick and others. Shanahan was signed to a five-year, $35 million contract. Several months earlier, Bruce Allen was named the team&#x27;s general manager. Shanahan and Allen split the duties held by a general manager, with Shanahan having the final say. This model is similar to how Belichick and Scott Pioli worked during their eight years in New England.

Shanahan&#x27;s son, Kyle Shanahan, became the offensive coordinator of the Washington Redskins on January 20, 2010.

Shanahan had a combined 11–21 record in his first two seasons as Redskins coach, followed by a 3–6 start to the 2012 season, but ended the year with a seven-game winning streak on the way to the team&#x27;s first NFC East title and home playoff game since the 1999 season. During this season Shanahan also continued his trend of developing unheralded draft picks into 1000-yard rushers, with the 6th-rounder Alfred Morris. The Redskins lost in the Wild Card round of the 2012 NFL Playoffs to the Seattle Seahawks by a score of 24–14, during which his quarterback Robert Griffin III sustained a tear of his LCL and a damaged ACL to his previously injured knee. Shanahan came under criticism for his handling of the injury, both in bringing Griffin back to play after the initial injury on December 9 and keeping him in the game against the Seahawks after reinjuring the knee. While there were reports in December 2012 that the Redskins were considering negotiating a contract extension with Shanahan in the 2013 offseason, this did not happen and there were later reports that Shanahan had considered resigning after the end of the year.

Griffin underwent reconstructive surgery of his knee on January 9 and returned as the starter for the beginning of the 2013 season, though Shanahan held him out of the preseason to protect him from further injury. The team continued to struggle in 2013. With the final three games of the regular season, Shanahan decided to make Griffin inactive for the rest of the season because Shanahan thought it was best for both Griffin&#x27;s and the Redskins&#x27; future.

Redskins owner Daniel Snyder fired Shanahan on December 30, 2013. The team finished 3–13 in the 2013 season, and was in last place in the NFC East division three of Shanahan&#x27;s four seasons.

===Potential return to coaching===
Shanahan has not held a coaching position since his dismissal from the Washington Redskins in 2013. In 2015, he was interviewed by the Buffalo Bills and Chicago Bears for their vacant head coaching spots, as well as the Oakland Raiders, whom he previously coached from 1988 to 1989, when the club was based in Los Angeles. Shanahan was also interviewed for the vacant head coaching spot by the San Francisco 49ers in 2015, whom Shanahan previously served as their offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach from 1992 to 1994 and was part of the 1994 team that won Super Bowl XXIX. Coincidentally, the 49ers would hire his son, Kyle Shanahan as their head coach 2 years later. In 2016, Shanahan was nearly hired as the head coach of the Miami Dolphins before they hired Chicago Bears offensive coordinator Adam Gase for the vacant spot on January 9, 2016. On August 17, 2019, it was revealed that the Denver Broncos, whom Shanahan previously coached from 1995 to 2008, nearly re-hired him as head coach in 2018 before their decision to retain Vance Joseph on January 1, 2018.

==Accomplishments==

*Posted the most wins in National Football League history during a three-year period at the time (46 in 1996–98).
*Won the most postseason games in history over a two-year period (seven, 1997–98).
*Been undefeated and untied for three consecutive regular seasons (1996–98) at home, just the second team ever to be undefeated and untied at home in three consecutive years. The Miami Dolphins posted three consecutive seasons of untied undefeated home records from 1972 to 1974. Including playoff games, the Dolphins had won 31 consecutive home games from 1971 to 1974. Oddly enough, in 1999 on the opening Monday Night Football game, the Dolphins ended the defending Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos streak with a 38–21 win in Denver.
*In 2004, he joined the exclusive club of head coaches to post 100 wins in his first 10 seasons with one club, finishing the campaign and decade tied for fourth on this list of 12 coaches, six of whom are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
*Joins Vince Lombardi, Don Shula, Chuck Noll, Jimmy Johnson, Bill Belichick, and Andy Reid as the only seven coaches to win back-to-back Super Bowls.
*He is the second coach in history to win two Super Bowl titles in his first four years coaching a team (Shula did it first with the Miami Dolphins in 1972 and 1973).
*Highest winning percentage in Denver history (.646) and most wins in Denver history (138).
*Shanahan is among twelve coaches in pro football history to post four wins in one postseason along with Tom Flores, Joe Gibbs, Brian Billick, Bill Cowher, Tony Dungy, Tom Coughlin (twice), Mike McCarthy, John Harbaugh, Bruce Arians, Sean McVay, and most recently, Andy Reid. 
*The all-time high of 636 points in a season came from the 1994 Super Bowl Champion San Francisco 49ers, for whom Shanahan was the offensive coordinator. This was eclipsed during the 2007 season when the New England Patriots scored 589 points in the regular season and 66 points in the postseason for a total of 655 points. Ironically, that record was again broken in the 2013–2014 season when Shanahan&#x27;s former team, the Denver Broncos, scored 606 points in the regular season and 58 in the postseason for a total of 664 points.
*During his NFL career, Shanahan has been a part of teams that have played in 10 Conference Championship Games, in addition to his five Super Bowl appearances, Super Bowl XXI, Super Bowl XXII, Super Bowl XXXII, and Super Bowl XXXIII with Denver and Super Bowl XXIX with San Francisco.

<text>Edward Corringham &quot;Mick&quot; Mannock (24 May 1887 – 26 July 1918) was a British-Irish flying ace who served in the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force during the First World War. Mannock was a pioneer of fighter aircraft tactics in aerial warfare. At the time of his death he had amassed 61 aerial victories, making him the fifth highest scoring pilot of the war. Mannock was among the most decorated men in the British Armed Forces. He was honoured with the Military Cross twice, was one of the rare three-time recipients of the Distinguished Service Order, and was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.

Mannock was born in 1887 to an English father, Edward Mannock, and an Irish mother, Julia Sullivan. Mannock&#x27;s father served in the British Army and the family moved to India when Mannock was a child. Young Mannock was sickly and developed several ailments in his formative years. Upon his return to England he became a fervent supporter of Irish nationalism and the Irish Home Rule movement but became a member of the Independent Labour Party.

In 1914, Mannock was working as a telephone engineer in Turkey. After the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s entry into the war on the side of the Central Powers he was interned. Mannock was badly treated and soon fell ill. Turkish authorities repatriated him to Britain believing him to be unfit for war service. Mannock recovered and joined the Royal Engineers and then Royal Army Medical Corps. He moved services again and in 1916 joined Royal Flying Corps (RFC). After completing his training he was assigned to No. 40 Squadron RFC. Mannock went into combat on the Western Front, participating in three separate combat tours. After a slow start he began to prove himself as an exceptional pilot, scoring his first victory on 7 May 1917.

By February 1918, Mannock had achieved 16 victories and was appointed a Flight Commander in No. 74 Squadron. He amassed 36 more victories from 12 April—17 June 1918. After returning from leave Mannock was appointed commanding officer of No. 85 Squadron in July 1918, and scored nine more victories that month. Days after warning fellow ace George McElroy about the hazards of flying low into ground fire, that fate befell Mannock and he was killed in action dogfighting too close to the ground on 26 July 1918.

==Early life and education==

Edward Mannock was born on 24 May 1887 to Julia (née Sullivan) and Edward Mannock, of English, Irish and Scottish descent (married on 4 February 1883). Edward was the youngest of three; sister Jessie (b. December 1882) and Patrick (b. March 1886). Edward senior was from a wealthy family. His father was a newspaper editor on Fleet Street and his uncle George Mannock was a friend of the British Royal Family. 

According to family legend, George had taught the Prince of Wales to play billiards. Edward senior was a Corporal in the British Army and distinguished himself in the Anglo-Egyptian War at the Battle of Tel el-Kebir in 1882. The Mannocks moved to Cork, Ireland in 1887 after his father left the army, and where it has been argued Mannock was born; though this is disputed and conflicting sources give his birth place as Ballincollig in Ireland or Brighton (Preston Barracks) in England. 

In 1893, deeply in debt and exasperated with civilian life, Edward senior re-enlisted and the family moved to Meerut, India in May when Edward junior was five. Soon after arriving in Asia, Edward contracted malaria, narrowly avoiding death.

The young Mannock was a keen sports fan and he enjoyed cricket and football. Unlike some of his contemporaries he despised game hunting, and he kept birds and rabbits. As he grew older he became a keen angler. Mannock did enjoy shooting and used an air gun in target-shooting and he was also a passionate violin player, and was skilled with a variety of other instruments. When the Boer War began Mannock&#x27;s father was transferred to South Africa where he fought in the 5th Dragoon Guards while the family stayed in India. When the war was over his father sent for the family and they moved to Canterbury in England. Mannock&#x27;s father was a drunkard and suffered from depression. Two months after settling in England, he abandoned his wife and children and took the family&#x27;s paltry savings with him.

Edward attended the local school, St. Thomas&#x27;, and helped support the family with menial jobs. After leaving he was pressured by his mother into joining his brother at the National Telephone Company. After three years his health was affected by the stuffy office conditions and he applied, and was granted, a transfer to the engineering department. Mannock moved to Wellingborough, Northamptonshire in 1911 to take his position. 

Mannock joined the Territorial Army and served in the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) at this time to keep in touch with his friends from Canterbury at the annual camps. Mannock was promoted to sergeant in 1913. In the spring, he attended a local cricket match and was introduced to Clara Novello Davies, mother of composer Ivor Novello. Mannock was keen to develop his musical talents and was personally tutored by her. Through his local cricket club assumed an interest in politics. He became a political activist, expressed socialist views, was an admirer of Keir Hardie and became the Secretary of the Wellingborough Independent Labour Party in 1912. 

Mannock remained a staunch supporter of the British Empire but sympathised with the Irish Home Rule movement. In the Wellingborough YMCA&#x27;s mock parliament he sat as the Honourable Member for Waterford, the seat of John Redmond leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party.

Mannock applied for a passport at Christmas 1913, and received a stamped copy on 10 January 1914 describing himself as a telegraph and telephone mechanic. The original survives at the RAF Museum in Hendon. On 9 February 1914, he abruptly ended his time in Wellingborough, and boarded a tramp steamer from Tilbury to Constantinople in Turkey to take a position at the &quot;Société Ottomane des Téléphones&quot; (Ottoman Telephone Exchange).

In 1914, as war became likely, Mannock and his fellow employees noticed a change in the political climate, and their Turkish hosts became openly hostile and anti-British. At the outbreak of war in Europe in August 1914, the country remained neutral. In October 1914 the Turks allied themselves with the Central Powers, the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. As an enemy subject he was interned.

Poorly fed and cared for, his health rapidly declined in prison. Dysentery racked his intestines and he was confined to a small cell. One night he managed to escape his cell by squeezing through the narrow confines of its window. Over the next nights, and during his transfer to the prisoners quarters, he forged an exit tunnel which he used on frequent raids to the Turkish Army food stores next-door. One night he was discovered and locked in a concrete box for two weeks. Near death, he was repatriated back to Britain and left Constantinople camp on 1 April 1915. On the two-month journey he contracted malaria once again, surviving the parasite before reaching England via Bulgaria and Greece.

==War service==
===Royal Engineers and Royal Army Medical Corps===
On 22 May 1915 Mannock reported for duty with the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) and by July he was sufficiently recovered to join them at his pre-war rank of sergeant. On 25 May he was assigned to the 3rd company, second battalion Home Countries Field Ambulance Service. Upon joining, he found that he had to attend German wounded as well as British and French; something which he found distasteful. 

Mannock immediately detected apathy in his old service. In his opinion the men lacked enthusiasm for the job of winning the war. He complained bitterly at their half-hearted efforts during practice drills. While there, Mannock attempted to start a branch of the Wellingborough Parliament to instil some patriotism, pride and professionalism but failed. While tending to some wounded soldiers, Mannock sought an audience with his commanding officer. He refused to continue driving ambulances or tending the sick while thousands died in battle and requested a transfer to the Royal Engineers (RE) as an officer cadet. Mannock waited for months and his rank rose from sergeant to sergeant-major. Finally, in March 1916 he was finally granted his transfer after an interview at the local recruitment office in Fenny Stratford.

Mannock was conscious his poor education and lower-class background would put him at a considerable disadvantage in the well-educated and higher-class surroundings of the RE. Mannock&#x27;s solution to his problem was to throw himself into his work. The method was practical but his insular behaviour was construed as odd. Mannock despised his peers who were uninterested in the war and seemed concerned only with the uniforms, quality tailoring and how it would improve their chances with women. Tired of the banal conversations and lethargy of his comrades, Mannock wanted to leave the RE but realised a second resignation would damage his chances of becoming a commissioned officer.

At the suggestion of a friend – Eric Tomkins – Mannock decided to join the Royal Flying Corps (RFC). Mannock was initially reticent, concerned his age and physical condition would hinder him. His early departure from two other services may also have encouraged questions about his reliability. Mannock acquired all the newspapers he could for information on the air war. In so doing, he came across an article on the man who was to have a profound effect on him: Albert Ball. Ball was the first fighter pilot to be given any publicity and his exploits inspired Mannock to transfer. In June Mannock was promoted to second lieutenant and on 14 August 1916 he arrived at the No. 1 School of Military Aeronautics in Reading.

===Royal Flying Corps===
Mannock&#x27;s training began immediately. He received instruction on aerial gunnery, aircraft-rigging, map reading and flight theory. He passed with honours and was sent to Hendon for elementary flying instruction. On 28 November 1916 he received Royal Aero Club (RAeC) certificate 3895. On 5 December he moved to Hounslow to begin training with No. 19 Training Squadron flying the Henry Farman. After completing his course he was moved to the Hythe School of Gunnery on 1 February 1917 for two weeks and then to No. 10 Reserve Squadron at Joyce Green for advanced training. Mannock&#x27;s instructor, Captain Chapman said of him, &quot; he made his first solo flight with but a few hours&#x27; instruction, for he seemed to master the rudiments of flying with his first hour in the air and from then on threw the machine about as he pleased&quot;.

At Joyce Green Mannock met Captain James McCudden. McCudden taught Mannock about air fighting. McCudden stressed team tactics and offensive use of the aeroplane. McCudden said of Mannock, &quot;The pupils here during the period of which I write were very good. One I particularly remember was named Mannock. Mannock was a typical example of the impetuous young Irishman, and I always thought he was of the type to do or die&quot;. 

Meredith Thomas also met Mannock at Joyce Green in February 1917. Thomas recalled how they were told not to turn below 2,000 feet in an Airco DH.2 pusher. Mannock did so and got into a spin at , deliberately. He was keen to see if he could recover the aircraft from such an attitude. Mannock stalled the aircraft, purposely, and followed McCudden&#x27;s advice; allow it to come out of the stall and centralise the controls, apply opposite rudder in the spin and as the spin slows ease the nose down. Mannock had discovered that air combat was a science and could be perfected. Regardless, his actions earned him a rebuke from his commanding officer, Keith Caldwell.

Mannock was somewhat older than his peers in the RFC and had experienced the brutality of war first-hand. Meredith Thomas remembered this earned him a reputation as a serious-minded man. Mannock was inclined to be reserved, but was a good conversationalist, patient and willing to assist others but quick to anger. He masked his hatred of the Turks but the intensity with which he carried out his training was sometimes misunderstood.

===First combats===
Confident in his skill, Mannock arrived in France on 31 March 1917 at 40 Squadron headquarters near Aire, Lens. He did not give his new squadron-mates a good first impression. On his first night he inadvertently sat down in the chair of a popular pilot killed that day and proceeded to ask pilots about their personal scores and offer, without invitation, his own views on air combat. Lieutenant Lionel Blaxland recalled; &quot;He seemed a boorish know-all, we all felt the quicker he got amongst the Huns the better; that would show him how little he knew&quot;. Mannock flew the squadron&#x27;s Nieuport 17 scout the following day. As the days passed, he preferred to remain airborne by virtue of his squadron&#x27;s hostility. The public school boy-dominated squadron detested his &quot;gutter politics&quot; and mannerisms although Mannock was befriended by Irishman Lieutenant de Burgh, of the same ilk. Mannock forged friendships with new pilots. George McElroy arrived in September and became Mannock&#x27;s protégé.

Mannock had initially to overcome his fear of combat. On 13 April he crossed into no mans land for the first time during the opening days of the Arras offensive and was subjected to German anti-aircraft artillery for the first time. He mishandled his aircraft and dropped out of formation. Subsequent patrols did not abate his fear. A man who performed in such a manner was suspect and he was shunned in the mess. On 19 April 1917, and in view of the entire squadron, Mannock finally won some respect when he landed his aircraft during a firing practice after the lower right wing tore away. Mannock forced himself into the air again and continued to practice. Eventually he adopted the tactic of closing to within 20 or 30 yards to open fire.

On 1 May 1917 40 Squadron escorted four Sopwith 1½ Strutters to the German airfield at Douai—the home of &quot;Jagdstaffel 11&quot; (&quot;Jasta&quot; 11) commanded by Manfred von Richthofen the famed &quot;Red Baron&quot;. In the fight he evaded enemy aircraft but could not claim a success. Finally, on 7 May 1917—incidentally the day his inspiration Albert Ball died—he shot down an observation balloon, a respected achievement since the aircraft was heavily defended. 40 Squadron lost a pilot, Captain William Nixon, a flight commander aged 19 from Derbyshire, to five intercepting Albatros D.IIIs led by Lothar von Richthofen, the former&#x27;s brother. Despite his growing experience Mannock remained outside the circle of friends in the squadron because of his apparent and initial lack of effort and success. He withdrew from their company and concentrated on improving. Alone, his nervousness disappeared and he made friends and acquaintances, but mostly outside the squadron.

On 7 June he shot down an Albatros D.III for his second victory and on 9 June claimed a reconnaissance aircraft and an Albatros D.V but did not receive credit. On 14 June he was sent home on leave owing to exhaustion and spent two weeks in England. On 12 and 13 July he received credits for a DFW C.V taking his total to four. On the later date he claimed a third DFW but was denied official recognition for lack of witnesses. Mannock went to view his third victory which had fallen in friendly lines. The observer had survived but the pilot was dead. He forced himself to search the wreck and discovered the remains. The sight of a little black terrier mascot—dead in the observer&#x27;s seat—upset Mannock for days. He wrote in his diary, &quot;I felt exactly like a murderer.&quot;

On 19 July Mannock was awarded the Military Cross (MC), which was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 17 September when the citation included successes he achieved in the intervening period. He received the personal congratulations of the AOC (Air Officer Commanding) Hugh Trenchard upon receiving his award at Béthune.

On 28 July Mannock reported an Albatros D.V and two balloons shot down but these also went uncredited. On that day Mannock engaged a purple Albatross DV and claimed hits on the enemy leader. This may well have been &quot;Jagdstaffel&quot; 12 commanding officer Adolf Ritter von Tutschek. Joachim von Bertrab was taken prisoner of war on 12 August when forced down behind British lines for Mannock&#x27;s 6th victory. Bertrab&#x27;s fighter caught fire but his close proximity to the ground (1,000 ft) enabled him to make a controlled landing and escape the fire with a fractured left arm and wounds to the right arm and leg. Mannock also made two further uncredited claims in his combat report but they were not even marked as uncredited in official sources. An RFC communiqué announced he been credited with only one victory this day.

During the Third Ypres campaign Mannock increased in piloting stature. In August he shot down five Albatros D.V and a DFW C.V plus one uncredited Albatros. His tally had reached nine victories and had passed the threshold of five required to become a fighter ace. In September he shot down six more enemy aircraft including a Rumpler C.I or Rumpler C.III and five DFW D.Vs raising his tally to 15. All of these enemies were felled in a Nieuport 23.

Mannock made only one claim on 25 September, his last for 1917. The combat report for that day describes an incident in which he fired on an enemy reconnaissance aircraft at 16,000 ft but ran out of ammunition. The machine&#x27;s propeller stopped but it glided eastward. Another was fired on this day and dived toward German lines apparently damaged. Mannock made no claim for these combats. Biographer Norman Franks suggests his total may have been slightly higher than official figure of 61.

Mannock&#x27;s practice sessions had paid off. After one victory, he wrote, &quot;My man gave me an easy mark. I was only ten yards away from him—on top so I couldn&#x27;t miss! A beautifully coloured insect he was—red, blue, green, yellow. I let him have 60 rounds at that range, so there wasn&#x27;t much left of him&quot;.

===No. 74 Squadron===
In early October 1917, Mannock returned to England on leave as the battle at Ypres descended into stalemate. While on leave on 18 October 1917 he was awarded the bar to the Military Cross. As a consequence of his vacation he missed the Battle of Cambrai which began on 20 November 1917. Mannock was, however, present for other developments. On 23 November the squadron began to convert to the S.E.5. Piloting his personal mount, &quot;B4884&quot;, he damaged the fighter when force landing after engine trouble at Dainville. Mannock&#x27;s morale seemed high. He wrote to his sister on 21 November after returning to France, &quot;Hope all is well in Birmingham. Plenty of work for the airmen and plenty of casualties. Am doing special air work by myself now. A big feather in my cap. Am expecting the D.S.O soon, but may get a white cross instead. Who cares anyway. PS, I have got 16 Huns down to date&quot;.

The S.E.5 carried two guns. A .303 calibre Lewis gun was mounted on the top wing, positioned to fire outside the propeller arc. The weapon was drum-fed and could be pulled down to replenish the magazine. It could also be adjusted, in flight, to fire vertically at an enemy that was positioned above. The other was a belt–fed Vickers machine gun, also of .303 calibre which was mounted on top of the fuselage over the engine and its cowling. The weapon&#x27;s fire could pass through the propeller arc by virtue of interrupter gear. The 200 horse power Hispano-Suiza 8 engine was troublesome but the machine could reach 118 mph at 10,000 ft in level flight. Mannock&#x27;s first success in the S.E.5 nearly came on 9 December but the enemy Albatros escaped when his guns jammed. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1918 Mannock scored his first victory in the S.E.5—it was his 16th and last with 40 Squadron. The crew were killed when the Hannover CL.III crashed. When he landed, Mannock was promptly dispatched back to England the following day.

Before departing France, Mannock met with McElroy, Jones and McCudden and they took a car to Boulogne. Mannock&#x27;s reputation had spread well beyond the confines of his squadron and mechanics, junior officers and comrades lined the road to form an honour guard as he drove away. In Boulogne Mannock stopped at a hospital to bid farewell to an Irish nurse called Murphy; whether the two were involved in a relationship is unknown. In January Mannock toured England, visiting London, Birmingham, and Northampton to rest with family.

Mannock visited Biggin Hill, an aerodrome situated on high ground near Croydon. At the time this was used for carrying out wireless experiments under Major H T B Childs. It is not known if Mannock participated in these tests. Save for one Sopwith Pup, the aerodrome had no aircraft for some time until 141 Squadron took residence with Bristol F.2 Fighters to protect against Zeppelin and Gotha G.V air raids. The squadron arrival coincided with Mannock&#x27;s posting to 74 Squadron at London Colney. The formation was formed in July 1917 at Northolt as a Training Depot Squadron (TDS) and then Training Squadron (TS). It was seen fit to promote the unit to combat operations and give Mannock a position of senior flight commander in February 1918.

In March 1918 74 was sent to France equipped with S.E.5s at a time when most RFC squadrons operated Sopwith Camels. Mannock respected the S.E.5 but preferred to have both of the machine guns firing through the propeller arc and situated in front of the pilot on the engine cowling. Some squadrons, including 85—whom Mannock commanded later—were scheduled to be equipped with the Sopwith Dolphin but losses compelled operating squadrons to maintain the old Camels for ease of replacement. Commanding officer of 74 Squadron, Keith Caldwell, appointed Mannock as a senior flight commander. Mannock immediately began training the inexperienced squadron combat patrol tactics. Mannock&#x27;s well known phrase became the squadron&#x27;s mantra: &quot;Gentlemen, always above; seldom on the same level; never underneath&quot;.

On 27 March, one week after the beginning of the German spring offensive, Operation Michael, the squadron was ordered to Goldhanger, Essex and put on standby. On 30 March Mannock was ordered to Saint-Omer-en-Chaussée. On 1 April 1918—the day the Royal Air Force (RAF) came into being—it was moved to Teteghem near Dunkirk. A week later they transferred to La Lovie, west of Ypres. On 11 April the unit flew to Clairmarias east of Saint Omer. Twenty-four hours later, Mannock downed two Albatros D.Vs for his 17th and 18th victories. It was possible that &quot;Jasta&quot; 29 were 74&#x27;s opponents. Losses are difficult to determine as German sources recorded losses only in personnel, not aircraft. On this day six were killed, one captured and two wounded. &quot;Vizfeldwebel&quot; Gilbert Wagner was killed on 12 April in the vicinity of the battle.

Under his command A Flight scored many successes. Among the growing list of aces were Henry Eric Dolan and George McElroy. Mannock&#x27;s own score increased to 20 by the end of the month. On 23 and 29 April he downed a Pfalz D.III and Fokker D.VI. &quot;Leutnant&quot; Ludwig Vortmann of &quot;Jasta&quot; 2 became Mannock&#x27;s 20th victory.

Mannock was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 9 May 1918. The recommendation for the DSO was not signed by the King until two months after Mannock&#x27;s death. This month Mannock nearly doubled his tally from 21 to 41. On 12 May he accounted for a trio of fighters—two Albatros D.Vs and a Pfalz D.III but the squadron lost Henry Eric Dolan. Mannock lamented his loss. Mannock again achieved two victories on 17 May. On 21 May in dogfights around Ypres he downed four enemies including three Pfalz D.IIIs; one in the morning patrol and three in the evening patrol within the space of five minutes. Two more confirmed victories on 26 and 29 May brought his tally to 41. On the later date Mannock received the Bar to his DSO.

===Commanding No. 85 Squadron===
74 Squadron had begun to make a name for itself in 1917. It boasted several aces; commanding officer Keith Caldwell, Andrew Kiddie, Benjamin Roxburgh-Smith and James Ira Thomas Jones were some of the squadron&#x27;s highest achievers.

On 1 June 1918, east of Merville, 74 Squadron engaged &quot;Jasta&quot; 7 and &quot;Jasta&quot; 52, led by Paul Billik. Billik shot down and killed William Cairnes, who became the German ace&#x27;s 19th victory. Cairnes had reached the threshold of five victories only two days earlier on 30 May. Incidentally, Billik had also accounted for Mannock&#x27;s old squadron commander, Major L. A Tilney, on 9 March. Mannock attacked with his flight from above and in front of the German squadrons and downed three Pfalz D.III in the air battle.

Over the next eight days Mannock achieved double victories on 6, 9 and 16 June. He noted the position as &quot;28 J 30 C 3 5&quot;. On the evening of 6 June Mannock wrote home to his family that he now had 51 victories. (Mannock acknowledged in his letter that only 47 of his claims were officially recognised.) On 16 June 1918 he surpassed the 50–mark and ended the day of operations on 51 recognized aerial victories. At this time Mannock was the highest scoring pilot from the British Isles still on active operations, since the departure of James McCudden in February. As of this date, only McCudden and Manfred von Richthofen had shot down more aircraft than Mannock. The following morning Mannock accounted for another enemy aircraft on an offensive patrol. The German reconnaissance machine was Mannock&#x27;s 52nd and final victory with 74 Squadron.

On 18 June 1918 Mannock was sent to England on leave. He travelled to Birmingham to visit his mother. The visit was not an easy one as she had become an alcoholic. On this visit family friends reported on his state of mind. Mannock broke down on one occasion and seemed full of nervous tension. This was possibly due to combat fatigue. Major Caldwell noted Mannock never took time off unless it was officially scheduled leave and he never reported sick, but saw no signs that Mannock was about to crack-up. Mannock also did not want a command and preferred to remain on operations with 74 Squadron. As a senior flight commander Mannock never showed weakness in front of his men.

Mannock took command of No. 85 Squadron RAF on 5 July 1918. The morale of the unit was different to that of 74 Squadron. The former commanding officer, Billy Bishop, did not develop into a patrol leader, nor had he encouraged that method of command that was now expected. The squadron boasted several fighter aces: Alec Cunningham-Reid, Spencer B. Horn, Malcolm C. McGregor and Walter H. Longton. Mannock had a cadre of experienced pilots to build his leadership around.

Mannock scored his first enemy aircraft with 85 Squadron on 7 July when he downed two Fokker D.VII fighters in the same fight for his 53rd and 54th victories. Two days later he learned that McCudden had been killed in an accident which was a bitter blow to Mannock. On 14 July Mannock scored his 55th victory and claimed another on 19 July. On the late morning of 20 July 1918 Mannock accounted for a reconnaissance aircraft and two Fokker D.VII fighters in the same battle. A Fokker Dr.I on 22 July took Mannock&#x27;s personal tally to 60.

On 20 July, at a farewell luncheon for his friend &quot;Noisy&quot; Lewis, Mannock took their mutual friend George McElroy aside to counsel him on the hazards of following a German victim down within range of ground fire.

==Death==
On 26 July, Major Mannock offered to help a new arrival, Lt. Donald C. Inglis from New Zealand, obtain his first victory. After shooting down an enemy LVG two-seater behind the German front-line, Mannock is believed to have dived to the crash site to view the wreckage, seemingly breaking one of the unwritten rules of fellow pilots. In consequence, while crossing the trenches the fighters were met with a massive volley of ground-fire. The engine of Mannock&#x27;s aircraft was hit and immediately caught fire, and shortly thereafter the plane crashed behind German lines. Mannock&#x27;s body is believed to have been found, though this is unproven, about 250 yards (250m) from the wreck of his machine, perhaps thrown, perhaps jumped. The body showed no gunshot wounds, and Mannock had vowed to shoot himself if shot down in flames. The BBC &quot;Timewatch&quot; programme &quot;WW1 Aces Falling&quot; details the search to prove whether or not that this body was that of Mannock. Inglis described what happened:

==Memorials and tributes==
The exact cause of Mannock&#x27;s death remains uncertain. A year later, after intensive lobbying by Ira Jones and many of Mannock&#x27;s former comrades, he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

Mannock&#x27;s body was not subsequently recovered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), so officially he has no known grave. His name is commemorated on the Royal Flying Corps Memorial to the Missing at the Faubourg d&#x27;Amiens CWGC Cemetery in Arras. There is also a memorial plaque in honour of Mannock in Canterbury Cathedral.

Mick Mannock&#x27;s name is listed on the Wellingborough War Memorial with the other fallen men from the town and the local Air Training Corps unit bears his name – 378 (Mannock) Squadron. Additionally, a residential street in Wellingborough is named after Major Mannock: Mannock Road.

On 24 June 1988 a plaque was unveiled at 183 Mill Road, Wellingborough by top scoring World War II British fighter pilot Air Vice-Marshal Johnnie Johnson. Mannock had lived at that address prior to the War after being befriended by the Eyles family.

Between November 1968 and January 2001, Vickers VC10 C1K serial &quot;XV103&quot; was named &#x27;Edward Mannock VC&#x27; in commemoration of Mannock. This scroll was transferred to VC10 K3 &quot;ZA149&quot; after 2001, and to &quot;ZA147&quot; in March 2013 upon the retirement of &quot;XV103&quot; and &quot;ZA149&quot; respectively. &quot;ZA147&quot; was retired in September 2013.

In 2009, one of the last photographs ever taken of Mannock was discovered in Northern France. The photograph was found in an old album belonging to a French farmer whose land had been used by the Royal Air Force during the summer of 1918. The photograph shows Mannock in RAF uniform. He is standing on a farm track holding a walking stick and gloves with his right hand. His left hand rests on the shoulder of a dark-haired young French girl.

In a BBC &quot;Timewatch&quot; programme entitled &quot;WWI Aces Falling&quot;, broadcast on 21 March 2009, researchers suggested that the unidentified remains of a British airman recovered soon after the war from a temporary grave near Mannock&#x27;s crash site and reburied in Plot III, Row F, Grave #12 of Laventie CWGC war cemetery, could be those of Mick Mannock.

A pencil drawing, reputed to be of Mannock, was discovered rolled and hidden in a wing by a team restoring a First World War-era aircraft on behalf of Peter Jackson.

==List of air victories==

Mannock is officially credited with 61 victories: 1 balloon destroyed, 3 (and 2 shared) captured, 30 (and 5 shared) destroyed, 17 (and 3 shared) &quot;out of control&quot; in an itemised list of his approved claims (as seen below).

There was a posthumous attempt by former 74 Squadron comrade and fellow ace Ira Jones to credit his old friend with 73 victories and therefore the top scoring British Empire ace. However research suggests that assertion was faulty. Some of the 73 accredited by Jones to Mannock and published in full by James Dudgeon in 1981, appear duplicated in error, misdated, shared claims, or unconfirmed claims.

Confirmed victories are numbered; unconfirmed victories are denoted by &quot;u/c&quot;.

Mannock&#x27;s Victoria Cross was presented to his father at Buckingham Palace in July 1919. Edward Mannock was also given his son&#x27;s other medals, even though Mick had stipulated in his will that his father should receive nothing from his estate. Soon afterwards, Mannock&#x27;s medals were sold for £5. They have since been recovered and are now owned by Lord Ashcroft; they are on loan to the Royal Air Force Museum at Hendon. The Memorial Plaque was sold by his niece in September 2014 for £26,400 to a private buyer.

<doc id="1223584" wikidata="Q251607" url="?curid=1223584" title="European Council for Fatwa and Research">
<text>The European Council for Fatwa and Research (ECFR) is a Dublin-based private foundation, founded in London on 29–30 March 1997 on the initiative of the Federation of Islamic Organizations in Europe. The council is a largely self-selected body, composed of Islamic clerics and scholars, presided over by Yusuf al-Qaradawi.

== Goals and methodology ==

The stated goal of the ECFR is to issue fatwas that serve the needs of Muslims in Europe. The ECRF draws on all major schools of Sunni law as well as other traditional legal principles, such as objectives of sharia, concern for the public good, local custom, and the prevention of harm, in an effort to derive fatwas suitable for life in Europe. This methodology is intended to address situations which would be difficult to manage under a stricter interpretation of Islamic law, including using the doctrine of &quot;darura&quot; (necessity) to permit traditionally prohibited actions. The rulings of ECFR are nonbinding and are adopted through social acceptance.

== Membership ==

As of 2007, roughly two-thirds of the ECFR&#x27;s 35 members resided in North America and Europe and the rest were from Muslim-majority countries. Yusuf al-Qaradawi, a prominent Egyptian-born jurist residing in Qatar, has served as the chairman of the ECFR since its founding. The composition of the membership was intended to buttress legitimacy of the Council both in the West and in the Muslim world.

== Positions and reception ==

A 2001 ECRF ruling allowed a female convert to Islam to remain married to her non-Muslim husband, based in part on the existence of European laws and customs which guarantee women the freedom of religion. Rulings of this kind have been welcomed by some, but also criticized by others as being overly eclectic in legal methodology and having potential to negatively impact the interpretation of sharia in Muslim-majority countries.

In August 2005, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that although the council&#x27;s stated goal was to help Muslims integrate into European society, it is dominated by non-Europeans who have little grasp of what is acceptable in the West. A member of the Council cited the anti-Semitic forgery known as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion in a position paper arguing that Muslim families are under threat in Europe. It also reported that &quot;the council is part of a web of organizations that spread ideology close to the Muslim Brotherhood throughout Europe&quot;.

<text>The Stutz Bearcat was an American sports car of the pre– and post–World War I period.

Essentially, the Bearcat was a shorter ( wheelbase vs ), lighter version of the standard Stutz passenger car&#x27;s chassis. It was originally powered by a , 60-horsepower straight-four engine produced by the Wisconsin Motor Manufacturing Company. Common with racing and sports cars of the period, it featured minimal bodywork consisting of a &quot;dog house&quot; hood, open bucket seats, a tiny &quot;monocle&quot; windscreen in front of the driver, and a cylindrical fuel tank on a short rear deck. Production Bearcats differed from the factory &quot;White Squadron&quot; racers by having fenders, lights and a trunk. According to factory literature from 1913 the Bearcat &quot;was designed to meet the needs of the customer desiring a car built along the lines of a racing car with a slightly higher gear ratio than our normal torpedo roadster, has met with great favor with motor car owners and meets the demand for a car of this class.&quot;

==Model history==
The original production Bearcat was introduced in the Series A of 1912. The first public mention of the car (then spelled &quot;Bear Cat&quot; ) is in an advertisement in the 1912 program for the Indianapolis 500 mile race. This ad also was the first to use the soon to be famous Stutz slogan &quot;The Car that made good in a day&quot; referring to the Stutz racer&#x27;s 11th-place finish in the 1911 Indianapolis 500. The Series E of 1913 brought electric lights and starter. A six-cylinder option was available for an extra $250.00 (equivalent to $ in ). The doorless body style lasted through 1916. A sales catalog lists the available colors for the Series E as vermillion, monitor gray, and Mercedes red. Wire wheels were listed as a $125 option (equivalent to $ in ).

The Series S Bearcat of 1917 brought the first large change to the model. While it retained the wheelbase, its body now featured an enclosed cockpit with step-over sides. It continued to be right-hand drive with external gearshift and brake levers. The main change was a new Stutz-designed 16-valve four-cylinder engine. It was cast in a single block had a heat-treated nickel crank and camshafts. For 1919, the Series G was similar, but the mid-1919 Series H bodies featured cut-down sides to make cockpit entrance easier. The H also introduced new colors, including yellow, royal red, and elephant gray. By the end of 1919, price for a Bearcat had risen to $3,250 (equivalent to $ in , the same as the roadster and slightly less than the touring coupe). The 1920 Series K was again similar, but prices rose to $3,900 (equivalent to $ in ) in the wake of a postwar auto sales boom. The 1921 series K featuring a new &quot;DH&quot; engine with a detachable head was introduced, but a switch to left-hand drive in the following KLDH (L for left) meant the end of the Bearcat, since its narrow front seat and cockpit did not leave room for centrally located gear and brake levers. By 1922, the famed Bearcat name was missing from model lists and sales literature. For 1923, the roadster was renamed the Bearcat, but the name would again disappear in 1924.

The Bearcat name was reintroduced in 1931. The depression had not been kind to Stutz, so the name was used as a way to boost sales. The new Bearcat had the DV-32 (32 valve) eight-cylinder engine and each car came with an affidavit saying the car had been tested at . It was a small coupe featuring dual side-mount spare tires and a rakish dip in the doors, similar to contemporary (and future) sports cars. The car lasted through 1933. The same year, the model range was enhanced by the DV-32 powered &quot;Super Bearcat&quot;, which offered full weather protection and higher performance. Sitting on a wheelbase, it featured a lightweight fabric body built by Weymann. Stutz production ended in 1934.

==Racing history==
Its low weight, balance, and power made it an excellent racer. In 1912, Stutz Bearcats won 25 of the 30 auto races in which they were entered. In 1915 a stock Bearcat was driven by Erwin &quot;Cannon Ball&quot; Baker from California to New York in eleven days, seven hours, and fifteen minutes, shattering the previous record and inspiring the later Cannonball Run race and film spin-offs. The Stutz &quot;White Squadron&quot; factory racing team won the 1913 and 1915 championships.

==Prestige==
Owning a Stutz Bearcat became a status symbol for the wealthy of the era. In 1914 it was priced at $2,000 (equivalent to $ in ), almost four times that of the basic American-made Model T.

The colorful history and rakish image of the Stutz Bearcat made it one of the better known antique cars to later generations of Americans. It was often associated with the &quot;Roaring 20s&quot; and college students of that period. It was frequently mentioned with stereotypical accoutrements of the period such as raccoon coats and illicit &quot;bathtub gin&quot;. The Velvet Underground&#x27;s 1970 song &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; mentions a Stutz Bearcat to illustrate the bygone times described in the song.

That fame persisted well into the late 20th century and the car&#x27;s name was often used by way of comparison by modern makes of cars including Nash, Triumph and Mercury. A Triumph ad asked the question &quot;Is the TR 3 the Stutz Bearcat of the 60s?&quot; and showed a Triumph driver, complete with raccoon coat, next to an early 1920s Bearcat, in a campus setting. 
Nash&#x27;s early 1950s advertisement carries the line &quot;For the boy who wanted a Stutz Bearcat.&quot;

==Replicas==
Oklahoma City businessman Howard D. Williams attempted to capitalize on the model&#x27;s fame. In the late 1960s, he built and marketed a fiber-glass replica of the car, based on the chassis of an International Scout utility vehicle. It was broadly similar in outline (bucket seats, exposed fuel tank) but differed from the original in having left hand drive and many visual differences. It was aimed at luxury car buyers as a unique runabout, but its high price limited sales. It is thought about a dozen were completed. He also envisioned a cross country &quot;race&quot; where competitors would drive his Bearcats.

Car customizer George Barris made two much more accurate replicas for the 1971 television series &quot;Bearcats!&quot;. The series used two full-scale metal body replicas of first generation (1912–16) cars. While externally very close to the original cars, they were in fact built on custom chassis powered by Ford drivetrains and had modern four-wheel brake systems for safety.

==1970s–80s Bearcat==
The Bearcat name was resurrected for the 1967 Stutz Motor Car of America design based on Virgil Exner&#x27;s Duesenberg &quot;Revival Car&quot; concept. Because of design difficulties with this convertible, Stutz decided to produce the 1970 Blackhawk coupe first.

In 1976, a convertible called &quot;D&#x27;Italia&quot; based on a standard Blackhawk was presented at the Beverly Hills Hotel. The conversion was done by Dan Steckler, working for Stutz in California. Only one D&#x27;Italia was ever made, although others have done Blackhawk conversions as well (i.e. customizer John D&#x27;Agostino). Evel Knievel and Wayne Newton owned the car respectively. Elvis Presley also had a black Stutz with a red leather interior and a gold-plated gear stick. It was the last vehicle he drove, the night before he died. It is now housed along with a number of his other vehicles, at Graceland.

Because new (proposed) US safety regulations were to require convertibles to have a rollbar, an open-air Bearcat was not manufactured until 1979. The new Bearcat used the GM A platform shared with the Blackhawk, and was essentially a Targa top coupe. Stutz offered it for $100,000 (equivalent to $ in ). The Bearcat switched with the Blackhawk to the GM B platform in 1980, with the exterior continuing the Blackhawk&#x27;s exposed trunk-mounted spare tire and freestanding headlamps.

In 1987, a completely new Bearcat convertible, called the &quot;Bearcat II&quot;, was introduced. The base platform was the GM F platform for 1987, with the trailing edge of the spare forming part of the car&#x27;s rear bumper. The Bearcat II was based on the Pontiac Firebird chassis with V8 multi-port fuel-injected Corvette engine and had a lightweight, dent- and corrosion-proof body made of what Stutz called &quot;Diamond Fiber Comp.&quot;, a kind of carbon-fiber composite. It retailed for $125,000 (equivalent to $ in ), including a carbon-fiber hard top for use in winter and a matching luggage set. The German dealer Auto Becker in Düsseldorf offered the car with a 210 bhp, , multi-port fuel-injected V8 and a galvanized chassis for 380,000 DM. The Corvette engine was an option. Just 12 or 13 Bearcat IIs were produced between 1987 and 1995. Notable owners included the Sultan of Brunei, who owned two.

<text>The sarcolemma (&quot;sarco&quot; (from &quot;sarx&quot;) from Greek; flesh, and &quot;lemma&quot; from Greek; sheath), also called the myolemma, is the cell membrane surrounding a skeletal muscle fibre or a cardiomyocyte. 
It consists of a lipid bilayer and a thin outer coat of polysaccharide material (glycocalyx) that contacts the basement membrane. The basement membrane contains numerous thin collagen fibrils and specialized proteins such as laminin that provide a scaffold to which the muscle fibre can adhere. Through transmembrane proteins in the plasma membrane, the actin skeleton inside the cell is connected to the basement membrane and the cell&#x27;s exterior. At each end of the muscle fibre, the surface layer of the sarcolemma fuses with a tendon fibre, and the tendon fibres, in turn, collect into bundles to form the muscle tendons that adhere to bones.

The sarcolemma generally maintains the same function in muscle cells as the plasma membrane does in other eukaryote cells. It acts as a barrier between the extracellular and intracellular compartments, defining the individual muscle fibre from its surroundings. The lipid nature of the membrane allows it to separate the fluids of the intra- and extracellular compartments, since it is only selectively permeable to water through aquaporin channels. As in other cells, this allows for the compositions of the compartments to be controlled by selective transport through the membrane. Membrane proteins, such as ion pumps, may create ion gradients with the consumption of ATP, that may later be used to drive transport of other substances through the membrane (co-transport) or generate electrical impulses such as action potentials.

A special feature of the sarcolemma is that it invaginates into the sarcoplasm of the muscle cell, forming membranous tubules radially and longitudinally within the fiber called T-tubules or transverse tubules. On either side of the transverse tubules are terminal cisternal enlargements of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (termed endoplasmic reticulum in nonmuscle cells). A transverse tubule surrounded by two SR cisternae are known as a triad, and the contact between these structures is located at the junction of the A and I bands.

<doc id="1223603" wikidata="Q2701376" url="?curid=1223603" title="Sisowath Sirik Matak">
<text>Sisowath Sirik Matak (; 22 January 191421 April 1975) was a Cambodian politician and member of the Cambodian royal family, under the House of Sisowath.

Sirik Matak was mainly notable for his involvement in Cambodian politics, particularly for his involvement in the 1970 change in power against his cousin, then Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and for his subsequent establishment, along with Lon Nol, of the Khmer Republic.

==Early life==
Sirik Matak was born in Phnom Penh, and was a member of the Sisowath family, being the great-grandson of Sisowath of Cambodia by his grandfather Sisowath Essaravong and his father Sisowath Rathary. He was recruited into the colonial civil service in 1930.

Under the colonial French-imposed constitution, any member of the Norodom or Sisowath branches of the family could be selected as king, and Sirik Matak was therefore one of the possible contenders to the Cambodian throne. In 1941, after the death of King Sisowath Monivong, the French authorities selected Sirik Matak&#x27;s cousin Norodom Sihanouk to be King, believing him to be relatively pliant. Sihanouk later accused Sirik Matak of harbouring a deep resentment against him, stating that he &quot;hated me from childhood days because he thought his uncle, Prince Sisowath Monireth, should have been placed on the throne instead of myself. He even had a notion that he himself should have been chosen&quot;.

==Political career==

After the Second World War and capitulation of Japan, Sirik Matak became increasingly involved in Cambodian politics. As a part of the right-wing Khmer Renovation party headed by Lon Nol, he took part in the National Assembly elections in 1947, though the party failed to win any seats. Sihanouk, then acting as Prime Minister, placed him in charge of defence in 1952, formally appointing him Minister of Defence in the interim government set up after independence according to Geneva Accords in 1954; Sihanouk&#x27;s Sangkum movement absorbed the Khmer Renovation Party prior to the Sangkum victory in the 1955 elections.

Despite the incorporation of much of the right-wing opposition into the Sangkum, Sirik Matak remained an implacable opponent of Sihanouk, and especially of the latter&#x27;s toleration of North Vietnamese activity within Cambodia&#x27;s borders. Throughout the 1960s, Sihanouk attempted to minimize Sirik Matak&#x27;s leverage on domestic politics by successively appointing him as Ambassador to China (1962–1964), the Philippines, and Japan.

===Cambodian coup of 1970===

Sirik Matak&#x27;s power increased substantially after Lon Nol became prime minister in August 1969. After being appointed as Lon Nol&#x27;s deputy, he proceeded to organise a series of economic denationalisation and deregulation measures in opposition to Sihanouk&#x27;s previous policy of state control of import and export, banking, and production of pharmaceuticals and alcohol. Sirik Matak even visited Hanoi secretly to find out what could be done to remove North Vietnamese troops from Cambodian soil. He was infuriated when he was shown documents signed by Sihanouk agreeing to the establishment of North Vietnamese bases and the transport of Vietnamese supplies through Cambodian ports. 

On 12 March 1970, while Sihanouk was on a trip abroad, Sirik Matak canceled Sihanouk&#x27;s trade agreements and Lon Nol demanded that all North Vietnamese and NLF troops leave Cambodia by dawn on March 15. The deadline passed without any response from the Vietnamese. On 18 March, Sirik Matak assisted Lon Nol in organising a vote of the National Assembly to depose Sihanouk as head of state. The pretext was given by a series of anti-Vietnamese riots – likely encouraged by the Prime Minister and his deputy – in front of the North Vietnamese embassy.

Foreign media subsequently suggested that Sirik Matak, who continued as Lon Nol&#x27;s deputy in the new government, was the real organisational force behind the coup; it was claimed that in order to finally convince Lon Nol, Sirik Matak had played him a tape-recorded press conference from Paris, in which Sihanouk threatened to execute them both on his return to Phnom Penh. It was even reported that Sirik Matak compelled Lon Nol at gunpoint to commit to deposing Sihanouk.

Sihanouk also assumed his cousin to be the main force behind the coup, claiming that Sirik Matak (backed by the CIA, and in contact with long-time Sihanouk opponent Son Ngoc Thanh) had already suggested the plan to Lon Nol as early as 1969. Sihanouk&#x27;s suspicions seem to have rooted in fact: Prom Thos, one of Lon Nol&#x27;s ministers, later told the historian Ben Kiernan that in around March 1969 Sirik Matak had argued that Sihanouk should be assassinated, Lon Nol rejecting the plan as &quot;criminal insanity&quot;.

With the declaration of the Khmer Republic subsequent to the coup, Sirik Matak renounced his royal title, although he had initially planned in secret that his own son, or another member of the Sisowath family, possibly his son-in-law Prince Sisowath Duongchivin, should take the throne.

===Khmer Republic===
For the first year of the Republic, during which Lon Nol was often in poor health, Sirik Matak – as acting Premier – retained the most prominent role in the government. It had an overtly military character, Sirik Matak usually appearing in his full uniform as a Major-General and carrying a swagger stick. Whereas Lon Nol was particularly popular amongst anti-Sihanouk students in Cambodian cities, Sirik Matak had the support of the Westernised urban &#x27;elite&#x27;; rural Cambodians remained overwhelmingly pro-Sihanouk. 

Sirik Matak also had relatively little personal support within the Cambodian political establishment; his power was gradually undermined by the Prime Minister&#x27;s brother, Lon Non, and he resigned in 1972 after the latter had organised a series of demonstrations against him. Despite pressure from the United States, who were strong supporters of Sirik Matak, Lon Nol kept him under effective house arrest, and he became an increasingly vocal critic of the Khmer Republic regime.

By April 1973, Lon Nol had been compelled to remove Lon Non and suspended the National Assembly, appointing a &quot;High Political Council&quot; composed of himself, Sirik Matak, Cheng Heng and In Tam. Privately, however, Sirik Matak stated that under the circumstances it would be preferable to allow Sihanouk to return, due to his levels of popular support, stating &quot;if the people wanted him, I would accept&quot;. On being informed of this, an enraged Sihanouk called Sirik Matak &quot;one of the worst reactionaries and traitors of the history of Cambodia [...] we are going to hang him, quite simply hang him, hang him&quot;.

===The fall of Phnom Penh===

The Khmer Rouge communists initiated their dry-season offensive to capture the beleaguered Cambodian capital on 1 January 1975. On 1 April 1975, President Lon Nol resigned and fled the country into exile in Hawaii; the Khmer Rouge had published a &#x27;death list&#x27; with his name at the top, and their forces had now surrounded the capital.

On 12 April 1975, United States Ambassador to Cambodia John Gunther Dean offered high officials of the Khmer Republic political asylum in the United States, but Sirik Matak, Long Boret and Lon Non, along with other members of Lon Nol&#x27;s cabinet, declined – despite the names of Boret and Sirik Matak being published by the Khmer Rouge in a list of &quot;Seven Traitors&quot; marked for execution. Sirik Matak&#x27;s written response to the ambassador stated:

The letter was reproduced and added to the book &quot;Autrefois, Maison Privée&quot;.

Shortly after the surrender to the Khmer Rouge was announced, Sirik Matak sought refuge at the Hotel Le Phnom, where the International Red Cross was attempting to create a safe zone. He was turned away once the Red Cross learned that his name was on the list of &quot;Seven Traitors&quot;. Outside the hotel, Sirik Matak talked to reporters and distributed copies of his letter to Ambassador Dean. François Bizot reported that Sirik Matak sought political asylum at the French Embassy and that the Khmer Rouge threatened to come into the compound and remove certain individuals by force if they did not go voluntarily. Accompanied by the French Vice-Consul Jean Dyrac and journalist Jon Swain, Bizot took responsibility for informing Sirik Matak of the Khmer Rouge&#x27;s demands, at which point he voluntarily surrendered and left on a Khmer Rouge Jeep with Mam Nai. Sirik Matak and the officials that remained along with him were likely executed by the Khmer Rouge on 21 April 1975.

The exact details of his death are unclear, but Sihanouk received confirmation that Sirik Matak, along with Long Boret, had been summarily executed by firing squad at the Phnom Penh &quot;Cercle Sportif&quot; on 21 April; other reports state he was beheaded. Henry Kissinger and others, however, note a report that Sirik Matak was shot in the stomach and left without medical aid to die over three days.

<doc id="1223605" wikidata="Q7339078" url="?curid=1223605" title="Dr. Jose Rizal Park">
<text>Dr. Jose Rizal Park is a 9.6 acre (39,000 m2) park on the west slope of Beacon Hill in Seattle, Washington. The land, condemned by the city in 1917 for engineering purposes, was acquired by the Parks Department in 1971, and the park was dedicated eight years later. The park is named after José Rizal, the de facto national hero of the Philippines.

Rizal Park is bounded on the west by Interstate 5, on the north by Interstate 90, on the east by 12th Avenue S., and on the south by S. Judkins Street and the Jungle. The park consists of a grassy upper area with shelter and picnic tables, a wooded hillside, and an off-leash dog park at the foot of the hill.

== History ==
The land that would become Rizal Park was condemned by the city in 1917 for engineering purposes during the regrading of Dearborn and Jackson streets but was left undeveloped for several decades. The property was acquired in 1971 by the Parks Department, who built a small viewpoint and parking area. In 1973, the Filipino Alumni Association petitioned the city to honor the Filipino nationalist José Rizal; the park was renamed to Dr. Jose Rizal Park the following year. Funds to develop the park&#x27;s facilities were granted by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1978 and work began with a groundbreaking on June 16, 1979.

The city government dedicated Rizal Park on June 7, 1981, with opening ceremonies led by mayor Charles Royer as part of Seattle&#x27;s &quot;Philippine Week&quot;. The park was designed by Elaine Day LaTourelle with a picnic shelter, an amphitheater, play areas, and a public restroom. A mural by Val Laigo depicted the cultural diversity of the Philippines and the country&#x27;s relationship with the United States. The expansion cost $343,500 to construct. &quot;Seattle Times&quot; design critic Norman Johnston described the park&#x27;s fixtures and materials as &quot;economical, unpretentious and substantial supports&quot; and praised its simple design on a complicated site.

<doc id="1223608" wikidata="Q4357241" url="?curid=1223608" title="Cindy Wilson">
<text>Cynthia Leigh Wilson (born February 28, 1957) is an American musician and one of the vocalists, songwriters and founding members of new wave rock band the B-52&#x27;s. She is noted for her distinctive contralto voice and also plays percussion during live shows. She is the younger sister of the late guitarist Ricky Wilson (1953–1985), who was also a founding member of the band.

In addition to her work with the B-52&#x27;s, Wilson has released two solo EPs, &quot;Sunrise&quot; (2016) and &quot;Supernatural&quot; (2017). In late 2017, she released her debut solo album, &quot;Change&quot;, via the independent label Kill Rock Stars. Wilson released her second solo album, &quot;Realms&quot;, in August 2023.

==Biography==
===1957–1975: Early life===
Wilson was born February 28, 1957 in Athens, Georgia. She had one elder brother, Ricky. When Ricky was 19 years old, he began learning to play guitar, and invited Cindy to harmonize along with his instrumentation. 

===1976–1984: Career beginnings and The B-52s===
The B-52&#x27;s were formed when Wilson, her brother Ricky, keyboardist and backing vocalist Kate Pierson, drummer and percussionist Keith Strickland, and lead vocalist Fred Schneider played an impromptu musical jam session after sharing a tropical Flaming Volcano drink at a local Chinese restaurant. Prior, Ricky Wilson and Strickland had considered forming a band after taking a post-college vacation of Europe. The band played their first concert in 1977 at a Valentine&#x27;s Day party for their friends in Athens. Wilson, then 19 years old, was the youngest member of the band.

The group recorded and released their debut album &quot;The B-52&#x27;s&quot; in 1979, released through Warner Bros. Records, which yielded the charting singles &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; and &quot;Planet Claire&quot; and launched the band into stardom. The album peaked at number 7 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was also especially popular in Australia. &quot;[The record companies] were looking for new wave punk, and we fit the bill because they thought we were very original,&quot; Wilson recalled. &quot;We got some money to support us, and then we could concentrate on growing our shows a little more and writing more music.&quot; From their inception, the band drew attention for their flamboyant stage attire, which included Wilson and Pierson donning beehive hairdos and go-go boots.

The band released their second album, &quot;Wild Planet&quot;, in 1980, during which time they pooled their income together to purchase a house in upstate New York, where they all lived together and recorded material. Their third studio album, &quot;Whammy!&quot;, was released in 1983, also through Warner Bros. Records.

===1985–1993: Mainstream success and hiatus===
On April 21, 1985, Wilson married Keith Bennett, a successful advertiser who was a longtime friend of the band and Ricky&#x27;s guitar tech on tour. Her brother, Ricky, died later that year of an AIDS-related illness, leaving her devastated. She recalled of his illness and death:

The band had recorded the bulk of their fourth release, &quot;Bouncing Off the Satellites&quot; (1986) prior to Ricky Wilson&#x27;s death. The group subsequently took a hiatus, returning three years later with their fifth album, &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot; (1989), which featured drummer Keith Strickland assuming the role of lead guitarist in Ricky Wilson&#x27;s absence. The album featured several highly successful singles, including &quot;Roam&quot; and &quot;Love Shack&quot;, both of which went on to become two of the band&#x27;s signature tracks.

Wilson took a sabbatical from the band in 1990 to concentrate on raising a family of two children, during which time the B-52&#x27;s recorded and released the album &quot;Good Stuff&quot; as a trio of Pierson, Schneider and Strickland. During the live tour to promote &quot;Good Stuff&quot; in 1992 and 1993, Julee Cruise sang as a replacement for Wilson.

===1994–present: Return to the B-52&#x27;s, solo work===
Wilson rejoined the B-52&#x27;s in 1994. In 1998, she took part in recordings for two new songs to be included with the band&#x27;s hit singles on the album &quot;Time Capsule: Songs for a Future Generation&quot;. Wilson then took maternity leave in 1999 (being replaced on tour by Gail Ann Dorsey), later rejoining the band in 2001 for regular touring of their greatest hits.

The B-52&#x27;s completed the album &quot;Funplex&quot; in 2007, and it was released in March 2008. Wilson co-wrote every song on the album with the three other band members. In all, she has co-written much of the band&#x27;s catalog, including &quot;Dance This Mess Around&quot;, &quot;Private Idaho&quot; and all of the &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot; album, including hit singles &quot;Love Shack&quot; and &quot;Roam&quot;.

Wilson self-released an EP of new material, &quot;Sunrise&quot;, in September 2016. February 2017 saw the self-release of another EP of new material, &quot;Supernatural&quot;. Wilson released her debut solo record, &quot;Change&quot;, in December 2017 through the independent label Kill Rock Stars. On August 25, 2023, she released her second solo album, &quot;Realms&quot;. Its first single, &quot;Midnight&quot;, was released in May 2023.

Wilson&#x27;s vocal efforts include the typical B-52&#x27;s call-and-response vocals with Schneider and/or Pierson, as well as her harmonies with Pierson on the band&#x27;s all-female songs such as &quot;Roam&quot;, &quot;52 Girls&quot;, &quot;Cake&quot;, &quot;Legal Tender&quot;, &quot;Summer of Love&quot; and &quot;Juliet of the Spirits&quot;. One of the band&#x27;s signature elements is the setup among the three vocalists. However, Wilson sings the greatest number of solo performances in the band, especially on their earlier albums. Examples of Cindy&#x27;s solo vocal performances in the B-52&#x27;s include &quot;Hero Worship&quot;, &quot;Loveland&quot;, &quot;Nip It in the Bud&quot;, &quot;Girl from Ipanema Goes to Greenland&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t It a Shame&quot;, &quot;She Brakes for Rainbows&quot; and &quot;Give Me Back My Man&quot;.

Wilson plays the bongos on live favorites like &quot;Planet Claire&quot;, &quot;Mesopotamia&quot;, &quot;Pump&quot; and &quot;Party Out of Bounds&quot; as well as other songs such as &quot;6060-842&quot; and &quot;Big Bird&quot;. She also has played acoustic guitar in The Cindy Wilson Band, made electric guitar contributions (with her brother Ricky) on the songs &quot;There&#x27;s a Moon in the Sky (Called the Moon)&quot; from &quot;The B-52&#x27;s&quot;, and played the guitar solo for &quot;Nip It In the Bud&quot; during the band&#x27;s 1982 &quot;Mesopotamia&quot; tour. She has stated that she was encouraged to play guitar by her brother, but experienced finger pain.

== Collaborations ==
* She sang with the Ramones in the early 1980s on the song &quot;Chop Suey&quot;, along with Kate Pierson and Debbie Harry; the title is available as a bonus track on the Ramones&#x27; 2002 expanded edition CD re-release of &quot;Pleasant Dreams&quot;.
* Wilson, Pierson and Keith Strickland were part of the group Melon and recorded two songs (&quot;I Will Call You&quot; and &quot;Honeydew&quot;) for a Japanese TV show titled &quot;Snakeman Show&quot;. The soundtrack LP from 1980 and CD from 1988 was released only in Japan.

<text>The Torre Latinoamericana () is a skyscraper in downtown Mexico City. Its central location, height (), and history make it one of the city&#x27;s most important landmarks. The skyscraper notably withstood the 8.1 magnitude 1985 Mexico City earthquake without damage, whereas several other structures in the downtown area were damaged.

The Torre Latinoamericana was Mexico&#x27;s tallest completed building for almost 27 years, from its opening in 1956 until 1982 when the tall Torre Ejecutiva Pemex was completed. Although the structure of the Hotel de México (now known as the WTC Mexico City) had already surpassed it a decade earlier, it wouldn&#x27;t be finished until 1994.

==Construction==

Many think it was the first skyscraper in Mexico. However, skyscrapers may have first appeared in Mexico City between 1910 and 1935. The tallest of the time, the International Capital Building (Edificio Internacional de Capitalización) was completed in 1935. This building was surpassed by the Edificio Miguel E. Abed, which, in turn, was surpassed by the Latinoamericana Tower. The Latinoamericana Tower opened its doors on April 30, 1956.

The Torre Latinoamericana was built on the place which was formerly occupied by the animal house, some kind of zoo of the Tlatoani Mexica Moctezuma II. After the conquest, there was built Convent of San Francisco. Later, the monastery was disbanded and most of its property confiscated.

The Torre Latinoamericana was built to headquarter La Latinoamericana, Seguros, S.A., an insurance company founded on April 30, 1906. The building took its name from this company as it began to be built during the postwar boom of the late 1940s, which lasted until the early 1970s. At the time of its construction, the insurance company was controlled by the Mexican tycoon Miguel S. Macedo, who headed one of Mexico&#x27;s largest financial consortiums at the time.

Originally the insurance company occupied a smaller building at the same location. In 1947 it temporarily relocated to a nearby office while the tower was built. Once it was finished in 1956, the insurance company moved into the tower&#x27;s 4th to 8th floors. The rest of the building&#x27;s office space was for lease. At the time of its completion the Torre Latinoamericana was the 45th tallest building in the world. It was also the tallest building in Latin America, and the fourth in height in the world outside New York. Its public observation deck on the 44th floor is the highest in Mexico City.

==Earthquakes==

The project was designed and executed by Dr. Leonardo Zeevaert and his brother Adolfo Zeevaert, Mexican civil engineers born in Veracruz. Nathan M. Newmark was the main consultant. Its design consists of a steel-frame construction and deep-seated piles, which were necessary given Mexico City&#x27;s frequent earthquakes and muddy soil composition, which makes the terrain tricky to build on. Before construction, both engineers carried out a number of soil mechanics studies in the construction site, and designed the structure accordingly. Today this is common and even mandatory practice, but at the time it was quite an innovation.

The tower gained notoriety when it withstood the magnitude 7.9 1957 earthquake, thanks to its outstanding design and strength. This feat garnered it recognition in the form of the American Institute of Steel Construction Award of Merit for &quot;the tallest building ever exposed to a huge seismic force&quot; (as is attested by plaques in the building&#x27;s lobby and observation deck). However, an even greater test came, by far, with the magnitude 8.1 September 19, 1985 earthquake, which destroyed many buildings in Mexico City, especially the ones built downtown, in the tower&#x27;s neighborhood. The Torre Latinoamericana withstood this force without problems, and has thus become a symbol of safety in Mexico City. Today the tower is considered one of the safest buildings in the city despite its potentially dangerous location.

While it was being built, detractors said that there was no way a building of that size could withstand one of Mexico City&#x27;s earthquakes.

==Current use==

The tower is now co-owned by its original builder La Latinoamericana, Seguros, Inmobiliaria Torre Latinoamericana, a real estate firm. In 2002 seven of the 44 floors were purchased by Telcel and Banco Inbursa, both firms controlled by Mexican businessman Carlos Slim.

In 2006, the tower celebrated its 50th anniversary. A ceremony was held on April 30, 2006, which included the reopening of the newly remodeled 37th to 44th floors, a site museum, and a fully remodeled Mirador, or observation deck, designed by Danish-born architect Palle Seiersen Frost. Also on that occasion were unveiled some recognitions granted by several architectural, engineering and communications institutions.

The Torre Latinoamericana contains the FM transmission facilities for Radio Fórmula&#x27;s two FM stations in Mexico City, XERFR-FM 103.3 and XEDF-FM 104.1.

Plans for the tower include a facelift, which will remodel the building&#x27;s exteriors using new materials while maintaining the original design and look; since the tower is considered a historical monument, its exterior look cannot be altered.

==In popular culture==
*The building features in a photograph by Mexican photographer Enrique Metinides when a suicidal man climbed out on to the ledge of the 27th floor in 1993. A Red Cross worker managed to prevent his death.
*The tower can be briefly seen from inside a helicopter during the beginning of Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot;.
*It&#x27;s also featured prominently in Alfonso Cuarón&#x27;s &quot;Sólo con tu pareja&quot;.
*As a fixture of the Mexico City skyline, the tower also appears in the opening scene of Alejandro González Iñárritu&#x27;s &quot;Amores Perros&quot;.
*The tower is seen in &quot;Spectre&quot; (2015) after James Bond hijacks a helicopter by killing a hired assassin and the pilot.

<text>George Leslie Drewry (3 November 1894 – 2 August 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Drewry was born on 3 November 1894 to Thomas and Mary Drewry. He joined the Naval Reserve in 1913, and was called up for service at the start of World War I. 

As a 20-year-old midshipman in the Royal Naval Reserve during the First World War, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 25 April 1915 at V Beach in the Landing at Cape Helles, during the Gallipoli campaign.

He later achieved the rank of lieutenant and was killed in an accident at Scapa Flow, Orkney Islands, on 2 August 1918.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Imperial War Museum, London, England.

<doc id="1223620" wikidata="Q7594677" url="?curid=1223620" title="St Mary's Church, Clophill">
<text>The present St Mary&#x27;s Church is located in the centre of the small village of Clophill, between Bedford and Luton in the county of Bedfordshire in the South Midlands of England. The new church, built in 1848, replaced the old church by order of the Church Commissioners in 1850. The old church building, formally The Church of St Mary The Virgin (shortened to The Church of St Mary) and known colloquially as Old St Mary&#x27;s or The Old Parish Church, is at the edge of the village, and is estimated to be around 650 years old. It sits at the crest of the Greensand Ridge, offering views over the surrounding countryside. Its graveyard is a haven for wild flowers and wildlife. After the church moved to the village centre, incorporating various items from the old church building, the old building was converted for use as a mortuary chapel, but in the 1950s it fell into ruin.

The Church of England no longer has responsibility for the Old Parish Church, nor is it deemed to be consecrated; legally it is the responsibility of Central Bedfordshire Council. It acquired first local, then more widespread, notoriety in the 1960s, as a result of the desecration of a number of the church&#x27;s graves, with the attendant sensationalist suspicions of Satanism and black masses. In 2010 Central Bedfordshire Council, prompted by local activists concerned with the condition of the church, announced it would attempt to restore the Old Church and adopt it for use as a bothy on a regional walking trail. Those plans proved too expensive for the council; instead, in 2012 a new project was announced, which included stabilising the existing ruin and providing a viewing platform on the top of the tower, besides building a heritage centre next to the church.

== The Church of St Mary The Virgin ==

The ruined church at the village edge is a Grade II* listed building, first listed in 1961 and formerly called The Old Parish Church, but later re-listed under the name The Church of St Mary The Virgin. It was probably built c. 1350. It was built in the Perpendicular style, the fabric being mostly of coarse ironstone rubble with ashlar dressings. William Henry Page, writing in 1908, dated the two-light windows of the belfry, the two-light west window, and the tower arch to the 15th century, and noted that the nave walls are older than the tower. Improvements were made in the early 19th century, with a west gallery added in 1814 and a new east end to the chancel in 1819. By the 1820s the church&#x27;s seating capacity had become insufficient. Plans to enlarge it came to naught partly as a consequence of the rector falling ill. He died in 1843, and a new rector was appointed, who wanted to relocate the church to the village centre.

So instead, a new church was built (1848–1849) and the old one used, for a while, as a mortuary chapel for the graveyard, which remained in use. One of those uses, apparently, was extraordinary: according to the 1908 &quot;A History of the County of Bedford&quot;, vol. 2, edited by Page, &quot;The churchyard possessed the unenviable reputation of being a haunt of body snatchers, and many human bones have been dug up in the fields of Brickwall Farm&quot;.

In 1854 the remains of the original church consisted of little more than the nave and tower. The chancel and the galleries had been removed in its conversion for use as a chapel, and several items (including the lych gate and two of the bells) had been transferred to the new building. Stephen Glynne in 1854 described it as &quot;a poor, small church on top of a very high hill, having only a nave and tower, the chancel having been destroyed and the church is now wholly abandoned&quot;. In 1898, the church was described in Kelly&#x27;s Directory for Bedfordshire, which said it &quot;contains several interesting memorial tablets to the Rev. Charles Fletcher M.A., 1753, the Rev. William Pierce Nethersole, vicar of Pulloxhill, 1799, and another to members of the family of the Rev. Ezekiel Rouse: the roof is of ancient oak. The register dates from the year 1568&quot;.

Repairs were made in 1901, which ironically prevented Page (in 1908) from being able to date precisely the nave and tower. After the lead was stolen from the roof in 1956, however, the building fell into ruin.

===1960s desecration===
In the 1960s the church became a focus of media attention after a widely reported incident of graveyard desecration was followed by a series of similar incidents, both at Clophill and across Britain.

On 16 March 1963, in a street in Clophill, a local couple saw two Luton youths playing with a human skull. The youths claimed that they had taken it from inside St Mary&#x27;s, where they had discovered it stuck on a broken piece of window frame that had been jammed into a wall. On the floor were a breastbone, pelvis and leg bones laid &quot;in the pattern used for the Black Mass&quot;, as it was described in newspaper reports of police statements. Scattered cockerel feathers and tracings of two Maltese crosses infilled in red, one newly done and the other somewhat weatherworn, were found inside the church. The rector at that time, Rev. Leslie Barker, reported that six graves of females had been tampered with before the stone slab above a seventh, that of Jenny Humberstone who had died in 1770 aged 22, had been dislodged and the coffin broken open. Barker, speaking to the press, stated that &quot;Satan worshippers are known to always use a female at the centre of their ceremonies&quot;, and his churchwarden ascribed the damage to &quot;some kind of devil worship&quot;. Similarly, police reportedly stated that, as animal sacrifice was commonly described in accounts of satanic rites, the cockerel was possibly &quot;sacrificial&quot;, and the crosses were possibly painted with animal blood (although on this point Barker disagreed, thinking them more likely to be simply red paint). Author and researcher Bill Ellis, writing some years later, opined that the police&#x27;s idea of a &quot;sacrificial cockerel&quot; had been derived from a scene in Denis Wheatley&#x27;s 1934 novel &quot;The Devil Rides Out&quot;, where a black cock and white hen are sacrificed.

The remains of Jenny Humberstone were reinterred on 23 March, but the incident was not to be an isolated one, thanks to the newspaper publicity. Her grave was desecrated again on two occasions before 2 April, and the church had become a night-time attraction for local teenagers. Humberstone&#x27;s grave was resealed but was reopened on the night of the following full moon, and there was a run on books about magic at Luton Central Library. The discovery of the heads of six cows and a horse in Bluebell Wood, Caddington, south of Luton, on 9 April was linked to the desecration at St Mary&#x27;s, fueling further interest. 

Around the time of the Bluebell Woods incident, a local newspaper interviewed a student from Silsoe Agricultural College who admitted to having visited the church in 1961 with a group of students, i.e. two years before the March 1963 incident at Clophill that saw the disinterment of Jenny Humberstone&#x27;s bones. They had killed a cockerel, spread its feathers and blood around, and drawn a Celtic cross as &quot;a huge joke&quot; that &quot;doesn&#x27;t seem so funny now&quot;. Notably, these particular students didn&#x27;t admit to opening any graves or exhuming any human bones.

Stories about St Mary&#x27;s, and about Clophill in general, continued. The church and the reputation that it had gained from the incident were mentioned in a coffee-table book on witchcraft by the folklorist Eric Maple, who described &quot;desolate Clophill&quot; with a &quot;wilderness of desecrated and looted tombs, symbols of the revival of black magic in the twentieth century&quot;, and recommended that people visit it for a &quot;truly Gothic experience&quot;. Leslie Barker retired in 1969, and reported that since the first incidents in 1963 there had been numerous instances of graves being broken into &quot;and some sort of rite performed&quot;.

The desecration of St Mary&#x27;s in 1963 was followed by a spate of similar newspaper reports of &quot;black magic rites&quot; in churches in 1963 and 1964, including reports of a series of desecrations in Lancashire, symbols painted on the porch of a church in Bramber, Sussex, and a pentagram and a sheep&#x27;s heart pierced with thirteen thorns in St Clement&#x27;s in Leigh-on-Sea.

The incident was covered in the 2013 film &quot;The Paranormal Diaries: Clophill&quot;.

===Transfer to BCC and future use===
Central Bedfordshire Council (then Bedfordshire County Council) acquired the old church in 1977. The site continued to suffer from vandalism, as well as fly-tipping, under Council ownership. In 2010, local activism led to plans for the church to acquire a new function. It was proposed to convert it into a bothy to provide overnight accommodation for walkers on the Bedfordshire Greensand Ridge walk, with a full-time warden on site. However, there were concerns that the Council would not be able to afford the £75,000 that it would have to spend on such a project.

Instead, in 2012 English Heritage and Heritage at Risk agreed to fund restoration work on the church. The work, which was scheduled to start in 2013, has now been completed to include the stabilising of the ruin and putting in a gravel pathway inside the church; and restoring a spiral staircase and providing a viewing platform to allow visitors to climb to the top of the tower and observe the view. Currently the tower tours run daily at 10am and 2pm. Visitors may need to telephone ahead (there is a number to call at the site of the church) as the tours are run by volunteers. Further planned work will then include building a heritage centre next to the church building. The total cost of completing the project is stated to be £225,000, of which £75,000 is to be contributed by English Heritage and £100,000 by Heritage at Risk. The remaining balance of £50,000, to be used for the stabilisation and restoration, is to be funded by Waste Recycling Environmental Limited&#x27;s Heritage Fund.

== St Mary&#x27;s Church ==

The replacement church in the village centre, the current St Mary&#x27;s Church, was built over the period 1848–1849. The lych gate was transferred there from the old church, as were two of the church bells, one made in 1623 and the other, a treble, made by Emerton of Wootton in 1774. A third bell, bearing only the initials &quot;R.C.&quot;, was left behind in the old building. The parish church was officially transferred to the new building from what was then named the Church of St Mary in September 1850.

The architect in charge of building the new church was Thomas Smith of Hertford, who had also built the church at Silsoe. Built by Smith &amp; Appleford of Pimlico, the Clophill church was constructed out of brown sandstone in rubble courses, with details in Portland stone. The nave was exactly long and wide, with the aisle wide. It had a gallery at the west end, an open tower that allowed a view of the west end window, and open uniform pews in the nave and aisle to accommodate 530 people. In total, with the exception of the south aisle and the sandstone that were donated by the then parish rector J. Mendham and Earl de Grey respectively, the building cost £2,300 ().

In May 1957, an additional bell was moved from the old church to the new by Whitechapel Bell Foundry, at a cost of £123. This was one of several removals from the old church that were performed as reaction to the theft of the lead from its roof the year before. The cross-beam from its roof, which Page in 1908 had described as &quot;enriched with a vine pattern of sixteenth-century character&quot; was moved to a new memorial Chapel of St Alban in the new building, which was consecrated on 17 June 1958 by the bishop who was then the Archbishop in Jerusalem (now the Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem). John Gedge, architect, of Bedford, drew up the plans for this new chapel, which involved reorienting the organ, as well as a new altar and altar rail, a new choir vestry, a new credence table, and a new prayer desk. The altar rail in the new chapel was made from new oak and an 18th-century staircase taken from old church.

Some years later, in 1964, dry rot was discovered in the roof of the new church. Chrystal &amp; West, another firm of Bedford architects, drew up plans to remove the existing roof and clerestory, and substitute the steep pitched roof that remains today.

Kelly&#x27;s Directory of 1898 noted that the church had been erected by public subscription and was &quot;approached by a noble avenue of elms.&quot;

Today the parish church is part of the benefice of Campton, Clophill and Haynes, in deanery of Ampthill and Shefford, and the archdeaconry of Bedford.

<doc id="1223621" wikidata="Q2081758" url="?curid=1223621" title="Baldoyle">
<text>Baldoyle () is a coastal suburb of Dublin&#x27;s northside. It is located in the southeastern part of the jurisdiction of Fingal, Ireland, developed from a former fishing village.

Baldoyle is also a civil parish in the barony of Coolock within the traditional County Dublin.

==Location and access==

Baldoyle is located northeast of the city, and borders Donaghmede, which was formed from its western part, Portmarnock, Sutton and Bayside. It can be accessed from the coast road from Dublin to Howth, which includes a cycle track, from Sutton Cross via Station Road, or from Donaghmede, or Portmarnock.

Baldoyle is served by Dublin Bus and Irish Rail, the latter currently via the Sutton and Bayside stations on the Howth Branch of the DART, and by Clongriffin station on the Northern Branch, which is also the Dublin-Belfast main line. The railway line functions as the western boundary of the area.

Baldoyle is also served by Dublin Bus routes H1 (Baldoyle to City Centre) and H2 (Malahide to City Centre via Portmarnock)

Areas neighbouring Baldoyle are Sutton, Bayside, Portmarnock and Donaghmede, including Clongriffin.

==Geography==
Baldoyle is mostly level coastal plains, with the Mayne River passing under the railway line through a bridge structure known as the &quot;Red Arches&quot; and crossing in its northern parts, and coming to the sea. This river takes in the Grange Stream from Donaghmede, and other tributaries, notably the Seagrange Park Stream from the south and a small tributary from the Clongriffin estate to the west. The Mayne has, and some of its tributaries had, a history of flooding. A boy drowned in 1993 in the Seagrange Park Stream, when it was being culverted. This stream had once run south to the sea at Kilbarrack Road but was diverted to the Mayne.

A major townland of Baldoyle, encompassing much of what is now Donaghmede, is Grange, indicating that it was previously farmland.

==Etymology==
The district name derives from meaning &quot;town&quot; and meaning &quot;dark (-haired) stranger&quot;, the name given by the Gaels to the Danes to distinguish them from the Norwegians or &quot;fair (-haired) strangers&quot; (&quot;finn-ghaill&quot;) who first settled in Ireland in 841–842. While it is sometimes rendered as &quot;Doyle&#x27;s town&quot; with reference to the personal name Doyle which itself derives from &quot;dubh-ghaill&quot;, there is no evidence for this usage.

==Features and Development==
Baldoyle village today has a coastal main street, with a Roman Catholic church, a community hall, a modern county library branch with sea views, and some shops and pubs. Slightly inland, among the older suburban houses, is a small shopping precinct containing a Lidl supermarket, a football club, another Roman Catholic church, and other amenities. On the approach from the coast road is a well-known pub, the Elphin.

Many businesses in the area are represented by the Howth Sutton Baldoyle Chamber of Commerce.

===Baldoyle Industrial Estate===
On Grange Road towards Donaghmede is a light industrial estate, with more than forty businesses and the local An Post sorting and delivery office. Businesses located there include major generic pharmaceuticals player Mylan, the largest tenant of the estate, Irish Papers, Grange Builders Providers, Ferrum Trading Co Ltd Steel Stockholders, Poolbeg Press, Curtis &amp; Lees, Ireland&#x27;s Eye Knitwear, Grange Electrical Wholesalers, Baldoyle Print and Forest Tosara, producers of Sudocrem (invented in Dublin).

===Housing developments===
In the 20th and 21st centuries, Baldoyle has been at the centre of a large housebuilding programme, with the former racecourse having been sold to developers. The new developments have begun, as &quot;The Coast&quot;, facing a new local centre at the northern edge of Donaghmede, Clongriffin. Clongriffin Dart station opened in April 2010 serving Baldoyle and racecourse developments such as &quot;The Coast&quot;, and northern Donaghmede.

===Parks===
Seagrange Park is a public park that includes a modern playground and sports pitches. A new public park was to be built on part of the former racecourse lands, including a wildlife or nature park, and while this is still pending, a community garden is maintained on part of those lands.

===Christian Brothers===
Among the local residents are the retired members of the Congregation of Christian Brothers, whose retirement home, St. Patricks, is located in the town. There is a graveyard where approx 1000 members of the Christian Brothers are buried. St. Josephs, Baldoyle was formerly the site of the Christian Brothers Training School.

==Education==
In the centre of the village is a secondary school for girls, St. Mary&#x27;s, while further inland is a large co-educational secondary school, Pobalscoil Neasáin. There is a co-educational primary school, St. Laurence&#x27;s National School, catering for children aged 4–12, and with junior and senior buildings. Formerly St. Peter and Paul&#x27;s BNS and St. Mary&#x27;s GNS, the schools amalgamated at the beginning of the 2013/2014 school year to become St. Laurence&#x27;s National School. Junior Infants to 2nd Class pupils attend the junior school in the Grange Road campus (the former girls&#x27; school), while 3rd Class to 6th Class pupils attend the senior school in the Brookstone Road campus (the former boys&#x27; school). Both buildings are within minutes of each other. Also in the village area is a special needs primary school run by St. Micheals house.

==Religion==
Baldoyle is a parish in the Howth deanery of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin.

==History==

Baldoyle with its sheltered waterside location, was a Viking base for many years, eventually razed by an attack by the King of Leinster in 1012. However, it remained under Danish control under the arrival of the Anglo-Normans, when the last Danish chieftain, Hamund McTorkaill, was overthrown. The lands of Baldoyle were later presented to the Priory of All Hallows, which had been founded by Diarmaid mac Murchadha in 1150, on the site that is now Trinity College Dublin. The monks built the Grange Church, now known as Grange Abbey, which now lies in Donaghmede. By the 1500s, the area owned by the Priory at Baldoyle included gardens, arable land, pasture, a meadow, a copse, a warren, and woodland. The Priory lost the lands in 1536, during the dissolution of the monasteries when Henry VIII granted the lands to the Dublin Corporation. By 1630, Grange Abbey was in ruins, but the associated graveyard was used into the 1700s.

During the 1600s, there was an hostelry or inn in Baldoyle, which is recounted in one of the oldest hunting songs recorded from Ireland concerning Michael St Lawrence and a hunting party who went to Baldoyle after a day of hunting. The manuscript of the song is held in the Sloan manuscripts of the British Museum. During the 1700s, Jonathan Swift was a frequent visitor to Baldoyle, who had a number of friends who lived in the area, including at Grange House.

A description of Baldoyle from Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Topographical Dictionary of Ireland&quot; (Dublin, 1837) gives a useful summary of what was then a substantial rural fishing village:
The parliament mentioned above was held at Grange Church, which was partly restored in the late 20th century after a period of neglect. At that time the area had a population of 1208, of whom 1009 lived in the village, and the lands belonged entirely to Dublin Corporation. There were three &quot;big houses&quot; viz Grange Lodge, Donaghmede House and Talavera, a police station and a coast guard base, and both a parish school and a hedge school, and at least one holy well.

At the turn of the 20th century, Baldoyle was still primarily a fishing village, with 9 fishing wherries. The small harbour also received coal shipments. At this time, Baldoyle was also a popular bathing spot, and attracted visitors. James Warren, allegedly Ireland&#x27;s oldest man, died in Baldoyle in 1887 at age 167.

The new district of Donaghmede, comprising perhaps six major housing development areas and a commercial and social core, was &quot;carved out&quot; of Baldoyle&#x27;s inland lands, along with a little of Coolock, and some places often described as part of Raheny, in the 1960s and 1970s; it now has a population considerably greater than that of Baldoyle.

===Baldoyle Racecourse===

For most of the 20th century, Baldoyle was well known for its racecourse, which was one of three in the Dublin metropolitan area (and for a period the only one). Open land in the village had been an informal venue for horse races in the early nineteenth century, and annual race meetings at the site were proposed in 1842 at the same time as the closure of the Howth Park Racecourse in nearby Sutton and Howth. A new enclosed course was opened in May 1874, which continued in regular use for almost a century, until it was closed in August 1972 due to financial difficulties related to the potential costs of necessary renovations.

The year after closure, on 31 October 1973, one of the most spectacular and audacious escapes from an Irish prison took place when three of the Provisional IRA&#x27;s key personnel were airlifted to freedom in a hijacked helicopter from Mountjoy Prison. The helicopter touched down at the disused racecourse where the IRA members escaped in waiting cars.

For several years during the 1960s, Baldoyle Racecourse became the destination for annual sponsored charity walks, which were intended to raise funds for the Central Remedial Clinic.

==Sport==

===Football===
Baldoyle is home to Baldoyle United FC, with teams in the NDSL, MGL and Leinster Senior League, and principal facilities at Brookstone Road. Games are also played at Racecourse Park and Seagrange Road, Baldoyle. There were for a short period two clubs, Baldoyle United and Grange United, which merged in 2015. A combined name, Baldoyle Grange United, was announced for the senior team but the remaining activity was continued as simple Baldoyle United. Since 2017 all teams play as Baldoyle United FC.

Baldoyle United has over 25 teams at schoolboy, schoolgirl and adult levels. In 2016 it won the FAI Community Club of the Year and also Fingal County Council&#x27;s Community Group of the Year.

===GAA===
Na Dubh Ghall are the local GAA club and have teams across all age groups catering for both girls and boys, and play at Racecourse Park.

===Badminton===
Baldoyle has a dedicated badminton centre on Grange Road, one of the two centres of Leinster Badminton, with eight courts. There is an active local club, Baldoyle District Badminton Club, based there, and it is also used substantially by several other clubs, including two from Raheny.

<doc id="1223629" wikidata="Q8000173" url="?curid=1223629" title="Wilbur Dartnell">
<text>William Thomas Dartnell, VC (6 April 1885 – 3 September 1915), also known as Wilbur Taylor Dartnell, was an Australian-born soldier, actor and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Born in Melbourne, he served in the Second Boer War as a teenager and later in the Bambatha Rebellion of 1906. He married, managed his own business and worked as a professional actor before immigrating to South Africa in 1912 or 1913.

Dartnell offered his services to the British Army on the outbreak of the First World War, and was commissioned into the 25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers in February 1915. He fought in the East African Campaign and was mentioned in despatches for the Battle of Bukoba, where he had stormed the German-held town hall, pulled down the German flag and replaced it with the Union Jack. On 3 September 1915, after his company had been ambushed and despite being wounded, Dartnell voluntarily stayed behind in an attempt to save the lives of wounded men as the remainder of the British force retired from the scene. Dartnell was killed in the attempt, but in recognition of his determination and sacrifice he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.

==Early life==
William Thomas Dartnell was born in the Melbourne suburb of Collingwood on 6 April 1885 to Henry Dartnell, an English-born fruiterer, and his Australian wife Rose Ann (née Hanley). He was brought up in Melbourne and, after leaving school, became an actor. In 1900, at the age of 15, Dartnell joined the Victorian Mounted Rifles, a part-time colonial militia unit. The regiment was mobilised as the 5th Victorian (Mounted Rifles) Contingent in early 1901 for service in the Second Boer War, and embarked for South Africa on 15 February. Arriving in Port Elizabeth the following month, Dartnell saw service in the Cape Colony and Orange Free State over the next twelve months and was wounded on 6 April—his 16th birthday. The Mounted Rifles returned to Australia in March 1902, and Dartnell was demobilised soon thereafter. He later returned to South Africa, and served as part of Royston&#x27;s Horse during the Bambatha Rebellion in Natal in 1906. For his service in these two campaigns Dartnell was issued the Queen&#x27;s South Africa Medal with &quot;Cape Colony&quot; and &quot;Orange Free State&quot; clasps, the King&#x27;s South Africa Medal with the clasps &quot;South Africa 1901&quot; and &quot;South Africa 1902&quot;, and the Natal Native Rebellion Medal with &quot;1906&quot; clasp.

After he returned to Australia, Dartnell married Elizabeth Edith Smyth on 15 April 1907 at Holt&#x27;s Matrimonial Agency on Queen Street, Melbourne. They settled in Fitzroy, and had a daughter in 1908. Little is known about Dartnell&#x27;s life over the next few years, though it is thought that he managed his own business and worked as an actor until 1912 or 1913, when he again departed for South Africa. Elizabeth and their daughter remained in Victoria, while Dartnell established himself in East London, a coastal city in the Cape Province. He found employment with the Standard Printing Company, and was a regular contributor to their Saturday newspaper, the &quot;Weekly Standard&quot;. During this period, he started using the name Wilbur Taylor Dartnell and, according to historian Gerald Gliddon, became engaged to another woman, a Mabel Evans.

==First World War==
After the outbreak of the First World War, Dartnell organised and chaired a meeting of Australians in East London who were willing to serve the British Empire. He cabled the War Office with a list of interested names (including his own), offered their services and requested passage to England in order to enlist. The request was evidently approved, as the group embarked for Britain in late September 1914. Using his assumed name, Dartnell joined the Legion of Frontiersmen and was subsequently commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the 25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers on 12 February 1915. As the &quot;Frontiersmen&quot; designation may suggest, the 25th Battalion &quot;included men of various ages and with strange experience from all quarters of the globe&quot;, according to the regimental history. The battalion had been specifically raised to operate from British East Africa against Germany&#x27;s neighbouring colonial possessions, and was reputedly the only British unit &quot;sent on active service during the war without preliminary training&quot;. The 25th embarked from Plymouth for Mombasa on 10 April, less than two months after it had been raised. Dartnell had spent the intervening time stationed in Swaythling, and had made a number of trips to Belgium ferrying drafts of artillery horses to the Western Front.

The 25th Battalion arrived in Mombasa on 4 May, and was immediately dispatched to Kajiado to defend the local section of the Uganda Railway from German raiding parties. Being a strategic rail line, it had been subject to frequent guerrilla-style attacks since the declaration of war. In June, Dartnell took part in the attack on the German fort and wireless station at Bukoba; the base for German raids on the Ugandan frontier. The assault party, numbering approximately 400, had had to sail across Lake Victoria and scale a &quot;cliff-like incline&quot; before they reached the outskirts of Bukoba to commence their attack on 21 June. The British and German forces wrested for control of the town for two days before the raiding party was able to seize the wireless station and town hall. In the final assault, Dartnell had been the first to enter the German-held town hall, and had hauled down the German flag to replace it with the Union Jack. Dartnell&#x27;s actions were later recognised with a mention in despatches. He was also reportedly recommended for the Distinguished Service Order for his performance in the battle, but this was not awarded. He was, however, promoted to temporary lieutenant on 25 July.

===Victoria Cross===

Shortly after the victory at Bukoba, the 25th Battalion moved to Voi where a military railway was being constructed for an allied advance into German East Africa. The battalion was employed in protection duties during this time, while two mounted infantry companies were formed in August by drawing upon the unit and the 2nd Battalion, Loyal North Lancashire Regiment to patrol the frontier around Maktau, to Voi&#x27;s east. Dartnell was assigned the command of a section within one of the companies.

On 3 September, word came through that a German raiding party was in the vicinity of Maktau. A counter force of 117 men was raised from Dartnell&#x27;s company with Captain John Woodruffe in command, and sent to intercept the German troops. The British force, however, was ambushed by a German party approximately 200 strong, which included a number of native Askari soldiers. Casualties were high, and the situation soon descended into chaos. Woodruffe, by this time badly wounded and concerned that his men were becoming surrounded, ordered that the wounded be quickly withdrawn so that the remainder of the force could retire. However, given the intensity of the firefight and the limited resources available, the grievously wounded could not be moved. Dartnell had been wounded in the leg and was being carried away to safety when he realised the situation. Fearing what the Askari would do to the British wounded, he demanded to remain and fight. Though twice instructed to leave, Dartnell refused and gave the order for his men to abandon him. Dartnell was last seen firing on the German troops, who were within of his position. When his body was recovered several hours later, it was surrounded by seven dead German soldiers.

==Legacy==

Dartnell&#x27;s determination and sacrifice during his last battle was posthumously recognised with the award of the Victoria Cross (VC). The announcement and accompanying citation for the medal was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 23 December 1915, reading:

Dartnell was one of four personnel to receive the VC in the East African Campaign. He and seven of the other British troops killed in the ambush were initially buried at Maktau Military Cemetery, but were later reinterred in the Commonwealth War Grave Cemetery at Voi. His military effects were sold off in October and the proceeds sent to his fiancée Mabel, whom Dartnell had named in his will. But the funds were later claimed by his widow. Elizabeth Dartnell received her husband&#x27;s VC from Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson, the Governor-General of Australia, in a private ceremony at Government House, Melbourne on 7 October 1916. Sir Arthur Stanley, the Governor of Victoria, and Sir Edmund Barton, a justice of the High Court and a former Prime Minister of Australia, were also in attendance. Elizabeth, who was living with her daughter in the Melbourne suburb of Murrumbeena at the time, later named her house &quot;Maktau&quot; after the place of her husband&#x27;s actions and death, and was later invited to the VC centenary celebrations in London in 1956.

Dartnell&#x27;s status as a professional actor was not forgotten. Several newspaper reports after his death postulated whether his VC was the first awarded to an actor, and he is commemorated on a plaque in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Dartnell Street in Canberra is also named for him, while the German flag he captured at Bukoba is in the collection of the Royal Fusiliers headquarters in London. In 1981 Dartnell&#x27;s VC and other medals were sold at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction to Spink &amp; Son for 24,000. The auction house held the medals for little more than two years before auctioning them off again in 1983 for A$36,000. The buyer donated the set to the Australian War Memorial, where they are displayed in the Hall of Valour.

<text>Danny Lyon (born March 16, 1942) is an American photographer and filmmaker.

All of Lyon&#x27;s publications work in the style of photographic New Journalism, meaning that the photographer has become immersed in, and is a participant of, the documented subject. He is the founding member of the publishing group &quot;Bleak Beauty.&quot;

After being accepted as the photographer for Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Lyon was present at almost all of the major historical events during the Civil Rights Movement.

He has had solo exhibits at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Menil Collection, the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco and the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona. Lyon twice received a Guggenheim Fellowship; a Rockefeller Fellowship, Missouri Honor Medal for Distinguished Service in Journalism; and a Lucie Award.

==Early life==
Lyon was born in 1942 in Brooklyn, New York and is the son of Russian-Jewish mother Rebecca Henkin and German-Jewish father Dr. Ernst Fredrick Lyon. He was raised in Kew Gardens, Queens, and went on to study history and philosophy at the University of Chicago, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1963.

== Civil rights work ==
Lyon began his involvement in the civil rights movement in 1962 when he hitch-hiked to Cairo, Illinois during a summer break after his junior year at the University of Chicago. He was inspired by a speech John Lewis had given at a church on his first day in Cairo. After his speech Lewis left to go attend a sit-in, Lyon was impressed by this, Lewis was putting action behind his words. Lyon then decided to march to a nearby segregated swimming pool, the demonstrators knelt down to pray as the pool-goers heckled them. Soon a truck came, it went through the crowd in an attempt to break it up, a young black girl was hit by the truck and Lyon knew that he wanted to be a part of the movement. For a time after this, in the 1960s, Lewis and Lyon were roommates.

In September 1962, with a $300 donation by Harry Belafonte, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) flew Lyon to Jackson and the Mississippi Delta to cover voter registration workers. Shortly after, Lyon had a run-in with the police, one of whom threatened to kill him because when told they “didn’t mix the races down here”, Lyon claimed he had a Black grandfather. Lyon left town in order to keep all the pictures he had taken safe from being confiscated.

In 1963 Lyon returned, but the SNCC was reluctant to bring him aboard as their photographer. One job Lyon participated in was getting a picture of some high-school girls who were in prison at the Leesburg Stockade without any charges against them. He hid in the back of a car while someone else drove him to the prison, and the young man who drove distracted the guards while Lyon snuck in the back to get the photo.

After being accepted as the photographer for SNCC, Lyon was present at almost all of the major historical events during the movement capturing the moments with his camera.

His pictures appeared in &quot;The Movement: documentary of a struggle for equality&quot;, a documentary book about the Civil Rights Movement in the southern region of the United States.

==Later work==
Later, Lyon began creating his own books. His first was a study of outlaw motorcyclists in the collection &quot;The Bikeriders&quot; (1968), where Lyon photographed, traveled with and shared the lifestyle of bikers in the American Midwest from 1963 to 1967. Living in a rented apartment in Woodlawn, Chicago, Lyon followed the Chicago chapter of the Outlaws Motorcycle Club in an &quot;attempt to record and glorify the life of the American bikerider&quot;. Seeking advice from Hunter S. Thompson, who spent a year with the Hells Angels for his own book, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs&quot;, Thompson warned Lyon that he should &quot;get the hell out of that club unless it&#x27;s absolutely necessary for photo action.&quot; Lyon said of Thompson&#x27;s response: &quot;He advised me not to join the Outlaws and to wear a helmet. I joined the club and seldom wore a helmet&quot;. He was a full-fledged member of the Outlaws between 1966 and 1967. On his time as an Outlaws member, Lyon said: &quot;I was kind of horrified by the end. I remember I had a big disagreement with this guy who rolled out a huge Nazi flag as a picnic rug to put our beers on. By then I had realised that some of these guys were not so romantic after all&quot;.

The series was immensely popular and influential in the 1960s and 1970s. By 1967, Lyon was invited to join Magnum Photos. After &quot;The Bikeriders&quot;, he spent time documenting the lives of inmates in Texas prisons. During the 1970s, Lyon also contributed to the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s DOCUMERICA project.

In 1969, when Lyon returned from his work in Texas to New York City, and had no place to live, the photographer Robert Frank, famous by then for his 1958 book &quot;The Americans&quot;, took him in. Lyon had met Frank two years earlier, at the end of a Happening that Lyon was part of, in New York City. Lyon lived with the Frank family for six months in the city, in an apartment on West 86th St.

&quot;The Destruction of Lower Manhattan&quot; (1969) was Lyon&#x27;s next work, published by Macmillan Publishers in 1969. The book documents the large-scale demolition taking place throughout Lower Manhattan in 1967. Included are photographs of soon to be demolished streets and buildings, portraits of the neighborhood&#x27;s last remaining stragglers and pictures from within the demolition sites themselves. The book was eventually remaindered for one dollar each, but soon attained the status of a collector&#x27;s item. It was reprinted in 2005.

&quot;Conversations with the Dead&quot; (1971) was published with full cooperation of the Texas Department of Corrections. Lyon photographed in six prisons over a 14-month period in 1967–68. The series was printed in book form in 1971 by Holt publishing. The introduction points to a statement of purpose that the penal system of Texas is symbolic for incarceration everywhere. He states, &quot;I tried with whatever power I had to make a picture of imprisonment as distressing as I knew it to be in reality.&quot;

Lyon befriended many of the prisoners. The book also includes texts taken from prison records, letters from convicts, and inmate artwork. In particular, the book focuses on the case of Billy McCune, a convicted rapist whose death sentence was eventually commuted to life in prison. In the foreword, Lyon describes McCune as a diagnosed psychotic, who one evening, while awaiting execution, &quot;cut his penis off to the root and, placing it in a cup, passed it between the bars to the guard.&quot;

All of Lyon&#x27;s publications work in the style of photographic New Journalism, meaning that the photographer has become immersed, and is a participant, of the documented subject.

He is the founding member of the publishing group &quot;Bleak Beauty.&quot; He was greatly encouraged in his photography by curator of the Art Institute of Chicago Hugh Edwards, who gave Lyon two solo exhibits as a young man.

Also a filmmaker and writer, Lyon&#x27;s films and videos include &quot;Los Niños Abandonados&quot;, &quot;Born to Film&quot;, &quot;Willie&quot;, and &quot;Murderers&quot;. He has published the non-fiction book &quot;Like A Thief&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

<doc id="1223640" wikidata="Q477914" url="?curid=1223640" title="Thomas Swann">
<text>Thomas Swann (February 3, 1809 – July 24, 1883) was an American lawyer and politician who also was President of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as it completed track to Wheeling and gained access to the Ohio River Valley. Initially a Know-Nothing, and later a Democrat, Swann served as the 19th Mayor of Baltimore (1856–1860), later as the 33rd Governor of Maryland (1866–1869), and subsequently as U.S. Representative (&quot;Congressman&quot;) from Maryland&#x27;s 3rd congressional district and then 4th congressional district (1869–1879), representing the Baltimore area.

==Early life and career==
Swann was born in Alexandria, Virginia, the fourth son born by the former Jane Byrd Page, a member of one of the First Families of Virginia. His mother died three years later after a difficult childbirth. His attorney father, Thomas Swann, had served in the Virginia House of Delegates and with political connections to William Wirt and other Virginia lawyers in the national government, would become United States Attorney for the District of Columbia during this man&#x27;s childhood. Although two of his brothers died between 1825 and 1829, Swann&#x27;s elder brother Wilson Cary Swann (1806-1876) was educated with him and later rose to prominence as a physician, philanthropist, and social reformer in Philadelphia.

The Swann brothers attended Columbian College (now George Washington University) in Washington, D.C., then the University of Virginia at Charlottesville. Thomas Jr. studied Ancient and modern languages and mathematics, but was also disciplined for disorderly conduct in 1825 and questioned in a gambling scandal the following year, which may have led him to enroll in a class in moral philosophy from prominent Virginia lawyer George Tucker. He also studied law under his father&#x27;s guidance.

==Career==

A Democrat, in 1833 and possibly through his father&#x27;s connections, Swann secured an appointment from President Andrew Jackson as secretary of the United States Commission to Naples (Kingdom of the Two Sicilies - later Italy). Also admitted to the Virginia bar, he began following his father&#x27;s career path by winning election to the Alexandria City council in 1833.

In 1834, Swann married an heiress and moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where his father&#x27;s lawyer friend William Wirt had settled, and where Swann later became a railroad lawyer. His bride&#x27;s British born father, John Sherlock, left a sizeable estate which included interests in French and Neopolitan spoliation claims, as well as 6000 acres of Pennsylvania land, 150 ounces of silver plate, 300 bottles of madeira, plus stock in the Bank of the United States, three Baltimore banks, two turnpikes, a canal in York, Pennsylvania and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (which had been incorporated in 1827 and in completed track to Harper&#x27;s Ferry by 1834). His wife&#x27;s uncle, Robert Gilmor, secured them entry into Baltimore society, although his father experienced financial difficulties after the Panic of 1836 so young Thomas bought 600 to 700 acres of land and the Morven Park plantation home from his father, noting that his father&#x27;s nemesis Nicholas Biddle likewise was forced to sell property to his sons after the panic. In 1840 the elder Thomas Swann died and this man inherited Morven Park, sixty slaves and his father&#x27;s law library, and over the next years gradually purchased the rest of what had been his father&#x27;s land. Meanwhile, this Thomas Swann and his family lived on Franklin Street in Baltimore, and used his late father&#x27;s Virginia property Morven Park as their summer retreat.
Swann returned to Alexandria after his father&#x27;s death in 1840, but also continued as a railroad lawyer. Between 1837 and 1843 he was the assistant to Louis McLane, a veteran politician who served as the railroad&#x27;s president. In 1844 Swann became Alexandria&#x27; tobacco inspector, an important responsibility in that port city which also had railroad ties both to Richmond, and (via a separate station) to Baltimore. In 1846-1847, Swann was the B&amp;O&#x27;s lobbyist in Richmond, for the franchise the railroad had secured in 1827 was expiring, and its extension through western Virginia was opposed by the powerful political interests of the James River and Kanawha Canal Company. Swann secured the extension on March 6, 1847, the railroad began building to Wheeling, and by October 1848, Swann&#x27;s large stockholdings in and services to the B&amp;O led to his election as a director, and when McLane retired, he succeeded him as the railroad&#x27;s president. bY 1850, Swann raised funds in Europe to enable the B&amp;O&#x27;s extension to the Ohio River, continuing in that position until resigning in 1853. He was chosen as president of the Northwestern Virginia Railroad.

==Mayor of Baltimore==

===1856 election===

Swann was first elected Mayor of Baltimore in 1856 as a member of the &quot;Know Nothing&quot; movement (also known as the &quot;American Party&quot;) in one of the bloodiest and corrupt elections in state history. He supposedly defeated Democratic challenger Robert Clinton Wright by over a thousand votes.

Many believed that once slavery was abolished in Maryland, African Americans would begin a mass emigration to a new state. As white soldiers returned from Southern battlefields, they came home to find that not only were their slaves gone, but soil exhaustion was causing tobacco crops in southern Maryland to fail. With a growing number of disaffected white men, Swann embarked on a campaign of &quot;Redemption&quot; and &quot;restoring to Maryland a white man&#x27;s government&quot;.

Additionally, Swann enacted a law that encouraged white fisherman to harass black fisherman when he signed into law the state&#x27;s first ever &quot;Oyster Code&quot;:
&quot;And be it acted, that all owners and masters of canoes, boats, or vessels licensed under this article, being White Men, are hereby constituted officers of this state for the purpose of arresting and taking before any judge or Justice of the Peace, any persons who may be engaged in violating any provisions of this article. Furthermore, all such owners and masters are hereby vested with the power to summon posse comitatus to aid in such arrest.&quot;

Although Maryland was still a &quot;slave state&quot; at the time, the Emancipation Proclamation did not apply to it, because it was a non-Confederate state, having officially remained in the Union; President Lincoln feared that ending slavery there at the height of the Civil War would cause Maryland to leave the Union. Hence, ending slavery there required a state-level referendum. When slavery there was abolished with the adoption of the third Maryland Constitution of 1864, Lincoln&#x27;s fears were not realized; the war finished without Maryland ever defecting to the Confederacy, although many men from southern Maryland counties and the &quot;Eastern Shore&quot; did fight on the side of the Confederacy.

During the mid-1850s, public order in Baltimore City had often been threatened by the election of candidates of the &quot;Know Nothing&quot; movement which became known as the &quot;American Party&quot;. In October 1856 the &quot;Know Nothing&quot; previous incumbent Mayor Samuel Hinks was pressed by Baltimoreans to order the Maryland State Militia in readiness to maintain order during the mayoral and municipal elections, as violence was anticipated. Hinks duly gave State Militia general George H. Steuart the order, but he soon rescinded it. As a result, violence broke out on polling day, with shots exchanged by competing mobs. In the 2nd and 8th Wards several citizens were killed, and many wounded. In the 6th ward artillery was used, and a pitched battle fought on Orleans Street in East Baltimore/Jonestown/Old Town neighborhoods between &quot;Know Nothings&quot; and rival Democrats, raging for several hours. The result of the election, in which voter fraud was widespread, was a victory for Swann by around 9,000 votes.

===1857 election===
In 1857, fearing similar violence at the upcoming elections, Governor Thomas W. Ligon ordered commanding General George H. Steuart of the Maryland State Militia to hold the First Light Division, Maryland Volunteers in readiness. Swann&#x27;s ally, Know-Nothing Congressman Henry Winter Davis, criticized Ligon&#x27;s action both for subverting local authority and as an attempt to swing the election to the Democrats. Mayor Swann, this time running for re-election, successfully argued for a compromise measure involving special police forces to prevent disorder, and Steuart&#x27;s militia were stood down. This time, although there was less violence than in 1856, the results of the vote were again compromised, and the &quot;Know-Nothings&quot; took many state offices in the heavily disputed balloting.

===1858 election===
He was re-elected in 1858, again with widespread violence prevalent, and won by over 19,000 votes due to a large amount of voter intimidation.

There were a great deal of internal improvements and urban modernizations during Swann&#x27;s tenure as mayor. The long-time colonial-era various in-fighting problems and competitive volunteer independent firefighting companies since 1763 (under a loose confederation of the &quot;Baltimore City United Fire Department&quot; of 1835) were replaced in 1858 with paid professional firefighters with the organization of the modern current Baltimore City Fire Department, and were given steam-powered fire engines and a better emergency telegraph alarm system. His office also oversaw the creation of the horse-drawn streetcar system in Baltimore replacing the older omnibuses, the purchase from the Col. Nicholas Rogers estate and creation of the large tract for Druid Hill Park in 1860, overlooking the west banks of the Jones Falls. Following the municipal purchase of the former private Baltimore Water Company, (since 1804), saw the replacement of its old wooden pipes and aging inadequate infrastructure with the beginnings of two water-sewage construction projects along the upper Jones Falls. Following was the major public works project of the construction of the dam at the new Lake Roland Reservoir along with the organization of a new city water board and extension of new waterworks service into new outlying areas of the growing metropolis. The &quot;Basin&quot; (Baltimore Inner Harbor) was dredged at 20 feet depth during his term as governor, and several new schools were added to the city. The former constables and &quot;City Night Watch&quot; system from 1784 were replaced by a newly organized Baltimore City Police Department under then modern principles was established and given new uniforms, weapons and training (later placed under supervision and appointment powers of the governor in 1860 to the 1990s). To provide better street lighting, the offices of Superindendents of Lamps with the then existing gas system was created.

Violence was greatly prevalent during Swann&#x27;s term as mayor, especially during election campaigns. Then Maryland Governor Thomas W. Ligon sought Swann&#x27;s assistance to try to avoid &quot;Know Nothing&quot; riots during the 1856 Presidential elections, but little was resolved during the meeting, and continued riots ensued during the night of the election wounding and killing many. Ligon criticized Swann for not taking the necessary precautions, recalling the event as partisans &quot;engaged; arms of all kinds were employed; and bloodshed, wounds, and death, stained the record of the day, and added another page of dishonor to the annals of the distracted city&quot;. This continued to contribute to Baltimore&#x27;s oft-stated ignoble reputation and nickname of &quot;Mobtown&quot;, acquired since the anti-war riots of 1812. Gov. Ligon did not cooperate with Mayor Swann during the state elections of 1857, and immediately imposed martial law upon Baltimore City before election day had begun. Swann was angered, and insisted this was not necessary, but, recalling the events one year earlier, Ligon refused to lift the martial law status.

==Governor of Maryland==
In 1861, Swann left the American Party, which dissolved, and joined the wartime Union Party. In 1864, he was unanimously nominated as the 33rd Governor of Maryland during its nomination convention. He won election with lieutenant-governor running mate Christopher C. Cox by over 9,000 votes. The only governor elected under the Maryland Constitution of 1864, Swann took the oath of office on January 11, 1865, but did not enter into the duties of the office until one year later (under that constitution, the governor chosen in the November 1864 election could not assume the office until the completion of the term of his predecessor, Augustus W. Bradford, in January 1866); he served until January 1869. In his inaugural address, he encouraged reunion in the State following the American Civil War, and voiced his opposition to slavery, deeming it &quot;a stumbling block in the way of [our] advancement&quot;.

Radical Republicans of Maryland criticized Swann for supporting the Reconstruction policies of Democratic and 17th President Andrew Johnson, and refusing to adopt their proposals. He eventually parted with the Republicans and joined the Democratic Party during his term as governor. He had strongly opposed requiring the &quot;ironclad&quot; loyalty oath and registration laws promoted by the Radical Republicans for former Confederates in the state.

In 1867, the General Assembly of Maryland nominated Swann to succeed John A. J. Creswell to the United States Senate. But, Radical Republicans had gained control of the Congress in 1867, and refused to allow Swann admission to the Senate because he had switched parties. The Democrats in Maryland began to fear that, if Swann left, the Maryland lieutenant governor, a Radical Republican, might place Maryland under a military, Reconstruction government and temporarily disfranchise whites who had served in the Confederacy. Also, they did not want to lose reforms made by Swann with other voting rights. Rather than fight the Radicals in Congress to gain a seat, Swann was convinced by Democrats to remain as governor and turn down the Senate seat.

Swann supported internal improvements to state infrastructure, especially after the war, and he is credited with greatly improving the facilities at the Baltimore Port and Harbor. He also encouraged immigration, and the immediate emancipation of slaves following the War. By 1860, 49% of blacks in Maryland were already free, giving them a substantial position and economic strength in the years following the war.

==U.S. Congressional career and final years==
In 1868, Swann was elected to Congress from Maryland&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, gaining re-election and serving until 1873. With redistricting changes, he was elected in 1873 from Maryland&#x27;s 4th congressional district, serving three terms until 1879. In the United States Congress, Swann was chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth Congresses).

==Personal life==
Swann married twice. In 1843, his first wife, the former Elizabeth Gilmer Sherlock (1814-1876), bore a daughter, Elizabeth Gilmer Swann, who was their only child to reach adulthood. In 1878, the widower married Josephine Ward Thomson, daughter of Representative (&quot;Congressman&quot;) Aaron Ward and widow of U.S. Senator John Renshaw Thomson, but they had no children.

==Death and legacy==
Swann died on his estate, &quot;Morven Park&quot;, near Leesburg, Virginia. He is interred in the landmark Green Mount Cemetery (southeast of Maryland Route 45 and East North Avenue) of Baltimore. In eulogy, the influential &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper of Baltimore criticized his early political errors, but credited him as &quot;a great mayor, conferring inestimable benefits on the city he governed; not only was he a wise and beneficent governor to the oppressed portion of the citizens of the State, but he was one of the most useful and influential Congressmen this State or city ever had.&quot; Some of his family&#x27;s papers are held by the University of Maryland library.

Swann Park, off of South Hanover Street (Maryland Route 2) in the South Baltimore/Spring Gardens area, adjacent to the eastern waterfront of Middle Branch (Smith and Ridgley&#x27;s Coves) of the Patapsco River is named for him and also serves as an occasional athletic home for the former Southern High School (now Digital Harbor High School). Nearby are large monumental gas storage tanks for the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company.

In Virginia, both his childhood home, now called the &quot;Swann-Daingerfield House&quot; and Morven Park still exist (although expanded by later owners) and have been listed on the National Register for Historic Places since the 1970s. In addition, Alexandria named &quot;Swann Avenue&quot; near the former Potomac Railroad Yards, after him or the family.

It is assumed that Swann Street in Northwest Washington DC was originally named after Thomas Swann. However, in 2022, the Dupont Circle Advisory Neighborhood Commission approved a resolution declaring that Swann Street is named after William Dorsey Swann, one of the first known LGBT activists.

<text>This article lists [[political party|political parties]] in [[Bermuda]].

Bermuda has a three-party system, which means that there are three political parties: the Progressive Labour Party (PLP), the One Bermuda Alliance (OBA) and the Free Democratic Movement. From 1968 — Bermuda&#x27;s first party-based election — to 1998, the United Bermuda Party (UBP) controlled Parliament. In 1998, it was supplanted by the slightly older PLP. Most UBP members merged with a breakaway party called the Bermuda Democratic Alliance in 2011 to form the OBA. The PLP and OBA currently hold all of the seats in the House of Assembly and were the only two parties with offices and organizations before September 1, 2020.

Another party, the Bermuda Democratic Party, contested the 1968 election but failed to win any seats and collapsed soon after, eventually to be replaced by the now-defunct National Liberal Party. In addition, several candidates have run as independents, to varying success, or have formed temporary, one-man parties such as the Gombey Liberation Party (or, in its later days, the National Liberal Party).

==The parties==

<doc id="1223646" wikidata="Q1409858" url="?curid=1223646" title="The Stig">
<text>The Stig is a character from the British motoring television show &quot;Top Gear&quot;. Created by former &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenter Jeremy Clarkson and producer Andy Wilman, the character is a play on the anonymity of racing drivers&#x27; full-face helmets, with the running joke that nobody knows who or what is inside the Stig&#x27;s racing suit. The Stig&#x27;s primary role is setting lap times for cars tested on the show. Previously, he would also instruct celebrity guests, off-camera, for the show&#x27;s &quot;Star in a Reasonably Priced Car&quot; segment.

The identity of the original &quot;Black&quot; Stig, Perry McCarthy, was exposed by a Sunday newspaper in January 2003, and confirmed by McCarthy later that year. The black-suited Stig was subsequently &quot;killed off&quot; that October in the series 3 premiere, and replaced in the following episode by a new White Stig who lasted through to the end of series 15.

In series 13 episode 1, the show jokingly unmasked the Stig as seven-time world champion F1 driver Michael Schumacher. In the hiatus following series 15, racing driver Ben Collins was revealed to be the Stig in a court battle over Collins&#x27; impending autobiography, titled &quot;The Man in the White Suit&quot;. In series 16, debuting in December 2010, Collins was replaced by a second White Stig, whose identity was revealed by Clarkson in 2024 to be racing driver Phil Keen.

==Creation and name==
The idea for the character was part of former host Jeremy Clarkson and former producer Andy Wilman&#x27;s concept for the relaunched &quot;Top Gear&quot; show, bringing a new format to the original version of &quot;Top Gear&quot; which ceased production in 2001. The relaunched show introduced a live studio audience, the Stig, a racetrack, and madcap stunts. Clarkson is credited with having come up with the original idea for the Stig.

Clarkson and Wilman wanted to have a professional racing driver as part of the show&#x27;s cast, but ran into difficulty finding a driver sufficiently adept at speaking on-camera. Clarkson then asked Wilman why the driver needed to speak at all, and they decided that the Stig&#x27;s role would be silent.

The name Stig derives from Wilman and Clarkson&#x27;s time at Repton School, where new boys had always been called &quot;Stig&quot;. &quot;Stig&quot; is a pejorative referring to someone from a poor background with a poor dress sense (originating from the eponymous character in the children&#x27;s book &quot;Stig of the Dump&quot;). Another theory is that the driver was just &quot;the guy in the suit&quot; (GITS) – which, when written in reverse, becomes &quot;Stig&quot; – although this may just be a fan-created backronym.

According to the original Stig, Perry McCarthy, speaking in 2006, the producers had first wanted the anonymous driver to be called &quot;The Gimp&quot;, referring to the use of gimp suits in BDSM sexual role-playing. After McCarthy objected, they settled upon the name Stig. McCarthy had said of the idea at the time that &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be forever remembered as the Gimp&quot;.

==Characteristics==
===Anonymity and silence===
When introducing the Stig in the &quot;Top Gear&quot; premiere, Clarkson said, &quot;We don&#x27;t know its name, we really don&#x27;t know its name, nobody knows its name, and we don&#x27;t want to know, because it&#x27;s a racing driver.&quot;

According to a 2006 article in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, most of the &quot;Top Gear&quot; crew did not know the Stig&#x27;s identity; one camera assistant reportedly observed the Stig eating his lunch in the back of an ambulance to avoid being spotted. In 2009, another &quot;Times&quot; article reiterated that only a few production staff, the show&#x27;s presenters and other BBC journalists knew the Stig&#x27;s true identity.

Former Stig Perry McCarthy described in 2009 how, to maintain his anonymity, he would put on the Stig&#x27;s helmet while going through the &quot;Top Gear&quot; security gates, and then change into his racing overalls in a special room behind the gatehouse before driving into the studio areas. He would speak as little as possible in the backstage areas, and put on an accent which some mistook as French. McCarthy also explained that hiding his identity while coaching the celebrities for &quot;Star in a Reasonably Priced Car&quot; proved difficult. He said that he did reveal his true identity while coaching Ross Kemp and David Soul, as he had previously known them and they promised that they would be silent about his role. For other drives, if celebrities asked if he was a particular person, he would just say &quot;How did you know?&quot;, adding that more often than not, the suggestion was Michael Schumacher.

The Stig is never shown talking on screen, although he does talk with celebrities off-camera while training them to drive around the track. Clarkson has joked that he is &quot;not a very talkative chap&quot;. When asked about his identity in a rare spoken interview for the show &quot;Veronica Vibes&quot; of a Dutch channel, the Stig reportedly said, &quot;I don&#x27;t remember; my memory was erased when I got the job.&quot; The Stig&#x27;s muteness has extended to appearances in other media, such as the &quot;Brain Stig&quot; video released by the BBC on YouTube in 2009.

Clarkson has written in his newspaper column that the Stig is not permitted to talk or comment on the cars he is given to drive because &quot;the opinions of all racing drivers are completely worthless,&quot; going on to explain that, because of their familiarity with cars equipped for track racing, racing drivers believe any and all road cars are on low-scale compared to racing cars.

===Driving ability===
The show has often compared the Stig&#x27;s driving ability to others, particularly Formula One drivers. When Jeremy Clarkson said that the Stig believed that the Suzuki Liana, the show&#x27;s Reasonably Priced Car at the time, could do a lap time of 1:44.0, former F1 driver Nigel Mansell, appearing as a guest on the programme, duly obliged by posting a time of 1:44.6; the Stig then posted a time of 1:44.4. After Rubens Barrichello became the first person to beat the Stig&#x27;s time (coming in at 1:44.3), the show repeatedly referred to a jealous rivalry between the Stig and Barrichello. Sebastian Vettel then further beat this time by posting a time of 1:44.0. A while later, Lewis Hamilton did a second lap and got a 1:42.9. Clarkson has often mentioned that F1 drivers seem to take a different racing line on the test track than the Stig, such as on Jenson Button&#x27;s drive; however, during Barrichello&#x27;s and Lewis Hamilton&#x27;s visits to the show, Clarkson observed that they took the same line around the track as The Stig. F1 driver Mark Webber&#x27;s appearance on the show was marked at the conclusion of his lap with Clarkson presenting him with an &quot;I AM THE STIG&quot; T-shirt.

===Introductions===
The Stig&#x27;s introductions on the show have underlined his oddness. Initially the presenters heralded his appearance with simple humorous introductions, such as &quot;His Holiness, the Stig!&quot; Beginning in series 6, the introductions began to follow a format of, &quot;Some say that [two bizarre characteristics]. All we know is, he&#x27;s called the Stig.&quot; Characteristics described in this format include:

Some introductions have referred to current events and stories in popular culture, such as:

* &quot;If he had worked for CNN, he wouldn&#x27;t have got such pitifully low ratings that his show got cancelled&quot; (a reference to the cancellation of &quot;Piers Morgan Live&quot;)
* &quot;While we were off air, his iCloud was hacked and now everyone in the world has seen his helmet&quot; (a reference to the 2014 celebrity photo hack)
* &quot;Last week, he was found in a locked room, tied to a chair with German piano wire&quot; (the week after Michael Schumacher was &quot;revealed&quot; as The Stig)
* &quot;He once punched a horse to the ground&quot; (a reference to the story of Roberto Durán having done so)

===Other characteristics===
In the Stig&#x27;s debut, he was described by Clarkson as having a very small brain, worthless opinions, and a disorder called &quot;Mansell Syndrome&quot;. Richard Porter, Top Gear&#x27;s script editor, described the Stig as &quot;single minded, stubborn and hilariously petulant; specifically, a mix of Kimi Räikkönen, the keyboard player from Pet Shop Boys, and a 15-year-old boy forced to go on holiday with his parents.&quot; He has been depicted as a piece of cargo, being collected by Clarkson from the baggage conveyor at the airport; he has also been shown stored in a cupboard when not in use.

It has been said that the Stig &quot;has no understanding of money&quot; and during challenges he has been shown using an Oyster card to access London public transportation, and a credit card in the name of &quot;The Stig&quot; issued by the &quot;Bank of Money&quot; to obtain petrol. The show has also featured the Stig&#x27;s listening habits, as heard on the car stereo as he drives laps. Often a specific genre is chosen for one or more series. The Stig has been shown listening to:

In 2008, the Stig appeared at the National Television Awards, where he silently accepted an award and handed award presenter Griff Rhys Jones a letter from the &quot;Top Gear&quot; hosts, which instructed Jones to give the Stig the award in his left hand, as his right one is magnetic, and cautioning organisers that he wasn&#x27;t to be seated near the cast of &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, as &quot;he&#x27;s decided all northerners are edible&quot;.

==Role==
In the &quot;Top Gear&quot; end credits, the Stig is credited alongside Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May as a presenter. The Stig&#x27;s primary role on the show is at the &quot;Top Gear&quot; test track at the show&#x27;s base at Dunsfold Aerodrome, Surrey. His two main functions are to post lap times for featured performance cars in the &quot;Power Laps&quot; segment, and to train celebrity guests to set lap times in the &quot;Star in a Reasonably Priced Car&quot; segment, although Chris Harris later took on the instructional role.

The &quot;Top Gear&quot; website describes the Stig&#x27;s test-driving role as follows:

When first introduced, the Stig was described as the resident test driver, as the presenters could not consistently post fast times themselves. His stated mission was to &quot;just go out there and drive fast&quot;. The original Stig, Perry McCarthy, described in 2006 how a racing driver was intended to be used as part of the presenting team in order to produce definitive fastest lap times for tested cars.

==Identity==
* Perry McCarthy – (2002–2003)
* Ben Collins – (2003–2010)
* Phil Keen – (2010–2022)

===Black Stig===

Racing driver Perry McCarthy appeared in 22 &quot;Top Gear&quot; episodes as the black-suited, original Stig.

McCarthy was cast as the Stig following a chance meeting with Jeremy Clarkson at the 2002 launch party for McCarthy&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Flat Out, Flat Broke: Formula 1 the Hard Way!&quot;. This led to an audition as a regular presenter, before the production team decided the racing driver would be anonymous. (Contradicting this, McCarthy said in 2008 that Clarkson had mentioned the idea of a &quot;top secret&quot; racing driver at their first meeting.)

After the first series ended, an article in &quot;The Sunday Mirror&quot; on 12 January 2003 named McCarthy as the Stig. The newspaper quoted a show insider as saying, &quot;Just a handful of the crew know that he is actually Perry.&quot; McCarthy responded at the time, &quot;I do know who the Stig is but I cannot comment any further.&quot; After the second series ended, McCarthy published the second edition of his autobiography, in which he confirmed that he was the Stig. McCarthy was then &quot;killed off&quot; in the first episode of the third series.

The scene which saw Black Stig &quot;killed off,&quot; nicknamed &quot;Top Gun vs Top Gear,&quot; was an attempt to race to and then come to a halt on the long flight deck of HMS &quot;Invincible&quot;, a Royal Navy aircraft carrier on which British Aerospace Sea Harrier jump jets reach before take-off. He would be using the &quot;old Top Gear Jag,&quot; a white Jaguar XJS bought for a &quot;couple of hundred quid,&quot; stripped of its fittings and fitted with nitrous injection to take it to . The Stig accelerated along the deck, and an on-screen speedometer indicated before a cutaway shot saw the car flying off the end of the runway ramp and into the sea. Clarkson then revealed in the last scene of the episode that a glove floating on the sea was all that divers had found. According to McCarthy, &quot;We tried to make it as much like a scene out of James Bond as possible.&quot;

The explanations for McCarthy&#x27;s exit vary. While McCarthy described the parting as amiable in 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; claimed in 2009 that he had fallen out with producers. In 2010, McCarthy said he had become tired of the job, which he claimed paid £700 a week, and that part of his annoyance stemmed from an attempt by a car owner to sue him for ruining his car and the BBC&#x27;s refusal to defend him due to his anonymity. He said the BBC chose not to renew his contract and had him written out of the show.

Although McCarthy said in 2006 that, following his exit from &quot;Top Gear,&quot; he harboured ambitions of re-entering racing in the Grand Prix Masters series, he went on to run an investment company and appear as an after-dinner speaker.

According to the &quot;Sunday Times,&quot; writing in 2009, McCarthy revealed in his book that there had always been more than one Stig, and that then 47-year-old Julian Bailey, a former Formula One driver, had acted as a stand-in for McCarthy.

===First White Stig===

The first White Stig was introduced in November 2003, following the Black Stig&#x27;s exit in the prior episode. His identity remained secret until it was revealed as Ben Collins in August 2010. During this Stig&#x27;s time on the show, the character&#x27;s role expanded from Power Lap times and &quot;Reasonably Priced Car&quot; training to include appearances in other show segments, such as producing timed runs in the Isle of Man road test; driving a Caterham Seven from Caterham to Knockhill; riding a London Bus, the DLR and the Tube across London; jumping a snowmobile off a ski-jump in Lillehammer, Norway; and playing a police pursuit driver in the White Van Man challenge.

====Speculation====
After the White Stig&#x27;s debut, there was widespread speculation over his identity. Various sources claimed him to be a number of different racing drivers, including Collins, Damon Hill, Julian Bailey, Russ Swift, Darren Turner and Tim Schrick, as well as former &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenter Tiff Needell. Several people, including Hill and musician Jay Kay, claimed to be the Stig themselves. It was also speculated that the Stig was played by multiple drivers, a theory hinted at by original Stig Perry McCarthy. After observing the Stig&#x27;s charity drive around the Silverstone Circuit just before the July 2008 British Grand Prix, former Formula One World Champion Fernando Alonso remarked, &quot;Whoever&#x27;s in that car is a seriously good driver. ... I&#x27;ve no idea who he is, but he&#x27;s definitely ex-F1.&quot;

In January 2009, rumours about the Stig&#x27;s identity were stoked, in part by a &quot;News of the World&quot; article alleging to have discovered the Stig to be a married man in his 30s, living in a £300,000 home and driving a £15,000 car, on an income of around £150,000 from his &quot;Top Gear&quot; job and some stunt and test driving. In the same month, an art gallery owner reported that the Stig had revealed his identity to the gallery owner and his son, after contracting with them (under the guise of a BBC executive) for a series of signed and limited prints of the Stig. In the latter instance, the Stig was alleged to be Ben Collins. It was also reported that a builder doing work at Collins&#x27; home had found the Stig&#x27;s trademark suit and gloves on display there.

As these rumours were ongoing, the &quot;Top Gear&quot; blog published three entries on 21 January revealing the Stig to be, respectively, Damon Hill&#x27;s deceased father Graham Hill; Royal Bank of Scotland chairman Sir Tom McKillop; and newly inaugurated U.S. president Barack Obama.

When Richard Hammond crashed a jet-powered car, the accident report into the crash described Ben Collins as someone &quot;who worked closely with Top Gear as a high performance driver and consultant.&quot;

====Michael Schumacher====
On 20 June 2009, Clarkson announced in his newspaper column that the Stig would show his face in &quot;Top Gear&quot;&#x27;s series thirteen premiere, airing the next day. According to Clarkson, the Stig was &quot;fed up with newspapers speculating that he&#x27;s a photocopier salesman from Bolton, or lives in a pebble-dashed house in Bristol.&quot;

The episode showed the Stig driving a black Ferrari FXX around the test track for a record-setting time of 1:10.7, before walking into the studio and sitting down. As the audience shouted &quot;Off! Off!&quot; the Stig removed his helmet to reveal himself as seven-time world champion F1 driver Michael Schumacher. In the subsequent interview, Schumacher exhibited some of the Stig&#x27;s supposedly defining character traits, such as knowing only two facts about ducks (both &quot;facts&quot; being wrong).

Following the revelation, the Stig alleged to be Schumacher was shown driving the Suzuki Liana but did not set a lap time; instead, video clips showed the Stig exhibiting very poor car control, striking a camera tripod, and eventually getting lost. Clarkson closed the segment by observing that possibly, Schumacher was not truly the Stig after all. While the BBC initially would not confirm whether Schumacher&#x27;s revelation was a stunt, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported the next day that a &quot;Top Gear&quot; spokesman confirmed Schumacher had played the Stig, due to Ferrari only allowing Schumacher to drive the FXX, but that &quot;the identity of the driver at other times would remain &#x27;a mystery&#x27;.&quot;

====&quot;The Man in the White Suit&quot;====

On 19 August 2010, it was reported that a legal dispute was developing between the BBC and publishers representing the Stig, over plans by the Stig to release an autobiography revealing his identity. A BBC spokesman said, &quot;The BBC is in a legal dispute over the publication of a book relating to &quot;Top Gear&quot; as this breaches agreed contractual and confidentiality obligations relating to the show.&quot; The Stig was reportedly unhappy that he had been unable to profit from his &quot;Top Gear&quot; role to the same degree as the other presenters.

Around the same time, the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; claimed that financial documents for Ben Collins&#x27; company, Collins Autosport, provided evidence that he was the Stig. The &quot;Times&quot; stated that beginning a month after the White Stig&#x27;s first appearance, the company had experienced an increase in profits ascribed to &quot;driving services provided for the BBC, mainly in the &quot;Top Gear&quot; programme.&quot; Collins did not comment on this story; the BBC said it was &quot;no surprise&quot; as Collins had appeared several times on the show as well as provided other services.

On 23 August 2010, the BBC and the Stig&#x27;s publisher, HarperCollins, appeared in court. HarperCollins confirmed that it was being sued by the BBC over the autobiography&#x27;s publication, stating, &quot;We are disappointed that the BBC has chosen to spend licence fee payers&#x27; money to suppress this book and will vigorously defend the perfectly legitimate right of this individual to tell his story.&quot; The BBC said, &quot;This situation has come about as a result of an attempt by an external party to profit from unauthorised use of the &quot;Top Gear&quot; brand, one of the BBC&#x27;s biggest and most watched shows in the UK and around the world. As a result, it is important that the BBC does all it can to uphold confidentiality clauses that have been agreed to in relation to the show.&quot;

In a 27 August 2010 entry on the &quot;Top Gear&quot; blog, executive producer Andy Wilman attacked HarperCollins for attempting to reveal the Stig&#x27;s identity: &quot;The whole point of the Stig is the mystique – the bizarre characteristics he has, the wonderment created about what he might think, feel, do or look like. ... HarperCollins have decided none of that is as important as their profits.&quot; He also clarified that half of the BBC&#x27;s legal costs were being funded by BBC Worldwide, their commercial arm.

On 29 August, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; claimed that photos of Collins at his England home on the same day that the Stig had appeared at a &quot;Top Gear&quot; event in Germany proved that Collins had already been fired from the Stig role. When asked about the ongoing High Court action, Collins stated, &quot;I am not allowed to talk about it.&quot;

On 1 September 2010, the case was decided against the BBC, as the High Court refused to grant an injunction blocking the publication of the autobiography now acknowledged to be authored by Collins. Collins was in court for part of that day&#x27;s hearing, but neither he nor the BBC confirmed afterward that he was the Stig; a BBC spokesman said, &quot;The BBC brought this action as we believe it is vital to protect the character of The Stig, which ultimately belongs to the licence-fee payer. Today&#x27;s judgment does not prevent the BBC from pursuing this matter to trial and it will not be deterred from protecting such information from attack no matter when or by whom it should arise.&quot; On 3 September 2010, the BBC News website published a profile of Collins that began: &quot;Former Formula Three driver Ben Collins has won a legal fight to publish an autobiography in which he claims to be The Stig.&quot;

Collins&#x27; book, &quot;The Man in the White Suit,&quot; was published 16 September 2010.

====Aftermath====
Immediately following the High Court&#x27;s decision, &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenter James May commented, &quot;Obviously I&#x27;m now going to have to take some legal action of my own, because I have been the Stig for the past seven years, and I don&#x27;t know who this bloke is, who&#x27;s mincing around in the High Court pretending it&#x27;s him.&quot; He expounded on the pretence in a newspaper column the next day, describing his dual life as the Stig and &quot;Captain Slow&quot;.

Speculation about the future of the Stig character began immediately. On 3 September 2010, May told a radio show that the Stig would be &quot;dealt with&quot; in a similar manner to how the Black Stig was eliminated. On the same day, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported that the BBC would not be renewing Collins&#x27; contract and that Collins would be soliciting offers to star in his own programme. (A month later, he joined the show &quot;Fifth Gear&quot; for its eighteenth series; he then became a co-presenter on the Polish programme &quot;Automaniak&quot;.) Clarkson advertised for a new driver in his 4 September newspaper column, noting the successful applicant must know that &quot;no one, under any circumstances, should ever rat on their friends&quot;. In a 7 September interview, Clarkson said that Collins was &quot;history as far as we are concerned. He&#x27;s sacked.&quot;

Bookmakers&#x27; favourites to become the new Stig included Anthony Davidson, Damon Hill, Russ Swift, Heikki Kovalainen, and an unspecified female driver.

On 1 October 2010, it was announced that Collins would join Five&#x27;s &quot;Fifth Gear&quot; motoring show, where he was introduced by Vicki Butler-Henderson as someone whose name &quot;rhymes with The Twig.&quot; Collins appeared unmasked, saying &quot;Yes, I can speak. It&#x27;s a massive pleasure to do so.&quot;

On 5 November 2010, the &quot;Top Gear&quot; website released a video clip about its &quot;Stig Farm,&quot; the end of which introduced a new Stig for the travelling stage show &quot;Top Gear Live.&quot; The video also featured a Stig attempting to write a book on a computer, and correcting one of its many mistakes with Tippex.

In the &quot;USA Road Trip&quot; special (debuting 21 December 2010), the presenters branded the Stig a traitor; May declared his true name to be Judas Iscariot. In a challenge mimicking a drive-by shooting, the targets used were cardboard representations of the Stig (with Hammond taking special care to shoot the Stig in the back).

During Collins&#x27; appearance with a military amputees rally team, broadcast in July 2011, he was introduced by Hammond as &quot;ex-Stig Ben Collins.&quot; Collins returned to &quot;Top Gear&quot; in the series 18 special &quot;50 Years of Bond Cars,&quot; where Hammond interviewed him on his work as a stunt driver in the film &quot;Skyfall.&quot; Hammond again introduced him as an ex-Stig and referred several times during the interview to Collins&#x27; departure. Collins wore a T-shirt during the interview which read &quot;I am the Stig.&quot;

===Second White Stig===

On 26 December 2010, five days after the &quot;USA Road Trip&quot; special, &quot;Top Gear&quot; aired a &quot;Middle East Special&quot; in which the presenters re-enacted the journey of the Three Wise Men to Bethlehem. At the episode&#x27;s conclusion, they discovered a manger cradling not Jesus, but a baby Stig.

In the series 16 premiere a month later, the presenters explained that Stigs grow very quickly, and the new Stig was thus already fully grown. Aside from a slightly different helmet and overalls, this Stig closely resembles the previous Stig. In his first episode, he set a speed record around the track (1:15.1) in an Ariel Atom V8 – Clarkson commenting that this Stig posted times &quot;broadly comparable to those of Sacked Stig&quot;. The same Stig was retained following the depatures of Clarkson, Hammond and May in 2015 following Clarkson&#x27;s suspension and dismissal from the BBC due to a fracas that occurred during filming of series 22. His identity remained secret until 2024, when Clarkson revealed it was British racing driver Phil Keen.

==&quot;Cousins&quot; and other &quot;family members&quot;==
Various episodes have featured &quot;cousins&quot; and other relatives of the Stig, often when the show is filming outside the United Kingdom. These individuals dress in different attires, but always wear the Stig’s helmet, and continue the tradition of remaining silent.

; &quot;Big Stig&quot;: US Special (2007)
: The show featured a portly American cousin nicknamed &quot;Big Stig.&quot; He raced the presenters&#x27; cars around the Palm Beach International Raceway track. Clarkson stated he had a &quot;relaxed driving style&quot;. 
; &quot;African Cousin&quot;: Botswana Special (2007)
: This special featured the Stig&#x27;s African cousin, with dark skin, wearing just Puma racing boots, a loincloth, white racing gloves and the iconic white helmet. He raced two of the presenters&#x27; chosen cars around an improvised rally track; Clarkson&#x27;s Lancia Beta refused to start. According to the special&#x27;s DVD commentary, this cousin was &quot;...an incredibly well respected racing driver&quot;.
; &quot;Rig Stig&quot;: Series 12; Episode 1 (2008)
: &quot;Rig Stig&quot; made his debut, sporting a &quot;suntanned&quot; right sleeve and glove in reference to his supposed job as a lorry driver. He appeared powersliding a Team Oliver racing truck to show to the presenters that a lorry could drift.
; &quot;Vietnamese/Communist Cousin&quot;: Vietnam Special (2008)
: A version of the Stig that rode a motorbike, he was nicknamed the &quot;Vietnamese/Communist&quot; cousin and wore a red uniform. Although featured in a montage compiled at the beginning of series twelve showing a preview of the episodes to come, his feature did not air in the original broadcast of the special. The footage was however included in a later DVD release. &quot;Top Gear&quot; hired a local motorcycle stunt rider.
; &quot;Janet Stig Porter/Eco Stig&quot;: Series 14; Episode 2 (2009)
: The Stig&#x27;s vegetarian cousin, nicknamed &quot;Janet Stig Porter&quot;, appeared. He wore green overalls, Birkenstock sandals with socks, and a solar-powered helmet. He drove the presenters&#x27; &quot;Hammerhead Eagle iThrust&quot; hybrid around the MIRA test circuit to see how long it would last, but was incapacitated by the car&#x27;s diesel fumes. Ben Collins later revealed that he played the part of the eco Stig.
; &quot;Herr Stig/Stiggy Ray Cyrus&quot;: Series 15; Episode 2 (2010)
: The Stig&#x27;s German cousin was also nicknamed &quot;Herr Stig&quot; and &quot;Stiggy Ray Cyrus&quot;. He was almost identical to the main Stig, the main difference being a mullet haircut. He drove the presenters&#x27; cheap sports saloons around EuroSpeedway Lausitz. Ben Collins later revealed that he played the part of the German Stig.
; &quot;Bunga-Bunga Stig&quot;: Series 18; Episode 1 (2012)
: The Stig&#x27;s Italian cousin, &quot;Bunga-Bunga Stig&quot;, was introduced during the final leg of the Italian Road Trip at Imola Circuit. He came out of a motor-home dressed in a suit, followed by three glamorous women, to set a lap time in a Ferrari 458 Italia.
; &quot;Attack Stig&quot;: Series 18; Episode 2 (2012) 
: The Stig&#x27;s Chinese cousin &quot;Attack Stig&quot; made his dramatic arrival by kung fu kicking through a door at the local race track. While in appearance he looks the same as the normal Stig, Chinese Stig attacked anyone indiscriminately with martial arts. His unruly behaviour caused problems not just for the presenters but also for the &quot;Top Gear&quot; filming crew, flag bearer and a nearby track marshal, the latter for whom this Stig even interrupted his timed lap of the Roewe 350 in order to attack. After the timed laps, he walked on-screen and kicked James &quot;in the plums&quot;. His behaviour was so bad that Clarkson remarked, &quot;that&#x27;s the worst Stig we&#x27;ve ever had.&quot;
; &quot;Teenage Cousin&quot;: Series 21; Episode 1 (2014)
: The Stig&#x27;s Teenage cousin appeared, with headphones on, a low waist line allowing his underwear to be seen and a phone he seldom stopped looking at. He drove a modern hot hatchback to set a hill run time against the presenters&#x27;s classic hot hatchbacks. He also appears in advertisements promoting the mobile game &quot;Top Gear: Race The Stig&quot;.
; &quot;Australian Cousin&quot;: Series 22; Episode 2 (2015)
: The Stig&#x27;s Australian cousin was introduced during a hill-climb track in the Australian Outback, placed in an open cut iron ore mine and setting a benchmark time in an Australian HSV Maloo Ute. He looks similar to the ordinary Stig, except for dusty, white overalls with flip-flops, and sporting a large &quot;gentleman sausage&quot; and muscular upper body.
; &quot;Leisure Stig&quot;: Series 22; Episode 8 (2015)
: The Stig&#x27;s leisure activity cousin is also known as Top Gear&#x27;s top-secret Leisure Stig. He is only used for testing caravans and is an otherwise useless driver. He appears identical to the ordinary Stig, but is notably slower.
; &quot;Teenaged Cousins&quot;: Series 24; Episode 4 (2017); Series 25; Episode 4 (2018) Series 29; Episode 2 
: The Stig&#x27;s three Teenaged Cousins sported the same appearance as the previous Teenage cousin, each sporting smartphones and headphones of different colours. They drove the Renault Twingo GT, the Smart Fortwo Brabus, and the Volkswagen Up on the Top Gear track, in a race against each other. Two Teenaged Stigs appear again in Series 25, this time racing the Hyundai i30N against the Volkswagen Golf GTI Mk7 on a wet Top Gear track.
; &quot;Emirati Cousin&quot;: Series 24; Episode 4 (2017)
: The Stig&#x27;s Emirati cousin drove host Matt LeBlanc through downtown Dubai in a Bentley Mulsanne. He looks similar to the ordinary Stig, except for wearing a ghutrah on top of his helmet, and a huge diamond watch on his wrist.
; &quot;StigFoot&quot;: Series 25; Episode 2 (2018)
: StigFoot appears briefly at the end of the episode having been pursued by LeBlanc and Harris as they search for Bigfoot.
; &quot;Ninja Stig&quot;: Series 25; Episode 3 (2018): The Stig&#x27;s Japanese ninja cousin appears during Harris&#x27; visit to Japan, where he raced Harris in a drifting duel. He wore a black helmet, black ninja outfit and a katana strapped to his back.
; &quot;Business Stig&quot;: Series 26; Episode 2 (2019): The Stig&#x27;s &quot;business cousin&quot; appears during Harris&#x27; review of BMW M5 and Mercedes-AMG E63 S. He wears a red tie and a set of braces.
; &quot;Stig&#x27;s dad&quot;: Series 30; Episode 1 (2021): The Stig&#x27;s dad appears during a Rally challenge in the episode&#x27;s main feature which deals with the main presenters commemorating their dads&#x27; cars. The Stig&#x27;s dad sets the benchmark time the presenters then try to beat. He wears a tank top and flare trousers.

=== Other Stigs ===
The Australian, French, Korean, Russian, Chinese and U.S. adaptions of &quot;Top Gear&quot; also feature their own versions of The Stig. The &quot;Top Gear Australia&quot; Stig was wheeled on screen, upside down in a delivery crate for the UK-Australian &quot;Top Gear Ashes&quot; episode. Additionally, when &quot;Top Gear Australia&quot; visited New Zealand (in series 3 episode 2), they introduced their Stig&#x27;s Kiwi cousin, &quot;The Stug&quot; (referencing New Zealand English&#x27;s centralised short-&quot;i&quot; sound). When &quot;Top Gear U.S.&quot; drove a modified off-road racer through Colorado against a kayak, they introduced &quot;Backwoods Stig,&quot; who wears a white racing overall with torn off sleeves. The Stig was rarely used in the US version as presenter Tanner Foust is himself a professional racing driver, but was portrayed by Paul F Gerrard. The Korean version of the Stig is reportedly portrayed by Bil Li-ship.

In the DVD &quot;Top Gear: The Worst Car in the History of the World,&quot; the Stig&#x27;s Yorkshire cousin, nicknamed &quot;T&#x27;Stig&quot; (a reference to the Yorkshire accent), was featured. Alongside his trademark racing outfit, he had a flat cap on his helmet and two whippets by his feet. He was involved in driving a BMW around a Gymkhana course to show how it is done for when James and Jeremy attempt to do so with two of the worst American cars. He was also prompted to drive a Peugeot 308 - one of the cars that was the candidate for the title, but he fled.

==Temporary Stigs==
In the Winter Olympics special &quot;Top Gear&quot; used Dan Lang, a Swedish snowmobile champion, to jump a snowmobile.

In the &quot;USA Road Trip&quot; (aired 21 December 2010), Tiff Needell was brought in as an &quot;Emergency Stig&quot; to train Danny Boyle on the track.

==Other appearances==
In June 2008, the Stig drove a passenger in a two-seat Formula One car at speeds up to for three laps around the Silverstone Circuit in wet conditions, hours before the start of the 2008 British Grand Prix. The drive was the prize in a charity auction held in aid of Great Ormond Street Children&#x27;s Hospital where the winning bidder paid £35,000 for the privilege. The Stig appeared at the 2008 October National Television Awards to accept &quot;Top Gear&#x27;s&quot; third award for best factual programme, as the other presenters were ostensibly busy filming the new series. The Stig also appears at &quot;Top Gear Live&quot; events, such as the August 2010 Stunt Show at the Nürburgring in Germany, in which he is billed as the star of the show alongside the other stunt drivers and cars, with the other &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenters not playing a part. The Stig has appeared outside &quot;Top Gear&quot; in Clarkson&#x27;s motoring DVDs since 2005. He also appeared before the BBC&#x27;s 2011 British Grand Prix coverage when Clarkson and Hammond gave the camera crew a tour of the &quot;Top Gear&quot; studio.

In February 2009, a YouTube video emerged which suggested the Black Stig had survived his accident. Still wearing his iconic black overalls, helmet and only one glove, he is witnessed to emerge from the waves by a group of men playing frisbee on the beach at Walton-on-the-Naze in Essex, where he initially mistook their frisbee for a steering wheel, before running away.

In the 2011 X Games 17, the Stig can be seen walking in the background during one of Brian Deegan&#x27;s interviews during Rallycross. Tanner Foust, one of the presenters of &quot;Top Gear US&quot;, was competing in the event.

Google Street view of the Dunsfold track shows the Google Camera car being paced by The Stig driving a Mercedes SLS coupe.

In 2016, he was a part of &quot;The Getaway Car&quot; presented by Dermot O&#x27;Leary along with his 2 &#x27;nephews&#x27; simply called &#x27;Red Stig&#x27; and &#x27;Blue Stig&#x27;.

On 8 December 2016, the Stig appears for a short moment in a segment from Top Gear: Series 23, where he is seen reading a paper while Ken Block zooms past in his Hoonicorn Mustang along with Matt LeBlanc.

On 30 March 2017, the Stig appeared on Colin Furze&#x27;s &quot;World&#x27;s Fastest Bumper Car&quot; YouTube video, which featured a modified 1960s bumper car and a 600cc 100bhp engine.

For a period, the Stig, along with the &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenters, appeared in miniature at Legoland Windsor, arranged around a model of a Caterham sports car.

==Cultural impact and merchandising==
&quot;The Scotsman&quot; described the Stig in 2008 as a &quot;real-life James Bond able to tame the most powerful cars, while possessing all the mystique of Zorro.&quot; &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 2009 described the Stig as &quot;not a man but an idea, possibly an extraterrestrial,&quot; speculating that, along the lines of the Spartacus mythology, the more people that were linked with the character, the stronger the mystery would become. It paid tribute to how long the show had actually kept the secret.

The question of &quot;Who is the Stig?&quot; has been described as one of the most-asked queries on the Internet. The &quot;Sunday Times&quot; reported that online and text-answering services rated it as one of the most popular questions of all time, along with the meaning of life.

The Stig has been notionally &quot;spotted&quot; in the wild in images collected for Google Street View. He was photographed by a Street View car standing on the side of the A82 road in Loch Ness, Scotland. He was also captured by a Street View tricycle in three locations within Legoland Windsor in Berkshire, including riding a go-kart and sitting on a camel. A Street View image taken from the A40 Westway of the Stig apparently standing in a window of the &quot;Top Gear&quot; office was reportedly just a cardboard cut-out.

The BBC has capitalised on the mystery behind the Stig by marketing &quot;I AM THE STIG&quot; T-shirts and variants through the &quot;Top Gear&quot; shop. Other Stig merchandise has included bubble wash, pens, keyrings, soap on a rope, lunchbags and a &quot;sonic toothbrush.&quot;

Through a partnership with Polyphony Digital, the Stig&#x27;s helmet and overalls are available for virtual purchase in the videogames &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot; and &quot;Gran Turismo 6&quot;. The Stig has also appeared several times in the &quot;Forza Motorsport&quot; series, including as avatar items in &quot;Forza Motorsport 4&quot;, one-on-one racing challenges against &quot;The Stig&#x27;s Digital Cousin&quot; in &quot;Forza Motorsport 5&quot; and &quot;Forza Motorsport 6&quot;, and as a driver outfit in an add-on for &quot;Forza Motorsport 7&quot; and as a reward in &quot;Forza Horizon 4&quot;.

In 2018, Piccadilly Press (under licence from BBC Worldwide) published &quot;The Stig Plays a Dangerous Game&quot;, the first in a series of children&#x27;s books featuring The Stig as the silent &#x27;secret weapon&#x27; of a group of friends who become &#x27;the Top Gear Gang&#x27;. &quot;The Stig Drives Again&quot; was published later the same year and the third in the trilogy, &quot;The Stig and the Silver Ghost&quot;, came out in October 2019. The books feature in a joint venture with the School Libraries Association to promote school literacy whereby initial copies of each book, plus support materials, are provided free of charge to requesting schools.

<text>Brigadier-General Edmund William Costello, VC, CMG, CVO, DSO (7 August 1873 – 7 June 1949) was a British Indian Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and service==
Costello was born in Sheikhbudia on the North-West Frontier of India, the son of a colonel in the Indian Medical Service. He was educated in England at Beaumont College, Stonyhurst College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. In 1892 he was commissioned into the West Yorkshire Regiment, but transferred to the Indian Army in 1894 and was posted to the 22nd Punjab Infantry.

==Victoria Cross==
He was 23 years old, and attached to the 24th Punjab Infantry during the Malakand Frontier War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

In the subsequent fighting he was wounded twice and mentioned in dispatches twice.

==Later service==
In November 1900 Costello was appointed adjutant of his regiment, and on 19 November 1901 he was promoted Captain in the Indian Staff Corps. He then worked as a recruiting officer for several years before taking part in the Mohmand operations of 1908. He was promoted Major in 1910. In 1913 he entered the Indian Staff College at Quetta and graduated just before the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, when he rejoined his regiment as second-in-command.

The regiment was soon sent to Mesopotamia as part of the 17th (Ahmednagar) Brigade of the 6th (Poona) Division and Costello remained there for the rest of the war. He was promoted Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel in June 1916, was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in 1917 and appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1918. In May 1918 he took command of the 12th Indian Brigade and he received a substantive promotion to Lieutenant-Colonel in September 1918. He was mentioned five times in dispatches during the war and also received the French Croix de Guerre.

In June 1919 he was promoted Brevet Colonel and was joint commander of the Indian contingent at the Peace March in London, for which he was appointed Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in the 1920 New Year Honours. He was promoted substantive Colonel in March 1920, although he had held the acting appointment of Brigadier-General since 1918. From May to December 1920 he commanded the 8th (Jullundur) Brigade in the 3rd (Lahore) Division. In March 1921 he went to Palestine as temporary commander of the Palestine Defence Force and remained there to command a brigade in 1922. He retired in October 1923 and became Director of Military Studies at the University of Cambridge.

==Family==
Costello married Elise Maud Lang Huggins, daughter of Charles Lang Huggins, of Hadlow Grange, Buxted, Sussex, at St Peter and St Edward&#x27;s church, Pimlico, on 16 October 1902.

==Legacy==
His grave and headstone memorial is at St Mark&#x27;s Church, Hadlow Down, Sussex, England.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Army Museum in Chelsea.

<text>Jesi () is a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in the province of Ancona, in the Italian region of Marche.


It is an important industrial and artistic center in the floodplain on the left (north) bank of the Esino river, before its mouth on the Adriatic Sea.

==History==
Jesi (Iesi) was one of the last towns of the Umbri when, in the 4th century BC, the Senones Gauls invaded the area and ousted them. They turned it into a stronghold against the Piceni. In 283 BC the Senones were defeated by the Romans. Jesi in 247 BC became a &quot;colonia civium romanorum&quot; with the name of Aesis.

During the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Jesi was ravaged by the troops of Odoacer (476 AD) and again in 493 by the Ostrogoths of Theodoric the Great. After the Gothic War, Italy became part of the Byzantine Empire, and Jesi became one of the main centers of the new rulers, and a diocese seat. In 751 it was sacked by the Lombard troops of Aistulf, and later was a Carolingian imperial city.

Since 1130, it was an independent commune, gradually expanding its control over its surrounding agrarian region. In December 1194 the future Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II was born here: he later made Jesi a &quot;Royal City&quot;. In the 14th century it was captured by the Papal vicar Filippo Simonetti, then by Galeotto I Malatesta (1347–1351), by Braccio da Montone in 1408, and by Francesco I Sforza, who turned it into his family&#x27;s main stronghold in the Marche. In 1447 Jesi was bought by the Papal States.

==Main sights==

*: duomo built in the 13th-15th centuries. The façade and the Latin cross interior are modern.

<text>In Bhutan, political parties need to be registered with Election Commission to contest National Assembly elections. Political parties can only contest National Assembly elections, since being an independent is a requirement for contesting National Council and local government elections.

Besides the official registered parties that came into existence after the democratisation of Bhutan, many Bhutanese parties have been operating in exile since the 1990s. Most of these parties are run by exiled people from the Lhotshampa community from the refugee camps in Nepal.

==Official parties==
In Bhutan, political parties need to be registered with Election Commission of Bhutan to participate in the Bhutanese elections.

===Active parties===
===Deregistered parties===
In 2018, Druk Chirwang Tshogpa was deregistered by the Election Commission on its own request.

In 2023, the Bhutan Kuen-Nyam Party deregistered after years of low activity. The party had failed to find a new leader after Neten Zangmo resigned the position in 2018.

==Other political parties==
The following parties are all based in exile.
* Bhutan Democratic Socialist Party
* Bhutan Gorkha National Liberation Front
* Bhutan National Congress
* Bhutan National Democratic Party
* Bhutan National Party
* Bhutan Peoples&#x27; Party
* Bhutanese Movement Steering Committee
* Communist Party of Bhutan (Marxist–Leninist–Maoist)
** Bhutan Tiger Force 
* Druk National Congress

The Druk National Congress was formed in exile in Kathmandu, Nepal on June 16, 1994.

On August 26, 2010, Bhutanese political parties in exile formed an umbrella group to pursue a &quot;unified democratic movement led by Rongthong Kunley Dorji, President of the Druk National Congress. The group&#x27;s offices opened in Kathmandu in November 2010, and it seems to receive some measure of support from the Nepalese government.

<text>Għar Dalam (; &quot;Cave of Dalam&quot; (a fifteenth century family name)) is a 144-metre long phreatic tube and cave, located in the outskirts of Birżebbuġa, Malta. The cave contains the bones of animals that lived on Malta during the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. has lent its name to the Għar Dalam phase in Maltese prehistory, and is viewed as one of Malta&#x27;s most important national monuments. Pottery similar to that found in Stentinello was found at Għar Dalam, but lacking details such as stamp decorations.

Dwarf elephant, hippopotamus, giant swan, deer and bear bone deposits found there are of different ages. The deer species became extinct much later, about 4,000 years ago during the Chalcolithic. It is also here that the earliest evidence of human settlement on Malta, some 7,400 years ago, was discovered.

==Recent history==
The cave was first investigated for its Neolithic remains in 1865, with excavations by Italian palaeontologist Arturo Issel. An excavation was carried out in 1892 by John H. Cooke. The bulk of this material was stored in Malta, while a comparative collection was sent to the British Museum. This material was studied by Forsyth Major in 1902, who isolated a new dwarf species of dwarf hippopotamus, &quot;Hippopotamus melitensis&quot;, based on these findings.

The cave was included on the Antiquities List of 1925, but was not opened to the public until March 1933. A museum was set up on site by the then-Curator of Natural History, Joseph Baldacchino. Within a year of his appointment as curator in 1935, Baldacchino published a booklet on Għar Dalam, highlighting the main excavations and investigations of the cave. The museum was slowly upgraded, new specimens replacing the old, and a labelling system set in place.

The showcases around the walls of the Għar Dalam museum house the skeletal remains found in the cave. These are organised by species and type. The showcases in the centre of the museum&#x27;s room contain complete skeletons of modern examples of deer, elephant and other species. These were not found in the cave, but imported as reference specimens for the use of scholars working on the fossil examples.

It was used as an air-raid shelter during World War II. In 1980, the most important and irreplaceable relics—such as four tusks of dwarf elephants and the skull of a Neolithic child—were stolen from the museum.

The cave is some deep but only the first are accessible to visitors. The museum, which still exhibits a remarkable wealth of finds from animal bones to human artifacts, is the entrance to the whole area.

Għar Dalam Cave and Museum is operated by Heritage Malta. In 2019, a project was announced to improve the physical accessibility between Għar Dalam, Ta’ Kaċċatura, Borġ in-Nadur, and other sites which are in close proximity to one another.

==Stratigraphy==
The cave consists of six layers.
#Domestic animal layer (c. 74 cm). This layer has mainly cultivated animals in it, such as cows, horses and sheep/goats. Human remains, like pottery, flints, tools and ornaments or amulets are present here.
#Calcareous sheet (c. 0.6 cm).
#Deer Layer (c. 175 cm). The dwarf deer found in this layer are derived from the red deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;). Small numbers of carnivores are known from this layer, namely brown bear, red fox and wolf. Also big swans, giant turtles and voles are found.
#Pebble layer (c. 35 cm). This layer consists completely of small boulders and pebbles. They are indicators of a river that streamed through the cave. The stones are quite large, as it was a fast-flowing river.
#Hippopotamus layer (c. 120 cm). This layer consists of mainly &quot;Hippopotamus melitensis&quot;. Other species found are dwarf elephants and the giant dormouse &quot;Leithia cartei&quot;.
#Bone-Free clay layer (c. 125 cm). No bones found in this layer, only some impressions of plant material

== Notes ==

: [A]. Buhagiar (2007) notes that the name Għar Dalam does not mean the &#x27;Cave of Darkness&#x27;, as would be the case in Arabic, but the &#x27;Cave of Dalam,&#x27; or &#x27;of the Dalam family.&#x27; The surname Dalam is attested in 15th century records.

<text>Veer-Zaara is a 2004 Indian Hindi-language romantic film directed and produced by Yash Chopra, and written by his son Aditya Chopra. It stars Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta as the titular star-crossed lovers: Veer Pratap Singh is an Indian Air Force officer, and Zaara Hayaat Khan is the daughter of a Pakistani politician. Veer is imprisoned on false charges, and 22 years later, a young Pakistani lawyer, named Saamiya Siddiqui (Rani Mukerji), fights his case. Amitabh Bachchan, Hema Malini, Divya Dutta, Manoj Bajpayee, Boman Irani, Anupam Kher and Kirron Kher play supporting roles.

Chopra expressed his desire to make a comeback to the film industry after a gap of seven years, as he was unsatisfied with the scripts he had been offered. It was during this time that Aditya narrated a few scenes from a story he had written, which intrigued Chopra and sparked his interest to direct it. Chopra envisioned the film as a tribute to Punjab, aiming to capture the essence of the region. It was to be titled &quot;Yeh Kahaan Aa Gaye Hum,&quot; based on an eponymous song from Yash Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Silsila&quot; (1981). Set in India and Pakistan, principal photography took place in Indian Punjab and in Mumbai; parts of the film were also shot in Pakistan. The soundtrack album, based on old compositions by Madan Mohan with lyrics by Javed Akhtar, was the highest-selling album of the year in India.

&quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; was released on 12 November 2004 during Diwali. The film earned over 97 crore worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing Indian film of the year. It received universal acclaim, especially for its story, dialogues, soundtrack, performances and sensitive portrayal of India-Pakistan relations. It was described by analysts as having themes pertaining to a shared Punjabi culture, secularism and feminism, among others. &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; is ranked among the greatest romantic films of Indian cinema.

At the 52nd National Film Awards, &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; won Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment. At the 50th Filmfare Awards, the film received a leading 15 nominations, and won 4 awards, including Best Film and Best Story (Aditya). At the 6th IIFA Awards, it won a leading 7 awards of its 11 nominations, including Best Film, Best Director (Chopra), Best Actor (Khan), Best Supporting Actress (Mukerji) and Best Music Director (Mohan).

==Plot==
The government of Pakistan decides to review unsolved cases pertaining to their Indian prisoners as a gesture of goodwill. Saamiya Siddiqui, a budding Pakistani lawyer, is given the defense of prisoner 786 as her first case. The prisoner, documented under the name Rajesh Rathore, has not spoken for twenty-two years. However, when Saamiya addresses him by his real name, Veer Pratap Singh, he breaks his silence and opens up to her about his story.

Twenty-two years earlier, Zaara Hayaat Khan was a lively young Pakistani woman whose family has a political background and is of high standing in Lahore. Her engagement is arranged with Raza Shirazi, a wealthy and influential lawyer. Zaara travels to India to fulfill the last wish of her Sikh nanny: to have her ashes scattered in the Sutlej River. Her bus met with an accident. Veer, then an Indian Air Force pilot and a Punjabi Sikh, rescues Zaara and helps her complete her nanny&#x27;s final wish. She accompanies him to his village to celebrate the festival of Lohri, where she meets his loving aunt and uncle, who raised him. 

The next day, Veer takes Zaara to the train station for her return to Pakistan and is shocked to see her fiancé Raza there to accompany her. Veer confesses that he has fallen in love with her, accepting that they cannot be together. Both depart, believing they will never meet again. Amidst her wedding preparations back home, Zaara realises that she too is in love with Veer. Her mother, however, is against this, as marrying Raza will further her father&#x27;s political career. Zaara&#x27;s friend Shabbo secretly calls Veer, begging him to take Zaara away. He promptly quits the Indian Air Force and arrives in Pakistan. Zaara tearfully runs into his arms, causing her father to fall ill with shock and anger. 

Zaara&#x27;s mother begs Veer to leave Zaara, fearing for her father&#x27;s reputation and health. Veer respects this and attempts to return home but Raza, outraged and jealous, has him arrested by Pakistani police. He blackmails Veer with two choices: be imprisoned for life on charges of being an Indian spy, with Raza giving Zaara a life full of happiness, or walk free knowing that Raza will make Zaara&#x27;s life a living hell. Veer sacrifices his freedom out of his deep love for Zaara and is imprisoned in Pakistan. Meanwhile, his return bus falls off a cliff, killing all the passengers, so he is presumed dead to the world. 

Veer requests Saamiya not to mention Zaara whilst fighting the case, believing that she must be married by now; he does not want to ruin her reputation or make her settled life difficult. Saamiya travels to his village to find someone who can prove his true identity. She is shocked to find Zaara and Shabbo at his home.

Shabbo explains that after Zaara thought Veer died in the bus accident 22 years ago, she broke off the marriage with Raza with her father&#x27;s support. Her parents and Veer&#x27;s aunt and uncle all eventually passed away within a few years. With the Hayat Khan family basically perished, Zaara and Shabbo left Pakistan and settled in Veer&#x27;s village in India to fulfill Veer&#x27;s dream of developing their village further. 

Zaara is shocked to learn that Veer is alive. She accompanies Saamiya back to Pakistan, where the old lovers share an emotional reunion. Her statement and evidence in court prove Veer&#x27;s innocence and true identity. The judge frees him, apologizing on behalf of Pakistan. Veer and Zaara marry, bid goodbye to Saamiya at the Wagah border crossing, and return home, finally able to live their lives together.

==Production==
===Development===

Yash Chopra was due to return to directing after 7 years since &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot; (1997). After his son Aditya completed filming for &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; (2000), they started to look for a new script for Chopra&#x27;s return as a director. None of the new scripts excited Chopra; he expressed his disdain at the new trend of the films of the time, stating, &quot;I was tired of television promos. All the semi-clad girls look the same.&quot; Chopra stated he was as nervous of his return as he was while directing his debut &quot;Dhool Ka Phool&quot; (1959). He then finalised another script and began casting for roles. Aditya then provided a narration of a few scenes of a new script, but conveyed that he would be unable to direct it. Chopra was interested and began to work on the new project.

According to Aditya, the story of &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; was written as a medium for his father to return to his Punjabi roots. Chopra was born in Lahore, Punjab (present-day Pakistan) and later moved with his family to Jalandhar when he was young. He travelled to Bombay (present-day Mumbai) in 1951, when he was introduced to the film industry. Speaking about the film&#x27;s theme, Chopra said, &quot;&quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; is a humble tribute to my home in Punjab. It is my tribute to the oneness of people on both sides of the border.&quot; In preparation, Chopra watched videos of Pakistani marriages and consulted Nasreen Rehman, a professor of the Cambridge University for the film&#x27;s portrayal of Pakistani culture, their courts and dialects.

While completing the film, Chopra and Aditya had a discussion about the film&#x27;s title. &quot;Yeh Kahaan Aa Gaye Hum&quot; was one of the contenders for the title, but &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; was ultimately chosen. Chopra said, &quot;The film&#x27;s lovers are not bothered with the strife around them. For them, love is the only religion.&quot; The title &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; was initially hinted to mislead audiences. The film&#x27;s titled was officially confirmed by Sanjeev Kohli, CEO of Yash Raj Films, who stated that the title was chosen after &quot;much deliberation&quot;. Chopra stated that he used to have constant arguments with Aditya while filming &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot;.

===Cast and crew===
Shah Rukh Khan was cast in the lead role of Veer. Khan shortly played a 60-year-old man in the film, which he felt was a difficult role for him.

Zaara&#x27;s role was first offered to Kajol, upon her rejection, the role went to Zinta. According to Chopra, Zinta was a person whose &quot;looks and personality could be transformed.&quot; He wanted to break the Western stereotype characters played by Zinta. Zinta was interested in being a part of the film due to Chopra&#x27;s finesse as a director. She also felt that it was time to move on from war-oriented films with Pakistan, saying, &quot;I thought that was a great message to have in a film and I think what our governments can&#x27;t do... what our government cannot do, our cinema can do and this film is truly doing that.&quot; Zinta had to attend various lessons for improving her diction for speaking Urdu. Though excited at first, she later &quot;got knots in her stomach&quot; worrying about her performance, but Chopra assured her.

Based on the Pakistani human rights activist Asma Jehangir, the role of Saamiya Siddiqui was initially offered to Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Pakistani actress Nadia Jamil, but upon their refusal, it went to Rani Mukherji. Amitabh Bachchan and Hema Malini were cast as Veer&#x27;s foster parents. Manoj Bajpayee was cast as Zaara&#x27;s fiancé, a role which was originally offered to Ajay Devgn. In 2017, while promoting &quot;Aiyaary&quot;, Bajpayee revealed that Chopra used to often worry about the film&#x27;s possible failure. Boman Irani was cast in the supporting role of Zaara&#x27;s father. Real-life couple Anupam Kher and Kirron Kher appear in the film as Saamiya&#x27;s mentor and Zaara&#x27;s mother respectively, though they do not share the same frame. Other cast members included Divya Dutta, Zohra Sehgal, Akhilendra Mishra, and Tom Alter. Chopra denied the existence of a rivalry between the co-actors in the film, when asked about it in an interview with &quot;The Quint&quot;.

In addition to writing the story and screenplay, Aditya co-produced the film along with his father under the banner Yash Raj Films. The film&#x27;s costumes were handled by Manish Malhotra. Khan&#x27;s costumes were specifically designed by Karan Johar. Mandira Shukla was the film&#x27;s costume designer. Anil Mehta, the cinematographer, was requested by Chopra to give the scenes a feel of olden times, in contrast with other films of the time like &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; (2003). Sharmishta Roy, daughter of art director Sudhendu Roy, was chosen as the art director. Saroj Khan and Vaibhavi Merchant were the choreographers. Allan Amin was the action director.

===Principal photography===
In October 2004, &quot;Rediff.com&quot; published an exclusive &quot;On The Sets&quot; report for &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot;. The website reported that the cast members wore expensive costumes, one being Zinta, who wore a fluorescent green lungi outfit; Khan was late for the shot. Parts of the film were shot in various locations in Mumbai. In 2004, the National Geographic reported that a folk festival sequence was being shot in Film City, Mumbai. A set that represented Punjab was created and Sikh dancers were brought in, whom, according to the report, look like peacocks due to their colorful turbans. All scenes which featured Khan in a prison were shot in a single day, at a jail in Pakistan. The court scenes were shot in a Pakistani law court.

While filming for an action sequence with Khan, Zinta had a near-fatal experience when she was hanging from a harness for nearly six hours. Zinta labeled it &quot;one of the most humbling experiences of [her] life&quot; and stated that it made her realise the difficulties male actors have to go through. For a sequence involving Khan&#x27;s character calling Mukherji&#x27;s character &#x27;daughter&#x27;, over 10 retakes were taken, and a pack-up was also announced by an &quot;infuriated&quot; Chopra, according to Khan. According to Mukherji, Chopra usually used to refrain from taking retakes as these would make the actors &quot;mechanical&quot;.

&quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; was filmed entirely in sync sound. Khan stated that although he did not have to dub lines for the film separately, he did dub a few dialogues for the film. Saif Ali Khan&#x27;s palace in Pataudi served as Zaara&#x27;s mansion. A shoot was carried out in Punjab during a particular season, after which the indoor shooting was completed. Most of the filming was done in secrecy and no official announcements were made. Initially planned to be filmed over a period of 102 days, the film&#x27;s filming was completed in 72 days. The film&#x27;s reel length was 17757.61 ft (5412.52 m).

==Analysis==
In her book &quot;Violent Belongings: Partition, Gender and National Culture in Postcolonial India&quot;, Kavita Daiya, associate professor of English at the Columbian College of Arts and Sciences feels that Zaara represents secularism in Pakistan. She refers to the encounter between Zaara and Choudhary Sumer Singh, where Zaara persuades Singh to promote women&#x27;s education as an instance of the theme. Daiya notes that no person faces animosity by being either Indian or Pakistani in the film. Meenakshi Bharat and Nirmal Kumar, authors of the book &quot;Filming the Line of Control: The Indo–Pak Relationship through the Cinematic Lens&quot;, concur with Daiya and feels this shows maturity on Chopra&#x27;s part, who ignores the issue of Jammu and Kashmir and was able to &quot;overcome the phobia of Pakistan&quot; usually present in Indian films. They compare it to Chopra&#x27;s earlier films, where &quot;hate-filled encounters&quot; are generally avoided. Philip Lutgendorf agrees and also notes the influence of Sufi tradition, where Veer&#x27;s ultimate reward is union with Allah, much like a Sufi pir. Kush Varia, author of the book &quot;Bollywood: Gods, Glamour, and Gossip&quot;, whilst agreeing with Bharat and Kumar about Chopra, notes that the lovers are reunited as compared to Chopra&#x27;s earlier romances, where they remain separated.

Daiya establishes that Veer&#x27;s &quot;Indian masculinity&quot; is shown through his sacrifice of spending 22 years in jail. Nandini Bhattacharya, author of the book &quot;Hindi Cinema: Repeating the Subject&quot;, differs and instead feels that Veer&#x27;s character is &quot;partially feminized&quot;&quot;men are meant to be captors, not captives.&quot; Sangita Gopal, associate professor of English at the University of Oregon and author of the book &quot;Conjugations: Marriage and Form in New Bollywood Cinema&quot;, notes that Veer&#x27;s identity dies after 22 years and even after reuniting with Zaara, they are too old to reproduce. She perceives this as the transition from &quot;living death to fruitless life&quot;. Daiya feels that the Punjabi village in &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; acts as a model for India, and Zaara&#x27;s positive to a song describing India, feeling similarities with Pakistan, exposes an incomplete &quot;utopian&quot; affiliation between the two lovers. Daiya further feels that Veer&#x27;s poem challenges the differences between the nations of India and Pakistan and establishes resemblance between the nations and citizens. Varia too agrees that the shared heritage of the Punjabis is one of the film&#x27;s themes, explored in the song &quot;Aisa Des Hai Mera&quot;.

Bharat and Kumar feel that &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; and &quot;Main Hoon Na&quot; (2004), also starring Khan, accepts Pakistan&#x27;s status as a separate entity from India. Rajinder Dudrah, senior lecturer at the University of Manchester, contrasts &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; with &quot;Main Hoon Na&quot;, writing that while the former &quot;explores the pleasures and trials of border crossing&quot;, the latter &quot;extols the virtues of overcoming the border through diplomacy and personal actions.&quot; He notes that they show different depictions of borders that the protagonists need to overcome. He feels that the central aestic pleasures of the films, especially &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot;, is the emphasis on border crossing as a &quot;potentially radical act&quot;. Bharat and Kumar also compare &quot;Henna&quot; (1991) with &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot;; they say that the &quot;urbane, educated, professional characters&quot; of &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; replace &quot;Henna&quot;&#x27;s village people referring to &quot;religion straight from the heart&quot; and &quot;responding to [Pakistan] in an unencumbered manner.&quot; Henna&#x27;s brother died in helping Chander across the border; this is contrasted with Saamiya helping Veer in court. Dudrah notes that the ease with which the protagonists move across borders without going through legal procedurings could be a source of criticism.

Gopal feels that the film&#x27;s dual time and use of old music was the reason for its appeal to masses and its commercial success. She compares the last segment of the title song in which Zaara is shot to the climax of Mani Ratnam&#x27;s &quot;Dil Se..&quot; (1998); both films suggest that the lovers cannot be united. She also feels that the extended ending with the song &quot;Tere Liye&quot; was for a realistic approach. In her book &quot;Dreaming in Canadian: South Asian Youth, Bollywood, and Belonging&quot;, Faiza Hirji feels that cultural and religious differences were not acknowledged in the film, while noting Pakistani and Muslim traditions were highlighted. She felt that the universality of the maternal habit was highlighted in a sequence between Zaara&#x27;s mother and Veer. She contrasts the love to &quot;Bombay&quot; (1995), where religion is an obstacle to love, which is not the case in &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot;. Comparing the film with &quot;&quot; (2001), Rini Bhattacharya Mehta and Rajeshwari V. Pandharipande (authors of the book &quot;Bollywood and Globalization: Indian Popular Cinema, Nation, and Diaspora&quot;) state that while &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; manipulates the state&#x27;s critique to make it appear &quot;progressive&quot; at first glance, &quot;Gadar&quot; does not. Both &quot;Gadar&quot; and &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; feature a double recovery; only that the latter adopts &quot;similarly duplicitous modes of writing political structures as individual destined whose triumph over nation-state politics drives aground more completely any redemptive plot of neighborly understanding&quot;. Bhattacharya agrees and also equates it with &quot;Gadar&quot; and others like &quot;Mother India&quot; (1957), where the &quot;identity of the normative citizen&quot; is established.

==Music==

&quot;Veer-Zaara&quot;″s soundtrack features 11 songs with music based on old and untouched compositions by the late Madan Mohan, as revised by his son Sanjeev Kohli. The vocals are provided by Lata Mangeshkar, Jagjit Singh, Udit Narayan, Sonu Nigam, Gurdas Mann, Roop Kumar Rathod, Ahmed and Mohammed Hussain and Pritha Mazumder. The lyrics were written by Javed Akhtar. The soundtrack was released by YRF Music on 18 September 2004.

Mohan was nominated for the Best Music Director at the 50th Filmfare Awards, and won the Best Music Director at the 6th IIFA Awards. Akhtar got nominated for the Best Lyricist at the 50th Filmfare Awards for &quot;Aisa Des Hai Mera&quot;, &quot;Main Yahaan Hoon&quot; and &quot;Tere Liye&quot;, winning for &quot;Tere Liye&quot;; he also received a nomination for the IIFA Award for Best Lyricist for &quot;Tere Liye&quot;. It was the highest-selling music album of the year in India, with sales of around 3 million units.

 On &quot;Metacritic&quot;, which assigns a weighted average to films, it has a score of 67 based on five critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Dwyer feels that the film represents the &quot;much-shared culture and history&quot; of the Punjab. She writes, &quot;Their dramatization in the film shows Chopra’s skill with film and music.&quot;

====India====
Taran Adarsh of &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; gave it 4.5 stars out of five and comments, &quot;There&#x27;s romance, there&#x27;s a strong dose of emotions, there&#x27;re songs aplenty, there&#x27;s drama... But, most important, it has soul, which has been lacking in most movies of late&quot;. Writing for &quot;India Today&quot;, Kaveree Bamzai gave a positive review and compliments Khan&#x27;s performance, writing, &quot;Khan strides across Aditya Chopra&#x27;s screenplay with assured ease.&quot; Subhash K. Jha gave &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; a positive review for Indo-Asian News Service, praising the performances of the leads as &quot;old yet passionate, frail yet sublime&quot; and writes, &quot;The surge of love between two people belonging to entirely different cultures and lands is collected into a quaint and quivering collage of memory and melody.&quot;

Jitesh Pillai of &quot;The Times of India&quot; rates it 3.5 stars out of five, crediting Aditya&#x27;s writing and its execution. He writes, &quot;Yash Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; may be woefully long and meandering. But... this one works and grabs us where it matters. &quot;VZ&quot; is one from the heart.&quot; Also writing for &quot;Times of India&quot;, Nishtha Bhatnagar called it a &quot;must-watch&quot;. Deepu Madhavan of &quot;NDTV&quot; praised the execution of the plot and writes, &quot;the love story of Squadron Leader Veer Pratap Singh and Zaara Hayaat Khan is an ode to ageless romance and timeless love.&quot; Avijit Ghosh gave the film 7/10 in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; and writes, &quot;The film works because the stars shine. Preity&#x27;s Zaara is both restrained and dignified. This is her most nuanced performance to date.&quot; He criticised the film&#x27;s length and excessive use of Punjabi, but finally writes, &quot;We have an honest-to-the-heart film that remarkably bypasses the bitterness of Indo-Pak relations in a cross-border love story... &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; is for all seasons and every reason.&quot; Namrata Joshi of &quot;Outlook&quot; described it as &quot;a good-hearted film wherein the underlying theme is the all-embracing goodness of &#x27;people&#x27;.&quot;

Chitra Mahesh of &quot;The Hindu&quot; writes, &quot;&quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; is inordinately long and sentimental. Certain things like fabulous camera work, art direction, and sensuousness of the moods, are a given. And you would overlook the cliches simply because there are such good performances, especially from Zinta and Mukherji,&quot; while also appreciating that Khan &quot;looks good and performs most creditably.&quot; Vinayak Chakraborty of Hindustan Times, concurring with Mahesh, wrote that the movie &quot;sticks to all the clichés that the Chopra camp has peddled down the ages,&quot; but concluded that it had &quot;a strong script, good performances, and solid direction.&quot; Sukanya Varma of &quot;Rediff.com&quot; criticised Chopra for repeating content from his previous films, while appreciating the performances and finally writes, &quot;if you are a fan of the Chopra factory of filmmaking and looking for plenty of eye-candy, &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; promises to make your Diwali a happy one.&quot; In another review for &quot;The Times of India&quot;, Teena Malik heavily criticised it in agreement with Verma for repetition of content, and labelled the film &quot;horrifying&quot;.

====International====
Anita Gates of &quot;New York Times&quot; writes that &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; &quot;would be embraced as fabulously trashy&quot; had it been an American film but credits the cultural impact, writing, &quot;the cultural assumptions of Veer and Zaara add a welcome element of freshness for American audiences. When Zaara&#x27;s mother reminds her daughter that women always love fully, with heart and soul, she casually adds, &quot;Men don&#x27;t have the strength to love like that.&quot; Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; observes that while it does not have &quot;technique and production sheen&quot; as recent Hindi films, &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot;″s &quot;in-depth star casting and thorough entertainment values&quot; make it a &quot;must-see&quot; for Indian filmgoers. Maitland McDonagh of &quot;TV Guide&quot; wrote, &quot;Though Chopra&#x27;s film is emotionally extravagant even by the standards of India&#x27;s epically unrestrained cinema, the star-crossed lovers bear the weighty metaphorical significance of their travails surprisingly lightly, particularly Zinta&#x27;s radiantly lovely Zaara.&quot; Jonathan Curiel of &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; was particularly fond of the film, finding the movie experience &quot;so arresting, its scenes so full of beauty and colors, that the three hours go by almost too fast&quot;. He further noted that unlike other Hindi films, it deserves a wider audience for portraying &quot;the humanity in characters who represent &#x27;the other&#x27;&quot;, done &quot;in a way that&#x27;s dramatic, funny, fun, silly, musical, stylish, romantic and redemptive&quot;.

Carrie R. Wheadon of &quot;Common Sense Media&quot; gives it four stars out of five and rates it as 11+, writing, &quot;Those who watch can&#x27;t miss the pleas for understanding and peace between India and Pakistan or the film&#x27;s strong support of equality for women.&quot; She compliments the picturization of the songs, opening, &quot;Even the slower love songs will hold viewers, especially as Zaara dreams about seeing Veer everywhere while she prepares for her wedding.&quot; Manish Gajjar of &quot;BBC&quot; commented, &quot;&quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; has a great storyline with some unpredictable twists and emotions, keeping you engrossed throughout.&quot;

==Re-releases==
Subsequent re-releases from 2004 to 2023 added 3 crore, pushing its lifetime gross over 100 crore mark. Further, it turned out to be a huge success during its re-release in India in the month of September 2024, where it grossed around 3.75 crore. 

An extended version of &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; was released on 600 screens in international markets. The film performed very well and raked over 305K (2.55 crore) overseas, taking the total worldwide gross box office collections, including all the theatrical runs to 1.07 billion.

<text>Inner Austria (; ; ) was a term used from the late 14th to the early 17th century for the Habsburg hereditary lands south of the Semmering Pass, referring to the Imperial duchies of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola and the lands of the Austrian Littoral. The residence of the Inner Austrian archdukes and stadtholders was at the &quot;Burg&quot; castle complex in Graz.

==Geography==
The Inner Austrian territory stretched from the northern border with the Archduchy of Austria on the Alpine divide over Upper and Lower Styria down to Carniola, where the Lower and White Carniolan lands (the former Windic March) bordered on the Habsburg Kingdom of Croatia. In the west, the Carinthian lands stretched to the Archbishopric of Salzburg and the Habsburg County of Tyrol, while in the east, the Mur River formed the border with the Kingdom of Hungary.

In the south, the County of Görz, which had passed to the House of Habsburg in 1500, and Duino (&quot;Tybein&quot;) bordered on the &quot;Domini di Terraferma&quot; of Venice. The Imperial Free City of Trieste on the Adriatic Coast linked to assorted smaller possessions in the March of Istria around Pazin and the free port of Rijeka (later &quot;corpus separatum&quot; of Fiume) in Liburnia.

==History==

The Styrian lands had already been ruled in personal union by the Babenberg dukes of Austria since 1192 and were finally seized with the Austrian lands by the Habsburg king Rudolph I of Germany upon his victory in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld. In 1335 Rudolph&#x27;s grandson Duke Albert II of Austria also received the Carinthian duchy with the adjacent March of Carniola at the hands of Emperor Louis the Bavarian as Imperial fiefs.

When in 1365 Albert&#x27;s son Duke Rudolf IV of Austria suddenly died at the age of 26, Emperor Charles IV enfeoffed his younger brothers Albert III with the Pigtail and Leopold III the Just, who however began to quarrel about the Habsburg heritage. By the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg they finally split late Rudolf&#x27;s territories: The elder Albertinian line would rule in the Archduchy of Austria proper (then sometimes referred to as &quot;Lower Austria&quot; (&quot;Niederösterreich&quot;), but comprising modern Lower Austria and most of Upper Austria), while the younger Leopoldian line ruled the Styrian, Carinthian and Carniolan duchies, then subsumed under the denotation of &quot;Inner Austria&quot;. At that time their share also comprised Tyrol and the original Habsburg possessions in Swabia, called Further Austria; both collectively referred to as &quot;Upper Austria&quot; (&quot;Oberösterreich&quot;) in that context, also not to be confused with the modern state of that name.

When Leopold III was killed in the 1386 Battle of Sempach against the Old Swiss Confederacy, the Leopoldian heritage fell to his eldest son Duke William the Courteous, who upon the death of his uncle Albert III in 1395 also raised claims to the Archduchy of Austria against Albert&#x27;s only son and heir Duke Albert IV. Both sides came to an agreement to maintain the Neuberg division but also to assert the common rule over the Habsburg lands. Therefore, from 1404 William acted as Austrian regent for his minor nephew Albert V. The Tyrolean and Further Austrian lands passed to William&#x27;s younger brother Duke Leopold IV the Fat. When Duke William died without issue in 1406, the Leopoldian line was further split among his younger brothers: while Leopold IV assumed the regency in Austria, the Inner Austrian territories passed to Ernest the Iron, while the Tyrolean/Further Austrian passed to the youngest brother Frederick of the Empty Pockets.

In 1457 the Leopoldian line again could assume the rule over the Austrian archduchy, when Ernest&#x27;s son Duke Frederick V of Inner Austria succeeded his Albertine cousin Ladislaus the Posthumous who had died without issue. 1490 saw the reunification of all Habsburg lines, when Archduke Sigismund of Further Austria and Tyrol resigned in favour of Frederick&#x27;s son Maximilian I. In 1512, the Habsburg territories were incorporated into the Imperial Austrian Circle.

The dynasty however was split up again in 1564 among the children of deceased Emperor Ferdinand I of Habsburg. Under the Inner Austrian line founded by his younger son Archduke Charles II, the lands became a centre of the Counter-Reformation, carried out by the Jesuits with great determination. The cadet branch prevailed again, when Charles&#x27; son and successor as regent of Inner Austria, Archduke Ferdinand II, was crowned King of Bohemia in 1617, King of Hungary in 1618, and finally succeeded his cousin Matthias in the Archduchy of Austria (as Ferdinand III) and as Holy Roman Emperor in 1619. His intentions to translate the absolutist and anti-reformationist Inner Austrian policies to the Crown of Bohemia sparked the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

The Further Austrian/Tyrolean line of Ferdinand&#x27;s younger brother Archduke Leopold V survived until the death of his son Sigismund Francis in 1665, whereafter all territories ultimately returned to common control with the other Austrian Habsburg lands. The political administration of Inner Austria was centralized at Graz in 1763. Inner Austrian stadtholders went on to rule until the days of Empress Maria Theresa in the 18th century.

<doc id="1223693" wikidata="Q1520062" url="?curid=1223693" title="Lambay Island">
<text>Lambay Island (), often simply Lambay, is an island in the Irish Sea off the coast of north County Dublin, Ireland. The largest island off the east coast of Ireland, it is offshore from the headland at Portrane, and is the easternmost point of the province of Leinster. Of volcanic origin, it has been inhabited since the prehistoric period and has been the subject of multiple archaeological studies. Lambay has notable populations of seabirds, a range of local fauna, some not found elsewhere in Ireland, and a colony of wallabies, as well as more than 300 plant varieties, and was the subject of major studies of flora and bird, and a major multidisciplinary study of flora and fauna between 1905 and 1907. The island is privately owned by a trust for members of certain branches of the Baring family and managed by the current Baron Revelstoke. It has a very small permanent population and few buildings but hosts some day visitors and short-stay guests, and there is a working farm.

==Etymology==
The name &#x27;Lambay&#x27; comes from Old Norse &quot;Lamb ey&quot; meaning &quot;lamb island&quot;. The name probably originated from the practice of sending ewes to the island in Spring so they could lamb in a predator-free environment. A similar place name is Lamba in Shetland.

The Irish name for the island is &quot;Reachrainn&quot;, which is also the Irish name for Rathlin Island. The coastal settlement of Portrane faces Lambay and its name comes from &quot;Port Reachrann&quot;, the &quot;port of Reachrainn&quot;.

==Geography==
Lambay Island is the largest island off the east coast of Ireland. It covers about . The highest point – a hill known as Knockbane – rises to . The island&#x27;s high ground lies to the east and aside from Knockbane includes Heath Hill and Tinian Hill, and in the extreme northeast, Pilot&#x27;s Hill. Steep cliffs lie along the northern, eastern, and southern coasts of the island, while the western side has low-lying land and gentle slopes. Due to the island&#x27;s topography and exposure to weather, the western shore is where almost all of the island&#x27;s buildings are located – the Castle, coastguard cottages and guest residences, and the Catholic chapel – as well as the only harbour, while two cottages exist on hillier ground.

The island has eight named bays and a few narrow inlets, and the easternmost point is Lambay Head. The bays are, running counter-clockwise from the harbour, Talbot&#x27;s Bay, named for a former owner, Carnoon Bay, Bishop&#x27;s Bay, Sunk Island Bay, Tayleur Bay, Freshwater Bay, Saltpan Bay and Broad Bay. Inlets include Seal Hole. There is a sandy beach by the harbour, and several small rocky strands on the steeper coasts.

===Geology===
The island is of volcanic origin, and its basic geology is Lambay Volcanic Formation, mostly igneous rocks. Bedrock is a mix of andesite, tuff (from volcanic ash) and mudstone, as well as breccia, but there are beds of shales and limestones also, and loamy soil. The andesite, present across the whole area of Lambay, is primarily of the specific type &quot;Lambay porphyry&quot;.

===Hydrology===
A small number of wells, springs and small streams are fed by aquifers, topped up by rainfall and so varying seasonally. The wells include Trinity Well near the peak of Knockbane, and Raven Well near the central-eastern cliffs; there was also historically a spring near Raven&#x27;s Well, another near the castle, and a well near Carnoon Bay. A small stream flows down into Carnoon Bay and a slightly larger into Freshwater Bay. There was also a stream to Seal Hole, which at least once had three rivulets meeting, one from Raven Well and two from marshy patches nearby, and finally, there was a flow from the vicinity of the castle to the sea near the harbour.

=== Demographics ===
The island of Ireland has 258 sometime-inhabited islands but Lambay is one of only five of these which lie off the eastern coast. The Copeland Islands off the coast of County Down are the only other islands off the east coast which remain inhabited as of 2020. The population has ranged from reports of over 140 to as few as 3. The table below reports data on Lambay&#x27;s population taken from &quot;Discover the Islands of Ireland&quot; (Alex Ritsema, Collins Press, 1999) and the census of Ireland. Census data in Ireland before 1841 are not considered complete and/or reliable. 
==Administration and designations==
Lambay Island forms a townland in the civil parish of Portraine, in the barony of Nethercross, within the modern county of Fingal and in the traditional County Dublin.

For electoral purposes, it is in the electoral division of Donabate, within the Swords ward for local authority polls, and the Dublin Fingal constituency for national elections.

The island, a Natura-2000 site, has both Special Protection Area (SPA) and Special Area of Conservation (SAC) designations, as well as being a pNHA. The island is also wholly enclosed by the &quot;Rockabill to Dalkey Island SAC&quot; which references reef communities and harbour porpoises.

There are, as of 2020, 26 National Monuments (sites on the Record of Monuments and Places), and one possible site.

==Flora and fauna==
The island was discovered to hold 90 species not seen elsewhere in Ireland, and 5 new to science, when studied in 1905–1906.

===Flora===
The island is home to 308 plant types. However, surveys have found that 33 are invasive species that have arisen as weeds from agriculture or horticulture.

===Fauna===

The island supports one of the largest seabird colonies in Ireland, with more than 50,000 common guillemots, 5,000 kittiwakes, 3,500 razorbills, 2,500 pairs of herring gulls, as well as smaller numbers of puffins, Manx shearwaters, fulmars, and greylag geese.

North Atlantic sea mammals such as grey seals annually pup on the island. The island has a substantial population of rabbits. Ireland&#x27;s most common rodent, the brown rat is present, as is Ireland&#x27;s only self-sustaining long-term population of the black rat, with the presence of the former keeping the numbers of the latter under control.

Rockabill and Lambay islands are the best places in County Dublin to see harbour porpoises.

The island also possesses some uncommon invertebrates – the major survey in 1905-1906 discovered species new to science. Among these were three species of earthworm (including &quot;Henlea hibernica&quot;), a bristletail (&quot;Praemachilis hibernica&quot;) and a mite (&quot;Trachyuropoda hibernica&quot;). The earthworm aspect of the study found 34 species, of which 18 were previously unseen in Ireland, including the three new to science as a whole, and noted that the average size of specimens was smaller than on the mainland by a material amount. A degree of local variation was also noted, and for example, one type was particularly prominent near the Raven&#x27;s Well.

===Domestic and non-native fauna===
There are also non-native red-necked wallabies, introduced by Rupert Baring in the 1950s, and augmented by a surplus from Dublin Zoo in the 1980s, numbering perhaps around 100 in 2017. The wallabies breed well, and some moderate culling is required to keep the population under control. Fallow deer were introduced, and by the mid-2000s formed a herd of about 200. There is also a herd of farmed cattle on the island, and a flock of sheep.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The island was of some significance in the Neolithic period in Ireland as a ground stone quarrying and production site for axes. Two outcrops of andesite, or &quot;Lambay porphyry&quot; as the specific rock variety is more commonly known, were utilised. The quarry site is unusual in Ireland for being the only Neolithic stone axe quarry with evidence for all stages of production, from quarrying to final polishing.

===Classical period===
In the 1st century AD the Ancient Roman writer Pliny knew about the island and referred to it as &quot;Limnus&quot; or &quot;Limni&quot;. Its Irish name, &quot;Reachra&quot;, was eventually joined by a Norse name based on the root word &quot;ey&quot; for island. A number of Iron Age burials were discovered on the island in 1927, during works on the island&#x27;s harbour. The finds included a number of Romano-British items, and the site has been interpreted as possible evidence for the arrival of a small group of refugees from Brigantia, fleeing the Romans from 71 to 74AD.

Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; in the 2nd century AD may have been describing Lambay when it mentions Εδρου (&quot;Edrou&quot;). PIE *&quot;sed&quot;- &#x27;to sit, settle&#x27; had descendants in many languages, including Greek ἑδρα (&quot;hedra&quot;) &#x27;sitting place&#x27; whose many specific uses included &#x27;base for ships&#x27;.

===Early Medieval ===
St. Columba is reputed to have established a monastic settlement on Lambay  530 AD, which passed to Colman and a line of successor abbots and at least one bishop. The religious settlement was raided by Vikings in 795, resulting in the church and buildings being ransacked and burned. Surveys in the early 20th century found remains of an enclosure to the south of the present chapel, and these, and modern satellite photography, suggested it was a moated site.

===Late Medieval===
Sitric, a Danish King of Dublin, granted Lambay to Christ Church Cathedral, and in 1181 Prince John granted it to the Archbishops of Dublin. This was reconfirmed by King Edward in 1337 and by King Richard in 1394. A later archbishop gave the rents of the island to the nuns of the Augustine Grace Dieu Abbey and school near Swords for the upkeep of their establishment. He also gave the tithes of Lambay&#x27;s rabbits to the nuns – at that time the rabbit taxes were worth 100 shillings a year.

In 1467, it was provided by statute that the Earl of Worcester, then Lord Deputy, be granted Lambay to build a fortress for England&#x27;s protection against the Spaniards, French and Scots. Worcester paid the Archbishop of Dublin 40 shillings per annum and though he had a licence to build a castle on Lambay it is not certain that any fortification was actually built.

===Early modern===
During the English Reformation in the mid 16th century, George Browne, the English Augustinian Archbishop of Dublin gave Lambay to John Challoner, the first Secretary of State for Ireland, for a rent of £6.13.4. The conditions were that Challoner would within six years build a village, castle and harbour for the benefit of fishermen and as a protection against smugglers. He was to inhabit Lambay &quot;with a colony of honest men&quot;. He was a very active man who worked four mines for silver and copper and bred falcons on the island&#x27;s many cliffs. During this period, Lambay Castle – a small blockhouse or fort – was built on the western side of the island.

Throughout most of the reign of Elizabeth I, Challoner owned Lambay but in 1611 the island was granted to Sir William Ussher and his heirs. James Ussher, later the Anglican Archbishop of Armagh, took up residence on Lambay in 1626. By 1650 he had moved to London; he was highly respected by Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell and was buried in Westminster Abbey. The island remained in the possession of the Ussher family, renting from the Church of Ireland See of Dublin, under Crown tenure, for 200 years.

During the Williamite war in Ireland, the island was used as an internment camp for Irish soldiers. More than one thousand of them were imprisoned there after the Battle of Aughrim in 1691; some died of wounds and starvation.

In the 17th century, exploratory mining was again undertaken on the island but it did not develop into an industrial activity.

===Georgian and Victorian era===
In 1805, the leasehold of Lambay was inherited by Sir William Wolseley, and in 1814 it was acquired by the aristocratic Talbot family of Malahide. In the period following the Talbot de Malahide acquisition both a Catholic chapel and a national (primary) school were built.

On 21 January 1854, the iron-hulled RMS &quot;Tayleur&quot; struck the island&#x27;s rocks and sank just hours into her maiden voyage from Liverpool to Perth, Australia. It was chartered by the White Star Line and was one of the largest merchant ships of her day. Of the 650 people on board, mostly families emigrating, 380 people died, though most of the 71 crew survived. The ship&#x27;s crew, only 37 being trained seamen, thought they were sailing south when in fact they were heading west, partly due to problems with the compass and the mass of iron in the ship. There were also language issues, with many of the crew being Chinese with little English, and unable to fully understand the commanding officers.

In 1860 the existing farmers were removed by the Talbot family, who wanted to make the island a dedicated hunting ground, though they were later replaced with English and Scottish tenants. After selling his property, Portrane House, on the mainland nearby, Count James Consedine bought Lambay in 1888 to develop the island as a hunting retreat.

===Baring family===
In April 1904, Lambay was bought from a Mrs Parr by Cecil Baring, later 3rd Baron Revelstoke, a member of the Baring banking family, and a director in the New York office. Baring, also a classical scholar and naturalist, noticed it advertised for sale in The Field and bought it – for either £5,250 or £9,000 – for himself and his new bride, Maude, daughter of tobacco millionaire Pierre Lorillard IV.

The island&#x27;s main residence was in poor condition, so Cecil brought the prominent architect Sir Edwin Lutyens to see it in 1905, and later hired him to work on its renovation. Lutyens supervised rebuilding and extension in the Arts and Crafts style, completing the first works by 1910 and became a family friend, returning there throughout the remainder of his life, adding to his architectural designs, and guiding construction and renovation in multiple locations over the course of 30 years or so. Aside from the castle, these works included the dwelling known as the White House and a family mausoleum. Cecil Baring and Lutyens engaged Gertrude Jekyll to work on tree planting, notably of sycamores, and the gardens near the castle.

Cecil Baring, who inherited his brother&#x27;s title of &quot;Lord Revelstoke&quot; in April 1929, lived on the island till his death in 1934. He and his wife Maude are buried in the family mausoleum on Lambay, along with their son Rupert Baring, and grandsons John and James Baring. The mausoleum, which was also designed by Lutyens, forms part of the circular rampart wall around the Castle and is engraved with a poem Cecil wrote in memory of Maude when she died.

Rupert Baring was born just after the island residence was completed, in 1911, and Edwin Lutyens was his godfather and a major figure in his childhood, later explaining many of his architectural principles to the future Lord Revelstoke. Rupert, an episode of whose life was filmed as &quot;The Duchess of Duke Street&quot;, only worked two years in the family business; the branch of the family holding the island had no further involvement with Barings Bank after the 1920s. Rupert managed the island from 1934 to 1994, and in the 1980s he created a family trust to hold the island for his close relatives and descendants. 
Rupert was succeeded in the title by his two sons in turn: John and James Cecil. James, who had done pioneering work in Internet technology, engaged with a team of consultants to develop a concept for the island as a base for testing of renewable energy technology, including tidal power generation, and for associated education and hospitality business potential.

James was succeeded by his eldest son, Alexander &quot;Alex&quot; Rupert, in 2012. Alexander Baring commented that he was engaged but isolated island life led to a break-off, but he subsequently married and lives there with his wife and small children. The island is managed with the aid of a small staff. Having been overseen by a cousin, Margaret Kelly, from 1994 to 2012, it is now managed directly by Lord Revelstoke and his half-sister Millie (Miranda) Baring.

===New strategy, 2011===
After a warning about the depletion of its cash funding from the estate trust in 2012, and discussions in 2012 and 2013, a revised plan for the island&#x27;s operations was put into play. This included a planning application in 2013 for modifications to the castle, which at that time had just one working toilet. The works proposed, noted by the architects as respecting the island&#x27;s architecture and ambience, included the conversion of two rooms to bathrooms, the installation of a modern heating system, new freshwater and wastewater systems, a new wind turbine and some solar panels. It was noted that limitations on electrical storage capacity meant that there was only power enough for essential lighting, refrigeration and a single washing machine for the island, along with basic communication, and no capacity for most powered kitchen equipment, or even hair-dryers or a tumble-dryer. The application drew objections from several non-resident members of the family, who felt that it was too commercial in nature, and did not take enough account of the conservation needs of the buildings. Following discussions with Fingal County Council, permission was subsequently granted with conditions.

In 2015, a supporting club was launched, and a whiskey project developed. In subsequent years both accommodation and visiting arrangements were relaunched. In September 2018 Prince Edward visited the island and attended a dinner there.

====Whiskey project====
A special-purpose company for the whiskey project, which in a later phase may lead to the island&#x27;s first industrial facility, a small distillery, was registered in February 2017. It is a joint venture between the island&#x27;s holding company and the Camus Cognac family, which also had discussions with the owners of Slane Castle, who also launched a whiskey brand. The whiskey is produced in Ireland, with water added from one of the island&#x27;s Trinity Well, and some batches are matured on the island. The Lambay Island Whiskey brand was launched on the Irish market, with a boat trip towards Lambay and an event in Howth, in April 2018. The venture posted a 1.2 million euro loss for 2018 but had built up inventory of around 3 million euro, and was distributing through international duty free and national market channels, primarily in the US. Further launches have followed, including in Moscow, Russia, and the brand has also sponsored a local boat race.

Application for planning permission for a micro-distillery for whiskey and gin, for small batch production in spring and autumn when the island&#x27;s water supply is strongest, was made in 2019, and approved in principle, subject to clarification around waste disposal.

==Archaeology==
The island has been the subject of archaeological study over decades and on many occasions. One area of special study fell within the Irish Stone Axe project and included digs of between two weeks and two months from 1993 to 2001. This identified a stone axe factory, using Lambay porphyry, near the centre of the island, and also made findings about burial of neolithic pottery and flint.

Multiple human burial sites have also been found and the remains of at least two promontory forts.

==Wrecks==
There are around fifty wrecks in the waters around Lambay. The RMS Tayleur, under 18 metres of water around 40 metres off the southeastern coast, is the one most often dived, but such dives do require a licence from the National Monuments Branch of the Office of Public Works, as the wreck is over 100 years old. Another notable wreck is that of &quot;The Shamrock&quot;, under the stream at Freshwater Bay, north of Carrickdorish Rock; sunk in 1916, this ship carried phosphorus shells and explosives, and steps were cut in the rock nearby to facilitate the salvage and removal of these. Other wrecks include, on the northern coast, &quot;The Strathey&quot;, a steamship lost in 1900, and a 1920s loss just beyond Harp Ear.

==Religion==
After St Columba (Colmcille) from Ulster reputedly established a monastic settlement on Lambay in the 6th century, he passed its rule to Colman McRoi, later also a saint. Some sources state that Colman, who is venerated by Catholic, Anglican and Orthodox churches, actually founded the monastery on what was then called Reachrain, with Colmcille&#x27;s blessing. Colman has his feast day on 16 June. The monastery endured for over two centuries and at least one of its abbots also held the rank of Bishop. It was raided in the first recorded attack by Vikings on Ireland, in 795. It ceases to be recorded thereafter.

In 1833, a new chapel was built under the auspices of the Catholic Church at Rush, with the permission of the Talbots of Malahide. The Talbots also contributed financially. The chapel was consecrated in a major local event. Tragically some people died on the return of boats to the mainland after the event. The chapel functioned for all Christians on the island thereafter. It was modified with Doric columns by Edwin Lutyens in the 1910s. It is still attended by the Baring family and other island residents on Sundays.

==Buildings==
===Lambay Castle===

A small late 16th-century fort with battlemented gables, possibly incorporating a 15th-century blockhouse, was transformed by Sir Edwin Lutyens into a romantic castle for the Hon. Cecil Baring, afterwards 3rd Lord Revelstoke. Baring had been working in the US when he fell in love with the wife of one of his co-directors. She divorced her husband and married Baring. He bought the island for £5,250 in 1904 as a place to escape to with his young wife, Maude Louise Lorillard, the daughter of Pierre Lorillard, the tobacco millionaire, and the first American to win The Derby.

The story of Cecil and Maude&#x27;s early life on the island inspired Julian Slade&#x27;s musical &quot;Free as Air&quot;.
Lutyens made the old fort habitable and built a quadrangle of kitchens, bathrooms and extra bedrooms adjoining it, with roofs of grey Dutch pantiles sweeping down almost to the ground. He also built a circular curtain wall or enceinte surrounding the castle and its garden, with a bastioned gateway; this wall serves the practical purpose of a windbreak, enabling trees and plants to grow inside which would not grow outside. Everything is of a silvery grey stone. The rooms in the castle have vaulted ceilings and stone fireplaces; there is a stone staircase with many curves and an underground gallery in the new quadrangle. The work was of high quality but one small omission led to problems after a few years, namely a lack of rainwater channels.

===The White House===
Close to the harbour is the White House, a roughly horse-shoe shaped house with high roofs and whitewashed walls, which Lutyens designed in the 1930s for Lord Revelstoke&#x27;s daughters Daphne and Calypso and their families, while the castle and island were left to his only son Rupert Baring.

===Coastguard cottages===
A row of small cottages, once for guards, and later used by coastguards, is also near the harbour. At least one is, as of 2020, available for rental.

===Harbour and approach===
Lutyens also designed the approach from the harbour, with curved step-like terraces reminiscent of the now-vanished Ripetta in Rome and a series of ellipses, circles being a long-standing symbol of welcome and also of wholeness. Characteristically, having ascended those Baroque steps, one has to cross an open field to come to the curtain wall, the entrance gateway not being at first visible.

===Chapel===
On a small cliff-top near the White House is a 19th-century Roman Catholic chapel. It has a portico of tapering stone columns, added by Lutyens, and a barrel-vaulted ceiling. Inside are various religious symbols and artefacts made by members of the family, including the little stained-glass window.

===National school===
The school building was located within the castle&#x27;s curtilage, on a path from the castle to the harbour. At peak operations, in the 1840s, it had 40 children enrolled.

==Operations today==
The island is still privately owned by the Revelstoke Trust, a discretionary Baring family trust. Alex and Brooke Baring and their children and a small staff are, as of 2020, the only permanent residents, sometimes joined by Miranda Baring. There is an estate unlimited company, a company limited by guarantee for the supporting club, and a company for the whiskey project. The estate company has as directors the current Lord and a cousin, the botanist and Director of the National Botanic Gardens of Ireland, Matthew Jebb as well as a House of Lords assistant, while the club company has as directors Alex and Miranda Baring.

The estate includes domestic extensions to the old Castle, farm buildings, a row of former Coast Guard (Revenue Police) cottages, a larger house called &quot;the Bothy&quot;, the &quot;White House&quot; (a family guesthouse), the sole harbour with its boathouse, and a distinctive open-air real tennis court, the only one remaining in Ireland (there was one in the old University College Dublin complex on Earlsfort Terrace, adjacent to the National Concert Hall, in the part scheduled to be part of the Experimentation Station). There is a Roman Catholic chapel located on an isolated promontory southwest of the castle. All architecture was either designed or renovated by Sir Edwin Lutyens.

===The farm===
There is a farm, working without pesticides or chemicals, and with Galloway cows and a flock of sheep. Following previous ventures with sheep, including the Mayo Mule breed, the current flock is a cross of Texan and Blackface Mountain. It meets organic standards except for certain veterinary aspects, and is operated, under a REPS scheme, so as to disturb native flora and fauna as little as possible. It has operated as an agritourism destination, and accepted WWOOFers as volunteers. The farm operation also works with the island&#x27;s fallow deer and wallabies.

There is a reference to seaweed processing in past times, but no significant use of kelp or seaweed is mentioned in recent times, other than the fallow deer eating it.

===Energy===
The island has no power or communication cables from the mainland, and about 75% of its energy needs are supplied by solar panels, supported by a wind turbine, and with limited battery capacity and a backup generator system.

===Access and guest accommodation===
The island is accessible by invitation only, as of 2020 mainly from the marina at Malahide, and occasionally from Rogerstown Estuary, where the Trust owns a pier and associated building at the southwestern edge of Rush, as well as other launching points in Rush, and Skerries Harbour, all lying north of Dublin Bay. There is a half-kilometre airstrip, which can be used by light aeroplanes of up to six seats, and landing places for helicopters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lambay Island Club / About Us&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Since at least 2016 there has been a cottage available to rent, and the White House is available for larger groups known to the family and for retreats and corporate training events.

===The Island Club===
Around 2015 a supporters club was established. This was for people who believed in the island&#x27;s importance for heritage and wildlife, and who wanted to meet with like-minded people, and retreat from busy city life. A small group of pioneer members was joined by Irish politician Conor Lenihan. Lenihan had had experience promoting Russia&#x27;s &quot;constructed technopark&quot; – a sort of mini-Silicon Valley. The club has multiple levels of membership and promotes &quot;think ins&quot; and &quot;off-grid breaks&quot; for members. It has links to the Century Club in Soho, London.

==Sport and leisure==
===Real tennis===
There is a real tennis court on the shore near the harbour. It was built in 1922 and is one of only two remaining in Ireland, and the only accessible one.

===Visiting / walking groups===
While the island is not open to casual visiting or landing of boats, groups with interests in gardening, architecture and birds are facilitated, weather permitting, and walking tours have been arranged for some years by a boatman operating Skerries Sea Tours with his family.

===Aquasports===
Due to its deep surrounding waters, the island attracts scuba divers and fishermen, as well as lobster-potters.

===Other sports===
There is a disused lawn tennis court and there was a small golf course also.

The winners of the 1921 Gordon Bennett Gas Balloon Race managed to land on Lambay after taking off from Brussels, Belgium. Captains Paul Armbruster and Louis Ansermier, from Switzerland, landed on the island after flying at a maximum altitude of during a flight of 27 hours and 23 minutes.

==Popular culture==
According to the Revelstoke records on the island, Lambay Castle is the location where Michael Powell wrote his screenplay for Black Narcissus (1947).

<text>A qualified domestic relations order (or QDRO, pronounced &quot;cue-dro&quot; or &quot;qua-dro&quot;), is a judicial order in the United States, entered as part of a property division in a divorce or legal separation that splits a retirement plan or pension plan by recognizing joint marital ownership interests in the plan, specifically the former spouse&#x27;s interest in that spouse&#x27;s share of the asset. A QDRO&#x27;s recognition of spousal ownership interest in a plan participant&#x27;s (employee&#x27;s) pension plan awards a portion of the plan participant&#x27;s benefit to an alternate payee. An alternate payee must be a spouse, former spouse, child or other dependent of the plan participant. A QDRO may also be entered for spousal support or child support.

QDROs apply only to employee benefit or pension plans subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), the American federal law governing private sector pensions. Comparable types of orders divide military retirement pay and federal civil service retirement plans, and for State, county and municipal retirement plans in most States. A QDRO may provide for marital or community property division between the plan participant and the alternate payee, or for the payment of alimony or child support to the alternate payee.

QDROs must first be issued by a State-level domestic relations court, and are then reviewed by plan administrators for compliance with the terms of the plan and with ERISA or other applicable law. The QDRO may be a separate document or it may be part of a divorce decree, and is valid as long as it meets the standards for a &quot;qualified&quot; domestic relations order under ERISA and meets the standards of the plan to which it applies. Courts have jurisdiction to declare a QDRO &quot;qualified&quot; as comporting with federal law, but pension plan administrators must determine whether a QDRO meets the requirements of a specific pension plan.

==Definition==

A Qualified Domestic Relations Order is a domestic relations order which creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee&#x27;s right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a qualified plan (i.e. employer-sponsored). A domestic relations order is qualified by a plan administrator upon the plan administrator&#x27;s determination that the order meets the plan&#x27;s rules for segregation. Such orders do not relate to plans &quot;not&quot; covered by ERISA.

A domestic relations order is any judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement) which (1) relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant, and (2) is made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including a community property law).

An alternate payee must meet ERISA&#x27;s definition of an alternate payee - any spouse, former spouse, child or other dependent of a plan participant who is recognized by a domestic relations order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the benefits payable under a plan with respect to such participant. Most States will allow QDROs to be entered to collect both past due and future child support payments.

===Plans not covered by ERISA===

Examples of retirement plans &quot;not&quot; covered by ERISA include military retirement pay (covered by the Uniformed Services Former Spouses&#x27; Protection Act), State and Municipal retirement plans, Federal Retirement Plans (the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)), Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) (SEP-IRA, SIMPLE IRA and Keogh plan), and most deferred compensation plans. However, a QDRO &quot;can&quot; be used to divide an IRA because it is a &quot;divorce or separation instrument described in subsection (A) of section 71(b)(2)&quot; under Internal Revenue Code section 408(d)(6).

==Valuation of the distributive award==

There are several methods of determining of each party&#x27;s share of the plan benefit. One of the relevant factors is whether or not the participant was already enrolled in the plan prior to the marriage. If plan participation post-dates the date of the marriage, each party&#x27;s share is (usually) 50% of the participant&#x27;s benefit value as of the date of the commencement of the divorce action, execution of a stipulation of settlement agreeing to the distribution, separation, or entry of the divorce judgment (whichever date is earliest or agreed upon by the parties to the divorce).

If plan participation pre-dates the marriage, some States use the &quot;Majauskas&quot;, or &quot;coverture&quot; formula. A distributive ratio is established by dividing the duration of the marriage (in months) by the duration of plan participation (in months). Using such a formula, the alternate payee&#x27;s share is therefore proportionate to the length of the marriage while the plan participant was covered by the plan, and may be subject to negotiation and set-offs from distribution of other marital property. The remaining fraction of the plan benefit accrues to the plan participant.

==Requirements for the Order==

The court order for a QDRO must comply with three general sets of rules, namely, (1) the requirements of the plan itself, (2A) the requirements of ERISA, which are essentially parallel to (2B) the requirements of the U.S. tax code, and (3) the domestic relations law of the applicable state:
* Comportment with and citation to the applicable State domestic relations law. Applicable State law and its standards is specific to each state, for example, with respect to New York&#x27;s Domestic Relations Law § 236, the distribution must be &quot;equitable&quot; (fair).
* U.S. tax code. Preservation of any tax deferred status of the plan benefit is the responsibility of the movant.
* The Internal Revenue Code contains requirements that are essentially parallel to those in ERISA, e.g., the method of distribution must be selected from among the options available to the plan participant, according to the terms of the plan, and the order may not require the plan to distribute a participant&#x27;s benefit in a manner inconsistent with the plan&#x27;s terms.

All QDROs must contain certain information: 
* The formal name of the plan,
* The full name and last known mailing address of the participant, employee or contributor (variously referred to as the &quot;Plan Participant&quot;, &quot;Payee&quot;, or &quot;Distributee&quot;), and the &quot;Alternate Payee&quot; (spouse, former spouse, or other payee),
* Social Security numbers of both parties, (which for privacy purposes are often provided to the plan administrator under separate cover),
* Participant&#x27;s plan identification number if different from the participant&#x27;s Social Security number,
* The amount or portion of the plan benefit payable to the alternate payee and the method to be used to calculate such amount, and
* For a defined benefit plan, the duration for which the benefit is payable to the alternate payee.

<text>Franklin Van Valkenburgh (April 5, 1888 – December 7, 1941) was an American naval officer who served as the last captain of the . He was killed when the &quot;Arizona&quot; exploded and sank during the attack on Pearl Harbor.

==Early life==
Born in Minneapolis, Van Valkenburgh moved to Milwaukee when he was a toddler. His father was a prominent lawyer also named Franklin Van Valkenburgh, who served as Milwaukee assistant city attorney and a U.S. attorney for Wisconsin. His great-grandmother&#x27;s brother was Daniel Wells Jr., who represented Wisconsin&#x27;s 1st Congressional District in the 1850s. His mother was Jane Irvin Swoope, daughter of H.B. Swoope, a U.S. attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the grandson of Captain Peter Swoope, Sr. an 18th Century pioneer of Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. Her brother was William Swoope, a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1923 to 1927. He grew up on Milwaukee&#x27;s east side, attending Cass Elementary School and graduating from East Side High School, later renamed Riverside High School.

==Military service==
Franklin Van Valkenburgh was appointed a midshipman at the United States Naval Academy on September 15, 1905, and graduated on June 4, 1909. After service in the battleship and in , Van Valkenburgh was commissioned ensign on June 5, 1911. Traveling to the Asiatic Station soon thereafter, he joined the submarine tender at Olongapo, Philippine Islands, on September 11. He reported to the gunboat as executive officer on June 23, 1914, for a short tour in the southern Philippines before his detachment on August 4.

After returning to the United States, Lt. (jg.) Van Valkenburgh joined on November 11. Following postgraduate work in steam engineering at the Naval Academy in September 1915, he took further instruction in that field at Columbia University before reporting to on March 2, 1917. The entry of the United States into World War I found Van Valkenburgh serving as the battleship&#x27;s engineering officer. Subsequent temporary duty in the receiving ship at New York preceded his first tour as an instructor at the Naval Academy. On June 1, 1920, Van Valkenburgh reported on board for duty as engineer officer, and he held that post until the battleship was decommissioned in November 1921.

He again served as an instructor at the Naval Academy—until May 15, 1925—before he joined on June 26. Commissioned commander on June 2, 1927, while in &quot;Maryland&quot;, he soon reported for duty in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations on May 21, 1928, and served there during the administrations of Admirals Charles F. Hughes and William V. Pratt. Detached on June 28, 1931, Van Valkenburgh received command of the destroyer on July 10, and commanded Destroyer Squadron 5 from March 31, 1932.

After attending the Naval War College, Newport, R.I., and completing the senior course in May 1934, Comdr. Van Valkenburgh next served as inspector of naval materiel at the New York Navy Yard before going to sea again as commanding officer of from June 8, 1936, to June 11, 1938. Promoted to captain while commanding &quot;Melville&quot;—on December 23, 1937—he served as inspector of material for the 3d Naval District from August 6, 1938, to January 22, 1941.

==USS &quot;Arizona&quot;==
On February 5, 1941, Van Valkenburgh relieved Capt. Harold C. Train as commanding officer of . Newly refitted at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, &quot;Arizona&quot; served as flagship of Battleship Division 1 for the remainder of the year, based primarily at Pearl Harbor with two trips to the west coast.

In a letter to a relative, Faith Van Valkenburgh Vilas, dated November 4, 1941, Captain Van Valkenburgh wrote: &quot;We are training, preparing, maneuvering, doing everything we can do to be ready. The work is intensive, continuous, and carefully planned. We never go to sea without being completely ready to move on to Singapore if need be, without further preparation. Most of our work we are not allowed to talk about off of the ship. I have spent 16 to 20 hours a day on the bridge for a week at a time, then a week of rest, then at it again.

&quot;Our eyes are constantly trained Westward, and we keep the guns ready for instant use against aircraft or submarines whenever we are at sea. We have no intention of being 
caught napping.&quot;

On December 4, the battleship went to sea in company with and for night surface practice and, after conducting these gunnery exercises, returned to Pearl Harbor independently on the 6th to moor at berth F-7 alongside Ford Island.
Both Captain Van Valkenburgh and the embarked division commander, Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, spent the next Saturday evening, December 6, on board. Suddenly, shortly before 08:00 on December 7, Japanese planes initiated their attack on Pearl Harbor. Captain Van Valkenburgh ran from his cabin and arrived on the navigation bridge, where he immediately began to direct his ship&#x27;s defense. A quartermaster in the pilot house asked if the captain wanted to go to the conning tower—a less-exposed position in view of the Japanese strafing—but Captain Van Valkenburgh adamantly refused and continued to man a telephone.

A violent explosion suddenly shook the ship, throwing the three occupants of the bridge—Captain Van Valkenburgh, an ensign, and the quartermaster, to the deck, and blowing out all of the bridge windows completely. The ensign managed to escape, but Captain Van Valkenburgh and the quartermaster were never seen again. A continuing fire, fed by ammunition and oil, raged for two days until finally being extinguished on December 9. Despite a thorough search, Captain Van Valkenburgh&#x27;s body was never found; all that was ever retrieved was his Annapolis class ring.

Captain Van Valkenburgh posthumously received the Medal of Honor—the citation reading in part: &quot;for devotion to duty ... extraordinary courage, and the complete disregard of his own life.&quot;

==Namesake==
In 1943, the destroyer was named in his honor.

<text>The British Virgin Islands has a two-party system, which means that there are two dominant political parties, creating difficulty for anybody to achieve electoral success under the banner of any other party. In none of the previous four elections has a candidate who was not standing for any party other than one of the two main parties won a seat (although one candidate has won running as an independent). Prior to 1999 there were a number of multi-party elections with four or more parties contesting and three or more parties winning seats.

==Active parties==
There are four main parties active at present in the Territory, and between them they hold all of the seats in the legislature. Two of them were formed in 2018, the other two are much older.

==Defunct parties==
Several parties have previously held seats in the British Virgin Islands legislature but are no longer current or active.
==Unelected parties==
A number of political parties have been formed but failed to win any seats. Only one of these parties has ever contested more than a single election (one of the parties named the Concern Citizen Movement contested two general elections; an unrelated party also named the Concern Citizen Movement contested a third).

<text>The History of the Quebec sovereignty movement covers various movements which sought to achieve political independence for Quebec, which has been a province of Canada since 1867. Quebec nationalism emerged in politics . The terms &quot;sovereignty&quot; and &quot;sovereignism&quot; were introduced by the modern Quebec sovereignty movement which began during the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s. Pro-sovereignty political parties have represented Quebec at the provincial and federal level, and have held two referendums on sovereignty which were both defeated. Additionally, two accords to amend the Canadian Constitution on issues of concern to Quebecers were also defeated.

==Origins==
Following the British conquest of New France, Quebec nationalism emerged in politics as a result of the Canadien movement (1760–1800). The Patriote movement (1800–1838) began with the founding of the Parti Canadien to counter the Château Clique&#x27;s agenda of assimilation. The movement culminated in the Declaration of Independence of Lower Canada and the Lower Canada Rebellion ( ). The secession never materialized, as the self-proclaimed Republic of Lower Canada was quickly re-absorbed into British Canada.

&quot;Sovereigntism&quot; and &quot;sovereignty&quot; are terms that refer to the modern movement in favour of the political independence of Quebec, which can be traced to the Alliance Laurentienne of 1957, the writings of historian Lionel Groulx in the 1920s, the Francoeur Motion of 1917, and premier of Quebec Honoré Mercier&#x27;s raising the idea of self-determination in the 1890s. The Quiet Revolution of Quebec brought widespread change in the 1960s. Among other changes, support for Quebec independence began to form and grow. 

The first organization dedicated to the independence of Quebec was the Alliance Laurentienne, founded by Raymond Barbeau on January 25, 1957. On September 10, 1960, the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;indépendance nationale (RIN) was founded.
On August 9 of that year, Raoul Roy founded the Action socialiste pour l&#x27;indépendance du Québec (ASIQ). In October and November 1962, RIN members formed the Comité de libération nationale and the Réseau de résistance to organize non-violent but illegal actions, such as vandalism and civil disobedience.

Shortly after the November 1962 Quebec general election, RIN member Marcel Chaput founded the short-lived Parti républicain du Québec. In 1964, the RIN became a provincial political party. In 1965, the more conservative Ralliement national (RN) also became a party. In October 1967, when the Parti libéral du Québec refused to discuss sovereignty at a party convention, cabinet minister René Lévesque left the party to form the Mouvement souveraineté-association (MSA). He set about to unite pro-sovereignty forces, and at a congress in October 1968 the RN and MSA agreed to merge to form the Parti Québécois (PQ). Later that month, RIN leader Pierre Bourgault dissolved his party and invited its members to join the PQ.

During the 1960s, many former European colonies, such as Cameroon, Congo, Senegal, Algeria, and Jamaica, were becoming independent. Some advocates of Quebec independence saw Quebec&#x27;s situation in a similar light. Numerous activists were influenced by the writings of Frantz Fanon, Albert Memmi, Aimé Césaire, Léopold Sédar Senghor and Karl Marx. In June 1967, during a state visit for the Canadian Centennial, French president Charles de Gaulle made a speech from the balcony of Montreal City Hall in which he declared The phrase was a slogan of Quebec sovereignty, and its delivery by de Gaulle deeply offended the Canadian federal government, which derided him. De Gaulle cut short his visit and left the country.

In February 1963, the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) was founded by Georges Schoeters, Raymond Villeneuve and Gabriel Hudon, three RIN members who had met as part of the Réseau de résistance. They were inspired by the political ideas of the ASIQ&#x27;s &quot;independence + socialism&quot; project, and felt the RIN was not extreme enough, making the decision to use violence in order to achieve independence. Between 1963 and 1970, the FLQ conducted over 160 violent incidents resulting in 8 deaths, and were considered a terrorist group by the Canadian government. While the FLQ had gradually gained support over the decade, the October Crisis of 1970, in which a Quebec cabinet minister and a British diplomat were kidnapped, galvanized support against violence while increasing support for political means of attaining independence.

==Early years of the PQ==
Economist Jacques Parizeau and politician Jérôme Proulx joined the PQ in 1969. Proulx had been elected to the assembly with the Union Nationale party but switched parties in protest of controversial language law Bill 63.

In the 1970 provincial election, the PQ elected its first seven members of the National Assembly of Quebec. René Lévesque was defeated in the Laurier riding by Liberal André Marchand. In the 1973 election the PQ was reduced to six seats, though its share of the popular vote had significantly increased.

In the 1976 election, the PQ won 71 seats and formed a majority government, shocking Quebecers and other Canadians. With one of the highest voting turnouts in the province&#x27;s history, 41.4 per cent of the electorate voted for the PQ.

On August 26, 1977, the PQ passed two important laws: one prohibited contributions by corporations and unions to political parties and set a limit on individual donations. The second was the Charter of the French Language which provided for fundamental French-language rights.

On May 17, 1979, Robert Burns resigned from the PQ. He had been unofficial leader of the PQ&#x27;s left-wing faction and a key architect of electoral reforms. He later told the media that he was convinced the PQ would lose its upcoming sovereignty referendum and fail to be re-elected afterward.
==Referendum of 1980==

At its seventh national convention in June 1979, the sovereigntists adopted their strategy for the coming referendum. The PQ then began an aggressive effort to promote Sovereignty-Association by providing proposed details (which had yet to be negotiated) on how economic relations with the rest of Canada would include free trade between Canada and Quebec, common tariffs against imports, and a common currency. In addition, joint political institutions were proposed to administer these economic arrangements.

Sovereignty-Association was proposed to the population of Quebec in the 1980 Quebec referendum. The proposal was rejected by 60 per cent of the Quebec electorate.

In September, the PQ created a national committee of anglophones and a liaison committee with ethnic minorities.

Despite having lost the referendum, the PQ was returned to power in the 1981 election with a stronger majority, obtaining 49.2 per cent of the vote and winning 80 seats. However, they did not pursue sovereignty and concentrated on their stated goal of &quot;good government&quot;.

René Lévesque retired in 1985. In the 1985 election under his successor Pierre-Marc Johnson, the PQ was defeated by the Liberals.

==Constitutional reform attempts==
===Meech Lake Accord===
The Meech Lake Accord was a set of constitutional amendments to the Constitution Act, 1982. In 1987, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the provincial premiers negotiated the accord, which satisfied all of Quebec&#x27;s demands. It decentralized the authority of the federal government, allowing the provinces greater influence over policy-making. Quebec&#x27;s five principal concerns addressed in the accords dealt with the constitutional recognition of Quebec as a &#x27;distinct society&#x27;, a constitutionally protected provincial role in immigration, a provincial role in Supreme Court appointments, limitations on federal power, spending in areas of provincial jurisdiction, and an affirmed veto for Quebec over any future constitutional amendments. In addition to the Progressive Conservatives&#x27; initiative in pledging to reach &#x27;national reconciliation&#x27; through constitutional rapprochement and re-establishment of harmonious ties in federal–provincial relations, the Liberals and New Democrats also supported the accord in a House of Commons vote. Adhering to the procedure to ratify an amendment as outlined in the Constitution Act of 1982, the accord was sent to the ten provincial legislatures for approval. However, the accord collapsed due to the failure of the Manitoba and Newfoundland governments to ratify it before the three-year deadline in 1990. The implications of the failed accord caused a greater divide between French Quebecers and English Canada.

Several reasons have been attributed to the accord&#x27;s downfall, including the indirect and elitist manner in which negotiations were handled, the lack of proper recognition concerning minorities&#x27; interests, vague discussion about key issues, weak promotion by the federal government, and deliberate manipulation of the media and public by politicians in support and in opposition. Within Quebec, francophones responded with indignation at the failure of the accord, interpreting it as a rejection of French reality by English Canada. Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa&#x27;s remarks that &quot;English Canada should understand that no matter what is said or done, Quebec remains today as always a distinct society that is capable and free to assume its own development&quot;, which indicated the general consensus in Quebec after the failure of the accord. Canadians outside of the province expressed resentment towards the &#x27;distinct society&#x27; clause. There was a widespread sense that only the French benefited from the accord and that it did not address other constitutional issues. Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells feared that Quebec would use the &#x27;distinct society&#x27; clause to assert greater and special jurisdictional authority over what would otherwise be under federal jurisdiction. This was reflective of the commonly perceived notion, held by English-Canadians, that the Meech Lake Accord would bring unevenness and difference to rights and powers, where the intended effect was to introduce equality.

===Charlottetown Accord===
The 1992 Charlottetown Accord was the second attempt by Mulroney&#x27;s government to bring Quebec into agreement with the constitution through reforms in a national referendum. The accord included a variety of provisions to deal with other Canadian issues. The main terms included parliamentary reform, First Nations self-government, a new division of federal–provincial powers, and a distinct society status for Quebec. Regarding Quebec, the new accord set out to satisfy Quebec&#x27;s constitutional demands (as presented in the Meech Lake Accord) by providing assurances of Quebec representation on the Supreme Court, a veto over constitutional amendments on federal institutions, and a provision limiting federal powers concerning shared-cost programs, allowing provinces to opt out with full compensation. Quebec was also guaranteed twenty-five percent of the seats in the House of Commons of Canada. The Senate would be restructured to have six elected members from each province and one each representing the territories. Each province would decide how the senators would be selected. Additionally, the equally represented Senate for each province would have suspending veto powers that would cause a joint session with the House of Commons. In the realm of provincial and federal powers, the accord outlined a transfer of jurisdiction over labour-market training and culture to the provinces as well as handing over authority, by provincial request, over the ministerial responsibilities of forestry, mining, recreation, tourism, housing, and municipal and urban affairs. Another major aspect of the accord was the recognized right of Aboriginal self-government as an existing legal body of government. Most of what was included in the Meech Lake Accord either remained intact or was expanded upon in the Charlottetown Accord.

On October 26, 1992, Canadians voted &#x27;No&#x27; on the Charlottetown Accord in six provinces, including Quebec, by a margin of 54 percent to 45 percent. The vote reflected not only English Canadians&#x27; concern over provincial equality, individual equality, unique status, and the inviolability of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, but Quebeckers&#x27; perception that the accord would only slightly affect Quebec&#x27;s place within Confederation while not doing enough to ensure Quebec&#x27;s autonomy within the federal government. Despite the existence of more regulations concerning federal spending, the &#x27;No&#x27; side in Quebec were convinced that the accord would legitimatize federal intervention in provincial affairs which could counter Quebec&#x27;s interests, create overlaps of federal and provincial influence on policies, therefore leading to inefficient copies of policies on similar subject matter. For Quebec separatists, the failure of a further attempt at constitution reform affirmed their position that there were only two choices available in Quebec: the status quo or Quebec sovereignty. Lucien Bouchard, leader of the Bloc Québécois, declared, &quot;There were two roads before the referendum – profoundly renewed federalism and sovereignty. These two options must now find a convergence,&quot; though outside of Quebec, many Canadians saw the &#x27;No&#x27; vote as an assertion of the status quo, not sovereignty. One of the major effects that resulted from the failure of multiple attempts at constitutional reform was the massive upheaval of the traditional political party structure in the federal government after the 1993 election. The Progressive Conservatives suffered the greatest loss of seats in modern history of industrialized democracies, only winning in two seats, and two new federal parties, Bloc Québécois and Reform party, finished with the second- and third-highest number of elected seats.

==Referendum of 1995==
The PQ returned to power in the 1994 election under Jacques Parizeau, this time with 44.75% of the popular vote. In the intervening years, the failures of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords had revived support for sovereignty, which had seemed a non-issue for much of the 1980s. Another consequence of the failure of Meech Lake was the formation of the pro-sovereigntist Bloc Québécois party (BQ) under former Progressive Conservative federal cabinet minister Lucien Bouchard. For the first time, the PQ supported pro-sovereigntist forces in federal elections, something Lévesque had always opposed. The Union Populaire had nominated candidates in the 1979 and 1980 federal elections, and the Parti nationaliste du Québec had nominated candidates in the 1984 federal election. Neither of these parties had official support of the PQ or significant support among Quebec voters.

In the 1993 federal election following the collapse of the Progressive Conservative Party, the BQ won enough seats to become Her Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition in the House of Commons. Parizeau promptly called a new referendum. The 1995 referendum question differed from the 1980 question in that the negotiation of an association with Canada was now optional.
This time, the Yes camp lost in a very close vote, by less than one percent. As in the previous referendum, the anglophone minority in Quebec overwhelmingly (about 90%) rejected sovereignty, and support for sovereignty was also weak among allophones in immigrant communities and first-generation descendants, while by contrast almost 60 per cent of Quebec francophones of all origins voted Yes (francophones are an 82 per cent majority of Quebecers).

Premier Jacques Parizeau attributed the defeat of the resolution to &quot;money and the ethnic vote&quot;.

==Post-referendum==

The PQ won re-election in the 1998 Quebec general election with little change in seats from the previous election. However, public support for sovereignty remained too low for the PQ to consider holding another referendum. Meanwhile, the federal government passed the Clarity Act to govern the wording of any future referendum questions and the conditions under which a vote for sovereignty would be recognized as legitimate. Federal Liberal politicians stated that the ambiguous wording of the 1995 referendum question was the primary impetus in the bill&#x27;s drafting.

In the 2003 election, the PQ lost power to the Liberal party. However, in early 2004 the unpopular Liberal government combined with the federal Liberal Party sponsorship scandal contributed to a resurgence of the BQ. In the 2004 federal elections, the Bloc Québécois won 54 of the 75 federal seats in Quebec (compared to 33 held previously).

While opponents of sovereignty were pleased with their referendum victories, most recognized that there were still deep divides within Quebec and problems with the relationship between Quebec and the rest of Canada.
===Clarity Act===

In 1999, Parliament passed the Clarity Act, which established the conditions under which the federal government would enter into negotiations for possible secession following a vote by any province to leave Canada. The act gave the Parliament of Canada the power to decide whether a proposed referendum question was considered clear, and allowed the elected representatives of all Canadians from all provinces and territories to decide whether a clear majority had expressed itself in any referendum. It is widely considered by sovereigntists as indefensible, and thus inapplicable, despite being sanctioned by the United Nations. A contradictory, but non-binding and symbolic Act respecting the exercise of the fundamental rights and prerogatives of the Québec people and the Québec State was introduced in the National Assembly of Quebec only two days after the Clarity Act had been introduced in the House of Commons.

Former Prime Minister Chrétien, under whom the Clarity Act was passed, has remarked that the act is among his most significant accomplishments.

===Redevelopments===

&quot;Sovereignty-Association&quot; is nowadays more often referred to simply as &quot;sovereignty&quot;. However, it remains a part of the PQ program and is tied to national independence in the minds of many Quebecers. It has always been controversial, since some Quebec federalists and Canadian politicians outside Quebec have argued that it is unlikely that the rest of Canada would make an association or partnership agreement with a sovereign or independent Quebec. or that Canada would want to negotiate issues that the Quebec government would refuse to negotiate, such as a partition of Quebec.

In 2003, the PQ launched the (Season of ideas), a public consultation to gather the opinions of Quebecers on its sovereignty project, the new program and the revised sovereignty project adopted at the 2005 Congress.

Polls conducted by Leger and Mainstreet Research in Quebec indicated a rise in support for independence, reaching around 32% from 27% in December 2020. However, this uptick was tempered by the fact that younger voters were no longer the driving force behind the sovereignty movement. Almost half of voters aged 18 to 34 were against sovereignty, while those over 55 showed a statistical tie.

<doc id="1223711" wikidata="Q1130664" url="?curid=1223711" title="Far from Heaven">
<text>Far from Heaven is a 2002 historical romantic drama film written by Todd Haynes and directed by Todd Haynes and starring Julianne Moore, Dennis Quaid, Dennis Haysbert and Patricia Clarkson. It premiered at the Venice Film Festival, where Moore won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress, and cinematographer Edward Lachman won a prize for Outstanding Individual Contribution.

The film tells the story of Cathy Whitaker, a 1950s housewife, living in wealthy suburban Connecticut as she sees her seemingly perfect life begin to fall apart. Haynes pays homage to the films of Douglas Sirk (especially 1955&#x27;s &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot;, 1956&#x27;s &quot;Written on the Wind&quot;, and 1959&#x27;s &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;), and explores race, gender roles, sexual orientation, and class in the context of 1950s America.

&quot;Far from Heaven&quot; received numerous accolades, including four Academy Award nominations. For her performance, Moore was nominated for Best Actress at the Oscars, Golden Globes, and Screen Actors Guild, and won at the Critics&#x27; Choice Awards, while Quaid was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild.

==Plot==
In 1957 suburban Connecticut, Cathy Whitaker seems to be the perfect wife, mother, and homemaker. Her husband, Frank, is an executive at Magnatech, a television advertising company. One evening, Cathy receives a phone call from the local police, who are holding Frank. When she picks him up, he says it is all a misunderstanding, but it turns out that he has been exploring the illicit underground world of gay bars in Hartford. In the midst of all of this, one day Cathy sees an unfamiliar black man walking in her yard. He turns out to be Raymond Deagan, the son of her late gardener, who is taking over his father&#x27;s accounts.

Frank often stays late at the office. One night when he says he is working, Cathy decides to bring him dinner, and she walks in on him passionately kissing a man. He confesses to having had &quot;problems&quot; as a young man and agrees to sign up for conversion therapy. However, their relationship is strained, Frank&#x27;s work suffers, and he increasingly turns to alcohol. Cathy runs into Raymond at a local art show and, to the consternation of onlookers, initiates a discussion with him about modern painting. After a party, Frank attempts to make love to Cathy, but he is unable to become aroused and accidentally strikes her when she tries to console him.

The next day, Raymond catches Cathy crying and asks her to run some errands with him. She agrees, and they wind up going to a bar in a black neighborhood, where Cathy is the only white person present. They are seen together on the street by a gossipy acquaintance of Cathy&#x27;s, and the woman immediately begins to stir up scandal. When Cathy attends her daughter&#x27;s ballet performance, the mothers of the other girls shun her. Frank also hears about Cathy and Raymond and, in response to his anger, Cathy denies having an other-than-professional relationship with Raymond and says she has fired him to quell the rumors. She then tells Raymond that their friendship cannot continue, as it is not &quot;plausible&quot;.

Cathy and Frank go to Miami for New Year&#x27;s to try to repair their marriage, but, at the hotel, Frank meets a young man and has another homosexual encounter. While they are gone, three white boys taunt and physically assault Raymond&#x27;s daughter, Sarah, partly because of her father&#x27;s rumored relationship with Cathy, and the girl is concussed by a rock thrown at her head.

Frank breaks down and tearfully tells Cathy that he has fallen in love with a man and wants a divorce. When Cathy learns what happened to Sarah, she visits Raymond, who says he is moving to Baltimore in two weeks, as the rumors have destroyed his business and led his African-American neighbors to throw rocks through his windows. When Cathy tells Raymond she is going to be single and asks if she can come visit him some time, he stoically, but gently, rejects her, saying he has learned his lesson and needs to do what is right for his daughter.

Cathy shows up at the train station to see Raymond off, and they silently wave to each other as the train leaves the station.

==Production==
Haynes wrote the script for the film envisioning Moore and James Gandolfini as Cathy and Frank, respectively. While Moore joined the project immediately, Gandolfini was unavailable, due his commitments to &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. Haynes&#x27; next choice, Russell Crowe, believed that the role was too small. The film&#x27;s producers did not meet Jeff Bridges&#x27;s financial demands.

==Themes and analysis==
&quot;Far From Heaven&quot; focuses on several controversial issues of the mid-twentieth century, such as racism and miscegenation, as well as views on homosexuality and escapism during that time period, and presents these issues through the and cinematographic conventions of a 1950s-style melodrama. Utilizing the nostalgic mechanisms of a polished, period melodrama, the film challenges the typical sanguine nature of the genre in an effort to highlight the central conflicts of its main characters, Cathy and Frank Whitaker, while also simultaneously shattering the wholesome image of American life during this time period, which is typically romanticized in American culture. Haynes employs these tactics and others, such as lighting and music, to highlight these pivotal developments and not only further the plot of the story, but create a sensory experience for the audience that lulls them into what appears to portray an idealized version of 1950s suburban American family life, but proves to be far from it.

Andrew O&#x27;Hehir of &quot;Salon&quot; wrote that the film &quot;bears a family resemblance to Sirk&#x27;s 1955 &quot;All That Heaven Allows&quot;&quot;.

===Racism and miscegenation===
Throughout &quot;Far From Heaven&quot;, one of the central conflicts faced by the main protagonist Cathy Whitaker comes from her attraction towards Raymond Deagan, the son of her recently deceased gardener, and how it develops in the face of her estrangement from her husband, Frank Whitaker, as he deals with his developing homosexual tendencies. Set in the fall of 1957 in Hartford, Connecticut, the racial tensions emblematic of the era are reflected right away in the first scene Raymond makes an appearance, tending to his father&#x27;s former duties as the Whitaker&#x27;s gardener. While Cathy is being interviewed for a society circular in her living room, she notices Raymond mulling around in her yard, and immediately becomes frightened, uneasy by the prospect of an unfamiliar black man. While her interviewer, Mrs. Leacock, suggests calling the police, Cathy walks outside to confront him and learns the circumstances of the situation and how he came to be there, after which she apologizes for her assumptions and demonstrates a capacity to see beyond his race and show sympathy for his father&#x27;s recent passing. This is an action that is observed closely by Mrs. Leacock through the window, and ultimately makes its way into her article profiling Cathy and her &quot;kindness to negroes&quot;.

Presenting this particular issue so early on in the film, there is a clear contrast drawn between Hartford&#x27;s suburban idyllic autumnal setting and the reality of the social order that dominates the everyday life of the Whitakers and the people in their lives. As Frank&#x27;s difficulties continue to develop, Cathy finds great solace in befriending Raymond and ultimately comes to develop feelings for him as a result. These feelings, however, prove to be a huge social taboo in this time period, and are met with anger and prejudice in affluent New England. With the developing historical events of the Little Rock Crisis serving as the contextual backdrop to the struggle in &quot;Far From Heaven&quot;, it is in this struggle that one of the central themes of the film comes to the forefront, and is continually reintroduced through segregational policies of the era. Over the course of the film, we observe Cathy and Raymond&#x27;s interactions being highly scrutinized by the different members of their own respective communities, as well as examples of Jim Crow-like practices that were commonplace during this era, such as being unable to sit next to each other at a local lunch counter. Frank and Cathy&#x27;s vacation to Miami exemplifies this when a young African-American boy jumps into the hotel pool where Cathy and Frank are vacationing. Not only is the boy swiftly removed from the pool, but the white guests who were swimming at the time rapidly exit the pool area in disgust, mortified that the water and surrounding area had been shared, and therefore tainted, by a black person.

Rebecca Sherr wrote in her essay &quot;(Not) queering &quot;white vision&quot; in &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; and &quot;Transamerica&quot;&quot;:
Implicitly, this scenario illustrates white Americans&#x27; fear of black bodies, bodies that for whites symbolize &quot;contamination&quot;; and &quot;contamination&quot; in turn signifies the underlying fear of miscegenation. The camera moves between Cathy&#x27;s point-of-view looking out at the pool, and then the camera turns and focuses directly on Cathy so that she becomes the object of the gaze. Her eyes remain half-hidden behind sunglasses, which act as shield and mirror. As the unfolding action is miniaturized and reflected—indeed, doubled—on Cathy’s lenses, the message is that this drama turns back on Cathy, illustrating in a rather didactic manner the futility of her desire for Raymond, a black man. The emphasis on parenting here, with a black father and white mother &quot;saving&quot; and disciplining their respective children, further emphasizes the undercurrent of segregation as policing the boundaries of racial reproduction.

===Homosexuality and escapism===
Frank Whitaker&#x27;s burgeoning homosexuality is no doubt one of the most pivotal thematic story elements within &quot;Far From Heaven&quot;, as it sets in motion a series of events in the film that ultimately culminate in not only the estrangement of his wife, but also the inevitable failure of his marriage. Characterized as the reliable husband, the successful hardworking businessman, the charming spouse, and the devoted father, he is idealized in a way that assigns him so many demanding roles, it is almost as if he is driven to pursue his homosexual tendencies as a means to escape his taxing everyday life and release his burden and frustration. We witness this early on in the film in his office at Magnatech when lunch meetings and dinner meetings pile up in his schedule, as portfolio season is well underway and his New York office continues to push up deadlines. Much like Cathy, Frank falls short of his exalted reputation, and as he is exploring Hartford one evening, avoiding returning home by taking in a movie, he soon finds himself walking the streets, delving further into the seedy underbelly of Hartford nightlife, where he hopes to find what he is looking for. It is when he notices what appear to be two gay men walking into a basement bar that he finally acts on his impulses and begins the slippery slope of self gratification that ultimately comes to dominate his lifestyle. It is through these humble beginnings that we come to explore with Frank the subversive and hushed nature cast upon the gay community during this time period.

Mitra Moin writes in her essay, &quot;&quot;Far From Heaven&quot; and &quot;Carol&quot;: Channeling 1950s Melodrama&quot;:
The 1950s is a time of constraining expectations; everyone is expected to lead perfect suburban lives, and those that deviate are socially condemned. Haynes sets this up in &quot;Far From Heaven&quot;, where Cathy appears to have a model life: two children, a successful husband, and a suburban home. She is a typical housewife, admired by others: &quot;Women just like yourself, with families and homes to keep up.&quot; This is dismantled in the premise, when Cathy receives a call from the police station regarding her husband. Beauty and perfection, here, are forms of oppression. The props are also important to observe as symbols of the 1950s: The television manifests the suburban prosperity that characterizes the time period. Cathy must adhere to the narrow and confining gender roles of the 1950s, just as Frank must suppress his homosexual desires. These characters, disillusioned in their seemingly flawless worlds, ultimately find these symbols as oppressive.

Likewise, Cathy, who finds an escape through her relationship with Raymond, begins to act on her impulses as well, taking us further into the bigoted, prejudiced nature of upper class Hartford society. When Cathy, in the aftermath of Eleanor observing the physical abuse Frank has inflicted upon her, is discovered crying in her yard by Raymond, their relationship becomes even closer, and he extends to her an invitation for a day in the country in an effort to take her mind off her worries, which she ultimately accepts. This invitation, however, sets in motion a series of events that culminates in a romantic evening between the two, which is inadvertently observed by Mona Lauder, a woman whose gossip is notorious for spreading like wildfire. It is through Mona&#x27;s prejudiced tittle-tattle that Cathy soon finds herself with her reputation besmirched, as even her friends and loved ones are disgusted with her behavior. Frank&#x27;s revelation of his affair to Cathy, which effectively ends their marriage, is mirrored when Cathy reveals her attraction for Raymond to Eleanor and is summarily rejected, exposing the subtle dichotomy between their respective vices. As Rebecca Sherr notes in her essay:
The &quot;mirroring&quot; technique occurs several times and is a visual clue as to the parallels the film draws between interracial romance and homosexuality. [...] The two instances of &quot;coming out&quot; in &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; produce different narrative trajectories, and the mediating factor of racial difference accounts for these divergent outcomes. This difference in outcome is based in the notion of visibility—racial difference cannot usually be hidden. The film communicates that heterosexual, interracial desire could, in a sense, be seen as even more &quot;queer&quot; than homosexuality, at least in the context of queerness as visible deviance.

Although Cathy finds herself isolated at the end of the film, a divorcée fallen from grace who now devotes her life to her children and her volunteer work for organizations such as the NAACP, she still possesses feelings for Raymond that, though now held back, dominate the subtext of the ending of the film, without either character having to utter a single word in their silent, tear-wrenching farewell. Todd McGowan observes of both Cathy and Frank in &quot;Relocating Our Enjoyment of the 1950s: The Politics of Fantasy in &quot;Far From Heaven&quot;&quot;: &quot;The point here is not that they enjoy in spite of the widespread disapproval; it is instead that this disapproval enables and fuels their enjoyment. Their time together has the significance it does precisely because the social prohibition does not permit it.&quot;

=== and cinematography===
According to Haynes&#x27; director&#x27;s commentary, recorded for the DVD-release of &quot;Far from Heaven&quot;, the film was made in the style of many 1950s films, notably those of Douglas Sirk. Haynes created color palettes for every scene in the film, and was careful and particular in his choices. He emphasized experience with color in such scenes as one in which Cathy, Eleanor, and their friends are all dressed in reds, oranges, yellows, browns, and greens, and also played with the color green by using it to light forbidden and mysterious scenes. This effect was employed both in the scene in which Frank visits a gay bar and when Cathy goes to the restaurant in a predominantly black neighborhood.

Blue is often used in the film to represent Frank and Cathy&#x27;s failing marriage, as in the scene in which Cathy receives a phone call from the Hartford police concerning Frank and his &quot;loitering&quot; and, later, when Frank and Cathy leave the psychiatrist&#x27;s office after their first visit to try to curb Frank&#x27;s homosexual tendencies. It is in the second of these moments that the only profanity in the entire film is used, by Frank towards Cathy, further demonstrating the coldness and bitterness he feels towards his wife, and perfectly in sync with the color palette that envelops them during this scene.

Scott Higgins writes in &quot;Orange and Blue, Desire and Loss: The Colour Score in &quot;Far From Heaven&quot;&quot;:
Generally, we can isolate two strategies of colour design in &quot;Far from Heaven&quot;. On one hand, Haynes makes straightforward and adroit use of classical convention in a fairly subtle and un-ironic way. On the other hand, moments of strong stylisation reveal a self-consciousness of form that announces its artifice. The film&#x27;s articulation of an autumnal orange motif exemplifies how Haynes reawakens dormant Hollywood conventions in a rather delicate expressive manner. The more overt manipulation of coloured lighting, however, offers a test case. Red and green lighting broadcasts its artifice and its reference to Sirk, activating an awareness of form that Haynes nonetheless manages to align with our sympathy for his characters. In his extensive use of blue light, though, Haynes exploits conventional motivations and the melodrama&#x27;s generic tendency towards stylisation to exact a sincere and direct affective charge from colour temperature, in much the way filmmakers had done between the late 1930s and 1960s. His project of self-conscious reference may, in fact, open room for Haynes to renew the classical convention in an emotionally direct way. It is this play between citation and invocation of colour scoring that makes &quot;Far From Heaven&quot; so compelling.

In addition to the color scheme, Haynes used shots and angles appropriate to Sirk&#x27;s films and era, and the script employs over-the-top, melodramatic dialogue. In driving scenes, the filmmakers employed the rear projection process commonly used in older films, even reusing a plate from Sirk&#x27;s &quot;Written on the Wind&quot; for one shot of Cathy driving to her daughter&#x27;s ballet recital. Cinematographer Edward Lachman helped created the appropriate &quot;look&quot; by using the same types of lighting techniques, lighting equipment, and lens filters that would have been used to film a melodrama in the 1950s, and Elmer Bernstein&#x27;s score is reminiscent of those he had composed 40 and 50 years earlier. Also, supervising sound editor Kelley Baker used Foley to make the sounds of things in the film such as rustling clothes and footsteps more prominent in a way similar to films from the 1950s.

In the director&#x27;s commentary, Haynes noted that he was influenced by Rainer Werner Fassbinder&#x27;s film &quot;&quot;. Both films portray feelings of alienation and awkwardness, which is conveyed by, for example, sometimes lingering on a character for a few seconds longer than is comfortable for the viewer before cutting to the next scene.

==Reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 87% based on 221 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;An exquisitely designed and performed melodrama, &quot;Far From Heaven&quot; earns its viewers&#x27; tears with sincerity and intelligence.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 84 out of 100 based on 37 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Jonathan Rosenbaum called the film a masterpiece and considered it a companion of Haynes&#x27; earlier film &quot;Safe&quot; (1995) in its use of &quot;the same talented actress to explore suburban alienation in comparably gargantuan consumerist surroundings&quot;. Regarding the casting of Raymond, Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that &quot;Haysbert brings a Poitier-esque dignity and poise.&quot;

The film was nominated in four categories at the 75th Academy Awards: Best Actress in a Leading Role (Julianne Moore), Best Original Screenplay (Todd Haynes), Best Cinematography (Edward Lachman), and Best Original Score (Elmer Bernstein). At the Venice Film Festival, it was nominated for the Golden Lion, while Moore won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress and Lachman won a prize for Outstanding Individual Contribution.

In August 2016, BBC Magazine conducted a poll on the 21st century&#x27;s 100 greatest films so far, with &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; ranking at number 86. In 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the film 13th in its list of the best films of the 21st century.

<text>Robert Gordon McBeath, VC (22 December 1898 – 9 October 1922) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious medal that can be awarded to members of British military forces. Following the end of the First World War McBeath married and emigrated to Canada where he was killed in the line of duty while working as a police officer in Vancouver, British Columbia.

== First World War ==
McBeath was a 19 years old lance-corporal in the 1/5th Battalion, The Seaforth Highlanders (Ross-shire Buffs, Duke of Albany&#x27;s) of the British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 20 November 1917 during the Battle of Cambrai in France, Lance-Corporal McBeath volunteered to deal with a nest of machine-gunners that checked the advance of his unit and which had caused heavy casualties
. He moved off alone, armed with a Lewis gun and a revolver. Finding that several other machine-guns were in action, McBeath attacked them with the assistance of a tank and drove the gunners to ground in a deep dug-out. McBeath rushed in after them, shot the first man who opposed him and then drove the remainder of the garrison out of the dug-out. He captured three officers and 30 men. 

McBeath&#x27;s award was published in the London Gazette on 11 January 1918, which reads:

==Freemasonry==
He was Initiated into Freemasonry in Lodge St. Mary&#x27;s Caledonian Operative, No.339, (Inverness, Scotland) on 12 July 1919. He did not take all his Masonic degrees in Scotland. After his arrival in Canada, he completed his degrees in Mount Hermon Lodge, No. 7 (Vancouver, Canada) in which he was Passed on 29 October 1921 and Raised on 18 May 1922.

== Canada ==
After the war, McBeath and his wife moved to Canada, where he joined the British Columbia Provincial Police. On August 12, 1921, he joined the Vancouver Police Department. On October 9, 1922, while walking the beat on Granville and Davie Streets with his partner, Detective R. Quirk, McBeath stopped and arrested a man named Fred Deal for impaired driving. While escorting the prisoner to the nearest call-box, the man pulled a handgun from his pocket and shot both officers; McBeath&#x27;s partner survived, but McBeath died almost instantly. He was 23 years old.

Fred Deal was arrested later that day and was subsequently sentenced to death. The sentence was reduced to life imprisonment on appeal because Deal had been beaten while in custody. Deal served only 21 years before being released and deported to his native Jacksonville, Florida, where he died a few years later.

==Funeral==
Robert McBeath was given what was called at the time “the largest official funeral in Vancouver history.”

==Posthumously==
A Vancouver Police Marine vessel is named the &quot;R.C. McBeath VC&quot; in honour of Robert McBeath, as is a housing development, McBeath Court, in his home town of Kinlochbervie.

McBeath is buried in the Masonic Section, Plot 193, Lot 6, of Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver. The headstone shows his name as &quot;MacBeath&quot;, although his surname is spelled &quot;McBeath&quot; on all other documents except the Vancouver coroner&#x27;s report.

The Vancouver Police Department hold a ceremony at his graveside every November 11 at 0900 hrs., where names and branches of service of VPD members, who took their leave, then served in the Canadian Armed Forces, and were KIA overseas are read out.

McBeath&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed at the Regimental Museum of Queen&#x27;s Own Highlanders, Fort George, Highland, near Inverness in Scotland.

<text>William Braunstein (born July 14, 1972), professionally known by his stage name Ill Bill, is an American rapper and record producer from Brooklyn, New York City. Having gained fame in the underground hip hop group Non Phixion, Ill Bill is known for his diverse lyrics and as the producer, founder and CEO of Uncle Howie Records. His brother Ron is rapper and producer Necro.

In late 1994, MC Serch took his protégé Sabac Red and teamed him up with DJ Eclipse and Ill Bill, thereby creating the group known as Non Phixion. Within six months Goretex, a childhood friend of Ill Bill, had joined the crew after freestyling for MC Serch. Non Phixion released a studio album titled &quot;The Future is Now&quot; in 2002, numerous singles and two compilations albums. Much of the production work was done by Necro.

He met Slaine in Boston and, impressed with his writing, brought him to L.A. to record some tracks.

Noble died suddenly in a Toronto hospital after contracting a virulent strain of pneumonia that caused septic shock and kidney failure.

Noble was born in New York City.

==Career==

Noble obtained an undergraduate degree in history and chemistry from the University of Florida and a doctorate from the University of Rochester. He worked as a biochemist at various institutions before becoming an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dismissed after being denied tenure in 1984, he landed at York University. Between 1986 and 1994, Noble taught in the Department of History and Politics at Drexel University. In 1997 he served as the inaugural Hixon-Riggs Visiting Professor of science, technology, and society at Harvey Mudd College. Noble taught at York University until his death.

==Pedagogy==

During his entire teaching career Noble refused to grade students, based on the idea from critical pedagogy of the harm caused by grading.

==Written work==

===&quot;America by Design&quot;===
Noble&#x27;s first book, &quot;America by Design: Science, Technology, and the Rise of Corporate Capitalism&quot; (1977), a revision of his University of Rochester dissertation under Christopher Lasch, was published to unusually prominent reviews. Robert Heilbroner hailed it as a work that &quot;makes us see technology as a force that shapes management in an industrial capitalist society,&quot; while &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the book a &quot;significant contribution&quot; owing to its uncommon leftist perspective on American technology. Many academic reviewers praised the book&#x27;s bold argument about the corporate control of science and technology, although some including Alfred Chandler expressed reservations about its forthright Marxist thesis.

===&quot;Forces of Production&quot;===
In &quot;Forces of Production: A Social History of Industrial Automation&quot; (1984, 1st edition; 2011, 2nd edition) Noble recounts the history of machine tool automation in the United States. He argues that CNC (computerized numerical control) machines were introduced both to increase efficiency and to discipline unions which were stronger in the US in the period immediately following World War II. &quot;Forces of Production&quot; argues that management wanted to take the programming of machine tools, which as &quot;machines for making machines&quot; are a critical industrial product, out of the hands of union members and transfer their control, by means of primitive programming, to non-union, college-educated white-collar employees working physically separate from the shop floor. Noble&#x27;s research argues that, in practical terms, the separation was a failure. The practice angered and alienated union machinists, who felt that their practical and night-school knowledge of applied science was being disregarded. In response, they sat back while watching the programmed machines produce what Noble described as &quot;scrap at high speed.&quot; Noble then went on to argue that management compromised with the unions, in a minor violation of the US&#x27;s 1948 Taft–Hartley Act (which reserved all issues except pay and benefits to management discretion), to allow the union men to &quot;patch&quot; and even write the CNC programs. Although Noble focuses strictly, in &quot;Forces of Production&quot;, on the narrow and specialist area of machine tools, his work may be generalized to issues in MIS software where the end users are restive when told to accept the product of analysts ignorant of the real needs of the business or the employee. David also wrote the Introduction to the second edition of Mike Cooley&#x27;s Architect or Bee? published in the US in 1982 by South End Press.

===Last writing===
Pursuing his critique of the role of the university, since 2004 Noble was active in bringing attention to what he identified as issues of social justice. These included the notion of the increasing corporatization of the Canadian public university, and defending the idea of academic freedom and the role of the tenured academic as public servant. Noble&#x27;s most recent book, &quot;Beyond the Promised Land: The Movement and the Myth&quot;, is a sweeping historiography of what he described as the myth of the promised land, connecting the disappointments of the Christian religious story of redemption and salvation with the rise of global capitalism and the response to these disappointments by recent social justice movements.

==Political activism==
In 1983 Noble co-founded the National Coalition for Universities in the Public Interest with Ralph Nader and Leonard Minsky to try &quot;to bring extra-academic pressure to bear upon university administrations who were selling out their colleagues and the public in the pursuit of corporate partnerships.&quot;

Noble&#x27;s leftist politics and supposedly aggressive tactics gave him a rocky career. He was denied tenure at MIT, forced to leave his appointment at the Smithsonian Institution, and blocked from giving the commencement address at Harvey Mudd College because the administration argued he was &quot;anti-technology.&quot; His appointment to the J.S. Woodsworth Chair in the Humanities at Simon Fraser University was suspended following what Noble and others saw as irregularities in the hiring process.

In 1998, he was awarded the Joe A. Callaway Award for Civic Courage, which &quot;recognizes individuals who take a public stance to advance truth and justice, at some personal risk.&quot; The award honored Noble&#x27;s decades as &quot;a singular voice in seeking to fight the commercialization of higher education and to protect one of society&#x27;s most precious assets, an independent intellectual capacity to engage the serious issues of our day.&quot;

===Corporatization and commercialization===
In the 1990s, Noble criticized the way in which &quot;second-tier&quot; universities accessible to the majority have been forced, owing to budget pressures absent at well-endowed &quot;first-tier&quot; universities, to adopt overly corporate-friendly policies. According to Noble, these policies subordinate the educational mission to a more careerist vision in which students were taught &quot;practical&quot; subjects, but in such narrow ways that they are, in effect, less broadly employable. In his 1998 paper Digital Diploma Mills, Noble wrote: &quot;universities are not only undergoing a technological transformation. Beneath that change, and camouflaged by it, lies another: the commercialization of higher education&quot;. Noble argued that high technology, at these universities, is often used not to improve teaching and research, but to over-control and overwork junior faculty and graduate students, expropriate the intellectual property of leading faculty, and, through various mechanisms such as the recorded lecture, replace the visions and voices of less-prestigious faculty with the second-hand and reified product of academic &quot;superstars&quot;.

===&quot;Tail that Wags the Dog&quot;===
In his broad-based critique of what he viewed as an academic-industrial system, Noble questioned Israel&#x27;s strategic role in Western institutions on a broad basis. In late November 2004, at York University, Noble garnered controversy for handing out flyers entitled &quot;The York University Foundation: The Tail That Wags the Dog (Suggestions for Further Research)&quot; at a campus event. The information sheets alleged that the Foundation, York University&#x27;s principal fund-raising body, was biased by the presence and influence of pro-Israel lobbyists, activists and persons involved in Jewish agencies, whom he identified as the &quot;tail&quot;, and that this bias affected the political conduct of York&#x27;s administration in important ways, through their power to &quot;wag the dog&quot;. In particular, Noble (who was of Jewish descent himself) claimed that there was a connection between alleged &quot;Pro-Israeli influence&quot; on the York Foundation and the university administration&#x27;s treatment of vocal pro-Palestinian campaigners on campus and to a later-scuttled project to build a Toronto Argonauts football stadium on the campus. York University responded with a public statement that &quot;condemned the material in the flyer as offensive.&quot; In 2006 Noble launched a $25-million libel suit at the Ontario Superior Court of Justice against a series of individuals and of York University, Jewish, and Israeli organizations for defamation and conspiracy, accusing them of having improperly criticized his &quot;Tail That Wags the Dog&quot; campaign as antisemitic. In 2007, Noble&#x27;s grievance against York that his academic freedom had been violated was settled, with the arbitrator saying, &quot;York breached Article 10.01 of the Collective Agreement by failing to respect Professor Noble’s rights as an academic. Indeed, it may be said that York failed to extend Professor Noble even the most basic of courtesies that might reasonably be expected to be enjoyed by a faculty member.&quot;

===Jewish holidays===
Noble and York University also were in the news in October 2005 with regard to his vocal opposition to the university&#x27;s policy, adopted in 1974, of cancelling classes during the three days marking the Jewish High Holidays. Noble originally stated he would defy the policy and hold classes nonetheless, however, in the end he pledged instead to cancel his classes on &quot;all&quot; religious holidays observed by &quot;any&quot; student in his classes, including for example, all Muslim holidays. In April 2006 Noble lodged a complaint with the Ontario Human Rights Commission, alleging that cancellation of classes during certain Jewish holidays constituted discrimination against non-Jewish students. In 2008 he held a class when the university was closed for one of those holidays. When York independently changed its policy the discrimination matter was withdrawn. In his complaint, Noble also alleged that York engaged in a campaign of reprisal against him. The Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario found no reprisal and dismissed Noble&#x27;s complaint in its entirety.

===York Public Access===
In his final years at York, Noble was involved in creating an organization called York Public Access as an alternative to what he identified as an increased corporate slant in the approach taken by York University&#x27;s official media relations department.

<text>Port Credit is a neighbourhood in the south-central part of the City of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, located at the mouth of the Credit River on the north shore of Lake Ontario. Its main intersection is Hurontario Street and Lakeshore Road, about east of the river. Until 1974, Port Credit was an incorporated town. Its approximate boundaries are the Canadian National Railway to the north, Seneca Avenue to the east and Shawnmarr Road to the west. It had a population of 10,260 at the 2001 census.

Port Credit was originally a settlement of the Mississauga Ojibwe First Nations band and a trading post established in 1720 for the exchange of goods from the Europeans for furs trapped by the Mississaugas. After the War of 1812, a harbour was established by the Mississaugas together with European and Jamaican settlers. In 1847, the Mississaugas left the village to relocate on the Six Nations Reserve to be with other band members and first nations. Industry was established on the village periphery including an oil refinery, but the neighbourhood is no longer a substantial industrial district. The village survived into the 20th century, becoming an independent municipality in 1909, until it was merged with the City of Mississauga in 1974.

Today, the original core village is now a heritage conservation district. The harbour is mostly used for recreational boating.

In recent years, the population of Port Credit has increased significantly from condo developments as well as gaining summer attraction from other Mississauga neighbourhoods. A former Imperial Oil property has been cleaned-up and remediated to support residential growth. The 72 arce development will add as many as 3,900 residential units over ground-level retail units. Concerns have been raised about the development&#x27;s impact on local traffic.

==History==
The location of Port Credit was in the 1700s, the land of the Mississauga Ojibwe band. The location became used as a meeting place between the band and white traders, and the river was known to them as the Missinhe or &quot;trusting creek&quot;. To the French and later the English the mouth was known as &quot;Port Credit&quot; and a trading post was established in 1720, where goods were traded or bought on credit. The earliest reference is on a map drawn in 1757 by La Broquerie.

The first permanent structure built by the English at the site was the Government Inn (1798–1861), on the east bank of the river. Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe had ordered construction of the Inn to serve as a way station for travellers by land and lake, and it was leased to a succession of residents until its destruction by fire.

In 1805, the Mississauga gave up much of the surrounding lands, but retained the Credit River, which they held in esteem as the favourite resort of their ancestors. After the War of 1812, the numbers of Mississauga dwindled and they gave up their lands except for a reserve at the mouth, believing the King would protect the land for them in the face of settler encroachment.

Outside the reserve, a village plan was laid out in 1834 and for several years, Port Credit was a thriving harbour community used by the natives and settlers jointly. Village lots were sold to settlers by the natives and the Port Credit Harbour Company, which developed the harbour, was jointly owned. The harbour was a working fishing port and a regional trading centre for grain and other agricultural products. A lighthouse was in use from 1882 to 1918 and remained standing until destroyed by fire in 1936.

On the reserve a sawmill was set up and timber shipped by schooner to locations around the lake. The Credit Mission was set up by Peter Jones to educate the natives and convert them to Christianity. However, by the late 1840s, the forest had been cleared and conditions on the reserve declined. Negotiations were started by the British to move the natives to a homeland near Owen Sound. When the location around Owen Sound was found unsuitable for farming, the Mississauga accepted an offer to move to the Six Nations reserve and left in 1847.

By 1846, the population was about 150. Large quantities of agricultural products were being shipped from the port, and vessels were being built here. Two steamers stopped here between Hamilton and Toronto. The community had two stores, two taverns, a Methodist chapel and a post office. A large area of 4600 acres beside the village was a First Nations Reserve with a chapel and a school.
The port was supplanted as a trading centre for shipping by the coming of the railway. Later in the 19th century, it became known for its stonehooking trade. Other industries such as the St. Lawrence Starch Works (1889–1989) and the Port Credit Brick Yard (1891–1927) provided employment for many local residents. In 1932 L.B. Lloyd built an oil refinery on the old brick yard site and operated by a succession of operators culminating in its purchase by a division of Texaco who operated it until its closing in 1985, when Texaco opened a new much larger facility at Nanticoke on Lake Erie. The tallest structure in Port Credit used to be the smokestack at the St Lawrence Starch plant which has since been demolished. The stack falling marked the change of Port Credit into a residential area from the former industrial hub.

Starting early in the 20th century, particularly after the paving of the Lakeshore Highway in 1915, Port Credit had become an attractive location for business, travellers and people wishing to leave the city of Toronto in summer. In 1960 the Don Rowing Club moved to the banks of the Credit River.

Port Credit&#x27;s Vogue Theatre opened on Lakeshore Road in 1937 and closed for movie goers in 1979. The Art-Deco theatre was repurposed (classic theatre marquee removed) and is now a restaurant/sportsbar.

Port Credit acquired the status of &quot;police village&quot; in 1909, and town status in 1961. The town did not amalgamate with its surrounding township when the Town of Mississauga was created in 1968. Port Credit maintained its independence until the City of Mississauga was incorporated in 1974.

The Adamson Estate, located near the eastern boundary of the neighbourhood, was purchased from the family of Agar Adamson by the Credit Valley Conservation Authority in 1975.

Today the harbour has been redeveloped into a marina on the east bank and a charter fishing centre and public boat launch facility on the west bank under the lighthouse. Port Credit Harbour Marina is the largest public marina in the region. The &quot;Ridgetown&quot; (launched June 24, 1905 as William E. Corey, a lake bulk freighter) has been a structure of Port Credit since June 21, 1974, when she was loaded with stone and, with her cabins and stack still in place, sunk as a breakwater for the Port Credit Harbour.

==Community==
 
The Port Credit arena was constructed between September 10, 1958, and the official opening on October 4, 1959. Built for , it is the second covered arena in the current city of Mississauga, the first public arena built and is the oldest surviving arena in the city. It is the home of the Port Credit Storm hockey teams.

A replica of Port Credit&#x27;s lighthouse was built by the Lions Club of Credit Valley atop a sewage pumping station; it is the home of the local BIA and Tourist Bureau and the logo for many local organizations.

The Port Credit Library, located on 20 Lakeshore Road East, sits beside the Credit River and a large public park. Along with the Lorne Park and Lakeview branches, the Port Credit Library was redeveloped as part of the Government&#x27;s Infrastructure Stimulus Fund beginning in 2009. The $3.1 million renovation project completed in 2013 However, due to a building structure issue, it was closed on June 28, 2021, but reopened in early 2024.

==Tourism==

Port Credit is commonly referred to as Mississauga&#x27;s &quot;Village on the Lake&quot; along Lake Ontario. The area hosts several festivals and events, notably:
*&quot;Waterfront Festival&quot;, which occurs at the end of June
*The &quot;Port Credit In-Water Boat Show&quot;. An annual event, to be held in August, at the Port Credit Harbour Marina. Ontario&#x27;s largest in-water boat show
*&quot;Southside Shuffle&quot; is an annual three-day Blues and Jazz festival in September, founded in 1999 by Chuck Jackson. It includes the Mississauga Music Walk of Fame.
*&quot;Port Credit&#x27;s Busker Fest&quot; held annually in August
*The Marina is located in the center of Port Credit and provides docking for ships up to 45’ in length
*Lakefront Promenade Marina is located Lakefront Promenade park, built in 1991. It has amenities including docking and boating facilities as well as an outdoor eatery for convenience.
*Alongside the protected harbour are 40 hectares of public land including a playground, splash pads, boardwalks, barbecues, and many more amenities.
*Port Credit and the War of 1812 – Port Credit now has scenic tours that include hearing the role of the Mississauga First Nation during the War of 1812, told by a veteran of the 2nd Regiment of the York Militia
*Farmers Market – A farmers market takes place on Saturdays from June 15 to October 24.
*The Mississauga Waterfront Festival is an annual music festival.

With over 600 performers annually, event performers have included Sam Roberts, Jann Arden, Tom Cochrane, Chantal Kreviazuk. In 2012 the festival added the original Monster rock Orchestra Show with a set that had waterfall backdrops and a laser light show that was synchronized with the orchestra. Children&#x27;s performers have included Max &amp; Ruby, The Backyardigans, Barney the Dinosaur, Dora the Explorer, Babar the Elephant, and Shrek. Aside from entertainment performances, the event includes educational programs focused on the topics of endangered species, health and wellness, and conservation.
*Port Credit has over 225 kilometers of scenic walkways and trails that accentuate the beauty of the district.

==Transportation==

Port Credit started as a shipping centre in 1834 with harbour improvements paid for by the government. In 1855, a branch of the Great Western Railway was added.

Lakeshore Road, formerly Highway 2, runs along the lake and Hurontario Street, formerly Highway 10, runs northwest to the Mississauga City Centre, Brampton, and beyond. Two bridges including an arch bridge over the Credit was replaced by the current two span box grider bridges.

Port Credit had access to the nearby Queen Elizabeth Way from the upgrading of the old Middle Road from Highway 27 to Highway 10 to a divided highway in 1931.

Over the years the railway has expanded to three tracks; its prime importance to Port Credit is the GO Train service carrying residents to and from Toronto. The majority of the residences are within walking distance of the Port Credit GO Station just north of the intersection of Lakeshore and Hurontario Street. This is a transportation hub of Southern Mississauga, linking both the city&#x27;s public transit system; MiWay, and GO Transit.

<text>Alexander Cintrón (born December 17, 1978) is a Puerto Rican former professional baseball infielder and current hitting coach for the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in MLB for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Chicago White Sox, Baltimore Orioles, and Washington Nationals.

==Playing career==
===Arizona Diamondbacks===
Cintrón was drafted in the 36th round (1,103rd overall) of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft by the Arizona Diamondbacks. He spent the 1997 season with the Arizona League Diamondbacks where he hit .197 with six doubles, a triple and 20 RBI in 43 games. He also appeared in one game with the Lethbridge Black Diamonds in the Pioneer League and went 1-for-3.

In 1998, Cintrón spent the season with Rookie-League Lethbridge and hit .264 with 11 doubles, four triples, three home runs and 34 RBI in 67 games. 

Cintrón hit .307 with 25 doubles, four triples, three home runs and 64 RBI in 128 games with the Class-A Advanced High Desert Mavericks during the 1999 season. He was also named to the California League All-Star team.

Cintrón played in 125 games for the Double-A El Paso Diablos and hit .301 with 30 doubles, six triples, four home runs and 59 RBIs in 2000. He was fourth in the Texas League in hits with 157, fifth in at-bats with 522 and tenth in average. He was also named to the Texas League All-Star team.

In 2001, Cintrón hit .292 with 24 doubles, three triples, three home runs and 35 RBIs in 107 games for the Triple-A Tucson Sidewinders. He was recalled from Tucson to the Diamondbacks on July 23. Cintrón made his major league debut with the D-Backs on July 24, 2001. He collected his first major-league hit with a single off the New York Mets&#x27; Donne Wall on August 3. Cintrón hit .286 with a triple in eight games with the Diamondbacks, and was optioned back to Tucson on August 6.

Cintrón played in 38 games with the D&#x27;Backs over four separate stints in 2002, batting .213 with 4 RBI. He was initially recalled on May 8, but played in just two games. He was recalled a second time on June 11 and reported to Yankee Stadium to play against the New York Yankees. He was optioned to Tucson again on June 26, but returned on July 1 after Erubiel Durazo was injured. Cintrón was returned to Tucson after the All-Star Break but was recalled for the final time on August 21.

In 2003, Cintrón had a break-out season after being recalled on May 6 following an injury to Craig Counsell. Cintrón went on to lead Arizona with a .317 average, ranked second with 26 doubles and third with 70 runs scored and a .489 slugging percentage. He started 90 games at shortstop, 14 at third base and five at second base. He batted .311 with runners in scoring position. He hit his first major-league home run on May 14 against the Philadelphia Phillies, a solo shot off Brett Myers. Cintrón posted three straight three-hit games from June 14 to June 17. He hit his first walk-off home run on June 20 against the Cincinnati Reds off Scott Williamson.

Cintrón continued his success into 2004, where he led the Diamondbacks in games played (154) and at-bats (564) and finished second in doubles (31) and third in hits (148). He was the everyday shortstop for most of the season until a late-season stretch of starts at second base. Cintrón became the first player in franchise history to hit a home run from both sides of the plate on July 8 against the San Francisco Giants, hitting a solo home run off Dustin Hermanson in the fourth inning and a three-run shot off Wayne Franklin in the seventh, finishing with a career-high 4 RBI.

Cintrón appeared in 122 games with Arizona in 2005, down from 154 in 2004. He played in 39 games at shortstop, 32 at third base and 23 at second base. He hit .304 with three doubles, three home runs and 12 RBIs as a pinch-hitter, sharing the major-league lead among pinch-hitters in home runs, tied for third in the National League in RBIs and ranked ninth in average. He hit the pinch-hit homers off Jim Brower, Kent Mercker and Jon Lieber. Cintrón had four walk-off hits during the season, the most in MLB in 2005.

===Chicago White Sox===
On March 8, 2006, Cintrón was traded to the Chicago White Sox for Jeff Bajenaru. That season, Cintrón made 41 appearances at shortstop, 26 at second base and 11 at third base, compiling a .972 fielding percentage. Cintrón stole a career high 10 bases. He batted .288 with all of his five home runs left-handed and .274 from the right side of the plate. He went only 2–18 as a pinch hitter. Cintrón recorded at least one at-bat in all positions in the lineup except leadoff, his best spot being second batting .315. He made two starts at designated hitter going 2–12 and hit .310 in interleague play. Cintrón hit two triples on April 13 against the Detroit Tigers, the first Sox player to accomplish the feat since José Valentín in 2004.

He batted .243 with two home runs and 19 RBI in 68 games in his second season with the White Sox in 2007. He made 19 appearances at third base, 17 at shortstop and 14 at second base. He also made two starts as designated hitter going 0–7. Cintrón compiled a .941 fielding percentage and batted .244 with two home runs left-handed and from the right side of the plate. He hit .273 on the road, compared to .209 at home. He hit .333 with runners in scoring position. The White Sox waived Cintrón on November 28, 2007.

===Baltimore Orioles===
Cintrón signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Chicago Cubs on February 18, 2008. He was released on March 26, and was signed to another minor league contract by the Baltimore Orioles on March 31. After starting the season with the Norfolk Tides, his contract was purchased by the Orioles, and he was added to the active roster on May 11. He went 4-for-4 in his first start with Baltimore on May 17 against the Washington Nationals. On July 1, Cintrón was placed on the disabled list with a strained left hamstring. He was activated on August 1. He hit .352 at Camden Yards. 27 of 28 starts came at shortstop. Cintrón filed for free agency after the 2008 season.

===Washington Nationals===

Cintrón signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals for the 2009 season. Although he competed for a spot on the Nationals&#x27; roster during spring training, Cintrón was sent to the minors on April 4. His contract was purchased from the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs on April 18. He went 2-for-26 (.077) in 21 games with the Nationals before he was designated for assignment on May 19.

===Later career===
On July 8, 2009, Cintrón signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners. He played 30 games with the Triple-A Tacoma Rainiers, batting .248 with two home runs and 9 RBI. After the 2009 season, he signed a minor league deal with the New York Mets. With the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons, Cintrón batted .228 with a home run and 3 RBI in 20 games.

On February 8, 2011, Cintrón signed a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals. He signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres on May 3, 2011.

On May 24, 2011, Padres minor league broadcaster Tim Hagerty announced through Twitter that Cintrón had retired. No details were given; the tweet simply said &quot;Alex Cintron has retired.&quot; It was reported on July 18 that he was considering coming out of retirement.

In early 2012, Cintrón came out of retirement to play for the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.

==Coaching career==
Cintrón was Manager of the Azucareros de Yabucoa (his hometown) in Puerto Rico&#x27;s Superior Baseball League (Double A Category).

The Houston Astros hired Cintrón as the club&#x27;s Spanish-language interpreter, advance scout, and assistant coach for the 2017 season. He served as the Astros&#x27; first base coach in 2018. The Astros reassigned him as hitting coach following the 2019 season.

On August 11, 2020, Cintrón was suspended 20 games for inciting a brawl with Ramón Laureano on August 9, one of the longest ever suspensions of an MLB coach for an on-field incident. Cintrón had stepped out of the Astros dugout onto the field and taunted Laureano to approach him, as if to fight, after Laureano complained about getting hit by pitches. Cintrón remained behind several Astros players when Laureano charged at him.

Cintrón was announced as the first manager of RA12 before their inaugural 2020–21 season but withdrew from the team in late October due to health concerns.

In 2022, the Astros won 106 games, the second-highest total in franchise history. They advanced to the World Series and defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in six games. In the pivotal Game 6, Cintron and fellow hitting coach Troy Snitker noticed that Yordan Alvarez had a hitch in his swing (namely due to his weight being shifted in his front leg) that merited adjustment. Cintron looked at video from a few months ago and saw that Alvarez&#x27;s hands had dropped in his stance from June, which made it harder to deal with a fastball. Alvarez would go on to hit the go-ahead home run in the sixth inning to deliver the championship. The win gave Cintrón his first World Series title as an Astro. 

Prior to the 2023 season, the Toronto Blue Jays interviewed Cintrón for their bench coach position. While the Blue Jays had still yet to finalize their decision, it was announced on November 21, 2022, that the Astros signed Cintrón to a contract to remain through the 2025 season.

<text>Rear Admiral Basil Charles Godfrey Place, (19 July 1921 – 27 December 1994), known as Godfrey Place, was an officer in the Royal Navy and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Naval career==

Place was 22 years old, and a lieutenant in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. On 22 September 1943 at Kåfjord, North Norway, Lieutenant Place, commanding Midget Submarine &quot;X7&quot;, and another lieutenant (Donald Cameron) commanding Midget Submarine X.6, carried out a most daring and successful attack on the German Battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot;. The two submarines had to travel at least 1,000 miles from base, negotiate a mine-field, dodge nets, gun defenses and enemy listening posts. Having eluded all these hazards they finally placed the charges underneath the ship where they went off an hour later, doing so much damage that &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was out of action for months. 

Place and other five officers captured at Kåfjord were transferred to Marlag-O, the German prison camp for British naval officers at Westertimke.

The full citation was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 18 February 1944 (dated 22 February 1944) and read:


Place was awarded the Polish Cross of Valour for his service as liaison officer in the Polish submarine ORP &quot;Sokół&quot; and the Distinguished Service Cross for his role in the sinking of the Italian submarine &quot;Guglielmotti&quot; by off Sicily in March 1942.

In 1950, Place took the unusual step for a submariner of transferring to the Fleet Air Arm, training as a pilot and gaining his &quot;wings&quot; in 1952. Later that year he saw action in the Korean War, flying the Sea Fury in 801 Squadron from the deck of the carrier . He later achieved the rank of rear admiral, and retired from the navy in June 1970.

==The medal==
Place&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed at the Imperial War Museum in London.

<doc id="1223734" wikidata="Q5529760" url="?curid=1223734" title="Gee Street Records">
<text>Gee Street Records was a British hip hop record label started by Jon Baker, Rachel O&#x27;Neill, Stereo MC&#x27;s and DJ Richie Rich in 1985. The label&#x27;s name came from its original location, a converted warehouse on Gee Street (off Old Street) in London.
Between 1980 and 1984, label head Baker lived in New York City. After returning to London in 1984, he became a hip-hop promoter, and in 1985 opened Gee Street Records and began releasing white-label dance and hip-hop records. Many of these broke new ground. The label developed a roster of prominent domestic UK acts, including DJ Richie Rich, Outlaw Posse, and Stereo MC&#x27;s, and US acts, including P.M. Dawn, Doug E. Fresh, Gravediggaz, and New Kingdom.

In 1990, Gee Street was acquired by Chris Blackwell&#x27;s Island Records. After Blackwell left Island and the PolyGram group in 1998, Baker bought back Gee Street and sold it to Richard Branson&#x27;s fledgling V2 Records. The label was shuttered in 2001.

In 2006, V2 sold its American catalogue, including Gee Street, to Sheridan Square Entertainment, home of Artemis Records. In 2010, Artemis was sold to Entertainment One Music.

<text>The WASTE (an acronym for WorldScript-aware styled text engine) is an Apple Macintosh text editing software library. WASTE helps Macintosh programmers include advanced text display and editing in their applications.

WASTE is a memory-based editor, which places no arbitrary limit on the amount of text being edited, up to available system memory. It supports the Macintosh WorldScript system, allowing it to handle double-byte character sets and bi-directional text. It includes automatic support for undo operations, drag and drop editing, text justification, embedding images into text, and low-level hooks for rendering and measuring text.

WASTE version 2.0 gained support for paragraph-level formatting, additional character styles, multiple undo and redo operations, Unicode translation, and Mac OS X Carbon support, as well as providing new application programming interfaces (APIs) for printing and string matching.

WASTE is a popular third party library used in many Macintosh applications, formerly under the Classic Mac OS and more recently under Mac OS X, including Netscape Navigator, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft Outlook for Mac, REALbasic, and Tex-Edit Plus.

Since WASTE uses deprecated QuickDraw features, it was deprecated in Mac OS X version 10.4 and unsupported as of version 10.6.

<text>Brigadier General Edmund John Phipps-Hornby, (31 December 1857 – 13 December 1947) was a British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==
Phipps-Hornby was born in Lordington House, Hampshire on 31 December 1857, the son of the Admiral of the Fleet Sir Geoffrey Phipps Hornby. He was the brother of Captain Geoffrey Stanley Phipps-Hornby and Admiral Robert Phipps Hornby.

He was promoted to captain in February 1886.

==Victoria Cross details==
Phipps-Hornby was 42 years old, and a major commanding Q Battery, Royal Horse Artillery, British Army, during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

On 31 March 1900 at Sanna&#x27;s Post (aka Korn Spruit), South Africa, &#x27;Q&#x27; and &#x27;U&#x27; batteries of the Royal Horse Artillery were ambushed with the loss of most of the baggage column and five guns of the leading battery. When the alarm was given &#x27;Q&#x27; Battery, commanded by Major Phipps Hornby, went into action 1150 yards from the spruit, until the order to retire was received, when the major commanded that the guns and their limbers be run back by hand to a safe place — a most exhausting operation over a considerable distance, but at last all but one of the guns and one limber had been moved to safety and the battery reformed. The citation reads:
The following men were also awarded the Victoria Cross in the same action: Lieutenant Francis Maxwell, Sergeant Charles Parker, Gunner Isaac Lodge and Driver Horace Glasock.

==Further information==
Following his return to the United Kingdom, Phipps Hornby served as Aide-de-camp to Lord Roberts when he was Commander-in-Chief from 1901 to 1903. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in July 1903. In September 1909, after having been on the half-pay list, he was promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier general and became commander, Royal Artillery of the 4th Division.

He later served in the First World War. He achieved the rank of brigadier general granted upon his retirement in 1918, after 40 years of service. His grave and memorial are in St Andrew&#x27;s churchyard at Sonning in Berkshire.

==Family==
Phipps-Hornby married, on 31 January 1895, Anna Jay, daughter of Mr. Jay, of Blendon Hall, Bexley, Kent. They had two daughters:
* Evelyn Irene Sophie Phipps-Hornby (1895–1993), married Brigadier Hubert Francis Lucas (1897-1990), of the Lucas baronets, of Ashtead park
* Betty Angela Phipps-Hornby (1902–1982), married Charles Lansdell Tapply

==The medal==
Brigadier General Phipps Hornby&#x27;s Victoria Cross and other medals are displayed at the Royal Artillery Museum, Woolwich, England.

<doc id="1223753" wikidata="Q751079" url="?curid=1223753" title="The Three Tenors">
<text>The Three Tenors were an operatic singing trio, active between 1990 and 2003, and termed a supergroup (a title normally reserved for rock and pop groups) consisting of Italian Luciano Pavarotti and Spaniards Plácido Domingo and José Carreras. The trio began their collaboration with a performance at the ancient Baths of Caracalla in Rome, Italy, on 7 July 1990, the eve of the 1990 FIFA World Cup final, watched by a global television audience of around 800 million. The image of three tenors in formal evening dress singing in a World Cup concert captivated the global audience. The recording of this debut concert became the best-selling classical album of all time and led to additional performances and live albums. They performed to a global television audience at three further World Cup Finals: 1994 in Los Angeles, 1998 in Paris, and 2002 in Yokohama. They also toured other cities around the world, usually performing in stadiums or similar large arenas to huge audiences. They last performed together at Schottenstein Center in Columbus, Ohio, on 28 September 2003.

The Three Tenors repertoire ranged from opera to Broadway to Neapolitan songs and pop hits. The group&#x27;s signature songs included &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; from Puccini&#x27;s opera &quot;Turandot&quot;, usually sung by Pavarotti, and the song &quot;&#x27;O sole mio&quot;, which all three tenors typically sang together.

==History==

Italian producer Mario Dradi, along with German producer Elmar Kruse and British composer and producer Herbert Chappell, conceived the idea of the first concert in 1990 in Rome. It was held to raise money for Carreras&#x27;s foundation, the &quot;José Carreras International Leukemia Foundation&quot;. It was also a way for his friends Domingo and Pavarotti to welcome Carreras back into the world of opera after undergoing successful treatment for leukemia. The Three Tenors first performed in a concert for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Zubin Mehta conducted the orchestra of Maggio Musicale Fiorentino and the orchestra of Teatro dell&#x27;Opera di Roma. The performance captivated the global audience. A filmed version of the concert was produced by Herbert Chappell and Gian Carlo Bertelli for Decca and became the highest-selling classical disc in history.

The three subsequently sang together in concerts produced by Hungarian Tibor Rudas and other producers, at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles to coincide the final match of the 1994 FIFA World Cup, at the Champ de Mars under the Eiffel Tower during the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and in Yokohama for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Nearly 50,000 people attended their 1994 concert at Dodger Stadium and around 1.3 billion viewers worldwide watched it.

Following the big success of the 1990 and 1994 concerts, The Three Tenors opened a world tour of concerts during 1996–1997. In 1996 they performed at Kasumigaoka Stadium in Tokyo, at Wembley Stadium in London, at Ernst Happel Stadion in Vienna, at Giants Stadium outside of New York City, at Ullevi Stadium in Gothenburg, Sweden, at Olympic Stadium in Munich, at Rheinstadion in Düsseldorf and at BC Place in Vancouver on New Year&#x27;s Eve. In 1997 concerts followed at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, at Skydome in Toronto, at Pro Player Stadium in Miami and at Camp Nou in Barcelona. The tour was scheduled to end in Houston with a final concert which was eventually canceled due to very low ticket sales. In addition to their 1996–1997 world tour, The Three Tenors also performed two benefit concerts – one in Pavarotti&#x27;s hometown Modena in the summer of 1997 and one in Domingo&#x27;s home town Madrid in the following winter – in order to raise money for the rebuilding of the Teatro La Fenice in Venice and the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona and for the Queen Sofia Foundation.

A second series of concerts outside of the FIFA World cup events held again in 1999 including cities like Tokyo, Pretoria and Detroit followed by a Christmas concert in Vienna in December the same year. In 2000 the Three Tenors toured again performing live in San Jose, California, Las Vegas, Washington, D.C., Cleveland and São Paulo. However, the production had to cancel two planned concerts for this tour; one in Hamburg on 16 June due to difficulties in finding a suitable orchestra and conductor, and another one in Albany, New York, on 22 July due to poor ticket sales. The later one was replaced by the Brazilian concert in São Paulo. One more benefit concert was given by The Three Tenors in December 2000 in Chicago to donate the AIDS Foundation of Chicago. In 2001 two more concerts were given in Asia: one in Seoul and one in Beijing inside the walls of the Forbidden City. Finally in 2003 they performed in Bath at the Royal Crescent and later in September the same year they gave their last Three Tenors&#x27; concert, which took place at the Schottenstein Center in Columbus, Ohio. A Three Tenors reunion concert was scheduled to take place on 4 June 2005 at the Parque Fundidora in Monterrey, Mexico, but because of Pavarotti&#x27;s health problems, he was replaced by Mexican pop singer Alejandro Fernández.
== Recordings ==
The concerts were a huge commercial success, and were accompanied by a series of best-selling recordings, including the original &quot;Carreras-Domingo-Pavarotti in Concert&quot;, subsequently reissued as &quot;The Three Tenors In Concert&quot; (which holds the Guinness World Record for the best-selling classical music album), &quot;The Three Tenors in Concert 1994&quot;, &quot;The Three Tenors: Paris 1998&quot;, &quot;The Three Tenors Christmas&quot;, and &quot;The Best of The Three Tenors&quot;. Zubin Mehta conducted the performances in 1990 and 1994. The Paris concert was conducted by James Levine.

Carreras and Domingo have appeared together on a number of other albums including &quot;Gala Lirica&quot; (with various other artists), &quot;Christmas In Vienna&quot; (with Diana Ross), and &quot;Christmas in Moscow&quot; (with Sissel Kyrkjebø).

==Royalties==
For their initial appearance together in Rome in 1990, Carreras, Domingo, and Pavarotti agreed to accept relatively small flat fees for the recording rights to their concert, which they then donated to charity. Their album unexpectedly reaped millions in profits for Decca Records, causing some resentment on the part of the tenors, who officially received no royalty payments. As reported in the press, Domingo suspected that the record company paid Pavarotti on the side, in order to keep one of their top contracted artists content. Pavarotti denied this, insisting: &quot;We got nothing.&quot; Years later his former agent and manager Herbert Breslin wrote that Pavarotti had indeed secretly received $1.5 million that the other two tenors, who were not under contract to Decca, did not receive. For subsequent concerts and recordings, the singers were much more careful in assuring financially advantageous contractual terms for themselves.

==Criticism==

While the Three Tenors were applauded by many for introducing opera to a wider audience, some opera purists criticised the group. Domingo responded to critics in a 1998 interview: &quot;The purists, they say this is not opera. Of course it&#x27;s not opera, it doesn&#x27;t pretend to be an opera. It&#x27;s a concert in which we sing some opera, we sing some songs, we do some zarzuela, then we do a medley of songs... We respect very much when people criticise it. That&#x27;s fine. They shouldn&#x27;t come... But they should leave the people who are coming and are happy.&quot;

Other critics such as Martin Bernheimer complained that the tenors performed for excessive financial remuneration, rather than art. On their first worldwide tour, each tenor received around one million dollars per concert – unheard of for classical musicians. In a joint interview with his colleagues, Pavarotti responded to complaints about their incomes: &quot;We make the money we deserve. We&#x27;re not forcing someone to pay us.&quot; Domingo added about the world of opera: &quot;I am giving 17 performances in 25 days. Ask me how much I get for that... For 30 years we have given in blood the best of our lives and our careers. You think we don&#x27;t deserve money?&quot; Carreras, for his part, stressed how little they made compared to many athletes, pop singers, and movie stars.

==Legal issues==
The success of the Three Tenors led to antitrust action by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission against Warner Bros. and Vivendi Universal. It found that they had conspired not to advertise or discount the albums of the Rome concert (released by PolyGram, later taken over by Vivendi) and of the Los Angeles concert (released by Warner Bros.) in order to protect sales of the jointly released album of the 1998 Paris concert.

The Three Tenors also encountered trouble with the German government. In 1999, two of the three singers paid an undisclosed fine to the German government as part of an out-of-court settlement for tax evasion. In addition, the German government accused the tenors of owing large back-taxes. Their concert organizer and promoter, Matthias Hoffmann, who was in charge of their taxes at the time, was sentenced to jail time for his role in the alleged tax evasion.
==In popular culture==
* Throughout the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Doll&quot;, José Carreras is repeatedly referred to as &quot;the other guy&quot;, while the names of Domingo and Pavarotti are easily recalled.
* The &quot;Animaniacs&quot; episode &quot;Three Tenors and You&#x27;re Out&quot; featured a parody of the trio performing at Dodger Stadium.
* The Canadian sketch comedy series &quot;Royal Canadian Air Farce&quot; parodied The Three Tenors in a sketch.
* In &quot;Encore! Encore!&quot;, Nathan Lane plays an opera singer who was to become &quot;the Fourth Tenor&quot; before injuring his voice.
* The trio was featured on the MTV animated show &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot;, in a match against The Three Stooges.
* In the Japanese version of Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D&#x27;s, The Three Emperors of Yliaster are named after the Three Tenors.

<text>John George Pattison (8 September 1875 – 3 June 1917) was a Canadian soldier. Pattison was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for valour in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Pattison was born in London, England and emigrated to Canada. He and his family (wife and four children) settled in Calgary where he found a job with the Calgary Gas Company. He was killed in fighting during the Battle of Vimy Ridge the same year he won the VC.

==Details==
Pattison enlisted at Calgary, Alberta on 6 March 1916. A son had already enlisted and Pattison enlisted, at the age of 40, so that he would be able to protect his son, the story goes. As the war unfolded, he was sent to France while his son stayed in England.

One of four soldiers to earn the Victoria Cross at the Battle of Vimy Ridge, (the others were Thain Wendell MacDowell, Ellis Wellwood Sifton and William Johnstone Milne), Pattison was 41 years old, and a private in the 50th (Calgary) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force, during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 10 April 1917 at the Battle of Vimy Ridge, in the area of Hill 145 (the location of today&#x27;s Memorial), when the advance of Canadian troops was held up by an enemy machine-gun that was inflicting severe casualties, Private Pattison, with utter disregard of his own safety, sprang forward and jumping from shell-hole to shell-hole, reached cover within thirty yards of the enemy gun. From this point, in the face of heavy fire he hurled bombs killing and wounding some of the crew, and then rushed forward overcoming and bayoneting the surviving five gunners. His initiative and valour undoubtedly saved the situation.

He was killed in action at Lens, France, on 3 June 1917. He is buried at La Chaudière Military Cemetery, France located 7 miles north of Arras (plot IV, row C, grave 14).

A mountain in the Victoria Cross Ranges in Jasper National Park, Alberta is named in his honour. The City of Calgary named a bridge over the Elbow River to recognize Pte. Pattison.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Glenbow Museum in Calgary, Alberta.

<doc id="1223764" wikidata="Q5314924" url="?curid=1223764" title="Dundurn Castle">
<text>Dundurn Castle is a historic neoclassical mansion on York Boulevard in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. The house took three years and $175,000 to build and was completed in 1835.

The forty-room castle featured the latest conveniences of the day, including gas lighting and running water. It is currently owned by the City of Hamilton, which purchased it in 1899 or 1900 for $50,000. The city has spent nearly $3 million renovating the site to make it open to the public. The rooms have been restored to the year 1855 when its owner Sir Allan Napier MacNab, 1st Baronet, was at the height of his career. Costumed interpreters guide visitors through the home, illustrating daily life from the 1850s. Camilla, Queen of Canada, a descendant of Sir Allan MacNab, is the Royal Patron of Dundurn Castle.

==History==
Dundurn Castle, a Regency house, was completed in 1835 by architect Robert Charles Wetherell. Sir Allan MacNab purchased the property from Richard Beasley, one of Hamilton&#x27;s early settlers, who was forced by financial difficulties to sell lands at Burlington Heights (now Dundurn Park). MacNab built Dundurn Castle on the foundations of Beasley&#x27;s brick home. Once built, Dundurn Castle became famous across Canada for its grand entertainments. Sir John A. Macdonald and King Edward VII are among those who have been entertained there.

MacNab, later Premier of the Province of Canada between 1854 and 1856, hired architect Robert Wetherall and construction of this stately home was completed in 1835. The pillars and portico were added in 1855 as part of the preparations for the wedding of MacNab&#x27;s daughter Sophia.

After MacNab&#x27;s death, the estate was used as an institution for the deaf and was purchased in 1872 by Donald McInnes, who sold Dundurn to the City of Hamilton in 1899. On June 1, 1928, the Hamilton Aviary at Dundurn Castle opened to the public. In the late 1960s, Dundurn Castle was restored as a Centennial project and is now designated as a National Historic Site of Canada. In 1996, the Aviary was relocated to Churchill Park in Westdale.

A Strathspey for bagpipes was composed in honour of Dundurn Castle.

==Hamilton Military Museum==
The park includes Hamilton Military Museum, which is housed in an outbuilding which was relocated when York Street was widened as York Boulevard in the 1970s. Displays include the War of 1812, the Rebellions of 1837, the Boer War, World War I, World War II and the role of women in the military. Artifacts include uniforms, medals, weapons, photographs and other military memorabilia. The museum also features a library with materials about Canadian military history, which is open by appointment.

==Grounds==

Dundurn Castle operates as a civic museum, and its grounds house other attractions. Dundurn Park and its associated green spaces are favourites for wedding portraits. The Cockpit Theatre occasionally housed outdoor events and dramas.

A large German artillery piece, booty from the World War I, was removed from the southeastern part of the park in the mid-1980s. Until about 1990, it housed an aviary, which was moved to the Westdale neighbourhood. The covered pavilion formerly offered picnickers protection from the cold, but in the last few years a walled garden was put in its place. The gates at the front entrance of the park originally came from England, but the stone pillars were cut from the Dundas mountain. In 1931, parts of the gates were removed and taken to the Chedoke Golf Club.
Dundurn Park has its own folly, just east of the castle. Living up to its purpose, it had confused some people who had considered it a theatre, a laundry, a boat-house, a buttery, an office, a chapel for Sir Allan&#x27;s Roman Catholic wife, or even a cockfighting ring, but no proof of the last use has ever been found. Urban legend has it that many tunnels exist, leading from the Castle to various parts of the estate and one of the entrances was through the folly.

MacNab was originally buried in 1862 on the Dundurn Park grounds between Dundurn Castle and Castle Dean on the corner of Locke Street and Tecumseh Street. In 1909, his body was removed and taken to Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in western Hamilton. His grave was unmarked until 1967, when the Canadian Club of Hamilton placed a bench and grave marker.

A 360-degree curved plaque was unveiled at Fieldcote Museum in Ancaster on July 20, 2014, marking the 200th anniversary of the most important and largest mass hanging in Canadian history, the execution of nine men convicted of treason during the War of 1812. The event is known locally as The Bloody Assize. The men were taken from York (now Toronto), the capital of Upper Canada, and executed near present-day Inchbury Street at the eastern end of Dundurn Park. Their burial place nearby has not yet been discovered by archaeological research.

A large garden is cultivated near the eastern edge of the park. The produce is used in the castle&#x27;s kitchen, and the excess is donated to a local food bank. Tours of the castle end in the kitchen, where samples of cuisine of the era are offered to tourists.

<doc id="1223775" wikidata="Q8000138" url="?curid=1223775" title="Wilbraham Lennox">
<text>Lieutenant-General Sir Wilbraham Oates Lennox (4 August 1830 – 7 February 1897) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the first Royal Engineer officer to win the VC.

==Early life==
Lennox was born at Goodwood, West Sussex, the son of Lord John Lennox and Louisa Frederica Rodney, and the grandson of Charles Lennox, Duke of Richmond and Captain John Rodney, RN. Lennox attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and in June 1848 was commissioned second-lieutenant in the Royal Engineers. After further training he was posted to Ceylon in 1850, leaving in 1854 to take part in the Crimean War. Here he took part in the Battle of Inkerman and the Siege of Sevastopol.

==VC action==
Lennox was a 24 years old lieutenant in the Corps of Royal Engineers, British Army, at the Siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War, when he was awarded the VC for his:

For his Crimea service, Lennox was also mentioned in dispatches and received the Ottoman Order of the Medjidieh (fifth class) and the Sardinian Medal of Military Valor.

==Later career==
Returning to England in August 1856, Lennox left again in April 1857 for China. His engineer company was however diverted to India and served in the Indian Mutiny. After service at Lucknow, Lennox was mentioned in dispatches and received brevet promotions of major and lieutenant-colonel. He left India in March 1859, and was on the staff of the School of Military Engineering, Chatham from 1866 to 1873. In March 1867 he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB).

Lennox was attached as an observer to the German army during the 1870–71 Franco-Prussian War, and attended Prussian military manoeuvres in 1869 and 1872. After home service, he became military attaché at Constantinople in October 1876, and accompanied the Turkish armies during the Russo-Turkish War. He commanded the Royal Engineers at the Curragh, Ireland, from 1878 until his promotion to major-general in August 1881. From August 1884 he commanded the garrison at Alexandria, Egypt, and was responsible for landing the troops and stores for the 1884–85 Gordon relief expedition. In April 1887 he moved to command the troops in Ceylon, returning home in 1888 on promotion to lieutenant-general. He was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in May 1891 and was director-general of military education at the War Office from January 1893 until his retirement in May 1895.

Lennox died at his home in Pimlico, London, on 7 February 1897, aged 66.

==Family==
Lennox was married twice. The first marriage was to Mary Harriet Harris, and produced two children: Gerald Wilbraham Stuart Lennox, born on 29 April 1862, and Lilian Emily Lennox, born on 19 July 1863. Mrs Lennox died soon after, on 22 July 1863, and her infant daughter died a few days later, on 3 August 1863. The second marriage was to Susan Hay Sinclair, a descendant of the Sinclair-Lockhart baronets. This marriage produced five children.

==Legacy==
Lennox was buried in the family plot in Lewes Road (Woodvale) Cemetery, Brighton, Sussex. In 2013 the Victoria Cross Trust launched a campaign to raise £25,000 to restore his grave, that had been neglected and was in a state of disrepair. 
Lennox&#x27;s medals, including his Victoria Cross, are displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum, Gillingham, Kent.

Lennox Row, a road in Brompton, Gillingham, Kent is named after him.

<text>Tebhaga movement (1946–1947) was significant peasant agitation, initiated in Bengal by the All India Kisan Sabha of peasant front of the Communist Party of India.

== History ==
At that time sharecroppers had contracted to give half of their harvest to the landlords. The demand of the &quot;Tebhaga&quot; (sharing by thirds) movement was to reduce the landlord share to one third. In many areas the agitations turned violent, and landlords fled, leaving parts of the countryside in the hands of Kisan Sabha. In 1946 sharecroppers began to assert that they would pay only one-third and that before division the crop would stay in their godowns and not that of the Jotedars. The sharecroppers were encouraged by the fact that the Bengal Land Revenue Commission had already made this recommendation in its report to the government. The movement resulted in clashes between Jotedars and Bargadars (sharecroppers). As a response to the agitation, the Muslim League ministry in the province launched the Bargadari Act, which provided that the share of the harvest given to the landlords would be limited to one third of the total. However, the law was not fully implemented. The Bengal Land Revenue Commission popularly known as Floud Commission had made recommendation in favour of the share-croppers.

===The movement in 24 Parganas===
During the Bengal Famine of 1943 the Communist Party of India provided relief to the peasantry of the Sundarbans area. In September 1946 Bangiya Pradeshik Kisan Sabha decided to launch the Tebhaga movement. The peasant movement broke out in Kakdwip, Sonarpur, Bhangar and Canning. Kakdwip and Namkhana were the storm centres of the movement. The movement aimed at improving the share of the peasant engaged as sharecroppers. The movement continued till 1950, when the Bargadari Act was enacted. The act recognised the right of the sharecropper to two-thirds of the produce when he provided the inputs. During 1946-1950 the Tebhaga movement in several parts of the 24 Parganas district led to the enactment of the Bargadari Act. Although the Bargadari Act of 1950 recognised the rights of bargadars to a higher share of crops from the land that they tilled, it was not implemented. Large tracts, beyond the prescribed limit of land ceiling, remained with the rich landlords. In 1967, West Bengal witnessed peasant uprising, against non-implementation of land reforms legislation, starting from Kheadaha gram panchayat in Sonarpur CD block. From 1977 onwards major land reforms took place in West Bengal under the Left Front government. Land in excess of land ceiling was acquired and distributed amongst the peasants. Subsequently, “Operation Barga” was aimed at securing tenancy rights for the peasants.

== In Both Bengals ==
Hindus and Muslims alike participated in this peasant movement, avoiding the riots and communal hatred of forty-six years. The principle of Indian Communist Party was peasant unity on the basis of which the Tebhaga movement spread from district to district leaving aside all fratricidal feuds. Peasant struggles in East and West Bengal were united through the formation of associations, the formation of women workers, struggle funds and political education classes. Farmers from the remote areas of Sundarbans to various parts of North Bengal raised their demand for Tevaga. The main leaders of this movement include Kansari Halder, Ganesh Das, Ajit Bose, Bishnu Chattopadhyay, Ila Mitra, Haji Mohammad Danesh, Debaprasad Ghosh (Patal Ghosh), Sushil Sen, Noor Jalal, Krishnavinod Roy, Bimal Dasgupta, Bhupal Panda, Rupanarayan Roy, Dr. Ganendranath Sarkar, Kali Sarkar. Wide participation of women was one of the characteristics of Tevaga. The first martyrs of Tevaga movement were Samir Uddin and Shivram Majhi of Talpukur village of Chirirbandar upazila of Dinajpur district. Samir Uddin was a Muslim and Shivram Majhi belonged to the tribal Hasda community.

==Impact==
Hare Krishna Konar played a leading role in getting surplus land held by big land owners in excess of land ceiling laws and kept ‘benami’ (or false names) vested with the state. The quantum of land thus vested was around one million acres (4,000 km²) of good agricultural land. Subsequently, under the leadership of Benoy Choudhury, this land was distributed amongst 2.4 million landless and poor farmers.

<doc id="1223782" wikidata="Q2462024" url="?curid=1223782" title="Triflate">
<text>In organic chemistry, triflate (systematic name: trifluoromethanesulfonate), is a functional group with the formula and structure . The triflate group is often represented by , as opposed to −Tf, which is the triflyl group, . For example, &quot;n&quot;-butyl triflate can be written as .

The corresponding triflate anion, , is an extremely stable polyatomic ion; this comes from the fact that triflic acid () is a superacid; i.e. it is more acidic than pure sulfuric acid, already one of the strongest acids known.

==Applications==
A triflate group is an excellent leaving group used in certain organic reactions such as nucleophilic substitution, Suzuki couplings and Heck reactions. Since alkyl triflates are extremely reactive in SN2 reactions, they must be stored in conditions free of nucleophiles (such as water). The anion owes its stability to resonance stabilization which causes the negative charge to be spread symmetrically over the three oxygen atoms. An additional stabilization is achieved by the trifluoromethyl group, which acts as a strong electron-withdrawing group using the sulfur atom as a bridge.

Triflates have also been applied as ligands for group 11 and 13 metals along with lanthanides.

Lithium triflates are used in some lithium ion batteries as a component of the electrolyte.

A mild triflating reagent is phenyl triflimide or &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)aniline, where the by-product is [CF3SO2N−Ph]−.

==Triflate salts==
Triflate salts are thermally very stable with melting points up to 350 °C for sodium, boron and silver salts especially in water-free form. They can be obtained directly from triflic acid and the metal hydroxide or metal carbonate in water. Alternatively, they can be obtained from reacting metal chlorides with neat triflic acid or silver triflate, or from reacting barium triflate with metal sulfates in water:
:

Metal triflates are used as Lewis acid catalysts in organic chemistry. Especially useful are the lanthanide triflates of the type (where Ln is a lanthanoid). A related popular catalyst scandium triflate is used in such reactions as aldol reactions and Diels–Alder reactions. An example is the Mukaiyama aldol addition reaction between benzaldehyde and the silyl enol ether of cyclohexanone with an 81% chemical yield. The corresponding reaction with the yttrium salt fails:

Triflate is a commonly used weakly coordinating anion.

<text>Tony Miller (born June 28, 1948) is an American attorney and former California Secretary of State. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as Chief Deputy Secretary of State from 1981 to 1994 and then California Secretary of State from 1994 to 1995. Miller was a longtime public servant, Eagle Scout, and volunteer firefighter.

==Biography==
Miller was raised in the small town of Chester, California. He was elected student body president at his high school. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of California, Davis in 1970 and in 1973 received his J.D. degree from the University of California (Boalt Hall) School of Law at Berkeley. Miller has also worked as a legislative aide, criminal investigator, and college instructor.

Miller served as chairman of the Plumas County Democratic Central Committee during law school, and subsequently as an appointed member of the state&#x27;s newly created Fair Political Practices Commission (1975–76). Before becoming chief deputy to former Secretary of State March Fong Eu, Miller served as the Secretary of State&#x27;s chief legal counsel (1976–81). In 1994, March Fong Eu resigned to become United States Ambassador to the Federated States of Micronesia, leaving Miller as Acting Secretary of State. As Chief Deputy Secretary of State, Miller built a solid reputation for smooth, efficient and fairly run statewide elections, and for the administration of one of the best-run agencies in state government. He ran for election to the post, winning the Democratic primary over Los Angeles Assemblywoman Gwen Moore and former Los Angeles City Councilman (1985-1993) and 1993 mayoral election runner-up Mike Woo, but lost in a very close general election to Bill Jones.

In 1998, Miller ran in the Democratic primary for Lieutenant Governor of California, but lost the nomination to the Assembly Speaker, Cruz Bustamante. Miller then returned to private practice.

After the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) was passed by Congress in 2002, Miller was appointed by California Secretary of State Kevin Shelley to lead the implementation of HAVA in California. In 2004, Miller served as special counsel to Shelley when Shelley was accused of misappropriating federal HAVA funds for his own purposes. Shelley eventually resigned in 2005.

Miller is a lifelong Californian, an avid runner, avid farmer, and craftsman. He is openly gay and has been in a relationship since 1973. He and his husband live on a small farm in Sutter County, near Sacramento.

<text>Machairodontinae (from Ancient Greek μάχαιρα &quot;machaira,&quot; a type of Ancient Greek sword and ὀδόντος &quot;odontos&quot; meaning tooth) is an extinct subfamily of carnivoran mammals of the family Felidae (true cats), representing the earliest diverging major branch of the family.

Machairodonts varied in size from comparable to lynxes to exceeding that of lions. The Machairodontinae contain many of the extinct predators commonly known as &quot;saber-toothed cats&quot;, including those with greatly elongated upper maxillary canines, such as the famed genus &quot;Smilodon&quot; and &quot;Megantereon,&quot; though the degree of elongation was variable, and in some machairodontines like &quot;Dinofelis&quot; the length of the upper canines was much more modest. Sometimes, other carnivorous mammals with elongated teeth are also called saber-toothed cats, although they do not belong to the felids. Besides the machairodonts, other saber-toothed predators also arose in the nimravids, barbourofelids, machaeroidines, hyaenodonts and even in two groups of metatherians (the thylacosmilid sparassodonts and the deltatheroideans). Unlike living big cats, which generally clamp the muzzle of prey to asphyxiate them, saber-toothed machairodontines are thought to have killed prey using a bite to the neck once immobilised, using their neck muscles to drive the saber teeth into the throat while the lower jaw served as an anchor, causing rapid death via blood loss.

Likely originating in Eurasia during the Middle Miocene, they eventually spread to every continent except Australia and Antarctica. Machairodonts were the dominant group of cats and large mammalian predators across Afro-Eurasia and North America during the late Miocene and Early Pliocene, a time when the ancestors of living cats (Felinae &quot;sensu lato&quot;) were mostly small sized. Machairodonts began to decline during the Pleistocene, perhaps as a result of environmental change and consequential changes in prey abundance, competition with large living cat lineages such as the pantherins as well as possibly archaic humans. The last species belonging to the genera &quot;Smilodon&quot; and &quot;Homotherium&quot; became extinct along with many other large mammals around 12-10,000 years ago as part of the end-Pleistocene extinction event, following human arrival to the Americas at the end of the Late Pleistocene.

==Evolution==
===Family Felidae===
Based on mitochondrial DNA sequences extracted from fossils, machairodontines diverged from the ancestors of living cats around 20 million years ago, with the last surviving machairodont genera &quot;Homotherium&quot; and &quot;Smilodon&quot; estimated to have diverged from each other about 18 million years ago.

The Machairodontinae originated in the middle Miocene of Europe. The early felid &quot;Pseudaelurus quadridentatus&quot; showed a trend towards elongated upper canines, and is believed to be at the base of the machairodontine evolution. The earliest known machairodont genus is the middle Miocene &quot;Miomachairodus&quot; from Africa and Turkey. Until the late Miocene, machairodontines co-existed at several places together with barbourofelids, archaic large carnivores that also bore long sabre-teeth.

Traditionally, three different tribes of machairodontines were recognized, the Smilodontini with typical dirk-toothed forms, such as &quot;Megantereon&quot; and &quot;Smilodon&quot;, the Machairodontini or Homotherini with scimitar-toothed cats, such as &quot;Machairodus&quot; or &quot;Homotherium&quot;, and the Metailurini, containing genera such as &quot;Dinofelis&quot; and &quot;Metailurus&quot;. However, some in the past have regrouped the Metailurini within the other felid subfamily, the Felinae, along with all modern cats. A 2022 phylogenetic study suggests a polyphyletic relationship between Metailurini and Smilodontini, with the genus &quot;Paramachairodus&quot; being ancestral to both groups.

The name &#x27;saber-toothed tigers&#x27; is misleading. Machairodonts were not in the same subfamily as tigers, there is no evidence that they had tiger-like coat patterns, and this broad group of animals did not all live or hunt in the same manner as the modern tiger. DNA analysis published in 2005 confirmed and clarified cladistic analysis in showing that the Machairodontinae diverged early from the ancestors of modern cats and are not closely related to any living feline species.

===Evolutionary history and origin of phenotype===
Until the recent discovery of the Late Miocene fossil depository known as Batallones-1 in the 1990s, specimens of Smilodontini and Homotheriini ancestors were rare and fragmentary, so the evolutionary history of the saber-toothed phenotype, a phenotype affecting craniomandibular, cervical forelimb and forelimb anatomy, was largely unknown. Prior to the excavation of Batallones-1, the predominating hypothesis was that the highly derived saber-toothed phenotype arose rapidly through pleiotropic evolution. Batollnes-1 unearthed new specimens of &quot;Promegantereon ogygia&quot;, a Smilodontini ancestor, and &quot;Machairodus aphanistus&quot;, a Homotheriini ancestor, shedding light on evolutionary history. (Though the Smilodontini ancestor was originally assigned to the genus &quot;Paramachairodus&quot;, it was later revised to the genus &quot;Promegantereon&quot;). The leopard-sized &quot;P. ogygia&quot; (living 9.0 Ma) inhabited Spain (and perhaps additional territory). 

The current hypothesis for the evolution of the saber-toothed phenotype, made possible by Batollnes-1, is that this phenotype arose gradually over time through mosaic evolution. Although the exact cause is uncertain, current findings have supported the hypothesis that a need for the rapid killing of prey was the principal pressure driving the development of the phenotype over evolutionary time. As indicated by high instances of broken teeth, the biotic environment of saber-toothed cats was one marked by intense competition.

Broken teeth indicate the frequency at which teeth contact bone. Increased teeth-bone contact suggests either increased consumption of carcasses, rapid consumption of prey, or increased aggression over kills – all three of which point to decreased prey availability, heightening competition between predators. Such a competitive environment would favor the faster killing of prey, because if prey is taken away before consumption (such as by out-competing) the energetic cost of capturing that prey is not reimbursed, and, if this occurs often enough in the lifetime of a predator, death by exhaustion or starvation would result. The earliest adaptations improving the speed at which prey was killed are present in the skull and mandible of &quot;P. ogygia&quot; and of &quot;M. aphanistus&quot;, and in the cervical vertebrae and forelimb of &quot;P. ogygia&quot;. They provide further morphological evidence for the importance of speed in the evolution of the saber-toothed phenotype.

Machariodont diversity declined during the Pleistocene, by the Late Pleistocene, only two genera of machairodonts remained, &quot;Smilodon&quot;, and the distantly related &quot;Homotherium&quot;, both largely confined to the Americas. These two genera became extinct around 13,000-10,000 years ago as part of the wave of extinctions of most large animals across the Americas.

==Fossil remains==
===Skull===
The most studied section of the machairodont group is the skull, and specifically the teeth. With a large range of genera, good fossil representation, comparable modern relatives, diversity within the group, and a good understanding of the ecosystems inhabited, the machairodont subfamily provides one of the best means of research for the analysis of hypercarnivores, specialization, and the relationships between predator and prey.

Machairodonts are divided into two types: dirk-toothed and scimitar-toothed. Dirk-toothed cats had elongated, narrow upper canines and generally had stocky bodies. Scimitar-toothed cats had broader and shorter upper canines and a typically lithe body form with longer legs. The longer-toothed cats often had a bony flange that extended from their lower mandible. However, one genus, &quot;Xenosmilus&quot;, known only from two fairly complete fossils, broke this mould; possessing both the stout, heavy limbs associated with dirk-toothed cats, and the stout canines of a scimitar-toothed cat.

Carnivores reduced the number of their teeth as they specialized in eating meat instead of grinding plant or insect matter. Cats have the fewest teeth of any carnivore group, and machairodonts reduce the number even further. Most machairodonts retain six incisors, two canines, and six premolars in each jaw, with two molars in the upper jaw only. Some genera, such as &quot;Smilodon&quot;, bear only eight premolars with one fewer on the mandible, leaving only four large premolars on the mandible along with two stunted canines and six stout incisors. The canines are curved back smoothly, and serrations are present, but are minor and wear away with age, leaving most middle-aged machairodonts (at about four or five) with no serrations. Hints in the bones such as these help paleontologists to estimate the age of an individual for population studies of an animal long extinct.

Longer canines necessitate a larger gape. A lion with a gape of 95° could not bear canines that are nine inches long because they would not be able to have a gap between the lower and upper canines larger than an inch or so, not enough to use for killing. Machairodonts, along with the other groups of animals that acquired similar teeth by convergent evolution, needed a way to change their skulls to accommodate the canines in several ways.


The main inhibitors of a large gape for mammals are the temporalis and masseter muscles at the back of the jaw. These muscles have the capacity to be powerful and undergo a great degree of modification for ranging bite forces, but are not very elastic due to their thickness, placement, and strength. To open the mouth wider, these species needed to make the muscles smaller and change their shape. The first step in this was to reduce the coronoid process. The masseter, and especially the temporalis, muscles insert on this jutting strip of bone, so reduction of this process meant the reduction of the muscles. Less mass for each muscle allowed greater elasticity and less resistance to a wide gape. Changing the shape of the temporalis muscle in this respect created a greater distance between the origin and insertion, so that the muscle became longer and more compact, which is generally a more suitable format for this type of stretching. This reduction led to a weaker bite.

The skulls of machairodonts suggests another change in the shape of the temporalis muscle. The main constraint to opening the jaws is that the temporalis muscle will tear if it is stretched past a critical degree around the glenoid process when the mouth is opened. In modern felids, the occipital bone extends backward, but the temporalis muscles that attach to this surface are strained when opening the jaw wide as the muscle is wrapped around the glenoid process. To reduce the stretch of the temporalis muscle around the immovable process, machairodonts evolved a skull with a more vertical occipital bone. The domestic cat has a gape of 80°, while a lion has a gape of 91°. In &quot;Smilodon&quot;, the gape is 128°, and the angle between the ramus of the mandible and the occipital bone is 100°. This angle is the major limiting factor of the gape, and reducing the angle of the occipital bone relative to the palate of the mouth, as seen in &quot;Smilodon&quot;, allowed the gape to increase further. Had the occipital bone not been stretched towards the palate, and closer to perpendicular, the gape would theoretically be less, at roughly 113°.

The skulls of many sabre-tooth predators, including machairodonts, are tall from top to bottom and short from front to back. The zygomatic arches are compressed, and the portion of the skull bearing facial features, such as eyes, is higher, while the muzzle is shorter. These changes help to compensate for an increased gape. Machairodonts also had reduced bottom canines, maintaining the distance between those in the upper and lower jaws.



===Post-cranial skeleton===
The dirk-toothed machairodonts, including &quot;Smilodon&quot;, &quot;Megantereon&quot;, and &quot;Paramachairodus&quot;, are defined by sturdiness and strength with the most primitive (&quot;Paramachairodus&quot;) being smaller and more lithe than the more advanced &quot;Smilodon&quot;; the intermediate &quot;Megantereon&quot; falls in between. They were not stamina runners with short tarsi and metatarsi and heavy bodies. When compared with the modern lion, their ribcages were barrel-like with narrow anterior ends and expanded posterior ends. Their scapulae were very well developed, especially in &quot;Smilodon&quot;, to allow for a larger surface area of attachment for massive shoulder and triceps muscles. The cervical vertebrae are very sturdy, and the attachments for muscles were powerful and strong. The lumbar section of the vertebral column was shortened. The tails were, from most primitive to most advanced, growing shorter and shorter, resulting in the bobcat-like tail of &quot;Smilodon&quot;. When viewing only postcranial remains, they are more similar in structure to modern bears than to modern cats.

The scimitar-toothed machairodonts (Machairodontini, Homotherini and Metailurini) are a much more diverse group. The canines of this larger group are significantly shorter and generally stouter, but still much longer than in any modern cat. Because of the diversity of the genera, it is difficult to illustrate a specific type. The Machairodontini were the first among the machairodontines and the felids overall to attain near-lion size and already showed impressive upper canines early on in their evolution in the Miocene, but apart from these retained a relatively cat-like morphology that was more similar to modern pantherines than more derived machairodontines from later periods. &quot;Machairodus&quot; appears to have been an excellent jumper. The homotherines were overall more specialized and already the earliest taxa like &quot;Lokotunjailurus&quot; were remarkably long-legged and lean, though as large as a modern lion, a trend that further magnified in the Pliocene-Pleistocene genus &quot;Homotherium,&quot; which was once thought to be plantigrade, but was proven to be digitigrade. &quot;Homotherium serum&quot;, the most derived known species from the Pleistocene of North America bore a sloped back that might have made it excellent at running long distances, similar to the living spotted hyena. It also had a well-developed visual cortex, a large nasal cavity that would have allowed for better oxygen intake and smaller, only partially retractable claws that might have functioned like spikes for a better grip on the ground, all of which seems to point to a highly active lifestyle and cursoriality. &quot;Xenosmilus&quot; however, a mid-Pleistocene homotherine from Florida and close relative of &quot;Homotherium&quot;, broke this trend in that it had both scimitar-like teeth and a bulky and strong build that is more typical for dirk-tooths.

The third scimitar-toothed tribe, the Metailurini, bore overall similarity to modern cats, but were highly diverse in terms of morphology with species ranging from a small cheetah to a small lion in size. Some had comparatively short, almost conical upper canines similar to modern cats, while some species bore strongly pronounced machairodontine features. However, in contrast to homotherines and smilodontines, even the most derived metailurines retained long tails, long hind legs and a long spine. On average, scimitar-toothed cats had more teeth than the average dirk-toothed machairodont, with six premolars on the mandible. When viewing only postcranial remains of similar-toothed machairodonts, many of their forms were comparatively similar to modern pantherines (genera &quot;Panthera&quot; and &quot;Neofelis&quot;).

===Mummified specimen===
In 2020, the mummified remains of a 3-week-old cub belonging to the species &quot;Homotherium latidens&quot; were found in Yakutia, Russia. They are believed to be the first of its kind to ever be found, with the fur&#x27;s color and softness surprising scientists.

==Derived anatomy and diet==
===Bite strength===
The jaws of machairodonts, especially more derived species with longer canines, such as &quot;Smilodon&quot; and &quot;Megantereon&quot;, are unusually weak. Digital reconstructions of the skulls of lions and of &quot;Smilodon&quot; show that the latter would have fared poorly with the stresses of holding onto struggling prey. The main issue was the stresses suffered by the mandible: a strong force threatened to break the jaw as pressure was placed on its weakest points.

&quot;Smilodon&quot; would have had one-third the bite force of a lion, had it used only its jaw muscles. However, the neck muscles that connected to the back of the skull were stronger and depressed the head, forcing the skull down. When the jaw was hyper-extended, the jaw muscles could not contract, but the neck muscles pressed the head down, forcing the canines into whatever resisted them. When the mouth was closed far enough, the jaw muscles could raise the mandible by some margin.

===Diet===
On occasion, the bone of a fossilised predator is preserved well enough to retain recognizable proteins that belong to the species it consumed when alive. Stable isotope analysis of these proteins has shown that &quot;Smilodon&quot; preyed mainly on bison and horses, and occasionally ground sloths and mammoths, while &quot;Homotherium&quot; often preyed on young mammoths and other grazers such as pronghorn antelope and bighorn sheep when mammoths were not available. Examinations published in 2022 of tooth wear patterns on &quot;Smilodon&quot; and bite marks on the bones of the peccary &quot;Platygonus&quot; by &quot;Xenosmilus&quot; suggest that machairodonts were capable of efficiently stripping and de-fleshing a carcass of meat when feeding. They also show a degree of bone consumption on par with that of modern lions, which themselves can and regularly do eat smaller bones when consuming a meal.

===The face===
American paleontologist George Miller set forth a set of features not previously thought of in the soft tissues of machairodonts, specifically &quot;Smilodon&quot;.

The first change he suggested in the appearance of machairodonts was lower ears, or rather the illusion of lower ears due to the higher sagittal crest. However, the positioning of the ears is always similar in modern felids, even in individuals that have crests comparable in size to those of sabretooth cats. The positioning of the pinnae, or outer ears, along with fur color, are dependent on the individual doing the reconstruction. Large or small, pointed or rounded, high or low, fossils do not record these characteristics, leaving them open to interpretation.

Miller also suggested a pug-like nose. Aside from the pug and similar dogs, no modern carnivore exhibits a pug nose due to it being an unnaturally created trait originating from selective breeding. The relatively low distribution of the pug nose has resulted in it being generally ignored. Miller&#x27;s rationale is based on the retraction of &quot;Smilodon&quot; nasal bones. Criticism of Miller&#x27;s theory compares the nasal bones of lions and tigers. Lions, when compared to tigers, also have strongly retracted nasal bones, but a lion&#x27;s rhinarium, or external nose, is no more retracted than the tiger&#x27;s. Thus, the pug nose of &quot;Smilodon&quot; proposed by Miller has little evidence in the physical structures of comparable animals. According to Antón, García-Perea and Turner (1998), the nostrils of living felids always extend to a similar position, independently of the length of the nasal bones, which in &quot;Smilodon&quot; falls within the range observed in modern species.

The third idea proposed is the elongation of the lips by 50%. While his other hypotheses have been largely discarded, the last is used significantly in modern depictions. Miller argues that longer lips allows the greater elasticity needed for biting prey with a wider gape. Although this argument has been disputed within the scientific community, it remains supported nevertheless by artists. Scientific criticism points out that the lips of modern cats, especially larger species, display incredible elasticity and the usual lip length would stretch suitably, despite the larger degree of opening, and that in living carnivores the lip line is always anterior to the masseter muscle, which in &quot;Smilodon&quot; was located just behind the carnassials. Regardless, reconstructions of &quot;Smilodon&quot;, &quot;Machairodus&quot;, and other species are shown with long lips, often resembling the jowls of large dogs.

Studies of &quot;Homotherium&quot; and &quot;Smilodon&quot; suggest that scimitar-toothed machairodonts like &quot;Homotherium&quot; itself possessed upper lips and gum tissue that could effectively hide and protect their upper canines; a trait they shared in common with modern cat species, while &quot;Smilodon&quot; had canines that remained partially exposed and protruded past the lips and chin even while the mouth was closed due to their great length.

===Vocalizations===
Comparisons of the hyoid bones of &quot;Smilodon&quot; and lions show that the former, and possibly other machairodonts, could potentially have roared like their modern relatives. A 2023 study suggested that while machairodonts had the same number of hyoid bones as &quot;roaring&quot; cats, their shape was closer to that of &quot;purring&quot; cats. 

==Social behavior==
===&quot;Smilodon&quot;===

A 2009 study compared the ratios of social and solitary carnivores in reserves in South Africa and Tanzania with those of fossils of California&#x27;s La Brea tar pits, a well-known fossil bed from the Pleistocene, and how they responded to recorded sounds of dying prey, to infer whether &quot;Smilodon&quot; was social or not. At one time, the La Brea tar pits consisted of deep tar in which animals became trapped. As they died, their calls attracted predators, which in turn also became caught. It is considered the best Pleistocene fossil bed in North America for the number of animals caught and preserved in the tar, and may be similar to the situation created in the study. The assumption was that solitary carnivores would not approach the sources of such sounds, because of the danger of confrontation with other predators. Social carnivores, such as lions, have few other predators to fear, and will readily attend these calls. The study concluded that this latter situation most closely fit the ratio of animals found at the La Brea tar pits, and therefore that &quot;Smilodon&quot; was most likely social.

===&quot;Homotherium&quot;===

At Friesenhahn Cave, Texas, the remains of almost 400 juvenile mammoths were discovered along with skeletons of &quot;Homotherium&quot;. &quot;Homotherium&quot; groups have been suggested to have specialized in hunting young mammoths, and to have dragged the kills into secluded caves to eat inside, out from the open. They also retained excellent nocturnal vision, and hunting at night in the arctic regions would probably have been their prime hunting method.

The modern lion is capable of, in large numbers, killing weakened adult and healthy subadult elephants, so similar sized &quot;Homotherium&quot; likely could have managed the same feat with juvenile mammoths. This is supported by isotopic analysis. But the idea that a cat, even one of very large size and possibly social, was able to cooperatively &#x27;drag&#x27; a mammoth calf any real distance into a cave without damaging its teeth has aroused great criticism. Its sloped back and powerful lumbar section of its vertebrae suggested a bear-like build, so it might have been capable of pulling weights, but breaking canines, a fate suffered by &quot;Machairodus&quot; and &quot;Smilodon&quot; with some frequency, is not seen in &quot;Homotherium&quot;. Moreover, the bones of these young mammoths show the distinctive marks of &quot;Homotherium&quot; incisors, indicating they could efficiently process most of the meat on a carcass, indicating it was they and not scavengers who dragged the carcasses into the caves. Examination of the bones also indicates that the carcasses of these mammoths were dismembered by the cats before being dragged away, indicating that &quot;Homotherium&quot; would disarticulate their kill to transport it to a safe area and prevent scavengers from claiming a hard-won meal. Evidence also shows the cats were able to effectively strip flesh from bone in a manner that left noticeable score marks.

===Paleopathology===
&quot;Machairodus&quot; is another genus with few fossil records to suggest a social nature, but canines on these species are broken more often than others and show signs of extensive healing afterward. A male &quot;Amphimachairodus giganteus&quot; from China housed by the Babiarz Institute of Paleontological Studies is an older individual with a broken canine, worn from usage after the break. However, the individual died of a severe nasal infection, an injury that a social predator would have had a better chance of healing, so the skull can be interpreted in different ways. The adult canine teeth of juvenile &quot;Machairodus&quot; took an exceptionally long time to erupt and be used, so until then, it was completely dependent on the care of its parents.

In another example of paleopathology supporting the social hypothesis, a large number of &quot;Smilodon&quot; fossils from the La Brea tar pits feature hunting injuries. In addition to injuries resulting from strain while hunting, the more severe injuries strongly suggest a social nature. Animals may have been crippled long after the injury healed, suffering swollen ankles, prominent limps, and limited mobility that persisted for years. One such case displays a subadult suffering a shattered pelvis that healed. The specimen would barely have been able to use the damaged limb and would have limped slowly, favoring the other three legs, completely unable to hunt on its own. If a solitary predator would have been able to survive such a severe injury, it would have been a very rare occasion. It is far more likely that such an animal would have been unable to move from a single spot on the ground for several months and might have only survived by being brought food or dragging itself towards kills made by relatives.

===Rebuttals to the social hypothesis===
The question of sociality is still controversial. Strong support for the traditional concept of a solitary &quot;Smilodon&quot; is found in its brain. Most social predators, including humans, grey wolves, and lions, have brains that are slightly larger than those of their loner relatives. &quot;Smilodon&quot; had a relatively small brain, suggesting less ability for complex cooperative behaviors, such as hunting in groups.

The broken bones still seem to support sociality, however, the best explanation for a solitary animal healing from serious wounds is that cats build up metabolic reserves that can be used in times of need. The cheetah is often viewed as a poor example because it is a specialized species with a more fragile physique than other cats. Larger, more sturdily built cat species, such as lions and leopards, have been observed to recover from severe injuries, such as broken jaws and torn muscles.

==Functionality of the sabers==
===Stabbing===
It has been suggested that machairodonts used their saber teeth during hunting, grappling an animal, opening its mouth, and swinging its head down with enough force to puncture the animal&#x27;s skin and flesh. It was once suggested that the saber teeth were used much like a knife. The canines seemed, initially, as tools of great power and devastating ability, used for crushing vertebrae, or for tearing open armored animals such as glyptodonts.

However, teeth are made of unsupported enamel, and would have been easily broken against hard material such as bone. It has also been argued that the mandible and an inability to open the mouth very wide would have been an impediment to effective stabbing. For such reasons, this concept has been rejected by the scientific community.

===Sexual characteristic===
Long canines could also have been the product of sexual selection, much like the mane of a lion, and were used for courting, sexual display, and social status. Their canines are already well established as relatively fragile, and their jaw muscles not strong, so any predatory function is uncertain.

However, when a trait is adopted to enhance sexual attraction, typically only one sex, usually males, display the feature. In all machairodont species, both males and females have these canines and, with only minor exceptions as in &quot;Machairodus&quot;, are shaped similarly. There is typically also a size difference between sexes, but male and female machairodonts appear to have been the same sizes. Also, this level of sexual selection seems extreme given an individual would be left severely impaired in eating and general function.

===Scavenging===
One suggestion is that most machairodonts were scavengers. This leaves the canines not functional for the most part, and is often coupled with the hypothesis of sexual selection. Many modern carnivores scavenge to a greater or lesser degree. A strong sense of smell and good hearing could have helped find carcasses or steal the kills of other predators, such as dire wolves or short-faced bears, and sprinting would not have been needed, as is seen in the stocky conformation of most machairodonts.

Many modern cats show this mixture of traits. Lions are able-bodied hunters, but will steal when they are given the opportunity. Tigers and cougars bury their kills and return later to keep eating, even days later. All cats prefer killing the sick or injured, and there is a fine line between an animal so sick it cannot move and a dead animal. The abundance of &quot;Smilodon&quot; skeletons in the La Brea tar pits in California supports the hypothesis, as well. The animals caught in the pits would have been dying or dead, the kind of meal a true hypercarnivore, such as a modern cheetah, would pass up. This hypothesis is the oldest, but still considered viable.

Opposition to this concept lies in many parts of the cat. The teeth are purely carnivorous, unable to grind plant material, as the omnivorous teeth of dogs and bears do. The carnassials are shaped to efficiently slice flesh, not crunch bone, as they are in the modern spotted hyena. Since both sexes bear these canines and additional modifications to the skull are present, machairodonts were likely opportunists to some degree.

===The neck-biting hypotheses===

A more common and widely accepted view of machairodont hunting is the throat-shearing bite. Modern cats use a throat clamp, a bite positioned around the upper section of the throat, to suffocate the prey by compressing the windpipe. Their canines serve to puncture the skin and mostly allow a better grip, and do not do any significant damage to the prey. Machairodonts, alternatively, would have caused damage if they used the same technique as their modern relatives.

The major drawback to these methods is that the large amount of blood spilled could be smelled by other nearby carnivores, such as other machairodonts or dire wolves. Predators often form competitive relationships in which dominance can shift from one species to the other, as seen in the modern lion and spotted hyena of Africa. In such situations, squabbles are not uncommon. The balance of power and dominance between these apex predators remains a mystery because of the social factor. Strength in numbers can be significant in these struggles. For example, dire wolves are thought to have traveled in small packs, and while individually subordinate, their numbers might have been sufficient to force a machairodont off a kill.

However, the cat might have been able to scavenge on kills made by dire wolves. Two solitary machairodonts would quickly develop a pecking order with the first individual dominant. Because of this uncertainty, a large part of the niche of machairodonts is still unknown. The several variations on this hypothesis all require a subdued and still animal.

====General &quot;bite and retreat&quot;====
The first hypothesis involving the sensitive neck is that the cat simply restrained the animal and then bit the neck, without much specificity to location, to cause major blood damage and then retreated to allow the animal to bleed to death. Stipulations include not biting the back of the neck where contact with vertebrae could break the teeth, but a deep bite anywhere in the neck would prove fatal.

This general bite would be used wherever it could be attained, and needs fewer predators. When compared with the belly-shearing hypothesis, one &quot;Megantereon&quot; could kill a large deer, and possibly a horse, with little danger of breaking canines. This is because the bite can be applied while the carnivore keeps its body behind the prey for the most part, avoiding flinging legs while still pressing with its body weight to keep it still. It would have been a quick bite, suiting the ambush style of stalking and hunting implied by the heavy and strong bodies of most machairodonts. It would also have been possible for a lone machairodont to wound a large prey animal in this manner, then release and follow it until it fell from shock.

The general bite-and-retreat hypothesis has been criticised because of its bloodiness and because the struggling prey would have attracted any predators and scavengers in the area. The idea that a single animal would wound, release, and follow a prey animal has been counteracted more strongly. Cats rarely walk away from prey until they have eaten their fill and it would have risked being stolen by other predators.

Xenosmilus in particular might have used this method, as all the teeth in its mouth were serrated and aligned in a way that formed a consistent cutting surface.
====&quot;Bite and compress&quot;====
When the animal is wounded with a bite from a machairodont (ignoring the placement of the blood vessels, which are negligible in this hypothesis), the canines would have been inserted behind the windpipe and the premolars would have been encompassing the windpipe. This variation states that the machairodont compressed the windpipe after dealing the bite, serving to both suffocate and wound the prey animal. Puncturing large blood vessels in the throat and causing massive bleeding would hasten the death of the animal.

Modern cats, and presumably the basal genera of all cats, such as &quot;Pseudaelurus&quot; and &quot;Proailurus&quot;, use the throat clamp as a common method of dispatching prey. The suffocation would inhibit sound from the panicked prey, a method used by modern cheetahs and leopards. The wound from the canines and the lack of air would then kill the prey animal.

This method might inhibit the full effect of the wound created by the canines. Keeping the canines in the wound would stifle the blood flow from the body and could keep the animal alive longer even if the prey is unable to vocalize. There is no significant advantage to the longer canines in this method of killing when compared to the ancestral cats with their short, conical-shaped canines. If anything, the dangers to breaking teeth held in the throat of a panicked animal, even if well restrained, outweighs the possible benefits, so this method has often been viewed as improbable.

====Careful &quot;shearing bite&quot;====
Another variation suggests the advanced machairodonts were highly specialized, enough to obtain the specific geometry to puncture the four major blood vessels in the throat of a prey animal in one bite. This hypothesis would include a careful bite to puncture the blood vessels, similar to, but more precise than, the bite-and-compress hypothesis, whereupon the machairodont would retreat and allow the animal to bleed to death very quickly.

Though bloody, this method would take the shortest amount of time to kill the animal out of all the hypotheses. Because of the differences of anatomy between species possibly hunted by machairodonts, the geometry needed to kill a horse, for instance, might not work for a bison. This would require the genus, or even the specific species, to be highly specialized for one type of prey animal. This might offer an explanation for their extinction, for the movement or extinction of that prey species would lead to the death of its specialist predator.

The high specialization seems an extreme and unnecessary version of a bite-and-retreat version of the throat-shear, but the suggestion that machairodont species became more specialized to hunt one prey species is usually considered acceptable so long as the misconception that the machairodont hunted &#x27;only&#x27; that species is taken. However, this would not resolve the issue of the messiness and the loud sounds probably associated with this kind of bite. More than one individual would probably have been needed to ensure a completely subdued animal.

===&quot;Belly shearing&quot;===
In 1985, American paleontologist William Akersten suggested the shearing bite. This method of killing is similar to the style of killing seen in hyenas and canines today. A group of machairodonts captured and completely subdued a prey item, holding it still while one from the group bit into the abdominal cavity, pulled back and tore open the body.

For this technique to work, a specific sequence of motions would have to be followed. First, the animal must be completely subdued, and the predatory machairodonts must be social, so that several individuals can hold the prey animal down. The individual preparing to deliver the killing bite would open its mouth at maximum gape, and with its mandible, press up on the skin of the belly. Creating a depression where the lower canines and incisors press into the skin, a slight fold is created in the skin above the lower teeth as the mandible is shoved upward. Next, the upper canines are pressed into the skin and the muscles of the neck are used to depress the head, so instead of pulling the jaw &#x27;up&#x27;, the skull is pressed &#x27;down&#x27; . When the canines pierce the skin, they are lowered until the gape of the mouth is roughly 45°, where the mandible is pulled up in addition to the skull still being depressed. The small flanges on the anterior portion of the mandible of most machairodonts would be used to aid the depression of the skull. When the animal&#x27;s mouth is closed, it holds a thick flap of skin between its jaws, behind its canines, and the animal uses the muscles of its lower back and forequarters to pull back, tearing the flap clear of the body. This large gash, once opened, leaves intestines uncovered and arteries and veins torn. The bleeding animal would die within minutes, and the shock of repeated bites, tearing innards from the body, could speed up the process.

This method allows social machairodonts to inflict large wounds on prey animals. Massive blood loss would ensue, and though bloody, the social group would be able to fend off almost any animal attracted to the area. The bite would not need to be specific, and could be repeated to hasten the death of the animal, and it is already seen in the killing methods of several extant species, such as the spotted hyena. Canines are not as likely to be broken due to the softer nature of the abdomen when compared to the throat and jerking movements are not as amplified in the abdomen as they are in the neck. The abdominal-tearing hypothesis has generally been regarded as highly plausible. In the La Brea tar pits, occurrences of broken canines in &quot;Smilodon&quot; are rare, and this less risky method might have contributed to this.

However, a shearing bite may have been problematic for machairodonts for several reasons. Most ungulates are highly sensitive around the belly and hindquarters, and most predators find it much easier to capture and subdue an animal similar to the domestic cow, by manipulating the head and forequarters. By lowering the animal to the ground and placing itself between the pairs of legs, a machairodont would have suffered great risk of being kicked. The power behind such a kick would easily break teeth, a mandible, or a leg, and cripple or kill the cat.

Sociability might have solved this issue by having one individual deliver the killing bite while others held the animal still. Furthermore, the diameter of the abdomen of a large ungulate such as a bison might have been too large, and the skin too taut, for a machairodont to grasp a flap of skin at all, much less tear it away from the body. A third issue with the shearing bite is that the canines would need to tear a large hole in the belly of the animal to be successful, but might instead simply flay the skin and produce two long slits. This wound may be painful and bleed, but the animal likely would not bleed to death and could still escape and survive, instead of bleeding to death.

In 2004 an experiment used a pair of mechanical aluminum jaws, cast from the CT scans of a &quot;Smilodon fatalis&quot; from the La Brea tar pits, to simulate several biting techniques possibly used by &quot;Smilodon&quot;, including the shearing bite, on a fresh domestic cow carcass. The belly of the cow was found to be too large in diameter for the canines to puncture the skin, which were instead deflected off the body, with the mandible blocking their access. However, the model pulled its jaw upward as modern cats bite, while machairodonts most likely did not, instead pressing their skulls down with the aid of their neck muscles. This flaw in the procedure might nullify the results and leave the belly-shearing hypothesis untouched.

<text>The SCC68070 is a Philips Semiconductors-branded, Motorola 68000-based 16/32-bit processor produced under license. While marketed externally as a high-performance microcontroller, it has been almost exclusively used combined with the Philips SCC66470 VSC (Video- and Systems Controller) in the Philips CD-i interactive entertainment product line.

Additions to the Motorola 68000 core include:

* Operation from 4 to 17.5 MHz
* Inclusion of a minimal, segmented MMU supporting up to 16 MB of memory
* Built-in DMA controller
* I²C bus controller 
* UART
* 16-bit counter/timer unit
* 2 match/count/capture registers allowing the implementation of a pulse generator, event counter or reference timer
* Clock generator

Differences from the Motorola 68000 core include these:

* Instruction execution timing is completely different
* Interrupt handling has been simplified
* The SCC68070 has MC68010 style bus-error recovery. They are not compatible, so exception error processing is different.
* The SCC68070 lacks a dedicated address generation unit (AGU), so operations requiring address calculation run slower due to contention with the shared ALU. This means that most instructions take more cycles to execute, for some instructions significantly more, than a 68000.
* The MMU is not compatible with the Motorola 68451 or any other &quot;standard&quot; Motorola MMU, so operating system code dealing with memory protection and address translation is not generally portable. Enabling the MMU also costs a wait state on each memory access.

While the SCC68070 is mostly binary compatible with the Motorola 68000, there is no equivalent chip in the Motorola 680x0 series. In particular, the SCC68070 is not a follow-on to the Motorola 68060.

Even though the SCC68070 is a 32-bit processor internally, it has a 24-bit address bus, giving it a theoretical 16MB maximum RAM. However, this is not possible, as all of the on-board peripherals are mapped internally.

<text>Harry John Laurent, VC (15 April 1895 – 9 December 1987) was a New Zealand recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Tarata, Laurent was a grocer&#x27;s assistant when he volunteered in May 1915 to serve in the First World War with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF). He was posted to the 2nd Battalion of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade and from 1916 served on the Western Front. It was on 12 September 1918, during an engagement that followed the Second Battle of Bapaume, that he performed the actions that led to him being honoured with the VC. He ended the war as a second lieutenant. Discharged from the NZEF, he returned to civilian life but was recalled to active duty during the Second World War and was involved in the Home Guard. He was the last surviving New Zealand VC recipient of the First World War at the time of his death in 1987.

==Early life==
Henry John Laurent, known as Harry, was born on 15 April 1895 in Tarata, in the Taranaki region of New Zealand. His father, John, and mother, Mary, were farmers. His family was of French descent, his grandfather, a former officer in the French Army, having emigrated to New Zealand in 1852. The family moved to Hāwera while Laurent was still a child. He attended Hawera District High School and after completing his education, he found work as a grocer&#x27;s assistant. He also served with the Territorial Force, having joined at the age of 16.

==First World War==
In May 1915, Laurent enlisted with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF), shortly after his 20th birthday. An attempt to volunteer for the NZEF the previous year had been declined, as he was below the minimum age for service aboard. Posted to the 2nd Battalion of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade (NZRB), Laurent embarked for the Middle East in October 1915. He did not arrive in time to be involved in the Gallipoli Campaign and instead participated in the defence of the Suez Canal.

===Western Front===
In March 1916, the Rifle Brigade was designated part of the newly formed New Zealand Division and the following month it was sent to the Western Front. Laurent participated in the Battle of Flers–Courcelette, part of the Somme Offensive, during which he was wounded. After a period of hospital treatment, he returned to his battalion in April 1917. He received a series of promotions over the next several months, and during this time, his battalion participated in the Battle of Messines as the reserve for the NZRB, the First Battle of Passchendaele, and in defending the British lines near Colincamps during the German spring offensive of late-March 1918. By September 1918 Laurent had advanced in rank to sergeant.

During the Hundred Days Offensive, the New Zealand Division, following the Second Battle of Bapaume, was in pursuit of retreating German forces. Leading a patrol on 12 September in the area east of Gouzeaucourt Wood, France, Laurent was ordered to locate and regain contact with the German front lines. The 12-man patrol inadvertently penetrated through the front line and located a line of artillery. Realising the patrol&#x27;s mistake, Laurent organised a swift attack which resulted in the capture of 112 prisoners, with one member of the patrol being killed and three others wounded. He then extricated his patrol, together with the prisoners, back to the New Zealand line, fighting off counterattacks along the way. For his bravery and leadership, he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest gallantry award that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. His VC was gazetted on 12 November 1918, and the citation read:

Laurent was sent to England in October 1918, where he attended an officer training school. The war had ended by the time he was commissioned in February 1919. He, together with three other New Zealanders who had been awarded the VC, received his medal from King George V in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 27 February 1919. A few months later, he left England for New Zealand and his hometown of Hāwera. On his arrival, the mayor presented him a gold watch and chain, the cost of which was met by public donations. In October 1919, he was part of the welcoming party when fellow VC recipient and Hāwera resident John Grant returned home.

==Later life==
Discharged from the NZEF and placed on the Reserve of Officers, Laurent settled into life in Hāwera and soon found employment at a grocery store. He later worked as a sales representative. He married Ethel Homewood, originally from England, on 20 July 1921, in a ceremony at Hāwera. Fellow VC recipients John Grant and Leslie Andrew were present, the former in the capacity of best man. In 1937, Laurent, along with several other VC recipients, was awarded the coronation medal to commemorate the ascension of King George VI to the British throne.

During the Second World War, Laurent was recalled to the Reserve of Officers of the New Zealand Military Forces. He was soon commanding a battalion in the Home Guard. Later promoted to a temporary lieutenant colonel, he was made group director of the Hāwera Home Guard in early 1942. Late the following year he was appointed commander of the Hāwera squadron of the Air Training Corps and held this post until 1945. He was formally seconded to the Royal New Zealand Air Force for a brief period as a squadron commander of 34th Air Training Squadron before ceasing active duty at the end of the war. He formally retired from the military in 1949.

At the age of 61, Laurent went to London in 1956 as part of the VC centenary celebrations. He attended further VC events in the following years. He died in Hastings on 9 December 1987, the last surviving New Zealand VC recipient of the First World War. His wife had predeceased him the previous year. His ashes are interred in the Memorial Wall at the Servicemen&#x27;s Cemetery at Hāwera, his hometown. A street in the town is also named after him, and nearby is Grant VC Street, named for fellow VC recipient John Grant.

Laurent&#x27;s VC was displayed at the QEII Army Memorial Museum in Waiouru, along with his service medals from the First and Second World Wars and his coronation medals. On 2 December 2007, Laurent&#x27;s VC was one of nine Victoria Crosses that were among a hundred medals stolen from the museum. On 16 February 2008, New Zealand Police announced all the medals had been recovered as a result of a NZ$300,000 reward offered by Michael Ashcroft and Tom Sturgess.

<doc id="1223818" wikidata="Q4762064" url="?curid=1223818" title="Angel (paintball gun)">
<text>The Angel is one of the first electropneumatic paintball markers. It was manufactured by Angel Paintball Sports (originally WDP) starting in 1997 and was introduced alongside Smart Parts&#x27; original Shocker.

The Angel was initially distributed in the United States by Brass Eagle as the &quot;1455 Angel Semi-auto&quot;, advertised with a rate of 15 balls per second. This deal was short-lived, so WDP then distributed the Angel independently; refining the marker and releasing new models.

==History==
The Angel paintball marker was designed by engineer John Rice, as an &quot;HPA-only&quot; marker. Despite its ubiquitous use in the sport at the time, Rice considered CO2 a &quot;dirty gas&quot;, so the Angel used miniaturized components that could not withstand impurities in the air or the cooling effects of CO2. To cater to the sudden need for a high-flow HPA regulator, WDP released the &quot;Gov&#x27;nair high pressure air&quot; system. The marker featured an electronic firing sequence and light trigger for effective shooting, and low learning curve - . The first use of the Angel in a NPPL event was at the 1996 World Cup by Ted Kunewa with Washington Reign and Jacko with Banzai Bandits.

==Operation==
The Angel incorporates a linked bolt and hammer, tri-tubed design, and a four-way solenoid valve; referred to as a &quot;fourteen-way&quot; by Angel engineer Rice. The valve drives the ram and is essentially an electronically controlled version of the four-way valves mounted to the front block of Autococker markers.

The firing sequence is electronically controlled, and starts from the open bolt. At the pull of the trigger, an electronic impulse trips the four-way valve, pushing compressed gas through the ram from behind, forcing the ram and bolt assembly to move towards the valve, impacting the poppet and releasing gas to the chamber. The paintball is fired with this gas, then the four-way solenoid reverses, and delivers gas to the front of the ram, returning the ram and bolt assembly to their starting position.

It was founded in 1971 by songwriting and production duo Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff along with their longtime collaborator Thom Bell. It was known for showcasing the Philadelphia soul music genre (also known as Philly soul) that was founded on the gospel, doo-wop and soul music of the time. This sound later marked a prominent and distinct era within the R&amp;B genre. During the 1970s, the label released a string of worldwide hits that emphasized lavish orchestral instrumentation, heavy bass and driving percussion.

Some of its most popular and best selling acts included the O&#x27;Jays, Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes, Teddy Pendergrass, MFSB, Billy Paul, Patti LaBelle, and Lou Rawls. Between 1971 and the early 1980s, the label released more than 170 gold and platinum records.

Philadelphia International Records had been mostly defunct since 1987 and finally shut down in 2001. As of 2007, Sony Music Entertainment owns all rights to the Philadelphia International Records catalogue.

==Beginning and success==
Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, the founders of Philadelphia International Records, met in 1964 while they were both playing as session musicians for various labels, including Philadelphia based Cameo-Parkway Records, whose building would later become home to Philadelphia International Records&#x27; recording studio. In 1965, Huff joined Gamble&#x27;s band, the Romeos, a popular moniker at the time, by replacing future Philadelphia International Records producer and arranger Thom Bell on piano. Gamble and the Romeos had seen little success playing for their label, Arctic Records, and split up soon after.

When the Romeos disbanded, Gamble and Huff started one of the first iterations of Philadelphia International Records (which they named Excel and Gamble) after a visit to Motown Records in Detroit to scope out the Motown setup. The success of their biggest signing, the Intruders, brought attention to Gamble and Huff allowing them to create Neptune Records in 1969. Neptune Records, a more ambitious project for the duo, was financed by Chess Records; thus they were able to sign later Philadelphia International Records artists the O&#x27;Jays and the Three Degrees. 

When Chess Records changed ownership in 1969, Neptune Records folded. Gamble and Huff transferred their signed artists to a new project, Philadelphia International Records. Looking to attract new black acts to their label, but without the in-house know-how, Columbia Records was convinced to sign an exclusive production contract with Gamble and Huff&#x27;s new Philadelphia International Records. The label was set up in connection with Mighty Three/Assorted Music, the music publishing company which was run by Gamble, Huff, and Thom Bell, a Philadelphia producer, to showcase their songs.

The label&#x27;s major hits included: &quot;TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)&quot; by MFSB, featuring the Three Degrees, 1974 (which was later used as one of the theme tunes for the TV dance-music show &quot;Soul Train&quot;); &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Stoppin&#x27; Us Now&quot; by McFadden &amp; Whitehead (writers and producers with the label), 1979; &quot;Back Stabbers&quot; and &quot;Love Train&quot; by the O&#x27;Jays, 1972/3; &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Know Me By Now&quot; and &quot;The Love I Lost&quot; by Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes, 1972/3; &quot;Me and Mrs. Jones&quot; by Billy Paul, 1972; &quot;When Will I See You Again&quot; by the Three Degrees, 1974; and &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Find Another Love Like Mine&quot; by Lou Rawls, 1976.

The label had a distribution deal with CBS Records until 1984. Distribution of the catalog from 1976 onward was taken over by EMI Records, but CBS continued to distribute material which was recorded up to 1976. In 2007, Sony&#x27;s Legacy Recordings regained the rights to Philadelphia International&#x27;s full catalog and the following year, PIR/Legacy released a box set titled &quot;Love Train: The Sound of Philadelphia&quot;.

Most of the music which was released by the label was recorded and produced at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, with chief engineer and later studio owner Joe Tarsia recording many of the sessions. More than 30 resident studio musicians, known collectively as MFSB (&quot;Mother Father Sister Brother&quot;), were based at this studio and backed up most of the recordings. Some of the musicians also acted as arrangers, writers, or producers for Philadelphia International as well as for other labels recording in the city. They included Bobby Martin, Norman Harris, Thom Bell, Ronnie Baker, Vince Montana and, later, Jack Faith, Dexter Wansel, and John Usry.

Gamble and Huff worked as independent producers with a series of artists in the late 1960s and early 1970s, including Jerry Butler, Wilson Pickett, and Dusty Springfield. They also produced the Jacksons&#x27; first two albums for Epic/CBS after the group left Motown in 1976. The first, titled &quot;The Jacksons,&quot; featured the platinum-selling single &quot;Enjoy Yourself&quot;, and a second album, &quot;Goin&#x27; Places,&quot; followed in 1977. Although they were released on a CBS subsidiary, Epic, both albums and the singles also had a Philadelphia International logo.

In 1965, Gamble and Huff started an independent label, Excel Records. It was soon renamed Gamble Records and in 1972, was folded into Philadelphia International as a subsidiary. In 1974, the subsidiary&#x27;s name was changed to TSOP Records, taken from the title of the 1974 hit single &quot;TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)&quot;. Artists for Excel/Gamble/TSOP included Dee Dee Sharp, Archie Bell &amp; the Drells, and the People&#x27;s Choice who had a top 10 single on TSOP in 1976 with &quot;Do It Any Way You Wanna&quot;. Later signings to the Philly International roster in the 1980s and 1990s included Patti LaBelle, the Stylistics, Phyllis Hyman, and the Dells.

Between 1973 and 1975, Gamble and Huff also distributed a boutique label called Golden Fleece, set up by musicians Norman Harris, Ronnie Baker, and Earl Young, which released the second album by the Trammps. Gamble and Huff also launched a short-lived subsidiary called Thunder Records. Created by Thom Bell, it only had two singles: Derek &amp; Cyndi&#x27;s &quot;You Bring Out the Best in Me/I&#x27;ll Do the Impossible for You&quot;, which was produced by Bell, and Fatback Band member Michael Walker&#x27;s &quot;I Got the Notion, You Got the Motion&quot;, produced by his brother and Spinners member Philippe Wynne.

==Later period==
By the mid-1980s, Philadelphia International Records had ended the distribution deal that they had with Columbia. The label was soon after picked up by Capitol/EMI Records. They continued to make hits, including Shirley Jones&#x27; &quot;Do You Get Enough Love&quot;, but their most successful years were behind them. In the 1990s, Philadelphia International launched a new subsidiary, Uncensored Records. Featuring Damon and No Question, the label releases hip hop music. Philadelphia International now largely concentrates on licensing its music catalog worldwide and has issued few new recordings since the mid-1980s when Gamble and Huff wound down their studio work together.

In 1989, Gamble and Huff won their first Grammy Award. Simply Red&#x27;s cover of &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Know Me By Now&quot; which was written by Gamble and Huff, received the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song. In 1999, Gamble and Huff were awarded the Lifetime Achievement Grammy from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. In 2008, the duo was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the non-performer category, joining their band the O&#x27;Jays, who were inducted in 2005.

In November 2009, PBS aired a two-part special, &quot;Love Train: The Sound of Philadelphia&quot;, that focuses on Gamble and Huff and the family of Philadelphia International Records artists. The concert was shot with a live audience on June 7, 2008 at the Borgata Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City; it showcased TSOP artists.

In February 2010, fire swept through part of the offices on Philadelphia&#x27;s Broad Street. The building was previously the home of another iconic part of the city&#x27;s musical heritage, Cameo-Parkway Records, based there during the 1950s and 1960s; it had become a tourist attraction. The fire was started deliberately by a man who had broken into the offices while so intoxicated by alcohol that he had no later recollection of the crime.

In August 2011, in honor of the 40th anniversary of the company, Philadelphia International Records launched TSOP Soul Radio, an online radio station that airs music and interviews from the Gamble and Huff catalog.

The building that housed Philadelphia International Records located on Broad and Spruce Streets was damaged by arson in 2010 and effectively was shut down. It was sold to local developer Dranoff Properties in 2014. On April 18, 2015, demolition started on the building. Dranoff Properties announced plans to build an SLS International Hotel at the site of the building. It is now home to the 47-story Arthaus Condominiums, where there is a tribute to Philadelphia International Records on display in the lobby.

Gamble and Huff have written more than 3,000 songs throughout their careers, making them two of the most efficient and productive songwriters of all time. They continue to write songs together from their homes in South Philadelphia.

== Philly soul ==
Philadelphia soul, or Philly soul, is a form of soul music that emanated from Philadelphia during the mid-1960s. It provided a smoother alternative to the deep soul of the 1960s while maintaining the soul and emotion of popular R&amp;B of the time. Philadelphia International Records was one of the most successful labels to capitalize on this new genre with acts such as the O&#x27;Jays and Teddy Pendergrass.

Philly soul is known for its incorporation of lush string arrangements along with penetrating brass, and often tells very personal and emotional stories. The world-renowned Philadelphia Orchestra&#x27;s string section was often employed to play on many of Philadelphia International Records&#x27; tracks. Philly soul is often considered a producer&#x27;s genre, the essence of the genre coming mostly from Gamble, Huff, Bell, and the other producers within PIR. Philly soul, with its driving rhythms, later became an inspiration for the disco craze of the 1970s.

==Discography==
Catalog numbers from 1971 to 1985 are part of CBS Records&#x27; overall numbering system, and therefore are discontinuous. Albums released from 1986-1990 were part of Capitol/EMI catalog numbering system. Catalog numbers for albums released after 1991 are from Philadelphia International&#x27;s distribution deal with Zoo Entertainment.

<text>Hans Garrett Moore (31 March 1834 – 6 October 1889), born in Carlingford, County Louth, Ireland, was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 43 years old, and a major in the 88th Regiment (later The Connaught Rangers), British Army during the Ninth Cape Frontier War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 29 December 1877 near Komgha, South Africa, during an action with the Gaikas, Major Moore saw that a private of the Frontier Mounted Police was unable to mount his horse and was left at the mercy of the enemy. Realising the danger, Major Moore rode back alone in the midst of the enemy, and continued in his efforts to save the man&#x27;s life until the latter was killed. The major shot two and received an assegai in the arm during this gallant attempt.

==Later life==
He later achieved the rank of colonel. He died at Lough Derg, County Tipperary on 6 October 1889 whilst attempting to save a life and was buried at Mount Jerome Cemetery, Dublin, Ireland.

==The medal==
The medal is on display in the MuseuMAfricA, Johannesburg, South Africa.

<doc id="1223831" wikidata="Q7187212" url="?curid=1223831" title="Phonestheme">
<text>A phonestheme ( ; phonaestheme in British English) is a pattern of sounds systematically paired with a certain meaning in a language. The concept was proposed in 1930 by British linguist J. R. Firth, who coined the term from the Greek &quot;phone&quot;, &quot;sound&quot;, and &quot;aisthema&quot;, &quot;perception&quot; (from &quot;aisthanomai&quot;, &quot;I perceive&quot;). For example, sequence &quot;sl-&quot; appears in English words denoting low-friction motion, like &quot;slide&quot;, &quot;slick&quot; and &quot;sled&quot;.

A phonestheme is different from a phoneme (a basic unit of word-differentiating sound) or a morpheme (a basic unit of meaning) because it does not meet the normal criterion of compositionality.

Within C.S. Peirce&#x27;s &quot;theory of signs&quot; the phonestheme is considered to be an &quot;icon&quot; rather than a &quot;symbol&quot; or an &quot;index&quot;.

==Identification==
Phonesthemes are of critical interest to students of the internal structure of words because they appear to be a case where the internal structure of the word is non-compositional; i.e., a word with a phonestheme in it has other material in it that is not itself a morpheme. Phonesthemes &quot;fascinate some linguists&quot;, as Ben Zimmer has phrased it, in a process that can become &quot;mystical&quot; or &quot;unscientific&quot;. 

For example, the English phonestheme &quot;gl-&quot; occurs in a large number of words relating to light or vision, like &quot;glitter&quot;, &quot;glisten&quot;, &quot;glow&quot;, &quot;gleam&quot;, &quot;glare&quot;, &quot;glint&quot;, &quot;glimmer&quot;, &quot;gloss&quot;, and so on; yet, despite this, the remainder of each word is not itself a phonestheme (i.e., a pairing of form and meaning); i.e., &quot;-isten&quot;, &quot;-ow&quot;, and &quot;-eam&quot; do not make meaningful contributions to &quot;glisten&quot;, &quot;glow&quot;, and &quot;gleam&quot;. There are multiple main ways in which phonesthemes are empirically identified.

===Corpus studies===
The first is through corpus studies, where the words of a language are subjected to statistical analysis, and the particular form-meaning pairing, or phonestheme, is shown to constitute a statistically unexpected distribution in the lexicon or not.

Corpus studies can inform a researcher about the current state of the lexicon, a critical first step, but importantly are completely uninformative when it comes to questions of whether and how phonesthemes are represented in the minds of language users.

===Study of patterns in neologisms===
The second type of approach makes use of the tendency for phonesthemes to participate in the coinage and interpretation of neologisms (i.e., new words in a language). Various studies have demonstrated that, when asked to invent or interpret new words, subjects tend to follow the patterns that are predicted by the phonesthemes in their language. It is known, for example, that the word &quot;bangle&quot; is a loan from Hindi but speakers tend to associate it with English onomatopoeia like &quot;bang&quot;. While this approach demonstrates the vitality of phonesthemic patterns, it does not provide any evidence about whether (or how) phonesthemes are represented in the minds of speaker-hearers.

===Study of linguistic processing patterns===
The final type of evidence uses the methods of psycholinguistics to study exactly how phonesthemes participate in language processing. One such method is phonesthemic priming — akin to morphological priming — which demonstrates that people represent phonesthemes much as they do typical morphemes, despite the fact that phonesthemes are non-compositional.

Discussions of phonesthesia are often grouped with other phenomena under the rubric of sound symbolism.

===Cross-linguistic similarities===

While phonaesthemes may be language-specific, it has been pointed out that people may be sensitive to some phonaesthemes (e.g. /fl-/, or /tr-/) irrespective of where sound-meaning correspondences are exemplified in the lexicon of their mother tongue (e.g. English, French, Spanish or Macedonian).

==Distribution==
Phonesthemes have been documented in numerous languages from diverse language families, among them English, Swedish, and other Indo-European languages, Austronesian languages, and Japanese.

While phonesthemes have mostly been identified in the onsets of words and syllables, they can have other forms. There has been some argument that sequences like &quot;-ash&quot; and &quot;-ack&quot; in English also serve as phonesthemes, due to their patterning in words that denote forceful, destructive contact (&quot;smash&quot;, &quot;crash&quot;, &quot;bash&quot;, etc.) and abrupt contact (&quot;smack&quot;, &quot;whack&quot;, &quot;crack&quot;, etc.), respectively.

In addition to the distribution of phonesthemes, linguists consider their &quot;motivation&quot;. In some cases, there may appear to be good sound-symbolic reasons why phonesthemes would have the form they have. In the case of &quot;-ack&quot;, for example, we might imagine that the words sharing this phonestheme do so because they denote events that would produce a similar sound. But critically, there are many phonesthemes for which there can be no sound-symbolic basis, such as &quot;gl-&quot;, for the simple reason that their meanings (such as &#x27;pertaining to light or vision&#x27;) entail no sound.

While there are numerous studies on living languages, research is lacking about ancient languages, although the first documented example of phonesthemes dates back to at least the fourth century B.C.: Plato&#x27;s
Cratylus clearly mentioned a gl- phonestheme (a different one from that discussed previously, as those words are not of Greek origin) as well as an st- one and gave an explanation in terms of phonosemantics.

==Examples==
Examples of phonesthemes in English include:

&quot;cl-&quot;: related to a closing motion of a single object, such as &quot;clam&quot;, &quot;clamp&quot;, &quot;clap&quot;, &quot;clasp&quot;, &quot;clench&quot;, &quot;cling&quot;, &quot;clip&quot;, &quot;clop&quot;, &quot;clutch&quot;.

&quot;fl-&quot;: related to movement, such as &quot;flap&quot;, &quot;flare&quot;, &quot;flee&quot;, &quot;flick&quot;, &quot;flicker&quot;, &quot;fling&quot;, &quot;flip&quot;, &quot;flit&quot;, &quot;flitter&quot;, &quot;flow&quot;, &quot;flutter&quot;, &quot;fly&quot;, &quot;flurry&quot;.

&quot;sl-&quot;: appears in words denoting frictionless motion, like &quot;slide&quot;, &quot;slick&quot;, &quot;sled&quot;, and so on. These are themselves a subset of a larger set of words beginning with “sl-“ that are pejorative behaviours, traits, or events: slab, slack, slang, slant, slap, slash, slate, slattern, slaver, slay, sleek, sleepy, sleet, slime, slip, slipshod, slit, slither, slobber, slog, slope, sloppy, slosh, sloth, slouch, slough, slovenly, slow, sludge, slug, sluggard, slum, slump, slur, slut, sly.

<doc id="1223840" wikidata="Q2909702" url="?curid=1223840" title="Bomberman (2005 video game)">
<text>is a 2005 video game developed by Racjin for the Nintendo DS. It was released by Hudson Soft in Japan on May 26, 2005, and published worldwide by Ubisoft. The game is notable for its chibi art style, previously seen in the &quot;Bomberman Land&quot; series. 

Part of the &quot;Bomberman&quot; franchise, it is the first entry to be released on the platform. A sequel, &quot;Bomberman 2&quot;, was released in 2008.

==Gameplay==
The single player mode features 10 levels with 10 stages each, a bonus stage after the 5th stage, and a boss battle for the 10th stage. A new mechanic is the item screen. All items collected are added to a stock. Using the touch screen, the player can use the items to power Bomberman up; thus, if Bomberman dies, the player can use any reserve items available to restart a stage with some power or even full power.

The multiplayer mode uses the touch screen to expand the playing area, with tunnels connecting the two screens. Some arenas make use of the microphone to do certain things like setting off remote bombs and using the shield. The revenge bomb setting adds a whole new level to multiplayer gameplay by allowing a player to throw bombs after they are eliminated from the game by flicking them off the touch screen with the stylus. If Super Revenge mode is activated, if a player blows up another player using a flicked Revenge bomb, the player respawns where their opponent fell.

&quot;Bomberman&quot; is one of many games on the Nintendo DS which allows a player without a copy of the game to participate. Players are able to temporarily download a full copy of the multiplayer game from someone who has the game.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, however, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 26 out of 40.

<text>Robert Henry Dee (May 18, 1933 – April 18, 1979) was an American professional football player who was a defensive end in the National Football League (NFL) and the American Football League (AFL).

== Biography ==
Dee was a three-sport letterman at the College of the Holy Cross who was one of the first players signed by the Boston Patriots of the AFL in 1960. After two years with the Washington Redskins in 1957–58, Dee returned to Holy Cross to tutor the team&#x27;s linemen. He became an ironman of the American Football League who never missed a game during his career, starting 112 consecutive games.

Despite equipment improvements over the years, Dee was a superstitious player who chose to wear the same helmet throughout his career (105 of 112 games). Dee etched his name in the history books by scoring the first points in American Football League history, scoring a touchdown when he dove onto a fumble by Bills QB Tommy O&#x27;Connell (father of former Boston Bruins GM Mike O&#x27;Connell) the end zone in the second quarter of the league&#x27;s first-ever exhibition game, a contest between the Patriots and the Bills on July 30, 1960. He was voted to four American Football League All-Star teams (1961, 1963–65) and is a member of the Patriots All-1960s (AFL) Team. Dee recorded 33 QB sacks (not including his strip sack of Tommy O&#x27;Connell in the AFL&#x27;s first Exhibition Game).

Dee sacked Frank Tripucka, Al Dorow, Hunter Enis, Jacky Lee, MC Reynolds, Randy Duncan, Cotton Davidson, George Blanda, Jack Kemp, Johnny Green, John Hadl, Tobin Rote, Len Dawson, Eddie Wilson, Dick Wood, Joe Namath, Tom Flores, Rick Norton and Bob Griese and recovered fumbles by Al Carmichael, Art Baker, Wayne Crow, Jacky Lee, Paul Lowe, Bill Tobin, Wray Carlton &amp; Max Chobian.

He had two interceptions in the Patriots 26-8 Eastern Divisional Playoff Game win over the Buffalo Bills. In that game, he wore one sneaker and one football shoe with spikes, which made him maneuver better in the snow in the game played at War Memorial Stadium on December 28, 1963.

On July 22, 1968, Dee announced his retirement from professional football, citing a business opportunity that was &quot;too good to resist.&quot; Dee died of a heart attack in 1979 while on a business trip. He was awarded a game ball for his outstanding performance in the Patriots 34–17 win over the Houston Oilers on November 29, 1964. He was inducted in the Patriots Hall of Fame on August 18, 1993. In recognition of his accomplishments on the field, the Patriots retired his number (89).

<doc id="1223848" wikidata="Q560549" url="?curid=1223848" title="North European Plain">
<text>The North European Plain ( – North German Plain; ; – Central European Plain; and ; French: &quot;Plaine d&#x27;Europe du Nord&quot;) is a geomorphological region in Europe that covers all or parts of Belgium, the Netherlands (i.e. the Low Countries), Germany, Denmark, and Poland.

It consists of the low plains between the Hercynian Europe (Central European Highlands) to the south and coastlines of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea to the north. These two seas are separated by the Jutland Peninsula (Denmark). The North European Plain is connected to the East European Plain, together forming the majority of the Great European Plain (European Plain).

==Geography==
Elevations vary between 0 and 200 m (0 to about 650 ft). While mostly used as farmland, the region also contains bogs, heath and lakes.
The Wadden Sea, a large tidal area, is located on the North Sea coast.

A number of freshwater lagoons including the Szczecin Lagoon, the Vistula Lagoon and the Curonian Lagoon are found on the Baltic Sea coast.

==Location==
The North European Plain covers Flanders (northern Belgium and Northern France), the Netherlands, Northern Germany, Denmark, and most of central-western Poland; it touches the Czech Republic and southwestern part of Sweden as well. 

Parts of eastern England can also be considered part of the same plain; as they share its low-lying character and were connected by land to the continent during the last ice age. The Northern European Plains are located also under the Baltic Sea.

==Rivers==
Major river-drainage basins include, from west to east: The Ems, Weser, Elbe, Oder, Vistula and this region of Europe is where the Rhine river starts.

The soils surrounding the river basins are thin, making agriculture difficult.

==Sub-regions==
===Low Countries===
Historically, especially in the Middle Ages and Early modern period, the western section has been known as the Low Countries.

===North German Plain===
The North German Plain is located north of the Central Uplands of Germany.

===Polish Plain===
The part in modern-day Poland is called the &quot;Polish Plain&quot; ( or &quot;Nizina Polska&quot;) and stretches from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Sudetes and Carpathians

===English flatlands===
The extension of the plain into England consists mainly of the flatlands of East Anglia, the Fens and Lincolnshire, where the landscape is in parts strikingly similar to that of the Netherlands.

<doc id="1223849" wikidata="Q144681" url="?curid=1223849" title="Zaki Badawi">
<text>[[Sheikh]] Mohammed Aboulkhair Zaki Badawi (), 
KBE, GCFO (14 January 1922 – 24 January 2006) was a prominent Egyptian Islamic scholar, community activist, and promoter of interfaith-dialogue. He was the principal of the Muslim College in London, which he founded in 1986. He also was a frequent writer and broadcaster on Islamic affairs.

==Early life and education==
Born in Egypt, Badawi trained at al-Azhar University in Cairo, gaining an undergraduate degree in Theology. He received the King Farouk First Prize for the best undergraduate student, and obtained subsequently a master&#x27;s degree in Arabic Language and Literature in 1947 at the same university. He again received the King Farouk First Prize for the best postgraduate student. He moved to the United Kingdom in 1951 and studied Psychology at University College London, obtaining his B.Sc. degree in 1954 and a Ph.D. degree in Modern Muslim Thought from the University of London.

==Career and further life==
After his education, Badawi returned to al-Azhar University to teach Muslim Thought and Scientific Research Methods. He established a Muslim College in Malaysia, and taught Arabic and Islamic Studies at the University of Malaya in Singapore and in Kuala Lumpur. In 1964 he became Professor of Islamic Education at Ahmadu Bello University, Northern Nigeria and Professor of Islamic Education and Dean of Arts at Bayero College, Nigeria. In 1976, Badawi went to London as a research professor for the Hajj Research Centre of the King Abdul Aziz University in Saudi Arabia.

In 1978, Badawi was appointed director of the Islamic Cultural Centre (ICC) and Chief Imam of the London Central Mosque in Regent&#x27;s Park. In this period, He participated in establishing the Shariah Council as a facility to reconcile conflicts between Islamic law and the British civil code. Badawi was elected chairman of the Imams and Mosques Council by the National Conference of Imams and Mosque Officials of the UK in 1984.

In 1982, Badawi joined the board of the Islamic Banking System in Luxembourg. He participated in negotiations with the Bank of England to establish the first Islamic financial institution licensed in the United Kingdom, the Islamic Finance House (IFH). Badawi managed the IFH for three years, and published and lectured on Muslim law in relation to banking, finance and business ethics. He was also a guest professor in business ethics at Cranfield University Business School, where he lectured to MBA students.

In 1986, Badawi established the Muslim College in London and became its director. The college became a postgraduate school for the training of imams and Muslim teachers in the West. The curriculum includes the study of both Islam and Western society and emphasizes interfaith dialogue. Badawi co-edited &quot;Encounter Magazine&quot; with news on interfaith meetings, and edited the &quot;Islamic Quarterly&quot; for four years. He often contributed to daily newspapers, and he published and lectured on a wide range of issues, including various conflicts, Islam in Britain, female genital cutting, democracy, the rights of the fetus, and human rights.

Badawi also chaired The Arabic Forum, the Islamic Religious Council and the National Council for the Welfare of Muslim Prisoners, established in 2001. He was a co-founder of the Three Faiths Forum, vice chairman of the World Congress of Faiths and director/trustee of the Forum Against Islamophobia and Racism (FAIR).

Badawi was a well-known voice for religious moderation and tolerance, and was the first prominent Muslim to criticize imams in the UK who did not teach in English. According to Professor Shk. Ali Hamid, Badawi advocated that Salman Rushdie should simply be ignored, and not given any attention.

In July 2005, soon after the London bombings, on 7 July, Badawi was refused entry into the US, upon arrival, having already been issued a visa. The US Customs and Border Protection office said Badawi had been refused entry to the country based on information indicating that he was &quot;inadmissible&quot;. He accepted an apology from the United States government for his denial of entry into the country, at a time when he was scheduled to speak at a conference in the US.

Badawi died in London on 24 January 2006.

==Honours==
Badawi was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 2004. He also was appointed by The Duke of Castro as Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of Francis I (GCFO) in recognition of his interfaith work.

<text>Company Sergeant Major John Robert Osborn, VC (2 January 1899 − 19 December 1941) was a Canadian soldier. Osborn was a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was born in Norfolk, England, and served in the Royal Navy during World War I.

==Details==

<text>Streetsville (pop. 47,327) is a neighbourhood located in the northwestern corner of the city of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, on the Credit River. Although Streetsville occupies the west and east banks of the river, the majority is located on the west bank of the river.

A town prior to the 1974 amalgamations that formed the City of Mississauga, it seeks to keep a &quot;small town&quot; charm by retaining a variety of historical buildings and streetscapes. As part of this attempt to maintain a separate identity from the larger city, the names of two main Mississauga streets, as they pass through Streetsville, retain the names they had when Streetsville was an independent village: Mississauga Road and Bristol Road, which remain as Queen Street and Main Street respectively. Other main thoroughfares that pass through or near Streetsville include Britannia Road, Creditview Road, Eglinton Avenue, and Erin Mills Parkway.

==History==
===Before 1800===
The area surrounding the Credit River was populated by the Iroquois people up until the early 18th century, when it was taken by the Ojibwa. European settlers came to know them specifically as the Mississaugas, which eventually became the name of the area itself. By 1805, the Natives had either ceded or sold most of this land over to British governance.

===Settlement===

The beginnings of Streetsville are interwoven with the history of its founder, Timothy Street. Street was born in 1778 in the American colonies to a British Loyalist family. At the age of 23, he moved with his family from New York to St. David&#x27;s, a settlement on the Niagara River in Upper Canada (as Ontario was then known).

In 1818, the British made a second purchase of of land from the indigenous Mississauga peoples. Before it could be opened for settlement, the land had to be surveyed, and as was usual for the time, surveyors would receive a grant of land from the parcel that they surveyed as compensation for their work. Timothy Street, along with Richard Bristol, a qualified surveyor, applied for a contract to survey parts of the newly available land. As they did their work, Street quickly began to appreciate the immense potential for settlement along the Credit River, and made plans to erect both a saw and grist mill once his work was finished.

In April 1819, the surveyed land was opened for settlement, and the first settler in the area, James Glendinning, settled on a parcel of land along Mullet Creek. Timothy Street did build his saw and grist mills, using stones from Glendinning&#x27;s land.

A large quarry of red clay lay on the west side of the village, encouraging the use of brick for construction.

In 1821, Streetsville&#x27;s first general store, now known as Montreal House, was built, and still stands. Another landmark, Timothy Street&#x27;s house, was built in 1825 and is one of the oldest brick houses in Peel Region.

In 1855, William Graydon and Peter Douglass built a large brick building, and sold it in 1859 to Bennet Franklin, a partner in Barber Brothers Toronto Woollen Mills. It became known as Franklin House. In 1910, under new ownership, the name was changed to the Queen&#x27;s Hotel. Although it ceased to operate as a hotel when its public room was closed with the enforcement of the Canada Temperance Act, it continued to be used for commercial purposes. At present, it has been designated under the terms of the Ontario Heritage Act and protected by a heritage easement, and now houses a restaurant and a variety of small businesses and offices.

In 1858, Streetsville was incorporated as a village, with a population of 1500 people. The primary work was found in grist mills, sawmills and tanneries. Timothy Street&#x27;s son, John, was the first reeve. For the next century, Streetsville largely existed as a long narrow village with all of its shops, three churches, the cenotaph and the library located on Queen Street, which ran between the Credit River and the railway track.

A century later, in 1951, the population of Streetsville had declined to 1,139 people. Then in 1953, two of the first suburbs in Canada, Vista Heights and Riverview, were built to the southwest and northeast respectively. Vista Heights was notable because the town council made the unprecedented decision to require the developer to build a K-6 (kindergarten to Grade 6) elementary school. These suburbs and Vista Heights Public School opened in 1955, presaging the future rapid growth of middle-class suburbs in the area. Another suburban area that grew as a de facto expansion of Streetsville (not as development reaching out to it from the main urban area of Mississauga) is River Grove, which is centred along Bristol Road east of the Credit River and extends to Creditview Road; although this area was developed in the late 1980&#x27;s, well after Streetsville&#x27;s amalgamation into Mississauga.

===1962 incorporation and 1974 municipal reorganization===
As families moved into the new suburbs, the town&#x27;s population grew rapidly. By January 1962, Streetsville&#x27;s population reached 5,000, and it was incorporated as a town. The first mayor was Frank Dowling.

In 1968, the Town of Mississauga was created from Toronto Township absorbing the police village of Malton. Although Streetsville and Port Credit were excluded from this amalgamation, they were amalgamated in 1974 when Mississauga became a city.

==Politics==
=== Municipal ===
Streetsville is a member of the Ward 11 within the city of Mississauga, which was created from Ward 6. Representing the ward is Councillor George Carlson, who was elected Councillor of the eleventh ward in 2000 and was re-elected in 2003, 2006, 2010 and 2014. Carlson is a direct descendant of one of Streetsville&#x27;s founders, Henry Rutledge (1797–1875) who also served as a local Councillor. Prior to the annexing of Mississauga, Hazel McCallion was the mayor of Streetsville (1970–1973) and was the township&#x27;s last reeve (1967–1970). She was the fifth mayor of Mississauga and lived in Streetsville until her death on January 29, 2023 from pancreatic cancer.

===Provincial===
Streetsville resides in the provincial electoral district (riding) of Mississauga-Streetsville. The riding was created in 2003 after Mississauga—Erindale and Mississauga South were divided up. The riding was represented by Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament Bob Delaney. Delaney was elected in the provincial election of 2003, by defeating Progressive Conservative Nina Tangri by over 7,000 votes. In 2006, Delaney was appointed the Parliamentary Assistant to Minister Responsible for Seniors. He was re-elected in the provincial election of 2007 again, defeating Tangri by 11,155 votes. On January 25, 2010, Delaney was named Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Revenue.
As of July 26, 2023 this riding is represented by Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament Rechie Valdez, Minister of Small Business. (https://www.ourcommons.ca/members/en/rechie-valdez(110538))

===Federal===
Prior to 1993, Streetsville favoured the Conservative party with Progressive Conservative Bob Horner being elected as a Member of Parliament (MP) in the 1984 and 1988 federal elections. Since then Streetsville voters swayed towards the Liberals with the party winning the riding consecutively to this date. In 2000, Liberal MP Steve Mahoney defeated Alliance candidate Philip Leong in the Federal Mississauga-Streetsville riding and remained in office until 2003. Wajid Khan then took the riding in 2004 by beating Conservative Nina Tangri by 8,481 votes and continued onto a second term after defeating Conservative challenger Raminder Gill by 5,792 votes in 2006. During his second term, Khan served as a consultant to Stephen Harper and the Conservative Party on issues concerning the Middle East. Based on an ultimatum established by the Conservatives, Khan switched parties in 2007 and ran as a Conservative candidate in the 2008 elections. Liberal Bonnie Crombie defeated Khan in the election by 5,000 votes.

==Community==

===Streetsville as a Community Node===
Streetsville is one of Mississauga&#x27;s largest and most identifiable historical communities due to its suburban surroundings, which makes it stand out to a greater degree than former towns in older urban areas and is likely the reason for its nickname &quot;The Village in the City&quot;. It still retains its historic main street and is home to many historical buildings. Streetsville is known as a Community Node, and therefore provides various resources applicable to a Community Node. The city of Mississauga focuses on Streetsville&#x27;s urban structure to grow in existing and proposed services and the community infrastructure. As a Community Node, there are many things in Streetsville that are used on a day-to-day basis. This includes: local shops, restaurants, community facilities, entertainment, schools, parks, and an impressive housing stock that meets the requirements of new residents.

===Bread and Honey Festival===

In 1973 Streetsville held the first Bread and Honey Festival. This was an acknowledgement to the town&#x27;s history and its involvement with milling as Kraft Canada and ADM Milling had well-established flourmills in the area. The festival become an annual event being held on the first weekend of June. The festival is held at Streetsville Memorial Park. Some of the events include live musical performances, a carnival run, a consumers market, a pancake breakfast, and parade. The festival went on hiatus in 2020. It came back in 2022 as the Bread and Honey Street Festival and returned as a full festival in 2023.

===Canada Day===
Every July 1 at the Memorial Park dedicated to F.B. McFarren, the neighbourhood holds a local Canada Day celebration. There are various activities occurring throughout the afternoon, ranging from face-painting to dance performances. Local businesses sponsor and execute various performances throughout the evening and is then finished with a firework display occurring around 10pm.

===Santa Claus Parade===
The annual Mississauga Santa Claus Parade now takes place in Streetsville. The parade starts on Queen Street at Britannia Road and travels south through the village to disperse at various locations after the Church Street junction. The parade was founded in 1974.

===Christmas Market===

In 2016, the Streetsville BIA and City of Mississauga held its inaugural &#x27;Christmas in the Village&#x27; Market in the Streetsville Village Square on the last weekend of November. After a two-year Renovation in 2014, the Streetsville Village Square now includes a covered stage, the town cenotaph and outdoor seating for residents.

The Streetsville and District Minor Hockey Association was established in 1946. Streetsville and seven other communities in the Toronto Township formed the Toronto Township Hockey League (TTHL) In 1962 the Streetsville and District Minor Hockey Association began to play in their new rink, Vic Johnston Community Centre. During the early years the Streetsville&#x27;s Hockey team played under many names including, the Thunderbirds, Hounds, Tigers, Kings, and Panthers. In the 1967-68 season they left the TTHL. Streetsville iced five teams to play in the Tri-County A league of the Ontario Minor Hockey Association (OMHA) at the start of the 1968-69 season. That first season Streetsville won two championships. In the late 1980s, the President and late Bill Mann embarked on a name search for the Streetsville Rep teams. The name chosen was Tigers, and from that date on the name and team colours were adopted into the Rules and Regulations. The Tiger logo was designed and adopted in 1990 and has been incorporated into all tiger equipment, sweaters, pants, equipment bags, hats and jackets. The Tigers moved to the OMHA Central AAA league in 1991-1992 where they competed for four years. Since joining the GTHL, the Tiger teams have been very competitive winning two Divisional Champions, one Carnation Cup and one City Championship. 2006 the Streetsville Tigers Celebrated 60 years of hockey in Streetsville.

<text>Toronto Township is a former municipality now mostly part of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, with its northern extremity now a part of Brampton. It was directly west of but not part of the City of Toronto (which was named York at the time of the township&#x27;s establishment), and its land area makes up the majority of present-day Mississauga.

==History==
Toronto Township was formed as a locally unincorporated part of York County, Upper Canada on when officials from York purchased of land from the Mississaugas (First Nations people) for 1,000 Pounds. After the land was surveyed, much of it was given by the Crown in the form of land grants to Loyalists. More than a dozen small communities grew in this area, most of which were located near natural resources, waterways for industry and fishing, and routes leading into York. The township became part of Peel County in 1851. In 1873, in light of the continued growth seen in this area, Toronto Township was incorporated as a rural municipality and a council was created to oversee the affairs of the various villages that were unincorporated at that time. The council&#x27;s responsibilities included road maintenance, the establishment of a police force, and mail delivery service.

Toronto Township was a municipality until 1967, when the town&#x27;s citizens and politicians voted to change the township to a town and rename it Mississauga, which won over the second-place &quot;Sheridan&quot; after a naming contest. Mississauga became a city seven years later in 1974, and ceded its northernmost area (and thus lands formerly part of the township) to Brampton.

<text>Colonel James Morris Colquhoun Colvin VC (26 August 1870 – 7 December 1945) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to a member of a British or Commonwealth force.

==Early life==
Colvin was born in Bijnor, United Provinces, British India to James Colquhoun Colvin of the Manor House, Sutton Veny, Wiltshire, and Camilla Fanny Marie Morris, who was the eldest daughter of the Rev. Edward Morris. Colvin&#x27;s father serviced with the Bengal Civil Service. He was awarded the India Mutiny medal for defending the House of Arrah. The Colvin family had been involved for a long time in various capacities in the British East Indies, serving as soldiers and administrators. Colvin&#x27;s extended family members included Sir John Russell Colvin, Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Provinces during the Indian Mutiny, and his sons Sir Auckland, K.C.S.I. and Sir Elliot Graham, K.C.S.I. Their most notable cousin was the English writer and curator Sir Sidney Colvin, known for his friendship with the young Robert Louis Stevenson.

==Military service==
He was educated at Charterhouse and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. There, for distinguished proficiency, he was awarded the Pollock Gold Medal and Memoir as a Cadet Senior Under Officer. He was also awarded the Regulation Sword for exemplary conduct. A travelling clock, aneroid barometer, thermometer and compass were awarded to him for maths and mechanics. H.R.H. the Duke of Cambridge presented the awards after inspecting cadets at RMA Woolwich, on 26 July 1889.

On 27 July 1889, Colvin joined the Royal Engineers as a second lieutenant. Three years later, he was promoted to lieutenant on 27 July 1892. He served in the Chitral Relief Force in 1895 with the 4th Company, Bengal Sappers and Miners. He served on the North West Frontier of India with the Malakand Field Force in 1897–1898, and took part in operations in Bajaur, and in the Mohmand country and in Buner. He was mentioned in dispatches.

===Mohmand Campaign===
Colvin was 27 years old, and a lieutenant in the British Army Corps of Royal Engineers during the Mohmand campaign of 1897–98 in India when his actions resulted in him subsequently being awarded the Victoria Cross.
Colvin was in the Mohmand Valley, North West British India, with Lieutenant Thomas Colclough Watson on the night of 16/17 September 1897. Watson collected a party of volunteers and led them into the village of Bilot. They attempted to dislodge the enemy who were inflicting losses on the British. Although Watson had been incapacitated by his wounds, undeterred, Lieutenant Colvin made two additional attempts to clear enemy fighters from the village. &quot;He was conspicuous during the whole night for his devotion to his men, in the most exposed positions and under very heavy fire.&quot;.

The award of the Victoria Cross was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 20 May 1898. The citation read;
Queen Victoria invested Colvin with the Victoria Cross on 19th July 1898 at Windsor Castle.

Two others who served with Colvin were also awarded a Victoria Cross—Lieutenant Thomas Colclough Watson and Corporal James Smith, The Buffs ( East Kent Regiment ).

Colvin served with the Malakand Field Force, 1897–98, where he took part in operations in Bajaur, the Mohmand Country and in Bruner (mentioned-in-Despatches L.G. 11 January 1898).

===Second Boer War===
Colvin was promoted to captain on 1 April 1900, and served in South Africa in 1901–02 during the Second Boer War as Special Service Officer. In May 1901 he was appointed an Aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Sir Bindon Blood, who was stationed in eastern Transvaal. He remained in South Africa until the war ended in May 1902, and left for Calcutta on the &quot;SS Umlazi&quot; two months later. For his service in the war, he was again mentioned in despatches (L.G. 22 August 1902), received the brevet promotion to major and awarded the Queen&#x27;s Medal with three clasps on 22 August 1902, and his name was noted as qualified for Staff employment.

Captain Moutray Read was well known as an athlete and won the heavyweight championship (boxing) of India eight times, and the middle-weight twice. He also won the Army and Navy heavyweight championship at Aldershot and Portsmouth three times, an unequalled record. During one match, an opponent recalls wishing to throw in the towel against him, citing his &quot;devastating jab&quot;. As a result, Capt. Moutray Read earned the nickname of &quot;Widowmaker&quot;.

Mrs. Moutray Read received news of her son&#x27;s death while living at 3 Wentworth Place, Wicklow, Co. Wicklow, also a British Army Field Hospital Supplies Depot. Captain Moutray Read is listed on a brass commemorative plaque along with other local men at Wicklow Parish Church, Wicklow, Co. Wicklow. He is also commemorated by a plaque on the wall of the Church of St. Michael and All Angels in Bampton, where his father owned Castle Grove, a fine house on the edge of this small town in Devonshire. Anketell&#x27;s niece, Miss Henrietta Desirée Moutray Read, lived at Castle Grove marrying Sir Christopher William Gerald Henry Codrington in 1969. Anketell&#x27;s elder sister Rose Moutray Read was an author and horticulturist.

==Details==
He was 30 years old, and a captain in the 1st Battalion, The Northamptonshire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 25 September 1915 near Hulluch, France, Captain Moutray Read, although partially gassed, went out several times in order to rally parties of different units which were disorganised and retiring. He led them back into the firing line and regardless of danger to himself, moved about under withering fire, encouraging them, but he was mortally wounded while carrying out this gallant work. He had shown conspicuous bravery on other occasions, particularly on the night of 29/30 July when he carried out of action an officer who was mortally wounded, under a hot fire of rifle and grenades.

==Further information==
Captain Moutray Read is buried in the Dud Corner Cemetery, Le Rutoire, near Loos-en-Gohelle, France, 2 miles NW of Lens, Plot VII, Row F, Grave 19.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is on loan to and displayed at the Abington Park Museum, Northampton, England.

<text>Joseph, Baron Van Damme (born 25 August 1940 in Brussels), known as José van Dam, is a Belgian bass-baritone, described as having &quot;a magnificent resonant and expressive voice&quot; and being &quot;an excellent actor&quot;.

==Life and career==
At the age of 17, he entered the Brussels Royal Conservatory and studied with Frederic Anspach. A year later, he graduated with diplomas and first prizes in voice and opera performance. He made his opera début as the music teacher Don Basilio in Gioacchino Rossini’s &quot;Il Barbiere di Siviglia&quot; at the Opéra Royal de Wallonie-Liège in 1960, and was engaged the next year at the Paris Opera where he remained until 1965, when he sang his first major role, Escamillo from Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;. He then sang for two seasons at Geneva, La Scala, Covent Garden, and in Paris. At Geneva, Van Dam sang in the première of Milhaud&#x27;s &quot;La mère coupable&quot; in 1966. Lorin Maazel heard van Dam and invited him to record Ravel’s &quot;L’heure espagnole&quot; with him for Deutsche Grammophon. In 1967, Maazel asked him to join the Deutsche Oper in Berlin.

Van Dam has performed at L’Opéra de Paris, Covent Garden, the Metropolitan Opera, Teatro alla Scala in Milan, Vienna State Opera, Deutsche Oper Berlin, the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels, Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, the Salzburg Festival, and festivals in Aix-en-Provence and Orange, France. 

Van Dam has become the Master in Residence of the singing section at the Queen Elisabeth Music Chapel in his home country, Belgium, since 2011.

==Awards==
Van Dam is also a concert, oratorio, and lieder singer and has won international awards for his performances on stage and in recordings. Berlin conferred on him the title of Kammersänger in 1974, and the same year he received the German Music Critics’ Prize. Other awards include the Gold Medal of the Belgian Press (1976), Grand Prix de l’Académie française du Disque (1979), Orphée d’Or de l’Académie Lyrique Française (1980), the European Critics’ Prize, (1985), Diapason d’Or and Prix de la Nouvelle Académie du Disque (1993), and the Orphée d’Or de l’Académie du Disque Lyrique (1994).

In August 1998, His Majesty King Albert II of Belgium made van Dam a baron, recognizing him as one of the finest classical singers. On 4 December 1999 van Dam was one of the performers at the marriage of Belgium&#x27;s Crown Prince Philippe and Mathilde d&#x27;Udekem d&#x27;Acoz.

Van Dam is featured as one of the three interviewees in &#x27;Doucement les Basses&#x27;, with Gabriel Bacquier and Claudio Desderi discussing their approach to roles in the bass-baritone repertoire.

==Films==

Van Dam appears in the films &quot;The Music Teacher&quot; (1988) as Joachim Dallayrac, and in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (1979) as Leporello, directed by Joseph Losey, and conducted by Maazel. Van Dam also appears as Philip in the DVD of the 1996 production of &quot;Don Carlos&quot; from the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris under Pappano directed by Luc Bondy, and as Hans Sachs in the 2003 Zürich Opera production of &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; conducted by Franz Welser-Möst.

== Recordings ==

Among van Dam&#x27;s extensive discography are complete studio recordings of &quot;Carmen&quot; as Escamillo (in 1974 under Lombard in Strasbourg, in 1975 under Solti in London and 1982 under Karajan in Berlin), as the father in &quot;Louise&quot; (Rudel, 1977), &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; (as the Speaker, 1980), &quot;Faust&quot; as Méphistophélès (conducted by Michel Plasson, 1991), &quot;Les contes d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot; as the four opponents of Hoffmann (in 1988 under Cambreling, and under Nagano in 1994–1996), &quot;Don Carlos&quot; (1996), and &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; (conducted by Sir Georg Solti, 1997). In 2010, the Metropolitan released his 1980 &quot;Wozzeck&quot; (with Anja Silja and Richard Cassilly, conducted by James Levine) on compact disc.

With Herbert von Karajan, he also recorded &quot;Fidelio&quot; (1970), &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; (1978), &quot;Salome&quot; (1978), &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; (1978), &quot;Parsifal&quot; (1979–1980), &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; (1980), and &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; (1981–1983), &quot;Ein Deutsches Requiem&quot; (1985), as well as Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony (1977 and 1983).

One of the bass-baritone&#x27;s greatest successes was in the title role of Olivier Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Saint François d&#x27;Assise&quot;. The world-premiere was recorded under Seiji Ozawa (1983), as was the Salzburg production, under Kent Nagano (1998).

<text>Harry Sherwood Ranken VC (3 September 1883 – 25 September 1914) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Harry Ranken graduated from the University of Glasgow in 1905, and joined the British Army in 1909. Ranken was 31 years old, and a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps, British Army, attached to 1st Battalion, The King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 19 and 20 September 1914 at Haute-Avesnes, France, Captain Ranken was severely wounded in the leg whilst attending to his duties on the battlefield under shrapnel and rifle fire. He arrested the bleeding from this and bound it up, then continued to dress the wounds of his men, sacrificing his own chance of survival to their needs. When he finally permitted himself to be carried to the rear his case had become almost desperate and he died on 25 September.

Ranken is buried in Braine Communal Cemetery.
==Legacy==
Ranken worked at the Brook fever hospital in South East London, which was on the site adjacent to the Royal Herbert Military Hospital; the original hospital designed on the principles laid down by Florence Nightingale after the Crimean war. When the military hospital moved across the road to a new set of buildings around 1977 - the Queen Elizabeth Military Hospital - the administration block at the QE was named after him - Ranken House. The QE has since been largely rebuilt and is now a civilian hospital, but the name has been preserved. Harry Ranken&#x27;s photograph and a copy of his citation are still proudly displayed in the reception area of Ranken House.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Army Medical Services Museum &quot;(Aldershot, England)&quot;.

<text>Metailurini is an extinct taxonomic tribe of large saber-toothed cats that lived in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America from the Miocene to the Pleistocene.

The best known Metalurini genera are &quot;Dinofelis&quot; and &quot;Metailurus&quot;. Metailurini had canines longer than &quot;Neofelis&quot;, but smaller than true saber toothed cats. The teeth were also more conical than flat, so called &quot;scimitar-toothed&quot;, having broad and mildly elongated upper canines. Like most extinct cats, the majority of species in Metailurini are known primarily from fragments. However, the systematic position and taxonomy of these creatures is now accepted as being true members of Felidae and descended from &quot;Proailurus&quot; and &quot;Pseudaelurus&quot;. Within Felidae, they had been traditionally considered to belong in Machairodontinae, albeit some have in the past proposed a relationship to Pantherinae, all phylogenetic analyses support the former classification but the monophyly of the taxon itself might not be supported.

==History==
Metailurini was first named as a tribe by Beaumont in 1964 for the genera &quot;Metailurus&quot;, &quot;Therailurus&quot;, and tentatively &quot;Dinofelis&quot;. &quot;Stenailurus&quot; was described in 1972 and assigned to the group, which the authors elevated to a subfamily Metailurinae. In a 1983 review of machairodontine classification, Berta &amp; Galiano added &quot;Adelphailurus&quot; and &quot;Pontosmilus&quot; to the tribe, though subsequent papers consider &quot;Pontosmilus&quot; a junior synonym of the machairodontin &quot;Paramachaerodus&quot;, and &quot;Therailurus&quot; a junior synonym of &quot;Dinofelis&quot;. A further genus was added in 1987 with the description of &quot;Fortunictis&quot;.

The most recent addition was the genus &quot;Yoshi&quot; in 2014.

<text>Mischa Auer (born Mikhail Semyonovich Unkovsky, ; 17 November 1905 – 5 March 1967) was a Russian-born American actor who moved to Hollywood in the late 1920s. He first appeared in film in 1928. Auer had a long career playing in many of the era&#x27;s best known films. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1936 for his performance in the screwball comedy &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot;, which led to further zany comedy roles. He later moved into television and acted in films again in France and Italy well into the 1960s.

==Early life==
Auer was born in St. Petersburg, Russia to a Jewish family. His name is usually seen as Mischa Ounskowsky, Mischa being the German transliteration of Misha (the diminutive form of Mikhail), and Ounskowsky being the French transliteration of his surname (with an unexplained additional &quot;s&quot;).
Auer&#x27;s father was an Imperial Russian Navy officer Semyon Ivanovich Unkovsky (1871–1921) and his mother was Zoya Lvovna Unkovskaya (), the eldest daughter of the Hungarian-born violinist Leopold Auer. Contrary to the popular belief, his father did not die when Mischa was three years old. Semyon Unkovsky left Zoya Auer and married her sister, Maria Lvovna Auer (they had a son, also named Mischa (Mikhail Unkovsky) (1904–1940), Russian actor, arrested in 1938 on counter-revolutionary charges and died in forced labour camp in Kolyma). Semyon Unkovsky retired from the Navy in 1906 and settled in Kaluga, Russia, where he died in 1921. Leopold Auer emigrated to the United States after the Russian Revolution. Mischa Auer and his mother became separated, but were reunited during the Russian Civil War. She, however, died of typhus. Auer was able to contact his grandfather, who brought him to the United States in August 1920.

==Career==
Auer began performing on the stage in the 1920s in Bertha Kalich&#x27;s Thalia Yiddish Theater, then moved to Hollywood, where he first appeared in 1928 in &quot;Something Always Happens&quot;. He appeared in several small, mostly uncredited roles into the 1930s, appearing in such films as &quot;Rasputin and the Empress&quot;, &quot;Viva Villa!&quot;, &quot;The Yellow Ticket&quot;, the George Gershwin musical &quot;Delicious&quot;, the Paramount Pictures all-star revue &quot;Paramount on Parade&quot; and &quot;The Lives of a Bengal Lancer&quot;.

In 1936, Auer was cast as Alice Brady&#x27;s protégé in the comedy &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot;, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Prior to that, he had been mostly playing villains. He stated, &quot;That one role made a comic out of me.&quot; From then on, he was regularly cast in zany comedy roles. Auer played the ballet instructor Kolenkov in the Best Picture-winning &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take It with You&quot; and the prince-turned-fashion designer in Walter Wanger&#x27;s &quot;Vogues of 1938&quot;. Auer can also be seen cavorting in such films as: &quot;Arsène Lupin&quot; (1932), &quot;One Hundred Men and a Girl&quot;, &quot;Hold That Ghost&quot;, &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot;, &quot;Spring Parade&quot;, &quot;Hellzapoppin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Cracked Nuts&quot;, &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot;, and &quot;Up in Mabel&#x27;s Room&quot; (1944). He was also one of the large cast of &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;, and appeared in a pair of vehicles for opera singer Lily Pons.

In the 1950s, Auer appeared on several episodic television series, such as &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Studio One&quot;, &quot;Broadway Television Theatre&quot; and &quot;The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre&quot;. He appeared in Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Arkadin&quot; (1955), and in the 1960s, he made several films in France and Italy, including &quot;The Christmas That Almost Wasn&#x27;t&quot;.

==Personal life==

Auer married four times and had three children. His first wife was Norma Tillman (1931–1941), whom he married in 1931. They had a son Anthony and a daughter Zoia. They divorced in 1941. In the same year, he married Joyce Hunter (4 December 1941 – 1950), his second wife, whom he lived with for 9 years. His third wife was Susanne Kalish (5 May 1950 – 1957), and they had one daughter. His fourth wife was Elise Souls Lee (1965 – 5 March 1967) who died in 1976.

==Death==
Auer died of cardiovascular disease in Rome in 1967 and was interred at Prospect Hill Cemetery in Gloversville, New York.

<text>Robert Quigg (28 February 1885 – 14 May 1955) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. The award was made for his actions during the Battle of the Somme in the First World War.

==Early life==
Robert Quigg was born on 28 February 1885 in Ardihannon, near Bushmills in County Antrim, Ireland (now Northern Ireland), one of six children of Robert Quigg and his wife Matilda . His father worked as a boatman and tour guide at the nearby Giant&#x27;s Causeway. Educated at the Giant&#x27;s Causeway National School, Quigg worked on the Macnaghten estate at Dunderave. He was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force and commanded the Bushmills Volunteers in 1913.

==First World War==
Shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, members of the Ulster Volunteer Force were urged to join the British Army to form an infantry division. Quigg enlisted in the Royal Irish Rifles and was posted to its 12th Battalion (Mid-Antrim Volunteers) as a private. His platoon officer was Sir Edward Harry Macnaghten, of the Macnaghten estate. The battalion formed part of the 36th (Ulster) Division, which departed for the Western Front in October 1915.

The 36th Division was stationed near Thiepval Wood from March 1916 and would be involved in the forthcoming Battle of the Somme, for which it was tasked with advancing to Grandcourt. On 1 July, the opening day of the Battle of the Somme, Quigg&#x27;s unit, starting from the village of Hamel, located on the north bank of the River Ancre, advanced towards the German lines. As it did so, the Irish soldiers encountered severe machine-gun and shell fire from the Germans. Quigg&#x27;s platoon had to retreat on three occasions, beaten back by German fire. The final assault in the evening of 1 July left numerous soldiers of the 12th Battalion dead or wounded in &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot;. When he became aware the next morning that Macnaghten, his platoon commander, was missing, Quigg volunteered to go out and to try to locate him. He made seven trips into &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot;, bringing back wounded soldiers each time. However, he was unable to locate Macnaghten, whose body was never recovered. Macnaghten is commemorated on the Thiepval Memorial.

For his actions, Quigg was recommended for the Victoria Cross (VC). The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for gallantry that could be bestowed on a serviceman of the armed forces of the British Empire.The citation, published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; read:

Quigg was presented with his VC by King George V at York Cottage, in Sandringham. When he returned to Bushmills after the VC investiture, there was a large turn out to welcome him home. Lady Macnaghten presented Quigg with a gold watch in recognition of his bravery in attempting to find and rescue her son. Quigg, who was also awarded the Russian the Order of St. George (Fourth Class) in February 1917, returned to active duty and went on to serve in Mesopotamia and Egypt, ending the war as a sergeant.

==Later life==
He remained in the British Army after the war but as a result of injuries from a bad fall from a window in a soldier&#x27;s home in Belfast, retired from the army in 1926. He was then employed as a civilian at the Royal Ulster Rifles Depot in Armagh before, in 1934, starting work as a tour guide on the Giant&#x27;s Causeway. In 1953, he met the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II when she visited Ulster. He died on 14 May 1955 in Ballycastle. A lifelong member of the Church of Ireland, he was buried in Billy Parish Churchyard, with full military honours. He never married and was survived by his five siblings.

==Medals and legacy==

Quigg&#x27;s medals which, along with the VC and Order of St. George, also included the 1914–15 Star, the British War Medal, Victory Medal, General Service Medal, King George V Silver Jubilee Medal, George VI Coronation Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal are on display at the Royal Ulster Rifles Museum in the Cathedral Quarter, Belfast.

There are several memorials to him; his name is one of those listed on the memorial stone at the Thiepval Memorial for the VC recipients of the Ulster Division and he is also listed on the memorial tablet for the Royal Irish Rifles at St. Anne&#x27;s Cathedral at Belfast. A stone tablet dedicated to his memory sits at the foot of the Bushmills War Memorial. In late June 2016, Queen Elizabeth II, who remembered meeting Quigg in 1953, unveiled a statue of him in Bushmills. Shortly afterwards, an Ulster History Circle blue plaque naming Quigg was applied to the school building that he attended as a boy.

<text>Almonaster Avenue is a four-lane divided road in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States, named after 18th-century Spanish philanthropist Don Andres Almonaster y Rojas. It forms in the residential neighborhoods of the Upper Ninth Ward by branching off at a Y-type intersection with Franklin Avenue. Shortly afterwards, the road elevates on an overpass to cross the Norfolk Southern Railway and returns to ground level as it crosses the Industrial Canal on the Almonaster Avenue Bridge, a bascule bridge that it shares with CSX Transportation, proceeding into New Orleans East. The traffic lanes straddle the railroad bridge on either side; this is the only location where Almonaster becomes a two-lane road, albeit divided. It is also the last of the combination railroad/automobile movable bridges. It winds through the New Orleans Business and Industrial District (NO BID) parallel with the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet and Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. It intersects with Interstate 510 before finally ending at the junction with U.S. Highway 90.

<text>General Sir Harry North Dalrymple Prendergast, (15 October 1834 – 24 July 1913) was a British military officer who served with the Madras Army and the Indian Army. He was a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to members of British and, in imperial times, Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Prendergast was the son of Thomas Prendergast and Caroline Lucy (née Dalrymple). He was educated at Cheam School and then Brighton College and, in later years, was President of their old boys&#x27; association. He also attended Addiscombe Military Seminary and the Royal School of Military Engineering. He was commissioned in the Madras Engineers of the Madras Army in 1854, serving in the Persian War before returning to India in 1857.

==Victoria Cross action==
Prendergast was 23 years old and a lieutenant in the Madras Sappers, Madras Army during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 when the following deeds took place for which he was awarded the VC:
He received his VC from Queen Victoria at the Quadrangle of Windsor Castle on 4 January 1860 along with twenty-four other recipients of the decoration.

==Later service==
Towards the end of the Indian Rebellion, Prendergast served in the Central Indian campaign, and was invalided home in April 1858 after a serious wound permanently disabled his left arm. He however continued to serve in the Indian Army, and in 1867 was appointed field engineer to the Abyssinian War (1867–68), after which he was promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel. In 1878 he commanded the Indian engineers sent to Malta and Cyprus at the time of the Congress of Berlin, followed by a number of posts within India. He was promoted major-general in April 1883.

Although only a relatively junior general officer, in October 1885 Prendergast was selected to lead the Burma Field Force in the Third Anglo-Burmese War. He achieved initial success, with Mandalay occupied on 29 November 1885, and was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in recognition. However, with limited resources at his disposal, the subsequent Burmese insurgency campaign went less well, damaging Prendergast&#x27;s reputation. Although promoted lieutenant-general (1886) and general (1887), he was offered no further senior commands, and he retired in 1892.

In retirement, Prendergast was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list, and was invested by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 8 August 1902. In 1908 he was appointed Colonel-Commandant of the Royal Engineers.

He died aged 78 at Heron Court, Richmond, Surrey, now in London, on 24 July 1913 and is buried in Richmond Cemetery.

His recreations were listed as &quot;boxing, fencing, sword-play, running, cricket, football, hunting and polo&quot;.

There is a bronze memorial tablet to him in Brighton College Chapel, but his sword that used to hang above it was stolen.

==Family==
Prendergast was married to Emilie Rachael, and had several children:
*George William Yelverton Prendergast (ca. 1871–1903; second son), who served in the diplomatic service from 1896. He was British Vice-Consul at Scutari, Albania from May 1901, and for several months acted as Chargé d&#x27;affaires at Cetinje. He died at Menton, Alpes-Maritimes on 6 January 1903 aged 31.
*Ella Prendergast, who married in 1913 General Sir Harry Aubrey de Vere Maclean

==The medal==
In the 1980s the medal, on loan from the Prendergast family to the National Army Museum was suggested to be a copy. However, a subsequent 2020 study of its metal composition demonstrated it was an unusually close match to other Victoria Crosses, and in particular those dated to the same year, suggesting it was in fact genuine. The medal is currently displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum in Chatham, England.
