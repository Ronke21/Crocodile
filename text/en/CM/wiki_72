<text>The 1988 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1988 season. The 85th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Oakland Athletics and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers, with the Dodgers upsetting the heavily favored Athletics to win the Series in five games to win their sixth championship.

The series is best known for the Game 1 pinch-hit walk-off home run by star Dodgers outfielder Kirk Gibson, who did not start because of injuries to both legs yet hit the winning homer against Athletics closer Dennis Eckersley. Although Gibson&#x27;s homer has become an iconic World Series moment, it was World Series MVP Orel Hershiser who capped a dominant 1988 season in which he set the all time scoreless inning streak at 59 innings, recorded five straight shutouts, led the league with 23 wins and 267 innings, and won the Cy Young and Gold Glove awards. Hershiser was the NL Championship Series MVP, starting three games, getting the save for Game 4, and shutting out the Mets in Game 7. In the World Series, he shut out the A&#x27;s in Game 2, and pitched a two-run, complete game in the decisive Game 5 victory.

The Dodgers won the NL West division by seven games over the Cincinnati Reds, then upset the New York Mets, 4 games to 3, in the NLCS. The Athletics won the AL West division by 13 games over the Minnesota Twins, then swept the Boston Red Sox, 4 games to 0, in the AL Championship Series.

The Dodgers were the only MLB team to win more than one World Series title in the 1980s, as they had previously won the championship in 1981. Their victory also broke a 10-year streak in which 10 different major league ballclubs won a World Series with no repeat winners. They would not win another World Series until 2020.

==Preview==
===Los Angeles Dodgers===
The Dodgers&#x27; team batting did not finish in the top five in any offensive statistical category except batting average (fifth), at .248—no regular or backup hit over .300 or drove in over 90 runs. Kirk Gibson&#x27;s 25 home runs led the team but was only good enough for seventh in the National League. Slugger Pedro Guerrero had a sub-par year and was traded in July to the Cardinals for starting pitcher John Tudor. Kirk Gibson was the only Dodgers position player named to the All-Star Game, but declined the invitation.

However, the Dodgers were sixth in the NL in runs scored and backed that up with excellent pitching. Despite trading All-Star pitcher Bob Welch (to Oakland, ironically) prior to spring training and an injury to Fernando Valenzuela (5–8, 4.24 ERA), the Dodgers were second in the NL in team ERA and runs allowed, and led the league in complete games and shutouts. The staff was anchored by Cy Young Award-winner Orel Hershiser, who led league in wins, won-loss percentage (23–8, .864), complete games (15), shutouts (8), and sacrifice hits (19).

Hershiser was backed-up by a pair of Tims, Tim Leary (17–11, 2.91) and rookie Tim Belcher (12–6, 2.91), and the July acquisition of John Tudor further strengthened the staff. The bullpen was outstanding, headed by Jay Howell (21 saves, 2.08), Alejandro Peña (12 saves, 1.91), Brian Holton, and longtime New York Mets closer Jesse Orosco. The Dodger bullpen led the league in saves with 49.

It was intensity and fortitude, however, that defined the 1988 Dodgers, a trend that began when Kirk Gibson was signed as a free agent over the winter from the Detroit Tigers, the team he helped lead to the 1984 World Championship. Moreover, the invincible Hershiser threw shutouts in five of his last six regular season starts en route to a record 59 consecutive scoreless innings pitched, breaking the mark held by former Dodger great Don Drysdale. Hershiser would dominate the Mets in the NLCS, while Gibson hobbled through on bad knees and a bruised hamstring but would produce a memorable, if not the greatest, at-bat (in Game 1) of the World Series. Coincidentally, this was the second time the Dodgers had a no-hitter or a perfect game thrown against them in a season ending with a world championship. In 1981, Nolan Ryan tossed his record-breaking fifth no hitter (breaking the mark of four set by Ex-Dodger pitcher Sandy Koufax) against a Dodger team that won the World Series. While in 1988, Tom Browning of the Cincinnati Reds threw a perfect game which was also against a Los Angeles team that won it all.

===Oakland Athletics===
The powerful Oakland Athletics had all the confidence and swagger of a heavily favored team. The &quot;Bash Brothers&quot; duo of Mark McGwire (32 home runs, 99 RBI, .260 batting average) and José Canseco (42 home runs, 124 RBI, .307 batting average) were in their early 20s, emerging as young superstars. Canseco became the first player to hit 40 or more home runs and steal 40 or more bases in Major League history and would capture the Most Valuable Player award in the American League. Veterans Dave Henderson (24 home runs, 94 RBI, .304 batting average) and longtime Pirate Dave Parker (12 home runs, 55 RBI, .257 batting average), also contributed with both their bats and their experience. The 1988 World Series marked Don Baylor&#x27;s third consecutive World Series with three separate teams. Besides being a member of the 1988 Athletics, Baylor was also a member of the 1986 Boston Red Sox and 1987 Minnesota Twins.

The Oakland pitching staff was quite possibly the best in the American League in 1988. They led in ERA (3.44), wins (104), saves (64), and were second in strikeouts (983) and second in fewest runs allowed and home runs allowed. The ace of the staff was Dave Stewart, an ex-Dodger (1978–83), who won 20 games for the second straight season. Another ex-Dodger was reliable Bob Welch (17–9, 3.64) followed by 16-game winner Storm Davis. After spending the previous 12 years as a starter, mostly for the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs, Dennis Eckersley would be converted into a closer in 1987 and would lead the American League in saves in 1988 with 45. He would eventually have a distinguished 24-year career, gaining election into the Hall of Fame in 2004. Another longtime starter (and another ex-Dodger), Rick Honeycutt, proved to be a capable set-up man to Eckersley, finishing with three wins and seven saves.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===


With Kirk Gibson unable to start and officially listed as day-to-day due to a pulled left hamstring and a severely swollen right knee, sustained on awkward slides into second base in the NLCS in Games 5 and 7, the Dodgers were at a disadvantage. Additionally, because ace Orel Hershiser pitched in Game 7 of the NLCS, the Dodgers started rookie Tim Belcher in Game 1, and would be unable to start Hershiser three times in a potential seven-game series as they had in the NLCS. Meanwhile, Oakland, having swept the ALCS, sent a well-rested Dave Stewart to the mound. Both pitchers, however, would have their troubles in this game. Belcher loaded the bases in the first by giving up a single to Dave Henderson, hitting José Canseco, and walking Mark McGwire. Canseco was hit in the right biceps as he checked his swing and home plate umpire Doug Harvey awarded him first base. Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda disputed this, thinking the ball hit Canseco&#x27;s bat. Audio from the game seemed to confirm this, but replays showed the ball hit Canseco in the biceps.

Stewart&#x27;s problems began in the bottom of the first when he purposely hit Steve Sax with his first pitch. After retiring Franklin Stubbs, Stewart balked Sax to second. Mickey Hatcher, Gibson&#x27;s replacement who had hit only one homer all season, shocked the crowd by hitting a two-run shot off Stewart. Hatcher further excited the Dodger Stadium fans by running full speed around the bases. Commentator Joe Garagiola noted, &quot;He ran in like they thought they were going to take it off the scoreboard! He really circled those bases in a hurry!&quot; and &quot;He&#x27;s a Saturday Evening Post cover!&quot;

Stewart calmed down and the A&#x27;s provided him a lead in their half of the second. After allowing a leadoff single to Glenn Hubbard and striking out Walt Weiss, Belcher&#x27;s control problems continued as he walked both Stewart and Carney Lansford to load the bases. After Dave Henderson struck out, Canseco crushed a 1–0 pitch for a grand slam to almost dead center, denting an NBC game camera in the process and giving the A&#x27;s a 4–2 lead. Canseco&#x27;s grand slam in Game 1 was his only hit of the series. His fellow Bash Brother Mark McGwire had only one hit as well: the game-winning shot that ended Game 3.

With one out in the sixth, the Dodgers broke Stewart&#x27;s groove with three consecutive singles by Mike Marshall, John Shelby, and Mike Scioscia; Marshall scored. Stewart retired the next two batters to end the inning and strand Shelby in scoring position, but the Dodgers had cut the A&#x27;s lead to 4–3.

Unknown to the fans and media at the time, Kirk Gibson was watching the game on television while undergoing physical therapy in the Dodger clubhouse. At some point during the game, television cameras scanned the Dodger dugout and commentator Vin Scully, working for NBC for the 1988 postseason, observed that Gibson was &quot;nowhere to be found&quot;. This spurred Gibson to call for Mitch Poole, the team ball boy, to set up the tee for him to take some warmup swings. After a few swings, Gibson told Poole to go get Lasorda for an evaluation; Lasorda presently appeared. Shortly thereafter, Gibson was seen in the dugout wearing his batting helmet. Along the way, NBC&#x27;s Bob Costas could hear Gibson&#x27;s agonized-sounding grunts after every hit.

A&#x27;s closer Dennis Eckersley came on to pitch the ninth to close it out for Stewart. After retiring the first two batters (Mike Scioscia and Jeff Hamilton), Eckersley&#x27;s former A&#x27;s teammate Mike Davis, batting for Alfredo Griffin, walked on five pitches. During Davis&#x27; at-bat, Dave Anderson initially entered the on-deck circle to hit for Alejandro Peña. Eckersley pitched carefully to Davis because the A&#x27;s remembered the home runs he hit for the A&#x27;s a year earlier, not—as popularly believed—because the light-hitting Anderson was on deck. After Davis walked, Lasorda called back Anderson and sent a hobbled Kirk Gibson to the plate, amid cheers from the Dodger Stadium crowd. Gibson bravely fouled off Eckersley&#x27;s best offerings, demonstrating how badly he was hurting. On one foul, Gibson hobbled towards first and prompted Scully to quip, &quot;And it had to be an effort to run THAT far.&quot; After Gibson fouled off several pitches, Davis stole second on ball three. On the next pitch, the eighth of the at-bat, Gibson slammed a backdoor slider into the right-field bleachers to win the game. The footage of Gibson hobbling around the bases on both hurt legs and pumping his fist as he rounded second became an iconic baseball film highlight.

Gibson would never bat again in the Series, and his walk-off homer in Game 1 marked the first World Series game ended with a come-from-behind home run. In a somewhat forgotten detail highlighting the teamwork that was this Dodgers team&#x27;s trademark, Gibson&#x27;s heroics would not have been possible without the earlier home run by the man who replaced Gibson in the lineup, Mickey Hatcher.

By the time Kirk Gibson reached his locker after Game 1, bullpen coach Mark Cresse had written &quot;R. HOBBS&quot; on a piece of paper and taped it over Gibson&#x27;s nameplate, alluding to the walkoff homer by the fictional slugger played by Robert Redford in &quot;The Natural&quot;. Indeed, the next night, NBC replayed the home run, intercutting it with film and music of the Hobbs home run from the movie.

Game 1 is the only game in World Series history in which a grand slam-hitting team failed to both win the game and the series. (In 1956, the Yankees hit a grand slam and lost Game 2 but prevailed in the series.)

Gibson became the second player to record a walk-off hit with two outs and his team trailing in the bottom of the ninth inning of a World Series game, following Cookie Lavagetto in the 1947 World Series. Only one other player, Brett Phillips in the 2020 World Series, has since accomplished this feat. This was the last Game 1 walk-off home run until 2023. Freddie Freeman would accomplish part of this feat in the 2024 World Series, but his walk-off came during extra innings.

===Game 2===
With a rested Orel Hershiser on the mound, the Dodgers took a 2–0 Series lead. Hershiser went the distance, allowing only three singles, all three hit by Dave Parker. The Dodgers got to Oakland starter Storm Davis with a five-run third. After one-out singles by Hershiser and Steve Sax, consecutive RBI singles by Franklin Stubbs and Mickey Hatcher made it 2–0 Dodgers before Mike Marshall capped the scoring with a three-run home run. Hershiser himself got an RBI when Alfredo Griffin singled in the fourth and scored on his double. Hershiser was the first pitcher to get three hits in a World Series game since Art Nehf of the New York Giants in Game 1 of the 1924 World Series. He was also the first pitcher to record a World Series RBI since Philadelphia&#x27;s John Denny in Game 4 of the 1983 World Series.

===Game 3===
The Athletics got back in the series on the strength of strong pitching by former Dodger World Series hero Bob Welch and three relievers. Dodger starter John Tudor left during the second inning with tightness in his pitching shoulder and was relieved by Tim Leary who pitched the next innings and Alejandro Peña who pitched an additional three innings.

Oakland struck first in the third when Glenn Hubbard singled, stole second, and came home on a single by Ron Hassey. The Dodgers tied it in the fifth when Franklin Stubbs drove home Jeff Hamilton with a double.

Oakland relievers helped squelch a Dodger threat in the sixth. Danny Heep led off with a double. John Shelby singled to left, but Heep was held up at third on the throw home as Shelby took second. Welch walked Mike Davis to load the bases, and left-hander Greg Cadaret was brought in to face lefty-hitting Mike Scioscia. Scioscia popped out to third. Oakland manager Tony La Russa then brought in right-hander Gene Nelson to face Hamilton, who forced Heep out at home. Alfredo Griffin grounded out to end the threat.

Reliever Rick Honeycutt held the Dodgers scoreless in two inning over work. The Athletics got their winning run in the bottom of the ninth when Mark McGwire deposited a one-out fastball from closer Jay Howell, who had struggled in the NLCS and also was suspended for illegally using pine tar, into the left-center field seats.

===Game 4===
Without injured sluggers Kirk Gibson (25 HR) and Mike Marshall (20), the Dodgers started the game with what was statistically one of the weakest hitting World Series teams since the Dead-ball era. During the regular season the Game 4 starting line up of Steve Sax (2B), Franklin Stubbs (1B), Mickey Hatcher (LF), Mike Davis (RF), John Shelby (CF), Danny Heep (DH), Jeff Hamilton (3B), Mike Scioscia (C) and Alfredo Griffin (SS) combined for a total of just 36 home runs. Only one player had even ten home runs of the group (Shelby). Between them, José Canseco and Mark McGwire had hit 74 home runs for Oakland. Canseco alone had in fact hit more home runs (42) than the Dodger lineup while McGwire with 32 almost matched the Dodgers.

The Dodgers got two runs in the first when Steve Sax walked, went to third on a Mickey Hatcher single, and scored on a passed ball by Athletics catcher Terry Steinbach. Hatcher scored the second run on a groundout by John Shelby. Oakland got one back in their half when Luis Polonia led off with a single, went to second on a passed ball, and later scored on a José Canseco groundout.

Los Angeles went up 3–1 when Franklin Stubbs doubled and scored when Oakland shortstop Walt Weiss couldn&#x27;t field a liner by Mike Davis (the play was ruled an error.) The Athletics answered in the sixth on an RBI single by Carney Lansford.

A key play came when the Dodgers got their final run in the seventh. With Alfredo Griffin on third and Steve Sax on first with one out, pinch-hitter Tracy Woodson hit what looked to be an inning ending double play grounder. But Lasorda called for a hit and run play so Sax was going on the pitch. Oakland tried for the double play, but Sax barely beat the throw to second. So when the throw to first beat Woodson, it was only the second out, allowing Griffin to score.

The Oakland half of the seventh was also dramatic. With one out, Weiss singled and reached second when he was called safe on a double-play grounder hit by Polonia in a similar play to the Dodgers&#x27; scoring play in the top half of the inning; Weiss was running with the pitch. Dave Henderson cut the Dodger lead to 4–3 on a two-out RBI double. After Dodgers reliever Jay Howell entered the game, José Canseco walked and Dave Parker reached on a Griffin error to load the bases, but Game 3 hero Mark McGwire popped out, stranding three and ending the inning.

The Athletics managed to get singles in the eighth by Ron Hassey and in the ninth by Henderson, but Howell rebounded from his earlier postseason woes to stop both rallies, including striking out Canseco and inducing a foul pop out by Dave Parker in the ninth to strand the tying run at first and end the game. The Dodgers now held a commanding three games to one lead.

While hosting Game 4 on NBC, Bob Costas angered many members of the Dodgers (especially manager Tommy Lasorda) by commenting before the start of the game that the Dodgers quite possibly were about to put up the weakest-hitting lineup in World Series history. That comment ironically fired up the competitive spirit of the Dodgers. Later (while being interviewed by NBC&#x27;s Marv Albert), after the Dodgers had won Game 4, Lasorda sarcastically suggested that the MVP of the 1988 World Series should be Bob Costas.

===Game 5===
Orel Hershiser capped one of the greatest seasons ever by a starting pitcher and one of the most improbable World Series wins in history by pitching a complete game, allowing only four hits, two runs, and striking out nine. Stan Javier had both RBIs with a single and a sac fly.

In addition to Hershiser&#x27;s performance, the Dodgers won because Mickey Hatcher stepped in for the hobbled Kirk Gibson in left field and provided spark, enthusiasm, and unexpected offense. He blasted his second home run in the Series off Oakland starter Storm Davis, a two-run shot, in the first inning; he had hit only one home run in the entire 1988 regular season.

Mike Davis, a disappointing free-agent signing for most of the 1988 season, added a two-run blast (on a 3-0 count) in the fourth off Davis, and former World Series MVP Rick Dempsey, filling in for an injured Mike Scioscia, drove in Davis with an RBI double in the sixth.

The only drama of the game briefly arose in the 8th inning: after Javier&#x27;s single brought the lead to 5–2, Hershiser walked Dave Henderson to bring the tying run to the plate in the form of 42-homer man José Canseco. Hershiser got him to pop out, and struck out Dave Parker to end the threat. He struck out Tony Phillips for the final out to give the Dodgers their first World Championship since 1981.

Oakland came into the World Series heavily favored, but the Dodgers out-hit (41–28, .246–.177), out-muscled (5 HRs–2 HRs), and out-pitched (2.03–3.92) the seemingly unbeatable Oakland Athletics, improbably winning the Series in five games, outscoring the A&#x27;s, 21–11, bringing the Dodgers their sixth World Series Championship, the second as a manager for Tommy Lasorda. The Dodger pitching tamed Oakland monsters José Canseco (one hit, his grand slam in Game 1) and Mark McGwire (one hit and one RBI, which came on his Game 3 walk-off home run) for the entire series.

The Dodgers became the first (and so far only) team to have a perfect game pitched against them and win a World Series in the same season. Tom Browning of the Cincinnati Reds pitched that perfect game on September 16, 1988.

With the Lakers winning their fifth NBA championship in nine years four months before, the Dodgers winning the World Series made Los Angeles the first city to have both NBA and World Series champions in the same year. This accomplishment would be repeated in 2020, with the same two teams winning their respective championships again.

==Composite line score==
1988 World Series (4–1): Los Angeles Dodgers (N.L.) over Oakland Athletics (A.L.)
==Television and radio coverage==
The 1988 World Series marked the last time that NBC would televise a World Series for seven years. Beginning in 1990, NBC would be shut out of Major League Baseball coverage completely, after CBS signed a four-year, exclusive television contract. After splitting coverage of the 1995 World Series with ABC, NBC would next cover a World Series exclusively in 1997 and again in 1999. Beginning the following year, the fall classic would air exclusively on Fox (they had previously broadcast the 1996 and 1998 editions) where it has remained ever since.

Longtime Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully called the Series for NBC along with Joe Garagiola; this was the last World Series that Scully would call on television (although he would subsequently call several more on CBS Radio). It was also the final World Series broadcast on either medium, and the final NBC telecast, for Garagiola. When the network returned from a commercial break at the start of the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 1, Scully stated (as NBC&#x27;s cameras were panning the Dodgers&#x27; dugout) that Gibson (who wasn&#x27;t in the dugout at the time) wouldn&#x27;t play for sure. According to Gibson, who was watching the telecast in the Dodgers&#x27; clubhouse as the game started, Scully&#x27;s comments in large part influenced his decision to want to bat.

As previously mentioned, Bob Costas, who along with Marv Albert, hosted NBC&#x27;s World Series pregame coverage and handled postgame interviews made on-air statements that enraged many in the Dodgers&#x27; clubhouse (especially manager Tommy Lasorda). Costas said that the 1988 Dodgers possibly had the weakest hitting line-up in World Series history. After the Dodgers won Game 4, Lasorda (during a postgame interview with Marv Albert) sarcastically said that the MVP of the World Series should be Bob Costas.

On the radio side, Jack Buck and Bill White provided commentary for CBS Radio. This was Buck&#x27;s sixth World Series call for CBS Radio and White&#x27;s fifth. Game 5 was the final baseball broadcast for White, who had been calling games (primarily for the New York Yankees) since 1971; shortly after the Series ended he replaced Bart Giamatti as president of the National League.

The Series was also broadcast by the teams&#x27; local flagship radio stations using their own announcers. In the San Francisco Bay Area, KSFO aired the games with Bill King and Lon Simmons announcing, while in Los Angeles, KABC aired the games with Ross Porter (substituting for Scully) and Don Drysdale announcing.

===WMGT intrusion===

During the second inning of Game 1, NBC affiliate WMGT-TV in Macon, Georgia, had its on-air feed hijacked by an unidentified technician who formerly worked for the station&#x27;s video department. The video feed of the second inning was replaced by an unidentified black-and-white pornographic movie for ten seconds (which likely came from a subscription channel), while audio of Vin Scully was still presented throughout the incident. Following the investigation which led with authorities, the unidentified technician from WMGT was immediately fired from the station. The station&#x27;s production manager, L.A. Sturdivant, released a statement explaining that the broadcast intrusion was triggered by accident rather than deliberately planned, and was being &quot;treated as a serious matter.&quot;

After three days of investigation following the station&#x27;s wiring at the control panel being rewired, Sturdivant replied that the fired technician may have accidentally flipped the wrong switch, which caused the World Series broadcast to switch from NBC&#x27;s KU-Band signal over to the C-Band satellite signal that carried the X-rated material. During the final stages of investigating, local officials later put forth other theories that may led into the hijack such as a videotape having been brought into the studio and watched by the technician or deliberate sabotage from an outside prankster that would&#x27;ve explain the alternate case of the incident, but Sturdivant disagreed on its alternate theories.

==Aftermath==
This was the last World Series that Peter Ueberroth presided over as commissioner. Incidentally, Ueberroth rose to prominence for organizing the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles.

This would also be the last World Series to feature each league regular season Most Valuable Player until 2012.

Following this confrontation, both teams appeared on &quot;Family Feud&quot; with Ray Combs for a special sweeps week billed as a World Series Rematch.

1988 A&#x27;s reliever Rick Honeycutt would later serve as the Dodgers pitching coach for 13 years (2006-2019). Honeycutt&#x27;s 14 years as the Dodgers pitching coach (under four different managers) tied Ron Perranoski for the longest tenure in that role in the organization&#x27;s history. A&#x27;s star outfielder and Los Angeles native Mark McGwire was also a Dodgers&#x27; hitting coach from 2013-2015. 

The Dodgers would not make another World Series appearance until 2017, where they would lose in seven games against the Houston Astros, who won their first World Series title. The Dodgers would make another World Series appearance the following year in 2018, but lost to the Boston Red Sox in five games, marking the first time the Dodgers lost back-to-back World Series since 1977 and 1978, where they lost both World Series to the New York Yankees. They would not win another World Series until 2020.

The A&#x27;s made it to the World Series the next two years, winning the 1989 &quot;Loma Prieta earthquake&quot; series 4-0 vs. the San Francisco Giants and being swept by the Cincinnati Reds 4–0 in 1990. The A&#x27;s haven&#x27;t appeared in the World Series since. The closest the A&#x27;s have gotten to the World Series since that time was in 1992, when they lost to the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League Championship Series in six games and 2006, when they lost to the Detroit Tigers in the ALCS in a four-game sweep.

Before the start of the 2018 season, the Dodgers commemorated the anniversary of Gibson&#x27;s homerun with the introduction of the “Kirk Gibson seat,” which is where his home run landed after winning Game 1 of the 1988 World Series. The seat in question was Section 302, Row D, Seat 1, though the Dodgers have renumbered that seat 88. The seat would be painted blue and signed by Gibson and the tickets cost $300, which includes a $200 donation to the Kirk Gibson Foundation to raise money and awareness for Parkinson’s Research.

In Game 4 of the 2018 World Series between the Dodgers and the Red Sox, 30 years after that 1988 World Series walk-off home run, Dennis Eckersley (who was there covering the Red Sox as a NESN color commentator and analyst) and Kirk Gibson reunited for the ceremonial first pitch at Dodger Stadium and Gibson had a bat ready before catching Eckersley&#x27;s pitch. In Game 3 of that series, Max Muncy would hit the Dodgers first walk-off World Series home run since Gibson&#x27;s in 1988 of Game 1.

The Dodgers World Series capped off a spectacular decade of sports for the city of Los Angeles. Los Angeles hosted the aforementioned mentioned 1984 Summer Olympics, its first since hosting the 1932 Summer Olympics. In terms of team sports, the Showtime Lakers won five NBA championships in the decade (including one in 1988, just a day under four months before the Dodgers victory), the Raiders moved from Oakland to Los Angeles and won the city&#x27;s first Super Bowl, and the Los Angeles Kings traded for Wayne Gretzky in August 1988, who was even at that time considered the greatest hockey player ever. For their part, the Dodgers were the only team to win more than one World Series in the 1980s. The next Los Angeles championship did not come until the 2000 Lakers. 32 years later in 2020, the Dodgers and Lakers would again win a World Series and NBA Finals in the same season.

This would be the final World Series Vin Scully called on either television or radio that featured the Los Angeles Dodgers. Scully would call World Series games on CBS radio until 1997. The next time the Dodgers advanced to the World Series (2017), Charley Steiner was now the radio play-by-play announcer and went on to call Los Angeles&#x27;s victory over Tampa Bay in 2020 (Scully had retired from broadcasting after the 2016 season).

Freddie Freeman&#x27;s grand slam off the New York Yankees&#x27; Nestor Cortés Jr. to win Game 1 of the 2024 World Series for the Dodgers—the first walk-off grand slam in World Series history—was widely compared to Gibson&#x27;s home run. Like Gibson, Freeman was playing through injury (a badly sprained ankle in Freeman&#x27;s case), and both players also came to bat with the Dodgers trailing by a run and down to their last out in Game 1 of the World Series. Broadcaster Joe Davis&#x27; call on Fox&#x27;s national broadcast of &quot;...she is gone!&quot; echoed Scully&#x27;s call for the Gibson homer, and Davis also added, &quot;Gibby, meet Freddie!&quot; Both Gibson&#x27;s and Freeman&#x27;s home runs were to right field at Dodger Stadium, in almost the same spot, and both came at 8:37p.m. Pacific Time. Finally, just like 1988, the Dodgers would end up winning the series in 5 games.

<text>Herbert George Columbine VC (28 November 1893 – 22 March 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Columbine was 24 years old, and a private in the 9th Squadron, Machine Gun Corps, British Army during the First World War when the action for which he was awarded the VC took place.

On 22 March 1918 at Hervilly Wood, France, Private Columbine took over command of a Vickers gun and kept firing it from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. in an isolated position with no wire in front. During this time wave after wave of the enemy failed to get up to him, but at last with the help of a low-flying aircraft the enemy managed to gain a strong foothold in the trench. As the position was now untenable, Private Columbine told the two remaining men to get away, and although he was being bombed on either side, he kept his gun firing, inflicting losses, until he was killed by a bomb which blew him up along with his gun.

==Commemoration==
Columbine is named on the Pozières Memorial, in the Somme department of France, to the missing of the Fifth Army.

The Columbine Centre, a leisure and community centre in Walton-on-the-Naze, is named after him.

The Columbine Statue Fund was set up under the patronage of Dame Judi Dench to raise money for a statue to Columbine in Walton on the Naze. The statue, sculpted by John Doubleday, was erected on 1 August 2014 on the seafront at Walton on the Naze.

<text>Hugh Colvin VC (1 February 1887 – 16 September 1962) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was 30 years old, and a second Lieutenant in the 9th Battalion, The Cheshire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 20 September 1917 east of Ypres, Belgium, when all the other officers of his company and all but one in the leading company had become casualties, Second Lieutenant Colvin took command of both companies and led them forward under heavy fire with great success. He went with only two men to a dug-out, when he left the men on top, entered it alone and brought out 14 prisoners. He then proceeded to clear other dug-outs, alone or with only one man, capturing machine-guns, killing some of the enemy and taking a large number of prisoners.

After he retired from the Cheshire Regiment, he was appointed in 1938 as a recruitment officer in Dewsbury with the rank of major.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Cheshire Regiment Museum, Chester, England.

<text>Harold John Colley (26 May 1895 – 25 August 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
He was born at 60 Winson Street in the Soho district of Birmingham, England. The family moved to nearby Smethwick sometime prior to the 1911 Census, where they can be found at 74 Cheshire Road. This remained his home address during the First World War,

==Military career==
Colley was 24 years old, and an acting sergeant in the 10th Battalion, The Lancashire Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 25 August 1918 at Martinpuich, France, during a strong counter-attack Sergeant Colley&#x27;s company was holding an advanced position with two platoons in advance and two in support. The forward platoons were ordered to hold on at all costs and Sergeant Colley went, without orders, to help these two platoons. He rallied the men, then formed a defensive flank and held it, although out of the two platoons only three men remained unwounded and the sergeant himself was dangerously wounded and died the same day. It was entirely due to his action that the enemy was prevented from breaking through.

==Legacy==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Fusilier Museum, Bury, Lancashire. Colley is the subject of a bronze memorial plaque in the vestibule of Smethwick Council House, as well as being included in the list of names on the memorials at Bearwood Baptist Church and St. Mary&#x27;s Church - both in Bearwood. On 25 August 2018, the centenary of his death, a commemorative paving stone in his honour was unveiled in Smethwick.

<text>Major John Cook VC (28 August 1843 – 19 December 1879) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. An officer of the Bengal Staff Corps who transferred to the 5th Gurkha Rifles, Cook was a veteran of the Umbeyla Campaign who received the VC posthumously for his actions during the Second Anglo-Afghan War.

==Early life==
Born in Edinburgh, Cook was educated at Edinburgh Academy before attending the Scottish Naval and Military Academy in Edinburgh from 1856 to 1858, Dr Greig&#x27;s School in London from 1858 to 1859, and finally the Royal India Military College at Addiscombe from 1859 to 1860.

==Military career==
Cook sailed to India in late 1861 at the age of eighteen, joining the British Indian Army, Bengal Staff Corps as an ensign before being promoted lieutenant on 29 March 1862, and soon after his arrival was posted to the 3rd Sikh Infantry.

He was mentioned in despatches for his services in the Umbeyla Campaign in 1863, and also distinguished himself while serving as adjutant of his regiment in the Black Mountain campaign, Hazara Expedition of 1868 on the North West Frontier.

After being promoted captain on 19 December 1872, Cook transferred to the 5th Gurkha Rifles as wing commander in 1873.

On 24 September 1878 at the beginning of the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the 5th Gurkha Rifles were warned for active service, and in October proceeded from Abbottabad to Thal. Here it joined Sir Frederick Robert&#x27;s Kurram Valley Field Force. Cook crossed the frontier with his regiment as part of Brigadier-General Thelwall&#x27;s 2nd Brigade and following the reconnaissance of Peiwar Kotal Pass, won his Victoria Cross on the slopes of the Spingawai Kotal, or White Cow Pass. Captain Cook led repeated charges against enemy barricades with a joint force of 5th Gurkhas and 72nd Highlanders. At dawn, as the Afghans fled their positions, Cook collected a few men and charged and killed a large number of enemy who were trying to rescue one of their guns before going to the aide of Major Galbraith. Cook&#x27;s helmet was pierced by an enemy bullet.

===Gallantry recognized===
Just days after the action, Major Galbraith wrote to General Roberts a report dated &#x27;Camp near Zabbardast Kila, 5 December 1878:

==Victoria Cross==
He was 35 years old, and a captain in the Bengal Staff Corps, British Indian Army, and 5th Gurkha Rifles during the Second Anglo-Afghan War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:
He was promoted to the brevet rank of major on 22 November 1879 in recognition of his services during the Afghan Campaign.

==Death in action==
Cook was attached to Macpherson&#x27;s Brigade during the December 1879 Siege of the Sherpur Cantonment at Kabul. On 11 December, Cook participated in the attempt to attack the Afghans in the rear at Argundeh but – faced by overwhelming numbers – they were forced to fall back towards Sherpur. Late in the day, Cook distinguished himself in the rearguard action which saved the brigade&#x27;s baggage. He fought a determined throng of Afghans, and resorted to a bayonet charge which he led with his brother, Lieutenant Walter Cook, 3rd Sikhs, which forced the Afghans to withdraw. Unfortunately Walter Cook was shot in the chest and was carried wounded to the Sherpur Cantonment and John Cook received a head wound.

The next day, 12 December, John Cook was still able to take part in the attack on the That-i-Shah peak, which dominated the high ground around Kabul. During this action Major Cook received a fatal wound, being struck by a bullet that passed through the bone of his left leg below the knee. After spending the night on the hill in the open he was taken to the hospital at the besieged Sherpur, but died of wounds on 19 December 1879.

On 21 December 1879, Major John Cook was buried in the Sherpur Cantonment British Cemetery, locally known as the &#x27;Gora Kabar&#x27; which literally means &#x27;White Graveyard&#x27;. He was mentioned in despatches by Frederick Roberts on 23 January 1880.

==Medals and awards==
* Victoria Cross on 21 March 1879.
* Mentioned in Despatches in May 1880.
* India General Service Medal (1854–1895) with clasps &quot;North West Frontier&quot; and &quot;Umbeyla&quot;
* Afghanistan Medal (1878–1880) with clasps &quot;Peiwar Kotal&quot;, &quot;Charisia&quot; and &quot;Kabul&quot;

<text>John Connors VC (October 1830 – 29 January 1857) was born in Duagh, Listowel, County Kerry, Ireland and was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Connors was approximately 24 years old, and a private in the 3rd Regiment of Foot (later The East Kent Regiment (The Buffs)), British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 8 September 1855 at Sebastopol in the Crimea, Private Connors showed conspicuous gallantry at the assault on the Redan in personal conflict with the enemy. He rescued an officer of the 30th Regiment who was surrounded by Russians, by shooting one and bayoneting another.

==Further information==
He later achieved the rank of Corporal. He died at Corfu 29 January 1857.

There is some doubt as to whether Connors was ever awarded the medal before his death, or whether it reached his widow.

<text>William Connolly VC ( – 31 December 1891) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
William Connolly was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England c1816. No baptism record has been found for him, his birth details and the identity of his parents are unknown.

After working as a stableman, he enlisted as a soldier in the Honourable East India Company on 2 May 1837 at Liverpool. Later that year he sailed on the ship &quot;Exmouth&quot; to India to serve as a gunner in the Bengal Horse Artillery. He was given a medical discharge in 1859, at the age of 43 years, after 21 years and 3 months service, due to wounds received on 7 July 1857 at Jhelum during the Battle of Jhelum, British India during the Indian Mutiny. He was awarded the VC for his bravery at Jhelum. He was described as having an indifferent character. In physical appearance he was 5 feet 7 inches tall, he had brown hair, brown eyes and a fresh complexion. He returned home to England from India on the ship &quot;Alfred&quot;.

Back in Liverpool Connolly was now an army pensioner. He lodged with Thomas and Catherine Burrows at 124 Upper Mann Street Toxteth, Liverpool in 1861 and with the Dodd family at 40 Seacombe Street Everton, Liverpool in 1881. Catherine Burrows was formerly Catherine Connolly, so she was probably a relative. Thomas and Catherine were married on 17 December 1848 at St John The Baptist church in Toxteth. Catherine&#x27;s father, Michael Connolly, was a warehouseman. She was living in Mill Street Toxteth at the time of the marriage.

In 1883 he gave a testimonial that was used in an advertising campaign for a universal remedy called &quot;Eclectica&quot;:
He improved his financial standing by selling his VC at auction in 1886 for £10. This was bought by Charles Winter, the newly appointed head of the Medal Department at Spink. The first sale at auction of a VC was in 1884. Towards the end of his life he lived in Great Homer Street Everton and had a deposit at Great Homer Street Post Office Savings Bank. He died on 31 December 1891 of bronchitis at the Johnson family&#x27;s residence at 14 Westminster Road Kirkdale, Liverpool. He was 75 years old. Mrs Johnson&#x27;s daughter, Emma Catterall, was present at his death and informed the Kirkdale Registrar, Robert Henry Webster, the next day. He was buried on 4 January 1892 in Section CE 17 Grave 220 at Kirkdale Cemetery. The mode of burial was &#x27;Public&#x27; so the grave was unmarked. Most people were buried in &#x27;Public&#x27; graves in those days. He made provision for his own funeral in his will and left £37 12s to his friend and doctor, Thomas Hill, of 6 Westminster Road. The solicitor involved in the probate was William Henry Quilliam.

Most biographies of Connolly make no reference to his will and wrongly assume he died in poverty. Some authors suggest that William Connelly, labourer, aged 73 years, residing at Walton Workhouse in 1891 was William Connolly VC. This man was probably William Connell who died at Walton Workhouse aged 74 years and was buried at St Mary&#x27;s Bootle on 24 February 1893. Similar biographical content detailing Connolly&#x27;s supposed decline into poverty was given to the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; by local politicians when a plaque was unveiled on the grave at Kirkdale Cemetery in 2015. Prior to this event there was an appeal by Liverpool City Council for help in tracing any relatives of William Connolly. Researchers from &quot;Liverpool &amp; South West Lancashire Family History Society&quot; and &quot;RootsChat&quot; genealogy forums found out that Connolly had left a will. Information about the existence of a will was forwarded to the relevant person but unfortunately it was not followed up on. Correspondence sent to the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; revealed some of the contents of the will, highlighted mistakes in Connolly&#x27;s biography and was generally critical of previous accounts of Connolly&#x27;s life.

==Details==
Connolly was about 41 years old, and a gunner in the Bengal Horse Artillery during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 7 July 1857 at Jhelum, British India, for which he was awarded the VC:
==The medal==
Today, his medal is on public display in the British in India Museum in Nelson, Lancashire, England.

<text>John Psathas, (born Ioannis Psathas, ; 1966) is a New Zealand Greek composer. He has works in the repertoire of such high-profile musicians as Evelyn Glennie, Michael Houstoun, Michael Brecker, Joshua Redman and the New Juilliard Ensemble, and is one of New Zealand&#x27;s most frequently performed composers. He has established an international profile and receives regular commissions from organisations in New Zealand and overseas.

== Early life and education ==
The son of Greek immigrant parents, Psathas grew up in Taumarunui and then Napier. He attended Napier Boys&#x27; High School and left early to study composition and piano at Victoria University of Wellington. He supported himself as a student partly by playing up to nine gigs a week in a jazz trio. Psathas studied further with composer Jacqueline Fontyn in Belgium before returning to New Zealand, where he has since lectured in music at Victoria University and continued to fulfill a busy schedule of commissions.

== Compositions and collaborations ==

Early success came with &quot;Matre&#x27;s Dance&quot; in 1991, an energetic duet for percussion and piano since taken up and championed by percussionist Evelyn Glennie. This work and &quot;Drum Dances&quot; have become part of the standard repertoire for percussionists around the world. Psathas&#x27; collaboration with Evelyn Glennie has been long-standing and produced many commissioned works, including the 2001 double concerto for piano and percussion &quot;View From Olympus&quot;. Glennie has also released recordings of many of his works.

A highlight of 2000 was the premiere of the saxophone concerto &quot;Omnifenix&quot; at an outdoor concert before an audience of 8000 people at the 2 Agosto Festival in Bologna, Italy. This work was tailored to the particular improvising talents of tenor saxophonist Michael Brecker.

== Influences ==

His musical style brings together the languages of jazz, classical, Eastern European and Middle Eastern, avant-garde, rock, and electronica.

A retrospective concert of Psathas&#x27; chamber music was given in the 2000 New Zealand International Festival of the Arts, culminating with the premiere of the specially commissioned &quot;Piano Quintet&quot;. In the programme to the concert, he described the process of creating his music:

&quot;When I write music, it&#x27;s not a sense of inventing I experience, as much as it is a sense of finding something that exists at the remote periphery of what I know. It is like seeing things – that aren&#x27;t really there – in the corner of one&#x27;s eye, but not spinning around to view them, because then they would simply cease to be. It is a case of being aware of a thing in one&#x27;s peripheral vision and, while staring straight ahead, trying to decipher, without looking at it, the true nature of what it is. What one is finding is exactly the right thing for any given moment in a musical work.&quot;

== Career highlights ==

In 2000 his percussion works for the &quot;Rhythm Spike&quot; release gained him the Tui Award for Best Classical Recording at the New Zealand Music Awards. The double concerto &quot;View From Olympus&quot; for piano, percussion and orchestra was premiered at the Commonwealth Games in Manchester, performed by Evelyn Glennie, Philip Smith and the Halle Orchestra conducted by Mark Elder. This work was awarded the 2002 SOUNZ Contemporary Award, New Zealand&#x27;s major annual composition award. In 2003 a new CD of chamber works, &quot;Fragments&quot;, was released to critical acclaim and went on to win another Tui Award for Best Classical Album in 2004. He was named in 2003 as the recipient of one of five Arts Foundation of New Zealand Artist Laureate Awards, which carry cash prizes of $40,000.

In 2004 Psathas achieved the largest audience for New Zealand-composed music when billions heard his fanfares and other music at the opening and closing ceremonies of the Athens Olympics. This high-profile work was recognised in New Zealand&#x27;s 2005 New Year Honours by his appointment as an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit (ONZM). Additionally, his &quot;Three Psalms&quot; piano concerto, premiered by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and soloist Stephen Gosling, was awarded the 2004 SOUNZ Contemporary Award for excellence in composition.
Psathas won his third Best Classical Album award in the 2007 New Zealand Music Awards, for &quot;View from Olympus&quot;.

In 2014 Psathas was awarded a Higher Doctorate of Music by Victoria University of Wellington for his substantial contribution to New Zealand music, and embarked on an ambitious international project as part of New Zealand&#x27;s WW100 programme to mark the centenary of World War I. The result of this two-year collaboration with film makers and 150 musicians from all over the world was &quot;No Mans Land&quot;, a multimedia work including film, live performance and pre-recorded musical score. It premiered at the 2016 New Zealand Festival of the Arts before being taken on an international tour. The work examines the journey and ultimate triumph of the human spirit, juxtaposed against and overcoming the futility and terrors of war.

In 2018 Psathas retired from his long university tenure to become a full-time freelance composer, and was granted the position of Emeritus Professor at the New Zealand School of Music. In 2020 he began a three-year Composer-in-Residence partnership with Orchestra Wellington.

<text>Jack Thomas Counter VC (3 November 1898 – 16 September 1970) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was 19 years old, and a private in the 1st Battalion, The King&#x27;s (Liverpool) Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 16 April 1918 near Boisleux-Saint-Marc, France, it was necessary for information to be obtained from the front line and the only way to get it was over ground with no cover and in full view of the enemy. A small party tried without success, followed by six men, singly, each one being killed in the attempt. Private Counter then volunteered and, going out under terrific fire, got through and returned with vital information which enabled his commanding officer to organise and launch the final successful counter-attack. Subsequently, he also carried five messages across the open under heavy artillery barrage to company headquarters.

Counter left the army in 1921 with the rank of corporal. His medal is on display at the Jersey Museum, Saint Helier.

<text>The 1998 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1998 season. The 94th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion New York Yankees and the National League (NL) champion San Diego Padres. The Yankees swept the Padres in four games to win their second World Series championship in three years and their 24th overall. Yankees third baseman Scott Brosius was named the World Series Most Valuable Player.

The Yankees advanced to the World Series by defeating the Texas Rangers in the AL Division Series, three games to zero, and then the Cleveland Indians in the AL Championship Series, four games to two. The Padres advanced to the series by defeating the Houston Astros in the NL Division Series, three games to one, and then the Atlanta Braves in the NL Championship Series, four games to two. It was the Yankees&#x27; second appearance in the World Series in three years, and San Diego&#x27;s second World Series appearance overall, their first since losing in .

This was officially the first World Series that Bud Selig presided over as Commissioner of Baseball, although he had presided over the Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy presentation at the end of the and 1997 World Series as the interim Commissioner. For the first time, the same city—San Diego—hosted both the final World Series game and the Super Bowl the same year; not only were they held in the same city, they were both also held in the same stadium, Qualcomm Stadium.

== Background ==
=== San Diego Padres ===

After winning their first National League pennant in 1984, the Padres fell into futility. Disagreements between then-manager Dick Williams and the Padres front office led to his dismissal in 1986. Following multiple consecutive seasons of missing the playoffs, friction between players, management, and front office personnel, and two ownership changes, the team&#x27;s fortunes changed when the club hired Bruce Bochy as their next manager in 1995. In his first season, he had turned around a club that had won only 40 games in 1994 (though the season was cut short by a players&#x27; strike) into a 70–74 team the following year. In 1996, the Padres finished with a 91–71 record winning the National League West, earning Bochy NL Manager of the Year honors. Though they were swept by the St. Louis Cardinals in that year&#x27;s National League Division Series. Despite taking a step back in 1997 in which they finished in last place with a record of 76-86, they would rebound the next year and finished with a franchise record 98–64 record in 1998. Key players such as Tony Gwynn (who was a part of the team&#x27;s 1984-pennant winning season), Greg Vaughn, and pitchers Andy Ashby, Trevor Hoffman (who saved 53 games that season and was a runner-up in Cy Young Award voting), and Kevin Brown all contributed heavily to San Diego&#x27;s success in 1998. Vaughn in particular drew notice for his home run count during the regular season as it compared to the counts of star sluggers Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa; Vaughn had 50 while McGwire and Sosa had 70 and 66, respectively.

The Padres entered the 1998 MLB Postseason as the #3 seed in the National League. They began their playoff run by defeating the second-seeded Houston Astros in the division series 3 games to 1, thanks to timely hitting from relatively unknown hitter Jim Leyritz, who hit 3 home runs in the NLDS alone (Leyritz had hit 4 homers in 62 games played during the regular season). In the championship series against the top-seeded Atlanta Braves, the Padres dismantled the &quot;Big Three&quot; lineup of the Braves consisting of John Smoltz, Tom Glavine, and Greg Maddux thanks to more timely hitting from the team&#x27;s lineup. The Padres defeated the Braves in the NLCS 4 games to 2, winning the franchise&#x27;s second pennant en route to the World Series.

=== New York Yankees ===

In contrast to the Padres, the Yankees entered the 1998 season with high expectations. Following their victory in the 1996 World Series, the Yankees regressed to second place in the AL East in 1997 and were dealt a stunning five-game defeat against the Cleveland Indians in the American League Division Series. During the 1997–98 offseason, the Yankees made multiple moves, most notably trading for Scott Brosius from the Oakland Athletics, Chuck Knoblauch from the Minnesota Twins, and purchasing the contract of Alfonso Soriano from Nippon Professional Baseball. Alongside these new acquisitions, the Yankees boasted a plethora of talent across numerous positions, both on offense and defense. The team&#x27;s &quot;Core Four&quot; of pitcher Andy Pettitte, shortstop Derek Jeter, catcher Jorge Posada, and closer Mariano Rivera, alongside other stars like pitchers David Cone and ace David Wells, and outfielders Paul O&#x27;Neill and Bernie Williams helped the Yankees reach new heights in 1998. Under third-year manager Joe Torre, the Yankees started the season with a 46–13 record and would never look back, carrying their momentum to a 114–48 regular season record by the start of the playoffs. The team&#x27;s 114 wins surpassed the American League record for wins in a season; the previous record was held by the 1954 Cleveland Indians, who won 111 games (though the Yankees&#x27; record has since been surpassed by the 2001 Seattle Mariners, who won 116 games).

The Yankees entered the 1998 postseason as the overall #1 seed. They swept the third-seeded Texas Rangers 3 games to 0 in the division series, thanks to solid pitching from Wells, Pettitte, Cone, and Rivera, holding the Rangers&#x27; offense to just one run in three games. In the championship series, the Yankees faced the second-seeded Cleveland Indians in a rematch of their 1997 division series faceoff. New York won Game 1, but suffered back-to-back losses that put the Indians ahead 2 games to 1, stunning many onlookers. However, the team redeemed itself by winning the last three games of the series, which included the series-clinching game at home to win the Yankees&#x27; second AL pennant in three years.

== Summary ==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===
In Game 1, Kevin Brown took the hill for the Padres while the Yankees sent ALCS MVP David Wells to start. The Yankees began the scoring in the second inning, when rookie Ricky Ledee laced a two-run double into the right field corner with the bases loaded. However, the Padres battered Wells hard, beginning in the third inning when Greg Vaughn homered to right-center with a man aboard tying the game up at two runs apiece. In the fifth inning, Tony Gwynn, who was not a power hitter, smashed a two-run shot off the facing of the upper deck (Gwynn&#x27;s first home run in postseason play), followed up immediately by Vaughn&#x27;s second dinger of the night. Trailing 5–2, Jorge Posada singled and Ledee walked with one out in the seventh for the Yankees, ending the night for Brown. Chuck Knoblauch homered off of Donne Wall to tie the game at five. After Derek Jeter singled, Mark Langston relieved Wall and after Paul O&#x27;Neill flied out, walked two to load the bases. A 2–2 count call by home plate umpire Rich Garcia would prove to be decisive. Langston&#x27;s pitch was shown to be borderline and Garcia called it a ball. On the next pitch, Tino Martinez sent a grand slam into the upper deck, giving the Yankees a 9–5 lead. The Padres would score one more run in the eighth off of Mariano Rivera with the run charged to Jeff Nelson, but Rivera then pitched a scoreless ninth as the Yankees won Game 1, 9–6.
===Game 2===
In Game 2, the Bombers would go up 2–0 in the Series thanks to a dreadful outing by San Diego starter Andy Ashby. Catcher Greg Meyers, starting for the first time in a month, was also ineffective. Chuck Knoblauch walked to lead off the first, stole second, and scored on third basemen Ken Caminiti&#x27;s throwing error to first on Paul O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s ground ball. After Bernie Williams grounded out, RBI singles by Chili Davis and Scott Brosius gave the Yankees a 3–0 lead. Next inning, Derek Jeter drove in Knoblauch with a single, then Williams&#x27;s home run made it 6–0 Yankees. They added to their lead in the fourth on Ricky Ledee&#x27;s RBI double. New York started Cuban import Orlando Hernández, who pitched four shutout innings before allowing a two-out triple to Chris Gomez in the fifth inning. Gomez scored on Quilvio Veras&#x27;s double to put the Padres on the board, but in the bottom of the inning, Jorge Posada&#x27;s two-run home run off of Brian Boehringer extended the Yankees&#x27; lead to 9–1. Mike Stanton relieved Hernandez in the eighth inning and allowed a leadoff double to Caminiti, who scored two outs later on Ruben Rivera&#x27;s double. After Carlos Hernandez singled, Jeff Nelson relieved Stanton and allowed an RBI single to Mark Sweeney before striking out Veras to end the inning. Nelson then pitched a perfect ninth as the Yankees 9–3 win gave them a 2–0 series lead.
===Game 3===
The Yankees sent David Cone to the mound to face former Yankee pitcher Sterling Hitchcock, the MVP of the NLCS. Cone and Hitchcock dueled for 5 1/2 shutout innings, with Cone holding the Padres hitless. That changed in the bottom of the sixth inning when Hitchcock himself led off the inning with a single off Cone, and Quilvio Veras walked. Tony Gwynn then shot a single down the line past Tino Martinez at first base to score Hitchcock and Paul O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s throw sailed into the dugout for an error, allowing Veras to score and Gwynn to advance to third. Gwynn then scored on Ken Caminiti&#x27;s sacrifice fly to the warning track to give San Diego a 3–0 lead. However, the Yanks immediately jumped on Hitchcock for two runs, beginning with a home run to left-center by Scott Brosius. The second run came in after Shane Spencer doubled, and Hitchcock was relieved by Joey Hamilton. Spencer then scored on an error by Ken Caminiti, but Hamilton escaped without further damage. In the eighth, Padres reliever Randy Myers walked O&#x27;Neill to open the inning, which prompted Padre manager Bruce Bochy to replace Myers with closer Trevor Hoffman, who had saved 53 games and was a future Hall of Famer. However, Hoffman blew the save when he walked Tino Martinez before Scott Brosius tagged a three-run blast over the fence in dead center. The Padres tried to rally. Veras doubled with one out off of Ramiro Mendoza, who was then relieved by Mariano Rivera. Rivera allowed a single to Gwynn and a deep sacrifice fly to Greg Vaughn to cut the lead to 5–4, but Caminiti struck out to end the inning. In the ninth, Rivera got two outs, but Padre catcher Carlos Hernandez singled and was controversially replaced by John Vander Wal (due to Vander Wal being an above-average pinch hitter and probably the best left on the Padre bench) as a pinch runner. Pinch hitter Mark Sweeney extended the inning with another single to advance Vander Wal to third. However, utility man Andy Sheets struck out to end the game.
===Game 4===
Andy Pettitte, who struggled throughout the regular season and had turned in a poor start in the ALCS, outdueled Kevin Brown in Game 4, throwing shutout innings. The Yankees scored their first run of the game in the sixth inning on Bernie Williams&#x27;s RBI groundout with runners on second and third, then added to their lead in the eighth on Scott Brosius&#x27;s based-loaded RBI single followed by Ricky Ledee&#x27;s sacrifice fly. That was all Brown allowed in eight solid innings, but it turned out not to be enough. In the bottom of the inning, however, the Padres were able to get two batters on base against Pettitte. Yankees reliever Jeff Nelson struck out Greg Vaughn; then Mariano Rivera was called upon. After Ken Caminiti reached with a single to load the bases, Rivera was able to get Jim Leyritz, known for his clutch postseason home runs, to fly out to end the threat. Rivera pitched a scoreless ninth inning to end the Series. Game 4 of the World Series would turn out to be the last postseason game played at Qualcomm Stadium.

==Broadcasting==
The television rights for the 1998 World Series went to Fox, as they had the rights to the World Series in even-numbered years under the television contract that was signed in 1996. Joe Buck once again provided the play-by-play, with Tim McCarver and Bob Brenly alongside him in the booth.

For the first time, ESPN Radio was the home of the World Series, having taken the national radio rights for Major League Baseball from CBS Radio. Jon Miller and Joe Morgan provided the coverage for the network.

==Series overview and aftermath==

===Yankees===
The series win brought the Yankees&#x27; franchise championship total to 24, tying the Montreal Canadiens for most championships won by a franchise in the four major North American professional sports leagues. They would break the Canadiens record the next year, sweeping the Braves in 4 games for their 25th title.

The 1998 Yankees are considered to be one of the top teams in baseball history. With the win, the Yankees posted an MLB record with the most overall wins in a single season in MLB history with 125 (including the postseason). The previous record for most overall wins in one season was 116, set by the World Series champion New York Mets. The sweep marked the first time the Yankees swept a World Series since when they swept the Philadelphia Phillies. They were also the first team to sweep a World Series since the Cincinnati Reds in .

This was the first time since that a team had won a World Series after having the best record in the regular season. It was also the first time since that a team won a World Series after posting at least 100 wins in the regular season.

On October 11, 2005, A&amp;E Home Video released &quot;The New York Yankees Fall Classic Collectors Edition (1996–2001)&quot; DVD set. Game 3 of the 1998 World Series is included in the set.

===Padres===

The loss made the Padres the first expansion team to lose two World Series, having lost in to the Detroit Tigers. As of 2023, the Padres are one of only two teams in Major League Baseball to win at least two league championships and never win the World Series, the other team being the Tampa Bay Rays.

Until 2020, Bruce Bochy was the only Padres player or manager to be on every Padres playoff team. Bochy, however, would go on to win three World Series titles as manager of the San Francisco Giants in 2010, 2012, and 2014 and then the Texas Rangers in 2023.

To date, this remains the most recent championship game or series a professional San Diego sports team has participated in, although San Diego State basketball did participate in the 2023 national championship game. The Padres&#x27; loss was also significant as it also assured that the city of San Diego&#x27;s sporting championship drought since 1963 would continue, which has become the longest streak of such futility for a city with at least one professional sports team.

The Padres would lose Kevin Brown in free agency to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Brown was the first baseball player to earn a $100 million contract. Brown was eventually traded from the Dodgers to the Yankees in 2004, where he stayed until his retirement in 2005.

<text>John Manson Craig, VC (5 March 1896 – 19 February 1970) was a British Army officer and Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Craig was 21 years old, and a second lieutenant in the 1/4th Battalion, The Royal Scots Fusiliers, British Army, attached to 1/5th Battalion during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 5 June 1917, an advanced post at Umbella Hills (southwest of Gaza) having been rushed by the enemy, Second Lieutenant Craig immediately organised a rescue party and after tracking the enemy back to his trenches, set his party to work removing the dead and wounded under heavy rifle and machine-gun fire. An NCO was wounded and a medical officer who went to his aid was also wounded. Second Lieutenant Craig went out at once and got the NCO under cover, but while taking the medical officer to shelter was himself wounded. Nevertheless, the rescue was effected, and he then scooped cover for the wounded, thus saving their lives.

Craig served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War.

<text>Major Herbert James (31 October 1887 – 15 August 1958) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Herbert James was born at 11 Ingleby Street in Ladywood, Birmingham. He was the son of Walter James and Emily James (née Danford). By the 1891 Census his family were living at 76 Three Shires Oak Road in Bearwood, Smethwick. He attended Bearwood Road Infants School and later went on to become a teacher there, and subsequently at Brasshouse Lane School.

James was 26 years old and a second lieutenant in the 4th Battalion, The Worcestershire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 28 June 1915 in the southern zone of Gallipoli, when the advance of part of the regiment had been checked, Second-Lieutenant James, from a neighbouring unit, gathered together a body of men and led them forward under heavy fire. He then returned, organised a second party and again advanced, putting fresh life into the attack. On 3 July he headed a party of bomb throwers up a Turkish communication trench and when all his party had been killed or wounded, he remained alone, under murderous fire and kept back the enemy until a barrier had been built behind him and the trench secured.

James returned home, after his award of the VC and received Civic receptions in both Birmingham and Smethwick. His family address, as of his visit in November 1915, was 141 Poplar Avenue in Edgbaston, Birmingham.

He later achieved the rank of major. His medals are on display at the Maryborough Military and Colonial Museum in Maryborough, Queensland, Australia.

Two memorials to James were unveiled in 2010. on 2 July a memorial stone was unveiled at the East Chapel in Kensal Green Cemetery, where he was cremated. On 12 November a plaque was unveiled at Bearwood Road School. This was presented to the school by Smethwick Heritage Centre.

<doc id="1218113" wikidata="Q7788594" url="?curid=1218113" title="Thomas Cooke (soldier, born 1881)">
<text>Thomas Cooke, VC (5 July 1881 – 25 July 1916) was a New Zealand-born soldier who served in the Australian Imperial Force during the First World War. He was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to personnel of British and Commonwealth forces.

Born in Kaikōura to English immigrants, Cooke became a carpenter after finishing school. He moved to Australia in 1912, taking his young family with him, and settled in Melbourne. He enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in February 1915 and, after completing his training, embarked for the Middle East. On arrival, he was posted to the 8th Battalion. Soon his battalion was serving in the Somme sector on the Western Front. Killed during the Battle of Pozières, he was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions in staying at his post in the face of a German attack.

==Early life==
Thomas Cooke was born in Kaikōura, New Zealand, on 5 July 1881, to Tom Cooke, an Englishman who was a carpenter, and his wife Caroline . One of at least three children, he was educated at Kaikōura District High School. His father later moved the family to Wellington where Cooke became a carpenter. He also played the cornet and was part of a military band. In 1902, he married Maud Elizabeth Elliott and the couple had three children, two girls and a boy. In June 1912, he moved his young family to Australia and settled in the suburb of Richmond, in Melbourne, where he worked as a builder.

==First World War==
In February 1915 Cooke enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) for service abroad in the First World War. He was posted to the 24th Battalion as a reinforcement upon completion of his training at Broadmeadows. He was initially engaged in clerical work and was also assigned to the regimental band. He embarked for the Middle East aboard HMAT &quot;Commonwealth&quot; in November and at this time was promoted to acting corporal. His assignment to the 24th Battalion proved relatively short-lived for at the time of his arrival in Egypt in February 1916, the AIF was undergoing a significant expansion and reorganisation. He was transferred to the 8th Battalion and reverted to his original rank of private.

The 8th Battalion, as part of the 2nd Infantry Brigade, 1st Australian Division, initially served in the Suez Canal zone before leaving Egypt on 26 March 1916. It arrived on the Western Front in April 1916 and was initially stationed in the Fleurbaix and then the Messines sectors. As part of the 1st Division, it moved to the Somme sector in mid-July for its role in the upcoming Somme Offensive. On 23 July, the battalion entered the Battle of Pozières as reinforcements for the 1st Infantry Brigade. Late in the evening it had advanced into Pozières and was established on the northern edges of the village. On 25 July the Australians were seeking to push their positions further north of Pozières. Cooke&#x27;s battalion advanced and made further ground but halted under a heavy bombardment. A German advance that threatened the Australian positions was observed. Cooke, operating a Lewis machine-gun, was sent forward with his team to stabilise an unsafe section of the line. He and his companions secured the area but were exposed to long range machine-gun fire which soon accounted for all but Cooke. Even after running out of ammunition, he continued to man his post in the face of a German counterattack. By the time reinforcements arrived at his position, he had been killed. A full strength Australian infantry battalion typically had around 1,000 personnel; when the 8th Battalion was withdrawn from the front lines two days later, it had incurred over 330 casualties.

Cooke was recommended for the Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions of 25 July. At the time, the VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest gallantry award that could be bestowed on a soldier of the British Empire. The award of the VC to Cooke was gazetted on 9 September 1916 and the citation read as follows:
Cooke&#x27;s wife was unaware of the award of the VC to her husband until reading of it in newspaper reports. The medal was eventually presented to her by Arthur Foljambe, the Governor-General of New Zealand, in a ceremony at Government House in Wellington on 31 January 1917. His wife, who had returned to Wellington at the time of Cooke&#x27;s enlistment in the AIF, later remarried. Cooke has no known grave site, but his name is recorded on the Villers-Bretonneux Memorial and also on the war memorial in Kaikōura, his town of birth.

==Medals and legacy==
As well as the VC, Cooke was entitled to the British War Medal and Victory Medal, both being campaign medals. These are displayed at the National Army Museum at Waiouru in New Zealand. A street in Canberra, Australia, is named for him and he is named on VC memorials in Canberra and Sydney. In 2010, a newly built barracks building at the Linton Military Camp was named for Cooke; several of his descendants were present at the opening ceremony.

<text>Frederick George Coppins (25 October 1889 – 20 March 1963) was a Canadian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and other Commonwealth forces. He was born in Charing, Kent, England and served with the Queen&#x27;s Own (Royal West Kent Regiment) prior to the outbreak of the First World War. He emigrated to Canada, settling in Winnipeg. He was living in Edmonton at the time of enlistment. He signed up to the 19th Alberta Dragoons.

==Details==
He was 28 years old, and a corporal in the 8th Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force during the Battle of Amiens when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 9 August 1918 at Hatchet Woods, near Amiens, France, Corporal Coppins&#x27; platoon came unexpectedly under fire of numerous machine-guns. It was not possible to advance or retire and there was no cover. Corporal Coppins, calling on four men to follow him, leapt forward in the face of intense machine-gun fire and rushed straight for the guns. The four men with him were killed and he was wounded, but going on alone, he killed the operator of the first gun and three of the crew and took four prisoners. Despite his wound, he then continued with his platoon to the final objective.

== Later life ==
After the war, he returned to Winnipeg. He enlisted as a special constable during the Winnipeg General Strike. Within hours of his appointment, he charged his horse into a gathering of strikers and was dragged off his horse and severely pummelled.

Coppins played a minor role in the 1930 film &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, as a German machine gunner.

A record shows his enlistment in World War II at Angel&#x27;s Camp Calaveras Co., California, aged 50, but it is unknown what role he played. 

He was living in California when he died. 

Coppins&#x27; medals are located in a collection at the Royal Winnipeg Rifles Museum, Winnipeg, Manitoba.

A paving stone commemorating Coppins was unveiled in Charing in 2018.

<text>The 1999 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1999 season. The 95th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the defending American League (AL) and World Series champion New York Yankees and the National League (NL) champion Atlanta Braves in a rematch of the 1996 World Series, in which the Yankees prevailed. The Yankees swept the 1999 Series in four games for their second consecutive title, third in four years, and 25th overall. It was the Yankees&#x27; third straight defeat of the Braves franchise in the Fall Classic (having beaten the Milwaukee Braves in the 1958 World Series in addition to their 1996 victory over the Atlanta Braves). Yankees closer Mariano Rivera was named the World Series Most Valuable Player. This was the second World Series after 1995 since the advent of the three-division era to feature both number-one seeds from the AL and NL, a phenomenon that has only occurred thrice since: in 2013; 2020; and 2024.

The Yankees advanced to the World Series by defeating the Texas Rangers in the AL Division Series, three games to zero, and then the Boston Red Sox in the AL Championship Series, four games to one. The Braves advanced to the series by defeating the Houston Astros in the NL Division Series, three games to one, and then the New York Mets in the NL Championship Series, four games to two. The 1999 Series is remembered for Chad Curtis&#x27;s walk-off home run in Game 3, which gave the Yankees a 6–5 victory, and Game 2&#x27;s infamous interview of Pete Rose by Jim Gray on NBC.

==Background==

This featured a rematch of the 1996 World Series. It would also be the last World Series until 2013 in which the two teams with the best regular-season records in their respective leagues would face off. Perhaps most significantly, it was the first World Series ever in which the competing teams had played each other in the regular season. The Braves won two of three games over the Yankees at Yankee Stadium from July 15 to 17. Although interleague play had begun in , neither of the two previous World Series saw a rematch from the regular season.

The 1999 World Series also feted the All-Century Team, featuring the greatest players of the 20th century as voted by both fans and sportswriters. One of the players on the All-Century Team, Yankees legend Joe DiMaggio, had died in March of that year, with the Yankees honoring him by wearing a black #5 on their sleeves.

==Summary==
==Matchups==
===Game 1===
The 1999 series opened with Greg Maddux facing Orlando Hernández in Game 1, becoming the latest a World Series has ever begun (October 23) beating the previous record by 2 days (1995 World Series, October 21). The Braves got on the board first in the series when Chipper Jones launched a home run down the right field line in the fourth inning. That would be the only hit that El Duque would allow through seven innings while striking out ten Atlanta batters. It would also be the only home run by the Braves in the series. Maddux had not originally been scheduled to start this game. Tom Glavine was the scheduled starter, but was scratched with a stomach virus the night before the game. Maddux--pitching on shorter rest than he was originally expected to have and with less than 24 hours&#x27; notice--had pitched scoreless three-hit ball through seven before tiring and running into major trouble in the eighth, which began when Scott Brosius singled for the third time in the game. Pinch hitter Darryl Strawberry walked and Chuck Knoblauch reached when Braves first baseman Brian Hunter mishandled his sacrifice bunt attempt. Maddux was still allowed to pitch to Derek Jeter, who stroked a single into left with the bases loaded driving in a run. With still nobody out and the bases juiced, Maddux was finally removed, but too late. Atlanta reliever John Rocker gave up a two-run single to Paul O&#x27;Neill through the right side making it 3–1 Yankees. Later in the inning, Rocker walked Jim Leyritz with the bases loaded to force home another run. All four runs were charged to Maddux, though two were unearned due to Hunter&#x27;s error. Mariano Rivera picked up the save to wrap up the 4–1 victory.
===Game 2===
Game 2 featured the presentation of the All-Century team and an explosion of Yankees runs off Atlanta starter Kevin Millwood. In the first inning, Knoblauch, Jeter, and O&#x27;Neill opened the game with singles with O&#x27;Neill driving in Knoblauch. After a double-play groundout, both Tino Martinez and Scott Brosius drove in a run with singles each to give the Yankees a 3–0 lead in the first. In the third, Bernie Williams and Martinez hit leadoff singles before the former scored on Ricky Ledee&#x27;s double. Terry Mulholland relieved starter Kevin Millwood and after getting two outs, shortstop Ozzie Guillén&#x27;s error on David Cone&#x27;s ground ball allowed Martinez to score. The Yankees added to their lead off of Mulholland on Martinez&#x27;s groundout that scored Jeter in the fourth, who led off the inning with a double, and Knoblauch&#x27;s single in the fifth that scored Brosius, who also doubled to lead off the inning. Cone shutout the Braves for seven innings while Ramiro Mendoza pitched a scoreless eighth, but in the ninth inning, allowed a leadoff single to Chipper Jones. After a two-out walk, Jones scored on Greg Myers&#x27;s single. Jeff Nelson relieved Mendoza and allowed an RBI double to Bret Boone before getting Otis Nixon to ground out to end the game and give the Yankees a 2-0 series lead. This was the last victory of a World Series Game 2 on the road until the Texas Rangers won Game 2 of the 2011 World Series in St. Louis, and the last time the road team won the first two games of the World Series until 2019 when the Washington Nationals accomplished the feat against the Houston Astros.

Golfer Payne Stewart, a good friend of Braves third baseman Chipper Jones, died between Games 2 and 3. Yankees right fielder Paul O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s father died a few hours before Game 4.
===Game 3===
Game 3 in New York matched up lefties Andy Pettitte and Tom Glavine, who had been scheduled to start Game 1 but was scratched and moved back to Game 3 due to a stomach virus. Pettitte was rocked early. Bret Boone drove in Gerald Williams with a RBI double in the first. The Yankees tied the game in bottom of the inning on Paul O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s RBI single, but in the third, Brian Jordan had an RBI single scoring Boone, and Jose Hernandez doubled in Jordan and Andruw Jones. In the fourth inning, Bret Boone doubled in Gerald Williams for a second time in the game to make the score 5–1. He then was called out trying to steal third. Replays appeared to show that he slid in just ahead of the tag, and this call likely cost the Braves a run, as Chipper Jones doubled two pitches later. Glavine was sharp through seven innings but gave up homers to Tino Martinez in the fifth and Chad Curtis in the 7th, trimming the Braves lead to 5–3. The Yankees bullpen was solid, holding the Braves scoreless after Pettitte left the game. For the second time in three games, manager Bobby Cox made the decision to count on a tiring starter to hold a lead in the 8th inning despite having a solid middle-relief core that had proven extremely reliable at holding late-inning leads throughout the season, and a closer who sometimes pitched two innings. Instead, Glavine surrendered a two-run homer to Knoblauch to tie up the game at 5–5. Video of serious conversation in the dugout the previous inning made clear that there had been significant question as to whether to leave Glavine in for that inning. Glavine later explained that, while he had only thrown 72 pitches, he felt like his body was tiring coming off the illness that sidelined him from his scheduled Game 1 start, and felt hesitant to go back out but said he would try for one more inning when there was continued indecision on the matter. Glavine would be replaced by John Rocker, but again too late. Rocker shut out the Yankees until he was relieved after the ninth. The score remained knotted until the bottom of the tenth when Chad Curtis blasted a walk-off home run—his second home run of the game—off Mike Remlinger, giving the Yankees a commanding 3–0 lead in the Series.
===Game 4===
Game 4 featured the presentation of the Roberto Clemente Award to Tony Gwynn, followed by a battle of hard-throwing Cy Young Award winners, Roger Clemens and John Smoltz. In the third inning, the Yanks broke through when Tino Martinez singled off Ryan Klesko&#x27;s foot with the bases loaded, driving in two runs. Jorge Posada followed with another RBI single, making the score 3–0. Clemens, seeking his first World Series victory, was outstanding, the only Braves scoring coming in the eighth when Boone singled in Walt Weiss. Jim Leyritz added another Yankees run with a shot in the eighth, adding to his legacy as a great postseason performer and as one of the thorns in the side of Braves fans. Rivera, who was named Series MVP, got Keith Lockhart to fly out to LF Curtis for the final out of the season.

The 1999 New York Yankees became the first team to win the World Series in consecutive sweeps since the 1938–1939 Yankees. It was the first sweep by a team without home-field advantage since when Baltimore swept the Dodgers. The Yankees&#x27; 11–1 postseason record was the best ever in the wild card era, which was later tied by the Chicago White Sox in (the 1976 Reds finished a perfect 7–0 in the postseason, which preceded the permanent introduction of the wild card and Division Series). The Yankees players were each paid $326,000 for this World Championship.

With the Yankees&#x27; sweep of the Braves, this was the second time in 1999 that a New York City team had swept a team from Atlanta out of a playoffs; the Knicks had swept the Hawks in the second round of the NBA Playoffs during their Cinderella run to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs. It would also mark the final time the Yankees clinched the championship at the old Yankee Stadium.

The powerhouse Braves batted just .200 in the 4-game Series. Despite this, John Smoltz later referred to this series as &quot;the closest four-game sweep you could ever have,&quot; given the fact that even with their anemic offensive showing, the Braves were still quite possibly two more prudent decisions on bullpen use away from a 2-1 lead after the first three games, with two starters blowing 8th inning leads despite very clearly visible situational red flags about their fitness to be left in the games that long.

With the game 4 victory, the Yankees claimed their record-breaking 25th World Championship in North American professional sports, surpassing the previous record of 24 set by the National Hockey League (NHL)&#x27;s Montreal Canadiens.

==Composite box==
1999 World Series (4–0): New York Yankees (A.L.) beat Atlanta Braves (N.L.).
==Aftermath==
In comparing the success of teams in the five major North American sports leagues, this series win brought the Yankees&#x27; World Series total to 25, putting them two titles ahead of the NHL Montreal Canadiens&#x27; 23 Stanley Cup victories for most championships (Montreal also won the Stanley Cup in 1916 as part of the National Hockey Association for a total of 24). 

This was the fifth and final World Series appearance in the 1990s for Atlanta, but the new decade would not be as favorable to them, the closest they got to returning to the World Series in the Bobby Cox era was in the 2001 NLCS where they lost to the eventual world champion Diamondbacks in five games (Cox stepped down as manager after the 2010 season). In total, the Braves went to the World Series five times under Cox in a nine season span and won the World Series once. Atlanta would reach the NLCS again in 2020 where they fell to eventual world champion Los Angeles Dodgers in 7 games after leading the series 3-1. The Braves would get their revenge on the Dodgers the next year by beating them in 6 games. The 1999 World Series was the Braves&#x27; last Fall Classic until 2021, where they won in 6 games over the Houston Astros. Game 2 also marks the second and final time that Turner Field hosted a World Series game.

The Yankees would continue their dynasty by defeating the New York Mets in the next year&#x27;s World Series. They won a fourth straight pennant in 2001, but lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks in that season&#x27;s World Series. They would reach the World Series again in 2003 (losing to the Florida Marlins), 2009 (defeating the defending champions, the Philadelphia Phillies) and 2024 (losing to the Los Angeles Dodgers).

On October 11, 2005, A&amp;E Home Video released the &quot;New York Yankees Fall Classic Collectors Edition (1996–2001)&quot; DVD set. Game 3 of the 1999 World Series is included in the set.

==Media coverage==
This was NBC&#x27;s 39th and most recent World Series telecast to date, as Fox aired the next World Series as part of the contract in place, and acquired the exclusive broadcast rights of Major League Baseball beginning in 2001. Bob Costas provided play-by-play while Joe Morgan served as analyst for the series. Hannah Storm served as pre-game host with then Cincinnati Reds shortstop Barry Larkin serving as the analyst. The field reporters were Jim Gray (Yankees dugout) and Craig Sager (Braves dugout) on loan from Turner Sports.

With the Knicks having played in the NBA Finals in June, this was the second championship series in 1999 that NBC broadcast involving teams from New York City. Bob Costas, Jim Gray, and Hannah Storm were involved both times: Costas with play-by-play, Gray as a reporter, and Storm as pre-game host. This was the most recent year that a city hosted both the NBA Finals and the World Series in the same year, until Cleveland did so in 2016.

Once again, ESPN Radio provided coverage of the World Series. Play-by-play man Jon Miller was joined in the booth by Rick Sutcliffe, who substituted for the unavailable Joe Morgan.

<text>William Cosgrove VC MSM (1 October 1888 – 14 July 1936) was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background==
William Cosgrove was born at Aghada, County Cork on 1 October 1888, the son of Michael and Mary Cosgrove. He had four brothers, Dan, Ned, David, Joseph and a sister Mary-Catherine. While they were still young their father emigrated to Australia, but later returned. In the meantime his wife moved with her children to a cottage in nearby Peafield, and the children attended school at the National School, Ballinrostig. William began work at as an apprentice butcher at Whitegate, and one of his daily chores was a morning delivery to Fort Carlisle (now Fort Davis) with a consignment of meat for the troops. It was from Fort Carlisle that he joined the army.

==First World War==
William Cosgrove enlisted in the Royal Munster Fusiliers on 24 March 1909 and was given the regimental number 8980. At the outbreak of war the 1st Battalion of the Munster Fusiliers was stationed in Rangoon, Burma, as regular battalions were routinely stationed overseas. They left Rangoon on 21 November 1914, and William Cosgrove (now Corporal) landed in England on 10 January 1915. Upon landing they still wore their Indian issue uniforms and stood on the cold quay in their khaki drill shorts. The battalion was then assigned to the 86th Brigade of the 29th Division (United Kingdom), in preparation for the landings at the Dardanelles.

===Gallipoli===
The 1st Munsters, together with the 1st Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers and Hampshire Regiment, were on the converted collier &#x27;River Clyde&#x27; when it ran ashore for the Cape Helles &#x27;V&#x27; beach landing on 25 April 1915 at 06.20 am. On departing from the ship&#x27;s bay they were subject to fierce enfilading machine gun fire from hidden Turkish defences. One hundred or more of the Battalion&#x27;s men fell at this stage of the battle, and those who managed to get ashore could not advance due to the withering Turkish fire. On the following day it was decided to destroy the wire entanglements facing the men, as the naval bombardment had failed to do so. It was during this attack that Corporal Cosgrove 1st RMF, performed the action that was to earn him the regiment&#x27;s first Victoria Cross of the war. The action was described by Cosgrove himself:

He was also wounded during this action. Promoted to Sergeant, he saw no further action due to his wound, which was a contributing factor in his death later on.

===Victoria Cross===
The award of the V.C. was gazette on 23 August 1915. It stated that it was awarded:
On 26 April 1915, the second day of the disastrous V beach landing at Cape Helles, during the Battle of Gallipoli, Turkey, when just three companies of Munsters had made it to the shelter of some dunes, at daybreak they charged to take the village behind the Sedd el Bahr fort overlooking the bay. Corporal Cosgrove led a company section during the attack on the Turkish positions. Barbed wire held them up and Corporal Cosgrove, described by his command as &quot;an Irish Giant&quot; set himself the task of pulling the stanchion posts of the enemy&#x27;s high wire entanglement single-handed out of the ground, notwithstanding the terrific fire from both front and flanks with officers and men falling all around him. Thanks to his exceptional bravery, his heroic actions contributed greatly to the successful clearing of the heights. Turkish counter-attacks were held off.

He was described by Surgeon P.Burrowes-Kelly, RN.,D.S.O., as an &quot;Irish giant&quot; and by a person from Aghada who remembered him &quot;As a very shy man who hated to be fussed over.&quot;

==Later career==
Cosgrove transferred to the Royal Fusiliers in 1918, to the Leinster Regiment in 1920, the Northumberland Fusiliers in 1922, and later went as an Instructor to the Indian Territorial Force in 1928 to become 7042223 Staff Sgt Instructor. He came home in 1935 pending discharge to pension. However, he was admitted to Millbank hospital, and took discharge before he was fit. After a short leave in Cork, he returned to London, where he was admitted to Middlesex hospital. He was later transferred to Millbank hospital London, where he died on 21 July 1936 aged 47.

==Final salute==
The Royal Munster Fusilier&#x27;s Old Comrades Association Journal recorded his funeral:
On 16 June 1940, the O.C.A., of the Royal Munster Fusiliers unveiled a memorial over the grave.

==Medals==
In 1972, Cosgrove&#x27;s V.C., was sold for a record price £2,300 to a private collector. When questioned about the high price which the medal fetched, the auctioneer replied &quot;When one buys a gallantry medal, it is not just the medal one buys, but the act that won it. William Cosgrove’s Victoria Cross together with his other medals was sold at an auction by Dix Noonan Webb held on 22 September 2006 for &quot;The world&#x27;s most valuable auction of orders, decorations and medals&quot;. A total of £1,965,010 was spent by 305 different buyers, a figure which represents &quot;the highest amount ever realised by any numismatic auction in the UK&quot;. The day&#x27;s highest price, £180,000, was paid by a collector for the Gallipoli landings Victoria Cross group of six, which included the medal awarded to Sgt. William Cosgrove, Royal Munster Fusiliers.

<doc id="1218122" wikidata="Q288656" url="?curid=1218122" title="Shaun White">
<text>Shaun Roger White (born September 3, 1986) is an American former professional snowboarder and skateboarder. He is a five-time Olympian and a three-time Olympic gold medalist in half-pipe snowboarding. He holds the world record for the most X Games gold medals and most Olympic gold medals by a snowboarder. He has also won 10 ESPY Awards throughout his career in various categories.

==Early life==
White was born in San Diego, California, to parents Cathy and Roger. When he was young his mother was a waitress and his father, who grew up surfing, worked for the San Clemente, California, water department. He is the youngest of four children. His ancestry includes Irish and Italian. He was born with a tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart defect for which he required two open-heart operations before the age of one. White spent his early years riding the San Bernardino Mountains of Southern California with his family. They would stay in a van in resort parking lots.

==Athletic career==

===Skateboarding===
At an early age White&#x27;s skills drew admirers. Professional skateboarder Tony Hawk befriended the nine-year-old White at the Encinitas, California, YMCA skate park and mentored him, helping White turn pro in skateboarding at the age of 16. White has said that &quot;Tony was my hero and I was too terrified to talk to him so every time I saw him at the skate park I would try to impress him with my skateboarding in the hopes that one day he would say something to me.&quot; White has won many titles on his skateboard, including the overall title of Action Sports Tour Champion, and was the first person to compete in and win both the Summer and Winter X Games in two different sports.

===Snowboarding ===
Following in his older brother Jesse White&#x27;s footsteps, White switched from skiing to snowboarding at age six, and by age seven, he received his first sponsorship. White has participated in five Winter Olympics in his career. At the 2006, 2010, and 2018 Winter Olympics, White won gold in the snowboard halfpipe event. White has also participated in the Winter X Games, where he has won a medal every year since 2002. Including all winter X Games competitions through 2013, his medal count stands at 18 (13 gold, 3 silver, 2 bronze), among which is the first quadruple win streak by a male athlete in one discipline, the snowboard slopestyle. White&#x27;s streak was snapped in 2007 when he lost to Andreas Wiig and Teddy Flandreau, with White taking the bronze. He won the Air &amp; Style Contest in 2003 and 2004.

====2006 Winter Olympics====
At the 2006 Winter Olympics, White won gold in the half-pipe. After his first run in qualifications, White was almost out of competition, scoring only 37.7. On his second run, he recorded a score of 45.3. In the finals, White recorded a score of 46.8 (50 is the highest possible score) to win. Fellow American Danny Kass won the silver with a points total of 44.0.

====2008====
Executing a near-flawless second run, White captured his third consecutive snowboard halfpipe title at the 2008 U.S. Open Snowboarding Championships to go along with his third US Open slopestyle competition. This followed White&#x27;s win at the 25th (2007) Burton US Open, where he placed third in slopestlyle and first in the halfpipe. At the 2007 Open, White was also crowned the first &quot;Burton Global Open Champion&quot;. His take for the event was $100,000 (Global Open Champ), $20,000 (1st Place Halfpipe), $90,000 (3rd Place Slopestyle), and a new Corvette.

On November 16, 2008, White released his first video game, &quot;Shaun White Snowboarding&quot;, in North America (November 14, 2008, in Europe). &quot;Shaun White Snowboarding&quot; was the 20th-best-selling game of December 2008 in the United States.

====2009====

Controversy followed White&#x27;s win on the 2009 SuperPipe at Winter X Games XIII. Kevin Pearce had five hits in the pipe, and all were the same tricks White did in his final run. White, on the other hand, had six hits and he started off his run with a big backside rodeo 540 where Pearce started his run off with a big grab. Although Pearce went bigger, he had fewer hits, and his first hit wasn&#x27;t as technically difficult as White&#x27;s first hit. Judges came to the conclusion that White deserved the better score because he started off with a more technical trick and he had one more hit than Pearce. With the win, White became the second competitor, after Tanner Hall, to win a gold medal in the SuperPipe in consecutive years at the Winter X Games. He also won a gold medal in Slopestyle, finally winning gold after two consecutive years of bronze.

On February 14, 2009, White won the FIS World Cup Men&#x27;s Halfpipe event at Vancouver&#x27;s Cypress Mountain. Out of the gate in his first qualifying run, he qualified immediately with the day&#x27;s best score of 45.5. With a thumb sprained on an over-rotated backside 1080 in the second qualifying run, White clinched the event with the first of his two runs in the finals. His first finals run was awarded the highest score ever in FIS halfpipe, a 47.3.

====2010 Winter Olympics====
At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, White again won gold in the halfpipe. In the finals, White recorded a score of 46.8 on his first run, which proved a high enough score to secure the gold medal without a second run. He performed his second run anyway, as a victory lap, ending his run with a well-anticipated Double McTwist 1260 which he named The Tomahawk. This second run resulted in a record score of 48.4 (50 is the highest possible score) enlarging his margin of victory. His nearest competitor won the silver with a points total of 45.0 – 3.4 behind White.

====2011====
After a sub-par performance in the Slopestyle and failing to reach the finals, White &quot;redeemed&quot; himself in the SuperPipe. With an 89, he sat in second place going into his 2nd of three runs. He completed the run, landing his infamous Double McTwist 1260 and finishing with a score of 97.33 to take the lead and claim the historical 4th straight Gold in the Winter X Games, held in Aspen, Colorado. The score tied an X Games record, which was set by White one year before. His 3rd run was a simple victory run featuring mostly straight air.

====2012====
At Winter X, White became the first person in the history of the Winter X Games to score a perfect 100 in the men&#x27;s Snowboard SuperPipe.

====2013====
White won his 6th consecutive SuperPipe victory, making him the second participant ever to achieve this, with SnoCross racer Tucker Hibbert achieving his 6th consecutive victory earlier in the same day.

In December 2013, he won the third place in the Pipe &amp; Slope contest at the FIS Snowboard World Cup in Copper Mountain, Colorado.

====2014 Winter Olympics====
White finished fourth at the 2014 Winter Olympics in the Halfpipe event.

During the winter games, he was the most talked-about Olympic athlete on Facebook.

====2018 Winter Olympics====

While in New Zealand, training for the 2018 Winter Olympics, White crashed into the edge of a superpipe; the resulting injuries to his face required 62 stitches. Despite the accident, White qualified for the 2018 US Olympic Team. On February 14, he won his third Olympic gold medal for the Men&#x27;s Halfpipe event with a score of 97.75, with Ayumu Hirano of Japan taking the silver medal and Scott James of Australia taking the bronze. White was trailing Hirano by one full point coming into his last run with a score of 94.25. Despite this, White dramatically won the gold medal with back-to-back 1440s. His gold medal was also the 100th for the United States at the Winter Olympic Games.

====2022 Winter Olympics====
White finished fourth at the 2022 Winter Olympics in the halfpipe.

During the winter games, White announced it would be the last Olympics in which he would compete. Later, he announced it would be his final competition altogether.

===Endorsements===
White has had a sponsor since he was seven years old. White signed CAA Sports for representation after working with IMG for eight years. Corporate endorsement deals include or have included Burton Snowboards, Oakley, Inc., Birdhouse Skateboards, Park City Mountain Resort, Target Corporation, Red Bull, Ubisoft, Adio, Hewlett-Packard, and American Express. He is also a brand ambassador for Krave Jerky and as part of their partnership he has developed and released his own flavors. In 2009, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine estimated that he had earned $9 million from his endorsements in 2008.

==Media ventures==

===Acting===
White has made cameo appearances as himself in the 2011 film &quot;Friends with Benefits&quot;, the 2013 episode &quot;Da Flippity Flop&quot; of the animated TV series &quot;American Dad!&quot;, and the 2014 Disney Channel Original Movie &quot;Cloud 9&quot;.

White starred in the 2004 documentary &quot;The White Album&quot; and the 2005 snowboarding documentary &quot;First Descent&quot;.

In 2007, White appeared on the E! reality TV show &quot;The Girls Next Door&quot; as a snowboarding teacher for Holly Madison, Bridget Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson.

A film, &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Down&quot;, was released on DVD and ESPN in 2009. The film tracks his journey through the year following his Olympic success.

White appeared on the January 16, 2011, episode of &quot;Extreme Makeover: Home Edition&quot; to help redesign a room for an eight-year-old boy.

White appeared in the Nickelodeon TV series &quot;Henry Danger&quot; in 2018 in the episode &quot;Toon in for Danger&quot;. In the episode White and Captain Man were struggling for a seat while watching the premiere of &quot;The Adventures of Kid Danger&quot;.

===Music===
White plays guitar in the electronic rock band Bad Things, which also features former Augustana bassist Jared Palomar. He got his first guitar as first prize in a snowboarding competition. The band played in one of the four Saturday headlining slots at the 2013 Lollapalooza festival, as a last-minute replacement for Death Grips. Their self-titled debut album was released in January 2014.

In October 2013, White appeared in the music video for &quot;City of Angels&quot; by Thirty Seconds to Mars.

===Print===
White had his first published interview in &quot;TransWorld SNOWboarding Magazine&quot; in 2003.

White was one of the few pro snowboarders to be a guest editor of &quot;Snowboarder Magazine&quot; (February 2008 issue).

White has a chapter giving advice in Tim Ferriss&#x27;s book &quot;Tools of Titans&quot;.

==Business ventures==

White has appeared in several video games and has also launched his video game franchise. He appeared in 1999’s &quot;Cool Boarders 4&quot; and 2001&#x27;s &quot;Shaun Palmer&#x27;s Pro Snowboarder&quot;. In 2008 he released his own video game, &quot;Shaun White Snowboarding&quot;, developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. This was followed by a sequel, &quot;Shaun White Snowboarding: World Stage&quot;, released in 2009. A skateboarding game, &quot;Shaun White Skateboarding&quot;, was also released in 2010.

In early 2016 he purchased a minority stake in Mammoth Resorts and is now a part-owner of the Mammoth Mountain, Snow Summit, June Mountain, and Bear Mountain ski areas where he got his start in snowboarding.

White has helmed the Air + Style festival of music and snowboarding since 2014, when he took ownership and moved it from Austria to Los Angeles. The 2021 festival was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

White launched his own active lifestyle brand named &#x27;Whitespace&#x27; in January 2022; he announced the name of the brand on his social media. The company will eventually release a line of outerwear, snowboard hard-goods, athletic equipment, and streetwear apparel.

==Personal life==
White has had the longstanding nickname &quot;The Flying Tomato&quot;, due to his red hair. In 2006, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote about the nickname, saying, &quot;he used to embrace it, even wearing headbands with a flying-tomato logo, but he has grown tired of it.&quot; He has also been nicknamed &quot;Animal&quot;, a reference to a character from &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;.

On September 17, 2012, White was arrested near a hotel in Nashville for public intoxication and vandalism after attending the wedding party of the drummer of the Black Keys, Patrick Carney.

White, who underwent two open-heart surgeries as an infant, has granted 17 wishes through the Make-A-Wish Foundation since 2008.

===Relationships===
White was in a relationship with Sarah Barthel of the band Phantogram from 2013 to 2019. He started dating actress Nina Dobrev in 2020. The two became engaged on October 30, 2024.

===Sexual harassment allegation===
In 2016, Bad Things drummer Lena Zawaideh brought a lawsuit against White, claiming sexual harassment and breach of contract. White and Zawaideh reached an out-of-court settlement in May 2017; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed. At a press conference following White&#x27;s win at the 2018 Winter Olympics, he was asked if he was concerned that the lawsuit and settlement would tarnish his image. In replying, he referred to the incident as gossip, a response that created widespread condemnation of White for minimizing sexual harassment. White later apologized for his choice of words.

<doc id="1218125" wikidata="Q6286218" url="?curid=1218125" title="Joseph Petrus Hendrik Crowe">
<text>Lieutenant colonel Joseph Petrus Hendrik Crowe VC (12 January 1826 – 12 April 1876) was the second South African-born recipient of the Victoria Cross (after Christopher Teesdale VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 31 years old, and a lieutenant in the 78th Regiment of Foot, British Army during the Indian Mutiny, when the following deed took place, for which he was awarded the VC.

On 12 August 1857 at Boursekee Chowkee, the entrenched village in front of Busherutgunge, India, the redoubt was occupied by the enemy, who were causing heavy casualties among the 18th Regiment. It was decided to take the place by storm, and the Highlanders dashed forward, Lieutenant Crowe being the first in, followed by his men. In less than a minute the redoubt was captured.

==His death==
On 23 October 1875 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel, commanding the 1st Battalion of Foot. He was due to return home to South Africa in 1876 and contracted a chill while snipe shooting in the Irish bogs. He died on 12 April 1876 in Penge, Surrey and was interred in a non-descript grave in the West Norwood Cemetery. In 1957, his overgrown grave was found and in August 1976 his remains were exhumed. A grand return was planned and on 5 February 1977, following a quasi-military ceremony in St Katherine&#x27;s Anglican Church, his casket was carried on a gun carriage, followed by descendants of his sisters, to the MOTH Garden of Remembrance, Uitenhage, where his remains were reinterred.

==The medal==
At his death, his eldest sister Maria Margaret Lister inherited his medals and another sister, Dorothya Susanna Lovemore inherited his sword. Margaret stored his medals in a wall cupboard in her home, &quot;Firlands&quot;, Rondebosch, but they were forever lost when the home was destroyed by fire. The medals were not recovered, but the sword has remained in the Lovemore family.

<text>Charles Harry Coverdale VC MM (21 April 1888 – 20 November 1955) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Coverdale was 29 years old, and a sergeant in the 11th Battalion, The Manchester Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 4 October 1917 south-west of Poelcapelle, Belgium, when close to the objective, Sergeant Coverdale disposed of three snipers. He then rushed two machine-guns, killing or wounding the teams. He subsequently reorganised his platoon in order to capture another position, but after getting within 100 yards of it was held up by our own barrage and had to return. Later he went out again with five men to capture the position, but when he saw a considerable number of the enemy advancing, withdrew his detachment man by man, he himself being the last to retire.

He later achieved the rank of second lieutenant with the Manchester Regiment.

<text>Gian Singh (5 October 19206 October 1996) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Singh was born into a Jat Sikh family in Shahabpur also spelt Sahabpur, a village in the Nawanshahr district (now, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district) of eastern Punjab. He enlisted in the British Indian Army in 1937.

==Details==
He was 24 years old, and a Naik in the 15th Punjab Regiment in the British Indian Army, when during the Burma Campaign 1944–45 of World War II he performed the deeds for which he was awarded the VC. The citation reads:

Singh received a mention in dispatches later that year. He was presented with his Victoria Cross by King George VI, in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 16 October 1945.

==Later life==
Despite wounds to his leg which left him in pain until his death, Singh refused to be invalided from the Army. After Indian independence in 1947, he transferred to the 11th Sikhs when 15 Punjab was allocated to Pakistan. He regularly visited London to attend reunions of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association. According to his son, for many years Singh never discussed the war or his VC action with his family, as he had lost all of his close friends in action.

Singh was promoted to havildar (sergeant), with successive promotions to jemadar (now naib subedar in the Indian Army) on 29 December 1955, followed by promotion to subedar on 21 December 1961. He saw action in both the 1962 Sino-Indian War and in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Promoted to subedar major on 15 June 1967, Singh retired from the army in August 1969 with the honorary rank of captain. He died in 1996.

==The medal==
Singh&#x27;s medals, including his Victoria Cross, are held by his son Charanjit Sangha, who lives in Scotland.

<text>Second Lieutenant George Ward Gunn VC MC (26 July 1912 - 21 November 1941) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
Gunn was born in Neston, Cheshire. He was educated at Sedbergh School and Mostyn House. He joined the Army in 1939, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant the following year. 

He was 29 years old, and a second lieutenant in the 3rd Regiment Royal Horse Artillery, British Army during World War II when the action took place for which he was awarded the VC.

During the British attempt to relieve the siege of Tobruk, the Germans counter-attacked near the airfield of Sidi Rezegh.

On 21 November 1941 at Sidi Rezegh, Gunn was the commander of A Troop of J Battery. These four QF 2 pounder anti-tank guns mounted &quot;portee&quot; on trucks were part of a battery of twelve guns attached to the Rifle Brigade.

An attack earlier in the day was driven off but the main attack was by 60 German tanks. Gunn - in an unarmoured vehicle - drove between the guns under his command, encouraging and reorganising them as the battle progressed. Three guns had been knocked out and their crews fatally wounded when the last was hit. Except the sergeant, the crew were dead or disabled and the vehicle set alight. The battery commander Major Pinney attacked the flames and Gunn crossed the enemy fire to join him. Gunn took over the gun aiming and firing it with the sergeant acting as his loader. Despite enemy fire and the danger of the flames exploding the ammunition with which the portee was loaded, Gunn fired 40- 50 rounds from the QF 2 pounder gun and set two enemy tanks on fire before he himself was killed by being shot through the head.

After he was killed, the battery commander took over the gun and continued the action. As a result of the battery&#x27;s actions, it was given the honour title &quot;Sidi Rezegh&quot;.

The official announcement in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of the award said of him &quot;Second-Lieutenant Gunn showed the most conspicuous courage in attacking this large number of enemy tanks with a single unarmoured gun, and his utter disregard for extreme danger was an example which inspired all who saw it. He remained undismayed by intense fire and overwhelming odds, and his gallant resistance only ceased with his death. But for this very gallant action the enemy tanks would undoubtedly have over-run our position.&quot;

A memorial to Gunn stands in his old school, Sedbergh, and at Mostyn House commemorating his brave deeds. A street was named in his honour in Neston (&quot;Gunn Grove&quot;), a JLRRA training troop was created in his name (Gunn Troop 33 Campbell Battery RA) and a memorial was placed in the Parish Church, (St Mary &amp; St Helen&#x27;s).

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Artillery Museum in Woolwich, England.

<text>Lieutenant General Sir James Hills-Johnes, (20 August 1833 – 3 January 1919) was a British Indian Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Born James Hills on 20 August 1833 in Neechindipur, Bengal, India, he was the son of James and Charlotte Hills. He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy (1843–1847), the Edinburgh Institution (1847–1850) and the Addiscombe Military Seminary (1851–1853), and was commissioned into the Bengal Artillery in 1853. Hills changed his surname to Hills-Johnes in 1882 on his marriage to Elizabeth Johnes, the younger daughter and coheiress of John Johnes of Dolaucothi, Carmarthenshire.

==Military career==

Hills was a 23 year old second lieutenant in the Bengal Horse Artillery during the Indian Mutiny at the Siege of Delhi on 9 July 1857 for which he and Henry Tombs, commander of the Bengal Horse Artillery contingent were together awarded the Victoria Cross.

Hills had been on picket duty with two guns near the camp when enemy cavalry attacked. In order to give the guns time, Hills rode straight at the enemy, cutting down two of them before he was knocked from his horse. Getting up he was attacked by the enemy. Hills shot one, avoided the lance of another and cut him with his sword before finishing the first attacker. A third grappled with Hills and took his sword from him but Tombs, who had come up to check the guns, arrived in time and shot the man. On the way back to the position, they encountered another of the enemy. Hills and Tombs parried the first attacks but Hills then took a blow to the head and went down; Tombs &quot;put his sword through the man&quot; saving Hills for the second time.

The official citation in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; 27 April 1858 read:
In addition to the Delhi clasp of the Indian Mutiny Medal, Hills received the Lucknow clasp awarded to troops under command of Sir Colin Campbell who were engaged in final operations leading to the surrender of Lucknow and the clearing of the surrounding areas from November 1857 to March 1858. 

After a number of staff appointments, Hills served as an artillery officer in the Abyssinian campaign of 1867–68 and the Lushai Expedition of 1871–72. Promoted major-general in July 1879, he fought in the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878–80), and was made military governor of Kabul in October 1879 and commanded a division in 1880. For services in Afghanistan he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in March 1881. Hills-Johnes was promoted lieutenant-general in January 1884 and retired in 1888. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in June 1893.

==Later life==

Hills-Johnes was High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire in 1886 and made an honorary freeman of the town of Carmarthen in 1910. He also served as a member of Carmarthenshire County Council. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the Royal Carmarthen Artillery, the local Militia unit, on 25 February 1891. He was a long standing friend of Lord Roberts, and in 1900 he accompanied Roberts in a private capacity during the South African War. 

He died of influenza during the post-war pandemic on 3 January 1919, aged 85, at his Dolaucothi Estate and was buried at Caio, Carmarthenshire.

Hills-Johnes had five brothers and four sisters. The brothers included Major-General Sir John Hills (1834–1902) of the Bombay Engineers; Robert Hills (1837–1909), a first-class cricketer who was the brother-in-law of Lieutenant William George Cubitt VC and uncle of Brigadier Lewis Pugh Evans VC; and Charles Hills (1847–1935), the family history saying he was the real father of Hollywood actress Merle Oberon.

His medals, including the Victoria Cross, are displayed at the Royal Artillery Museum, Woolwich, London.

<text>Robert Grant VC (1837 – 23 November 1874) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Military service==
Grant was approximately 20 years old, and a corporal (subsequently promoted to sergeant) in the 1st Battalion, 5th Regiment of Foot (later The Northumberland Fusiliers), British Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place at Alumbagh for which he was awarded the VC. The citation was published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; of 19 June 1860, and initially Grant was incorrectly named as Ewart, which was corrected in a subsequent &quot;Gazette&quot; of 12 October 1860. The citation read:
==Police service==

He later became a constable in the Metropolitan Police, and served in the Y Division Holloway area until his death of what was then commonly known as consumption in 1874. He was buried, at the expense of the parish, in a paupers&#x27; grave, number 15054, in Highgate Cemetery, North London. The grave (with modern headstone) lies on the eastern mid-way path just off the main western path.
A replica of his Victoria Cross is displayed at the Fusiliers Museum of Northumberland in Alnwick Castle in Northumberland.

In 2007 and 2008 moves were made to properly commemorate both his military and police service with a memorial stone to be unveiled by the head of London&#x27;s police service, Sir Ian Blair. He is also commemorated in his home town of Harrogate with a plaque at the War Memorial.

<text>Horace Augustus Curtis VC (7 March 1891 – 1 July 1968) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
The son of a gamekeeper and the fourth of five children, Horace Augustus Curtis was born in St Anthony-in-Roseland, Cornwall on 7 March 1891. His home was at Glenburn in St Newlyn East. After attending and leaving school he &quot;was employed as a china clay worker until September 1914&quot;, just a few weeks after the outbreak of the First World War.

==First World War==
It was during this time when he, like so many other young men of his generation, volunteered for service with the British Army. On 12 September he joined the Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry (DCLI) at Bodmin, with his service number being 15833. However, within days of enlisting in the DCLI, he was transferred to the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, &quot;as recruiting in Ireland was not as successful as in England&quot;, becoming one of several thousand recruits originally from an English regiment transferred to an Irish one. As a result, he was given a new service number, 14107, and soon left England for County Kildare in Ireland to train with the 7th (Service) Battalion of his regiment, with which he would remain throughout most of the war. His battalion was one of four which made up the 30th Brigade (which itself was one of three brigades which made up the 10th (Irish) Division) which, in February 1915, moved to Dublin where it continued to train until May when it moved again, this time to England, &quot;to continue their training in Basingstoke&quot;. In July the 10th Division left Devonport, its destination being Egypt. It took part in the landing at Suvla Bay the following month and, over the next few weeks, after it suffered very &quot;high casualties during the fighting against Turkish forces&quot;, forcing it to leave for Salonika before being sent back to Egypt in October.

In February 1916 Curtis was promoted to lance corporal and then received another promotion, this time to the rank of sergeant, some nine months later. He was also mentioned in dispatches, presumably for his services at Gallipoli, in July 1917. In September of that year Curtis, together with the rest of the 10th Division, departed Alexandria and the division found itself engaged in fighting in Palestine.

In the spring of 1918 Curtis&#x27;s battalion, the 7th Dublin Fusiliers, was transferred from the 10th Division to the Western Front, arriving there in early June. &quot;On the 6th Curtis was one of the men from the battalion to be absorbed into the 2nd Battalion and, a fortnight later, and due to him suffering from malaria, he left for England and became a patient in Bermondsey Military Hospital. He also had some much overdue leave in Cornwall between 24 July and 3 August&quot;. His leave over, he returned once more to the Western Front on 19 August, &quot;and was back on frontline duty on 21 September&quot;.

==VC action==
On 18 October 1918, No. 14107 Sergeant Curtis, 2nd Battalion Royal Dublin Fusiliers fought in action near Le Cateau that earned him the Victoria Cross. The following is the official citation, which appeared in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 6 January 1919.

His VC was presented to him by King George V at Buckingham Palace on 8 March 1919.

==Post war==
Curtis was discharged on 31 March 1920. He joined the 5th (Territorial) Battalion DCLI on a 3-year engagement at St Columb on 5 May 1920. Private 5431368, he was rapidly promoted to Sergeant and by 27 August 1920 was WO2 (CSM). On 20 December 1921, he transferred to the 4/5th DCLI and on 19 May 1923 his service was terminated at the end of his engagement.

Curtis, who became increasingly more ill during the 1960s, eventually becoming almost completely paralysed, died on 1 July 1968, at the age of seventy-seven.

==The Medal==
His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Collection at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>Jorge Alberto Uribe Echavarría (born 30 October 1940 in Medellín) is a Colombian politician and businessman. In 2003 the government of President Alvaro Uribe appointed him as Minister of Defense of Colombia.

== Biography ==

He was educated at primary and secondary schools in Colombia, with two years spent at Culver Military Academy in the United States. He completed a first degree in economics at George Washington University in the US and did post-graduate work in international marketing at Besançon University in France.

He served as his country&#x27;s minister of defense, succeeding Marta Lucía Ramírez, who was Colombia&#x27;s first female defence minister. Prior to that appointment, he served as Finland&#x27;s honorary consul in Bogotá for a period of ten years.

Jorge Alberto Uribe Echavarría is not related to fellow &quot; medellinense&quot; President Álvaro Uribe Vélez, but the two are old friends.

== Controversy ==

Jorge Alberto Uribe, rejected the accusations that the newspaper El Nuevo Herald of Miami made about the alleged affair he had with a woman arrested for drug trafficking in El Buen Pastor prison in Medellin. In a press release, the Minister confirmed that he had known this person for ten years and was aware of the alleged criminal activities the woman had been accused with. &quot;In a single opportunity, in early 2003, seven months before my office as Minister of Defense, I visited said person at the Good Shepherd Jail Medellin.

<text>&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Club Sportiv Victoria Ineu, commonly known as Victoria Ineu, is a Romanian football club from Ineu, Arad County and currently playing in Liga VI – Arad County, the sixth tier of the Romanian football. 

Founded in 1920, Victoria Ineu has had several names over time such as Progresul, Spartac, Crișul, CS Ineu, Tricotaje and ACB. The club reached the Divizia B as Tricotaje Ineu, playing in the Romanian second division in 2003–04 and 2004–05, finishing in 9th position in both campaigns.

==History==
Victoria Ineu was founded in April 1920 at the initiative of a group of intellectuals from Ineu at that time, by creating football, athletics and gymnastics teams. The team played in the district, regional and county championships between 1946 and 1978. 

Victoria managed to win the county championship at the end of the 1977–78 season and the promotion play-off against CFR Caransebeș, the winner of the Caraș-Severin County Championship, with 2–2 on aggregate (1–2 away and 1–0 at home) and were promoted on the away goals rule.

In the first three years in Divizia C, Ineuanii struggled to avoid relegation, finishing 12th in the 1978–79 season and 13th in both the 1979–80 and 1980–81 seasons. The following season, 1981–82, ended with a mid-table finish in 8th place.

Preceded by two more years in the mid-table, finishing 11th in the 1982–83 season and 10th in the 1983–84 season, relegation to the fourth division came after the 1984–85 season, when finishing in 15th place. 

In 1985, Victoria Ineu also reached the Round of 32 of the Cupa României, losing 0–3 to FC Olt Scornicești. The lineup in that match was: Țica I (Csillag) – Costin, Szabo, Maghiș (Weckerle), Reisz – Sas, Popa, Leucuța – Țica II, Nicodin and Rusan, with Ioan Palcu as head coach.

In 1986, in an attempt to make a comeback to the third division, Victoria merged with two other teams from the town, Metalul and Gloria, forming CS Ineu. The club won the Arad County Championship in the 1988–89 season but lost the promotion play-off against Minerul Ștei, the Bihor County Championship winner, with a 0–1 loss at Ștei and a 0–0 draw at Ineu. 
The 2000–01 season marks the long-awaited return of Ineu to Liga III. With Alexandru Gaica on the bench, Tricotaje Ineu (named after the knitwear factory in town) won the Divizia D – Arad County and defeated CS Vulcan, the Divizia D – Hunedoara County winner, 2–1 in the promotion play-off held at Timișoara.

In 2005, Tricotaje Ineu sold its place in Divizia B to FCM Reșița and bought the place in the third tier of Universitatea Reșița and renamed as CS Ineu.

In the summer of 2020, &quot;CS Ineu&quot; started a collaboration with Brosovszky Football Academy and was renamed as ACB Ineu.

<text>Corporal John William Harper VC (6 August 1916 – 29 September 1944) was a British Army soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Birth==
John William Harper was born in Hatfield, Doncaster, West Riding of Yorkshire on 6 August 1916 to George Ernest Harper and his wife, Florence Parkin.

==Details==
Harper was 28 years old, and a corporal in the 4th Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment, British Army during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 29 September 1944 during an assault on the Depot de Mendicite, Merksplas, Belgium, Corporal Harper led his section across 300 yards of completely exposed ground, with utter disregard for the hail of mortar bombs and small arms fire from the enemy. He was killed in the action, but the subsequent capture of the position was largely due to his self-sacrifice.
==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is held at The York &amp; Lancaster Regiment Museum in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England.

==Memorials==
His remains now lie at the War Cemetery at Leopoldsburg, near Limburg, Belgium, Plot No.5, Row B, Grave No.15. 
A stained glass window, created by Frans Pelgrims and donated by the town of Merksplas (Belgium) as sign of an everlasting gratitude and respect, depicting Corporal Harper and the area of his final battle are shown in Hatfield St Lawrence Church.
His name is inscribed on the Hatfield Cemetery War Memorial.

<text>Osella is an Italian racing car manufacturer and former Formula One team. They participated in 132 Grands Prix between 1980 and 1990. They achieved two points finishes and scored five world championship points.

==Early days==
Osella was founded in Volpiano in 1965 by former rally driver Enzo Osella. The team began life by racing Abarth sports cars among local and national races in Italy since 1965. In 1974, Osella took over the factory Abarth sports car program and expanded into single-seater racing. In 1975, the team entered the European Formula Two Championship with Giorgio Francia and Duilio Truffo, achieving some success with its own car, the BMW-powered Osella FA2.

Osella continued in Formula Two the following season, but financial problems meant that the team was not competitive and withdrew from the championship before the end of the season. In the following years, the FA2s were occasionally entered by privateers, one of them being the Swiss touring car driver Charly Kiser. The experience prompted Osella to try to become a manufacturer for other teams. The Osella FA3 Formula Three car, powered with Toyota or Lancia engines, competed in the 1976 German and Italian F3 championships without making any great impression. After this, the team concentrated on running in local sports car events during 1977 and 1978.

==Return to Formula Two==
Osella returned to the European Formula Two Championship in 1979, with American driver Eddie Cheever racing the well-used FA2, again powered by a BMW engine. The car was good enough to win three races and take Cheever to fourth in the championship. After securing the sponsorship of the Ente Tabacchi Italiani tobacco company via their flagship brand MS, Enzo Osella decided to upgrade his activities to Formula One.

==Formula One==
Osella&#x27;s first Formula One car, the FA1, was designed by Giorgio Stirano. Powered by Ford Cosworth DFV, the car was presented in a black and white livery with large Denim branding on the sidepods. After a difficult beginning of the season, Eddie Cheever was able to qualify regularly but finished just one race in the whole season. The car suffered from unreliability problems and was aerodynamically inefficient. Many components were manufactured in-house – a strategy that although financially viable, often resulted in poorly designed material. 

For the 1982 season, Osella fielded two cars, one for Jean-Pierre Jarier and one for Riccardo Paletti. The team hired Giorgio Valentini and Tony Southgate to design a new car, with input from Enzo Osella himself. Most of these attempts brought little improvement as high-tech solutions could not be financed. Jarier finished fourth at Imola in 1982 (where only 14 cars started) and scored the first Championship points for the young team in a car that was by now dubbed Osella FA1C. Towards the end of the season tragedy struck, when Riccardo Paletti was killed in a start-line accident at the 1982 Canadian Grand Prix.

In 1983 the team regrouped, and hired Piercarlo Ghinzani and Teo Fabi&#x27;s younger brother Corrado Fabi, who had just won the Formula Two European championship. Lack of funding and reliability issues prevented the drivers to qualify for many of the events on the calendar, Fabi&#x27;s 10th place at the Deutch Grand Prix the best result of the season. For 1984 Osella retained Ghinzani and gave the second car to the young Austrian Jo Gartner. Ghinzani was able to score points when he finished fifth at the 1984 Dallas Grand Prix. Gardner finished fifth at Monza but both him and countryman Gerhard Berger, who had finished sixth on ATS, didn&#x27;t receive any points as their teams at the beginning of the season had only officially entered one car. For the 1985 season, Ghinzani was paired with Huub Rothengatter but none of the two were able to score any points. In 1986, in order to stay afloat, the team started asking their drivers to bring sponsorship. Whilst some of the drivers who started their F1 careers with the team would go on to have respectable careers, such as Alex Caffi and Gabriele Tarquini, others disappeared as quickly as they had come, such as Allen Berg and Franco Forini. None of these drivers were able to push the team forward, and Osella continued with little or no improvement in competitiveness.

===Partnership with Alfa Romeo===
In the mid-1980s, Osella was the beneficiary of factory Alfa Romeo engines, both in naturally-aspirated (1983–84) and turbo (1984–88) forms. The Alfa engine program helped the team to survive the increasingly professional turbo era but it failed to improve its competitiveness. The Alfa turbo engine, the 890T, was not reliable. Turbos blew up regularly and power output had to be reduced down to the level of the non-turbo cars just to achieve the necessary reliability. Alfa Romeo&#x27;s chief designer, Carlo Chiti, offered some technical input to the team. Beginning with the 1984 Osella FA1F, which was based on the 1983 works Alfa Romeo 183T, all the following Osella models up to the FA1L in had their origins in the initial Alfa design.

For 1988 – the last year before turbos were banned – the team re-branded the 890T as the &quot;Osella V8&quot;. This came about after Alfa&#x27;s parent company, Fiat, grew tired of the negative publicity the team had given the 890T and, while allowing them to continue using the engine, refused to allow the Alfa Romeo name to be used.

After driver Nicola Larini managed some impressive times in pre-season testing at Monza, the team were quietly confident of a decent showing through 1988, as many teams had switched to naturally-aspirated engines in preparation for 1989. However, the FA1L, with its outdated turbo, was not up to the challenge. Larini often failed to qualify or even pre-qualify, and was also excluded from the San Marino Grand Prix before practice after failing to get through scrutineering due to illegal changes made to the chassis. At the end of the season, Enzo Osella terminated his agreement with Alfa Romeo.

===Cosworth power and Fondmetal===
The 1989 season saw some improvement. The all-new, Cosworth DFR-powered Osella FA1M performed better in the qualifying sessions (most notably in the Japanese Grand Prix, where Larini qualified 10th). The fine qualifying performance, however, didn&#x27;t translate into good results in the races. The cars rarely saw the finish line due to several technical failures. The most frustrating race was the Canadian Grand Prix, where Larini had climbed to third during the race but retired when the FA1M&#x27;s electrics failed due to water ingress. At the end of the season, on the occasion of the Australian Grand Prix, Ghinzani suffered a high-speed collision with the Lotus of Nelson Piquet, leaving him with an injured ankle. Right after, Ghinzani announced his retirement. 

In 1990, Enzo Osella sold shares in his team to metalwork magnate Gabriele Rumi, as part of a sponsorship deal with Rumi&#x27;s Fondmetal company. During , the team entered a single car for French driver Olivier Grouillard. At the end of 1990, Rumi took over the remainder of the team and renamed it Fondmetal. The involvement of Rumi meant the end of Osella&#x27;s activities in Formula One.

==Sportscars==
During his Formula One years, Osella had continued building sports cars. In fact this was one of the few projects that regularly brought work and money to Volpiano, especially in hillclimb races, with Mauro Nesti many times winner of European and Italian Championship, and many other drivers, with PA9 and PA9/90 models.

A few of those sports cars even found their way to the Can Am series, although without much success. The most prestigious result was during the 1984 Can Am season with a third place in the championship for the 2-litre class; the car was the Osella PA10 driven by Armando Trentini, and was the only two-seater in the championship; the rest of the 2-litre class field comprised single-seater F2 cars with covered wheels.

In the 1990s, Osella moved to Atella in the south of Italy where he built a new ultra-modern facility to produce some very competitive sports cars. Many of them were sold to privateers, while others were entered in several classes by the Osella works team. The works team was particularly successful in hillclimb races. In 1995 Osella works team driver Pasquale Irlando won all 9 races of the European hillclimb championship using the Osella PA20. He won the title in 1997, 1998 and 1999 consecutively. His successor Fabio Danti died in one of Osella&#x27;s cars when he was competing in the 2000 Championship. Hillclimb stars like Franz Tschager and Martin Krisam continue to use Osella cars. In 2001 the factory was transferred back near Turin, in Verolengo, and continued activity building sport cars for hill climbing and minor sport race championship.

At the end of 2022, Osella Motorsports LTD merged with Osella Engineering. Under the leadership of Enzo Osella and Giuseppe Angiulli, the company, now known as Osella corse, produced cars such as the PA21 JrB from the E2B class, that can be equipped with motorcycling propellers from 1000 to 1600 cc., with a set-up both for hill climbing and track. This new collaboration, according to Enzo Osella, &quot;breathed life into Osella and also into the spirit that has been driving the team&quot;.

<doc id="1218152" wikidata="Q3530701" url="?curid=1218152" title="Thomas Crean">
<text>Major Dr. Thomas Joseph Crean (19 April 1873 – 25 March 1923) was an Irish rugby union player, British Army soldier and doctor. During the Second Boer War, while serving with the Imperial Light Horse, he was awarded the Victoria Cross. In 1902, he was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. During the First World War he served with the Royal Army Medical Corps and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.

Crean played rugby for Leinster, Ireland and the British Isles. In 1894, he was a member of the first Ireland team to win both a Home Nations Championship and a Triple Crown. Then in 1896, he helped Ireland win their second Home Nations title. He is one of three Ireland rugby union internationals to have been awarded the Victoria Cross. The other two are Robert Johnston, who also served with the Imperial Light Horse in the Second Boer War, and Frederick Harvey who served in the First World War. Crean, Johnston and Harvey all played club rugby for Wanderers. In 1896 Crean and Johnston were also members of the same British Isles squad that toured South Africa.

==Early years==

===Family===

Crean was born in Morrison&#x27;s Hotel, which stood on the corner of Dawson Street and Nassau Street in Dublin. Some accounts give his place of birth as No. 21 Northbrook Road, the Crean family home at the time he won the VC in 1901. He was the fifth child of Michael Theobald Crean, a barrister originally from Fethard in County Tipperary who worked for the Irish Land Commission, and his wife Emma. His maternal grandparents, John and Maryanne Dunn, were the owners of the hotel where he was born. The Dunns&#x27; residence was Esker House, Upper Rathmines Road, and Crean&#x27;s three older sisters - Mary, Emma and Eleanor – were all born there. Both his older and younger brothers, John and Frank Crean, were also born at Morrison&#x27;s Hotel. A third brother, Richard, died as an infant, and a fourth sister, Alice Mary, was born in 1879 in the Crean family home at No. 7 Upper Pembroke Street. Alice would later marry Alexander Findlater Todd, one of Crean&#x27;s rugby teammates on the 1896 British Isles tour of South Africa. John followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps becoming a barrister in the Land Commission and one of his sons was Fr C. P. Crean MBE, Army chaplain with I Corps during WW2 and Head Chaplain of the Irish Defense Forces from 1956 to 1962. Frank studied engineering, emigrating to Canada where he undertook a survey of Saskatchewan in 1908–09 on behalf of the Canadian Government. This was the famous &#x27;Frank Crean Expeditions to the New North-West&#x27; and Crean Lake in Prince Albert National Park was named in his honour.

Crean was named after his uncle Dr. Thomas Joseph Crean, a successful practitioner and civil medical officer in the town of Clonmel, County Tipperary. Also from Clonmel was Lieutenant Colonel Dr. John Joseph Crean, a cousin and close friend to his father who had been with General Graham&#x27;s Suakin Expedition in Sudan following the fall of Khartoum in 1885. John was a Senior Medical Officer throughout England and the colonies, also holding such positions as Principal Civil Medical Officer (PCMO) of the Straits Settlements in 1886. John was Head of the Army Medical Department in Dublin while Crean was in school at Clongowes. Crean ultimately followed in the footsteps of these two men, becoming both a successful practitioner and an esteemed officer of the Royal Army Medical Corps.

===Education===
Crean and his brothers all initially attended Belvedere College and Catholic University School before becoming boarders at Clongowes Wood College. Thomas attended Clongowes from 1889 until 1891. As a student he was noted as a fine athlete, excelling not only at rugby but also at both the quarter and half-mile running events. He was also a very fine swimmer, and it was as a swimmer that he first demonstrated his bravery. On 11 September 1891, while swimming with fellow students near Blackrock, Dublin, he helped rescue a 21-year-old art student, William Ahern. Crean noticed Ahern was in trouble and together with a young solicitor named Leachman from Dundrum, he managed to bring him ashore. For his bravery he was awarded a medal by the Royal Humane Society.

In October 1891 Crean commenced his medical studies at the Royal College of Surgeons and, after graduating as a doctor in 1896, he became a Licentiate of both the Royal College of Surgeons and the Royal College of Physicians.

==Rugby career==

===Clubs and Province===
As a student Crean played at half-back and on joining Wanderers in 1891 he played in the same position for their third XV. However, after switching to the forward row for the 1892–93 season, he was quickly promoted to their senior side. While working as a young doctor in St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Crean also served as captain of the hospital&#x27;s rugby team for four years in the Dublin Hospitals Rugby Cup. He went on to represent Leinster against both Ulster and Munster in 1894, 1895 and 1896. During the 1895–96 season he also played for Richmond, possibly working as a medic in London at the same time. When he moved to South Africa he played for Johannesburg Wanderers.

===Ireland===
Between 1894 and 1896, Crean made 9 appearances and scored two tries for Ireland. He made his international debut on 3 February 1894 in a 7–5 win against England at Blackheath. On 24 February he helped Ireland defeat Scotland 5–0 at Lansdowne Road. Then on 10 March, he helped Ireland win both the 1894 Home Nations Championship and their first ever Triple Crown with a 3–0 win against Wales in Belfast. Among his teammates during the 1894 campaign was Lucius Gwynn. Crean also played in all three games during both the 1895 and 1896 Home Nations Championships. He scored both of his tries against Wales. The first came on 16 March 1895 in a 5–3 defeat at Cardiff Arms Park. Crean showed his strength and drive when he scored Ireland&#x27;s only points by catching a long line-out throw before driving across the line with a number of Welshmen hanging out of him. The second try came at Lansdowne in an 8–4 win on 14 March 1896. The win helped Ireland win their second Home Nations title. This latter game would also be his final appearance for Ireland.

===British Lions===
In 1896 Crean was a member of the British Isles squad on their tour to South Africa. He was part of a strong Irish contingent, being one of nine Irishmen selected. The others included Robert Johnston, Louis Magee, James Magee, Larry Bulger, Jim Sealy, Andrew Clinch, Arthur Meares and Cecil Boyd. He played in all four tests against South Africa and scored a try in the second. The tour captain, Johnny Hammond, only played in seven of the 21 games and Crean took over the captains role in his absence, including for two of the Test games.

==Military career==

===Second Boer War===

When the British Isles tour ended, Crean decided to stay on in South Africa, working as a doctor in a hospital in Johannesburg and playing rugby for Johannesburg Wanderers. In 1899, at the start of the Second Boer War, he enlisted as a trooper in the Imperial Light Horse and took part in both the Relief of Mafeking and the Relief of Ladysmith. On 26 October 1899, according to the &quot;Irish Times&quot;, the Imperial Light Horse particularly distinguished themselves in the Battle of Elandslaagete. The &quot;Irish Times&quot; of the following day reported with regret that the list of wounded included Crean. It was during this engagement that Crean&#x27;s former Wanderers and British Isles&#x27; teammate Robert Johnston won his Victoria Cross. In 1901, he became a Surgeon Captain and on 18 December, at the Battle of Tygerkloof, he won his VC when he successfully attended the wounds of two soldiers and a fellow officer under heavy enemy fire. The citation read:

He was wounded in the stomach and arm during these encounters and was in February 1902 invalided back to England, where he made a full recovery. On 12 March 1902, he was presented with the Victoria Cross by King Edward VII in a ceremony at St. James&#x27;s Palace. One week later, on 20 March 1902, the members of St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital Football Club gave a dinner at the Dolphin Hotel in his honour. In May the same year, he was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. He was appointed a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps on 3 September 1902, and was posted at Aldershot Garrison.

===First World War===
In 1905, Crean married Victoria, daughter of Senor Don Thomas Heredia, of Málaga, Spain, and had two sons, Victor (died young), Patrick, and a daughter, Carmen. Victoria had been a close friend to Crean&#x27;s sister Alice, since their schooling at Roehampton. He transferred to the army reserve on 8 September 1906, and started a private practice in Harley Street. He was later appointed medical officer in charge of the hospital in the Royal Enclosure, Ascot where he once performed a life saving trepanning operation on a jockey who was thrown from his horse during a race. He ran out onto the course in his shirt sleeves and saved the jockey&#x27;s life by removing portions of the bones of his skull with a hammer and chisel. However, following the outbreak of the First World War, he was mobilized with the Royal Army Medical Corps on 12 August 1914. He served with the 1st Cavalry Brigade, being wounded several times and was twice mentioned in despatches. In June 1915 he was made a companion of the Distinguished Service Order. He was promoted to major on 26 February 1916, and commanded the 44th Field Ambulance, British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front.

==Later years==
Crean returned to his practice in Harley Street but by now his war service had begun to seriously affect his health and he was unable to maintain the business. Towards the end of his life, Crean suffered from financial difficulties and in June 1922 he was declared bankrupt. He died from diabetes on 25 March 1923, aged 49, at his residence at 13 Queen Street, Mayfair, London. He is buried in St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery, Kensal Green, (Grave No. 896). His father, Michael Theobald Crean, is buried in the same cemetery but at a different plot. His daughter Carmen died some years later while his wife Victoria and son Patrick moved to Paris for the duration of the 1920s. Following Victoria&#x27;s sudden passing in 1929, Patrick moved back to England and soon began his successful career as an actor and fight master, running the Sophy School of Fencing before emigrating to Canada. 

His VC medal is displayed at the Army Medical Services Museum. On 1 August 2001 the South African Post Office issued a stamp featuring Crean as part of their commemorations for the Second Boer War.

In 2019 his story along with other Wanderers Victoria Cross recipients Robert Johnston and Frederick Maurice Watson Harvey was told in a documentary entitled &quot;Mark Our Place&quot; directed and produced by Ashley Morrison.

<text>Arthur Hutt VC (12 February 1889 – 14 April 1954) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the first person born in Coventry to be awarded the Victoria Cross

==Details==
He was 28 years old, and a private in the 1/7th Battalion of The Royal Warwickshire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place at the battle of Passchendaele for which he was awarded the VC.

On 4 October 1917, at Terrier Farm, south-east of Poelcapelle, during the advance on the villages of Poelcapelle and Passchendaele, Belgium, when all the officers and NCOs of No. 2 Platoon had become casualties, Private Hutt took command of and led the platoon. He was held up by a strong post but immediately ran forward alone and shot the officer and three men in the post; between 40 and 50 others surrendered. Later, having pushed too far, he withdrew his party, covering them by sniping the enemy, and then carried back a wounded man to shelter. After he had consolidated his position, he then went out and carried in four more wounded under heavy fire.

==Further information==

He later achieved the rank of corporal. He is commemorated with a Cornish granite memorial in War Memorial Park, Coventry.

On Wednesday 4 October 2017 a commemorative V.C. Paving stone was lay for Cpl Arthur Hutt at the War Memorial Park in Coventry.

<text>Alan Richard Hill later Hill-Walker, VC (born Northallerton 12 July 1859 – 21 April 1944) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He won the VC for his actions on 28 January 1881 at the Battle of Laing&#x27;s Nek during the First Boer War.

After his marriage in 1902, he adopted the surname Hill-Walker.

==Early life==
Alan Richard Hill was the son of Captain Thomas Hill, chief constable of the North Riding of Yorkshire Constabulary and Frances Mirriam, daughter of Thomas Walker. He was educated at Richmond Grammar School.

Hill was commissioned in July 1876 as a sub-lieutenant in the North York Rifle Militia. He transferred to the 58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot in February 1879. The regiment was deployed to South Africa in 1879 for service in the Anglo-Zulu War and he saw action at the Battle of Ulundi in July 1879.

==Details==

Hill was 21 years old, and a lieutenant in the 58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot (which had become the 2nd Battalion, The Northamptonshire Regiment under the Childers Reforms by the time the award was gazetted), British Army during the First Boer War when the following deed took place on 28 January 1881 at the Battle of Laing&#x27;s Nek, South Africa, for which he was awarded the VC.

The citation reads; &quot;For gallant conduct at the action of Laing&#x27;s Nek on the 28th January, 1881, in having, after the retreat was ordered, remained behind and endeavoured to carry out of action Lieutenant Baillie, of the same Corps, who was lying on the ground severely wounded. Being unable to lift that officer into the saddle, he carried him in his arms until Lieutenant Baillie was shot dead. Lieutenant Hill then brought a wounded man out of action on his horse, after which he returned and rescued another. All these acts being performed under a heavy fire.&quot;

Laing&#x27;s Nek was the last occasion that a British regiment carried its colours into action. The 58th were led up the hillside by Lieutenant Lancelot Baillie carrying the Regimental Colour and Hill carrying the Queen&#x27;s Colour. Baillie was mortally wounded. Hill passed the two colours to Sergeant Budstock for safe keeping.

==Further information==
He was adjutant of the 3rd and 4th battalions from October 1887 and achieved the rank of major in September 1896 before he retired from the army in October 1901.

In April 1902 he married, in London, Muriel Lilias Oliphant Walker (1876–1953), daughter of T. S. Walker, of Maunby Hall, Thirsk, Yorkshire. He changed his name to Hill-Walker. There were two sons:
*Lieutenant-Colonel Gerald Alan Hill-Walker (1903–1980).
*Lieutenant-Commander Thomas Harry Hill-Walker (1904–1940), was killed in action in 1940.

Hill&#x27;s medals were bought in 2015 by the Ashcroft Trust and are displayed in the Imperial War Museum.

<text>Samuel Evans VC (c. 1821 – 4 October 1901) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
He was born Samuel Evens in Paisley, Renfrewshire in 1821, the son of Anne and James Evens, a weaver. He initially followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a weaver of Paisley shawls, but in September 1839 he enlisted in the 26th Regiment of Foot at Gallowgate Barracks, as 1535 Private Evens. He joined his regiment in India in October 1840.

The regiment moved to China and he was part of the China War of 1842. In 1843 the regiment was billeted at Edinburgh Castle and remained there until 1851. In 1852 he volunteered for the 19th Foot Regiment to serve in the Kaffir Wars in South Africa, with a new service no. as 2721 Private Evans, remaining Evans for the rest of his life. In 1854 he sailed to Varna with his regiment to serve in the Crimean War.

==The Winning of the VC==
He was about 34 years old, and a private in the 19th Regiment of Foot (later The Yorkshire Regiment (Alexandra, Princess of Wales&#x27;s Own)), British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 13 April 1855 at Sebastopol, Crimean Peninsula, Private Evans volunteered to go into an embrasure to repair a breach. He and another private went into the battery and leapt into the embrasure, where they carried out the necessary repairs under very heavy enemy fire.

He did not receive the medal until 26 June 1857. He traveled to London from Edinburgh and was presented the medal in a ceremony in Hyde Park, receiving it personally from Queen Victoria.

His Victoria Cross is displayed in the Green Howards Museum, Richmond, Yorkshire, England.

==Later life==
On 8 September 1855 he was severely wounded during the attack on Redan and after some time at Scutari Hospital was returned to Britain. He was discharged from the army, unfit for service, on 13 May 1856. It was while in hospital that he met a widow, Margret McNichol who had been invited to nurse at the Scutari Hospital by Florence Nightingale and upon returning to Edinburgh they were married.

Through various connections (and presumably a degree of fame) he acquired a job as lodge-keeper at Holyrood Palace, living in a charming lodge at the entry to Holyrood Park. In the 1870s he left Edinburgh and bought a shop in Dumfries but this was not a great success.

In 1888 he returned to Edinburgh, living in a humble flat at 332 Lawnmarket on the Royal Mile.

He died in 1901 and is buried with his wife Margaret in Piershill Cemetery in eastern Edinburgh.

<text>George Hollis VC (October 1833 – 16 May 1879) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was about 24 years old, and a Farrier in the 8th Hussars (The King&#x27;s Royal Irish), British Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 17 June 1858 at Gwalior, India for which he was awarded the VC:
Farrier Hollis - together with a captain (Clement Walker Heneage), a sergeant (Joseph Ward) and a private (John Pearson) was in a charge made by a squadron of the 8th Hussars. His citation reads:
==Medal==
In 1994 a man watching racehorses being trained on the Curragh in County Kildare, Ireland, glimpsed a small piece of metal being thrown up with mud by a horse galloping by; this turned out to be a Victoria Cross (minus its bar). It was presumed to have been one of the four awarded to the 8th Hussars, as they were based at the Curragh between 1869 and 1875. Until 1881 soldiers were required to wear all their medals while on duty and it was believed that a member of the Hussars could have lost the medal while training on horseback on the Curragh. It was thought likely that the medal belonged to either George Hollis or John Pearson as the other two medals were accounted for; however, Pearson&#x27;s VC subsequently turned up in auction at 2004, along with his other medals.

<text>Harry Hampton VC (14 December 1870 – 2 November 1922) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Details ==
Hampton was born in Crown Terrace, Richmond (then in Surrey and now in London) on 14 December 1870.

Hampton was 29 years old, and a sergeant in the 2nd Battalion, The King&#x27;s (Liverpool) Regiment, British Army during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place on 21 August 1900 at Van Wyk&#x27;s Vlei, South Africa, for which he was awarded the VC:
He received the decoration from King Edward VII, in person, during an investiture at St James&#x27;s Palace on 17 December 1901.

==Further information==
Hampton later achieved the rank of colour sergeant. He retired from the Army after the First World War and returned to the Richmond area, taking employment in the City of London as a commissionaire with a firm of solicitors. In 1919 whilst dismounting from a bus in Richmond his leg, injured during the Boer War, gave way. He continued to live at the family home of 151 Halliburton Road, St Margarets, Twickenham until his fatal accident in November 1922.

Hampton died in Twickenham on 2 November 1922. Although reported as having taken his own life by jumping in front of a train at Richmond rail station, he did in fact succumb to multiple injuries sustained from falling against a Shepperton train passing through St Margarets railway station in Twickenham. In the subsequent inquest there was no suggestion that he might have taken his own life, the opinion of the coroner being that a leg injured when he had fallen from a bus approximately two years before his death had given way as the Shepperton train passed through St Margarets station.

His funeral was held in St Margarets, after which his coffin was carried on a gun carriage with a military escort. He was conveyed from St Margarets, across Richmond Bridge, and on arriving outside Richmond Town Hall, the Mayor, councillors, and a crowd of several thousand had assembled to pay their respects, many of which then followed the gun carriage to Richmond Cemetery.

He is buried in Richmond Cemetery, but for over 50 years his grave remained unmarked. In 1986 the location of the grave was re-discovered by Ron Buddle, a Metropolitan police officer and Victoria Cross historian who, with financial assistance from the King&#x27;s Regiment Association, erected the present headstone. However, the date of death shown on the headstone of 4 February 1920 was incorrect, the error being corrected when the grave was restored in 2008 as part of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames&#x27; &quot;Adopt a Grave&quot; scheme.

==The medal==
The location of his Victoria Cross is unknown.

<text>Albert Halton VC (1 May 1893 – 24 July 1971) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Halton was born in Warton near Carnforth, Lancashire. He was 24 years old, and a private in the 1st Battalion, the King&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster), British Army during the First Battle of Passchendaele of First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 12 October 1917 near Poelcapelle, Belgium, after the objective had been reached, Private Halton rushed forward about 300 yards under very heavy fire and captured a machine-gun and its crew which was causing heavy losses to our men. He then went out again and brought in 12 prisoners, showing the greatest disregard for his own safety and setting a fine example to those round him.

After the war Halton was an ironworker until his retirement in 1961, and during World War II he served in the Home Guard.

A commemorative plaque was installed in Sparrow Park, Warton, unveiled on 12 October 2017 by the Deputy Mayor of Lancaster.

==The medal==
His VC is displayed at the King&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) Museum, in Lancaster, England.

<text>John Brown Hamilton VC (26 August 1896 – 18 July 1973) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Victoria Cross==
He was 21 years old, and a lance-corporal in the 1/9th (Glasgow Highlanders) Battalion, The Highland Light Infantry, British Army during the First World War, and was awarded the Victoria Cross foe his actions during the Battle of Passchendaele:

On 25/26 September 1917 north of the Ypres-Menin Road, Belgium, great difficulty was experienced in keeping the front and support line supplied with small arm ammunition, owing to the intense artillery fire. At a time when this supply had reached a seriously low level, Lance-Corporal Hamilton on several occasions, on his own initiative, carried bandoliers of ammunition through the enemy&#x27;s belts of fire and then, in full view of their snipers and machine-guns which were lying out in the front of our line at close range, he distributed the ammunition.

==Post war==
He later achieved the rank of sergeant. Between the two World Wars he remained an active reserve and Territorial Army member. At the outbreak of World War II he was in hospital and missed mobilisation, and so missed his unit being captured at St Valerie in the defence of Dunkirk. He eventually was promoted through the ranks and finished the war a Colonel in charge of an Italian prisoner of war camp in England. 

Born and educated in Dumbarton, he had family links to Cambuslang and lived in the town for much of his life (he is commemorated on memorials in both towns). He died at the age of 77.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National War Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh Castle having been delivered there by his daughter and grandson.

<doc id="1218170" wikidata="Q138060" url="?curid=1218170" title="Maximón">
<text>Maximón (), also called San Simón, is a Maya deity, narco-saint, and folk saint, represented in various forms by the Maya peoples of several towns in the Guatemalan Highlands. Oral tradition of his creation and purpose in these communities is complex, diverse, and born of the ancient Maya traditions centuries ago.

==Origin==
The worship of Maximón is believed to have begun at the time of the Spanish conquest of the Maya. The designation of Maximón as a saint is the result of religious syncretism.

The modern character of Maximón is thought by analysts to be a blend of several historical, biblical, and Maya mythological figures. These include Pedro de Alvarado, Judas Iscariot, Saint Peter, and Mam.

Maximón&#x27;s appearance varies greatly by location. While he&#x27;s popularly depicted as a man in a suit and hat, this isn&#x27;t a constant. In Santiago Atitlán, he wears colorful garlands and scarves, while in Zunil, he wears sunglasses and a bandana.

==Mythology==

Maximón is said to represent both light and dark, and to be a trickster. He is both a womanizer and a protector of couples.

According to some legends, Maximón was an elder who reincarnated to protect his people. During the Spanish Conquest, an elder named Ri Laj Mam, upset by the evils of the Spaniards, encouraged his people to start a rebellion. He was eventually executed, but returned to life in the form of a judge named Don Ximon, who fought to give land back to the native people of Guatemala.

Another legend states that Maximón was hired by traveling fishermen to protect the virtue of their wives. Instead, Maximón disguised himself and slept with all of them.

In Santiago Atitlán, an alternative tale says that Maximón was never a man, but a wooden figure created by shamans to defend the village from witches. However, Maximón used trickery to harm the people of the village, so the shamans twisted his head around and broke his legs to stop him. He then did his job properly and protected the people of the town from evil.

==Veneration==

Maximón is venerated in the form of an effigy or cult image. Worship varies greatly by location. In Santiago Atitlán, Maximón&#x27;s effigy resides in a different household every year. His image is normally only taken out of this house during Holy Week, whereafter it will change households, but is on display year-round due to the popularity of pilgrimages. The effigy has special attendants that stay by the altar year-round, drinking and smoking alongside it. They deliver offerings from the public to the image. Popular offerings include money, tobacco, and moonshine.

In the town of San Andrés Itzapa, there is a large temple to Maximón. Here, offerings such as corn, flowers, and candles are burned in public by shamans for the deity. Pilgrims travel to this temple from all across Latin America.

Guatemalan press has claimed that the worship of Maximón has declined in recent decades, but this is difficult to measure with much certainty.

===Outside of Guatemala===
As many Guatemalans have migrated to areas such as Mexico, the United States, and Canada, the veneration of Maximón has traveled beyond the borders of Guatemala, where he is more commonly known as San Simón. There are temples dedicated to him in New York, California, and Florida.

<text>Gabriel Kney (21 November 1929 – 8 November 2024) was a Canadian builder of pipe organs based in London, Ontario.

==Life and career==
Kney was born in Speyer, Germany. At the age of 15, he apprenticed to Paul Sattel of Speyer to become an organ builder, and concurrently studied organ and composition with Erhard Quack and Ludwig Doerr at the Bishop’s Institute for Church Music in Speyer.

In 1951, he moved to Canada to work as a voicer with the Keates Organ Co.

In 1955 he formed with John Bright the Kney and Bright Organ Co to build tracker organs. Blanton (1957) described their first instrument as &quot;a handsome little organ with mechanical action, slider chests, 1-3/4&quot; pressure&quot;. They were at the vanguard of the tracker organ revival in Canada, so much so that they were then to build 30 electro-pneumatic organs before customers caught on and started ordering instruments with mechanical action. In the early 1960s, they rebuilt the organs of Aeolian Hall in London and St Michael&#x27;s Cathedral in Toronto.

In 1967, Kney formed Gabriel Kney Pipe Organ Builders, Ltd., and by 1990 he and his seven employees had built more than 130 organs for customers across the United States and Canada. Some of the best examples of this company&#x27;s designs are the organs of Roy Thomson Hall in Toronto, Ontario, Grace and Holy Trinity Cathedral in Kansas City, Christ Church Parish in Pensacola, Florida, and the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota.

Kney died on 8 November 2024, at the age of 94.

<text>Michael Wilson Heaviside (20 October 1880 – 26 April 1939) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early years==
Heaviside was born in 1880 at Station Lane, Gilesgate in Durham where his father, John Wilson Heaviside, was a grocer. His paternal grandfather was the Durham-based photographer Thomas Heaviside (1828–1886). When Michael was still a boy, the family moved to Kimblesworh, where his father worked as head keeker and Michael went to the local municipal school. Later, the family moved to Sacriston, when his father transferred to the local pit.

Following the death of his mother, Annie, Michael enlisted - as 11796 Private Heaviside - in the Royal Army Medical Corps. He served as a stretcher bearer in South Africa during the Boer War and was awarded the Queen&#x27;s and King&#x27;s South African Medals, before he was invalided home suffering from enteric fever.

After he left the Regular Army, he transferred to the Army Reserve and began work underground at Burnhope Colliery. He met his future wife, Elizabeth, whilst living in Burnhope and they married at Lanchester. About 1913, he took work as a hewer at Oswald pit and the family moved to Craghead, near Stanley.

On 7 September 1914, with the First World War just a month old, 4/9720 Private Michael Heaviside re-enlisted, just one amongst the thousands of miners from County Durham who answered Kitchener&#x27;s call. After training, he crossed to France in June 1915 and there settled into the deadly routine of trench warfare on the Western Front.

==Details==
He was 36 years old, and a Private in the 15th Battalion, The Durham Light Infantry, British Army during the First World War at the Battle of Arras when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On the evening of 5 May 1917, the battalion returned to their barricades on the Hindenburg Line, near Fontaine-les-Croisilles, France. Only one hundred yards separated the British and German positions but the terrible fighting of the preceding days had died down. Snipers and machine gunners were, however, still active and any movement attracted deadly fire. Then about 2 o’clock the next afternoon, 6 May 1917, a sentry noticed movement in a shell hole about forty yards from the German barricade. A wounded British soldier was desperately waving an empty water bottle. Any attempt to help this soldier in daylight would result in almost certain death for the rescuers. Michael Heaviside, however, said that he was going to try. Grabbing water and a first aid bag, the stretcher bearer scrambled over the barricade and out into no-man&#x27;s-land. Immediately, he came under heavy rifle and machine gun fire from the German positions and was forced to throw himself to the ground. He then began to crawl sixty yards across the broken ground from shell hole to shell hole to where the wounded soldier was sheltering. One eyewitness later wrote -

&quot;We could see bullets striking the ground right around the spot over which Heaviside was crawling. Every minute we expected to be his last but the brave chap went on&quot;. As he crawled closer to the German lines, the firing increased. -

&quot;The enemy seemed to be more determined to hit him, for the bullets were spluttering about more viciously than ever&quot;.

When Private Heaviside reached the soldier, he found the man nearly demented with thirst for he had been lying badly wounded in the shell hole for four days and three nights, without any food or water. Michael Heaviside gave the soldier water, dressed his wounds and then promised that he would return with help. That night, Michael Heaviside led two other stretcher bearers out across no-man&#x27;s-land to the wounded soldier and carried him back to safety. Without doubt, he had saved this man&#x27;s life. The London Gazette announced the award of the Victoria Cross to Private Michael Heaviside on 8 June 1917 for his &quot;most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty&quot;. He was the third soldier of The Durham Light Infantry to gain this award during the First World War.

==Death==
After the war, Michael Heaviside VC returned to work as a miner at Craghead. On 26 April 1939, he died at his home at Bloemfontein Terrace, aged just 58 years, his health damaged by his years underground and his time on the Western Front. Hundreds of mourners, many wearing their Great War medals, followed Michael Heaviside&#x27;s coffin to St Thomas&#x27;s Church, Craghead, as the local Colliery Band played the &quot;Dead March in Saul&quot;. At the graveside, a firing party from the 8th Battalion DLI fired three volleys of shots, followed by the &quot;Last Post&quot; played by the battalion&#x27;s buglers, then the mourners filed past, each dropping Flanders poppies into the open grave.

==The medal==

On 12 July 1957, forty years after his &quot;Welcome Home&quot; parade through the streets of Stanley and Craghead, Michael Heaviside&#x27;s Victoria Cross and other medals were presented by his family to The Durham Light Infantry&#x27;s Regimental Museum. This presentation took place during a parade at Brancepeth Castle, when, watched by his mother and over thirty sons, daughters, grandchildren and other relatives of Michael Heaviside VC, Company Sergeant Major Norman Heaviside proudly handed over his father&#x27;s medals.

The Victoria Cross was displayed at the Durham Light Infantry Museum and Durham Art Gallery.
The D.L.I. Museum (now closed) was the official museum of the Durham Light Infantry. Located in Durham the museum housed an extensive array of artifacts and documentation detailing the regiment&#x27;s history. It featured displays on World War I and World War II activities and exhibits included uniforms, weapons, medals, flags, hats, letters, photographs, badges, ceremonial regalia and many other items associated with the regiment. The museum was located on two floors, with the Durham Art Gallery on a third level.
In October 2015 Durham County Council announced the closure of the D.L.I. Museum in a cost saving exercise. This decision sparked the formation of a campaign to save the museum led by John Richardson. The campaign attracted the attention and support of thousands of people from around the world, as well as County Durham itself, who appealed and protested at the County Councils proposed action. The campaign was unsuccessful and the museum closed in March 2016.

Durham Light Infantry (DLI) Collection is now based at Spennymoor. The address of the centre is; DCC DLI Collection, Sevenhills, Greenhills Business Park, Enterprise Way, Spennymoor, Co. Durham DL16 6JB. Tel. 03000 266 231
Details of the facility feature on the pages of the Durham County Council website.

<text>George Morby Ingram, VC, MM (18 March 1889 – 30 June 1961) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. Ingram became Australia&#x27;s final recipient of the Victoria Cross during the First World War following his actions during an attack on the village of Montbrehain in France. Leading a platoon during the engagement, he instigated several charges against a number of German strong points that eventuated in the seizure of ten machine guns and sixty-two prisoners, as well as inflicting high casualties.

Born in the Victorian town of Bendigo, Ingram was apprenticed as a carpenter and joiner upon leaving school. Joining the militia at the age of fourteen, he later settled in Melbourne where he worked as a building contractor. Following the outbreak of the First World War, Ingram enlisted in the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force and served on New Guinea before receiving his discharge in early 1916. Enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force on the same day, he embarked for the Western Front. He was decorated with the Military Medal following his actions as a member of a bombing section during an attack on Bapaume. Commissioned as a second lieutenant in June 1918, Ingram returned to Australia in 1919 where he was discharged soon after. Re-settling in Melbourne, he was employed as a foreman for a building contractor company. Enlisting for service in the Second World War, he was allotted to the Royal Australian Engineers and achieved the rank of captain before being placed on the Retired List in 1944. Ingram died in 1961 at the age of 72.

==Early life==
Ingram was born in Bendigo, Victoria, on 18 March 1889 to George Ronald Ingram, a farmer, and his wife Charlotte (née Hubbard). Initially educated at the Lilydale State School, he left school at age fourteen and was apprenticed as a carpenter and joiner. Joining the militia at this time, he was attached to No. 7 Company of the Australian Garrison Artillery and in 1906 attended a military exhibition in New Zealand as a member of the Australian contingent. Completing his apprenticeship, Ingram moved to Caulfield, Melbourne, where he entered into business as a building contractor. On 19 January 1910, Ingram married Jane Francis Nichols in a Congregational ceremony at East Prahran.

==First World War==
On 10 December 1914, Ingram enlisted as a private in the 3rd Battalion, Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force at South Yarra. Initially posted for service on the newly captured German territory of New Guinea, he returned to Australia 6 December 1915, and was discharged on 19 January with the rank of corporal. That same day, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and was allotted to the 16th Reinforcements of the 24th Battalion as a private. In October, Ingram embarked with the unit from Melbourne aboard HMAT &quot;Nestor&quot;. Arriving in France, he was appointed acting corporal and joined the 24th Battalion in January 1917.

On the night of 15/16 March 1917, Ingram took part in the battalion&#x27;s attack on the village of Bapaume during the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line. Posted to a bombing section during the engagement, he became involved in a fight with German troops who outnumbered his unit. Making effective use of their grenades, the unit was able to hold off the German attack. Later during the assault, the German forces returned in large numbers, forcing the bombing section to retreat. Ingram, in conjunction with two others, covered the party&#x27;s withdrawal which thus minimised casualties. For his actions during the battle, Ingram was awarded the Military Medal, the citation noting his &quot;... great courage and initiative ...&quot;. The announcement of the award was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 11 May 1917.

Promoted to temporary sergeant on 18 March, Ingram fell ill in April and was hospitalised in Britain until June when he was deemed fit to return to his battalion. He was hospitalised once again in September after dislocating his knee, and upon returning to his unit on 10 October he was made company sergeant major. It was at this time that the Australian focus for the remainder of the year was to be the Ypres sector in Belgium, and as such the 24th Battalion participated in the Battle of Passchendaele. During this time, Ingram was recommended for a commission in the 24th Battalion as a second lieutenant, which was confirmed on 20 June 1918. Three days later, however, he was once again admitted to hospital suffering from an illness, and as such was unable to assume his duties as an officer until 12 July when he returned to the battalion.

===Victoria Cross===
On 4 October 1918, the 24th Battalion took part in the attack that captured the Beaurevoir sector in France, and was, therefore, expecting to have a rest the following day when the unit was unexpectedly ordered to take part in another attack. The assault was to commence at 06:05 from the village of Remicourt, and lead to the capture of Montbrehain by the 21st and 24th Battalions with tanks to provide support. The action was to prove the final engagement for the Australian infantry during the war, and it was during this attack that Ingram was to earn the Victoria Cross; the sixty-fourth, and final, Australian to do so during the First World War.

At the designated time, the two infantry battalions commenced the attack under the cover of an artillery barrage. The advance was heavily counter-attacked by German machine gun and artillery fire, but the Australians managed to continue despite the late arrival of the tanks. Approximately from the German trenches, the 24th Battalion&#x27;s B Company—in which Ingram was commanding a platoon—became the object of severe sniper and machine gun fire, halting the unit&#x27;s advance. Under the cover of a Lewis Gun, Ingram dashed ahead of his men and led them against the German strong point. After a fierce fight, the platoon succeeded in capturing nine machine guns and killing all forty-two Germans who had occupied the line; Ingram accounting for at least eighteen of them himself.

Soon after, the company came under heavy fire from an old quarry occupied by over one hundred German soldiers who possessed as many as forty machine guns. Severe casualties were sustained as they began to advance for attack, including the company commander who fell seriously wounded. Taking command of the attack, Ingram rallied the men and rushed forward. Jumping into the quarry, he charged the first post himself, shooting six German soldiers and capturing a machine gun. The German forces were soon overcome, and thirty troops subsequently surrendered.

While his men were clearing up the remaining German positions, Ingram scouted ahead in search of machine gun nests in the village. He soon located one positioned in a house, which had been firing through the cellar ventilator. Managing to enter the house, he shot the gunner through the ventilator. He fired several more shots into the cellar before rushing to the head of the cellar stairs. By thus cutting off any means of escape, a further thirty Germans were taken prisoner.

The battle for Montbrehain raged until 20:00 that night, during which time the line had been linked up and consolidated. The casualties of the 24th Battalion had been so high that two companies of the 27th Battalion had to be attached for support; the 24th Battalion left the frontline for the last time on 6 October.

The full citation for Ingram&#x27;s Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 6 January 1919, it read:

Ingram was promoted to lieutenant on 24 October, and was training away from the frontline with his battalion when the Armistice was signed on 11 November 1918; thus ending the war. On 25 February 1919, Ingram was decorated with his Victoria Cross by King George V in the ballroom of Buckingham Palace. Boarding a troopship bound for Australia soon after, he arrived in Melbourne on 5 March and was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 2 June.

==Later life==

Following his discharge, Ingram re-settled in Melbourne and gained employment as a general foreman with &quot;E. A. &amp; Frank Watts Pty Ltd&quot;, building contractors. In 1926, Ingram&#x27;s marriage with his wife Jane was dissolved upon his instigation on the grounds of desertion on her behalf. On 10 February the following year, he married Lillian Wakeling (née Hart), a widow, at the Methodist parsonage, Malvern; the pair were later to have one son.

On 11 November 1929, Ingram attended the Victoria Dinner for recipients of the Victoria Cross in Melbourne. Following the completion of Melbourne&#x27;s Shrine of Remembrance in 1935, Ingram was chosen as a member of its permanent guard. There had been two hundred and fifty applications for the position, of which only fourteen were appointed; Ingram being one of the earliest. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Ingram once again volunteered his services and enlisted in the militia on 17 November 1939. Posted to a unit in the Royal Australian Engineers, he achieved the rank of captain before being placed on the Retired List on 6 May 1944.

Ingram&#x27;s wife Lillian died in May 1951, and on 24 December of the same year he married another widow, Myrtle Lydia Thomas (née Cornell), in a ceremony at Brunswick Methodist Church; the couple later had a son, Alex. In 1954, Ingram attended the dedication of the Shrine of Remembrance by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh on 28 February following an expansion on the monument to encompass Australia&#x27;s contributions to the Second World War. Two years later, he joined the Australian contingent of Victoria Cross recipients who attended the parade in London&#x27;s Hyde Park to commemorate the centenary of the institution of the Victoria Cross.

Ingram died of coronary vascular disease at his home in Hastings, Victoria, on 30 June 1961, and was buried at Frankston Cemetery. He is commemorated by a street name in Canberra. On 27 May 2008, the Victoria Cross, Military Medal and campaign medals awarded to Ingram were sold at auction by Sotheby&#x27;s of Melbourne for A$478,000. The medals were sold on behalf of Ingram&#x27;s son, Alex, who was concerned about the security of the group and was experiencing financial strain. The purchaser, rumoured to be media mogul Kerry Stokes, indicated that the Victoria Cross would be donated to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. This subsequently took place, and Ingram&#x27;s medals are displayed in the Memorial&#x27;s Hall of Valour.

<text>Phillip Davey, (10 October 1896 – 21 December 1953) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces at the time. Davey enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in December 1914 for service in World War I, and joined his unit, the 10th Battalion, on the island of Lemnos on 10 April 1915. Along with his battalion, he landed at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, on 25 April. He fought at Anzac until he was evacuated sick in early November, returning to Australia the following January.

Davey embarked for England in June 1916, and rejoined his battalion on the Western Front in October. In January 1918 he was awarded the Military Medal for bravery in rescuing a wounded man under fire. He was promoted to corporal in April. In the lead-up to the capture of Merris in June, he killed an eight-man German machine-gun crew, saving his platoon from annihilation, for which he was awarded the VC. During this action he was severely wounded. He returned to Australia to be discharged, and was employed by South Australian Railways over many years before dying in 1953, having suffered for years with bronchitis and emphysema. He was buried with full military honours in the AIF Cemetery, West Terrace. His medals are displayed in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial.

==Early life==
Phillip Davey was born on 10 October 1896 at Unley, South Australia, to William George Davey, a carpenter, and his wife Elizabeth, O&#x27;Neill; he was one of five sons of the couple who would see service in World War I. Phillip attended Flinders Street Model School and Goodwood Public School. After his schooling, he was involved in well boring and opal mining in Central Australia; at the outbreak of World War I he was a horse driver.

==World War I==
On 22 December 1914, aged 18, Davey enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and was posted to the 2nd reinforcements to the 10th Battalion. He sailed for Egypt from Melbourne on 2 February 1915. He joined the 3rd Brigade&#x27;s 10th Battalion on board the in the port of Mudros on the island of Lemnos in the northeastern Aegean Sea on 10 April 1915. The 3rd Brigade had been chosen as the covering force for the landing at Anzac Cove, Gallipoli, on 25 April. The brigade embarked on the battleship and the destroyer , and after transferring to strings of rowing-boats initially towed by steam pinnaces, the battalion began rowing ashore at about 4:30am.

Davey participated in the heavy fighting at the landing and subsequent trench warfare defending the beachhead. After several bouts of illness, he was evacuated to Egypt with enteric fever in early November. In January 1916 he was repatriated to Australia to recover his health. He re-embarked at Melbourne in June, arrived in the United Kingdom in August, and embarked for France the following month. While he had been recuperating, the infantry formations of the AIF had been withdrawn from Gallipoli to Egypt, then transferred to the Western Front in France and Belgium. Davey rejoined the 10th Battalion in early October.

From the time Davey returned, the 10th Battalion rotated through front-line, reserve, training and fatigue duties, mainly in the Somme river sector. In February 1917, it participated in an operation at Le Barque, southwest of Bapaume. On 15 March, Davey was accidentally wounded by a hand grenade while the battalion was in camp, but returned to duty less than a month later, during the Battle of Arras. He was promoted to lance corporal in early May, at which time the battalion was fighting in a support role at Bullecourt. In September, the battalion was committed to the Passchendale offensive, specifically at the Battle of Menin Road at Polygon Wood. The following month Davey was gassed while the 10th Battalion was relieving troops in the front-line near Westhoek Ridge; he returned to his unit in early November.

Through the winter of 1917/1918, the battalion rotated through various duties, in and out of the front-line. On 3 January 1918, Davey rescued a wounded soldier under heavy fire, and was awarded the Military Medal (MM) for bravery in the field. The recommendation read: 

Davey was promoted to corporal on 24 April 1918, and that night the 10th Battalion conducted an operation near Méteren. The following month he was detached to Tidworth in England as an instructor, but returned to his unit at his own request on 23 June. Five days later, he was with his battalion during a &quot;peaceful penetration&quot; operation near Merris. Over the previous 18 months, the 10th Battalion had developed raising and patrolling skills that were critical in this type of more open warfare. The 10th&#x27;s commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Maurice Wilder-Neligan, initially ordered a platoon to secure a position around a hedge. As this was successful, and another platoon achieved similar success, he then committed two companies to the operation, covered by a smoke screen and trench mortar fire. One platoon reached the hedge, and began to dig in, when a nearby machine gun opened fire, killing the platoon commander, causing other casualties and scattering the platoon. Davey then went forward alone twice, and using hand grenades, killed the crew and captured the machine gun. He then turned it on a German counter-attack, which was repelled.

Davey&#x27;s actions in single-handedly eliminating a German machine gun post resulted in the award of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces at the time. He was initially recommended for the Distinguished Conduct Medal, but when the recommendation reached the commander of XV Corps, Lieutenant General Henry de Beauvoir De Lisle, he upgraded it to a recommendation for the VC and noted, &quot;[a] most gallant and self-sacrificing action&quot;. The citation read: 

Davey&#x27;s platoon was soon relieved by a reserve platoon that re-established the post. The 10th Battalion operation had seized of the German front line, along with thirty-five prisoners, six machine guns and two &quot;Minenwerfer&quot; trench mortars, for the loss of fifty casualties. Davey had sustained wounds to his back, abdomen and legs, and was evacuated to England. After he had recovered sufficiently he received his VC at Buckingham Palace on 12 September. On this occasion, Wilder-Neligan wrote a note to Davey which said: 

Davey then embarked to return to Australia in October, and was discharged from the AIF on 24 February 1919. A fellow VC recipient, Arthur Blackburn later said, &quot;I think all agree that no VC was ever better earned than Phil Davey&#x27;s&quot;. Four of Davey&#x27;s brothers had also enlisted, Claude, Richard, Joseph and Arthur, with Joseph being aged 16 when he joined up. Joseph was wounded at Pozières and was promoted to lance corporal before his real age was discovered and he was sent home. Phillip&#x27;s brothers Claude and Richard were also awarded the MM during World War I, Claude being killed in action in 1917.

==Later life==

After returning from the war, Davey worked for South Australian Railways as a labourer and linesman over three periods between 1926 and 1946: 27 April 1926 to 4 October 1938; 6 March 1939 to 12 February 1942; and 17 December 1943 to 22 February 1946. He married Eugene Agnes Tomlinson on 25 August 1928; they had no children. After suffering for many years with bronchitis and emphysema, Davey died on 21 December 1953 of a coronary occlusion. He was buried at the West Terrace AIF Cemetery, Adelaide, with full military honours.

As well as the VC, MM, 1914–15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal for his service in World War I, Davey was later awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal and Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. His medal set, including his VC, was presented to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra in 1967, and is displayed in the Hall of Valour.

<text>David Philip Hirsch VC (28 December 1896 – 23 April 1917) was a British Army officer during World War I and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Hirsch was born 28 December 1896 to Harry and Edith Hirsch of Weetwood Grove, Leeds.

He was 20 years old, and an Acting Captain in the 4th Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (Alexandra, Princess of Wales&#x27;s Own), British Army during the First World War. On 23 April 1917 near Wancourt, France, he performed a deed for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross. He died in action that day.

===Citation===
==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Green Howards Regimental Museum, Richmond, North Yorkshire, England.

Hirsch came from a Jewish family - his father and grandparents were Jews but father converted; nevertheless, ethnically he was at least half Jewish and I attach the following anecdote. I gave a lecture to the Army Museum Friends in Chelsea in 2008 and a very elderly 96 year old lady was sitting alone at the front. I engaged her in conversation asking what her interest was in my talk which was on Jewish Commandos the SIG in WW2 - and she said she was the first cousin of Hirsch VC and knew him when she was a little girl and saw him on his last leave before he was killed. She said he always attended the family Passover services and meals and identified as Jewish. It would be appropriate to place a Star of David British Legion peg by his memorial, rather than pretend he had no Jewish close links. Signed Martin Sugarman (AJEX Archivist and Author - 8/8/2024). In a book by Dr Harold Pollins of Ruskin College Oxford, the Hirsch family history is detailed in one chapter and is kept at the Imperial War Museum in London

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Reginald Leonard Haine (10 July 1896 – 12 June 1982) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==First World War service==
Haine was 20 years old, and a second lieutenant in the 1st Battalion, Honourable Artillery Company, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 28/29 April 1917 near Gavrelle, France, when British troops were holding a salient which was being repeatedly counter-attacked by German forces, Second Lieutenant Haine organised and led six bombing attacks against a German strong point and captured the position, together with 50 prisoners and two machine-guns. The enemy at once counter-attacked and regained the lost ground, but Second Lieutenant Haine formed a &quot;block&quot; in his trench and for the whole of the following night maintained his position. Next morning he again attacked and recaptured the position. His splendid example inspired his men during more than 30 hours of continuous fighting.

He can be heard recounting some of his First World War experiences in Peter Jackson&#x27;s film &quot;They Shall Not Grow Old&quot;.

Haine was later attached to the 35th Sikhs, Indian Army and was awarded the Military Cross for his actions on the North West Frontier of India at Dakka, 17 May 1919. The citation for the medal reads:

He is remembered on the Imperial War Museums&#x27; site &quot;We remember Reginald Leonard Haine&quot;.

==Subsequent career==
He later achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel and commanded a Home Guard battalion during the Second World War. In later life he became a chartered accountant.

==Medal==
The medal has been loaned by the family to the Imperial War Museum in London. A copy is on display at Headquarters, Honourable Artillery Company, Armoury House, London.

While serving as a corporal in the 11th (Service) Battalion, Suffolk Regiment, British Army during the First World War, he was seriously wounded during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and invalided back to England, spending several months in hospital. Upon discharge, he returned to duty in Northern France.

On 26 August 1917, east of Hargicourt, France, Day was in command of a bombing section detailed to clear a maze of trenches still held by the enemy; this he did, killing two machine gunners and taking four prisoners. Immediately after he returned to his section, a stick bomb fell into a trench occupied by five men, one badly wounded. The corporal seized the bomb and threw it over the trench where it immediately exploded. He afterwards completed the clearing of the trench and established himself in an advanced position, remaining for 66 hours at his post, which came under intense fire.

==Death==
He died in Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Hospital on 17 July 1959, aged 68, and is buried in Milton Cemetery, Portsmouth.

Born at Ladywood in Birmingham on 24 August 1888, he attended St. Philip&#x27;s School (more correctly St Philip&#x27;s Grammar School), Edgbaston. He married Mabel Saunderson in May 1915.
He joined the Post Office and worked as a Clerical Assistant in the North Midland Engineering District.

==World War I==
Knight was 29 years old, and a sergeant in the 2/8th (City of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (Post Office Rifles), British Army during the First World War when the action took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 20 September 1917 at Alberta Section, Ypres, Belgium, when his platoon came under very heavy fire from an enemy machine-gun, Sergeant Knight rushed through his unit&#x27;s own barrage and captured the emplacement single-handed. He performed several other acts of conspicuous bravery single-handed, all under heavy machine-gun and rifle fire and without regard to personal safety. All the platoon officers of the company had become casualties before the first objective was reached, and this NCO took command not only of all the men of his own platoon but of the platoons without officers and his energy in consolidating and reorganising was untiring.

He later achieved the rank of second lieutenant.

==Later life==
After the war he was transferred to the Ministry of Labour and was Manager of the Employment Exchange at
When he retired in 1951 he was Senior Wages Inspector in the Midlands section of the Ministry of Labour. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1951. Alfred Knight was a member of the Catholic organisation &quot;The Catenian Association&quot; holding a number of senior offices.

In 2005, Birmingham City Council named a street in his honour on the Park Central development in Ladywood, where Alfred Knight grew up.

In 2017, Royal Mail dedicated a postbox in honour of Knight. The postbox is located at the corner of Islington Row Middleway and Tennant Street, Birmingham, B15 1LA, on the street where Alfred lived when he worked for the GPO (although the same press release states that he was working as a clerk in Nottingham when he enlisted in the 2/8th Battalion of the Post Office Rifles.).

Alfred Knight died at home at the age of 72. He is buried in Oscott Catholic Cemetery, New Oscott, Birmingham.

==The Medal==
His medal is held by the British Postal Museum &amp; Archive.

<text>John Leak, VC (20 October 1972) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded at that time to a member of the Australian armed forces. Leak enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in early 1915, and served with the 9th Battalion in the Gallipoli Campaign during the First World War. Evacuated suffering from dysentery, Leak rejoined his battalion after it had been withdrawn to Egypt. Along with his unit, he transferred to the Western Front in France and Belgium, where he participated in the Battle of Pozières in July 1916. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the battle. The following month he was seriously wounded in the Battle of Mouquet Farm.

Leak was evacuated to the United Kingdom, and did not return to his unit until October 1917. Suffering from the effects of his service, Leak was convicted of desertion by a court-martial in November, but his sentence was ultimately suspended, and he returned to the 9th Battalion. In early March 1918 he was gassed, and did not rejoin to his unit until the Armistice of 11 November 1918. He returned to Australia and was discharged in 1919.

After jobs in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia over the next twenty years, Leak settled in South Australia in 1937. He was severely affected by his war experiences, and was very reticent to discuss his VC exploits. He did not talk about his service, even to his family, until very late in life. He died in October 1972 and is buried in Stirling, South Australia.

==Early life==

According to his war record, John Leak was born in Portsmouth, United Kingdom, around 1892, although there is no record of his birth in that city. He was the son of a miner, James Leak. His parents were originally from South Wales, and apparently migrated to New South Wales, Australia, well before World WarI, although there is no record of his arrival in Australia. By the outbreak of the war, his parents had died, and Leak was living at Clermont, Queensland, and working as a teamster.

==World War I==

On 28 January 1915, Leak enlisted in Rockhampton as a private in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and was assigned to the fifth reinforcement draft for the 9th Battalion, 3rd Brigade, 1st Division. On 16 April, he embarked from Brisbane, Queensland, on board the transport &quot;Kyarra&quot;. He joined his battalion on 22 June while it was involved in trench warfare defending the Anzac Cove beachhead on the Gallipoli Peninsula in the Ottoman Empire. This fighting was part of the Gallipoli Campaign. Six days after Leak&#x27;s arrival, the 9th Battalion was involved in a two-pronged attack against the Ottoman positions on what were known as &quot;Sniper&#x27;s Ridge&quot; and &quot;Knife Edge&quot;, close to Lone Pine. The attack was abortive, and resulted in the battalion suffering casualties of 37 killed and 62 wounded. Leak was with his battalion during the fruitless August Offensive, which was intended as a breakout from the beachhead. On 31 August, Leak reported sick and was evacuated with gastroenteritis, first via hospital ship to Malta, where he was hospitalised and diagnosed with dysentery. In late September he was evacuated to the United Kingdom where he was again hospitalised. He did not return to his unit until 23 February 1916, by which time it, along with the rest of the AIF, had been withdrawn back to Egypt for re-organisation.

In March 1916, Leak and the rest of his battalion sailed for France and the Western Front. They spent several weeks in a quiet sector of the line near Armentières, before deploying south to the Somme river valley, where they experienced their first fighting in France. On 1July, the Battle of the Somme commenced. This mainly British offensive involved attacks against German trench systems on either side of the Somme. British troops pushed slowly forward towards Bapaume until they were just short of the village of Pozières, at which time the Australian 1st Division entered the fray in the Battle of Pozières. The German positions at Pozières were known as the &quot;Old German&quot; (OG) trenchesOG1 and OG2. The Australians launched a preliminary operation on 22 July, but were repulsed. The following day, the division attacked again, this time with the 1st Brigade on the left, and the 3rd Brigade on the right. Leak&#x27;s battalion was allocated a sector on the far right flank of the divisional attack. The troops captured the first objective, but were held up by a German position where OG1 met &quot;Pozières Trench&quot;.
The 9th Battalion was being held up by a pair of German machine guns. An intense bomb (hand grenade) fight began, during which the heavier Mills bombs used by the Australians were outranged by the lighter German Model 17 grenades. Leak ran forward and threw three Mills bombs into the machine gun post, then leapt into the post, attacking the garrison with his bayonet. By the time the rest of his platoon got to the post, Leak was wiping blood off his bayonet with his slouch hat. The fighting around Pozières continued after this incident, and two days later
the Germans laid down a tremendous artillery barrage on the positions that had been captured from them, described by the official Australian war correspondent, Charles Bean, as &quot;among the heaviest that occurred either on the Somme or at Verdun&quot;. During the fighting and the subsequent deluge of shells, the 9th Battalion had been reduced from a strength of 1,016 men to 623.

On 31 July, Leak was recommended for the award of the Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions at Pozières. At that time, the VC was the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces.

After Pozières, the 9th Battalion was relieved, but it was back in action in mid-August during the Battle of Mouquet Farm. During this fighting, the 9th Battalion suffered another 163 casualties. One of those casualties was Leak, who had suffered a serious wound to the back on 21 August, during a German artillery bombardment near the &quot;Gibraltar&quot; blockhouse. While he was in a medical facility in France, his VC was gazetted. The citation read:

Leak was evacuated to hospital in the United Kingdom on 13 September. On 4November, he was invested with his VC by King George V at Buckingham Palace. While in the UK, he breached military discipline on two occasions. In the first instance, he was charged for entering the Sergeants&#x27; Mess and demanding a drink, and disobeying his regimental sergeant major in January 1917. For this he was convicted and underwent fourteen days&#x27; detention. On 23 February, he went absent without leave until 2March, and following this conviction was punished with four days&#x27; detention and fifteen days&#x27; loss of pay.

On 23 March, Leak was transferred from the 9th Battalion to the 69th Battalion. The 69th Battalion was being raised in the United Kingdom as part of the short-lived 16th Brigade, 6th Division, which was being formed using men who were recovering from wounds or illness in the United Kingdom. In June, Leak gave evidence at the trial of an Australian soldier accused of wearing a VC ribbon on his uniform when he was not a recipient of the award. In his evidence, Leak said he had never asked the man about his VC, because &quot;he objected to [being] questioned himself about his own deed.&quot; He went absent without leave again in July, but this time only received a fine. The 69th Battalion was disbanded to provide reinforcements to existing units, and on 11 August Leak was transferred back to the 9th Battalion and marched out to the Overseas Training Depot.

Leak returned to the Western Front in October, after his battalion had fought in the Battles of Broodseinde and Passchendaele in Belgium. By this stage, Leak was clearly affected by combat-related trauma and was not coping with the effects of the relentless shell-fire, and went absent without leave from his unit as it deployed forward into the front line to relieve Canadian troops on 1November. He was arrested five days later, was court-martialled on 23 November, and found guilty of desertion from the line between 1and 6November. During his trial, Leak said he was unable to stand artillery fire. His sentence was life imprisonment, but this was commuted to two years hard labour. Ultimately, the sentence was suspended, and Leak returned to his unit on 23 December. Leak continued to serve on the Western Front with his battalion until 7March 1918, when he was gassed during a lengthy bombardment of his unit&#x27;s positions near Hollebeke. Medically evacuated to the United Kingdom once again, he did not return to his unit before the Armistice of 11 November 1918.

On 30 December 1918, after his court-martial sentence was finally remitted, Leak married Beatrice May Chapman in Cardiff, Wales. On 9February 1919, Leak and Beatrice sailed for Australia aboard the , arriving in Queensland on 26 March. On 10 April, he attended a reception in his honour at Rockhampton, but declined to speak, then returned to Clermont by train. He was discharged from the AIF on 31 May. In addition to his VC, he received the 1914–15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal.

==Later life and legacy==

For a short time, Leak was involved in a firewood business with a couple of other returned servicemen, then spent time working in regional New South Wales. Next, he moved to remote mid-north South Australia where he found work boring wells. At some point he and his wife separated; it is unknown what happened to her. On 12 January 1927, he married Ada Victoria Bood-Smith; the couple were devoted to one another. In 1932, they moved to Esperance, Western Australia, where Leak worked in a garage. In 1937, Leak was awarded the King George VI Coronation Medal. In the same year, the Leak family moved back to South Australia, and settled near Crafers. They had eight children in total, although their first died within a year of her birth; the last was born in 1946.

Leak struggled his whole life with his war experiences, and was reluctant to talk about them for many years. One of his sons observed that &quot;World War One destroyed him.&quot; He did not attend reunions or Anzac Day marches, and faded into obscurity. Later in life he shared some of his experiences with his children, remembering dead comrades and also those he had killed. He stored his VC in a box in his bedroom and it largely stayed there. In later life, Leak suffered from bronchitis and emphysema caused by his gassing in 1918. In 1953, Leak was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. In 1964, Ada died suddenly. Two years later, a fake VC with Leak&#x27;s name engraved on it surfaced in Melbourne, Victoria; the dealer was fined for being in possession of a forged VC. 

On 20 October 1972, Leak died at Redwood Park and was buried alongside Ada in the Stirling cemetery.

A street in Gallipoli Barracks in Enoggera, Queensland, is named after him. The John Leak monument was unveiled in Rockhampton on 20 April 2012 to honour Leak, who enlisted in the city. In 2015, while delivering the Ode of Remembrance, Leak&#x27;s grandson Peter Townsend said his family always travel to Rockhampton for the Remembrance Day service, which is held annually at his grandfather&#x27;s memorial. As of 2018, Leak&#x27;s medals were in private hands.

<text>Herbert Stephen Henderson VC (30 March 1870 – 10 August 1942) was a Scottish-born Rhodesian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest British and Commonwealth award. Henderson was born in Glasgow and educated at Kelvinside Academy in Glasgow.

==Details==

Henderson was 26 years old, and a trooper in the Rhodesia Horse, Bulawayo Field Force during the Matabeleland Rebellion, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 30 March 1896 at Campbell&#x27;s Store, near Bulawayo, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), a patrol which had been sent to the rescue of another beleaguered patrol, was surprised by rebels and Trooper Henderson and another trooper were cut off from the main party. The second trooper was shot through the knee and his horse killed, so Trooper Henderson put the wounded man on his own horse, and, walking beside it, made his way to Bulawayo, 35 miles away. They had to move principally by night, as the country was full of marauding rebels and they had no food for two days and one night.

He was involved in the mining industry. He was prevented from serving in World War I as he was working in a reserved occupation.

==Medal==

His VC is on display at the National Army Museum in Chelsea, London.

<text>Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg (4 August 1876, Helsinki – 24 December 1932, Helsinki) was a Finnish mathematician known for work on the central limit theorem.

==Life and work==
Lindeberg was son of a teacher at the Helsinki Polytechnical Institute and at an early age showed mathematical talent and interest. The family was well off and later Jarl Waldemar would prefer to be a reader than a full professor. Lindeberg&#x27;s career centred on the University of Helsinki. His early interests were in partial differential equations and the calculus of variations but from 1920 he worked in probability and statistics. In 1920 he published his first paper on the central limit theorem. His result was similar to that obtained earlier by Lyapunov whose work he did not then know. However, their approaches were quite different; Lindeberg&#x27;s was based on a convolution argument while Lyapunov used the characteristic function. Two years later Lindeberg used his method to obtain a stronger result: the so-called &quot;Lindeberg condition&quot;. His work on probability led to him becoming involved in applied fields. He developed what we know as Kendall&#x27;s τ and he found the first two moments of its sampling distribution. Lindeberg used line transect methods in forestry, and when in 1926 determining the necessary number of transects to obtain a sufficiently precise confidence interval, he seems to have rediscovered Student&#x27;s t-distribution.

The Swedish mathematician Harald Cramér met Lindeberg in 1922. He later recalled this story about Lindeberg and the beautiful farm he owned. &quot;When he was reproached for not being sufficiently active in his scientific work, he said &#x27;Well, I am really a farmer.&#x27; And if somebody happened to say that his farm was not properly cultivated, his answer was &#x27;Of course my real job is to be a professor.&#x27; I was very fond of him and saw him often during the following years.&quot;

Lindeberg&#x27;s work was unknown to Alan Turing, who proved the central limit theorem in his dissertation in 1935.

<doc id="1218211" wikidata="Q5674334" url="?curid=1218211" title="Hartcliffe">
<text>Hartcliffe is an outer suburb of the city of Bristol, England, on the southern edge of the city at the foot of Dundry Hill. It is a post-World War II development consisting largely of council houses. It is one of the poorer areas of Bristol, with significant social problems exacerbated by the decline of industrial employment in the city.

Hartcliffe was also the name of an electoral ward for Bristol City Council from 1999 to 2016. The ward contained the areas of Hartcliffe and Headley Park as well as small portions of Withywood and Bishopsworth. Since 2016, Hartcliffe has been in Hartcliffe and Withywood electoral ward.

==History ==

In 1951, of Bishopsworth parish were transferred from Somserset to Bristol, and construction started in 1952 after the compulsory purchase of the farms on this land. A small shopping area was built at Symes Avenue, and the first church (St Andrew) opened in 1956.
Imperial Tobacco once had offices and a factory in Hartcliffe. Part of the site is now the Imperial Retail Park while the listed headquarters building has been converted into the Lakeshore flats.

==Community facilities==
Hartcliffe and Withywood Community Partnership (HWCP) was formed by local residents in 1998 to help support the regeneration and renewal of the area.

Schools within Hartcliffe include Fair Furlong Primary School, Hareclive Academy, and Bridge Learning Campus.

Hartcliffe Community Farm was opened in 1979 by Hartcliffe Community Council leader Doris Fiedor (1919–1995) who founded the community farm. It has over of land based at the farmyard at the top of Lampton Avenue, Hartcliffe. A 250-year-old tithe barn was erected at the farm by YTS trainees but burned down in an arson attack. The farm remains open daily to the public and hosts regular visits by school parties.

Symes Avenue is the district shopping centre serving the outer estates of Hartcliffe and Withywood with a total population of around 20,000 people. In 2007, a Morrisons supermarket and a new library opened as part of a redevelopment project.

==Economic and social deprivation==
The estates have long been identified as suffering a multitude of different problems which characterise a socially excluded community.

On 16 July 1992 there was a riot in Hartcliffe after two men who were riding a stolen and unmarked police motorbike were killed in a chase with an unmarked police car. The disturbance lasted for three days. Police were stoned and many shops in the Symes Avenue shopping centre were attacked and destroyed. Around the same time, Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown claimed that health indicators in the area were comparable to those of a Third World country.

According to crime statistics between 2017 and 2018, The Groves in Hartcliffe is considered one of Bristol&#x27;s ten most dangerous streets.

<doc id="1218214" wikidata="Q186095" url="?curid=1218214" title="Hong Kong Phooey">
<text>Hong Kong Phooey is an American Saturday morning animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and originally broadcast on ABC. The original episodes aired from September 7 to December 21, 1974, and then in repeats until 1976. The show was brought back in reruns in 1978 and 1981, and was included in the USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Cartoon Express&quot; block throughout the 1980s. The main character, Hong Kong Phooey, is the clownishly clumsy secret identity of Penrod &quot;Penry&quot; Pooch, an anthropomorphic dog working at a police station as a &quot;mild-mannered&quot; janitor under the glare of Sergeant Flint, nicknamed &quot;Sarge&quot;.

Penry disguises himself as Hong Kong Phooey by jumping into a filing cabinet – in so doing he always gets stuck, and is freed by his striped pet cat named Spot – and once disguised, gets equipped with the &quot;Phooeymobile&quot; vehicle that transforms itself into a boat, a plane or a telephone booth, depending on the circumstances.

In fighting crime, he relies on his copy of &quot;The Hong Kong Book of Kung Fu&quot;, a correspondence-course martial-arts instruction handbook. However, his successes are only either thanks to Spot, who provides a solution to the challenges, or the direct result of a comically unintended side effect of his efforts. The humor of the incompetence of Hong Kong Phooey is a recurring theme of each episode. The backgrounds were designed by Lorraine Andrina and Richard Khim.

==Plot==
Each episode begins with Rosemary, the somewhat ditzy telephone operator, getting a call about a crime which she explains to Sergeant Flint. Penry, the janitor, overhears the conversation and proceeds to transform himself into the crime-fighting canine (on whom Rosemary has a crush) by slipping into the hidden room behind the vending machine, then jumping into the bottom drawer of his filing cabinet, getting stuck, and, with help from Spot, coming out of the top drawer. Sometimes Spot is annoyed by Hong Kong Phooey for his bumbling but always ends up saving him.

After sliding behind an ironing board to the floor below, he bounces off an old sofa, through an open window, into a dumpster outside, and emerges driving his Phooeymobile. Even when he crashes into, harms, or otherwise inconveniences a civilian, the passer-by feels honored, as opposed to being annoyed or embarrassed, when they see who did it. One example was when he drove the Phooeymobile through wet cement, splattering the workers: they responded that it was an &quot;honor to have a whole day&#x27;s work ruined by the great Hong Kong Phooey&quot;. Despite his blatant lack of talent or intelligence, Hong Kong Phooey is feared by criminals and admired by citizens, but annoys Sergeant Flint, who sees him only as a hindrance to the police, and as evidenced in the final episode &quot;Comedy Cowboys&quot;, Flint takes pleasure in arresting the framed hero (though he is later exonerated). Sometimes Sergeant Flint does admire Hong Kong Phooey for helping them catch the bad guys and bringing them to justice.

==Production==
Originally the show was meant to be a vehicle for Huckleberry Hound, playing the titular Hong Kong Phooey, until it was decided to make it more original.

Hong Kong Phooey is voiced by Scatman Crothers. Sergeant Flint is voiced by Joe E. Ross, who was best known as Officer Gunther Toody in the early 1960s television series &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot; As Flint, Ross revived Toody&#x27;s famous &quot;Ooh! Ooh!&quot; exclamation, which he had also used when playing mess sergeant Rupert Ritzik in &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot;.

The final episode, &quot;Comedy Cowboys&quot;, was intended as a backdoor pilot for a new series. In this two-part episode, new characters Honcho, The Mystery Maverick, and the Posse Impossible, appear and help to clear Hong Kong Phooey of a crime. These characters later appear in their own continuing segment, &quot;Posse Impossible&quot; on &quot;CB Bears&quot;. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show uses the limited Hanna-Barbera laugh track.

==Music==
The show&#x27;s opening theme, titled &quot;Hong Kong Phooey&quot;, was written and composed by Hoyt Curtin, William Hanna, and Joseph Barbera, and sung by Crothers. For the end credits, a shortened instrumental version of the same song was used. A cover performed by Sublime is included on the 1995 tribute album &quot;Saturday Morning: Cartoons&#x27; Greatest Hits,&quot; produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records.

==Episodes==
==Home media==
On August 15, 2006, Warner Home Video released the complete series on 2-disc DVD in Region 1. The DVD set includes commentary on select episodes as well as a documentary of the show from its development through its legacy. The set also includes production designs, never-before-seen original artwork, new interviews, and the special feature &quot;Hong Kong Phooey—The Batty Bank Gang: The Complete Storyboard&quot;. The series is also available in the UK as a Region 2 two-disc set with the special features removed, and as two separate volumes in Region 4. The shorts &quot;Car Thieves&quot; and &quot;Zoo Story&quot; were also released on a 1970s Saturday morning cartoon compilation.

==Other media==
With a copyright of 2001, Alan Lau, in conjunction with Wildbrain.com, produced a flash animation webshow cartoon that was prominently featured on CartoonNetwork.com, and could still be found there as of the middle of June 2015. While Penry appears identical to the original incarnation, Hong Kong Phooey is a much larger, cut, and highly competent and skilled fighter—even without Spot the cat. Hong Kong Phooey faces off against and easily defeats evil anthropomorphic animals: a trio of rabbits, what appears to be a crane, and a reptilianoid (that appears to be a Komodo dragon). At the end he morphs back to Penry with a smile and sparkle in his eye.

<doc id="1218219" wikidata="Q5150922" url="?curid=1218219" title="Operation PBFortune">
<text>Operation PBFortune, also known as Operation Fortune, was a covert United States operation to overthrow the democratically elected Guatemalan President Jacobo Árbenz in 1952. The operation was authorized by U.S. President Harry Truman and planned by the Central Intelligence Agency. The United Fruit Company had lobbied intensively for the overthrow because land reform initiated by Árbenz threatened its economic interests. The US also feared that the government of Árbenz was being influenced by communists.

The coup attempt was planned with the support of the United Fruit Company and of Anastasio Somoza García, Rafael Trujillo and Marcos Pérez Jiménez, the US-backed right-wing dictators of Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela respectively, who felt threatened by the democratic Guatemalan Revolution, and had sought to undermine it. The plan involved providing weapons to the exiled Guatemalan military officer Carlos Castillo Armas, who was to lead an invasion from Nicaragua.

The US State Department discovered that details of the plan had become widely known. US Secretary of State Dean Acheson became concerned that the coup attempt would damage the image of the US, which had committed to a policy of non-intervention, and so terminated the operation. Operation PBFortune was followed two years later by Operation PBSuccess, another covert operation in which Castillo Armas played a prominent role. PBSuccess toppled the Árbenz government and ended the Guatemalan Revolution.

==Background==
 
From the late 19th century until 1944, a series of authoritarian rulers governed Guatemala. Between 1898 and 1920, Manuel Estrada Cabrera granted significant concessions to the United Fruit Company and dispossessed many indigenous peoples of their communal land. Under Jorge Ubico, who ruled as a dictator between 1931 and 1944, this process was intensified with the institution of brutal labor regulations and the establishment of a police state.

In June 1944, a popular pro-democracy movement led by university students and labor organizations forced Ubico to resign. Ubico handed over power to a military junta that was toppled in a military coup led by Jacobo Árbenz in October 1944, an event known as the October Revolution. The coup leaders called for open elections, which were won by Juan José Arévalo, a progressive professor of philosophy who had become the face of the popular movement. He implemented a moderate program of social reform, including a successful literacy campaign and largely free elections, although illiterate women were not given the vote, and communist parties were banned.

Following the end of Arévalo&#x27;s highly popular presidency in 1951, Árbenz was elected president. He continued the reforms of Arévalo and also began an ambitious land reform program known as Decree 900. Under it, the uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers.

Some governments in Central America and the Caribbean were hostile to Árbenz and the Guatemalan Revolution. Anastasio Somoza García, Rafael Leonidas Trujillo and Marcos Pérez Jiménez, the US-backed right-wing dictators of Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, respectively, felt threatened by Arévalo&#x27;s reforms. Under Arévalo, Guatemala had become a haven for pro-democracy activists from those three countries. Somoza, Trujillo, and Jiménez had supported Guatemalan exiles working to undermine the Guatemalan government, in addition to suppressing democratic popular movements in their own countries.

The political climate of the Cold War led the US government to see the policies of Arévalo and Árbenz as communist. This conception had been strengthened by Arévalo&#x27;s support for the Caribbean Legion, and by the 1950s the US government was considering overthrowing Árbenz. The attitude of the United States was also influenced by the Monroe Doctrine, a philosophy of foreign policy articulated by James Monroe in 1823, which justified the maintenance of US hegemony in the region. The stated aim of the doctrine was to maintain order and stability and to make certain that access to resources and markets was not limited. Historian Mark Gilderhus opines that the doctrine also contained racially condescending language, which likened Latin American countries to fighting children. Before 1944, the US government had not needed to engage in military interventions in Guatemala to enforce this hegemony, given the presence of military rulers friendly to the US.

==Planning==

===Somoza&#x27;s visit===

In May 1952, Árbenz enacted Decree 900, the official title of the Guatemalan agrarian reform law. Approximately 500,000 people benefited from the decree. The United Fruit Company lost several hundred thousand acres of its uncultivated land to this law, and the compensation it received was based on the undervalued price it had presented to the Guatemalan government for tax purposes. The company therefore intensified its lobbying in Washington D.C. against the Guatemalan government. The law convinced the US government that the Guatemalan government was being influenced by communists.

The US government&#x27;s Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) started to explore the notion of lending support to detractors and opponents of Árbenz. Walter Bedell Smith, the Director of Central Intelligence, ordered J. C. King, the chief of the Western Hemisphere Division, to examine whether dissident Guatemalans could topple the Árbenz government if they had support from the dictatorships in Central America.

At this point the US government was approached by Nicaraguan leader Somoza, who had been in the United States on a private visit, during which he made public speeches praising the US, and was awarded a medal by New York City. During a meeting with Truman and his senior staff, Somoza said that if he were given the weapons, he would &quot;clean up Guatemala&quot;. Truman&#x27;s personal military advisor, Major General Harry H. Vaughan, persuaded Truman to explore the opportunity further, and Truman asked Smith to follow up.

===Carlos Castillo Armas===

Although the proposal was not taken seriously at the time, US Colonel Cornelius Mara flew back to Nicaragua with Somoza to further explore the idea. Somoza persuaded Mara that the plan was feasible, and Mara returned to the US and gave Truman a favorable report. Smith also sent a Spanish-speaking engineer under the codename &quot;Seekford&quot; to contact exiled Guatemalan Army officer Carlos Castillo Armas and his fellow dissidents, who were in Honduras and Guatemala.

Francisco Javier Arana had launched an ill-fated coup attempt against Arévalo in 1949. Castillo Armas had been a &quot;protégé&quot; of Arana, and had risen in the military to become the head of the military academy of Guatemala by 1949. Historians differ on what happened to Castillo Armas following the coup attempt. Piero Gleijeses writes that Castillo Armas was expelled from the country; Nick Cullather and Andrew Fraser, however, say Castillo Armas was arrested in August 1949, that Árbenz had him imprisoned under doubtful charges until December 1949, and that he was found in Honduras a month later.

In early 1950, a CIA officer found Castillo Armas attempting to get weapons from Somoza and Trujillo. He met with the CIA a few more times before November 1950, when he launched an attack against Matamoros, the largest fortress in the capital, and was jailed for it before bribing his way out of prison. Castillo Armas told the CIA he had the support of the &quot;Guardia Civil&quot; (Civil Guard), the garrison at Quetzaltenango, Guatemala&#x27;s second-largest city, and of the commander of Matamoros. The engineer dispatched by the CIA also told them Castillo Armas had the financial backing of Somoza and Trujillo.

Based on these reports, Truman authorized Operation PBFortune. According to Gleijeses, he did not inform the US State Department, or secretary of state Dean Acheson, of the plan. Based upon an examination of declassified documents, however, Cullather has said the CIA did, in fact, seek State Department approval before authorizing the plan, and that undersecretary of state David K. E. Bruce provided explicit approval for it. CIA Deputy Director Allen Dulles had previously contacted State Department official Thomas Mann and the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Edward G. Miller Jr. Both these individuals had said they wanted a new government in Guatemala even if it involved the use of force, but when asked, did not explicitly approve of action to topple Árbenz. Dulles assumed their vague responses implied support, but obtained explicit assent from Bruce before proceeding.

===The plot===

The details of the plot were finalized over the next few weeks by the CIA, the United Fruit Company, and Somoza. The coup&#x27;s plotters contacted Trujillo and Jiménez, who, along with Somoza and Juan Manuel Gálvez, the right-wing President of Honduras, had already been exchanging intelligence about the Árbenz government, and had considered the possibility of supporting an invasion by Guatemalan exiles. The two dictators were supportive of the plan, and agreed to contribute some funding.

Although PBFortune was officially approved on September 9, 1952, planning had begun earlier in the year. In January 1952, officers in the CIA&#x27;s Directorate of Plans compiled a list of &quot;top flight Communists whom the new government would desire to eliminate immediately in the event of a successful anti-Communist coup&quot;. The assassination plans represented the first time the US had considered assassination in Guatemala. The list of targets had been drawn up by the CIA even before the operation had been formally authorized. They were created using a list of communists that the Guatemalan Army had compiled in 1949, as well as its own intelligence. Nine months later the CIA also received through &quot;Seekford&quot; a list of 58 Guatemalans whom Castillo Armas wanted killed, in addition to 74 others he wanted arrested or exiled. &quot;Seekford&quot; also said Trujillo&#x27;s support was conditional on the assassination of four individuals from Santo Domingo who were at that point living in Guatemala. The plan was to be carried out by Castillo Armas, and involve no direct intervention from the US.

When contacted by the CIA agent dispatched by Smith, Castillo Armas had proposed a battle-plan to gain CIA support. This plan involved three forces invading Guatemala from Mexico, Honduras, and El Salvador. These invasions were supposed to be supported by internal rebellions. King formulated a plan to provide Castillo Armas with $225,000 as well as weaponry and transportation. His plan also suggested that Somoza and Gálvez be persuaded to provide air support, in addition to other help. The proposal went to Dulles. It emphasized the relatively small role the CIA was supposed to play, and stated that without the CIA&#x27;s support, the plot would probably go ahead, but would likely fail and lead to a crackdown on anti-Communist forces.

==Execution and termination==

The plan was put into motion in autumn 1952 by the CIA. King had obtained weapons from the stock of those that had been confiscated by port authorities in the city of New York. These included 250 rifles, 380 pistols, 64 machine guns, and 4,500 grenades. The United Fruit Company lent one of its freighters to the CIA. The freighter was specially refitted in New Orleans, and loaded with weapons under the guise of agricultural machinery. It was scheduled to sail to Nicaragua in early October 1952.

The CIA had encouraged Somoza and Gálvez to provide support to Castillo Armas&#x27; forces. Somoza, however, informed several government officials across Central America of the CIA&#x27;s role in the coup attempt. Somoza&#x27;s son Tacho, for instance, casually asked Miller whether &quot;the machinery&quot; was on its way at a meeting in Panama.

Accounts of the operation&#x27;s termination vary between historians. Gleijeses said that while the freighter was on its way to Nicaragua, a CIA employee went to Miller, and asked him to sign a document on behalf of the munitions department. Miller refused, and instead showed the document to his superiors, who in turn informed Acheson. Gleijeses writes that Acheson immediately spoke to Truman as a result of this document, and the operation was cut short. Nick Cullather writes that, due to Somoza spreading the word about the coup, the State Department decided the cover of the operation had been lost. Other diplomats began to learn of the operation, and on October 8, Acheson summoned Smith and called it off.

Acheson was particularly worried that allowing the details of the coup to go public would damage the image of the US. Under the Rio Pact of 1947, the Organization of American States (OAS) had obtained jurisdiction over regional disputes from the United Nations. To achieve this, the US had also committed to a policy of non-intervention in the internal affairs of other countries. If PBFortune had become public knowledge, the fact that the US was supporting an invasion of a fellow member of the OAS would have represented a huge setback to US policy, thus motivating the State Department to end the operation when they became aware its cover had been blown.

==Aftermath==

The termination of the operation caught the CIA by surprise, and King quickly attempted to salvage what he could. The freighter was redirected to Panama, where the arms were unloaded; King kept the weapons there in the hope that the project could be rejuvenated. Castillo Armas was paid a retainer of $3,000 a week, which allowed him to maintain a small force. The CIA remained in contact with him, and continued to provide support to the rebels. The CIA found it difficult to end the operation without drawing attention to it.

Peréz Jimenez opened a line of credit that would allow Castillo Armas to purchase airplanes, and Trujillo and Somoza continued to support the operation, although they acknowledged it would have to be postponed. The money paid to Castillo Armas has been described as a way of making sure he did not attempt any premature action. Even after the operation had been terminated, the CIA received reports from &quot;Seekford&quot; that the Guatemalan rebels were planning assassinations. Castillo Armas made plans to use groups of soldiers in civilian clothing from Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador to kill communist leaders in Guatemala. King continued to explore the CIA&#x27;s ability to move arms around Central America without the approval of the State Department.

In November 1952, Dwight Eisenhower was elected president of the US after a campaign promising a more hawkish stance against communism. Many senior figures in his cabinet, including John Foster Dulles and his brother Allen, had close connections to the United Fruit Company, which made Eisenhower more strongly predisposed than Truman to support Árbenz&#x27;s overthrow. In June 1954, the US trained and funded an invasion force led by Castillo Armas, backed by an intense campaign of psychological warfare by the CIA. Gálvez, Somoza, Jiménez, and Trujillo again offered the CIA their support in preparing for this operation. Árbenz resigned on June 27, 1954, ending the Guatemalan Revolution. Following his resignation, the CIA launched Operation PBHistory, an attempt to use documents from Árbenz&#x27;s government and elsewhere to justify the coup in response to the negative international reactions to it.

From 1954 onward Guatemala was ruled by a series of US-backed military dictators, leading to the Guatemalan Civil War which lasted until 1996. Approximately 200,000 civilians were killed in the war, and numerous human rights violations committed, including massacres of civilian populations, rape, aerial bombardment, and forced disappearances. Of these violations, 93 percent were committed by the United States-backed military, which included a genocidal scorched-earth campaign against the indigenous Maya population in the 1980s.

<text>Jack Harvey VC (24 August 1891 – 15 August 1940) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Harvey was a 27-year-old private in the 1/22nd (County of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (The Queen&#x27;s), British Army during the First World War. 

On 2 September 1918 north of Peronne, France, when the advance of his company was held up by machine gun fire, Private Harvey dashed forward a distance of 50 yards alone, through the English barrage and in the face of heavy enemy fire. He rushed a machine gun post, shooting two of the team and bayoneting another. He then destroyed the gun and continued his way along the enemy trench. He single-handedly rushed an enemy dugout which contained 37 Germans and compelled them to surrender. These acts of gallantry saved the company heavy casualties and materially assisted in the success of the operation. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for these actions.

Harvey later achieved the rank of sergeant.

==The Medal==
His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>Arthur Moore Lascelles VC MC (12 October 1880 – 7 November 1918) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was educated at Uppingham School and attended the University College of North Wales (now Bangor University) but abandoned his medical studies in 1902 and emigrated to South Africa.

==Details==
He was 37 years old, and an acting captain in the 3rd Battalion, The Durham Light Infantry, British Army, attached to 14th Battalion during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 3 December 1917 at Masnieres, France, during a very heavy bombardment Captain Lascelles, although wounded, continued to encourage his men and organize the defence until the attack was driven off. Shortly afterwards the enemy attacked again and captured the trench, taking several prisoners. Captain Lascelles at once jumped onto the parapet and followed by his 12 remaining men rushed across under very heavy machine-gun fire and drove over 60 of the enemy back. Later the enemy attacked again and captured the trench and Captain Lascelles, who later managed to escape in spite of having received two further wounds.

He was killed in action, Fontaine-au-Bois, France, on 7 November 1918.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross was displayed at the Durham Light Infantry Museum &amp; Durham Art Gallery, Durham, England.

<text>In optics, a diaphragm is a thin opaque structure with an opening (aperture) at its center. The role of the diaphragm is to &quot;stop&quot; the passage of light, except for the light passing through the &quot;aperture&quot;. Thus it is also called a stop (an aperture stop, if it limits the brightness of light reaching the focal plane, or a field stop or flare stop for other uses of diaphragms in lenses). The diaphragm is placed in the light path of a lens or objective, and the size of the aperture regulates the amount of light that passes through the lens. The centre of the diaphragm&#x27;s aperture coincides with the optical axis of the lens system. 

Most modern cameras use a type of adjustable diaphragm known as an iris diaphragm, and often referred to simply as an iris.

See the articles on aperture and f-number for the photographic effect and system of quantification of varying the opening in the diaphragm.

==Iris diaphragms versus other types==


A natural optical system that has a diaphragm and an aperture is the human eye. The iris is the diaphragm, the pupil is the aperture. In the human eye, the iris can both constrict and dilate, which varies the size of the pupil. Unsurprisingly, a photographic lens with the ability to continuously vary the size of its aperture (the hole in the middle of the annular structure) is known as an iris diaphragm.

An iris diaphragm can reduce the amount of light that hits a detector by decreasing the aperture, usually with &quot;leaves&quot; or &quot;blades&quot; that form a circle.

In the early years of photography, a lens could be fitted with one of a set of interchangeable diaphragms, often as brass strips known as Waterhouse stops or Waterhouse diaphragms. The iris diaphragm in most modern still and video cameras is adjusted by movable blades, simulating the iris of the eye. 

The diaphragm has two to twenty blades (with most lenses today featuring between five and ten blades), depending on price and quality of the device in which it is used. Straight blades result in polygon shape of the diaphragm opening, while curved blades improve the roundness of the iris opening. In a photograph, the number of blades that the iris diaphragm has can be guessed by counting the number of diffraction spikes converging from a light source or bright reflection. For an odd number of blades, there are twice as many spikes as there are blades. 

In case of an even number of blades, the two spikes per blade will overlap each other, so the number of spikes visible will be the number of blades in the diaphragm used. This is most apparent in pictures taken in the dark with small bright spots, for example night cityscapes. Some cameras, such as the Olympus XA or lenses such as the MC Zenitar-ME1, however, use a two-bladed diaphragm with right-angle blades creating a square aperture.

Similarly, out-of-focus points of light (circles of confusion) appear as polygons with the same number of sides as the aperture has blades. If the blurred light is circular, then it can be inferred that the aperture is either round or the image was shot &quot;wide-open&quot; (with the blades recessed into the sides of the lens, allowing the interior edge of the lens barrel to effectively become the iris).

The shape of the iris opening has a direct relation with the appearance of the blurred out-of-focus areas in an image called &quot;bokeh&quot;. A rounder opening produces softer and more natural out-of-focus areas.

Some lenses utilize specially shaped diaphragms in order to create certain effects. This includes the &quot;diffusion discs&quot; or &quot;sieve aperture&quot; of the Rodenstock Tiefenbildner-Imagon, Fuji and Sima soft focus lenses, the &quot;sector aperture&quot; of Seibold&#x27;s Dreamagon, or the circular apodization filter in the Minolta/Sony Smooth Trans Focus or Fujifilm APD lenses.

Some modern automatic point-and-shoot cameras do not have a diaphragm at all, and simulate aperture changes by using an automatic ND filter. Unlike a real diaphragm, this has no effect on depth of field. A real diaphragm when more-closed will cause the depth of field to &quot;increase&quot; (i.e., cause the background and the subject to both appear more in-focus at the same time) and if the diaphragm is opened up again the depth of field will &quot;decrease&quot; (i.e., the background and foreground will share less and less of the same focal plane).

==History==
In his 1567 work &quot;La Pratica della Perspettiva&quot; Venetian nobleman Daniele Barbaro (1514–1570) described using a camera obscura with a biconvex lens as a drawing aid and points out that the picture is more vivid if the lens is covered as much as to leave a circumference in the middle.

In 1762, Leonhard Euler says with respect to telescopes that, &quot;it is necessary likewise to furnish the inside of the tube with one or more diaphragms, perforated with a small circular aperture, the better to exclude all extraneous light.&quot;

In 1867, Désiré van Monckhoven, in one of the earliest books on photographic optics, draws a distinction betweens &quot;stops&quot; and &quot;diaphragms&quot; in photography, but not in optics, saying:

:&quot;Let us see what takes place when the stop is removed from the lens to a proper distance. In this case the stop becomes a diaphragm.
: * In optics, &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;diaphragm&quot; are synonyms. But in photographic optics they are only so by an unfortunate confusion of language. The stop reduces the lens to its central aperture; the diaphragm, on the contrary, allows all the segments of the lens to act, but only on the different radiating points placed symmetrically and concentrically in relation to the axis of the lens, or of the system of lenses (of which the axis is, besides, in every case common).&quot;

This distinction was maintained in Wall&#x27;s 1889 &quot;Dictionary of Photography&quot; (see figure), but disappeared after Ernst Abbe&#x27;s theory of stops unified these concepts.

According to Rudolf Kingslake, the inventor of the iris diaphragm is unknown. Others credit Joseph Nicéphore Niépce for this device, around 1820. J. H. Brown, a member of the Royal Microscopical Society, appears to have invented a popular improved iris diaphragm by 1867.

Kingslake has more definite histories for some other diaphragm types, such as M. Noton&#x27;s adjustable &quot;cat eye&quot; diaphragm of two sliding squares in 1856, and the Waterhouse stops of John Waterhouse in 1858.

The Hamburg Observatory-Bergedorf location had a 60 cm (~23.6 inch) aperture Great Refractor by Reposold and Steinheil (Lenses). One unique feature of the Hamburg Great Refractor is an iris diaphragm that allows the aperture to be adjusted from 5 to 60 cm. This telescope was activated in the early 1910s.

<text>John Alexander French, VC (15 July 1914 – 4 September 1942) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. French was one of 20 Australians to receive the award for their actions during the Second World War. He was killed in action fighting against the Japanese during the Battle of Milne Bay in September 1942 while serving with the 2/9th Battalion.

==Early life==
French was born on 15 July 1914 in Crows Nest, north of Toowoomba in Queensland. His parents were Lucy (née Donaldson) and Albert French. His father was a hairdresser who had moved to the Crows Nest area from Tenterfield, New South Wales, while his mother had originally come from Charleville, Queensland.

In his formative years, French had a reputation as a good sportsman, excelling particularly at rugby league. He was also known for his sense of fair play, with one of his childhood friends, Alf Blinco, recounting the story of how French had exonerated him when he had been falsely accused of stealing by finding the real perpetrators. At age six, French attended the Crows Nest State Primary School, continuing his schooling there until 1928 when he gained a scholarship to further his education by successfully passing a scholarship examination. After this, French attended the Toowoomba State High School and Toowoomba Technical College. In 1929, after completing his schooling, he joined his father&#x27;s business, commencing an apprenticeship.

==Second World War==
After the outbreak of the Second World War, French enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force on 22 October 1939, the first in Crow&#x27;s Nest to do so. As a Queenslander, French was posted to the 2/9th Battalion, the first infantry battalion raised in Queensland during the war. In early May 1940, after completing training at Redbank, Queensland, the 2/9th Battalion received orders to deploy overseas. Embarking upon the &quot;Mauritania&quot;, they sailed to the United Kingdom where the battalion formed part of an Australian contingent – part of the 6th Division – that were to help defend against a possible invasion following the fall of France. The invasion did not eventuate and in late 1940, the battalion – along with the rest of the 18th Brigade – were transferred to the Middle East. They reached Alexandria in late December and shortly after arrival, the battalion became part of the 7th Division.

In March 1941, the 2/9th took part in their first combat action, successfully capturing the Italian fort of Giarabub. The battalion then joined the garrison at Tobruk as it was surrounded by German forces, taking part in several actions before being withdrawn in August. They briefly trained in Palestine before being sent to Syria, where they undertook garrison duties following the capitulation of Vichy French forces. French was promoted to corporal in December.

In early 1942, in response to the growing threat posed by Japan&#x27;s entry into the war following the attacks on Pearl Harbor and Malaya, the 2/9th Battalion, along with the rest of the 7th Division, was brought back to Australia. At this time they were eventually granted seven days&#x27; leave, and French returned to Australia and Crow&#x27;s Nest. This leave was the final time his family saw him alive. This was followed by further training as the Australian Army reorganised for jungle warfare, before the 2/9th were committed to the fighting against the Japanese in New Guinea.

===Victoria Cross===

In late August 1942, the 2/9th Battalion was deployed to the Milne Bay area of New Guinea. The Japanese were advancing south along the Kokoda Track and Allied intelligence had predicted an attack around Milne Bay. In early September, the battalion took part in heavy fighting after the Japanese landed a force to capture the Allied airfields situated there. It was during this fighting that French performed the deeds that led to him being awarded the Victoria Cross. The citation for French&#x27;s VC award reads as follows:

Jack was found, although mortally wounded, alive and coherent in front of the third gun pit when his section had advanced. He knew what he had done to save his mates. The fighting around Milne Bay eventually resulted in Japanese withdrawal, and represented the first full-scale defeat of the Japanese on land during the war. Although French&#x27;s Victoria Cross was gazetted first, his award was actually the second for actions on Australian territory (due to Papua New Guinea being under Australian Government jurisdiction), as Bruce Kingsbury received his VC for actions near Isurava on the Kokoda Track on 29 August 1942. French is buried at the Bomana War Cemetery at Port Moresby. He was survived by his fiancée Dulcie McCahon. Two of his brothers also served during the war: Eric in the Army, and Gordon, who was killed in action in August 1943 in Europe, in the Royal Australian Air Force.

==Legacy==
The library at Crows Nest is called the John French V.C. Memorial Library.

The Corporal John Alexander &#x27;Jack&#x27; French VC Estate in Gaythorne, Brisbane is named in his honour.

The John French VC Bridge on the Toowoomba Range crossing was unveiled in September 2019.

== Personal life ==

French was a cousin (first cousin, once removed) of George Cross recipient Eric George Bailey.

<text>Major James Palmer Huffam VC (31 March 1897 – 16 February 1968) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early years==
He was born in Dunblane on 31 March 1897. He was the fourth son of Edward Valentine Huffam, an Army Pensioner (Royal Highlanders) and High Bailiff, and Dorothy Roughead Huffam, of 2 West Street, Spittal, Berwick-on-Tweed. His siblings were Alfred Meek, John Henry, Elizabeth Clara Margery, Dorothy Francis, Henry Harold and Dorothy Gertrude Beatrice. Huffam was educated at Spittal Council School.

==First World War==
He was 21 years old, and a second lieutenant in the 5th Battalion, The Duke of Wellington&#x27;s (West Riding) Regiment, British Army, attd, 2nd Battalion during the First World War. On 31 August 1918 at St. Servin&#x27;s Farm, France, Huffam with three men rushed an enemy machine-gun post and put it out of action. His position was then heavily attacked and he withdrew, carrying back a wounded comrade. Again in the night, accompanied by two men only, he rushed an enemy machine-gun, capturing eight prisoners and enabling the advance to continue. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions;
his medal is privately owned and not on display.

==Post-war and Second World War==
After the war, James Palmer Huffam remained in the army. He was initiated as a Freemason at St David&#x27;s Lodge No 393 Berwick on Tweed on 17 Feb 1920, age 22.

<text>Karanbahadur Rana Magar VC (21 December 1898 – 25 July 1973) was a Nepalese Gurkha recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to members of British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Karanbahadur Rana was born at Mangalthan Gulmi, Litung, in the Baglung district of Nepal, and was a member of the Magar people. During the First World War he joined the 3rd Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles of the British Indian Army, and was posted to the regiment&#x27;s 2nd battalion, then serving with the 75th Division in Palestine.

On 9 April 1917, the British XXI Corps was on the coastal sector of Palestine just north of Jaffa with the 75th Division on the right of the corps. The British planned an operation which in several stages would capture Tulkarm. The 75th Division launched a preliminary attack at 05:10 hours on 9 April and met fierce resistance. On 10 April, in the fighting at El Kefr, Palestine, Rifleman Karanbahadur Rana, 2nd Battalion, 3rd Queen Alexandra&#x27;s Own Gurkha Rifles, 75th Division, was awarded the Victoria Cross for most conspicuous bravery. The citation published on 21 June 1918 stated:

:For most conspicuous bravery, resource in action under adverse conditions, and utter contempt for danger.

:During an attack, he, with a few other men, succeeded under intense fire, in creeping forward with a Lewis gun in order to engage an enemy machine gun which had caused severe casualties to officers and other ranks who had attempted to put it out of action. No. 1 of the Lewis gun opened fire, and was shot immediately. Without a moment&#x27;s hesitation Rifleman Karanbahadur pushed the dead man off the gun, and in spite of bombs thrown at him and heavy fire from both flanks, he opened fire and knocked out the enemy machine-gun crew; then, switching his fire on to the enemy bombers and riflemen in front of him, he silenced their fire. He kept his gun in action and showed the greatest coolness in removing defects which on two occasions prevented the gun from firing. During the remainder of the day he did magnificent work, and when a withdrawal was ordered he assisted with covering fire until the enemy were close on him. He displayed throughout a very high standard of valour and devotion to duty.:

The unit, date and place of VC actions were not gazetted from 1916 until 11 November 1918. These details were gazetted on 31 March 1919 when Karanbahadur Rana was listed with the &#x27;2/3rd Q.A.O. Gurkha Rif.&#x27;, the date &#x27;10.4.18&#x27; and place &#x27;El Kefr&#x27;. The gazette incorrectly stated El Kefr was in Egypt; it is in Palestine. In silencing the enemy machine-gun, Karanbahadur Rana, enabled his company commander, Lieutenant Frederick Barter, who had been lying within 30 yards of the machine gun for five and a half hours to withdraw. As a company sergeant-major with The Royal Welch Fusiliers, Lieutenant Barter had been awarded the Victoria Cross for conspicuous bravery at Festubert, France, on 16 May 1915.

At the end of two days of attacks, the offensive was called off.

Rana continued his military service after the war, serving in the 1919–1921 Waziristan campaign. He later returned to Nepal and died at Litung, Bharse Gulmi in Nepal on 25 July 1973, aged seventy-four.

==The medal==
After his death, Rana&#x27;s VC and other medals were obtained from one of his sons by the Gurkha Museum in Winchester, Hampshire, England, where they have been displayed since November 1974.

==Military career==
Gurney was 33 years old, and a private in the 2/48th Battalion (South Australia), Second Australian Imperial Force during the Second World War when he was awarded the VC (posthumously) for the following deed.

On 22 July 1942 at Tel-el-Eisa, Egypt, during the First Battle of El Alamein, intense machine-gun fire held up the company to which Private Gurney belonged and inflicted heavy casualties on it, including killing or wounding all the officers. Private Gurney, realizing the seriousness of the situation, charged the nearest machine-gun post, silencing the guns and bayoneting three of the crew. He bayoneted two more at a second post before a grenade knocked him down. Picking himself up, he charged a third post and disappeared from view.

<text>Brigadier Manley Angell James, (12 July 1896 – 23 September 1975) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early years==
Manley Angell James was born in Odiham, Hampshire, on 12 July 1896, the son of Dr. John Angell James and Emily Cormel James, and the second of four children. The family later moved to Bristol, where Manley was educated at Bristol Grammar School in 1906 and joined the Officers&#x27; Training Corps (OTC), where he rose to the rank of sergeant.

==First World War==
Although intending to follow his father into the medical profession, having already entered a medical course at Bristol University in the autumn, the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, shortly after his eighteenth birthday, saw James, along with many others of his generation, volunteer for service with the British Army instead. As a result, on 1 December 1914, James was gazetted as an officer, with the rank of temporary second lieutenant (see temporary gentlemen), into the 8th (Service) Battalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment, a line infantry regiment of the British Army with a distinguished history.

The battalion, a Kitchener&#x27;s Army unit raised from civilian volunteers in September, formed part of the 57th Brigade of the 19th (Western) Division (nicknamed &quot;The Butterfly Division&quot; due to its divisional insignia) and, after many months of training, departed for service on the Western Front in July 1915, arriving in France on 18 July as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The battalion was to remain on the Western Front for the rest of the war. By this time James, promoted to temporary lieutenant on 28 June 1915, was in command of the battalion&#x27;s lewis gun detachment.

With most of the rest of 1915 spent learning about the basics of trench warfare, July 1916 saw the battalion – then commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Adrian Carton de Wiart – engaged in the Battle of the Somme, specifically in the capture of La Boisselle. James was &quot;severely injured in the thigh&quot; in this action and evacuated to England for treatment. He was mentioned in despatches for his handling of the battalion&#x27;s Lewis guns, and returned to France in December as a member of the 57th Brigade HQ staff, which was not to his liking. He rejoined his battalion soon afterwards and was promoted to the temporary rank of captain on 22 February 1917, he was given command of &#x27;A&#x27; Company and was again wounded, this time by shrapnel, and in April he was again mentioned in despatches. Returning again to the front, he fought in the Battle of Messines in June 1917, where he was slightly wounded and awarded the Military Cross (MC) for his part in capturing a position called Druid&#x27;s Farm. James&#x27;s company was singled out for praise by the 19th Division&#x27;s General Officer Commanding (GOC), Major General Tom Bridges, who issued a special order, awarding a badge of Honour to &#x27;A&#x27; Company, enabling the badge to be worn on the right sleeve of every member of James&#x27;s company. The citation for his MC reads:

The German Army launched its Spring Offensive in March 1918 with the aim of cutting off the BEF, deployed mainly in northern Belgium, from the French Army in the south. The German intention was to force a victory on the Western Front before the United States (which had entered the war in April 1917) were able to deploy significant numbers of troops on the Western Front, thereby making victory for Germany all but impossible against the overwhelming resources of the United States.

===Victoria Cross action===
On 21 March 1918, near Velu Wood, France, James led his company forward, capturing 27 prisoners and two machine-guns. Although wounded, he refused to leave his company and repulsed three enemy assaults over the next day. Two days later, the enemy having broken through, he made a determined stand. His company inflicted heavy losses and gained valuable time for the withdrawal of the guns. After holding out to the last to enable the brigade to be extricated, he led his company forward in a local counter-attack, being again wounded in the process. He was last seen working a machine-gun single-handed, was wounded a third time and eventually taken prisoner.

James&#x27;s company sustained seventy-five percent casualties in the offensive and many believed James himself to have been killed in action. In May, from a prisoner of war camp, he managed to send a postcard to his father, &quot;informing him that he had been wounded in the neck, shoulder, jaw and stomach&quot;. He was released soon after the Armistice with Germany in November and arrived in England on 25 December 1918.

==Between the wars==
James was invested with his VC by King George V at Buckingham Palace on 22 February 1919. He was later discharged from the army, and played for Clifton Rugby Football Club for a few years before receiving a permanent Regular Army commission as a lieutenant in the Gloucestershire Regiment on 10 December 1920 (with seniority backdated to 1 July 1917). James was one of only two Glosters&#x27; officers who had received a wartime commission to be granted a commission in the Regular Army.

On 27 May 1925 James was promoted to captain and later served as adjutant of the 1st Battalion, Glosters from 12 December 1925 until 14 December 1928. In 1926 he became engaged to Miss Noreen Cooper, marrying her two years later, and had their only child, a son, Peter, born in December 1930. James served with the battalion in Egypt between 1928 and 1930 before returning to the regimental depot in Bristol and, from 1930 to 1931, he attended the Staff College, Camberley, where his many fellow students included Miles Dempsey, James Steele, George Symes, George Hopkinson, William Gott, John Nichols and Maurice Chilton, all of whom were to achieve general officer rank in the next war.

James returned to the 1st Battalion, Glosters as a company commander in 1933 and from November 1934 to December 1936 he was a General Staff Officer (GSO) with Western Command. Promoted to major on 25 December 1936, he succeeded John Nichols, his fellow student at Camberley, as a brigade major with the 13th Infantry Brigade, The brigade was then commanded by Brigadier John Priestman until succeeded in September 1938 by Brigadier Reade Godwin-Austen. The brigade was serving in Palestine during the Arab revolt, before returning to England where it became part of the 5th Infantry Division, then serving under Northern Command. James held this post until January 1939. Promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1938, on 10 January 1939 he transferred from the Gloucestershire Regiment to the Royal Sussex Regiment and receiving promotion in that regiment to lieutenant colonel, and, on the same date, became Commanding Officer (CO) of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Sussex. The battalion was then serving in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on internal security duties.

==Second World War==
At the start of the Second World War in September 1939 his battalion was sent to England where it became part of the 133rd Infantry Brigade of the 44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division, a Territorial Army (TA) formation, then preparing for overseas service in France.

On 21 March 1940 he relinquished command of the battalion and, promoted to acting colonel the following day, became a GSO1 of the 54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division, another TA formation, then commanded by Major General John Priestman, who had commanded the 13th Brigade years before when James had been brigade major. On 19 July 1940, shortly after the Dunkirk evacuation, James was promoted to the acting rank of brigadier, and served on the staff of the newly created VIII Corps. The corps was commanded by Lieutenant General Harold Franklyn, who James knew as the commander of the 5th Division in the late 1930s. He was not there long, however, as in February 1941 he succeeded Brigadier Frederick Browning as CO of the 128th Infantry Brigade, then serving in Kent as part of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division, then commanded by Major General Charles Allfrey, and comprising three TA battalions of the Hampshire Regiment (later the Royal Hampshire Regiment). On 12 December 1941 James&#x27;s rank of colonel was made permanent (with seniority backdated to 1 July 1941). In August 1942 the 43rd Division, now commanded by Major General Ivor Thomas, was reorganised as a &#x27;mixed&#x27; division and the 128th Brigade transferred to Major General Harold Freeman-Attwood&#x27;s 46th Infantry Division.

After months spent training in desert warfare, James led the brigade overseas to North Africa in mid-January 1943, where it fought throughout the Tunisian campaign until its end in mid-May with distinction, earning James a Distinguished Service Order (DSO). The campaign came to an end in mid-May 1943, with the surrender of thousands of Axis soldiers. James was described as, &quot;Personally as brave as a lion, he was at the same time careful and solicitous about how he committed his troops.&quot; After initially being held in reserve for the Allied invasion of Sicily, the brigade then settled down for training before taking part in the Allied invasion of Italy in September where his brigade, along with the rest of the division, now commanded by Major-General John Hawkesworth, sustained very heavy casualties, including James himself, being badly wounded in the leg on 20 September and reluctantly allowed himself to be evacuated via hospital ship to Egypt.

In 1944, after recovering from his injuries, he was assigned to the General Staff of Middle East Command, and was transferred to the General Staff for Training Home Forces. Finally, in 1945, he became the CO for the 140th Infantry Brigade, a training formation.

==Post-war==
Between 1948 and 1951 he was the Director of Ground Defence for the Air Ministry. He was promoted to the permanent rank of brigadier on 1 July 1948 and on 1 March 1951 he retired from the military. He died in Westbury-on-Trym at the age of 79 on 23 September 1975, and was cremated at Canford Cemetery.

His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>Eden Theological Seminary is a Christian seminary based in Webster Groves, Missouri. It is one of the six official seminaries of the United Church of Christ (UCC).

== History ==
The seminary was established in 1850 by German pastors in Marthasville, Missouri as Das Deutsche Evangelische Predigerseminar or, more locally, as the German Evangelical Seminary. At the time, the goal was to equip pastors to lead and minister to frontier churches. The pastors soon formed the German Evangelical Synod of North America which, after subsequent mergers, became a part of the UCC. 

In 1883, the seminary moved to what would become Wellston, Missouri and built a campus there. The campus was only a mile away from the Eden Station of the Wabash, St. Louis, and Pacific Railroad. Ministerial candidates, usually from Elmhurst College, an Evangelical Synod of North America college near Chicago, would arrive at the Seminary by getting off at the Eden Station and, eventually, the Seminary would be colloquially referred to as the &quot;Eden Seminary.&quot; The campus was purchased by Normandy High School in 1923.

In 1924, the seminary moved to its current campus in Webster Groves. The school was augmented in 1934 by a merger with the Central Theological Seminary, an institution of the Reformed Church in the United States in Dayton, Ohio, and the Oakwood Institute of Cincinnati, Ohio. This coincided with the merger of the two denominations into the Evangelical and Reformed Church. Conversations at Eden Theological Seminary, beginning in 1937, led to the 1957 merger of the Evangelical and Reformed Church and the Congregational Christian Churches to form the United Church of Christ.

=== Presidents ===

== Academics ==
Eden Theological Seminary offers five degree programs:

* Master of Divinity (M.Div.)
* Master of Community Leadership (M.C.L.)
* Master of Arts in Professional Studies (M.A.P.S.)
* Master of Theological Studies (M.T.S.)
* Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.)

All classes and programming are offered in blended format with students participating fully on campus and online.

=== Campus ===
The Samuel D. Press Education Center is the heart of the Eden Seminary campus. The tower was inspired by Oxford&#x27;s Magdalen Tower. The Center contains faculty and staff offices, classrooms, institutional archives, the Luhr Reading Room, and the Wehrli Chapel.

Duhan and Schultz Halls were among the original buildings of the campus and, with the Press Center and Luhr Building, surround the Wiese Quadrangle. Duhan Hall provides on-campus housing for students and visiting faculty. Schultz Hall houses the offices of Peace United Church of Christ and the Missouri Mid-South Conference of the UCC.

Schroer Commons was the Seminary&#x27;s refectory but continues to host events and dinners. The building was named after Rev. Dr. Hale Schroer was professor of preaching and worship, and Dean of Students and Dean of the Chapel at Eden Seminary.

A group of apartment buildings - Goetsch Hall, North Hall, and South Hall - provide on-campus housing for students. The Seminary also provides housing for faculty members, including the seminary&#x27;s president, near the campus.

=== The Webster-Eden library system ===
In 1968, Eden Theological Seminary built the Luhr Library to house its collections. The next year, it was approached by Webster University. The two schools agreed to put their collections together, and the Luhr building became the library building for both the seminary and Webster University.

In 2003, the book collections outgrew the capacities of the Luhr building and the books were moved to the newly constructed Emerson Library at Webster University, where the library remains to this day. The Emerson Library is open to both Eden Seminary and Webster University students, and is a member of the MOBIUS library consortium. Eden Seminary maintains its historically significant books and religious/theology reference collections in the Luhr Reading Room in the Samuel Press Hall. In 2010, the Luhr building was sold to Webster University, which uses it for its institutional technology department and the chess team.

<doc id="1218249" wikidata="Q5131429" url="?curid=1218249" title="Clement Heneage">
<text>Clement Walker Heneage, VC (6 March 1831 – 9 December 1901) was a British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. In later life he was a justice of the peace and High Sheriff of Wiltshire. 

==Early life==
Heneage was born in 1831, the eldest son of George Heneage Walker Heneage, the Member of Parliament for Devizes from 1838 to 1857.

==Army career==

In August 1851, by purchase, Heneage was commissioned as a Cornet into the 8th Light Dragoons and on 3 September 1854 was promoted to Lieutenant. He was soon serving in the Crimean War and was present at many engagements of that campaign, including the battles of Alma, Balaclava, Inkerman, Tchernaïa, and the Siege of Sevastopol. He rode in the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava. In May 1857, he was promoted to Captain. 

At the end of the Crimean War, Heneage proceeded to India with his regiment, which took part in suppressing the Indian Mutiny (1857–1858) in Rajputana and Central India. He was present at the capture of Kotah, the reoccupation of Chundaree, the battle of Kotah ke Serai, the capture of Gwalior and of Powree, the battle of Sindwaho, and the action of Koorwye and Naharghur

===Victoria Cross===
Heneage was 27 years old, and a captain in the 8th Hussars, during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 17 June 1858 at Gwalior, British India, Captain Heneage took part in a charge by a squadron of the 8th Hussars. Four men in this action, Heneage, Joseph Ward, George Hollis and John Pearson were awarded the Victoria Cross, the joint citation reading as follows:
==Later life==
Heneage retired from the army in 1868. He succeeded to the family estates on his father&#x27;s death in 1875, and &quot;devoted himself to the life and duties of a country gentleman&quot; in Wiltshire. 

He was appointed High Sheriff of Wiltshire for 1887. He lived at Compton House, Compton Bassett, Wiltshire, and in the 1901 United Kingdom census his occupation was stated as justice of the peace. At that time he had thirteen servants, including a butler, a cook, a coachman, a groom, and two footmen. 

Clement Walker Heneage died suddenly at Compton House on 9 December 1901.

==Family==
In 1865, Heneage married Henrietta Vivian, daughter of John Henry Vivian, of Singleton, Glamorgan, with whom he had one daughter and four sons. Their son Algernon became a Royal Navy admiral.

<text>Darwan Singh Negi VC (4 March 188324 June 1950) was one of the first Indian soldiers to be awarded the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Negi was born to a farming family in Kafarteer village in the Garhwal District of the North-Western Provinces in India. In 1902, at the age of 19, he joined the 39th Garhwal Rifles, Indian Army.

When the First World War broke out in 1914, the regiment travelled to France as part of the 7th (Meerut) Division of the Indian Corps.

==Victoria Cross==
The citation of the VC reads:
He was awarded the medal on the same day as Khudadad Khan VC; but Khan&#x27;s VC action was of earlier date, so that he is regarded as the first Indian recipient.

Negi returned to India in January 1915 and undertook recruiting duty. After the First World War he served in Iraq, He retired in May 1926 with the rank of subedar, equivalent to a British captain. In the Second World War he again acted as a recruiting officer within India. He died on 24 June 1950 and was cremated in his home village of Kafarteer in the Garhwal division, India.

Negi&#x27;s son Balbir served in the Garhwal Rifles of the Indian Army; and achieved the rank of colonel and Balbir&#x27;s son is still serving as a Brigadier in the Indian Army. The Victoria Cross is held by the family. The regimental museum of the Garhwal Rifles in Lansdowne, Uttarakhand is named the Darwan Singh Museum in his honour.

<text>James Hannah Gordon, VC (7 March 1909 – 24 July 1986) was an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Gordon was one of 20 Australians to receive the award for their actions during the Second World War, receiving it for deeds he performed while fighting against the Vichy France during the Syria-Lebanon campaign, in which he personally bayonetted five Vichy French machine-gunners in the Battle of Jezzine.

Gordon later served against the Japanese in the New Guinea campaign and after the war became a soldier in the Australian Regular Army, serving until 1968. He died in 1986, at the age of 77.

==Early life==
Gordon was born in Rockingham, Western Australia, one of eight children born to William Beattie Gordon, a farmer who served as a state parliamentarian between 1901 and 1911, and his wife Harriet Ann Scott. Growing up on farming properties near Moora and in Gingin, Western Australia, after completing his schooling, Gordon undertook various laboring jobs including droving, farming and working on the goldfields.

==Military career==
On 26 April 1940, during the early stages of the Second World War, Gordon volunteered for overseas service, lying about his age to join the Australian Imperial Force; falsely giving his middle name as Heather. Shortly afterwards, he married Myrtle Troy at St Edmund&#x27;s Church of England, Wembley Park, Perth, on 14 June 1940.

After a period of training, Gordon was sent to the Middle East in September 1940. He was later assigned to the 2/31st Battalion, an infantry unit formed in Queensland and Victoria, which was part of the 7th Australian Division, in February 1941. In June–July 1941, the unit was engaged in the Syria-Lebanon campaign against the Vichy French. During the Battle of Jezzine, on 10 July 1941, Gordon&#x27;s company was &quot;...held up by intense machine-gun and grenade fire from Vichy French forces, but on his own initiative, he crept forward alone and succeeded in getting close to the machine-gun post. He then charged it and killed the four machine-gunners with his bayonet. His action demoralised the enemy in this sector and the company advanced and took the position.&quot; Gordon was subsequently awarded the Victoria Cross for this action.

On 12 July 1942, a plaque in his honour was unveiled in front of the Gingin Post Office; it was later moved to the town&#x27;s war memorial. Later that year a portrait of Jim Gordon painted in 1941 by artist William Dargie won the 1942 Archibald Prize, Australia&#x27;s most famous portrait prize.

Gordon returned to Australia in March 1942, now holding the rank of corporal. While the 2/31st Battalion was soon deployed to Papua, a bout of malaria prevented Gordon from joining it until November 1942. He was promoted to sergeant in July 1943. After seeing further action during the capture of Lae and the subsequent advance through the Markham and Ramu Valleys in New Guinea, he returned to Australia in January 1944. He was hospitalised due to malaria again, and was later reassigned to administrative duties. He remained in the Army until 17 February 1947.

After discharge, Gordon briefly worked for the State Electricity Commission, before rejoining the army as a regular soldier on 2 December 1947, achieving the rank of Warrant Officer Class II in 1950. He continued service until 1 August 1968 when he retired; after this, he was employed at Campbell Barracks (Western Australia), Swanbourne, as a groundsman until 1975.

==Later life==
Gordon died on 19 July 1986 at the Repatriation General Hospital, Hollywood. After being cremated, he received full military honours. The Jim Gordon Ward at the former Repatriation General Hospital has been named in his honour. His wife, Myrtle, and one son survived him.

<text>William Henry Kibby, (15 April 1903 – 31 October 1942) was a British-born Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces at the time. Kibby emigrated to South Australia with his parents in early 1914 and worked as an interior decorator and served in the part-time Militia prior to World WarII. In 1940, he enlisted in the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force and joined the 2/48th Infantry Battalion. His unit was sent to the Middle East, but soon after arriving, Kibby broke his leg and spent the next year recovering and undergoing further training while his battalion took part in the North African campaign. He rejoined his unit when it was serving on garrison duties in northern Syria after its involvement in the siege of Tobruk, but in June 1942 it was sent to Egypt and recommitted to the North Africa campaign. Kibby was with the battalion during the First Battle of El Alamein in July.

In October, the 2/48th Battalion was committed to the Second Battle of El Alamein, during which Kibby undertook a series of courageous actions across the period from 23 to 31 October. In the first episode, he went forward alone and silenced an enemy machine-gun post. In the second, he provided inspirational leadership to his platoon and mended its telephone line under heavy fire. On the final occasion, he pressed forward under withering fire and helped his company capture its objective. This final action ultimately cost him his life. He was then posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. A memorial trust used donated money to purchase a house for his widow and two daughters. His medal set is displayed at the Australian War Memorial in the Hall of Valour.

==Early life==
William Henry Kibby was born at Winlaton, County Durham, United Kingdom, on 15 April 1903. The second of three children, Kibby was born to John Robert Kibby, a draper&#x27;s assistant, and Mary Isabella Kibby Birnie. He had two sisters. In early 1914, the Kibby family emigrated to Adelaide, South Australia. Bill attended Mitcham Public School and then held various jobs before securing a position at the Perfection Fibrous Plaster Works in Edwardstown. There, he worked as an interior decorator, designing and fixing plaster decorations. He married Mabel Sarah Bidmead Morgan in 1926; they lived at Helmsdale (now Glenelg East) and had two daughters, Clariss and Jacqueline.

Kibby stood only tall, but was a strong man and enjoyed outdoor activities. He joined the scouting movement, as an assistant scoutmaster of the 2nd Glenelg Sea Scouts where he crewed their lifeboat. He enjoyed family walks and picnics and was a keen golfer, playing on various public courses. He was also a talented artist, painting and drawing in addition to his plaster design work, and even briefly attended art classes at the School of Mines and Industries. He was described as a quiet and sincere man who loved gardening. In 1936, he joined the part-time Militia and was posted to the 48th Field Battery, Royal Australian Artillery. Along with his Militia service, he enjoyed participating in military tattoos.

==World War II==
On 29 June 1940, Kibby enlisted in the all-volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force, which had been raised for overseas service in World WarII. He was posted to the 2/48th Infantry Battalion, part of the 26th Brigade. This brigade was initially assigned to the 7th Division. On 14 September, when the battalion was training in South Australia, Kibby was promoted to acting corporal, and this was followed by promotion to acting sergeant a month later. The 2/48th embarked on the troopship HMT &quot;Stratheden&quot; on 17 November and sailed for the Middle East, where it disembarked in Palestine on 17 December. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, Kibby fell into a slit trench and broke his leg. He then spent months convalescing. During his recovery, he produced at least forty watercolours and pencil drawings, which, according to his biographer, Bill Gammage, displayed &quot;a fondness for Palestine&#x27;s countryside and a feeling for its people&quot;. While in Palestine, Kibby struck up a friendship with the painter Esmond George, and occasionally accompanied him on sketching trips. After recovering, Kibby joined the brigade training battalion in August 1941 and also attended the infantry school to complete a weapons course. He rejoined the 2/48th in February 1942, the 26th Brigade having been transferred to the 9th Division a year earlier. At the time, the battalion was undertaking garrison duties in northern Syria, after participating in the siege of Tobruk.

During early 1942, the Axis forces had advanced steadily through northwest Egypt. It was decided that the British Eighth Army should make a stand just over west of Alexandria, at the railway siding of El Alamein, where the coastal plain narrowed between the Mediterranean Sea and the inhospitable Qattara Depression. On 26 June 1942, the 9th Division was ordered to begin moving from northern Syria to El Alamein. On 1July, &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erwin Rommel&#x27;s forces made a major attack, hoping to dislodge the Allies from the area, take Alexandria, and open the way to Cairo and the Suez Canal. This attack resulted in the First Battle of El Alamein. The Eighth Army had regrouped sufficiently to repel the Axis forces and launch counter-attacks. On 6July, the lead elements of the 9th Division arrived at Tel el Shammama from the front, from where they would be committed to the fighting in the northern sector.

Before dawn on 10 July, as Rommel focused his efforts on the southern flank of the battlefield, the 9th Division attacked the north flank of the enemy positions and captured the strategic high ground around Tel el Eisa. In the days following, Rommel redirected his forces against them, in a series of intense counter-attacks, but was unable to dislodge the Australians. On 22 July, the 24th and 26th Brigades attacked German positions on the ridges south of Tel el Eisa, suffering heavy casualties but taking positions on Makh Khad Ridge and Tel el Eisa itself.

At the Second Battle of El Alamein, from 23 to 31 October 1942, Kibby distinguished himself through his skill in leading his platoon, after its commander had been killed, during the first attack at Miteiriya Ridge. On 23 October, he charged a machinegun position, firing at it with his Thompson submachine gun; Kibby killed three enemy soldiers, captured twelve others and took the position. His company commander intended to recommend him for the Distinguished Conduct Medal after this action, but was killed. During the following days, Kibby moved among his men directing fire and cheering them on. He mended his platoon&#x27;s telephone line several times under intense fire, restoring communications with the battalion mortars and enabling them to bring down fire on the attacking enemy. During 30–31 October, the platoon came under heavy machinegun and mortar fire. Most of the members of the platoon were killed or wounded, and by the time the battle was over the total fighting strength of the battalion was down to 213 men from an establishment strength of 910. At one point before midnight on 31 October, in order to achieve his company&#x27;s objective, Kibby moved forward alone, to within a few metres of the enemy, throwing grenades. Just as his success in this endeavour appeared decisive, he was killed. By the morning, the 2/48th consisted of fewer than 50 unwounded men. The posts captured by the 2/48th that night were lost to the enemy, who buried Kibby with other dead in a common grave. Later, when the area was retaken by Australian troops, the men of his unit searched for ten days, found the grave and reburied the men individually.

Kibby was subsequently recommended for the posthumous award of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that could be awarded to an Australian armed forces member at the time. The citation was partly based on a note found in the pocket of his dead company commander. The award was listed in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 28 January 1943, and the citation read:

George was invalided back to Adelaide early in 1943 and was able to pass on to Mabel Kibby some of her husband&#x27;s works. The Governor-General of Australia, Baron Gowrie, himself a recipient of the VC, presented Kibby&#x27;s award to Mabel Kibby on 27 November 1943. 
==Postscript==
In January 1944, Kibby&#x27;s remains were re-interred in the El Alamein War Cemetery maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. In the same year, a memorial trust was established and raised A£1,001, which was used to purchase a house on Third Avenue, Helmsdale, for Mabel and their daughters. Along with the Victoria Cross, Kibby was also entitled to the 1939–1945 Star, Africa Star with 8th Army clasp, Defence Medal, War Medal 1939–1945 and Australia Service Medal 1939–1945. Later, Mabel donated his medal set to the Australian War Memorial; it is on display in the Hall of Valour. In 1947, Kibby&#x27;s father John met Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, who had commanded the Allied forces during the Second Battle of El Alamein, when he visited Adelaide. In 1956, the soldiers&#x27; mess at Woodside Barracks in the Adelaide Hills was named for Kibby. In 1996, a rest area on the Federal Highway near Yarra, New South Wales was named after him. There are a Kibby Avenue and Kibby Reserve in an area of Glenelg North devoted to South Australian Victoria Cross and George Cross recipients. A veteran&#x27;s shed and a street in Loxton are also named after Kibby.

<text>Bernard McQuirt VC (c. 1829 – 5 October 1888) was a British soldier born in Donaghcloney, County Down and was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was about 29 years old, and a private in the 95th (Derbyshire) Regiment of Foot (later The Sherwood Foresters (The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment) ), British Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 6 January 1858 at the capture of the town of Rowa, India for which he was awarded the VC:

==Burial==

McQuirt&#x27;s memorial stone was erected in 1995 in an Anglican graveyard in Donaghcloney, where McQuirt was born. But his remains are not in this graveyard. McQuirt died in Erney Street off the Shankill Road, Belfast, 5 October 1888, and no one knew where he was buried. In 1993, an employee of Belfast City Council, Robert Burns, found McQuirt&#x27;s registration and burial site in a Catholic plot of the Belfast City Cemetery. As there was no gravestone Burns contacted the Sherwood Foresters Museum in England and they proposed to pay for a stone. When Burns asked for permission to erect the stone in the graveyard the Catholic Church refused permission, claiming the plot was a poor plot with many other remains in the grave.

Bernard lived in obscurity at 72 Urney Street. Robert then approached the City Council for permission to erect the memorial stone on a wall in Urney Street (off Shankill Road) were Bernard McQuirt VC died in 1888. This was also rejected. Then Robert approached locals from Donaghcloney to erect the memorial stone in the local village square beside the World War I and World War II war memorial. This was also rejected. Finally a local Church of Ireland Minister offered Burns access to the local Donaghcloney Church graveyard to erect the memorial stone.

In 2000 a British Army colour party from a regiment based in Northern Ireland finally dedicated the stone in memory of Bernard McQuirt VC. The inscription on the stone states:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Sacred to the memory of Private Bernard McQuirt VC 95th The Derbyshire Regiment who won the regiment&#x27;s first VC at ROWA CENTRAL INDIA 6th January 1858 he died 5 October 1888 &quot;NINETY – FIVE&quot;&quot;

<text>George Henry Ingouville, (7 October 1826 – 13 January 1869) was a sailor in the Royal Navy and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Victoria Cross==
George Ingouville was born at St. Saviour, Jersey Channel Islands. He was 28 years old, and a Captain of the Mast in the Royal Navy during the Crimean War. On 13 July 1855 at the Fort of Viborg in the Gulf of Finland, while the boats of were engaged with the enemy, her second cutter was swamped by the blowing up of her magazine and drifted inshore under enemy guns. Captain of the Mast Ingouville, although wounded, jumped overboard, swam round to the boat&#x27;s bows, took hold of the painter and tried to turn the cutter out to sea. A lieutenant of the Royal Marine Artillery (George Dare Dowell) came to his assistance, when with three volunteers, he took off the crew from the cutter, rescued Ingouville from the water and then towed the stricken boat out of gun range.

Ingouville Place in Saint Helier in Jersey, is named after him.

<text>Brigadier General Charles FitzClarence, VC (8 May 1865 – 12 November 1914) was an Anglo-Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Charles FitzClarence was born in County Kildare, the son of Captain George FitzClarence (15 April 1836 – 24 March 1894) and Maria Henrietta Scott (1841 – 27 July 1912). He had a twin brother named Edward. His paternal grandfather was the 1st Earl of Munster, an illegitimate son of William, Duke of Clarence (later King William IV of the United Kingdom).

He was commissioned as a subaltern, with the rank of lieutenant, into the 3rd (Militia) Battalion of the South Staffordshire Regiment in February 1885. In November 1886 he transferred to the Royal Fusiliers, and the Regular Army. His early career with his new regiment, however, was blighted by several bouts of illness and he spent much of his time in administrative and staff roles.

He was promoted to captain, on augmentation, in April 1898. In 1899 he volunteered to serve as a special service officer at Mafeking, South Africa and was given the duty of training a squadron of the Protectorate Regiment.

===VC action===
FitzClarence was 34 years old, and a captain in the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment), British Army, during the Second Boer War when the following deeds took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC):

His ferocity in battle earned him the enduring nickname &#x27;The Demon&#x27;. He was a brigade major with the Rhodesian Brigade from August 1900.

He served in South Africa, being promoted from supernumerary captain to captain on augmentation in January 1901, until February 1901, at which point he transferred to the newly formed Irish Guards. He passed out from the Staff College, Camberley, which he entered as a student in January 1902, in January 1903, He then served as a brigade major of the 5th Infantry Brigade from April 1903 until 1906. Having been promoted to major in May 1904, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and then succeeded George Colborne Nugent in command of the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards in July 1909. He had a reputation as a forward thinking soldier and took an innovative, albeit demanding, approach to training. It was noted he was &quot;both loved and feared by his battalion&quot;.

He was promoted to colonel, dated March 1913, and in July went on to command the Irish Guards and regimental district again taking over Nugent.

== The Great War ==
Promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier general in August 1914, on 27 September he replaced Brigadier-General Ivor Maxse as commander of 1st Guards&#x27; Brigade with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). He held this command until he was killed in action on 12 November 1914.

On 4 October 1914, whilst 1st Guards&#x27; Brigade was holding trenches opposite the German line at the River Aisne, he ordered the Coldstream Guards to carry out a night time raid against a German position known as &#x27;Fish Hook Trench&#x27;. This was the first British trench raid of the First World War. The raid was led by Second Lieutenant Merton Beckwith-Smith and was a striking local success.

In October, FitzClarence had played a significant part in the First Battle of Ypres. Captain Valentine Williams, MC, writing in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, described the action at Gheluvelt thus: &quot;The Coldstream and Scots Guards&#x27; battalions of FitzClarence&#x27;s brigade, in trenches north of Gheluvelt, suffered terribly in a German attack, delivered in a dense mist on the morning of the 27th along the Menin road. The odds against the British were crushing, for on that day some 24,000 Germans were arrayed against about 5,000 exhausted British troops. In two days the Scots Guards lost 10 officers and 370 men killed and wounded. But the result of the day&#x27;s fighting was that the British line stood firm and unbroken, while the Germans had sustained enormous losses&quot;. Sir John French, in his Despatch published on 30 November 1914, described the fighting at this time as: &quot;Perhaps the most important and decisive attack (except that of the Prussian Guard on the 10th November) made against the 1st Corps during the whole of its arduous experiences in the neighbourhood of Ypres.&quot;

&quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; for August 1917 carries an article describing FitzClarence&#x27;s part. It was he who gave the order for the vital counter-attack of 31 October 1914. He &quot;rallied the troops and directed the successful onslaught&quot;. Lt Col. E. B. Hankey, involved in the attack, said of FitzClarence: &quot; ... by shoving us in at the time and place he did, the General saved the day.&quot;

On the morning of 11 November, the Prussian Guard attacked British troops along the Menin Road. Thirteen battalions of them came on, but only in three places did the Prussian Guard break through. On the following morning FitzClarence counter-attacked. The General himself decided to show his old regiment the way, and paid for the decision with his life. FitzClarence fell dead, and neither FitzClarence himself, nor Sir John French knew how well he had served his country at Gheluvelt.

In his Despatch of 20 November 1914, Sir John French said: &quot;Another officer whose name was particularly mentioned to me was Brigadier-General FitzClarence, VC, commanding the 1st Guards&#x27; Brigade. He was unfortunately killed in the night attack of the 11th November. His loss will be severely felt&quot;.

His most recent biographer, Spencer Jones, describes FitzClarence as exemplifying &quot;...the best aspects of the post-Boer War [British] officer class&quot; due to his &quot;courage, professionalism, natural leadership, and willingness to act upon his own initiative.&quot;

He was killed in action, aged 49, at Polygon Wood, Zonnebeke, Belgium, on 12 November 1914 whilst commanding the 1st (Guards) Brigade.

He is the highest-ranking officer inscribed on the Menin Gate Memorial in Ypres, commemorating those with no known grave.

==The medal==
His VC is in the Lord Ashcroft VC Gallery in the Imperial War Museum, London.

==Family==
On 20 April 1898, at the Citadel Church, Cairo, he married Violet Spencer-Churchill (13 June 1864 – 22 December 1941), daughter of Lord Alfred Spencer-Churchill and a granddaughter of the sixth Duke of Marlborough. The couple had two children:
* Edward Charles FitzClarence, 6th Earl of Munster (3 October 1899 – 15 November 1983)
* Joan Harriet FitzClarence (23 December 1901 – 6 January 1971)

<text>Major William Gosling VC (15 August 1892 – 12 February 1945) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

William Gosling was born in Wanborough, Wiltshire, one of four children to farmer Albert Gosling and his wife Elizabeth. After his education in the village school he worked alongside his father as a wheat farmer. Following his father&#x27;s death in a farming accident, the family relocated to Wroughton where Elizabeth, assisted by William and his two elder brothers, took up tenancy of Artis Farm.

In 1908, Gosling enlisted with the Territorial Force. At the age of 18 he emigrated to Canada, where he worked on grain silos before becoming a fireman on the Canadian Pacific Railway.

Following the outbreak of the First World War, he paid for his passage home and enlisted with the 3rd Wessex Brigade, Royal Field Artillery. He departed for France on 6 May 1915 where his battalion was attached to the 51st (Highland) Division, stationed near Arras.

During the precursor bombardment to the Battle of Arras, on 5 April 1917 Gosling was a battery sergeant in charge of several heavy trench mortars. A bomb was fired from a Stokes Mortar of Sergeant Gosling&#x27;s battery. The citation for his VC, which appeared in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; in June 1917, reads as follows:

For this action he was awarded the VC and was presented with the award by King George V outside Buckingham Palace on 21 July 1917.

After the war, Gosling returned to his home village of Wroughton to take up the tenancy of Summerhouse Farm. He was vice-president of the Wroughton branch of the Royal British Legion and served as a Parish Councillor for 14 years between 1922 and 1936. During World War II, the decorated war hero served as a major in the Home Guard.

Gosling managed and worked his dairy farm in Wroughton for the remainder of his life. He died at his home on 12 February 1945, aged 52. He is buried in the churchyard of St John the Baptist &amp; St Helen&#x27;s parish church.

<text>Major James Leith (26 May 1826 – 13 May 1869) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==
James Leith was the son of General Alexander Leith of Freefield and Glenkindie, Aberdeenshire and educated at Blackheath Proprietary School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He played cricket for Cambridge University from 1846 to 1849.

Leith was 31 years old, and a lieutenant in the 14th Light Dragoons (later 14th Hussars (The King&#x27;s)), British Army during the Indian Mutiny when, on 1 April 1858 at Betwa, India, the following deed led to his being awarded the Victoria Cross:

The medal is currently displayed at the 14th/20th King&#x27;s Hussars gallery of the Museum of Lancashire, Preston, Lancashire.

He was appointed to the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms in 1868.

<doc id="1218270" wikidata="Q1512133" url="?curid=1218270" title="Hohner Pianet">
<text>The Hohner Pianet is a type of electro-mechanical piano built by the Hohner company of Trossingen, West Germany and designed by Ernst Zacharias. The Pianet was a variant of his earlier reed-based Hohner electric piano, the Cembalet, which, like the Pianet, was intended for home use. Hohner offered both keyboards in their range until 1968. The Pianet production consisted of two distinctly different mechanism groups with characteristically different sound. The first group, lasting from introduction to 1977, had ground stainless steel reeds, a pick-up using variable capacitance, and leather-faced activation pads. The second group from 1977 until the end of production used rolled spring-steel reeds, electro-magnetic pick-ups, and moulded silicone rubber activation pads.

==Features==
The Hohner Pianet is an electro-mechanical instrument, and needs to be connected to an amplifier to produce an audible sound. It had 61 keys ranging from F1 to F6 (43.6 Hz – 1396.9 Hz). Later models had 60 keys, missing the top F. Each key is a single lever element pivoted on a fulcrum point with a spring to return it to the rest position. The key is extended at the rear so that a pad can be mounted over a tuned spring steel reed. This pad adheres to the reed when at rest, and lifts and releases the reed causing it to vibrate when the key is depressed. The vibration of the reed is converted to an electrical signal by a pick-up. The resulting sound has a complex mixture of harmonics when the reed is first struck, which later reduces to a cleaner sustained tone.

Early Pianets feature a knee lever volume control. The early 1960s Pianets (Pianet, Pianet C, Pianet CH, and Pianet N) featured lids which opened in an upright &#x27;V&#x27; to form a music stand. This feature was introduced on Cembalets and became common to both instruments. The C and N models were equipped with a vibrato circuit operated by a switch mounted next to the keyboard. The N models used a variable-resistance volume pedal cabled to a socket on the rear of the keyboard.

==History==
===1960s===
The Pianet evolved from the earlier Cembalet, introduced in 1958. Both instruments were designed by Ernst Zacharias. Zacharias became interested in keyboard instruments such as the clavichord, harpsichord and organ as a teenager, and studied electrical engineering at the University of Kiel. He began working for Hohner in 1954 after meeting designer Siegfried Mager.


The Pianet evolved through a number of model changes. These included both self-amplified versions and versions that required the use of an external amplifier and speaker. The most popular model, the Pianet N (denoting &quot;natural wood finish&quot;), evolved through two different specifications. The N had side-mounted ‘inverted-V’ legs, and could be equipped with an optional 12-watt valve amplifier, the Amplifier CP, which mounted below the unit in front of the player&#x27;s knees. 
The Pianet soon found popularity with music groups of the 1960s, including the Beatles, the Zombies and Manfred Mann. This led to Hohner to producing the Combo Pianet model in 1972. It was designed for the performing musician, without legs, and intended to be placed on top of another instrument.

===1970s===

In 1977, Hohner began producing the second group of models and ceased production of the Pianet N and Combo Pianet. The second group had two models, the Pianet T and M, and a hybrid version combined with a Clavinet, the Pianet/Clavinet Duo. These featured a change in design from electrostatic pick-ups and leather and foam pads to electromagnetic pick-ups (like the Rhodes piano) and silicone rubber pads. The reeds were also changed from the ground finish of the earlier type to a smooth milled finish, making them incompatible with earlier models.

The new range of Pianets had a mellower sound than earlier models. While it could not lend it itself well to rock music, it was aligned more with musical tastes of the time, such as the sound of a Rhodes through a chorus pedal. It was advertised as being practical and portable, but this was misleading as it did not have an inbuilt amplifier or speakers. The M model, designed for home use, was built with a wooden veneer console case with internal speakers, while the T model was vinyl covered and designed for live performance. Subsequently, Hohner produced the Pianet/Clavinet Duo model which combined a Hohner Clavinet (essentially an electric clavichord) with the Pianet T in one instrument, with an integrated preamp that allowed the player to combine the two sounds. Production ceased around 1983.

==Models==
During the production life, the case, mechanical features and electronics changed with developments in electronics, cheaper manufacturing, and fashion. These were coordinated with Cembalet production changes from the C models onward. Specific manufacturing dates are difficult because of undated sales figures and a lack of consistent worldwide availability.

It has a transistorised pre-amplifier and a volume control knob is fitted at the left end of the keyboard.

===Pianet T===
Approximate manufacturing span 1977–1983
The Pianet T introduced a very innovative electro-mechanical system where by vibrating reeds are plucked by plastic suction pads (patented by NASA). The Pianet T does not require electrical power. The vibrations are converted into electrical energy via an electro-magnetic pick-up. The reeds immediately become damped on release of the keys.
The Pianet T has a rectangular case profile with rounded corners and a hinged integral lid with central handle. With the lid latched closed the instrument forms its own carry case. The body of the case is covered with black vinyl leathercloth and the ends are padded with vinyl-skinned urethane foam. There are no legs supplied as standard. An optional stand can be fixed to threaded mounting points on the ends of the case. The keys are injection-moulded plastic over pressed metal frames. The words &#x27;Pianet T&#x27; are screen printed in silver on the rear of the case and on the inside surface of the lid.

===Pianet M===
Approximate manufacturing span 1977–1983

The Pianet M has the Pianet T mechanism built into a rectilinear wood grain console case. There is no lid over the keys. Sitting above the box that holds the playing mechanism is an amplifier housing with a sloped front face and two player facing cloth speaker-grills. An acrylic music rest slots into the top of this housing. The leg panels are wood-grained boards finished with a timber foot and joined by a horizontal wood grained panel. The word &#x27;Hohner&#x27; is printed in gold centrally above the keys. The model &#x27;Pianet – M&#x27; is printed on the amplifier cover panel at the rear. Built in Hohner Modulator, another invention of Ernst Zacharias.

===Pianet/Clavinet Duo===
Approximate manufacturing span 1978–1983

This hybrid model uses a black case in the style of a Clavinet E7. The Duo has a rectangular case profile with rounded corners and a removable lid to protect the keys and control surface for transport. Samples can be found with both versions of the name: Pianet Clavinet Duo and Clavinet Pianet Duo. The control panels at the left hand end of the instrument include keyboard splits and mixtures of the two instruments as well as normal Clavinet mixture controls.

==Users==
Early Pianets were used on a number of hit recordings from the 1960s and 1970s, including &quot;She&#x27;s Not There&quot; by The Zombies; &quot;Louie Louie&quot; by The Kingsmen; &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;, &quot;Getting Better&quot;, &quot;The Night Before&quot;, &quot;Tell Me What You See&quot;, &quot;You Like Me Too Much&quot; by The Beatles; &quot;This Guy&#x27;s in Love With You&quot; by Herb Alpert; &quot;These Eyes&quot; by The Guess Who Summer in the City by The Loving Spoonful. In the glam rock era, the Pianet was used by Bryan Ferry on the first few Roxy Music albums, for instance featuring prominently in their hit &quot;Editions of You&quot;. It was a staple of the &quot;classic lineup&quot; sound of Curved Air (1970–1972), featuring prominently on their first 3 albums, played by both guitarist/keyboardist Francis Monkman and violinist Darryl Way. The 1972–74 lineup of progressive rock pioneers King Crimson used a pair of Pianets in live performance, played both by the group&#x27;s violinist David Cross, and the guitarist, Robert Fripp. Genesis keyboardist Tony Banks used the Pianet prominently in the group&#x27;s early career, as a lead instrument through a homemade fuzz box.

Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s Christine McVie was a noted proponent of the Pianet N and Combo Pianet for live use. In an article written by Bob Doerschuk in the October 1980 issue of &quot;Contemporary Keyboard&quot; she outlined why she preferred the sound of the 1960s Pianets live and why she eventually replaced them with other keyboards.

The Pianet is enjoying a renaissance (e.g. Bugge Wesseltoft&#x27;s &quot;Change&quot;) due to its unique sound and the availability of new pads for the earlier models, most of which had been reduced to unplayability due to pad decay. It is also popular as a substitute for the Fender Rhodes or Wurlitzer electric piano, which has a related reed-based mechanism for generating sound but is typically much heavier, requires more maintenance than the Pianet, and is overall more expensive.

==Restoration issues==
Following the end of production, replacement parts for Pianets became progressively harder to find because they were no longer being supported by Hohner. The principal problem was the activation pads for 1960s-manufactured models, which used a Urethane foam damper behind the leather surface. This decomposed with age, making the pads unusable. Hohner intended the pads to be a service-replaceable item (like the strings of a guitar), and sold spares while the instrument was in production. After the supply ran out, restorers and players had to create their own pads.

The second group of Pianets, the T and M, used silicone rubber for their pads. They have aged extremely well and are still functional in most keyboards, as of 2012. The silicone pads of the T &amp; M are not suitable for the 1960s Pianets. Their adhesion properties don&#x27;t suit the ground reeds of the first group of instruments, and they produce a static discharge that is amplified by the capacitive pick-up of the instrument. In the 2000s, a number of businesses took up the servicing and maintenance of vintage keyboards, so pads suitable for both groups of Pianets are now available.

The mechanical structure of keys, pivot rail, reeds, reed bar and pick-up are the same in the 1960s Pianets from the &quot;Mk.1&quot; and C to the Combo, so spares to get a Pianet working can come from most models. While the electronics differ from model to model, they can be exchanged if the aim is to make a keyboard playable rather than to restore it.

<text>Major John Simpson Knox (30 September 1828 – 8 January 1897) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and military career==
Born in Glasgow on 30 September 1828, Knox joined the British Army at the age of 14. He was under-age, but was unusually tall, he was promoted to corporal before reaching the age of 18.

==Crimean War==
By the time of the Crimean War he was serjeant in the Scots Fusilier Guards (now called simply the Scots Guards). The British and French forces began to land on the Crimean Peninsula on 14 September 1854. On 19 September the combined forces moved off toward Sebastopol and on 20 September came the first major engagement of the campaign, the Battle of the Alma.

The Scots Fusilier Guards were part of the 1st Division, brigaded with 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards and 1st Battalion, Coldstream Guards, the division&#x27;s other brigade was the Highland Brigade. The division was at the extreme left of the Allied line (furthest inland), and initially in reserve to the Light Division. The two divisions halted a short distance before the Alma River, the Russians having taken up defensive positions just the other side of river. Here, on the further side of the river the British troops faced first fording the river itself, climbing the bank on its far side, then after a small amount of level ground, a further relatively low, but steep bank, and then a gradual upward slope, at the top of which the Russians had built an earthworks armed with artillery. The British contingents were ordered forward at about 14:45, the French having managed to force a crossing further downstream, near the river&#x27;s mouth. The Light Division crossed first, but were thrown into confusion by the Russian artillery, and began to withdraw. The Guards&#x27; Brigade was ordered forward, and crossed the river. The battalions began re-establishing their ranks on the other side having scrambled up both of the banks on that side of the river. The brigadier ordered them forward without delay, and the Scots, in the middle of the Guards&#x27; line obeyed. They began their advance, but the retreating troops of the Light Division broke their line, and some of the Scots Guards joined the retreat. Officers and others, prominent among them Knox, regained control, and rallied much of the battalion. It was this action which was the first of those for which he was eventually awarded the VC. Four other Scots Guards were also to be awarded the VC for their actions that day. In a letter to his family, he described the battle:

He was commissioned (without purchase) into the 93rd Regiment of Foot as an ensign on 27 February 1855. On 20 April 1855 he was transferred to the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own) as a lieutenant, and his original commission was backdated to 5 November 1854.

On 18 June 1855, Knox volunteered for the ladder party in the attack on the Redan, an attempt to finish the Siege of Sevastopol, he was struck by a Russian cannonball, removing part of his left arm. His actions that day also contributed toward his receiving the VC. His Crimea Medal shows that he also fought at the Battle of Balaclava and the Battle of Inkerman.

On 29 January 1856 Queen Victoria signed the warrant creating the Victoria Cross with the intention of rewarding acts of valour in the Crimean War. Knox&#x27;s VC was one of the first 85 VCs gazetted on 24 February 1857, by which time he had already been made a Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur gazetted on 16 June 1856. His VC citation read:

When serving as a Serjeant in the Scots Fusilier Guards, Lieutenant Knox was conspicuous for his exertions in reforming the ranks of the Guards at the Battle of the Alma.

Subsequently, when in the Rifle Brigade, he volunteered for the ladder-party in the attack on the Redan, on 18 June, and (in the words of Captain Blackett, under whose command he was) behaved admirably, remaining on the field until twice wounded.

He was among the 62 men at the first presentation of the VC, made by Queen Victoria in Hyde Park, London on 26 June 1857. His action at the Alma was the earliest for which a VC was awarded to a member of the British Army—earlier actions leading to the award of a VC were carried out by members of the Royal Navy.

==Later life==

Despite the loss of his arm, he continued to serve, and was appointed an Instructor of Musketry on 7 January 1858, and promoted captain on 30 April. On 15 June 1866 he was appointed Inspector of Musketry for the South Western District. He briefly returned to regimental duties from 22 January 1872, and on his retirement from the army on 8 June 1872 was granted a brevet majority. He took up residence at Cheltenham where he died on 8 January 1897, and was buried in the town&#x27;s cemetery where three other VC recipients also lie.

==Sale of medals==
In March 2010 it was announced that his VC is to be sold at auction in May by medal and coin specialists Spink&#x27;s, with an estimated price of £100,000–120,000. His VC was sold along with his Crimean War campaign medals, insignia of the Légion d&#x27;honneur, and the Russian cannonball which caused the partial loss of his left arm at the Redan. No details of the current owner have been given. The sale took place on 22 April 2010 with the medal and the cannonball being sold for £252,000 ($387,500) to an anonymous buyer.

<text>Eustace Jotham VC (28 November 1883 – 7 January 1915) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and career==
Born in Kidderminster 28 November 1883, Jotham attended Lucton School in Herefordshire for five years and at the age of 16, in 1899, he transferred to Bromsgrove School. In 1901, at the age of 18, he left to attend the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned into the Prince of Wales&#x27;s (North Staffordshire) Regiment as a second lieutenant on 22 April 1903 and joined the 2nd Battalion of his regiment, embarking for a tour of duty in India.

In 1903 Jotham sailed to India with the North Staffords and served with them until 1905. Under the Indian Army regulations for admission paragraph 13 British army officers could transfer to the Indian army. Jotham transferred to the Indian Army on 23 June 1905 (backdated to his commissioning date in 1903), and promoted to lieutenant in the 102nd Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Grenadiers on 22 July 1905. In October 1906 he transferred to the 51st Sikhs and is listed in the records as a &#x27;double company officer&#x27;. He was promoted captain on 22 April 1912.

In 1913 he returned to England for what would be his last period of home leave. Just before he returned to India he was a passenger on a train involved in the accident at Ais Gill and participated in rescue operations. He appeared as a witness at the inquiry held immediately after the accident.

On his return to India he was attached to the North Waziristan Militia during 1914–1915 and it was during this attachment on operations in the Tochi Valley area of the North West Frontier that he was killed in action on 7 January 1915. His bravery during these operations earned him a posthumous Victoria Cross.

==Citation==
==Burial and memorials==
He was buried in the Miranshah Cemetery, North Waziristan, and is commemorated on the Delhi Memorial (India Gate).

On 7 January 2015, the 100th anniversary of his death, a memorial paving stone to Jotham was unveiled at St Mary&#x27;s and All Saints Church in his home town of Kidderminster. Jotham&#x27;s VC is held at Bromsgrove School.

<text>Horace Henry Glasock VC (16 October 1880 – 20 October 1916) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that may be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Glasock was 19 years old, and a driver in &#x27;Q&#x27; Battery, Royal Horse Artillery, British Army during the Second Boer War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

==Victoria Cross==
On 31 March 1900 at Sanna&#x27;s Post (aka Korn Spruit), South Africa, &#x27;Q&#x27; and &#x27;U&#x27; batteries of the Royal Horse Artillery were ambushed with the loss of most of the baggage column and five guns of the leading battery. When the alarm was given, &#x27;Q&#x27; Battery went into action 1150 yards from the spruit, until the order to retire was received, when Major Phipps-Hornby, commanding officer of the battery, ordered the guns and their limbers to be run back by hand to a safe place. This most exhausting operation was carried out by, among others, Driver Glasock, Sergeant Charles Parker and Gunner Isaac Lodge. When at last all but one of the guns and one limber had been moved to safety, the battery was reformed.

===Citation===
The citation reads:
Glasock was one of the gunners and drivers, elected as described above.

Lieutenant Francis Aylmer Maxwell also earned the Victoria Cross in this action.

==Later life==

Following his service in the Boer War, he remained in the Royal Horse Artillery until 1911, when he was discharged. He then emigrated to South Africa and settled in Johannesburg with his wife. On the outbreak of World War I, he served as a Conductor with Transports and Remounts in the South African Service Corps. Glasock died whilst in service at Cape Town on 20 October 1916, just four days after his 36th birthday. He was buried in Maitland Cemetery, Cape Town.

<text>John Divane (VC; November 1823 – 1 December 1888), also known as Devine and Duane, was an Irish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Biography==
He was born in Carrabane, County Galway and died at 1 New Street, Penzance, Cornwall on 1 December 1888 and, was buried in an unmarked grave in Penzance cemetery. A headstone was installed in 1995 during a ceremony attended by Field Marshal Lord Bramall and in 2015 a plaque was unveiled at 35 New Street, Penzance.

Apparently only semi-literate, Duane put &quot;the tail&quot; on the wrong side of his &quot;u&quot; on his signature, which led to confusion about the correct spelling of his surname in official records. Duane is one of several soldiers from Carrabane (modern Kilconierin-Lickerrig-Clostoken parish) to fight with distinction in theatres of war throughout the nineteenth century.

==Victoria Cross award==
He was approximately 34 years old, and a private in the 1st Battalion, 60th Rifles (later The King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps), British Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 10 September 1857 at Delhi, India for which he was awarded the VC:

<doc id="1218277" wikidata="Q7346160" url="?curid=1218277" title="Robert Johnston (VC)">
<text>Major Robert Johnston (County Donegal, 13 August 1872 – Kilkenny, County Kilkenny, 24 March 1950) was an Irish rugby union player and soldier. During the Second Boer War, Johnston was awarded the Victoria Cross while serving with the Imperial Light Horse. He played rugby for both Ireland and the British Lions. He is one of three Ireland rugby union internationals to have been awarded the Victoria Cross. The other two are Thomas Crean, who also served with the Imperial Light Horse in the Second Boer War, and Frederick Harvey who served in the First World War. Johnston, Crean and Harvey all played club rugby for Wanderers. In 1896 Johnston and Crean were also members of the same British Lions squad that toured South Africa. Johnston was also one of three alumni of King William&#x27;s College to have been awarded the VC. The other two were George Stuart White and Robert Henry Cain. White served in the Second Anglo-Afghan War and Cain served in the Second World War.

==Early years==
Johnston was born at Laputa, near the townland of Clyhore (or Cloughore), between Ballyshannon and Belleek in the south of County Donegal in Ulster. He was the son of Robert Johnston, who served as a Q.C. in County Donegal. He was educated at King William&#x27;s College on the Isle of Man.

==Rugby international==

===Ireland===
In 1893, Johnston made two appearances for Ireland. He made his international debut on 4 February 1893 in a 4–0 defeat against England at Lansdowne Road. Then on 11 March he played in a 2–0 defeat against Wales at Stradey Park. Two of his brothers were also Ireland internationals.

===British Lions===
In 1896 Johnston was a member of the British Lions squad for their tour to South Africa. He was part of strong Irish contingent, being one of nine Irishmen selected. The others included Thomas Crean, Louis Magee, Jim Magee, Larry Bulger, Jim Sealy, Andrew Clinch, Arthur Meares and Cecil Boyd. He played in three of the four tests against South Africa.

==Military career==
When the British Lions tour ended, Johnston, together with Thomas Crean, decided to stay on in South Africa. He played rugby for Transvaal and captained them in the Currie Cup. In 1899, at the start of the Second Boer War, again with Crean, he enlisted in the Imperial Light Horse and Johnston subsequently reached the rank of major. Johnston was already an experienced soldier, having previously served with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers between 1890 and 1894. He served in South Africa between 1899 and 1901 and was dangerously wounded during the Siege of Ladysmith. In October 1899, according to the &quot;Irish Times&quot;, the Imperial Light Horse particularly distinguished themselves in the Battle of Elandslaagte and it was during this engagement that Johnston, while still a captain, won his VC. The joint citation for him and Captain Charles Mullins reads:

Johnston was badly wounded and was nursed back to health by Crean. He travelled to London in early 1901, and both he and Mullins received the VC from King Edward during an investiture at Marlborough House 25 July 1901. Johnston was awarded the Queen&#x27;s South Africa Medal with clasps Elandslaagte and Defence of Ladysmith and the King&#x27;s South Africa Medal with clasps South Africa 1901 and South Africa 1902 for his service in South Africa. The location of his medals is unknown.

Mullins was the brother of Cuth Mullins who had earlier been one of Johnston&#x27;s British Lions team-mates. In 1902 he was Commandant at a concentration camp at Middelburg, Mpumalanga and in 1903 he was a District Commissioner in the Eastern Transvaal.

==Later years==
In 1911 Johnston returned to Ireland and joined the General Prisons Board for Ireland (the G.P.B.). He was Commandant of the POW camp at Oldcastle 1914–15, and was appointed Governor of His Majesty&#x27;s Convict Prison at Maryborough in 1915, before returning to Oldcastle in 1916. In 1918 he was appointed a resident magistrate. He later settled in Kilkenny, where he died. Conflicting sources give his date of death as either 1950 or 1970. He was buried in St. Mary&#x27;s Churchyard, Inistioge, County Kilkenny.

In 2019 his story along with other Wanderers Victoria Cross recipients Thomas Crean and Frederick Harvey was told in a documentary entitled &quot;Mark Our Place&quot; directed and Produced by Ashley Morrison.

<text>Biopower (or &quot;biopouvoir&quot; in French), coined by French social theorist Michel Foucault, refers to various means by which modern nation states control their populations. In Foucault&#x27;s work, it has been used to refer to practices of public health, regulation of heredity, and risk regulation, among many other regulatory mechanisms often linked less directly with literal physical health. Foucault first used the term in his lecture courses at the Collège de France, and the term first appeared in print in &quot;The Will to Knowledge&quot;, Foucault&#x27;s first volume of &quot;The History of Sexuality&quot;. It is closely related to a term he uses much less frequently, but which subsequent thinkers have taken up independently, biopolitics, which aligns more closely with the examination of the strategies and mechanisms through which human life processes are managed under regimes of authority over knowledge, power, and the processes of subjectivation.

== Foucault&#x27;s conception ==
For Foucault, biopower is a technology of power for managing humans in large groups; the distinctive quality of this political technology is that it allows for the control of entire populations. It refers to the control of human bodies through an &quot;anatomo-politics of the human body&quot; and &quot;biopolitics of the population&quot; through societal &quot;disciplinary institutions&quot;. Modern power, according to Foucault&#x27;s analysis, becomes encoded into social practices as well as human behavior, as the human subject gradually acquiesces to subtle regulations and expectations of the social order. It is an integral feature and essential to the workings of—and makes possible the emergence of—the modern nation state, capitalism, etc. Biopower is literally having power over bodies; it is &quot;an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugation of bodies and the control of populations&quot;. Foucault elaborates further in his lecture courses on biopower entitled &quot;Security, Territory, Population&quot; delivered at the Collège de France between January and April 1978:

It relates to governmental concerns of fostering the life of the population, &quot;an &quot;anatomo-politics of the human body&quot; a global mass that is affected by overall characteristics specific to life, like birth, death, production, illness, and so on. It produces a generalized disciplinary society and &quot;regulatory controls&quot; through &quot;biopolitics of the population&quot;&quot;. In his lecture &quot;Society Must Be Defended&quot;, Foucault examines &quot;biopolitical state racism&quot;, and its accomplished rationale of myth-making and narrative. Mark Kelly explains the fundamental difference between biopolitics and discipline:

Foucault argues that the previous Greco-Roman, medieval rule of the Roman emperor, the Divine right of kings, Absolute monarchy and the popes model of power and social control over the body was an individualising mode based on a singular individual, primarily the king, Holy Roman emperor, pope and Roman emperor. However, after the emergence of the medieval metaphor body politic which meant society as a whole with the ruler, in this case the king, as the head of society with the so-called Estates of the realm and the medieval Roman Catholic Church next to the monarch with the majority of the peasant population or feudal serfs at the bottom of the hierarchical pyramid. This meaning of the metaphor was then codified into medieval law for the offense of high treason and if found guilty the sentence of Hanged, drawn and quartered was carried out. However, this was drastically altered in 18th century Europe with the advent and realignment of modern political power as opposed to the ancient world and medieval version of political power. The mass democracy of the Liberal western world and the voting franchise was added to the mass population; liberal democracy and Political parties; universal adult suffrage-exclusively male at this time, then extended to women in Europe from 1906 (Finland) - 1971 (Switzerland, see Women&#x27;s suffrage in Switzerland), and extending to people of African descent in America with the abolition of the infamous Jim Crow laws in 1964 (see Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965).

The emergence of the human sciences and its subsequent direction, during the 16th and 18th centuries, primarily aimed at the modern Western man and the society he inhabits, aided the development of &quot;Disciplinary institution&quot; and furthermore, Foucault cites the human sciences, particularly the medical sciences, led to the advent of &quot;anatomo-politics of the human body,&quot; a biopolitics and bio-history of man. A transition occurred through forcible removal of various European monarchs into a &quot;scientific&quot; state apparatus and the radical overhaul of judiciary practices coupled with the reinvention and division of those who were to be punished.

A second mode for seizure of power was developed as a type of power that was stochastic and &quot;massifying&quot; rather than &quot;individualizing&quot;. By &quot;massifying&quot; Foucault means transforming into a population (&quot;population state&quot;), with an extra added impetus of a governing mechanism in the form of a scientific machinery and apparatus. This scientific mechanism which we now know as the State &quot;governs less&quot; of the population and concentrates more on administrating external devices. Foucault then reminds us that this &quot;anatomo-biopoltics&quot; of the body (and human life) and the population correlates with the new founded knowledge of sciences and the &#x27;new&#x27; politics of modern society, masquerading as liberal democracy, where life (biological life) itself became not only a deliberate political strategy but an economic, political and scientific problem, both for the mathematical sciences and the biological sciences–coupled together with the nation state.

Foucault argues that nation states, police, government, legal practices, human sciences and medical institutions have their own rationale, cause and effects, strategies, technologies, mechanisms and codes and have managed successfully in the past to obscure their workings by hiding behind observation and scrutiny. Foucault insists social institutions such as governments, laws, religion, politics, social administration, monetary institutions, military institutions cannot have the same rigorous practices and procedure with claims to independent knowledge like those of the human and &#x27;hard&#x27; sciences, such as mathematics, chemistry, astronomy, physics, genetics, and biology. Foucault sees these differences in techniques as nothing more than &quot;behaviour control technologies&quot;, and modern biopower as nothing more than a series of webs and networks working its way around the societal body.

However, Foucault argues the exercise of power in the service of maximizing life carries a dark underside. When the state is invested in protecting the life of the population, when the stakes are life itself, anything can be justified. Groups identified as the threat to the existence of the life of the nation or of humanity can be eradicated with impunity.

== &quot;Milieu intérieur&quot; ==

Foucault concentrates his attention on what he calls the major political and social project, namely the Milieu, or the environment within. Foucault takes as his starting point the 16th century, continuing to the 18th century, with the milieu culminating into the founding disciplines of science, mathematics, political economy and statistics. Foucault makes an explicit point on the value of secrecy of government (&quot;arcana imperii,&quot; from the Latin which means secrecy of power, secrets of the empire, which goes back to the time of the Roman empire in the age of Tacitus) coined by Jean Bodin and was incorporated into a politics of truth. Foucault insists, in referring to the term &#x27;public opinion&#x27; (&#x27;politics of truth&#x27;), that the concept of truth refers to the term &#x27;regimes of truth&#x27;. He mentions a group called &quot;The Ideologues&quot; where the term &quot;Ideology&quot; first appears and is taken from. Foucault argues that it is through &#x27;regimes of truth&#x27; that raison d&#x27;état achieves its political and biological success. Here the modern version of government is presented to the population in the national media—in the electronic media television and radio, and especially in the written press—as the modicum of efficiency, fiscal optimisation, political responsibility, and fiscal rigorousness. Thus, a public discourse of government solidarity emerges and social consensus is emphasised through these four points. This impression of joint solidarity is continuously reproduced through inherited political rationality, in turn giving the machine (Foucault uses the term Dispositif) of the State not only legitimacy but an air of invincibility from its main primary sources: reason, truth, freedom, and human existence. Foucault traces the first dynamics, the first historical dimensions, as belonging to the early Middle Ages. 

One major thinker whose work forms a parallel with Foucault&#x27;s own is the medieval historian Ernst Kantorowicz. Kantorowicz mentions a medieval device known as the body politic (the king&#x27;s two bodies). This medieval device was so well received by legal theorists and lawyers of the day that it was incorporated and codified into medieval society and institutions (Kantorowicz mentions the term Corporation which would later become known to us as capitalism, an economic category). Kantorowicz also refers to the Glossators who belonged to a well-known branch of legal schools in medieval Europe, experts in jurisprudence and law science, appeal of treason, The Lords Appellant and the commentaries of jurist Edmund Plowden and his Plowden Reports. In Kantorowicz&#x27; analysis, a medieval political theology emerged throughout the Middle Ages which provided the modern basis for the democratisation of the hereditary succession of a wealthy elite and for our own modern political hierarchical order (Politicians) and their close association with the wealthy nobility. Primarily, this is the democratisation of Sovereignty, which is known in modern political terms as &quot;Liberal democracy&quot;. Kantorowicz argues a medieval triumvirate appears (with the support of the legal machine), a private enterprise of wealth and succession both supporting the fixed hierarchical order reserved exclusively for the nobility and their descendants, and the monarch and her/his heirs. Co-operation was needed by the three groups—the Monarchy, the Church, and the Nobility—in an uneasy medieval alliance and, at times, it appeared fractious. 

What is the reasoning behind the whole population subservience with the worshiping of state emblems, symbols and related mechanisms with their associates who represent the institutional mechanism (democratization of sovereignty); where fierce loyalty from the population is presented, in modern times as universal admiration for the president, the monarch, the Pope and the prime minister? Foucault would argue that while all the cost benefits were met by the newly founded urban population in the form of production and Political power, it is precisely this type of behaviour which enables social cohesion, and supports the raison dêtre of the Nation state as well as its capacity to &quot;govern less.&quot;

Foucault makes special note on the biological &quot;naturalness&quot; of the human species and the new founded scientific interest that was developing around not only with the species interaction with milieu and technology, but most importantly, technology operating as system not as so often portrayed by the political and social sciences which insisted on technology operating as social improvement. Both milieu, natural sciences and technology, allied with the characteristics surrounding social organization and increasingly the categorization of the sciences to help deal with this &quot;naturalness&quot; of milieu and of the inscription of truth onto nature. Due to Foucault&#x27;s discussions with Georges Canguilhem, Foucault notices that not only was milieu now a newly discovered scientific biological naturalness ever-present in Lamarckian Biology the notion (biological naturalness) was actually invented and imported from Newtonian mechanics (Classical mechanics) via Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon due to Buffon mentorship and friendship with Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and used by Biology in the middle of the 18th century borrowing from Newton the explanatory model of an organic reaction through the action of &quot;milieu Newtonian&quot; physics used by Isaac Newton and the Newtonians. Humans (the species being mentioned in Marx) were now both the object of this newly discovered scientific and &quot;natural&quot; truth and new categorization, but subjected to it allied by laws, both scientific and natural law (scientific Jurisprudence), the state&#x27;s mode of governmental rationality to the will of its population. But, most importantly, interaction with the social environment and social interactions with others and the modern nation state&#x27;s interest in the populations well-being and the destructive capability that the state possess in its armoury and it was with the group who called themselves the &quot;économistes&quot; (Vincent de Gournay, François Quesnay, François Véron Duverger de Forbonnais, and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot) who continued with the rationalization of this &quot;naturalness&quot;. Foucault notices that this &quot;naturalness&quot; continues and is extended further with the advent of 18th century political society with the new founded implement &quot;population&quot; and their (political population) association with raison d&#x27;état.

<text>Thomas Currie &quot;Diver&quot; Derrick, (20 March 1914 – 24 May 1945) was an Australian soldier and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest decoration for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. In November 1943, during the Second World War, Derrick was awarded the Victoria Cross for his assault on a heavily defended Japanese position at Sattelberg, New Guinea. During the engagement, he scaled a cliff face while under heavy fire and silenced seven machine gun posts, before leading his platoon in a charge that destroyed a further three.

Born in the Adelaide suburb of Medindie, South Australia, Derrick left school at the age of fourteen and found work in a bakery. As the Great Depression grew worse he lost his job and moved to Berri, working on a fruit farm before marrying in 1939. In July 1941, Derrick enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force, joining the 2/48th Battalion. He was posted to the Middle East, where he took part in the siege of Tobruk, was recommended for the Military Medal and promoted to corporal. Later, at El Alamein, Derrick was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for knocking out three German machine gun posts, destroying two tanks, and capturing one hundred prisoners.

Derrick returned to Australia with his battalion in February 1943, before transferring to the South West Pacific Theatre where he fought in the battle to capture Lae. Back in Australia the following February he was posted to an officer cadet training unit, being commissioned lieutenant in November 1944. In April 1945 his battalion was sent to the Pacific island of Morotai, an assembly point for the Allied invasion of the Philippines. Engaged in action the following month on the heavily defended hill &quot;Freda&quot; on Tarakan Island, Derrick was hit by five bullets from a Japanese machine gun. He died from his wounds on 24 May 1945.

==Early life==
Derrick was born on 20 March 1914 at the McBride Maternity Hospital in the Adelaide suburb of Medindie, South Australia, to David Derrick, a labourer from Ireland, and his Australian wife, Ada (née Whitcombe). The Derricks were poor, and Tom often walked barefoot to attend Sturt Street Public School and later Le Fevre Peninsula School. In 1928, aged fourteen, Derrick left school and found work in a bakery. By this time, he had developed a keen interest in sports, particularly cricket, Australian Rules Football, boxing and swimming; his diving in the Port River earned him the nickname of &quot;Diver&quot;.

With the advent of the Great Depression, Derrick scraped a living from odd jobs—such as fixing bicycles and selling newspapers—to supplement his job as a baker. When in 1931, the Depression worsened, Derrick lost his bakery job and, with friends, headed by bicycle for the regional town of Berri, approximately away, in search of work. Jobs in Berri were hard to come by and Derrick and two friends spent the next few months living in a tent on the banks of the Murray River. When the annual Royal Adelaide Show opened that year, Derrick went to the boxing pavilion to accept a challenge of staying upright for three rounds with the ex-lightweight champion of Australia. Although he was knocked down in the second round, he immediately got back to his feet and won the bet; albeit at the cost of a black eye, and a few bruised ribs.

Eventually, towards the end of 1931, Derrick found work picking fruit at a vineyard in Winkie, a short distance outside Berri. He later moved on to a full-time job at a nearby fruit farm, remaining there for the next nine years. On 24 June 1939, Derrick married Clarance Violet &quot;Beryl&quot; Leslie—his &quot;one true love&quot; whom he had met at a dance in Adelaide seven years earlier—at St Laurence&#x27;s Catholic Church, North Adelaide.

==Second World War==
Derrick did not join up when war broke out in September 1939 but, like many Australians, enlisted after the fall of France in June 1940. He joined the Second Australian Imperial Force on 5 July 1940, and was posted to the 2/48th Battalion, 26th Brigade, as a private. Derrick first joined his unit at the Wayville Showgrounds, before basic training at Woodside.&lt;ref name=&quot;2/48&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Derrick thrived on military life, but found discipline difficult to accept.

In October, the 2/48th Battalion paraded through the streets of Adelaide to Mitcham railway station before its embarkation for the Middle East. The battalion&#x27;s voyage overseas was postponed until 17 November, when the unit boarded the . The ship made a stop at Perth, where Derrick was confined on board for going absent without leave to sightsee. He was soon in more trouble, and was charged and fined for punching another soldier who taunted him over this incident.

===North Africa===
On arrival in Palestine, the 2/48th Battalion encamped at El Kantara and began training in desert warfare. For relaxation, the battalion set up athletic events, and Derrick became well known for often winning cross-country races—and for organising a book on the outcomes. In March 1941, the unit went by train and truck to Alexandria, Egypt, then along the North African coast to Cyrenaica, in Libya, to join the 9th Australian Division.

After the 2/48th Battalion completed its training with the 9th Division at Cyrenaica, they were moved further along the coast to Gazala. Then, just as they began to dig in, the battalion was abruptly withdrawn to Tobruk in response to the German Afrika Korps&#x27; advance. They entered Tobruk on 9 April 1941, and spent the following eight months besieged by Axis forces. While there, Derrick acquired an Italian Breda machine gun and regularly led fighting patrols against both German and Italian troops. Although Derrick&#x27;s bravery was noted during the siege, he wrote in his diary about his constant fear of dying.

On the night of 30 April, the Axis forces assaulted Tobruk&#x27;s outer defences and managed to capture substantial ground. In response, the 2/48th Battalion was ordered to counter-attack the following evening. During the ensuing engagement, Derrick fought as a section member in the far left flank of the attack. After suffering heavy casualties in what Derrick described as &quot;a bobby dazzler of a fire fight&quot;, the battalion was forced to withdraw. Praised for his leadership and bravery during the assault, Derrick was immediately promoted to corporal, and recommended for the Military Medal, but the award was never made.

In late May, Derrick discovered a German posing as a British tank officer and reported him to company headquarters; the man was immediately arrested as a spy. Following a period of heavy fighting in June, the 2/48th Battalion was placed in reserve for a few days the following month. Promoted to platoon sergeant in September, Derrick—along with the rest of his battalion—was withdrawn from Tobruk and returned to Palestine aboard on 22 October. Disembarking at Tel Aviv, they were given three days&#x27; leave in the city, before returning for training.

Following a period of rest and light garrison duties in Syria, the 2/48th Battalion was rushed to El Alamein, Egypt, to reinforce the British Eighth Army. During the First Battle of El Alamein on 10 July 1942, Derrick took part in the 26th Australian Brigade&#x27;s attack on Tel el Eisa. In the initial assault, Derrick, against a barrage of German grenades, led an attack against three machine gun posts and succeeded in destroying the positions before capturing over one hundred prisoners. During the Axis counter-attack that evening, the Australian line was overrun by tanks. As the German infantry following the tanks advanced, Derrick&#x27;s company led a charge against the men. During the engagement, Derrick managed to destroy two German tanks using sticky bombs. Commended for his &quot;outstanding leadership and courage&quot;, Derrick was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his part in the fighting at Tel el Eisa. The award was announced in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 18 February 1943.

Promoted to sergeant on 28 July, Derrick led a six-man reconnaissance on 3 October, successfully pinpointing several German machine gun positions and strongholds; this information was to be vital for the upcoming Second Battle of El Alamein. The El Alamein offensive was launched on 23 October, the 9th Australian Division taking part. At one point during the engagement, Derrick jumped up onto an Allied gun carrier heading towards the Germans. Armed with a Thompson submachine gun and under intense heavy fire, Derrick attacked and knocked out three machine gun posts while standing in the carrier. He then had the driver reverse up to each post so he could ensure each position was silenced. By the following morning, Derrick&#x27;s platoon occupied all three posts. The members of the 2/48th Battalion who witnessed Derrick&#x27;s action were sure he would be awarded the Victoria Cross, though no recommendation was made.

For part of 31 October, Derrick assumed command of his company after all of the unit&#x27;s officers had been killed or wounded in fierce fighting. On 21 November 1942, Derrick was briefly admitted to the 2/3rd Australian Field Ambulance with slight shrapnel wounds to his right hand and buttock. Twelve days later, the 2/48th Battalion left El Alamein and returned to Gaza in Palestine, where, later that month, Derrick attended a corps patrolling course. In January 1943, the 2/48th Battalion sailed home to Australia, aboard the along with the rest of the 9th Division.

===South West Pacific===
Disembarking at Port Melbourne in late February 1943, Derrick was granted a period of leave and travelled by train to Adelaide where he spent time with Beryl. He rejoined his battalion—now encamped in the outskirts of Adelaide—before they went by train to the Atherton Tableland for training in jungle warfare. Brought up to full strength by the end of April, the 2/48th Battalion completed its training following landing-craft exercises near Cairns. On 23 July, Derrick was attached to the 21st Brigade Headquarters but admitted to hospital for old injuries to his right eye later the same day. After hospital, Derrick returned briefly to brigade headquarters before rejoining the 2/48th Battalion on 27 August.

For much of August, the 2/48th Battalion had been in training for the Allied attack on Lae, in Papua New Guinea. The unit&#x27;s objective was to land on a strip of land designated as &quot;Red Beach&quot;, and then fight their way approximately west towards Lae. Following a bombardment by American destroyers, Derrick&#x27;s wave landed on the beach with minimal casualties on 4 September. Ten days later, the 2/48th Battalion&#x27;s C Company—led by Derrick&#x27;s platoon—captured Malahang airstrip, before Lae fell to the Allies on 16 September. Derrick was scornful of the Japanese defence of Lae, and wrote in his diary that &quot;our greatest problem was trying to catch up&quot; with the retreating Japanese force.

====Victoria Cross====
Following Lae, the 9th Division was tasked to seize Finschhafen, clear the Huon Peninsula and gain control of the Vitiaz Strait. By 2 October, one of the division&#x27;s brigades had gained a foothold on Finschhafen, but soon encountered fierce Japanese resistance. In response to a Japanese counter-attack, the 26th Brigade was transferred to reinforce the Australian position on 20 October and, when the division switched to the offensive in November, the brigade was ordered to capture Sattelberg. Sattelberg was a densely wooded hill rising and dominating the Finschhafen region; it was in an assault on this position that Derrick was to earn the Victoria Cross.

The Australian attack on Sattelberg began in mid-November, the Japanese slowly giving ground and withdrawing back up the precipitous slopes. Each side suffered heavy casualties, and on 20 November, Derrick—who had been acting as company sergeant major for the previous month—was given command of B Company&#x27;s 11 platoon after the unit had &quot;lost all but one of their leaders&quot;. By 22 November, the 2/23rd and 2/48th Battalions had reached the southern slopes of Sattelberg, holding a position approximately from the summit. A landslide had blocked the only road, so the final assault was made by infantry alone, without supporting tanks.

On 24 November, the 2/48th Battalion&#x27;s B Company was ordered to outflank a strong Japanese position sited on a cliff face, before attacking a feature from the Sattelberg township. The nature of the terrain meant that the only possible route was up a slope covered with kunai grass directly beneath the cliffs. Over a period of two hours, the Australians made several attempts to clamber up the slopes to reach their objective, but each time they were repulsed by intense machine gun fire and grenade attacks. As dusk fell, it appeared impossible to reach the objective or even hold the ground already gained, and the company was ordered to withdraw. In response, Derrick replied to his company commander: &quot;Bugger the CO [commanding officer]. Just give me twenty more minutes and we&#x27;ll have this place. Tell him I&#x27;m pinned down and can&#x27;t get out.&quot;

Moving forward with his platoon, Derrick attacked a Japanese post that had been holding up the advance. He destroyed the position with grenades and ordered his second section around to the right flank. The section soon came under heavy machine gun and grenade fire from six Japanese posts. Clambering up the cliff face under heavy fire, Derrick held on with one hand while lobbing grenades into the weapon pits with the other, like &quot;a man ...  shooting for [a] goal at basketball&quot;. Climbing further up the cliff and in full view of the Japanese, Derrick continued to attack the posts with grenades before following up with accurate rifle fire. Within twenty minutes, he had reached the peak and cleared seven posts, while the demoralised Japanese defenders fled from their positions to the buildings of Sattelberg.

Derrick then returned to his platoon, where he gathered his first and third sections in preparation for an assault on the three remaining machine gun posts in the area. Attacking the posts, Derrick personally rushed forward on four separate occasions and threw his grenades at a range of about , before all three were silenced. Derrick&#x27;s platoon held their position that night, before the 2/48th Battalion moved in to take Sattelberg unopposed the following morning. The battalion commander insisted that Derrick personally hoist the Australian flag over the town; it was raised at 10:00 on 25 November 1943.

The final assault on Sattelberg became known within the 2/48th Battalion as &#x27;Derrick&#x27;s Show&#x27;. Although he was already a celebrity within the 9th Division, the action brought him to wide public attention. On 23 March 1944, the announcement and accompanying citation for Derrick&#x27;s Victoria Cross appeared in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot;. It read:

====Later war service====
The 2/48th Battalion remained at Sattelberg until late December 1943, when it returned to the coast to regroup. On Christmas Eve, Derrick noted in his diary that the next day would be his &quot;4th Xmas overseas&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t care where I spend the next one I only hope I&#x27;m still on deck [alive]&quot;. On 7 February 1944, the battalion sailed from Finschhafen for Australia, disembarking at Brisbane. Granted home leave, Derrick made his way to South Australia for a short period with Beryl. In April, he was admitted to hospital suffering from malaria before returning to his battalion the following month. During this time, he was charged with being absent without leave and subsequently forfeited a day&#x27;s pay.

On 20 August 1944, Derrick was posted to an officer cadet training unit in Victoria. He requested that he be allowed to rejoin the 2/48th Battalion at the end of the course; contrary to normal Army policy that prevented officers commissioned from the ranks from returning to their previous units. An exemption was granted to Derrick only after much lobbying. While at this unit, Derrick shared a tent with Reg Saunders, who later became the Army&#x27;s first Indigenous Australian officer.

Commissioned as a lieutenant on 26 November 1944, Derrick was granted twenty-four days leave. Returning to the 2/48th Battalion as a reinforcement officer, his appointment as a platoon commander in his old company was met by &quot;great jubilation&quot;. During this period, the battalion had been posted to Ravenshoe on the Atherton Tablelands for &quot;an extensive training period&quot;, before being transported from Cairns to Morotai during April 1945. It was around this time that Derrick converted from his Church of England religious denomination and Salvationist beliefs to Catholicism—his wife&#x27;s religion—though he was not overtly religious.

On 1 May 1945, Derrick took part in the landing at Tarakan; an island off the coast of Borneo. Under the cover of a naval and aerial bombardment, he led his men ashore in the initial waves of the landing, where they were initially posted at the boundary of the 2/48th Battalion and 2/24th Battalion&#x27;s area of responsibility. The Japanese force on the island mounted a determined resistance, and Derrick was later quoted in the &quot;Sunday Sun&quot; as saying he had &quot;never struck anything so tough as the Japanese on Tarakan&quot;.

Slowly pushing inland, the 2/48th Battalion&#x27;s main task from 19 May was to capture a heavily defended hill code-named &quot;Freda&quot;. Derrick&#x27;s platoon unsuccessfully probed Japanese positions on that day and the next, at a loss of two men killed with others wounded. He later recorded in his diary that these setbacks were a &quot;bad show&quot;. On 21 May, Derrick and Lieutenant Colonel Bob Ainslie, the 2/48th Battalion&#x27;s commander, debated the optimum size of the unit which should be used to capture the &quot;Freda&quot; position. Derrick successfully argued that a company was best, given the restrictions posed by the terrain. He was in high spirits that night, possibly in an attempt to lift his platoon&#x27;s morale. On 22 May, Derrick&#x27;s was one of two platoons that attacked a well-defended knoll and captured the position. Derrick played a key role in this action, and coordinated both platoons during the final assault that afternoon.

After capturing the knoll, the two platoons—reinforced by two sections of the 2/4th Commando Squadron—dug in to await an expected Japanese counter-attack. At about 03:30 on 23 May, a Japanese light machine gun fired into the Australian position. Derrick sat upright to see if his men were all right, and was hit by five bullets from the gun&#x27;s second burst; striking him from his left hip to the right of his chest. His runner, &quot;Curly&quot; Colby, dragged him behind cover, but Derrick could not be immediately evacuated as Japanese troops attacked at about 04:00. Derrick was in great pain, and told Colby that he had &quot;had it&quot;. Despite his wounds, he continued to issue orders for several hours. When day broke, it was discovered that Derrick&#x27;s platoon were directly overlooked by a Japanese bunker—though this would not have been visible during the assault late the previous evening.

When stretcher bearers reached the position at dawn, Derrick insisted that the other wounded be attended to first. Derrick was carried off &quot;Freda&quot; later that morning, where he was met by the 26th Brigade&#x27;s commander, Brigadier David Whitehead. The two men briefly conversed before Derrick excused himself, fearing that he had not much time left and wishing to see the padre. Stepping back, Whitehead saluted and sent for Father Arch Bryson. At the hospital, surgeons found that bullets had torn away much of Derrick&#x27;s liver; he died on 24 May 1945 during a second operation on his wounds. He was buried in the 2/48th Battalion&#x27;s cemetery on Tarakan that afternoon, and later re-interred at the Labuan War Cemetery, plot 24, row A, grave 9.

==Legacy==
Tom Derrick was widely mourned. His widow, Beryl, became prostrate with grief on hearing of his death; many members of the Army were affected, with one soldier lamenting it felt as if &quot;the whole war stopped&quot;. By the time Derrick&#x27;s death was officially announced on 30 May, most Australians on Tarakan had heard the news and rumours had spread claiming that he had been speared or shot at short range by a sub-machine gun.
The Japanese force on Tarakan learned of Derrick&#x27;s death and tried to exploit it for propaganda purposes. They printed a leaflet which began &quot;We lament over the death of Lieutenant General Terick CinC of Allied Force in Tarakan&quot; and later included the question &quot;what do you think of the death in action of your Commander in Chief ...?&quot; This leaflet reached few Australian soldiers, and had little impact on them. &quot;Tokyo Rose&quot; also broadcast taunts over &quot;Terick&#x27;s&quot; death.

Derrick&#x27;s reputation continued to grow after his death, and many Australian soldiers recalled any association, however slight, they had with him. To many Australians, he embodied the &#x27;ANZAC spirit&#x27;, and he remains perhaps the best-known Australian soldier of the Second World War. Historian Michael McKernan later remarked that, for his war service, Derrick had arguably deserved &quot;a VC and two bars ... at El Alamein, at Sattelberg and now at Tarakan&quot;. In a 2004 television interview, then Chief of the Australian Defence Force, General Peter Cosgrove, was asked &quot;Who was the best soldier of all time?&quot; After a short pause, he replied: &quot;Diver Derrick&quot;. This sentiment was endorsed by General Sir Francis Hassett. Hassett—who, as a lieutenant colonel, had served at Finschhafen with II Corps headquarters—stated:


Derrick is also remembered for his personal qualities. He was sensitive and reflective. Despite a limited education, he was a &quot;forceful and logical debater, with a thirst for knowledge&quot;. Derrick kept a diary, composed poetry, collected butterflies and frequently wrote to his wife, while on active service . Historian Peter Stanley has compared Derrick&#x27;s leadership abilities with those of Edward &#x27;Weary&#x27; Dunlop, Ralph Honner and Roden Cutler.

On 7 May 1947, Beryl Derrick attended an investiture ceremony at the Government House, Adelaide, where she was presented with her late husband&#x27;s Victoria Cross and Distinguished Conduct Medal by the Governor of South Australia, Lieutenant General Sir Charles Norrie. Derrick&#x27;s Victoria Cross and other medals are now displayed at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, along with a portrait by Sir Ivor Hele. A street in the neighbouring suburb of Campbell and a rest stop in the Remembrance Driveway between Sydney and Canberra were also named in his honour. In 1995, a public park was named the Derrick Memorial Reserve on Carlisle St, Glanville in his honour, and his VC citation is displayed on a plaque there. In June 2008, a newly built bridge over the Port River on the Port River Expressway was named the Tom &#x27;Diver&#x27; Derrick Bridge following a public campaign.

<text>The Star of Life is a symbol used to identify emergency medical services. It features a blue six-pointed star, outlined by a white border. The middle contains a Rod of Asclepius – an ancient symbol of medicine. The Star of Life can be found on ambulances, medical personnel uniforms, and other objects associated with emergency medicine or first aid. Elevators marked with the symbol indicate the lift is large enough to hold a stretcher. Medical bracelets sometimes use the symbol to indicate one has a medical condition that emergency services should be aware of.

The Star of Life is widely used around the world, but like many international symbols, it has not been adopted everywhere. Its use is restricted to authorized personnel in some countries.

== History ==

The Star of Life originated in the United States. In 1963, the American Medical Association (AMA) designed the Star of Life as a &quot;universal&quot; symbol for medical identification. The AMA did not trademark or copyright the symbol, stating it was being &quot;freely offered&quot; to manufacturers, and also was for use on cards carried by persons with a medical condition.

By way of a 1964 resolution, it was adopted by the World Medical Association &quot;as the universal emergency medical information symbol.&quot; The Star of Life was promoted by the American Red Cross and rapidly adopted worldwide.

In 1970, when the American Medical Association&#x27;s Committee on Emergency Medical Services formed the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (NREMT), the AMA chose the Star of Life to designate nationally certified Emergency Medical Services personnel. In 1973, the NREMT filed for a trademark for the Star of Life logo, under the category of a collective membership mark. This version featured a Star of Life enveloped by a circle. NREMT&#x27;s trademark was granted in 1975, but &quot;was not renewed and therefore has expired.&quot; NREMT subsequently registered a service mark featuring a Star of Life and the words &quot;NATIONAL REGISTRY.&quot; This logo&#x27;s trademark remains active.

Prior to the use of the Star of Life, ambulances in the United States commonly displayed a safety orange-colored cross on a square background. This was only a slight variation from the inverted Swiss flag (✚) used by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. In 1973, the American Red Cross complained that the traditional orange cross too closely resembled their logo of a red cross on a white background, the usage of which is restricted by the Geneva Conventions. Dr. Dawson Mills, Chief of the EMS Branch, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the United States, asked the National Registry of EMTs for permission to use the star as the &quot;national identifier for Emergency Medical Services&quot; in the United States,&quot; and in 1977 reported to Congress that it had become the national standard.

Leo R. Schwartz, Chief of the EMS Branch, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the United States, modified the Star of Life by adding the six main tasks of Emergency Medical Services and changing the color from red (used by the AMA) to blue. The &quot;blue Star of Life&quot; was recommended for adoption by the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare on October 25, 1973, and was registered as a certification mark on February 1, 1977 in the name of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Both NREMT&#x27;s version and the US government&#x27;s modification omit the white outline around the edge common on many of today&#x27;s ambulances.

The US government&#x27;s registration lists uses of the Star of Life, including &quot;emergency medical care&quot; and &quot;emergency medical care vehicles.&quot; The US government&#x27;s registration does not list any international classes of trademark.

Federal standards dictate requirements ambulances in the US must satisfy in order to display the Star of Life. The federal government has given states additional authority to manage the symbol. Private ambulance operators like AMR have trademarked logos featuring an embedded Star of Life.

== Symbolism ==

The six branches of the star represent the six main tasks executed by rescuers all through the emergency chain:

# Detection: The first rescuers on the scene, usually untrained civilians or those involved in the incident, observe the scene, understand the problem, identify the dangers to themselves and the others, and take appropriate measures to ensure their safety on the scene (environmental, electricity, chemicals, radiation, etc.).
# Reporting: The call for professional help is made and dispatch is connected with the victims, providing emergency medical dispatch.
# Response: The first rescuers provide first aid and immediate care to the extent of their capabilities.
# On scene care: The EMS personnel arrive and provide immediate care to the extent of their capabilities on-scene.
# Care in transit: The EMS personnel proceed to transfer the patient to a hospital via an ambulance or helicopter for specialized care. They provide medical care during the transportation.
# Transfer to definitive care: Appropriate specialized care is provided at the hospital.

== Global usage ==

=== Asia ===
Ambulances in Taiwan, mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau display the Star of Life. The symbol is also widely used in Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. It is less common in South Korea, where ambulances display a green cross and green lights.

====West Asia ====

Most ambulances in Turkey do not use the Star of Life. Ambulances in Iran commonly display the Star of Life. Egyptian Ministry of Health ambulances display the Star of Life on one rear door, and a red crescent on the other. National Ambulances in the United Arab Emirates does not display the Star of Life, instead showing an EKG graphic on the sides and rear. In Saudi Arabia, the Red Crescent Society answers the emergency line, and provides service in vehicles bearing the crescent emblem.

In Israel, Magen David Adom displays a red Jewish star, sometimes shown with a Star of Life. The Jewish star is paired with the red crystal in times of conflict. Israel&#x27;s other ambulance operator, United Hatzalah, has a logo based on both stars. &quot;The Star of Life is a universal symbol of emergency medical care. The Star of David is our national symbol. Combining these two elements reminds us of the messages that we...focus on.&quot; said United Hatzalah&#x27;s president.

In Palestine, the Palestine Red Crescent Society provides ambulance service in vehicles displaying a red crescent, alongside private operators who often display the Star of Life.

====India====
Indian Automotive Industry Standard AIS-125 is the National Ambulance Code of India. This document is managed jointly by the Automotive Research Association and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. It requires ambulances display several distinctive markings including a reflective Battenburg pattern, the word &quot;AMBULANCE&quot;, and the emergency telephone number. The standard states &quot;Displayed on the upper half of the left side should be a &#x27;Star of Life&#x27; symbol, with a size of 40cm x 40cm... Displayed on the left back window should be a &#x27;Star of Life&#x27; symbol, with a size of 85% of the window&quot;.

=== Central and South America ===
The Star of Life is used in many Spanish speaking nations, where it is known as . In Argentina, the (SAME), the capital district ambulance service, uses a green and slightly rounded version of the Star of Life in their logo. In Brazil, the Star of Life is known by its Portuguese name &quot;Estrela da Vida&quot;. A red Star of Life is incorporated into the national emergency service&#x27;s visual identity standards. Brazil&#x27;s ABNT Standard NBR 14561 for ambulance design makes direct reference to being based on the American Star of Life vehicle. Ambulances which do not comply with the Brazilian standard are prohibited from displaying the Star of Life or the word “RESGATE” (rescue).

=== Australia and New Zealand ===

A few patient transport providers like Ambulance Service Australia use the Star of Life. However, it is far more common to see the Maltese Cross in this region.

===Europe===
The European Union&#x27;s ambulance design standard CEN 1789 in section A1 &quot;Recognition and Visibility of Ambulances&quot; states:With the exception of Red Cross societies or where the &quot;Star of life&quot; is locally registered, a blue reflective &quot;Star of life&quot; emblem (minimum size 500 mm) together with reflective letters, numerals or a symbol identifying the organization and the vehicle, should be applied to the roof of the ambulance...a blue reflective &quot;Star of life&quot; emblem should [also] be applied to the sides and rear of the ambulance.

In Portugal, the Star of Life is referred to by the Portuguese name . In March 1977, the then National Ambulance Service of Portugal (the present INEM, National Medical Emergency Institute) filed a trademark registration on the symbol, which was granted in 1981. The INEM continues to hold a trademark registration in the country, which is used to certify that vehicles are &quot;in accordance with INEM standards&quot; and personnel have &quot;proper preparation&quot;. It may also be used on maps and road signs &quot;to indicate the location or access to qualified emergency medical care services&quot;.

Belgian EMTs use blue stars; nurses, doctors, and ambulance drivers wear other colors. In the Netherlands, the Star of Life is widely used. The Dutch government owns a trademark on the symbol, alongside the paint scheme used on emergency vehicles.

After Latvia became independent in 1918, ambulance services in the 1920s and 1930s were provided by the Latvian Red Cross and thus displayed the Red Cross symbol. During the Soviet control of Latvia, that symbol continued to be used as a general symbol of medicine. As restoration of independence, the Riga Emergency Medical Service Station called on the government to adopt the Star of Life (, sometimes &quot;sniegpārsla&quot; - &#x27;snowflake&#x27;) and the change was made with effect from 12 January 1995. It is currently used on vehicles, uniforms and medical service buildings. 

In Germany, the symbol was registered in 1993 by industry association BKS, an umbrella organization for private rescue services there. In December 2020, another ambulance industry association, DBRD, filed a challenge with the German Patent and Trade Mark Office. The challengers hired a law firm specializing in intellectual property rights to research the symbol&#x27;s history. This led to allegations the Star of Life had already been in widespread public use since the 1960s, before being registered in Germany (or the US for that matter). The challengers claimed the trademark office seemed to have been not properly informed of these facts, which presumably could have led the original application to have been denied on public domain grounds. The European Union Intellectual Property Office&#x27;s 2014 rejection of a trademark on a minimally modified Star of Life was also cited. , BKS continues to hold German copyright on the symbol.
In the United Kingdom, some NHS ambulances in the UK display the Star of Life in addition to the local Ambulance Service emblem. These (latter) emblems have a pale gold six-spoked wheel with a Rod of Asclepius in the foreground. A crown and Maltese Cross, a common EMS emblem in Commonwealth nations, are included in the design.

==Unicode==

The snake-and-staff element of the symbol has a Unicode code point called the Staff of Aesculapius. Unicode has no dedicated code point for the Star of Life.

<text>Colonel Conwyn Mansel-Jones (14 June 1871 – 29 May 1942) was an English British Army officer. He was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early career==
Born in Beddington, Surrey, and educated at Haileybury College and the Royal Military College Sandhurst, Mansel-Jones was commissioned a second lieutenant in The West Yorkshire Regiment (The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own) on 8 October 1890. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 July 1892, and served with his regiment in the Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War of 1895–96 and in British Central Africa in 1898, where he was promoted to captain supernumerary to his regiment on 20 March 1899. He was recalled to the West Yorkshire Regiment at the outset of the Second Boer War in late 1899, and sent to South Africa.

==Victoria Cross==
Mansel-Jones took part in the Ladysmith relief force, and was confirmed as a captain in his regiment in February 1900. He was wounded on 27 February 1900, during the battle of the Tugela Heights, two days before the actual relief of Ladysmith.

It was during the battle of the Tugela Heights that Mansel-Jones, then 28 years old, undertook the following deed for which he was awarded the VC:
==Later career==
He remained in the army in recruiting until he retired due to his wounds in 1910. He was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, but returned to the colours in 1914, serving in staff positions. He became a temporary lieutenant-colonel in December 1915, and a brevet lieutenant-colonel in June 1917. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in June 1915, received the French Legion of Honour, was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1918 and was six times mentioned in Despatches.

Retiring at the end of the war, he was a member of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen at Arms from 1920 until his death. He died aged 70 on 29 May 1942 in Brockenhurst, and is buried in the churchyard of St Nicholas Church.

His medals are held privately.

<doc id="1218283" wikidata="Q4966438" url="?curid=1218283" title="Bridge of Lions">
<text>The Bridge of Lions is a double-leaf bascule bridge that spans the Intracoastal Waterway in St. Augustine, Florida, United States. A part of State Road A1A, it connects downtown St. Augustine to Anastasia Island across Matanzas Bay. A pair of copies of the marble Medici lions guard the bridge, begun in 1925 and completed in 1927. They were removed in February 2005 and returned in March 2011.

&quot;Roads &amp; Bridges&quot; magazine named the Bridge of Lions as fourth in the nation&#x27;s top 10 bridges for 2010. Projects were evaluated based on size, community impact and challenges resolved.

The United States Department of Transportation declared the bridge &quot;structurally deficient and functionally obsolete&quot; in 1999, prompting heated debates on what to do with the structure. A restoration plan was approved, but opponents continued to voice their opposition. Reynolds, Smith &amp; Hills from nearby Jacksonville was awarded the engineering and design contract, estimated at $77 million, and projected to require five years to complete.

==First Bridge==
Prior to the Bridge of Lions in 1925, there was a wooden bridge, called simply, &quot;The Bridge to Anastasia Island&quot; or &quot;South Beach railroad bridge&quot;. It was built in 1895, and after a major renovation in 1904, the bridge could accommodate a trolley. The span contained no rise, and had a movable opening for ship traffic, and charged a toll for transit.

==Original Bridge of Lions==

The old bridge frequently broke down, leading to calls for its replacement over the years. The man considered the &quot;Father of the Bridge of Lions&quot; was Henry Rodenbaugh, the vice president and bridge expert for Henry Flagler&#x27;s Florida East Coast Railway. In the early 1920s he organized the bond issue to finance the new bridge, selected engineers J. E. Greiner Company to design it—and had his young daughter Jean pour the first bucket of concrete when the work began in 1925. Its construction came at the height of the extravagant Florida land boom of the 1920s, and the bridge is one of its greatest landmarks. It was designed not merely to carry cars, but to be a work of art, and it cost ten times as much as more prosaic bridges constructed nearby at the same time. It was completed after the land boom busted, and the 1927 dedication ceremony had to be paired with the annual Ponce de Leon Celebration in cash-strapped St. Augustine.

The Bridge of Lions is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was included by the National Trust for Historic Preservation (NTHP) on its list of the &quot;11 Most Endangered Historic Sites&quot; in the nation for 1997. The Bridge of Lions was later featured on the cover of the Trust&#x27;s 1999 engagement calendar.

From its earliest days, it was hailed as &quot;The Most Beautiful Bridge in Dixie.&quot; It has long been a symbol of the nation&#x27;s oldest city.

It gets its name from two Carrara marble &quot;Medici lions&quot; statues that are copies of those found in the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence, Italy. The statues were a gift of Dr. Andrew Anderson (1839–1924), the builder of the Markland House, who spent the last decade of his life putting works of art in public places in the Ancient City. The statues were his last gift, and he did not live long enough to see them installed. He had them made by the Romanelli Studios in Florence, Italy, which a decade earlier had provided him with smaller versions which he displayed on the front steps at Markland. The Medici lions are also known for the copies placed in the Throne Room of the Royal Palace of Madrid.

==Temporary bridge==
A temporary bridge was constructed adjacent to the original bridge and traffic was diverted to this structure while the original bridge was being rehabilitated and reconstructed to look like its predecessor. After nearly 80 years of service, an official closing ceremony for the original Bridge of Lions was held on May 26, 2006. Isabella Heard, one of the young girls on the lead float in the opening of the bridge in 1927, was there, in a wheelchair, to tie the ribbon for its closing 79 years later.

Several components of the original bridge were either rehabilitated or returned (as lost components) to the rehabilitated bridge. Primarily, the exterior or fascia steel girders were rehabilitated along with the bascule tower piers. Once the rehabilitation of the original bridge was completed, at a total project cost of $80 million and 4 percent over budget, the temporary bridge was removed and used as part of an artificial reef just offshore. The two lions were in safe storage for the duration of the construction.

==New Bridge of Lions==
Renovation work was completed on March 17, 2010 when it reopened for use. Following the removal of the temporary bridge (to an offshore reef), and landscaping, the restored Lion statues were returned after a 6-year absence, early in the morning of March 15, 2011, principally completing the bridge renovation project.

The current bridge&#x27;s west entrance features manicured gazebos, landscaped palm trees and a new publicly accessible dock extending partially into the bay.
Currently per the Code of Federal Regulations, the bridge opens when requested by a vessel, but only on the hour and half hour between 7:00am and 6:00pm, excluding at 8:00am, 12:00pm, and 5:00pm on Monday through Friday other than federal holidays in the United States.

<doc id="1218284" wikidata="Q2904237" url="?curid=1218284" title="Biopolitics">
<text>Biopolitics is a concept popularized by the French philosopher Michel Foucault in the mid-20th century. At its core, biopolitics explores how governmental power operates through the management and regulation of a population&#x27;s bodies and lives.

This interdisciplinary field scrutinizes the mechanisms through which political authorities and institutions exercise control over populations which goes beyond conventional forms of governance. This encompasses areas such as the regulation of health, reproduction, sexuality, and other aspects of biological existence. The governmental power of biopolitics is exerted through practices such as surveillance, healthcare policies, population control measures, gender-based laws, and the implementation of biometric identification systems.

Foucault&#x27;s thesis claims that contemporary power structures are increasingly preoccupied with the administration of life itself, rather than solely focusing on individual behaviors or actions. Accordingly, biopolitics entails the governance of populations as biological entities, with an emphasis on optimizing their health, productivity, and reproductive capacities in manners conducive to broader political and economic objectives. In its essence, biopolitics investigates how political power intersects with biological life, shaping the bodies, behaviors, and well-being of populations through diverse strategies and controls.

== Background ==
Previous notions of the concept can be traced back to the Middle Ages in John of Salisbury&#x27;s work &quot;Policraticus&quot;, in which the term body politic was coined and used. The term &quot;biopolitics&quot; was first used by Rudolf Kjellén, a political scientist who also coined the term geopolitics, in his 1905 two-volume work &quot;The Great Powers&quot;. Kjellén used the term in the context of his aim to study &quot;the civil war between social groups&quot; (comprising the state) from a biological perspective, and thus named his putative discipline &quot;biopolitics&quot;. In Kjellén&#x27;s organicist view, the state was a quasi-biological organism, a &quot;super-individual creature&quot;. The Nazis also subsequently used the term in the context of their racial policy, with Hans Reiter using it in a 1934 speech to refer to their concept of nation and state based on racial supremacy.

In contemporary US political science studies, usage of the term is mostly divided between a poststructuralist group using the meaning assigned by Foucault (denoting social and political power over life) and another group that uses it to denote studies relating biology and political science. In the work of Foucault, biopolitics refers to the style of government that regulates populations through &quot;biopower&quot; (the application and impact of political power on all aspects of human life).

Morley Roberts, in his 1938 book &quot;Bio-politics&quot; argued that a correct model for world politics is &quot;a loose association of cell and protozoa colonies&quot;. Robert E. Kuttner used the term to refer to his particular brand of &quot;scientific racism&quot;, as he called it, which he worked out with noted antisemite Eustace Mullins, with whom Kuttner co-founded the Institute for Biopolitics in the late 1950s, and also with Glayde Whitney, a behavioral geneticist. Most of his opponents label his model as antisemitic. Kuttner and Mullins were inspired by Morley Roberts, who was in turn inspired by Arthur Keith, or both were inspired by each other and either co-wrote together (or with the Institute of Biopolitics) &quot;Biopolitics of Organic Materialism&quot; dedicated to Roberts and reprinted some of his works.

In the work of Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, biopolitics is framed in terms of anti-capitalist insurrection using life and the body as weapons; examples include flight from power and, &quot;in its most tragic and revolting form&quot;, suicide terrorism, conceptualized as the opposite of biopower, which is seen as the practice of sovereignty in biopolitical conditions.

According to Professor Agni Vlavianos Arvanitis, biopolitics is a conceptual and operative framework for societal development, promoting &quot;bios&quot; (Greek for &quot;life&quot;) as the central theme in every human endeavor, be it policy, education, art, government, science or technology. This concept uses bios as a term referring to all forms of life on our planet, including their genetic and geographic variation.

== Alternative usages ==
One usage concerns the interplay and interdisciplinary studies relating biology and political science, primarily the study of the relationship between biology and political behavior. Most of these works agree on three fundamental aspects. First, the object of investigation is primarily political behavior, which—and this is the underlying assumption—is caused in a substantial way by objectively demonstrable biological factors. For example, the relationship of biology and political orientation, but also biological correlates of partisanship and voting behavior. (See also sociobiology.) Note here Ernst Haeckel&#x27;s famous proposition that &quot;[p]olitics is applied biology.&quot;

Another common usage is per a political spectrum that reflects and or advocates various positions towards regarding the biotech revolution.

A less common one sometimes surfaces in the green politics of bioregionalism.

== In the colonial setting ==
Biopolitics, read as a variation of Foucault&#x27;s Biopower, has proven to be a substantive concept in the field of postcolonial studies. Foucault&#x27;s term refers to the intersection between power (political, economic, judicial etc.) and the individual&#x27;s bodily autonomy. According to postcolonial theorists, present within the colonial setting are various mechanisms of power that consolidate the political authority of the colonizer; Biopolitics is thus the means by which a colonising force utilises political power to regulate and control the bodily autonomy of the colonized subject, who are oppressed and subaltern. Edward Said, in his work Orientalism, analysed the means by which colonial powers rationalised their relationship with the colonized societies they inhabited through discursive means, and how these discourses continue to influence modern-day depictions of the Orient. Franz Fanon applied a psychoanalytic frame to his theories of subjectivity, arguing that the subjectivity of the colonized is in constant dialogue with the oppressive political power of the colonizer, a mirroring of the Oedipal father-son dynamic. While not using the term himself, Fanon&#x27;s work has been cited as a major development in the conceptualisation of biopolitics in the colonial setting. Maya Mikdashi applies this concept in her book &quot;Sextarianism&quot; to the state organisation of the Lebanese State under French mandate-rule in which the classification of sects and the specific categories within citizenship law enforced a desirable vision of family and marital relationships in the perspective of the colonial rulers 

==Michel Foucault==

French philosopher and social theorist Michel Foucault first discussed his thoughts on biopolitics in his lecture series &quot;Society Must Be Defended&quot; given at the Collège de France from 1975 to 1976. Foucault&#x27;s concept of biopolitics is largely derived from his own notion of biopower, and the extension of state power over both the physical and political bodies of a population. While only mentioned briefly in his &quot;Society Must Be Defended&quot; lectures, the conceptualisation of biopolitics developed by Foucault has become prominent in social science and the humanities.

Foucault described biopolitics as &quot;a new technology of power...[that] exists at a different level, on a different scale, and [that] has a different bearing area, and makes use of very different instruments.&quot; More than a disciplinary mechanism, Foucault&#x27;s biopolitics acts as a control apparatus exerted over a population as a whole or, as Foucault stated, &quot;a global mass.&quot; In the years that followed, Foucault continued to develop his notions of the biopolitical in his &quot;The Birth of Biopolitics&quot; and &quot;The Courage of Truth&quot; lectures.

Foucault gave numerous examples of biopolitical control when he first mentioned the concept in 1976. These examples include &quot;ratio of births to deaths, the rate of reproduction, the fertility of a population, and so on.&quot; He contrasted this method of social control with political power in the Middle Ages. Whereas in the Middle Ages pandemics made death a permanent and perpetual part of life, this was then shifted around the end of the 18th century with the introduction of milieu into the biological sciences. Foucault then gives different contrasts to the then physical sciences in which the industrialisation of the population was coming to the fore through the concept of work, where Foucault then argues power starts to become a target for this milieu by the 17th century. The development of vaccines and medicines dealing with public hygiene allowed death to be held (and/or withheld) from certain populations. This was the introduction of &quot;more subtle, more rational mechanisms: insurance, individual and collective savings, safety measures, and so on.&quot;

==Giorgio Agamben==

Italian philosopher and legal theorist Giorgio Agamben&#x27;s theory of biopolitics critiques that of Foucault, citing his predecessor&#x27;s supposition as overly simplistic and lacking legal framework. Agamben&#x27;s biopolitics is based on a distinction between three types of life: natural life, political life, and bare life- tracing the birth of biopolitics back to Ancient Greece, opposing Foucault&#x27;s focus on modernity. Ancient Greek philosophy details a separation of &quot;bios&quot; – meaning physical life, or the life of the body, and &quot;zoe&quot; – a divine, spiritual life that is eternal and immortal. This distinction parallels the ancient Roman law of &quot;homo sacer&quot; – he who could be killed but not sacrificed.

Agamben theorises that sovereign power (the state) needs to perpetually produce bare life (&quot;homo sacer&quot;) in order to reproduce itself- applying biopolitics as a tool to maintain control. Agamben&#x27;s idea of biopolitics ultimately culminates into a theory of &#x27;the state of exception&#x27; where certain groups within society – such as inmates – are precluded from basic human rights (no trial, no political life – they are bare life). This darker side of biopolitics mediates the often violent exclusion of some forms of life from the more general population: rendering them less than human.

<text>Robert Humpston VC (1832 – 22 December 1884) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Humpston was about 23 years old, and a private in the 2nd Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own), British Army during the Crimean War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 22 April 1855 in the Crimea Private Humpston and Private Joseph Bradshaw, on their own, attacked and captured a Russian rifle pit situated among the rocks overhanging the Woronzoff Road. The pit was occupied every night by the Russians and its capture and subsequent destruction was of great importance.

His Victoria Cross is part of the collection of Derby Museum &amp; Art Gallery at Derby in England.

Following his death in 1884 Robert Humpston was buried in a pauper&#x27;s grave. In September 2007, following a two-year campaign to raise £1,200 to get a headstone for Pte Humpston, his grave was dedicated in a ceremony at Nottingham Cemetery.

<doc id="1218290" wikidata="Q8013797" url="?curid=1218290" title="William Joynt">
<text>William Donovan Joynt, VC (19 March 1889 – 6 June 1986) was a printer, publisher, author and an Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest military award for gallantry in the face of the enemy given to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Joynt was born at Elsternwick, Melbourne and educated at The Grange Preparatory School and later Melbourne Church of England Grammar School. After working in a number of office jobs in Melbourne, in 1909 he sailed to Rockhampton and worked as a farm labourer in North Queensland, the Victorian Mallee, Western Australia and Flinders Island.

==First World War==

Joynt enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 21 May 1915, was commissioned on 24 December 1915, and arrived in France in May 1916. He fought in France until August 1918, where he was commended in divisional orders and promoted to lieutenant. He was wounded by a shot to the shoulder.

On 23 August 1918, Joynt was 29 years old, and a lieutenant in the 8th Battalion (Victoria), Australian Imperial Force during the First World War, when the following events occurred.
He was badly wounded by a shell on 26 August and evacuated to England. He was promoted to captain in October 1918, and posted to AIF Headquarters in London in March 1919. He returned to Melbourne in February 1920, and was discharged on 11 June.

==Inter-bellum==
Having studied agriculture and sheep-breeding in England in 1919, in 1920 Joynt became a soldier settler, dairy farming near Berwick. By 1929 he was pursuing business interests in Melbourne, where he was a pioneer of colour printing in Australia. About 1920 he had formed Queen City Printers Pty Ltd, and subsequently formed Colarts Studios Pty Ltd and bought the rights to a German colour-printing process. In the early 1920s he toured an exhibition titled &quot;The Pictorial Panorama of the Great War&quot;. Under various business names, Joynt remained a printer and publisher for over sixty years.

He married Edith Amy Garrett, a trained nurse, in a civil ceremony at Hawthorn on 19 March 1932, his forty-third birthday.

Joynt was one of a number of ex-servicemen who in 1923 founded the Legacy Club of Melbourne, the first of fifty Legacy Clubs. He helped lead the club&#x27;s successful campaign to have Melbourne&#x27;s Shrine of Remembrance built in its present form on its present site. He was active in the Militia in 1926–33, being promoted to major in February 1930.

==Second World War==
Joynt was mobilised on 26 September 1939 and placed in command of Fort Queenscliff and subsequently Puckapunyal. From June 1942 he was camp staff officer then quartermaster at Seymour camp.

Having passed his 55th birthday, he was placed on the Retired List as an honorary lieutenant colonel on 10 October 1944.

==Post war==
Joynt and his wife rented, then bought, Tom Roberts&#x27; old home, Talisman, at Kallista and lived there until they built their own home nearby.

He wrote three books:
* – travel through the Soviet Union
* – a regimental history of the 8th Battalion
* – autobiography

His wife Edith died in 1978. The last surviving of Australia’s World War I VC recipients, he died on 5 May 1986 at Windsor and was buried with full military honours in Brighton Cemetery. He had no children.

<text>A vertical-lift bridge or just lift bridge is a type of movable bridge in which a span rises vertically while remaining parallel with the deck.

The vertical lift offers several benefits over other movable bridges such as the bascule and swing-span bridges. Generally speaking, they cost less to build for longer moveable spans. The counterweights in a vertical lift are only required to be equal to the weight of the deck, whereas bascule bridge counterweights must weigh several times as much as the span being lifted. As a result, heavier materials can be used in the deck, and so this type of bridge is especially suited for heavy railroad use. The biggest disadvantage to the vertical-lift bridge (in comparison with many other designs) is the height restriction for vessels passing under it, due to the deck remaining suspended above the passageway.

Most vertical-lift bridges use towers, each equipped with counterweights. An example of this kind was built in Portland, Oregon, United States in 1912.

Another design uses balance beams to lift the deck, with pivoting bascules located on the top of the lift towers.

<text>Lieutenant General Harry Hammon Lyster VC, CB (24 December 1830 – 1 February 1922) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 27 years old and a lieutenant in the 72nd Bengal Native Infantry, Bengal Army, during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place, for which he was awarded the VC. The citation read:
Other despatches from Hugh Henry Rose describes how on 31 January 1858 at Barodia, when Lyster had been acting as Rose&#x27;s interpreter, Lyster was wounded when fighting a nephew of Mahomed Fazil Khan, receiving a &quot;deep sword cut on [the] inner part of [his] right forearm.&quot; He killed Khan&#x27;s nephew during the fight.

==Further information==
In 1847-48 he served as a special constable in London during the Chartist riots. He took a commission in the British East India Company&#x27;s army on 20 September 1848 and was promoted major on 19 January 1864, brevet lieutenant colonel on 26 March 1870, and brevet colonel on 25 November 1877. He was Mentioned in Despatches while in command of 3rd Goorkha Regiment at the Battle of Ahmed Khel during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, and appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath on 22 February 1881. He was promoted lieutenant general on 1 September 1891, and retired from the army on 1 July 1892.

Harry Hammon Lyster is mentioned disparagingly by Flashman in &quot;Flashman in the Great Game&quot; by George MacDonald Fraser.

His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

==Family==
He married twice: to Caroline Matilda Davis in 1865; and, following her death in 1895, to Ada Emily Cole in 1901. He died in London on 1 February 1922.

He was the son of Anthony Lyster (1797-1880) of Stillorgan Park, County Dublin, and Marcia, the sixth daughter of James Tate of Ballintaggart House, Colbinstown, County Kildare. Marcia Tate&#x27;s mother Maria Stratford was a daughter of John Stratford, 3rd Earl of Aldborough. See also: Lister (surname).

<doc id="1218295" wikidata="Q868306" url="?curid=1218295" title="Samantabhadra (Bodhisattva)">
<text>Samantabhadra (lit. &quot;Universal Worthy&quot;, &quot;All Good&quot;) is a great bodhisattva in Buddhism associated with practice and meditation. Together with Shakyamuni Buddha and the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, he forms the Shakyamuni Triad in Mahayana Buddhism. He is the patron of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot; and, according to the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot;, made the ten great vows which are the basis of a bodhisattva. In Chinese Buddhism, Samantabhadra is known as Pǔxián and is associated with action, whereas Mañjuśrī is associated with &quot;prajñā&quot; (transcendent wisdom). In Japan, this bodhisattva is known as Fugen, and is often venerated in Tendai and Shingon Buddhism.

In the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism, Samantabhadra is also the name of the Adi-Buddha, often portrayed in indivisible union (&quot;yab-yum&quot;) with his consort, Samantabhadrī. In wrathful form he is one of the Eight Herukas of the Nyingma Mahayoga and he is known as Vajramrtra, But this Samantabhadra buddha and Samantabhadra bodhisattva are not the same.

== In Mahayana sutras ==
In the &quot;Lotus Sūtra&quot;, Samantabhadra is described at length in the epilogue, called the &quot;Samantabhadra Meditation Sutra&quot; (), with special detail given to visualization of the bodhisattva, and the virtues of devotion to him.

Samantabhadra is also a key figure in the &quot;Āvataṃsaka-sūtra&quot;, particularly the last chapter, the &quot;Gaṇḍavyūha-sūtra&quot;. In the climax of the &quot;Gaṇḍavyūha-sūtra&quot;, the student Sudhana meets Samantabhadra Bodhisattva who confirms his awakening. Sudhana then merges into Samantabhadra, and Samantabhadra recites a set of popular verses. These verses are known as the &quot;Bhadracaripraṇidhāna&quot; (&quot;Vows of Good Conduct&quot;) or &quot;Ārya-samantabhadra-caryā-praṇidhāna-rāja&quot; (&quot;The Royal Vow to follow the Noble Course of Conduct of Samantabhadra&quot;). This text which concludes the entire &quot;Avatamsaka&quot; was very popular in India, East Asia and in Himalayan Buddhism, and it is cited in numerous sources. It was considered to be a &quot;dhāraṇī&quot; and recited individually as a meritorious text.

=== Ten great vows ===
The core of Samantabhadra&#x27;s aspirations in the &quot;Bhadracaripraṇidhāna&quot; are the ten great vows of Samantabhadra. The ten great vows of Samantabhadra are the following:

# to pay homage to all the buddhas;
# to glorify the qualities of all the tathāgatas;
# to make ample offerings to all the buddhas;
# to confess and repent of all one&#x27;s misdeeds;
# to rejoice in the merits of others;
# always to request the preaching of the dharma;
# to entreat enlightened beings to remain in the world;
# to always to study the teachings of the buddha;
# to always to respond to sentient beings according to their various needs; 
# to dedicate all merits to sentient beings that they may achieve buddhahood.

The ten vows have become a common practice in East Asian Buddhism, particularly the tenth vow, with many Buddhists traditionally dedicating their merit and good works to all beings during Buddhist liturgies.

=== Mantras and dharani ===
Like all important bodhisattvas, several mantras are associated with Samantabhadra. One of these is drawn from a work titled &quot;Arya-Buddhoshnisha-Cintamani-Mahadharani&quot;:om̐ samantabhadra sam svāhāThe &quot;Sarvadurgatiparishodana tantra&quot; contains the following mantra
om̐ samantabhadre hūm̐ &quot;Sam&quot; is Samantabhadra&#x27;s seed syllable. 

The &quot;Dharanisamgraha&quot; meanwhile contains the following dharani for Samantabhadra: om̐ namaḥ samantabhadrāya bodhisattvāya mahāsattvāya || tadyathā || om̐ samantabhadre sarvottama-mahāprāgbhārakalyāṇaṁ samprāpaya hūm̐ phaṭ svāhā ||Meanwhile the &quot;Mahavairocana Sutra&quot; contains the following mantra:namaḥ samantabuddhānāṁ saṁ

== In East Asian Buddhism ==
Unlike his more popular counterpart Mañjuśrī, Samantabhadra is only rarely depicted alone and is usually found in a trinity on the right side of Shakyamuni, mounted on a white elephant. In those traditions that accept the &quot;Avatamsaka Sutra&quot; as their main text (mainly, the Huayan school), Samantabhadra and Manjusri flank Vairocana Buddha, the central Buddha of this particular sutra.

Known as Pǔxián in Chinese, Samantabhadra is sometimes shown in Chinese art with feminine characteristics, riding an elephant with six tusks while carrying a lotus leaf &#x27;parasol&#x27; (Sanskrit: &quot;chatra&quot;), bearing similar dress and features to some feminine depictions of Guanyin. It is in this guise that Samantabhadra is revered as the patron bodhisattva of the monasteries associated with Mount Emei in western China. Some believe that the white elephant mount of Samantabhadra was the same elephant that appeared to Queen Maya, the mother of the Buddha, to herald his birth.

Mahayana esoteric traditions sometimes treat Samantabhadra as one of the &#x27;Primordial&#x27; (Sanskrit: Dharmakaya) Buddhas, but the main primordial Buddha is considered to be Vairocana.

== Tibetan Buddhism ==
In Tibetan Buddhism, Samantabhadra (Tibetan: &quot;Kuntuzangpo&quot;) is a name that refers to two different beings: 

* The Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, one of the eight main bodhisattva attendants of Shakyamuni Buddha, i.e. one of the &quot;eight close sons.&quot;
* The Primordial Buddha (Adi-Buddha) Samantabhadra (known as Vajradhara in the Sarma traditions). Samantabhadra Buddha appears in the &quot;Kunjed Gyalpo&quot; Tantra, as the &quot;All-Creating King&quot;, the &quot;embodiment&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;kaya&quot;) or &quot;field&quot; (&quot;kṣetra&quot;) of &quot;timeless awareness, gnosis&quot; (Sanskrit: &quot;jñāna&quot;). This Buddha is ultimate reality, which according to Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche is &quot;the unity of awareness and emptiness, the unity of appearances and emptiness, the nature of mind, natural clarity with unceasing compassion.&quot; This Buddha appears in various Nyingma sources, like &quot;The Mirror of the Mind of Samantabhadra&quot;, one of the Seventeen Tantras of Dzogchen.

<doc id="1218298" wikidata="Q1429347" url="?curid=1218298" title="Red seal ships">
<text>were Japanese armed merchant sailing ships bound for Southeast Asian ports with red-sealed letters patent issued by the early Tokugawa shogunate in the first half of the 17th century. Between 1600 and 1635, more than 350 Japanese ships went overseas under this permit system.

==Origins==
From the 13th to the 16th century, Japanese ships were quite active in Asian waters, often in the role of &quot;wakō&quot; pirates, that raided the Korean and Chinese coasts. Often paid by various Japanese feudal leaders, they were frequently involved in Japan’s civil wars during the early part of this period. Quasi-official trading missions were also sent to China, such as the Tenryūji-bune around 1341. The wakō attacks became less frequent by the third quarter of the sixteenth century. Wakō activity was efficiently curbed in the late 16th century with the interdiction of piracy by Hideyoshi, and the successful campaigns against pirate activity on the Chinese coast by Ming dynasty generals.

Between the 15th and 16th centuries, the main trading intermediary in East Asia was the island kingdom of the Ryūkyū (modern Okinawa), which exchanged Japanese products (silver, swords) and Chinese products for Southeast Asian sappan wood and deer hides. Altogether 150 Ryukyuan ships are recorded between the kingdom and Southeast Asia, 61 of them for Annam (Vietnam), 10 for Malacca, 10 for Pattani, 8 for Java, etc. Their commerce disappeared around 1570 with the rise of Chinese merchants and the intervention of Portuguese and Spanish ships and corresponds with the beginnings of the red seal system. Japan finally invaded the Ryūkyū Kingdom in 1609.

When the first Europeans started to navigate in the Pacific Ocean (see also Nanban trade period), they regularly encountered Japanese ships, such as when the Spanish welcomed in Manila in 1589 a storm-battered Japanese junk bound for Siam, or when the Dutch circumnavigator Olivier van Noort encountered a 110-ton Japanese junk in the Philippines in December 1600, and on the same voyage a red seal ship with a Portuguese captain off Borneo through which they learned about the arrival of William Adams in Japan.

==Red seal system==


The red seal system appears from at least 1592, under Toyotomi Hideyoshi, date of the first known mention of the system in a document. The first actually preserved shuinjō (red seal permit) is dated to 1604, under Tokugawa Ieyasu, first ruler of Tokugawa Japan. Tokugawa issued red-sealed permits to his favourite feudal lords and principal merchants who were interested in foreign trade. By doing so, he was able to control Japanese traders and reduce Japanese piracy in the South Sea. His seal also guaranteed the protection of the ships, since he vowed to pursue any pirate or nation who would violate it.

Besides Japanese traders, 12 European and 11 Chinese residents, including William Adams and Jan Joosten, are known to have received permits. At one point after 1621, Jan Joosten is recorded to have possessed 10 Red Seal Ships for commerce.

Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, and English ships along with Asian rulers basically protected Japanese red seal ships, since they had diplomatic relations with the Japanese shōgun. Only Ming China had nothing to do with this practice, because the Empire officially prohibited Japanese ships from entering Chinese ports. (But Ming officials were not able to stop Chinese smugglers from setting sail to Japan.)

==Ship design==
Red seal ships usually ranged in size between 500 and 750 tons, a size equal or superior to European galleons, but inferior to that of the massive Portuguese carracks or to Manila galleons, which were often in the vicinity of 1,000 and 2,000 tons, respectively.

The complement is speculated to have been about 200 people per ship; the average of the fifteen Red Seal ships for which the number of people is known is 236.

Red seal ships varied in style and place of construction. Some, especially those built in Nagasaki, employed Chinese and European techniques to Japanese ship designs. Others were captured Chinese junks. Later, when the Southeast Asian trade was well-established, numerous ships were ordered and purchased in Ayutthaya in Siam, on account of high-quality construction and materials.

The ships were managed by rich trading families such as the Suminokura, Araki, Chaya and Sueyoshi, or by individual adventurers such as Suetsugu Heizō, Yamada Nagamasa, William Adams, Jan Joosten or Murayama Tōan. The funds for the purchase of merchandise in Asia were loaned to the managers of the expedition for an interest of 35% to 55% per trip, going as high as 100% in the case of Siam.

==Import and export==
Japanese merchants mainly exported silver, diamonds, copper, swords, and other artifacts, and imported Chinese silk as well as some Southeast Asian products (like sugar and deer skins). Pepper and spices were rarely imported into Japan, where people did not eat a great deal of meat due to the local preponderance of adherents to the Buddhist belief system. Southeast Asian ports provided meeting places for Japanese and Chinese ships.

==Destinations==
The crew of the red seal ships were international, for many Chinese, Portuguese, and Dutch pilots and interpreters joined the sails. The first red seal ships were required to have a Portuguese pilot on board, although the Japanese progressively developed pilots of their own. The Portolan maps used on the red seal ships were drawn on the Portuguese model, with directions in the Japanese language.

Major Southeast Asian ports, including Filipino Manila, Vietnamese Hội An, Siamese Ayutthaya, Malay Pattani, welcomed the Japanese merchant ships, and many Japanese settled in these ports, forming small Japanese enclaves.

The Japanese seem to have been feared throughout Asian countries, according to a contemporary, Sir Edward Michelbourne: 
The Japons are not suffered to land in any port in India (Asia) with weapons; being accounted a people so desperate and daring, that they are feared in all places where they come.

A Dutch commander wrote (c. 1615): &quot;they are a rough and a fearless people, lambs in their own country, but well-nigh devils outside of it&quot;.

===Philippines===
Around 50 red seal ships to Luzon in the Philippines are recorded between 1604 and 1624 (and only 4 more recorded by 1635). The Japanese had established quite early an enclave at Dilao, a suburb of Manila, where they numbered between 300 and 400 in 1593. In 1603, during the Sangley rebellion, they numbered 1,500 and 3,000 in 1606. The Franciscan friar Luis Sotelo was involved in the support of the Dilao enclave between 1600 and 1608.

The Japanese led an abortive rebellion in Dilao against the Spanish in 1606–1607. Their numbers rose again with the interdiction of Christianity by Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1614, when 300 Japanese Christian refugees under Dom Justo Takayama settled in the Philippines. In the 16th and 17th centuries, thousands of Japanese traders also migrated to the Philippines and assimilated into the local population. They are at the origin of today&#x27;s 200,000-strong Japanese population in the Philippines.

===Siam (Thailand)===
The Siamese &quot;Chronicles of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya&quot; record that already in 1592, 500 Japanese troops under the King of Siam helped defeat an invading Burmese army.

Around 56 red seal ships to Siam are recorded between 1604 and 1635. The Japanese community in Siam seems to have been in the hundreds, as described by the Portuguese Catholic priest, António Francisco Cardim, who recounted having administered sacrament to around 400 Japanese Christians in 1627 in the Thai capital of Ayuthaya (&quot;a 400 japões christãos&quot;) (Ishii Yoneo, Multicultural Japan).

In December 1605, John Davis, the famous English explorer, was killed by Japanese pirates off the coast of Siam, thus becoming the first Englishman to be killed by a Japanese.

The colony was active in trade, particularly in the export of deer-hide and sappan wood to Japan in exchange for Japanese silver and Japanese handicrafts (Japanese swords, Japanese lacquerware, high-quality papers). They were noted by the Dutch for challenging the trade monopoly of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), as their strong position with the King of Siam typically allowed them to buy at least 50% of the total production, leaving small quantities of a lesser quality to other traders.

A Japanese adventurer, Yamada Nagamasa, became very influential and ruled part of the Kingdom of Siam (Thailand) during that period. The colony also had an important military role in Thailand.

===Macau===
Although prohibited by China from touching Chinese soil, Japanese sailors from red seal ships transited through the Portuguese port of Macau on the Chinese coast in some numbers. On 30 November 1608, a fight with about 100 Japanese samurai, wielding katana and muskets, confronting Portuguese soldiers under the acting governor and Captain of the Japan voyage André Pessoa led to a fight in which 50 Japanese lost their lives. The remaining 50 were released by the authorities after having to sign an affidavit blaming themselves for the incident. Ieyasu prohibited visits to Macau by Japanese nationals in 1609: 
: Since it is an undoubted fact that the going of Japanese in ships to Macau is prejudicial to that place, this practice will be strictly prohibited for the future. (25 July 1609, Ieyasu Shuinjo, remitted to Mateus Leitão)

===Indonesia===
Although few red seal ships are recorded for the areas of modern Indonesia (Java, Spice Islands), possibly because of the remoteness and because of the direct Dutch involvement there, Japanese samurai were recruited by the Dutch in the area. They distinguished themselves in the capture of the Banda Islands from the English and the defense of Batavia, until the practice of hiring Japanese mercenaries was prohibited by the Shōgun in 1621. In 1618, Jan Pieterszoon Coen, the Dutch governor of Java, requested 25 Japanese Samurai to be sent to him from Japan. In 1620, the Dutch record that 90 Japanese samurai were recruited from the islands surrounding Java, in order to reinforce the fort of Batavia.

In 1623, during the Amboyna massacre, 9 Japanese mercenaries were recorded to have been with the 10 English traders of the English East India Company factory. They were tortured and killed by Dutch forces from the neighbouring factory. (See Chapter 11 &quot;Trial by Fire and Water&quot; in Nathaniel&#x27;s Nutmeg.) This event was partly the cause for the advent of the Anglo-Dutch Wars.

===India===
The Japanese adventurer Tenjiku Tokubei is related to have traveled to Siam as well as India on board a Red Seal ship of Jan Joosten. Upon his return to Japan, Tokubei wrote an essay titled &quot;Tenjiku Tōkai Monogatari&quot; (&quot;Relations of travels to India&quot;) on his adventures in foreign countries, which became very popular in Japan. He is sometimes referred to as the Marco Polo of Japan.

===Other destinations===
Other major destinations included Cochinchina (74 ships), Cambodia (44 ships), Taiwan (35 ships), and Annam in Vietnam (14 ships).

==Relative importance==
The 350 red seal ships recorded between 1604 and 1634, averaging about 10 ships per year, could be compared to the single Portuguese carrack visiting Nagasaki from Macau every year, which was larger in tonnage (between 2 and 3 times a single red seal ship), and carried a rich cargo of silk directly obtained from China.

Also in comparison, the English factory in Hirado only received four ships from England in the space of 10 years (during its existence between 1613 and 1623), with generally non-valuable cargo. To survive, the factory actually had to resort to trade between Japan and Southeast Asia under the Red seal system, organizing seven expeditions, four of which were handled by William Adams.

The Japanese Shōgun was very defiant of Spain, and Spain very reluctant to divert shipping resources between distant territories, so that besides the few shipwrecks of the Manila galleon on the Japanese coast, only about one Spanish ship was dispatched to Japan every year for trade. They had a small base in Uraga, where William Adams was put in charge of selling the cargo on several occasions.

Only Chinese shipping seems to have been quite important during the last years of the Ming dynasty. Richard Cocks, head of the English factory in Hirado, reported that 60 to 70 Chinese junks visited Nagasaki in 1614, sailed by Fukienese smugglers.

In 1612, overall, Portuguese priest Valentim de Carvalho, head of the Jesuit mission, stated that the annual &quot;Great Ship&quot; from Macau brought 1,300 quintals of silk, whereas 5,000 quintals were brought in red seal ships and ships from China and Manila.

==End of the system==
In 1633–1639, Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu enacted the &quot;sakoku&quot; policy, which officially prohibited overseas travel by Japanese. This ended red seal trade voyages. The Dutch East India Company become the sole officially sanctioned party for European trade with Japan.

<text>Ākāśagarbha (, Standard Tibetan: &quot;Namkha&#x27;i Nyingpo&quot;) is a bodhisattva in Chinese, Japanese and Korean Buddhism who is associated with the great element (&quot;mahābhūta&quot;) of space (&quot;ākāśa&quot;).

==Overview==
Ākāśagarbha is regarded as one of the eight great bodhisattvas. His name can be translated as &quot;boundless space treasury&quot; or &quot;void store&quot; as his wisdom is said to be boundless as space itself. He is sometimes known as the twin brother of the &quot;earth store&quot; bodhisattva Kṣitigarbha, and is even briefly mentioned in the &quot;Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva Pūrvapraṇidhāna Sūtra&quot;.

Associated with the qualities of Gautama Buddha, he is able to purify transgressions.

Kūkai, the founder of Shingon Buddhism, met a famous monk who is said to have repeatedly chanted a mantra of Ākāśagarbha as a young Buddhist acolyte. Kūkai took a tutorial with him on Kokuzou-Gumonji (a secret doctrine method, 虚空蔵求聞持法). As he chanted the mantra, he experienced a vision whereby Ākāśagarbha told him to go to Tang China to seek understanding of the &quot;Mahāvairocana Abhisaṃbodhi Sūtra&quot;. Later he would go to China to learn Tangmi from Huiguo, and then go on to found the Shingon sect of esoteric Buddhism in Heian Japan.

==Sutras==
There are several Mahāyāna sūtras in which Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva is a central figure:
*《虛空藏菩薩經》 (&quot;Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva Sūtra&quot; T.405)
*《佛説虚空藏菩薩神呪經》(&quot;Buddha Speaks the Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva Dhāraṇī Sūtra&quot; T.406)
*《虛空藏菩薩神呪經》(&quot;Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva Dhāraṇī Sūtra&quot; T.0407)
*《虛空孕菩薩經》 (&quot;Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva Sūtra&quot; T.0408)
*《觀虚空藏菩薩經 》(&quot;The Meditation on Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva Sūtra&quot; T.0409)
*《虚空藏菩薩能滿諸願最勝心陀羅尼求聞持法》(&quot;The Method of the Victorious, Essential Dharāṇi for Having Wishes Heard by the Bodhisattva Space-Store Who Can Fulfill Requests&quot; T.1145)
*《大虚空藏菩薩念誦法》 (&quot;The Method of Invoking the Great Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva &quot; T.1146)
*《聖虛空藏菩薩陀羅尼經》 (&quot;Dhāraṇī of the Space-Store Bodhisattva&quot; T.1147)
*《佛説虚空藏陀羅尼》 (&quot;Buddha Speaks the Ākāśagarbha Dharāṇi&quot;　T.1148)
*《五大虚空藏菩薩速疾大神驗祕密式經》(&quot;The Five Great Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattvas Sūtra&quot; T.1149)
*《虛空藏菩薩問七佛陀羅尼呪經》(&quot;Ārya Saptabuddhaka Sūtra&quot; or &quot;Dhāraṇī of the Space-Store Bodhisattvaʼs Questions to Seven Buddhas&quot; T.1333)
*《如來方便善巧呪經》 (&quot;Incantation of the Tathāgatas&#x27; Skillful Means&quot; T.1334)

Additionally, he appears briefly in the final chapter of the &quot;Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva Pūrvapraṇidhāna Sūtra&quot;, requesting the Buddha preach on the benefits of praising both the Sūtra and Kṣitigarbha.

==Five Great Ākāśagarbhas==
The Five Great Ākāśagarbhas are manifestation of the Five Wisdom Buddhas. They are said to bring about an increase of benefits such as good health. Within the traditional mandala, they are arranged as follows:
==Mantras==
The mantra of Ākāśagarbha is believed to give rise to wisdom and creativity, and dispel ignorance.
*Traditional Chinese: 南無 虚空藏 菩薩 
*Chinese (Pinyin): 
*Japanese (Rōmaji): 
*Korean: 
*Vietnamese: 
*Translation: Homage to Ākāśagarbha Bodhisattva
The &quot;morning star mantra&quot; is a common mantra practiced in Shingon Buddhism. It is most often used as part of the Gumonjihō rite that is said to improve one&#x27;s memory of the teachings and is derived from a sutra called &quot;Kokūzō Bosatsu nō man shogan saishō shin darani gumonji hō&quot; 虛空藏菩薩能滿諸願最勝心陀羅尼求聞持法 (Taishō Canon #1145). This mantra is:

*Sanskrit: 
*Traditional Chinese: 南無，阿迦捨，揭婆耶，唵，阿唎，迦麼唎，慕唎，莎嚩訶
*Chinese (Pinyin): 
*Japanese (Rōmaji): 
*Translation: Homage to Ākāśagarbha, Om - Crown of the Noble Enemy of Kāma - svāhā

<doc id="1218303" wikidata="Q711949" url="?curid=1218303" title="Liaoning bronze dagger culture">
<text>The Liaoning bronze dagger culture or Lute-shaped bronze dagger culture is the provisional designation of an archeological complex of the Bronze Age in Northeast China and the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. Its classification is controversial. While some believe it to be sufficiently distinct to be labelled as a separate culture, others associate the findings with the Upper Xiajiadian culture.

Artifacts from the culture are found primarily in the Liaoning area of northeast China and in the Korean peninsula. Various other bronze artifacts, including ornaments and weapons, are associated with the culture, but the daggers are viewed as the most characteristic. Liaoning bronzes contain a higher percentage of zinc than those of the neighboring bronze cultures.

Lee Chung-kyu (1996) considers that the culture is properly divided into five phases: Phases I and II typified by lute-shaped daggers, Phases IV and V by slender daggers, and Phase III by the transition between the two. Of these, remains from Phases I, II and III can be found in some amounts in both the Korean peninsula and northeast China, but remains from Phases IV and V are found almost exclusively in Korea.

==Lute-shaped daggers==

The early phase consists of an early period of bronze manufacture without daggers originated from the spreading processes of Siberian Seima-Turbino Type bronzeware throughout Eurasia continent, followed by a period of producing what is now called lute- or violin-shaped daggers by Korean scholars (Bipahyungdonggeom, 비파형동검). The earliest period of production of lute-shaped daggers is dated to the 14th century BCE.

The earliest artifacts from this period are found exclusively in Liaoning of northeast China and seem only gradually to have spread to the Korean peninsula. By Lee&#x27;s (1996) Phase II, however, a distinctive notched form of dagger begins to emerge in southern Korea, suggesting that by this time independent bronze production had begun in that region.

Some argue it to be a regional variation of a much larger distribution of similar daggers that range from Hebei and Inner Mongolia in the west to the Korean peninsula in the east. Many scholars consider it to be a style shared by a number of groups, rather than representing a single culture.

Evidence gained from pottery indicates that the bronze dagger &quot;culture&quot; of this time actually included several distinct cultural groups. One distinct pottery tradition is found in northeast China and northwestern Korea, another in the Taedong River valley, another in the southwest around the Chungcheong provinces including the Geum River, and yet another throughout the rest of the southern Korean peninsula including Jeju island.

==Slender daggers==

This later part of the Liaoning bronze dagger culture is often referred to as the &quot;Korean bronze dagger culture,&quot; since it was largely restricted to the Korean peninsula. At this point the Liaoning culture artifacts begin to disappear from the northeast China area. A new form of dagger begins to turn up on the Korean peninsula, straight and slender (Sehyungdonggeom, 세형동검).

The greatest concentration of bronze daggers is found in the Geum River valley of South Chungcheong province. Away from this area, the daggers become progressively fewer. This appears to indicate that most daggers were produced in the Geum valley, and the other cultures of the peninsula acquired them primarily by trade. Trade also took place by sea, with artifacts from the Later Phase found in Japanese archeological sites as well.

Lee (1996) divides this phase into two distinct sections: one dating to the 3rd century BCE in which the production of slender bronze daggers predominated, and one dating to the 2nd century BCE in which daggers are often accompanied by bronze mirrors with geometric designs and halberds influenced by the Chinese Qin state. In the first part, a single pottery culture typified by clay-band applique is found throughout the Korean peninsula, but in the second part distinctive pottery types emerge in the northwest and the remainder of the peninsula.

== Historical identity ==
The disappearance of the Liaoning bronze dagger culture from Liaoning appears to coincide with the State of Yan&#x27;s conquest of that area. The Korean bronze dagger culture of the Later Phase appears to correspond with the state of Jin, which occasionally enters Chinese annals as a contemporary of Wiman Joseon. Lee (1984, p. 13) views this as the period of emergence of the &quot;walled-town states&quot; in Korean culture, a hierarchical political structure in contrast to the tribal system which had prevailed during the Neolithic period.

Other archaelologists have associated the culture with the ancient Shanrong people, a group that lived on the periphery of Yan. However, convincing evidence for either assignment is still lacking.
