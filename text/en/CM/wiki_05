<text>Samuel Marsden (25 June 1765 – 12 May 1838) was an English-born priest of the Church of England in Australia and a prominent member of the Church Missionary Society. He played a leading role in bringing Christianity to New Zealand. Marsden was a prominent figure in early New South Wales and Australian history, partly through his ecclesiastical offices as the colony&#x27;s senior Church of England cleric and as a pioneer of the Australian wool industry, but also for his employment of convicts for farming and his actions as a magistrate at Parramatta, both of which attracted contemporary criticism.

==Early life==
Born in Farsley, near Pudsey, Yorkshire in England as the son of a Wesleyan blacksmith turned farmer, Marsden attended the village school and spent some years assisting his father on the farm. In his early twenties his reputation as a lay preacher drew the attention of the evangelical Elland Society, which sought to train poor men for the ministry of the Church of England. With a scholarship from the Elland Society Marsden attended Hull Grammar School, where he became associated with Joseph Milner and the reformist William Wilberforce, and after two years, he matriculated, at the age of 25, at Magdalene College, Cambridge. He abandoned his degree studies to respond to the call of the evangelical leader Charles Simeon for service in overseas missions. Marsden was offered the position of second chaplain to the Reverend Richard Johnson&#x27;s ministry to the Colony of New South Wales on 1 January 1793.

Marsden married Elizabeth Fristan at Holy Trinity, Hull on 21 April 1793. The following month William Buller, the Bishop of Exeter, ordained him as a priest.

==In Australia==

Marsden travelled as a passenger on the convict ship, to Australia, his first child Anne being born en route. He arrived in the colony on 2 March 1794, and set up house in Parramatta, outside the main Port Jackson settlement.

In 1800 Marsden succeeded Johnson and became the senior Church of England chaplain in New South Wales; he would keep this post until his death.

Marsden was given grants of land by the colonial government and bought more of his own, which were worked with convict labour, a common practice in Australia at the time. By 1807 he owned of land. Successful farming ventures provided him with a secure financial base, although they also formed a plank of contemporary criticism of Marsden for alleged over-involvement in non-church affairs. In 1807 he returned to England to report on the state of the colony to the government, and to solicit further assistance of clergy and schoolmasters.

He concentrated on the development of strong heavy-framed sheep such as the Suffolk sheep breed, which had a more immediate value in the colony than the fine-fleeced Spanish merinos imported by John Macarthur. In 1809, Marsden was the first to ship wool to England from Australia for commercial use; this was made into cloth by Messrs W. &amp; J. Thompson, at Rawdon, West Yorkshire, and so impressed George III that he was given a present of Merino sheep from the Windsor stud. Four years later more than 4000 lbs (1814 kg) of his wool was sold in England. Marsden was an important promoter of the wool staple, even though his contribution to technology, breeding and marketing was far eclipsed by that of Macarthur. He is believed to have later introduced sheep to New Zealand, where he would develop a somewhat gentler reputation than in Australia.

In 1795, Governor John Hunter made the chaplains magistrates. Marsden&#x27;s role as magistrate at Parramatta, attracted criticism in his lifetime. History has remembered Marsden as the &quot;Flogging Parson&quot;, with contemporaries claiming that he inflicted severe punishments (notably extended floggings), even by the standards of his day. This view of Marsden is disputed in some circles as part of an anti-clerical writing of history, in turn attributed to a dislike of Roman Catholics and the Irish.

Joseph Holt, who was transported to Sydney following his negotiated surrender after the Irish Rebellion of 1798, gave vivid account in his memoirs of the search for Irish plotters in which he was arrested. Marsden was held to be involved in this secret action by the authorities. Holt himself was released but witnessed the fate of others. He related: &quot;I have witnessed many horrible scenes; but this was the most appalling sight I had ever seen. The day was windy and I protest, that although I was at least fifteen yards to the leeward, from the sufferers, the blood, skin, and flesh blew in my face&quot;, as floggers &quot;shook it off from their cats&quot; (referring to the cat-of-nine-tails scourging lash). He continued &quot;The next prisoner who was tied up was Paddy Galvin, a young lad about twenty years of age; he was also sentenced to receive three hundred lashes. The first hundred were given on his shoulders, and he was cut to the bone between the shoulder-blades, which were both bare. The doctor then directed the next hundred to be inflicted lower down, which reduced his flesh to such a jelly that the doctor ordered him to have the remaining hundred on the calves of his legs ... &#x27;you shall have no music out of my mouth to make others dance upon nothing&#x27;. Some have written that Marsden ordered such treatment but Holt&#x27;s memoirs do not explicitly link Marsden to the floggings at Toongabbie on that day. Holt&#x27;s memoirs express his impression of Marsden, as &quot;a busy meddling man, of shallow understanding&quot; who thought himself &quot;a great lawyer&quot;. Holt believed that Marsden tried to intimate to Holt that his wife and children were free, but he was not. Holt considered that he had surrendered back in Ireland under terms of free exile. But when the Holt family arrived in Parramatta, Marsden, Aitkins and Dr Thomson called on them and asked Holt to accompany them to Toongabbie, where Captain Johnstone tried to assign him to the overseer Michael Fitzgerald. The next day the Governor was to come to Parramatta and Holt determined to ask the Governor, determined to &quot;have the highest authority, even the Governor himself, and not submit to the whims of understrappers, who always assume tenfold the airs that their superiors might be supposed to have&quot; (his opinion of Marsden). The Governor confirmed he was free.

Marsden&#x27;s attitudes to Irish Roman Catholic convicts were illustrated in a memorandum which he sent to his church superiors during his time at Parramatta:

Despite Marsden&#x27;s opposition to Catholicism being practised in Australia, Governor Philip Gidley King permitted monthly Catholic Masses in Sydney from May 1803, although these were to take place under police surveillance.

In 1806, Marsden was the originator of the New South Wales &quot;Female Register&quot; which classed all women in the colony (excepting some widows) as either &quot;married&quot; or &quot;concubine&quot;. Only marriages within the Church of England were recognised as legitimate on this list; women who married in Roman Catholic or Jewish ceremonies were automatically classed as concubines. The document eventually circulated within influential circles in London, and is believed to have influenced contemporary views of the Australian colony as a land of sexual immorality, some of which survived into 20th-century historiography.

In 1809, Marsden was in England. There he befriended the Maori chief Ruatara who had gone to Britain in the whaling ship &quot;Santa Anna&quot; and been stranded there. Marsden and Ruatara returned together on the convict transport &quot;Ann&quot; (or &quot;Anne&quot;), which was under the command of Captain Charles Clarke and which carried some 198 male convicts. They arrived in Sydney on 17 or 27 February 1810. Ruatara stayed with Marsden at Parramatta for some time, and again in 1811 after a failed attempt to reach New Zealand. Ruatara eventually reached New Zealand where he did more to facilitate Marsden&#x27;s mission to the Maori than any other native.

In 1822, Marsden was dismissed from his civil post as a Parramatta magistrate (along with several other officials) on charges of exceeding his jurisdiction.

During his time at Parramatta, Marsden befriended many Māori visitors and sailors from New Zealand. He cared for them on his farm, providing accommodation, food, drink, work and an education for up to three years. He gave one Māori chief some land on which he could grow his own crops and taught other Māori to read and write English. He learnt Māori, beginning an English-Māori translation sheet of common words and expressions.

Marsden described himself as first and foremost a preacher. His sermons therefore are important primary documentation in Marsden studies. There are approximately 135 sermons written by Marsden in various collections around the world. The largest collection is in the Moore Theological College Library in Sydney, Australia. These sermons reveal Marsden&#x27;s attitudes to some of the controversial issues he faced, including magistrates, the aboriginal people and wealth. A transcription of the Moore College collection can be found online.

Of Aboriginal People he wrote that &quot;The Aborigines are the most degraded of the human race … The time has not yet arrived for them to receive the blessings of civilisation and the knowledge of Christianity&quot;.

==Mission to New Zealand==
===Background===
Marsden was a member of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) (founded in 1799) and remained formally based in New South Wales, but developed an interest in evangelising New Zealand from the early 1800s onwards. Europeans had known of New Zealand since the 1640s and by the early 19th century there had been increasing contact between Māori and Europeans, mainly by the many whalers and sealers around the coast of New Zealand and especially in the Bay of Islands. A small community of Europeans had formed in the Bay of Islands, made up of explorers, flax traders, timber merchants, seamen, and ex-convicts who had served their sentences in Australia (as well as some who had escaped the Australian penal system). Marsden was concerned that they were corrupting the Māori way of life, and lobbied the Church Missionary Society to send a mission to New Zealand.

In June 1813, Marsden wrote to the Secretary of the CMS seeking £500 per annum to form an Auxiliary CMS Society in New South Wales, with a view of assisting engaging in missionary work among the Māori people in New Zealand. At a meeting in the Colony of New South Wales, held at Sydney, on 20 December 1813, Marsden formed the &quot;New South Wales Society for affording Protection to the Natives of the South Sea Islands, and promoting their Civilization, for the protection of South Sea Islanders who may be brought to Port Jackson&quot;, and to defend their claims on the masters and owners of the vessels who mistreat those islanders.

===First trip to New Zealand===
Thomas Kendall and William Hall sailed on the &quot;Earl Spencer&quot;, departing on 31 May 1813 from Britain for Sydney, arriving on 10 October 1813. On 7 March 1814, they were then sent by Marsden via Hobart to the Bay of Islands, New Zealand, on a voyage of investigation, returning to Sydney in August 1814.

In 1814, Marsden had purchased the brig &quot;Active&quot;, for £1,400, mostly with his own money as the Church Missionary Society refused to provide funds for a ship. As a result of the initial investigatory voyage, lay missionaries Thomas Kendall, John King and William Hall were chosen for the New Zealand mission and, accompanied by Marsden on his first visit to New Zealand, departed on the &quot;Active&quot; from Sydney on 14 November 1814. The missionaries, Kendall, King and Hall, together with free settler Thomas Hansen, arrived in Rangihoua Bay on 22 December 1814. With them were the first horses in New Zealand, a stallion and two mares, brought from Australia by Marsden. 

Marsden met Māori rangatira (chiefs) from the Ngāpuhi iwi (tribe), who controlled the region around the Bay of Islands, including the chief Ruatara who had lived with him in Australia, and a noted war leader, Hongi Hika, who had helped pioneer the introduction of the musket to Māori warfare in the previous decade. Hongi Hika returned with them to Australia on 22 August.

The first known Christian sermon on land in New Zealand was preached by Marsden at Oihi Bay (a small cove in the north-east of Rangihoua Bay) on Christmas Day, 1814. The service from the Church of England &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; was read in English but it is likely that, having learnt the language from Ruatara, Marsden preached his sermon in the Māori language. Ruatara was prevailed upon to explain those parts of the sermon the 400-strong Māori congregation did not understand.

On 24 February 1815 Marsden purchased land at Rangihoua for the first Christian mission in New Zealand. The death of Ruatara on 15 March 1815 and the loss of his protection for the mission may have contributed to a lack of growth of European settlement in the area and its displacement, in the 1820s, by the Kerikeri as the senior mission in New Zealand. By the 1830s the houses of the mission at Oihi had deteriorated and the mission moved to Te Puna, further to the west in Rangihoua Bay. The mission finally closed in the 1850s.

===Establishment of the mission===

At the end of the year Kendall, Hall and King returned to start a mission to the Ngāpuhi under Ruatara&#x27;s (and, later, Hongi Hika&#x27;s) protection in the Bay of Islands. Hongi Hika returned with them, bringing a large number of firearms from Australia for his warriors.

A mission station was founded with a base at Rangihoua Bay, later moved to Kerikeri, (where the mission house and stone store can still be seen), and ultimately a model farming village at Te Waimate. The mission would struggle on for a decade before attracting converts, in competition with Wesleyan and Catholic missions. Thomas Kendall abandoned his wife for the daughter of a Māori tohunga (priest), and also flirted with Maori traditional religion.

In 1815 the Ngāpuhi chief Tītore went to Sydney and spent two years with Marsden. In 1817 Tītore and Tui (also known as Tuhi or Tupaea (1797?–1824)) sailed to England in the brig, &quot;Kangaroo&quot;. They visited Professor Samuel Lee at Cambridge University and assisted him in the preparation of a grammar and vocabulary of Māori which, following a visit to Lee by the Ngāpuhi chiefs Hongi Hika and Waikato, was published in 1820 as &quot;First Grammar and Vocabulary of the New Zealand Language&quot;.

Marsden was in the Bay of Islands in May 1820 when HMS &quot;Coromandel&quot;, under the command of Captain James Downie, arrived at the Bay of Islands from England for the purpose of procuring a cargo of timber in the Firth of Thames. When &quot;Coromandel&quot; sailed for the Thames a few days later, Marsden accompanied them on their voyage. Downie reported that while at the Bay of Islands whalers were in the practice of trading muskets and ammunition for pork and potatoes.

In 1820 Hongi Hika and Thomas Kendall travelled to England on the whaling ship . Hongi Hika met George IV, who gifted him a suit of armour; he also obtained further muskets when passing through Sydney on his return to New Zealand. On his return to the Bay of Islands, Ngāpuhi demanded the Church Missionary Society missionaries trade muskets for food, which under Kendall became an important means of support for the Kerikeri mission station. The trade was opposed by Marsden, largely because of its impact on the wide-ranging intertribal warfare occurring among Māori at the time.

For refusing to stop trading arms, Kendall was dismissed by the Church Missionary Society in 1822. Marsden, who also knew of Kendall&#x27;s romantic affair, returned to New Zealand in August 1823 to sack him in person. When Marsden and Kendall sailed from the Bay of Islands, their ship the &quot;Brampton&quot; was wrecked. Marsden later went to some trouble talking to all Australian printers to prevent Kendall from publishing a Māori grammar book, apparently largely out of spite.

===Legacy===
Marsden is generally remembered favourably in New Zealand, which he visited seven times (the longest trip lasting seven months). The Anglican school, Samuel Marsden Collegiate School in Karori, Wellington was named after Marsden. Houses at King&#x27;s College, Auckland, King&#x27;s School, Auckland and at Corran School for Girls are also named after him.

In 1819, Marsden introduced winegrowing to New Zealand with the planting of over 100 different varieties of vine in Kerikeri, Northland. He wrote: 
==Later life==

Marsden was on a visit to the Reverend Henry Stiles at St Matthew&#x27;s Church at Windsor, New South Wales when he succumbed to an incipient chill and died at the rectory on 12 May 1838.

Marsden is buried in the cemetery near his old church at Parramatta, St John&#x27;s.

==In fiction and popular culture==
The Australian poet Kenneth Slessor wrote a satirical poem criticising the parson, &quot;Vesper-Song of the Reverend Samuel Marsden&quot;.

New Zealand reggae band 1814 took their name from the year that Marsden held the first sermon in the Bay of Islands.

Bryan Bruce&#x27;s 2001 documentary, &quot;Workhorse to Dreamhorse&quot; includes a story about Marsden&#x27;s stallion.

A portrait of Marsden based on Robert Hughes&#x27; &quot;The Fatal Shore&quot; appears in Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s book &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;.

In the 1978 Australian television series &quot;Against the Wind&quot;, Marsden was portrayed by David Ravenswood.

In the 1980 television adaptation of Eleanor Dark&#x27;s 1941 novel &quot;The Timeless Land&quot;, Marsden is portrayed by John Cousins.

<text>Second Lieutenant Alexander Buller Turner VC (22 May 1893 − 1 October 1915) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC) during the First World War, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. His younger brother, Victor, was a recipient of the VC in the Second World War.

==Early life and military career==
Turner was born at home in Reading, Berkshire on 22 May 1893 to Charles Turner, later a major in the Royal Berkshire Regiment, and his second wife Jane Elizabeth, only daughter of Admiral Sir Alexander Buller. He was educated at Parkside School, Surrey and Wellington College, Berkshire and commissioned into the Special Reserve of Officers, Royal Berkshire Regiment, 3rd (Reserve) Battalion, on 11 September 1914, five weeks after the outbreak of the First World War. He was subsequently transferred to the 1st Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment. The battalion, a Regular Army unit, part of the 6th Brigade of the 2nd Division, was serving in trenches of the Western Front.

He was 22 years old, and a second lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment (Princess Charlotte of Wales&#x27;s), British Army, attached to 1st Battalion during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

On 28 September 1915 at Fosse 8, near Vermelles, France, when the regimental bombers could make no headway, Second Lieutenant Turner volunteered to lead a new bombing attack. He made his way down the communication trench practically alone, throwing bombs incessantly with such dash and determination that he drove off the Germans about 150 yards without a check. His action enabled the reserves to advance with very little loss and subsequently covered the flank of his regiment in its retirement, thus probably averting the loss of some hundreds of men. Second Lieutenant Turner died three days later of the wounds received in this action.

He was shot in the abdomen at close range during the action for which he was awarded the VC. He was reported to have died at No. 1 Casualty Clearing Station, Chocques on 1 October and he was buried at the Military Cemetery Chocques.

His brother was Lieutenant Colonel Victor Buller Turner VC and had a family connection with General Sir Redvers Buller VC.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment (Salisbury) Museum, Salisbury, Wiltshire.

The citation for his award, published in the London Gazette on 18 November 1915, reads as follows:

He is buried at the Chocques Military Cemetery in France. His medals are held by The Rifles Museum in  Winchester.

<text>São Roque do Pico () is a municipality in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores, occupying most of the northern side of the island of Pico. As of 2021, it has 3,221 inhabitants spread through five freguesias (civil parishes) in an area of 142.36 km².

The municipality is bordered by the Atlantic to the north, Lajes do Pico to the south and east, and Madalena to the west.

==History==
While the first incursions into the island occurred in the 15th century, the region that would become known as São Roque occurred later. The first colonizers of Pico came to occupy the area of Lajes, coming from the lands of the north of Portugal, because there were few anchorages in other parts of the island. What occurred in the north was starkly different: these colonizers were families from Graciosa, who would much later be supplemented by Flemings from Faial, under the orders of Josse van Huerter. At this time São Roque was a peripheral jurisdiction of Lajes do Pico, and many of its religious and cultural ceremonies were centred in this municipal centre from the Convent of São Francisco.

This influence of Faial would continue for much of the island&#x27;s history, becoming integrated into the Captaincy (colonial administration) of its neighbour.

The municipality was created in 1542, when its citizenry petitioned King John of Portugal to provide them administrative autonomy from Lajes. King John, therefore, carved from Lajes do Pico the territory of São Roque do Pico, while at the same time instituting the civil parishes of São Roque and Nossa Senhora da Ajuda. By granting this concession, the Álvares family promised to celebrate a mass once per week &quot;...until the World lasted&quot;, which has been transmitted across their descendants.

The little hermitage of São Roque, and chapel of &quot;Bom Jesus&quot;, was insufficient to handle its growing populous, and it was decided in 1714 to construct the Church of São Roque, which was completed twelve years.

At the time the population was dedicated primarily to a subsistence lifestyle, with some small cultivation of grapes for the production of wine, and an active fishery. The volcanic eruptions that occurred during the 18th century turned much of the soil fertile, that resulted in the mass production of Verdelho wine, which was a popular export to America and Europe.

By the 19th century, disease infected the vineyards of the north, devastating the wine-making culture, which slowly progressed throughout the island, until the introduction of new castes. But, meanwhile, the Sãoroquenses turned to other economic sources of growth, but specifically, concentrating on the whaling in order to supplement the fishery. This culture was an important part of the municipality, resulting in the establishment of five separate factories along the coast in order support the transformation of whales into oils, perfumes and fertilizers. Even by the 20th century, the municipal seat became the home for the &quot;Fabrica das Armações Baleeiras Reunidas&quot; create in 1942, which was a union between the older companies &quot;Companhia Velha Baleeira, Lda.&quot;, &quot;Armação Baleeira do Livramento, Lda.&quot; and the &quot;Armação Baleeira Atlântica, Lda.&quot; and continued to function until the 1980s. After this, the building was transformed in the post-whaling period into a museum to exhibit the artifacts for this era, including machines, implements and maquetes demonstrating the whale hunt, the peoples involved in the activity and the hardships of the local economy associated with whaling.

==Geography==

The climate of the municipality is mild and humid, with median temperatures oscillating between and , with a regular level of precipitation throughout the year.
The municipal seat of São Roque is the primary urban agglomeration along the northern coast, organized around two principal poles: in the west, the historic village of São Roque and &quot;Cais do Pico&quot; in the east, which grew from the activities associated with the sea, whaling and fishing after the middle of the 19th century. These two areas form the nucleus of the civil parish of São Roque, but the municipality of São Roque do Pico extends over one third of the island of Pico, along the northern coast, encompassing five civil parishes, that consist of:
* Prainha - The second settlement founded on the northern coast of the island; the settlement was for centuries the center of production of the verdelho wine. It is located relatively close to a lava field resulting from a volcanic eruption in 1572, and overlooked by a small bucolic lagoon, Lagoa do Caiado.
* Santa Luzia - Includes the seaside villages of Lajido and Cabrito, but extends to many typical buildings constructed from basaltic volcanic rock, including the Lajido do Meio and the area around Ribeira Nova.
* Santo Amaro - A parish recognized for its contribution to manual shipbuilding on the island, it settlements extend along the coast from the main village to heights of Terra Alta.
* Santo António - Named after the Portuguese-born saint, the parish includes the small villages of Santana and Sao Vicente.
* São Roque - A relatively old town and commercial port (&quot;Cais do Pico&quot;) connected with the whaling industry and the site of the only whaling-processing factory in the municipality.

===Climate===
Due to its location at the northern foothills of Mount Pico and the Achada Plateau, São Roque has a unique micro-climate, receiving more precipitation than any other municipality in Portugal. Averaging between at the coast and surpassing in the mountains. Twice as much as in the neighboring municipality of Madalena or in the remaining islands of the archipelago.

According to the Köppen climate classification, the coastal areas of São Roque have a humid subtropical climate, but with significant Mediterranean influences. Winters are very mild and wet and summers are warm and drier. Humidity is around 80% year-round.

It changed hands in successive years to serve as courts, prison and finance services before falling into ruin, before converted to youth hostel.

<text>Geoffroi de Charney, also known as Guy d&#x27;Auvergne, (died 11 or 18 March 1314) was preceptor of Normandy for the Knights Templar. In 1307 de Charny was arrested, along with the entire Order of Knights Templar in France, and in 1314 was burned at the stake.

== Early life ==
Not much is known about de Charney&#x27;s early life. He was accepted into the Order of Knights Templar at a young age by Amaury de la Roche, Preceptor of France. Present at the ceremony was Jean le Franceys, the preceptor of Pédenac.

==Persecution of the Templars==

The Order of the Templars was originally created to protect pilgrims on the road to Jerusalem. The Templars&#x27; mission was then expanded to fight in the Crusades.

The persecution of the Templars began in France as a plan by King Philip IV, with the complicity of Pope Clement V. On 13 October 1307, the King ordered an arrest of all Templars in France. On 22 November 1307 Clement V, under pressure from the King, issued the papal decree &quot;Pastoralis praceminentiae&quot; that ordered all Christian monarchs to arrest any Templars and confiscate their lands in the name of the Pope and the Church. Though the order went out to England, Iberia, Germany, Italy and Cyprus, Templar Grand Master Jacques de Molay, Geoffrey de Charney and many other Templars were in France, and under the orders of the French king, were arrested and tortured until they confessed to the crimes of which they were accused.

In 1307, the Pope sent two cardinals to interview Jacques de Molay and Hugues de Pairaud, who recanted their confessions and told the other Templars to do the same. Two other Templars, Pierre de Bologna and Renaud de Provins, also tried to convince other Templars to recant their confessions and by early May 1310, close to six hundred did so. Pierre de Bologna was never seen again and Renaud de Provins was later sentenced to life imprisonment.

===Initial charges===
Geoffroi de Charney and the other Templars in France were arrested on 13 October 1307. Many charges were leveled against them; they were notably similar to those directed at other enemies of Philip, such as heresy, sodomy and blasphemy.

There were initially five charges lodged against the Templars: 
*The first was renouncing Christ and spitting on the cross during initiation into the Order.
*The second was that the initiate was allegedly stripped and thrice kissed by the preceptor, on his navel, posterior and mouth.
*The third was telling the neophyte (novice) that unnatural lust was lawful and indulged in commonly.
*The fourth was that the cord worn by the neophyte day and night was &quot;consecrated&quot; by wrapping it around an idol in the form of a human head with a great beard, and that this idol was adored in all chapters.
*The fifth was that the priests of the order did not consecrate the host in celebrating Mass. 
Many of these charges were also made against Pope Boniface VIII before his capture, escape and eventual death shortly in 1303. Philip&#x27;s agents pursued these charges as they had been successful against other enemies of the King. On 12 August 1308, the charges were increased, with one specifically stating that the Templars worshipped an idol made of a cat and a head with three faces. The lists of articles 86 to 127 would add many other charges.

=== Recantation and death of Templar leaders in France ===
Eventually King Philip&#x27;s Inquisitors succeeded in making Jacques de Molay confess to the charges. On 18 March 1314, de Molay and de Charney recanted their confessions, stating they were innocent of the charges and they were only guilty of betraying their Order by confessing under duress to something they did not do. They were immediately found guilty of being relapsed heretics, for which the punishment was death. This effectively silenced the other Templars. Philip continued to pressure and threaten the Pope to officially disband the Order, which culminated in 1314 with the public execution by burning of leader Jacques de Molay and Geoffroi de Charney.

==Death==

His exact day of death is disputed by scholars. One source records his death as follows: The cardinals dallied with their duty until 19 March 1314, when, on a scaffold in front of Notre Dame, de Molay, Geoffroi de Charney, Master of Normandy, Hugues de Peraud, referred to as &quot;a visitor of France&quot;, and Godefroi de Gonneville, Master of Aquitaine, were brought forth from the jail in which for nearly seven years they had lain, to receive the sentence agreed upon by the cardinals, in conjunction with the Archbishop of Sens and some other prelates whom they had called in. Considering the offences which the culprits had confessed and confirmed, the penalty imposed was in accordance with the rule—that of perpetual imprisonment. The affair was supposed to be concluded when, to the dismay of the prelates and wonderment of the assembled crowd, de Molay and Geoffroi de Charney arose. They had been guilty, they said, not of the crimes imputed to them, but of basely betraying their Order to save their own lives. It was pure and holy; the charges were fictitious and the confessions false. Hastily the cardinals delivered them to the Prevot of Paris, and retired to deliberate on this unexpected contingency, but they were saved all trouble. When the news was carried to Philippe he was furious. The King was furious and they were both pronounced relapsed heretics to be burned without a further hearing; the facts were notorious and no formal judgment by the papal commission need be waited for. That same day, by sunset, a pile was erected on a small island in the Seine, the Ile des Juifs, near the palace garden. There de Molay and de Charney were slowly burned to death, refusing all offers of pardon for retraction, and bearing their torment with a composure which won for them the reputation of martyrs among the people, who reverently collected their ashes as relics.

==Legacy and the &quot;curse&quot;==
Little more than a month later, Clement V died from a disease thought to have been lupus, and eight months later Philip IV was killed at the age of forty-six in a hunting accident. Their deaths gave rise to the legend that de Molay had cited them before the tribunal of God. Such stories became legend. Even in distant Germany, Philippe&#x27;s death was spoken of as retribution for his destruction of the Templars, and Clement was described as shedding tears of remorse on his death-bed for three great crimes, the poisoning of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor and the ruin of the Templars and the Beguines.

Author Malcolm Barber has researched this legend and concluded that it originates from &quot;La Chronique métrique attribuée à Geffroi de Paris&quot; (ed. A. Divèrres, Strasbourg, 1956, pages 5711-5742). Geoffrey of Paris was &quot;apparently an eye-witness, who describes Molay as showing no sign of fear and, significantly, as telling those present that God would avenge their deaths&quot;.

This series of events forms the basis of &quot;Les Rois maudits&quot; (&quot;The Accursed Kings&quot;), a series of historical novels written by Maurice Druon between 1955 and 1977, in which Charney is a supporting character. The novels were also adapted into two French television miniseries in 1972 and 2005.

<text>The British Rail Class 458 &quot;Juniper&quot; (4-JOP later 5-JUP) is a class of electric multiple-unit passenger trains of the Alstom Coradia Juniper family, built at Washwood Heath between 1998 and 2002 for South West Trains. The order for the original fleet of 30 four-car trains was placed in 1997, and delivery of the first unit followed in October 1998. The fleet entered passenger service between 2000 and 2003 and is maintained at Bournemouth depot.

Between 2013 and 2016, the class was merged with the mechanically similar Class 460 fleet and extensively rebuilt to form a fleet of 36 five-car units—designated Class 458/5—to provide an increase in capacity on services into . The trains are now used by South Western Railway.

In March 2021, South Western Railway announced that 28 Class 458 units would be refurbished for use on long-distance services on the Portsmouth Direct line, as a result of the company deciding to abandon its original plan to use upgraded Class 442 units for this purpose. By 2024, this plan had been dropped, and the refurbished units were instead deployed on limited services out of London Waterloo from 24 June 2024.

==History==
South West Trains began operating the South Western franchise in February 1996, having inherited all of its rolling stock from British Rail. While this included a small number of trains built in the late 1980s and a larger number of suburban units delivered between 1982 and 1985, a significant proportion of the overall fleet was formed by much older slam-door First Generation EMUs, such as Classes and . In order to begin replacing these older units, SWT issued in November 1996 a request for tenders to supply 30 new air-conditioned four-car EMUs, and in 1997 together with rolling stock lessor Porterbrook awarded to Alstom a £90 million contract for their delivery.

Some railway industry commentators noted that SWT were going above and beyond the requirements of their franchise award in placing the order, and speculated that it could be a strategy to allay concerns about the fact that the same company—Stagecoach Group—owned both South West Trains and Porterbrook. This represented a potential conflict of interest at a time when rolling stock leasing companies, and Porterbrook in particular, were being criticised for extracting significant profits from leasing cheaply-acquired ex-BR stock.
All 30 units, numbered 458001–458030, were fitted out at the former Metro-Cammell works at Washwood Heath in Birmingham, which Alstom had acquired in 1989, with the bodyshells being built in Barcelona, Spain. Each unit was formed of two motor cars with driver&#x27;s cabs, an intermediate trailer car, and an intermediate motor car. Both driving cars had small sections of first-class seating, while the intermediate cars were all standard class. The trailer car was provided with a pantograph well and space for an alternating-current transformer, enabling conversion to overhead-line operation if required at a later date. One bogie on each motor car was fitted with traction motors, for a total of 6 motors along the train, a maximum speed of , and a cumulative power output of . Both driving cars were also provided with end gangways, with the intent of allowing passengers and crew to move between coupled units. They are the only members of the Juniper family to have such provision.

The first unit, 458001, was delivered to SWT for pre-acceptance testing on 31 October 1998. Attempts to place the new class into passenger service were beset by delays and major technical problems. The roofs of the new trains leaked, allowing water ingress to both the driver&#x27;s cabs and passenger saloons. Onboard electronics repeatedly failed, affecting the air-conditioning and traction systems, and the Train Management System (TMS) software also proved to be unreliable. More problems were encountered in coupling process and the design of the end gangwaysexisting practice with ex-BR stock taught that units could be coupled or uncoupled in the space of just a few minutes, but the Juniper gangway design was significantly more complex and took far longer to operate. Additionally, the entire TMS had to be restarted whenever units were coupled and uncoupled, which meant that the total time taken to couple or uncouple Class 458 units could reach up to 30 minutes. Both of these facts in particular remained considerable limitations on the use of the new fleet; ultimately SWT had no choice but to treat the Junipers as being semi-permanently coupled in pairs. The first Class 458 passenger service eventually ran on 25 February 2000, but even then only two units (458004 and 458005) were available for use.
By March 2002 twenty-four of the thirty units had been delivered, but on an average day only nine to ten units were actually available for service. The last six units eventually arrived by October 2002, but it was another seven months—May 2003—before the entire fleet had entered service. The protracted and difficult introduction of the Juniper fleet is credited with influencing SWT&#x27;s decision in April 2001 to replace the rest of its slam-door units with an order of 785 vehicles from the competing Siemens Desiro family.

===Withdrawal from service===
Even after the full complement of units had entered service, reliability remained so poor that in January 2004 South West Trains announced that they would withdraw the entire Class 458 fleet at the December 2005 timetable change in readiness to return them to lessor Porterbrook when the lease on the fleet expired in February 2006. At the time of the announcement the trains were only managing an average of between major failures, whereas the new Siemens Desiro () units—which had only entered service in October 2003—were already achieving an average of between faults, and the slam-door fleet had regularly managed intervals of circa .

An additional 17 Class 450 units had been ordered to replace the Class 458 fleet, but as these new units would not be delivered for some time yet Porterbrook later agreed with SWT that the Junipers could stay in service on a pay-per-use basis past the original end of the lease. In a separate arrangement units 458001 and 458002 were transferred to Gatwick Express in September 2005 to act as a spare train for that operator, but they were returned to SWT in December 2006 without having been used.

In addition to reliability problems, continued use of the Class 458 fleet was complicated by issues surrounding compliance with the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations (RVAR) 1998. The Regulations, which mandate the accessibility features that vehicle designers and operators need to provide in order to meet the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, were in the process of being formulated at the same time as the Class 458 fleet was being designed and the finished units accordingly received temporary exemptions from compliance on a total of 10 different points.&lt;ref name=&quot;1999/2404&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2004/2149-exmem&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The exemption relating to the size of the internal passenger information displays expired on 31 July 2006—having already been extended from 30 September 2004—and the Department for Transport declined to provide any further extension.&lt;ref name=&quot;2004/2149&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; SWT fitted replacement displays of a compliant size to eight units for use as stand-by stock, while the remainder of the fleet was placed in storage.

===Return to service===
In September 2006 the Department for Transport confirmed after a competitive tender process that South West Trains had been awarded a new ten-year contract to operate the South Western franchise, starting in February 2007. As a result of the award, and in keeping with commitments made in its tender, SWT implemented a new rolling-stock plan that called for the withdrawal of its 24 units. Class and 450 units would take over the affected services, and the resulting gaps covered by re-activating the Class 458 fleet. There was some speculation from industry observers that this was made possible by Porterbrook significantly reducing the amount of money it charged SWT to lease the Junipers, given that there appeared to be no other operators interested in using the fleet.

Following the December 2006 timetable change, the stored Class 458 units began to return to service, and the Class 442 withdrawal was completed on 24 January 2007. By the end of the following February, observers reported that only four Junipers had not yet been re-activated, and that the general reliability of the fleet had improved so much that units now averaged between significant failures (defined as causing delays greater than five minutes).

The re-activation process included the fitting of RVAR-compliant internal displays to the entire fleet. The other points of RVAR non-compliance were covered by existing exemptions that remained valid until 31 December 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;2002/656&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Refresh and reliability improvements===
Between 2008 and 2010 the fleet was &#x27;refreshed&#x27; at Bournemouth Traincare Depot,
during which process the units were fitted with CCTV, new seats and tables in first class, and modified RVAR-compliant lavatories and doorway lights. The interiors were also cleaned and repainted.

In May 2010, SWT enabled regenerative braking on two Class 458 units as part of trial testing its potential use across both the Juniper and Desiro fleets. The trials were successful and regenerative braking was enabled across all 30 Class 458 units by mid-2011.

By the end of 2012 the fleet was achieving an average distance of between significant failures; making it the most reliable fleet in Britain and the first to achieve 6-figure mileages. The feat was recognised with a Modern Railways magazine &quot;Golden Spanner&quot; award in the New Generation EMU category on 23 November 2012.

==2013 conversion to Class 458/5==
South West Trains had experienced a considerable shortage of passenger capacity on many of its suburban routes in the years up to 2012, which it attributed primarily to the fact that passenger numbers had increased dramatically without a corresponding rise in the size of the operator&#x27;s fleet. The company had suggested to the Department for Transport on at least three occasions that more units should be purchased from Siemens, but had been turned down each time.

As an alternative, Porterbrook proposed to enlarge the Class 458 fleet and reconfigure it for suburban services by using vehicles from the fleet, which Porterbrook also owned and which was at that time being released from service with Gatwick Express. The process, budgeted at £42 million, would allow for all 30 original Class 458 units to be extended by one vehicle, making them into five-car units, after which there would be six five-car Class 460 units left over. These would be comprehensively rebuilt to match the extended Class 458 units, for a total fleet of 36 five-car units that would be designated Class 458/5. The units of this &quot;new&quot; fleet would be used—either individually or in pairs of ten cars—to provide extra peak-time capacity on suburban services into Waterloo from the Hounslow, Weybridge (via Staines), and Windsor lines. A separate improvements package agreed between SWT and Network Rail provided for platform extensions necessary for ten-car operation at over 60 suburban stations, and for the re-opening of one of the four disused platforms at the former Waterloo International terminal.

The Department for Transport announced in December 2011 that it had accepted the proposal, and an agreement between Porterbrook and South West Trains was signed in January 2012. South West Trains described the project as advancing its aspiration to become a &quot;10-car railway&quot;, and the company&#x27;s fleet director noted that while the project was &quot;much more complicated ... than buying new trains&quot;, it was also &quot;significantly cheaper&quot;. The primary contract for delivering the project was awarded to Alstom, who appointed Wabtec to perform the conversion work on its behalf.
All 48 intermediate vehicles from the Class 460 fleet were sent to Wabtec&#x27;s Doncaster Works to be rebuilt and refitted. Twelve of the 16 driving vehicles were rebuilt by Wabtec subsidiary Brush Traction at its workshops in Loughborough, where their original driver&#x27;s cabs were replaced with newly fabricated versions that included gangways and Voith automatic couplers of the same types used on Class 444 and 450 units. Four of the selected driving vehicles had been built with luggage compartments, and these were removed and their roller-shutter external doors were replaced with power-operated plug doors like those used on the other vehicles. Together with 18 of the intermediate cars from the Class 460 vehicles, these became the six &quot;new&quot; Class 458/5 units. The remaining 30 Class 460 cars were prepared for insertion into the Class 458/0s. 
Additional modifications included re-gearing the traction motors to reduce the train&#x27;s maximum speed from to , both to reduce the likelihood of overheating when making frequent stops and starts, and because the higher speed was unnecessary on suburban services. New Train Management System (TMS) software was developed to be compatible across the entire Class 458/5 fleet, simplifying maintenance and improving reliability. An Automatic Selective Door Opening (ASDO) system was installed for use at a small number of stations where it was impractical to lengthen platforms. The vehicle interiors were refurbished and reconfigured to provide more standing room for passengers, mainly by changing from 5- to 4-abreast seating and thus allowing a wider aisle. The units were also repainted into SWT&#x27;s blue livery, matching the Class 450 fleet.

SWT expected to receive the first two Class 458/5 units in May 2013—in time for them to enter service the following November—but due to delays in production the initial delivery did not take place until October. Following testing and staff training, entry into passenger service was achieved in March 2014. Once the first four fully-converted units had been delivered and accepted for service, SWT was able to start sending original Class 458/0 units for rebuilding. These units received the same modifications as the Class 460 conversions, leaving SWT and Porterbrook with a single mechanically homogenous Class 458/5 fleet. The last unmodified original units were withdrawn from service for rebuilding in November 2015, and returned to SWT after completion on 30 March 2016.

At the conclusion of the conversion project four Class 460 vehicles—all of them driving cars with luggage compartments—were superfluous; these were stripped for spare parts and later scrapped.

==2022-2024 conversion to Class 458/4==
The South Western franchise was transferred from South West Trains to South Western Railway (a FirstGroup/MTR joint venture) in August 2017. Prior to commencing operations, SWR had taken advantage of low finance costs to order from Bombardier Transportation a new fleet of 750 vehicles—now designated —that would replace Classes , , 458, and on South Western suburban services from late 2019 onwards. However, continuing delays to the Class 701 programme kept all four older fleets in use into the 2020s.

In March 2021 South Western Railway announced that it was abandoning its plans to use refurbished units for long-distance services to and from London on the Portsmouth Direct line, citing continuing technical difficulties and future problems complying with accessibility regulations. To make up for the shortfall, 28 Class 458 units have been refurbished and were planned to be redeployed in their place. The refurbishment was performed by Alstom at Widnes in Cheshire at a cost of £25 million and involved returning each unit to its original four-car formation by removing the Class 460 vehicles, restoring the original maximum speed of , and reconfiguration of the passenger saloons. The reconfigured units will be leased from Porterbrook until 2027 at the earliest and are maintained at Bournemouth Traction and Rolling Stock Maintenance Depot. The first two units to be sent for refurbishment, 458507 and 458517, arrived at Widnes by mid-August 2022.

Testing for the 458/4s began on 9 October 2023.

In early 2024 it was announced that the plan to use the Class 458/4s on Portsmouth services had been dropped. Later, in May 2024, it was announced that the Class 458/4s would instead be used on some limited outer suburban services from London Waterloo. The first Class 458/4 entered service on 24 June 2024.&lt;ref name=&quot;458/4entrytoservice&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

By late August 2024 10 Class 458/4s had entered service.

The 458/4 conversion and refurbishment was completed on 12 December 2024.

Scrapping of the redundant EX-Class 460 vehicles started in January 2025.

==Incidents==
* On 30 January 2015, a small explosion occurred underneath a driving vehicle of unit 458501 near Windsor &amp; Eton Riverside station. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch determined that this was caused by a join between three underfloor power cables not being secured correctly when the unit was rebuilt in 2014.
* On 21 December 2019, unit 458519 was involved in a collision with a car between Wokingham and Bracknell. Nobody was seriously injured.

<doc id="1192398" wikidata="Q7325536" url="?curid=1192398" title="Richard Ernest William Turner">
<text>Lieutenant General Sir Richard Ernest William Turner, (25 July 1871 – 19 June 1961) was a senior Canadian Army officer who served during the Second Boer War and the First World War, and was a recipient of the Victoria Cross. While Turner always displayed great personal courage while under fire, he lacked the acumen for brigade- and division-sized tactics, and the men under his command during the First World War suffered grievous losses in several battles before he was moved into administrative roles.

==Early life==
Turner was born in Quebec City, the son of Richard Turner, and worked at his father&#x27;s grocery and lumber business, rising to partner before the First World War. He later took over the business, when he returned from the War. Turner joined the militia as a second lieutenant in 1892, his regiment of choice for commissioning being the Queen&#x27;s Own Canadian Hussars.

==Boer War==
Turner was 29 years old and a major in the Militia cavalry regiment the 10th Queen&#x27;s Own Canadian Hussars when he joined the second Canadian contingent to the Second Boer War. He reverted to lieutenant to join The Royal Canadian Dragoons, Canadian Army. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) with effective date 29 November 1900 for his actions at the Vet River on 6 May 1900.

On 7 November 1900, during a desperate rearguard action at the Leliefontein near the Komati River, Turner and Lieutenant Hampden Cockburn commanded a small group of men who repulsed a large force of Boers at close range, allowing two field guns to escape capture. Following the action, Turner and Cockburn were two of three men from their regiment who were subsequently awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery. (The other was Sergeant Edward James Gibson Holland.)

Turner was Mentioned in Despatches on 16 April 1901, and the VC citations were published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 23 April 1901. Turner&#x27;s read: 

He received the VC from the Duke of Cornwall and York (later King George V) during a grand military review in Quebec 17 September 1901, the second day of the visit to Canada of the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York during their Commonwealth tour. His Victoria Cross is currently stored as part of the RCD Archives and Collection at CFB Petawawa, Ontario.

==Pre-war service==
Turner was in command of a contingent of Canadian troops present in London for the Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra on 9 August 1902.

==First World War==
Promoted to brigadier general just after the outbreak of war on 29 September 1914, Turner was given command of the 3rd Brigade in the 1st Division of the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF). His brigade major was the then-Colonel Garnet Hughes, son of Sam Hughes, the bombastic Minister of Militia and Defence in Robert Borden&#x27;s government.

The 1st Division spent the winter of 1914–15 training in England, and were sent to France in February 1915. After a period of indoctrination about the realities of trench warfare, they took control of a section of trench in the Ypres Salient on 17 April 1915. Only five days later, the Germans used poison gas for the first time on the Western Front, sending clouds of chlorine wafting over the Allied trenches. French colonial troops on the Canadians&#x27; left flank broke, leaving an enormous hole in the Allied line.

In the chaos that followed, both Turner and Hughes sent erroneous messages back to Lieutenant General Edwin Alderson at divisional headquarters that their line had been broken and was in full retreat, when in fact the 3rd Brigade had not even been attacked yet. Turner was also responsible for sending two reserve battalions forward in a night-time attack on Kitcheners Wood, although he left the details to his subordinate Hughes. Much of the subsequent high casualty rate during the attack can be attributed to Hughes and his insistence on an immediate attack before proper reconnaissance could reveal the presence of enfilading machine gun nests. Although Turner demonstrated great personal bravery when his brigade headquarters came under direct small arms fire and suffered several near misses from artillery, he seemed unable to adequately cope with this new type of mechanized warfare nor with the demands of brigade-sized tactics.

On the second day of the battle, Turner&#x27;s brigade came under heavy attack, but was holding its position and repulsing the enemy despite losses from a second gas attack and heavy and accurate artillery fire. Alderson, believing that the Canadian division was capable of holding the line, ordered his brigade commanders to move reserves up to the front line to reinforce losses rather than withdraw. However, Turner made a sudden and unilateral decision to withdraw his brigade back to the General Headquarters (GHQ) line, several miles to the rear. Not only did Turner not inform Alderson, his commanding officer, of his decision, he also did not tell Brigadier General Arthur Currie, commanding the 2nd Brigade on Turner&#x27;s right, that Currie&#x27;s flank was now completely unprotected. (Currie would be forced to withdraw his brigade the next day, albeit in an orderly fashion, in order to avoid having his flank rolled up.) Turner&#x27;s orders were also very dangerous to the well-being of his men – companies in the front line were in close contact with the enemy; when they left the relative safety of their trenches to retreat across hundreds of yards of open fields in broad daylight, the companies of the 3rd Brigade were subject to accurate and devastating small arms and artillery fire, and suffered grievous losses. This was exacerbated by the uncoordinated nature of the withdrawal – the orders arrived at various companies at different times, leaving each to withdraw as best it could, without the benefit of covering fire from other units. Some never received the withdrawal order, or the order arrived too late; they were flanked, surrounded and either captured or killed. Most devastating to the Allies, the 3rd Brigade&#x27;s sudden withdrawal opened a 4,000-yard hole in their front line. Only the relative reticence of the Germans prevented an immediate catastrophe; having encountered stiff resistance from the Canadians the previous day, the Germans were not expecting a withdrawal, and were not positioned to immediately exploit the gap in the Allied front line the same day.

As the battle raged on, Turner travelled back to Corps headquarters to consult with his commanding officer, Edwin Alderson. The normally reserved Alderson exchanged sharp words with Turner about the unauthorized withdrawal of the 3rd Brigade, a withdrawal that now threatened the entire Ypres Salient. Historian George Cassar is of the opinion that, had Turner not been a popular Boer War hero and politically well-connected back in Canada, Alderson would have relieved him of command on the spot.

Turner was replaced as brigade commander by R. G. E. Leckie on 12 August 1915. His subsequent promotion to divisional command was opposed by Alderson, who considered him to be incompetent. However the well-connected Turner had the support of Sam Hughes and other Canadian politicians, and Alderson was overruled. Alderson bitterly wrote, &quot;I am sorry to say that I do not consider Turner really fit to command a Division and his name was not put forward by Sir John French, but Canadian politics have been too strong for all of us and so he has got it.&quot; Turner was subsequently appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours of June 1915, and promoted to major general in September 1915, and given command of the 2nd Division when it arrived in France. However, the division suffered heavy losses during the battle of St. Eloi in April 1916 when Turner lost communication with his division and did not form a clear picture of where they were on the confused battlefield. In addition, due to a miscommunication, his men were decimated by their own artillery, suffering 1,600 casualties as German soldiers retook the land, negating the gains made at heavy cost just a few days before. General Sir Herbert Plumer, the commander of British 2nd Army who had overall responsibility for the front, demanded the immediate dismissal of the 6th Brigade&#x27;s commander, Turner&#x27;s subordinate Huntly Ketchen, and when Turner claimed that if Ketchen was dismissed he would resign, the Canadian Corps&#x27; commander, Alderson, sought Turner&#x27;s dismissal as well. Both officers were supporters of Sam Hughes, who made it clear in no uncertain terms to Commander in Chief Sir Douglas Haig that if Turner went then Haig could no longer rely on Canadian support. This led to the diplomatic compromise of Alderson being relieved of his corps command and replaced by Julian Byng, while Turner and Ketchen retained their commands.

Turner was eventually relieved of field command on 5 December 1916 and shunted into administrative duties, becoming commander of Canadian forces operating in Britain and the Canadian government&#x27;s chief military adviser.

Turner was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours of June 1917, and promoted to lieutenant general on 9 June 1917. On 18 May 1918, he became the Chief of the General Staff, Overseas Military Forces of Canada. In addition, he was awarded the Croix de Guerre avec Palme and the Legion d&#x27;Honneur from the French government, and the Russian Order of the White Eagle with Swords.

<text>1000 Airplanes on the Roof is a melodrama in one act by Philip Glass which featured text by David Henry Hwang and projections by Jerome Sirlin. It is described by Glass as &quot;a science fiction music drama&quot;.

The work was commissioned by the Donau Festival, Krems an der Donau, The American Music Theater Festival, Philadelphia, and West Berlin City Council in 1988. It premiered on July 15, 1988, at the Vienna Airport in Hangar #3. The performance featured vocals by Linda Ronstadt and was conducted by Michael Riesman. The US premiere took place in September 1988 at The American Music Theater Festival, Philadelphia and went on to play in 40 US cities and Canada, including New York, Boston, Chicago and Toronto, as well as Glasgow, Scotland during that city&#x27;s celebration as European City of Culture.

==Synopsis==
The drama is set in New York City with a sole character, &quot;M&quot;, who recalls encounters with extraterrestrial life forms, including their message:
It is better to forget, it is pointless to remember. No one will believe you. You will have spoken a heresy. You will be outcast.
In the staged production, &quot;M&quot; performs in the midst of a three-dimensional, holographic set. In the classic sense of the word melodrama, the role is performed by an actor in a spoken monologue over music. Although in the world premiere, &quot;M&quot; was played by a male actor, the character was played alternately by female actor Jodie Long and male actor Patrick O&#x27;Connell in many of the US performances.

<text>Subedar Major Gyamtso Shangdarpa, (22 July 1924 – 1 July 2000) better known as Ganju Lama was born in the Kingdom of Sikkim on 22 July 1924 to Shangdarpa parents of the Bhutia Community. The etymology of the name &quot;Ganju Lama&quot; tells us that during the Chogyal period, sons of the Shangdarpa clan were expected to serve as monks. He enlisted in the British Indian Army in 1942 at the age of seventeen, as a rifleman in the 1st battalion, 7th Gurkha rifles. The Gurkha regiments were in dire need of manpower and would accept anyone who closely resembled a Gurkha. He is the only Bhutia recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Enlistment==
Ganju Lama was born in Sangmo, southern Sikkim, India, on 22 July 1924. He enlisted in the Army in 1942 at the age of seventeen. His parents were both of Sikkimese Bhutia descent and lived in Sikkim, which made him unusual, as he was neither an ethnic Gurkha nor a Nepalese subject. At that time, however, Gurkha regiments were prepared to accept any recruit who closely resembled a Gurkha and lived near the border of Nepal. Ganju Lama&#x27;s tribe lived in the kingdom of Sikkim. His name was Gyamtso Shangderpa, but a clerk in the recruiting office wrote it down as &quot;Ganju&quot;, and the name stuck. After leaving the regimental depot in 1943, he joined the 1st Battalion, 7th Gurkha Rifles, near Imphal.

==Victoria Cross==
Ganju Lama was nineteen years old, and a rifleman in the 1st Battalion, 7th Gurkha Rifles, in the Indian Army during World War II.

On 12 June 1944, near Ningthoukhong, India, &#x27;B&#x27; Company was attempting to stem the enemy&#x27;s advance when it came under heavy machine-gun and tank machine-gun fire. Ganju Lama, &quot;on his own initiative with great attitude &amp; coolness and complete disregard for his own safety&quot;, took his PIAT anti-tank weapon and crawled forward. Despite a broken wrist and two other serious wounds to his right leg and left hand he then moved forward, succeeded in bringing the weapon into action within 30 yards of the enemy tanks, knocking out two of them (a third was taken out by an anti-tank gun). He continued forward and used grenades on the tank crews who were trying to escape. Not until he &quot;had killed or wounded them all did he allow himself to be taken back to the Regimental Aid Post&quot; to have his wounds dressed.

A month earlier, during operations on the Tiddim Road, Ganju Lama&#x27;s yeshggb
regiment had surprised a party of Japanese and killed several of them. He was awarded the Military Medal for his part in that action. This award was announced in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; after his Victoria Cross, appearing on 3 October 1944, almost a month later.

==Later life==

After India gained its independence, he joined the Indian 11th Gorkha Rifles, retiring in 1968, to become a farmer in Sikkim. He was appointed honorary ADC to the President of India for life. He died at Gangtok following a battle with cancer on 1 July 2000, aged 75.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Gurkha Museum in Winchester, England along with those of other Gurkhas.

A memorial in his memory (Ganju Lama War Museum) has been constructed at Sherathang in East Sikkim district of Sikkim.

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Victor Buller Turner (17 January 1900 – 7 August 1972) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC) during the Second World War, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to members of British and other Commonwealth forces.

His older brother, Alexander Turner, received a posthumous VC during the First World War.

==Early life==
Victor Buller Turner was born in Reading, Berkshire on 17 January 1900. He was the son of Major Charles Turner of the Royal Berkshire Regiment of the British Army and his second wife, Jane Elizabeth, the only daughter of Admiral Sir Alexander Buller, a Royal Navy officer. He was the younger brother of Alexander Buller Turner VC and was also related to General Sir Redvers Buller VC.

Turner was educated at Parkside School, Surrey, Wellington College.

==Military career==
===1918–1939===
After attending the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Turner was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade (The Prince Consort&#x27;s Own) in December 1918. He served in the campaign in Iraq in 1919–20, was promoted lieutenant in December 1920, and again to major in July 1938.

===1939–1942===
Turner was promoted to temporary Lieutenant-Colonel in 1942 while serving in the Middle East, before the action in which he was awarded the VC.

====Victoria Cross====
On 27 October 1942, at El Aqqaqir (Kidney feature), Western Desert, Egypt, during the Second Battle of El Alamein, Lieutenant-Colonel Turner was commanding a battalion of the Rifle Brigade. After overcoming a German position, the battalion fought off desperate counter-attacks by 90 tanks, destroying or immobilising more than 50 of them. During the action, one of the 6-pounder guns was left with only one officer and a sergeant, so Colonel Turner joined them as loader, and between them they destroyed another five tanks. Not until the last tank had been repulsed did he consent to having a wound in his head attended to.

The citation for his award was published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 20 November 1942 and reads as follows: 

Turner&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum in Winchester, England.

====1942–45====
====Post-war====
He lived at Thatcham House before moving to Norfolk after the war and retired from the army in 1949.

In 1950, Turner was appointed to the Royal Household, with a post in the ceremonial King&#x27;s Bodyguard of the Yeomen of the Guard and rose to be &quot;Clerk of the Cheque and Adjutant&quot; of the Guard in 1955.

He was appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 1966 in connection with his services to the Royal Household and was promoted to Lieutenant of the Queen&#x27;s Bodyguard in 1967.

<text>La Strada International (LSI) is an international NGO network addressing the trafficking of persons in Europe.

==Creation==
La Strada International was created in October 2004, formalising an informal network that had existed since 1995. , it included member organisations from Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Macedonia, Moldova, the Netherlands, Poland, and Ukraine and an International Secretariat based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. In each of the eight member countries the programme is implemented by independent human rights non-governmental organizations.

==Aims==
LSI has an &quot;International Secretariat&quot;, whose main aims are information collection and research, with an online database for collating national-level data on individual cases and patterns of human trafficking; developing organisational capacity; and communicating in international organisations.

==Actions==
In 2002, La Strada Ukraine, together with the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), started a free national telephone hotline service in Ukraine for victims of human trafficking and for people planning on international travel and wanting advice on human trafficking risks.

==Networking==

La Strada International is a member organisation of the NGO networks Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women, PICUM — the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants and the Human Rights and Democracy Network.

In July 2010, LSI was granted consultative status by the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The consultative status gives LSI the ability to actively participate in the work of ECOSOC, as well as other bodies within the UN, such as the UN Secretariat. La Strada International will be allowed to consult with UN member states and discuss concerns and ideas within the field of human trafficking. LSI is also a member of OSCE Alliance Expert Coordination Team, the EU Fundamental Rights Agency Platform and has a participatory status with the Council of Europe.

LSI cooperates in anti-trafficking activities with EU and UN bodies. From 2009 to 2012 La Strada International, together with Anti-Slavery International implemented a three-year European project called &quot;Comp.act&quot;. The aim of the project was to improve access to justice and guarantee compensation for trafficked people. The project received institutional support from the Council of Europe and OSCE/ODIHR.

In 2013, LSI began coordinating the La Strada NGO Platform, a network of 21 European (EU and non-EU) NGOs from 20 countries, working to address human trafficking, migration, labour rights, and sex work.

<doc id="1192426" wikidata="Q5921785" url="?curid=1192426" title="Howell Raines">
<text>Howell Hiram Raines ( ; born February 5, 1943) is an American journalist, editor, and writer. He was executive editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; from 2001 until he left in 2003 in the wake of the scandal related to reporting by Jayson Blair. In 2008, Raines became a contributing editor for &quot;Condé Nast Portfolio&quot;, writing the magazine&#x27;s media column. After beginning his journalism career working for Southern newspapers, he joined &quot;The Times&quot; in 1978, as a national correspondent based in Atlanta. His positions included political correspondent and bureau chief in Atlanta and Washington, DC, before joining the New York City staff in 1993.

Raines has also published a novel, two memoirs, an oral history of the civil rights movement, and a history of the Union soldiers from Alabama who played a decisive role in the Civil War and were scrubbed from the history books. 

==Early life and career==
Raines was born in Birmingham, Alabama. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from Birmingham-Southern College in 1964 and a master&#x27;s degree in English from the University of Alabama in 1973. In September 1964, Raines began his newspaper career as a reporter for the &quot;Birmingham Post-Herald&quot; in Alabama. He also reported for WBRC-TV in Birmingham.

After a year as a reporter at the &quot;Birmingham News&quot;, in 1971 Raines was selected as political editor of the &quot;Atlanta Constitution&quot;. In 1976 he left that post to become political editor at the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;.

==&quot;The New York Times&quot;==
Raines joined &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1978, as a national correspondent based in Atlanta. By 1979, Raines was promoted to Atlanta&#x27;s bureau chief, a position he held until 1981, when he became a national political correspondent.

By the next year, Raines had advanced to become a White House correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot;. He progressed to management in 1985, becoming deputy Washington editor. In 1987, Raines transferred to London and worked as the newspaper&#x27;s London bureau chief. The next year, he returned to Washington, D.C., to become the city&#x27;s bureau chief.

In 1992, Raines published an essay, &quot;Grady&#x27;s Gift&quot;, about his childhood in Alabama. He fondly described the family&#x27;s black housekeeper. His memoir was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing.

In 1993, Raines moved to New York City as the &quot;Times&quot; editorial page editor, a position he held for eight years. The aggressive, colloquial style of his editorials, especially those critical of President Bill Clinton and his administration, drew widespread notice and a share of criticism. His work marked a departure from the measured tone for which &quot;Times&quot; editorials had been known.

Raines was appointed executive editor of &quot;The Times&quot; in September 2001, serving until May 2003. At that time, controversy generated by the reporting scandal related to Jayson Blair led to his dismissal. A &quot;Times&quot; internal investigation revealed that 36 of the 73 national stories Blair filed with the paper over a six-month period were marred by errors, false datelines, or evidence of plagiarism. Raines was faulted for continuing to publish Blair months after the paper&#x27;s metro editor, Jonathan Landman, sent him a memo urging him &quot;to stop Jayson from writing for &quot;The Times&quot;. Right now.&quot;

The Blair inquiry also revealed widespread discontent among &quot;Times&quot; staffers over Raines&#x27; management style, which was described as arbitrary and heavy-handed. According to a &quot;New York Times&quot; article, the deputy metropolitan editor, Joe Sexton, was quoted as telling Raines and managing editor Gerald Boyd, at a closed meeting of employees, &quot;I believe that at a deep level you guys have lost the confidence of many parts of the newsroom ... People feel less led than bullied.&quot; On another occasion Jerelle Kraus, art director for the newspaper&#x27;s weekend section, was quoted as saying, &quot;I hope things settle down and we get a decent executive editor who&#x27;s reasonable. Howell Raines is someone who is feared.&quot; Both Raines and Boyd resigned.

The paper&#x27;s owner, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr., also conducted an investigation and concluded that Raines had alienated most of the New York and Washington bureaus. Raines&#x27; resignation, along with that of Gerald Boyd, was announced in the June 5, 2003 issue of &quot;The Times&quot;.

Joseph Lelyveld, who had been executive editor of &quot;The Times&quot; from 1994 to 2001, agreed to replace Raines on an interim basis. On July 14, 2003, it was announced that Bill Keller had been chosen as Raines&#x27; permanent replacement. In an interview on the &quot;Charlie Rose Show&quot; of July 11, Raines admitted that Sulzberger had &quot;asked [him] to step aside.&quot;

==Later activities==
Raines reviewed his tenure as executive editor of the &quot;New York Times&quot; in a 21,000-word piece published in the May 2004 issue of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. In it, he said that he was hired by Sulzberger in the shared conviction that &quot;The Times&quot; had grown complacent and no longer functioned as a meritocracy in the assignment of stories to reporters.

In the private meeting with reporters called by Sulzberger, in which the owner announced Keller&#x27;s succession to Raines&#x27; old job, Sulzberger reportedly denied ever holding such a view. Raines stood by his account and implied that Sulzberger was retreating from the position which he said he and the owner shared at the time of his promotion.

In the only interview I have given on the Jayson Blair affair, I spoke on the Charlie Rose show of the resistance I had encountered as a &#x27;change agent&#x27; who was handpicked by the publisher to confront the newsroom&#x27;s lethargy and complacency. A few days later, as he introduced my successor, Bill Keller, to the assembled staff, Arthur [Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.] rebutted my comment by saying, &#x27;There&#x27;s no complacency here—never has been, never will be.&#x27; I can guarantee that no one in that newsroom, including Arthur himself, believed what he said ... Arthur&#x27;s words signaled that nothing dramatic would be done to upset the paper&#x27;s cosseted world.

Raines revisited the controversy in his 2006 book, &quot;The One That Got Away&quot;. It combines fishing stories and a review of his career as a journalist and editor. He assessed the events preceding the Jayson Blair scandal and his own dismissal. On January 14, 2008, &quot;Condé Nast Portfolio&quot; announced that Raines would become its media columnist. His first column, published in the March issue, analyzed the possibility of Rupert Murdoch buying the &quot;New York Times&quot;, which he said would have deeply adverse consequences. Raines published an op-ed in the March 14, 2010, edition of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that was highly critical of Fox News Channel. He suggested its biased reporting was not sufficiently criticized by legitimate media.

==Books by Raines==

In addition to his 2006 memoir, Raines&#x27; books have included a novel, &quot;Whiskey Man&quot; (1977); an oral history of the civil-rights movement, &quot;My Soul Is Rested: Movement Days in the Deep South Remembered&quot; (1983); the best-selling memoir &quot;Fly Fishing Through the Midlife Crisis&quot; (1993); and &quot;Silent Cavalry: How Union Soldiers from Alabama Helped Sherman Burn Atlanta--and Then Got Written Out of History&quot; (2023). 

==Family==
Raines&#x27;s son Ben was the discoverer of the remains of the last known ship to bring Africans as slaves to the United States, the &quot;Clotilda&quot;, in Alabama waters in 2019.

His other son, Jeff, is a guitarist for the New Orleans band Galactic.

<text>Thomas George Turrall VC (5 July 1885 – 21 February 1964) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Turrall was 30 years old, and a private in the 10th Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 3 July 1916 at La Boiselle, France, during a bombing attack by a small party against the enemy, the officer in charge was badly wounded and the party was compelled eventually to retire. Private Turrall remained with the wounded officer for three hours under continuous and heavy fire from machine-guns and bombs. Notwithstanding that both he and the officer were at one time completely cut off from the British troops, he held his ground with determination and finally carried the officer to the British lines after a counter-attack had made this possible.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at The Worcestershire Regiment collections in the Worcester City Art Gallery &amp; Museum, Worcester, England.

<text>Western music is a form of music composed by and about the people who settled and worked throughout the Western United States and Western Canada. Western music celebrates the lifestyle of the cowboy on the open range, along the Rocky Mountains, and among the prairies of Western North America. The genre grew from the mix of cultural influences in the American frontier and what became the Southwestern United States at the time, it came from the folk music traditions of those living the region, those being the hillbilly music from those that arrived from the Eastern U.S., the corrido and ranchera from Northern Mexico, and the New Mexico and Tejano endemic to the Southwest. The music industry of the mid-20th century grouped the western genre with that of similar folk origins, instrumentation and rural themes, to create the banner of &quot;country and western music&quot;, which was simplified in time to country music.

==Origins==
Western music is said to be influenced by the folk music traditions of England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, and cowboy songs sung around campfires in the 19th century, such as &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot;, can be traced back to European folk songs.

Additionally, Western music was impacted by the Blues, among other African-American folk traditions. Cowboy songs and the rural, early iteration of the Blues emerged around the same time and influenced each other as they developed. A significant figure who characterized the convergence of both musical traditions was Huddie &quot;Leadbelly&quot; Ledbetter, born in 1888 along the Texas/Lousiana border. Conventionally described as a songwriter who wrote the Blues and Western music, Leadbelly was associated with the African-American cowboys in eastern Texas. They impacted the genre by introducing a three chord ballad song structure, as well as their individualized experiences, which were reflected in the bluesy content of their lyrics.

Reflecting the realities of the open range and ranch houses where the music originated, and the earliest cowboy bands were often string bands supplemented occasionally with a handheld free reed aerophone. The harmonica, invented in the early 19th century in central Europe, arrived in North America shortly before the American Civil War; its small size and portability made it a favorite among the American public and the flood of pioneers heading westward, while squeezeboxes (such as the concertina and accordion) also enjoyed popularity in the Old West, moreso than guitars according to folk singer Peter Bellamy.

Otto Gray, an early cowboy band leader, stated authentic western music had only three rhythms, all coming from the gaits of the cow pony: walk, trot, and lope. Gray also noted the uniqueness of this spontaneous American song product, and the freedom of expression of the singers.

In 1908, N. Howard &quot;Jack&quot; Thorp published the first book of western music, titled &quot;Songs of the Cowboys&quot;. Containing only lyrics and no musical notation, the book was very popular west of the Mississippi River. Most of these cowboy songs are of unknown authorship, but among the best known is &quot;Little Joe the Wrangler&quot; written by Thorp himself.

In 1910, John Lomax, in his book &quot;Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads&quot;, first gained national attention for western music. His book contained some of the same songs as Thorp&#x27;s book, although in variant versions (most had been collected before Thorp&#x27;s book was published). Lomax&#x27;s compilation included many musical scores. Lomax published a second collection in 1919 titled &quot;Songs of the Cattle Trail and Cow Camp&quot;.

The first successful cowboy band to tour the East was Otto Gray&#x27;s Oklahoma Cowboys, put together by William McGinty, an Oklahoma pioneer and former Rough Rider. The band appeared on radio and toured the vaudeville circuit from 1924 through 1936. They recorded few songs, however, so are overlooked by many scholars of western music.

Various musicians recorded western songs in the 1920s and early 1930s, including Carl T. Sprague, John I. White, Jules Verne Allen, Harry McClintock, Tex Owens, and Wilf Carter alias Montana Slim. Many of these early western singers had grown up on ranches and farms or had experience working as cowboys. They typically performed simple arrangements with rustic vocal performances and a simple guitar or fiddle accompaniment.

== Mainstream popularity ==
Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, western music became widely popular through the romanticization of the cowboy and idealized depictions of the west in Hollywood films. Singing cowboys, such as Gene Autry and Roy Rogers, sang cowboy songs in their films and became popular throughout the United States. Film producers began incorporating fully orchestrated four-part harmonies and sophisticated musical arrangements into their motion pictures. Bing Crosby, the most popular singer of that time, recorded numerous cowboy and western songs and starred in the western musical film &quot;Rhythm on the Range&quot; (1936). During this era, the most popular recordings and musical radio shows included western music. Western swing also developed during this time.

== Decline in popularity/1950s–1970s ==
The Western Writers of America was formed in 1953 to promote excellence in western-style writing, including songwriting. In the late 1950s, Frankie Laine recorded TV drama Theme &quot;Rawhide&quot;.

In 1964, the Country &amp; Western Music Academy was formed in an effort to promote western music. The Academy was formed in response to the Nashville-oriented Country Music Association that had formed in 1958. The Academy&#x27;s first awards were largely dominated by Bakersfield-based artists such as Buck Owens. Over time, the Academy evolved into the Academy of Country Music and its mission is no longer distinguished from other country music organizations.

By the 1960s, the popularity of western music was in decline. Though western television series were at an all-time peak in popularity, other than a handful of theme songs, this did not buoy the western music genre as a whole. Popular western recording artists sold fewer albums and attracted smaller audiences. Rock and roll dominated music sales and Hollywood recording studios dropped most of their western artists (a few artists did successfully cross between the two, most prominently Johnny Cash, whose breakthrough hit &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; (1955, live in 1968) combined a western theme with a rock-and-roll arrangement). In addition, the Nashville sound, based more on pop ballads than on folk music, came to dominate the &quot;country and western&quot; commercial sales; except for the label, much of the music was indistinguishable from rock and roll or popular classes of music. Country and western were among many genres whose popularity was drowned out by the British Invasion.

The resulting backlash from western music purists led to the development of country music styles much more influenced by western music, including the Bakersfield sound and outlaw country. The seminal compilation album &quot;Wanted! The Outlaws&quot; carried a Western theme and songs sung by Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, Jennings&#x27;s wife Jessi Colter, and Tompall Glaser, revitalizing the image of western themes in popular music.

== Cowboy pop ==

Authors such as Barry Mazor, Richard Carlin and John T. Davis have used the term cowboy pop to describe the music of cowboy singers in western films. Jimmy Wakely, for example, was described by Mazor as a cowboy pop singer, and he has written that &quot;when singing cowboy movies ruled, Hollywood hardly made a distinction between the sounds of cowboy pop balladeers and another sound entirely, born in Texas, in which Jimmie Rodgers had a formative role.&quot; Several writers have emphasized that historically country music and cowboy music were not considered the same genre; for example, in her essay &quot;Cowboy Songs&quot;, Anne Dingus wrote that &quot;cowboy music is not country music, though the two are often lumped together as &#x27;country and western&#x27;.&quot; In 1910, John Avery Lomax anthologized over a hundred cowboy songs in his collection &quot;Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads&quot;.

== Rediscovery ==
Older western music is widely streamed on major platforms, with music by Marty Robbins and Al Hurricane being more easily accessible. Newer takes on western music are constantly written and recorded and performed all across the American West and Western Canada, thanks to the popularity of New Mexico music within New Mexico and the success of Michael Martin Murphey throughout the western scene, they have resurrected the cowboy song genre, promoting western singers, Route 66 rockabilly, and cowboy poets. The style has even seen a popularity resurgence globally, thanks to the western genre&#x27;s new-found popularity on streaming services and video games.

The Western Music Association was established in 1989 to preserve and promote western music. Western music in video games can be traced back to The Oregon Trail series, early Nintendo title Sheriff/Bandido, and arcade games like Sunset Riders. &quot;&quot; relies on a atmospheric western music style, but it also features old mid-20th century popular western musicians such as Marty Robbins along with pop music of the day. Furthermore, the Red Dead series of games heavily features western music, since it takes place in an Old West setting. Bill Elm and Woody Jackson&#x27;s modern spin on an Old West game would not be complete without their carefully assembled score; what they call their best project to date Independent video games SteamWorld and Gunman Clive also make use of western music, as do other larger productions such as Dillon&#x27;s Rolling Western.

The contributions of Chris LeDoux were also key in the expanded growth of Western music because of his work in the cowboy song genre in the 1990s and early 2000s. LeDoux was a PRCA World Champion in bareback riding who composed songs about personal experiences in the rodeo and ranch cowboy lifestyles. LeDoux exploded in popularity in 1992 when he dueted with country artist Garth Brooks in their Grammy nominated hit, “Whatcha Gonna Do with a Cowboy”. His newfound popularity allowed LeDoux to introduce millions of newcomers to the Western genre, a style of music that had previously existed for many years before him. 

The music of Colter Wall is a part of this revival.

<doc id="1192443" wikidata="Q1211015" url="?curid=1192443" title="Mario Party 6">
<text>is a 2004 party video game developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. It is the sixth installment in the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series, the third title in the series for the GameCube, and the first GameCube game to make use of a microphone add-on. The game was released in Japan on November 18, 2004, in North America on December 6, 2004, in Europe on March 18, 2005, and in Australia on September 15, 2005.

&quot;Mario Party 6&quot; received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for the day-and-night system, game boards, and minigames, but criticism for the microphone feature and its perceived lack of originality.

&quot;Mario Party 6&quot; was succeeded by &quot;Mario Party Advance&quot; for the Game Boy Advance in 2005. The next home console game in the series, &quot;Mario Party 7&quot;, was released for the GameCube the same year.

==Gameplay==


In &quot;Mario Party 6&quot;, up to four players take turns moving on board game-style stages, often playing multiplayer minigames to earn coins and stars. The object of the game is to amass the most coins and stars before completing a set number of turns. This is the first game to take out the coin bonus star, replacing it with the Orb star, which is awarded to the player that used the most Orbs. On multiplayer game boards, the sun will periodically set or rise (every three turns), producing different effects. Changes include spaces moving, different characters appearing, and changes to minigames. This is reflected in two new characters, Brighton and Twila, representing the sun and moon, respectively.

All 10 playable characters from &quot;Mario Party 5&quot; return in this game: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy, Wario, Waluigi, Toad, Yoshi, Koopa Kid, and Boo. Toadette is also playable as a newcomer. There are 82 minigames in total.

In the game&#x27;s frame story, Brighton and Twila, the sun and the moon who watch over the &quot;Mario Party&quot; world, argue over who is more popular. Mario suggests they collect as many Stars as they can to end this.

===Orbs===
Orbs are special items players can either collect on the board or buy with coins at the Orb Hut. They can be used in many ways to give a player an advantage, such as stealing coins from rivals, hampering a rival&#x27;s progress, or quickly obtaining stars. In &quot;Mario Party 5&quot;, these were called capsules. Unlike in &quot;Mario Party 5&quot;, the player does not have to pay to use Orbs on his or herself and may find coins in Orbs. How Orbs are used is determined by the Orb&#x27;s type. These are: Self, Space, Roadblock and Special. Roadblock type Orbs are one-use only and trigger when passed. Space type Orbs transform a space into a character space and only work if a rival lands on the space. If a player stops on their own character space, they gain five coins. Self type Orbs add buffs to the player that used them such as additional Dice Blocks. Special Orbs are used automatically to protect players&#x27; coins or stars from being stolen from Pink Boo and Chain Chomp, occurrences exclusive to certain boards.

===Solo Mode===
Solo Mode is where a single player embarks on a special single-row board with a set number of spaces to collect minigames. The player may also choose a teammate (for 2 vs 2 minigames). Also the player plays minigames with the computer-controlled Red, Green, and Blue Koopa Kids. The dice block for Solo Mode only has the numbers 1–6 on it, unlike Party Mode where the dice blocks have numbers ranging from 1–10. At the end of the board, there is an exclusive rare minigame space, where the player receives a rare minigame without needing to play it. If the player goes past the rare minigame space, they fall off the board and lose all of the minigames they have acquired. To win, the player must land on the rare minigame space, or quit (without getting a rare minigame).

===Minigames===
There are 82 minigames in &quot;Mario Party 6&quot;. No minigames from the previous installments of this series return. New to this edition are mic and rare minigames. In mic minigames, players must say words into the GameCube microphone to perform different actions. The majority of rare games are usually obtained by stopping on the space at the end of Solo Mode, although one is purchased in the Star Bank. The minigames are divided into 4-player, 1-vs.-3, 2-vs.-2, Battle, Duel, DK, Bowser, Mic and Rare.

==Development==
&quot;Mario Party 6&quot; was first announced at E3 2004, though no details were provided aside from the title of the game. Due to &quot;Mario Party 6&quot; and &quot;Mario Party Advance&quot; initially being scheduled for release on the same date, &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Chris Kohler speculated that there could be interconnected gameplay between the titles.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

The game received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. &quot;GameSpot&quot; cited great family and multiplayer fun, but criticized the game for having the same ideas of older &quot;Mario Party&quot; games. &quot;IGN&quot; criticized the game&#x27;s lack of originality and the microphone. In Japan, four critics from &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave the game a total score of 31 out of 40.

Retrospectively, the game has been cited by some critics as one of the best games in the series, citing the day-and-night system as an innovation that sets &quot;Mario Party 6&quot; apart from other games in the series.

During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Mario Party 6&quot; for &quot;Console Children&#x27;s Game of the Year&quot;.

===Sales===
&quot;Mario Party 6&quot; sold 1.63 million copies, making it the worst-selling home console &quot;Mario Party&quot; game and the 15th best-selling game for the GameCube.

<text>Sewanee Natural Bridge in Franklin County, Tennessee, is a high natural sandstone arch with a span of . It is essentially a giant sinkhole partially eroded to form a large stone bridge. A wet weather spring located behind the bridge in a rock cave probably contributed to the erosion forming the arch. It is called the Sewanee Natural Bridge as it was once owned by the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. It is a designated state natural area.

The natural area is accessed via Highway Alt. 41. In Sewanee turn south onto Highway 56 and proceed to Natural Bridge Road. Turn left onto Natural Bridge Road and proceed to the parking area.

<text>James Wallace Cooke (August 23, 1812 – June 21, 1869) was an American naval officer, serving in the United States Navy and during the American Civil War serving in the Confederate Navy.

==Pre-war life==
James Wallace Cooke was born in Beaufort, North Carolina, and was orphaned at the age of 4. In 1828, with the help of his uncle, he was appointed to the United States Navy as a Midshipman. In May 1861, while holding the rank of Lieutenant, he resigned his U.S. commission.

==Civil War service==
At the start of the Civil War in 1861 Cooke joined the Virginia State Navy, and entered the service of the Confederacy in the following June. Later that year he was placed in command of the small gunboat CSS &quot;Ellis&quot;, and was captured with her after a hard fight near Roanoke Island, North Carolina on February 10, 1862. Wounded in that action and soon paroled, he was promoted to commander in June 1862.
Commander Cooke&#x27;s next assignment was to oversee the construction of the ironclad ram CSS &quot;Albemarle&quot;, under construction at &quot;Edward&#x27;s Ferry&quot; near modern-day Scotland Neck, North Carolina, from January 1863. After many difficulties, &quot;Albemarle&quot; was successfully completed in April 1864, and Cooke became her commanding officer. On April 19 and May 5, he took her into action against Federal forces, sinking one gunboat and disabling or driving off others. That June he was promoted to the rank of captain and was later placed in charge of Confederate naval forces on North Carolina&#x27;s internal waters, holding that position until the end of the Civil War in 1865.

==Late life and death==
James W. Cooke died at Portsmouth, Virginia in 1869, and is buried at Cedar Grove Cemetery.

<doc id="1192455" wikidata="Q56569" url="?curid=1192455" title="Agaw languages">
<text>The Agaw or Central Cushitic languages are Afro-Asiatic languages spoken by several groups in Ethiopia and, in one case, Eritrea. They form the main substratum influence on Amharic and other Ethiopian Semitic languages.

==Classification==
The Central Cushitic languages are classified as follows (after Appleyard):

* Awngi (South Agaw) spoken southwest of Lake Tana, much the largest, with over 350,000 speakers
:(Kunfäl, spoken west of Lake Tana, is poorly recorded but most likely a dialect of Awngi)
* Northern Agaw:
:*Bilen–Xamtanga:
::* Bilen (North) spoken (70,000 speakers) in Eritrea around the town of Keren and eastern Sudan around the town of Kassala
::* Xamtanga (Central Agaw; also called Khamir, Khamta) 143,000 speakers in the North Amhara Region
:* Qimant (Western Agaw) nearly extinct, spoken by the Qemant in Semien Gondar Zone
::(dialects Qwara – nearly extinct, spoken by Beta Israel formerly living in Qwara, now in Israel; Kayla – extinct, formerly spoken by some Beta Israel, transitional between Qimant and Xamtanga)

There is a literature in Agaw but it is widely dispersed: from medieval texts containing passages in the Qimant language, now mostly in Israeli museums, to the modern Bilen language with its own newspaper, based in Keren, Eritrea. Historical material is also available in the Xamtanga language, and there is a deep tradition of folklore in the Awngi language.

==Phonology==
Central Cushitic languages are characterised by the presence of , , , and central vowels, while they lack ejectives, implosives, pharyngeals, consonant gemination, vowel length, and the consonant .

<doc id="1192461" wikidata="Q3143733" url="?curid=1192461" title="Hydrogen Jukebox">
<text>Hydrogen Jukebox is a 1990 chamber opera featuring the music of Philip Glass and the work of beat poet Allen Ginsberg. Its name is taken from a phrase coined by Ginsberg, from his 1955 poem Howl.

==History==
Of the project, Glass said:

In 1988...I happened to run into Allen Ginsberg at St. Mark&#x27;s Bookshop in New York City and asked him if he would perform with me. We were in the poetry section, and he grabbed a book from the shelf and pointed out &quot;Wichita Vortex Sutra&quot;. The poem, written in 1966 and reflecting the anti-war mood of the times, seemed highly appropriate for the occasion. I composed a piano piece to accompany Allen&#x27;s reading, which took place at the Schubert Theater on Broadway.

Allen and I so thoroughly enjoyed the collaboration that we soon began talking about expanding our performance into an evening-length music-theater work. It was right after the 1988 presidential election, and neither Bush nor Dukakis seemed to talk about anything that was going on. I remember saying to Allen, if these guys aren&#x27;t going to talk about the issues then we should.
The piece was intended to form a portrait of America covering the 1950s through the late 1980s. Glass and Ginsberg sought to incorporate the personal poems of Ginsberg, reflecting on social issues: the anti-war movement, the sexual revolution, drugs, eastern philosophy, environmental issues. The six vocal parts were thought to represent six archetypal American characters—a waitress, a policeman, a businessman, a cheerleader, a priest, and a mechanic.

Ginsberg said:

Ultimately, the motif of &quot;Hydrogen Jukebox&quot;, the underpinning, the secret message, secret activity, is to relieve human suffering by communicating some kind of enlightened awareness of various themes, topics, obsessions, neuroses, difficulties, problems, perplexities that we encounter as we end the millennium.

The title &quot;Hydrogen Jukebox&quot; comes from a verse in the poem &quot;Howl&quot;: &#x27;...listening to the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox...&#x27; It signifies a state of hypertrophic high-tech, a psychological state in which people are at the limit of their sensory input with civilization&#x27;s military jukebox, a loud industrial roar, or a music that begins to shake the bones and penetrate the nervous system as a hydrogen bomb may do someday, reminder of apocalypse.
The work formally premiered May 26, 1990 at the Spoleto Music Festival in Charleston, SC. However, the workshop staged version had premiered one month earlier at the American Music Theater Festival held in the Plays and Players theater, 1714 Delancey Place, Philadelphia, PA on April 26. It ran there until May 6, followed on that closing night by an invitation-only reception attended by Philip Glass and Allen Ginsberg and other members of the company was held nearby.

The Australasian premiere was given on April 17, 2003 at the Mount Nelson Theatre (Hobart, Tasmania) by the Tasmanian Conservatorium of Music, conducted by Douglas Knehans and directed by Robert Jarman.

== In popular culture ==
Stephen Colbert met his wife, Evelyn McGee-Colbert, at the premiere of &quot;Hydrogen Jukebox&quot; at the Spoleto Music Festival in 1990. While interviewing Josh Brolin during an episode of the Late Show with Stephen Colbert originally telecast April 15, 2022, Colbert admitted that when Evelyn asked for his address, he didn&#x27;t have a pen, so he borrowed one from the person behind him, which happened to be Ginsberg.

Hydrogen Jukebox is a Detroit rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll band formed in 2019.

<text>Grady Tate (January 14, 1932 – October 8, 2017) was an American jazz and soul-jazz drummer and baritone vocalist. In addition to his work as sideman, Tate released many albums as leader and lent his voice to songs in the animated &quot;Schoolhouse Rock!&quot; series. He received two Grammy nominations.

==Biography==
Tate was born in Hayti, Durham, North Carolina, United States. In 1963 he moved to New York City, where he became the drummer in Quincy Jones&#x27;s band.

Grady Tate&#x27;s drumming helped to define a particular hard bop, soul jazz and organ trio sound during the mid-1960s and beyond. His slick, layered and intense sound is instantly recognizable for its understated style in which he integrates his trademark subtle nuances with sharp, crisp &quot;on top of the beat&quot; timing (in comparison to playing slightly before, or slightly after the beat).
The Grady Tate sound can be heard prominently on many of the classic Jimmy Smith and Wes Montgomery albums recorded on the Verve label in the 1960s.

During the 1970s, Tate was a member of the New York Jazz Quartet. In 1981, he played drums and percussion for Simon and Garfunkel&#x27;s Concert in Central Park.

As a sideman, Tate played with musicians including Jimmy Smith, Astrud Gilberto, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, Quincy Jones, Stan Getz, Cal Tjader, Wes Montgomery, Eddie Harris, J.J. Johnson, Kai Winding and Michel Legrand.

Among his most widely heard vocal performances are the songs &quot;I Got Six&quot;, &quot;Naughty Number Nine&quot;, and &quot;Fireworks&quot; from &quot;Multiplication Rock&quot; and &quot;America Rock&quot;, both part of the &quot;Schoolhouse Rock&quot; series. For the 1973 motion picture &quot;Cops And Robbers&quot;, Tate sang the title song, written by Michel Legrand and Jacques Wilson. On Mark Murphy&#x27;s album &quot;Living Room&quot;, Tate shares the vocals on a medley of &quot;Misty&quot; and &quot;Midnight Sun&quot;. On the album &quot;Threesome&quot;, with Monty Alexander and Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, Tate sings words to Miles Davis&#x27;s composition &quot;All Blues&quot;, aggregated from a number of well-known and standard blues songs as well as to the jazz standard &quot;Weaver of Dreams&quot; (written by Victor Young).

He joined the faculty of Howard University in 1989.

Grady Tate died of complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on October 8, 2017, at the age of 85. He was survived by his wife Vivian and son Grady, Jr.

<text>Liam Paul Paris Howlett (born 21 August 1971) is an English record producer, musician, DJ, songwriter, co-founder and leader of the British electronic band The Prodigy.

==Early years==
Liam Paul Paris Howlett was born on 21 August 1971 in Braintree, Essex, England. Howlett was trained in classical piano (from childhood). At the age of 14, he mixed songs recorded from the radio using the pause button on his cassette player. He was first influenced by hip hop music and culture when he began to attend school at Alec Hunter High School in Braintree. He learned breakdancing alongside his crew called the Pure City Breakers, and DJed in his first band Cut 2 Kill. After a fight at a gig in support of the band, Liam left Cut 2 Kill and started to write his own music.

He went to his first rave in 1989.

==Music career==
===The Prodigy===

Howlett formed The Prodigy in 1990.

===Other musical projects===
In 1998, Howlett was offered the chance to do a mix for Mary Anne Hobbs&#x27; radio show. He dug out some of his old favourite tracks again and this prompted him to release an edited (due to some copyright issues) version of the mix in February 1999. It was the first material which was recorded in his new home studio &quot;The Dirtchamber&quot;, so accordingly the album was to be called &quot;Prodigy present The Dirtchamber Sessions Volume One&quot;.

In 1999, Howlett composed music for the film &quot;The Uranus Experiment&quot;. Described as an &quot;anal space opera&quot;, the film featured the first sex scene shot in microgravity.

At the end of January 2006, a compilation album titled &quot;Back to Mine: Liam Prodigy&quot; was released. It was a collection of Howlett&#x27;s favourite tunes, including an exclusive Prodigy track called &quot;Wake the Fuck Up&quot;, which was often performed as an intro in the Prodigy&#x27;s live concerts.

Howlett was a co-producer on the track &quot;Immunize&quot; from Australian drum and bass act Pendulum&#x27;s third album &quot;Immersion&quot;, which was released in 2010.

In 2012, Howlett co-produced the first single &quot;We Hate Everyone&quot; from K.Flay&#x27;s EP &quot;Eyes Shut&quot;. He also produced the song ‘Stop, Focus’ from the same EP.

On March 30, 2022, it was announced that Howlett would compose the musical score for the Netflix&#x27;s movie &quot;Choose or Die&quot;.

==Personal life==
Howlett has been married to Natalie Appleton of All Saints since 2002. They have a son, Ace Billy Howlett, born in 2004, and live in Hampstead, London.

He appeared regularly on the West End stage and in fringe theatre. He also appeared at Edinburgh with Tom Courtenay in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and made numerous appearances at Hampstead between the late 1960s and the 1980s. He appeared in musicals and pantomime, including &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot; with Harry Secombe at Drury Lane, &quot;Dick Whittington&quot; with Ken Dodd at the Palace Theatre, Manchester, and &quot;Roll on Four O&#x27;Clock&quot; for Colin Welland at Wythenshawe (which transferred to the Palace, Shaftesbury Avenue).

He joined the National Theatre Company to appear as the father in &quot;Equus&quot;; and won an award for his portrayal of the father in &quot;Spring and Port Wine&quot; for Middle Ground Theatre Company.

==Personal life==
Owen was married twice. His first marriage, in 1965 and later dissolved, was to the actress Patricia Mort (1933–1999), with whom he had two children, both actors Lloyd Owen (born 1966) and Cathy Owen (born 1968). His second marriage was to former dancer Carrie Clifton in 2001.

On 4 October 1917, during the Battle of Passchendaele at Tower Hamlets Spur, east of Ypres, Belgium, Sage was in a shell-hole with eight other soldiers. Amidst heavy enemy fire, one of his comrades was shot while attempting to throw a grenade, causing it to fall back into their position. Sage threw himself onto the live grenade, absorbing the explosion and saving the lives of his fellow soldiers, though he sustained severe injuries.

Because of the severity of his wounds, it was believed that Sage would be unable to return to British lines. He was left with a revolver and advised not to allow himself to be captured. Despite his critical condition, he managed to survive and was later awarded the Victoria Cross for conspicuous bravery.

== Later life and death ==
After being discharged from the army on 24 May 1918, Sage returned to Tiverton. Despite his wounds, which included the loss of his right eye and multiple shrapnel fragments remaining in his body, Sage resumed civilian life. He lived with his wife and their children. Sage’s health remained compromised due to his wartime injuries, and he endured a prolonged illness before passing away on 20 July 1945 at the age of 62. He was buried in Tiverton Cemetery.

<text>Sir Arthur Sackville Trevor Griffith-Boscawen PC (18 October 1865 – 1 June 1946) was a British politician in the Conservative Party whose career was cut short by losing a string of Parliamentary elections.

==Biography==
Sir Arthur was born at Trevalyn Hall, Denbighshire, into a distinguished family of Welsh, Cornish, and Scottish lineage. He had an elder brother, Boscawen Trevor, and two sisters, Helen Evelyn Trevor (who married Brig.-Gen. Hugh Archdale) and Alice Catherine Trevor. His mother, Helen Sophia Duff (1834–1930), was the eldest daughter of Admiral Norwich Duff. Her grandfather George Duff was killed at the Battle of Trafalgar. His father, Captain Boscawen Trevor Griffith, served with the 23rd Welsh Fusiliers and saw action during the Crimean War; he was also chairman of the Denbighshire Court of Quarter Sessions for many years. The captain was the only son of Thomas Griffith and his second wife, Elizabeth Mary Boscawen, the daughter of Lt.-Gen. Hon. George Boscawen, who was the fourth son of Viscount Falmouth. In 1875, the family assumed the additional surname of Boscawen when Elizabeth died.

Sir Arthur was educated at Rugby School and Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford.

In 1892, he was elected Member of Parliament for Tonbridge in Kent, a county for which he became JP in 1896. Salisbury, whom he accused of ignoring 90% of MPs, appointed him private secretary to Chancellor of the Exchequer Michael Hicks-Beach in 1895, a job he held before becoming Parliamentary Charity Commissioner in 1900, serving until 1905. Griffith-Boscawen may have been influential in helping to choose Alfred Milner as the new Governor of Cape Colony. The aged Lord Rosmead was retiring, leaving the government, and Chamberlain in particular desperate to find a replacement. The choice of Milner, a brilliant Oxford scholar, was universally acclaimed in parliament as a shrewd option; the candidate was warmly praised for his courage in coming forward during the Jameson Raid crisis.

Griffith-Boscawen lost his Tonbridge seat in the 1906 general election. He unsuccessfully contested East Denbighshire at a by-election in August that year, and Dudley, Worcestershire at the first general election held in 1910, before being returned for the latter seat later that year. He also sat as a member of the London County Council from 1910 to 1913; he was knighted in 1911.

Griffith-Boscawen had a special interest in working class housing throughout his career. He was a Tariff Reformer who admired Joseph Chamberlain because he became a very influential Conservative even though he was not from an aristocratic background. He carved out a niche for himself as a parliamentary Churchman and strongly opposed moves to disestablish the Welsh Church; following its disestablishment and the end of his parliamentary career, he chaired the Welsh Church Commissioners from 1923 to 1945.

Griffith-Boscawen was commissioned into the part-time 3rd (West Kent Militia) Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Own (Royal West Kent Regiment), with which he saw embodied service in Malta during the time of the Second Boer War in 1899–1900. The battalion later became the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion, Queen&#x27;s Own (Royal West Kent Regiment) in the Special Reserve, and he commanded it as Lieutenant-Colonel from 1910. He was mobilised with the battalion at the outbreak of World War I, later commanding a garrison battalion of the Hampshire Regiment at Saint-Omer in France from 1914 to 1916, for which he was mentioned in dispatches.

He was recalled to become Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Pensions in December 1916, then served as Parliamentary Under Secretary of the Board of Agriculture from 1918 to 1921. He was appointed to the Privy Council in the 1920 New Year Honours, entitling him to the style &quot;The Right Honourable&quot;.

In 1921, he was appointed to the Lloyd George Coalition Government as Minister of Agriculture but under the law at the time he was required to automatically stand for re-election to the House of Commons. Griffith-Boscawen lost the ensuing by-election, in part because of Lord Beaverbrook&#x27;s Canadian Cattle campaign, but another seat was found for him at a by-election in Taunton and he continued his career in government. Five years later the law on ministerial appointments would be amended to end the requirement for such by-elections.
When Lloyd George&#x27;s government fell in October 1922, Griffith-Boscawen was one of only a few members of the outgoing Cabinet who agreed to serve under the new Prime Minister, Bonar Law, who promoted him to Minister of Health. The following month a general election was held and Griffith-Boscawen once more lost his Taunton seat. He remained in government and set about producing a bill on local government rating which provoked fierce controversy in the country at large. In March 1923 he sought to re-enter the House of Commons in a by-election at Mitcham, but was defeated by the future Labour Cabinet Minister, James Chuter Ede. Griffith-Boscawen was forced to retire from politics as a result. The resulting vacancy in the Cabinet was filled by Neville Chamberlain.

Griffith-Boscawen wrote &quot;Fourteen Years in Parliament&quot; in 1907 and his &quot;Memoirs&quot; in 1925. In later life he resided at Pangbourne, Berkshire, and died in London in June 1946 aged 80.

<doc id="1192486" wikidata="Q241797" url="?curid=1192486" title="Natalya Naryshkina">
<text>Natalya Kirillovna Naryshkina (; 1 September 1651 – 4 February 1694) was the Tsaritsa of Russia from 1671–1676 as the second spouse of Tsar Alexis I of Russia, and regent of Russia as the mother of Tsar Peter I of Russia (Peter the Great) twice. She first became Regent during the minority of her son Peter 7 May 1682, being deposed as regent by her daughter-in-law Sophia in 15 May 1682. After the deposition of Sophia in August 1689, Natalya Naryshkina was reinstated as regent. Her second regency lasted until her death in February 1694. 

==Life==
Coming from a Russian noble family of Tatar descent, daughter of Kirill Poluektovich Naryshkin (1623–1691), and wife Anna Leontyevna Leontyeva (d. 1706, daughter of Leonty Dimitriyevich Leontyev and spouse Praskovya Ivanovna Rayevskaya who died in 1641), she was brought up in the house of the great Western-leaning boyar Artamon Matveyev. She was given a freer and more Western-influenced upbringing than most Russian women of the time.

===Tsaritsa===
In March 1669, Tsar Alexis Mikhailovich&#x27;s first wife, Tsarina Maria Miloslavskaya, died during the birth of what would have been her fourteenth child. Despite their number, few of Alexis and Maria&#x27;s children were healthy. Within six months of her death there were only two surviving sons, Feodor and Ivan, both of whom were weak or disabled. Alexis, supported by the Russian public, although not by the family of Maria, decided to remarry in the hope of producing more potential heirs. The tsar arranged an inspection of women he considered eligible in early 1670, Natalya was added to this inspection following an encounter with the tsar at the home of her adoptive father, Artamon Matveyev. Alexis was impressed by Natalya&#x27;s beauty, and selected her to be his bride without needing to go ahead with a planned second inspection. Maria&#x27;s family made an attempt to halt the marriage by alleging that Matveyev had used magic herbs on Alexis to deceive him regarding Natalya&#x27;s beauty. These claims were investigated but eventually dismissed, and the couple married on 1 February 1671.

Alexis and Natalya had a happy marriage, spending much of their time together in various palaces and villas around Moscow. The couple&#x27;s first child, the future emperor Peter the Great, was born in May 1672, followed by daughters Natalya and Theodora. The custom at that time was for the consort of the Tsar to maintain a low-key lifestyle, deferring in all matters to her husband and carrying out work in the household. Natalya, having been raised in a liberal western-inspired household, resented this and succeeded in gradually attaining more freedoms throughout her time as Tsaritsa, such as being allowed to ride in an open carriage and appearing in church without a veil. She loved dancing and visited diplomatic events, also she became the first woman to visit a theatre play. 

She became widowed in 1676; a son from the Tsar&#x27;s previous marriage ascended the throne as Feodor III. Feodor and his brother Ivan treated their stepmother with affection, always referring to her as &quot;Mama&quot;.

===First Regency of Natalya===
When Feodor died in 1682, her 10-year-old son became tsar. She became regent, with her foster father Artamon Matveyev who was called back from exile, as advisor. 

During the revolt of the Streltsy on 15 May 1682, two of her brothers and Matveyev were killed and her biological father Kyril Naryshkin was forced to become a monk in a monastery. 

Feodor&#x27;s elder sister, Sofia Alekseyevna, replaced her as regent.

===Regency of Sophia===
With Sophia as regent for Natalya&#x27;s son and her half-brother, Peter, who was co-tsar with Ivan, Natalya lived in relative poverty, receiving financial support from the Patriarch or others in the Orthodox Church. Natalya spent her time mainly in Alexis&#x27;s summer palace in Preobrazhenskoe, about 5 km from Moscow, together with Peter.

===Second Regency of Natalya===
In August 1689, Peter overthrew Sophia, and he and his half-brother Ivan continued to be co-tsars. Natalya was reinstated as regent and leader of the regency of Peter in the court. Her brother, Lev Naryshkin, was appointed minister of foreign affairs and a &quot;de facto&quot; prime minister.

Boris Kurakin said about the second regency government of Natalya Naryshkina:
:&quot;This Princess was of good temperament and virtious, but neither dutiful nor skillful in business nor was she of a easy mind. Because of this reason she left the rule of state in the hands of her brother, the boyar Lev Naryshkin, and other ministers... This regency of queen Natalya Kirillovna was very dishonest, and the people was discontent and insulted. During this time there begun an injust rule from the judges, and big bribes and theft from the state treasury, who continues multiplied to this day, and it is difficult to eradicate this plague&quot;.

When the Patriarch Joachim died in 1690, Peter wanted to appoint Marcellus, Bishop of Pskov, who had travelled overseas and spoke several languages, as the new patriarch. However, Natalya led the conservative faction in the court to nominate the conservative Adrian, Bishop of Kazan, to head the Russian Orthodox Church. Peter always treated his mother with great respect and deferred to her, which is evident from their preserved letters. He did not interfer in state affairs much as long as his mother was still alive. 

Natalya Naryshkina died in a heart failure in 1694. After her death, Peter finally took full control of the government.

The naming convention for the domestic dioceses, for the most part, is after the state in which they are located or a portion of that state (for example, Northern Michigan or West Texas).

Usually (though not always), in a state where there is more than one diocese, the area where the Episcopal Church (or Church of England before the American Revolution) started in that state is the diocese that bears the name of that state. For example, the Church of England&#x27;s first outpost in what is now Georgia was in Savannah, hence the Diocese of Georgia is based in Savannah.

There are, however, many dioceses named for their see city or another city in the diocese. A few are named for a river, island, valley or other geographical feature. The list below includes the see city in parentheses if different from the name of the diocese or unclear from its name.

The see city usually has a cathedral, often the oldest parish in that city, but some dioceses do not have a cathedral. The dioceses of Iowa and Minnesota each have two cathedrals. Occasionally the diocesan offices and the cathedral are in separate cities.

===Provinces===
The dioceses are grouped into nine provinces, the first eight of which, for the most part, correspond to regions of the U.S. Province IX is composed of dioceses in Latin America. Province II and Province VIII also include dioceses outside of the U.S.

Unlike in many churches of the Anglican Communion, in which provinces are helmed by a primate or presiding bishop from the clergy, provinces of TEC are led by lay executive directors or presidents. Decisions are made at each province&#x27;s Synod of the Province, consisting of a House of Bishops and House of Deputies. Lay and clergy Deputies are elected, two from each diocese.

Provinces of TEC are not to be confused with provinces of the Anglican Communion, as TEC itself is one such province of the Communion.

<text>Locksley Wellington Hampton (April 21, 1932 – November 18, 2021) was an American jazz trombonist, composer and arranger. As his nickname implies, Hampton&#x27;s main instrument was slide trombone, but he also occasionally played tuba and flugelhorn.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Locksley Wellington Hampton was born on April 21, 1932, in Jeannette, Pennsylvania. Laura and Clarke &quot;Deacon&quot; Hampton raised 12 children, taught them how to play musical instruments and set out with them as a family band. The family first came to Indianapolis in 1938. The Hamptons were a very musical family in which mother, father, eight brothers, and four sisters, all played instruments. His sisters included Dawn Hampton and Virtue Hampton Whitted. Slide Hampton is one of the few left-handed trombone players. As a child, Hampton was given the trombone set up to play left-handed, or backwards; and as no one ever dissuaded him, he continued to play this way.

At the age of 12, Slide played in his family&#x27;s Indianapolis jazz band, The Duke Hampton Band. By 1952, at the age of 20, he was performing at Carnegie Hall with the Lionel Hampton Band. He played with the Buddy Johnson&#x27;s R&amp;B band from 1955 to 1956, then became a member of Maynard Ferguson&#x27;s band (1957–1959), where he played and arranged, providing excitement on such popular tunes as &quot;The Fugue,&quot; &quot;Three Little Foxes&quot; and &quot;Slide&#x27;s Derangement.&quot; While with the Ferguson band he composed and arranged memorable charts such as &quot;Frame For the Blues,&quot; &quot;Go East Young Man,&quot; &quot;Newport,&quot; Sometimes I Feel Lika A Motherless Child,&quot; &quot;Ole&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Round Midnight.&quot; In 1958, he recorded with trombone masters on the classic release of Melba Liston, &quot;Melba Liston and Her &#x27;Bones&quot;. As his reputation grew, he soon began working with bands led by Art Blakey, Tadd Dameron, Barry Harris, Thad Jones, Mel Lewis, and Max Roach, contributing both original compositions and arrangements. In 1962, he formed the Slide Hampton Octet, with horn players Freddie Hubbard, and George Coleman. The band toured the U.S. and Europe and recorded on several labels.

===From 1968===
In 1968, he toured with Woody Herman&#x27;s orchestra, settling in Europe where he remained until 1977. He taught at Harvard, artist-in-residence in 1981, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, De Paul University, and Indiana State University. During this period he led World of Trombones, his own nine-trombone, three-rhythm band; co-led Continuum, a quintet with Jimmy Heath that plays the music of Tadd Dameron; and freelanced as a writer and a player. He also played the trombone in &quot;Diana Ross Live! The Lady Sings... Jazz &amp; Blues: Stolen Moments&quot; (1992), DVD.

On June 4, 2006, Hampton and long time manager and writing partner Anthony-charles:Bey promoted his first self funded concert at The Tribeca PAC in New York City (a tribute to Antonio Carlos Jobim) and debuted the Slide Hampton™ Ultra-Big Band. The concert was the first of many planned for the near future.

In 2009, Hampton completed four new compositions collectively titled &quot;A Tribute to African-American Greatness&quot;. The songs honored Nelson Mandela, Oprah Winfrey, Tiger Woods, Venus Williams, Serena Williams and Barack Obama. The songs contained accompanying lyrics written by Hampton and manager/writing partner Anthony-charles:Bey, arrangements honoring Thelonious Monk, Thad Jones, Eddie Harris, Dexter Gordon and Gil Evans round out the program. He completed two new Big Band arrangements – &quot;In Case of Emergency&quot; and &quot;The Drum Song&quot; (both Hampton originals). These two songs (and others) will be available exclusively to universities and other educational institutions through Slide Hampton™ Musique/Music Publishing-in-trust.

Hampton was a resident of Orange, New Jersey. He died on November 18, 2021, at the age of 89.

==Awards and honors==
In 1998, he won a Grammy Award for &quot;Best Jazz Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)&quot;, as arranger for &quot;Cotton Tail&quot; performed by Dee Dee Bridgewater. He was also a Grammy winner in 2005 for &quot;Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album,&quot; &quot;The Way: Music of Slide Hampton&quot;, The Vanguard Jazz Orchestra (Planet Arts), and received another nomination in 2006 for his arrangement of &quot;Stardust&quot; for the Dizzy Gillespie All-Star Big Band.

In 2005 Hampton was honored at the jazz festival in Indianapolis. There the Indianapolis Jazz Foundation inducted him into their Hall of Fame.

In 2005, the National Endowment for the Arts honored Slide Hampton with its highest honor in jazz, the NEA Jazz Masters Award.

<text>Saint Tudwal (died c. 564), also known as Tual, Tudgual, Tugdual, Tugual, Pabu, Papu, or Tugdualus (Latin), was a Breton monk, considered to be one of the seven founder saints of Brittany.

==Life==
Tudwal was said to be the son of Hoel Mawr (Hoel I) and his wife, Pompeia, and a brother of Saint Leonorus. Tudwal travelled to Ireland to learn the scriptures, and then became a hermit on Saint Tudwal&#x27;s Island East, off the coast of North Wales. Tudwal later immigrated to Brittany, settling in Lan Pabu with 72 followers, where he established a large monastery under the patronage of his cousin, King Deroch of Domnonée. He traveled to Paris to obtain confirmation of the land grant from King Childebert I, who insisted he be Bishop of Tréguier.

Tudwal is shown in iconography as a bishop holding a dragon, now the symbol of Tregor. His feast day is celebrated on 1 December. 

Tro Breizh (Breton for &quot;Tour of Brittany&quot;) is a pilgrimage that links the towns of the seven founding saints of Brittany. These seven saints were Celtic monks from Britain from around the 5th or 6th century who went to Brittany to minister to the Britons who had settled there after the Anglo-Saxon incursions in their homeland. Among the first bishoprics was Tréguier, Saint Tudwal&#x27;s town.

==Notable namesake==
* Tugdual Menon
Joseph Tidwell. 15th century monk of the Franciscan order. Noted for being a shepherd and roving the coastline to help travellers stranded by shifting sands. Despite his vows, it is implied in local burial records that he fathered 9 children from 4 different women including his cousin Mary

<text>Nereocystis (Greek, &#x27;mermaid&#x27;s bladder&#x27;) is a monotypic genus of subtidal kelp containing the species Nereocystis luetkeana. Some English names include edible kelp, bull kelp, bullwhip kelp, ribbon kelp, bladder wrack, and variations of these names. Due to the English name, bull kelp can be confused with southern bull kelps, which are found in the Southern Hemisphere. &quot;Nereocystis luetkeana&quot; forms thick beds on subtidal rocks, and is an important part of kelp forests.

==Etymology==
The species &quot;Nereocystis luetkeana&quot; was named (as &quot;Fucus luetkeanus&quot;) after the German-Russian explorer Fyodor Petrovich Litke (also spelled Lütke) by Mertens. The species was renamed in a description by Postels and Ruprecht.

==Description==

&quot;Nereocystis&quot; is a brown macroalgae that derives chemical energy from photosynthesis. &quot;Nereocystis&quot; in particular, similar to &quot;Pelagophycus porra&quot;, can be identified by a single large pneumatocyst between the end of its hollow stipe and the blades. Individuals can grow to a maximum of . &quot;Nereocystis&quot; has a holdfast of about , and a single stipe, topped with a pneumatocyst containing carbon monoxide, from which sprout the numerous (about 30-64) blades. The blades may be up to long, and up to wide. It is usually annual, sometimes persisting up to 18 months. &quot;Nereocystis&quot; is the only kelp which will drop spore patches, so that the right concentration of spores lands near the parent&#x27;s holdfast.

The thallus of this common canopy-forming kelp has a richly branched holdfast (haptera) and a cylindrical stipe 10–36 m (33–118 ft) long. The stipe terminates in a single, gas-filled pneumatocyst from which many blades grow. Each blade can grow up to 10 m (33 ft) long, and blade growth can reach 15 cm (5.9 in) per day.

&quot;Nereocystis&quot; grows in areas where &quot;Pterygophora&quot; &quot;californica&quot; also inhabits. Bull kelp will often grow on the stipe of &quot;Pterygophora&quot;, with up anywhere from 10 to 20 individuals of &quot;Nereocystis&quot; attaching to a single &quot;Pterygophora&quot; stipe.

=== Reproduction ===
Reproduction in &quot;Nereocystis&quot; is characterized by an alternation of generations. The diploid generation is the recognizable macroscopic sporophyte. During sexual reproduction, reproductive patches (sori) develop on the blades of the sporophyte and drop to the seafloor at maturity. The sori release haploid spores, which become the microscopic gametophytes. The gametophytes produce gametes, and if fertilization occurs, a new sporophyte organism may develop and begin to grow up from the seafloor.

==Distribution==
The species is common along the Pacific Coast of North America, from Southern California to the Aleutian Islands, Alaska. However, drift individuals disperse with ocean currents further south into northwest Baja California, Mexico. Offshore beds can persist for one or many years, usually in deeper water than &quot;Eualaria&quot; or &quot;Macrocystis&quot;, where they co-occur.

This annual kelp grows on rock from the low intertidal to subtidal zones; it prefers semi-exposed habitats or high-current areas. It also does not grow in areas with breaking waves or swells. Its distribution is limited by the requirement of light for photosynthesis, and preference for areas of high water movement where the microscopic gametophyte stage will not be covered by sediment.

Other factors such as salinity, turbidity and water temperature can affect &quot;Nereocystis&quot; distribution. &quot;Nereocystis&quot; tends to thrive in temperatures ranging from 5 to 20 degrees Celsius. It is rarely found in environments with high turbidity and low salinity. &quot;Nereocystis&quot; fails to thrive in areas of reduced salinity, such as brackish estuarine waters, because it has difficulty adjusting to changes in salinity. The increased turbidity of such waters also decreases light available for photosynthesis, limiting its growth. Additionally, disease, competition, and herbivory can affect distribution.

== Ecology ==
&quot;Nereocystis&quot;, like other large, canopy forming kelps, play a crucial role in maintaining the biologically diverse kelp forests in the temperate marine environments where they flourish. Its fast growth and size provide an important habitat not only for the fish and invertebrates that reside in kelp forests, but also for species that use kelp forests as foraging grounds. In bull kelp forests, kelp crabs are important grazers that control the ecosystem by feeding on large canopy kelps such as &quot;Nereocystis&quot;.

=== Microbial communities ===
&quot;Nereocystis&quot; fosters microbacteria species, affecting the ecology on a microscopic level. These microbial bacteria species foster the growth of seaweed, producing growth-promoting substances. According to studies by Weigel, the microbial communities that grow on &quot;Nereocystis&quot; are composed mostly of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Planctomycetes. &quot;Nereocystis&quot; is unique in that it contains a large percentage of Verrucomicrobia, with it composing approximately 10% of microbacteria populations on &quot;Nereocystis&quot;.

=== Human effects ===
Abalone mariculture (the commercial farming and harvest of abalone) and an increasing demand in human consumption have led to a notable and marked increase in &quot;Nereocystis&quot; extraction. This extraction is done by hand and removes the top two meters of the forest. These first two meters contain bull kelp&#x27;s pneumatocysts and its reproductive organs, so this method of extraction destroys kelp forests that depend on &quot;Nereocystis&quot;. Since bull kelp tend to only reproduce once a year, removal of these organs renders &quot;Nereocystis&quot; unable to reproduce. The tissues of bull kelp are processed and turned into liquid fertilizer as well as food for abalones.

== Human uses ==
&quot;Nereocystis&quot; was not commercially harvested off the coast of California until around the 1980s. The beginning of this harvest is attributed to the Abalone International company, which was seeking mariculture expansion and efficiency. Kelp harvesters are legally mandated to record every aspect of their harvest, including but not limited to the amount of kelp, the species, and the location where it was taken from. Kelp is currently harvested from the Californian coast, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, and Alaska.

Human uses of &quot;Nereocystis&quot; include consumption and agriculture. It is pickled and eaten as a delicacy as well as used for creative purposes. In South Korea, &quot;Nereocystis&quot; used to make &quot;miyeok-guk&quot; (Korean kelp soup) weekly by new mothers as it&#x27;s revered as a blood-cleanser. It is also customary to eat it on one&#x27;s birthday.

<text>Linear electronic oscillator circuits, which generate a sinusoidal output signal, are composed of an amplifier and a frequency selective element, a filter. A linear oscillator circuit which uses an RC network, a combination of resistors and capacitors, for its frequency selective part is called an RC oscillator.

==Description==
RC oscillators are a type of feedback oscillator; they consist of an amplifying device, a transistor, vacuum tube, or op-amp, with some of its output energy fed back into its input through a network of resistors and capacitors, an RC network, to achieve positive feedback, causing it to generate an oscillating sinusoidal voltage. They are used to produce lower frequencies, mostly audio frequencies, in such applications as audio signal generators and electronic musical instruments. At radio frequencies, another type of feedback oscillator, the LC oscillator is used, but at frequencies below 100 kHz the size of the inductors and capacitors needed for the LC oscillator become cumbersome, and RC oscillators are used instead. Their lack of bulky inductors also makes them easier to integrate into microelectronic devices. Since the oscillator&#x27;s frequency is determined by the value of resistors and capacitors, which vary with temperature, RC oscillators do not have as good frequency stability as crystal oscillators.

The frequency of oscillation is determined by the Barkhausen criterion, which says that the circuit will only oscillate at frequencies for which the phase shift around the feedback loop is equal to 360° (2π radians) or a multiple of 360°, and the loop gain (the amplification around the feedback loop) is equal to one. The purpose of the feedback RC network is to provide the correct phase shift at the desired oscillating frequency so the loop has 360° phase shift, so the sine wave, after passing through the loop will be in phase with the sine wave at the beginning and reinforce it, resulting in positive feedback. The amplifier provides gain to compensate for the energy lost as the signal passes through the feedback network, to create sustained oscillations. As long as the gain of the amplifier is high enough that the total gain around the loop is unity or higher, the circuit will generally oscillate.

In RC oscillator circuits which use a single inverting amplifying device, such as a transistor, tube, or an op amp with the feedback applied to the inverting input, the amplifier provides 180° of the phase shift, so the RC network must provide the other 180°. Since each capacitor can provide a maximum of 90° of phase shift, RC oscillators require at least two frequency-determining capacitors in the circuit (two poles), and most have three or more, with a comparable number of resistors.

This makes tuning the circuit to different frequencies more difficult than in other types such as the LC oscillator, in which the frequency is determined by a single LC circuit so only one element must be varied. Although the frequency can be varied over a small range by adjusting a single circuit element, to tune an RC oscillator over a wide range two or more resistors or capacitors must be varied in unison, requiring them to be &quot;ganged&quot; together mechanically on the same shaft. The oscillation frequency is proportional to the inverse of the capacitance or resistance, whereas in an LC oscillator the frequency is proportional to inverse square root of the capacitance or inductance. So a much wider frequency range can be covered by a given variable capacitor in an RC oscillator. For example, a variable capacitor that could be varied over a 9:1 capacitance range will give an RC oscillator a 9:1 frequency range, but in an LC oscillator it will give only a 3:1 range.

Some examples of common RC oscillator circuits are listed below:

===Phase-shift oscillator===

In the phase-shift oscillator the feedback network is three identical cascaded RC sections. In the simplest design the capacitors and resistors in each section have the same value formula_1 and formula_2. Then at the oscillation frequency each RC section contributes 60° phase shift for a total of 180°. The oscillation frequency is
:formula_3
The feedback network has an attenuation of 1/29, so the op-amp must have a gain of 29 to give a loop gain of one for the circuit to oscillate 
:formula_4


===Twin-T oscillator===
Another common design is the &quot;Twin-T&quot; oscillator as it uses two &quot;T&quot; RC circuits operated in parallel. One circuit is an R-C-R &quot;T&quot; which acts as a low-pass filter. The second circuit is a C-R-C &quot;T&quot; which operates as a high-pass filter. Together, these circuits form a bridge which is tuned at the desired frequency of oscillation. The signal in the C-R-C branch of the Twin-T filter is advanced, in the R-C-R - delayed, so they may cancel one another for frequency formula_5 if formula_6; if it is connected as a negative feedback to an amplifier, and x&gt;2, the amplifier becomes an oscillator. (Note: formula_7.)

===Quadrature oscillator===
The quadrature oscillator uses two cascaded op-amp integrators in a feedback loop, one with the signal applied to the inverting input or two integrators and an invertor. The advantage of this circuit is that the sinusoidal outputs of the two op-amps are 90° out of phase (in quadrature). This is useful in some communication circuits.

It is possible to stabilize a quadrature oscillator by squaring the sine and cosine outputs, adding them together, (Pythagorean trigonometric identity) subtracting a constant, and applying the difference to a multiplier that adjusts the loop gain around an inverter. Such circuits have a near-instant amplitude response to the constant input and extremely low distortion.

==Low distortion oscillators==
The Barkhausen criterion mentioned above does not determine the amplitude of oscillation. An oscillator circuit with only &quot;linear&quot; components is unstable with respect to amplitude. As long as the loop gain is exactly one, the amplitude of the sine wave would be constant, but the slightest increase in gain, due to a drift in the value of components will cause the amplitude to increase exponentially without limit. Similarly, the slightest decrease will cause the sine wave to die out exponentially to zero. Therefore, all practical oscillators must have a nonlinear component in the feedback loop, to reduce the gain as the amplitude increases, leading to stable operation at the amplitude where the loop gain is unity.

In most ordinary oscillators, the nonlinearity is simply the saturation (clipping) of the amplifier as the amplitude of the sine wave approaches the power supply rails. The oscillator is designed to have a small-signal loop gain greater than one. The higher gain allows an oscillator to start by exponentially amplifying some ever-present noise.

As the peaks of the sine wave approach the supply rails, the saturation of the amplifier device flattens (clips) the peaks, reducing the gain. For example, the oscillator might have a loop gain of 3 for small signals, but that loop gain instaneously drops to zero when the output reaches one of the power supply rails. The net effect is the oscillator amplitude will stabilize when average gain over a cycle is one. If the average loop gain is greater than one, the output amplitude increases until the nonlinearity reduces the average gain to one; if the average loop gain is less than one, then the output amplitude decreases until the average gain is one. The nonlinearity that reduces the gain may also be more subtle than running into a power supply rail.

The result of this gain averaging is some harmonic distortion in the output signal. If the small-signal gain is just a little bit more than one, then only a small amount of gain compression is needed, so there won&#x27;t be much harmonic distortion. If the small-signal gain is much more than one, then significant distortion will be present. However the oscillator must have gain significantly above one to start reliably.

So in oscillators that must produce a very low-distortion sine wave, a system that keeps the gain roughly constant during the entire cycle is used. A common design uses an incandescent lamp or a thermistor in the feedback circuit. These oscillators exploit the resistance of a tungsten filament of the lamp increases in proportion to its temperature (a thermistor works in a similar fashion). The lamp both measures the output amplitude and controls the oscillator gain at the same time. The oscillator&#x27;s signal level heats the filament. If the level is too high, then the filament temperature gradually increases, the resistance increases, and the loop gain falls (thus decreasing the oscillator&#x27;s output level). If the level is too low, the lamp cools down and increases the gain. The 1939 HP200A oscillator uses this technique. Modern variations may use explicit level detectors and gain-controlled amplifiers.

===Wien bridge oscillator===

One of the most common gain-stabilized circuits is the Wien bridge oscillator. In this circuit, two RC circuits are used, one with the RC components in series and one with the RC components in parallel. The Wien Bridge is often used in audio signal generators because it can be easily tuned using a two-section variable capacitor or a two section variable potentiometer (which is more easily obtained than a variable capacitor suitable for generation at low frequencies). The archetypical HP200A audio oscillator is a Wien Bridge oscillator.

<text>James Elliot (August 18, 1775November 10, 1839) was an American soldier, lawyer, author and politician. A holder of local and state offices throughout his life, he was most notable for his service as a United States representative from Vermont.

Elliot was born in Gloucester in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. His father died at sea while serving in the American Revolution, and Elliot&#x27;s mother moved the family to New Salem, where he received his early education. He was indentured to a local farmer, and at age 15 moved to Guilford, Vermont to work as a store clerk. He served in the army during the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania and the Northwest Indian War, then returned to Vermont to study law and begin practice as an attorney. He later published a volume on his wartime experiences, which also included several poems and essays.

During the early 1800s, Elliot served as Clerk of the Vermont House of Representatives. Nominally a Federalist, in 1802 he won election to the U.S. House, where he served for three terms and became identified with many Democratic-Republican principles. After leaving Congress, Elliot edited newspapers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Worcester, Massachusetts, then returned to Vermont to resume practicing law. He served briefly in the War of 1812, and continued to hold local and state offices, including Clerk of Windham County, member of the Vermont House of Representatives, Windham County Register of Probate, and State&#x27;s Attorney of Windham County.

Elliot died in Newfane, Vermont on November 10, 1839, and was buried at Prospect Hill Cemetery in Brattleboro.

==Early life==
Elliot was born in Gloucester, Massachusetts on August 18, 1775, the son of James Elliot, a sailor, and Martha (Day) Elliot. His father died at sea of smallpox after enlisting to serve during the American Revolution, and his mother moved the family to New Salem, where she worked as a seamstress to support them. His mother provided his early education, including teaching him to read, and providing him works including the Bible and popular histories of colonial America and the early United States. As a boy, he was indentured to a farmer in Petersham, who supplemented Elliot&#x27;s early education while he worked on the farm. Elliot later worked to improve his education through self-study, and worked in a variety of occupations including store clerk.

==Start of career==
He moved to Guilford, Vermont in 1790, where he clerked in a store and the circle of friends he developed included Royall Tyler. In 1793, Elliot enlisted in the United States Army, joining Captain Cornelius Lyman&#x27;s company of the 2nd United States Sub-Legion. He attained the rank of sergeant, and took part in the response to the Whiskey Rebellion in Pennsylvania and the Northwest Indian War in Ohio. He received his discharge in 1796, and returned to Vermont. In 1798, Elliot published a volume of essays and poems which included details of the observations he made during his military service.

Elliot served as Clerk of the Vermont House of Representatives from 1801 to 1803. He studied law in the office of a local attorney during the early 1800s, and began a campaign for Congress in 1802. He was admitted to the bar in 1803, and began to practice in Brattleboro.

==Congressman==
He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1802 and was reelected in 1804 and 1806, and served in the 8th, 9th, and 10th Congresses (March 4, 1803 to March 3, 1809). Though he had nominally been a Federalist, Elliot ran as a Democratic-Republican, identified with many Democratic-Republican principles, and was an admirer of several prominent members of the party, including Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, George Clinton, and Samuel Adams.

==Later career==
Upon retiring from Congress, Elliot published the &quot;Freeman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, a Democratic-Republican newspaper in Philadelphia. He then briefly edited the &quot;Worcester Spy&quot;, a Federalist newspaper in Worcester, Massachusetts. By 1812 he was residing and practicing law in Putney, and during the War of 1812 he was commissioned as a captain of Artillery to raise troops in Vermont for the United States Army. He later returned to Brattleboro and he served as Clerk of the Windham County Court from 1817 to 1835.

After the Federalist Party ceased to function, Elliot became a member of the Democratic-Republican Party and by the early 1830s he was identified with the National Republican Party. From 1818 to 1819 Elliot served in the Vermont House of Representatives. From 1822 to 1823 he served as State&#x27;s Attorney for Windham County. He was Windham County&#x27;s Register of Probate from 1822 to 1834, and served again in the Vermont House from 1837 to 1838. From 1837 until his death Elliot served again as Windham County State&#x27;s Attorney.

==Death==
Elliot died in Newfane, Vermont on November 10, 1839. He was interred at Prospect Hill Cemetery in Brattleboro.

==Family==
In 1803, Elliot married Lucy Dow (1781–1869) of Haverhill, New Hampshire. They were the parents of three children, including son James Madison Elliot (1805–1807). Their daughter Mary Annette (1812–1896) was the wife of Wright Pomroy of Binghamton, New York.

Samuel Elliot (1777–1845), the brother of James Elliot, also settled in Vermont, where he became a prominent attorney and held offices including judge of the probate court.

<doc id="1192538" wikidata="Q45680" url="?curid=1192538" title="Swainsona formosa">
<text>Swainsona formosa, commonly known as Sturt&#x27;s desert pea or Sturt pea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae and is native to all continental states and the Northern Territory of Australia, with the exception of Victoria. It is a prostrate annual or short lived perennial herb with imparipinnate leaves with about 15 elliptic to egg-shaped leaflets with the narrower end towards the base, and racemes of usually red flowers in racemes of 2 to 6.

==Description==
&quot;Swainsona formosa&quot; is a prostrate annual or short lived perennial herb, with several densely softly-hairy stems mostly wide. The leaves are mostly long with about 15 elliptic to egg-shaped leaflets long and wide, the end leaflet slightly longer. There are broad, densely hairy stipules, sometimes or more at the base of the petiole.

The flowers are borne in racemes about long with 2 to 6 usually red flowers, sometimes white or other colours, on a peduncle long, each flower on a shaggy-hairy pedicel long. The sepals are joined at the base, forming a bell-shaped tube long with narrowly egg-shaped lobes with thread-like tips, the lobes twice as long as the tube. The standard petal is long and very narrow, the base domed into a usually black, shiny boss. The wings are long, tapering to a narrow point, and the keel long and deep with a narrow tip. Flowering occurs from June to October, and the fruit is a hairy pod or follicle long, wide and round in cross-section, with a stalk long and the remains of the style about long.

Most forms of the plant are low-growing or prostrate, however in the Pilbara region of north-western Australia varieties growing as tall as 2 metres have been observed.

==Taxonomy and naming==
Specimens of Sturt&#x27;s desert pea were first collected by William Dampier who recorded his first sighting on 22 August 1699 on Rosemary Island. These specimens are today in the Fielding-Druce Herbarium at the University of Oxford in England.

The first formal description of the species was in 1832 by George Don, who gave it the name &quot;Donia formosa&quot; in his &quot;A General History of the Dichlamydeous Plants&quot;. In 1835, John Lindley transferred the species to &quot;Clianthus&quot; as &quot;C. dampieri&quot;, but that name was illegitimate because there was no formal description of the genus. In 1950, Neridah Clifton Ford and Joyce Winifred Vickery transferred Don&#x27;s &quot;Donia formosa&quot; to &quot;Clianthus&quot; as &quot;C. formosus&quot; in &quot;Contributions from the New South Wales National Herbarium&quot;, with a description of the genus, the type species endemic to New Zealand. In 1990, Joy Thompson transferred the species to &quot;Swainsona&quot; as &quot;S. formosa&quot;, and the name is accepted by both Plants of the World Online and the Australian Plant Census. The specific epithet (&quot;formosa&quot;) means &quot;finely formed&quot;, &quot;handsome&quot; or &quot;beautiful&quot;.

In 1999, Alex George proposed to transfer the species to the monotypic genus &quot;Willdampia&quot;, but the move was not accepted.

==Distribution and habitat==
Sturt&#x27;s desert pea is widespread in arid parts of inland Australia, including in Western Australia, South Australia, the southern parts of the Northern Territory, western parts of New South Wales and in Queensland. It grows in red sandy or loamy soils in mulga woodland, near creek lines and on stony hills, sometimes in woodland and open plains.

==Common names==

Dampier&#x27;s glory pea (Guilfoyle, 1911)
Australian glory pea (Guilfoyle, 1911)
Dampier pea (Harris, 1980)

It is well adapted to life as a desert plant. The small seeds have a long viability, and can germinate after many years. Seeds have a hard seed coat, which protects them from harsh arid environments until the next rainfall, but inhibits germination in normal domestic environments. Growers can overcome this dormancy either by nicking the seed coat away from the &#x27;eye&#x27; of the seed, by rubbing the seed gently between pieces of sandpaper, or by placing the seed in hot (just off-boiling) water and leaving it to soak overnight.
==Ecology==
Flowers are bird-pollinated in the wild.

==Use as emblem and icon==
Sturt&#x27;s desert pea (described as &quot;Clianthus formosus&quot;) was adopted as the floral emblem of the state of South Australia on 23 November 1961. Its iconic status in Australia, and especially in South Australia, has ensured its use as a popular subject in artwork and photography. It appears in the logos of the Outback Communities Authority and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, South Australia together with the associated volunteer umbrella organisation, Friends of Parks. Sturt&#x27;s Desert Pea has also made many appearances in prose and verse, as well as featuring in some Aboriginal legends.

Sturt&#x27;s desert pea has appeared in several releases of Australian postage stamps depicting Australian floral emblems issued in 1968, 1971 and 2005. The flower also features on the logo of Charles Sturt University, which is also named after the explorer.

<doc id="1192543" wikidata="Q3483123" url="?curid=1192543" title="Sideling Hill">
<text>Sideling Hill, also Side Long Hill, is a long, steep, narrow mountain ridge in the Ridge-and-Valley (or Allegheny Mountains) physiographic province of the Appalachian Mountains, located in Washington County in western Maryland and adjacent West Virginia and Pennsylvania, USA. The highest point on the ridge is Fisher Point, at in Fulton County, Pennsylvania.

==Geology==

Sideling Hill is a syncline mountain, in a region of downward-folded (synclinal) rock strata between two upfolded anticlines. The ridge is capped by an erosion-resistant conglomerate and sandstone of Mississippian (early Carboniferous) geologic age, the Purslane Sandstone of the Pocono Formation. The ridge&#x27;s slopes are formed of much more easily eroded kinds of rock, including the Devonian-Mississippian Rockwell Formation, with long, narrow valleys paralleling the ridge on either side.

==Ecology==
Most of the crest of Sideling Hill is forested, primarily with various deciduous tree species such as oaks (&quot;Quercus&quot;) and hickories (&quot;Carya&quot;), along with occasional evergreen pines (&quot;Pinus&quot;).

==Highway, railroad, and canal crossings==
Only a few major highways, one active railroad and two former ones, and one former canal cross this steep mountain ridge.

===East Broad Top Railroad Tunnel (Pennsylvania)===

The East Broad Top Railroad constructed a tunnel through Sideling Hill in 1873–1874 as part of its mainline construction. The tunnel predates the South Pennsylvania Railroad tunnel construction to the south by eight years. The tunnel is single-tracked, and curved at each end. It originally had a stone portal on its eastern (RR North) end and a natural stone portal at its western (RR South) end, but about 1919 the north portal was replaced with a concrete one.

The north portal was equipped with doors to prevent wind from blowing through the tunnel as the wind caused water percolating into the tunnel to freeze on the tracks in the winter. In 1911, this ice caused the brand new locomotive #12 to derail its pilot axle inside the tunnel then derail the entire locomotive at the Kimmel switch just beyond the tunnel. In the 1940s, the doors were equipped with remote actuators mounted on poles a few hundred feet before each portal. This allowed the crews to open and close the doors without stopping. The system did not work flawlessly and a door was ripped off by a caboose cupola.

The tunnel was in service from 1874 until the railroad ceased operations in 1956. The line is technically out of service (but not abandoned), and the track is still in place through the tunnel, although not serviceable. The tunnel and rail line are private property and not open to the public.

===Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76)===
The Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76, I-76) crosses Sideling Hill east of Breezewood, Pennsylvania, bypassing the two-lane Sideling Hill Tunnel and the nearby Rays Hill Tunnel that were formerly used by the Turnpike. Completed at a cost of $17,203,000, the Sideling Hill bypass opened on November 26, 1968, and the former alignment through the tunnels became known as the Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike. A rest area next to the ridge was a stop on Bill Clinton and Al Gore&#x27;s post-convention bus tour in 1992.

===Sideling Hill Tunnel (Pennsylvania)===
The Sideling Hill Tunnel, through Sideling Hill in Pennsylvania east of Breezewood, is currently in its third phase of life. In the 1880s, a tunnel was partially bored through the mountain by the South Pennsylvania Railroad. The railroad project ceased, and the tunnel was left abandoned. When construction of the Pennsylvania Turnpike was begun in the 1930s by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission on the right-of-way of the South Pennsylvania Railroad, the tunnel was completed for highway use by the turnpike.

The tunnel, the longest of the seven original turnpike tunnels at long, was used from the turnpike&#x27;s opening in 1940 until 1968. Due to increasing traffic on the highway, the turnpike commission began upgrading all of its two-lane tunnels, constructing twin bores for its tunnels through the Allegheny, Tuscarora, Kittatinny, and Blue mountains, and bypassing the tunnels under Laurel Hill, Rays Hill, and Sideling Hill with new, six-lane highways climbing the adjacent hills. The Sideling Hill Tunnel and the nearby Rays Hill tunnel, along with connecting segments of four-lane highway, were used for many years as a testing facility for new highway technologies.

In 2001, the Sideling Hill Tunnel was sold to the Southern Alleghenies Conservancy for $1, which now operates it as a bike trail.

===Sideling Hill Road Cut (I-68 and US 40, Maryland)===
The Sideling Hill Road Cut on I-68 and US 40 is a notch excavated from the ridge of Sideling Hill, about west of Hancock in Washington County, Maryland. Blasting was completed in August 1984. It is notable as an impressive man-made mountain pass, visible from miles away, and is considered to be one of the best rock exposures in Maryland and the entire northeastern United States. Almost of strata in a tightly folded syncline are exposed in this road cut. Although other exposures may surpass Sideling Hill in either thickness of exposed strata or in quality of geologic structure, few can equal its combination of both. The exposed rocks consist of the Devonian-Mississippian Rockwell Formation, underlying the Mississippian Purslane Sandstone.

====Rest stop and former exhibit center====
A highway rest stop, located near the eastern side of the Sideling Hill Road Cut on I-68 west of Hancock, includes a pedestrian bridge crossing I-68, connecting the eastbound and westbound rest areas and offering views of the cut, in which stopping is prohibited.

The rest stop formerly included the Sideling Hill Exhibit Center, a four-level geological museum and travel information center which opened in 1991. Due to state budget cuts, this facility was closed on August 15, 2009, as part of a $280 million budget reduction package, saving the state about $110,000 annually. Before its closing, the center served about 95,000 visitors a year. Many of the geological exhibits from the former Exhibit Center are now displayed at the Hancock Museum in nearby Hancock, Maryland.

The former exhibit center building was reopened as a welcome center on October 9, 2015. Only part of the facility is open, with the former exhibit center exhibits remaining at the Hancock Museum.

===National Road (US 40 Scenic)===
Before construction of I-68, US 40 (now US 40 Scenic), the National Road, crossed Sideling Hill with a steep grade on each side and a sharp hairpin turn at the crest of the mountain.

===Potomac River Water Gap===
The water gap cut through Sideling Hill by the Potomac River southwest (upstream) of Hancock, Maryland, provides a low-level crossing of the ridge for the CSX Railroad, formerly the main line of the Baltimore and Ohio (B&amp;O) Railroad, on the southern (West Virginia) side of the river, and on the northern (Maryland) side, the former Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, now a national historical park, and the former Western Maryland Railroad (now a rail trail).

<doc id="1192553" wikidata="Q445468" url="?curid=1192553" title="Walter Centeno">
<text>Wálter Centeno Corea (born 6 October 1974) is a Costa Rican former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder and current manager of Guadalupe.

He was a regular member of the Costa Rica national team and holds the record for appearances, having gained 137 caps (135 FIFA official caps) and scored 24 goals.

==Club career==

===Saprissa===
Nicknamed &quot;Paté&quot;, Centeno started his career at Saprissa, who loaned him out to Belén for whom he made his professional debut on 4 February 1995 against Alajuelense. He scored his first goal on 3 September 1995 for Belén against Turrialba. He earned his nickname in his childhood due to his love for eating pate&#x27;s.

===AEK Athens===
After seven years at Saprissa Centeno had a short spell abroad when he moved to Greece to play for AEK Athens. While playing for AEK, he participated in the UEFA Champions League Group Stage managing to score in the team&#x27;s away home draws against Real Madrid at Estadio Santiago Bernabéu in the 2–2 draw and Roma at Stadio Olimpico in 1–1 draw, as they achieved the record of drawing all the matches of the group stage. After one season, Centeno filed an appeal for debts of club to him and was released.

===Back at Saprissa===
He returned to Saprissa, where he was named the best player of the 2003–04 Costa Rican season by the Costa Rican sports media, after scoring nine goals while orchestrating Saprissa&#x27;s offense, helping the team to win the league.

With Saprissa, he won 10 national championships and one CONCACAF Champions Cup, winning the title with a 3–2 aggregate win over Mexico&#x27;s UNAM Pumas in the final. He was part of the team that played the 2005 FIFA Club World Championship Toyota Cup, where Saprissa finished third behind São Paulo and Liverpool. His appearance at this tournament was considered as outstanding by FIFA experts.

He retired in 2012, his final league match was on 5 May 2012 for Saprissa against Santos de Guápiles. Saprissa retired the no. 8 shirt in his honour as well as definitely retiring the no. 10 shirt of Alonso Solís.

===Puerto Rico===
In April 2013, Centeno came out of retirement to join Puerto Rican side Bayamón.

==International career==
Centeno played his first game for the Costa Rica national football team on 27 September 1995 against Jamaica. He has been a fixture for the team for the last thirteen years, playing in the Pan American Games held in Mar del Plata, Argentina, in 1995; the Copa América tournaments of 1997, 2001 and 2004; plus the FIFA World Cup in 2002 and 2006. On 1 April 2009, he surpassed the record of caps for Costa Rica (held then by Luis Marín, 124 caps, 5 goals) as at 18 November 2009 he has 137 caps and 24 goals. He was the captain of Costa Rica national football team for the last part of 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifications. Rodrigo Kenton, the appointed manager replacing the fired Hernan Medford, chose him for covering this important role in the team because of his experience, hardening and leadership. Centeno played his last game on the national team on 18 November 2009, where they tied 1–1, in which he scored. The game meant that Costa Rica will not be in World Cup 2010. Centeno&#x27;s goal was his last with as an International player, and it also marked the last goal of the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying stage.

Shortly after that game, he announced his quitting from national team.

==Personal life==
Centeno is a son of Benigno Centeno and Lidieth Corea and he is married to Vivian Gutiérrez with whom he has three children.

<text>George McKenzie Samson VC (7 January 1889 – 28 February 1923) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, for his actions during the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War. Samson was from Carnoustie in Angus, 26 years old, and a seaman in the Royal Naval Reserve when he was awarded the VC.

On 25 April 1915 during the landing at V Beach on Cape Helles, Seaman Samson, along with three other men (George Leslie Drewry, Wilfred St. Aubyn Malleson, and William Charles Williams) was assisting the commander (Edward Unwin) of their ship , at the work of securing the lighters. He worked all day under very heavy fire, attending wounded and getting out lines. He was eventually seriously wounded by Maxim fire.

While dressed in civilian clothes and on his way to a public reception in his honour, Samson was given a white feather.

He later achieved the rank of petty officer and rejoined the Merchant Navy after the war, ultimately dying of pneumonia. He is buried in the new St. George&#x27;s Military Cemetery off Secretary Lane in St. George&#x27;s, Bermuda. His VC is in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery in the Imperial War Museum in London.

<doc id="1192561" wikidata="Q3795407" url="?curid=1192561" title="The Manciple's Tale">
<text>&quot;The Manciple&#x27;s Tale&quot; is part of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. It tends to appear near the end of most manuscripts of the poem, and the prologue to the final tale, &quot;The Parson&#x27;s Tale&quot;, makes it clear that it was intended to be the penultimate story in the collection. The Manciple, a purchasing agent for a law court, tells a fable about Phoebus Apollo and his pet crow, which is both an origin myth explaining the crow&#x27;s black feathers and a moralistic injunction against gossip.

== Prologue ==
In the tale&#x27;s prologue, the Host tries to rouse the Cook to tell a tale, but he is too drunk. The Manciple insults the Cook, who falls semi-conscious from his horse, but they are reconciled by the Host and the Manciple offers the Cook another drink to make up.

== Plot ==

In the main plot of the tale, Phoebus has a crow which is all white and can speak. Phoebus also has a wife, whom he treasures but keeps shut up in his house. He is very jealous of his wife:
&lt;poem&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

The Manciple digresses to say that one cannot tame a creature to remove its essential nature; no matter how well-fed a tame cat may be, it will still attack mice instinctively. Similarly, Phoebus&#x27;s wife takes a lover of low estate; the crow reveals their secret, and Phoebus in rage kills his wife. In his grief afterwards, he regrets his act and blames the crow, cursing it with black feathers and an unmelodious voice. The Manciple ends by saying it is best to hold one&#x27;s tongue, and not to say anything malicious even if it is true.

== Sources ==

The ultimate source for the tale is Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. Chaucer probably knew several French versions, such as that in the Ovide moralisé and Machaut&#x27;s &quot;Voir dit&quot;. Adaptations were popular in Chaucer&#x27;s time, such as one in John Gower&#x27;s &quot;Confessio Amantis&quot;.

<text>John Edward Kelly (December 15, 1862 – November 1, 1895) was an Irish-born American boxer, better known as Nonpareil Jack Dempsey, who was the first holder of the World Middleweight Championship (1884–1891). He was nicknamed &quot;Nonpareil&quot; because of his reputation of being unbeatable.

==Biography==
Dempsey was born on December 15, 1862, in Curragh, County Kildare, Ireland. He won the middleweight title on July 30, 1884, by defeating George Fulljames in Great Kills, Staten Island, New York. He held the title for over six years, defending the title against two fighters during the reign.

In Dempsey&#x27;s first 65 contests, he lost only three times: to George LaBlanche (a loss he avenged) and to Billy Baker twice (both bouts were fixed to have Baker win). This ended when Bob Fitzsimmons pummeled him around the ring and begged him to concede before he was hurt any more. Dempsey, the reigning champion, would not give up; the fight continued and Fitzsimmons knocked him out in round 13. In his final bout, Dempsey, suffering from tuberculosis, lost to Tommy Ryan.

Though Dempsey beat his first battle with tuberculosis, he died at age 32 at the Portland, Oregon, home of his wife&#x27;s parents on November 1, 1895, due to a recurrence of the disease. He was buried in an initially unmarked grave at Mount Calvary Cemetery. M. James Brady, Dempsey&#x27;s father-in-law, refused to permit former World Champion John L. Sullivan and John S. Barnes to raise funds to erect a monument over Dempsey&#x27;s grave. The family believed that a four-foot marble shaft was a sufficient memorial. The matter was thus dropped.

Dempsey was inducted into the Ring Boxing Hall of Fame in 1954, and into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1992.

==Professional boxing record==

All newspaper decisions are regarded as &quot;no decision&quot; bouts as they have &quot;resulted in neither boxer winning or losing, and would therefore not count as part of their official fight record.&quot;

<doc id="1192565" wikidata="Q68260" url="?curid=1192565" title="Alfred Lion">
<text>Alfred Lion (born Alfred Löw; April 21, 1908 – February 2, 1987) was a German-born American record executive who co-founded the jazz record label Blue Note in 1939. Lion retired in 1967, having sold the company, after producing recordings by leading musicians throughout the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s.

==Early years==
Lion was born in Schöneberg, later a borough of Berlin, on April 21, 1908. His fascination with jazz began at the age of 16 when he saw a concert by Sam Wooding&#x27;s Orchestra. In 1926, Lion emigrated to the United States, but while working on the New York docks he was attacked by an anti-immigrant worker; he returned to Germany to convalesce. From 1933, Lion lived in South America, working for German import-export companies, returning to New York in 1938. His presence at the &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot; concert at Carnegie Hall inspired him to start a record label.

==Career==
In partnership with communist writer Max Margulis, who supplied the start-up capital, Lion founded Blue Note in 1939. In the label&#x27;s first record session on January 6, Lion recorded two musicians who had impressed him at the earlier concert: the boogie-woogie pianists Albert Ammons and Meade Lux Lewis. The company&#x27;s first hit, recorded in the same year, was Sidney Bechet&#x27;s recording of &quot;Summertime&quot;. It was notable for being issued on a 12&quot; 78rpm record instead of the then standard 10&quot; owing to its length.

By the time Lion was drafted into the army, his Berlin childhood friend Francis Wolff had joined him, and under the wing of Milt Gabler and his Commodore Music Store, Wolff sustained the business in Lion&#x27;s absence. (Margulis had by now permanently dropped out of any involvement with Blue Note.)

At the persuading of Ike Quebec, who was a Blue Note recording artist and talent scout during the 1940s, Lion began to explore more modern developments in jazz, and Quebec introduced Lion to Thelonious Monk, the first &#x27;modern&#x27; jazz musician Blue Note was to record. Blue Note&#x27;s involvement with modern jazz was not total for several years, and Lion continued his label&#x27;s association with Bechet and clarinetist George Lewis into the 1950s. Wolff would supervise few sessions himself until after Lion&#x27;s retirement, concentrating on the company&#x27;s business affairs.

What became known as the &quot;hard bop&quot; style would predominate in Blue Note&#x27;s output during the 1950s and 1960s. Musicians such as Art Blakey and Horace Silver among others epitomised this style. In the mid-1950s, however, Blue Note was a struggling label, hit by the record industry&#x27;s changeover to the 12&quot; LP format, but the popularity of the organ/soul jazz craze, driven by the innovative work of Jimmy Smith, ensured that the label survived. Ike Quebec, who was for much of the 1950s working outside of jazz and battling a heroin addiction, returned to Blue Note in 1959 as both a recording artist and as an employee, working in artists and repertoire (A&amp;R) to help the label identify new talent and shape the content of LP releases.

Three significant elements make Blue Note releases stand out: the work of recording engineer Rudy Van Gelder, the photographs of Francis Wolff and the cover designs principally by Reid Miles. Lion and Wolff were also respected by musicians for their straight dealing and for &quot;hanging out&quot; in the jazz scene.

Blue Note also recorded avant-garde musicians like Andrew Hill and Cecil Taylor. Indeed, it was Lion&#x27;s discovery of Hill, which he would later cite, along with his earlier involvement with Thelonious Monk and their fellow pianist Herbie Nichols, as having given him particular pleasure during his career.

Duke Pearson, who Lion hired to do A&amp;R work after Quebec&#x27;s death in 1963, helped to ensure that the label&#x27;s roster remained fresh as a whole. In fact the popularity that Horace Silver&#x27;s &quot;Song for My Father&quot; and Lee Morgan&#x27;s &quot;The Sidewinder&quot; enjoyed resulted in Lion being pressured by his distributors into producing more hits.

Having suffered from heart problems for some years, Lion retired in 1967 having sold the Blue Note label and catalogue to Liberty Records in 1965. Wolff stayed with the label until his death in 1971. Liberty Records in turn was acquired by United Artists, and the Blue Note imprint went dormant until it was revived by record executive Bruce Lundvall under the ownership of EMI.

==Death==
Lion died of heart failure in Poway, California at the age of 78.
Although not widely published, Alfred Lion had a son (Raymond Abrams) by Ike Quebec&#x27;s sister, Mary Francis Abrams.

<text>Broadwell is a village in Warwickshire, England in the civil parish of Leamington Hastings roughly midway between Dunchurch and Southam on the A426 road.

==History==


In 1086, the Domesday Book records that the chief estate of Leamington was held by Hasculf Musard. Broadwell (like the neighbouring villages of Leamington Hastings, Hill and Kites Hardwick) was once a manor in its own right. Joan Hastang (of the family whose name is borne by Leamington Hastings) was allotted Broadwell in 1375. According to Prof. Louis Salzman&#x27;s &quot;History of the County of Warwick&quot;, the &quot;...last mention of Bradwell (sic) as a separate manor is in the inquisition post mortem on Humphrey Stafford in 1545&quot;. Broadwell is one of three villages of that name in central England. The other two are in Gloucestershire – one between the towns of Moreton-in-Marsh and Stow-on-the-Wold, the other a few miles west of Lechlade on the upper River Thames.

The villages in Leamington Hastings parish are farming settlements. Today, there is a mix of sheep and arable. However, Louis Salzman records that much of arable land had once been pasture. This is borne out in &quot;Mr Sponges&#x27;s Sporting Tour&quot; written in 1853 by R.S. Surtees which refers to: &quot;... the wide-stretching grazing grounds of Southam and Dunchurch.&quot; Today, Broadwell compromises roughly 70 households. There are four farms in the village itself (Home Farm, Croftlands Farm, Broadwell House Farm and Hospital Farm) and several smallholdings. Other farms border the village. Broadwell is in the broad flat valley of the River Leam. The valley is bounded to the north by the Rugby ridge and Lawford Heath, to the south by a low range of upland which forms part of the Northamptonshire &amp; Warwickshire ironstone hills. The village sits on fossil-rich Blue Lias clay, hence the proximity of several cement works, all now closed.

Architecturally, Broadwell is somewhat unprepossessing. The village green is surrounded by 18th and 19th century cottages, post-World War II council houses, 1970s bungalows and 1990s large detached houses. The mixture on Main Street and Hayway Lane (formerly known as Green Lane and Elm Road) is similar although there is no Local Authority housing. Since the late &#x27;80s/early 90s, two bungalows and nine detached houses have been built as infill. The village has an old forge, a 17th-century blacksmith shop, which is a Grade II listed building. The building, although derelict and structurally unsafe (with an Acrow prop supporting the roof), cannot be demolished, because of the protection order, and would be unviable to restore. 

Historically, farming has always been the principal activity, although in the 20th century some residents worked in the Charles Nelson Company&#x27;s cement works in neighbouring Stockton. Today, many residents are retired: the rest work away from the village with a considerable number commuting everyday: the A426 road is just outside the village and the M40, M1 and M6 all within a 15-mile radius. Until the 1960s, there was a railway station ( on the Leamington to Weedon line) a mile from the village. Today, there is a bus service to neighbouring towns. However, most families in Broadwell have at least one car.

==Amenities==
There is no shop or public house in Broadwell. In part, the lack of a pub is due to the village&#x27;s nonconformist tradition; Broadwell has a substantial Methodist chapel. The village also has a small Church of England chapel, the Church of the Good Shepherd, which is in the parish of Leamington Hastings. Services are held monthly in the Church of the Good Shepherd. Previously, however, the village did have a small post office selling stamps and a small range of what might be classed as &#x27;essential items.&#x27; It was based at the rear of a private bungalow. But when the Post Office insisted the elderly postmistress would have to install a computer for electronic transactions, she (politely) told them what to do with their computer – and retired! The nearest Post Office (and shop) is at Stockton, some 3 miles away.

Communal life centres on the village hall. Until December 2007, this was a corrugated iron sheet building. This structure was dismantled and a larger brick-built hall was erected during January and February 2008. Principal users of the hall are the Trustees of the village green, the Flower Show Committee and local art groups. Demographically, Broadwell is home to a fairly typical rural Midlands population. There is little ethnic diversity or multiculturalism and the age range is weighted towards the late middle-aged. However, there are more than a dozen families with school-age children and in 2013 at least four &#x27;Broadwell babies&#x27; were due to be born.

==Business==
There are several established businesses in Broadwell including Home Farm, Cedar Associates, Discovery CE and Raymont-Osman Product Design. The latter are both engineering consultants and are gathered in converted barns on Broadwell House Farm on the edge of Broadwell.

<text>was the founder of the Shimazu samurai clan.

== Life ==
Tadahisa was a son of the Shōgun Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147–1199) by the sister of Hiki Yoshikazu.

According to a record of his life, he was reportedly born in Sumiyoshi Taisha in Osaka. He was initially but after being given the position of &quot;jitō&quot; (land steward) of the Shimazu Estate by Minamoto no Yoritomo, he took the name of Shimazu.

He received the domain of Shioda (Shinano province) in 1186 and was then named &quot;Shugo&quot; of Satsuma province. He sent Honda Sadachika to take possession of the province in his name and accompanied Yoritomo in his expedition to Mutsu in 1189. 

He went to Satsuma in 1196, subdued Hyūga and Ōsumi provinces, and built a castle in the domain of Shimazu (Hyūga) which name he also adopted. He died in 1227 and was buried in Kamakura, near his father&#x27;s tomb. His descendants ran the Shimazu clan (named after him) for hundreds of years.

==Views==
Bayefsky has argued that Ontario&#x27;s policy of fully funding Roman Catholic schools, while denying full funding to other religious schools, is discriminatory.

Bayefsky speaks out in defense of Israel. She was critical of &quot;the Obama administration&#x27;s response to Israel&#x27;s announcement that it will continue to build new homes for its expanding population in occupied territory,&quot; calling it &quot;hysterical,&quot; and asked, &quot;Given that the United States is supposed to be committed to the parties determining ultimate legal ownership of the land in final status negotiations, what is going on?&quot;

<text>Francis Wolff (April 5, 1907 – March 8, 1971) was a record company executive, photographer and record producer. Wolff&#x27;s skills, as an executive and a photographer, were important contributions to the success of the Blue Note record label.

==Career==
Jakob Franz &quot;Franny&quot; Wolff was born in Berlin, Germany, where he became a jazz enthusiast, despite the government ban placed on this type of music after 1933. After a career as a commercial photographer in Germany, Wolff emigrated to the United States. A Jew, he left Berlin for New York in the late 1930s. In 1939 in New York his childhood friend Alfred Lion had co-founded Blue Note Records (with business partner Max Margulis, who soon dropped out of any involvement in the company), and Wolff joined Lion in running the company. During Lion&#x27;s war service, Wolff worked for Milt Gabler at the Commodore Music Store, and together they maintained the company&#x27;s catalogue until Lion was discharged.

Until Lion retired in 1967, Wolff concentrated on the financial affairs of the business and only supervised occasional recording sessions produced during his visits to Europe to see surviving members of his family. For the last four years of his life, when Blue Note was no longer an independent label, Wolff shared production responsibilities with pianist and arranger Duke Pearson. He died of a heart attack following surgery in New York City, aged 64.

Wolff took photographs during the recordings sessions, usually shot during session rehearsals, throughout the period of Lion&#x27;s involvement in Blue Note Records. They were used on publicity material and the label&#x27;s album covers, and have continued to be used in CD reissue booklets. The two collections of photographs listed below contain entirely separate selections of the many thousands Wolff shot over a thirty-year period.

Reid Miles and Alfred Lion chose to leave the label in 1967, while Francis Wolff remained until his death on March 8, 1971 from a heart attack. Francis Wolff is considered one of the leading jazz photographers. His work has long remained unknown to the public; the publication in 1995 of a book entitled &quot;The Blue Note Years: The Jazz Photography of Francis Wolff&quot;, a compilation of his principal photographs for the label, helped to make his work more widely known.

<text>George Sanders VC MC (8 July 1894 – 4 April 1950) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
George Sanders was the son of Thomas and Amy Sanders. He received his education at Little Holbeck School and after completing his time there was indentured as an apprentice fitter at the nearby Airedale Foundry.

==Military service==
George enlisted for service on 9 November 1914 and was drafted as a private and later promoted to corporal to the 1/7th (Leeds Rifles) Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment (The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own), British Army during the First World War. The Battalion went to France in April 1915 and in 1916 were to take part in the Battle of the Somme

===VC action===
On 1 July 1916 near Thiepval, France, Sanders&#x27; battalion were in reserve but late the afternoon the battalion was ordered to advance into the Schwaben Redoubt which had been captured earlier in the day and was being counter-attacked. After an advance into the enemy&#x27;s trenches, 21-year old Corporal Sanders found himself isolated with a party of 30 men. For 36 hours Sanders&#x27; small force held off German attacks before being relieved and leading the 19 survivors back to the British lines.

Sanders&#x27; actions were recognised with the award of the Victoria Cross which was published in the London Gazette on 9 September 1916. The citation read:
After receiving his Victoria Cross on 18 November 1916 at Buckingham Palace, from the King, he returned to the front.

===Later service===
In July 1917 Sanders was commissioned as a temporary Second Lieutenant in the 2nd Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment. By December 1917 Sanders was a company commander and was made an acting Captain.

In April 1918 the German Army launched the Spring Offensive. Sanders was now attached to the 1/6th Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment who were positioned at Mount Kemmel. Heavy fighting ensued and acting Captain Sanders was awarded the Military Cross, the award of which was posted in the London Gazette on 13 September 1918. The citation stated:
He was taken prisoner of war (POW) on 25 April and listed as wounded and missing with injuries to both his right arm and leg, last seen carrying his revolver in his left hand. Sanders was interned at the Limburg POW camp. In July he managed to get a letter to his father telling of his capture and captivity. On 26 December Captain Sanders was sent back to England, and he was discharged in March 1919.

==Later life==
After the war in June 1920 he attended a victory party and a Victory Cross reunion dinner on the tenth anniversary of the end of the war in November 1929, both at Buckingham Palace.

Sanders unveiled the Leeds Rifles War Memorial at Leeds Minster on Remembrance Sunday 1921.

George Sanders VC MC died in Leeds on 4 April 1950 aged 55. His funeral was held at the Cottingley Crematorium in the city.

==Medals==
His medal group, including his VC and MC, were sold at auction in 2017 for £240,000. It is reported that they were bought by Lord Ashcroft and will be placed on display at the Imperial War Museum.

<doc id="1192583" wikidata="Q7344660" url="?curid=1192583" title="Robert Gallucci">
<text>Robert L. Gallucci (born February 11, 1946) is an American academic and diplomat, who formerly worked as president of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. He previously served as dean of the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, from 1996 to June 2009. Prior to his appointment in 1996, for over two decades he had served in various governmental and international agencies, including the Department of State and the United Nations.

==Early life and education==
Gallucci was born in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from Brentwood High School. Afterwards he attended Stony Brook University for his undergraduate studies, later earning his master&#x27;s degree and doctorate in politics from Brandeis University. After his post-graduate studies, he taught at Swarthmore College, Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and Georgetown University. He has received fellowships from the Council on Foreign Relations, the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Harvard University, and the Brookings Institution.

==Career==
Gallucci left the world of academia in 1974 and went on to hold various positions relating to international affairs. He first found employment at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. Four years later, he became a division chief in the Department of State&#x27;s Bureau of Intelligence and Research. From 1979 to 1981, he was a member of the Secretary&#x27;s policy planning staff. He then served as an office director in both the Bureau of Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs and in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs for a year each.

Ten years after beginning his foreign affairs career, he left Washington, D.C., to serve as the deputy director general of the Multinational Force and Observers, the Sinai peacekeeping force headquartered in Rome. He returned in 1988 to join the faculty of the National War College, where he taught for three years. In April 1991 he moved to New York to take up an appointment as the deputy executive chairman of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) overseeing the disarmament of Iraq. He returned again to Washington in 1992 to join the Office of the Deputy Secretary as the senior coordinator responsible for nonproliferation and nuclear safety initiatives in the former Soviet Union. In July of the same year his appointment as the Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs was confirmed. During the North Korean nuclear crisis of 1994, Gallucci was the chief U.S. negotiator. He also has served as an ambassador-at-large with the Department of State, since August 1994.

Gallucci returned to Georgetown University as dean of the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service on May 1, 1996. In March 1998, the Department of State appointed him as special envoy to deal with the threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction, a position which he held until January 2001. As a dean at Georgetown University, Gallucci recommended conservative Douglas J. Feith to a 2-year faculty position which Feith occupied in the fall of 2006, a move which generated protests from some liberal faculty and students. In 2015, Gallucci became director of The John W. Kluge Center at the Library of Congress.

<doc id="1192590" wikidata="Q7604148" url="?curid=1192590" title="Static Taxi">
<text>Static Taxi was a post-punk band formed in the late 1980s, later joined by Bob Stinson, former lead guitarist of The Replacements. They were so-called because two members of the band worked part-time as taxi drivers.

Two years after leaving the Replacements, Stinson joined Static Taxi in the summer of 1988 with two younger friends, drummer John Reipas and bassist/vocalist Ray Reigstad. Stinson had been jamming informally with Riegstad and Reipas for a couple of years previously, playing cover versions of 1970s pop songs, even while he was still a member of the Replacements. They became a quartet when they recruited bass player Chris Corbett.

The band rehearsed tirelessly over the next few years, and developed an extensive catalog of original songs and cover versions. Their headquarters was the office of an abandoned grain elevator near the University of Minnesota campus in southeast Minneapolis. Later, they moved to one of several boxcars which the owner of the grain elevator kept on a railroad siding behind his property and rented out to various artists and musicians. The grain elevator was home to a number of homeless veterans, including one named &quot;Hillbilly&quot; who sang the lead on the band&#x27;s recording of their song &quot;Hillbilly&#x27;s Lament.&quot;

Static Taxi recorded a large amount of material, some of it on professional studio equipment, and at some point, Stinson brought some demo tapes to the Replacements&#x27; old label Twin/Tone. The label refused to sign the band, reportedly because they thought Reigstad&#x27;s singing was off-key. Aside from a brief trip to Las Vegas in 1989, the band&#x27;s live shows were limited to the local Twin Cities area. Videos of just two of their live shows have surfaced on video-sharing sites such as YouTube: a 1989 show in Las Vegas where they are performing before a small but enthusiastic crowd at a little club, and a 1990 performance where they entertained the employees of a local Twin Cities restaurant at its annual staff party.

The band broke up in 1991, around the same time the Replacements broke up.

Stinson died in 1995. Vocalist Ray Reigstad went on to form the band Stepchild.

Two albums have been posthumously compiled from the band&#x27;s recordings. In 2000, &quot;Stinson Blvd&quot; was released on Rock X-Change Records. In 2003 Birdman Records released &quot;Closer2Normal.&quot;

<doc id="1192599" wikidata="Q892132" url="?curid=1192599" title="Marked nominative alignment">
<text>In linguistic typology, marked nominative alignment is an unusual type of morphosyntactic alignment similar to, and often considered a subtype of, a nominative–accusative alignment. In a prototypical nominative–accusative language with a grammatical case system like Latin, the object of a verb is marked for accusative case, and the subject of the verb may or may not be marked for nominative case. The nominative, whether or not it is marked morphologically, is also used as the citation form of the noun. In a marked nominative system, on the other hand, it is the nominative case alone that is usually marked morphologically, and it is the unmarked accusative case that is used as the citation form of the noun. The unmarked accusative (sometimes called absolutive) is typically also used with a wide range of other functions that are associated with the nominative in nominative-accusative languages; they often include the subject complement and a subject moved to a more prominent place in the sentence in order to express topic or focus.

==Distribution==

Marked nominative languages are relatively rare. They are well-documented in only two regions of the world: in northern Africa, where they occur in many languages of the Cushitic, Omotic and Berber branches of the Afroasiatic family, as well as in the Surmic and Nilotic languages of the Eastern Sudanic family; and in the southwestern United States and adjacent parts of Mexico, where they are characteristic of the Yuman family. Other languages interpreted by some authors as having a marked nominative system include Igbo, Aymara and Wappo. It is also proposed that marked-nominative alignment can be reconstructed for the ancestor of the Afroasiatic languages, viz. Proto-Afroasiatic.

In Yuman and many of the Cushitic languages, however, the nominative is not always marked for reasons that are not known. There may, therefore, be not a strict case system but a reflection of discourse patterns or other non-semantic parameters. However, the Yuman language Havasupai is reported to have a purely syntactic case system, with a suffix &quot;-č&quot; marking all subjects of transitive and intransitive verbs but not of the copula; in the Nilotic language Datooga, the system is also reported to be purely syntactic.

As in many Nilotic languages, Datooga case is marked by tone. The absolutive case has the unpredictable tone of the citation form of the noun, but the nominative is marked by a characteristic tone that obliterates the lexical tone. The tone is high for words of three syllables or less; for words with four or more syllables, the ends of the word have high tone, with a low tone in the middle of the word.

In most African languages with a marked nominative, the nominative is used for subjects following the verb, the absolutive with the copula, with subjects in focus position before the verb, and in all other situations.

Okinawan, a Japonic language, is generally a marked nominative language where nominative subjects are marked with the case particles &quot;ga&quot; or &quot;nu&quot; depending on their level of animacy. Unmarked nouns are by default in the accusative case. However, some verbs of existence and emergence may also have optionally unmarked nominative subjects.

<doc id="1192600" wikidata="Q1023813" url="?curid=1192600" title="CKY (film series)">
<text>The CKY video series is a series of videos produced by Bam Margera and Brandon DiCamillo and other residents of West Chester, Pennsylvania. &quot;CKY&quot; stands for &quot;Camp Kill Yourself&quot;. The series was part of the basis for what eventually became &quot;Jackass&quot;.

Four videos were released, Landspeed presents: CKY (later called CKY), CKY2K, CKY3, and CKY4: The Latest &amp; Greatest. There is also a &quot;CKY&quot; documentary DVD, which is a supplemental item in the &quot;CKY Box Set&quot;, as well as two &quot;CKY Trilogy&quot; sets, both of which are compilation DVDs featuring scenes from the previous &quot;CKY&quot; DVDs. The videos were named after Bam Margera&#x27;s brother Jess and his band CKY.

The videos feature Bam Margera, Brandon DiCamillo, their friends, and Margera&#x27;s relatives performing various stunts and pranks, interspersed with skate footage of Margera and other professional skateboarders. A trademark of the skating footage was to show unsuccessful trick attempts immediately followed by the same skater pulling the trick off. &quot;CKY&quot; started when Margera and his friends were in the same graphics arts class at school in West Chester, Pennsylvania. During class, they would go out to a field and film skits, eventually being compiled into the &quot;CKY&quot; series. In a 2002 interview, Margera said that more than 400,000 copies of the series have been sold.

In 2018, producer Joe Frantz confirmed that he had begun remastering all four videos for HD release. They were released in 2019 on the now-defunct streaming service DCTV.

== The CKY crew ==

In addition to Margera and DiCamillo, the core members of the CKY crew included Ryan Dunn, Chris Raab (aka Raab Himself), Rake Yohn, and Bam&#x27;s elder brother Jess. Jess&#x27; involvement with the video side of &quot;CKY&quot; became increasingly limited as CKY the band became popular, and touring and recording commitments took up most of his time.

The first video stars the main crew, as well as Ryan Gee (aka The Gill), Mike Maldonado, Chris Aspite (aka Hoofbite), Kerry Getz, brothers Mark and Chris Hanna, and Rake&#x27;s younger brother Art Webb. Bam&#x27;s father, Phil, was also featured (uncredited) in the first video. Bam&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Jenn Rivell, and David Decurtis (aka Naked Dave) starred in the second video, which also features Bam&#x27;s mother April (uncredited), and skateboarder Tim O&#x27;Connor. Chris Raab was called Raab Himself in the third video, which also featured CKY band members Deron Miller and Chad I Ginsburg, as well as skateboarders Tony Hawk, Brandon Novak, and Mike Vallely. Bam&#x27;s uncle Vincent (aka Don Vito) starred in the fourth video. Jenn Rivell&#x27;s daughter is also seen in some clips.

The &quot;CKY&quot; videos brought Bam and his friends to the attention of Jeff Tremaine who drafted them into the cast of &quot;Jackass&quot; which aired for three seasons on MTV, from 2000 until 2001. Most &quot;Jackass&quot; skits featuring the CKY crew were lifted from previously released &quot;CKY&quot; material or were recorded by the crew in West Chester, Pennsylvania, while the Los Angeles-based faction of the &quot;Jackass&quot; team featuring Johnny Knoxville, Chris Pontius, Wee Man, Dave England, Preston Lacy, Ehren McGhehey, and Steve-O filmed in California.

A subsequent MTV spin-off, entitled &quot;Viva La Bam&quot; (2003–2006), followed Bam Margera and his crew as they tortured Bam&#x27;s family, and generally wreaked havoc in West Chester, and around the world. Another spin-off, titled &quot;Bam&#x27;s Unholy Union&quot; (2007), featured Bam planning his wedding with some of the CKY crew members. A one-episode Spike TV special, titled &quot;Bam&#x27;s World Domination&quot;, featured Bam, Dunn, and skateboarder Tim O&#x27;Connor participating in the Tough Guy Competition in Perton, Staffordshire, England. This special aired two days before &quot;Jackass 3D&quot; (2010) was released.

Ryan Dunn also had his own spin-off TV show, titled &quot;Homewrecker&quot;. To qualify for &quot;Homewrecker&quot;, a participant had to submit to the show a story of how he or she was victimized by one of their friends. Each segment opened with the &quot;victim&quot; explaining to Dunn what happened to them. Dunn then observed the offender to get additional ideas on what to do. Finally, Dunn and a team of helpers helped the participant redo their friend&#x27;s room to fit what the evildoer had done to them. It aired on MTV in 2005.

A one-episode MTV special, titled &quot;Blastazoid&quot;, featured Brandon DiCamillo, and Rake Yohn, creating a &quot;live action Donkey Kong&quot;, based on the 1981 video game with the same name. It also features stunts and pranks similar to the &quot;CKY&quot; videos. It aired in 2006.

A spin-off movie, titled &quot;&quot;, was released in 2003. A loose sequel to this movie, titled &quot;&quot;, came out in 2009.

Bam also hosted his own radio show, &quot;Radio Bam&quot; on Sirius XM, which aired from 2004 to 2013. The show&#x27;s cast originally starred Bam, his brother Jess, Brandon DiCamillo, Brandon Novak, Rake Yohn, and Joe Frantz. It featured guest appearances from Ryan Dunn, Raab Himself, Bam&#x27;s parents and uncle, Bam&#x27;s then-wife Missy Rothstein, the CKY band members, and some &quot;Jackass&quot; cast members.

== &quot;CKY&quot; ==
Landspeed presents: CKY, the first film in the series, was released on March 1, 1999, featuring Bam Margera and Brandon DiCamillo on the cover. The name &quot;Landspeed&quot; comes from Landspeed Wheels, the wheel company created by Rob Erickson and distributed by Tod Swank through Tum Yeto Inc. Landspeed made skateboard wheels and clothing from 1998 to 2000. The name &quot;CKY&quot; comes from Jess Margera&#x27;s band. The video shows a mixed up variety of random, homemade, crazy humor, and mostly focuses on stunts, pranks, and crazy behavior, as well as skateboarding. The music features original songs by the band CKY, including &quot;96 Quite Bitter Beings&quot;.

=== Differences between the VHS and DVD versions ===

*The copyright was taken off because it has Tum Yeto references.
*In the opening credits, the Landspeed title was taken off.
*A scene was also removed. It featured Brandon DiCamillo running around a Christmas parade as Santa Claus, because the real Santa was late. No one at the parade except for Bam and his crew knew that Brandon wasn&#x27;t involved with the parade.
* In the Round 1 version of &quot;CKY&quot;, there are clips removed, not only the Santa clip, but things such as bits and pieces and extended skits, and to make up for that it has more extra footage at the end than before.
*Some skits in the DVD version are edited or cut short. Such as, Bam sings two Bon Jovi songs in the street to strangers in the VHS version (they cut one of them in the DVD version).

=== CKY Documentary ===
CKY Documentary is a compilation of footage from the first &quot;CKY&quot; video. It is in a double pack on the &quot;CKY Trilogy Round One&quot; DVD and CKY the box set (quadruple pack) DVD and show profiles of each member of the CKY crew, including some older skits from when Bam Margera was in high school and the story of how &quot;CKY&quot; was created. It is entirely in black and white.

== &quot;CKY2K&quot; ==

CKY2K, the second film in the series, was released on May 22, 2000, featuring Rake Yohn on the cover. The video features a trip to Iceland, the rental car, a baseball game, &quot;Bran&#x27;s Freestyle&quot;, and other random items. The music features early versions of &quot;Flesh into Gear&quot; and &quot;Sporadic Movement&quot; by CKY; as well as many other artists, including an opening scene with Rammstein, Iceland scenes with Björk and Orbital, and a skateboarding scene with Believer &quot;Dies Irae (Day of Wrath)&quot; and Aphex Twin.

Near the end of the video, there is a scene in which a minor exposes his genitalia in front of a public restaurant. The video explained that &quot;this is what happens when you tell Bam you&#x27;ll do anything to be in CKY.&quot; In 2003, the parents of the minor sued. During the hearing, a County Court Judge ruled that images of the plaintiff &quot;must be deleted from future versions&quot; of the video. Subsequently, &quot;CKY2K&quot; was discontinued due (in part) to copyright issues. The first major issue was from Björk.

=== Iceland ===
The video was notable for the documentary of their trip to Iceland. The music features &quot;Hyperballad&quot; by Björk where Bam Margera and the crew hang out on the top of a mountain with gorgeous views from the top.

As they stayed in a hotel somewhere in Iceland (the hotel at the airport), Brandon DiCamillo smeared feces on Ryan Dunn while he was sleeping on the bed. Smeared with feces, Dunn fought back by urinating on DiCamillo sleeping on the floor. Later, they discuss the incident while traveling by car.

The crew performs a variety of stunts, including guys riding on furniture on the road as a sled, featuring music by Orbital playing &quot;Halcyon + On + On&quot;. Later, Bam was outside Björk&#x27;s house calling her.

=== The rental car ===

Bam drives a Chevrolet Cavalier after paying $9 for extra insurance. With the car, Bam Margera attempts crazy reckless driving maneuvers, knocking over orange cones and skidding turns. The next day, Rake Yohn finished off the already damaged car by setting fire to the radio, which completely burned the entire car. The music features an early version of &quot;Sporadic movement&quot; by the band CKY.

=== Differences between the VHS and DVD versions ===
* The warnings were taken off from the beginning of the VHS version, and used in the beginning of the DVD menu, which then shows Bam playing with HIM.
* A small note at the end of &quot;Bran&#x27;s Freestyle&quot; by CKY, and featured some clips after the credits, showing Bam Margera filming for &quot;seven teen sips&quot;, which includes a short preview of his film at the very end of the video. In the DVD version, the end credits were cut short and instead played &quot;One Last Time&quot; by HIM and featured alternate footage, including more furniture sledding and Bam commanding his father Phil to do push-ups.

== &quot;CKY3&quot; ==

CKY3, the third film in the series, was released in 2001, featuring Bam Margera and his father Phil on the cover. Soon after its release, Margera and DiCamillo were sued over the fight scene involving Mike Vallely. The issue was settled out of court in 2006. It was also the first of the videos to be taken off the market due to copyright restrictions. Some of the musicians (or their legal representation) were unhappy with Margera using their music without their permission. This would later happen with &quot;CKY2K&quot; and the box set including all three videos and the documentary.

== &quot;CKY4: The Latest &amp; Greatest&quot; ==
CKY 4, the fourth and final film in the series, was released on November 10, 2002, featuring Ryan Dunn rolling off a roof in a barrel with Bam Margera recording on the cover. It has a marked improvement in editing techniques compared to the other films, mostly due to Bam Margera&#x27;s newly acquired wealth and ability to purchase motion picture film cameras and use advanced post-production facilities. However, it also features a lot of older video material, some unseen, some extended and some off-cuts from previous &quot;CKY&quot; films. Scenes include Don Vito&#x27;s &quot;50 Shots of Peach Schnapps&quot; as a bonus feature.

&quot;CKY4&quot; is the only &quot;CKY&quot; video to be censored, and one of the few DVDs to have been censored three times.
*A DVD Easter egg showed Bam Margera and his then-girlfriend mid-coitus with altered color mixes to avoid nudity. This wasn&#x27;t the first time &quot;CKY&quot; videos had attracted trouble of this sort, but none of the previous videos cut legal sexually themed scenes until this one, in mid-2003. The scene is only available on the first 5,000 copies.
*In 2002, Brandon DiCamillo and CKY drummer Jess Margera wrote a rap about Masters of the Universe characters Skeletor and Beast Man engaging in extreme homosexual behavior, called Skeletor vs Beastman. Mattel, owners of the Masters of the Universe franchise, heard about the rap, and were displeased. Margera was sent a cease-and-desist letter, and subsequent editions of the DVD have replaced this video with skateboarding footage.
*CKY guitarist Chad I Ginsburg, a fan of punk rocker G.G. Allin, visited his grave one day and after consuming an entire bottle of Jim Beam bourbon (Allin&#x27;s favorite beverage), he proceeded to urinate on the grave and left an autographed copy of &quot;Infiltrate.Destroy.Rebuild.&quot;, which was later stolen. Mixed in between the grave footage is CKY performing Allin&#x27;s song &quot;Bite It, You Scum&quot;.
*At the end of the &quot;lil key key&quot; Raab Himself&#x27;s skit, there was an Easter egg that was also cut in 2003 for unknown reasons.

== &quot;CKY: The Greatest Hits&quot; ==

On November 2, 2014, MTV premiered a special in dedication of the &quot;CKY&quot; videos, featuring new interviews of the crew, as well as unreleased footage documenting the series as a whole. The special was directed by former CKY cinematographer Joe Frantz.

== High definition re-releases ==

Joe Frantz announced on a 2011 episode of &quot;Radio Bam&quot; that he was set to remaster the &quot;CKY&quot; series in HD. He stated the same will be done with &quot;&quot; and &quot;Minghags&quot;. On January 19, 2014, Frantz gave an update on the project via his Facebook page, stating:
On December 2, 2018, Frantz gave an official update on the project, stating that production is now underway. The remasters released from March 14 to April 25 on the now-defunct streaming service DCTV. On May 15, 2021, Frantz announced on his Instagram and Twitter accounts that he will be uploading the HD re-releases for free on YouTube.

<doc id="1192602" wikidata="Q8008459" url="?curid=1192602" title="William Edward Sanders">
<text>William Edward Sanders (7 February 1883 – 14 August 1917) was a First World War New Zealand recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot; that could be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces at the time.

Born in Auckland, Sanders took up a seafaring career in 1899. He initially worked aboard steamships before transferring to sailing ships to enhance his career prospects. Sanders earned a master&#x27;s certificate in late 1914, following the outbreak of the First World War. He then served aboard troopships in the Merchant Navy until April 1916, when he was commissioned in the Royal Naval Reserve. He completed his military training in the United Kingdom, after which he served aboard &quot;Helgoland&quot;, a Q-ship that operated against German submarines. His performance on his first two patrols earned him his own command, , in February 1917.

Sanders was awarded the VC for his actions while on his first patrol as captain, when &quot;Prize&quot; engaged and drove off a German U-boat that had earlier attacked and damaged his ship. He was killed in action during &quot;Prize&quot; fourth patrol when a U-boat sank his ship. His VC, the first and only such medal to be awarded to a New Zealander serving with a naval force, was presented to his father and is held by the Auckland War Memorial Museum. There are several tributes to Sanders, including the Sanders Memorial Cup, a sailing trophy for yachts.

==Early life==
William Edward Sanders was born in the Auckland suburb of Kingsland on 7 February 1883. His father, Edward Helman Cook Sanders, was a bootmaker, who with his wife Emma Jane Sanders (née Wilson), had three more children. William&#x27;s maternal grandfather was a sea captain and worked for the family&#x27;s shipping company.

Sanders attended Nelson Street School until 1894, when his family moved to Takapuna. He shifted to Takapuna School, which was close to Lake Pupuke, where he learned to sail. He earned the nickname &quot;Gunner Billy&quot; for his exploits with a small cannon that a classmate brought to school. He left school at the age of 15 and, at the urging of his parents, was apprenticed to a mercer in Auckland&#x27;s Queen Street. He was not particularly interested in the trade and, desiring a career at sea, would go down to the wharves to inspect the berthed ships and chat with their captains and crewmen.

In 1899, Sanders became aware of a vacancy for a cabin boy aboard &quot;Kapanui&quot;, a steamer that worked the coast north of Auckland. An officer on the ship was an acquaintance and had given Sanders the tip that a position was available. Sanders promptly applied to join the vessel and was the successful applicant. He remained with the company that operated &quot;Kapanui&quot; for three years. In 1902 he joined &quot;Aparima&quot;, operated by the Union Steam Ship Company, which traded between New Zealand and India. In 1906, as an ordinary seaman, he transferred to , a government steamer servicing lighthouses along the New Zealand coast and depots on offshore islands.

With his seafaring career to date spent working on steamships, Sanders decided to gain experience under sail with the Craig Line. At the time, steam was looked down upon by seafarers, sailors being regarded as more skillful. From 1910, Sanders sailed on a series of vessels and by 1914, after taking his mate&#x27;s certificates, he was mate of the barque &quot;Joseph Craig&quot;. On 7 August 1914, the ship foundered on the Hokianga bar and Sanders took charge of a small boat to seek help. He appeared at the inquest held at Auckland into her sinking, the blame for which was placed on the master.

==First World War==
During the early part of the First World War, Sanders worked as second mate on &quot;Moeraki&quot;. He also sat for his master&#x27;s certificate, passing with honours on 7 November 1914. He was discharged from &quot;Moeraki&quot; in December and applied for the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR). However, he was not called up and in the interim served as a Merchant Navy officer on the troopships &quot;Willochra&quot; and &quot;Tofua&quot;. After Sanders&#x27; repeated pleas to authorities, eventually in June 1915 the New Zealand High Commissioner wrote to the Admiralty in support of his efforts to join the RNR. This advocacy was presumably successful for in December 1915 he found passage on a steamer bound to Glasgow via the Atlantic. He reached the United Kingdom on 17 April 1916 and made his way to London where, two days after his arrival, he was appointed an acting sub-lieutenant in the RNR.

After completing a three-month junior officer&#x27;s course at the training facility HMS &quot;Excellent&quot; on Whale Island, Sanders was granted a position on &quot;Helgoland&quot;, a Q-ship operating against German submarines in the Western Approaches. Q-ships were merchant ships crewed by Navy personnel and bearing hidden weaponry. When attacked by U-boats, a portion of the ship&#x27;s crew (referred to as a &quot;panic party&quot;) would appear to evacuate the vessel, sometimes setting smoke fires to simulate damage. This would encourage its attacker to approach and when the U-boat was close enough, the Q-ship&#x27;s guns would be revealed and open fire on the approaching submarine.

&quot;Helgoland&quot; was a Dutch brigantine armed with 12-pounder guns and a machine gun. Sanders, second in command to fellow New Zealander Lieutenant A. D. Blair, helped oversee its conversion to a Q-ship. On its first patrol in September 1916, his ship participated in two actions against U-boats and, on its second the following month, it again encountered U-boats on two occasions. During the first engagement, &quot;Helgoland&quot; was becalmed due to lack of wind, without engines and extremely vulnerable. With limited manoeuvrability and with the attacking U-boat content to fire on the ship from a distance, &quot;Helgoland&quot; was forced to reveal its identity early in the action. The U-boat was able to get away but not without first firing two torpedoes which passed harmlessly under &quot;Helgoland&quot;. In the second engagement, &quot;Helgoland&quot; came to the assistance of a steamer being attacked by a U-boat. In doing so, Sanders had to expose himself to gunfire in order to remove a jammed screen obscuring the ship&#x27;s gun.

===HMS &quot;Prize&quot;===

Sanders&#x27; conduct on &quot;Helgoland&quot; resulted in a promotion to lieutenant, and he was also recommended for command of his own ship. In early 1917, he was appointed captain of , a three-masted topsail schooner that was sailing under the German flag when it was the first enemy ship to be seized by the British after the outbreak of the First World War. Originally sold by the Admiralty to a shipping company, it was later offered to the Royal Navy for use as a decoy vessel and converted to a Q-ship in early 1917. This involved the addition of diesel engines, radio equipment and armament, including two 12-pounder guns; one was inside a collapsible deckhouse while the other was on a platform that was raised from the hold. A pair of Lewis guns and a Maxim machine gun were also fitted.

The conversion work on &quot;Prize&quot; was carried out near Falmouth and Sanders arrived there in mid-April 1917 to supervise the final stages of the work and fitting out of the ship. &quot;Prize&quot; was formally commissioned into the Royal Navy a few days later, on 25 April, with a crew of 27, including Sanders. It departed for its first patrol the next day. In the evening of 30 April, near the Isles of Scilly in the Atlantic, &quot;Prize&quot; was attacked by a U-boat, , commanded by &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Edgar von Spiegel von und zu Peckelsheim. The Q-ship was badly damaged by shellfire from the U-boat&#x27;s deck gun. Sanders, having dispatched the panic party to a small boat, remained under cover with the rest of his men. Despite several of them being wounded, the crew remained in place to maintain the façade of an abandoned ship.

After 20 minutes of shelling, &quot;Prize&quot; appeared to the Germans to be sinking. The U-boat approached her port quarter, whereupon Sanders ordered the White Ensign hoisted and &quot;Prize&quot; opened fire. Within a few minutes the submarine had received severe damage to her conning tower (pictured), with several crew members blown into the water. After moving away, the U-boat disappeared from sight in mist, and was believed by the crew of &quot;Prize&quot; to have been sunk. The panic party, still in its boat, collected three survivors, including the captain of the U-boat, and brought them back to &quot;Prize&quot;. The damage to the ship was serious, and the German prisoners assisted in repairs as it made for the Irish coast and received a tow as it approached Kinsale. In the meantime, &quot;U-93&quot; managed to struggle back to the island of Sylt, near the German coast, nine days later.

While &quot;Prize&quot; was being repaired, the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, offered Sanders command of a destroyer of his choosing, which he declined. Preferring to remain in his current role, Sanders returned to sea in late May with &quot;Prize&quot; conducting a second patrol for three weeks. Sanders was wounded slightly in the arm during an action on 12 June, in which &quot;Prize&quot; encountered another German submarine, , on the surface. It was fired at 30 times by the U-boat as it approached. Once Sanders gave the order to fire, the U-boat turned away. Only a few shots from &quot;Prize&quot; were fired and the U-boat quickly submerged and got away.

After being repaired, &quot;Prize&quot; undertook another patrol in late June and early July. On 22 June, while Sanders was at sea, his award of the Victoria Cross (VC) for his actions on 30 April was gazetted. The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest award for valour that could be bestowed on members of the military of the British Empire. All of the crew present on 30 April received awards; Sanders&#x27; lieutenant received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), two other officers the Distinguished Service Cross, and the rest of the crew was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. Sanders was also promoted to lieutenant commander. Because the use of Q-ships such as &quot;Prize&quot; was still secret, the particulars of the action leading to the awards made to Sanders and his crew were not made publicly available. Instead, the published details of his VC when it was gazetted simply read:

===Final patrol===
Sanders, becoming increasingly fatigued from the stress of his duties, embarked on &quot;Prize&quot; for another patrol in early August 1917. Before he left, he made a request to be relieved of his command citing &quot;overstrain&quot;. The Admiralty approved a few days later but Sanders had already departed on patrol. Sailing into the Atlantic under a Swedish flag, the ship was accompanied by a British submarine, . It was intended that &quot;D6&quot; would submerge and observe &quot;Prize&quot; throughout the day. When an enemy ship was sighted, the crew of &quot;Prize&quot; would place discreet signals in the rigging to indicate the ship&#x27;s position to the watching &quot;D6&quot;. The submarine would then attempt to move into a position where it could torpedo the approaching enemy. On 13 August 1917, a lookout spotted . Sanders opted to use the guns of &quot;Prize&quot; to shell the German U-boat; &quot;UB-48&quot; was not damaged and it submerged to evade the attack. &quot;Prize&quot; and &quot;D6&quot; remained on station.

&quot;Oberleutnant&quot; , the captain of &quot;UB-48&quot;, was determined to sink &quot;Prize&quot; and stalked the ship. Soon it was dark and he surfaced his submarine and sighted a light in the distance. He believed that it was likely to be someone aboard &quot;Prize&quot; opening a porthole or lighting a pipe or cigarette. He launched two torpedoes, one of which struck &quot;Prize&quot; and exploded. Investigating what remained of &quot;Prize&quot; he found only wreckage and the body of a British sailor. The &quot;D6&quot;, still nearby, heard the explosion of the torpedo. At dawn on 14 August, &quot;D6&quot; surfaced but no trace was found of &quot;Prize&quot; or her crew and it was presumed that she had been sunk.

==Medals and legacy==

Sanders, a bachelor, died without knowledge of the award of a DSO for his actions during the engagement with &quot;UC-35&quot; on 12 June 1917. He was also entitled to the British War Medal, the Mercantile Marine War Medal and the Victory Medal. In June 1918, Sanders&#x27; father received his son&#x27;s VC and DSO from the Earl of Liverpool, the Governor-General of New Zealand, in a ceremony at the Auckland Town Hall. Sander&#x27;s VC, the first and only one awarded to a New Zealander serving with a naval force, and DSO are on display at the Auckland War Memorial Museum. The museum also holds a framed exhibit of photographs of Sanders and his citations that was originally presented to Takapuna Primary School, his old school, by Earl Jellicoe in September 1919.

Sanders is remembered in a number of ways, including by a bronze tablet in the church at Milford Haven, the home port of &quot;Prize&quot;, a plaque in the Auckland Town Hall, and &quot;The Sanders Memorial Scholarship&quot; at the University of Auckland for children of members of the Royal Navy or the Mercantile Marine. His name is on one of the gravestones in the family plot in Purewa Cemetery in Meadowbank. In 1921, the Sanders Memorial Cup, named in his honour, was established for competition between yachts. Sanders Avenue in Takapuna is named after him. Each year, cadets from the Training Ship &quot;Leander&quot; hold a memorial parade in commemoration of Sanders. William Sanders Retirement Village at Devonport is also named after him.

<text>Richard Douglas Sandford, VC (11 May 1891 – 23 November 1918) was a Royal Navy officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was a son of the Venerable Ernest Grey Sandford, Archdeacon of Exeter; his great-grandfather was Daniel Sandford, the Bishop of Edinburgh, and his brother was Brigadier Daniel Sandford.

Richard Sandford attended Clifton College whence he joined the Royal Navy. At 26 years old, he was a lieutenant commanding a submarine, HMS C3 in the Royal Navy during the First World War when he took part in the Zeebrugge Raid and won the Victoria Cross. The citation read: 
Sandford died of typhoid fever at Eston Hospital, North Yorkshire, 12 days after the signing of the Armistice, and the day after his last command, HMS &quot;G11&quot;, had been wrecked on rocks off Howick, Northumberland; his Victoria Cross is displayed at the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth.

<text>The All Red Line was a system of electrical telegraphs that linked much of the British Empire. It was inaugurated on 31 October 1902. The informal name derives from the common practice of colouring the territory of the British Empire red or pink on political maps.

==Construction==

The first transatlantic cable connected Ireland and Newfoundland in 1858, although it later failed. In 1866, the laid out a lasting link from Waterville, County Kerry and nearby Valentia Island, in Ireland, to Heart&#x27;s Content, Newfoundland.

By 1870, Suez was linked to Bombay, and from there to Madras, Penang, and Singapore. Australia was linked to British telegraph cables directly in 1871, by extending a line from Singapore to Port Darwin, although it ran through the Dutch territory of Java. By 1872, messages could be sent direct from London to Adelaide and Sydney. Australia was linked to New Zealand by cable in 1876.

To complete the All Red Line, therefore, the final major cable laying project was the trans-Pacific section. A resolution supporting such a project was passed by the First Colonial Conference in 1887 and more detailed plans were approved at the 1894 Colonial Conference in Ottawa which was called specifically on the topic of the cable project. The &quot;Pacific Cable Committee&quot; was formed in 1896 to consider the proposal and in 1901 the Pacific Cable Board was formed with eight members: Three from Britain, two from Canada, two from Australia and one from New Zealand. Funding for the project was shared between the British, Canadian, New Zealand, New South Wales, Victorian and Queensland governments. In 1902 the &quot;Colonia&quot;, a newly-built cable vessel, began laying the 8,000 tonnes of cable needed to complete the Bamfield, British Columbia, to Fanning Island section of the cable. The final cost was around £2 million.

Originally, the British government felt the All Red system should have sea-landings only on British-controlled soil for security purposes. Due to this, Britain actively sought to acquire Fanning Island (now Tabuaeran in Kiribati) to use for a midpoint power regeneration / relay station between Western Canada and Australia on the trans-Pacific Ocean branch of the system. Fanning Island was annexed to the British Empire in 1888.

==Completion==
The Committee on Imperial Defence reported in 1911 that the All Red Line was complete. The network had so many redundancies that 49 cuts would be needed to isolate the United Kingdom; 15 for Canada; and 5 for South Africa. Many colonies such as South Africa and India also had many land lines. Britain also possessed the majority of the world&#x27;s underwater-telegraph deployment and repair equipment and expertise, and a monopoly of the gutta-percha insulation for underwater lines.

The 1911 report stated that the Imperial Wireless Chain should only be a &quot;valuable reserve&quot; to the All Red Line, because enemies could interrupt or intercept radio messages. Despite its great cost, the telegraph network succeeded in its purpose: British communications remained uninterrupted during the First World War, while Britain quickly succeeded in cutting Germany&#x27;s worldwide network.

The Pacific Cable Board laid a duplicate cable between Canada and New Zealand between 1923 and 1926, using the cable-laying ships &quot;Dominia&quot; and &quot;Faraday&quot;.

==Commonwealth Telegraph Agreement==
In the final years of the British Empire, with a number of states federated or close to independence, a treaty with clearer financial divisions, responsibilities, and governance was established that would eventually replace the Pacific Cable Board. A treaty &quot;Commonwealth Telegraph Agreement&quot; was signed between Commonwealth nations in London, 1948 that formed the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation.

<doc id="1192626" wikidata="Q374009" url="?curid=1192626" title="Geography of Montenegro">
<text>Montenegro (; lit. &quot;Black Mountain&quot;) is a small, mountainous country in Southeast Europe. It borders Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Kosovo, Albania and the Adriatic Sea. While being a small country at , it is very diverse regarding the terrain configuration. Montenegro has 50 peaks of over in altitude.

== Terrain ==
Terrain in Montenegro ranges from high mountains in the northern part of the country, through karst segment in central and western part, to almost of a narrow coastal plain. The coastal plain disappears completely in the north, where Mount Lovćen and other mountain ranges plunge abruptly into the inlet of the Gulf of Kotor. The coastal region is noted for active seismicity.

Montenegro&#x27;s section of the karst lies generally at elevations of above sea level-although some areas rise to . The lowest segment is in the valley of the Zeta River, which flows at an elevation ranging from to . The river occupies the centre of Nikšić field, a flat-floored, elongated depression typical of karstic regions. The underlying rock is predominantly limestone, which dissolves to form sinkholes and caves. The longest cave in Montenegro is Vražji firovi - 10,5 km long cave north-east from Berane, and the deepest sinkhole is Željezna jama -1027 m on mount Maganik.

The Zeta River Valley, or Bjelopavlići plain, merges in the southeast with the second significant flat lowland in Montenegro, the Zeta plain. Zeta plain stretches north of the Lake Scutari at elevation of . The two plains are today the most densely populated areas of Montenegro, housing the two biggest Montenegrin cities, Podgorica and Nikšić.

The high mountains of Montenegro include some of the most rugged terrain in Europe. They average more than in elevation. Among notable peaks is Bobotov Kuk in the Durmitor mountain, which reaches . The Montenegrin mountains were the most ice-eroded section of the Balkan Peninsula during the last glacial period.

=== Coast ===

The coast of Montenegro is long. Unlike its northern neighbour Croatia, Montenegro has no large inhabited islands along the coast. A notable feature of the Montenegrin coast is Bay of Kotor, a fjord-like gulf, which is in fact a submerged river canyon. The Bay of Kotor is surrounded by mountains up to high, which plunge almost vertically into the sea.

To the south of the Bay of Kotor, there is a narrow coastal plain, no more than 4 km wide, which is guarded from the north by high mountains. The plain provided space for numerous small coastal settlements.

=== Hydrology ===
Montenegro&#x27;s surface runoff in the north is carried away by the Lim and Tara river systems, which enter the Danube via the Drina River of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In southern Montenegro, streams flow toward the Adriatic Sea. Much of the drainage of the karstic region is not on the surface but travels in underground channels.

The largest lake in Montenegro and the Balkans is Lake Scutari. Known in Montenegro as &quot;Skadarsko Jezero&quot;, it lies near the coast and extends across the international border into northern Albania. It is long and wide, with a total surface area of . Some 60 percent lies within Montenegrin territory. The water body occupies a karstic polje depression that has a floor lying below sea level.

Montenegro&#x27;s mountainous regions are noted for their numerous lakes.

<text>Major General Euston Henry Sartorius (6 June 1844 – 19 February 1925) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. His brother Reginald was also awarded the VC.

==Life==
Sartorius was educated at Victoria College, Jersey, then the Royal Naval School, New Cross. He then decided on an army career and attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, followed by the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. In 1862 he joined the 59th (2nd Nottinghamshire) Regiment of Foot as an ensign. In June 1869 at Broadstairs he rescued three girls from drowning, for which he received the Bronze Medal of the Royal Humane Society. 

In the 1870s, he spent four years as military surveying instructor at Sandhurst, and then travelled for a year overland, via Persia, to India to rejoin his regiment. When the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878–80) broke out, the 59th Foot formed part of the southern Afghanistan Field Force, serving in and around Kandahar. In October 1879 Sartorius was part of a British advance upon a large Ghilzais force assembling at Shahjui. Under fire from British artillery, the Ghilzais retreated, taking refuge in an old hill-top fort. Sartorius won his VC for leading a small force that captured this fort.

===VC action===
Sartorius was a 35 year old captain in the 59th (2nd Nottinghamshire) Regiment of Foot (later The East Lancashire Regiment), British Army, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War when the following deed took place on 24 October 1879 at Shahjui, Afghanistan for which he was awarded the VC:
For his Afghan service, he was also made brevet major, and twice mentioned in dispatches.

===Later career===
Due to wounds received during his VC action, Sartorius partially lost the use of his left hand. Unable to continue as an active field officer, he was appointed to a staff post at Aldershot. In the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War he was made deputy assistant adjutant-general and quartermaster-general, responsible for base and communications. For this, he was made brevet lieutenant-colonel, mentioned in dispatches, and received the fourth-class Order of Osmanieh. He became a colonel in 1886, and was assistant adjutant-general in Portsmouth from 1891 to 1894. In 1896 he was made a companion of the Order of the Bath, and went to Japan as military attaché. After promotion to major general in 1899, he retired in August 1901 but continued as colonel of the South Lancashire Regiment in November 1909, taking over from Major General Sir Frederick Solly-Flood.

In retirement he lived at Holmbury St Mary, Surrey, and in London. Following a short illness he died at his residence in Chelsea, London, on 19 February 1925. He was buried at St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s Churchyard, Ewhurst, Surrey.

==Family==
His father was Admiral of the Fleet Sir George Rose Sartorius. He had two elder brothers, both of whom also entered the army: George Conrad Sartorius, who retired as a colonel, and Major General Reginald William Sartorius, who was also awarded the VC. One of Victoria College Jersey&#x27;s five Houses was later named &#x27;Sartorius&#x27; after the three brothers, all of whom attended the school.

He succeeded his father as Count of Penhafirme in the Portuguese nobility, and was confirmed in the title by King Carlos I on 20 June 1903. On 22 December 1874 he married Emily Jane, daughter of Sir Francis Cook, 1st Viscount of Monserrate; their son Euston Francis Frederick Sartorius was born in 1882 and served in the Grenadier Guards.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is held by the National Army Museum, Chelsea, London.

<doc id="1192640" wikidata="Q892171" url="?curid=1192640" title="Tripartite alignment">
<text>In linguistic typology, tripartite alignment is a type of morphosyntactic alignment in which the main argument (&#x27;subject&#x27;) of an intransitive verb, the agent argument (&#x27;subject&#x27;) of a transitive verb, and the patient argument (&#x27;direct object&#x27;) of a transitive verb are each treated distinctly in the grammatical system of a language. This is in contrast with nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive alignment languages, in which the argument of an intransitive verb patterns with either the agent argument of the transitive (in accusative languages) or with the patient argument of the transitive (in ergative languages). Thus, whereas in English, &quot;she&quot; in &quot;she runs&quot; patterns with &quot;she&quot; in &quot;she finds it&quot;, and an ergative language would pattern &quot;she&quot; in &quot;she runs&quot; with &quot;her&quot; in &quot;he likes her&quot;, a tripartite language would treat the &quot;she&quot; in &quot;she runs&quot; as morphologically and/or syntactically distinct from either argument in &quot;he likes her&quot;.

Which languages constitute genuine examples of a tripartite case alignment is a matter of debate; however, Wangkumara, Nez Perce, Ainu, Vakh Khanty, Semelai, Kalaw Lagaw Ya, Kham, and Yazghulami have all been claimed to demonstrate tripartite structure in at least some part of their grammar. While tripartite alignments are rare in natural languages, they have proven popular in constructed languages, notably the Na&#x27;vi language featured in 2009&#x27;s &quot;Avatar&quot;.

In languages with morphological case, a tritransitive alignment typically marks the agent argument of a transitive verb with an ergative case, the patient argument of a transitive verb with the accusative case, and the argument of an intransitive verb with an intransitive case.

== Tripartite, Ergative and Accusative systems ==
A tripartite language does not maintain any syntactic or morphological equivalence (such as word order or grammatical case) between the core argument of intransitive verbs and either core argument of transitive verbs. In full tripartite alignment systems, this entails the agent argument of intransitive verbs always being treated differently from each of the core arguments of transitive verbs, whereas for mixed system intransitive alignment systems this may only entail that certain classes of noun are treated differently between these syntactic positions.

The arguments of a verb are usually symbolized as follows:

* A = &#x27;agent&#x27; argument of a transitive verb (traditional transitive subject)
* O = &#x27;patient&#x27; argument of a transitive verb (traditional transitive object)
* S = argument of an intransitive verb (traditional intransitive subject)

The relationship between accusative, ergative, and tripartite alignments can be schematically represented as follows:

&quot;See morphosyntactic alignment for a more technical explanation.&quot;

The term &#x27;subject&#x27; has been found to be problematic when applied to languages which have any morphosyntactic alignment other than nominative-accusative, and hence, reference to the &#x27;agent&#x27; argument of transitive sentences is preferred to the term &#x27;subject&#x27;.

== Types of tripartite systems ==
Languages may be designated as tripartite languages in virtue of having either a full tripartite morphosyntactic alignment, or in virtue of having a mixed system which results in tripartite treatment of one or more specific classes of nouns.

=== Full tripartite systems ===
A full tripartite system distinguishes between S, A and O arguments in all classes of nominals. It has been claimed that Wangkumara has the only recorded full tripartite alignment system.

==== Example ====

Wangkumara consistently differentiates marking on S, A, and O arguments in the morphology, as demonstrated in example (1) below:

In the above example, the intransitive case in (a) is glossed NOM, in accordance with Breen&#x27;s original transcription. Across (1), we see differential case suffixes for each of intransitive (NOM), ergative (ERG), and accusative (ACC) case.

The same tripartite distinction is clear in the pronominal system:



In the above examples, we see the first person singular pronoun taking different forms for each of the S, A, and O arguments (marked NOM, ERG and ABS respectively), indicating the tripartite alignment in pronominal morphology.

Syntactic surveys of Wangkumara suggest this is generally true of the language as a whole. Hence, Wangkumara represents a case of a full tripartite alignment.

=== Mixed systems ===
More common than full tripartite systems, mixed system tripartite alignments either demonstrate tripartite alignment in some subsection of the grammar, or else lacks the ergative, the accusative, or both in some classes of nominals. An example of the former kind of mixed system may be Yazghulami, which exhibits tripartite alignment but only in the past tense. An example of the latter would be Nez Perce, which lacks ergative marking in the first and second person.

The following examples from Nez Perce illustrate the intransitive-ergative-accusative opposition that holds in the third person:

In the above examples, (2a) demonstrates the intransitive case marking (here coded as NOM), while (2b) demonstrates differential ergative and accusative markings. Thus, Nez Perce demonstrates tripartite differentiations in its third person morphology.

In Ainu, only first person inclusive and fourth person (first person plural exclusive / logographical / indefinite / etc.) display tripartite alignment as shown in the table.

== Realizations of tripartite alignment ==

=== Morphological tripartite alignment ===

=== Syntactic tripartite alignment ===

==== Passive and anti-passive constructions ====
Ainu also shows the passive voice formation typical of nominative-accusative languages and the antipassive of ergative-absolutive languages. Like Nez Percé, the use of both the passive and antipassive is a trait of a tripartite language.

== Distribution of tripartite alignments ==
=== Full tripartite alignments ===

=== Mixed systems ===

<text>The Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra was a jazz big band formed by trumpeter Thad Jones and drummer Mel Lewis in New York in 1965. The band performed for twelve years in its original incarnation, including a 1972 tour of the Soviet Union during the height of the Cold War. The collaboration ended in 1978 with Jones suddenly moving to Copenhagen, Denmark, after which the band became the Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra. Since the death of Lewis in 1990 it has been known as the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra. They have maintained a Monday-night residency at the Village Vanguard jazz club in New York for five decades. The band won Grammy Awards for the album &quot;Live in Munich&quot; in 1978 and for the album &quot;Monday Night Live at the Village Vanguard&quot; in 2009.

==History==
Thad Jones professionally played two instruments, the trumpet and cornet. His older brother was Hank Jones, a jazz pianist, and his younger brother was Elvin Jones, a jazz drummer. Thad Jones had worked as a professional since he was 16, when he played with Hank. After leaving the military in 1946, he performed with territory bands and later with Charles Mingus. From 1954–1963, he was a member of the Count Basie Orchestra, for whom he composed and arranged.

Mel Lewis, a jazz drummer, had been playing in big bands since he was 15, first with Boyd Raeburn, then Alvino Rey, Stan Kenton, Terry Gibbs, and Gerald Wilson. In 1961, he toured the Soviet Union with veteran big band leader Benny Goodman. After Lewis moved to New York City, he met Thad Jones and started the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra at the end of 1965. Beginning in February 1966, the band played every Monday night at the Village Vanguard. 
Since Lewis&#x27;s death in 1990, the band has been called the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra, continuing its tradition as the Village Vanguard&#x27;s house band.

The Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Orchestra was arguably the most influential big band since the swing era. Lewis brought a loose, small group style of drumming into the structure of a big band. His cymbal work became a hallmark of the Jones/Lewis Orchestra. Jones&#x27;s arrangements influenced later, large-ensemble composers, such as Maria Schneider, Bob Brookmeyer, Jim McNeely, and Bob Mintzer. The Jones/Lewis Orchestra was an unusual band, creating new styles, succeeding in an era when big bands were unpopular and remaining integrated during racially tense periods.

The band&#x27;s members included Bill Berry, Billy Harper, Bob Brookmeyer, Danny Stiles, Eddie Daniels, George Mraz, Hank Jones, Jerome Richardson, Jerry Dodgion, Jimmy Knepper, Joe Farrell, Jon Faddis, Marvin Stamm, Pepper Adams, Quentin Jackson, Richard Davis, Richard Williams, Roland Hanna, and Snooky Young.

<text>Major General Reginald William Sartorius (8 May 1841 – 8 August 1907) was an army officer, and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==

Educated at Victoria College, Jersey, Sartorius entered the Indian Army in January 1858. He joined the Bengal infantry, became a lieutenant in May 1858 and served in the Indian Mutiny (1858) and the Bhutan War (1864–65). In 1873, now a captain, Sartorius took part in the First Ashanti Expedition, in modern-day Ghana.

===VC action===
Sartorius was a 32 year old captain in the 6th Bengal Cavalry, British Indian Army, during the First Ashanti Expedition when the following deed took place at Abogu in the Ashanti Region, for which he was awarded the VC. His citation read:
For his Ashanti service, Sartorius was also twice mentioned in dispatches, promoted to brevet major, and made a companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.

===Later career===
Sartorius served in the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878–80) and in 1886 became a colonel. His active career came to an end in 1893, when he left India and went to live in Italy. In 1895 he was promoted to major-general, Bengal infantry, and in 1897 was placed on the retired list.

He retired to Haslemere, Surrey. He was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron, and died suddenly on 8 August 1907 when sailing at Cowes, Isle of Wight. He was buried St Mary&#x27;s Churchyard, South Baddesley, Hampshire.

==Family==
His father was Admiral of the Fleet Sir George Rose Sartorius. He had two brothers, both of whom entered the army: George Conrad Sartorius, who retired as a colonel, and Major General Euston Henry Sartorius, who was also awarded the VC.

In 1877 Sartorius married Agnes Maria Kemp. They had a son, who also served in the Indian Army, and a daughter.

One of Victoria College Jersey&#x27;s five Houses was later named &#x27;Sartorius&#x27; after the three brothers, all of whom attended the school.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is held by the National Army Museum, Chelsea, London.

<text>The Great Seal of the [[State of Colorado]] is an adaptation of the territorial seal which was adopted by the First Territorial Assembly on November 6, 1861. The only changes made to the territorial seal design being the substitution of the words &quot;State of Colorado&quot; and the figures &quot;1876&quot; for the corresponding inscriptions on the territorial seal. The first General Assembly of the State of Colorado approved the adoption of the state seal on March 15, 1877. The Colorado Secretary of State alone is authorized to affix the Great Seal of Colorado to any document whatsoever.

By statute, the seal of the state is two and one-half inches in diameter with the following devices inscribed thereon: At the top is the Eye of Providence or &quot;All Seeing Eye&quot; within a triangle, from which golden rays radiate on two sides. Below the eye is a Roman fasces, a bundle of birch or elm rods with a battle axe bound together with a ribbon of red, white and blue with the words, &quot;Union and Constitution&quot;. The bundle of rods bound together symbolizes strength which is lacking in the single rod. The axe symbolizes authority and leadership. Below the fasces is a heraldic shield bearing across the top a red sky behind three snow-capped mountains and clouds above them. The lower half of the shield has two miner&#x27;s tools, the pick and sledge hammer, crossed on a golden ground. Below the shield, on a scroll, is the motto &quot;Nil Sine Numine&quot;, Latin words meaning &quot;Nothing without providence&quot; or &quot;nothing without the Deity&quot;, and at the bottom the figures 1876, the year Colorado came into statehood.

The design for the territorial seal which served as a model for the state seal or Great Seal of Colorado has been variously credited, but the individual primarily responsible was Lewis Ledyard Weld, the territorial secretary, appointed by President Abraham Lincoln in July 1861. There is also evidence that Territorial Governor William Gilpin was also at least partially responsible for the design. Both Weld and Gilpin were knowledgeable in the art and symbolism of heraldry. Elements of design from both the Weld and Gilpin families’ coats of arms are incorporated in the territorial seal.

==Motto==
Nil sine numine is the state motto of Colorado. The Latin phrase appears to be an adaptation from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; where in Book II, line 777 the words &quot;...&quot;non haec sine numine devum eveniunt&quot;&quot; are found.

The Colorado Department of Personnel and Administration said about the translation of the motto:
:At recurring intervals, discussion has ensued concerning interpretation of this Latin phrase which commonly translated is &quot;&#x27;Nothing without providence&#x27;&quot;. Others say it is &quot;Nothing without God&quot;. The Merriam-Webster dictionary translates it as &quot;Nothing without the divine will&quot;. In the early mining days of the state, the unregenerate said it meant &quot;nothing without a new mine&quot;. The word &quot;&quot;numen&quot; (ablative &quot;numine&quot;) means any divinity, god or goddess, or divine spirit. The best evidence of intent of Colorado&#x27;s official designers and framers of the resolution for adoption of the seal is contained in the committee report wherein clear distinction was made between &quot;numine&quot; and &quot;Deo&quot;&quot; and it specifically states that the committee&#x27;s interpretative translation was &quot;Nothing without the Deity&quot;.

The motto appeared when Colorado&#x27;s first territorial governor, Gilpin, asked Secretary of the Territory L. L. Weld for a suitable motto for the state seal. According to the story, Weld said: &quot;Well, Governor, what would you suggest?&quot; Gilpin is said to have paused in thought for a moment and then responded &quot;&quot;Nil Sine Numine&quot;. On November 6, 1861 by joint resolution the First Territorial Assembly adopted the motto with the territorial seal.

&quot;Nil sine numine&quot; is the motto of the Weld family of Lulworth Castle in Dorset, England. The family are descended from Sir Humphrey Weld, Lord Mayor of London in 1601 and were notable as a recusant family prior to Catholic Emancipation in the 19th century. The Luttrell Psalter, a famous medieval manuscript dated to the 14th century, contains inside its binding an armorial bookplate of Thomas Weld (1750–1810), one of the book&#x27;s owners, and the motto on the plate&#x27;s ribbon reads &quot;nil sine numine&quot;&quot;.

The motto is also used by the Colorado School of Mines, an engineering university in Golden, Colorado, High Point University, a small liberal arts university in High Point, North Carolina, and by Virginia Intermont College, a liberal arts college in Bristol, Virginia.

==Coat of arms==

The Coat of Arms of the State of Colorado was implicitly defined by the legislation creating the &quot;Seal of the Territory of Colorado&quot; on November 11, 1861, and the &quot;Great Seal of the State of Colorado&quot; on March 15, 1877. It is seldom used, but maintained for historical interest.

<text>Sergeant Arthur Frederick Saunders VC (22 April 1878 – 30 July 1947) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==

He was born on 22 April 1878 in Ipswich one of 12 children of Thomas Saunders, a saddle and harness maker, and his wife Anne Victoria Clarke. The family then lived at 180 Cauldwell Hall Road in the parish of St John&#x27;s Church in Ipswich. He was baptised on 24 April. The family moved every few years and were certainly tenants, struggling to make ends meet. He attended St John&#x27;s Church of England Primary School in the town then California School in Ipswich.

==Navy==
In November 1893 Arthur joined The Marine Society Training Ship &quot;Warspite&quot;, which was moored at Woolwich, and began trining for the Merchant Navy. On 25 February 1895 he joined the Royal Navy as a Boy, 2nd Class, at just under age 17.

On 22 April 1896 (his 18th birthday), he signed-up for a continuous service engagement with the Royal Navy of 12 years, which he completed in 1908. He mainly served on HMS Pembroke then at the torpedo training school at HMS Vernon. During his time in the Royal Navy he served as a petty officer (2nd Class). After leaving the Royal Navy he worked for the agricultural equipment company Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jeffries.

==Army==

Arthur joined the Territorial Army and was attached as a reserve unit attached to the Suffolk Regiment. As such, at the outbreak of war, he (and all &quot;reservists&quot;) were required to go into full service at the onset of war. Therefore, on 19 September 1914 he officially transferred to full service in the British Army. He served in France with the 9th Battalion of the Suffolk Regiment, as a part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) from 30 August 1915.

His award came as a result of the Battle of Loos on the Western Front in September 1915. His battalion were supporting the advance of the Cameron Highlanders. He was 37 years old, and a sergeant in the 9th (Service) Battalion, Suffolk Regiment, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 26 September 1915 near Loos, France,

A statement from Lt Crispinson, an officer he assisted said: a shell landed and blew part of his (Arthur&#x27;s) left leg off, above the knee&quot;. A tourniquet was applied and he continued to fight, using a Lewis gun to hold back advancing German troops, some 150 in number. The Germans were somewhat surprised when this heavily injured man began to fire on them. The officer also then joined in the attack. The Germans retreated.

They were recovered by stretcher bearers from the Royal Engineers, but further shelling left them abandoned before eventually being brought to an Advanced Dressing Station by stretcher bearers from the Scots Guards. The Victoria Cross was announced on 30 March 1916, whilst still convalescing in hospital. It was the first VC to be awarded to the Suffolk Regiment so they were very proud of him. Lt Crispinson was awarded the Military Cross for his own part.

Common belief states that the wounds to his leg meant that it was amputated when he reached an Advanced Dressing Station. However, this is inaccurate. After medical attention and a period of convalescence his leg had become 3 inches shorter therefore he wore a medical boot to aid his walking. On account of his wounds he was returned to England, and received a hero&#x27;s welcome in his town home of Ipswich on 22 June 1916. He met the town&#x27;s mayor at the town hall with senior officers from his regiment. A collection held in his honour enabled him to purchase a house on Foxhall Road in the California district of east Ipswich.

He was presented with his Victoria Cross on 27 June 1916 by King George V at Buckingham Palace.

He was discharged from the army at the depot of the Suffolk Regiment on 13 November 1916. He was awarded the Silver War Badge on 5 December 1916. After the war he received the 1914-15 Star, British War Medal, and the Victory Medal, as complements to his Victoria Cross.

In 1920 he was given Freedom of the Burgh of Ipswich, and in 1923 was made a Justice of the Peace.

In 1939, Saunders worked as a drawing office clerk in Ransomes, Sims &amp; Jeffries lawn mower department. During the Second World War he served in the 11th Suffolk Home Guard.

Early in 1947 he was invited to a dinner in his honour in Glasgow by the Cameron Highlanders whose retreat he had protected back in 1915 at Loos. He was granted honorary membership of the regiment.

He died on 30 July 1947 of kidney problems, he was cremated and his ashes scattered in Ipswich Cemetery&#x27;s Garden of Rest.

==Legacy==
His VC was given to the Suffolk Regiment Museum in Bury St Edmunds by his widow in 1989.

A blue plaque was erected to Arthur at his 1914 home of 180 Cauldwell Hall Road in Ipswich in September 2010. A memorial also exists in the paving at Christchurch Park in Ipswich.

==Family==

On 6 December 1908 he married 18 year old Edith Muriel Everitt. Their son Thomas was born in 1909 Edward was born in 1912. His daughter Nina was born in 1923.

<doc id="1192664" wikidata="Q3907903" url="?curid=1192664" title="Pomponio Nenna">
<text>Pomponio Nenna (baptized 13 June 1556 – 25 July 1608) was a Neapolitan Italian composer of the Renaissance. He is mainly remembered for his madrigals, which were influenced by Gesualdo, and for his polychoral sacred motets, posthumously published as Sacrae Hebdomadae Responsoria in 1622.

== Life ==

Pomponio Nenna was born in Bari, in Apulia at the Kingdom of Naples. His father, Giovanni Battista Nenna, was a city official in Bari and was the author of &quot;&quot;Il Nennio : nel quale si ragiona di nobiltà&quot;, a book about nobility and virtuous character, published in 1542.

Pomponio Nenna probably studied with Stefano Felis in Bari. In 1574 his first pieces of music to be published were four villanelle which were included in the collections of &quot;Villanelle alla Napolitana&quot;&quot;, edited by Giovanni Jacopo de Antiquis, who may also have been one of Nenna&#x27;s teachers. In 1582 Nenna dedicated his first book of madrigals to Fabrizio Carafa, the Duke of Andria, near Bari. Carafa had nominated Nenna to be his successor. and is also the man found in flagrante delicto with the composer Don Carlo Gesualdo&#x27;s wife, both of whom were killed in 1590 by Gesualdo&#x27;s own hand in one of the most famous murders in the history of music. Nenna seems nonetheless to have been on terms of friendship with Gesualdo, and had dedicated music to him. As Gesualdo was also Prince of Venosa, this may have been the most prudent political stance for Nenna to assume.

Nenna worked at the court of Gesualdo between 1594 and 1599, at which time it was once thought that Gesualdo, himself an amateur composer, studied with Nenna; but more recent musicological study suggests that the influence may have gone the other way.

Nenna&#x27;s activities in the first decade of the 17th century are obscure, but he was probably in Naples from 1606 to 1607 and in Rome in 1608. A curious remark concerning his skilled participation in a chess game in Naples in 1606 is recorded in a manuscript book of discourses.

In April 1600, Leonora d&#x27;Este, the more fortunate second wife of Gesualdo, wrote a letter to her brother, then Cardinal Alessandro d&#x27;Este in Rome, in which she recommends Pomponio Nenna to him. Thus it may have been his d&#x27;Este family connections that enabled Nenna to establish himself profitably in Rome.

He died on 25 July 1608 in Rome.

== Music and influence ==

Nenna followed the Neapolitan stylistic trends of the time. He borrowed from the work of Giulio Caccini, and certainly he exchanged musical ideas with Gesualdo. Some of Nenna&#x27;s madrigals also make use of the antiphonal style of Andrea Gabrieli.

Nenna wrote eight books of madrigals; however, copies of the second and third books are no longer extant. Because of this, the change from his earlier style as exhibited in the first book of madrigals to that of his more mature style of the fourth might appear startling.

His use of chromaticism and a highly imitative musical language is experimental for its time, and mirrored in the work of Gesualdo, indicating a close working relationship between the two. Nenna uses dissonance to build tensions that intimately reflect the passions expressed in the texts, and he employs imitative melodic and rhythmic patterns among the parts as they move towards points of conflict that then frequently resolve suddenly.

The chromatic structures are sometimes surprising, as in the beginning of &quot;La mia doglia s&#x27;avanza&quot;, whose opening chords move from G minor to F-sharp major then D minor and finally C-sharp major, commencing a series of descending chromatic figures. In &quot;L&#x27;amoroso veleno&quot;, the voices use small, chromatic ascending scales to mimic the poison which slowly creeps up to the victim&#x27;s heart.

In more than one madrigal, he uses a repeated musical phrase, composed to the text, &quot;Vita de la mia vita&quot; (Light of my Life), apparently as a kind of aural signature, or perhaps as a veiled reference to a specific individual.

The fifth book of madrigals was dedicated to Nenna&#x27;s patron, Fabritio Branciforte, while the sixth was dedicated to Diana Vittoria Carafa, the spouse of the seducer of Gesualdo&#x27;s wife. The eighth book, published in 1618, was edited by Ferdinando Archilei, a doctor of laws, amateur musician and friend of Nenna&#x27;s in Rome, and this fact might suggest that Nenna did not live to see its publication.

He also wrote sacred choral music, including Tenebrae responsories for use during Easter and a psalm setting, all of which show a dignified and restrained approach, much in keeping with the Neapolitan style for liturgical music, and reflective of the work of the brothers Anerio and Gesualdo.

===Madrigals===

====&quot;Il Primo Libro de madrigali à cinque voci&quot;, 1613====
First Book of Madrigals. The First Book of Madrigals also contains madrigals by Stefano Felis. In 1621 Carlo Milanuzzi added the &#x27;continuo&#x27; part to the book.

==Manuscripts==

*Florence. Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale. Ms. (Magl.XIX.106bis). (Containing 10 madrigals by Nenna for four voices in score, most likely copied from the printed volume of 1621, and 12 ricercars by Giovanni de Macque)
*Christ Church. MS Mus. 37 Richard Goodson Sr Manuscript Madrigals by Pomponio Nenna (containing copies of 9 madrigals from the 1st Book, and 1 undetermined)

==Notes==
On the back of the frontispiece of a copy of the 1621 edition of the First Book of Madrigals, found in the collection of the Liceo Musicale di Bologna, composer Alessandro Grandi had written in 1623 a dedication wherein he begins, &quot;Escono questi Madrigali del Signor Cauaglier Nenna dal sepolchro delle tenebre alla luce del sole&quot;, or &quot;These madrigals of Signor Nenna exit from out the darkness of the grave to the light of the sun&quot;. This would suggest that by 1623 Nenna had been dead for several years.

<doc id="1192674" wikidata="Q7160264" url="?curid=1192674" title="Peel Session (Boards of Canada EP)">
<text>Peel Session is an EP by Boards of Canada, featuring the tracks played on their 1998 Peel Session broadcast on BBC Radio 1. It was originally released on 11 January 1999 as a 12&quot; and CD by Warp Records, with catalogue numbers WAP114 and WAP114CD, respectively.

The music was written &amp; produced at the band&#x27;s Hexagon Sun studio in June 1998. The BBC website and the privately released &quot;Peel Session June 1998&quot; CD-R on the band&#x27;s own Music70 label both indicate the recordings for broadcast were made on 16 June 1998 at the BBC&#x27;s Maida Vale Studios.

As with all Peel sessions, four tracks were recorded for it. One of the four, &quot;XYZ&quot;, was not included on the 1999 release due to sample licensing issues.

All versions released on Warp exclude the actual live recording of &quot;Happy Cycling&quot;, as it was deemed unsatisfactory by the band. Instead, they contain a re-recorded studio version of the track.

==Air dates==

Actual airdates are unverified.

Recordings made from the radio indicate the music aired at least twice. In what is apparently the first airing, Peel actually speaks with the band before the first song, &quot;XYZ&quot;, which is introduced by one of the band members. In the other airing, there&#x27;s no banter with the band; Peel alone introduces &quot;Aquarius&quot; as the first song and &quot;XYZ&quot; as the last song.

On the Warp release, the annotation &quot;TX 21/07/98&quot; appears on the front cover, and CD copies have the same date on the disc, suggesting at least one airing occurred on 21 July 1998.

==Reissue==

In September 2019, Warp Records announced that the EP would be re-released on 15 November 2019 to celebrate the record label&#x27;s 30th anniversary. The re-release features &quot;XYZ&quot;, which was also uploaded to YouTube alongside the announcement.

<doc id="1192675" wikidata="Q778772" url="?curid=1192675" title="Odd Man Out">
<text>Odd Man Out is a 1947 British film noir directed by Carol Reed, and starring James Mason, Robert Newton, Cyril Cusack, and Kathleen Ryan. Set in Belfast, Northern Ireland, it follows a wounded Nationalist leader who attempts to evade police in the aftermath of a robbery. It is based on the 1945 novel of the same name by F. L. Green. 

The film received the first BAFTA Award for Best British Film, and was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing. Filmmaker Roman Polanski repeatedly cited &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; as his favourite film.

&quot;Odd Man Out&quot; follows the Mason character &quot;on an anguished journey through the alleys of Belfast that visually presages Harry Lime&#x27;s shadowy flight through the sewers of Vienna&quot; in Reed&#x27;s 1949 film &quot;The Third Man&quot;.

==Plot==
Irish nationalist &#x27;organisation&#x27; member Johnny McQueen has been hiding for six months, since his escape from prison, in a house occupied by Kathleen Sullivan (who has fallen in love with Johnny) and her grandmother. He is ordered to rob a mill but his seclusion makes his men question his fitness; his lieutenant Dennis offers to take his place, but Johnny turns him down.

Johnny, Nolan, and Murphy carry out the robbery, While fleeing, Johnny falls behind the others and is tackled by an armed guard, whom he kills. Johnny is shot in the shoulder. He is pulled into the car, but falls out. Pat, the getaway driver, refuses to return to retrieve him. Weak and disorientated, Johnny hides in a nearby air raid shelter.

After telling Dennis what happened, Nolan, Murphy and Pat leave for &quot;headquarters.&quot; On the way they are seen by police and pursued. Pat and Nolan stop off at Theresa O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s well-to-do guest house, but Murphy does not trust her and goes elsewhere. Theresa betrays Pat and Nolan, who are killed in a gunfight with police.

Dennis finds Johnny, but the police show up nearby. Dennis is captured after drawing them away.

Johnny makes his way toward Kathleen&#x27;s place, but collapses in the street. Passers-by Maureen and Maudie take him home, thinking he has been struck by a passing lorry. They attempt to give first-aid then see it is a gunshot wound, realising who they have found as the husband returns. An argument over what to do starts, Johnny hears their debate and departs, getting into a parked hansom cab. &quot;Gin&quot; Jimmy, the cab driver, comes out and starts looking for a fare, unaware he already has a wanted man for a passenger. When he finds out, he abandons Johnny in a vacant lot.

Shell spots him dumping the now nearly unconscious fugitive. He goes to Catholic priest Father Tom, hoping for a financial reward. Kathleen arrives shortly afterward, looking for help. Father Tom persuades Shell to fetch Johnny. Upon returning home, Shell has to fend off another resident, the eccentric painter Lukey, who wants him to pose for a portrait again; an argument starts between them. Meanwhile, Johnny revives and stumbles into a local pub where he is recognised by the landlord, who quickly deposits Johnny in a snug where no one else will see him, with the intention of getting rid of him later. Shell and Lukey who separately have converged on the bar start a fight with each other. Fencie breaks it up, closes for the evening, and persuades Lukey to take Johnny away as compensation for the damage he caused the pub. Lukey takes Johnny back to his studio to paint his portrait. Failed medical student Tober tends to Johnny&#x27;s wound, and he flees.

Kathleen slips away from Father Tom during the visit to the rectory by a police inspector hunting for Johnny. She arranges passage on a ship for Johnny and goes searching for him. Shell starts Johnny toward Father Tom&#x27;s, and Johnny encounters Kathleen. She takes Johnny toward the ship but sees the police closing in. She draws a gun and fires twice. The police return fire killing them both.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
F.L. Green&#x27;s novel, also used as the basis of the 1969 Sidney Poitier film &quot;The Lost Man&quot;, was published in 1945. It followed upon wartime action by the IRA in Belfast, in consequence of which Northern Ireland undertook its first and only execution of an Irish Republican, 19-year-old Tom Williams. In the novel, an IRA plot goes horribly wrong when its leader, Johnny Murtah, kills an innocent man, and he is gravely wounded. The source of Green&#x27;s familiarity with the Belfast IRA at the time is thought to be the Belfast writer Denis Ireland. Ireland&#x27;s anti-Partition Ulster Union Club had been infiltrated by the IRA intelligence officer and recruiter John Graham.

===Casting===
According to Richard Burton, the lead role was originally offered to Stewart Granger. Burton wrote in his diaries:
Reminds me of Jimmy Granger being sent the script of Odd Man Out by Carol Reed and flipping through the pages where he had dialogue, deciding that the part wasn&#x27;t long enough. He didn&#x27;t notice the stage directions so turned it down and James Mason played it instead and made a career out of it. It&#x27;s probably the best thing that Mason has ever done and certainly the best film he&#x27;s ever been in while poor Granger has never been in a good classic film at all. Or, as far as I remember, in a good film of any kind. You could after all have a &#x27;James Mason Festival&#x27; but you couldn&#x27;t have a &#x27;Stewart Granger&#x27; one. Except as a joke. Granger tells the story ruefully against himself.
Aside from Mason, the supporting cast was drawn largely from Dublin&#x27;s Abbey Theatre. Among the other members of the Organisation are Cyril Cusack, Robert Beatty, and Dan O&#x27;Herlihy. On his travels, Johnny meets an opportunistic bird-fancier played by F. J. McCormick, a drunken artist played by Robert Newton, a barman (William Hartnell) and a failed surgeon (Elwyn Brook-Jones). Denis O&#x27;Dea is the inspector on Johnny&#x27;s trail, and Kathleen Ryan, in her first feature film, plays the woman who loves Johnny. Also notable are W. G. Fay—a founder of the Abbey Theatre—as the kindly Father Tom, Fay Compton, Joseph Tomelty, and Eddie Byrne. Albert Sharpe plays a bus conductor. A number of non-speaking parts were filled by actors who later achieved public attention, including Dora Bryan, Geoffrey Keen, Noel Purcell, Guy Rolfe and Wilfrid Brambell (a standing passenger in the tram scene). Few of the main actors in the film actually manage an authentic Ulster accent.

===Filming===
The cinematographer was Robert Krasker, in his first film for director Reed, lighting sets designed by Ralph Brinton and Roger Furse. Reed made extensive use of location filming, which was uncommon at the time. Exterior scenes were shot in West Belfast, although some were shot at Broadway Market in London.

The bar set was based on the Crown Bar in Belfast but was a studio set built at D&amp;P Studios in Denham, Buckinghamshire. The duplication was so authentic that tourists in subsequent years would visit the Crown Bar, thinking it was the bar in the film. To further enhance the realism of the film, Reed used real sounds instead of standard sound effects, recording the &quot;actual drum of mill machinery and the echo of hoof beats.&quot; The narrowness of Johnny&#x27;s world is represented by scenes shot on location in small rooms and in alleys. 

The film went over budget and overschedule so although it was successful it hurt Reed&#x27;s relationship with the Rank Organisation.

===Music===
Composer William Alwyn was involved writing the leitmotif-based film score from the very beginning of the production. It was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Muir Mathieson.

== Political context and censorship ==
The film did not mention the IRA by name and, like John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Informer&quot; (1935), only &quot;casually touched on the underlying conflict.&quot; Both use the backdrop of conflict in Ireland to present morality tales designed to appeal to the broadest possible audience. The IRA was portrayed as little more than a criminal gang. Politics and the cause of Irish nationalism was avoided to &quot;circumvent controversy and pass the censors.&quot;

With an eye toward distribution of the film in the United States, the film script was submitted to Joseph Breen of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, who advised the producers that the original ending, a murder-suicide, violated the Hollywood Production Code. Years earlier, Breen had similarly submitted the script of &quot;The Informer&quot; to the British Board of Film Censors, which requested numerous changes to omit references to the Anglo-Irish conflict.

&quot;Odd Man Out&quot; and &quot;The Informer&quot; are also similar in being &quot;dramatic portrayals of lapsed Catholics rediscovering their lost faith,&quot; and &quot;end with their dying protagonists assuming Christ-like poses.&quot;

Writing in &quot;The IRA on Film and Television: A History&quot;, author Mark Connelly observes that Johnny is &quot;more of a mob boss than revolutionary,&quot; and that the F.L. Green novel upon which the film was based took a dim view of Irish nationalism.

==Reception==
===Critics===
&quot;Odd Man Out&quot; was &quot;hailed as a masterpiece by many critics and a box office hit—at least in Europe, where Reed had gauged the mood of postwar despondency with caliper-like accuracy.&quot;

&quot;New York Times&quot; film critic Bosley Crowther praised the performances and the plotting of the early sequences in the film, which he compared favorably to &quot;The Informer,&quot; but he criticized the subsequent portions of the film, which he described as &quot;fumbled&quot; by shifting attention away from Mason and his motivations to &quot;cryptic characters,&quot; relieving the protagonist of his illustrative role, and &quot;whatever it is they are proving—if anything—is anybody&#x27;s guess.&quot;

&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote &quot;This film puts Reed high in the first rank of directors.&quot;

===Box office===
It ranked eighth among more popular movies at the British box office in 1947, and was one of the most successful films ever shown in South America.

===Awards===
The film received the BAFTA Award for Best British Film in 1948. It was nominated for the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival in 1947, and nominated for a Best Film Editing Oscar in 1948.

===Legacy===
Carol Reed biographer Robert F. Moss notes that &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; is &quot;almost indisputably Reed&#x27;s masterpiece.&quot;

Filmmaker Roman Polanski repeatedly has cited &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; as his favourite film. Polanski stated that &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; is superior to &quot;The Third Man&quot;, another film that has been considered to be Reed&#x27;s masterpiece:
Sam Peckinpah also cited it as a personal favorite.

American novelist, essayist and some-time screenwriter Gore Vidal called the film a &quot;near-perfect film&quot; and its screenwriter R. C. Sherriff &quot;one of the few true film auteurs.&quot;

Writing in 2006, &quot;Guardian&quot; film critic Peter Bradshaw gave the film three out of five stars. He wrote that the film was a &quot;fascinating but imperfect thriller&quot; that reflected &quot;Belfast&#x27;s forgotten identity as a bustling, prosperous provincial city, not obviously shattered by sectarianism or terrorism: a city in which a packed tram can head for the Falls Road, without any visible sense of fear.&quot;

Leonard Maltin gave the movie 4 out of 4 stars naming it &quot;Incredibly suspenseful.&quot;

==Radio adaptation==
&quot;Odd Man Out&quot; was presented on &quot;Suspense&quot; 11 February 1952. James Mason and his wife Pamela Mason starred in the 30-minute adaptation.

<text>Welton David Becket (August 8, 1902 – January 16, 1969) was an American modern architect who designed many buildings in Los Angeles, California.

==Biography==
Becket was born in Seattle, Washington and graduated from the University of Washington program in Architecture in 1927 with a Bachelor of Architecture degree (B.Arch.).

He moved to Los Angeles in 1933 and formed a partnership with his University of Washington classmate Walter Wurdeman and Angeleno architect Charles F. Plummer. Their first major commission was the Pan-Pacific Auditorium in 1935, which won them residential jobs from James Cagney, Robert Montgomery, and other film celebrities. Plummer died in 1939.

The successor firm Wurdeman and Becket went on to design Bullock&#x27;s Pasadena (1944) and a couple of corporate headquarters. Wurdeman and Becket developed the concept of &quot;total design,&quot; whereby their firm would be responsible for master planning, engineering, interiors, furniture, fixtures, landscaping, signage, and even (in the case of restaurants) menus, silverware, matchbooks, and napkins.
After Wurdeman&#x27;s death in 1949, Becket formed Welton Becket and Associates and continued to grow the firm to the extent that it was one of the largest architectural offices in the world by the time of his death in 1969. In 1987, his firm was acquired by Ellerbe Associates, and the merged firm continued as Ellerbe Becket until the end of 2009, when it was acquired by AECOM. It is now known as Ellerbe Becket, an AECOM Company.

Becket&#x27;s buildings used unusual facade materials such as ceramic tile and stainless steel grillwork, repetitive geometric patterns, and a heavy emphasis on walls clad in natural stone, particularly travertine and flagstone.

With The Walt Disney Company and the United States Steel Corporation, Becket&#x27;s firm co-designed Disney&#x27;s Contemporary Resort, which opened in 1971 at Walt Disney World Resort. The Contemporary was designed as a 14-story steel A-frame with a monorail running through the building. Modular guest rooms were assembled, finished, furnished, fully equipped and their doors locked, on the ground, then lifted by crane and inserted into the frame; however, this sometimes took multiple tries.

Welton Becket was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1952.

Becket&#x27;s sons, Welton MacDonald Becket &amp; Bruce Becket, are also practicing architects, as well as his nephew MacDonald G. Becket and granddaughter Alexandra Becket.

<text>Jeffrey Michael Haynes (born December 28, 1977), better known by his stage name Mr. Lif, is an American rapper from Boston, Massachusetts. While being praised because of his political lyrics, he has released two studio albums on Definitive Jux and one on Bloodbot Tactical Enterprises. Mr. Lif is also a member of the hip hop group The Perceptionists with long-time friends and collaborators Akrobatik and DJ Fakts One.

== Early life ==
Haynes grew up in the neighborhood of Brighton, Boston, Massachusetts. After attending the Dedham private school Noble and Greenough School, he went on to attend Colgate University for two years, and he eventually dropped out. He became a performer in 1994. Mr. Lif&#x27;s family ancestry is Bajan.

Haynes adopted the stage name &quot;Mr. Lif&quot; after ingesting psilocybin mushrooms at an outdoor Phish concert during his freshman year at Colgate University in 1994. He imagined a fictional character called The Liftedly Man while under the influence, which gave way to &quot;Mr. Lif&quot;. He later said in an interview for the &quot;Times Colonist&quot;: &quot;I don&#x27;t know any Phish songs. I went to the show, and I still don&#x27;t know anything about them now.&quot;

== Career ==
Influenced by legendary MC&#x27;s like Chuck D, KRS-One, and Rakim, Mr. Lif began releasing singles in the late &#x27;90s, when party rap and gangsta rap were the dominant styles for hip hop music, but Mr. Lif&#x27;s lyrical agenda was a political and socially conscious one. Mr. Lif released his first single, &quot;Elektro&quot;, in 1998, attracting the attention of labels Grand Royal and Definitive Jux. Working closely with producer and Definitive Jux label head El-P, Lif released a series of critically acclaimed singles and EPs, starting with &quot;Enters the Colossus&quot; in 2000. In 2000 and 2001, he won the Boston Music Award for Outstanding Rap/Hip Hop Act. Touring kept him busy for the next year, but he still found time to release the &quot;Cro-Magnon&quot; single and a live CD. His track &quot;Pull Out Your Cut&quot; was featured in the soundtrack to the ESPN Video Game ESPN NFL 2K5.

In 2002, Mr. Lif released a pair of concept releases. &quot;The Emergency Rations&quot; EP bookended collaborations with Edan and Akrobatik in an MC abduction scenario, while the &quot;I Phantom&quot; full-length formed a saga that led him from birth to apocalypse. He revisited his Akrobatik collaboration in 2005, when the pair joined producer DJ Fakts One to form The Perceptionists, who released &quot;Black Dialogue&quot;, also on Definitive Jux. One year later, he returned with &quot;Mo&#x27; Mega&quot;, his follow-up to &quot;I Phantom&quot;, featuring eight productions from El-P and features from Murs, Aesop Rock, and Blueprint. Mr. Lif has also collaborated with Otis Grove, Thievery Corporation and Anomie Belle.

&quot;I Heard It Today&quot; was released on Bloodbot Tactical Enterprises in 2009. Mr Lif embraced &quot;I Heard It Today&quot; using the album as a tool to address various political issues affecting people all over the world. &quot;I Heard It Today&quot; is the third full-length studio album by Mr. Lif. The album was released on April 21, 2009, on Mr. Lif&#x27;s own label Bloodbot Tactical Enterprises. Mr. Lif has stated that the album is &quot;dedicated to capturing the pulse of this tumultuous era we&#x27;re living through.&quot;

In June 2014, Mr. Lif announced on his Facebook that he is working on an album with The Polish Ambassador that will be released in the fall. In September 2014, the pair embarked on a national 5-week Permaculture Action tour with fellow musicians Ayla Nereo and Liminus. The musicians performed 4–5 days a week and then participated in weekly &quot;Permaculture Action Days&quot; where they held permaculture themed events and activities within the communities they were visiting. The tour raised over $40,000.

Lif is also a vocalist for Thievery Corporation and a member of the band&#x27;s live performance group. In 2011, Lif recorded the title track to their 2012 album, &quot;Culture of Fear&quot;. He continues to tour with the band today. Lif also appears on 2017 album &quot;The Temple Of I &amp; I&quot;, performing two tracks – the single &quot;Ghetto Matrix&quot; and &quot;Fight To Survive&quot;, and on two further tracks from the 2018 album &quot;Treasures from the Temple&quot;, &quot;History and &quot;Joy Ride&quot;.

<text>Clyde is an extinct town in Bryan County, in the U.S. state of Georgia.

==History==
Clyde once held the county seat of Bryan County. The community was named after Field Marshal Colin Campbell, 1st Baron Clyde (1792–1863), a Scottish soldier. A variant name was &quot;Eden&quot;. A post office called Clyde was established in 1887, and remained in operation until 1941.

<doc id="1192711" wikidata="Q862207" url="?curid=1192711" title="Self-censorship">
<text>Self-censorship is the act of censoring or classifying one&#x27;s own discourse, typically out of fear or deference to the perceived preferences, sensibilities, or infallibility of others, and often without overt external pressure. Self-censorship is commonly exhibited by film producers, directors, publishers, journalists, musicians, and social media personalities. 

Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees freedom of speech from all forms of censorship. Article 19 explicitly states that &quot;everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.&quot;

The practice of self-censorship, like that of censorship itself, has a long history.

== Reasons for self-censorship ==

=== Psychological ===
People often communicate to affirm their identity and sense of belonging. People may express their opinions or withhold their opinions due to the fear of exclusion or unpopularity. Shared social norms and beliefs create a sense of belonging, but they can also create a suppression of expression in order to comply or belong. People may adjust their beliefs or opinions to go along with the majority attitude. There are different factors that contribute to self-censorship, such as gender, age, education, political interests, and media exposure. For some, the reason for their change in beliefs and opinions is rooted in fear of isolation and exclusion. For these people, the expression of their own beliefs is less important than the fear of negative reactions of others to the expression of those beliefs.

According to a 2019 German survey on self-censorship conducted by the Institut für Demoskopie Allensbach for the newspaper (FAZ), 59% of respondents said they can express their views among friends, but only 18% believe the same is possible in public. Only 17% of respondents express themselves freely on the Internet.

Religious affiliation is a topic in which many occupational fields and areas may be a source of self-censorship. One particular area is psychology. From the origins of psychology, the field has frequently viewed religion with distrust. Psychologists and therapists often refrain from claiming to be part of any religion believing in the possibility that any expressions of any devout faith may be viewed as markers for mental illness or distress. A 2013 survey from the American Psychological Association (APA) found that &quot;relative to the general population, psychologists were more than twice likely to claim no religion, three times more likely to describe religion as unimportant in their lives, and five times more likely to deny belief in God.&quot;

Regarding a religious movement it is more common among fundamentalist believers like Wahhabism, Islamism, Calvinism, and Hasidic Judaism.

=== Economic ===
Self-censorship can also occur in order to conform to the expectations of the market. For example, the editor of a periodical may consciously or unconsciously avoid topics that will anger advertisers, customers, or the owners in order to protect their livelihood either directly (i.e., fear of losing their job) or indirectly (e.g., a belief that a book will be more profitable if it does not contain offensive material). This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as soft censorship.

=== Legal ===
In authoritarian countries, creators of artworks may remove material that their government might find controversial for fear of sanction by their governments.

===Taste and decency===
Taste and decency are other areas in which questions are often raised regarding self-censorship. Art or journalism involving images or footage of murder, terrorism, war and may cause complaints as to the purpose to which they are put. Curators and editors will frequently censor these images to avoid charges of prurience, shock tactics or invasion of privacy. Concepts like political correctness and spiral of silence have been found to contribute to the existence of self-censorship.

Products intended for children and youthful audiences, such as young adult literature, can be affected by self-censorship in this context.

When the director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art was interviewed regarding his decision to whitewash an antiwar mural showing dollar-draped military coffins, he speculated that the mural would have offended the community in which it was placed. He then added that &quot;there were zero complaints, because I took care of it right away&quot;.

=== As a form of preference falsification ===
Self-censorship is a form of preference falsification, though the concepts are not identical.  Self-censorship is a passive act. It amounts to the suppression of potentially objectionable beliefs, opinions, and preferences. Thus, it amounts to self-silencing; it is an act of passivity. Preference falsification is the misrepresentation of one’s preferences under perceived social pressures. It is often performative, as it can involve the active manipulation of one’s preferences to impress an audience or avoid its wrath.  

For an illustration, consider a discussion on a controversial subject. We are among the participants. If we keep quiet, that is self-censorship. Insofar as our silence conveys agreement with a position that we actually dislike, our self-censorship amounts also to preference falsification. If instead of keeping quiet, we speak up during the discussion in favor of position A, when we actually favor B, that is preference falsification but not self-censorship. In pretending to like A, we have gone beyond self-censorship. We have deliberately projected a contrived opinion. 

In a nutshell, preference falsification is the broader concept. Whereas all self-censorship falsifies a preference through the signals it sends, preference falsification need not take the form of self-censorship.

==In media==

Journalists often censor themselves due to threats against them or their interests from another party, editorial instructions from their supervisor[s], perceived conflicts of interest with a media organization&#x27;s economic sponsors, advertisers or shareholders, etc.). Self-censorship of journalists is most pervasive in societies where governments have official media censorship policies and where journalists will be jailed, fined, or simply lose their job if they do not follow the censorship rules. Organizations such as Media Matters for America, Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; and the American Civil Liberties Union have raised concerns about news broadcasting stations, particularly Fox News, censoring their own content to be less controversial when reporting on certain types of issues such as the War on Terror.

In their book &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; (1988), Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman argue that corporate ownership of news media very strongly encourages systematic self-censorship owing to market forces. In this argument, even with supposedly liberal media, bias and (often unconscious) self-censorship is evident in the selection and omission of news stories, and the framing of acceptable discussion, in line with the interests of the corporations owning those media.

The journalists have actively sought censorship advice from military authorities in order to prevent the inadvertent revelation of military secrets. In 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; succeeded in suppressing news of a reporter&#x27;s abduction by militants in Afghanistan for seven months until his escape from captivity in order to &quot;reduce danger to the reporter and other hostages&quot;.

Journalists have sometimes self-censored publications of news stories out of concern for the safety of people involved. Jean Pelletier, the Washington D.C. correspondent for the Montreal &quot;La Presse&quot; newspaper, uncovered a covert attempt by the Canadian government to smuggle US diplomats out of Iran during the Iranian hostage crisis before the &quot;Canadian Caper&quot; had reached its conclusion. In order to preserve the safety of those involved, he refused to allow the paper to publish the story until the hostages had left Iran, despite the considerable news value to the paper and writer.

Self-censorship by journalists has been described as a form of a survival strategy, allowing journalists to report on some issues rather than going too far and risking a more complete crackdown by the authorities, resulting in even less independent reporting.

==In science==

Self-censorship is found in the world of academia in a number of contexts. Self-censorship in scientific publications that have been criticized as politically motivated include scientists under the Third Reich withholding findings that disagreed with the commonly held beliefs in differences between races, or the refusal of these scientists under Hitler to support General Relativity (which got the reputation as &quot;Jewish science&quot;). In the 2000s, certain scientists have withheld their findings related to climate changes caused by pollution and to endangered species.

===Risks from scientific publications===

In the early days of atomic physics, it was realized that discoveries regarding nuclear fission and the chain reaction might be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes – on the one hand, such discoveries could have important applications for medicine and energy production, however on the other hand, they might also lead to the production of unprecedented weapons of mass destruction. Leo Szilard argues that if dangerous discoveries were kept secret, the development and use of such weapons might be avoided. Similarly, findings in the field of medicine and biotechnology could facilitate production of biological weapons of mass destruction. In 2003 members of the Journal Editors and Authors Group, 32 leading journal editors, perceived the threat from biological warfare as sufficiently high to warrant a system of self-censorship on the public dissemination of certain aspects of their community&#x27;s research. The statement agreed on declared:

We recognize that the prospect of bioterrorism has raised legitimate concerns about the potential abuse of published information... We are committed to dealing responsibly and effectively with safety and security issues that may be raised by papers submitted for publication, and to increasing our capacity to identify such issues as they arise...[O]n occasions an editor may conclude that the potential harm of publication outweighs the potential societal benefits... the paper should be modified, or not be published...

== By region ==

=== Africa ===
Self-censorship has been found to affect journalists in a number of less-democratic African states, such as Ethiopia, Uganda and Zambia.

=== Central Asia ===
Widespread practice of self-censorship has been described as significantly detrimental to the development of independent journalism in Central Asia.

=== China ===
In China, the media and citizens have to go to even greater extents to censor much of the material that they would post online. Many companies have been shut down by government because of the content that they have published. Nearly 10,000 social media accounts in October 2018 were shut down that published entertainment and celebrity news. As well as 370 different streaming apps that were pulled off of the app stores for non-compliance. Due to these high numbers of government interference, the companies and networks that publish on the internet are now employing people and utilizing sophisticated programs to find videos and pictures that are offensive to remove before the government can get them in trouble.

Self-censorship by Western companies trying to appease Chinese authorities has also affected the quality of content available to the citizens in other countries. It increasingly affects video games, including those by Western developers who want to sell their products to Chinese gamers as well.

=== Colombia ===
Self-censorship has been found to affect Colombian journalism.

===Europe===
Examples of self-censorship have been found in a number of European countries in different contexts.

European Union officials have been accused of self-censorship on topics deemed sensitive by China, in order to avoid diplomatic rifts between China and EU.

Threats to media freedom have shown a significant increase in recent years in Europe. Journalists and whistleblowers have experienced physical and psychological intimidation and threats. Self-censorship is one of the major consequences of such circumstances.

A study published in 2017 by the Council of Europe found that in the period 2014–2016 that 40% of journalists involved in the survey experienced some kind of unwarranted interference, in particular psychological violence, including slandering and smear campaigning, cyberbullying. Other forms of unwarranted interference include intimidation by interest groups, threats with force, intimidation by political groups, targeted surveillance, intimidation by the police, etc. In terms of geography, cases of physical assault were more common in the South Caucasus, followed by Turkey, but were present in other regions as well.

=== Indonesia ===
In the early 2010s, self-censorship was studied in the context of professional practice of many Indonesian newspaper journalists.

=== Israel ===
Self-censorship was found in Israeli media during the Second Lebanon War. It has also been found to affect a number of debates related to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

=== Pakistan ===
Self-censorship practices have been studied in the context of the Pakistani media in 2000s.

=== Russia ===
Self-censorship existed in Russia for a long time. After a brief relaxation following the fall of communism in the 1990s, self-censorship once again became a quite frequent practice in Russia after 2000s government take-overs and consolidation of media, further deepened after the 2014–2015 laws on &quot;undesirable organisations&quot; and the invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022.

=== Turkey ===
Self-censorship has increased in Turkey as press freedoms declined under the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government in the late 2000s. Affected areas include among others the discussion of the Armenian genocide.

===United States===

According to AmeriSpeak survey, 40% of Americans did not feel free to speak their mind in 2019. About 60% of college students reported that they did not feel comfortable expressing their views of campus at times. According to an article published by political scientists James L. Gibson and Joseph L. Sutherland, rates of self-censorship in America in 2020 had increased to 46%, up from 13% in 1954. Alternatively, according to an article by John. K Wilson, this may be an indicator of acceptable discourse becoming wider, not narrower.

<text>&quot;The Walrus and the Carpenter&quot; is a narrative poem by Lewis Carroll that appears in his book &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, published in December 1871. The poem is recited in , by Tweedledum and Tweedledee to Alice.

==Summary==
The poem tells the story of a walrus and a carpenter who meet on a beach and decide to go for a walk. They come across a group of oysters, and the walrus persuades them to come with them. The oysters follow the walrus and the carpenter, and they are eventually all eaten.

==Interpretations==

The characters of the Walrus and the Carpenter have been interpreted many ways both in literary criticism and popular culture. British essayist J. B. Priestley argued that the figures were political. Walter Russell Mead supposed they represent aspects of Protestant and Transcendentalist societies during Carroll&#x27;s life. They were also inspired by two sea stacks that stood outside the holiday home Carroll stayed at in Llandudno, Wales.

The 1967 The Beatles song &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;, which is based on the poem, is also a common subject of nonsense inquiry. John Lennon later inferred Carroll&#x27;s views on capitalism from the poem, joking that perhaps he should have instead sung &quot;I Am the Carpenter&quot;.

In the film &quot;Dogma&quot;, one of the characters claims that the poem is an indictment of organized religion.

==Television adaptation==
A series of six episodes starring Hugh Griffith, Felix Aylmer, and Daphne Heard was made by the BBC in 1965.

==Film==
The Walrus and the Carpenter story appears in Disney&#x27;s 1951 animated film &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; where it is told by Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

In the 1999 version of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, the story appears near the end of the film, when Alice meets the twins.

<doc id="1192718" wikidata="Q4934098" url="?curid=1192718" title="Bob Stinson">
<text>Robert Neil Stinson (December 17, 1959 – February 18, 1995) was an American musician best known as a founding member and lead guitarist of the rock band the Replacements.

== Early life ==
Bob Stinson was born on December 17, 1959, in Waconia, Minnesota, to Neil and Anita Stinson. They divorced when he was two years old. His father was largely absent from his life, and he was raised by his mother. His half-brother Tommy Stinson was born nearly seven years later. Despite Tommy&#x27;s father being Anita&#x27;s longtime boyfriend, Tommy was still given the last name &quot;Stinson&quot; by his mother. The pair also had two sisters, Lonnie and Lisa.

== Career ==

===The Replacements (1979–1986)===

Stinson formed the Replacements (formerly &#x27;Dog&#x27;s Breath&#x27; and also by some accounts as &#x27;Dogbreath&#x27;) in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1979 with drummer Chris Mars and Tommy, then just 12 years old; a year later, the band brought in Paul Westerberg on rhythm guitar and vocals. Stinson won acclaim for his lead guitar on the band&#x27;s first four albums.

In 1985, a long-running power struggle between Stinson and Westerberg reached a breaking point, and Stinson was forced out of the band in the summer of 1986. Though the exact circumstances of the split remain murky, published explanations include Westerberg&#x27;s commercial aspirations, pressure from the band&#x27;s label, Sire Records, for more mainstream records, and Stinson&#x27;s increasing substance abuse problems. &quot;Whether he was thrown out for the way his alleged alcohol problems had destroyed his skills or he left voluntarily due to creative tension is a moot point,&quot; according to &quot;Prefix Magazine&quot;. &quot;What matters is this: Stinson was gone, and with him went much of the band&#x27;s edge.&quot;

With the departure of Stinson, all subsequent recordings by the band were increasingly more pop-oriented, dominated by Westerberg&#x27;s pop stylings. Stinson&#x27;s last stint in the band was on the demos for the album &quot;Pleased to Meet Me&quot;.

===Later projects (1986–1994)===

Stinson&#x27;s first band after leaving the Replacements was called Model Prisoner, which broke up in 1988. Model Prisoner&#x27;s lineup consisted of Sonny Vincent on vocals and guitar, Stinson on guitar, Eric Magistad on bass and Jeff Rogers on drums. Other members included Jim Michels and Mike Henderson. The band performed live and they recorded an album at Nicollet Studios (Twin Tone).

Stinson later joined Static Taxi in 1988, who broke up in the summer of 1991, around the same time as the Replacements. Static Taxi recorded extensively, although none of the material was released until several years after Stinson&#x27;s death. Stinson&#x27;s former bandmates compiled two albums from the band&#x27;s recordings: &quot;Stinson Boulevard&quot; (released in 2000) and &quot;Closer 2 Normal&quot; (released in 2003).

Along with Vincent, Stinson formed the band Shotgun Rationale, and released the single &quot;Time Is Mine&quot; – a remake of the original song by the Testors – in 1991 on Dogmeat Records. The new version of the song, with Stinson on guitar, also featured future Bash &amp; Pop guitarist Steve Brantseg. Stinson also appeared on European releases that featured him playing alongside Vincent.

Shotgun Rationale&#x27;s lineup changed constantly. At one point Stinson and Vincent invited Cheetah Chrome (of Dead Boys) to join the band, and Chrome moved to Minnesota to play guitar with them. Vincent called this period, &quot;quite insane for a while... You have to imagine a band consisting of both Bob Stinson and Cheetah Chrome playing and working together.. then add to that I was no angel and you start to get a glimpse of the mercurial energy and intense chaos that we lived in, it didn&#x27;t last long but it was like living in a constant lightning storm and the sound was the same, tight and concentrated but always exploding over the edge.&quot;

Stinson also played with the local band Dog 994 around this time. His last band was the Bleeding Hearts, which he formed with his roommate Mike Leonard. One of their most high-profile performances was opening for Tommy&#x27;s band Bash &amp; Pop in 1993. His last public performance was playing with Minneapolis country swing band Trailer Trash at Lee&#x27;s Liquor Lounge in late 1994. They performed a version of Lefty Frizzell&#x27;s &quot;Lil &#x27;Ol Wine Drinker Me&quot;.

In 2010, Sonny Vincent compiled all the songs he recorded with Stinson over the years into the album &quot;Cow Milking Music&quot;, which he released under the name Model Prisoners Featuring Sonny Vincent And Bob Stinson. The album was released on vinyl, with CD included, along with many photos of Stinson from Vincent&#x27;s archives and a four-page story detailing the history of their collaboration and friendship.

==Personal life==
In the mid-1980s, Stinson married Carleen Krietler. The couple had a son Joey in 1989, who was profoundly disabled. Carleen filed for divorce around 1992. Joey died in 2010 at the age of 21. Joey&#x27;s obituary, as published on Legacy.com, listed his survivors simply as &quot;his caregivers and grandparents, Anita and Tom Kurth [and] other relatives and friends.&quot;

After he left the Replacements, Stinson was never again a full-time musician, and he worked as a cook in various Twin Cities restaurants and hotels.

==Death==
Stinson died on February 18, 1995. According to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner&#x27;s report, he did not die of a drug overdose (as is frequently reported) but rather from frequent drug use, which caused his overall health to diminish, resulting in organ failure. His body was found in his Uptown, Minneapolis, apartment, with an unused insulin syringe next to it. His obituary appeared in the print edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot; on February 24, 1995.

A park bench dedicated to Stinson sits next to a quiet canal near Lake of the Isles in Minneapolis. It was purchased by his mother Anita in his honor.

<doc id="1192721" wikidata="Q7962389" url="?curid=1192721" title="Walkerton E. coli outbreak">
<text>The Walkerton &quot;E. coli&quot; outbreak was the result of a contamination of the drinking water supply of Walkerton, Ontario, Canada, with &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot; bacteria. The water supply was contaminated as a result of improper water treatment following heavy rainfall in late April and early May 2000, that had drawn bacteria from the manure of nearby cattle used to fertilize crops into the shallow aquifer of a nearby well. The first reported case was on May 17. The contamination caused gastroenteritis and sickened more than 2,000 people and resulted in seven deaths, and left others with chronic illnesses.

Subsequently, Associate Chief Justice of Ontario, Dennis O&#x27;Connor led an inquiry into the outbreak, called the &quot;Walkerton Inquiry&quot;. Walkerton Public Utilities Commission operators Stan and Frank Koebel, neither of whom had any formal training, were sentenced on December 20, 2004, after pleading guilty to charges of common nuisance stemming from the contamination—Stan to one year in jail, and Frank to nine months house arrest. As a result, stricter water treatment guidelines were put in place by the government.

==Town background==
Walkerton, Ontario is a small township in the municipality of Brockton, northwest of Toronto. It serves as the administrative centre of Brockton, into which it was merged in 1999, and as the county seat of Bruce County. The population of Walkerton in 1996 was recorded as 5,036 individuals in an area of . At the time of the 2000 events, the town&#x27;s drinking water was drawn from three chlorinated wells to the west and southwest of the town. The wells were owned and operated by the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission (PUC), which was managed by Stan Koebel and run by foreman Frank Koebel.

==Contamination background==
===Walkerton Public Utilities Commission===
;System operators
In 2000, the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission was under the supervision of two men, brothers Stan and Frank Koebel. Both men had been working for the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission (PUC) since the 1970s, when they were teenagers and their father worked at the PUC. Neither man had formal training in public utility operation or in water management, but by 2000, both had been promoted to management positions on the basis of their experience. Both brothers carried certification as class 3 water distribution system operators, licences obtained through a grandfathering program run by the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) and based on their work experience in their positions. Though Ontario law required that water systems operators receive 40 hours of continuing education per year, Stan Koebel interpreted this to include activities only marginally related to water systems, such as CPR certification, and as a result neither brother used continuing education time to gain or maintain expertise in water safety.

As a result of their lack of formal training and their overseeing themselves, the Koebel brothers were relatively uninformed about water safety. Both later testified that they were not familiar with sections of the Ontario Drinking Water Standards documentation (ODWS) that dealt with tasks they needed to be aware of to do their jobs adequately: manager Stan Koebel had not read the section of the ODWS about identifying contaminated water, while foreman Frank Koebel had not read the chapter on chemical testing of water for safety purposes. Neither man had more than a passing familiarity with &quot;E. coli&quot; or the danger the bacteria posed to water systems, nor with chlorination standards and best practices.

;Well system and maintenance
The wells that drew water for Walkerton were known as Well 5, Well 6, and Well 7, with Well 5 being both the southernmost and the closest to the residential portion of the township. Well 5, drawing water from depths of and through soft limestone, was brought online to the Walkerton water system in 1978, following a hydrological evaluation commissioned by the PUC. Because Well 5&#x27;s aquifer drew partially from spring-fed, gravel-soiled zones that were prone to absorbing surface runoff, the hydrological evaluation recommended that Well 5 be monitored regularly to ensure that water was being drawn from lower well depths rather than higher ones. It also recommended that land usage in the immediate area of the well be limited in light of agricultural waste runoff being detectable in the well&#x27;s water. Neither of these recommendations was implemented as conditions of operation when Well 5 received a Certificate of Approval in 1979. Multiple subsequent tests on the well between 1979 and 2000 continued to conclude that due to the shallow depth at which Well 5 was drilled and the tendency of its water level and makeup to be directly affected by surface runoff, caution toward contamination levels in the well was advisable. Also, Wells 6 and 7 were drilled deeper and drew from areas of land with significantly less fractured bedrock than well 5.

In 2000, Ontario law indicated that in a community the size of Walkerton, at least thirteen water samples per month should be submitted for microbiological testing, with the samples being drawn from &quot;the point at which the treated water enters the distribution system&quot;. A longstanding standard at the Walkerton PUC, however, was to comply with an earlier governmental requirement of nine samples per month. Employees were instructed to collect four weekly samples from each of the three wells that served Walkerton. This meant that even in an ideal month, the PUC typically submitted one fewer sample than required by law; in practice, it was more common for eight or nine samples to be submitted than for thirteen to be. In addition, the samples that were submitted often had their points of origin mislabelled; for the sake of convenience, testing employees might draw two samples from one location but label the bottles as having come from two locations, or draw a water sample from the water supply of their own home rather than from within distribution points of the system. As a result, not all water sources were being tested adequately, and there was little regularity to which ones were tested when. Multiple Ministry of the Environment (MOE) documents dating to throughout the 1990s note that Walkerton&#x27;s sampling practices were lacking. Walkerton was placed on a list of non-compliant municipalities in 1997, but removed shortly thereafter after assurances from Stan Koebel that compliance would improve. Nevertheless, a 1998 inspection verified that eight or nine samples were still the standard of collection in Walkerton. The PUC was again warned about noncompliance, and again Stan Koebel agreed to improve testing practices.

MOE reports throughout the 1990s also noted that the PUC was inadequately chlorinating water that ran through the Walkerton system. Best practices dictated that chlorine residual levels after fifteen minutes of contact between the chlorine and the water be maintained at 0.5 mg/L, with that level verified through daily testing; this would indicate that the water was being adequately purified of potentially harmful microorganisms. Inspections of the Walkerton system in 1991, 1995, and 1998 showed chlorine residual levels in the Walkerton system of between 0.12 mg/L and 0.4 mg/L, with a mean level of 0.27 mg/L. According to the later &quot;Walkerton Inquiry&quot;, &quot;Stan Koebel testified that he generally set the chlorinator to slightly less than 0.5 mg/L and that Frank Koebel would lower it to approximately 0.3 mg/L several times a month.&quot; Both men felt that Walkerton water was adequately pure and safe without a 0.5 mg/L chlorine residual—they were known to willingly drink raw water from the wells—and they had received complaints from community members about system water tasting overly chlorinated. The PUC&#x27;s evaluation of chlorine residual levels was typically performed weekly, rather than daily, and actual testing was often eschewed in favour of visually inspecting the &quot;bubble&quot; on the chlorinator for a &quot;guesstimate&quot; of the residual. These &quot;guesstimates&quot; would be noted in the PUC&#x27;s daily operating sheets as if they were actual tested levels. When actual testing was performed, the 15-minute timeframe of the test was often cut short, resulting in higher-than-reality chlorine residual readings.

Fecal coliform and &quot;E. coli&quot; testing on Well 5 between 1990 and 2000 showed ongoing deterioration in the quality of water from the well. In the mid-1990s, a provision for more intensive monitoring of wells susceptible to groundwater contamination was added to the Ontario Drinking Water Objectives (ODWO); however, the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) failed to apply this provision to reclassifying existing wells. As a result, despite tests repeatedly showing that Well 5 was prone to contamination, it did not have any contamination alarms or emergency shut-off mechanisms. April 2000 sampling done on water from Wells 5 and 6 showed fecal coliform present in Well 5&#x27;s water, both raw and treated, but not in Well 6&#x27;s. Well 7 was not running during this time period and was not tested. May 1, 2000 tests showed similar results, with Well 5 being the sole apparent contaminated water source.

May 15 water testing on the Highway 9 water main construction project in Walkerton returned positive results for fecal coliform and &quot;E. coli&quot;. Due to inaccurate labelling of the samples&#x27; sources by PUC personnel, it was unclear to the testing laboratory which water samples had come from Walkerton&#x27;s raw water versus its treated water, or which water had come from which well source; however, the laboratory notified Stan Koebel on May 17 that submitted samples had tested positive for &quot;E. coli&quot; and fecal coliform. Personnel from the testing laboratory, unaware that Ontario Drinking Water Objectives mandated the notification of the Ministry of the Environment in such a case, did not notify any agency besides the PUC of the failed testing results.

===Contamination period===
Using knowledge about typical incubation periods of &quot;E. coli&quot; O157:H7 (average 3–4 days) and &quot;Campylobacter&quot; (average 2–5 days) bacteria and working backwards from the first emergence of symptoms in the community, investigators determined that the majority of infected community members had been exposed to the bacteria between May 13 and May 16 and the contamination had thus likely entered the infective well on or about May 12.

In the spring of 2000, Walkerton&#x27;s system typically drew most of its water from one well at a time, alternating unevenly between wells 5, 6, and 7. Well 7 was turned off between March 10 and May 2, ran alone from May 2 through May 9 before turning off again, and was then used again between May 15 and May 19. From May 9 to May 13, Well 5 provided the bulk of Walkerton&#x27;s water, supplemented from May 10–13 by Well 6. Though Well 7 ran without chlorination between May 3 and May 9, expert evaluation of well 7&#x27;s pumping schedule and lack of physical vulnerabilities to contamination concluded that it was highly unlikely to have been involved in the outbreak. Well 6, which records indicate was out of service beginning May 13, was similarly determined to have been unlikely to have been the source of contamination based on its location and characteristics.

===Source of contamination===
To the immediate south and west of Well 5 lay farmland used as a cattle-breeding operation, occupying four lots (18–21, west to east). On April 22, 2000, following heavy rainfall on April 20–21, manure from the cattle was used to fertilize crops growing on lot 20 of the property, the nearest edge of which lay approximately from Well 5. The manure was subsequently incorporated into the soil of lot 20 using a disc harrow.

The April incorporation of &quot;E. coli&quot;-contaminated manure into cool, wet soil near Well 5 meant that the bacteria were in an ideally suited environment for longevity. Subsequent heavy rains totalling fell between May 8 and May 12, drawing the bacteria deeper into the soil near Well 5. During later investigations of the outbreak, experts on the Walkerton Commission Expert Review Panel determined that the manure-contaminated water had likely seeped into the aquifer that underlay Well 5, though it may have been possible that surface runoff, rather than contaminated groundwater, was the source of the bacteria.

Cattle manure, even under best practices, typically contains fecal coliform bacteria, including &quot;E. coli&quot;. A subsequent government report concluded that the cattle operation had followed all safety and husbandry best practices with regard to manure storage and use, and that though the &quot;E. coli&quot; contamination had almost certainly come from the farm&#x27;s manure usage, the farm&#x27;s operator was not at fault for contamination of the well.

==Outbreak==
Beginning May 17, 2000, absenteeism in the Walkerton school system took an upswing. That day, the Walkerton Hospital treated seven children suffering from gastrointestinal ailments involving cramping and diarrhea. The illnesses were not initially recognized as part of a pattern, and no report was made to the Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound Health Unit, which was responsible for public health in Grey and Bruce counties.

On May 18, twenty students were absent from the Mother Teresa School in Walkerton; the next day, twenty-five were, with a further four sent home from Mother Teresa and eight sent home from the Walkerton Public School. The increasing number of community illnesses became even more noticeable on May 19, when a pediatrician and a retirement home both reported outbreaks of gastroenteritis among their charges. By May 20, the Walkerton hospital had fielded calls from more than a hundred people about incidents of gastroenteritis in the town, and attended to dozens more in their Emergency Department. Attending physicians and health care workers, aware that the gastroenteritis symptoms they were seeing were consistent with possible &quot;E. coli&quot; infection, began collecting stool samples from affected patients.

When public health officials put together common reports, they found that three area hospitals had recorded incidents of patients suffering from gastroenteritis symptoms. Walkerton&#x27;s hospital recorded the highest number of such patients, with at least twenty patients visiting the emergency department with bloody diarrhea on May 20, and two more patients admitted for diarrhea-connected dehydration. Hospitals in two neighbouring towns had each seen one case of bloody diarrhea.

===Initial public health response===
On May 20, early laboratory testing was completed on fecal samples submitted the day before. &quot;E. coli&quot; O157 was found in at least one sample from the Owen Sound Hospital; when health officials contacted other hospitals in the Bruce-Grey system, they found that all were handling patients with gastrointestinal ailments consistent with &quot;E. coli&quot; infection. Potential &quot;E. coli&quot; infection changed the treatment plan for patients reporting to these hospitals or to local doctors; anti-motility medication that would typically be prescribed to patients suffering from diarrhea unrelated to &quot;E. coli&quot; could in fact exacerbate the condition of patients whose diarrhea was due to &quot;E. coli&quot; infection, and any patient infected with &quot;E. coli&quot; O157 was at risk for potentially fatal hemolytic-uremic syndrome.

David Patterson, the Assistant Director of Health Protection at Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit (BGOSHU), immediately contacted Beverly Middleton, a public health inspector in the Owen Sound office of the Health Unit, and the two officials began passing along information to local medical facilities about how to properly treat &quot;E. coli&quot;-based gastroenteritis. Later the same day, Patterson asked James Schmidt, Middleton&#x27;s counterpart in the Walkerton Health Unit, to contact the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and obtain information on chlorination levels in the water system. Stan Koebel (PUC manager) informed Schmidt that chlorine residuals in the distribution system were 0.1 to 0.4 parts per million; based on lack of familiarity with water chlorination, Patterson concluded that the presence of chlorine residuals at any level indicated that the water system was free of contamination. He proceeded with investigating other possible sources for the &quot;E. coli&quot;. Throughout May 20, Patterson expressed his understanding to community members and other investigators that Walkerton&#x27;s water could not be the source of the outbreak; BGOSHU personnel also urged the PUC to issue a press release assuring the public of the safety of the water.

===Initial Public Utilities Commission response===
By May 18, rumours were already circulating that Walkerton Public Utilities Commission (PUC) water was the cause of the illness increasing numbers of residents were suffering. Staff at the PUC had also begun receiving calls enquiring as to the safety of town water. On May 19, public health officials contacted the Walkerton PUC about the possibility of the water system being involved in transmission of the gastroenteritis; they were told that the town&#x27;s drinking water was &quot;okay&quot;. After speaking to public health officials that day, Stan Koebel (PUC manager) began the process of flushing the system and increasing chlorination levels, procedures he described to David Patterson as &quot;precautionary&quot;. This flushing continued into May 20; Koebel&#x27;s testing records from that day note sharply increased chlorine residual levels, though evidence later indicated that Koebel&#x27;s testing had likely been done improperly and thus returned higher-than-reality chlorination results. The same day, Koebel returned Well 5, which had not been feeding Walkerton&#x27;s water supply since May 15, to service. The well was then turned off at 1:15 a.m. on May 21.

Chief Justice of Ontario Dennis O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s later report on the event concluded that by May 19, Koebel was aware that the May 15 testing of water in the Walkerton system had returned results that indicated contamination, and his action to flush the system with heavily chlorinated water from Well 7 on May 19 was taken in the hopes of eradicating the contamination before further tests could be conducted. Significantly, Koebel did not disclose to the health inspectors to whom he spoke on May 19 or May 20 any information about known adverse test results or the fact that he knew Well 7 had been providing unchlorinated water to the system from May 15 to May 19. O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s report interpreted this not as an act of accidental omission, but as a deliberate attempt by Koebel to conceal what he knew to be substandard and potentially unsafe practices in his department. At the same time, however, Koebel continued to consume PUC-served water and allow his family to do the same with no apparent concern about its safety; O&#x27;Connor concluded that while Koebel knew the system was contaminated, he did not understand that the &quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria causing the contamination were potentially deadly.

On May 20, Robert McKay, a PUC employee who was on medical leave at the time, anonymously contacted the Ministry of the Environment&#x27;s Spills Action Centre (SAC) to report potential issues with the Walkerton water supply; after observing fire hydrants being used for system flushing, he had concluded that the flushing may have been related to the ongoing illness outbreak in the community and felt that he needed to report his conclusion. McKay also reported to the SAC that Walkerton water had failed &quot;lab tests&quot;, but he was unable to provide detail about what aspect of the water quality had caused the failure. Later in the day on May 20, McKay attempted to contact the Ministry of Health directly about his suspicions, but was unable to get in contact with anyone empowered to handle issues in Walkerton; hoping to speed up government response time, he phoned the SAC again to report his knowledge that the Walkerton PUC was using an &quot;unlicensed operator&quot;.

SAC employees, in response to this information, contacted the Walkerton PUC the same day for information on possible adverse water testing results. Stan Koebel acknowledged to the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) that &quot;we&#x27;ve had the odd [adverse sample]&quot; due to previous construction work but that the system flushing was occurring only as &quot;a precaution&quot;. The MOE employee who spoke to Koebel believed that this meant any adverse samples of Walkerton water were in the past, and filed his subsequent report of the conversation accordingly; Koebel had again failed to note that he was aware of current test results that showed evidence of &quot;E. coli&quot; and fecal coliforms.

==Controlling the outbreak==
===Events of May 21===
Morning news reports on public radio on May 21 carried a statement by Dr. Murray McQuigge, Walkerton&#x27;s Medical Officer of Health, reflecting medical investigators&#x27; then-current understanding that Walkerton&#x27;s water system was presumed to be secure and not involved in the outbreak. McQuigge&#x27;s quoted opinion also characterized &quot;E. coli&quot; as &quot;unlikely&quot; to be the source of the gastroenteritis outbreak.

By 12 p.m. on May 21, however, laboratory results had confirmed enough cases of &quot;E. coli&quot; O157 in area gastroenteritis patients to merit a declaration by the Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit (BGOSHU) that an infective outbreak existed and was being caused by &quot;E. coli&quot; O157 contamination somewhere. The Health Unit issued an outbreak number and alerted neighbouring health units of its situation, as well as notifying a variety of Walkerton-centred government and management bodies, including the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission (PUC).

Shortly after the definitive laboratory results were received, McQuigge, representing BGOSHU, contacted David Thompson, the mayor of Brockton, Walkerton&#x27;s parent municipality. According to McQuigge, the conversation involved McQuigge alerting Thompson to the fact that community members were falling ill with potentially fatal &quot;E. coli&quot; infections; according to Thompson, &quot;E. coli&quot; was not mentioned in the conversation and he was left with the impression that the illnesses presented no imminent threat to public health. Despite their conflicting memories of the conversation, both McQuigge&#x27;s and Thompson&#x27;s later testimonies agreed that there had been no request issued that the mayor take action in response to the illnesses; Brockton&#x27;s emergency plan was not put into action, and Thompson did not contact any public agencies to seek either information or action.

Given that the outbreak was continuing and that no reliable information was yet available about the source of the contamination, the BGOSHU issued a cautionary Boil Water Advisory (BWA) to the community, to be distributed via local radio stations only. Local television stations were not contacted about the advisory, nor was national CBC Radio; no paper version of the advisory was distributed to the community that day. Local radio station CKNX-FM, under the impression that the BWA was cautionary only, reported the advisory at roughly hourly intervals, beginning at 1:30 p.m., rather than more rapidly as they later stated they might have if the import of the announcement had been made clear to them at the time. As a result of the limited distribution of information regarding the BWA, much of the community remained unaware of the Boil Water Advisory until days after its May 21 issuance.

Around the time the BWA was first being broadcast, David Patterson (the Assistant Director of Health Protection at BGOSHU) contacted the MOE&#x27;s Spills Action Centre (SAC) to officially report an &quot;E. coli&quot; outbreak in Walkerton. Paul Webb, the SAC employee taking Patterson&#x27;s phone call, mentioned that they had previously been contacted by an anonymous source (Robert McKay) about the quality of water coming out of the Walkerton PUC. The men discussed the PUC&#x27;s assurances that their water was safe, and the call ended with no action. Shortly afterward, however, Patterson contacted Stan Koebel, the manager at the Walkerton PUC again. Koebel expressed dismay at the Boil Water Advisory and the fact that the PUC had not been notified of it beforehand. He asked Patterson&#x27;s advice for the best next steps to take; Patterson suggested increasing chlorination levels in the system.

The same afternoon, the Spills Action Centre contacted Stan Koebel (the PUC manager) directly to discuss the ongoing events; Koebel once again failed to mention prior known adverse testing results. In later testimony, he acknowledged that this had been a deliberate omission; the O&#x27;Connor report concluded that Koebel had been hoping that when new samples were collected on May 23, they would test clean and lift the burden from his shoulders. Stan and Frank Koebel again spent part of their day on May 21 flushing the system.

At 2:30 p.m. on May 21, the BGOSHU convened a strategic response team to handle the outbreak. After discussion, the team decided to directly notify at-risk or involved institutions, including hospitals, of the Boil Water Advisory. The Walkerton hospital received its notification at 3:30 p.m. that day. Prior to this, and despite numerous contacts with BGOSHU staff, hospital personnel had not been aware of potential danger from Walkerton water; in some cases hospital personnel had been told specifically that water was &quot;not&quot; the cause of the outbreak.

The Ministry of the Environment nominally received notification of the outbreak from a message left on the home answering machine of employee Philip Bye. Bye, however, did not recognize the significance of &quot;E. coli&quot; being present in Walkerton water and, believing the measures public health officials had already taken to be sufficient to deal with the contamination, he did not pass the news on to the emergency response arm of the MOE that day.

In the face of rising community casualties—by the evening of May 21, 270 people had contacted the Walkerton hospital after experiencing gastroenteritis symptoms, and one patient had had to be airlifted to London, Ontario, for treatment—the situation was being perceived as increasingly serious by most of those involved. That evening, the BGOSHU contacted the Minister of Health and the Chief Medical Officer of Health of Ontario. Requests were placed with the Ministry of Health for an epidemiologist and for staff to assist in treating Walkerton-region gastroenteritis patients; public health staff began looking into acquiring equipment that would be needed to treat any &quot;E. coli&quot; patients whose infections progressed to Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS).

David Patterson ordered further testing of Walkerton&#x27;s water, sending James Schmidt to collect samples of water from various sources in Walkerton, including &quot;food premises, hospitals, and the health unit office&quot;. Patterson received Schmidt&#x27;s collected samples and drove them to London overnight. The samples were received by the London Regional Public Health Laboratory at 12:45 a.m. on May 22; a further round of sampling was ordered to be done the next day.
===Events of May 22===
Despite increased awareness of the severity of the outbreak, as May 22 began, some links in the public safety chain were still uninformed as to either the existence of the outbreak or the fact that it presented a real and present danger to public health. Mayor David Thompson, himself suffering from symptoms of gastroenteritis, which he assumed to be flu, took no investigatory or emergency-preparedness action on May 22, nor did James Kieffer, chair of the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission (PUC), who had been alerted to the outbreak the day before. Ministry of the Environment (MOE) employee Philip Bye, who had been notified by Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit (BGOSHU) phone call the previous evening, did not understand that &quot;E. coli&quot; contamination was a life-threatening emergency; he took no action until he was contacted again later on May 22 by a concerned Dr. McQuigge. At that point, Bye sent an environmental officer to join the investigation in Walkerton.

The MOE environmental officer dispatched by Bye, John Earl, spoke first to David Patterson (the Assistant Director of Health Protection at BGOSHU), who expressed his growing suspicion that Walkerton PUC water was the source of the contamination; Patterson asked Earl to obtain further information and records from Stan Koebel, the PUC manager. Koebel, in his verbal interview with Earl, failed again to provide information about adverse water testing results and other potentially crucial system information; he informed Earl that Well 7 has had a new chlorinator installed, for example, but omitted mention that this had been after the well had pumped unchlorinated water into the system for days. Earl requested and was given documentation regarding well testing, water distribution maps, and pumping history for the wells. Included in this documentation were records of the May 17 adverse testing results of May 15 samples from the &quot;Highway 9&quot; water main construction; excluded was pumping history for Well 7. Earl returned to the MOE with these documents and reviewed them, noting the May 17 testing results, but notified no one else of these results.

After Earl left the PUC, Stan Koebel contacted his brother Frank to ask him to &quot;clean up&quot; the pumping log for Well 7. Stan Koebel hoped to have a new document to present to Earl the next day that would not reflect that Well 7 had been unattended to and unchlorinated. Frank Koebel complied with this request. He destroyed the previous version of the document and created a new one with fictitious data: the new document showed Well 7 as not having operated on the days it had actually been pumping unchlorinated water into the system, and contained chlorine residual records for Well 7 which were entirely fictitious. Frank Koebel later testified that he had falsified this document &quot;so it would look better to the MOE&quot;.

While the Ministry of the Environment investigated the outbreak from the procedural end, public health officials swung into a medical investigation. Early epidemiological investigation had demonstrated fairly strongly that infection risk seemed to correlate to physical presence in Walkerton—even for patients visiting other area hospitals, investigators typically found that the patient lived in or had visited Walkerton during the period of their infection— and investigators now began making telephone calls to patients, gathering information about onset of symptoms, possible methods of exposure, and the patients&#x27; personal demographic information.

A compilation of data from this secondary investigation demonstrated that most patients had an onset of symptoms within a fairly narrow window of time, with the highest rate of onset occurring on May 17. Taking into account the incubation period of &quot;E. coli&quot; infection, the medical team determined that most patients had been exposed to the pathogen between May 12 and May 14. Investigators had less luck trying to pinpoint a physical source of the infection; when affected patients&#x27; residences were mapped, their distribution across a map of Walkerton showed no immediately apparent pattern, with affected populations present in all areas served by Walkerton&#x27;s water system.

By that evening, public health investigators had concluded based on patient interviews and demographic mapping that the water system was the most likely vehicle of infection, despite their not being aware of the corroborating documents that John Earl had collected. They began notifying branch offices of the BGOSHU of the outbreak and its cause.

===Events of May 23 and 24===
The Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit (BGOSHU)&#x27;s May 22 presumptive conclusion about Walkerton&#x27;s water was confirmed at 8:45 the following morning, when the London Regional Public Health Laboratory reported testing results on the water Schmidt had collected on May 21 and 22: both &quot;E. coli&quot; and fecal coliform results had come back positive on the May 21 samples, and though testing was not complete on the May 22 samples, evidence of coliform growth was already apparent.

John Earl (the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) environmental officer) returned to the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission (PUC) that morning to continue his investigation. Stan Koebel, the PUC manager, gave him the Well 7-related documents that he and Frank Koebel, the PUC foreman, had falsified, and Earl began to analyse the documentation he had collected over the past few days. He noted apparent irregularities in the pumping histories of all three wells, as well as unlikely chlorination levels recorded for Well 5. He communicated these irregularities to the MOE&#x27;s Philip Bye, but neither man reported them outside of his own organization.

At 9:45 on the morning of May 23, David Patterson (the Assistant Director of Health Protection at BGOSHU) contacted Stan Koebel at the Walkerton PUC and informed him of the May 21 test results. Koebel, realizing that his attempts to clean the system beginning May 19 had not been sufficient, confessed to Patterson that he had been aware of the contamination of Walkerton water since May 17. Koebel was reportedly &quot;distraught&quot; at this point in the conversation. After ending his call with Koebel, Patterson immediately passed on the information about the May 15 test results to the chairman of the Board of Health and to Dr. Murray McQuigge, the local Medical Officer of Health.

Shortly after 11 a.m., a press conference was held at the Walkerton hospital. Led by McQuigge and attended by hospital staff, BGOSHU staff, and the media, this press conference was the first reliable report to the public of the existence and causes of an &quot;E. coli&quot; outbreak in the community.

The Walkerton hospital hosted a roundtable at 1 p.m. the same day to inform local physicians of proper treatment for &quot;E. coli&quot; O157:H7-associated gastroenteritis, especially with regard to infected children, who were at increased risk for renal failure due to Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome. Shortly thereafter, BGOSHU staff met with the Brockton city council in the council&#x27;s chambers. This meeting was attended by representatives from the Ministry of the Environment and the Public Utilities Commission as well as of BGOSHU and the city council. The attendees of the meeting reviewed what was known thus far about the timeline of the outbreak, discussed what steps could be taken going forward, and attempted to analyse the adequacy of their response to the crisis thus far. MOE representative Philip Bye announced that the MOE would be investigating the ways in which Walkerton&#x27;s water system could have become the cause of the outbreak. McQuigge, in response to questions, asserted that he did not believe the public could have been notified with a Boil Water Advisory any earlier than they were; prior to May 21, neither the distribution of hospital admissions nor then-current testing results supported publicly declaring a problem in Walkerton.

The meeting became heated, with McQuigge urging Stan Koebel to &quot;come clean&quot;, Koebel refusing to disclose adverse test results, and McQuigge and Mayor Thompson exchanging confrontational words as the meeting broke up. McQuigge later claimed that he had urged Thompson to &quot;tell the public what you know&quot;; Thompson alleged that McQuigge had threatened him if he &quot;bl[e]w the whistle on me or Brockton&quot;.

Later in the afternoon, Thompson and the council convened a private meeting without BGOSHU staff to decide their next steps. Stan Koebel told meeting participants that testing had shown bacteriological issues in Wells 5 and 7; explaining, Well 7&#x27;s chlorinator had not been functioning properly, he did not disclose that Well 7 had in fact been operating without any chlorinator at all. With the input of Koebel and Steve Burns, an engineer with the Highway 9 project&#x27;s consulting firm, it was decided that Burns&#x27;s firm would develop an action plan to remediate the water contamination. On the basis of this remediation plan, meeting participants decided that it would not be necessary to declare a state of emergency in Walkerton.

Despite this declaration, publicizing of the epidemic, and the Boil Water Advisory, local hospitals continued to treat gastroenteritis patients during the last week of May at numbers more than double typical ER throughput. Hospital staff were forced to take emergency measures, with elective and deferrable treatments redirected to other hospitals and out-of-town medical staff being pressed into service. By May 24, there had been four patient deaths and the Walkerton hospital and the BGOSHU were playing host to three epidemiologists from various arms of Health Canada. 27 people had developed HUS, a serious and potentially deadly complication of &quot;E. coli&quot; infection. The full death toll for the outbreak was initially reported as seven, but later revised to six.

==Aftermath==
While the community attempted to recover from the events of May 2000, anger and blame ran high. On May 25, Dr. McQuigge had made a public statement saying that in his opinion, dissemination of information to the community had been hampered by lack of disclosure of adverse Walkerton Public Utilities Commission (PUC) testing results, and patient deaths could have been prevented had disclosure been made earlier; by May 29, a $1 billion class-action lawsuit had been filed by community members similarly alleging that local officials had failed in their duty to notify the community.

Authorities from the Ontario Clean Water Agency took over operations at the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission on May 25 at the request of Mayor Thomson. The next day, the Ontario Provincial Police launched an investigation into the causes of the outbreak, followed within days by a coroner&#x27;s inquest and an environmental investigation.

During the outbreak, both Stan and Frank Koebel denied any wrongdoing and firmly held that the water at Walkerton was safe to drink. However, as the outbreak grew in severity the two were eventually part of the criminal investigation into the incident, and, as a result, both would eventually plead guilty to a charge of common nuisance through a plea bargain. In their plea, they admitted to falsifying reports and Frank admitted to drinking on the job, as a beer fridge did exist at the facility.

Stan and Frank Koebel were both formally sentenced on December 20, 2004; Stan to one year in jail, and Frank to nine months house arrest.

The Ontario Clean Water Agency was put in charge of the cleanup of Walkerton&#x27;s water system after the outbreak. The incident led to a broader environmental consciousness in Ontario, which has been linked to the change in Ontario electricity policy to phase out coal.

An inquiry, known as the Walkerton Commission led by Court of Appeal for Ontario Associate Chief Justice Dennis O&#x27;Connor, wrote a two-part report in 2002.

Part 1 was released in January 2002. The Walkerton Report, Part One, described events in the community and a series of failures, both human and systemic, that led to contamination of the water supply. The report made recommendations based on the circumstances of the outbreak. It estimated that the Walkerton water contamination cost a minimum of C$64.5–155 million and laid much of the blame at the door of the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission:
The Walkerton Public Utilities Commission operators engaged in a host of improper operating practices, including failing to use adequate doses of chlorine, failing to monitor chlorine residuals daily, making false entries about residuals in daily operating records, and misstating the locations at which microbiological samples were taken. The operators knew that these practices were unacceptable and contrary to Ministry of Environment guidelines and directives.
The Ontario government of Mike Harris was also blamed for not regulating water quality and not enforcing the guidelines that had been in place. The water testing had been privatized in October 1996.

Part 2 of the report made many recommendations for improving the quality of water and public health in Ontario. Part Two discussed water safety across the province and the steps needed to prevent similar tragedies. It made ninety-three recommendations. All of its recommendations have been accepted by succeeding governments of the province. The recommendations have also influenced provincial policies across Canada.

Key recommendations touched on source water protection as part of a comprehensive multi-barrier approach, the training and certification of operators, a quality management system for water suppliers, and more competent enforcement. In Ontario, these requirements have been incorporated into new legislation.

===Contributing causes===
; Physical
* Well 5: shallow depth of the well, its being surrounded by fractured bedrock, and its physical location near a source of cattle manure runoff all contributed to Well 5 being unusually susceptible to contamination

; Chemical
* Inadequate chlorination of Well 5&#x27;s water (as well as water throughout the Walkerton PUC system) meant that, once it was contaminated by bacteria such as &quot;E. coli&quot;, it remained so.

; Organizational negligence
* Public Utility Commission staff:
:*Inadequate training and continuing education among staff of the Walkerton PUC meant that those responsible for the safety of the area&#x27;s water were not equipped to make informed decisions in this area
:*The Walkerton PUC had a long-term history of failing to abide by the minimum water testing and treatment requirements
:**Inadequate monitoring of system water: PUC staff regularly collected fewer samples than required, and collected them from improper areas of the system. Both of these practices were known to potentially lead to false-negative contamination results. Similarly, PUC staff generally failed to perform chlorine residual monitoring tests as often as necessary, and often performed them improperly when they did perform them.
:**Improper chlorination: Though the Ministry of the Environment had repeatedly reminded the PUC of the importance of maintaining the system at a 0.5 mg/L chlorine residual after 15 minutes, PUC staff relied on their personal judgment that this standard was unnecessary due to the water&#x27;s inherent quality and chose to chlorinate the system to a lesser level, partially in response to community complaints that the system&#x27;s water tasted of chlorine.
* Public Utility Commissioners (two elected, one the town&#x27;s mayor serving commissioner) ():
:*Public Utilities Commissioners should have been responsible for hiring and maintaining informed and capable PUC staff, beginning with senior management; this was neglected in Walkerton, as the commissioners felt that their responsibilities encompassed only &quot;budgeting and financial aspects of the operation&quot;.
:*Commissioners relied on PUC manager Stan Koebel to make policy and inform the Commission of water quality-related events of interest, even when commissioners were or should have been aware of such information and responsible for policy-setting. Commissioners also failed to review whether Koebel was performing these aspects of his job adequately.
:*Commissioners were offered no education on the topic of water safety, and none was required of them in order to be elected or to serve. Commissioners typically did not consider this knowledge a requirement for doing their jobs, even when they had access to relevant resources.

; Negligence by individuals
* Falsification of reports: PUC staff regularly entered chlorine residual results on log sheets that did not reflect actual testing results or that represented testing that had never been performed at all.
* Stan Koebel, general manager of the Walkerton PUC:
** Koebel knowingly failed to notify the Bruce-Grey-Owen-Sound Health Unit when he became aware on May 15 that water from his system was heavily contaminated.
** Prior to public health investigators determining that the water system was a likely cause of the outbreak, Koebel communicated to the Health Unit the false impression that the water system had been checked and was safe.

==In media==
The lessons learned from this incident were described by Kim Vicente in his book &quot;The Human Factor&quot;.

A 2002 episode of Diagnosis Unknown: In The Heart of Human Crisis, Season 1 Episode 6 titled &quot;Unlikely Source&quot; chronicled the outbreak and interviewed many of the physicians and public health officials involved in the source control and management of this outbreak, along with archival footage.

A 2005 CBC Television docudrama called &quot;Betrayed&quot; was based loosely upon the Walkerton &quot;E. coli&quot; outbreak.

On May 11, 2018, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported that following 18 years of suffering Robbie Schnurr had doctors assist him in ending his life due to illness caused by the outbreak. They also reported that twenty-two of the children who became sick in 2000 acquired permanent kidney damage.

<text>, a son of Shimazu Tadayoshi, was a &quot;daimyō&quot; during Japan&#x27;s Sengoku period. He was the fifteenth head of the Shimazu clan.

==Biography==
In 1514, he is said to have been born in Izaku Castle. On 1526, Takahisa was adopted as the successor to Shimazu Katsuhisa and became head of the clan. He launched a series of campaigns to reclaim three provinces: Satsuma, Osumi, and Hyūga. While he made some progress, it would be up to the next generation in the Shimazu family to successfully reclaim them. He nurtured such future leaders like Shimazu Yoshihisa and his brothers Yoshihiro, Toshihisa and Iehisa who would, for a short time, see the Shimazu clan take over the entire island of Kyūshū; he is also said to have a daughter of unknown name.

Takahisa actively promoted relationships with foreign people and countries. He was the first daimyo to bring Western firearms into Japan, following the shipwreck of a number of Portuguese on Tanegashima in 1543. In 1549, he welcomed St. Francis Xavier and met Xavier in Ijyuin Castle. He granted the Jesuit protection to spread Christianity in his domain, but later retracted his support of Christianity under pressure from local Buddhist monks. Takahisa also held a diplomatic relationship with the Ryūkyū Kingdom.

In 1549, he used &quot;Portuguese-derived&quot; firearms to take Kajiki castle.

In 1554, Shimazu Takahisa had to take action against his rebellious kokujin vassals, Ito clan and Kimotsuki clan, at Siege of Iwatsurugi Castle.

In 1570, he relinquished the family head position to Shimazu Yoshihisa. He died in 1571.

<text>Deseret Book () is an American publishing company headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, that also operates a chain of bookstores throughout the western United States. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Deseret Management Corporation (DMC), the holding company for business firms owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Deseret Book is a for-profit corporation registered in Utah. Deseret Book publishes under four imprints with media ranging from works explaining Latter-day Saint theology and doctrine, fiction, electronic resources, and sound recordings such, as The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square albums.

==History==

The Deseret Book Company was created in 1919 from a merger of the Deseret News Bookstore and the Deseret Sunday School Union Bookstore. Both of these Utah bookstores trace their roots to George Q. Cannon, an LDS Church general authority. &quot;Deseret&quot; is a word from the Book of Mormon that is said to mean &quot;honeybee.&quot;

===George Q. Cannon &amp; Sons===
George Q. Cannon published the first issue of &quot;Juvenile Instructor&quot; magazine in 1866. Cannon organized the Deseret Sunday School Union, an LDS Church organization responsible for educating young church members, and the magazine was the first church periodical oriented toward youth. Cannon opened the George Q. Cannon &amp; Sons bookstore in 1867 to sell the magazine and other publications of an uplifting nature. Cannon believed that secular novels did not reflect Latter-day Saint values. In the 1880s, Cannon expanded with a branch in Ogden, Utah.

It is not known how many books Cannon &amp; Sons actually published itself. In that era, authors commonly self-published their books, which were then distributed by others. However, Cannon &amp; Sons distributed several important books through their stores and mail order (see table).

The company had extensive ties to the LDS Church-owned newspaper, the &quot;Deseret News&quot;. Five of Cannon&#x27;s sons held important positions in the paper, and Cannon himself was editor between 1867 and 1872, and again while temporarily owning the paper from 1892 to 1898. Nearly every George Q. Cannon &amp; Sons book was printed on the &quot;Deseret News&quot; press. Cannon sold the bookstore to the LDS Church in 1900, near the end of his life. The church combined the two businesses, and the remaining Salt Lake City bookstore became Deseret News Bookstore.

===Deseret News Bookstore===
By 1906, Deseret News press had a Linotype machine and dedicated book press. Many significant volumes were published and distributed through the Deseret News Bookstore. Of these, the most successful was James E. Talmage&#x27;s &quot;Jesus the Christ&quot;. Published in 1915, the book quickly went through numerous printings as the LDS Church&#x27;s First Presidency authorized its use in its Sunday School program.

Meanwhile, the Deseret Sunday School Union, still publishing the money-losing &quot;Juvenile Instructor&quot;, struggled to maintain its distribution center, the Deseret Sunday School Union Bookstore. Aimed at church supply, the bookstore sold textbooks, minutes ledgers, and sacrament trays, as well as popular books. Beginning in 1891, the non-profit Union asked for yearly five-cent contributions from Sunday school pupils on &quot;Nickel Sunday.&quot; Facing over $12,000 in debt in 1914, donations requested increased to ten cents, and 1919 a committee formed to study the organizations solvency. Led by Talmage, the committee recommended consolidation of the Sunday School Bookstore with the Deseret News Bookstore.

===Deseret Book===
By 1920, both antecedent bookstores were closed and a single new Deseret Book Company building was constructed in downtown Salt Lake City at site of the former ZCMI Center Mall. Ownership of Deseret Book was split between the &quot;Deseret News&quot; (70%) and the Deseret Sunday School Union (30%). However, the Union would manage the bookstore until 1932 when Deseret Book was incorporated for-profit as the &quot;Utah Company&quot;. The &quot;Deseret News&quot; bought out the Sunday School Union in 1948 to become sole owner of the bookstore, but both the &quot;Deseret News&quot; and Deseret Book are now subsidiaries of DMC, which manages for-profit assets of the LDS Church. Deseret News Press printed nearly all Deseret Book publications until the 1960s when the company began seeking other competitive bids.

Through the 1930s, the bookstore focused mostly on Sunday school needs such as lesson manuals. Though the bookstore introduced relatively few new authors, several important works were published in this period. Notably, B. H. Roberts&#x27; magnum opus, the six-volume &quot;Comprehensive History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot;, 1930. Deseret Book did not accept manuscripts for publication until the 1940s when the company made a push for new authors.

Deseret Book expanded into motion picture equipment and photographic supplies in the 1940s. Winning an exclusive contract to distribute for Bell &amp; Howell in Utah and parts of Idaho and Wyoming, Deseret Book supplied 16 mm film projectors to the LDS Church. Becoming a film distribution and rental outfit, the Deseret Book &quot;Censorship Committee on Films&quot; was established in 1946 because regular employees were unable to review all the films it handled. By 1950, 18 members sat on the committee.

Preceding modern Latter-day Saint cinema by over 50 years, Deseret Book founded Deseret Film Productions in 1947. The first film, produced by Frank Wise, was &quot;Where the Saints have Trod&quot;, an 80-minute film celebrating the 100-year anniversary of Mormon pioneers entering the Salt Lake Valley. Wise subsequently produced &quot;Temple Square&quot;, a 30-minute filmed tour of Salt Lake City&#x27;s most popular tourist location. Deseret Film recorded over 120 general conference talks over a six-year period. Intended for rental to wards, the conference talks are the first motion pictures of the church&#x27;s conferences.

In the 1950s, Brigham Young University (BYU) established a motion picture department which attracted Frank Wise. Deseret Film Productions was gradually disbanded. Soon, KSL-TV began covering general conferences.

Deseret Book&#x27;s downtown location remained the only store until 1959 when site for an Ogden, Utah branch was donated. Stores in Orange, California and Salt Lake County opened in malls in 1962. In the 1970s, the original location was torn down to make way for the ZCMI Center Mall where the store reopened on April 2, 1976, during a general conference to attract large crowds. Several more mall locations opened in the 1970s; in Northridge, California, Boise, Idaho, and many more locations in Utah. In 1997, Deseret Book opened its first Washington state location in the city of Bellevue. By 2004, Deseret Book operated over 33 stores in 9 western US states. Expanding its reach in eastern Idaho, the chain also purchased Beehive Book Stores, located in Rexburg, Idaho Falls, and Blackfoot, Idaho. Deseret Book already operated in Idaho Falls at the Grand Teton Mall and in Rexburg. The new store in Rexburg has expanded merchandise selection from the prior two stores.

In the late 1970s, Deseret Book coordinated publication of new editions of the King James Version of the Bible and the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot;/&quot;Doctrine and Covenants&quot;/&quot;Pearl of Great Price&quot; &quot;Triple combination&quot;. The 1979 publication of the Bible was the first geared toward Latter-day Saints. A comparably styled &quot;triple combination&quot; was introduced in 1981. With notes from the Joseph Smith Translation, Talmage&#x27;s scripture commentary, and an index and &quot;topical guide&quot;, the new editions are now standard in the LDS Church. Typesetting for the volumes was done by Cambridge University Press.

Deseret Book began publishing Latter-day Saint fiction for the first time in 1979. In 1986, it purchased Mormon Handicraft–a handmade crafts store–from the Relief Society. As inventory and distribution was centralized in 1984, Deseret Book expanded its lines to include items such as CTR rings and more popular music.

In 2002, Sheri L. Dew became the first female CEO and president of Deseret Book.

Deseret Book established new corporate offices and downtown Salt Lake City retail space during the redevelopment of the Crossroads Plaza Mall into City Creek Center. In 2007, the corporate headquarters, with around 160 employees, moved into the top seven floors of the Utah Woolen Mills Clothiers building across the street from Temple Square. In April 2010 Deseret Book opened its &quot;Flagship&quot; store in the City Creek Center. This new store sits almost exactly on the same location as the first Deseret Book Location.

==Acquisitions==

===Bookcraft===
In early 1999, Bookcraft was acquired by Deseret Book. This allowed them to expand in the larger &quot;values-oriented&quot; publishing market. The merger also brought more writings by general authorities under the church&#x27;s ownership, allowing for electronic and print collaborations with other DMC entities (the Deseret News, and Bonneville International) and church entities (such as BYU and the Church Educational System).

===Excel Entertainment Group===

On November 15, 2004, Deseret Book announced that it had acquired Excel Entertainment Group, a 10-year-old company based in Salt Lake City which was known for its Latter-day Saint cinema productions as well as its record labels, including Highway Records, Joyspring Records, and Embryo Records (later renamed to Lumen Records). Jeff Simpson, the founder and president of Excel, became the new executive vice president of the merged company. Both companies are privately held, so terms of the deal were not publicly released. Although some Excel employees were relocated to Shadow Mountain music at Deseret Book headquarters, most remained at the separate Excel headquarters in Salt Lake City.

===Seagull Book and Covenant Communications===

In July 2006, Deseret Book threatened to discontinue sales with another Latter-day Saint bookstore chain, Seagull Book &amp; Tape, citing marketing differences.&lt;ref name=&quot;ksl_article_7/2006&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Seagull claimed that their discounted prices on Deseret Book&#x27;s products was the reason for the threat. Seagull Book &amp; Tape competed with Deseret Book&#x27;s retail operation, but depended on the company&#x27;s published work, which reportedly accounted for most of its sales. Deseret Book later opted to renegotiate its distribution contract with Seagull. On December 28, 2006, it was announced that Deseret Book was buying both Seagull Book &amp; Tape and the publisher Covenant Communications, from Lewis Kofford. Company officials said they intended to continue running all three businesses as separate entities.

== Deseret Book imprints ==
After Deseret Book acquired Bookcraft in 1999, it divided its publishing into four differently marketed imprints: Deseret Book for history and doctrine; Bookcraft for self-help, family, children, women&#x27;s interests, and Latter-day Saint fiction; Eagle Gate for art, niche markets, library editions, and teaching aides; and Shadow Mountain for &quot;values-based&quot; publications for a national audience. A decade later, the only imprints that remained in use were Deseret Book and Shadow Mountain. In 2012, the Ensign Peak imprint was created for Latter-day Saint religious writings for a national audience.

After acquiring Covenant Communications in 2006, Deseret Book Company did not make it an additional imprint, but continued its independent operations as a publisher alongside Deseret Book Publishing.

==Shadow Mountain Records==
The Shadow Mountain Records label, owned by Deseret Books, releases music aimed at Latter-day Saint audiences and reflecting Latter-day Saint themes. Releases by Shadow Mountain Records have ranked in top spots on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, including violinist Jenny Oaks Baker, and pianist Josh Wright.

The following artists have released albums on Shadow Mountain Records:

* Julie de Azevedo 
*Jenny Oaks Baker
* Dallyn Vail Bayles 
*Kurt Bestor
*Alex Boyé
*Paul Cardall
*Kenneth Cope
* Eclipse 6
*Gladys Knight
*Jericho Road

== Other business ==
Deseret Book operates further business units in addition to its publishing and retail activities. Under the name Zion&#x27;s Mercantile it produces home decor and religious art and holds events such as women&#x27;s conferences in the United States and Canada. &quot;LDS Living&quot; is an LDS lifestyle magazine in print and online. Deseret Book Direct sells publications through catalogs, e-mail, and the DeseretBook.com website. From 2000 to 2009 it also operated an auctions website for Latter-day Saint books. Crafts and other handmade items are sold under the name of Mormon Handicraft (a brand purchased from the LDS Church&#x27;s Relief Society in 1986) and food is sold through The Lion House Pantry brand. It also provides the texts of many of its books online with paid subscriptions at GospeLink.com.

In 2009, selected Deseret Book locations partnered with the LDS Church&#x27;s Distribution Center and began selling official church items, such as temple garments, which had originally been available only in church distribution centers. That working relationship has expanded and now half of Deseret Book&#x27;s 39 stores have been &quot;integrated&quot; and are half Deseret Book and half Distribution Centers.

<doc id="1192730" wikidata="Q7871756" url="?curid=1192730" title="USS Metacomet (1863)">
<text>The second USS &quot;Metacomet&quot; was a wooden sidewheel steamer in the United States Navy during the American Civil War. The ship was named for Metacomet, a war chief of the Wampanoag Indians.

&quot;Metacomet&quot; was launched on 7 March 1863 by Thomas Stack, Brooklyn, New York, and commissioned at New York on 4 January 1864 under the captaincy of Commander James E. Jouett.
==Civil War==
&quot;Metacomet&quot; joined the West Gulf Blockading Squadron in the blockade of Mobile Bay and captured British blockade runner &quot;Donegal&quot; on 6 June. On the 30th, &quot;Glasgow&quot; forced blockade runner &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; ashore near Fort Morgan, whose guns protected the ship from destruction by the Union. Unsuccessful in efforts to destroy her by long-range fire from &quot;Metacomet&quot; and , Admiral David Farragut ordered a boat expedition to attempt the task. Under cover of darkness, boats from &quot;Metacomet&quot; and slipped in close to shore and burned the steamer.

&quot;Metacomet&quot; and 17 other ships entered Mobile Bay in a double column on 5 August 1864. In the ensuing battle &quot;Metacomet&quot; and other Union ships captured Confederate ram , a major threat to the blockaders at Mobile. Farragut&#x27;s ships maintained a heavy fire on Fort Morgan and Confederate gunboats, capturing . &quot;Metacomet&quot; then rescued survivors from Union monitor , sunk by a Confederate torpedo. Six &quot;Metacomet&quot; sailors were awarded the Medal of Honor for helping rescue the crew of the &quot;Tecumseh&quot;: Seaman James Avery, Quarter Gunner Charles Baker, Ordinary Seaman John C. Donnelly, Captain of the Forecastle John Harris, Seaman Henry Johnson, and Landsman Daniel Noble. A further two sailors, Boatswain&#x27;s Mate Patrick Murphy and Coxswain Thomas Taylor, were awarded the medal for their conduct during the battle. After the battle, all Confederate and Union wounded were transferred to &quot;Metacomet&quot;, which was then allowed to leave for the U.S. Naval Hospital in Pensacola after passing Fort Morgan under a flag of truce.

After offloading the wounded, &quot;Metacomet&quot; steamed to the Texas coast and captured blockade runner &quot;Susanna&quot; off Campechy Banks on 28 November, and took schooner &quot;Sea Witch&quot; and sloop &quot;Lilly&quot; off Galveston on 31 December 1864 and 6 January 1865, respectively.

Mines, then called &quot;torpedoes&quot;, remained a danger to shipping in waters near Mobile, so &quot;Metacomet&quot; returned there to drag the Bay and Blakely Channel from 9 March-12 April. Returning north after the end of the conflict, &quot;Metacomet&quot; decommissioned at Philadelphia on 18 August and was sold there to John Roach &amp; Sons on 28 October.

First-class cricketer and coal miner Enoch Tranter (1842-1910), player for Lancashire, died at Donnington Wood.

Jockey Sir Gordon Richards was born in Donnington Wood at Ivy Row, part of a new demolished row of cottages on whose site are the apartment blocks &#x27;Gordon House&#x27; and &#x27;Richards House&#x27;. A local pub in nearby Donnington was named after him: &quot;The Champion Jockey&quot;.

<doc id="1192748" wikidata="Q2569308" url="?curid=1192748" title="Dawley">
<text>Dawley ( ) is a former mining town and civil parish in the borough of Telford and Wrekin, Shropshire, England. It was originally proposed be the main centre of the &#x27;Dawley New Town&#x27; plan in 1963, however it was decided in 1968 to name the new town as &#x27;Telford&#x27;, after the engineer and road-builder Thomas Telford. Dawley is one of the older settlements in Shropshire, being mentioned in the Domesday Book (1086). It is divided into &quot;Dawley Magna&quot; (&quot;Great Dawley&quot;) and Little Dawley (also shown as &quot;Dawley Parva&quot; (&quot;Little Dawley&quot;) on older maps).

==Etymology==
The name Dawley comes from Old English meaning &quot;woodland clearing associated with a man called Dealla&quot;.

==Local government==
The town&#x27;s main civil parish is officially called Great Dawley – its parish council is officially Great Dawley Town Council. Dawley Hamlets is a separate civil parish, which covers Little Dawley and other neighbouring villages/suburbs.

In 1894 Dawley became an urban district, the urban district contained the parish of Dawley Magna or Dawley, on 1 April 1974 the district was abolished to form Wrekin, the parish was also abolished. In 1961 the parish had a population of 9558. On 1 April 1988 a parish called &quot;Great Dawley&quot; was formed.

==Railways==
Unlike the other towns in Telford and Wrekin, Dawley never had its own railway station to serve the town itself. Two railway stations served the town despite being some distance from Dawley itself. The nearest station to the town was Dawley and Stirchley, located roughly 1 mile to the southeast of the town under Stirchley Lane and also served the neighboring village of Stirchley. It opened in 1860 on the Coalport branch line but closed in 1952 along with the line. The trackbed including the platform now form part of the Silkin Way. The other station is in nearby Horsehay, located 1 mile to the southwest of the town. It is on the former Wellington to Craven Arms Line and originally closed in 1962, before being reopened by the Telford Steam Railway. It now serves as a heritage railway station. The nearest mainline station for the town is Telford Central.

==History==
Dawley is mentioned in the Domesday Book and is therefore one of the older settlements in Shropshire.

There was a castle in Dawley, but it was demolished around 1648. The site is unknown, although the Castle Pools (on the old quarry site) and Castle Ironworks (built by the Darby family, one of whom commissioned the world-famous Iron Bridge) possibly indicate the general area where it may have stood. Prior to the landscaping that followed the creation of Telford New Town, extensive ruins were detectable next to the Castle Pools and are shown on old maps as being the location of the castle, but, in the 1980s, the whole area was buried under thick topsoil and planted with trees. Ironbridge is a short distance away.

For over three centuries, Dawley was a mining town, both for coal and ironstone. Clay extraction, for local industrial-pipe factories, brickyards and the pottery industry, have been major influences on the landscape. Mining had an important impact on the local culture. In 1821, production at Dawley&#x27;s ironworks of was halted by striking miners in protest at lowering of their wages. Many of the workers in Dawley joined a larger group of protesters in what came to be known as the Cinderloo Uprising. In 1872, the Springwell Pit Disaster resulted in the deaths of eight men and boys.

Prior to large-scale levelling as part of the development of Telford New Town, the area was covered by clay mounds and large clay pits that dominated the landscape, to the extent that they formed points of reference for the locals. There is still a local clay-pipe factory in the adjacent Doseley village; grey clay predominates on the immediate outskirts of Dawley.

The adjacent village of Horsehay was the site of a bridge and later a crane fabrication factory that exported around the world. The Victoria Falls Bridge is wrongly claimed to have been built there. Telford Steam Railway trust is located across the road from the former factory site.

Dawley Town Hall opened as a temperance hall, in 1873.

On 7 June 2010, Dawley had become subject to a lot of media attention because some locals had recreated the &#x27;Hollywood&#x27; sign on a noticeable bank on Paddock Mount but with &quot;Dawley&quot; instead of &quot;Hollywood&quot;. The Shropshire Star had a full-page spread article on that day&#x27;s evening edition to honour the effort made by the locals. As of midday on 8 June, over 1000 people had joined a Facebook group showing support for the sign, acknowledging the efforts of its creators, and in protest against the controversial redevelopment of the mount to move the Phoenix Academy (now the Telford Langley School) there.

Dawley is known for its dialect, which includes some quite unique words, including &quot;bist&quot;, presumably from the German meaning &quot;are&quot;. However, the dialect is largely lost. Along with the dialect were various conventions and traditions, notably the &quot;pig on the wall&quot;. Traditionally, Dawley residents would show their support for The Dawley Prize Band or other civic marches by placing their pigs on their walls. The pig also features in the dialect, with a romantic phrase apparently being &quot;I wudna swop thee for a big black pig!&quot;

==Geography==
Dawley has a street-market every Friday. Dawley town centre consists of a single pedestrianised street that was previously the main route from Bridgnorth in the south to Wellington in the north. The area around Dawley, not covered by Telford New Town, is rural and provides extensive opportunities for walking. The Ironbridge Gorge and The Wrekin are both pleasant walks from Dawley.

On the northern edge of Dawley is Malinslee where St. Leonards church stands.
The design of St. Leonards, a slightly irregular octagon, is said to have been influenced by Thomas Telford.
Other churches supposedly influenced by Thomas Telford during his work in Shropshire are at nearby Madeley and Bridgnorth.
==Education==
There are seven primary schools in the Dawley area, and a comprehensive secondary school, Telford Langley School. There are two special schools in Dawley: Queensway South campus (formerly Mount Gilbert School) and Southall School.

<text>&lt;/math&gt;|
 kurtosis =formula_1|

 mgf =formula_2|
 char =formula_3

The Skellam distribution is the discrete probability distribution of the difference formula_4 of two statistically independent random variables formula_5 and formula_6 each Poisson-distributed with respective expected values formula_7 and formula_8. It is useful in describing the statistics of the difference of two images with simple photon noise, as well as describing the point spread distribution in sports where all scored points are equal, such as baseball, hockey and soccer.

The distribution is also applicable to a special case of the difference of dependent Poisson random variables, but just the obvious case where the two variables have a common additive random contribution which is cancelled by the differencing: see Karlis &amp; Ntzoufras (2003) for details and an application.

The probability mass function for the Skellam distribution for a difference formula_9 between two independent Poisson-distributed random variables with means formula_7 and formula_8 is given by:

:formula_12

where &quot;Ik&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind. Since &quot;k&quot; is an integer we have that &quot;Ik&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)=&quot;I|k|&quot;(&quot;z&quot;).

== Derivation ==

The probability mass function of a Poisson-distributed random variable with mean μ is given by

:formula_13

for formula_14 (and zero otherwise). The Skellam probability mass function for the difference of two independent counts formula_9 is the convolution of two Poisson distributions: (Skellam, 1946)

:formula_16
Since the Poisson distribution is zero for negative values of the count formula_17, the second sum is only taken for those terms where formula_18 and formula_19. It can be shown that the above sum implies that

:formula_20

so that:

:formula_21

where &quot;I&quot; k(z) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind. The special case for formula_22 is given by Irwin (1937):

:formula_23

Using the limiting values of the modified Bessel function for small arguments, we can recover the Poisson distribution as a special case of the Skellam distribution for formula_24.

== Properties ==

As it is a discrete probability function, the Skellam probability mass function is normalized:

:formula_25

We know that the probability generating function (pgf) for a Poisson distribution is:

:formula_26

It follows that the pgf, formula_27, for a Skellam probability mass function will be:

:formula_28

Notice that the form of the probability-generating function implies that the distribution of the sums or the differences of any number of independent Skellam-distributed variables are again Skellam-distributed. It is sometimes claimed that any linear combination of two Skellam distributed variables are again Skellam-distributed, but this is clearly not true since any multiplier other than formula_29 would change the support of the distribution and alter the pattern of moments in a way that no Skellam distribution can satisfy.

The moment-generating function is given by:

:formula_30

which yields the raw moments &quot;m&quot;&quot;k&quot; . Define:

:formula_31

:formula_32

Then the raw moments &quot;m&quot;&quot;k&quot; are

:formula_33

:formula_34

:formula_35

The central moments &quot;M&quot; &quot;k&quot; are

:formula_36

:formula_37

:formula_38

The mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis excess are respectively:

:formula_39

The cumulant-generating function is given by:

:formula_40

which yields the cumulants:

:formula_41
:formula_42

For the special case when μ1 = μ2, an
asymptotic expansion of the modified Bessel function of the first kind yields for large μ:

:formula_43

(Abramowitz &amp; Stegun 1972, p. 377). Also, for this special case, when &quot;k&quot; is also large, and of order of the square root of 2μ, the distribution tends to a normal distribution:

:formula_44

These special results can easily be extended to the more general case of different means.

===Bounds on weight above zero===
If formula_45, with formula_46, then

::formula_47

Details can be found in Poisson distribution#Poisson races

<text>Danger Crue Records is a Japanese visual kei independent record label located in Tokyo, Japan. It was originally the record label of the Danger Crue music office, both founded in 1981. According to D&#x27;erlanger drummer Tetsu, Danger Crue was formed for the heavy metal band 44Magnum. The first release by Danger Crue was the album &quot;Insane&quot; by Reaction in July 1985. In April 2000, the office changed its name to the Maverick D.C. Group but continues to run the Danger Crue Records label.

In 2002, Maverick D.C. held a concert to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Danger Crue. It has since become an annual year-end event under the name Jack in the Box since 2007; derived from the nickname of Maverick D.C. president Masahiro Oishi. On December 27, 2021, Jack in the Box celebrated Danger Crue&#x27;s 40th anniversary at the Nippon Budokan.

<text>How to Kill Your Neighbor&#x27;s Dog is a 2000 American black comedy film written and directed by Michael Kalesniko. It stars Kenneth Branagh and Robin Wright Penn.

==Plot==
Peter McGowan is a chain-smoking, impotent, insomniac British playwright who lives in Los Angeles. Once very successful, he is now in the tenth year of a decade-long string of production failures. His latest play is in the hands of effeminate director Brian Sellars, who is obsessed with Petula Clark; his wife Melanie is determined to have a baby; he finds himself bonding with a new neighbor&#x27;s lonely young daughter who has mild cerebral palsy; and during one of his middle-of-the-night strolls, he encounters his oddball doppelgänger who claims to be Peter McGowan and develops a friendship of sorts with him.

==Cast==
==Production==
Petula Clark&#x27;s recordings of &quot;I Couldn&#x27;t Live Without Your Love&quot; and &quot;A Groovy Kind of Love&quot; were heard during the opening and closing credits respectively, and &quot;Downtown 99&quot;, a disco remix of her 1964 classic &quot;Downtown&quot;, was heard during a party scene. Additional songs originally recorded by Petula Clark were sung by the character of Brian Sellars throughout the film.

==Reception==
The film holds a 59% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 34 reviews.

In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden described the film as &quot;a Hollywood rarity, a movie about an icy grown-up heart-warmed by a child that doesn&#x27;t wield emotional pliers to try to squeeze out tears…. It is a tribute to Mr. Branagh&#x27;s considerable comic skills that he succeeds in making a potentially insufferable character likable by infusing him with the same sly charm that Michael Caine musters to seduce us into cozying up to his sleazier alter egos…. Mr. Kalesniko&#x27;s satirically barbed screenplay, whose spirit harks back to the comic heyday of Blake Edwards, stirs up an insistent verbal energy that rarely flags.&quot;

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the movie a B and said, &quot;Branagh, in his most forceful non-Shakespeare screen performance, grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit.&quot; Justine Elias of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; stated it was &quot;slight but unendurable…its fractured time frame gets confusing&quot;.

The film was the closing night film at the 2000 Toronto International Film Festival and won multiple festival awards. It was released as &quot;Mad Dogs and Englishmen&quot; in Australia.

<doc id="1192773" wikidata="Q4916900" url="?curid=1192773" title="Birnirk culture">
<text>The Birnirk culture was a prehistoric Inuit culture of the Chukchi Peninsula of Russia and the north coast of Alaska, dating from the 6th century AD, to the 12th century AD. The Birnirk culture first appeared on the American side of the Bering Strait, descending from the Old Bering Sea/Okvik culture and preceding the Thule culture; it is distinguished by its advanced harpoon and marine technology.
A burial mound of the Birnirk culture was discovered in the town of Wales, Alaska; 16 more have been found in Utqiagvik at the &quot;Birnirk site,&quot; which is now a National Historic Landmark. An ancient Birnirk village has been found at present-day Ukpiaġvik.

== Culture ==
The Birnirk people lived in small single family dwellings containing either a long or short entrance that led to a single room with sleeping platforms. Houses lacked open fireplaces; instead, heat and light were provided by stone and clay lamps. Birnirk settlements are thought to have been small, with only a few families living in a settlement at a time. As such, the concept of the Birnirk people whaling is often debated. Most communities involved in whaling require several crews, which would have been difficult for the Birnirk as they had such small settlements. However, a whaling harpoon found in Utqiagvik, along with artifacts derived from whale parts found in other sites (baleen, whale bones, and the like) suggest that the Birnirk people were involved in some form of whale hunts. They were also known to hunt seals, caribou, birds, and fish using a variety of tools.

== Tools ==
A multitude of Birnirk instruments have been found. They were skilled seal hunters, known for their use of innovative equipment, such as ice scratchers to lure seals over frozen waters. They are characterized by the style of the harpoons they used for hunting seals and other marine animals; the heads of the harpoons were self-pointed and had a &quot;single lateral barb and an opposing chipped-stone side blade inset&quot;. In addition to their harpoons, the Birnirk people were known for their use of ground slate weapons. These weapons include knives, blades, arrows, and spears, usually utilized in hunting terrestrial animals.

==Genetics==

A genetic study published in &quot;Science&quot; in August 2014 examined the remains of five Birnirk people buried in Siberia between ca. 570 AD and 680 AD. The five samples of mtDNA extracted all belonged to haplogroup A2a. Haplogroup A2a was also the predominant maternal lineage among the Thule people. The genetic evidence suggested that the Thule people descended from Birnirk migrants from Siberia who entered northern Canada and Greenland some time after 1300 AD, where they completely replaced the genetically distinct indigenous Dorset people.

<doc id="1192776" wikidata="Q7954179" url="?curid=1192776" title="WPBS-TV">
<text>WPBS-TV (channel 16) is a PBS member television station in Watertown, New York, United States, owned by the St. Lawrence Valley Educational TV Council. The station&#x27;s studios are located on Arsenal Street in Watertown, and its transmitter is located on St. Lawrence County Route 194 in Denmark, New York.

WNPI-DT (channel 18) in Norwood operates as a full-time satellite of WPBS; this station&#x27;s transmitter is located in South Colton, New York. WNPI covers areas of northeastern New York that receive a marginal to non-existent signal from WPBS, although there is significant overlap between the two stations&#x27; contours otherwise. WNPI is a straight simulcast of WPBS; on-air references to WNPI are limited to Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-mandated hourly station identifications during programming. Aside from the transmitter, WNPI does not maintain any physical presence locally in Norwood.

The two stations service most of northeastern New York as well as Ottawa and Kingston, Ontario, Canada; their slogan &quot;Your Two-Nation Station&quot; reflects this Canadian audience.

==History==
The St. Lawrence Valley Educational Television Council, which was organized in 1958, originally produced educational television programming to be carried by local CBS affiliate WWNY-TV (channel 7). In 1971, it established a free-standing PBS station, WNPE-TV, using WWNY&#x27;s original studios on Champion Hill as the commercial station had already relocated to a larger facility in Watertown. Full-time satellite WNPI-TV signed on a few weeks later. Outgrowing the Champion Hill location itself, WNPE moved to a new building in Watertown in 1978.

Because of its large Canadian viewership, WNPE was one of the more successful PBS stations, with fundraising totals often exceeding those of stations in much larger markets.

For a minor sum, the rights to use the WPBS call letters were purchased from a small radio station in Conyers, Georgia, in the late 1990s; the call sign change to WPBS-TV took effect on September 1, 1998. Following the shutdown of analog television signals, WPBS switched to a &quot;-DT&quot; suffix on July 2, 2009, as did WNPI; WPBS returned to the &quot;-TV&quot; suffix on March 11, 2020. Despite the calls, which mimic the callsign schemes used by stations owned by ABC, NBC and CBS in New York City and Los Angeles, WPBS-TV is not an owned-and-operated station (nor is similarly named KPBS in San Diego), as PBS cannot own or operate any of its member stations due to the network&#x27;s local and non-profit nature; the WPBS callsign reflects the station&#x27;s affiliation and programming, but not any special status within PBS.

Despite its strong viewership in Canada, Rogers Cable, the main cable provider in Ottawa, announced in July 2009 that it would replace WPBS on its systems with Detroit&#x27;s WTVS by mid-August to provide a higher-quality PBS feed, as WTVS could be fed via fiber optic cable rather than from over-the-air signals. Shortly after receiving this news, a Facebook campaign called &#x27;Save WPBS in Ottawa&#x27; (later renamed &#x27;Ottawa Loves WPBS&#x27;) urging Rogers to reconsider its decision to pull the station was launched, attracting hundreds of supporters, as well as local Ottawa politicians. On July 30, 2009, it was announced that WPBS would offer a fiber-optic feed of the station for Rogers transmitted from Buffalo, New York.

Erie, Pennsylvania&#x27;s WQLN, which serves viewers in the London, Ontario area through Rogers, was also threatened with removal from the Rogers system; as with WPBS, WQLN offered a fiber connection with Rogers.

==Programming==
WPBS produces a variety of programming for both local and national distribution. For many outside New York and the surrounding region, WPBS is synonymous with programming ranging from &quot;Rod and Reel&quot; and &quot;Streamside&quot; (distributed to PBS member stations nationally from 1985 to 2006). to &quot;Classical Stretch&quot; (distributed nationally since 1999 by APT). They also carry other nationally distributed programs from PBS and American Public Television.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The stations&#x27; signals are multiplexed:
The four digital subchannels are identical for both WPBS-TV and WNPI-DT.

The station had requested an increase in power from 40 kW to 60 kW for each digital transmitter. While this request had not been addressed by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission in time for WPBS/WNPI&#x27;s April 12, 2009, analog shutoff date, which was sooner than the June 12, 2009, date for American analog stations to end, a construction permit was issued later that year for the increased-power digital facilities.

WPBS-TV&#x27;s former analog channel number (UHF 16) was in use by WXXI-TV in Rochester from 2003 until 2019. WNPI-TV&#x27;s former analog channel number (UHF 18) and antenna location has been reassigned to WWNY-CD, a Massena rebroadcaster of Fox affiliate WNYF-CD.

==Coverage area==
WPBS-TV can be seen by a total of 2.2 million viewers. This is despite the fact it is the smallest PBS member in New York State; there are only 252,000 people in its American viewing area. However, the signal from its two towers reaches far enough to serve the Ottawa Valley region via cable. This market, with over 1.5 million people–almost six times the population of WPBS&#x27; American viewing area–is the fourth-largest in Canada. Much of WPBS&#x27; viewer support has also come from Canadian viewers, as 70% of donations during recent pledge drives came from viewers in Ottawa. The station also maintains a mailing address in Gananoque, Ontario to service its Canadian donors.

WPBS&#x27; service area comprises mostly rural areas and small towns. The only major urban areas in its service area are Ottawa and Kingston.

In the past, reflecting its two-nation audience, the U.S. and Canadian national anthems were played on station sign-on and sign-off.

<text>Peduncular hallucinosis (PH) is a rare neurological disorder that causes vivid visual hallucinations that typically occur in dark environments and last for several minutes. Unlike some other kinds of hallucinations, the hallucinations that patients with PH experience are very realistic, and often involve people and environments that are familiar to the affected individuals. Because the content of the hallucinations is never exceptionally bizarre, patients can rarely distinguish between the hallucinations and reality.

In 1922, the French neurologist Jean Lhermitte documented the case of a patient who was experiencing visual hallucinations that were suggestive of localized damage to the midbrain and pons. After other similar case studies were published, this syndrome was labeled &quot;peduncular hallucinosis.&quot;

The accumulation of additional cases by Lhermitte and by others influenced academic medical debate about hallucinations and about behavioral neurology.
Lhermitte provided a full account of his work in this area in his book &quot;Les hallucinations: clinique et physiopathologie,&quot; which was published in Paris in 1951 by Doin publishing.
Contemporary researchers, with access to new technologies in medical brain imaging, have confirmed the brain localization of these unusual hallucinations.

==Signs and symptoms==
The hallucinations are normally colorful, vivid images that occur during wakefulness, predominantly at night. Lilliputian hallucinations, hallucinations in which people or animals appear smaller than they would be in real life, are common in cases of peduncular hallucinosis. Most patients exhibit abnormal sleep patterns characterized by insomnia and daytime drowsiness. Peduncular hallucinosis has been described as a “release phenomenon” due to damage to the ascending reticular activating system, which is supported by the sleep disturbance characteristic of this syndrome. In most cases, people are aware that the hallucinations are not real. However, some people experience agitation and delusion and mistake their hallucinations for reality.

==Cause==
Peduncular hallucinosis is attributed to a range of various pathologies such as vascular and infectious midbrain, pontine and thalamic lesions, local subarachnoid hemorrhage, compression by tumors, basilar migraine, basilar vascular hypoplasia, and following regional surgical or angiographic interventions. These pathologies are mainly near the base of the brain and the hallucinations have gone away in patients that had their pathology corrected such as the removal of a tumor. The most commonly reported hallucinations are animals, people of any age, scary or deformed faces and heads, landscapes, or people walking in a line.

===Lesions===
The lesions that disturb brainstem reticular formation or thalamic targets seem to be the source behind peduncular hallucinosis. For example, lesions affecting the dorsal raphe system can lead to hallucinations by preventing ascending inhibition to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). This inhibition may hyper-excite the LGN, inducing visual hallucinations. Lesions of the retina and areas proximal to it can remove or alter the inputs coming in from the external environment to the visual system. Peduncular hallucinosis therefore might emanate from disturbances in distal portions of the visual system. Lesions in the frontal and temporal lobes can also lead to complex visual hallucinations because the lobes connect to the visual system via the lateral geniculate nucleus and medial pulvinar. In addition, visual processing and salience can be disrupted by thalamic lesions which affect important structures such as the pulvinar.

The effect lesions on the brainstem have on the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) has also been hypothesized. It was proposed that since the ARAS plays a role in consciousness and waking, the lesions of the brainstem common to peduncular hallucinosis may &quot;disrupt ARAS impulses from the brainstem reticular formation&quot; and, as a consequence, lead to the sleep disturbances characteristic of peduncular hallucinosis. The use of drugs such as Olanzapine may help treat sleep disturbances as it has been found to &quot;improve sleep continuity, sleep quality, and [to] increase slow wave sleep.&quot;

===Correlation between other diseases===
People diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, narcolepsy, delirium tremens, Lewy body dementia, and temporal lobe epilepsy are more prone to complex visual hallucinations such as peduncular hallucinosis. Peduncular hallucinosis is more common in patients with a long duration of Parkinson&#x27;s disease and also with a long treatment history, depression, and cognitive impairment. Paranoid delusions are common in these patients even though the hallucinations can occur during clear sensorium.

===Differences from other visual hallucinations===
Other visual hallucinations tend to stem from psychological disorders. Whereas a person with a psychological disorder thinks their hallucinations are real, people with peduncular hallucinosis normally know that the visual hallucinations they see are not real. Peduncular hallucinations are independent of seizures, unlike some other visual hallucinations.

==Diagnosis==
==Treatment==
Treatment of any kind of complex visual hallucination requires an understanding of the different pathologies in order to correctly diagnose and treat. If a person is taking a pro-hallucinogenic medication, the first step is to stop taking it. Sometimes improvement will occur spontaneously and pharmacotherapy is not necessary. While there is not a lot of evidence of effective pharmacological treatment, antipsychotics and anticonvulsants have been used in some cases to control hallucinations. Since peduncular hallucinosis occurs due to an excess of serotonin, modern antipsychotics are used to block both dopamine and serotonin receptors, preventing the overstimulation of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Carbamazepine increases GABA, which prevents the LGN from firing, thereby increasing the inhibition of the LGN. Regular antipsychotics as well as antidepressants can also be helpful in reducing or eliminating peduncular hallucinosis.

More invasive treatments include corrective surgery such as cataract surgery, laser photocoagulation of the retina, and use of optical correcting devices. Tumor removal can also help to relieve compression in the brain, which can decrease or eliminate peduncular hallucinosis. Some hallucinations may be due to underlying cardiovascular disease, so in these cases the appropriate treatment includes control of hypertension and diabetes. As described, the type of treatment varies widely depending on the causation behind the complex visual hallucinations.

==History==
The first documented case of peduncular hallucinosis was by French neurologist and neuropsychiatrist Jean Lhermitte, which described a 72-year-old woman’s visual hallucinations. The hallucinations occurred during normal conscious state and the patient’s neurological signs were associated with those characteristic of an infarct to the midbrain and pons. Von Bogaert, Lhermitte’s colleague, named this type of hallucination “peduncular,” in reference to the cerebral peduncles, as well as to the midbrain and its surroundings. In 1925, Von Bogaert was the first to describe the pathophysiology of peduncular hallucinosis through an autopsy of a patient. His autopsy revealed the infarction of many areas of the brain including the inferolateral red nucleus, superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray, third nerve nucleus, superior cerebellar peduncle, substantia nigra, and pulvinar. Later in 1932, Lhermitte, Levy, and Trelles discovered an association between peduncular hallucinosis and “pigmentary degeneration of the periaqueductal gray and the degeneration of the occulomotor nucleus.” Posterior thalamic lesions were also found to be linked to peduncular hallucinosis by De Morsier. More recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to localize lesions in the brain characteristic of peduncular hallucinosis. In 1987, the first case of peduncular hallucinosis was reported in which MRI was used to locate a midbrain lesion.
