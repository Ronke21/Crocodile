<text>Backscatter X-ray is an advanced X-ray imaging technology. Traditional X-ray machines detect hard and soft materials by the variation in x-ray intensity transmitted through the target. In contrast, backscatter X-ray detects the radiation that reflects from the target. It has potential applications where less-destructive examination is required, and can operate even if only one side of the target is available for examination.

The technology is one of two types of whole-body imaging technologies that have been used to perform full-body scans of airline passengers to detect hidden weapons, tools, liquids, narcotics, currency, and other contraband. A competing technology is millimeter wave scanner. One can refer to an airport security machine of this type as a &quot;body scanner&quot;, &quot;whole body imager (WBI)&quot;, &quot;security scanner&quot; or &quot;naked scanner&quot;.

==Deployments at airports==
In the United States, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 required that all full-body scanners operated in airports by the Transportation Security Administration use &quot;Automated Target Recognition&quot; software, which replaces the picture of a nude body with the cartoon-like representation. As a result of this law, all backscatter X-ray machines formerly in use by the Transportation Security Administration were removed from airports by May 2013, since the agency said the vendor (Rapiscan) did not meet their contractual deadline to implement the software.

In the European Union, backscatter X-ray screening of airline passengers was banned in 2012 to protect passenger safety.

==Technology==
Backscatter technology is based on the Compton scattering effect of X-rays, a form of ionizing radiation. Unlike a traditional X-ray machine, which relies on the transmission of X-rays through the object, backscatter X-ray detects the radiation that reflects from the object and forms an image. The backscatter pattern is dependent on the material property and is good for imaging organic material.

In contrast to millimeter wave scanners, which create a 3D image, backscatter X-ray scanners will typically only create a 2D image. For airport screening, images are taken from both sides of the human body.

Backscatter X-ray was first applied in a commercial low-dose personnel scanning system by Dr. Steven W. Smith. Smith developed the Secure 1000 whole-body scanner in 1992 and then sold the device and associated patents to Rapiscan Systems, who now manufactures and distributes the device.

== Large scale ==
Some backscatter X-ray scanners can scan much larger objects, such as trucks and containers. This scan is much faster than a physical search and could potentially allow a larger percentage of shipping to be checked for smuggled items, weapons, drugs, or people.

There are also gamma-ray-based systems coming to market.

In May 2011, the Electronic Privacy Information Center filed suit against the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the Freedom of Information Act, claiming that DHS had withheld nearly 1000 pages of documents related to the Z backscatter vans and other mobile backscatter devices.

==Concerns==
===Legality===
Since in addition to weapons, these machines are designed to be capable of detecting drugs, currency and contraband, which have no direct effect on airport security and passenger safety, some have argued that the use of these full body scanners is a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and can be construed as an illegal search and seizure.

===Privacy===

Backscatter x-ray technology has been proposed as an alternative to personal searches at airport and other security checkpoints easily penetrating clothing to reveal concealed weapons. It raises privacy concerns about what is seen by the person viewing the scan. Some worry that viewing the image violates confidential medical information, such as the fact a passenger uses a colostomy bag, has a missing limb or wears a prosthesis, or is transgender.

The ACLU and the Electronic Privacy Information Center are opposed to this use of the technology. The ACLU refers to backscatter x-rays as a &quot;virtual strip search&quot;. According to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), in one trial 79 percent of the public opted to try backscatter over the traditional pat-down in secondary screening.

It is &quot;possible for backscatter X-raying to produce photo-quality images of what&#x27;s going on beneath our clothes&quot;, thus, many software implementations of the scan have been designed to distort private areas. According to the TSA, further distortion is used in the Phoenix airport&#x27;s trial system where photo-quality images are replaced by chalk outlines. In light of this, some journalists have expressed concern that this blurring may allow people to carry weapons or certain explosives aboard by attaching the object or substance to their genitals.

The British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; has revealed concern among British officials that the use of such scanners to scan children may be illegal under the Protection of Children Act 1978, which prohibits the creation and distribution of indecent images of children. This concern may delay the introduction of routine backscatter scanning in UK airports, which had been planned in response to the attempted Christmas Day 2009 attack on Northwest Airlines Flight 253.

The Fiqh Council of North America have also issued the following fatwa in relation to full-body scanners:
In August 2010, it was reported that U.S. Marshals (part of the Department of Justice), saved thousands of images from a low resolution mm wave scanner: This machine does not show details of human anatomy, and is a different kind of machine from the one used in airports. TSA, part of the Department of Homeland Security, said that its scanners do not save images and that the scanners do not have the capability to save images when they are installed in airports, but later admitted that the scanners are required to be capable of saving images for the purpose of evaluation, training and testing.

===Health risks===
Unlike cell phone signals, or millimeter-wave scanners, the energy being emitted by a backscatter X-ray is a type of ionizing radiation that breaks chemical bonds. Ionizing radiation is considered carcinogenic even in very small doses but at the doses used in airport scanners this effect is believed to be negligible for an individual. If 1 million people were exposed to 520 scans in one year, one study estimated that roughly four additional cancers would occur due to the scanner, in contrast to the 600 additional cancers that would occur from the higher levels of radiation during flight.

Since the scanners do not have a medical purpose, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not need to subject them to the same safety evaluations as medical X-rays. However, the FDA has created a webpage comparing known estimates of the radiation from backscatter X-ray body scanners to that of other known sources, which cites various reasons they deem the technology to be safe.

Four professors at the University of California, San Francisco, among them members of NAS and an expert in cancer and imaging, in an April 2010 letter to the presidential science and technology advisor raised several concerns about the validity of the indirect comparisons the Food and Drug Administration used in evaluating the safety of backscatter x-ray machines. They argued that the effective dose is higher than claimed by the TSA and the body scanner manufacturers because the dose was calculated as if distributed throughout the whole body, whereas most of the radiation is absorbed in the skin and tissues immediately underneath. Other professors from the radiology department at UCSF disagree with the claims of the signing four professors.

The UCSF professors requested that additional data be made public detailing the specific data regarding sensitive areas, such as the skin and certain organs, as well as data on the special (high-risk) population. In October 2010, the FDA and TSA responded to these concerns. The letter cites reports which show that the specific dose to the skin is some 89,000 times lower than the annual limit to the skin established by the NCRP. Regarding the UCSF concerns over the high-risk population to sensitive organs, the letter states that such an individual &quot;would have to receive more than 1,000 screenings to begin to approach the annual limit&quot;.

John Sedat, the principal author of the UCSF letter, responded in November 2010 that the White House&#x27;s claim that full-body scanners pose no health risks to air travelers is in error, adding that the White House statement has &quot;many misconceptions, and we will write a careful answer pointing out their errors&quot;.

In a December 2, 2010 letter to the House of Representatives, Dr. Steven Smith, inventor of the body scanner in 1991, stated that the concerns of Brenner and UCSF regarding the skin dose of backscatter scanners is incorrect and the result of a confusion between dose and imaging penetration. Smith demonstrated this difference with two experiments using plastic (with a similar rate of absorption as body tissue), copper (the image subject), and an x-ray scanner. The dose-penetration experiment shows that plastic samples absorb 5% and 50% of the beam intensity respectively, whereas the imaging penetration experiment shows that plastic samples reduce the image darkness by 23% and 50% respectively. Dr. Smith states that those who calculate high skin dosage have incorrectly used the shallow imaging penetration value of a few millimeters (c. ), whereas the actual dosage is calculated by the deeper dose penetration.

The TSA has also made public various independent safety assessments of the Secure 1000 Backscatter X-ray Scanner.

Radiation safety authorities including the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, The Health Physics Society and the American College of Radiology, have stated that there is no specific evidence that full-body scans are unsafe. The Secure 1000 Backscatter X-ray scanner was developed in 1992 by Dr. Steve Smith. The scanner has been studied extensively for almost 20 years by the leading independent radiation safety authorities in the United States. Experimental and epidemiological data do not support the proposition, however, that there is a threshold dose of radiation below which there is no increased risk of cancer.

The UK Health Protection Agency has completed an analysis of the X-ray dose from backscatter scanners and has written that the dose is extremely low and &quot;about the same as people receive from background radiation in an hour&quot;.

The Health Physics Society (HPS) reports that a person undergoing a backscatter scan receives approximately 0.05 μSv (0.005 mrem) of radiation; American Science and Engineering Inc. reports 0.09 μSv (0.009 mrem). At the high altitudes typical of commercial flights, naturally occurring cosmic radiation is considerably higher than at ground level. The radiation dose for a six-hour flight is 20 μSv (2 mrem) – 200 to 400 times larger than a backscatter scan. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission limits radiation exposure to the public to less than 1 mSv (100 mrem) per year from nuclear power plants. While this is not specifically for airline-associated radiation, the limit is an effective proxy for understanding what level is deemed safe by a regulatory agency.

According to a draft standard on the United States FDA website, the allowable dose from a scan would be 0.1 μSv, and that report uses a model whereby a 0.01 μSv dose increases an individual&#x27;s risk of death by cancer during his or her lifetime by . Since the dose limit is ten times higher than 0.01 μSv, their model would predict one additional cancer death per 200 million scans. Since the airports in the UK handled 218 million passengers in 2009, if all passengers in the UK were scanned at the maximum dosage, then each year this would produce on average one additional cancer death (since there would be 200 million scans per year that the scanners were in operation), though usually each death would not occur in the same year as the particular scan that caused it, since the cancer may take years to grow. In addition, additional people would be given cancer but would die from other causes.

There may not yet be evidence of hereditary effects of x-rays administered by backscatter scanners, but backscatter scanners use the same kind of x-ray photons as are produced in medical x-ray machines but expose the subject at a considerably lower dose, so it is possible that the results from medical radiology may be relevant, at least until a study is done of any effects specific to backscatter x-ray machines. Fathers exposed to medical diagnostic x-rays are more likely to have infants who contract leukemia, especially if exposure is closer to conception or includes two or more X-rays of the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract or lower abdomen. In medical radiography the x-ray beam is adjusted to expose only the area of which an image is required, so that generally shielding is applied to the patient to avoid exposing the gonads, whereas in an airport backscatter scan, the testicles of men and boys will be deliberately subjected to the direct beam in order to check for weapons in the underpants, and some radiation will also reach the ovaries of female subjects. A linear dose-response relationship has been observed between x-ray dose and double-strand breaks in DNA in human sperm.

Extrapolations of cancer risk from minuscule exposures to radiation across large populations, however, are not supported by analysis by the National Council on Radiation Protection (NCRP). On May 26, 2010, NCRP issued a press release to address such comments about full body scanners that are compliant with ANSI N43.17. In Commentary No. 16 issued on May 26, 2010, it reads as follows:
According to NCRP, the use of statistical extrapolations that predict 1 death for every 200 million persons scanned for example (as above) is an unrealistic over-estimation.

Other scientists at Columbia University have made the following statements in support of the safety of body scanners:
Furthermore, other scientists claim the health effects of backscatter are well understood whereas those from millimeter wave scanners are not:
Experts evaluating backscatter x-ray machine technology have also argued that defects in the machines, damage from normal wear-and-tear, or software errors could focus an intense dose of radiation on just one spot of the body. For example, Dr. Peter Rez, a professor of physics at Arizona State University, has said, &quot;The thing that worries me the most, is not what happens if the machine works as advertised, but what happens if it doesn&#x27;t&quot;, adding that a potential malfunction of the machine could increase the radiation dose.

The designers and manufacturers of backscatter X-ray scanners claim that the scanners are designed to prevent the occurrence of these kinds of errors. The scanners&#x27; safety requirements include fail-safe controls and multiple overlapping interlocks. These features, combined with fault analysis, ensure that failure of any subsystem results in non-operation of the x-ray generator to prevent accidental exposures. In the United States, the TSA requires that certification to the ANSI N43.17 safety standard is performed by a third party and not by the manufacturer themselves.

The European Commission issued a report stating that backscatter x-ray scanners pose no known health risk, and that &quot;assuming all other conditions equal&quot;, that backscatter x-ray scanners, which expose people to ionizing radiation, should not be used when millimeter-wave scanners that &quot;have less effects on the human body&quot; are available.

However, the European Commission report provides no data substantiating its claim that &quot;all other conditions are equal&quot;. One area where backscatter X-ray scanners can provide better performance than MM wave scanners, for example, is in the inspection of the shoes, groin and armpit regions of the body.

In a study published in the &quot;Archives of Internal Medicine&quot; on March 28, 2011, researchers at the University of California &quot;calculated that fully implementing backscatter scanners would not significantly increase the lifetime risk of cancer for travelers&quot;. The researchers calculated that for every 100 million passengers who flew seven one-way flights, there would be one additional cancer.

===Efficacy===
In March 2012, scientist and blogger Jonathan Corbett demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the technology by publishing a viral video showing how he was able to get a metal box through backscatter x-ray and millimeter wave scanners (including the currently-used &quot;Automated Target Recognition&quot; scanners) in two US airports. In April 2012, Corbett released a second video interviewing a TSA screener, who described firearms and simulated explosives passing through the scanners during internal testing and training.

Backscatter scanners installed by the TSA until 2013 were unable to screen adequately for security threats inside hats and head coverings, casts, prosthetics and loose clothing. This technology limitation of current scanners often requires these persons to undergo additional screening by hand or other methods and can cause additional delay or feelings of harassment.

The next generation of backscatter scanners are able to screen these types of clothing, according to manufacturers; however, these machines are not currently in use in public airports.

In Germany, field tests on more than 800,000 passengers over a 10-month trial period concluded that scanners were effective, but not ready to be deployed in German airports due to a high rate of false alarms. The Italian Civil Aviation Authority removed scanners from airports after conducting a study that revealed them to be inaccurate and inconvenient. The European Commission decided to effectively ban backscatter machines. In a 2011 staff report by Republican Members of Congress about the TSA, airport body scanners were described as &quot;ineffective&quot; and &quot;easily thwarted&quot;.

==Safety regulations and standards==
In the US, manufacturers of security related equipment can apply for protection under the SAFETY act, which limits their financial liability in product liability cases to the amount of their insurance coverage. The Rapiscan Secure 1000 was listed in 2006.

In the US, an X-ray system can be considered to comply with requirements for general purpose security screening of humans if the device complies with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standard #N43.17.

In the most general sense, N43.17 states that a device can be used for general purpose security screening of humans if the dose to the subject is less than 0.25 μSv (25 μrem) per examination and complies with other requirements of the standard. This is comparable to the average dose due to background radiation (i.e. radioactivity within the surrounding environment) at sea level in 1.5 hours; it is also comparable to the dose from cosmic rays when traveling in an airplane at cruising altitude for two minutes.

Many types of X-ray systems can be designed to comply with ANSI N43.17 including transmission X-ray, backscatter X-ray and gamma ray systems. Not all backscatter X-ray devices necessarily comply with ANSI N43.17; only the manufacturer or end user can confirm compliance of a particular product to the standard.

ANSI standards use a standard of measurement algorithm called &quot;effective dose&quot; that considers the different exposure of all parts of the body and then weights them differently. The interior of the human body is given more weight in this survey, and the exterior, including the skin organ, are given less weight.

==Technical countermeasures==
Some people wish to prevent either the loss of privacy or the possibility of health problems or genetic damage that might be associated with being subjected to a backscatter X-ray scan. One company sells X-ray absorbing underwear which is said to have X-ray absorption equivalent to of lead. Another product, Flying Pasties, &quot;are designed to obscure the most private parts of the human body when entering full body airport scanners&quot;, but their description does not seem to claim any protection from the X-ray beam penetrating the body of the person being scanned.

<doc id="1203076" wikidata="Q2218091" url="?curid=1203076" title="Samuel Clesson Allen">
<text>Samuel Clesson Allen (January 5, 1772 – February 8, 1842) was a U.S. politician from Massachusetts during the first third of the 19th century. He began his career as a member of the Federalist Party, but later became a staunch supporter of Democratic presidents Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren.

Allen was born in Bernardston in the Province of Massachusetts Bay and schooled in nearby New Salem. He was descended from Edward Allen (1640–1696), who was born in England and settled in the Connecticut Colony. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1794, and was ordained as a Congregational minister. After serving three years in the pulpit, Allen began to study law, and was admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1800.

Allen began his career in politics in 1806, when he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He served in the House until 1810, then served in the Massachusetts Senate from 1812 to 1815. A year after leaving the state senate, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he sat as a Federalist from 1817 to 1829. He was a noted supporter of the John Quincy Adams administration.

After returning to Massachusetts, Allen became affected by the plight of western Massachusetts farmers and laborers, whose lives were being upended by industrialization. As a result of his observations and concerns, Allen became a vocal supporter of the Massachusetts Workingmen&#x27;s Party, and was the party&#x27;s unsuccessful nominee for state governor in 1833 and 1834.

Allen died in Northfield, Massachusetts, and was buried in Bernardston.

==Legacy==
Allen&#x27;s son, Elisha Hunt Allen, also served in the United States Congress.

<text>KSD (93.7 MHz, &quot;93.7 The Bull&quot;) is a country music radio station in St. Louis, Missouri. It is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc., with studios on Highlands Plaza Drive in St. Louis, south of Forest Park. KSD carries two nationally syndicated iHeartRadio programs on weekdays, &quot;The Bobby Bones Show&quot; in morning drive time and &quot;After MidNite with Granger Smith&quot; overnight.

KSD has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 74,000 watts. The transmitter is in Resurrection Cemetery in Shrewsbury, amid the towers for other FM and TV stations. KSD broadcasts using HD Radio technology, and formerly carried iHeartRadio&#x27;s classic country music service on its HD2 digital subchannel.

KSD is unusual as an FM station with only three letters in its call sign. The station inherited its call letters from its former AM sister station, KSD (now KTRS), which originated in the earliest days of broadcasting.

==History==

===KCFM===
On March 27, 1955, the station signed on the air under the KCFM call letters. KCFM was owned by the Commercial Broadcasting Company, and broadcast from the Boatmen&#x27;s Bank Building.

Its studios and transmitter moved to 532 DeBaliviere Avenue in 1959. For much of the 1960s and 1970s, KCFM broadcast a beautiful music format, playing quarter-hour sweeps of soft instrumental cover versions of popular songs with occasional middle of the road vocals.

===KSD-FM===
Combined Communications, the owners of KSD (550 AM), bought KCFM in 1978. After the completion of the sale, Combined relaunched KCFM as an adult contemporary music station. To trade on the AM station&#x27;s well-known call letters, on July 10, 1980, KCFM became KSD-FM. KSD-FM evolved into a hybrid of adult contemporary music and adult top 40 hits (also known as hot AC) under the &quot;KS94 FM&quot; moniker.

In August 1987, KSD-FM flipped to classic rock as &quot;The New 93.7 KSD-FM&quot;. That format lasted until January 1999, when KSD-FM briefly went back to hot AC as &quot;Mix 93.7&quot;.

===Country music===
At noon on October 9, 2000, KSD-FM switched to country music as &quot;93.7 The Bull&quot;, soon after WKKX (106.5 FM) dropped country to become smooth jazz-formatted WSSM. Due to a big ownership shakeup in 2000, Bonneville International ended up owning both competing St. Louis country stations. With 106.5 playing smooth jazz, that opened up a spot for a competitor to longtime country station WIL-FM, also owned by Bonneville.

The first song on &quot;The Bull&quot; was &quot;The Thunder Rolls&quot; by Garth Brooks. Since then, KSD-FM and WIL-FM have competed for St. Louis country music listeners, with each station trading the lead in the Nielsen ratings.

<doc id="1203084" wikidata="Q4984224" url="?curid=1203084" title="Buddhism in Malaysia">
<text>Buddhism is the second largest religion in Malaysia, after Islam, with 18.7% of Malaysia&#x27;s population being Buddhist, although some estimates put that figure at 21.6% when combining estimates of numbers of Buddhists with figures for adherents of Chinese religions which incorporate elements of Buddhism. Buddhism in Malaysia is mainly practised by the ethnic Malaysian Chinese, but there are also Malaysian Siamese, Malaysian Sri Lankans and Burmese in Malaysia that practice Buddhism such as Ananda Krishnan and K. Sri Dhammananda and a sizeable population of Malaysian Indians.
==History==

Buddhism was introduced to the Malays and also to the people of the Malay Archipelago as early as 200 BCE. Chinese written sources indicated that some 30 small Indianised states rose and fell in the Malay Peninsula. Malay-Buddhism began when Indian traders and priests traveling the maritime routes and brought with them Indian concepts of religion, government, and the arts. An archeology research group from Universiti Sains Malaysia in late June 2024 found three Sanskrit stone inscriptions containing mantras and doctrinal texts plus a complete stucco statue of Buddha within the grounds of the Bukit Choras complex not far from Bujang Valley in southwest Kedah dated around 8-9th centuries, earlier than those in Angkor Wat and Borobudur.

For many centuries the peoples of the region, especially the royal courts, synthesised Indian and indigenous ideas including Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism and that shaped their political and cultural patterns. However, the Malay Kedah Kingdom denounced Indian religion after the king of Chola from Tamil Nadu attacked them in the early 11th century. The king of Kedah, Phra Ong Mahawangsa, was the first Malay ruler to denounce the traditional Indian religion; he converted to Islam, and in the 15th century, during the golden age of the Malacca Sultanate, the majority of Malays converted to Islam.

== Status ==

According to the Malaysian constitution, the majority ethnic group, the Malays, are legally defined as Muslim. They constitute 60% of the population, with the remainder consisting mostly of Chinese, who are generally Buddhists or Christians, and to the lesser extent Indians, who are generally Hindus. There are also smaller numbers of other indigenous and immigrants; among the latter are Malaysians of Sinhalese, Thai, and Eurasian origin. Nearly all of the Buddhists in Malaysia live in urban areas, since they are mostly engaged in business or employed in various professions.

Recently, a number of Malaysian Buddhist leaders have responded to the decline in religious participation by the children of Buddhist families, have attempted to reformulate their message to address modern life more directly. Groups involved in these education efforts include the Buddhist Missionary Society Malaysia (BMSM), which was founded by late Ven K. Sri Dhammananda. BMSM leaders have argued that, while many educated youths seek an intellectual approach to Buddhism, an equally large number of people prefer to approach the religion through the tradition of ceremony and symbolism. In response to these needs, religious practices are carried out, but in a way that is simple and dignified, removing what can be seen as superstition. Efforts are made to explain why suttas are chanted, lamps lit, flowers offered, and so on.

As a religion without a supreme head to direct its development, Buddhism is practised in various forms, which, although rarely in open conflict, can sometimes lead to confusion among Buddhists. In Malaysia, some ecumenical moves have been made to coordinate the activities of different types of Buddhists. One example is the formation of the Joint Wesak Celebrations Committee of the temples in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, which coordinates the celebration of Wesak, a holiday commemorating the birth of the Buddha. An initiative has also begun to form a Malaysian Buddhist Council, representing the various sects of Buddhism in the country to extend the work of the development of Buddhism, especially in giving contemporary relevance to the practise of the religion, as well as to promote solidarity among Buddhists in general.

In 2013, a video of a group of Vajrayana Buddhist practitioners from Singapore conducting religious service in a surau had become viral on Facebook. Malaysian police have arrested a resort owner after he allowed 13 Buddhists to use a Muslim prayer room (surau) for their meditation at Kota Tinggi, Johor. The incident has been a frown upon Muslims in Malaysia. It has also become a hot topic in the social media. Following up at 28 August 2013, the controversial prayer room was demolished by the resort management within 21 days from the date of receipt of the notice after much protests by the residents of Kota Tinggi. At the time, Syed Ahmad Salim, the resort owner explained that he had allowed the group of Buddhists to use the surau for a meditation session as he was unaware that it was an offence.

==Distribution of Buddhists==

According to the 2010 Census, 5,620,483 people or 19.8% of the population identify themselves as Buddhists. Most Chinese Malaysian follow a combination of Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism and Chinese ancestral worship but, when pressed to specify their religion, will identify themselves as Buddhists. As a result, 83.6% of all the Chinese Malaysian self-identifying as Buddhists. Information collected in the census based on respondent&#x27;s answer and did not refer to any official document.

===By gender and ethnic group===
===By state or federal territory===
==Current problems==
The rights of religious minorities in Malaysia, including but not limited to those of Buddhists, Hindus and Sikhs, are sometimes described as hindered by the existing legal framework.

===Islam as the dominant religion===

Islam is the official religion of Malaysia. The constitution of Malaysia declares that Islam is the only religion of genuine Malay people. According to the Ketuanan Melayu doctrine, the &quot;bumiputera&quot; or autochthonous populations are required to be Muslims, thereby coupling Malay ethnic identity with Muslim religious identity. Apostasy from Islam, whether to irreligion or to another religion, is against the law; however, the conversion of others to Islam is permitted. In fact, according to some sources, the government actively promotes the conversion to Islam in the country. The law requires any non-Muslim who marries a Muslim to first convert to Islam, any such marriages contracted in violation of the law are &quot;ipso facto&quot; void. Should a parent adopt Islam, their children are automatically declared Muslims without the consent of either parent.

===Destruction of religious sites===

Several Buddhist temples have been demolished by the government under the pretext of having been built on public land. The land in question is then sold to developers for purposes of gentrification.
In 2014, some ruins of candi (tomb temple) in Bujang Valley were destroyed by an urban developer, causing an international outcry against attacks on cultural heritage.

<doc id="1203086" wikidata="Q5299267" url="?curid=1203086" title="DoshTracker">
<text>DoshTracker was a currency bill tracking website that allows pound sterling banknotes to be tracked around the United Kingdom and abroad. Originally launched in 2001, it was relaunched in 2012.

&quot;&quot; is a British slang term for money.

==History==
The concept of the website is based on Where&#x27;s George?, which follows American currency, and in the same way allows users to enter the serial number on notes that they own and see where it has been.

This site originally operated between 2001 and 2006 but was taken down due to lack of free time on the site owner Richard Dutton&#x27;s behalf, tracking its last note on 18 May 2006.

The site was relaunched on 1 January 2012, but has been inactive since 2018.

==Controversy==
The site discourages marking the notes with any sort of identification such as a URL, as defacing of bank notes is technically illegal.

==Press Coverage==
Shortly after the site&#x27;s launch in 2001, its reputation quickly spread and it gained a relatively large amount of media coverage and reviews from both internet, radio and written media, they included;

*26 July 2001 - St Petersburg Times

<doc id="1203089" wikidata="Q1256654" url="?curid=1203089" title="Torsional vibration">
<text>Torsional vibration is the angular vibration of an object - commonly a shaft - along its axis of rotation. Torsional vibration is often a concern in power transmission systems using rotating shafts or couplings, where it can cause failures if not controlled. A second effect of torsional vibrations applies to passenger cars. Torsional vibrations can lead to seat vibrations or noise at certain speeds. Both reduce the comfort.

In ideal power generation (or transmission) systems using rotating parts, the torques applied or reacted are &quot;smooth&quot; leading to constant speeds, and the rotating plane where the power is generated (input) and the plane it is taken out (output) are the same. In reality this is not the case. The torques generated may not be smooth (e.g., internal combustion engines) or the component being driven may not react to the torque smoothly (e.g., reciprocating compressors), and the power generating plane is normally at some distance to the power takeoff plane. Also, the components transmitting the torque can generate non-smooth or alternating torques (e.g., elastic drive belts, worn gears, misaligned shafts). Because no material can be infinitely stiff, these alternating torques applied at some distance on a shaft cause twisting vibration about the axis of rotation.

== Sources of torsional vibration ==
Torsional vibration can be introduced into a drive train by the power source. But even a drive train with a very smooth rotational input can develop torsional vibrations through internal components. Common sources are:
* Internal combustion engine: The torsional vibrations of the not continuous combustion and the crank shaft geometry itself cause torsional vibrations 
* Reciprocating compressor: The pistons experience discontinuous forces from the compression.
* Universal joint: The geometry of this joint causes torsional vibrations if the shafts are not parallel.
* Stick slip: During the engagement of a friction element, stick slip situations create torsional vibrations.
* Lash: Drive train lash can cause torsional vibrations if the direction of rotation is changed or if the flow of power, i.e. driver vs. driven, is reversed.

==Crankshaft torsional vibration==

Torsional vibration is a concern in the crankshafts of internal combustion engines because it could break the crankshaft itself; shear-off the flywheel; or cause driven belts, gears and attached components to fail, especially when the frequency of the vibration matches the torsional resonant frequency of the crankshaft. Causes of the torsional vibration are attributed to several factors.

*Alternating torques are generated by the slider-crank mechanism of the crankshaft, connecting rod, and piston.
** The cylinder pressure due to combustion is not constant through the combustion cycle.
** The slider-crank mechanism does not output a smooth torque even if the pressure is constant (e.g., at top dead centre there is no torque generated)
** The motion of the piston mass and connecting rod mass generate alternating torques often referred to as &quot;inertia&quot; torques
* Engines with six or more cylinders in a straight line configuration can have very flexible crankshafts due to their long length.
* 2 Stroke Engines generally have smaller bearing overlap between the main and the pin bearings due to the larger stroke length, hence increasing the flexibility of the Crankshaft due to decreased stiffness.
* There is inherently little damping in a crankshaft to reduce the vibration except for the shearing resistance of oil film in the main and conrod bearings.

If torsional vibration is not controlled in a crankshaft it can cause failure of the crankshaft or any accessories that are being driven by the crankshaft (typically at the front of the engine; the inertia of the flywheel normally reduces the motion at the rear of the engine). The couplings turn the vibration energy into heat. Therefore, and to ensure that the coupling is not damaged due to this (temperature could be very high, depending on the load), this is verified through torsional vibration calculation.

This potentially damaging vibration is often controlled by a torsional damper that is located at the front nose of the crankshaft (in automobiles it is often integrated into the front pulley). There are two main types of torsional dampers.
*Viscous dampers consist of an inertia ring in a viscous fluid. The torsional vibration of the crankshaft forces the fluid through narrow passages that dissipates the vibration as heat. The viscous torsional damper is analogous to the hydraulic shock absorber in a car&#x27;s suspension.
* Tuned absorber type of &quot;dampers&quot; often referred to as a harmonic dampers or harmonic balancers (even though it technically does not damp or balance the crankshaft). This damper uses a spring element (often rubber in automobile engines) and an inertia ring that is typically tuned to the first torsional natural frequency of the crankshaft. This type of damper reduces the vibration at specific engine speeds when an excitation torque excites the first natural frequency of the crankshaft, but not at other speeds. This type of damper is analogous to the tuned mass dampers used in skyscrapers to reduce the building motion during an earthquake.

== Torsional vibrations in electromechanical drive systems ==

Torsional vibrations of drive systems usually result in a fluctuation of the rotational speed of the rotor of the driving electric motor. Such oscillations of the angular speed superimposed on the average rotor rotational speed cause perturbations of the electromagnetic flux, leading to additional oscillations of the electric currents in the motor windings. Then, the generated electromagnetic torque is also influenced by additional time-varying electromechanical interactions, which lead to further torsional vibrations of the drive system. According to the above, mechanical vibrations/oscillations of the drive system become coupled with the electrical oscillations of the motor windings&#x27; currents. Such coupling is typically nonlinear and presents a high computational burden. 

Due to the highly nonlinear and coupled nature of electromechanical oscillations, approximations are often used, enabling such oscillations to be characterized analytically. To simplify the characterization of the oscillations between mechanical and electric systems, it is common to assume the mechanical and electrical components are uncoupled. Then, by holding either the mechanical or electrical aspect in steady-state, the characteristic of the other can be calculated. A common method is to apply electromagnetic torques generated by the electric motors as assumed excitation functions of time or of the rotor-to-stator slip, which are usually based on numerous experimental measurements carried out for a given electric motor&#x27;s dynamic behaviour. For this purpose, by means of measurement results, i.e., empirically, formulas have been developed that provide good approximations for the electromagnetic external excitations produced by the electric motor. Although the electric currents flowing in the electric motor windings are accurate, the mechanical drive system is typically reduced to one or seldom to at most a few rotating rigid bodies. In many cases, such simplifications yield sufficiently useful results for engineering applications, but they can lead to inaccuracies since many qualitative dynamic properties of the mechanical systems, e.g., their mass distribution, torsional flexibility, and damping effects, are neglected. Thus, an influence of the oscillatory behaviour of drive systems on the electric machine rotor angular speed fluctuations, and in this way on the electric current oscillations in the rotor and stator windings, cannot be investigated with a satisfactory precision, excepting numerical methods, which can provide arbitrarily high accuracy.

Mechanical vibrations and deformations are phenomena associated with the operation of the majority of railway vehicle drivetrain structures. The knowledge about torsional vibrations in transmission systems of railway vehicles is of a great importance in the field of mechanical system dynamics. Torsional vibrations in railway vehicle drivetrains are generated by many coupled mechanisms, which are very complex and can be divided into two main parts: 
#The electromechanical interactions within the railway drivetrain system, including the electric motor, gears, and the driven parts of the disc and gear clutches. 
#Torsional vibrations of the flexible wheels and wheelsets caused by variations of the adhesion forces in the wheel-rail contact zone. 
An interaction of the adhesion forces has nonlinear features which are related to the creep value and strongly depend on the wheel-rail zone conditions and the track geometry (especially when driving on a curve section of the track). In many modern mechanical systems, torsional structural deformability plays an important role. Often the study of railway vehicle dynamics using the rigid multibody methods without torsionally deformable elements are used This approach does not enable analysis of the self-excited vibrations, which have an important influence on the wheel-rail longitudinal interaction.
A dynamic modelling of the electrical drive systems coupled with elements of a driven machine or vehicle is particularly important when the purpose of such modelling is to obtain an information about the transient phenomena of system operation, like run-up, run-down, and the loss of adhesion in the wheel-rail zone. The modelling of an electromechanical interaction between the electric driving motor and the machine also influence the self-excited torsional vibrations in the drive system.

==Measuring torsional vibration on physical systems==

The most common way to measure torsional vibration is the approach of using equidistant pulses over one shaft revolution. Dedicated shaft encoders as well as gear tooth pickup transducers (induction, hall-effect, variable reluctance, etc.) can generate these pulses. The resulting encoder pulse train is converted into either a digital rpm reading or a voltage proportional to the rpm.

The use of a dual-beam laser is another technique that is used to measure torsional vibrations. The operation of the dual-beam laser is based on the difference in reflection frequency of two perfectly aligned beams pointing at different points on a shaft. Despite its specific advantages, this method yields a limited frequency range, requires line-of-sight from the part to the laser, and represents multiple lasers in case several measurement points need to be measured in parallel.

==Torsional vibration software==

There are many software packages that are capable of solving the torsional vibration system of equations. Torsional vibration specific codes are more versatile for design and system validation purposes and can produce simulation data that can readily compared to published industry standards. These codes make it easy to add system branches, mass-elastic data, steady-state loads, transient disturbances and many other items only a rotordynamicist would need. Torsional vibration specific codes:

* AxSTREAM RotorDynamics - Commercial FEA-based program for performing the full scope of torsional analyses on the complete range of rotating equipment. Can be used to perform steady-state and transient, modal, harmonic and reciprocating machines analysis, and generates stability plot and Campbell diagrams quickly.
* ARMD TORSION - Commercial FEA-based software for performing damped and undamped torsional natural frequencies, mode shapes, steady-state and time-transient response of mechanical drive trains with inputs of various types of external excitation, synchronous motor start-up torque, compressor torques, and electrical system disturbances.

Bond Graphs can be used to analyse torsional vibrations in generator sets, such as those used aboard ships.

<doc id="1203090" wikidata="Q2892939" url="?curid=1203090" title="Barry Wellman">
<text>Barry Wellman (30 September 1942 – 9 July 2024) was an American-Canadian sociologist and was the co-director of the Toronto-based international NetLab Network. His areas of research were community sociology, the Internet, human-computer interaction and social structure, as manifested in social networks in communities and organizations. His overarching interest was in the paradigm shift from group-centered relations to &quot;networked individualism&quot;. He has written or co-authored more than 300 articles, chapters, reports and books. Wellman was a professor at the Department of Sociology, University of Toronto for 46 years, from 1967 to 2013, including a five-year stint as S.D. Clark Professor.

Among the concepts Wellman has published are: &quot;network of networks&quot; and &quot;the network city&quot; (both with Paul Craven), &quot;the community question&quot;, &quot;computer networks as social networks&quot;, &quot;connected lives&quot; and the &quot;immanent Internet&quot; (both with Bernie Hogan), &quot;media-multiplexity&quot; (with Caroline Haythornthwaite), &quot;networked individualism&quot; and &quot;networked society&quot;, &quot;personal community&quot; and &quot;personal network&quot; and three with Anabel Quan-Haase: &quot;hyperconnectivity&quot;, &quot;local virtuality&quot; and &quot;virtual locality&quot;.

Lee Rainie and Barry Wellman were co-authors of the 2012 prize-winning &quot;&quot; (MIT Press). Wellman is also the editor of three books, and the author of more than 500 articles, often written with students.

Wellman received career achievement awards from the Canadian Sociology and Anthropology Association, the International Network for Social Network Analysis, the International Communication Association, the GRAND Network of Centres of Excellence, and two sections of the American Sociological Association: Community and Urban Sociology; Communication and Information Technologies. He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (FRSC) in 2007. In 2012, Wellman was identified as having the highest h-index (of citations) of all Canadian sociologists. Wellman was a faculty member at the Department of Sociology at the University of Toronto for 46 years, from 1967 to 2013. Since July 2013, he co-directed the NetLab Network. Wellman was honoured with the Lim Chong Yah Visiting Professorship of Communications and New Media at the National University of Singapore in January–February 2015.

Wellman died after a long illness on 9 July 2024, at the age of 81.

==Early life==
Barry Wellman was born and raised in the Grand Concourse and Fordham Road area of the Bronx, New York City. He attended P.S. 33 and Creston J.H.S. 79, and was a teenage member of the Fordham Flames. He gained his high school degree from the Bronx High School of Science in 1959. He received his A.B. (Bachelor&#x27;s) degree &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Lafayette College in 1963, majoring in social history and winning prizes in both history and religious studies. At Lafayette, he was a member of the McKelvy Honors House and captained the undefeated 1962 College Bowl team, whose final victory was over Berkeley.

His graduate work was at Harvard University, where he trained with Chad Gordon, Charles Tilly and Harrison White, and also studied with Roger Brown, Cora DuBois, George Homans, Alex Inkeles, Florence Kluckhohn, Talcott Parsons and Phillip J. Stone. He received a M.A. in Social Relations in 1965 and a Ph.D. in Sociology in 1969. His focus was on community, computer applications, social networks and self-conception, and his dissertation showed that the social identities of African-American and White American Pittsburgh junior high school students were related to the extent of segregation of their schools.

He was married since 1965 to Beverly Wellman, a researcher in complementary and alternative medicine.

==Career==
===Community sociology===
Until 1990, he focused on community sociology and social network analysis. During his first three years in Toronto, he also held a joint appointment with the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry where he working with D.B. Coates, M.D., co-directing the &quot;Yorklea Study&quot; in the Toronto borough of East York. This first East York study, with data collected in 1968, did a field study of a large population, linking interpersonal relations with psychiatric symptoms. This early study of &quot;social support&quot; documented the prevalence of non-local friendship and kinship ties, demonstrating that community is no longer confined to neighborhood and studying non-local communities as social networks. Wellman&#x27;s &quot;The Community Question&quot; paper, reporting on this study, has been selected as one of the seven most important articles in English-Canadian sociology.

A second East York study, conducted in 1978 and 1979 at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Centre for Urban and Community Studies, used in-depth interviews with 33 East Yorkers (originally surveyed in the first study) to learn more information about their social networks. It provided evidence about which kinds of ties and networks supply which types of social support. It showed, for example, that sisters provide siblings with much emotional support, while parents provide financial aid. The support comes more from the characteristics of the ties than from the networks in which they are embedded. This research also demonstrated that wives maintain social networks for their husbands as well as for themselves.

Although Wellman&#x27;s work has shifted primarily to studies of the Internet (see section below), he has continued collaborative analyses of the first and second East York studies, showing that reciprocity (like social support) is much more of a tie phenomenon than a social network phenomenon and that the frequency and supportiveness of interpersonal contact before the Internet was non-linearly associated with residential (and workplace) distance.

Wellman has edited &quot;Networks in the Global Village&quot; (1999), a book of original articles about personal networks around the world. In 2007, he edited a special issue, &quot;The Network is Personal&quot; of the journal, &quot;Social Networks&quot; (vol. 29, no. 3, July), containing analyses from Canada, France, Germany and Iran.

===Social network theory===
Concomitant with his empirical work, Wellman contributed to the theory of social network analysis. The most comprehensive statement is in his introductory article to &quot;Social Structures&quot;, co-edited with the late S.D. Berkowitz. This work reviews the history of social network thought, and suggests a number of basic principles of social network analysis.

More recent and more focused theoretical work has discussed the &quot;glocalization&quot; of contemporary communities (simultaneously &quot;global&quot; and &quot;local&quot;) and the rise of &quot;networked individualism&quot; – the transformation from group-based networks to individualized networks. American Sociological Association career achievement award winner Harrison White notes: &quot;Barry Wellman stands out as having devoted an entire career to exploring and documenting natural social worlds in network terms.&quot;

===Social network methods===
Wellman&#x27;s methodological contributions have been for the analysis of ego-centered or &quot;personal&quot; networks – defined from the standpoint of an individual (usually a person). As batches of personal networks are often studied, this calls for somewhat different techniques than the more common social network practice of analyzing a single large network.

A 2007 paper, co-authored by Wellman (with Bernie Hogan and Juan-Antonio Carrasco), has discussed alternatives in gathering personal network data. A paper with Kenneth Frank showed how to tackle the problem of simultaneously analyzing personal network data on the two distinct levels of ties and networks. &quot;Neighboring in Netville&quot; has been cited as the only published study of personal networks from a known roster of potential network members.

===Internet, technology and society===
Wellman often worked in collaboration with computer scientists, communication scientists and information scientists.
In 1990, he became involved in studying how ordinary people use the Internet and other communication technologies to communicate and exchange information at work, at home and in the community. Thus his work has expanded his interest in non-local communities and social networks to encompass the Internet, mobile phones and other information and communication technologies.

====Work networks and ICTs====
Wellman&#x27;s initial project (&quot;Cavecat&quot; which morphed into &quot;Telepresence&quot;) was in collaboration with Ronald Baecker, Caroline Haythornthwaite, Marilyn Mantei, Gale Moore, and Janet Salaff. This effort in the early 1990s was done before the widespread popularity of the Internet, to use networked PCs for videoconferencing and computer supported collaborative work (CSCW).
Caroline Haythornthwaite (for her dissertation and other works) and Wellman analyzed why computer scientists connect with each other – online and offline. They discovered that friendships as well as collaborative work were prime movers of connectivity at work.

Wellman and Anabel Quan-Haase also studied whether such computer-supported work teams were supporting networked organizations, in which bureaucratic structure and physical proximity did not matter. Their research in one high-tech American organization – heavily dependent on instant messaging and e-mail – showed that the supposed ICT-driven transformation of work to networked organizations was only partially fulfilled in practice. The organizational constraints of departmental organization (including power) and physical proximity continued to play important roles. There were strong norms in the organization for when different communication media were used, with face-to-face contact intertwined with online contact.

====Community networks and ICTs====
As a community sociologist, Wellman began arguing that too much analysis of life online was happening in isolation from other aspects of everyday life. He published several papers (alone and with associates) arguing the need to contextualize Internet research, and proposing that online relations – like off-line – would be best studied as ramified social networks rather than as bounded groups. This argument culminated in a 2002 book, &quot;The Internet in Everyday Life&quot; (co-edited with Caroline Haythornthwaite), providing exemplification from studies in a number of social milieus.

Wellman did empirical work in this area: he was part of a team (led by James Witte) that surveyed visitors to the National Geographic Society&#x27;s website in 1998 and used these data to counter the dystopian argument that Internet involvement was associated with social isolation.

The large U.S. national random-sample survey analyzed in the Pew Internet report, &quot;The Strength of Internet Ties&quot; (with Jeffrey Boase, John B. Horrigan and Lee Rainie) also showed a positive association between communication online and communication by telephone and face-to-face. The study showed that email is well-suited for maintaining regular contact with large networks, and especially with relationships that are only somewhat strong. The study also found that Internet users get more help than non-users from friends and relatives.

Research into the &quot;glocalization&quot; concept also fed into this intellectual stream. Keith Hampton and Wellman studied the Toronto suburb of &quot;Netville&quot;, a pseudonym. It showed the interplay between online and offline activity, and how the Internet – aided by a list-serve – is not just a means of long-distance communication but enhances neighboring and civic involvement.

He collaborated with Helen Hua Wang and Jeffrey Cole of the World Internet Project&#x27;s Center for the Digital Future to investigate the first national U.S. survey of social relationships and Internet use. Their work shows that the number of friends are growing, and that heavy Internet users have more friends than others. Wellman also collaborated with Ben Veenhof (Statistics Canada), Carsten Quell (Department of Canadian Heritage) and Bernie Hogan to relate time spent at home on the Internet to social relations and civic involvement. A different focus is his collaboration on Wenhong Chen&#x27;s study of transnational immigrant entrepreneurs who link China and North America.

Wellman&#x27;s work continued to focus on the interplay between information and communication technologies, especially the Internet, social relations and social structure. He directed the &quot;Connected Lives&quot; study of the interplay between communication, community and domestic relationships in Toronto and in Chapleau in rural northern Ontario. Early findings of the interplay between online and offline life are summarized in &quot;Connected Lives: The Project&quot;. More focused research (with Jennifer Kayahara) has shown how the onetime two-step flow of communication has become more recursively multi-step as the result of the Internet&#x27;s facilitation of information seeking and communication. Research (with Tracy Kennedy) has argued that many households, like communities, have changed from local groups to become spatially dispersed networks connected by frequent ICT and mobile phone communication. Other NetLab researchers, besides those noted in the text and the notes have included Julie Amoroso, Christian Beermann, Dean Behrens, Vincent Chua, Jessica Collins, Dimitrina Dimitrova, Zack Hayat, Chang Lin, Julia Madej, Maria Majerski, Mo Guang Ying, Diana Mok, Bárbara Barbosa Neves, and Lilia Smale.

Wellman was involved in the &quot;Networked Individuals&quot; project, using the fourth East York study to investigate their social networks and digital media use. His collaborators include Brent Berry, Molly-Gloria Harper, Maria Kiceveski, Guang Ying Mo, Anabel Quan-Haase, Helen Hua Wang, and Alice Renwen Zhang. The initial papers focused on older adults, aged 65+. showing how they used digital media to stay connected with relatives and friends both near and far. Most recently, he with Anabel Quan-Haase and Molly-Gloria Harper have distinguished a typology of networked individualism as either Networked, Bounded, or Limited.

<text>Nadvorna is a Hasidic rabbinical dynasty deriving its name from the town of Nadvorna, (Nadvirna), today in Ukraine.

The most famous rebbe of the dynasty was Mordechai Leifer of Nadvorna (the son of Rabbi Yissachar Dov Ber (Bertche) Leifer of Nadvorna), whose writings form the corpus of the group&#x27;s Hasidic thought. He was raised by his great-uncle, Rebbe Meir II of Premishlan.

Yissachar Dov Ber (Bertche) Leifer of Nadvorna was a son of Rabbi Yitzchak of Kalish. Since many of the rebbes of the Nadvorna Dynasty (as in other rabbinic dynasties) married relatives, many of the rebbes in this list are sons-in-law of other rebbes on the list.

There are Nadvorna congregations in Israel, Brooklyn, London, and Bloomingburg, among others.

The mode of dress of Nadvorna rebbes is unique in that they typically wear a white gartel over a colorful bekishe, and a white crocheted Jerusalem-style kippah under their shtreimel.

Rebbes are known as &quot;Admorim&quot; (Hebrew אדמו&quot;ר, which is the acronym for &quot;אדוננו מורינו ורבינו&quot;, &quot;Adoneinu Moreinu V&#x27;Rabeinu&quot;, &quot;Our master, our teacher, and our rabbi&quot;).

<doc id="1203096" wikidata="Q8006433" url="?curid=1203096" title="William Cabell (American Revolution)">
<text>William Cabell (March 13, 1730 – March 23, 1798) was an American planter, soldier, and politician who served more than four decades in both houses of the Virginia General Assembly representing the area of his and family members&#x27; plantations on the upper James River.

==Early life, family and education==
Cabell was born on March 13, 1730, near Licking Hole Creek in what was then vast Goochland County, Virginia. The firstborn son of physician, planter and surveyor William Cabell (1699–1774), who had emigrated from Warminister, England, and his wife the former Elizabeth Burks (1705–1756), he would have younger brothers Joseph Cabell (1730-1798), John Cabell (1735-1815) and Nicholas Cabell (1750-1803), and a sister Mary. All the Cabell brothers (and Mary&#x27;s husband John Horsley) became patriots in the American Revolutionary War shortly after their father&#x27;s death, and married well (thus making their family one of the First Families of Virginia), as they operated plantations using enslaved labor, and served in the Virginia General Assembly and local governments.

Cabell&#x27;s father returned to England for several years to settle his father&#x27;s estate, during which time he often wrote his wife about the boy&#x27;s education. Elizabeth Burks Cabell ran her family&#x27;s estates and greatly increased them during this time (including by buying slaves). According to family tradition, after receiving a private education suitable to his class from his parents and tutors at home, this William Cabell studied at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg. At some point the college acknowledged his qualifications as surveyor, so by 1749, he was assisting in his father&#x27;s surveying business. His public career would begin in 1751 as he joined his father as a vestryman of St. Anne&#x27;s Parish in Albemarle County, Virginia. Two years later he received an official appointment as surveyor in his own right. As settlement proceeded westward through Virginia&#x27;s Piedmont, the Virginia General Assembly created Albemarle County from the western section of Goochland County in 1744, and would create Buckingham County from the southern part of Albemarle County and Amherst County from the western section in 1761. Joseph and John Cabell would represent Buckingham County for many terms and Nicholas Cabell (who inherited his father&#x27;s last plantation, called &quot;Liberty Hall&quot;) would represent Amherst County during many legislative sessions (although &quot;Liberty Hall&#x27;s address would become Nelson County when it was created from Amherst County).

This William Cabell married Margaret Jordan, daughter of future one-term Buckingham County Burgess Col. Samuel Jordan in 1756. Seven children survived their father. Their firstborn, Samuel Jordan Cabell, was born the year of their marriage and would like his father become a planter and politician, serving in the U.S. Congress as well as Virginia House of Delegates. His slightly younger brother Margaret Cabell bore William Cabell, Jr. (1759–1822), who also served in the Continental Army, married the daughter of Virginia judge Paul Carrington and succeeded his father at &quot;Union Hill,&quot; most of which became part of Nelson County during that county&#x27;s creation from parts of both Albemarle and Amherst counties in 1808. Their two other sons were Landon Cabell (1765–1834) and Hector Cabell (1768–1807), with Hector&#x27;s widow marrying judge William Daniel and helping raise future justice William Daniel. Their three daughters all married well. Margaret married prominent Nelson County planter and merchant Robert Rives; their son William Cabell Rives would have a distinguished legal and diplomatic career. Paulina (1763–1845) married Maj. Edmund Read and after his death c. 1808 Rev. Nash LeGrand. Their youngest daughter Elizabeth (1774–1801) married her cousin William H. Cabell (1772–1853; Nicholas&#x27; son), who became governor of Virginia and, after her death, president of what later became the Virginia Supreme Court.

==Colonial planter, politician and military officer==
In 1756, William Cabell won his first election and the following spring began what became a more than four decade long political career as a delegate in the House of Burgesses, representing first Albemarle County, then Amherst County following its creation by the legislature in 1761. Amherst County voters re-elected him as their (part-time) representative to successive assemblies until Lord Dunmore suppressed that legislative body just before the American Revolutionary War. In 1764, Cabell was one of the first subscribers to the James River Canal Company (although it would not be formally incorporated by the legislature until January 5, 1785), and in 1772 began the first of several terms as treasurer of Amherst County.

Cabell joined the Albemarle County militia in 1756 and two years later (with his father-in-law Samuel Jordan and John Nicholas) became a commissioner for inspecting the damage from the native American raids the previous year, as well as bills for provisions and militia service during the French and Indian War. Governor Francis Fauquier appointing Cabell militia Colonel for Albemarle County on October 11, 1760, and in the following two years the may have been granted 460 acres and 1243 acres in Brunswick County for that service.

Between February 16, 1761, and May 2, 1763, Dr. Cabell began dividing his land (some received via royal letters patent in 1738) among his sons. He gave William Cabell 1,785 acres of his inheritance early (although he had been living on the acreage bounded by the Fluvanna River since 1752), and began establishing what would become his first and core plantation, &quot;Union Hill&quot;. A decade earlier, in 1753, William Cabell had received his first land patent (claim) for 2700 acres on the east side of Tobacco Row Mountain, for which he paid the colony&#x27;s government 12 pounds and 15 shillings in cash. In 1760, this William Cabell patented land on both sides of Findlay Creek adjoining the acreage he received from his father, and in 1764 he added another 579 acres -- and would build a house and continue to add to the plantation for years.

Meanwhile, William Cabell also received appointments as the first presiding magistrate of Amherst County, first County lieutenant (chief military officer), first county surveyor (the most important office in a new frontier county), and as its first coroner, all of which legislative, executive and judicial offices he continued to hold until 1775. Thus, while he held all the county offices until 1775, the family historian speculates that many functions were performed by clerks or others under his supervision.

==Patriot==
During the American Revolutionary War, William Cabell attended four of the five Virginia Conventions (his brother John Cabell, the sheriff of Buckingham County attended the fifth). His younger brother Nicholas Cabell led troops (including this William Cabell&#x27;s sons William Jr. and Samuel Jordan) as well as served in the legislature, until assigned duties in southwestern Virginia, whereupon Samuel J. Cabell led the military company. Meanwhile, this William Cabell served on the Amherst County Committee of Safety during the revolutionary struggle, and would be the only Piedmont-area representative on the state Committee of Safety. As the presiding justice for Amherst County beginning in 1777, he in effect continued as the area&#x27;s chief executive officer, in addition to performing judicial duties.

Following the creation of the Commonwealth of Virginia after defeating the British, voters in Albemarle, Amherst and Buckingham counties elected Cabell as their first state senator (and re-elected him in 1788 when Fluvanna County which had been created from part of Albemarle County in 1777 was added to the district).

In 1788 Amherst County voters overwhelmingly elected this William Cabell and his eldest son Samuel J. Cabell to represent them in the Virginia Ratification Convention (with 327 and 317 votes respectively, the next candidate receiving 23 votes), where both Cabells (like their ally Patrick Henry) voted against the proposed United States Constitution, although the convention as a whole ratified it. William Cabell then became a member of the Virginia legislative committee that drew up the Declaration of Rights of January 7, 1789. As one of his last political acts in his long career, William Cabell served as one of the presidential electors who voted for George Washington as the first President of the United States. He also served many terms as trustee of Hampden–Sydney College, where his sons studied.

==Death and legacy==
William Cabell Sr. died in 1798 and was buried at Union Hill Cemetery in Winginia, Nelson County. By the time of his death, he had distributed estates to various family members, who received an additional 30,000 acres in his will. His eldest son, Samuel J. Cabell, was by then representing the area in the U.S. Congress. Many Cabell family papers are held by the University of Virginia libraries, including this man&#x27;s journals and a 1996 monograph about newly discovered correspondence between his parents during his childhood. However, most of the Union Hill outbuildings were deteriorated by 1898, and much of the property left family hands in 1969 when sold to a Richmond development company. The Union Hill house was moved onto 1551 Carriage Lane in Goochland County circa 1980, although the Cabell Foundation continues to hold and maintain the historic Cabell family cemetery.

<text>The Maha Vir Chakra (MVC) () is the second highest military decoration in India, after the Param Vir Chakra, and is awarded for acts of conspicuous gallantry in the presence of the enemy, whether on land, at sea or in the air. It replaced the British Distinguished Service Order (DSO). The medal may be awarded posthumously.

==Appearance==
The medal is made of standard silver and is circular in shape. Embossed on the obverse is a five pointed heraldic star with circular center-piece bearing the gilded state emblem of India in the center.

The decoration is worn on the left chest with a half-white and half-orange riband about 3.2 cm in width, the orange being near the left shoulder.

==History==
More than 218 acts of bravery and selfless courage have been recognized since the inception of the medal. The most MVCs awarded in a single conflict was in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, when eleven were given to the Indian Air Force.

==Bar to MVC==

<text>William Garfield Greaves (October 8, 1926 – August 25, 2014) was an American documentary filmmaker and a pioneer of film-making. After trying his hand at acting, he became a filmmaker who produced more than two hundred documentary films, and wrote and directed more than half of these. Greaves garnered many accolades for his work, including four Emmy nominations.

==Early life==
Greaves was born in Harlem in New York City on October 8, 1926. He was one of seven children of taxi driver and minister Garfield Greaves and the former Emily Muir. After graduating from the elite Stuyvesant High School at the age of 18, Greaves attended City College of New York to study science and engineering, but eventually dropped out to pursue a career in theater. Starting as a dancer, he eventually moved into acting, working in the American Negro Theater.

==Career==

===Acting and film training===
In 1948, Greaves joined the Actors Studio and studied alongside the likes of Marlon Brando, Julie Harris, Anthony Quinn, Shelley Winters, and others. During this time, he undertook a number of roles on the stage and in the theatre, but eventually grew dissatisfied with the roles in which he was being cast. &quot;Miracle in Harlem&quot; (1948) was one of the films he appeared in during this period. He also appeared in &quot;Souls of Sin&quot; (1949), one of the last race films, which saw him sing and act. Realizing that most of the parts he could play were stereotypes and derivative due to racism prevalent throughout American culture at the time, Greaves looked into African-American history. Seeing that his opportunities would be limited were he to continue to stay in America and focus on his planned course of acting, Greaves tried his hand at movie making, electing to move to Canada and study at the National Film Board of Canada.

After six years working in various stages of production from director to editing, Greaves found himself behind the camera as director and editor of a film called &quot;Emergency Ward&quot;, which focused on the goings-on of a hospital emergency room on a Sunday evening.

===Freelance documentaries and television work===
As the 1960s saw the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, Greaves returned to The United States to participate in the ongoing discourse regarding African-Americans and their place in society. Based on his work on &quot;Emergency Ward&quot;, he was hired by both the United Nations and the film division of the United States Information Agency (USIA) to make several documentaries, the two most acclaimed of which were &quot;Wealth of a Nation&quot;, an examination of personal freedom as a key boon to America&#x27;s strength, and &quot;The First World Festival of Negro Arts&quot; (1968), which documented the 1966 World Festival of Black Arts, a celebration of both African and African-American culture.

In 1969, following soon after the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., public broadcasting syndicate National Educational Television (a direct predecessor to the modern-day PBS) began to air a show called &quot;Black Journal&quot; with a mission to present news by African Americans, for African Americans, and about African Americans. After a tumultuous opening during the first few tapings, the NET network promoted Greaves from co-host to executive producer of the show. Greaves ran the show until 1970 winning an Emmy award for himself and the show in 1969.

===After &quot;Black Journal&quot;===
In 1970, after working on &quot;Black Journal&quot; for three years, Greaves opted to leave television to focus on film making. In 1971 he released a film titled &quot;Ali, the Fighter&quot;, which focused on Muhammad Ali&#x27;s first attempt to regain his professional boxing heavyweight title. Greaves then went on to produce and make films for various commissions and government agencies, including NASA and The Civil Service Commission.

After this, Greaves produced numerous works, including &quot;From These Roots&quot;, &quot;Nationtime: Gary&quot;, &quot;Where Dreams Come True&quot;, &quot;Booker T.Washington: Life and Legacy&quot;, &quot;Frederick Douglass: An American Life&quot;, &quot;Black Power in America: Myth or Reality?&quot;, &quot;The Deep North&quot;, and &quot;Ida B. Wells: A Passion for Justice&quot;, which was narrated by Nobel Prize in Literature and Pulitzer Prize winning author Toni Morrison. Greaves&#x27; 1972 documentary &quot;Nationtime&quot; centered on the National Black Political Convention in Gary, Indiana, and was narrated by Sidney Poitier. An 80-minute restored version was released in 2020 with funding from Jane Fonda and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.

In 2001, Greaves released one of his most ambitious works &quot;Ralph Bunche: An American Odyssey&quot;. According to Greaves, between attempting to secure funds and researching countless old manuscripts, photos, and newsreel footage, the film took him ten years to make. The final product was edited down from an initial cut of seventeen hours to two hours for the PBS show American Odyssey. The final project, narrated by Sidney Poitier, sought to bring the name of Ralph Bunche back into the public lexicon as Greaves felt he was an important, yet forgotten, political figure, one important to African-American history and the Civil Rights Movement.

==&quot;Symbiopsychotaxiplasm&quot;==
While working on &quot;Black Journal&quot;, Greaves continued to produce films out of his own production company, William Greaves productions, which he had founded in 1964. One of the films he produced in this time period was a movie that blended his interest in the acting process with documentary film, which he called &quot;Symbiopsychotaxiplasm&quot;, an experimental, avant-garde film that he shot in the cinéma vérité documentary style in 1968.

The 1971 film takes place in Central Park in New York City and follows a documentary entitled &quot;Over the Cliff&quot;, one supposedly directed by Greaves himself and focusing on different pairs of actors who prepare to audition for a dramatic piece. Greaves employed three sets of camera crews to document this audition process. The first crew focuses on the actors in an effort to document the audition process. The second documents the first film crew. The third documents the actors, the remaining two crews, and any other passers-by or spectators who happen to fit into &quot;Over the Cliff&quot;&#x27;s overarching theme of &quot;sexuality.&quot;

As the film goes on, the various film crews start to grow irritated, as they come to perceive that Greaves is an incompetent and sexist director. Divided about whether or not this entire situation is a plot by Greaves, the crews find themselves divided against him, at one point even plotting a revolt against their director. All of their doubts, insecurities, and complaints are captured on film, and, when the project is complete, they turn all of their footage over to Greaves (including the incriminating evidence). Greaves, in turn, incorporates their footage into his final product.

Through all of this, Greaves creates a giant circular meta-documentary featuring a documentary, a documentary about a documentary, and a documentary documenting a documentary about a documentary, and all in an attempt to create and capture reality on film. To add to the coherence or incoherence of the piece, the film is also edited untraditionally, with the different cameras&#x27; various shots intercut in split screens so that all three sets of simultaneous footage display the same sequence but from three perspectives.

&quot;Symbiopsychotaxiplasm&quot; was unable to find mainstream distribution and instead toured various festivals and museum screenings, gaining something of a cult status amongst those filmmakers who had seen it. It eventually caught the eye of famous actor and filmmaker Steve Buscemi who saw it at a screening at the Sundance Film Festival in 1992. Ten years later, Buscemi and director Steven Soderbergh teamed up to secure widespread distribution for the film as well as financing for the making of one of the four sequels Greaves had considered once he had finished the initial product in the late 1960s.

&quot;Symbiopsychotaxiplasm&quot; was finally released theatrically under its new title &quot;Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take One&quot; alongside its sequel, &quot;Symbiopsychotaxiplasm: Take 2½&quot;, in 2003. The sequel focused on two of the actors from the original and picks up the narrative of the original film some thirty-five years later.

==Personal life==
On August 23, 1959, Greaves married Louise Archambault, who became a frequent collaborator on his projects, going so far as to even produce his documentary on Ralph Bunche. They had three children.

Between 1969 and 1982, Greaves taught film and television acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute in New York.

While not working, Greaves could be found touring various universities and cultural centers around the world presenting his films, conducting workshops, and speaking about his experiences in indie film and the process of creating film as it is to actors, directors, professionals, and more.

Greaves died at the age of 87 at his home in Manhattan on August 25, 2014.

==Awards and accolades==
Besides the Emmy he won for his work as executive producer of &quot;Black Journal&quot; in 1969, Greaves was nominated for an Emmy for his work &quot;Still a Brother: Inside the Negro Middle Class&quot;, which also won the Blue Ribbon Award at the American Film Festival. Beyond these, many of his films have played at festivals and garnered numerous awards, with certain films (including &quot;Ida B. Wells&quot;) winning upwards of twenty awards across the many venues where they have been played.

In 1980, Greaves was honored alongside Robert De Niro, Jane Fonda, Marlon Brando, Arthur Penn, Sally Field, Rod Steiger, Al Pacino, Shelley Winters, Dustin Hoffman, Estelle Parsons, and Ellen Burstyn with the Actors Studio in New York&#x27;s first ever Dusa Award. Also in the same year, he was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame and received a special homage at the first Black American Independent Film Festival in Paris. In 2008 the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival honored him with its Career Award.

&quot;Symbiopsychotaxiplasm&quot; was added to the National Film Registry in 2015.

In 2020, Firelight Media established a William Greaves Fund to support mid-career nonfiction filmmakers of color.

<text>Indian Springs State Park is a Georgia state park located near Jackson and Flovilla. The park is named for its several springs, which the Creek Indians used for centuries to heal the sick. The water from these springs is said to have a sulfur smell and taste. Indian Springs is thought to be the oldest state park in the nation. It was acquired from the Creek Indians by the state through the Treaty of Indian Springs (1825) and the Treaty of Washington (1826). Thereafter, Indian Springs has been operated continuously by the state as a public park, although it did not gain the title &quot;State Park&quot; until 1931. The area became a resort town in the 19th century. It became an official &quot;State Forest Park&quot; in 1927. In 1931, along with Vogel State Park, it became a founding unit of Georgia&#x27;s state park system.

Visitors are still allowed to sample the park&#x27;s spring water, all the while enjoying swimming, fishing, and boating. Several structures within the park were built during the Great Depression by members of the Civilian Conservation Corps. The park also contains a lake consistently stocked with fish, as well as a nature trail. A trail connects the park to Dauset Trails.

The park features a small museum that is open seasonally. Exhibits include the park&#x27;s natural history, the resort era, activities of the CCC, and the history and culture of the Creek Indians.

<text>Jentina Rose Rees (née Chapman, born 6 March 1984) is an English rapper, singer, songwriter and model of Romani descent.

==Biography==
Jentina Chapman was born on 6 March 1984 in Woking, England to a Romani family that consisted of fourteen children. When she was one year old, her family moved to West Molesey, Surrey. She got her first recording contract at the age of nineteen whilst working in a computer shop.

After an advertising campaign on television and features in various UK music magazines, (notably &quot;NME&quot;), her debut single &quot;Bad Ass Strippa&quot; was released in the summer of 2004. The song was later parodied by the grime MC Lady Sovereign. Sampling the O&#x27;Jays song &quot;For the Love of Money&quot;, it reached number 22 in the UK Singles Chart. Jentina&#x27;s second single, &quot;French Kisses&quot; was co-written by Jentina along with Cathy Dennis and Greg Wells and was a more electro-hop/R&amp;B-oriented song. The single was released in the autumn of 2004, entering the UK chart at number 20. Jentina released another single after this in Italy only, &quot;Mysterious&quot;. It reached the Top 30 in Italy. Her debut album &quot;Jentina&quot; was then released, again only in Italy.

In 2005, &quot;Bad Ass Strippa&quot;, &quot;French Kisses&quot; and &quot;Mysterious&quot; gained worldwide exposure after featuring in episodes of &quot;&quot;. In 2006, &quot;Mysterious&quot; underscored some of the audition stages of MTV&#x27;s &quot;DanceLife&quot;.

During 2005, Jentina dated the Prodigy member Keith Flint. She also has a son called Ralph and a daughter called Annie.

Jentina was also a professional model. In November 2007, she represented lingerie brand Wonderbra, following on from the likes of Eva Herzigová and Caprice. She featured in a spoof video of the Cadbury&#x27;s popular &quot;Gorilla&quot; television advertisement, in which a gorilla played the drums to the Phil Collins single, &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;.

During 2011, Jentina was in the judging panel for &quot;Travellers Got Talent&quot;, and she also appeared in the 8-part documentary &quot;A Gypsy Life for Me&quot; which aired on Bio in November 2011.

<text>The Albany Regency was a group of politicians who controlled the New York state government between 1822 and 1838. Originally called the &quot;Holy Alliance&quot;, it was instituted by Martin Van Buren, who remained its dominating spirit for many years. The group was among the first American political machines. In the beginning they were the leading figures of the Bucktails faction of the Democratic-Republican Party, later the Jacksonian Democrats and finally became the Hunkers faction of the Democratic Party.

==History==
The Albany Regency was a loosely organized group of politicians with similar views and goals who resided in or near Albany, New York, the state capital. They controlled the nominating conventions and patronage of their party within New York State, and by dictating its general policy, exerted a powerful influence in national as well as state politics. They derived their power largely from their personal influence and political sagacity, and were, for the most part, earnest opponents of political corruption, though they uniformly acted upon the principle, first formulated in 1833 by one of their number (Marcy), that &quot;to the victors belong the spoils.&quot;

The Regency developed party discipline and originated the control of party conventions through officeholders and others subservient to it. The spoils system they had created would dominate late-19th-century American politics, but in the beginning, observed the technical qualifications of the candidates for office they nominated. Thurlow Weed, who coined the name &quot;Albany Regency&quot;, wrote he &quot;had never known a body of men who possessed so much power and used it so well&quot;. However, this also may have been intended by Weed to be a disparaging remark.

The leading figure of the Albany Regency was Martin Van Buren. Upon Van Buren&#x27;s election to the United States Senate in 1821, several of his friends and aides, including Benjamin F. Butler, Samuel A. Talcott, Silas Wright, William L. Marcy, and Azariah C. Flagg, took over the day-to-day management of the political organization that had been developed under Van Buren. Roger Skinner, state printer Edwin Croswell, Benjamin Knower, John Adams Dix, and Charles E. Dudley also became members of the Regency. Their organ was the &quot;Argus&quot; newspaper of Albany, founded in 1813 by Jesse Buel (1778–1839) and edited from 1824 to 1854 by Edwin Croswell. The Regency was powerful enough during this era that it largely dictated policy to New York City&#x27;s Tammany Hall Democratic organization.

The Regency ended when Marcy was defeated in the election for Governor of New York by the opposing Whig&#x27;s candidate William H. Seward in 1838, which led to a radical change in state politics. Also cited as a factor is a bitter factional split in 1848 (see Barnburners) which gave the other party the patronage the Regency used to use against it. The Regency was reduced in a few years to unorganized individuals.

In 1845 Mackenzie published private letters between Jesse Hoyt and various members of the Albany Regency. These letters described negotiations between various members of the Regency for financial transactions and appointments to government office and exposed how members of the Regency were able to profit from speculatory notes and political corruption.

<doc id="1203137" wikidata="Q17006173" url="?curid=1203137" title="Carrier current">
<text>Carrier current transmission, originally called wired wireless, employs guided low-power radio-frequency signals, which are transmitted along electrical conductors. The transmissions are picked up by receivers that are either connected to the conductors, or a short distance from them. Carrier current transmission is used to send audio and telemetry to selected locations, and also for low-power broadcasting that covers a small geographical area, such as a college campus. The most common form of carrier current uses longwave or medium wave AM radio signals that are sent through existing electrical wiring, although other conductors can be used, such as telephone lines.

== Technology ==
Carrier current generally uses low-power transmissions. In cases where the signals are being carried over electrical wires, special preparations must be made for distant transmissions, as the signals cannot pass through standard utility transformers. Signals can bridge transformers if the utility company has installed high-pass filters, which typically has already been done when carrier current-based data systems are in operation. Signals can also be impressed onto the neutral leg of the three-phase electric power system, a practice known as &quot;neutral loading&quot;, in order to reduce or eliminate mains hum (60 hertz in North American installations), and to extend effective transmission line distance.

For a broadcasting installation, a typical carrier current transmitter has an output in the range 5 to 30 watts. However, electrical wiring is a very inefficient antenna, and this results in a transmitted effective radiated power of less than one watt, and the distance over which signals can be picked up is usually less than 60 meters (200 feet) from the wires. Transmission sound quality can be good, although it sometimes includes the low-frequency mains hum interference produced by the alternating current. However, not all listeners notice this hum, nor is it reproduced well by all receivers.

Extensive systems can include multiple unit installations with linear amplifiers and splitters to increase the coupling points to a large electrical grid (whether a campus, a high-rise apartment or a community). These systems would typically require coaxial cable interconnection from a transmitter to the linear amplifiers. In the 1990s, LPB, Inc., possibly the largest manufacturer of these transmission systems, designed and supplied several extensive campus-based systems that included fiber-optic links between linear amplifiers to prevent heterodyne interference.

==Initial development==
The ability for electrical conductors to act as waveguides for radio signals was noted in the earliest days of radio experimentation, and Heinrich Hertz published the first review of the phenomenon in 1889. By 1911, Major General George Owen Squier was conducting some of the earliest studies designed to put carrier current transmissions, which he called &quot;wired wireless&quot;, to practical use. To be effective, the radio transmitter must be capable of generating pure continuous-wave AM transmissions. Thus, the technology needed to set up carrier current transmissions would not be readily available until the late 1910s, with the development of vacuum tube transmitters and amplifiers.

==Long-distance communication==

The first commercial applications of carrier current technology included the setting up of long-distance telegraph, telemetry, and telephone communication by electrical companies over their high-voltage distribution lines. This approach had a major advantage over standard telegraph and telephone lines, because radio signals can readily jump over any small gaps in cases when there is a line break. In May 1918, the Imperial Japanese Electro-Technical Laboratory of Tokyo successfully tested &quot;wave telephony&quot; over the Kinogawa Hydro-Electric Company&#x27;s 144-kilometer (90-mile) long power line. In the summer of 1920, a successful test transmission over 19.2 kilometers (12 miles) of high-tension wires was reported from New Jersey, and by 1929, 1,000 installations had been made in the United States and Europe. The majority of power line communication installations use transmissions in the longwave band, to avoid interference to and from standard AM stations.

==Home entertainment services==

===United States===
In 1923, the Wired Radio Service Company, a subsidiary of the local electric company, set up a subscription news and entertainment service at Staten Island, New York that used carrier current transmissions over the electrical power lines. To receive the transmissions, subscribers had to lease a receiver costing between two and five dollars a month. However, despite the power company&#x27;s optimism that the system would eventually be installed nationally, the effort proved unable to compete with the free offerings provided by standard radio stations. General Squier continued to unsuccessfully promote the technology for home entertainment, until 1934, when he helped found the Muzak company, which focused on the business market.

===Europe===

Carrier current home entertainment services would prove to be more popular in Europe. Previously, there had been a few successful telephone newspaper services, which sent entertainment to subscribers over standard telephone lines. However, carrier current transmissions had the ability to provide programs over telephone lines without affecting the regular telephone service, and could also send multiple programs simultaneously.

In Germany, the carrier current service was called &quot;Drahtfunk&quot;, and in Switzerland &quot;Telefonrundspruch&quot;. In the Soviet Union, this approach was very common beginning in the 1930s because of its low cost and accessibility, and because it made reception of uncensored over-the-air transmissions more difficult. In Norway radiation from power lines was used, provided by the &quot;Linjesender&quot; facility. In Britain such systems were used for a time in areas where reception from conventional BBC radio transmitters was poor.

In these systems programs were fed by special transformers into the lines. To prevent uncontrolled propagation, filters for the service&#x27;s carrier frequencies were installed in substations and at line branches. Systems using telephone wires were incompatible with ISDN which required the same bandwidth to transmit digital data. Although the Swiss and German systems have been discontinued, the Italian &quot;:it:Filodiffusione&quot; still has several hundred thousand subscribers.

Programs formerly carried by &quot;wire broadcasting&quot; in Switzerland included:
* 175 kHz Swiss Radio International
* 208 kHz RSR1 &quot;la première&quot; (French)
* 241 kHz &quot;classical music&quot;
* 274 kHz RSI1 &quot;rete UNO&quot; (Italian)
* 307 kHz DRS 1 (German)
* 340 kHz &quot;easy music&quot;

==Low-power broadcasting stations==

Carrier current technology is also used for broadcasting radio programs that can be received over a small area by standard AM radios. This is most often associated with college radio and high school radio, but also has applications for hospital radio stations and at military bases, sports stadiums, convention halls, mental and penal institutions, trailer parks, summer camps, office buildings, and drive-in movie theaters. Transmitters that use carrier current are very simple, making them an effective option for students interested in radio.

Carrier current broadcasting began in 1936, when students at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island developed a carrier current station initially called &quot;The Brown Network&quot;. This station was founded by George Abraham and David W. Borst, who had originally installed an intercom system between their dormitory rooms. The intercom links were first expanded to additional locations, and then the system was replaced by distributed low-powered radio transmitters, which fed their signals into various buildings&#x27; electrical wires, allowing nearby radio receivers to receive the transmissions.

The carrier current station idea soon spread to other college campuses, especially in the northeastern United States. The Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS) was formed in February 1940, to coordinate activities between twelve college carrier current stations and to solicit advertisers interested in sponsoring programs geared toward their student audiences. The innovation received a major publicity boost by a complimentary article that appeared in the May 24, 1941 issue of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, and eventually hundreds of college stations were established. Responding to the growing phenomenon, a 1941 release issued by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) stated that because of the stations&#x27; very limited ranges, it had &quot;not promulgated any rule governing their operation.&quot; Therefore, to operate legally, U.S. carrier current station broadcast emissions must adhere to the FCC&#x27;s Title 47 CFR Part 15 Rules for unlicensed transmissions.

===Educational institution carrier current and cablecast stations===
Many college stations that went on to obtain FM broadcasting licenses started out as carrier current stations because of the low cost and relative ease of starting one. Although college-based carrier current stations have existed for over 80 years, their numbers are steadily declining, becoming supplemented, or replaced, by other transmission methods, including low-power FM (LPFM), closed circuit over cable TV channels, and Internet streaming audio and video, along with simple PowerPoint presentations of college campus news and information being streamed using low-cost consumer televisions and monitors. As with most other student-run facilities, these stations often operate on sporadic schedules.

In the United States, unlike educational FM stations, carrier current stations can carry a full range of advertising. Due to their low power, these stations do not require an FCC license, and are not assigned an official call sign. However, in keeping with standard radio industry practice, they commonly adopt their own call sign-like identifiers.

<text>The widemouth gambusia (Gambusia eurystoma) is a species of fish in the family Poeciliidae of the order Cyprinodontiformes. It is endemic to Mexico, specifically to the Baños del Azufre (Grijalva River basin) near Teapa, Tabasco. The Baños del Azufre are sulfidic springs that contain high concentrations of toxic hydrogen sulfide (). This prevents most animals from living in them; the only other fish found in the toxic sections of Baños del Azufre is the sulphur molly (&quot;Poecilia sulphuraria&quot;).

This species reaches a maximum overall length around .

Little is known about &quot;G. eurystoma&quot;, but the IUCN classifies it as Critically Endangered on the basis of a very small (less than 250 individuals) and rapidly falling population and a small, localized, and diminishing geographical distribution.

<doc id="1203150" wikidata="Q649739" url="?curid=1203150" title="Smith–Purcell effect">
<text>The Smith–Purcell effect was the precursor of the free-electron laser (FEL). It was studied by Steve Smith, a graduate student under the guidance of Edward Purcell. In their experiment, they sent an energetic beam of electrons very closely parallel to the surface of a ruled optical diffraction grating, and thereby generated visible light. Smith showed there was negligible effect on the trajectory of the inducing electrons. Essentially, this is a form of Cherenkov radiation where the phase velocity of the light has been altered by the periodic grating. However, unlike Cherenkov radiation, there is no minimum or threshold particle velocity.

Smith–Purcell radiation is particularly attractive for applications involving non-destructive beam diagnostics (bunch-length diagnostics in accelerators for example) and especially as a viable THz radiation source, which has further broad-range uses in diverse and high-impact fields like materials sciences, biotechnology, security and communications, manufacturing and medicine. Operating at THz frequencies also allows for potentially large accelerating gradients (~10s GeV/m) to be realised. This, paired with plasma-wakefield acceleration methods under development and linear accelerator (linac) technology, could pave the way to next-generation, compact (and hence cheaper), less prone to RF breakdown (current limits for surface E fields are of the order of 10s-100 MV/m), high energy output linacs.

== Background ==
Charged particles usually radiate/generate radiation via two different mechanisms:

# Acceleration or change of direction of motion: e.g. Bremsstrahlung radiation (e.g. in X-ray tubes), synchrotron radiation (as in FEL due to electron beams going through wiggler/ undulator set-ups, or a beam energy-loss mechanism in circular colliders).
# Polarisation: A moving charge has a dynamic Coulomb field. For a conducting/polarisable material, the interaction between this field and the charges in the material/ medium could generate radiation. This includes Cherenkov and transition radiation, where the particle moves within the medium which generates the radiation, but also diffraction radiation, where (usually relativistic) particles move in the vicinity of the target material, generating for example, optical diffraction radiation (ODR) and Smith–Purcell radiation (SPR).

The benefit of using polarisation radiation in particular is the lack of direct effect on the original beam; the beam inducing the radiative emission can continue its original path unaltered and having induced EM radiation. This is unlike the bremsstrahlung or synchrotron effects which actually alter or bend the incoming beam. Due to this non-destructive feature, SPR has become an interesting prospect for beam diagnostics, also offering the possibility of reliable technologies due to theoretically no contact or scattering interactions between the beam and the target.
=== Dispersion relation ===
When a charged particle travels above a periodic grating (or periodic media inhomogeneity), a current is induced on the surface of the grating. This induced current then emits radiation at the discontinuities of the grating due to the scattering of the Coulomb field of the induced charges at the grating boundaries. The dispersion relation for the Smith–Purcell effect (SPE) is given as follows:

:formula_1,

where the wavelength formula_2 is observed at an angle formula_3 to the direction of the electron beam for the formula_4 order reflection mode, and formula_5 is the grating period and formula_6 is the relative electron velocity (formula_7). This relation can be derived through considering energy and momentum conservation laws.

<doc id="1203155" wikidata="Q941094" url="?curid=1203155" title="Pedosphere">
<text>The pedosphere () is the outermost layer of the Earth that is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes. It exists at the interface of the lithosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere. The pedosphere is the skin of the Earth and only develops when there is a dynamic interaction between the atmosphere (air in and above the soil), biosphere (living organisms), lithosphere (unconsolidated regolith and consolidated bedrock) and the hydrosphere (water in, on and below the soil). The pedosphere is the foundation of terrestrial life on Earth.

The pedosphere acts as the mediator of chemical and biogeochemical flux into and out of these respective systems and is made up of gaseous, mineralic, fluid and biologic components. The pedosphere lies within the Critical Zone, a broader interface that includes vegetation, pedosphere, aquifer systems, regolith and finally ends at some depth in the bedrock where the biosphere and hydrosphere cease to make significant changes to the chemistry at depth. As part of the larger global system, any particular environment in which soil forms is influenced solely by its geographic position on the globe as climatic, geologic, biologic and anthropogenic changes occur with changes in longitude and latitude.

The pedosphere lies below the vegetative cover of the biosphere and above the hydrosphere and lithosphere. The soil forming process (pedogenesis) can begin without the aid of biology but is significantly quickened in the presence of biologic reactions, where it forms a soil carbon sponge. Soil formation begins with the chemical and/or physical breakdown of minerals to form the initial material that overlies the bedrock substrate. Biology quickens this by secreting acidic compounds that help break rock apart. Particular biologic pioneers are lichen, mosses and seed bearing plants, but many other inorganic reactions take place that diversify the chemical makeup of the early soil layer. Once weathering and decomposition products accumulate, a coherent soil body allows the migration of fluids both vertically and laterally through the soil profile, causing ion exchange between solid, fluid and gaseous phases. As time progresses, the bulk geochemistry of the soil layer will deviate away from the initial composition of the bedrock and will evolve to a chemistry that reflects the type of reactions that take place in the soil.

==Lithosphere==

The primary conditions for soil development are controlled by the chemical composition of the rock on which the soil will be. Rock types that form the base of the soil profile are often either sedimentary (carbonate or siliceous), igneous or metaigneous (metamorphosed igneous rocks) or volcanic and metavolcanic rocks. The rock type and the processes that lead to its exposure at the surface are controlled by the regional geologic setting of the specific area under study, which revolve around the underlying theory of plate tectonics, subsequent deformation, uplift, subsidence and deposition.

Metaigneous and metavolcanic rocks form the largest component of cratons and are high in silica. Igneous and volcanic rocks are also high in silica, but with non-metamorphosed rock, weathering becomes faster and the mobilization of ions is more widespread. Rocks high in silica produce silicic acid as a weathering product. There are few rock types that lead to localized enrichment of some of the biologically limiting elements like phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N). Phosphatic shale (&lt; 15% P2O5) and phosphorite (&gt; 15% P2O5) form in anoxic deep water basins that preserve organic material. Greenstone (metabasalt), phyllite, and schist release up to 30–50% of the nitrogen pool. Thick successions of carbonate rocks are often deposited on craton margins during sea level rise. The widespread dissolution of carbonate and evaporites leads to elevated levels of Mg2+, , Sr2+, Na+, Cl− and ions in aqueous solution.

==Weathering and dissolution of minerals==
The process of soil formation is dominated by chemical weathering of silicate minerals, aided by acidic products of pioneering plants and organisms as well as carbonic acid inputs from the atmosphere. Carbonic acid is produced in the atmosphere and soil layers through the carbonation reaction.

: &lt;chem&gt;H2O + CO2 &lt;=&gt; H+ + HCO3- H2CO3&lt;/chem&gt;

This is the dominant form of chemical weathering and aides in the breakdown of carbonate minerals (such as calcite and dolomite) and silicate minerals (such as feldspar). The breakdown of the Na-feldspar, albite, by carbonic acid to form kaolinite clay is as follows:

: &lt;chem&gt;2 NaAlSi3O8 + 2 H2CO3 + 9 H2O &lt;=&gt; 2 Na+ + 2 HCO3- + 4 H4SiO4 + Al2Si2O5(OH)4&lt;/chem&gt;

Evidence of this reaction in the field would be elevated levels of bicarbonate (), sodium and silica ions in the water runoff.

The breakdown of carbonate minerals: 

: &lt;chem&gt;CaCO3 + H2CO3 &lt;=&gt; Ca^2+ + 2 HCO3-&lt;/chem&gt;
: &lt;chem&gt;CaCO3 &lt;=&gt; Ca^2+ + CO3^2-&lt;/chem&gt;

The further dissolution of carbonic acid (H2CO3) and bicarbonate () produces CO2 gas. Oxidization is also a major contributor to the breakdown of many silicate minerals and formation of secondary minerals (diagenesis) in the early soil profile. Oxidation of olivine (FeMgSiO4) releases Fe, Mg and Si ions. The Mg is soluble in water and is carried in the runoff, but the Fe often reacts with oxygen to precipitate Fe2O3 (hematite), the oxidized state of iron oxide. Sulfur, a byproduct of decaying organic material, will also react with iron to form pyrite (FeS2) in reducing environments. Pyrite dissolution leads to low pH levels due to elevated H+ ions and further precipitation of Fe2O3 ultimately changing the redox conditions of the environment.

==Biosphere==
Inputs from the biosphere may begin with lichen and other microorganisms that secrete oxalic acid. These microorganisms, associated with the lichen community or independently inhabiting rocks, include blue-green algae, green algae, various fungi, and numerous bacteria. Lichen has long been viewed as the pioneers of soil development as the following 1997 Isozaki statement suggests:

However, lichens are not necessarily the only pioneering organisms nor the earliest form of soil formation as it has been documented that seed-bearing plants may occupy an area and colonize quicker than lichen. Also, eolian sedimentation (wind generated) can produce high rates of sediment accumulation. Nonetheless, lichen can certainly withstand harsher conditions than most vascular plants, and although they have slower colonization rates, they do form the dominant group in alpine regions.

Organic acids released from plant roots include acetic acid and citric acid. During the decay of organic matter phenolic acids are released from plant matter and humic acid and fulvic acid are released by soil microbes. These organic acids speed up chemical weathering by combining with some of the weathering products in a process known as chelation. In the soil profile, these organic acids are often concentrated at the top of the profile, while carbonic acid plays a larger role towards the bottom of the profile or below in the aquifer.
As the soil column develops further into thicker accumulations, larger animals come to inhabit the soil and continue to alter the chemical evolution of their respective niche. Earthworms aerate the soil and convert large amounts of organic matter into rich humus, improving soil fertility. Small burrowing mammals store food, grow young and may hibernate in the pedosphere altering the course of soil evolution. Large mammalian herbivores above ground transport nutrients in form of nitrogen-rich waste and phosphorus-rich antlers, while predators leave phosphorus-rich piles of bones on the soil surface, leading to localized enrichment of the soil.

==Redox conditions in wetland soils==
Nutrient cycling in lakes and freshwater wetlands depends heavily on redox conditions. Under a few millimeters of water, heterotrophic bacteria metabolize and consume oxygen. They therefore deplete the soil of oxygen and create the need for anaerobic respiration. Some anaerobic microbial processes include denitrification, sulfate reduction and methanogenesis and are responsible for the release of N2 (nitrogen), H2S (hydrogen sulfide) and CH4 (methane). Other anaerobic microbial processes are linked to changes in the oxidation state of iron and manganese. As a result of anaerobic decomposition, the soil stores large amounts of organic carbon because the soil carbon sponge stays intact.

The reduction potential describes which way chemical reactions will proceed in oxygen deficient soils and controls the nutrient cycling in flooded systems. Reduction potential is used to express the likelihood of an environment to receive electrons and therefore become reduced. For example, if a system already has plenty of electrons (anoxic, organic-rich shale) it is reduced. In a system, it will likely donate electrons to a part that has a low concentration of electrons, or an oxidized environment, to equilibrate to the chemical gradient. An oxidized environment has high redox potential, whereas a reduced environment has a low redox potential.

The redox potential is controlled by the oxidation state of the chemical species, pH and the amount of O2 there is in the system. The oxidizing environment accepts electrons because of the presence of O2, which acts as an electron acceptor:

: &lt;chem&gt;O2 + 4 e- + 4 H+ &lt;=» 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

This equation will tend to move to the right in acidic conditions. Higher redox potentials are found at lower pH levels. Bacteria, heterotrophic organisms, consume oxygen while decomposing organic material. This depletes the soils of oxygen, thus decreasing the redox potential. At high redox potential, the oxidized form of iron, ferric iron (Fe3+), will be deposited commonly as hematite. In low redox conditions, decomposition rates decrease and the deposition of ferrous iron (Fe2+) increase.

By using analytical geochemical tools such as X-ray fluorescence or inductively coupled mass spectrometry the two forms of Fe (Fe2+ and Fe3+) can be measured in ancient rocks therefore determining the redox potential for ancient soils. Such a study was done on Permian through Triassic rocks (300–200 million years old) in Japan and British Columbia. The geologists found hematite throughout the early and middle Permian but began to find the reduced form of iron in pyrite within the ancient soils near the end of the Permian and into the Triassic. These results suggest that conditions became less oxygen rich, even anoxic, during the late Permian, which eventually led to the greatest extinction in Earth’s history, the P-T extinction.

Decomposition in anoxic or reduced soils is also carried out by sulfur-reducing bacteria which, instead of O2 use as an electron acceptor and produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbon dioxide in the process:

: &lt;chem&gt;2 H+ + SO4^2- + 2 [CH2O] &lt;=&gt; 2 CO2 + H2S + 2 H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

The H2S gas percolates upwards and reacts with Fe2+ and precipitates pyrite, acting as a trap for the toxic H2S gas. However, H2S is still a large fraction of emissions from wetland soils. In most freshwater wetlands there is little sulfate () so methanogenesis becomes the dominant form of decomposition by methanogenic bacteria only when sulfate is depleted. Acetate, a compound that is a byproduct of fermenting cellulose is split by methanogenic bacteria to produce methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which are released to the atmosphere. Methane is also released during the reduction of CO2 by the same bacteria.

==Atmosphere==
In the pedosphere it is safe to assume that gases are in equilibrium with the atmosphere. Because plant roots and soil microbes release CO2 to the soil, the concentration of bicarbonate () in soil waters is much greater than that in equilibrium with the atmosphere, the high concentration of CO2 and the occurrence of metals in soil solutions results in lower pH levels in the soil. Gases that escape from the pedosphere to the atmosphere include the gaseous byproducts of carbonate dissolution, decomposition, redox reactions and microbial photosynthesis. The main inputs from the atmosphere are aeolian sedimentation, rainfall and gas diffusion. Eolian sedimentation includes anything that can be entrained by wind or that stays suspended in air and includes a wide variety of aerosol particles, biological particles like pollen, and dust particles. Nitrogen is the most abundant constituent in rain (after water), as water vapor utilizes aerosol particles to nucleate rain droplets.

==Soil in forests==
Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. Forest soils can form a thick soil carbon sponge. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches Mg, Fe, and aluminium (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers.

==Soil in the tropics==
Tropical forests receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year (8 tons of C/hectare/year). Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in temperate forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color.

==Soil in grasslands and deserts==
Precipitation in grasslands is equal to or less than evapotranspiration and causes soil development to operate in relative drought. Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation cause a buildup of calcium (Ca), and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Low amounts of precipitation and high levels of evapotranspiration limit the downward percolation of water and organic acids, reducing chemical weathering and soil development. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the calcium precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche.

Deserts behave similarly to grasslands but operate in constant drought as precipitation is less than evapotranspiration. Chemical weathering proceeds more slowly than in grasslands and beneath the caliche layer may be a layer of gypsum and halite. To study soils in deserts, pedologists have used the concept of chronosequences to relate the timing and development of the soil layers. It has been shown that phosphorus leaches very quickly from the system, and soil P-levels decrease with age. Furthermore, carbon buildup in the soils is decreased due to slower decomposition rates. As a result, the rates of carbon circulation in the biogeochemical cycle is decreased.

<text>Sigiriya or Sinhagiri (&quot;Lion Rock&quot; , , pronounced SEE-gi-ri-yə) is an ancient rock fortress located in the northern Matale District near the town of Dambulla in the Central Province, Sri Lanka. It is a site of historical and archaeological significance that is dominated by a massive column of granite approximately high.

According to the ancient Sri Lankan chronicle the &quot;Cūḷavaṃsa&quot;, this area was a large forest, then after storms and landslides it became a hill and was selected by King Kashyapa (AD 477–495) for his new capital. He built his palace on top of this rock and decorated its sides with colourful frescoes. On a small plateau about halfway up the side of this rock he built a gateway in the form of an enormous lion. The name of this place is derived from this structure; &quot;Sinhagiri&quot;, the Lion Rock.

The capital and the royal palace were abandoned after the king&#x27;s death. It was used as a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century. Sigiriya today is a UNESCO listed World Heritage Site. It is one of the best preserved examples of ancient urban planning.

== History ==
===Historical past===
It is likely that the area around Sigiriya was inhabited since prehistoric times. There is clear evidence that the many rock shelters and caves in the vicinity were occupied by Buddhist monks and ascetics from as early as the 3rd century BC. The earliest evidence of human habitation at Sigiriya is the Aligala rock shelter to the east of Sigiriya rock, indicating that the area was occupied circa 3000 BC during the Mesolithic Period.
Buddhist monastic settlements were established during the 3rd century BC in the western and northern slopes of the boulder-strewn hills surrounding the Sigiriya rock. Several rock shelters or caves were created during this period. These shelters were made under large boulders, with carved drip ledges around the cave mouths. Rock inscriptions are carved near the drip ledges on many of the shelters, recording the donation of the shelters to the Buddhist monastic order as residences. These were made in the period between the 3rd century BC and the 1st century AD.

In 477 AD, Kashyapa I, the king&#x27;s son by a non-royal consort, seized the throne from King Dhatusena, following a coup assisted by Migara, the King&#x27;s nephew and army commander. The rightful heir, Moggallana, fearing for his life, fled to South India. Afraid of an attack by Moggallana, Kashyapa moved the capital and his residence from the traditional capital of Anuradhapura to the more secure Sigiriya. During King Kashyapa&#x27;s reign (477–495 AD), Sigiriya was developed into a complex city and fortress. Most of the elaborate constructions on the rock summit and around it, including defensive structures, palaces, and gardens, date from this period.

The &quot;Cūḷavaṃsa&quot; describes King Kashyapa as the son of King Dhatusena. Kashyapa murdered his father by walling him up alive and then usurping the throne which rightfully belonged to his half-brother Moggallana, Dhatusena&#x27;s son by the true queen. Moggallana fled to India to escape being assassinated by Kashyapa, but vowed revenge. In India he raised an army with the intention of returning and retaking the throne of Sri Lanka, which he considered to be rightfully his. Expecting the inevitable return of Moggallana, Kashyapa is said to have built his palace on the summit of Sigiriya as a fortress as well as a pleasure palace. Moggallana finally arrived, declared war, and defeated Kashyapa in 495 AD. During the battle Kashyapa&#x27;s armies abandoned him and he committed suicide by falling on his sword.

The &quot;Cūḷavaṃsa&quot; and folklore inform us that the war elephant on which Kashyapa was mounted changed course to take a strategic advantage, but the army misinterpreted the movement as the king&#x27;s having opted to retreat, prompting the army to abandon him altogether. It is said that being too proud to surrender he took his dagger from his waistband, cut his throat, raised the dagger proudly, sheathed it, and fell dead. Moggallana returned the capital to Anuradhapura, converting Sigiriya into a Buddhist monastery complex, which survived until the 13th or 14th century. After this period, no records are found on Sigiriya until the 16th and 17th centuries, when it was used briefly as an outpost of the Kingdom of Kandy.
Alternative stories have the primary builder of Sigiriya as King Dhatusena, with Kashyapa finishing the work in honour of his father. Still other stories describe Kashyapa as a playboy king, with Sigiriya his pleasure palace. Even Kashyapa&#x27;s eventual fate is uncertain. In some versions he is assassinated by poison administered by a concubine; in others he cuts his own throat when deserted in his final battle. Still further interpretations regard the site as the work of a Buddhist community, without a military function. This site may have been important in the competition between the Mahayana and Theravada Buddhist traditions in ancient Sri Lanka.

In Professor Senarath Paranavithana&#x27;s book &quot;The Story of Sigiri&quot;, King Dathusena is said to have taken the advice of the Persian Nestorian Priest Maga Brahmana on building his palace on Sigirya. According to Paranavithana, during this period over 75 ships carrying Murundi soldiers from Mangalore arrived in Sri Lanka and landed in Chilaw to protect King Dathusena, most of them Christians. King Dathusena&#x27;s daughter was married to Migara, a Christian and the commander of the Singhalese army. 
According to Leonard Pinto, Paranavitana&#x27;s story is not widely accepted as it is contrary to recorded &quot;Mahavamsa&quot; textual sources from this period.

== Archaeological remains and features ==

In 1831 Major Jonathan Forbes of the 78th (Highlanders) Regiment of Foot of the British Army, while returning on horseback from a trip to Pollonnuruwa, encountered the &quot;brushwood-covered summit of the rock of Sigiri&quot;. Sigiriya came to the attention of antiquarians and, later, archaeologists. Archaeological work at Sigiriya began on a small scale in the 1890s. H.C.P. Bell was the first archaeologist to conduct extensive research on Sigiriya. The Cultural Triangle Project, launched by the Government of Sri Lanka, focused its attention on Sigiriya in 1982. Archaeological work began on the entire city for the first time under this project. There was a sculpted lion&#x27;s head above the legs and paws flanking the entrance, but the head collapsed years ago.

Sigiriya consists of an ancient citadel built by King Kashyapa during the 5th century. The Sigiriya site contains the ruins of an upper palace located on the flat top of the rock, a mid-level terrace that includes the Lion Gate and the mirror wall with its frescoes, the lower palaces clings to the slopes below the rocks. The moats, walls and gardens of the palace extended for a few hundred metres from the base of the rock. The site was both a palace and a fortress. The upper palace on the top of the rock includes cisterns cut into the rock.

=== Site plan ===
Sigiriya is considered to be one of the most important urban planning sites of the first millennium, and the site plan is considered very elaborate and imaginative. The plan combined concepts of symmetry and asymmetry to intentionally interlock the man-made geometrical and natural forms of the surroundings. On the west side of the rock lies a park for the royals, laid out on a symmetrical plan; the park contains water-retaining structures, including sophisticated surface/subsurface hydraulic systems, some of which are working today. The south contains a man-made reservoir; these were extensively used from the previous capital of the dry zone of Sri Lanka. Five gates were placed at entrances. The more elaborate western gate is thought to have been reserved for the royals.

== Frescoes ==
John Still in 1907 wrote, &quot;The whole face of the hill appears to have been a gigantic picture gallery... the largest picture in the world perhaps&quot;. The paintings would have covered most of the western face of the rock, an area long and high. There are references in the graffiti to 500 ladies in these paintings. However, most have been lost forever. More frescoes, different from those on the rock face, can be seen elsewhere, for example on the ceiling of the location called the &quot;Cobra Hood Cave&quot;.

Although the frescoes are classified as in the Anuradhapura period, the painting style is considered unique; the line and style of application of the paintings differing from Anuradhapura paintings. The lines are painted in a form which enhances the sense of volume of the figures. The paint has been applied in sweeping strokes, using more pressure on one side, giving the effect of a deeper colour tone towards the edge. Other paintings of the Anuradhapura period contain similar approaches to painting, but do not have the sketchy lines of the Sigiriya style, having a distinct artists&#x27; boundary line. The true identity of the ladies in these paintings still has not been confirmed. There are various ideas about their identity. Some believe that they are the ladies of the kings while others think that they are women taking part in religious observances. These pictures have a close resemblance to paintings seen in the Ajanta Caves in India.

=== 1967 vandalism incident ===

On 14 October 1967, paint was splashed on the frescoes in an act of vandalism. Luciano Maranzi, an expert trained at the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property in Rome, assisted the restoration, which took until 11 April 1968. It was considered the most challenging effort undertaken by the Chemical Preservation Division of the Department of Archaeology. There is continued concern that the original colours of the frescoes are fading, with a report presented in 2010 suggesting that the 22 frescoes have been fading since 1930.

== Mirror wall ==
Originally this wall was so reflective that the king could see himself as he walked alongside it. Made of brick masonry and covered in highly polished white plaster, the wall is now partially covered with verses scribbled by visitors, some of them dating from as early as the 8th century. Most, however, date from the 9th and 10th century. People of all walks of life, from poets to provincial governors to housewives, wrote on the wall. This is the only evidence of poetry found in the Anuradhapura period.

One example is;

This couplet uses a play on words as in the combination of &quot;hasun&quot; (message) with &quot;hasun&quot; (swans). The poet&#x27;s eagerness to hear from his lady love is compared to the bee&#x27;s fascination for lotus blooms, whose large petals provide it an easy landing pad to drink its nectar and frolic if it wishes.

Out of the 1500 plus poems, most are addressed to the ladies on the frescoes. Men praised their beauty and women shared their envy. A contemporary female, clearly less enamoured with the frescoes, records different, if equally passionate emotions:

&quot;A deer-eyed maiden of the mountain side arouses anger in my mind. In her hand she holds a string of pearls, and in her eyes she assumes rivalry with me.&quot;

Further writing on the mirror wall now has been banned for the protection of the old writings. The Archaeological Commissioner of Ceylon, Senarath Paranavithana, deciphered 685 verses written in the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries CE on the mirror wall. One such poem from these long-past centuries,

:බුදල්මි
:සියොර ආමි සිහිගිරි
:බැලීමි ගි බොහො ජන
:ලිතූයෙන් නොලිමි 

Roughly translated from ancient Sinhala, is: &quot;I am Budal [the writer&#x27;s name]. Came with hundreds of people to see Sigiriya. Since all the others wrote poems, I did not!&quot;

== Gardens ==
The gardens of Sigiriya are among the oldest landscaped gardens in the world. The gardens are divided into three distinct but linked forms: water gardens, cave and boulder gardens, and terraced gardens.

=== Water gardens ===
The water gardens are in the central section of the western precinct. Three principal gardens are found here. The first garden consists of a plot surrounded by water. It is connected to the main precinct using four causeways, with gateways placed at the head of each causeway.

The second contains two long, deep pools set on either side of the path. Two shallow, serpentine streams lead to these pools. Fountains made of circular limestone plates are placed here. Underground water conduits supply water to these fountains which are still functional, especially during the rainy season. Two large islands are located on either side of the second water garden. Summer palaces are built on the flattened surfaces of these islands. Two more islands are located farther to the north and the south. These islands are built in a manner similar to the island in the first water garden.

The third garden is situated on a higher level than the other two. It contains a large, octagonal pool with a raised podium on its northeast corner. The large brick and stone wall of the citadel is on the eastern edge of this garden.

The water gardens are built symmetrically on an east–west axis. The outer moat connects them on the west and the large artificial lake to the south of the Sigiriya rock. All the pools are also interlinked using an underground conduit network fed by the lake, and connected to the moats. A miniature water garden is located to the west of the first water garden, consisting of several small pools and watercourses. This recently discovered smaller garden appears to have been built after the Kashyapan period, possibly between the 10th and 13th centuries.

=== Boulder gardens ===
The boulder gardens consist of several large boulders linked by winding pathways. The gardens extend from the northern slopes to the southern slopes of the hills at the foot of Sigiris rock. Most of these boulders had a building or pavilion upon them; there are cuttings that were used as footings for brick walls and beams. They used to be pushed off from the top to attack enemies when they approached.
=== Terraced gardens ===
The terraced gardens are formed from the natural hill at the base of the Sigiriya rock. A series of terraces rises from the pathways of the boulder garden to the staircases on the rock. These have been created by the construction of brick walls, and are located in a roughly concentric plan around the rock. The path through the terraced gardens is formed by a limestone staircase. From this staircase, there is a covered path on the side of the rock, leading to the uppermost terrace where the lion staircase is situated.

== In popular culture ==
* Some scenes from the music video for the 1982 single &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; by Duran Duran were filmed at the top of Sigiriya.
* Sigiriya was featured in the eleventh episode of &quot;The Amazing Race 6&quot; in 2005.
* Arthur C. Clarke based the fictional &quot;Yakkagala&quot; on Sigiriya in his novel &quot;The Fountains of Paradise&quot;. He felt that the reality of Sigiriya was &quot;so astonishing that I have had no need to change it in any way.&quot;

<text>Guillermo Scott Herren is an American producer who has been based in Atlanta, Barcelona, and New York City. Herren releases music under the aliases Prefuse 73, Delarosa &amp; Asora, Ahmad Szabo, and Piano Overlord, and is also part of the groups Savath y Savalas, Sons of the Morning, Fudge, Risil, and Diamond Watch Wrists.

==Biography==
Guillermo Scott Herren was born in Miami, Florida, and grew up in Atlanta, Georgia. His father is Catalan and his mother is Irish and Cuban. At an early age his parents encouraged him to play piano and other instruments; his mother &quot;forced&quot; Herren to play a wide variety of instruments, even going so far as to teach him the Suzuki Method in order to &quot;keep him out of trouble&quot;. Growing up, Herren&#x27;s musical tastes branched out and he became interested in hip-hop, punk rock, and electronic music.

He began his career DJing at MJQ, a small night club in Atlanta, and then began working in commercial studios producing hip-hop tracks for Dirty South rappers. However, Herren wanted to create his own music and started collecting second-hand instruments and drum machines during this part of his career. He eventually moved to New York City to go to college; there he began recording his first major release, &quot;Sleep Method Suite&quot;, under the name of Delarosa and Asora. The album was released in 1997.

In 2000, Herren released the album &quot;Folk Songs for Trains, Trees, and Honey&quot; under the name Savath &amp; Savalas.

Herren first released music under the name Prefuse 73 with 2001&#x27;s commercially and critically successful &quot;Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives&quot;. A year later, a 4-track EP &quot;The &#x27;92 vs. &#x27;02 Collection&quot; was released. In 2003, Herren released the album &quot;One Word Extinguisher&quot;, one of his best known Prefuse 73 albums to date. A companion album, &quot;&quot; was released afterwards showing off some of the production &quot;outtakes&quot; and remixes that were omitted from the initial release.

2005 saw the release of &quot;Surrounded by Silence&quot;, Herren&#x27;s third album as Prefuse 73. The album featured more collaborations with a variety of musicians, including rappers both underground and mainstream. Herren&#x27;s next Prefuse 73 release, &quot;Security Screenings&quot;, was released in 2006; though as long as a full-length, the release was touted as an EP. On August 8, 2007, the fourth Prefuse 73 album, &quot;Preparations&quot; was announced and it was released on October 15, 2007. The album is sold with a bonus full-length disc titled &quot;Interregnums&quot;, featuring songs that were more ambient and contemplative than usual Prefuse 73 material.

Along with partners Peter Rentz, Carolina Chaves, Ben Loiz, Carlos Niño, and Paz Ochs, Herren started the Eastern Developments Music label.

In June 2008, Herren announced the formation of a new collaborative project, Risil, which includes members of Sunn O))), Hella, School of Seven Bells, Pivot, and others. On June 24, 2009, the supergroup released their debut LP, entitled &quot;Non Meters Volume 1&quot;. Herren also released a new Savath &amp; Savalas album, entitled &quot;La Llama&quot;, earlier in March of the same year, and a new Prefuse 73 LP entitled &quot;Everything She Touched Turned Ampexian&quot;.

In 2009, under the name Diamond Watch Wrists, he and Zach Hill contributed a cover of a Pivot song to the &quot;Warp20 (Recreated)&quot; compilation. The group later released the album &quot;Ice Capped At Both Ends&quot;.

Herren released three sets under the name Prefuse 73 in 2015: two EPs (&quot;Forsyth Gardens&quot; and &quot;Every Color of Darkness&quot;) and an album, &quot;Rivington Não Rio&quot;.

<text>Vaya Con Dios (Spanish for &quot;Go with God!&quot;) is a Belgian music act that stood out for its mixing of styles, as well as the distinctive voice of its lead singer Dani Klein. It was one of the most successful Belgian music acts ever, having sold more than 10 million albums and more than 3 million singles.

It was founded in 1986, but after 1991 Vaya Con Dios was for the most part a one woman band, centered on singer, lyricist, band leader and producer Dani Klein, reinforced by an ever-changing selection of musicians. In 2014, Dani Klein performed her last international tour under the Vaya Con Dios formula. Vaya Con Dios officially disbanded with their last concert on 25 October 2014, in Forest National. In 2022 Vaya Con Dios returned with a new album. 

==Biography==
Vaya Con Dios was founded in 1986 by Dirk Schoufs, Dani Klein (Danielle Schoovaerts) and Willy Lambregt (known as Willy Willy). Schoufs (1962; double bass) and Lambregt (1959; guitars) were close friends, who had frequently worked as an acoustic duo. Klein (1953; lead singer, lyricist) and Lambregt had previously worked in electronic band Arbeid Adelt !, which lost momentum when band leader Marcel Vanthilt left to become an MTV Europe VJ.

After enjoying a one-off performance as a trio, they decided to form Vaya Con Dios, based on shared interests in gypsy music, jazz and opera – genres they felt were underappreciated in Brussels.

The trio&#x27;s first single &quot;Just a Friend of Mine&quot; (1987) entered the top 20 in Belgium, and became a top 10 hit in France. This was a milestone especially for Klein, who was now 34, and who had been trying to make it as a singer since age 17.
After this first hit, Lambregt left the band, well before the 1988 debut album &quot;Vaya Con Dios&quot; was completed, and was later replaced by Jean-Michel Gielen. This first album, self-produced by Schoufs and Klein, met with mixed critical acclaim, mostly because it was very eclectic, and difficult to categorize. Nevertheless, it was well received in several European countries, and held three more singles.

The 1990 follow-up album &quot;Night Owls&quot; was again produced by Klein and Schoufs, and produced another three singles. &quot;Nah Neh Nah&quot;, an up-tempo mix of Latin and jazz-rock, profited from heavy airplay on MTV Europe. &quot;What&#x27;s a Woman?&quot;, a soul ballad, did well across Europe, and became a number one hit in the Netherlands and Belgium.

In 1991, Schoufs and Klein fell out badly, resulting in Schoufs&#x27; departure from the band, only to die months later, on 24 May 1991, at the age of just 29, of a cocktail of medication, alcohol, and drugs.

Klein, left playing with just Gielen and various musicians, nevertheless continued to record a new Vaya Con Dios album, while at the same time doing more and more international performances, due to ever-increasing popularity. In 1992, &quot;Time Flies&quot; was released, produced mostly by Klein herself. Again three singles were released from the album, the dramatic &quot;Heading For a Fall&quot; doing well in several countries. The album did very well in Europe, reaching number one in Switzerland and getting platinum certification in four countries, eventually proving to be the most successful Vaya Con Dios album. In 1993 it was followed with the first Vaya Con Dios world tour.

In 1995 Klein, by then evidently suffering from a high workload, still managed to record a fourth Vaya Con Dios album: &quot;Roots and Wings&quot;, from which yet another three singles were released. Recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Alabama, the album is even more soul oriented, while at the same time integrating Arab and India music influences. Again there was album chart success in several European countries.

In 1996 Klein quit the music business because of complete fatigue, marked by spontaneous hair loss. She returned in 1999 as the singer in the group Purple Prose, which released a debut album that year. Vaya Con Dios returned in 2004 with a new album titled &quot;The Promise&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot; greatest hits album was released. It featured Aaron Neville on a new recording of the 1990 soul ballad &quot;What&#x27;s a Woman?&quot; In October 2009, the album &quot;Comme on est venu&quot; was released, for the first time with all songs in French (one of Klein&#x27;s first languages). In December 2010, the German DJ Duo Milk &amp; Sugar released a remix of the song &quot;Nah Neh Nah&quot; that reached the Top 10 in the German Media-Control Charts.

In 2013, Dani Klein started a farewell tour, the last Vaya Con Dios tour ever. The last concert was held 25 October 2014 at Forest National in Brussels, but in 2022, after 8 years, the band returned with a new album &#x27;What&#x27;s a Woman&#x27;.
In March 2023, Dani Klein revealed during an interview to the Greek music website, SounDarts.gr, that during the COVID-19 pandemic, she had recorded a very last Vaya Con Dios album with original songs in the style and the atmosphere of the band. She also revealed a song title from this album (“Always Something Missing”)..

<doc id="1203168" wikidata="Q2375704" url="?curid=1203168" title="Great Shelford">
<text>Great Shelford is a village located approximately to the south of Cambridge, in Cambridgeshire, in eastern England. In 1850 Great Shelford parish contained bisected by the River Cam. The population in 1841 was 803 people. By 2001, this had grown to 3,949 and by the Census 2011 to 4,233. It was 
described as Britain&#x27;s twenty-second richest village in 2011.

Great Shelford is twinned with Verneuil-en-Halatte, in the Oise département of France.

==Services and culture==

Great Shelford has a range of shops and services, including a wine merchant/bar, two public houses, two restaurants, a library, several estate agents, two barbers, a building society, a chemist, a dentist, a solicitor, an accountant, a delicatessen, a bakery and a garden centre. There is a monthly Farmers&#x27; Market. The villages of Great and Little Shelford are served by Shelford railway station on the West Anglia Main Line from Cambridge to London Liverpool Street. The old Great Shelford library was demolished and replaced by a new building which incorporates affordable housing by Bedfordshire Pilgrims Housing Association.

A large country house in the village was used for a concert named &#x27;The Tea Set&#x27; in October 1965, which featured performances from Pink Floyd, Jokers Wild and Paul Simon. The same house was also used again in 1969 as the location for the cover art of Pink Floyd&#x27;s album &quot;Ummagumma&quot;.

The Shelford Delicatessen features in a 2008 list by &quot;The Independent&quot; of The 50 Best Delicatessens in Britain.

==Notable buildings==
===Parish church===

The parish church of Saint Mary the Virgin has changed little since Thomas Patesle rebuilt it in 1307; he can be seen in a monumental brass in his vicar&#x27;s robes on the chancel floor. The tower was rebuilt with the original materials after its collapse in 1798.

The church porch is two-storeyed with a splendid pelican in its fine vaulted roof, the doorway having an old niche with a Madonna. The spacious interior has tall arcades with medieval clerestories over them and heads between the arches, and eight fine oak angels look down from the hammerbeams of the roof. There is a 15th-century screen with tracery in the north aisle enclosing an altar in memory of a soldier killed on the Indian frontier; above the altar is a painting of two saints and a Roman soldier by the cross. The chancel stalls are carved with wild roses, the sedilia with grapes and acorns, and the reredos has a gleaming white sculpture of the Crucifixion with saints and angels under rich canopies. There are a few fragments of old glass, fragments of Norman carving set in a wall, and above the chancel arch a medieval painting of &quot;Doom&quot;, fading away.

=== Houses===
De Freville Farm is a 16th-century timber-framed farmhouse with hall and cross wings. Oak Cottage is also 16th century and has a richly carved bressumer. Maris Farmhouse is a listed 16th-century cottage in half an acre of garden with a disused pump for the area. It is built from unsawn logs, with wattle and daub walls, and with the exterior rendered. The roof was originally thatched and was probably in the style of nearby properties.

==History==
===Manors and families===
Several great estates shared the two Shelfords, notably that of the de Freville family, whose manor house survives (and was resold in 2005) at Little Shelford, and who were there as early as 1300. But all appear to have generally had absentee landlords who sold copyhold lands and generally let others on long renewable leases. Farming survived at Great Shelford well into the 20th century. Several Yeoman families of note, the Deans, Howling, and Tunwell families, farmed here for centuries.

One example is Richard Tunwell (1645–1713) who acquired land at Great Shelford, his first acquisition being a mere of pasture, a copse and a close which was copyhold land belonging to the Bury manor. When Freville&#x27;s Manor was purchased [as superior proprietor] by William Freeman in 1701, the lands in Great Shelford belonging to the Manor were described as of arable, and a half a rood of meadow, of pasture, a sheepwalk or liberty of foldage and fold course for six store ewes, all by then in the occupation of Richard Tunwell. The Manor also had of meadow in Little Shelford which again was occupied by Richard Tunwell. A rent roll of the Manor of Granhams dated 1708 shows that Tunwell and his sons held copyhold land from that Manor as well. From 1678 onwards, Richard Tunwell served as a Juror on the Bury Baron Court. By 1705, as a landed proprietor, he had qualified as a parliamentary voter and the Poll Book for the election held in that year shows that he voted for Sir Richard Cullen and John Bromley.

The Killingworth family also owned land at Shelford, as when Richard Killingworth of Great Bradley in Suffolk, gentleman, made his will on 12 September 1586, he left the following legacies to the poor – of Fulbourne £10; Balsham (where his son John held the manor) £10; Great Shelford £5; Little Shelford £5; and Cambridge £20.

===Historical geography===
Great Shelford was colonised by academics of the University of Cambridge in Victorian times; in the 20th century it became a home for commuters. However the original settlement pattern can still be traced. The core of the modern village lies between the sites of two Anglo-Saxon settlements one of which itself occupied the site of a Romano-British village and the other was nearer to Little Shelford.

== Education ==
Shelford is home to Great and Little Shelford CofE (A) Primary School. In 2023 it had 211 pupils and in 2018 obtained a &quot;Good&quot; Ofsted rating. The headteacher is Christopher Grey.

==Sport and activities==
Shelford&#x27;s Rugby Union team, Shelford RFC, competes in the R.F.U.&#x27;s National League 2 South, and plays its home fixtures at its ground on Cambridge Road, in the north of the village. Great Shelford Cricket Club plays in the Cambridgeshire &amp; Huntingdon Premier League Division 2. In 2017 the club boasts 3 Senior sides and 4 Junior teams. The first team finished a club record 3rd in the league, winning 8 games consecutively to conclude the 2017 season. The cricket club shares a ground with Cambridgeshire League football club, Great Shelford F.C.; however the Cricket Club played all home team first eleven fixtures at Cokenach CC for the 2018 season.

Shelfords and Stapleford have a very active Scout Group with a Beaver Colony, a Cub Pack and a Scout Troop. GirlGuiding has a Guide group, Brownies and Rainbows. All these groups meet in the Scout and Guide HQ within the village.

==Notable people==
Great Shelford was home to children&#x27;s author Philippa Pearce, who renamed it &quot;Great Barley&quot; (with the neighbouring village of Little Shelford becoming &quot;Little Barley&quot;, and Cambridge itself becoming &quot;Castleford&quot; and losing its university) in her books, most notably &quot;Minnow on the Say&quot; (1955). In this and other books the River Cam, which flows through the village, became the River Say. The writer was brought up in Great Shelford and after some years in London lived there again from 1973 to her death in 2006. Sir Peter Hall, the theatrical director, lived in the station house as a child and the author Tom Sharpe had a house in the village. Writer Michael J. Bird lived in Great Shelford in his last years.

The ancestry of US President Barack Obama was traced to the village in 2009, bringing Great Shelford into the national media.

==Events==
The Shelford Festival and Feast takes place every year in the 2nd week of July. The origins of the Shelford Feast date back to medieval times. The Feast continued until the Second World War, the last one being held in 1938 until revived in 1994. Since 1994 The Shelford Feast has been held every year except 2020, and by 2023 had donated £370,000 to local good causes. The next Shelford Feast Day will be on July 7th 2024 with a festival events from July 6th to 13th.

<doc id="1203176" wikidata="Q256183" url="?curid=1203176" title="Duncan White">
<text>Major Deshamanya Duncan M. White MBE, ED (1 March 1918 – 3 July 1998) was a Sri Lankan sportsman. He was the first Ceylonese athlete to win an Olympic medal, winning silver in the 400-metre hurdles at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, England. He was also the second South Asian to have won an Olympic medal in track and field after Norman Pritchard of India, with the third being Susanthika Jayasinghe, another Sri Lankan, who won a silver medal in the 200 metres in 2000.

==Early life==

White was born on 1 March 1918 in Lathpandura, near Kalutara, in British Ceylon, the second of four children of John Bernard White and Cecilia Hawk. He had three brothers, Frederick A., also an athlete, Stanley Leonard and Douglas Andrew (died 1960). He was educated at Trinity College, Kandy where he was awarded &#x27;Trinity Lion&#x27; for athletics; however, this was subsequently withdrawn for disciplinary reasons. He left Trinity in 1937.

==Sporting career==

He was selected to the college athletics team at the age of 16 in 1934. He became the college athletics captain at the age of 18 in 1936. He took part in 400-yard hurdles at the 1938 British Empire Games but could not deliver the expected performances after suffering a hamstring injury. He was incredibly the only schoolboy to have picked in the Ceylonese contingent for the 1938 British Empire Games. He became champion at national public schools championships, Ceylon championships and India-Ceylon championships. He was chosen to represent Ceylon at the dual meet against India in 1945 (Indo-Ceylon Dual Athletic Meet) where he competed in the men&#x27;s 4×100 yards relay event alongside Summa Navaratnam, R. E. Kitto and Basil Henricus.

In 1948, he was selected for the team that represented Ceylon at that year&#x27;s Summer Olympics in London; the country had gained its independence from Britain that year. It was also historically Sri Lanka&#x27;s first ever appearance at the Olympics. White was also chosen as the flag-bearer for the Dominion of Ceylon during the opening ceremony of the 1948 Summer Olympics.
During the 1948 Summer Olympics trials, he surprisingly withdrew from competing in men&#x27;s 100m and 400m events, a decision which did not go too well with the sports officials and the authorities at the times.

He won silver in the 400-meter hurdles in the final on 31 July 1948, the first Olympic medal for Ceylon. He had trained for only about 3 months before the games while the gold medallist, Roy Cochran of the United States, had trained for about 4 years. Most importantly, White secured Sri Lanka&#x27;s first ever Olympic medal in the county&#x27;s debut appearance at the Games. His silver medal achievement came only two days after the opening ceremony of the Olympics. White&#x27;s time, 51.8 seconds, was only 0.7 seconds behind Cochran; both times bettered the existing Olympic record.

He competed in men&#x27;s 200m event but was did not progress beyond first round.

After the Olympic victory, White was welcomed at a ceremony at Trinity College and was honoured with the return of his &#x27;Lion&#x27;. In his speech at the special assembly, White said: &quot;[A]lthough my victory at the Olympics is prestigious, the &#x27;Lion&#x27; makes me feel more honoured than that&quot;, and received the &#x27;Lion&#x27; with open arms. The Government of Ceylon awarded him a scholarship to Loughborough University, where he won the Inter-University Challenge Shield. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) and awarded the Helms World Trophy as the &quot;Most Outstanding Athlete&quot; in Asia.

In the 1950 British Empire Games in Auckland, New Zealand, White won the 440-yard hurdles, only 0.3 seconds behind the world record. He also became the first Sri Lankan to win a gold medal in any sporting event after the independence of the Dominion of Ceylon. He also teamed up with fellow prominent track and field athletes Summa Navaratnam, John de Saram and Oscar Wijesinghe in the men&#x27;s 4 × 110 yards event where Ceylon finished at fourth position during the 1950 British Empire Games. He also missed out on another bronze medal chance after placing fourth position in the men&#x27;s 4 × 400 yards event.

==Military career==

In 1942, during World War II, White was commissioned as an officer in the Ceylon Light Infantry. He was demobilised in 1947. He later joined the Ceylon Volunteer Force, going on to become a Major and gaining the Efficiency Decoration.

==Academic career==

After graduating from Loughborough, he returned to Ceylon in 1951 and was appointed the physical education lecturer at the teachers&#x27; college in Maharagama. In 1958, the Department of Education appointed him coach of the Sri Lanka Schools Athletic Association. In 1963 he took up a post as lecturer at the University of Nigeria and went on to become a senior lecturer at the University of Ibadan. He eventually settled in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England, briefly returning to Nigeria as an advisor on sports activities.

The Duncan White Sports Foundation was founded on his 72nd birthday, 1 March 1990, and White presented the first award to Sriyantha Dissanayake on 1 March 1991.

==Personal life and death==

White married Angela Siebel in 1952 and had six children: Maxine, Nita, Christopher, Dan, Marilyn and Fiona. His brother Freddie White was a Sri Lankan legendary field hockey player. He died in 1998 in Nuneaton, despite having said that he intended to migrate with his family to Australia. His wife remained in Nuneaton.

== Honours ==

He was conferred with the prestigious Deshamanya award in 1998 by the then Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga exactly on the 50th anniversary of his silver medal achievement which was accomplished on 31 July 1948.

<text>The  was one of the shinnōke, branches of the Imperial Family of Japan which were, until 1947, eligible to succeed to the Chrysanthemum Throne in the event that the main line should die out.

==History==
The Arisugawa-no-miya house was founded by Prince Yoshihito, seventh son of Emperor Go-Yōzei (d. 1638), and was originally named Takamatsu-no-miya. The house changed its name to Arisugawa-no-miya after its second head, Prince Nagahito, was elevated to the throne as Emperor Go-Sai.

The Arisugawa-no-miya house traditionally served as instructors in calligraphy and &quot;waka&quot; composition to successive generations of Emperors. After the Meiji Restoration in 1868, when Emperor Meiji was restored, his uncle, Prince Arisugawa Taruhito (1835–1895), became commander-in-chief, and in 1875 Chancellor of the Realm. After his suppression of the Satsuma Rebellion in 1875, he was made a field-marshal, and he was again commander-in-chief in the First Sino-Japanese War. His younger brother, Prince Arisugawa Takehito (1862–1913), was from 1879 to 1882 attached to the British navy, as a military attaché and later as a cadet. He went on to command positions in the Japanese Navy and represented Japan in formal visits to England.

The Arisugawa line ended early in the twentieth century when no male heirs remained. However, the Imperial Household Agency revived the original title of Takamatsu-no-miya for the third son of Emperor Taishō. The line again became extinct on Prince Takamatsu Nobuhito’s death, as he had no children.

In 2003, an impostor to the Arisugawa line appeared, and stole a great deal of money.

==Dynasty==

※In Imperial Household Law at that time, an Imperial prince was not taken from his birth family by the adopted family. Prince Nobuhito re-founded the Takamatsu-no-miya. Therefore, Prince Nobuhito was not considered the eleventh generation Takamatsu-no-miya but the first generation of the second Takamatsu-no-miya.

<text>The Adam style (also called Adamesque or the Style of the Brothers Adam) is an 18th-century neoclassical style of interior design and architecture, as practised by Scottish architect William Adam and his sons, of whom Robert (1728–1792) and James (1732–1794) were the most widely known.
The Adam brothers advocated an integrated style for architecture and interiors, with walls, ceilings, fireplaces, furniture, fixtures, fittings and carpets all being designed by the Adams as a single uniform scheme. Their style is commonly known under the mistaken plural &quot;Adams style&quot;.

The &quot;Adam style&quot; found its niche from the late 1760s in upper-class and middle-class residences in 18th-century England, Scotland, Russia (where it was introduced by Scottish architect Charles Cameron), and post-Revolutionary War United States (where it became known as Federal style and took on a variation of its own). The style was superseded from around 1795 onwards by the Regency style and the French Empire style.

==Background==

===Building boom===
During the 18th century there was much work for eager architects and designers, as Britain experienced a boom in the building of new houses, theatres, shops, offices and factories, with towns growing rapidly due to the onset of the Industrial Revolution. The emphasis was on modernisation, with regulations being introduced to clean up the nation&#x27;s streets, promoting the re-paving of roads and pavements, improving drainage and street lighting, and better fireproofing of buildings with the widespread use of brick and stone. 
Speculative building was rife, with some developers focussing on high speed and low cost. Sometimes, newly built houses collapsed due to poor workmanship; whilst others continually shifted on their foundations, giving rise to the phrase &quot;things that go bump in the night&quot;, as mysterious crashes, creaks and thuds were heard by their inhabitants late at night. 
London experienced major expansion, with the newly built West End, which included the elegant squares of Mayfair; areas of the East End of London were also developed, such as the new terraces in Spitalfields. The cities of Edinburgh, Bristol and Dublin were all expanded and modernised. Birmingham was described in 1791 as being the &quot;first manufacturing town in the world&quot;. Manchester and Liverpool each saw their population triple between 1760 and 1800. New towns, like Bath, were constructed around natural spas. Old medieval cities and market towns, such as York and Chichester, had their buildings re-fronted with brick or stucco, plus new sash windows, to give the impression of modernity, despite the underlying structures remaining medieval.

===Pattern books and style guides===
The Neoclassical style was all the vogue throughout the 18th century, and many style guides were published to advise builders how their finished properties should look. Influential guides included Stephen Riou&#x27;s &quot;The Grecian Orders&quot; (1768), and Batty Langley&#x27;s &quot;A Sure Guide to Builders&quot; (1729), &quot;The Young Builder&#x27;s Rudiments&quot; (1730 and 1734), &quot;Ancient Masonry&quot; (1736), &quot;The City and Country Builder&#x27;s and Workman&#x27;s Treasury of Designs&quot; (1740 and later editions), &quot;The Builder&#x27;s Jewel&quot; (1741). Architects, designers, cabinet makers, stonemasons, and craftsmen published pattern books and style guides to advertise their ideas, thereby hoping to attract a lucrative clientele.

==The Adam style==

The work of the Adam brothers set the style for domestic architecture and interiors for much of the latter half of the 18th century.

Robert and James Adam travelled in Italy and Dalmatia in the 1750s, observing the ruins of the classical world. On their return to Britain, they set themselves up with their older brother, John, as architects. Robert and James published a book entitled &quot;The Works in Architecture&quot; in instalments between 1773 and 1779. This book of engraved designs made the &quot;Adam&quot; repertory available throughout Europe. The Adam brothers aimed to simplify the rococo and baroque styles which had been fashionable in the preceding decades, to bring what they felt to be a lighter and more elegant feel to Georgian houses. &quot;The Works in Architecture&quot; illustrated the main buildings the Adam brothers had worked on and crucially documented the interiors, furniture and fittings, designed by the Adams. 
A parallel development of this phase of neoclassical design is the French Louis XVI style.

The Adam style moved away from the strict mathematical proportions previously found in Georgian rooms, and introduced curved walls and domes, decorated with elaborate plasterwork and striking mixed colour schemes using newly affordable paints in pea green, sky blue, lemon, lilac, bright pink, and red-brown terracotta.

Artists such as Angelica Kauffman and Antonio Zucchi were employed to paint classical figurative scenes within cartouches set into the interior walls and ceilings.

The Adam&#x27;s main rivals were James Wyatt, whose many designs for furniture were less known outside the wide circle of his patrons, because he never published a book of engravings; and Sir William Chambers, who designed fewer furnishings for his interiors, preferring to work with such able cabinet-makers as John Linnell, Thomas Chippendale, and Ince and Mayhew. So many able designers were working in this style in London from circa 1770 that the style is currently more usually termed &quot;Early Neoclassical&quot;.
It was typical of &quot;Adam style&quot; to combine decorative neo-Gothic details into the classical framework. So-called &quot;Egyptian&quot; and &quot;Etruscan&quot; design motifs were minor features.

The &quot;Adam style&quot; is identified with:
* Classical Roman decorative motifs, such as framed medallions, vases, urns and tripods, arabesque vine scrolls, sphinxes, griffins, and dancing nymphs
* Flat grotesque panels
* Pilasters
* Painted ornaments, such as swags and ribbons
* Complex pastel colour schemes

The Adam style was superseded from around 1795 onwards by the simpler Regency style in Britain; and the French Empire style in France and Russia, which was a more imperial and self-consciously archeological style, connected with the First French Empire.

==Influences==
The Adam style was strongly influenced by:
* Frescoes and wall paintings found in the newly excavated Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum
* Greek black and red-figure painted vases, which were being excavated and collected in large numbers from Etruscan tombs in Italy, and then thought to be Etruscan.
* Classical Greek architecture, which was known in Britain through publications such as James Stuart and Nicholas Revett&#x27;s book &quot;The Antiquities of Athens&quot; published in 1762.

==Revival==

Interest in the Adam style was revived in the late Victorian and Edwardian eras, initiated by a spectacular marquetry cabinet by Wright &amp; Mansfield exhibited at the Paris Exposition of 1867. Reproduction furniture in the general &quot;Regency Revival&quot; style, to which the Adam revival was closely linked, was very popular with the expanding middle classes from circa 1880 to 1920. They were attracted to the light and elegant designs, as a contrast to the heavier and more cluttered interiors which had dominated their homes during the second half of the 19th century. The revival competed with the Arts and Crafts style, which continued to be popular in Britain up to the 1930s. The Adam and Regency revivals, however, lost mainstream momentum after World War I, being replaced by Art Deco in popular taste.

<text>Michael Kupperman (born April 26, 1966), also known by the pseudonym P. Revess, is an American cartoonist and illustrator. He created the comic strips &quot;Up All Night&quot; and &quot;Found in the Street&quot;, and has written scripts for DC Comics. His work often dwells in surrealism and absurdity &quot;played as seriously as possible.&quot;

His work has appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Screw&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;, &quot;Libération&quot;, &quot;Nickelodeon Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Believer&quot;, and &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, as well as in comics anthologies such as &quot;Hotwire&quot;, &quot;Snake Eyes&quot;, &quot;Zero Zero&quot;, &quot;Hyena&quot;, &quot;Hodags and Hodaddies&quot;, &quot;Blood Orange&quot;, &quot;Rosetta&quot;, &quot;106U&quot;, and &quot;Legal Action Comics&quot;. He has also worked on many books and projects for McSweeney&#x27;s.

== Biography ==
Kupperman spent part of his childhood in England. Later on, back in the United States, his parents became professors at the University of Connecticut. His mother is Karen Ordahl Kupperman, noted historian of Early America. His father is Joel J. Kupperman, the most famous of the original 1940s Quiz Kids. When Michael was young, between ages ten and twelve, he was fascinated with editorial cartoons, particularly the work of Pat Oliphant. As a young man, Kupperman did a political strip for the &quot;Washington City Paper&quot;.

HarperCollins published Kupperman&#x27;s book &quot;Snake &#x27;n&#x27; Bacon&#x27;s Cartoon Cabaret&quot; in 2000. Parts of his work were animated later that year for the Comedy Central show &quot;TV Funhouse&quot;, produced by Robert Smigel and Dino Stamatopoulos. In 2005, he started a comic book series called &quot;Tales Designed To Thrizzle&quot;, published by Fantagraphics. As of 2009, Kupperman is writing sketches for a new comedy series starring Peter Serafinowicz, and he created a one-off pilot called &quot;Snake &#x27;N&#x27; Bacon&quot; for the Adult Swim network.

In 2013, Kupperman won the Eisner Award for &quot;Moon 1969: The True Story of the 1969 Moon Launch&quot;, published in &quot;Tales Designed to Thrizzle&quot; Vol. 2, Issue 8.

In 2013, Michael Kupperman started a biography of his father Joel, who was a child celebrity in the 1940s. Kupperman published the book, &quot;All the Answers&quot;, in May 2018, getting a Publishers Weekly Best Book of the Year award.

Kupperman lives in Brooklyn, New York, with his son, Ulysses Dougherty, and his wife, Muire Dougherty.

<text>The R-33 (, NATO reporting name: AA-9 Amos) is a long-range air-to-air missile developed by Vympel. It is the primary armament of the MiG-31 interceptor, intended to attack large high-speed targets such as the SR-71 Blackbird, the B-1 Lancer bomber, and the B-52 Stratofortress.

It uses a combination of semi-active radar homing for initial acquisition and mid-course updates, and inertial navigation to reach the target at extreme range. The Zaslon phased array radar of MiG-31 allows six missiles to be guided simultaneously at separate targets.

The R-33 AAM remains in service with the CIS and Russian forces (See MiG-31 operators).

==Development==
The history of the R-33 missile is tightly bound to the story of its launcher, the MiG-31. The development of the modernized MiG-25, E-155MP, was authorized by a governmental decision of 24 May 1968. There was a competition for future missiles for the E-155MP. Izdeliye 410 by &quot;Vympel&quot; of A.L.Lyapin won, while the K-50 by PKPK of M.R.Bisnovat lost. The missile was assigned the development name K-33, continuing the series of K-13 and K-23 missiles. The development was headed by vice-chief designer V.V.Zhuravlev and leading designer Y.K.Zakharov.

The R-33/MiG-31 missile/interceptor combination is similar to the earlier Bisnovat R-40/MiG-25 combination, although it is much more versatile and modern in that the MiG-25 was very heavily specialized for the interception of large supersonic targets such as the cancelled North American XB-70 Valkyrie bomber, and thus lacks maneuverability and is not suitable for air combat maneuvering. The MiG-31 is a much more versatile and capable aircraft and is still able to employ the older R-40.

Two prototypes were built in 1968, featuring nose-mounted manoeuvring fins and intended for carriage on underwing pylons, similar to the Bisnovat R-40 on board the MiG-25.

The draft project was completed in 1970 and progressed to testing using testbed aircraft. One of these was a converted early-production MiG-25 (aircraft P-10), and was used in 1972 for autonomous test launches from the upgraded APU-40 pylon. A MiG-21 (serial 76211524) was converted into the LL-21 testbed to test the missile seekers, while a Tu-104 jetliner (serial 42324) was converted into LL-104-518 (also known as LL-2) by NTK &quot;Vzlet&quot; to test the MFBU-410/&quot;Zaslon&quot; radar along with missile homing heads mounted on GVM-410 mockups. The space on board the passenger aircraft-based testbed allowed for the carriage of extensive diagnostic and support equipment.

The K-33 was evaluated with the RGS-33 SARH seeker and the TGS-33 IR seeker. Other candidates included active radar homing and dual IR/radar homing seekers. The final decision was made in favor of semi-active radar homing with an inertial initial stage. The homing device, designated MFBU-410 was developed by B.I.Ermakov under the supervision of Akopyan.

The missile design was significantly altered later in 1972. The seeker and warhead were enlarged, the span of the control fins was reduced from 1100 mm to 900 mm. Further, the mounting system was revised to include new under-fuselage slipper pylons, akin to the Phoenix mount on the American F-14, and the missile was reoriented, so it mounted with the fins cruciform rather than diagonal; the fins on the mounting (dorsal) side were made to fold to the side, to lie flush against the belly of the carrying aircraft. Consequently, the missile launch method also needed to be changed. Rather than launching directly from the mounting pylon, the redesigned missile used drop-launch, with the missile being jettisoned from the pylon on launch, and its rocket motor igniting on a time-delay.

A small run of one dummy (for launch system testing), 5 &#x27;programmed&#x27; (guidance and propulsion only, no warhead) and 8 fully functional trial missiles were built to the new design before the end of 1972. Of those 14, three were launched from the MiG-25P-10 testbed in 1973. Different warhead types (high explosive fragmentation and continuous-rod warhead) were evaluated, and tests of the radar and seeker systems were conducted on the LL-2. 1974 saw 11 more test launches from the MiG-25P-10, and the production of another 40 trial missiles. The first AKU-33 launchers and B-410 warheads were built. &quot;Zaslon&quot; tests continued at Akhtubinsk using the LL-2.

The first flight of the future MiG-31 (aircraft No.831) took place on 16 September 1975, with 12 more flights by the end of the year. The MiG-25P-10 testbed launched 20 more test missiles before being sent for its launchers to be upgraded, and the first telemetric missile launches from the LL-2 were carried out that year.

Development continued in 1976, including launches at PRM-2 parachute targets in April. Factory tests were completed in 1977 with 32 launches from the MiG-31 prototype, the first launch being against a MiG-17 drone on 26 March 1977). The guidance systems were improved during 1978, and the radar/missile combination performed a simultaneous launch at 4 targets in August.

State trials started in March 1979 using MiG-31 No.83210. They were successfully completed in 1980. A government decision on 6 May 1981 recommended R-33 into service.

<doc id="1203218" wikidata="Q500529" url="?curid=1203218" title="St James's Square">
<text>St James&#x27;s Square is the only square in the St James&#x27;s district of the City of Westminster and is a garden square. It has predominantly Georgian and Neo-Georgian architecture. For its first two hundred or so years it was one of the three or four most fashionable residential streets in London. It now has headquarters of a number of well-known businesses, including BP and Rio Tinto Group; four private members&#x27; clubs, the East India Club, the Naval and Military Club, the Canning Club, and the Army and Navy Club; the High Commission of Cyprus; the London Library; and global think tank and peace-promoter Chatham House.

A main feature is a high, stone-plinthed equestrian statue of William III erected in 1808.

==History==
In 1662 Charles II extended a lease over the 45 acres of Pall Mall (St James&#x27;s) Field held by Henry Jermyn, 1st Earl of St Albans, to 1720 and soon afterwards the earl began to lay out the property for development. The earl petitioned the king that the class of occupants they both hoped to attract to the new district would not take houses without the prospect of eventually acquiring them outright, and in 1665 the king granted the freehold of the site of St. James&#x27;s Square and some closely adjacent parts of the field to the earl&#x27;s trustees. The location was convenient for the royal palaces of Whitehall and St James. The houses on the east, north and west sides of the square were soon developed, each of them being constructed separately as was usual at that time.
In the 1720s seven dukes and seven earls were in residence. The east, north and west sides of the square contained some of the most desirable houses in London. At first glance they do not appear much different from most other houses in the fashionable parts of the West End, but this is deceptive. The windows were more widely spaced than most, the ceilings were high, and deep plots and ingenious planning allowed some of the houses to contain a very large amount of accommodation indeed (see the plans in the Survey of London extract linked below and note that this is not reflected in the extract from Horwood&#x27;s map shown as he had no access to the interiors). Some of the houses had fine interiors by leading architects such as Matthew Brettingham, Robert Adam and John Soane.

The southern side of the square was much more modest. The plots were just sixty feet deep and an average of 22 feet wide. They originally faced Pall Mall and had Pall Mall numbers (the modern reconstructions, which are mostly offices, have fronts to both the square and the street). The residents of these houses were not eligible to be trustees of the trust which administered the square or even to use the central garden. The idea of buying them out, demolishing their houses and leaving the space open to the Pall Mall was raised more than once, but never implemented.

In 1727, an ornamental basin and fountain were constructed in the Square&#x27;s center. Although the plans for the fountain were later abandoned, and water no longer supplied by the 1730s, the basin remained until 1854, when it was removed following complaints by residents during a cholera epidemic.

Things began to change by the 1830s with the arrival of club-houses, and in 1844 &quot;The Builder&quot; commented that the square was losing caste and the fashionable were migrating to Belgravia. By 1857 the square contained a bank, an insurance society, two government offices, the London Library, two lodging-houses and three clubs. However, some of the houses continued to be occupied by the fashionable and wealthy into the twentieth century.

The Libyan embassy in St James&#x27;s Square was the site of the 1984 Libyan Embassy Siege. According to a news report of the time:
==Addresses==

The numbering starts with Number 1 to the north of Charles Street (now Charles II Street) on the eastern side of the square and proceeds anti-clockwise as far as Number 21. The Army and Navy Club&#x27;s clubhouse occupies the former sites of Number 22, a smaller adjacent house which may have had a George Street number, and several former houses in Pall Mall. Norfolk House at the southern end of the square is Number 31, and the two houses to its north are Numbers 32 and 33. A small house in the angle of the square south of Norfolk House, originally numbered in John Street, and the adjacent house in Pall Mall, have been combined and allocated the number 31A.

The smaller houses along the southern side had Pall Mall numbers until 1884. This block is now occupied by a mixture of 19th and 20th century buildings which are fully built up to the pavements on both sides. Some of them have their main entrance in Pall Mall and others in the square, and there are two separate sets of numbers for them. The numbers in the square range from 22A to 30, with some omissions.

*No. 1: BP head office. Also occupies the site of the former No. 2 and several demolished houses in Charles II Street. It is a post-modern building dating from c.2000 which differs from the Georgian style of the street. It was built to be Ericsson&#x27;s London office and was sold to BP for £117 million in 2001.
*No. 3: The original house had many owners and tenants, including the holders of at least three separate dukedoms, and was worked on by various architects including John Soane. General Augustus Pitt-Rivers lived in the house as a child during the 1830s and 1840s. The present building is a 1930s office block.
*No. 4: The Naval and Military Club in a Georgian house of 1726–28 by Edward Shepherd. It was the London residence of the Earls Cowper for much of the 19th Century and its châtelaines included Emily, Countess Cowper and Viscountess Palmerston and Ettie Grenfell, Baroness Desborough, niece of the last Earl Cowper. It was also the former home of Nancy Astor and the only house in the square to retain its large garden and the original mews house to the rear.
*No. 5: Wentworth House, 5, St James&#x27;s Square, built in 1748-51 by William Wentworth, 2nd Earl of Strafford, to the design of Matthew Brettingham The Elder 1748–9. Refronted in stone, porch added, and attic converted into a full storey in 1854. Now offices; in 1984 it was the Libyan &quot;People&#x27;s Bureau&quot;, when during the Libyan Embassy Siege gunshots fired from the building caused the murder of Yvonne Fletcher.
*No. 6: (Under Demolition) Rio Tinto Group head office. Modern. This building was the home of the Hervey family (Earls and Marquesses of Bristol) for nearly 300 years. Lord Arthur Hervey was born at the house in 1808. In the 1950s the old building was knocked down, and the family did not return.
*No. 7: Neo Georgian, architect Edwin Lutyens, 1911.
*No. 8: Neo Georgian, architects Robert Angell and Curtis, 1939. In November 2007, No. 8 and neighbouring No. 7 were bought for £125m.
*Nos. 9 to 11: Numbers 9, 10 and 11 were built in the 1730s on the site of the former Ormonde House, once the largest house in the square. Henry Flitcroft supervised number 10 and probably also numbers 9 and 11. No. 10 is Chatham House, former home of British Prime Minister William Pitt the Elder and of the Earl and Countess of Blessington. There is a London County Council plaque on Number 10 stating &quot;Here lived Three Prime Ministers WILLIAM PITT Earl of Chatham 1708–1778 Edward Geoffrey Stanley EARL OF DERBY 1799–1869 William Ewart GLADSTONE 1809–1898&quot;.
*No. 12: Built 1836, probably by Thomas Cubitt. Former home of Ada Lovelace.
*No. 13: Built 1735–1737, possibly by Matthew Brettingham. Now houses the High Commission of the Republic of Cyprus.
*No. 14: Occupied by the London Library since 1845, rebuilt for them 1896–98 and subsequently extended to the rear.
* No. 15: , by James Stuart, 1764–6. Balcony added circa 1791 by Samuel Wyatt. So-called after Thomas Anson, 1st Earl of Lichfield, resident when the Lichfield House Compact was agreed there in 1835. Now offices.

*No. 16 and site of former No. 17: East India Club, built in 1865 to designs by Charles Lee.
*No. 18: Italianate reconstruction of 1846. Now apartments.
*No. 19: The London home of the Dukes of Cleveland and family from 1720 to 1894. A replacement building of 1898–99 used variously as offices and residentially was replaced by the present stone-clad offices in 1999–2000. Current site of the Rolex UK headquarters.

*No. 20/21: Robert Adam&#x27;s reconstruction of No. 20 for Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn from 1771 to 1775 is one of the most praised of his smaller works. The house was three bays wide and had three main storeys plus an attic. In 1936 it was extended to include the rebuilt No. 21 to its south, forming a uniform seven bay façade with an extra full storey on top. This address became the London offices for the enterprise software company Autonomy Corporation in December 2010.
*(Former) No. 22 and adjacent buildings: replaced by the Army and Navy Club 1848–51. It had a bold Venetian exterior. This has been lost and the present building is in a mean mid 20th century style.
*Nos. 22A to 30: See above. Little historical or architectural significance, except that the now defunct Junior Carlton Club once occupied a grand clubhouse at the western end of the block.
*No. 31: Norfolk House – the London residence of the Dukes of Norfolk for many generations, was built between 1748 and 1752 by Edward Howard, 9th Duke of Norfolk to the design of Matthew Brettingham &quot;the Elder&quot;, and was demolished in 1938. It was then replaced by a neo-Georgian office building of the same name which was U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s headquarters during the Second World War, where Operation Torch and Operation Overlord were planned.
*No. 32: Built by Samuel Pepys Cockerell and Charles Robert Cockerell in 1819–21 under the (59 Geo. 3. c. &quot;45&quot;) as a residence for the Bishop of London, named London House. In 1851 it was one of the residences of the then Bishop of London, Charles James Blomfield. Later alterations. Used as offices.
*No. 33: By Robert Adam (1770–72) replacing an earlier house. Altered by John Soane 1817–23. Later alterations including an additional storey, but still essentially Georgian. Used as offices.

==Gardens==
The gardens in the centre of the square are maintained and cared for by the St James&#x27;s Square Trust, which receives its financial support from the building freeholders. The trust was established by the (12 Geo. 1. c. 25), which authorised the freeholders to raise a rate on themselves to &quot;clean, adorn and beautify&quot; the square: this was the earliest statute passed to regulate a London square, and is the only one still in unamended operation. The gardens are normally open to the public on weekdays from 7.30am to 4.30pm, but are kept locked and accessible only to freeholders and residents at other times. They are used on an occasional basis as a venue for art exhibitions, weddings, and other functions.

<doc id="1203224" wikidata="Q2962228" url="?curid=1203224" title="Chelsea, Quebec">
<text>Chelsea is a municipality located immediately north of Gatineau, Quebec, Canada, and about north of Ottawa. Chelsea is located within Canada&#x27;s National Capital Region. It is the seat of Les Collines-de-l&#x27;Outaouais Regional County Municipality.

Its population was 8000 in the 2021 Canadian Census. The population of Chelsea is almost evenly divided between anglophones and francophones, with both official languages being spoken in roughly 70% of households.

The municipality has a reputation for being environmentally responsible, and was one of the first in Canada to ban the use of pesticides. While 60% of the area consists of Gatineau Park, much of the rest of Chelsea is residential.

A sports complex, the Meredith Centre, was developed in 2012 next to Chelsea Elementary School. The complex hosts a hockey rink, community rooms, and soccer fields. The mayor of Chelsea, QC is Pierre Guénard.

Part of the film &quot;Grey Owl&quot; was shot on the Gatineau River. A number of regionally and nationally well-known musicians, filmmakers, and artists live in Chelsea, including Ian Tamblyn.

==Geography==
Chelsea is a roughly triangle-shaped municipality that includes much of the southern and eastern parts of Gatineau Park, and is bordered on the east by the Gatineau River. The southern border is south of Old Chelsea, the municipality historical centre, and runs north to the community of Farm Point. Beyond Farm Point lies the municipality of La Pêche and the village of Wakefield. North of Old Chelsea is Camp Fortune, a popular alpine ski club 15 minutes from Downtown Ottawa.

==History==
Chelsea is named after the Vermont town of its first settler, Thomas Brigham, who was a partner and son-in-law of Philemon Wright and arrived there in 1819. The name has been in use since the early 19th century: Old Chelsea (1819), Parish Saint-Stephen-of-Chelsea (1835), Chelsea (circa 1870). In 1875, the municipality was established as Hull-Partie-Ouest, or commonly referred to as West Hull. The municipality was renamed to its current name in 1990.

During World War II, the Royal Canadian Navy wanted to understand more about the propagation of radio waves and how they were affected by the earth&#x27;s ionosphere so that German radio transmissions could be intercepted more efficiently. In cooperation with the National Research Council, the RCN established a &quot;field intensity station&quot; at Chelsea in 1941 to monitor the height of the ionosphere.

Chelsea, also known as an ionospheric observatory, was established in 1941 and closed down in 1947. It was located on the north side of Old Chelsea Road a few hundred yards west of Highway 105. The Chelsea station operated during the post-war period but in 1947, its work was transferred to the Defence Research Board&#x27;s new Radio Propagation Laboratory in Ottawa. Shortly thereafter, the station was demolished. Today, there are no traces of the single shack or the many masts that were once erected on the property.

<doc id="1203232" wikidata="Q539883" url="?curid=1203232" title="Thad Jones">
<text>Thaddeus Joseph Jones (March 28, 1923 – August 20, 1986) was an American jazz trumpeter, composer and bandleader who has been called &quot;one of the all-time greatest jazz trumpet soloists&quot;.

==Biography==
Thad Jones was born in Pontiac, Michigan, to Henry and Olivia Jones, a musical family of 10 (an older brother was pianist Hank Jones and a younger brother was drummer Elvin Jones). A self-taught musician, Thad began performing professionally at the age of 16. He served in U.S. Army bands during World War II (1943–1946).

After his military service, which included an association with the U.S. Military School of Music and working with area bands in Des Moines and Oklahoma City, Jones became a member of the Count Basie Orchestra in May 1954. He was featured as a soloist on such well-known tunes as &quot;April in Paris&quot;, &quot;Shiny Stockings&quot;, and &quot;Corner Pocket&quot;. However, his main contribution to Basie&#x27;s organization was nearly two dozen arrangements and compositions, which included &quot;The Deacon&quot;, &quot;H.R.H.&quot; (Her Royal Highness – in honor of the band&#x27;s command performance in London), &quot;Counter Block&quot;, and lesser known tracks such as &quot;Speaking of Sounds&quot;. His hymn-like ballad &quot;To You&quot; was performed by the Basie band combined with the Duke Ellington Orchestra in their only recording together, and the recording &quot;Dance Along With Basie&quot; contains nearly an entire album of Jones&#x27;s uncredited arrangements of standard tunes. In 1959, Jones played cornet on Thelonious Monk&#x27;s &quot;5 by Monk by 5&quot; album.

Jones left the Basie Orchestra in 1963 to become a freelance arranger and musician in New York City. In 1965, he and drummer Mel Lewis formed the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra. The group started with informal late-night jam sessions among New York&#x27;s top studio musicians. They began performing at the Village Vanguard in February 1966, to wide acclaim, and continued with Jones in the lead for 12 years. They won a 1978 Grammy Award for their album &quot;Live in Munich&quot;. Jones taught at William Paterson College in New Jersey, now the Thad Jones Archive site, containing pencil scores and vintage photos as part of the Living Jazz Archives.

In January 1979, Thad suddenly moved to Copenhagen, Denmark (to the great surprise of his New York bandmates), where several other U.S. jazz musicians had gone to live. There he became the leader of The Danish Radio Big Band, and married a Danish woman, Lis. 

Jones transformed the Danish Radio Big Band into one of the world&#x27;s best. The result can be heard on a live-recording from the Montmartre in Copenhagen. In July 1979, Jones formed a new big band, Eclipse, with which he recorded a live album, &quot;Eclipse&quot;. Several Americans were on the album: pianist Horace Parlan, baritonist Sahib Shihab, trumpeter Tim Hagans, and trombonist/vocalist Richard B. Boone. The rest of the band comprised trombonists Bjarne Thanning and Ture Larsen, trumpeter Lars Togeby, altoists Ole Thøger and Michael Hove, tenor saxophonist Bent Jædig, and bassist Jesper Lundgaard. Jones further composed for the Danish Radio Big Band and taught jazz at the Royal Danish Conservatory in Copenhagen. He studied composition formally during this period, and also took up the valve trombone.

In February 1985, Jones returned to the U.S. to take over the leadership of the Count Basie Orchestra, upon his former leader&#x27;s death. Jones fronted the Basie band on numerous tours, also writing arrangements for recordings and performances with vocalist Caterina Valente and the Manhattan Transfer, but had to step down due to ill health. He returned to his home in Copenhagen for the last few months of his life, and died of cancer on August 20, 1986, aged 63, at Herlev Hospital. 

In later years, his playing ability was diminished due to a lip injury, but his composing and arranging skills blossomed. His best-known composition is the standard &quot;A Child Is Born&quot;.

At the time of his death, Jones had a six-year-old son, also named Thad (Thaddeus Joseph William Jones), with his wife, Lis Jones. He had a daughter Thedia and a son Bruce in the U.S. Jones was buried in Copenhagen&#x27;s Vestre Kirkegård Cemetery (Western Churchyard Cemetery).

Thad Jones has a street named after him in southern Copenhagen, &quot;Thad Jones Vej&quot; (Thad Jones Street).

<text>Ryke Geerd Hamer (17 May 1935 – 2 July 2017) was a German former physician and the originator of Germanic New Medicine (GNM), also formerly known as German New Medicine and New Medicine, a system of pseudo-medicine that purports to be able to cure cancer. The Swiss Cancer League described Hamer&#x27;s approach as &quot;dangerous, especially as it lulls the patients into a false sense of security, so that they are deprived of other effective treatments.&quot;

Hamer held a licence to practice medicine from 1963 until 1986, when it was revoked for malpractice. His system came to public attention in 1995, when the parents of a child suffering from cancer refused medical treatment (chemical therapy or chemotherapy) in favour of Hamer&#x27;s methods. Hamer was charged with malpractice and imprisoned in several European countries.

Hamer claimed that his method was a &quot;Germanic&quot; alternative to mainstream clinical medicine, which he claimed is part of a Jewish conspiracy to decimate non-Jews.

He is the father of Dirk Hamer, who died of gunshot wounds allegedly inflicted by Vittorio Emanuele di Savoia. Former model and actress Birgit Hamer is his daughter.

==Biography==
Ryke Geerd Hamer was born in Mettmann, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, in 1935. He received his high school diploma at age 18 and started medical and theological studies in Tübingen, where he met Sigrid Oldenburg, a medical student who later became his wife. At age 20, Hamer passed the preliminary examination in medicine, and in April 1962 passed his medical state examination in Marburg, Hesse. He was granted a professional license as a doctor of medicine in 1963. After spending several years at the University Clinics of Tübingen and Heidelberg, Hamer completed his specialization in internal medicine in 1972. He also worked in several practices with his wife.

Hamer&#x27;s license to practice medicine in Germany was revoked in 1986 by a court judgment, which was reconfirmed in 2003. As he continued to practice illegally, Hamer was investigated several times over allegations of malpractice and causing the deaths of patients. By 1997, Hamer owned clinics in Germany, Belgium, Italy, Austria, and the Netherlands. Hamer was arrested and jailed for twelve months in Germany from 1997 to 1998, and served a prison term from September 2004 to February 2006 in Fleury-Mérogis, France, on counts of fraud and unlicensed practice of medicine.

Hamer&#x27;s habilitation thesis about the GNM at the University of Tübingen in 1986 was rejected after multiple examinations by several members of the medical faculty, who concluded that his work lacked scientific methods and reproducibility and his arguments did not support his theories. Hamer claimed that his system was verifiable and that the University of Trnava in Slovakia had already confirmed some of his theories. In fact, the University of Trnava has no real medical faculty and the documents which allegedly confirmed his view are not available nor registered at the university. In 1999, that university also rejected his habilitation thesis.

Hamer lived in voluntary exile in Spain until March 2007, when Spanish medical authorities held him responsible for dozens of preventable deaths. He resided in Norway until his death from a stroke on 2 July 2017, age 82.

==Germanic new medicine==
On 8 August 1978, Hamer&#x27;s son, Dirk, was shot by the son of the last king of Italy, Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy, while asleep on a yacht off Cavallo and died on 7 December of that year. Sometime after Dirk&#x27;s death, Hamer developed testicular cancer and thought there was a link between the two events, so he began to develop Germanic new medicine (GNM), which can be summarized in its &quot;five biological laws&quot;:
* 1st law (&quot;iron rule&quot;): Severe diseases originate from a shock event which is experienced by the individual as very difficult, highly acute, dramatic, and isolating. The shock’s psychological conflict content determines the location of the appearance of a focus of activity in the brain that can be seen in a CT scan as a set of concentric rings, called Hamer focus or HH (from German: Hamerscher Herd), which correspond to the location of the disease in the body. The subsequent development of the conflict determines the development of both the brain focus and the disease.
* 2nd law (two-phased nature of disease): A patient who has not solved their conflict is in the first, active conflict phase, where the sympathetic nervous system predominates and which manifests as a &quot;cold disease&quot; accompanied by cold skin and extremities, stress, weight loss and sleep disorders. If they manage to resolve the conflict, they enter a second, post-resolution healing phase, in which the parasympathetic nervous system predominates, commonly diagnosed as a separate &quot;warm&quot; (rheumatic, infectious, allergic, etc.) disease. This second phase is the one that usually entails more risks, and a complete cure only comes upon its completion. In some circumstances, not solving the conflict but downgrading it to a reasonably livable level may be preferable to facing the second phase.
* 3rd law (ontogenetic system of diseases): Hamer proposes that disease progression is primarily controlled by the brain, either by the &quot;old brain&quot; (brainstem and cerebellum) or the &quot;new brain&quot; (cerebrum). The old brain controls more primitive processes, having to do with basic survival, such as breathing, eating, and reproduction, whereas the new brain manages more advanced personal and social issues, such as territorial conflicts, separation conflicts, and self-devaluation and identity conflicts. Hamer&#x27;s research is tied to the science of embryology because he links the type of disease progression—whether involving tissue augmentation (tumor growth), tissue loss (necrosis or ulceration), or functional impairment—with the embryonic germ layer (endoderm, mesoderm or ectoderm) from which both the organ tissues and the corresponding brain regions originate. Conflicts which have their focus either in the brain stem (which controls body tissues that derive from the endoderm) or the cerebellum (which controls tissues that derive from the mesoderm) show cell multiplication in the conflict active phase, and destruction of the resulting tumors in the healing phase. Cerebrum directed conflicts (affecting the rest of mesoderm-derived tissues and all ectoderm-derived ones) show either cell decrease (necroses, ulcers) or function impairment or interruption in the active phase, and the replenishment of the damaged tissues in the healing phase (which can also be diagnosed as a tumor).
* 4th law (ontogenetic system of microbes): Microbes do not cause diseases but are used by the body, coordinated by the brain, to optimize the healing phase, provided that the required microbes are available when needed. Fungi and mycobacteria work on tissues that originated in the endoderm, as well as on some of the tissues originating in the mesoderm. Bacteria work on all mesoderm-derived tissues and viruses on ectoderm-derived ones. Hamer maintains that these microbes, rather than being antagonistic to the body, actually perform a necessary role in healing, and that some of the interventions of conventional medicine are counterproductive, by interfering with these natural processes.
* 5th law (&quot;quintessence&quot;): The conflict active phase and the healing phase of diseases, as described above, constitute &quot;special meaningful programs of nature,&quot; developed during the evolution of the species, to allow organisms to override everyday functioning in order to deal with particular emergency situations.

Therefore, according to Hamer, no real diseases exist; rather, what established medicine calls a &quot;disease&quot; is actually a &quot;special meaningful program of nature&quot; (&quot;sinnvolles biologisches Sonderprogramm&quot;) to which bacteria, viruses and fungi belong. Hamer&#x27;s GNM claims to explain every disease and treatment according to those premises, and to thereby obviate traditional medicine. The cure is always the resolving of the conflict. Some treatments like chemotherapy or pain relieving drugs like morphine are deadly according to Hamer. These &quot;laws&quot; are dogmas of GNM, not laws of nature or medicine, and are at odds with scientific understanding of human physiology.

==Olivia Pilhar case==
In 1995, Hamer was associated with the case of Olivia Pilhar, a six-year-old Austrian girl who suffered from a Wilms tumor. Pilhar&#x27;s parents were members of Fiat Lux, a new religious movement whose leader Uriella referred them to Hamer. He diagnosed the girl as having several &quot;conflicts&quot; rather than cancer. When the parents refused conventional medical therapy for Pilhar, the Austrian government removed their rights of care and control. The parents fled with their daughter to Spain, which was Hamer&#x27;s place of residence at the time.

After negotiations, including the intervention of the Austrian President Thomas Klestil, the parents were persuaded to return to Austria. By then, Pilhar&#x27;s health had deteriorated. The tumor had grown very large, weighing four kilograms, filling most of her abdominal cavity and was pressing against her lungs. The lack of treatment had reduced the estimate of survival probability from 90% to 10%. After a court ordered conventional cancer treatment with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, Pilhar recovered completely and was still alive in 2010. Her parents received an eight-month suspended jail sentence in Austria.

==Jewish conspiracy theory==
Hamer purported that his method is a &quot;Germanic&quot; alternative to mainstream clinical medicine, which he claimed is part of a Jewish conspiracy to decimate non-Jews. In this, Hamer repeated the antisemitic claims of Nazi physician Gerhard Wagner. More precisely, Hamer asserted that chemotherapy and morphine are used to &quot;mass murder&quot; Western civilization, while falsely alleging that such treatments are not used in Israel. Hamer promoted the idea that most German oncologists are Jewish and that &quot;no Jew is treated with chemotherapy in Germany.&quot; According to him, hypodermic needles are used during chemotherapy to implant &quot;chips&quot; containing &quot;chambers of poison&quot; that can be activated by satellite to specifically kill patients. He proposed that the swine flu vaccination campaign of 2009 was also used to mark people with those &quot;chips&quot; and denied the existence of HIV. Hamer also believed that the denial of recognition of his theories and the revocation of his practitioner&#x27;s licence is due to a Jewish conspiracy.

In 2008, Hamer presented a document where a supposed rabbi, &quot;Esra&quot; Iwan Götz, confirmed the existence of a conspiracy among Jewish oncologists to use the &quot;torture&quot; of chemotherapy on all non-Jewish patients, while Jewish patients were to receive the &quot;correct&quot; treatment of GNM. Götz, a German holocaust denier active in the German Reich revivalism scene, has been repeatedly convicted by German courts for fraud, defamation, misuse of academic titles (the title &quot;Chief Rabbi&quot; is not legally protected in Germany), and the falsification of documents, among others.

==Response by medical authorities==
The Swiss Cancer League of the Swiss Society for Oncology, Swiss Society for Medical Oncology, and Swiss Institute for Applied Cancer Research say that no case of a cancer cure by Hamer has been published in the medical literature, nor any studies in specialised journals. Reports in his books &quot;lack the additional data that are essential for medical assessment&quot; and the presentations of his investigations, at medical conferences &quot;are scientifically unconvincing.&quot; Additionally, the German Cancer Research Center, the German Cancer Society, the German Medical Association and German Consumer Councils strongly disagree with Hamer.

Proponents of alternative cancer treatments also regard Hamer&#x27;s theory skeptically and argue for supportive evidence and proven patient cases.

The Hamer foci that Hamer saw in the brain CTs are identified by radiologists as common ring artifacts.

The medical establishment in Germany and the European Union warns of the threat posed to patients by Hamer&#x27;s therapies. If effective treatment is neglected, the applying of Hamer&#x27;s theories is punishable in some countries as malpractice.

There are ongoing press reports of victims of Hamer&#x27;s practice throughout Europe.

<doc id="1203252" wikidata="Q318222" url="?curid=1203252" title="Abebe Aregai">
<text>&quot;Ras&quot; Abebe Aregai (Amharic: አበበ አረጋይ; 18 August 1903 – 17 December 1960) was an Ethiopian military commander who served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia from 27 November 1957 until his death. He was a victim of the unsuccessful 1960 Ethiopian coup.

During the Italian occupation, he led a group of resistance fighters. They were collectively known as the &quot;Arbegnoch&quot; (), and operated in Menz. The British IWM labeled Abebe “one of the bravest men in the modern world.” 

==Early life==
Abebe was born on 18 August 1903 in the village of Woira Amba-Jirru in northern Shewa. His father was Aregai Bechere, an ethnic Amhara, and his mother was Askale Gobena, an ethnic Oromo and the daughter of &quot;Ras&quot; Gobena Dacche. He served in the &quot;Kebur Zabagna&quot;, rising to the rank of Major before transferring to the police, and by 1935 had been granted the title of &quot;Balambaras&quot;. He was the chief of police of Addis Ababa when the Italians invaded Ethiopia in 1936.

==Life as an &quot;Arbegna&quot;==
&quot;Balambaras&quot; Abebe remained in the capital after the departure of Emperor Haile Selassie, but departing for the northeast with ten men before the Italians occupied the capital. He took part in the unsuccessful attempt to retake the capital in July of that year, and his soldiers almost reached the Imperial Palace before being beaten back by two Italian battalions.

After this action, Abebe&#x27;s activities are hard to follow due to contradictory evidence. This is due in large part to the reticence of the survivors in their memoirs about individuals and events: when Emperor Haile Selassie proclaimed a general amnesty upon his restoration, as Thomas L. Kane explains, &quot;many of those who served the Italians loyally right up to the last minute took advantage of this proclamation to escape punishment, and ... [often achieved] positions of power... In order to avoid offending one of these figures, or even the loyal relatives of some collaborator, the name of a principal in some incident will be deliberately omitted, though some reason such as &#x27;this would be a humiliation for Ethiopia&#x27; may be given.&quot;

According to Anthony Mockler, by the spring of 1937 year Abebe was left with only 40 men, forcing him to limit his activities to the mountainous region of Menz. However, Thomas Kane writes that after Lij Haile Maryam Mammo&#x27;s victory at Morit on 21 April 1937, Abebe and Fitawrari Zawdu Abba Koran took control of Morat and Geru, then on 25 July the three joined with Blatta Tekle Walde-Hawaryat and Major Mesfin Sleshi for an attack on Addis Alem; however they encountered the enemy far to the east of their intended target, and increasing enemy forces and aerial bombardments forced them to withdraw to Menz 1 September. Returning to Mockler&#x27;s narrative, in May 1937 Abebe ventured out of Menz to proclaim Meleke Tsahai, the 16-year-old son of the late Lij Iyasu emperor at the Three Ambas, alarming the Italian occupiers. (Kane does agree with Mockler that Abebe did cooperate with Meleke Tsahai, meeting with him 27 November.) On 1 June, General Ugo Cavallero moved north to surround Abebe, and keep him from returning to Menz, and although Abebe made three unsuccessful attempts to break through the Italian lines before the rainy season, after the rains his &quot;Arbegnoch&quot; were able to return to the comparative safety of Menz.

Although Meleke Tsahai died not long afterwards of illness, Abebe remained at large, and following the death of Olana Dingili (1939), became the leading rebel leader – although one not entirely trusted by the exiled Emperor Haile Selassie. Abebe presented himself to the Italians as ambivalent about his role as an &quot;Arbegna&quot;, always seeming to be at the point of submitting to the occupiers in return for money, arms, honors or power, yet always changing his mind at the last moment. &quot;In negotiations he conducted with General Nasi, then deputy viceroy and governor of Shewa, Abebe gave intimations of his readiness to surrender. Simultaneously, he wrote to other patriotic leaders explaining the actual reason for engaging in the talks: to buy time. After he had made sure that his forces had sufficiently recovered from the reverses they had suffered in the preceding months, he broke off negotiations, using as a pretext the killing by the Italians of patriots in another locality.&quot; The Italians continued these talks, obsessed with the hope of recruiting the best-known resistance fighter to their side, until 15 March 1940, when General Nasi learned that Abebe Aregai, who had promised to take the oath of allegiance if the General would make a visit to his location in person, was laying an ambush for him with 20,000 men.

It was not until Emperor Haile Selassie returned to Ethiopia that he was let in on the secret. As the Emperor entered Addis Ababa with his entourage, the streets were lined with Abebe&#x27;s men, cheering their returning Emperor. Abebe presented himself and his son to the Emperor, and Mockler reports that the Arbegna told Emperor Haile Selassie, bowing low before him, &quot;I am your loyal subject. I never submitted to the enemy. I never hoped to see you alive again and I am grateful to God for this day, when I have seen the sun shine.&quot; Before and during the war, the black diaspora worldwide, particularly African-Americans, were engaged in some of the oldest recorded black solidarity protests, most notably in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City where some even organized volunteer registrations to go overseas and fight for Ethiopia. Washington Post report noted that this was due to Ethiopia&#x27;s reputation as the only independent African nation being an inspiration for independence movements and black pride in the Americas.

== Later career ==
Now &quot;Ras&quot;, Abebe Aregai proved to be a valuable retainer to the Emperor. One of the few &quot;Arbegnoch&quot; to receive a major government post, &quot;Ras&quot; Abebe was appointed governor of Addis Ababa and Minister of War in 1941 soon after Haile Selassie&#x27;s return. He was subsequently made governor of Sidamo province from 1941 to 1942. When the Woyane rebellion broke out in Tigray in 1942, with the rebels under Fitawrari Yeebio Weldai of Enderta known popularly as &quot;Wedi Weldai&quot; at one point capturing Mek&#x27;ele, &quot;Ras&quot; Abebe marched north to suppress the violence with the help of British air power, and captured the rebel headquarters at Wukro on 17 October 1943. The Emperor subsequently made him governor of Tigray, and Ras Abebe brutally pacified the province. After serving as governor, &quot;Ras&quot; Abebe once again served as Minister of War (1947–1949), Minister of the Interior (1949–1955), and Minister of Defence before becoming prime minister.
By the late 1950s, he had become the leader of one of the major factions that vied for the Emperor&#x27;s favor; the others were led by potentiates who included Mekonnen Habte-Wold (brother of Aklilu Habte-Wold), &quot;Ras&quot; Andargachew Masai and General Mulugeta Bulli.

== Coup and assassination ==
Brothers Mengistu Neway and Germame, supported by the Imperial Bodyguard and the government security force, seized control of the capital on 13 December 1960. &quot;Ras&quot; Abebe was taken hostage along with others. The rest of the military, however, remained loyal to the Emperor, and rushed to Addis Ababa and crushed the coup. Many of the hostages, including Ras Abebe, were killed by machine-gun fire as the army stormed the Genetta Leul palace on 17 December. Although the leaders of the coup had fled, most of them did not outlive the &quot;Ras&quot; by more than a week.

<doc id="1203256" wikidata="Q5132478" url="?curid=1203256" title="Client-side prediction">
<text>Client-side prediction is a network programming technique used in video games intended to conceal negative effects of high latency connections. The technique attempts to make the player&#x27;s input feel more instantaneous while governing the player&#x27;s actions on a remote server.

The process of client-side prediction refers to having the client locally react to user input before the server has acknowledged the input and updated the game state. So, instead of the client only sending control input to the server and waiting for an updated game state in return, the client also, in parallel with this, predicts the game state locally, and gives the user feedback without awaiting an updated game state from the server.

Client-side prediction reduces latency problems, since there no longer will be a delay between input and client-side visual feedback due to network ping times. However, it also introduces a desynchronization of the client and server game states, which needs to be handled to keep the game playable. Usually, the desync is corrected when the client receives the updated game state, but as instantaneous correction would lead to &quot;snapping&quot;, there are usually some &quot;smoothing&quot; algorithms involved. For example, one common smoothing algorithm would be to check each visible object&#x27;s client-side location to see if it is within some error epsilon of its server-side location. If not, the client-side&#x27;s information is updated to the server-side directly (snapped because of too much desynchronization). However, if the client-side location is not too far, a new position between the client-side and server-side is interpolated; this position is set to be within some small step delta from the client-side location, which is generally judged to be &quot;small enough&quot; to be unintrusive to the user.

Another solution to the desynchronization issue, commonly used in conjunction with client-side prediction, is called &quot;server reconciliation&quot;. The client includes a sequence number in every input sent to the server, and keeps a local copy. When the server sends an authoritative update to a client, it includes the sequence number of the last processed input for that client. The client accepts the new state, and reapplies the inputs not yet processed by the server, completely eliminating visible desynchronization issues in most cases.

The earliest known first-person shooter to use client-side prediction is Duke Nukem 3D, which had it built-in since the January 29, 1996 shareware release. The technique was also a prominent feature of &quot;QuakeWorld&quot;, the popular add-on to &quot;Quake&quot;. While network play was included in the original &quot;Quake&quot; game, it was optimized mainly for LAN play. Having had high-speed home connections (a rarity at the time), &quot;Quake&quot;&#x27;s designers overlooked their assumptions of high bandwidth and low ping times that made playing online frustrating for dial-up users. After a series of experiments in a long private beta, id Software released &quot;QuakeWorld&quot; with a new predictive model that proved popular with both high and low latency players.

<doc id="1203258" wikidata="Q1847562" url="?curid=1203258" title="National routes in South Africa">
<text>National routes in South Africa are a class of trunk roads and freeways which connect major cities. They form the highest category in the South African route numbering scheme, and are designated with route numbers beginning with &quot;N&quot;, from N1 to N18. Most segments of the national route network are officially proclaimed National Roads that are maintained by the South African National Roads Agency (SANRAL), but some segments are maintained by provincial or local road authorities.

The system was mostly built during the 1970s by the National Party government of South Africa, although construction of new roads and repairs of existing stretches continue today. The system was modeled on the United States Interstate Highway network, an idea first brought into effect by US President Dwight D. Eisenhower during the 1950s, based on the German Autobahn, which he experienced when touring Germany after the Second World War.

Although the terms &quot;National Road&quot; and &quot;National Route&quot; are sometimes regarded as synonymous, they have distinct meanings, and not all national routes are National Roads, while some &quot;R&quot;-numbered routes are proclaimed National Roads.

==Definition==
National routes are defined and numbered by the Route Numbering and Road Traffic Signs Sub Committee within the Roads Co-ordinating Body, an organisation which contains representatives from road authorities in national, provincial and local government. The term &quot;national road&quot; is frequently used to refer to a national route, but technically a &quot;national road&quot; is any road maintained by the South African National Roads Agency (SANRAL) and need not necessarily form part of a national route, and there are &quot;R&quot; routes that are proclaimed National Roads. There are also road segments of the national route network that are maintained by provincial or local authorities rather than SANRAL, and are thus not National Roads.
==Table of routes==
National Routes are denoted with the letter N followed by a number indicating the specific route. On maps and some signage, national routes are shown by a pentagon with the number of the road inside. There are fifteen declared national routes, which are listed below.






== Earlier scheme ==

An earlier scheme, deviating considerably from the current numbering, is described in the 1970 Shell Road Atlas of South Africa and other contemporaneous sources:
*N1 - equivalent to the current N9 from George to Colesberg, and then the current N1 from there to Beitbridge (with deviations as some newer parts had yet to be built)
*N2 - equivalent to the section of the current N2 from Cape Town to Durban
*N3 - equivalent to the current N3 from Durban to Ladysmith, then following the current N11 to Volksrust, and the current R23 from there to Heidelberg, and then continuing equivalent to the N3 until its end in Johannesburg
*N4 - equivalent to the section of the current N4 from Pretoria to Komatipoort
*N5 - equivalent to the current N5 but from Winburg past Harrismith to Ladysmith (the latter part now signed as the N3)
*N6 - equivalent to the current N6, except that it begins from King William&#x27;s Town, the section from there to Stutterheim now being the R346, and ending in Reddersburg.
*N7 - equivalent to the section of the current N10 from Ncanaha to just past Middelburg
*N8 - equivalent to the section of the current R64 from Kimberley to Bloemfontein
*N9 - equivalent to the section of the current N1 from Cape Town to Colesberg
*N10 - equivalent to the section of the current R56 between Kokstad and Pietermaritzburg
*N11 - equivalent to the current N7 from Cape Town to the Namibia border
*N12 - equivalent to the section of the current N12 from George to Beaufort West
*N13 - equivalent to the section of the current N12 from Three Sisters to Johannesburg
*N14 - equivalent to the section of the current N2 from Durban to Eswatini
*N15 - equivalent to the section of the current R75 from Port Elizabeth to Uitenhage
*N16 - equivalent to the section of the current N3 between Heidelberg and Harrismith
*N17 - equivalent to the section of the current N10 between Noupoort and Namibia
*N18 - equivalent to the section of the current R61 from Queenstown to Port St. Johns
*N19 - equivalent to the section of the current R56 from south of Jamestown to Kokstad

<text>USS &quot;Macabi&quot; (SS-375) was a of the United States Navy, named for the macabi, a bonefish (&quot;Albula vulpes&quot;) living in tropical seas and off the American coasts as far north as San Diego and Long Island and reaching a length of .

== USS &quot;Macabi&quot; (SS-375) ==
&quot;Macabi&quot; was laid down 1 May 1944 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin; launched 19 September 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Arthur S. Carpender, wife of Rear Admiral Carpender; and commissioned 29 March 1945.

Following trials on Lake Michigan, &quot;Macabi&quot;, on 19 April 1945, entered a floating drydock at Lockport, Ill., to transit the Chicago Canal to the Mississippi River, and arrived New Orleans 26 April `1945. Three days later she left for shakedown operations off Panama.

On 3 June 1945 &quot;Macabi&quot; departed Balboa, Canal Zone, for final training at Pearl Harbor before departing 9 July 1945 for the Caroline Islands via Guam, Marianas. She went on lifeguard station off Truk on arriving 21 July 1945. Some 10 days later &quot;Macabi&quot; was forced to dive to avoid two aerial bombs off Moen Island.

She returned to Apra Harbor, Guam, for repairs 4 August through 13 August 1945; and was on her way back to Truk when hostilities with Japan were terminated. &quot;Macabi&quot; was then ordered home, touching Pearl Harbor 27 to 29 August 1945 on the way. Arriving San Francisco 5 September 1945, she entered Mare Island Navy Yard 12 December 1945 for inactivation overhaul and decommissioned 16 June 1946.

== ARA &quot;Santa Fe&quot; (S-11) ==
On 1 April 1960 the US Navy and the Argentine Navy signed an agreement to transfer two submarines, &quot;Macabi&quot; and . &quot;Macabi&quot; was loaned to Argentina under the Military Assistance Program on 11 August 1960 and renamed ARA &quot;Santa Fe&quot; (S-11), while &quot;Lamprey&quot; was renamed ARA &quot;Santiago del Estero&quot; (S-12). The commander of &quot;Santa Fe&quot; was Capitán de Corbeta Julio A. Aureggi. The submarines left San Francisco on 23 September 1960, arriving at Mar del Plata Naval Base on 30 November of the same year. &quot;Santa Fe&quot; was struck from the US Naval Register, and sold outright to Argentina on 1 September 1971; after being employed as a training boat, she was decommissioned by the Argentine Navy and broken up for spare parts in 1974.

<text>The United States Naval Institute (USNI) is a private non-profit military association that offers independent, nonpartisan forums for debate of national security issues. In addition to publishing magazines and books, the Naval Institute holds several annual conferences. The Naval Institute is based in Annapolis, Maryland.

Established in 1873, the Naval Institute claimed &quot;almost 50,000 members&quot; in 2020, mostly active and retired personnel of the United States Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. The organization also has members in over 90 countries.

The organization has no official or funding ties to the United States Naval Academy or the U.S. Navy, though it is based on the grounds of the Naval Academy through permission granted by a 1936 Act of Congress.

==History==
The U.S. Naval Institute was formed on October 9, 1873 by fifteen naval officers gathered at the U.S. Naval Academy&#x27;s Department of Physics and Chemistry building in Annapolis to discuss, among other topics, the implications of a smaller post-Civil War Navy. Rear Admiral John L. Worden, former commander of the USS &quot;Monitor&quot;, served as the first president.

In 1874, the Naval Institute began to accept papers and publish the proceedings of its discussions, which were distributed to the organization&#x27;s members. In 1898, the Naval Institute Press was created to publish basic naval guides. The most popular of these, &quot;The Bluejacket&#x27;s Manual&quot;, is on its 26th edition, and is still issued to all enlistees of the U.S. Navy. The press eventually expanded to publish more general-interest titles in history, biography, and current affairs.

In 1992, the Naval Institute Foundation, Inc., was established to stabilize the organization&#x27;s funding.

In 1999, the Naval Institute transferred its former headquarters, Preble Hall, to the Naval Academy, and renovated a derelict Navy hospital to serve as its new headquarters. The new building was named Beach Hall, after Captain Edward L. Beach Jr., author and Navy Cross recipient; and his father, Captain Edward L. Beach Sr., who had served as the institute&#x27;s secretary-treasurer.

On 30 September 2021, the U.S. Naval Institute opened a conference center with a 406-seat auditorium, reception spaces, an indoor/outdoor rooftop terrace, five meeting rooms, and a broadcast studio. It is named for Jack C. Taylor, a decorated World War II U.S. Navy fighter pilot who founded Enterprise Rent-A-Car.

==Publications and products==

===&quot;Proceedings&quot;===
&quot;Proceedings&quot; is the Naval Institute&#x27;s monthly magazine. Published since 1874, it is one of the oldest continuously published magazines in the United States. Issues include articles from military professionals and civilian experts, historical essays, book reviews, full-color photography, and reader commentary. Roughly a third are written by active duty and active reserve personnel, a third by retired military, and a third by civilians. &quot;Proceedings&quot; also frequently carries feature articles by Secretaries of Defense, Secretaries of the Navy, Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and top leaders of the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard. The magazine has published controversial articles on contentious issues; moreover, military officials have been known to block certain articles from being submitted to the journal. For example, in 1962, the Department of Defense blocked a Marine Corps lieutenant colonel from submitting an article to &quot;Proceedings&quot; about a 1949 proposal to merge the Marines&#x27; aviation units into the Air Force.

===&quot;Naval History&quot;===
&quot;Naval History&quot; is the Naval Institute&#x27;s bimonthly magazine. First published in 1987, its articles detail the role of sea power in U.S. history. The magazine&#x27;s contributors have included historians David McCullough and James M. McPherson; former sailors, Marines and Coast Guardsmen such as Ernest Borgnine, Gene Hackman, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.; and journalists, including Walter Cronkite and Tom Brokaw.

===Naval Institute Press===
The Naval Institute Press was founded in 1898 and publishes about 80 books a year. Its twice-yearly catalog includes works on history, biography, professional military education, and occasional works of popular fiction, such as Tom Clancy&#x27;s first novel, &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; and Stephen Coonts&#x27; &quot;Flight of the Intruder&quot;. Its professional titles include &quot;The Bluejacket&#x27;s Manual&quot;, &quot;Naval Shiphandling&quot;, &quot;The Naval Officer&#x27;s Guide&quot;, &quot;The Marine Officer’s Guide&quot;, and &quot;The Coast Guardsman’s Manual&quot;. &quot;The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World&quot; and &quot;The Naval Institute Guide to Ships and Aircraft of the U.S. Fleet&quot; are popular reference books with the military, the media, and maritime enthusiasts.

===USNI News===
USNI News is the Naval Institute&#x27;s news service. Founded in 2012, USNI News operates from Monday to Friday and primarily focuses on defense-related topics. USNI News heavily covered the Fat Leonard scandal as it developed.

===&quot;Americans at War&quot;===
In 2007, USNI produced &quot;Americans At War&quot;, a series of video interviews with U.S. combat veterans of conflicts dating to World War I. Former President George H. W. Bush, Senators Bob Dole, Daniel Inouye, Bob Kerrey, and others described how combat changed their lives. The series was broadcast on PBS television stations nationwide.

==Archives==

===Photographs===
The U.S. Naval Institute holds more than 450,000 images of people, ships and aircraft from all branches of the armed forces. The photographs date from the American Civil War to the present.

===Oral histories===
The U.S. Naval Institute&#x27;s oral history program preserves the reminiscences of numerous American military figures, including USAAF General Jimmy Doolittle, Admirals Arleigh Burke and Chester W. Nimitz. The Naval Institute records a series of interviews covering the life story of each participant. The interviews are then transcribed, annotated, indexed, and bound. Since the inception of the program in 1969, more than 230 bound volumes have been completed, and interviews have been recorded to produce dozens more.

==Notable members==
The institute&#x27;s notable current and former members include:

* Clarence Wade McClusky, Jr, U.S. Navy rear admiral
* Thomas Edison, inventor and businessman
* William Halsey Jr., U.S. Navy fleet admiral
* John Lehman, former Secretary of the Navy

<text>Sitre (&quot;Daughter of Re&quot;) or Tia-Sitre, was the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh Ramesses I of Egypt and mother of Seti I.

==Biography==
There is some debate around the identity of Ramesses&#x27; wife and Seti&#x27;s mother. Sitre is shown together with Ramesses I and Seti in Seti&#x27;s Abydos temple where she is called the King&#x27;s Mother. She is called the King&#x27;s Great Wife both in Seti&#x27;s temple and in Seti&#x27;s tomb (where one would expect her to be mentioned as King&#x27;s Mother). However, Sitre&#x27;s tomb, which can stylistically be dated to this period, mentions its owner as a King&#x27;s Mother.

The Year 400 Stela, found in Tanis and dated to the reign of Sitre&#x27;s grandson Ramesses II describes Seti as the son of Paramessu (the name of Ramesses I before he became pharaoh) and Tia. Also, Seti&#x27;s daughter was named Tia. It can be assumed that Tia and Sitre are the same person and that she altered her name when her husband became pharaoh, just like he changed his name from Paramessu to Ramesses. The fact that one of the daughters of Ramesses II was named Tia-Sitre makes it even more likely.

The absence of the title &quot;King&#x27;s Daughter&quot; for her indicates that Sitre was of non-royal descent. She did hold a large number of titles. She was a Hereditary Princess (iryt-p`t), a Great King’s Mother (mwt-niswt-wrt), also described as a God’s Mother (mwt-ntr). Her queenly titles included Lady of The Two Lands (nbt-t3wy), King’s Wife (hmt-nisw), Great King’s Wife, his beloved (hmt-niswt-wrt meryt.f) and Mistress of Upper and Lower Egypt (hnwt-Shm’w-mhw). She also held the title of God’s Wife (hmt-ntr).

==Tomb QV38==

She was buried in a tomb in the Valley of the Queens QV38. The tomb was already described by Karl Richard Lepsius (tomb 13) and John Gardner Wilkinson (tomb 19) The tomb may have been commissioned by her son Seti I. This would be the reason she is called a King&#x27;s mother in her tomb. The decoration was unfinished, consisting of just line drawings.

In Porter and Moss a description is given of the scenes outlined in the tomb. The decorations include images of Imsety, Duamutef, Anubis, Maat, Ir-renef-djesef, Nephthys, Serket, a monkey and two baboons in kiosk. Queen Sitre is further shown seated before a naos. Another scene shows a Lion-headed god, followed by Maat. Further scenes include a kiosk containing a cat-headed god and Anubis, Hapi, Qebehsenuef, Horus-Irbakef, Thoth, Isis, Neith, Horus, and a kiosk containing Mut as vulture, a bird-headed god, and full-face god. Two boats are shown, with three gods below.

<text>The Wind from Nowhere is a science fiction novel by English author J. G. Ballard. Published in 1962, it was his debut novel. He had previously published only short stories.

The novel was the first of a series of Ballard novels dealing with scenarios of natural disaster. Here, civilization is reduced to ruins by prolonged worldwide hurricane-force winds.

As an added dimension, Ballard explores the ways in which disaster and tragedy can bond people together in ways that no normal experiences ever could. That is another recurring theme in his works and makes one of its first appearances here. Some critics have suggested that his first four novels are based on elemental themes, showing global destruction by air, water, fire and earth.

Ballard later dismissed the novel, written in ten days, as a &quot;piece of hackwork&quot;, referring instead to &quot;The Drowned World&quot; as his first real novel.

==Plot summary==
A wind blows worldwide: it is constantly westward and strongest at the equator. The wind is gradually increasing, and at the beginning of the story, the force of the wind is making air travel impossible. Later, people are living in tunnels and basements, unable to go above ground. Near the end, &quot;The air stream carried with it enormous quantities of water vapour — in some cases the contents of entire seas, such as the Caspian and the Great Lakes, which had been drained dry, their beds plainly visible.&quot;

In London, to cope with the situation, special organizations are set up. The &quot;Central Operations Executive&quot; (COE), staffed mainly by War Office personnel, has been set up by Simon Marshall.

&quot;Combined Rescue Operations&quot; deal with collapsing buildings. Donald Maitland, a doctor unable to travel to a new job in Canada because of the wind, is part of it. Maitland rescues Marshall when he is injured by falling masonry and takes him home to recover. In the basement of Marshall&#x27;s home, Maitland sees military equipment labelled &quot;Hardoon Tower&quot; and wonders whose interests Marshall is really serving.

Hardoon Tower is a pyramid-like structure intended to withstand the wind; it is being built by Hardoon, a millionaire businessman, who has a private army.

Maitland&#x27;s relationship with his wife Susan is ending, but when he hears that she is still in their apartment on an upper floor, while most people are underground, he goes there. Susan will not be persuaded to leave, and standing by an open window, she is carried away by the wind.

As the destruction increases in London, COE decides to abandon its underground base. One of Hardoon&#x27;s officers, a helmeted, taciturn figure called Kroll, arrives. Marshall thinks he is there to take him to Hardoon Tower, but Kroll kills him.

Maitland is evacuated from the underground base along with Steve Lanyon, an American submarine captain, and Patricia Olsen, a journalist. Lanyon and Olsen have developed a relationship during recent experiences in Italy. They are in a group that leaves in a giant armoured vehicle with a periscope. Maitland, realizing they are passing close to Hardoon Tower and wanting to investigate it, sabotages the navigation equipment so that the vehicle goes to the tower, which they can locate by a radio signal.

Hardoon receives the group to his complex so that Olsen and another journalist can report his success in withstanding the wind. With winds now over 550 mph the ground underneath the complex begins eroding into a giant ravine. The group flee to the pyramid for safety, however it too starts to sag into the ravine below. Hardoon, gazing at the wind through a special window, refuses to leave the pyramid as it is collapsing. Maitland and the others escape from the pyramid as it finally falls and try to retreat to the bunkers below, but are trapped on a ledge. They contemplate jumping into the ravine below in a desperate attempt to escape the wind, but stop as they realize that the wind is starting to subside.

<text>Mimir is a joint music project started by The Legendary Pink Dots member Edward Ka-Spel and the father of numerous other projects Christoph Heemann. On &quot;Mimyriad&quot; they were joined by musician and producer Jim O&#x27;Rourke, making them something of a left field supergroup. Having similar interests in musical experimentation, specifically in textural music, the two started recording in Heemann&#x27;s studio. In 1991 their first, self-titled, album came out on the Flabbergast label. Two of the following albums the group members consider to be more successful in accomplishing the initial goal of making texture-based music. The first two albums have been reissued in remixed/reworked versions on the Streamline label in 2007.

<doc id="1203271" wikidata="Q709317" url="?curid=1203271" title="James Wong Jim">
<text>James Wong Jim (; 18 March 1941 – 24 November 2004, also known as &quot;霑叔&quot; or &quot;Uncle Jim&quot;) was a Cantopop lyricist and songwriter based primarily in Hong Kong. Beginning from the 1960s, he was the lyricist for over 2,000 songs, collaborating with songwriter Joseph Koo ( Koo Kar-Fai) on many popular television theme songs, many of which have become classics of the genre. His work propelled Cantopop to unprecedented popularity.

He was also well known in Asia as a columnist, actor, film director, screenwriter, and talk show host. He took part in creative directing positions within the entertainment industry in Hong Kong.

Wong died on 24 November 2004 of lung cancer after a four-year battle at the age of 63.

==Early life and education==
Wong was born Wong Jum-sum () in Panyu, in what now is part of Guangzhou, China. He migrated to Hong Kong with his family in 1949.

He completed his secondary education at La Salle College. In 1963, he graduated from the Chinese Department, Faculty of Arts of the University of Hong Kong. Wong received an MPhil degree from the University of Hong Kong in 1983 for his study in Cantonese opera. In May 2003, in the midst of his fight with lung cancer, he obtained a PhD degree from the Department of Sociology, University of Hong Kong. The title of his thesis was &quot;The Rise and Decline of Cantopop : A Study of Hong Kong Popular Music (1949–1997)&quot;.

==Career and contributions==

Wong participated in a variety of media fields including advertising, movies and music. Nicknamed a &quot;genius&quot; () for his prodigious abilities, he was best known for his achievements as a lyricist of Cantonese songs in Hong Kong. Beginning from the 1960s, he was the lyricist for over 2,000 songs, collaborating with composer Joseph Koo (a.k.a. Gu Gaa-fai) on many popular TVB TV drama theme songs, many of which have become classics of the genre. His works pushed the development of Cantopop to unprecedented popularity.

While well known and praised for his creative works in the entertainment and advertisement fields, Wong was also famous for his vulgar and indelicate jokes. He had a series of best-selling joke books. He was regarded as responsible for breaking the barrier to many cultural taboos in Hong Kong during the conservative environment in the 1970s. He is best remembered as the person who came up with the slogan &quot;Two kids are good enough&quot; for The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong.

Wong hosted several TV programs, mostly interviews or talk shows oriented towards adults, on both TVB and ATV. One of the talk shows called &quot;Off-guard Tonight&quot; (今夜不設防), co-hosted by Wong and his close friends Chua Lam and Ni Kuang on ATV, is particularly remembered.

As a singer, he is a tenor with 2.5 octaves in chest voice due to him being a heavy smoker. Due to his narrow vocal range, he only released one album despite being a keen singer.

In the 1990s, Wong&#x27;s creative works became less popular, and many entertainment companies featured fewer of Wong&#x27;s songs. Some TV shows hosted by Wong were also unpopular. Wong decided to return to Hong Kong University to get a doctorate degree in Hong Kong popular culture. His dissertation essay is now in the library of Hong Kong University.

On 24 November 2004, Wong died at the Union Hospital in Hong Kong. His funeral was a low-key family funeral as per his wishes. Hong Kong citizens reflected on his career and accomplishments during this time. In the following days, the news of his death became the primary media headline in Hong Kong, and his compositions were played throughout the week. A remembrance ceremony took place at Hong Kong Stadium, with over 15,000 attending this ceremony.

== Personal life ==
Wong was officially married twice, but had three notable relationships. He had three children with his first wife, singer Wah Wa. Their sons were Wong Yue-hon (黃宇瀚) and Wong Yue-man (黃宇文). Their marriage ended while Hua Wa was pregnant with their only daughter, Ursule Wong (黃宇詩).

Wong once said the most important love of his life was Eunice Lam, a writer whom he lived with from 1976 to 1990, but did not marry. Lam was also a radio host, and was the sister of Richard Lam, a Cantopop lyricist. Lam died from cancer in 2018.

Wong&#x27;s second marriage was to his long-time assistant, Winnie Chan, until his death, but she was never seen with him in public.

<doc id="1203275" wikidata="Q590935" url="?curid=1203275" title="Makonnen Endelkachew">
<text>&quot;Ras Betwoded&quot; Mekonnen Endelkachew (Amharic: መኮንን እንዳልካቸው; 16 February 1890 – 27 February 1963) was an Ethiopian aristocrat and Prime Minister under Emperor Haile Selassie. Mekonnen was born in Addisge, the nephew of the noted Shewan general and politician &quot;Ras Betwoded&quot; Tessema Nadew, who introduced him to Emperor Menelik II. He was a member of the alpha class of the Menelik II School in Addis Ababa when it opened in 1908.

He was a published author, having written a novel, &quot;Yayne Abäba&quot;, and a booklet on the Second Italo-Abyssinian War and Fascist atrocities.

== Life ==
He was married twice. His second marriage, to the Emperor&#x27;s niece, Princess Yeshashework Yilma, followed Makonnen&#x27;s affair with the woman, who was married to the Tigrayan noble &quot;Ras&quot; Gugsa Araya Selassie at time. The affair threatened to destroy the accord Emperor Haile Selassie had carefully crafted, and led to Makonnen&#x27;s recall from his post as Minister to Great Britain in 1932. Princess Yeshashwork was married to Bitwoded Makonnen Demissew after the death of her first husband, and would not marry Makonnen Endalkachew until after she was widowed for a second time during the Italian occupation, and her return from exile in 1941.

Makonnen accompanied Haile Selassie during his tour of Europe from 16 April to 4 September 1924. Following his recall from London, he served as Minister of the Interior, then governor of Illubabor Province; while governor, he led the troops of that province against the Italian invasion on the Ogaden front, afterwards going into exile from 1936 to 1941 in Jerusalem, and accompanying the Emperor back into Ethiopia upon the liberation of the country. Emperor Haile Selassie appointed him Minister of the Interior in March 1941, as part of the cabinet Haile Selassie established to re-assert Ethiopia&#x27;s existence as an independent state against the views of the British War Office that, since Ethiopia had previously been Italian territory, the Emperor &quot;cannot fully reassume his status and powers as Emperor until a peace treaty has been signed with Italy&quot;. However, as John Spencer points out, Ethiopia was able to rely on the principle of postliminium—that is, once enemy occupation is terminated, a state may act as if its existence had survived without interruption. &quot;Having withdrawn its recognition of the Italian conquest,&quot; Spencer points out, &quot;Britain was in no position to contest Ethiopia&#x27;s application of the doctrine of postliminium.&quot; The conflict between Ethiopia and the United Kingdom over the former&#x27;s sovereignty dominated their relations for the next several years.

From 29 January 1943, when the Emperor created the position, Makonnen served as Ethiopia&#x27;s first Prime Minister, until his retirement on 1 November 1957. Bahre Zewde notes, however, that Makonnen &quot;was a mere ceremonial figure, given more to intellectual pursuits than to political machinations. The &quot;de facto&quot; prime minister [during Makonnen&#x27;s tenure] was &quot;Tsahafe T&#x27;ezaz&quot; Walda-Giyorgis Walda-Yohannes.&quot; Spencer notes that his fellow ministers considered him &quot;as a lightweight.&quot; Makonnen then became the president of Ethiopian Senate from 1957 to 1961.

Although Makonnen led the delegation that represented Ethiopia at the summit in San Francisco that created the United Nations, because he was not fluent in either French or English he took no part in the debates.

==Development==
Probe 2000 was North American Phillips attempt to broaden their reach in the video game market. They had previously released the Odyssey series of consoles and the Odyssey² was their current system. They created the Probe 2000 brand in order to publish titles for competitors systems.

While four titles are known to have been completed only War Room was released. Harris, the programmer of War Room, also programed games for Phillips&#x27; Odyssey²; Nimble Numbers Ned and Killer Bees!

==Reception==

<doc id="1203287" wikidata="Q1180183" url="?curid=1203287" title="Mutant Massacre">
<text>&quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; was a 1986 Marvel Comics crossover storyline. It primarily involved the superhero teams the X-Men and X-Factor. The solo hero Thor, the New Mutants, Power Pack, and Daredevil crossed over for an issue each in their own comic books.

The crossover was a surprise success, yielding sales boosts to the mutant-based books and prompting Marvel Comics&#x27; long-running policy of holding such mutant crossovers annually.

The story depicts a massacre of the Morlocks during an attack by the Marauders. The X-Men, X-Factor, and Power Pack attempt to intervene, with the X-Men having three of their members injured in the conflict.

==Plot==
The mysterious Marauders attack a mutant named Tommy and her Hellfire Club boyfriend in Los Angeles for the purpose of following her back to New York and finding the location of the underground mutant community known as the Morlocks. The Marauders kill Tommy and hundreds of Morlocks before the X-Men and X-Factor teams arrive separately and fight them, avoiding the total slaughter of the Morlocks. The two teams however do not meet during the battle and suffer crippling losses: X-Factor&#x27;s Angel is crucified by the Marauders, while the X-Men&#x27;s Colossus, Shadowcat, and Nightcrawler are all severely wounded. X-Factor&#x27;s casualties are less due to the arrival of Power Pack and Thor, who help save the horribly wounded Angel and the rest of X-Factor from suffering any additional harm.

Thor uses his powers to cleanse the dead from the Morlock tunnels with fire, which causes problems for the X-Men, who briefly believe that the firestorm was caused by the Marauders and believe that the New Mutants died in said fire. Several Morlocks, including Berzerker and Masque, make their way into the surface world and begin to work for their personal aims.

Meanwhile, Wolverine saves the Power Pack and Healer from the Marauder Sabretooth. After their clash, Sabretooth follows Logan home to the X-Mansion. He destroys Cerebro, but is kept from hurting the other Morlocks when Psylocke engages Sabretooth in battle. Wolverine and the rest of the X-Men arrive, and Sabretooth falls off a nearby cliff in order to escape the X-Men, pursued into the water by Wolverine. As the fight continues in the ocean, Psylocke gleans some information about the Marauders from Sabretooth&#x27;s mind.

Daredevil&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Daredevil&quot; #238 is set after the events of the Mutant Massacre. The issue features Daredevil fighting Sabretooth after his escape from the X-Mansion.

===Consequences===

* Angel is pinned to the wall by Harpoon and Blockbuster, causing massive trauma to his wings, which are later amputated following the onset of gangrene. He eventually has his wings replaced by Apocalypse and becomes Archangel while serving as Death of the Horsemen of Apocalypse.
* During the Massacre, Apocalypse also saves Plague from Harpoon and recruits her for his Horsemen of Apocalypse, transforming her into Pestilence.
* Shadowcat becomes trapped in her phased form while protecting Rogue from Harpoon. This results in a molecular deterioration that almost kills her. She is saved at the last minute by Reed Richards and Doctor Doom.
* Wounded by Riptide&#x27;s throwing stars, Colossus is briefly rendered quadriplegic as a result of Magneto using his powers to heal the damage.
* Nightcrawler, already badly injured after a battle with Nimrod, is left comatose after being ambushed by Riptide.
* The Morlock Masque assumes control of the remaining Morlocks. He uses his transformative powers to forcibly disfigure all Morlocks under his rule, an act that causes many Morlocks to go insane.
* Wolverine discovers that Jean Grey is alive after smelling her scent in the tunnels, but keeps the knowledge a secret from the rest of the X-Men.
* After proving her bravery in fighting Sabretooth, Psylocke is officially welcomed as a member of the X-Men.
* It is later revealed that Sinister had the Morlocks killed because they were experimentations of the Dark Beast, a version of McCoy who was Sinister&#x27;s &#x27;student&#x27; in the alternate timeline of the Age of Apocalypse and trapped in the prime reality twenty years in the past. As Sinister recognized his work in the Morlocks, he had them destroyed to keep his secrets out.
* It was also later revealed that Gambit was employed by Mister Sinister to assemble the Marauders. Gambit is temporarily expelled from the X-Men for his part in the massacre.

==Death list==
Here is the list of Morlocks that were killed during the Mutant Massacre and the issue they were killed in:

Hundreds of other Morlocks were killed, but were not identified in the comics. Annalee and Piper were the only established characters among the casualties; the others were all generic characters whose sole purpose was to be victims of the massacre. This aspect of the story was satirized in &quot;What The--?!&quot; #4.

==Background and creation==
Writer Chris Claremont originally conceived the systematic killing of the Morlocks as a storyline that would run in the pages of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;, but &quot;X-Factor&quot; writer Louise Simonson felt that such a big storyline would run overlong in a single title, and suggested that it be done as a crossover between all three mutant titles.

Claremont and Simonson, the chief writers of the crossover, exchanged copies of their typewritten plots and scripts, and extensively discussed the intersecting storylines over the telephone. Asked what it was like to coordinate all the Mutant Massacre-linked stories, Simonson said &quot;It was horrible. I don&#x27;t know why we&#x27;re thinking of doing this again.&quot;

Walt Simonson, who wrote the &quot;Thor&quot; instalments of &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; and pencilled the X-Factor instalments, said: 

==Collected editions==
==In other media==
In &quot;The Gifted&quot; episode &quot;calaMity&quot;, The Purifiers murdering all of the Morlocks in their tunnels was the premise of the &quot;Mutant Massacre&quot; storyline.

<text>&quot;Lij&quot; Endelkachew Makonnen (Amharic: እንዳልካቸው መኮንን; 27 September 1927 – 23 November 1974) was an Ethiopian politician. Born in Addis Ababa, his father, Ras Betwoded Makonnen Endelkachew, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia in the 1950s. Endelkachew Makonnen was a member of the aristocratic Addisge clan that were very influential in the later part of the Ethiopian monarchy. He would be the last Imperial Prime Minister appointed by Emperor Haile Selassie. He was a stepson of Princess Yeshashework Yilma, Emperor Haile Selassie&#x27;s only niece.

== Prime minister ==

The Oxford-educated Endelkachew served as Prime Minister from February 28 to July 22, 1974. During this period, the Imperial government was under assault by protesting students and striking workers who demanded investigation of corruption in the highest levels of government, reforms in land tenure, and political reforms as well. Endalkachew Makonnen attempted to address these demands by presenting reforms that began to change the very nature of the Ethiopian monarchy. The Emperor also agreed to some of these proposals, which included the drafting of a new constitution to replace the one adopted in 1955, and having the Prime Minister be responsible to the elected Lower House of Parliament rather than to the Emperor. &quot;If this latter measure were to go into effect, it would result in a real diminution in the power and authority of the Crown&quot;, remarks Edmund J. Keller.

All of these actions were made to restore order and help reestablish the legitimacy of the regime in the eyes of the general population. However, as Keller notes, this would have been difficult even in the best of times. Although he had support amongst the older, well-connected members of the military, younger radical elements in the armed forces began to work against him from the moment he took office. Some believe this was Endelkachew&#x27;s motivation for seeking alliances with moderate military officers with bases of support, such as Alem Zewde Tessema, the commander of the paratrooper battalion, and who became chair of the Armed Forces Coordinated Committee (AFCC) on 23 March. Two days later, Alem Zewde ordered the arrest of 30 radical airmen at the Ethiopian Air Force base at Debre Zeyit. On 30 April Endelkachew moved to placate his opponents on the left by authorizing the arrest of the former ministers—and his former colleagues—in the Aklilu government for corruption. Despite these efforts, radicalism grew unchecked both in civil society and in the military. Alem Zewde was tainted due to his support for Endelkachew and on 22 June lost control of his own battalion, and fled to Gojjam seeking refuge.

That same month, 12 or 16 members of the AFCC under the leadership of Colonel Atnafu Abate left that body and called for a meeting of representatives from all of the military units in Ethiopia at the headquarters of the Fourth Division, which was convened 28 June. This new committee became what was to be known as the Derg.

==Arrest==
The critical event that doomed Endelkachew&#x27;s administration occurred on 26 June 1974. On that day, a group of conservative members from the Chamber of Deputies petitioned the Emperor for the release of some of the officials that had been imprisoned for corruption. Numerous writers agree with Keller&#x27;s judgement that this act &quot;was seen as a clear indication that ruling politicians had no intention of bringing these individuals to justice&quot;. The new military committee acted swiftly, arresting 50 more alleged culprits from the ruling classes on 30 June. Within the next two weeks 150 more members of the former government, the current government, the provincial administration, the nobility, and the Imperial family (Iskinder Desta, the Emperor&#x27;s grandson) were arrested.

Despite continued attempts to retain power, Prime Minister Endalkachew was arrested on 22 July 1974, and the Derg asked Lij Mikael Imru to assume the Prime Minister&#x27;s office. Over the following months the Derg systematically dismantled the government and numerous public institutions. On 12 September, Emperor Haile Selassie was formally deposed by the Derg, an act Keller describes as &quot;anticlimactic given the events that had unfolded since July&quot;. At last, on 23 November, Lij Endelkachew and 60 ex-officials of the former Emperor&#x27;s government were taken from Menelik Palace and to Alem Bekagn prison where they were summarily executed.

==Previous posts==
Lij Endelkachew had previously served in a variety of diplomatic and political posts. He was Ethiopian Ambassador to Britain, and later Permanent Representative to the United Nations, and was one of the people under consideration for the post of UN Secretary General in 1972, before Kurt Waldheim was appointed. He had also served as Minister for Posts and Communications, and had served as the International President of YMCA.

<text>Yoshio Taniguchi (谷口 吉生, &quot;Taniguchi Yoshio&quot;; 17 October 1937 – 16 December 2024) was a Japanese architect best known for his redesign of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, which was reopened on 20 November 2004. Critics have emphasized Taniguchi&#x27;s fusion of traditional Japanese and Modernist aesthetics. Martin Filler, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised &quot;the luminous physicality and calm aura of Taniguchi&#x27;s buildings,&quot; noting that the architect &quot;sets his work apart by exploiting the traditional Japanese strategies of clarity, understatement, opposition, asymmetry and proportion.&quot; &quot;In an era of glamorously expressionist architecture,&quot; wrote &quot;Time&quot; critic Richard Lacayo, MoMA &quot;has opted for a work of what you might call old-fashioned Modernism, clean-lined and rectilinear, a subtly updated version of the glass-and-steel box that the museum first championed in the 1930s, years before that style was adopted for corporate headquarters everywhere.&quot;

== Biography ==

Taniguchi was the son of architect Yoshirō Taniguchi (1904–1979), who designed the National Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo. Yoshio studied engineering at Keio University, graduating in 1960, after which he studied architecture at Harvard University&#x27;s Graduate School of Design, graduating in 1964. He worked briefly for architect Walter Gropius, who became an important influence.

From 1964 to 1972, Taniguchi worked for the studio of architect Kenzō Tange, perhaps the most important Japanese modernist architect, at Tokyo University. While in the Tange office, Taniguchi also worked on projects in Skopje, Yugoslavia and San Francisco, California (Yerba Buena), living on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley while involved in the latter project. Taniguchi taught architecture at the University of California, Los Angeles, then, in 1975, established his own practice, in Tokyo. Since 1979, he has been president of Taniguchi and Associates.

Among his noteworthy later collaborators are Isamu Noguchi, the American landscape architect Peter Walker, and the artist Gen&#x27;ichirō Inokuma.

Taniguchi is best known for designing a number of Japanese museums, including the Nagano Prefectural Museum of History, the Marugame Genichiro-Inokuma Museum of Contemporary Art, the Toyota Municipal Museum of Art, the D. T. Suzuki Museum (鈴木大拙館, Suzuki Daisetsu Kan) in Kanazawa, and the Gallery of the Hōryū-ji Treasures at the Tokyo National Museum.

In 1997, Taniguchi won a competition to redesign the Museum of Modern Art, beating out nine other internationally renowned architects, including Rem Koolhaas, Bernard Tschumi, and Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron. The MoMA commission was Taniguchi&#x27;s first work outside Japan. Writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Suzanne Muchnic highlighted Taniguchi&#x27;s &quot;ability to create beautiful spaces that function effectively,&quot; in this case enabling museumgoers to find their bearings in a building whose sheer size and labyrinthine galleries and hallways can be disorienting. &quot;The streamlined lobby has entrances at both ends, while the central atrium — or &#x27;light garden,&#x27; as Taniguchi prefers — provides glimpses of upper floors,&quot; she writes. &quot;Off to one side, the garden and a stairway are immediately apparent. On upper floors, bridges connect old and new parts of the building. Glass barriers around the atrium provide dramatic views within the museum. ... &#x27;I wanted to direct people visually, not with signs,&#x27; said Taniguchi, who cut openings in walls to show their thickness and to expose what lies behind them. &#x27;In big European museums it is easy to get lost,&#x27; he said. &#x27;You get tired visually and physically. In this museum, I intentionally created places where people can locate themselves. This is a modern way of thinking — expressing function, not hiding.&#x27;&quot;
Taniguchi designed the Texas Asia Society Center in Houston. This $40 million project is located in the Houston Museum District and is Taniguchi&#x27;s only freestanding new building in the United States.

==Death==
Yoshio Taniguchi died from pneumonia on 16 December 2024, at the age of 87.

<doc id="1203292" wikidata="Q610229" url="?curid=1203292" title="1989 NBA draft">
<text>The [[1989–90 NBA season|1989]] [[NBA draft]] took place on June 27, 1989, in New York City. Despite eight of the top ten picks being considered busts, including the first two picks Pervis Ellison and Danny Ferry, the draft produced many talented players such as Shawn Kemp, Glen Rice, Sean Elliott, Nick Anderson, Dana Barros, Tim Hardaway, Vlade Divac, Clifford Robinson, B. J. Armstrong and Mookie Blaylock.

The draft was reduced from three rounds in the previous year to the two-round format that is still in use to the present day. As a result, NBA drafts from this season until 1995 produced the lowest number of total draft picks selected at 54 overall selections.

This was the first draft for the Minnesota Timberwolves and Orlando Magic, prior to their inaugural season. This was also the first draft televised prime time on U.S. national television.

==Draft selections==



==Notable undrafted players==

These players were not selected in the 1989 draft but played at least one game in the NBA.
==Early entrants==
===College underclassmen===
For the seventh year in a row and the eleventh time in twelve years, no college underclassman would withdraw their entry into the NBA draft. Not only that, but this would be the fourth year in a row where a player that qualified for the status of a &quot;college underclassman&quot; would be playing professional basketball overseas, with the French-born Rudy Bourgarel playing for the Boulogne-Levallois in France after leaving Marist College. In addition to that, this would also be the first year where an international player would be considered a direct underclassman to participate in an NBA draft, with Vlade Divac from the KK Partizan Belgrade of the Eastern Bloc nation known as SFR Yugoslavia (now since separated, with Divac representing Serbia) being the first ever international underclassman to be taken directly from an overseas team without previously going to an American college or playing for any prior American institution. Including those two players and Andrew Gaze, who had previously played in Australia for multiple years before playing only one season at Seton Hall University while being over the age of 22 by that time, the number of underclassmen would officially be considered a grand total of fourteen players instead of eleven (or twelve including Gaze). Regardless, the following college basketball players successfully applied for early draft entrance.
* Nick Anderson – G, Illinois (junior)
* Martin Den Hengst – C, Sheridan (freshman)
* Jay Edwards – G, Indiana (sophomore)
* Andrew Gaze – Seton Hall (freshman)
* Benny Green – G, Tennessee–Chattanooga (junior)
* Shawn Kemp – F, Trinity Valley CC (freshman)
* Toney Mack – G, Georgia (junior)
* J. R. Reid – F, North Carolina (junior)
* Maurice Selvin – G, Puget Sound (sophomore)
* Alex Soyebo – C, Northland Pioneer (freshman)
* Johnny Steptoe – F, Southern (sophomore)
* Richard Whitmore – G, Brown (junior)
===International players===
This would be the first time in NBA history where an international born and raised player would be considered an underclassman in an NBA draft. The following international player successfully applied for early draft entrance.

* Vlade Divac – C, Partizan (Yugoslavia)

===Other eligible players===
This would be the fourth year in a row with at least one player that previously played in college entering the NBA draft as an underclassman. It was also the second year in a row where a player would qualify as an eligible underclassman for the NBA draft while previously playing for a French-based team in order to do so.

<text>George Nelson (29 May 1908 – 5 March 1986) was an American industrial designer. While lead designer for the Herman Miller furniture company, Nelson and his design studio, George Nelson Associates, designed 20th-century modernist furniture. He is considered a founder of American modernist design.

== Early life ==

Nelson was born on May 29, 1908, in Hartford, Connecticut, to Jewish parents Simeon Nelson and Lillian Canterow Nelson. His parents owned a drugstore. Nelson graduated from Hartford Public High School in 1924, and thereafter attended Yale University. He did not originally set out to become an architect; he happened upon the architecture school at Yale, when he ducked into a building during a rainstorm, in order to get out of the rain. Walking through the building, he came upon an exhibit of students&#x27; works entitled &quot;A Cemetery Gateway&quot;.

Nelson met with some early recognition while still an undergraduate, when he was published in &quot;Pencil Points&quot; and magazines. During his final year at Yale, he was hired by the architecture firm Adams and Prentice as a draftsman.

In 1928, he graduated with a degree in architecture. In 1929, Nelson was hired as a Teacher&#x27;s Assistant while pursuing his second bachelor&#x27;s degree at Yale. He received a degree in Fine Arts in 1931.

The next year, while preparing for the Paris Prize competition, he won the Rome Prize, a fellowship that allowed him to study architecture in Rome for two years with a healthy stipend and accommodations in a palace.

While based in Rome, Nelson traveled through Europe where he met a number of the modernist pioneers, whom he interviewed for articles for &quot;Pencil Points&quot; magazine. While being interviewed by Nelson, Mies van der Rohe asked about Frank Lloyd Wright, whom Nelson was embarrassed to say he did not know much about. Years later, however, Nelson would work with Wright on a special issue of &quot;Architectural Forum&quot; which catalyzed Wright&#x27;s comeback from relative obscurity.

While in Rome Nelson married Frances Hollister. A few years later, he returned to the United States to devote himself to writing. Through his articles in &quot;Pencil Points&quot; he introduced the work of Walter Gropius, Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier, and Gio Ponti to North America.

== 1935–1944: Design writing ==
In 1935, Nelson joined &quot;Architectural Forum&quot;, where he was first associate editor (1935–1943), and later consulting editor (1944–1949). There, he defended the modernist principles, arguing against colleagues who, as &quot;industrial designers&quot;, made too many concessions to the commercial forces of the industry.

Nelson believed the work of a designer should be to better the world. In his view, nature was already perfect, but man ruined it by making things that didn&#x27;t follow the rules of nature. &quot;The contemporary architect, cut off from symbols, ornament and meaningful elaborations of structural form, all of which earlier periods processed in abundance, has desperately chased every functional requirement, every change in sight or ornamentation, every technical improvement, to provide some basis for starting his work. Where the limitations were most rigorous, as for example in a factory, or in a skyscraper where every inch had to yield its profit, there the designers were happiest and the results most satisfying but; let a religious belief or a social ideal replace the cubic foot costs or radiation losses, and nothing happened. There is not a single modern church in the entire country that is comparable to a first-rate cafeteria, as far as solving the problem is concerned.&quot; At this point, Nelson&#x27;s career still mainly involved writing for architecture magazines and not actually designing the solutions to modern living that he would later become famous for.
By 1940, Nelson had become known for several innovative concepts. In his post-war book &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s House&quot;, co-authored with Henry Wright, he introduced the concept of the &quot;family room&quot;, and the &quot;storage wall&quot;. The storage wall was a recessed, built-in bookcase or shelving between the empty space of two walls. The concept was developed while writing the section on storage, as neither Nelson nor Wright were able to write enough for their publisher&#x27;s liking. Nelson then posed the question,&quot;What&#x27;s inside the wall?&quot;, and realized that the space between walls was not utilized. The idea was initially published in &quot;Architectural Forum&quot; and then republished in &quot;Life&quot; in 1945. The book was a commercial success and made it onto the &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller list.

== 1945–1954: Herman Miller ==
In 1945, the Herman Miller furniture company was producing mostly conventional, wood-based designs. After reading &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s House&quot; D.J. Depree, the Chairman of Herman Miller, selected Nelson to be the company&#x27;s next Director of Design, despite Nelson having no experience designing furniture. Depree was more interested in Nelson&#x27;s insight into the best way to make furniture innovative and useful. Nelson was offered a contract that allowed him the freedom to work outside of Herman Miller, and to use designs from other architects that Nelson had worked with. He became the Director of Design for Herman Miller in 1947, and held the position until 1972. The first Herman Miller catalog produced by Nelson was released in 1945. Over the following years it would include some of the most iconic home furnishings of the 20th century. Ray and Charles Eames, Harry Bertoia, Richard Schultz, Donald Knorr, and Isamu Noguchi all worked for Herman Miller, under Nelson&#x27;s supervision. Although both Bertoia and Noguchi later expressed regrets about their involvement, it became a successful period for the company, and for George Nelson.

== 1955–1980s: George Nelson Associates, Inc. ==
Using the money he earned as Director of Design for Herman Miller, in 1947 Nelson opened a design studio in New York City. On October 26, 1955, he incorporated it into George Nelson Associates, Inc., and moved to 251 Park Avenue South. The studio was successful in bringing together many of the top designers of the era, who were soon designing for Herman Miller under the George Nelson label. Among the noted designers who worked for George Nelson Associates, Inc. were Irving Harper, George Mulhauser (designer of the Coconut Chair), Robert Brownjohn (designer of the sets for the James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;), Gordon Chadwick, Bill Renwick, Suzanne Sekey, John Svezia, Ernest Farmer, Tobias O&#x27;Mara, Ronald Beckman (designer of the Sling Sofa), George Tscherny, (who designed the Herman Miller advertisements), Dan Lewis, Lance Wyman, and John Pile. With his studio, Nelson enacted new practices for the involvement of design in all aspects of the company, pioneering the practice of corporate image management, graphic programs, and signage. By the time the company closed in the mid-1980s George Nelson Associates, Inc. had worked with most of the Fortune 500 companies. George Nelson&#x27;s architectural projects included what he dubbed &quot;The Colombian Garden of Health&quot;, a 200-bed tertiary care hospital in Bogota, Colombia, commissioned by the Fundacion Santa Fe de Bogota.

In 1959, he remarried to Jacqueline Griffiths. That same year, he served as the lead designer for the American National Exhibition in Moscow.

=== The office cubicle ===

Nelson worked with the Herman Miller Research Corporation during the mid 1960s. It was in close proximity to the University of Michigan campus. The company&#x27;s purpose was to examine changes in the use of office furniture that had taken place during the 20th century, but not the furniture itself. After consulting with experts in psychology, anthropology, and various other fields, Propst created the Action Office I line, which was executed by Nelson&#x27;s studio, and first appeared in Herman Miller&#x27;s 1964 catalog. For designing the Action Office I Nelson was awarded the prestigious Alcoa award. The Action Office I line was not a success, and Nelson was removed from the project. Propst then created the Action Office II, which is better known today as the office cubicle. Despite the &quot;Action Office II&quot; line becoming Herman Miller&#x27;s most successful project, George Nelson disowned himself from any connection with the project. In 1970 he sent a letter to Robert Blaich, who had become Herman Miller&#x27;s Vice-President for Corporate Design and Communication, in which he described the system&#x27;s &quot;dehumanizing effect as a working environment.&quot; He summed up his feeling by saying:
&quot;One does not have to be an especially perceptive critic to realize that AO II is definitely not a system which produces an environment gratifying for people in general. But it is admirable for planners looking for ways of cramming in a maximum number of bodies, for &quot;employees&quot; (as against individuals), for &quot;personnel,&quot; corporate zombies, the walking dead, the silent majority. A large market.&quot;
Scornful as he may have been, Nelson was right that there turned out to be a &quot;larger market&quot; for AO II. By 2005 total sales had reached $5 billion.

== 1980s: Retirement and death ==
Nelson retired with the closing of his studio in the mid-1980s. In 1984, he became a scholar in residence at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. He died in New York City in 1986.

== Influence and legacy ==
The George Nelson Associates, Inc. catalog, and exhibition designs for Herman Miller, made modernism the most important driving force in the company. From his start in the mid-forties until the mid-eighties George Nelson Associates, Inc. partnered with most of the modernist designers of the time. This was both the result of Nelson&#x27;s time as a magazine editor, and because of Nelson&#x27;s writing. His skill as a writer helped legitimize and stimulate the field of industrial design by contributing to the creation of &quot;Industrial Design&quot; magazine in 1953. Nelson wrote extensively, published several books, and organized conferences like the Aspen design gatherings, where for more than 30 years he was the guiding force. In 1971, he received a grant from the Graham Foundation for his project &quot;Hidden Cities&quot;. One of George Nelson&#x27;s areas of interest was the reduction of pollution. Through his attempts to reduce all forms of pollution, including visual, audio, and chemical, Nelson pioneered the idea of the outdoor shopping mall, first using the idea in a proposal for the city plan of Austin, Texas, which was not used.

In 2008, the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, Germany, held a retrospective of Nelson&#x27;s work to celebrate his 100th birthday. Design critic Alice Rawsthorn, covering the retrospective for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, argued that Nelson&#x27;s contributions have been unfairly overlooked due to his association with the cubicle and jokey 1950s objects. &quot;Blaming Nelson for the soullessness of today&#x27;s open-plan offices seems as unfair as slating Le Corbusier for other architects&#x27; sloppily designed skyscrapers, or Marcel Duchamp for every lazy piece of conceptual art,&quot; she wrote. &quot;[Nelson] championed the importance of values in design, which he saw as a catalyst for social change.&quot;

=== Attribution ===
In recent years it has become known that many of the designs George Nelson accepted credit for were actually the work of other designers employed at his studios. Examples of this include the Marshmallow sofa, which was actually designed by Irving Harper. Propst did not receive credit for Action Office. John Pile, a designer who worked for Nelson in the 1950s, commented about this practice; &quot;George&#x27;s attitude was that it was okay for individual designers to be given credit in trade publications, but for the consumer world, the credit should always be to the firm, not the individual. He didn&#x27;t always follow through on that policy though.&quot;

In an interview in &quot;Metropolis&quot; in 2001, Irving Harper also commented on this practice: &quot;...there always had to be one name associated with the work. We couldn&#x27;t just spread it around… that&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m grateful to George for what he did for me. While he was alive, I made no demands whatsoever, but now that he&#x27;s gone, whenever the Marshmallow Sofa is referred to as a &#x27;George Nelson design&#x27;, it sort of gets to me. I don&#x27;t go out of my way to set things right, but if anybody asks me who designed it, I&#x27;m perfectly happy to tell them.&quot;

Use of a single welt along the perimeter of the padding for approachable softness. Padding held up by rubber bands for comfort.

His firm, George Nelson Associates, also designed a large series of wall and table clocks for the Howard Miller company, as well as a range of hanging Bubble Lamps, which had plastic membrane-covered wire-form shades, wrought iron fireplace pieces, planters, room dividers, ceiling-mounted &quot;Ribbon Wall,&quot; spice cabinets, and many other products that became milestones in the history of a profession that he helped to shape.

A number of the nearly 300 classic wall and table clocks for Howard Miller Clock Company (including the Ball, Kite, Eye, Turbine, Spindle, Petal and Spike clocks, as well as a handful of desk clocks) are currently available from Vitra. Many were designed by Irving Harper (as well as Lucia DeRespinis, Charles Pollock, and others). Subsequently, Vitra has discontinued some of their reproduction clocks based on sales.

All the original clock designs were simply assigned numbers by Howard Miller. Probably the most recognisable of the series, the Ball Clock, was advertised and sold as &#x27;Clock 4755&#x27;; the Sunflower Clock as &#x27;Clock 2261&#x27;. Several colour variations were available for many of the clocks. The Ball Clock was available in six colour variations, the Sunflower Clock in three. One of the more unusual designs, the Eye Clock (&#x27;Clock 2238&#x27;) was pictured in the original Howard Miller Clock Company brochures in a diagonal position, not horizontal, as would be expected.

=== Fairchild House ===
The 1941 Fairchild House was built for the Airplane manufacturer Sherman Fairchild and was meant to be a &quot;machine for living&quot;. The building&#x27;s architecture was centered on its central courtyard, with all windows (including floor-to-ceiling windows) facing towards it.

== Analysis of work ==
Nelson has been tagged a metadesigner for his progressive thinking of interdisciplinary design, for bringing his primary focus on the process, not the product. However, he was not only unconventional and noncommercial in his presentations, but at times even negative. &quot;...it is the career of an architect who advocated the end of architecture, a furniture designer who imagined rooms without furniture, an urban designer who contemplated the hidden city, an industrial designer who questioned the future of the object and hated the obsession with products.&quot;

<text>Old Dalby is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Broughton and Old Dalby, in the Melton district of Leicestershire, England. It is located to the north-west of Melton Mowbray. It was originally known as &quot;Wold Dalby&quot; or &quot;Dalby on the Wolds&quot;. In 1931 the parish had a population of 315. On 1 April 1936 the parish was abolished to form &quot;Broughton and Old Dalby&quot;.


==Village==
Old Dalby is a rural village with an active community. It has its own primary and pre-schools, Church, Scout, Cubs and Beaver Building at Queensway, and a retirement home, Hunter&#x27;s Lodge. There is a pub/restaurant, the ancient refurbished &#x27;The Crown&#x27;. There has been no post office for several years but there is a &quot;pop-up&quot; post office service. Details are available on the Old Dalby Village Hall website.

For around 33 years, on the August bank holiday Monday, the village held a fête known as &quot;Old Dalby Day&quot; to raise money for charities connected with the village. The fête grew to feature many events and attracted visitors from many miles around. In 2019 insufficient volunteers were prepared to help organise the event and Old Dalby Day was suspended. 

In 2019 the prominent Turkey oak that stood at the village green was found to be diseased; it was initially pollarded rather than felled outright but finally removed in February 2024.

The Knights Hospitallers owned a preceptory in the village from the early 12th century. Traces of the historically important Dalby Preceptory are still just visible on the surface. The ancient carp ponds survive to this day.

Before and early in the Second World War an Ordnance Depot was established to the east of the village serving as a storage depot for machinery, associated spares and tools. The depot closed in 1996 and now serves as Old Dalby Business Park. The camp that grew nearby to house the workers and military personnel for the depot was originally a series of Nissen huts housing nearly 3,500 soldiers and around 300 prisoners of war. These later became derelict and a housing estate developed there which is now a separate settlement known as Queensway.

==Village hall==
The village hall is located at the centre of the village and was originally a school house. is the meeting place of several local societies, including the, Wine Club, yoga classes, the crafters and a &quot;drop in&quot; mornings. Other entertainment and events take place throughout the year. In 2018/9 the Hall was awarded a grant towards its refurbishment by the Heritage Lottery Fund. Events designed to further knowledge of the village&#x27;s heritage and history have included a Feast Day with a visit from Tony Rotherham, a lecture on archaeology by Carenza Lewis and lessons in Edwardian dress and manners for children from the local school. 

In September 2019 several test mini pits were excavated throughout the village under the supervision of Carenza Lewis. Amongst the finds were an array of clay pipes, 8th century earthernware and, from near the long gone Queensway Camp guardhouse, a soldier&#x27;s cap badge.
The heritage group has, with the advice and help of The Heritage Lottery Fund and Lincoln University, created an Archive to collate, record, digitise and archive a series of historical photographs and documents submitted by long-term residents. This initiative is in progress and can be accessed via the Village Hall website. 

During lockdown, in 2020, many of the activities were suspended but the village hall committee worked hard to design and produce a display of the history of Old Dalby. This takes the form of a 3 metre long wall chart hung inside the hall at the end of December 2020.

==Queensway==

Queensway, part of Old Dalby, is a housing estate of more than 200 homes around a mile to the east of the village. Green fields until 1938 the land was bought by the War Office and a camp established to serve the ordnance and maintenance depot that was built nearby at the outbreak of the Second World War. At the height of its use the camp housed some 3,500 army and civilian personnel, mainly in Nissen huts. The camp also guarded around 300 prisoners of war. Gradually houses were built, from the early 1950s and throughout the &#x27;60s, as homes for permanent officers and staff. The road “Queensway” was named for the Queen on her coronation in June 1953 and the entire settlement shortly thereafter adopted the name. The camp and depot had its own cinema, canteen/ restaurants, officers mess, dance hall and sports pitches.

After the war ended and the need for staff diminished, houses were sold and the army presence gradually reduced. The depot remained busy, however, repairing large weapons, their transport and equipment. A fence remained around the base for many years and the gates were actually locked and guarded for a while after IRA attacks on mainland Britain in the 1980s.

The depot continued in use throughout the Cold War and became a centre of excellence for maintenance of electronic and radar equipment. Finally closing as a military base in the 1990s the buildings became industrial units and remain as such. One of the buildings was taken by Belvoir Brewery who produce a wide range of ales and had their own alehouse and restaurant until their closure in 2020.

==Railway test track==

Old Dalby is the location of the control centre of the former British Rail Research Division&#x27;s railway Old Dalby Test Track, which runs between Melton Mowbray and Edwalton.

It was established in 1970 to test the Advanced Passenger Train. In July 1984 the track was used to run a Class 46 locomotive and train into a stationary nuclear flask in order to prove the safety of the container. The test was recorded and reported widely enough to make Old Dalby famous for a while. A video of the test can be seen here.

As part of the privatisation of British Rail, the track was leased to Serco, with ownership passing from British Rail to BRB (Residuary) Limited.

In the early 2000s, the track was taken over by Alstom and electrified on the 25 kV overhead system in order to test the Class 390 &quot;Pendolinos&quot; it was building for Virgin Trains West Coast. During this upgrade phase the centre of operations moved from Old Dalby to Asfordby (on the outskirts of Melton Mowbray) where a depot was converted from the former National Coal Board&#x27;s buildings. After the &quot;Pendolino&quot; project was completed in 2005, the line was mothballed.

In February 2007, Metronet the consortium charged with renewing a large proportion of the London Underground&#x27;s lines, announced it had taken over the test track for the testing of new London Underground S7 and S8 Stock. To accomplish this it electrified part of the line with third and fourth rail system but the original 25 kV line was also retained for future use.

<text>Frederick Christ Trump Sr. (October 11, 1905 – June 25, 1999) was an American real-estate developer and businessman. He was the father of the 45th and 47th U.S. president, Donald Trump.

Born in the Bronx in New York City to German immigrant parents, Trump began working in home construction and sales in the 1920s before heading the real-estate business started by his parents (later known as the Trump Organization). His company rose to success, building and managing single-family houses in Queens, apartments for war workers on the East Coast during World War II, and more than 27,000 apartments in New York overall. Trump was investigated for profiteering by a U.S. Senate committee in 1954 and again by New York State in 1966. Donald Trump became the president of his father&#x27;s real-estate business in 1971. Two years later, they were sued by the U.S. Justice Department&#x27;s Civil Rights Division for racial discrimination against black people.

Contradicting Donald Trump&#x27;s claim that he built a multibillion-dollar company using &quot;a small loan of a million dollars&quot; from his father, in 2018 &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Fred and his wife, Mary Trump, provided over $1 billion (in 2018 currency) to their children overall, avoiding over $500 million in gift taxes. In 1992, Fred and Donald set up a subsidiary which was used to funnel Fred&#x27;s finances to his surviving children; shortly before his death, Fred transferred the ownership of most of his apartment buildings to his children, who several years later sold them for over 16 times their previously declared worth.

In 1927, Trump was arrested at a Ku Klux Klan demonstration; there is no conclusive evidence that he supported the organization. From World War II onwards, to avoid associations with Nazism, Trump denied his German ancestry and also supported Jewish causes.

==Early life and career==

Trump&#x27;s father, the German-born Frederick Trump, amassed considerable wealth during the Klondike Gold Rush by running a restaurant and brothel for miners. Friedrich returned to Kallstadt in 1901, and, by the next year, met and married Elizabeth Christ. They moved to New York City, where their first child, Elizabeth, was born in 1904. Later that year, the family returned to Kallstadt. Fred was conceived in Bavaria, where his parents wished to residency, but Friedrich was banished for dodging the draft. The family returned to New York on July 1, 1905, and moved to the Bronx, where Frederick Christ Trump was born on October 11. Fred&#x27;s younger brother, John G. Trump, was born in 1907. All three children were raised speaking German. In September 1908, the family moved to Woodhaven, Queens. 

Many details of Trump&#x27;s childhood come from autobiographical accounts and emphasize independence, learning and especially hard workto the point of being somewhat fictionalized. At the age of 10, Trump worked as a delivery boy for a butcher. About two years later, on Memorial Day, his father died in the 1918 flu pandemic, according to Fred quite suddenly. From 1918 to 1923, Fred attended Richmond Hill High School in Queens, while working as a caddy, curb whitewasher, delivery boy, and newspaper hawker. Meanwhile, his mother continued the real-estate business Friedrich had begun. Interested in becoming a builder, Fred put up a garage for a neighbor and took night classes in carpentry and reading blueprints; he reputedly studied plumbing, masonry, and electrical wiring via correspondence courses, although other biographical sources limit his construction education to the period after high school when he was also working in the field. 

After graduating in January 1923, Trump obtained full-time work pulling lumber to construction sites. He studied carpentry and became a carpenter&#x27;s assistant. Trump&#x27;s mother held the business in her name until he reached 21, the age of majority. The company name &quot;E. Trump &amp; Son&quot; appeared in advertising by 1924, by which year Trump ostensibly used an $800 loan from his mother to complete and sell his first house. Public records, however, do not support him building until 1927, the year the company was incorporated (and following Trump&#x27;s 21st birthday). Trump purportedly built 19 more homes by 1926 in Hollis, Queens, selling some before they were finished to finance others. Investigative journalist Wayne Barrett posits that Trump exaggerated the length of his career in 1934 while arguing in federal court why he should deserve a dissolved company&#x27;s mortgage servicer.
In 1927, Trump was arrested at a Ku Klux Klan demonstration, although there is no conclusive evidence that he supported the organization.

===Rise to success===

In 1933, Trump built one of New York City&#x27;s first modern supermarkets, called Trump Market, in Woodhaven, Queens. It was modeled on Long Island&#x27;s King Kullen, a self-service supermarket chain. Trump&#x27;s store advertised &quot;Serve Yourself and Save!&quot; and quickly became popular. After six months, Trump sold it to King Kullen.

In federal court in 1934, Trump and a partner acquired the mortgage-servicing subsidiary of Brooklyn&#x27;s J. Lehrenkrauss Corporation, which had gone bankrupt and had subsequently been broken up. This gave Trump access to the titles of many properties nearing foreclosure, which he bought at low cost and sold at a profit. This and similar real-estate ventures quickly brought him fame as one of New York City&#x27;s most successful businessmen.

Trump made use of loan subsidies created by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) not long after the program was initiated via the National Housing Act of 1934, which also enabled the discriminatory practice of redlining. By 1936, Trump had 400 workers digging foundations for houses that would be sold at prices ranging from $3,000 to $6,250. Trump used his father&#x27;s psychological tactic of listing properties at prices ending in &quot;... 9.99&quot;. In the late 1930s, he used a boat to advertise off Coney Island&#x27;s shore; it played patriotic music and floated out swordfish-shaped balloons which could be redeemed for $25 or $250 towards one of his properties. In 1938, the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; referred to Trump as &quot;the Henry Ford of the home building industry&quot;. During this period, Trump predicted that he would profit from World War II. By 1942, he had built 2,000 homes in Brooklyn using FHA funds.

During the war, the federal Office of Production Management (established in 1941) allowed the use of FHA funding for defense housing in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, owing to the proximity of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Trump planned to build 700 houses there, which would have been both his and the state FHA office&#x27;s biggest project to date, but following the attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States&#x27;s declaration of war on Japan, the project was dissolved in favor of defense housing at the East Coast&#x27;s naval nexus, Hampton Roads&#x27;s Norfolk, Virginia, where Trump was already working on an apartment complex. Congress added a provision to the National Housing Act generating mortgage insurance for defense apartments, through which Trump was allowed to own the properties he built for war workers. By 1944, he had constructed 1,360 wartime apartments, almost 10% of the total created in Norfolk. He also built barracks and garden apartments for U.S. Navy personnel near major shipyards in Norfolk and Newport News, Virginia, as well as Chester, Pennsylvania.

Following the war, Trump expanded into middle-income housing for the families of returning veterans. From 1947 to 1949, he built Shore Haven in Bensonhurst, which included 32 six-story buildings and a shopping center, covering some and procuring him $9 million in FHA funding. In 1950, he built the 23-building Beach Haven Apartments over near Coney Island, procuring him $16 million in FHA funds. The total number of apartments included in these projects exceeded 2,700.

Decades after hiring PR man Howard Rubenstein to generate press about his life story mirroring the rags-to-riches novels of 19th-century author Horatio Alger, in 1985, Fred was awarded the Horatio Alger Award (for &quot;distinguished Americans&quot;). Radio and television personality Art Linkletter introduced Trump at the ceremony, with Peale&#x27;s wife (and previous award recipient), Ruth Peale, presenting him the award. During his speech, Trump stated that the key to his success was enthusiasm for his work and that he &quot;used to watch other successful people ... that did good and that did bad and ... followed the good qualities that they had&quot;. He then (apparently erroneously) attributed to William Shakespeare the saying &quot;Never follow an empty wagon because&quot;, pointing to his cranium, &quot;nothing ever falls off&quot;. He went on to introduce his surviving nuclear family.

==Further enterprises==
In early 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower and other federal leaders began denouncing real-estate profiteers. That June, &quot;The New York Times&quot; included Trump on a list of 35 city builders accused of profiteering from government contracts. He and others were investigated by a U.S. Senate banking committee for windfall gains. Trump and his partner William Tomasello were cited as examples of how profits were made by builders using the FHA. The two paid $34,200 for a piece of land which they rented to their corporation for $76,960 annually in a 99-year lease, so that if the apartment they built on it ever defaulted, the FHA would owe them $1.924 million. Trump and Tomasello evidently obtained loans for $3.5 million more than Beach Haven Apartments had cost. Trump argued that because he had not withdrawn the money, he had not literally pocketed the profits. He further argued that due to rising costs, he would have had to invest more than the 10% of the mortgage loan not provided by the FHA, and therefore suffer a loss if he built under those conditions.

In 1961, Trump donated $2,500 to the re-election campaign of New York mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr., helping him gain favor for the construction of Trump Village, a large apartment complex in Coney Island. The project was constructed in 1963–64 for $70 million. It was one of Trump&#x27;s biggest and last major projects, and the only one to bear his name. He built more than 27,000 low-income apartments and row houses in the New York area altogether, including Brooklyn (in Coney Island, Bensonhurst, Sheepshead Bay, Flatbush, and Brighton Beach) and Queens (in Flushing and Jamaica Estates).

In 1966, Trump was again investigated for windfall profiteering, this time by New York State investigators. After Trump overestimated building costs sponsored by a state program, he profited $598,000 on equipment rentals in the construction of Trump Village, which was then spent on other projects. Under testimony on January 27, 1966, Trump said that he had personally done nothing wrong and praised the success of his building project. The commission called Trump &quot;a pretty shrewd character&quot; with a &quot;talent for getting every ounce of profit out of his housing project&quot;, but no indictments were made. It was suggested instead that the state&#x27;s housing program was in need of tighter administration protocols and accountability. A deputy attorney general corresponded with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding any reports it had about Trump before he was set to be deposed on March 31, 1966.

===Steeplechase Park===
On July 1, 1965, Trump purchased Coney Island&#x27;s recently closed Steeplechase Park for $2.3 million, intending to build luxury apartments. The next year, he announced plans for a enclosed dome with recreational facilities and a convention center. At a highly publicized ceremony in September 1966, Trump demolished the park&#x27;s Pavilion of Fun, a large glass-enclosed amusement center. He reportedly sold bricks to ceremony guests to smash the remaining glass panels, which included an iconic representation of the park&#x27;s mascot, the &quot;Funny Face&quot;. The next month, New York City announced plans to acquire the former park grounds for recreational use. Trump filed a series of court cases related to the proposed rezoning, ultimately winning $1.3 million. After the site sat vacant for several years, Trump started subleasing it to a manager of fairground amusement park rides. Over another decade, the city eventually succeeded in reclaiming the property.

In July 2016, the Coney Island History Project held a special exhibit for the &quot;50th Anniversary of Fred Trump&#x27;s Demolition of Steeplechase Pavilion&quot;.

===Son becomes company president===

Fred&#x27;s son, Donald, joined his father&#x27;s real-estate business around 1968, initially working in Brooklyn. That year, Fred reputedly secured Donald a deferment from the Vietnam War by prioritizing maintenance for a tenant who, ostensibly in exchange, diagnosed Donald with bone spurs. In 1971, Donald became president of the company, with Fred becoming chairman. Donald began calling the company &#x27;the Trump Organization&#x27; around 1973. The younger Trump entered the real-estate business in Manhattan, while his father operated primarily in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Some sources state that Fred planned the expansion of the business to Manhattan. His granddaughter Mary L. Trump states that he was &quot;intimately involved in all aspects of Donald&#x27;s early forays into the Manhattan market&quot; while Louise Sunshine (organization vice president from 1973 to 1985) claims Fred was &quot;behind [Donald] in every way, shape and form [including] financing of these developments&quot;. Fred reputedly stated: &quot;I gave Donald free rein. He has great vision and everything he touches seems to turn to gold. ... [He] is the smartest person I know.&quot; Donald said, &quot;It was good for me. You know, being the son of somebody, it could have been competition to me. This way, I got Manhattan all to myself.&quot;

In the mid-1970s, Donald received loans from his father exceeding $14 million. In 2015–16, during his campaign for U.S. president, Donald claimed that his father had given him &quot;a small loan of a million dollars&quot; which he used to build &quot;a company that&#x27;s worth more than $10 billion&quot;. An October 2018 &quot;New York Times&quot; exposé on Fred and Donald Trump&#x27;s finances revealed that Fred created 295 income streams for Donald and concludes that the latter &quot;was a millionaire by age 8&quot;, receiving $413 million (adjusted for inflation; $483.6 million in 2023 currency) from Fred&#x27;s business empire over his lifetime, including over $60.7 million (unadjusted for inflation; $163.9 million in 2023 currency) in loans, which were largely unreimbursed.

According to Trump construction vice president Barbara Res, Fred seated business guests in an off-balance chair and advised Donald to arrange his office so that adversaries could be forced to face the sun.

===Federal civil rights lawsuit===
Minority applicants turned away from renting apartments complained to the New York City Commission on Human Rights and the Urban League, leading these groups to send test applicants to Trump-owned complexes in July 1972. They found that white people were offered apartments, while black people were generally turned away (by being told there were no vacancies); according to the superintendent of Beach Haven Apartments, this was at the direction of his boss. Both of the aforementioned advocacy organizations then raised the issue with the Justice Department. In October 1973, the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) filed a civil rights lawsuit against the Trump Organization (Fred Trump, chair, and Donald Trump, president) for infringing the Fair Housing Act of 1968. In response, Trump attorney Roy Cohn countersued for $100 million in damages, accusing the DoJ of false accusations.

The FBI interviewed about three dozen former Trump employees. Some testified that they had no knowledge of any racial profiling practices and that a small percentage of their apartments were rented to blacks or Puerto Ricans. A former doorman testified that his supervisor had instructed him to tell prospective black tenants that the rent was double its actual amount. Four landlords or rental agents confirmed that applications sent to the Trump organization&#x27;s head office for approval were coded by the race of the applicant. One former employee testified that a codewhich he believed was used throughout the Brooklyn branch of the companyreferred to &quot;low lifes&quot; such as &quot;blacks, Puerto Ricans, apparent drug users, or any other type of undesirable applicant&quot;, and nine times out of ten it meant the applicant was black; blacks were also falsely told there were no vacancies. A rental agent who had worked with the company for two weeks said that when he asked Fred Trump if he should rent to blacks, he was told that it was &quot;absolutely against the law to discriminate&quot;, but after asking again, he was instructed &quot;not to rent to blacks&quot;, and was further advised to:
Meanwhile, Trump acquired up to 20% of Brooklyn&#x27;s Starrett City, a large, federally subsidized housing complex which opened in 1974 with the stated desegregation goal of renting 70% of its units to white people and the rest to minorities.

A consent decree between the DoJ and the Trump Organization was signed on June 10, 1975, with both sides claiming victorythe Trump Organization because the settlement did not require them &quot;to accept persons on welfare as tenants&quot;, and the head of DoJ&#x27;s housing division for the decree being &quot;one of the most far-reaching ever negotiated&quot;. It personally and corporately prohibited the Trumps from &quot;discriminating against any person in the ... sale or rental of a dwelling&quot;, and &quot;required Trump to advertise vacancies in minority papers [for two years], promote minorities to professional jobs, and list vacancies on a preferential basis&quot;. Finally, it ordered the Trumps to &quot;thoroughly acquaint themselves personally on a detailed basis with ... the Fair Housing Act of 1968&quot;.

===Later legal trespasses===
In 1975, tenants of two of Trump&#x27;s Norfolk tower complexes held a monthlong rent strike due to rodent and insect infestations, as well as problems with water heating, air conditioning, and elevator service. In early 1976, Trump was ordered by a county judge to correct code violations in a 504-unit property in Seat Pleasant, Maryland. According to the county&#x27;s housing department investigator, violations included broken windows, dilapidated gutters, and missing fire extinguishers. After a court date and a series of phone calls with Trump, he was invited to the property to meet with county officials in September 1976 and arrested on site. Trump was released on $1,000 bail.

In 1987, when Donald&#x27;s loan debt to his father exceeded $11 million, Fred invested $15.5 million in Trump Palace Condominiums; in 1991, he sold these shares to his son for $10,000, thus appearing to evade millions of dollars in gift taxes by masking a hidden donation, and also benefiting from a legally questionable write-off. In late 1990, when an $18.4 million bond payment for Atlantic City&#x27;s Trump&#x27;s Castle was due, Fred sent a bookkeeper to buy $3.5 million in casino chips, which were not used. Trump&#x27;s Castle quickly made its bond payment. The state&#x27;s Casino Control Commission found the transaction to constitute an illegal loan and fined the casino $65,000.

In 1992, Fred and Donald set up a subsidiary company which each of Fred&#x27;s living children owned a 20% stake in. As detailed in 2018 by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the business entity had no apparent legitimate purpose and was evidently used to conduct tax fraud by funneling millions of dollars of Fred&#x27;s wealth to his progeny without paying gift taxes. This was accomplished by billing Fred much more than the actual cost of maintenance work and goods such as boilers.

==Wealth and death==
In 1976, Trump set up trust funds of $1 million ($5.3 million in 2023) for each of his five children and three grandchildren, which paid out yearly dividends. Trump appeared on the initial &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 list of richest Americans in 1982 with an estimated $200 million fortune split with his son Donald. That same year, Fred sold two Norfolk towers and some Hampton Roads military housing, the latter for $8–9 million, with perhaps $6.6 million pledged in promissory notes (which were apparently outstanding as of 2019). In 1998, a year before Fred&#x27;s death, while he was suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and his son Robert had power of attorney, the notes were transferred to limited liability companies connected to Trump Organization subsidiaries. 

In December 1990, Donald Trump sought to amend his father&#x27;s will, which according to Fred&#x27;s daughter Maryanne Trump Barry, &quot;was basically taking the whole estate and giving it to Donald&quot;, allowing him to &quot;sell, do anything he wants ... with the properties&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that this &quot;was designed to protect Donald Trump&#x27;s inheritance from efforts to seize it by creditors and Ivana&quot;, whom he divorced that month. Fred rejected the proposal, and in 1991, composed his own final will, which made Donald, Maryanne, and Robert Trump of his estate. Trump&#x27;s lawyer noted that Fred Jr.&#x27;s children, Fred III and Mary L. Trump, would be treated unequally because they would not receive their deceased father&#x27;s share, and wrote to Trump that &quot;Given the size of your estate, this is tantamount to disinheriting them. You may wish to increase their participation in your estate to avoid ill will in the future.&quot; In October 1991, Trump was diagnosed with &quot;mild senile dementia&quot;, with his physician citing symptoms of &quot;obvious memory decline in recent years&quot; and &quot;significant memory impairment&quot;. A few months later, another physician reported that Trump &quot;did not know his birth date [or] age&quot;, amongst other difficulties. Mary L. Trump recounted that as her grandfather&#x27;s dementia progressed, he failed to recognize people he had known for decades, including her and Donald. According to Fred III, his grandfather needed to be reminded why he was at Donald&#x27;s 1993 wedding (to Marla Maples) despite being designated the best man. Donald claimed that he first noticed his father exhibit symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s in the mid-1990s. 

In 1993, the anticipated shares of Trump&#x27;s estate amounted to $35 million for each surviving child. Most of his buildings were transferred to two grantor-retained annuity trusts under his and his wife&#x27;s names, which were used to give about two-thirds of the assets to their four surviving children, who bought the remaining third via annuity payments between 1995 and November 1997. The collective assets were valued at $41.4 million and in 2004 were sold for over 16 times this value, avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in gift taxes.

Trump finally fell ill with pneumonia and was admitted to Long Island Jewish Medical Center (LIJMC) for a few weeks, where he died at age 93 on June 25, 1999. A wake was held at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel ahead of his funeral at the Marble Collegiate Church, which was attended by over 600 people. His body was buried in a family plot at the Lutheran-Christian All Faiths Cemetery in Middle Village, Queens. Upon his death, Trump&#x27;s estate was estimated by his family at $250 million to $300 million, though he had only $1.9 million in cash. His will divided over $20 million after taxes among his surviving children and grandchildren. His widow, Mary, died on August 7, 2000, at age 88, also at LIJMC. Her and Fred&#x27;s combined estate was then valued at $51.8 million.

Following Trump&#x27;s death, Fred Jr.&#x27;s children contested their grandfather&#x27;s will, citing his dementia and claiming that the will was &quot;procured by fraud and undue influence&quot; by Donald, Maryanne, and Robert Trump. These three had claimed in their legal depositions that Fred Trump was &quot;sharp as a tack&quot; until just before his death, but otherwise stated that they were aware of his cognitive decline.

In December 2003, it was reported that Trump&#x27;s four surviving children would sell the apartments they acquired in 1997 to an investment group led by Rubin Schron, priced at $600 million; the sale occurred in May 2004. The 2016 leak of Donald Trump&#x27;s tax information from 2005, which showed an income of $153 million, prompted &quot;The New York Times&quot; to investigate, leading to the 2018 exposé. The &quot;Times&quot; reported that the properties sold in 2004 were valued over 16 times their previously declared worth. Fred and Mary reportedly provided their children with over $1 billion altogether, which should have been taxed at the rate of 55% for gifts and inheritances (over $550 million), but records show that a total of only $52.2 million (about 5%) was paid. According to New York State law, individuals can be prosecuted on the basis of intentional tax evasion if a fraudulent return form can be produced as evidence; the statute of limitations does not apply in such cases. By February 1, 2019, Maryanne Trump Barry was being investigated for possible judicial misconduct regarding the schemes, but this was mooted later in the month due to her retirement.
==Personal life==

In May 1927, over 1,000 robed members of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and 400 non-robed KKK supporters infiltrated a Memorial Day parade in Queens, prompting stern police intervention. Eight men were arrested, including the 21-year old Trump, whose charge of &quot;refusing to disperse from a parade when ordered to do so&quot; was dismissed. Another man, arrested on the same charge, was released on the basis of having been a bystander (whose foot was injured by a police car). Some newspaper articles on the incident list Trump&#x27;s address (in Jamaica, Queens), which he is recorded as living at on various documents from 1928 to 1940. Despite this arrest, there is no incontrovertible evidence that Trump was a supporter of the KKK.

Trump met his future wife, Mary Anne MacLeod, an immigrant from Tong, Lewis, Scotland, at a dance party in the early to mid-1930s. Trump told his mother the same evening that he had met his future wife. Trump, a Lutheran, married Mary, a Presbyterian, on January 11, 1936, at the Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church with George Arthur Buttrick officiating. A wedding reception was held at the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan, and they had a single-night honeymoon in Atlantic City. The couple settled in Jamaica, Queens, and had five children: Maryanne Trump Barry (1937–2023), Fred Trump Jr. (1938–1981; an airline pilot with Trans World Airlines), Elizabeth Trump Grau (born 1942; a retired executive of Chase Manhattan Bank), Donald Trump (born 1946), and Robert Trump (1948–2020; a top executive of his father&#x27;s property management company until his retirement).

During World War II, Trump began concealing his German ancestry. Notwithstanding his German accent (later replaced by a New York one), he denied that he spoke the language. Partly due to the prominence of Jews in New York, he supported Jewish causes, with contributions (apparently starting in 1941 two weeks after the U.S. entered the war) convincing some he practiced Judaism. He also omitted the &quot;h&quot; from his middle name (sidestepping the potential implication he could be anti-Semitic as a Christian). Trump later falsely claimed that he was of Swedish (Northern European) descent, and in 1973 wrongly stated that he was born in New Jersey; these deceptions were sustained in the 1980s by Donald Trump and the author of Donald&#x27;s first biography. During the 1980s, Fred became friends with the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, Benjamin Netanyahu, later the prime minister of Israel.

After Elizabeth&#x27;s birth, and with the U.S. becoming more involved in the war, Trump moved his family to Hampton Roads&#x27;s Virginia Beach. In 1944, as Trump&#x27;s FHA funding lulled, they returned to Jamaica Estates, Queens, where Mary suffered a miscarriage. By 1946, they were living in a five-bedroom Tudor-style house Trump built in Jamaica Estates, and Trump purchased a neighboring lot, where he built a 23-room, 9-bathroom mansion. The family moved in during 1950–1951, and Fred and Mary remained there until their deaths. The couple was also given an apartment on the 55th (labelled the 63rd) floor of Donald&#x27;s Trump Tower (), which they rarely if ever used.

Trump was a teetotaler and an authoritarian parent, imposing strict table manners and curfews, as well as forbidding cursing, lipstick, and snacking between meals. At the end of his day, Trump would receive a report from Mary on the children&#x27;s actions and, if necessary, decide upon disciplinary actions. Additionally, the mansion featured a surveillance system and an intercom, which Trump used to censure his children. He took his children to building sites to collect empty bottles to return for the deposits. The boys had paper routes, and when weather conditions were poor, their father would let them make their deliveries in a limousine. According to Fred Jr.&#x27;s daughter, Mary L. Trump, Fred Sr. wanted his oldest son to be &quot;invulnerable&quot; in personality so he could take over the family business, but Fred Jr. was the opposite. Trump instead elevated Donald to become his business heir, teaching him to &quot;be a killer&quot;, and telling him, &quot;You are a king.&quot; Mary L. Trump states that Fred Sr. &quot;dismantled [Fred Jr.] by devaluing and degrading every aspect of his personality&quot; and mocked him for his decision to become an airline pilot. In 1981, Fred Jr. died at age 42 from complications due to his alcoholism.

According to Donald Trump, while his mother was watching the 1953 coronation of Elizabeth II on television, Fred said while pacing around, &quot;For Christ&#x27;s sake, Mary. Enough is enough, turn it off. They&#x27;re all a bunch of con artists.&quot; Also in the 1950s, Fred became an admirer of Protestant minister Norman Vincent Peale, the author of &quot;The Power of Positive Thinking&quot; (1952), due to his businesslike approach to life and Christianity. Trump and his family attended sermons by Peale at Manhattan&#x27;s Marble Collegiate Church. Trump was also a supporter of Southern Baptist evangelist Billy Graham, whom he took his family to see speak at Yankee Stadium ().

===Philanthropy===
Fred and Mary Trump supported medical charities by donating buildings. After Mary received medical care at the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, they donated the Trump Pavilion rehabilitation building; Fred was also a trustee of the hospital. The couple donated a two-building complex in Brooklyn as a home for &quot;functionally retarded adults&quot;, a New Jersey building valued at $4.75 million to United Cerebral Palsy (which Donald took credit for), and other buildings to the National Kidney Foundation (NKF). Trump donated one of his least profitable properties to the NKF, which according to &quot;The New York Times&quot; was &quot;one of the largest charitable donations he ever made&quot;, with a deduction proportional to its stated value, claimed in his 1992 tax return as $34 million.

Particularly after U.S. entry into World War II in late 1941, Trump backed both Jewish and Israeli causes. This included Israel Bonds, donating the land for the Beach Haven Jewish Center, a synagogue in Flatbush, Brooklyn, and in 1952 serving as the treasurer of an Israel benefit concert featuring American easy-listening performers.

Fred supported the private Kew-Forest School, where his children attended and he served on the board of directors. The Trumps were active in The Salvation Army, the Boy Scouts of America, and the Lighthouse for the Blind. Fred reportedly also supported the Long Island Jewish Hospital and Manhattan&#x27;s Hospital for Special Surgery; at the latter, he was a patient of orthopedist Philip D. Wilson Jr., the hospital&#x27;s lead surgeon from 1972 to 1989.

Although he was registered as a Republican Party voter, Trump developed ties with the Democratic Party in New York, contributing to city politicians (including $2,500 to Mayor Wagner&#x27;s 1961 campaign, enabling the construction of Trump Village). Together with Donald in the 1980s, Fred provided over $350,000 to city politicians including Mayor Ed Koch, Council president Andrew Stein, Controller Harrison J. Goldin, and four of the five borough presidents.

In October 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in an exposé on Trump&#x27;s financial records that they had found no evidence that he had made any significant financial contributions to charities.

==Legacy==

Folk singer Woody Guthrie was a tenant of Beach Haven Apartments from 1950 to 1951. In his unrecorded song &quot;Old Man Trump&quot;, he complains about the rent and accused Trump of stirring up racial hate &quot;in the bloodpot of human hearts&quot;. Similarly, in an unreleased version of &quot;Ain&#x27;t Got No Home&quot;, Guthrie states:

Trump was indirectly claimed as a relative of Republican politician Fred J. Trump, a candidate in the 1956 Arizona gubernatorial election and correspondent of Richard Nixon during his 1960 presidential campaign against John F. Kennedy.

Jerome Tuccille&#x27;s 1985 biography of Donald Trump repeats Fred&#x27;s fabrication that he was born in New Jersey and erroneously states that his middle name was Charles (not Christ). Donald&#x27;s &quot;The Art of the Deal&quot; (1987) also alleges that Fred was born in New Jersey and further that he was the son of an immigrant from Sweden (not Germany). The &quot;New York Post&quot; repeated the latter claim in its eulogy for Fred. As U.S. president, Donald falsely stated at least three times that his father was born in Germany. According to a 2021 book about Donald&#x27;s last year as president, he once spoke disparagingly of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, stating, &quot;I know the fucking krauts,&quot; and pointing to his father&#x27;s portrait, continued, &quot;I was raised by the biggest kraut of them all.&quot; &quot;Kraut&quot; is an ethnic slur for a German (particularly a soldier of either world war).

In his 1993 biography of Donald Trump, Harry Hurt III asserts that Fred was a philanderer, with his alleged Floridian affairs leading him to be known as the &quot;King of Miami Beach&quot;. In 1989 (while Donald was married to Ivana but tabloids had begun reporting about his affair with future wife Marla Maples), Fred reputedly lectured Donald that he could &quot;have a thousand mistresses&quot; but not to get caught in a single specific extramarital affair. According to Hurt, after Donald decided to accompany Ivana to her father&#x27;s funeral in Czechoslovakia (amid their pending divorce), Fred told a longtime secretary and personal confidant, &quot;I hope their plane crashes. Then all my problems will be solved.&quot;

During Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign, his father&#x27;s 1927 arrest at a KKK march resurfaced. In mid-February 2017, a liberal Israeli newspaper asserted that both Donald Trump (who had called Fred his only &#x27;hero&#x27;) and Benjamin Netanyahu had inherited racism from their fathers, Trump against brown people and Netanyahu against Arabs. Three days later, the FBI declassified 389 pages from its early 1970s investigation of alleged racial discrimination by the Trump Organization. In his 2018 psychological profile of Donald, Justin A. Frank asserts that Fred was anti-Semitic. In 2020, Mary L. Trump supported this claim and said Fred could have been sympathetic to the KKK.

In May 2016, in an article about Donald Trump&#x27;s pseudonyms, &quot;Fortune&quot; reported that his father had used the false name &quot;Mr. Green&quot; to anonymously inquire about property values. In October 2016, in response to numerous Freedom of Information Act requests, the FBI released a small file it had on Fred; it includes a 1986 news article concerning political donations by Trump Management, an amply redacted 1991 memo implying the bureau received intel regarding ties to organized crime, and a background report on Trump Construction Corp.
In 2018, writing for &quot;New York&quot; magazine in response to the &quot;New York Times&quot; exposé, Jonathan Chait opined that many of Fred&#x27;s contributions to Donald were by definition criminal in nature.

In mid-2020, liberal political action committee (PAC) MeidasTouch cited the &quot;empty wagon&quot; quote from Trump&#x27;s Horatio Alger Association speech in arguing that Donald Trump both squandered the fortune he inherited from his father and the &quot;booming economy&quot; left to him by the Obama administration. Mary L. Trump, in her 2020 book, &quot;Too Much and Never Enough&quot;, claims that &quot;Donald, Fred Trump&#x27;s favorite son, dismissed and derided him when he began to succumb to Alzheimer&#x27;s&quot;. In the book, Mary, a clinical psychologist, asserts that Fred was a high-functioning sociopath. A 2024 article in the psychohistorical journal &quot;Clio&#x27;s Psyche&quot; claims that the &quot;cruel&quot; and &quot;mendacious&quot; Fred denied Donald of &quot;basic, life-affirming emotional nourishment&quot; (while repeating that he was a &quot;killer&quot; and a &quot;king&quot;), resulting in Donald&#x27;s &quot;absence of moral responsibility&quot;.

Following Donald Trump&#x27;s arrest in New York in 2023, some media outlets pointed out that his father had been arrested twice.

=== In popular culture ===
In the 2011 &quot;Comedy Central Roast&quot; of Donald Trump, the American comedian Seth MacFarlane credited Donald&#x27;s fortune to his father, mocking the former&#x27;s &quot;self-starter bullshit&quot; and comparing their relationship to that of Jaden and Will Smith.

In late 2016, Nell Scovell wrote about an unsuccessful attempt to visit Trump&#x27;s grave in &quot;Esquire&quot;, noting that an online photograph implied it to be surprisingly modest. After asking for directions, Scovell was elusively jawboned and raved at by the cemetery president.

In 2018, Nylon.com invoked a photograph of the elderly Trump with a pronounced depression behind one cheek (from a mandibulectomy) to opine that the &quot;New York Times&quot; exposé &quot;led people to know, perhaps for the first time, what Fred Trump looks like—and it turns out he bears resemblance to no shortage of fictional villains&quot;. Since 2018, Trump has been portrayed in various media.

In 2019, the American journalist and conspiracy theorist Wayne Madsen accused Fred of being a Nazi sympathizer on the basis of the German American Bund&#x27;s presence in New York. In mid-2020, fact-checking company Logically concluded that there was a lack of clear evidence that Trump was a Nazi supporter. During his 2024 U.S. presidential campaign, Donald Trump said that his father had told him to never say &quot;Nazi&quot; or mention Hitler.

<text>Champollion was a planned cometary rendezvous and landing spacecraft. It was named after Jean-François Champollion, a French Egyptologist known for translating the Rosetta Stone.

==Rosetta surface science package==
As originally envisaged, the joint NASA/CNES Champollion was to be one of two surface science packages for the Rosetta mission to comet Wirtanen, alongside the German-led RoLand. Champollion was to provide for return of cometary samples to Earth.

This part of the Rosetta mission was withdrawn in late 1996 due to lack of funding from JPL.

==Deep Space 4 / Space Technology 4==

Champollion was revived under NASA&#x27;s New Millennium Program as Deep Space 4 / Space Technology 4, again as a joint project of NASA and CNES. In this version, Champollion would be a stand-alone project consisting of an orbiter and a lander, with the focus shifted somewhat to engineering validation of new technologies rather than pure science.

As of March 1999, the baseline mission was to launch in April 2003, reaching comet Tempel 1 in 2006. The sample return element of the mission was at this point contingent on sufficient funding/resources, possibly being replaced with a demonstration of related capabilities.

The lander was approximately 1.5m high weighing 160 kg; it was to autonomously navigate to the comet from 50 km altitude and anchor itself with a spike. The planned payload included:
* CHARGE, a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer
* CIRCLE, cameras/microscope/IR spectrometer
* CIVA, panoramic cameras
* CPPP, &quot;physical properties probes&quot; to be driven into the cometary surface
* SATM drill mechanism
* gamma ray/neutron spectrometer

The orbiter was to carry cameras and a dust monitor.

Later in 1999, Space Technology 4 was scaled back to a single spacecraft with no sample return; it was cancelled entirely on July 1, 1999, due to budgetary constraints.

<doc id="1203339" wikidata="Q694360" url="?curid=1203339" title="Tabot">
<text>Tabot (, sometimes spelled tabout) is a replica of the Ark of the Covenant, and represents the presence of God, in Ethiopian Orthodox and Eritrean Orthodox Churches. &quot;Tabot&quot; may variously refer to an inscribed altar tablet (&quot;tsellat&quot; or &quot;tsilit&quot;; Ge&#x27;ez: ጽላት &quot;tsallāt&quot;, modern &quot;ṣellāt&quot;), the chest in which this tablet is stored (&quot;menbere-tabot&quot;, or throne of the &quot;tabot&quot;), or to the tablet and chest together.

According to Edward Ullendorff, the Geʽez word &quot;tabot&quot; is derived from Aramaic &quot;tēḇoṯā&quot;, like Hebrew &quot;tēḇā&quot;. Ullendorff stated that &quot;The concept and function of the &quot;tabot&quot; represent one of the most remarkable areas of agreement with Old Testament forms of worship.&quot;

==Description==
The &quot;tsellat&quot; is usually a square, and may be made from alabaster, marble or wood from an acacia tree, although longer lengths of upwards of are also common. This tablet is inscribed with the name of Jesus, and that of the saint to whom it is dedicated. 

A bishop consecrates the &quot;tabot&quot; (not the church building itself), and every church must have at least one &quot;tabot&quot; in order to conduct the liturgy. The &quot;tabot&quot; is kept in the church&#x27;s Holy of Holies (&quot;Qidduse Qiddusan&quot; or &quot;Bete Mekdes&quot;), where only the clergy may enter, and it is wrapped in ornate cloths to conceal it from public view. Only bishops and priests are allowed touch or handle a &quot;tabot&quot;, or see it without its coverings. If a layperson touches a &quot;tabot&quot;, a bishop must reconsecrate it before a church may use it again.

The Eucharist is administered from the &quot;tabot&quot;. During church festivals, such as the patronal feast day or during Timkat (known as Epiphany in English), the priests carry the &quot;tabot&quot; around the church courtyard in an elaborate procession reminiscent of 2 Samuel, chapter 6, in which King David leads the people dancing before the Ark. David Buxton describes one such procession, on the festival of Gebre Menfes Kidus:
==Looting and repatriation of tabots==

Although Ethiopia was never colonised by the British, many &quot;tabots&quot; were looted by British soldiers during the 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia, also known as the Battle of Magdala, and is a cause of anger among Ethiopians.

The return in February 2002 of one looted tabot, discovered in the storage of St John&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Edinburgh, was a cause of public rejoicing in Addis Ababa. Another was returned in 2003 after Ian McLennan recognised the ancient &quot;tabot&quot; at an auction in London. He bought it and donated it to the government of Ethiopia.

In February 2024, the Dean of Westminster Abbey agreed in principle to return the &quot;tabot&quot; which is sealed inside an altar in Westminster Abbey to Ethiopia. This is dependent on the consent of the Royal Household as the Monarch has jurisdiction over the Abbey.

<text>Love Wrecked (also known as Temptation Island internationally) is a 2005 American adventure romantic comedy film directed by Randal Kleiser. Starring Amanda Bynes, it is a romantic comedy about a girl getting stranded with a rock star on a beach in the Caribbean.

The film was released on May 18, 2005, internationally. In the United States, Media 8 Entertainment failed attempts to interest a theatrical distributor and, after nearly two years, the film was sold to ABC Family; where it premiered on January 21, 2007.

==Plot==
Jennifer Taylor is a huge fan of Jason Masters, a world-famous rock star, but her efforts to meet him are constantly thwarted by her nemesis, Alexis. Hoping for another chance to meet Jason, Jennifer takes a job at his favorite Caribbean resort, joined by her best friend Ryan.

Jennifer sneaks aboard a party vessel Jason is on, and when he is washed overboard, she jumps in to save him. Though the pair find themselves marooned in a secluded cove of a seemingly deserted island, she soon discovers that they have landed a short distance from the resort. Jennifer does not let on to Jason that they are not stranded so she can get him to fall in love with her.

Jennifer is secretly helped by Ryan, who drives out to her location to provide her with supplies. When Alexis discovers Jennifer&#x27;s ruse by following Ryan, she also pretends to be marooned with them. While Ryan has been helping, he has also decided to act on his long-standing crush on Jennifer, seeking advice on asking her out.

Ryan completely transforms himself, yet when Jennifer sees him, all she talks about is Jason. He confesses he cannot stop thinking about her and kisses her, but when she protests that they are friends, he tells her that he is going home and drives off.

Jennifer feels bad and after learning that the coast guard has called off the search for them and seeing mourning fans around the world, she tells Jason the truth about not being stranded. He becomes upset at both her and Alexis, promises to sue them both, and leaves them behind as he hitches a ride back to the resort.

When Ryan hears that a storm is going to hit the side of the island where Jennifer is, he drives out to save her. As the storm builds, she gets stuck in the car he had abandoned to look for her. Ryan returns just in time to save her as the car is about to slide over a muddy embankment. When he takes Jennifer into a cave and lights a fire to keep her warm, she realizes that he is the one that cares for her the most.

After the storm passes, Jenny and Ryan return to the resort, where Jason and his manager tell Jennifer that they need her help to maintain the &quot;stranded&quot; story at a press conference. Ryan proclaims his love for her before he is thrown out the door by Jason&#x27;s bodyguard.

At the press conference, Jennifer tells everyone that her boyfriend is Ryan and that Alexis is Jason&#x27;s fiancée, then walks off with Ryan. Some time later, while performing on stage in Winnipeg, Jason unhappily dedicates a song to his wife, Alexis, who is standing at his side.

In the UK, &quot;Love Wrecked&quot; was the first film released by Delanic Films, and was released on May 18, 2007. The film opened at no. 6 on the UK box office chart at 235 screens, and grossed £600,000.

==Reception==
&quot;Love Wrecked&quot; received generally poor reviews. On its Rotten Tomatoes listing, 17% of critics gave the film positive reviews, based on 6 reviews. Christopher Null of FilmCritic gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, stating that &quot;Bynes has made far better films&quot;. Brian Orndorf of DVD Talk said that &quot;&quot;Love Wrecked&quot; seems like such innocent fun until the tale drains of excitement and the Bynes batteries begin to wear down&quot;.

<text>Lauda Air Flight 004 (NG004/LDA004) was a regularly scheduled international passenger flight from Hong Kong, via Bangkok, Thailand, to Vienna, Austria. On 26 May 1991, the Boeing 767-300ER operating the route crashed following an uncommanded deployment of the thrust reverser on the No. 1 engine during the climb phase, causing the aircraft to enter an aerodynamic stall, uncontrolled dive, and in-flight breakup, killing all 213 passengers and ten crew members on board. It is the deadliest aviation accident involving the Boeing 767, and the deadliest aviation accident in Thailand&#x27;s history as of 2025. The accident marked the 767&#x27;s first fatal incident and third hull loss. Formula One world motor racing champion Niki Lauda, who founded and ran Lauda Air, was personally involved in the accident investigation.

==Aircraft==
The aircraft involved was a Boeing 767-300ER, the 283rd Boeing 767 built, that was powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4060 engines and was delivered new to Lauda Air on 16 October 1989. The aircraft was registered OE-LAV and named &quot;Mozart&quot;. At the time of the incident, the No. 2 engine had been on the airframe since assembly of the aircraft (7,444 hours and 1,133 cycles) whereas the No. 1 engine (with the faulty thrust reverser) had been on the aircraft since October 3, 1990 and had accumulated 2,904 hours and 456 cycles.

==Accident==
At the time of the accident, Lauda Air operated three weekly flights between Bangkok and Vienna. At 23:02 ICT on 26 May 1991, the Boeing 767-3Z9ER operating as Flight 4 (originating from Hong Kong&#x27;s Kai Tak Airport) departed Don Mueang International Airport in Bangkok for its passenger service to Vienna International Airport with 213 passengers and 10 crew under the command of American captain Thomas John Welch (48) and Austrian first officer Josef Thurner (41). Both pilots were regarded as very competent. At 23:08, Welch and Thurner received a visual warning indication on the EICAS display that a possible system failure would cause the thrust reverser on the No. 1 engine to deploy in flight. After consulting the aircraft&#x27;s Quick Reference Handbook, they determined that the alert was &quot;coming on and off&quot; and that it was &quot;just an advisory thing&quot;. The pilots took no remedial action, possibly believing that the indication was false, but also with the knowledge that the 767 could stop with only one operational reverser.

At 23:17, the No. 1 engine reverser deployed while the plane was over mountainous jungle terrain in the border area between the Suphan Buri and Uthai Thani provinces in Thailand. Thurner&#x27;s last recorded words were &quot;Oh, reverser&#x27;s deployed.&quot; Moments later, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) recorded a shuddering sound, followed closely by a snap. Due to the reverser design, an aerodynamic plume of air disrupted the airflow over the leading edge of the left wing during the engine&#x27;s rundown to idle thrust, which resulted in a 25% loss of lift and an aerodynamic stall.

The aircraft immediately began a diving left turn. The CVR recorded master caution warning and a second snapping sound, followed by various alerts such as overspeed and a second master caution, and Welch&#x27;s last recorded words: &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; in response to the rapid rolling sensation, &quot;here, wait a minute&quot; as he brought engine 1&#x27;s thrust lever to idle and shut down the engine and finally, &quot;damn it&quot;. Following this, the CVR recorded an increase in background wind noise followed by several loud bangs. Maneuvering overloads produced by the pilots&#x27; sustained attempts to regain pitch control, in combination with the increasing velocity of the dive, had exceeded the aircraft&#x27;s structural limits and destroyed the weakened aft fuselage along with the rest of the damaged flight surfaces. The loss of the tail caused further negative loading of the wings, as the airplane experienced Mach tuck and nosed over vertically, reaching a speed of at least Mach 0.99 (the highest value that the aircraft&#x27;s sensors could record), breaking the sound barrier.

The wings then experienced structural failure and separated at the trailing edges, engulfing the remains of the falling aircraft in flames before impacting mountainous wooded terrain and exploding. Most of the wreckage was scattered over a remote forest area roughly in size, at an elevation of , in what is now Phu Toei National Park, Suphan Buri. The wreckage site is about north-northeast of Phu Toey, Huay Kamin (), Dan Chang district, Suphan Buri province, about northwest of Bangkok, close to the Burma-Thailand border. Rescuers found Welch&#x27;s body still in the pilot&#x27;s seat.

==Recovery==
Volunteer rescue teams and local villagers looted the wreckage, taking electronics and jewellery, so relatives were unable to recover personal possessions. The bodies were taken to a hospital in Bangkok, but the storage was not refrigerated, and the bodies decomposed. Dental and forensic experts worked to identify bodies, but 27 were never identified.

Speculation circulated that a bomb may have destroyed the aircraft, as some eyewitnesses had reported seeing a large fireball surrounding the aircraft, the result of the disintegration of the right wing during the dive. However, a terrorist motive was believed unlikely, as Austria was politically neutral with a reputation of avoiding international conflicts such as the recent Gulf War.

== Investigation ==

The flight data recorder was completely destroyed, so only the cockpit voice recorder could be analysed. Thailand&#x27;s Air Safety Division head Pradit Hoprasatsuk stated that &quot;the attempt to determine why the reverser came on was hampered by the loss of the flight data recorder, which was destroyed in the crash&quot;. Upon hearing of the crash, Niki Lauda traveled to Thailand. He examined the wreckage and estimated that the largest fragment was about by , which was about half the size of the largest piece resulting from the Lockerbie bombing. Lauda attended a funeral for 23 unidentified passengers in Thailand and then traveled to Seattle to meet with Boeing representatives.

The official investigation, led by Thailand&#x27;s Aircraft Accident Investigation Committee, lasted approximately eight months and resulted in a conclusion of probable cause: &quot;The Accident Investigation Committee of the Government of Thailand determines the probable cause of this accident to be [an] uncommanded in-flight deployment of the left engine thrust reverser, which resulted in loss of flight path control. The specific cause of the thrust reverser deployment has not been positively identified.&quot; Multiple possibilities were investigated, including a short circuit in the electrical system. However, the destruction of much of the wiring meant that investigators could not arrive at a definitive reason for the activation of the thrust reverser.

As evidence began to implicate the thrust reversers as the cause of the accident, Lauda conducted simulator flights at Gatwick Airport that appeared to show that deployment of a thrust reverser was a survivable condition. Lauda said that the thrust reverser could not be the sole cause of the crash. However, the accident report states that the &quot;flight crew training simulators yielded erroneous results&quot; and that recovery from the loss of lift from the reverser deployment &quot;was uncontrollable for an unexpecting flight crew&quot;.

The incident prompted Boeing to modify the thrust-reverser system to prevent similar occurrences by adding sync locks, which prevent the thrust reversers from deploying when the main landing-gear truck-tilt angle is not at the ground position. Aviation writer Macarthur Job has stated that &quot;had that Boeing 767 been of an earlier version of the type, fitted with engines that were controlled mechanically rather than electronically, then that accident could not have happened&quot;.

=== Lauda&#x27;s visit with Boeing ===
Lauda stated: &quot;What really annoyed me was Boeing&#x27;s reaction once the cause was clear. Boeing did not want to say anything.&quot; He asked Boeing to fly the scenario in a simulator using data different to that which Lauda had employed in his tests at Gatwick Airport. Boeing initially refused, but Lauda insisted, so Boeing granted permission. Lauda attempted the flight in the simulator 15 times, and in every instance, he was unable to recover. He asked Boeing to issue a statement, but the company&#x27;s legal department replied that it would take three months to adjust the wording. Lauda asked for a press conference the following day and told Boeing that if it was possible to recover, he would be willing to fly a 767 with two pilots and have the thrust reverser deploy in air. Boeing told Lauda that it was not possible, so he persuaded Boeing to issue a statement saying that such a scenario would not be survivable. Lauda then added that &quot;this was the first time in eight months that it had been made clear that the manufacturer [Boeing] was at fault and not the operator of the aeroplane [or Pratt and Whitney]&quot;.

=== Previous testing of thrust reversers ===
When the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) asked Boeing to test activating the thrust reverser in flight, the FAA had allowed Boeing to devise the tests. Boeing had insisted that a deployment was not possible in flight. In 1982, Boeing conducted a test in which the aircraft was flown at , slowed to , and then the test pilots deployed the thrust reverser. The control of the aircraft was not jeopardized, and the FAA accepted the results of the test.

The Lauda aircraft was travelling at a TAS speed of () at in the climb to when the left thrust reverser deployed, causing the pilots to lose control of the aircraft. James R. Chiles, author of &quot;Inviting Disaster&quot;, said: &quot;[T]he point here is not that a thorough test would have told the pilots Thomas J. Welch and Josef Thurner what to do. A thrust reverser deploying in flight might not have been survivable, anyway. But a thorough test would have informed the FAA and Boeing that thrust reversers deploying in midair was such a dangerous occurrence that Boeing needed to install a positive lock that would prevent such an event.&quot;

==Passengers and crew==
The passengers and crew included 83 Austrians: 74 passengers and 9 crew members. Other nationalities included 52 Hong Kong residents, 39 Thai, 10 Italians, 7 Swiss, 6 Chinese, 4 Germans, 3 Portuguese, 3 Taiwanese, 3 Yugoslavs, 2 Hungarians, 2 Filipinos, 2 Britons, 3 Americans (two passengers and the captain), 1 Australian, 1 Brazilian, 1 Pole and 1 Turk.

First officer Josef Thurner had once flown as a copilot with Niki Lauda on a Lauda Air Boeing 767 service to Bangkok, a flight that was the subject of a &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; article in January 1990 that depicted the airline positively. Macarthur Job stated that Thurner was the better known of the crew members. Captain Thomas J. Welch lived in Vienna but was originally from Seattle, Washington.

Notable victims included:
* Clemens August Andreae, an Austrian economics professor, was leading a group of students from the University of Innsbruck on a tour of the Far East.
* Pairat Decharin, the governor of Chiang Mai province, and his wife. Charles S. Ahlgren, the former U.S. consul general to Chiang Mai, said: &quot;That accident not only took their lives and that of many of Chiang Mai&#x27;s leaders, but dealt a blow to many development and planning activities in the town.&quot;
* Princess Phongkaeo of Chiang Mai (Chet Ton dynasty).

==Aftermath==

About a quarter of the airline&#x27;s carrying capacity was destroyed as a result of the crash. Following the crash of OE-LAV, the airline operated no flights to Sydney on 1, 6 and 7 June. Flights resumed with another 767 on 13 June. Niki Lauda said that the crash and the ensuing period constituted the worst time in his life, even worse than the recovery from injuries that he had sustained after a crash in the 1976 German Grand Prix. After the Flight 004 crash, bookings from Hong Kong decreased by 20%, but this was offset by an increase in bookings by passengers based in Vienna.

In early August 1991, Boeing issued an alert to airlines stating that more than 1,600 late-model 737s, 747s, 757s and 767s had thrust-reverser systems similar to that of OE-LAV. Two months later, customers were asked to replace potentially faulty valves in the thrust-reverser systems that could cause reversers to deploy in flight.

At the crash site, which is accessible to national park visitors, a shrine was erected to commemorate the victims. Another memorial and cemetery is located at Wat Sa Kaeo Srisanpetch, about away in Mueang Suphan Buri district.

==In popular culture==
The crash of Flight 004 was featured in an edition of ITV&#x27;s The Cook Report entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot the Pilot&quot; in 1993 &amp; in the second episode of Season 14 of the Canadian documentary television series &quot;Mayday&quot;, titled &quot;Testing the Limits&quot;.

<text>A museme is a minimal unit of musical meaning, analogous to a morpheme in linguistics, &quot;the basic unit of musical expression which in the framework of one given musical system is not further divisible without destruction of meaning.&quot; A museme may:
:be broken down into component parts which are not in themselves meaningful within the framework of the musical language...but are nevertheless basic elements (not units) of musical expression which, when altered, may be compared to the phonemes of speech in that they alter the museme (morpheme) of which they are part and may thereby also alter its meaning.

The term was brought to popularity by Philip Tagg, derived from the work of Charles Seeger.

Musematic repetition (&quot;repetition of musemes&quot;) is simple repetition &quot;at the level of the short figure, often used to generate an entire structural framework.&quot; and contrasted with discursive repetition, in which the repetition is not so precise.

<text>The  was the youngest of the four shinnōke, branches of the Imperial Family of Japan which were eligible to succeed to the Chrysanthemum Throne in the event that the main line should die out. It was founded by Prince Naohito, the son of Emperor Higashiyama.

Fearing extinction of the Imperial Line, Arai Hakuseki proposed that a new branch of the Imperial Family be created. In 1718, retired emperor Reigen bestowed upon his grandson the title of Kan&#x27;in-no-miya and land worth 1000 &quot;koku. &quot; This was the first new shinnōke formed since the Arisugawa-no-miya lineage in 1625.

The name Kan&#x27;in-no-miya is thought to have come from the title of Prince Sadamoto, a son of the Heian-era Emperor Seiwa.

Arai Hakusei&#x27;s wisdom was soon proved with the second Kan&#x27;in-no-miya, Sukehito shinnō. When Emperor Go-Momozono died, he had only a single daughter. Sukehito&#x27;s son was chosen to become Emperor Kōkaku.

The Kan&#x27;in House became extinct upon the death of its 5th head, Prince Kan&#x27;in Naruhito, in 1842, but was revived by Emperor Meiji, who assigned the name to Prince Kotohito, 16th son of Prince Fushimi Kuniie (one of the other &quot;shinnoke&quot; houses).

The line became extinct again with the death of his son, Kan&#x27;in Sumihito (formerly Kan&#x27;in-no-miya Haruhito shinnō) in 1988.

<text>Ensign John R. Monaghan (26 March 1873 – 1 April 1899) was an officer in the United States Navy.

==Biography==
Born in Chewelah, Washington Territory Monaghan was a part of the first graduating class of Gonzaga University, and ultimately graduated from the Naval Academy in June 1895. For the next two years, as a Passed Midshipman, he served in the cruiser , flagship of the U.S. Asiatic Station. Promoted to the rank of Ensign in July 1897, he was next assigned to the monitor and gunboat , both of which operated along the West Coast of the Americas. In July 1898, during the Spanish–American War, he became an officer of the cruiser , which was then the Pacific Station&#x27;s flagship.

In March 1899 Ensign Monaghan, onboard &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, was sent to the troubled Samoan Islands. On 1 April, while serving ashore with a combined unit of British, Americans and Samoans, his force was ambushed by another group of rebel Samoans. When his unit&#x27;s leader, Lieutenant Philip Lansdale, was wounded, Ensign Monaghan seized a rifle and attempted to rescue the injured officer.

The official report of the action stated: &quot;The men were not in sufficient numbers to hold out any longer, and they were forced along by a fire which it was impossible to withstand. Ensign Monaghan did stand. He stood steadfast by his wounded superior and friend—one rifle against many, one brave man against a score of savages. He knew he was doomed. He could not yield. He died in heroic performance of duty.&quot;

==Legacy==
A statue commemorating his death was erected in 1906 in downtown Spokane, Washington. The inscription reads:
&quot;During the retreat of the allied forces from the deadly fire and overwhelming number of the savage foe, he alone stood the fearful onslaught and sacrificed his life defending a wounded comrade Lieutenant Philip V. Lansdale United States Navy.&quot;

Legend has it that Monaghan&#x27;s ghost haunts the Monaghan Music Mansion located on Gonzaga University&#x27;s campus.

==Namesake==
Two ships, , have been named for him.

<doc id="1203358" wikidata="Q3534760" url="?curid=1203358" title="Vijaya Kumaratunga">
<text>Kovilage Anton Vijaya Kumaranatunga (; ; 9 October 1945 – 16 February 1988), popularly known as Vijaya Kumaratunga&quot;,&quot; was a Sri Lankan actor, playback singer and politician regarded as one of the most popular icons in Sri Lankan cinema of all time. He was married to former Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaranatunga from 1978 until his assassination in 1988. He was the founder of Sri Lanka Mahajana Party.

== Early life ==
Kovilage Anton Vijaya Kumaranatunga was born on 9 October 1945, at the government hospital in Ragama to Roman Catholic parents. His father was Kovilage Benjamin Kumaratunga, a village headmen and mother was Clara Beatrice Perera. The youngest of four siblings, Vijaya had two elder brothers: Sydney and Vivian and one elder sister: Rupa. He received his primary education at Seeduwa Davisamara Maha Vidyalaya, secondary education at St. Benedict&#x27;s College, Kotahena and De Mazenod College, Kandana. During his school days, he excelled at singing, drama and oratory. Following his schooling, Kumaratunga joined the Ceylon Police Force as a Sub Inspector, but left soon after.

== Film career ==
He first appears in a lead role as a university student named Bandu in the 1969 blockbuster &quot;Hanthane Kathawa&quot; directed by Sugathapala Senarath Yapa. But according to local film historians, the first time he acted in front of a camera was in the film &quot;Manamalayo&quot; three years ago. Although a Romeo and Juliet story was made in 1969, he was not the lead actor.

In a career that spanned nearly two decades, he contributed to more than 120 films, 114 of which starred the protagonist. Some of his most popular films include &quot;Ahas Gauwa&quot; (1974), &quot;Eya Den Loku Lamayek&quot; (1975), &quot;Ponmani&quot; (1977), &quot;Bambaru Avith&quot; (1977), &quot;Ganga Addara&quot; (1980), &quot;Baddegama&quot; (1980), &quot;Paradige&quot; (1980), &quot;Maha Gedara&quot; (1980), &quot;Kedapathaka Chaya&quot; (1989), and &quot;Kristhu Charithaya&quot; (1990). He acted in one English-language film, &quot;The God King&quot;, and one Tamil film, &quot;Nanguram&quot;. Meanwhile, the Vijaya-Malini era also came to the fore when he became the dream boy in the 1980s Sinhala cinema. According to the critic Gamini Weragama, Vijaya&#x27;s performance in the film &quot;Maruwa Samaga Wase&quot; is close to Toshiro Mifune&#x27;s supernatural role in &quot;Rashomon&quot;.

He also performed as a playback singer in several films; recorded more than 100 songs; and produced two films, &quot;Waradata Danduwam&quot; and &quot;Samawa&quot; which was released after his death. From 1983 to 1988 (once after the assassination) he was a consistently popular actor at six Sarasaviya Award Ceremonies. But he received the award for the Best Actor only for the role in &quot;Kedapathaka Chaya&quot; at the OCIC and the Swarna Sankha Festival in 1989, but he was not fortunate enough to see it. After two years of demise, he won the Sarasaviya Award for Best Playback singer for his song &#x27;Walakulak Gena Muwa Karumu Hiru&#x27; for &quot;Saharawe Sihiniya&quot; and his song &#x27;Sara Guwana Vida Neguna&#x27; for the &quot;Dolos Mahe Pahana&quot;. The only proof that he turned to singing as well as songwriting is the song &#x27;Mulu Hadinma Oba Hata Adarei&#x27;.

== Political career ==
In 1974, Kumaratunga started his political career in the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP). He later joined the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and became its vice secretary.

In 1977, he ran unsuccessfully for the Katana seat in Parliament. Five years later, he was active in the 1982 presidential campaign of Hector Kobbekaduwa. After the election, he was accused of being a Naxalite and jailed under the emergency regulations of President J. R. Jayewardene, but he was never charged.

He ran as the SLFP candidate in a by-election in Mahara in 1983 and was threatened by United National Party (UNP) supporters. An attempt was made on his life, and one of his friends was killed. Kumaratunga won the first vote count, and a recount was ordered. At that point, a blackout occurred at the counting centre. By the time electricity was restored, the UNP candidate had recorded a victory by a few votes. The opposition alleged that someone had &quot;eaten some of Vijaya&#x27;s votes to ensure UNP victory&quot;.

On 22 January 1984 he founded the Sri Lanka Mahajana Party (SLMP) and became its first national organizer, which campaigned for peace in the Sri Lankan Civil War. Under his new party, he contested a Minneriya by-election and finished second, behind the UNP candidate—relegating his old party, SLFP, to third place. The SLMP went on to contest several other by-elections, including in Kundasale and Habaraduwa, but did not live up to expectations.

in 1986, Kumaranatunga visited Jaffna, then controlled by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). He visited the Nallur Murugan Temple and met with local Tamil civilians, as well as several LTTE youth leaders.

In his final public address, to a large crowd in Colombo&#x27;s Campbell Park on 28 January 1988, Kumaratunga lashed out at the UNP, SLFP, and Janatha Vimuthki Peramuna (JVP) parties for failing to address the needs of the hour. He also voiced concerns about the SLFP&#x27;s links with the JVP, a Marxist–Leninist party involved in two armed uprisings against the Sri Lankan government.

In 1988, the SLMP reached an agreement with several other left-wing parties—including the LSSP, Nava Sama Samaja Party (NSSP), Sri Lanka Communist Party, and Eelam People&#x27;s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF)—to form the United Socialist Alliance (USA). A few days prior to the establishment of the new alliance, Kumaranatunga was assassinated. The agreement was signed by party leaders at his funeral.

The USA won a large number of seats in the newly formed provincial councils in an election boycotted by the main opposition SLFP. However, in the 1988 presidential election, the USA candidate, Ossie Abeygunasekera, finished in last place. In the 1989 parliamentary elections, USA candidates won three seats, but none of the winners represented the SLMP.

== Personal life ==
On 20 February 1978, Kumaratunga married Chandrika Bandaranaike, with whom he had two children. Bandaranaike was the daughter of two former prime ministers, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike and Sirimavo Bandaranaike, and would later become president of Sri Lanka. He is adored as an honest politician, talented actor and singer and more importantly as a very good human.

== Death and funeral ==
Kumaratunga was shot in the head with a Type 56 assault rifle outside his home on the outskirts of Colombo on 16 February 1988 by Lionel Ranasinghe, alias Gamini. Ranasinghe confessed to the murder under questioning by the Criminal Investigation Department. In a 141-page statement, he said he had been carrying out orders given to him by the Deshapremi Janatha Viyaparaya (Patriotic People&#x27;s Movement), the military arm of the JVP, which was responsible for multiple assassinations in the late 1980s. After Chandrika Kumaratunga became President in 1994, she appointed a Presidential Commission of Inquiry which inquired into the assassination, its report alleged that President Ranasinghe Premadasa of the UNP and two government ministers were behind the Kumaranatunga assassination without any direct evidence.

Kumaratunga&#x27;s funeral, on 21 February 1988, attracted huge crowds and was the first funeral to be broadcast live on Sri Lankan television (by the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation). It was held at Independence Square in Colombo as a state funeral, even though he represented the opposition to the UNP government. The day of his assassination is widely known as &quot;The Horrible Tuesday&quot; or &quot;The Darkest Tuesday in Sri Lankan History&quot; (He was assassinated on a Tuesday). His death is still mourned by many people in Sri Lanka.

<text>Larry Clifton Perkins (born 18 March 1950) is a former racing driver and V8 Supercar team owner from Australia.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Growing up on a farm in Cowangie in the Mallee region of Victoria, Larry, the son of racing driver Eddie Perkins who had won the 1956 RedeX Round Australia Trial and maternal nephew of Bathurst 500-winner George Reynolds, developed a love for cars from a young age and loved tinkering with the farm machinery. In 1970 he was recruited as a mechanic/driver for Harry Firth&#x27;s Holden Dealer Team, and although he didn&#x27;t do much road racing for the team, he did race in Rallycross alongside team driver Peter Brock, and was also involved with the development of the stillborn Holden LJ Torana GTR XU-1 V8 project which was canned in mid-1972 by the &quot;Supercar scare&quot;.

===Racing career===
After winning the TAA Formula Ford &quot;Driver To Europe&quot; Series in 1971 and the Australian Formula 2 Championship in 1972 (both times in an Elfin 600), Perkins travelled to Europe where he won the 1975 European Formula Three Championship. He also raced in Formula One during the 1974, 1976 and 1977 seasons. After failing to secure a permanent drive in Formula One he returned to Australia, winning the Rothmans International Series in 1979 in an Elfin MR8 for the Ansett Team Elfin factory team run by Elfin Sports Cars founder Garrie Cooper, and the 1979 Australian Rallycross Championship in a Volkswagen Beetle. During 1982 and 1983 he worked with brother Garry on the construction of The Quiet Achiever solar car. He was one of the drivers of the car during the transcontinental solar crossing of Australia, the car using only a photovoltaic solar cell source. During these years he met with success in Australian Touring Cars and in 1988 he returned to Europe to race at the Le Mans 24 Hour with Tom Walkinshaw Racing, finishing 4th.
After returning home from Europe, Perkins made his Bathurst 1000 debut in 1977 in a Holden LX Torana SS A9X Hatchback where he finished third with Peter Janson. He went on to win the race six times (1982, 1983, 1984, 1993, 1995, 1997), with co-drivers Peter Brock (1982–84), John Harvey (1983) (all for the Holden Dealer Team which by then was owned by Brock with Perkins in charge of race car building and preparation), Gregg Hansford (1993) and in his last two wins in 1995 and 1997 with Russell Ingall, winning each time in an Australian developed Holden Commodore.

Arguably his most memorable win was in the 1995 Tooheys 1000 in which he dropped to last place after a pit stop at the end of the first lap to replace a flat tyre, and subsequently gained the lead with less than 10 laps remaining after the Ford Falcon of Glenn Seton retired having dropped a valve in the engine. Perkins and co-driver Russell Ingall thus became only the second driving combination in the history of the race to recover from last place to win the event. Perkins has however, never won an Australian Touring Car Championship, his best championship results being three fourth places.

===Formula One===

Perkins made his first appearance in Formula One at the 1974 German Grand Prix for Chris Amon Racing. With regular driver and team owner Chris Amon sidelined with sinusitis after just one practice lap, Perkins took over in the AF101, failing to qualify after crashing on the second day of practice.

In 1976 he signed a deal with the works Boro team, for the team&#x27;s first season. He made his first Formula One start at the Spanish Grand Prix, finishing 13th before achieving a seasons best result of 8th at the following race in Belgium. He failed to qualify at Monaco and retired from the Swedish Grand Prix after blowing an engine. With the team&#x27;s money drying up, Perkins only made two further appearances in a Boro, retiring from the Dutch and Italian Grands Prix, and after Boro&#x27;s withdrawal, was left without a drive. He replaced Carlos Reutemann at Brabham for the final three races of the year, finishing in 17th position in Canada and retiring from the remaining two races.

For the beginning of 1977, the Australian secured a drive for Stanley BRM, the remnants of the once great BRM team. After his car failed to be delivered on time for the opening Grand Prix, he made his first appearance at the Brazilian Grand Prix, albeit 12.1 seconds off the pace and retiring after one lap. Lapped five times before finishing 15th in South Africa, Perkins lost his seat to Conny Andersson at the beginning of the European season. He had a brief stint at Surtees, finishing 12th in Belgium and failing to qualify in Sweden. At the French Grand Prix, he drove in Friday practice, but was replaced by Patrick Tambay the next day. This marked the end of Perkins&#x27; brief and unsuccessful Formula One career.

===Retirement and legacy===
Perkins retired from driving in 2003, aged 53 and was inducted into the V8 Supercars Hall of Fame in 2008. In addition to his racing credentials as a driver he is an accomplished automotive engineer and engine-builder having built many race cars for both his own team and for other racing teams. He is well known for his outgoing and humorous personality. His nickname is &quot;LP&quot;, but he is often referred to as &quot;Lightning Larry&quot; or &quot;Larrikin Larry&quot;. Larry is the father of V8 Supercar race winner Jack Perkins.

On 7 December 2017, the &quot;Larry Perkins Trophy&quot; was named in his honour. It is awarded to the driver who accumulates the most points across the four races at the Beaurepaires Melbourne 400, the Supercars event supporting the Australian Grand Prix.

In 2018 Perkins and his brother Peter discovered the lost cache of equipment left behind in the Simpson Desert by explorers Henry Vere Barclay and Ronald MacPherson in 1904. The explorers had been forced to abandon the load, which included camel tanks, tools, scientific equipment and personal belongings, in order to cross sandhills to get to a water source. The Perkins&#x27; discovery was described as a &quot;highly significant archaeological find&quot;.

In the 2021 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours Perkins was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for &quot;significant service to motorsport as a touring car driver and team owner&quot;.

<text>Flaxmere () is a township in the Hastings District and outlying suburb of Hastings City, in the Hawke&#x27;s Bay Region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. 

==History==
The original European owner of the land was Sir William Russell, for many years of local member of parliament and Leader of the Opposition from 1894 to 1901. Russell called his estate Flaxmere. When Hastings City Council needed to expand, subdivision of the land started in 1963 and in the following year, the area was incorporated into the area held by the (then) city council. The subdivision was named after the original estate name. Russell&#x27;s son, Harold Russell, inherited a homestead &quot;Little Flaxmere&quot; and land that was part of original estate. This is today located in nearby Twyford.

For the subdivision Hastings City Council bought , which had zoned for industry, 40 acres for Flaxmere Park and for Flaxmere Shopping Centre, including a car park for about 600 cars.

==Demographics==
Flaxmere covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Before the 2023 census, Flaxmere had a smaller boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Flaxmere had a population of 11,142 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 1,623 people (17.1%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 1,203 people (12.1%) since the 2006 census. There were 2,949 households, comprising 5,439 males and 5,697 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.95 males per female, with 3,408 people (30.6%) aged under 15 years, 2,685 (24.1%) aged 15 to 29, 4,002 (35.9%) aged 30 to 64, and 1,035 (9.3%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 36.5% European/Pākehā, 59.1% Māori, 24.4% Pacific peoples, 2.0% Asian, and 0.6% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 12.6, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 41.6% had no religion, 41.9% were Christian, 7.1% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.3% were Hindu, 0.3% were Muslim, 0.4% were Buddhist and 1.6% had other religions.

<text>The Big Banana is a tourist attraction and amusement park (&#x27;The Big Banana Fun Park&#x27;) in the city of Coffs Harbour, New South Wales, Australia. The grounds of the park are set amongst a banana plantation, featuring a large walk-through banana. Built in 1964, it was one of Australia&#x27;s first Big Things. Other attractions include a downhill toboggan ride, ice skating rink, XD Theatre, Mini Golf, Giant Slide, Laser Tag, a water park, the World of Bananas educational experience, and escape rooms. Plantation tours are also available. On the evening of Australia Day 2014, a disused scenic lookout attraction was destroyed by fire. In keeping with the plantation theme, banana-related products are shown or sold in the park which also has a souvenir shop and restaurant. In January 2014, during the peak tourist season the Big Banana received close to 150,000 visitors. The Big Banana has been a family owned business since it was opened by Betty and John Landi, and Stella and John Enveoldson in 1964.

The original Big Banana has been copied by the Big Bananas at Carnarvon, Western Australia.

In 2011, &quot;Huffington Post&quot; included the Big Banana in their list of the &quot;Top 10 Pieces of Folly Architecture.&quot;

==Attractions==

=== Current ===
Along with the Big Banana which is 15m long, featuring the Giant Slide 82m slide, the site includes laser tag, mini golf, ice skating rink, a theatre providing an educational experience, and a toboggan ride, a water park, a reptile zoo, and escape rooms.

=== Former ===
The park featured three scenic monorail sets driven on a two beam track. The monorail&#x27;s track linked display buildings and transported visitors up the steep slope of the plantation.

In 2005, a broken down set was being pushed by one of the two other sets to a maintenance shed for repairs when the coupling system failed and the broken down set ploughed into the lagoon within the park.

The track passed by a lagoon that featured an animatronic bunyip, which was shut off in 2005 due to budget constraints.

Much of the track remains throughout the park and plantations while the two car sets that remained have been left unattended on tracks each near a disused buildings.

== Postage stamps ==
Australia Post issued a set of 50c postage stamps in 2007 commemorating big things, including the Big Banana. The other big thing stamps were:
* (Big) Golden Guitar at Tamworth, New South Wales
* Big Lobster at Kingston SE, South Australia
* Big Merino (sheep) at Goulburn, New South Wales
* Big Pineapple at Nambour, Queensland

<doc id="1203375" wikidata="Q82462" url="?curid=1203375" title="Samuel Jordan Cabell">
<text>Samuel Jordan Cabell (December 15, 1756August 4, 1818) was an American Revolutionary War officer, planter and Virginia politician who served in the Virginia House of Delegates (from 1785 to 1793) and at the Virginia Ratification Convention of 1788 as an Anti-Federalist and in the United States House of Representatives aligned with the Democratic-Republican (from 1795 to 1803).

==Early life and education==
Cabell was born in what was then Albemarle County in the Colony of Virginia, the son of prominent planter William Cabell and his wife. His grandfather, also William Cabell, had emigrated from Warminister, England to the new world, possibly after visiting the Virginia colony during his service with the Royal Navy as a ship&#x27;s surgeon (although he had no medical degree, medical schools having been formed in the era). In addition to his medical practice, his grandfather became a local undersheriff in Henrico County, then surveyor and coroner slightly to the west upstream along the James River in Gooochland County as he began operating plantations using enslaved labor, and kept moving westward in Virginia, finally dying at a plantation he left his youngest son (this man&#x27;s uncle) in what ultimately became Nelson County. The Virginia General Assembly split Goochland County into Albemarle County in 1844, during his father&#x27;s and grandfathers&#x27; lifetimes, and split Albemarle County several times during his childhood and early adulthood. Young Cabell received a private education suitable to his class, then was sent to the former capital at Williamsburg for higher studies at The College of William &amp; Mary.

==Military service==
The American Revolutionary War interrupted his studies, in part as the College of William &amp; Mary closed during much of the conflict and troops occupied the campus. His father William Cabell was familiar with the college and Williamsburg through his service in the Virginia House of Burgessess, first representing Albemarle County and then Amherst County after its creation in 1760. The elder Cabells sided with patriots and against royal authority, which had led Lord Dunmore to suspend the legislature, after which William Cabell represented Amherst County at four of the five Virginia Conventions as the American Revolutionary War began. Samuel Cabell and his younger brother William Cabell Jr. joined the Revolutionary Army in 1775. The Cabell family recruited a company of riflemen, with his uncle Nicholas Cabell of the &quot;Union Hills&quot; plantation as their Colonel. However Nicholas Cabell was then appointed a commissioner to settle various claims in Virginia&#x27;s &quot;southern district&quot; (Pittsylvania, Augusta, Botetourt and Bedford Counties). Thus, in 1776, the Amherst County Volunteers elected this Samuel Cabell captain and state officials assigned the unit to the 6th Virginia Regiment led by Col. Charles Lewis of Albemarle County and who marched with a group of Hanover County volunteers led by Col. Samuel Meredith and Patrick Henry to Gwynn Island to seize the powder previously commandeered by Lord Dunmore. Capt. Cabell participated in the Battle of Saratoga in 1777 and was promoted to the rank of major. He served in George Washington’s army in 1778–1779 and received a promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel. However, at the Siege of Charleston on May 12, 1780, Col. Cabell was captured and in British custody at Haddock&#x27;s Point until the war&#x27;s end, returning home on August 21, 1781.

==Career==
After the war, Cabell operated plantations using enslaved labor, as did his father, and also served (sometimes with his father) as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from 1785 to 1792. In 1788 Amherst county voters elected Cabell and his father to represent them in the Virginia Ratification Convention, where both Cabells (like Patrick Henry) voted against the proposed United States Constitution, although the convention as a whole ratified it. Samuel Cabell then persuaded fellow Anti-Federalist and Continental Army veteran James Monroe to run against James Madison for the position of U.S. Representative for the extensive district that ran from Amherst County in southwest Virginia to Spotsylvania County in the Northeast, thus extending the future President&#x27;s political experience. Meanwhile, Matthew Clay, a relative of future U.S. Senator Henry Clay succeeded to Cabell&#x27;s congressional seat in the 1802 election, and his cousin William H. Cabell had succeeded Cabell&#x27;s younger brother in the Virginia House of Delegates and began a career which would include service as Virginia&#x27;s governor and presiding judge of what later would be called the Virginia Supreme Court.

==Death and legacy==
Samuel Cabell died in 1818 on his estate Soldier&#x27;s Joy at Wingina in Nelson County. Many of the family papers are held by the University of Virginia Library.

<doc id="1203384" wikidata="Q2829309" url="?curid=1203384" title="Al Campanis">
<text>Alexander Sebastian Campanis (Greek: Αλέξανδρος Σεβαστιανός Καμπάνης; November 2, 1916 – June 21, 1998) was an American executive in Major League Baseball (MLB). He had a brief major league playing career, as a second baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1943; he was the first Greek player in MLB history. Campanis is most famous for his position as general manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers from 1968 to 1987, from which he was fired on April 8, 1987, as a result of controversial remarks regarding black people in baseball made during an interview on &quot;Nightline&quot; two days earlier.

==Early life==
Al Campanis was born to Greek-speaking parents in Kos, a small island within the Dodecanese Islands, on November 2, 1916. Kos has been part of Greece since 1947, although, at the time of Campanis&#x27; birth, it belonged to Italy.

He moved with his family to New York City at age 6. He attended New York University, graduating in 1940.

==Baseball==
After graduating, Campanis became a professional baseball player, signing with the Brooklyn Dodgers. He was sent to play with several minor league teams: the Macon Peaches in 1940, Reading Brooks in 1941, Knoxville Smokies in 1942, and Montreal Royals in 1943. He eventually played for the Brooklyn Dodgers as a second baseman for seven games late in their 1943 season. He then served in the U.S. Navy in World War II, reaching the rank of Chief Petty Officer.

After returning from the war, Campanis rejoined the Montreal Royals. With Montreal in 1946, Campanis played 116 games at shortstop and was teammates with Jackie Robinson, who played 119 games at second base. Campanis remained with Montreal in 1947, while Robinson played for the Dodgers, breaking the baseball color line. Campanis&#x27; final season playing professional baseball was 1948, when he was player-manager of the Nashua Dodgers in New Hampshire. Pitcher Dan Bankhead, who in 1947 had become the first African American pitcher in MLB, won 20 games for Nashua in 1948.

Campanis soon afterward became a scout for the Dodgers, then eventually their scouting director. While a scout, he notably discovered future Hall of Famers Roberto Clemente and Sandy Koufax. Campanis moved with the team to Los Angeles when they became the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1958.

In 1968, Campanis became the Dodgers&#x27; general manager. In one of his first trades as general manager, Campanis traded his own son Jim, to the Kansas City Royals for two minor leaguers. Under Campanis, the Dodgers reached the World Series four times: 1974, 1977, 1978, and 1981. They lost the first three, before finally winning in 1981.

==Racially insensitive comments==
The impetus for Campanis being invited onto &quot;Nightline&quot; came because of timing. On that day of April 6, 1987, the Marvin Hagler vs. Sugar Ray Leonard middleweight championship fight was occurring in Las Vegas, and the end of the fight would coincide roughly around the time that the show would be televised, which provided the program with a chance to attract viewers by stating the outcome of the fight live. A network editor provided the suggestion to do a tribute piece on Jackie Robinson as a way to fill time before finding out the winner of the fight, since the 40th anniversary of Robinson&#x27;s debut in the majors was on the 15th. The tribute would have a taped package with announcer Red Barber and Rachel Robinson for the taped segment while having a live conversation with Don Newcombe, Roger Kahn and Campanis (as suggested by producer Rick Kaplan) that would have each person chime in from different places in the country. However, Campanis would end up being the only one to be able to make the full segment, as Newcombe suffered a late plane arrival and Kahn had trouble with floods, complete with Campanis being filmed for his segment at the Astrodome (where the Dodgers were playing that night); it was stated later that people around Campanis were wary of the idea of him being interviewed by host Ted Koppel, since Campanis was described as having a tendency of &quot;mangling the language&quot; with confusing statements. The segment with Campanis started after the taped portion ended, which closed with Rachel Robinson stating, &quot;It&#x27;s not coincidental that baseball in the 40-year period has not been able to integrate at any other level other than the players&#x27; level - we have a long way to go.&quot;

Campanis, who had played alongside Robinson and was known for being close to him, was being interviewed about the subject. &quot;Nightline&quot; anchorman Ted Koppel asked him why, at the time, there had been few black managers and no black general managers or owners in Major League Baseball. Campanis&#x27;s reply was: &quot;I truly believe that they may not have some of the necessities to be, let&#x27;s say, a field manager, or, perhaps, a general manager.&quot; Later in the interview, to defend his views when pressed by Koppel, Campanis asked: &quot;Why are black men or black people not good swimmers? Because they don&#x27;t have the buoyancy.&quot; Koppel gave Campanis several opportunities to clarify or back down from his remarks, asking Campanis several times, &quot;Do you really believe that?&quot; Koppel also pointed out that much of what Campanis was saying &quot;sounds a lot like the garbage we heard 40 years ago.&quot; Campanis doubled down on his views, suggesting that African Americans &quot;certainly are short&quot; on individuals with strong decision-making capabilities, asking Koppel: &quot;How many quarterbacks do you have? How many pitchers do you have that are black?&quot; Campanis was fired less than 48 hours later.

The controversy was especially heated when it was pointed out that Campanis had participated in the decision over who would replace Walter Alston as the manager of the Dodgers. It had been a choice between the two coaches at the time, Tommy Lasorda and Jim Gilliam, and it raised the question of whether Gilliam had been passed over because he was black.

In an interview the next year, Campanis attempted to clarify that he was referring to the lack of African-Americans with experience in these areas, rather than their innate abilities. He also said that he was &quot;wiped out&quot; when the interview took place and therefore not entirely himself. Many other figures in baseball, such as Lasorda and African-American and Latin players who played for the Dodgers, have also spoken in Campanis&#x27;s defense.

Two months after the episode aired, Major League Baseball hired sociologist and civil right activist Harry Edwards to begin a diversity-increasing initiative among leadership in the sport. Edwards stated later that one of the first people to call him was Campanis, who asked how he could help and that if his comments opened the door for help, then &quot;it was worth it.&quot; Edwards later said of Campanis:

In 1988, Campanis himself added similarly: &quot;Time has diffused the immediate hurt of April 6&quot;, and that &quot;It has turned out to be a plus for baseball and myself.&quot;

==Personal life and family==
Campanis had two sons, baseball player Jim and George.

===Death===
Campanis died on June 21, 1998, at his home in Fullerton, California, from coronary artery disease, at age 81. Campanis was survived by his sons, George and Jim, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. He was interred in the mausoleum crypt at Loma Vista Memorial Park in Fullerton.

<text>Ann Philippa Pearce OBE FRSL (22 January 1920 – 21 December 2006) was an English author of children&#x27;s books. Best known of them is the time-slip novel &quot;Tom&#x27;s Midnight Garden&quot;, which won the 1958 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, as the year&#x27;s outstanding children&#x27;s book by a British subject. Pearce was a commended runner-up for the Medal a further four times.

==Early life==
Ann Philippa Pearce was the youngest of four children of a flour miller and corn merchant, Ernest Alexander Pearce, and his wife Gertrude Alice &quot;née&quot; Ramsden, who lived at the Mill House by the River Cam in the village of Great Shelford, Cambridgeshire, where she was brought up. She started school only at the age of eight because of illness, then she went on to attend the Perse School for Girls in Cambridge and win a scholarship to Girton College, Cambridge to read English and History.

After gaining her degree, Pearce moved to London, where she found work as a civil servant. Later she wrote and produced schools&#x27; radio programmes for the BBC, where she remained for 13 years. She was a children&#x27;s editor at the Oxford University Press from 1958 to 1960 and at the André Deutsch publishing firm from 1960 to 1967.

==Writing career==
In 1951 Pearce spent a long period in hospital recovering from tuberculosis. She passed the time there thinking about a canoe trip she had taken many years before, which became the inspiration for her first book, a 241-page novel &quot;Minnow on the Say&quot;, published by Oxford in 1955 with illustrations by Edward Ardizzone. The book was a commended runner-up for the annual Carnegie Medal. Like several of her subsequent books, it was inspired by the area where she had grown up: the villages of Great and Little Shelford became Great and Little Barley. Cambridge became Castleford in the book (nothing to do with the real town of the same name in West Yorkshire) and lost its university; the River Cam became the River Say. &quot;Minnow&quot; was published in the US as &quot;The Minnow Leads to Treasure&quot; (1958). It was adapted for television in Canada as a 1960 TV series with the original title, and for British television in 1972 as &quot;Treasure over the Water&quot;.

Pearce&#x27;s second book was &quot;Tom&#x27;s Midnight Garden&quot;, published by Oxford in 1958. Its &quot;midnight garden&quot; was based directly on the garden of the Mill House where Pearce was raised. Pearce&#x27;s advance for it was £1,000, which she thought &quot;colossal&quot;. The novel has become one of the classic time-slip stories for children, initiated by Alison Uttley with &quot;A Traveller in Time&quot; in 1939. &quot;Tom&#x27;s Midnight Garden&quot; inspired a film, a stage play and three TV series. It won the annual Carnegie Medal and for the 70th anniversary celebration in 2007, a panel named it one of the top ten Medal-winning works, which composed the ballot for a public election of the nation&#x27;s favourite, in which &quot;Tom&#x27;s Midnight Garden&quot; finished second in the vote, between two books that were about 40 years younger.

Pearce wrote over thirty books, including &quot;A Dog So Small&quot; (1962), &quot;The Squirrel Wife&quot; (1971), &quot;The Battle of Bubble and Squeak&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Way To Sattin Shore&quot; (1983). &quot;The Shadow Cage and other tales of the supernatural&quot; (1977), &quot;Bubble and Squeak&quot;, and &quot;Sattin Shore&quot; were the later three of her four Carnegie Medal runners-up. &quot;The Battle of Bubble and Squeak&quot; inspired a two-part television adaptation in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Talk, Write and Read&quot; series of educational programming.

Although not a prolific writer of full-length books, Pearce continued to work over subsequent years, as well as speaking at conferences, editing anthologies and writing short stories. She attended a 2002 reception for children&#x27;s authors at Number 10 Downing Street, the home of the Prime Minister.

In 2004 Pearce published her first new full-length book for two decades, &quot;The Little Gentleman&quot;. One further children&#x27;s novel was published posthumously in 2008: &quot;A Finder&#x27;s Magic&quot;.

==Personal life==
Pearce married Martin Christie in 1962. They had one daughter, who became a children&#x27;s author herself, as Sally Christie. Martin Christie, who had never wholly recovered from being a Japanese prisoner of war, died in 1964. From 1973 until her death from complications of a stroke in 2006, Philippa Pearce lived once again in Great Shelford, down the lane where she was raised.
==Legacy==
Every September from 2008, the Philippa Pearce Lecture at Homerton College, Cambridge celebrates &quot;excellence in writing for children and to emphasize its continuing vital importance.&quot; The lecturers are children&#x27;s literature authors, scholars or critics, and most of the lectures are published online.

<doc id="1203421" wikidata="Q1420374" url="?curid=1203421" title="King David (film)">
<text>King David is a 1985 American Biblical epic film about the life of David, the second King of the Kingdom of Israel, as recounted in the Hebrew Bible. The film is directed by Bruce Beresford, written by Andrew Birkin and James Costigan, and stars Richard Gere in the title role. The ensemble cast includes Edward Woodward, Alice Krige, Denis Quilley, Cherie Lunghi, Hurd Hatfield, John Castle, Jean-Marc Barr, Christopher Malcolm, and Gina Bellman.

&quot;King David&quot; was released by Paramount in the United States on March 29, 1985, while in other countries it was released in 1986 and 1987. Upon release, the film received mostly negative reviews for its screenplay writing, pace, some of the acting and the action sequences. However, Gere&#x27;s performance and the cinematography were praised. In addition to being a critical failure, the film was also a box-office failure, grossing $5.9 million worldwide against its $21 million production budget.

==Plot==
The film follows the life of David, drawing mainly from biblical accounts, particularly the Books of Samuel, 1 Chronicles, and the Psalms of David.

In 1000 B.C., King Saul of Israel breaks his covenant with God after failing to destroy the Amalekites. The prophet Samuel declares Israel will need a new king, and anoints David, the youngest son of Jesse. David initially rejects the prophecy, asking that God tell him directly.

In the midst of a costly war with the Philistines, Saul summons the young David, per Samuel&#x27;s dying instructions. When the Philistine army challenges the Israelites to fight their champion, a giant named Goliath, the unassuming David volunteers and handily kills him with a rock and sling, winning the respect of his countrymen and the fear of their enemies. David becomes a champion warrior in Saul&#x27;s army and eventually marries the King&#x27;s daughter Michal. But when Saul sees the growing adoration of his people toward David, he fears the young man will usurp him. He orders David be brought to him, but Saul&#x27;s son Jonathan helps David escape.

David seeks refuge with the High Priest Ahimelech, who teaches him the word of God and shows him the Ark of the Covenant, which David is shocked to learn is hidden in a cave. Saul and his army catch up and Ahimelech helps David escape, but is killed by Saul for harboring a fugitive. David spends the next several years as a nomad, developing a loyal following, marrying three wives, and rearing two sons.

Eventually, tired of living on the run, David faces up to Saul, first by sneaking into his camp and stealing his sword, then by confronting him the next day, showing that he spared his life and doesn’t want any more hostility. Saul is humbled, and declares his love for David as a surrogate son. David’s men, however, warn him that the peace will be short-lived and urge him to seek refuge with Achish, Lord of the Philistines. David offers his services as a mercenary in exchange for Achish’s protection, and on the condition that he not be made to fight Saul. Achish agrees on the condition that when David is king of Israel, he will relinquish all captured Philistine land. David vows to be a just ruler, and gives Achish his oath. Saul and Jonathan are eventually killed in battle at Mt. Gilboa, and David is crowned King of Israel.

As king, David displays vanity, egotism, and a disregard for his prophets’ instructions. He unveils plans to build a fanciful temple to house the Ark, which his prophet Nathan opposes on the grounds that it is contrary to God&#x27;s preference for simplicity and humility. When Michal rebukes him, David falls for a woman named Bathsheba. She petitions him for her abuse at the hands of her husband Uriah and his refusal to give her a child. David arranges for Uriah to be killed in battle, and he and Bathsheba marry.

At the wedding reception, his son Absalom kills his half-brother Amnon after learning he raped their half-sister Tamar. David&#x27;s laws deem that Absalom must be put to death, but the King insists he was avenging his sister, and banishes him from the kingdom instead.

David’s prophet Nathan eventually confronts him about Uriah’s death. Fearing God will have her put to death, David pleads with him. Nathan concedes, but tells him that his first-born child with Bathsheba will not live to adulthood. David prays for forgiveness, but their first child dies after seven days. His second-born, Solomon, survives, and is proclaimed by Nathan to be heir to the throne. However, David argues that since Absalom is his eldest son, he is therefore the rightful heir despite his exile.

During his three years of banishment, Absalom develops a following of his own. He campaigns to be made a judge, and fights against injustice on their behalf, against the King. David’s advisors warn that Absalom is a traitor, planning an insurrection against him, but David defends his son.

Elsewhere, Absalom is led to believe that his father has forsaken him, and will declare Solomon as his heir. Absalom is advised to attack the kingdom, and organize an army. Against David’s wishes, his army rides to fight Absalom’s men and is ambushed. While trying to escape, Absalom is killed. David laments the death of his son, and Nathan chastises him for following his own emotions and disobeying God’s law. David is apathetic, but eventually follows the commands delivered by the prophets, and successfully drives the Philistines from Israel. He destroys the model of his Ark temple, the final symbol of his vanity, and goes on to rule his kingdom justly.

After forty years, David anoints Solomon to be the next king. On his deathbed, David instructs his son to rule with his heart, before remembering Jonathan.

===Development===
In July 1978 Michael Eisner of Paramount said he wanted the studio to make a Biblical film for release in 1981. This was a &quot;King David&quot; script. According to Andrew Birkin, who was one of the later writers, the studio were attracted to the story because of its parallels to &quot;Star Wars&quot; with David as Luke Skywalker and Samuel as Obi-Wan Kenobi.

Jeffrey Katzenberg of Paramount met Bruce Beresford at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival when the director was there with &quot;Breaker Morant&quot;. He gave Beresford the script. Beresford &quot;liked the story, didn&#x27;t like the script&quot; so brought in Andrew Birkin &quot;who&#x27;s come up with an outstanding screenplay.&quot;

Birkin felt David&#x27;s story was more ideal for a ten-hour mini series and struggled to include key elements like Samuel. &quot;I found the brutality of the Old Testament hard to take&quot; said Birkin.
&quot;I hadn&#x27;t realized that God&#x27;s commandments were set out so clearly -there&#x27;s no pink pages. It was hard to make God a hero. It was also hard in 1984 to write a film about our late lamented Imperialists. This is not a &quot;Ten Commandments&quot; story of beleaguered people in exile. David was the Cecil Rhodes of Ancient Israel. It was hard to make a case for him, the kind who carved an empire according to the map devised by Abraham.&quot;

Beresford said, &quot;The forces that impinged on David, the decisions he had to make, the relationships he had with people and with God and the way he felt about Him – it becomes fascinating when you follow everything that happened to David from his childhood to his death.&quot;

&quot;What made David fascinating were his strengths and weaknesses&quot;, said Beresford.

Beresford watched a number of Biblical films and was most impressed by &quot;The Gospel According to St Matthew&quot; and &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;.

In June 1982 Beresford said he would make the film for Paramount, after he made &quot;Tender Mercies&quot;. In February 1983 he said the budget would be $16 million and &quot;it&#x27;s got an absolutely wonderful script. I think we&#x27;ve gotten away from all of those old cliches of Hollywood biblical movies.&quot;

&quot;What I want to do is make a different sort of Biblical film&quot;, he said. &quot;The ones Hollywood made in the past were far too reverential. It was as if the moment they got hold of the Bible they became awestruck. The actors fell over themselves to be sententious and all those heavenly choirs and shafts of light... The only way is for actors to speak the lines normally not as if they were inverted commas.&quot;

&quot;Religion has to come into &quot;King David&quot;, because it was part of everybody&#x27;s everyday life then&quot;, said Beresford. &quot;People used to talk about God like we talk about going to a restaurant. They&#x27;d say: &#x27;God did this. God did that.&#x27; But the emotional experiences in the film will be easily recognizable because they&#x27;re so universal.&quot;

Beresford wanted American actors rather than English ones to give the movie a more contemporary feel. The producer said he personally chose Richard Gere to play the lead. However a later report said Beresford wanted to use an unknown and Gere was forced upon him. &quot;Bruce knew what the reaction would be toward Gere in the role&quot;, said the source. &quot;He knew it would be ridiculous, but, once he&#x27;d signed on, he couldn&#x27;t just walk off. He knew that if he did, he&#x27;d never work in Hollywood again.&quot;

The film was originally going to be shot in Israel. Eventually it was decided this was impractical as Israel did not have any buildings older than the Roman Empire. They considered Morocco and Tunisia before settling on Italy.

Beresford wanted to cast Jack Thompson as Saul but was overruled by the producers who wanted Sean Connery. Connery asked for too much money so Edward Woodward was cast.

===Filming===
Filming started in May 1984 in England, by which time the budget was $23 million. Locations included Matera and Craco both in Basilicata, and Campo Imperatore in Abruzzo, the Lanaitto valley (Oliena) in Sardinia, Italy, and at Pinewood Studios in England.

It was a difficult shoot. Both Beresford and Gere came down with viruses. Extras went on strike for more pay. Many locations were remote. The script used was the ninth draft.

&quot;&quot;Normally if you&#x27;re making an ordinary movie and the weather turns bad you say: Oh well, we&#x27;ll shoot tomorrow&quot;, said Beresford. &quot;But if you&#x27;ve got 2,000 extras there and suddenly it starts snowing-as it did with us-it&#x27;s useless saying: I can&#x27;t shoot in this. You&#x27;ve got to because you can&#x27;t get the people back again.&quot;

According to one report &quot;Gere knew Beresford wanted him replaced, and that made for quite a bit of friction on the set. Beresford did what he wanted to do in the scenes where Gere doesn&#x27;t appear, and Gere did what he wanted to do in his scenes. The film ended up as a multi-million dollar joke that everyone thinks is funny except the people who made it and the Paramount investors.&quot;

Beresford later said &quot;The King David script was just never right. We started off on the wrong foot and then it turned into a catalogue of disaster. Really, I don&#x27;t know how I got mixed up in such a mess – I felt like the captain of the Titanic heading toward a critical iceberg and I hit it. It was inevitable.&quot;

==Reception==
The film was not well received by the critics, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling it &quot;not a good film&quot;. Review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a &#x27;rotten&#x27; 8% rating. Richard Gere&#x27;s performance in the film earned him a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actor, which he lost to Sylvester Stallone for &quot;&quot; and &quot;Rocky IV&quot;.

===Box office===
Beresford said &quot;&quot;The film cost $22 million and lost it all – and more. And the minute the movie died, I checked out a list of famous directors who also had works that bombed – to see if they ever got back on the right foot again.&quot;

=== Beresford&#x27;s reaction ===
Years later, Bruce Beresford said of the film:
I think there are a few things in it that are interesting. But, I think there are so many things that are wrong. We never liked the script... we never really caught the friendship between David and Jonathan. There weren&#x27;t enough scenes between them. And David, himself – I think Richard Gere was miscast. He is a wonderful actor but he is much better in contemporary pieces.

<text>A warez group is a tightly organised group of people involved in creating and/or distributing warez such as movies, music or software (&quot;warez&quot;) in The Scene. There are different types of these groups in the Scene: &quot;release groups&quot; and &quot;courier groups&quot;. Groups often compete, as being the first to bring out a new quality release can bring status and respect – a type of &quot;vanity contest&quot;. The warez groups care about the image others have of them.

==Description==
&quot;ANALOG Computing&quot; observed in 1984 that software piracy did not make sense economically to those performing the software cracking. The primary motivation of warez groups is not monetary gain, but the excitement of breaking rules and beating competitors, although at least two Scene groups have been asking for bitcoin donations, PoWeRUp and spamTV. Individual members of these groups are usually also the authors of cracks and keygens.

There are warez groups publishing new content outside of the Scene, often referred to as &quot;P2P groups&quot;. They are a lot more accessible for people with access to new movies and are not limited to a set of rules and regulations.

The FBI have been combating warez groups with Operation: Cyberstrike, Operation Buccaneer, Operation Fastlink, Operation Safehaven and Operation Site Down. Similarly, the P2P group IMAGiNE has been disbanded due to law enforcement actions.

Some game and software groups include Razor 1911, Reloaded, DrinkOrDie, Pirates With Attitude, Class, Myth and Fairlight. For a larger list, see the list of warez groups.

==Release groups==
Release groups are responsible for making warez releases. For example, they rip a movie from DVD (often times, the Region 2/UK DVDs), encode it to a video file and chop it up in smaller pieces before sharing it. They are at the top of the warez world. An announcement of the release shows up in pre databases after making the release available on their affiliate sites. Access to the original software products is necessary to write cracks and keygens so they share original media among each other, usually using private sites and servers. Communication between members happens with IRC.

Warez groups typically add NFO files with their releases. Due to the nature of the scene, not much is known about these groups. Most groups follow one of the different warez standards to prevent being nuked. Most groups are focused on a single category (music, movies, television, ...) or genre (e.g. metal music or graffiti).

The group members have different roles. Most groups have one or more group leaders, aided by people with assignments such as supplier, cracker or ripper.

==Courier groups==
Courier groups take releases and distribute them. This can be done using FXP to FTP sites. There are more couriers in the scene than there are crackers, suppliers and sites combined.

Couriers are a specific class of topsite users who earn their access by uploading new releases and filling requests. When a courier gains access to a topsite, they are often required to pass a trial test such as uploading a certain amount in a short period of time.

Couriers compete (race) against each other for respect, credits, access to other topsites, and fun. Private couriers often operate as independent (iND) couriers. Some couriers band together to form courier groups which provide support and friendship through camaraderie. Although it may be noted that Couriers/Racers are looked down upon more than ever by affiliates and topsite staff with the increase of scripts that perform the couriers tasks automatically.

<text>Svislach or Svisloch (, ; ; ; ) is a town in Grodno Region, Belarus. It serves as the administrative center of Svislach District. It is connected with the town Vawkavysk by a railroad branch and with Grodno city by a highway. As of 2024, it has a population of 6,008.

==History==
Within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Svislach was part of Nowogródek Voivodeship. In 1795, Svislach was acquired by the Russian Empire in the course of the Third Partition of Poland.

In 1927, Rabbi Chaim Yaakov Mishkinsky, whose wife Chaya was the granddaughter of Rabbi Naftali Hertz Halperin of Bialystok, was appointed the rabbi of Svislach. He led the community until the Nazis entered in November 1942 murdering the entire Jewish community. Prior to the war, Rabbi Mishkinsky sent his sons and to Israel (Palestine). Rabbi Mishkinsky&#x27;s great-grandson, Yochanan Chaim Ivry, serves as rabbi of Toras Emes, Staten Island, NY and his great-granddaughter, Batya Yocheved Friedman serves as one of the rebbetzins in Park East Synagogue, NYC 

Svislach was part of the Second Polish Republic from 1921 until 1939. In September 1939, Svislach was occupied by the Red Army and, on 14 November 1939, incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR. In 1939, there were around 3,000 Jews living in Svislach, along with refugees from western Poland who had settled there after the invasion of Poland. From June 1941 until 17 July 1944, Svislach was occupied by Nazi Germany and administered as a part of Bezirk Bialystok. In July 1941, a ghetto was established in the old Jewish neighbourhood, in the northwest of Svislach. In that area, Jews were also gathered from the village of Golobudy. It was an open ghetto, and the western border of the ghetto&#x27;s territory ran near the Svislach River. On November 2, 1942, the ghetto was liquidated when the Jews were sent by train to the Vawkavysk transit camp where many massacres occurred. The remaining Jews, mostly elderly and sick, were killed in the Visnik Forest, just outside Svislach.

He was a cast member and writer on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for eight seasons from 2002 to 2010.

He worked as a writer and producer on &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; and &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, before joining &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

==Early life==
Orville Willis Forte IV was born in Alameda, California, on June 17, 1970. The son of artist and former schoolteacher Patricia C. (&quot;née&quot; Stivers) and financial broker Orville Willis &quot;Reb&quot; Forte III. He grew up in Moraga before moving to Lafayette at age 13. He went by &quot;Billy&quot; in his early years until he was teased at school for it also being a girl&#x27;s name. At that point he decided he would from then on be known as &quot;Will&quot;. Forte described himself as having been a &quot;really happy little boy&quot; whose parents were &quot;wonderful&quot; and created a &quot;very loving environment&quot;. He was interested in comedy from a young age, growing up idolizing comedians Peter Sellers, David Letterman, and Steve Martin as well as the sketch-comedy television series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. He often pulled pranks on his parents, and would record himself performing imaginary radio shows. He did not aim to be a comedian, but initially wanted to become a football player.

Forte was &quot;a laid-back teen with a lot of friends&quot;, and a member of the varsity football and swim teams at Acalanes High School in Lafayette where he graduated in 1988. He was voted &quot;Best Personality&quot; by his graduating class and served as freshman class president. He had no ambitions for a television or film career, though his mother noticed a &quot;creative streak&quot; in him. After high school, he attended the University of California, Los Angeles, where he was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity and completed a degree in history. Forte wanted to become a financial broker like his father at Smith Barney Shearson, but felt &quot;miserable&quot; there. He co-wrote a feature-length script while there, and later said that he discovered he loved writing &quot;more than anything [he] had ever done in [his] life&quot;. He had been encouraged to attempt comedy during his years at university, and he decided to change his career path to do so.

==Career==

Forte began taking classes at The Groundlings in Los Angeles, an improvisational and sketch comedy troupe and school, while tutoring children to make ends meet. His first successful foray into comedy was &quot;101 Things to Definitely Not Do If You Want to Get a Chick&quot;, a comic book he produced about incompetent men. The comics landed him his first professional job writing for &quot;The Jenny McCarthy Show&quot;, a short-lived variety show starring Jenny McCarthy. Shortly thereafter, he was asked to submit a packet to the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and was told Letterman responded favorably to animation. After only nine months at &quot;Letterman&quot;, he was &quot;let go&quot; from the job. He recalled his stint on the program as unpleasant, noting that he did not have enough experience in writing. &quot;What an honor to work at that show but I don&#x27;t think I was fully mentally prepared. [...] I always wonder what it would be like if I&#x27;d had a couple more years of experience before going there.&quot;

Forte left New York and returned to Los Angeles, where he began performing with the Groundlings&#x27; Main Company, with Cheryl Hines, Jim Rash, and Maya Rudolph. He tried stand-up comedy three times, mostly at open mic nights, but quit after being voted into the Main Company. He joined the writing teams of two failed sitcoms, including &quot;The Army Show&quot; and &quot;Action&quot;. Forte got jobs writing for &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; and &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. He loved writing and had mostly given up on acting, aside from acting with the Groundlings. While performing with the troupe in 2001, he was spotted by Lorne Michaels, the creator of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;). Forte felt his confidence was higher than usual, as &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; had been picked up for two more years. He was invited to audition for &quot;SNL&quot;, which he regarded as unexpected.

At his audition for &quot;SNL&quot;, he performed multiple original characters, including Tim Calhoun, a speed reader, a prison guard, in addition to impressions of singer Michael McDonald and actor Martin Sheen. His final character was an older piece from his days with the Groundlings, in which he portrays a gold-painted street performer who performs fellatio to pay for his face paint, which devolves into a song needlessly uttering the words &quot;cock&quot; and &quot;face paint&quot; dozens of times. He felt his time to shine as a performer was already over, as he was in his thirties when he auditioned. To his surprise, he was offered a chance to be on the show, but declined, opting instead for the financial stability of his work at &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. He felt working for &quot;SNL&quot; could not live up to the idealized version he had dreamed of, but he later realized he would be making a mistake.

After Will Ferrell left &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; the following spring, Forte joined the cast, premiering at the beginning of the show&#x27;s twenty-eighth season in the autumn. He was promoted to repertory player after his first year. His early years on the program were characterized by stage fright and an inability to properly interpret sketches that he did not write himself. He had to &quot;re-learn&quot; how to perform after years as a writer, and later felt his natural tendency to &quot;overthink&quot; things improved his performance. He was particularly uncomfortable portraying President George W. Bush, as he felt he was not the best impressionist and it paled in comparison to Ferrell&#x27;s impersonation of Bush. His only role was often Bush, leaving him no chance for more &quot;absurd&quot; pieces he favored. He was nearly fired from the program following his third season (2004–05), but after two three-week extensions to decide his fate, he was brought back. Forte estimated it took five seasons for him to feel fully comfortable performing on the show. He made his film debut in &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot;.

His humor at &quot;SNL&quot; has been described as bizarre, and he became known for many &quot;10-to-1&quot; sketchespieces that were considered odd, placed at the very end of the show. He was also well known for his characters Tim Calhoun, Greg Stink, and the Falconer. Forte&#x27;s favorite sketch on the show was one in which he played a motivational coach alongside football star Peyton Manning. He also co-starred with Andy Samberg in the first &quot;SNL&quot; Digital Short, &quot;Lettuce&quot;. He often spent long hours crafting his sketches for the program, missing deadlines, but his pieces were usually received warmly at table reads. During his time at the show, he co-starred in and wrote the 2007 film &quot;The Brothers Solomon&quot;. The film was originally a pilot for Carsey-Werner, and its creation was an extension of his agreement to terminate his contract to appear on &quot;SNL&quot;.

Forte&#x27;s best-known character on &quot;SNL&quot; was MacGruber, a special operations agent who is tasked in each episode with deactivating a ticking bomb but becomes distracted by personal issues. The sketches were based on the television series &quot;MacGyver&quot;. It was created by writer Jorma Taccone, who relentlessly pitched the idea to Forte. He was initially reluctant to commit to the sketch, deeming it too dumb, but accepted after persuasion from Taccone. The first sketch aired in January 2007, and led to multiple more segments in the following years. In 2009, the sketches were spun off into a series of commercials sponsored by Pepsi premiering during Super Bowl XLIII which featured the actor behind MacGyver, Richard Dean Anderson, as MacGruber&#x27;s father. The advertisements led the character and sketches to receive a wider level of popularity. After the success of the advertisements, creator Lorne Michaels approached Forte, Taccone, and writer John Solomon with the idea to produce a &quot;MacGruber&quot; film.

Regarding his experiences on &quot;SNL&quot;, Forte remarked, &quot;Looking back, the experience is something I&#x27;ll never forget. I still miss it, and I&#x27;ll always miss it. That&#x27;s my family.&quot; His celebrity impressions included George W. Bush, Tom DeLay, John Edwards, Timothy Geithner, Newt Gingrich, Chad Lowe, Zell Miller, David Petraeus, Harry Reid, Brian Williams, and Hu Jintao.

In the summer of 2009, &quot;MacGruber&quot; was shot on a tight schedule for four weeks in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was written while simultaneously producing the weekly episode of &quot;SNL&quot;, and the show&#x27;s production process left the trio deprived of sleep. Forte was positive regarding the film, saying, The film was released in May 2010 and received mixed reviews. It fared worse at the box office, where it failed to recoup its budget and was pulled from theaters after its third week. Forte found the failure tolerable, commenting, &quot;When you make something that you&#x27;re really proud of and it doesn&#x27;t do well, you can live with it.&quot; The film has since seen more of a positive reception and has been dubbed a cult classic.
Forte left &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; shortly before the beginning of the show&#x27;s thirty-sixth season in 2010. He felt it was the &quot;right time to go&quot;, considering his eight-year tenure there, his expansion into film with &quot;MacGruber&quot;, and his age. In addition, his sister had just had children and he wanted to move to the West Coast to be closer to them. He soon regretted the decision, calling the following year an &quot;emotionally trying period&quot;, as he felt &quot;devastated&quot; that he would no longer be on the program. He assumed his shot at a film career was ruined, and he imagined that if acting did not work out, he would return to mostly writing. Afterwards he entered what he has called a &quot;lost period&quot; and had small supporting roles, such as &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy,&quot; and &quot;The Watch&quot;, all of which were not successful. The only commercial successful film which he worked on was &quot;Grown Ups 2&quot;, where he made a cameo as a male cheerleader. He also took a role as Paul L&#x27;astnamé, the cross-dressing boyfriend of Jenna Maroney on the critically acclaimed sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot;.

Forte took his first dramatic role for the 2013 film &quot;Run &amp; Jump&quot;. Director Steph Green offered him the part, and Forte imagined it a &quot;fun thing to try&quot;, though he noted that she had more confidence in him than he had himself. Later, he sent an audition tape to Alexander Payne for a role in his next film, &quot;Nebraska&quot;. He equated his casting in the film to his fear of joining &quot;SNL&quot; a decade prior, noting that he was &quot;terrified&quot; to begin working on it. He felt scared initially, but followed Bruce Dern&#x27;s acting advice to &quot;look for the truth&quot; in each scene—in other words, &quot;In every scene, you&#x27;re just trying to play it as honestly and as real as you can.&quot;

Forte began working on &quot;The Last Man on Earth&quot;, a sitcom, with longtime collaborators Phil Lord and Christopher Miller in 2013. Though it was the duo&#x27;s idea, Forte attached himself to the concept, crafting a treatment over a weekend. The series was pitched around Hollywood to positive responses and was picked up in 2014 by Fox. Forte served as the series&#x27; creator, a writer, the lead role, and showrunner for the first season. He felt odd being in charge of its writing team (composed of longtime friends), and awkward at delegating tasks, so much so that he would end up doing the work himself. Being a showrunner &quot;truly was an amount of work I never knew existed,&quot; he said, which involved him working a &quot;minimum of 12 hours&quot; daily. The series premiered in 2015 to positive responses, and was renewed for the next three seasons.

In 2016, Forte played Hulka, a low-level weed dealer, in the comedy &quot;Keanu&quot;, starring Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key. In 2018, he played &quot;National Lampoon&quot; magazine co-founder Douglas Kenney in the Netflix biographical film &quot;A Futile and Stupid Gesture&quot;. The film was directed by David Wain and features Domhnall Gleeson as co-founder Henry Beard. Forte voiced Shaggy Rogers in the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; film &quot;Scoob!&quot;. In 2021, Forte starred in &quot;Sweet Tooth&quot;, reprised his role as MacGruber in a TV series on Peacock, and began voicing Wolf Tobin in the animated sitcom &quot;The Great North&quot;. In 2022, it was announced that Forte had a leading role for Disney and Pixar&#x27;s first animated television series &quot;Win or Lose&quot;. It is set to premiere on Disney+ in 2025. He voiced an older version of the titular character in &quot;Scott Pilgrim Takes Off&quot;. In 2024, Forte was announced in the main role of Martin in &quot;Sunny Nights&quot;.

==Personal life==
Forte dated his &quot;Last Man on Earth&quot; co-star January Jones in 2015.
He and Olivia Modling were engaged in 2019; they met in 2018. They have two daughters Zoe Douglas Forte, born in February 2021, and Cecilia, born approximately 18 months later. He and Modling married on July 31, 2021. They live in a modestly sized Craftsman home in Santa Monica, California. Forte bought the home in 2002, just two weeks before joining the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; which required him to move to New York City. He admitted later that &quot;it was not the greatest timing.&quot;

Forte&#x27;s mother, Patricia has visited every film set on which he has worked and made an appearance on a Mother&#x27;s Day episode of &quot;SNL&quot;, in which he sang a song to her on &quot;Weekend Update&quot;. Will officiated his sister Michelle&#x27;s wedding; he filmed the birth of his niece and nephew.

Will Forte has discussed and joked about his OCD tendencies. He recounted listening to only one song in his office at &quot;SNL&quot; for an entire year because he wanted to challenge himself. During an interview with Larry King, he discussed his OCD as a challenge he had to overcome but not one he wished he did not have, as it is a part of his personality. In a February 2015 article on &quot;Grantland&quot; the writer of the article said that Forte mentioned OCD often but it was not clear if he had ever been formally diagnosed, though Forte related how he and a former girlfriend had gone through an OCD questionnaire and it concluded that Forte &quot;should immediately talk to someone about this&quot;.

Forte is an avid gamer. While filming &quot;A Good Old-Fashioned Orgy&quot;, he achieved one of the world&#x27;s highest scores on the arcade version of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;.

<text>Monica Mary Gould (born 5 May 1957) is a former Australian politician. She was a Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Council between September 1993 and November 2006, representing Doutta Galla Province.

Gould was born in Melbourne, and finished her secondary studies at a technical college in the suburb of Macleod. She became involved in the Manufacturing Grocers Association trade union, which later merged with the National Union of Workers. In 1980, she became its General Vice-president – a position which she held until her election to parliament. She was also a member of the Australian Council of Trade Unions executive between 1991 and 1993.

In 1993, Gould decided to make a move into politics, and succeeded in securing Labor pre-selection for a by-election in the seat of Doutta Galla Province. During her first term, which was only three years, because of the circumstances of her election, she was a member of the Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee. She was re-elected in 1996, and was subsequently appointed Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council and Shadow Minister for Aged Care. Gould also became a member of both the Law Reform and Legislative Council Privileges Committees.

In the months leading up to the 1999 election, Gould was again promoted – this time to the position of Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council. She was also made responsible for the Housing portfolio. In late 1999, the Labor Party won government, defeating Premier Jeff Kennett&#x27;s Liberal government. Gould continued on as Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council, and continued her rise, becoming the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Minister for WorkCover.

By February 2002, Gould was demoted. She was appointed to the new position of Minister for Education Services and Youth Affairs.

After the 2002 election, Gould was dumped from the ministry. She also lost her position as Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council, being replaced by John Lenders. She was subsequently appointed as the first woman President of the Legislative Council. She retired from Parliament at the 2006 election.

In March 2018 Gould was inducted into the Victorian Honour Roll of Women for her work encouraging women members of the Victorian branch in the Australian Labor Party.

<text>Alban William Housego &quot;A. W.&quot; &quot;Bill&quot; Phillips, MBE (18 November 1914 – 4 March 1975) was a New Zealand economist who spent most of his academic career as a professor of economics at the London School of Economics (LSE). He invented the Phillips curve relating level of employment and inflation in 1958. He also designed and built the MONIAC hydraulic computer macroeconomic model in 1949.

==Early life==
Phillips was born at Te Rehunga near Dannevirke, New Zealand, to Harold Housego Phillips, a dairy farmer, and his wife, Edith Webber, a schoolteacher and postmistress. A mechanical aptitude began to emerge at an early age: at fifteen, Bill learned how to fix a motor vehicle engine, how to wire a shed for electrical lighting, build radios, and create a crude form of cinematography.

He left New Zealand before finishing school to work in Australia at a variety of jobs, including crocodile hunter and cinema manager. In 1937 Phillips headed to China, but had to escape to Russia when Japan invaded China. He travelled across Russia on the Trans-Siberian Railway and made his way to United Kingdom in 1938, where he studied electrical engineering.

==World War II==
At the outbreak of World War II, Phillips joined the Royal Air Force and was sent to Singapore. When Singapore fell, he escaped on the troopship &quot;Empire State&quot;, which came under attack before safely arriving in Java. During the attack, Phillips improvised a machine gun mounting which allowed him to fire at the enemy.

When Java, too, was overrun Phillips was captured by the Japanese, and spent three and a half years interned in a prisoner of war camp in the then Dutch East Indies (Indonesia). During this period he learned Chinese from other prisoners, repaired and miniaturised a secret radio, and fashioned a secret water boiler for tea which he hooked into the camp lighting system. Sir Edward &#x27;Weary&#x27; Dunlop explained that Phillips’ radio maintained camp morale, and that if discovered, Phillips would have faced torture or even death. Laurens van der Post, who was in captivity with Phillips, described him as &quot;one of the most singularly contained people I knew, quiet, true and without any trace of exhibitionism&quot;.

In 1946, he was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his war service, in particular for his development of a system that allowed Brewster Buffalo fighter planes to fire through the propeller.

== Economics career ==

After the war Phillips moved to London and began studying sociology at the London School of Economics (LSE), because of his fascination with prisoners of war&#x27;s ability to organize themselves. But he became bored with sociology and developed an interest in Keynesian theory, so he switched his course to economics and within eleven years was a professor of economics.

===MONIAC===
While a student at the LSE Phillips used his training as an engineer to develop MONIAC (‘Monetary National Income Analogue Computer’), an analogue computer which used hydraulics to model the workings of the British economy, inspiring the term hydraulic macroeconomics. It was very well received and Phillips was soon offered a teaching position at the LSE. He advanced from assistant lecturer in 1951 to professor in 1958.

===Phillips curve===
While at LSE, Phillips&#x27; work focused on British data and observed that in years when the unemployment rate was high, the rate of growth of nominal wages tended to be stable, or possibly fall. Conversely, when unemployment was low, wages rose rapidly. This sort of pattern had been noticed earlier by Irving Fisher, but, based on Phillip&#x27;s intuition that “[w]hen the demand for labour is high and there are very few unemployed we should expect employers to bid wages rates up quite rapidly” and that firms would put up prices as a result, he published his own paper in 1958 on the relationship between inflation and unemployment, a relationship which became known as the Phillips curve.
The Phillips curve can be written of terms of rate of growth of prices and unemployment. It was subject to the study of several Keynesian and neoclassical economists, especially in the context of the monetarist model by Milton Friedman and the new neoclassical macroeconomics by Robert Lucas. 
Several studies around the Phillips curve tried to understand whether it is possible or not for policy makers to exploit the Phillips curve, that is to accept a lower level of employment, and so an higher level of unemployment, in exchange of inflation stabilisation. 
Nowadays there is a still of debate around this concept.

Soon after the publication of Phillips&#x27; paper, the idea that there was a trade-off between a strong economy and low inflation caught the imagination of academic economists and policy-makers alike. Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow wrote an influential article describing the possibilities suggested by the Phillips curve in the context of the United States. What people think of as the Phillips curve has changed substantially over time, but remains an important feature of macroeconomic analysis of economic fluctuations, with his paper on wage inflation and unemployment becoming the most cited macroeconomics title of the 20th Century. Had he lived longer, Phillips&#x27; contributions might have been worthy of a Nobel Prize in economics . He made other contributions to economics related to stabilization policy.

He returned to Australia in 1967 for a position at Australian National University which allowed him to devote half his time to Chinese studies. In 1969 the effects of his war deprivations and smoking caught up with him. He had a stroke, prompting an early retirement and return to Auckland, New Zealand, where he taught a Stage III paper &quot;Chinese Communist Economics since 1949&quot; for 2 years, at the University of Auckland. He died in Auckland on 4 March 1975.

<doc id="1203476" wikidata="Q2845242" url="?curid=1203476" title="Paradigmatic analysis">
<text>Paradigmatic analysis is the analysis of paradigms embedded in the text rather than of the surface structure (syntax) of the text which is termed syntagmatic analysis. Paradigmatic analysis often uses commutation tests, i.e. analysis by substituting words of the same type or class to calibrate shifts in connotation.

==Definition of terms==
In semiotic literary criticism, a syntagm (or syntagma) is a building block of a text into which meaning is encoded by the writer and decoded by the reader, recalling past experience and placing the message in its appropriate cultural context. Individual syntagms can be arranged together to form more complex syntagms: groups of sounds (and the letters to represent them) form words, groups of words form sentences, sentences form narratives, and so on. A list of syntagms of the same type is called a &quot;paradigm&quot;. So, in English, the alphabet is the paradigm from which the syntagms of words are formed. The set of words collected together in a lexicon becomes the paradigm from which sentences etc. are formed. Hence, paradigmatic analysis is a method for exploring a syntagm by identifying its constituent paradigm, studying the individual paradigmatic elements, and then reconstructing the process by which the syntagm takes on meaning.

The importance of paradigmatic relationships and paradigmatic analysis includes contrasting and comparing each of the meanings present in each text in which similar circumstances will be chosen. This helps to define value in the text. The importance of relations of paradigmatic opposition is to help generate an order of dynamic complexity of experience in the past. People have believed in binary opposition since at least classical times: e.g. in Aristotle&#x27;s physics of four elements earth, air, fire and water, the relations among these are all binary oppositions that are believed to make up the world.

==Jakobson and Ritchie==
Roman Jakobson&#x27;s model on the functions of language has two levels of description: 
# the various component elements forming language, and
# what humans do with the language when they use it.
In the first place, every language has a vocabulary and a syntax. Its elements are words with fixed denotative meanings. Out of these one can construct, according to the rules of the syntax, composite symbols with resultant new meanings. Secondly, in a language, some words are equivalent to whole combinations of other words, so that most meanings can be expressed in several different ways. Studies of human perception show that to some extent, what people perceive depends on what they expect to perceive. L. David Ritchie proposes that communication creates relationships between what is perceived or known by one person and what is perceived or known by others; the form of the communication will be determined in part by whether there are pre-existing relationships between the communicator and the audience. The receiver and originator of a message must work from some common understanding of what sorts of patterns are used to communicate and how these patterns are related to other events. Communication has to do with community both in the sense that it relies on having something in common in the first place and in the sense that it can influence what the communicants subsequently have in common.

==Applied to music==
In music, paradigmatic analysis was a method of musical analysis developed by Nicolas Ruwet during the 1960s but later named by others. It is &quot;based on the concept of &#x27;equivalence&#x27;. Ruwet argued that the most striking characteristic of musical syntax was the central role of &quot;repetition&quot; – and, by extension, of varied repetition or &quot;transformation&quot; (Ruwet 1987)&quot; (Middleton 1990/2002, p. 183).

Paradigmatic analysis assumes that Roman Jakobson&#x27;s description of the poetic system (1960, p. 358) applies to music and that in both a &quot;projection of the principle of equivalence from the axis of selection on to the axis of combination&quot; occurs. Thus paradigmatic analyses are able to base the assignment of units entirely on repetition so that &quot;anything repeated (straight or varied) is defined as a unit, and this is true on all levels,&quot; from sections to phrases and individual sounds (Middleton, &quot;ibid&quot;).
