<text>The Inbreds were a Canadian alternative rock band formed in 1992. Originally from Kingston, Ontario, the band relocated to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1996 and remained based there until breaking up in 1998. The band was a duo, consisting of vocalist/bassist Mike O&#x27;Neill and drummer Dave Ullrich.

Three of the four albums released during the band&#x27;s existence reached number one on the Canadian national campus radio charts, and the band received two Juno nominations. The band was prominent in Canadian indie rock circles throughout the 1990s and were known for their unique, minimalist bass and drums approach, and melodies and harmonies which drew on classic pop music influences such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys.

==History==
The Inbreds consisted of singer/songwriter/bassist Mike O&#x27;Neill and drummer Dave Ullrich, and were renowned for their unique bass and drums sound; unlike conventional bass guitar technique, O&#x27;Neill actually played full chords on the instrument, punctuated with single notes that allowed the bass line to sound as though two distinct instruments were being played at once. A few of the band&#x27;s songs, particularly on their third album &quot;It&#x27;s Sydney or the Bush&quot;, did feature guitars, piano, horns, and other instruments, which were played by O&#x27;Neill or guest musicians such as Matt Murphy, Matt Kelly, Mick Ball and Nick Bowers-Broadbent.

Though perhaps most often associated with the 1990s Canadian East Coast alternative rock scene (often referred to at the time as the Halifax Pop Explosion), the Inbreds were actually formed in Kingston, Ontario in 1992, where O&#x27;Neill and Ullrich, childhood friends originally from Oshawa, were attending Queen&#x27;s University. They subsequently released cassettes of their own music on Ullrich&#x27;s PF (Proboscis Funkstone) Records. The band soon gained a small but loyal following.

Their 1993 debut LP, &quot;Hilario&quot;, consisted of previously released material compiled from the band&#x27;s self-released &quot;Darn Foul Dog&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together&quot;, and &quot;Egrog&quot; cassettes. The album brought the Inbreds to the attention of Rheostatics, who brought the band on tour with them. The Inbreds would later reach larger audiences while touring Canada, the US, and Europe with more established rock acts of the day such as the Tragically Hip and Buffalo Tom.

The band&#x27;s second album &quot;Kombinator&quot;, was released in 1994 and was produced by Rheostatics&#x27; drummer Dave Clark. The album received heavy college radio airplay and a MuchMusic Video Award nomination for Best Alternative Video, for &quot;Any Sense of Time&quot;. They toured Canada to support the album as part of The Tragically Hip&#x27;s second Another Roadside Attraction festival tour. By this time, PF Records was also releasing albums by several other local bands, including The Caspers, Los Seamonsters, Gigantis and The Dinner Is Ruined. &quot;Kombinator&quot; also garnered the band its first Juno Award nomination, for Best Alternative Album at the Juno Awards of 1996.

Around this time the band became the object of a bidding war between Sub Pop and TAG Recordings. Because their friends in the bands Jale and The Hardship Post, who were both signed to Sub Pop, were reporting that their relationships with the label were souring, The Inbreds chose to sign with TAG. O&#x27;Neill also said the duo wouldn&#x27;t sign to Sub Pop because the label wanted the duo to add a guitarist to the band. That label rereleased &quot;Kombinator&quot; in the United States, and brought them on a tour.

Their third album, &quot;It&#x27;s Sydney or the Bush&quot;, was produced by 4AD&#x27;s Lincoln Fong and presented a more traditional rock sound which expanded from their traditional bass and drums approach. Shortly after the release, however, TAG Recordings folded. The band carried on, capturing nominations for Best Alternative Band from the East Coast Music Awards and Best Alternative Album at the Juno Awards of 1997.

&quot;Winning Hearts&quot;, the band&#x27;s fourth and final album, was released in 1998 on Sloan&#x27;s Murderecords. With its return to the simple, bass and drums style of their earlier albums, &quot;Winning Hearts&quot; held the number one spot on &quot;Chart Magazine&quot;″s survey of Canadian campus radio for two consecutive months. Around this time the band appeared on the bill at Edgefest.

After several months of touring and promotions behind &quot;Winning Hearts&quot;, O&#x27;Neill and Ullrich unexpectedly decided to retire the band, playing their final show in summer 1998.

==Post-breakup==
O&#x27;Neill and Ullrich have both released material since the breakup of the Inbreds, O&#x27;Neill as a solo artist and Ullrich with the band Egger. Several CDs containing rare and unreleased Inbreds material were subsequently released on Ullrich&#x27;s independent label Zunior in 2004. In 2005, they performed a one-off reunion set at a Zunior concert at Lee&#x27;s Palace.

In 2007, Ullrich and O&#x27;Neill reformed the band to record a version of &quot;Dope Fiends and Booze Hounds&quot; for the Rheostatics tribute album &quot;The Secret Sessions&quot;, their first new recording since their 1998 breakup. O&#x27;Neill went on to play the character Thomas Collins in the seventh season of Canadian television show &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; and still resides in Halifax. In the same year, &quot;Wanna Be Your Friend: A Tribute to the Inbreds&quot; was also released, featuring covers of Inbreds songs by artists including Chris Murphy, In-Flight Safety, The Superfantastics, Ruby Jean and the Thoughtful Bees and Ruth Minnikin. The album also featured three bonus tracks of the Inbreds themselves performing covers, including &quot;Dope Fiends and Booze Hounds&quot; alongside The Everly Brothers&#x27; &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Clown&quot; and The Super Friendz&#x27; &quot;Down in Flames&quot;.

The Inbreds have reunited several times in recent years for live performances, playing at the Herohill Hearts Music showcase in October 2008, as well as taking part in the 2008 Halifax Pop Explosion. In 2012, the band reunited for two shows, with the first taking place in Toronto on March 24 at Lee&#x27;s Palace as part of Canadian Music Week. It was the band&#x27;s first performance in Toronto in over seven years. Their second show of 2012 was at the Lawnya Vawnya festival in St. John&#x27;s on April 20, marking the first time the band had ever played Newfoundland. In September 2017 the band also performed in Prince Edward County, Ontario at the Sandbanks Music Festival, on a bill headlined by Great Lake Swimmers.

They performed another reunion show at Toronto&#x27;s Gladstone Hotel on September 29, 2016, to promote vinyl reissues of their albums &quot;Kombinator&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Sydney or the Bush&quot; and &quot;Winning Hearts&quot; on Label Obscura.

In 2024, Ulrich&#x27;s band Egger released a new version of &quot;Any Sense of Time&quot;, in collaboration with Tim Vesely of Rheostatics and The Violet Archers, for the Music Buddy podcast.

<doc id="1212859" wikidata="Q263708" url="?curid=1212859" title="British Virgin Islands national football team">
<text>The British Virgin Islands national football team is the national team of the British Virgin Islands and is controlled by the British Virgin Islands Football Association.

They are members of both CONCACAF and FIFA.

==History==
Early football games in the British Virgin Islands were between British Royal Navy crew, and expatriates. In 1968, the British Virgin Islands team was founded by a team of Royal Engineers, and soon after, in 1973 the British Virgin Islands Football Association was founded. In 1974, it was affiliated by FIFA. The former Tottenham, Chelsea and Porto manager, Portuguese André Villas-Boas had his first job as Technical Director of the national team British Virgin Islands in 2000 and 2001.

===World Cup qualification===
In the qualifying rounds for the 2006 World Cup were drawn against St Lucia, and they were eliminated 10–0 on aggregate.

In the qualifying rounds for the 2010 World Cup they were paired with the Bahamas. They lost on the away goals rule after a 3–3 draw over both legs. Both matches were actually played in the Bahamas, but British Virgin Islands were designated as the home team in the second match, which ended 2–2.
Despite going out of the competition in the first qualifying round, the British Virgin Islands were the only side to enter the 2010 FIFA World Cup to remain unbeaten through qualification and the finals tournament (although New Zealand was undefeated in the finals tournament, they did lose a game in qualification.)

In the qualifying rounds for the 2014 FIFA World Cup they were in the unusual position of being favorites to win their two-legged tie against neighbors U.S. Virgin Islands. However, after losing the first leg 2–0 and the return leg 2–1, the British Virgin Islands once again failed to advance to the next round.

The 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying rounds saw British Virgin Islands take on Dominica with both legs taking place in Dominica, with the first leg acting as BVI&#x27;s &#x27;home ground&#x27; due to the away goal ruling. Despite taking the lead twice, the Islanders fell to a 3–2 defeat at &#x27;home&#x27; and drew 0–0 away, meaning that once again first round qualification remained elusive.

The 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying rounds saw British Virgin Islands again knocked out in the first round, having lost all four of their group matches without scoring a goal.

At the commencement of 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification, BVI advanced beyond the first round of qualifying for the first time in their history after beating the U.S. Virgin Islands 1–1 on aggregate after penalties. In the second round, they were drawn into Group E with Guatemala, Dominica, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic.

<text>Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) is an American provider of human resources management software and services, headquartered in Roseland, New Jersey.

==History==
In 1949, Henry Taub founded Automatic Payrolls, Inc. as a manual payroll processing business with his brother Joe Taub. Frank Lautenberg joined the brothers in the company&#x27;s infancy. In 1957, Lautenberg, after successfully serving in sales and marketing, became a full-fledged partner with the two brothers. In 1961, the company changed its name to Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), and began using punched card machines, check printing machines, and mainframe computers. ADP went public in 1961 with 300 clients, 125 employees, and revenues of approximately . The company established a subsidiary in the United Kingdom in 1965. In 1970, Lautenberg was noted as being the president of the company. Also in 1970, the company&#x27;s stock transitioned from trading on American Stock Exchange to trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Lautenberg continued in his roles as chairman and CEO until elected to the United States Senate from New Jersey in 1982.

From 1985 onward, ADP&#x27;s annual revenues exceeded the $1 billion mark, with paychecks processed for about 20% of the U.S. workforce. In the 1990s, ADP began acting as a professional employer organization (PEO) making several related acquisitions.

On October 21, 2008, ADP switched its stock listing to the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

In 2020, ADP was ranked 227 on the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue. ADP has also been included on Fortune Magazine&#x27;s &quot;World&#x27;s Most Admired Companies&quot; List for 14 consecutive years and has earned recognition from DiversityInc as one of the top companies for diversity and inclusion in the United States for 11 consecutive years.

ADP has about 64,000 employees worldwide and its fiscal year 2024 revenues were $19 billion.

===Acquisitions===
ADP acquired the pioneering online computer services company Time Sharing Limited (TSL) in 1974 and Cyphernetics in 1975.

As ADP became a professional employer organization, it made several acquisitions. In 1995, the company acquired the German company Autonom and the payroll and human resource services company GSI, among others. In September 1998, ADP acquired UK-based Chessington Computer Centre that supplied administration services to the UK Government.

In 2006, ADP acquired Kerridge Computer Co. Ltd., a dealer management systems (DMS) provider to auto dealers, primarily in the UK. In 2007, the ADP Brokerage Service Group was spun off to form Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. In January 2017, ADP acquired The Marcus Buckingham Company (TMBC). In October 2017, ADP acquired Global Cash Card, a digital payments facilitator.

In January 2018, ADP acquired WorkMarket, a New York City–based software platform company that helps businesses manage freelancers, contractors, and consultants. Later that same year, the company announced the acquisition of Celergo, a global payroll management service company.

In 2023, ADP acquired workflow automation tool Sora.

In October 2024, ADP acquired WorkForce Software, a management services provider.

==Divisions and spinoffs==
===Broadridge Financial Solutions===
In 2007, the ADP Brokerage Service Group was spun off to form Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., removing about US$2 billion from ADP&#x27;s total yearly revenue. ADP distributed one share of Broadridge common stock for every four shares of ADP common stock held by shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 23, 2007.

===CDK Global, LLC===
Formerly called ADP Dealer Services, CDK Global was formed October 1, 2014, and provides technology services to automotive dealerships, as well as vehicle manufacturers.
In 2010, ADP acquired the automotive marketing company Cobalt.

BZ Results, winner of &quot;AutoSuccess&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2005 &quot;Innovative Company of the Year&quot; award, was purchased by ADP in 2006. At the time, BZ Results was valued at $125 million. On April 7, 2014, ADP laid off several Dealer Services associates in a reorganization and 3 days later announced plans to spin off the Dealer Services division as a standalone company. On August 19, 2014, ADP Dealer Services announced that the name of the new company, post-spinoff, would be CDK Global (an acronym for Cobalt, Dealer Services, Kerridge).

Both S&amp;P and Moody&#x27;s downgraded ADP to AA in April 2014, after the dealer services unit was spun off.

==Employment Data==
ADP has been used as a source of private-sector employment data in addition to or in place of United States Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. ADP&#x27;s National Employment Report launches the day before BLS reports. In 2022, it was redesigned in collaboration with Stanford&#x27;s Digital Economy Lab.

<doc id="1212872" wikidata="Q5587917" url="?curid=1212872" title="Gotland Infantry Regiment">
<text>The Gotland Infantry Regiment (), designations I 27 and I 18, was a Swedish Army infantry regiment that traced its origins back to the 19th century. It was reorganized into an armoured regiment in 1963. The regiment&#x27;s soldiers were originally recruited on the island of Gotland, and it was later garrisoned there.

==History==
The regiment has its origins in the unit Gotland National Conscription which was created in 1811. By a parliamentary decision in 1866 the Gotland National Conscription was transformed into an infantry regiment and an artillery corps (I 27 and A 4). A colonel was made regimental commander who also acted as the commander of Gotland&#x27;s troops. The lieutenant colonel of the regiment came actually to serve as regimental commander until 1937. As of 1 January 1887 the regiment&#x27;s name was Royal Gotland Infantry Regiment with the designation I 27. The regiment got a similar organization to other infantry regiments. The National Conscription&#x27;s company area division remained until 1900 as the registration authority.

In 1892, the agreement that Gotland&#x27;s troops may not be called for military service outside the island was repealed. At the same time the name Gotland National Conscription was dropped. In 1901, the army order on the mainland and Gotland became similar. This admitted, among other things, that conscripts from the mainland were transferred for training at I 27. There, at the same time, bicycle infantry training began. In 1915, the regiment got Visborg Kungsladugård&#x27;s land as training area and all the buildings as storehouses. The bicycle infantry was developed during the World War I and the 1920s so far that I 18 (which the regiment was designated from 1928) circa 1930 became the Sweden&#x27;s first bicycle regiment with motorized trains.

The Defence Act of 1925 meant the end of the regiment. The regiment was downgraded to a corps which took over Västmanland Regiment designation I 18. The officers corps was reduced by 2/3. The mainland contingent of conscripts was also reduced substantially. In 1936, the Royal Swedish Gotland Infantry Corps was upgraded to a regiment with the name Royal Gotland Infantry Regiment, I 18. During World War II, armored units were added through the Göta Armoured Life Guards&#x27; Company in Gotland (P 1 G). Before the end of the war, this detachment was able to organize three companies (Stridsvagn m/42 and Stridsvagn m/37 and Pansarbil m/41).

Through the 1949 war organization, I 18, supported by P 1 G, became responsible for an armored reinforced bicycle brigade of five battalions. The seven armored companies received via Stridsvagn m/41, Stridsvagn m/40, Infanterikanonvagn 102 finally Stridsvagn 74. On 1 April 1963, the detachment was amalgamated with Gotland Infantry Regiment (I 18) and formed the Gotland Regiment (P 18) and was simultaneously transferred to the Swedish Armoured Troops.

<doc id="1212882" wikidata="Q616138" url="?curid=1212882" title="Henry Hopkins Sibley">
<text>Henry Hopkins Sibley (May 25, 1816 – August 23, 1886) was a career officer in the United States Army, who commanded a Confederate cavalry brigade in the Civil War.

In 1862, he attempted to forge a supply route from California, in defiance of the Union blockade of the Atlantic and Gulf ports, while also aiming to appropriate the Colorado gold mines to replenish the Confederate treasury. After capturing Albuquerque and Santa Fe, he was forced to retreat after losing the Battle of Glorieta Pass (in today&#x27;s New Mexico). He was then given minor commands in the southern Louisiana operations, but was accused of serious blunders, apparently caused by drunkenness.

Sibley designed a new easy-to-pack 12-man bell tent and stove that were used for many years by the American and British armies.

==Family and early life==
Henry Hopkins Sibley&#x27;s grandfather, John Sibley, served as a medic in Massachusetts in the American Revolutionary War. His wife was Elizabeth Hopkins, whose family name was given as a middle name to their son Samuel and grandson Henry. After her death in 1803, Dr. Sibley was part of an expedition to the Red River country of western Louisiana for the US government after the Louisiana Purchase and chose to settle in Natchitoches. In 1811, his son Samuel Hopkins Sibley and his wife followed to Natchitoches. Samuel Sibley served as a parish clerk from 1815 until his death in 1823.

Henry Hopkins Sibley was born in Natchitoches in 1816. After his father&#x27;s death when Henry was seven years old, the boy was sent to Missouri to live with his paternal uncle George Champlin Sibley and his wife Mary Easton, the founders of Lindenwood College in St. Charles, Missouri.

Union general and first Governor of Minnesota Henry Hastings Sibley (1811–1891) was a distant cousin. His family had migrated west in the Northern Tier, which historians have called Greater New England.

==U.S. Army service==
At the age of 17, Henry was admitted to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated in 1838 and was commissioned as second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Dragoons.

He fought Seminole Indians in Florida, 1840–1841; participated in the Military Occupation of Texas, 1845–1846; and fought in the Mexican–American War, 1847–1848. Sibley was on frontier duty in Texas from 1850 to 1855. Sibley was a creative military man. In the 1850s, he invented the &quot;Sibley tent&quot;, which was widely used by the Union Army during the American Civil War and for a short while afterward. The United Kingdom also adopted the design of the Sibley tent. He also invented the Sibley stove (also known as the Sibley tent stove), to heat the tent. The Army used tent stoves of this design into the early years of World War II.

From 1855 to 1857, Sibley was part of the forces trying to control conflict in Bleeding Kansas, where hundreds of new settlers arrived to vote on the question of slavery, provoked by the 1854 Kansas–Nebraska Act. He took part in the Utah War, 1857–1860, and was in active service in New Mexico 1860–1861. After the outbreak of the Civil War, Sibley resigned on May 13, 1861, the day of his promotion to major in the 1st Dragoons. Native to Louisiana, he had southern sympathies and joined the Confederate States Army (CSA).

==Civil War==
Sibley resigned from the US Army as he sided with the Confederacy. Placed in command of a brigade of volunteer cavalry in West Texas, Sibley dubbed his small force the Army of New Mexico and began planning a New Mexico Campaign to capture the cities of Albuquerque and Santa Fe and Fort Union on the Santa Fe Trail to establish a forward base of supply. He then intended to continue north to Colorado to capture the numerous gold and silver mines in the area as a means of replenishing the badly depleted Confederate treasury. From there, Sibley planned to join forces with Confederate Lieut. John R. Baylor, already in control of much of southern New Mexico and Arizona territories and headquartered in Tucson, AZ. Their ultimate strategy was to gain access to the warm-water ports of California and establish a badly needed supply line to the South, as the Union Navy had implemented a naval blockade from Virginia to Texas. Throughout the 1862 New Mexico campaign, his opponent was Colonel Edward Canby, formerly a comrade in arms in the U.S. Army. Some historians have said he was Sibley&#x27;s brother in law, but this relation has been disputed.

Sibley was initially successful at the Battle of Valverde on 20–21 February, and pressed on to capture Albuquerque and Santa Fe in the first weeks of March. Although the subsequent Battle of Glorieta Pass on March 28 ended in an apparent Confederate victory on the field, Sibley had to retreat because his supply train was destroyed and most of the horses and mules killed or driven off during the fight. At the same time, Union forces were approaching New Mexico from the west, the California Column. Glorieta Pass has been called the &quot;Gettysburg of the West&quot; by some authors; Sibley&#x27;s retreat to the campaign&#x27;s starting point at Fort Bliss in April ended the hopes of the Confederacy to stretch to the Pacific Ocean and use the mineral wealth of California and possibly Colorado.

After the failure of the New Mexico campaign, Sibley was given minor commands under General Richard Taylor about Bayou Teche in south Louisiana, commanding the &quot;Arizona Brigade&quot; at the battles of Irish Bend and Fort Bisland. The historian John D. Winters reports that he blundered on several occasions, not striking when instructed. Struggling with alcoholism, he was court martialed in Louisiana in 1863. Although not convicted of cowardice, he was censured.

==Postbellum career and death==
After the war, Thaddeus P. Mott recruited former Union and CSA soldiers for service in the Egyptian Army. Sibley was one of the first people to arrive in Egypt and served from 1870 to 1873 as a military adviser (with the rank of brigadier general of artillery) to Isma&#x27;il Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, overseeing the construction of coastal fortifications. However, he fell back into problems with alcohol, and he was dismissed due to illness and disability.

Back in the U.S., Sibley lived from 1874 with his daughter in Fredericksburg, Virginia. He wrote articles and worked on military inventions. He fought a legal battle with the U.S. government for outstanding payments on his patents.

He died in poverty. He is buried in the Fredericksburg Confederate Cemetery.

==In popular media==
* Sibley is referred to several times in the film &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; (1966) directed by Sergio Leone. He can be seen riding in the passenger seat on a carriage as the soldiers make their procession through a town.
* Sibley is mentioned once in the film &quot;A Reason to Live, a Reason to Die&quot; by actor Telly Savalas who played a Confederate Major.
* General Sibley appears as a minor character in Nando Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Red Blood, Yellow Gold&quot; (1967), played by an uncredited Carlo Gentili.

<text>The light-water reactor (LWR) is a type of thermal-neutron reactor that uses normal water, as opposed to heavy water, as both its coolant and neutron moderator; furthermore a solid form of fissile elements is used as fuel. Thermal-neutron reactors are the most common type of nuclear reactor, and light-water reactors are the most common type of thermal-neutron reactor.

There are three varieties of light-water reactors: the pressurized water reactor (PWR), the boiling water reactor (BWR), and (most designs of) the supercritical water reactor (SCWR).

==History==

===Early concepts and experiments===
After the discoveries of fission, moderation and of the theoretical possibility of a nuclear chain reaction, early experimental results rapidly showed that natural uranium could only undergo a sustained chain reaction using graphite or heavy water as a moderator. While the world&#x27;s first reactors (CP-1, X10 etc.) were successfully reaching criticality, uranium enrichment began to develop from theoretical concept to practical applications in order to meet the goal of the Manhattan Project, to build a nuclear explosive.

In May 1944, the first grams of enriched uranium ever produced reached criticality in the low power (LOPO) reactor at Los Alamos, which was used to estimate the critical mass of U235 to produce the atomic bomb. LOPO cannot be considered as the first light-water reactor because its fuel was not a solid uranium compound cladded with corrosion-resistant material, but was composed of uranyl sulfate salt dissolved in water. It is however the first aqueous homogeneous reactor and the first reactor using enriched uranium as fuel and ordinary water as a moderator.

By the end of the war, following an idea of Alvin Weinberg, natural uranium fuel elements were arranged in a lattice in ordinary water at the top of the X10 reactor to evaluate the neutron multiplication factor. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the feasibility of a nuclear reactor using light water as a moderator and coolant, and clad solid uranium as fuel. The results showed that, with a lightly enriched uranium, criticality could be reached. This experiment was the first practical step toward the light-water reactor.

After World War II and with the availability of enriched uranium, new reactor concepts became feasible. In 1946, Eugene Wigner and Alvin Weinberg proposed and developed the concept of a reactor using enriched uranium as a fuel, and light water as a moderator and coolant. This concept was proposed for a reactor whose purpose was to test the behavior of materials under neutron flux. This reactor, the Material Testing Reactor (MTR), was built in Idaho at INL and reached criticality on March 31, 1952. For the design of this reactor, experiments were necessary, so a mock-up of the MTR was built at ORNL, to assess the hydraulic performances of the primary circuit and then to test its neutronic characteristics. This MTR mock-up, later called the Low Intensity Test Reactor (LITR), reached criticality on February 4, 1950 and was the world&#x27;s first light-water reactor.

=== Pressurized water reactors ===

Immediately after the end of World War II the United States Navy started a program under the direction of Captain (later Admiral) Hyman Rickover, with the goal of nuclear propulsion for ships. It developed the first pressurized water reactors in the early 1950s, and led to the successful deployment of the first nuclear submarine, the .

The Soviet Union independently developed a version of the PWR in the late 1950s, under the name of VVER. While functionally very similar to the American effort, it also has certain design distinctions from Western PWRs.

=== Boiling water reactor ===

Researcher Samuel Untermyer II led the effort to develop the BWR at the US National Reactor Testing Station (now the Idaho National Laboratory) in a series of tests called the BORAX experiments.

===PIUS reactor===
PIUS, standing for &quot;Process Inherent Ultimate Safety&quot;, was a Swedish design designed by ASEA-ATOM. It is a concept for a light-water reactor system. Along with the SECURE reactor, it relied on passive measures, not requiring operator actions or external energy supplies, to provide safe operation. No units were ever built.

=== OPEN100 ===
In 2020, the Energy Impact Center announced publication of an open-sourced engineering design of a pressurized water reactor capable of producing 300 MWth/100 MWe of energy called OPEN100.

==Overview==

The family of nuclear reactors known as light-water reactors (LWR), cooled and moderated using ordinary water, tend to be simpler and cheaper to build than other types of nuclear reactors; due to these factors, they make up the vast majority of civil nuclear reactors and naval propulsion reactors in service throughout the world as of 2009. LWRs can be subdivided into three categories – pressurized water reactors (PWRs), boiling water reactors (BWRs), and supercritical water reactors (SCWRs). The SCWR remains hypothetical as of 2009; it is a Generation IV design that is still a light-water reactor, but it is only partially moderated by light water and exhibits certain characteristics of a fast neutron reactor.

The leaders in national experience with PWRs, offering reactors for export, are the United States (which offers the passively safe AP1000, a Westinghouse design, as well as several smaller, modular, passively safe PWRs, such as the Babcock &amp; Wilcox MPower, and the NuScale MASLWR), the Russian Federation (offering both the VVER-1000 and the VVER-1200 for export), the Republic of France (offering the AREVA EPR for export), and Japan (offering the Mitsubishi Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor for export); in addition, both the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the Republic of Korea are both noted to be rapidly ascending into the front rank of PWR-constructing nations as well, with the Chinese being engaged in a massive program of nuclear power expansion, and the Koreans currently designing and constructing their second generation of indigenous designs. The leaders in national experience with BWRs, offering reactors for export, are the United States and Japan, with the alliance of General Electric (of the US) and Hitachi (of Japan), offering both the Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) and the Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) for construction and export; in addition, Toshiba offers an ABWR variant for construction in Japan, as well. West Germany was also once a major player with BWRs. The other types of nuclear reactor in use for power generation are the heavy water moderated reactor, built by Canada (CANDU) and the Republic of India (AHWR), the advanced gas cooled reactor (AGCR), built by the United Kingdom, the liquid metal cooled reactor (LMFBR), built by the Russian Federation, the Republic of France, and Japan, and the graphite-moderated, water-cooled reactor (RBMK or LWGR), found exclusively within the Russian Federation and former Soviet states.

Though electricity generation capabilities are comparable between all these types of reactor, due to the aforementioned features, and the extensive experience with operations of the LWR, it is favored in the vast majority of new nuclear power plants. In addition, light-water reactors make up the vast majority of reactors that power naval nuclear-powered vessels. Four out of the five great powers with nuclear naval propulsion capacity use light-water reactors exclusively: the British Royal Navy, the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy, the French Marine nationale, and the United States Navy. Only the Russian Federation&#x27;s Navy has used a relative handful of liquid-metal cooled reactors in production vessels, specifically the Alfa class submarine, which used lead-bismuth eutectic as a reactor moderator and coolant, but the vast majority of Russian nuclear-powered boats and ships use light-water reactors exclusively. The reason for near exclusive LWR use aboard nuclear naval vessels is the level of inherent safety built into these types of reactors. Since light water is used as both a coolant and a neutron moderator in these reactors, if one of these reactors suffers damage due to military action, leading to a compromise of the reactor core&#x27;s integrity, the resulting release of the light-water moderator will act to stop the nuclear reaction and shut the reactor down. This capability is known as a negative void coefficient of reactivity.

;Currently offered LWRs include the following:
* ABWR
* AP1000
* APR-1400
* CPR-1000
* EPR
* VVER

Data from the International Atomic Energy Agency in 2009:
==Reactor design==
The light-water reactor produces heat by controlled nuclear fission. The nuclear reactor core is the portion of a nuclear reactor where the nuclear reactions take place. It mainly consists of nuclear fuel and control elements. The pencil-thin nuclear fuel rods, each about 12 feet (3.7 m) long, are grouped by the hundreds in bundles called fuel assemblies. Inside each fuel rod, pellets of uranium, or more commonly uranium oxide, are stacked end to end. The control elements, called control rods, are filled with pellets of substances like hafnium or cadmium that readily capture neutrons. When the control rods are lowered into the core, they absorb neutrons, which thus cannot take part in the chain reaction. On the converse, when the control rods are lifted out of the way, more neutrons strike the fissile uranium-235 or plutonium-239 nuclei in nearby fuel rods, and the chain reaction intensifies. All of this is enclosed in a water-filled steel pressure vessel, called the reactor vessel.

In the boiling water reactor, the heat generated by fission turns the water into steam, which directly drives the power-generating turbines. But in the pressurized water reactor, the heat generated by fission is transferred to a secondary loop via a heat exchanger. Steam is produced in the secondary loop, and the secondary loop drives the power-generating turbines. In either case, after flowing through the turbines, the steam turns back into water in the condenser.

The water required to cool the condenser is taken from a nearby river or ocean. It is then pumped back into the river or ocean, in warmed condition. The heat can also be dissipated via a cooling tower into the atmosphere. The United States uses LWR reactors for electric power production, in comparison to the heavy water reactors used in Canada.

===Control===
Control rods are usually combined into control rod assemblies — typically 20 rods for a commercial pressurized water reactor assembly — and inserted into guide tubes within a fuel element. A control rod is removed from or inserted into the central core of a nuclear reactor in order to control the number of neutrons which will split further uranium atoms. This in turn affects the thermal power of the reactor, the amount of steam generated, and hence the electricity produced. The control rods are partially removed from the core to allow a chain reaction to occur. The number of control rods inserted and the distance by which they are inserted can be varied to control the reactivity of the reactor.

Usually there are also other means of controlling reactivity. In the PWR design a soluble neutron absorber, usually boric acid, is added to the reactor coolant allowing the complete extraction of the control rods during stationary power operation ensuring an even power and flux distribution over the entire core. Operators of the BWR design use the coolant flow through the core to control reactivity by varying the speed of the reactor recirculation pumps. An increase in the coolant flow through the core improves the removal of steam bubbles, thus increasing the density of the coolant/moderator with the result of increasing power.

===Coolant===

The light-water reactor also uses ordinary water to keep the reactor cooled. The cooling source, light water, is circulated past the reactor core to absorb the heat that it generates. The heat is carried away from the reactor and is then used to generate steam. Most reactor systems employ a cooling system that is physically separate from the water that will be boiled to produce pressurized steam for the turbines, like the pressurized-water reactor. But in some reactors the water for the steam turbines is boiled directly by the reactor core, for example the boiling-water reactor.

Many other reactors are also light-water cooled, notably the RBMK and some military plutonium-production reactors. These are not regarded as LWRs, as they are moderated by graphite, and as a result their nuclear characteristics are very different. Although the coolant flow rate in commercial PWRs is constant, it is not in nuclear reactors used on U.S. Navy ships.

===Fuel===

The use of ordinary water makes it necessary to do a certain amount of enrichment of the uranium fuel before the necessary criticality of the reactor can be maintained. The light-water reactor uses uranium 235 as a fuel, enriched to approximately 3 percent. Although this is its major fuel, the uranium 238 atoms also contribute to the fission process by converting to plutonium 239; about one-half of which is consumed in the reactor. Light-water reactors are generally refueled every 12 to 18 months, at which time, about 25 percent of the fuel is replaced.

The enriched UF6 is converted into uranium dioxide powder that is then processed into pellet form. The pellets are then fired in a high-temperature, sintering furnace to create hard, ceramic pellets of enriched uranium. The cylindrical pellets then undergo a grinding process to achieve a uniform pellet size. The uranium oxide is dried before inserting into the tubes to try to eliminate moisture in the ceramic fuel that can lead to corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement. The pellets are stacked, according to each nuclear core&#x27;s design specifications, into tubes of corrosion-resistant metal alloy. The tubes are sealed to contain the fuel pellets: these tubes are called fuel rods.

The finished fuel rods are grouped in special fuel assemblies that are then used to build up the nuclear fuel core of a power reactor. The metal used for the tubes depends on the design of the reactor – stainless steel was used in the past, but most reactors now use a zirconium alloy. For the most common types of reactors the tubes are assembled into bundles with the tubes spaced precise distances apart. These bundles are then given a unique identification number, which enables them to be tracked from manufacture through use and into disposal.

Pressurized water reactor fuel consists of cylindrical rods put into bundles. A uranium oxide ceramic is formed into pellets and inserted into zirconium alloy tubes that are bundled together. The zirconium alloy tubes are about 1 cm in diameter, and the fuel cladding gap is filled with helium gas to improve the conduction of heat from the fuel to the cladding. There are about 179-264 fuel rods per fuel bundle and about 121 to 193 fuel bundles are loaded into a reactor core. Generally, the fuel bundles consist of fuel rods bundled 14x14 to 17x17. PWR fuel bundles are about 4 meters in length. The zirconium alloy tubes are pressurized with helium to try to minimize pellet cladding interaction which can lead to fuel rod failure over long periods.

In boiling water reactors, the fuel is similar to PWR fuel except that the bundles are &quot;canned&quot;; that is, there is a thin tube surrounding each bundle. This is primarily done to prevent local density variations from affecting neutronics and thermal hydraulics of the nuclear core on a global scale. In modern BWR fuel bundles, there are either 91, 92, or 96 fuel rods per assembly depending on the manufacturer. A range between 368 assemblies for the smallest and 800 assemblies for the largest U.S. BWR forms the reactor core. Each BWR fuel rod is back filled with helium to a pressure of about three atmospheres (300 kPa).

===Moderator===

A neutron moderator is a medium which reduces the velocity of fast neutrons, thereby turning them into thermal neutrons capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction involving uranium-235. A good neutron moderator is a material full of atoms with light nuclei which do not easily absorb neutrons. The neutrons strike the nuclei and bounce off. After sufficient impacts, the velocity of the neutron will be comparable to the thermal velocities of the nuclei; this neutron is then called a thermal neutron.

The light-water reactor uses ordinary water, also called light water, as its neutron moderator. The light water absorbs too many neutrons to be used with unenriched natural uranium, and therefore uranium enrichment or nuclear reprocessing becomes necessary to operate such reactors, increasing overall costs. This differentiates it from a heavy water reactor, which uses heavy water as a neutron moderator. While ordinary water has some heavy water molecules in it, it is not enough to be important in most applications. In pressurized water reactors the coolant water is used as a moderator by letting the neutrons undergo multiple collisions with light hydrogen atoms in the water, losing speed in the process. This moderating of neutrons will happen more often when the water is denser, because more collisions will occur.

The use of water as a moderator is an important safety feature of PWRs, as any increase in temperature causes the water to expand and become less dense; thereby reducing the extent to which neutrons are slowed down and hence reducing the reactivity in the reactor. Therefore, if reactivity increases beyond normal, the reduced moderation of neutrons will cause the chain reaction to slow down, producing less heat. This property, known as the negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, makes PWRs very stable. In event of a loss-of-coolant accident, the moderator is also lost and the active fission reaction will stop. Heat is still produced after the chain reaction stops from the radioactive byproducts of fission, at about 5% of rated power. This &quot;decay heat&quot; will continue for 1 to 3 years after shut down, whereupon the reactor finally reaches &quot;full cold shutdown&quot;. Decay heat, while dangerous and strong enough to melt the core, is not nearly as intense as an active fission reaction. During the post shutdown period the reactor requires cooling water to be pumped or the reactor will overheat. If the temperature exceeds 2200 °C, cooling water will break down into hydrogen and oxygen, which can form a (chemically) explosive mixture. Decay heat is a major risk factor in LWR safety record.

<doc id="1212886" wikidata="Q469966" url="?curid=1212886" title="Dag Solstad">
<text>Dag Solstad (born 16 July 1941) is a Norwegian novelist, short-story writer, and dramatist whose work has been translated into 20 languages. He has written nearly 30 books and is the only author to have received the Norwegian Literary Critics&#x27; Award three times.

His awards include the Mads Wiel Nygaards Endowment in 1969, the Nordic Council&#x27;s Literature Prize in 1989, for &quot;Roman 1987&quot; and the Brage Prize in 2006 for &quot;Armand V&quot;. Solstad is among Norway&#x27;s top-ranked authors of his generation. His early books were considered somewhat controversial, due to their political emphasis (leaning towards the Marxist–Leninist side of the political spectrum). Dag Solstad lives part-time in Berlin and part-time in Oslo.

==Personal life ==
Solstad was born in Sandefjord to merchant Ole Modal Solstad and Ragna Sofie Tveitan. His first marriage was to Erna Irene Asp, from 1968. From 1983 to 1990 he was married Tone Elisabeth Melgård. In 1995 he married journalist Therese Bjørneboe, and is thus son-in-law of writer Jens Bjørneboe.

==Selected works==

In &quot;16.07.41&quot; (2002), he tells the story in the first-person narrative, of his long and frequent walks through the streets of Berlin. However, the story is at the same time a journey in pursuit of a father-son relationship.

&quot;T. Singer&quot; (1999) is a story about a 34-year-old librarian who leaves Oslo in search of a satisfying and anonymous life in a smaller town. He marries a single mother and at first feels contented in his invisible role as husband and stepfather. However, after two years, Singer files for divorce; she is later killed in a car accident. He returns to Oslo with his stepdaughter where they live together but lead separate lives. Singer broods and becomes very alone yet feels content in the fact that he has chosen an enigmatic lifestyle. This book contains philosophical and existential observations of someone seeking to authenticate their identity through chosen isolation rather than social integration.

&quot;Medaljens forside&quot; (1990) is a book on the history of the industrial construction and engineering company Aker Kværner, but the author insists it should nevertheless be considered as a novel, with the Aker company as its main character.

His 1982 novel &quot;Gymnaslærer Pedersens beretning om den store politiske vekkelse som har hjemsøkt vårt land&quot; was adapted for the screen in 2006 by Hans Petter Moland as Gymnaslærer Pedersen.

==Other writings and assessment==

With fellow novelist Jon Michelet, Solstad has published a book after each of the FIFA World Cups in 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994 and 1998. The books blend analytic reporting with political and cultural commentary, and are contributions to genuine literature.

Solstad has also published various essays and articles, both for literary magazines and newspapers, and selections of these have been collected and published in three separate volumes.

In her PhD thesis &quot;Why So Big? A Literary Discourse Analysis of Dag Solstad&#x27;s Authorship&quot; (University of Oslo, 2009), Inger Østenstad argues from different perspectives that Solstad is Norway&#x27;s greatest contemporary writer, and uses a version of Dominique Maingueneau&#x27;s discourse theory to analyse the components of oeuvre, reception, para-text and meta-text that in Solstad&#x27;s case contribute to his established greatness. Peter Handke, Karl Ove Knausgaard and Per Petterson, three contemporary writers, regard Solstad highly for his literary excellence.

<text>Ronald Ray Fairly (July 12, 1938 – October 30, 2019) was an American professional baseball player and television sports presenter. He played in Major League Baseball as a first baseman and right fielder from 1958 to 1978, most prominently as a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers, with whom he was a member of three World Series winning teams. Fairly was also a two-time All-Star.

After his playing career, he began a career as a television color commentator from 1979 to 2006 for the California Angels, San Francisco Giants and the Seattle Mariners. Combining his playing and broadcasting careers, Fairly was involved in over 7,000 major league games from 1958 through 2006.

==Early life and college career==
Fairly was born in Macon, Georgia, but when he was three months old his family moved to Long Beach, California, where he grew up and attended Jordan High School. Fairly played varsity baseball for USC Trojans baseball at the University of Southern California in 1958, coached by Rod Dedeaux, and made the most of it. He hit .348 with team highs of nine home runs and 67 RBI while lettering as a sophomore center fielder as the Trojans won USC&#x27;s second College World Series championship. There he was a teammate of future Major League general manager Pat Gillick. An All-District 8 selection that season, Fairly was signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur free agent. After two brief minor league stops, he made the big club late in September 1958.

==Professional career==
A competitive player and highly disciplined hitter, Fairly had a short and compact swing with occasional power to all fields. With his glove, he was a competent first baseman as well as at all three outfield positions, being best suited for right field. His talents were overshadowed by a notorious lack of speed. He is the second in Major League Baseball (the first being Stan Musial) to play 1000 games or more in both the outfield and the infield. Fairly played 21 seasons of Major League Baseball, 12 of them with the Los Angeles Dodgers, where he won three World Series titles. In 2442 career games, Fairly had 1913 hits, a .266 batting average with 215 home runs and 1044 RBI, while walking 1052 times compared to only 877 strikeouts. He posted a career .990 fielding percentage. Fairly played in four World Series, appearing in 20 games, hitting .300 with 2 home runs and 6 RBI, all with the Los Angeles Dodgers. His career home run total is the most in major league history for a player without a 20-home run season.

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
Fairly made his Major League Baseball debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 9, 1958, going hitless in three at-bats in a 4-3 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. The next day, Fairly collected his first career hit, a single off the Phillies&#x27; Robin Roberts. On September 12, Fairly hit his first career home run off Ron Kline of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Overall with the Dodgers, Fairly played in 15 games, hitting .283 with 2 home runs and 8 RBI.

In 1959, Fairly was used mostly as a pinch hitter and a defensive replacement late in games, as in 118 games with Los Angeles, he had only 244 at-bats. During the season, he hit .238 with 4 home runs and 23 RBI, helping Los Angeles win the National League pennant and advance to the 1959 World Series. Fairly played in all six games during the World Series, going hitless in three at-bats, as the Dodgers won the series over the Chicago White Sox.

Fairly spent the majority of the 1960 season with the Dodgers AAA affiliate, the Spokane Indians of the Pacific Coast League, as he played in only 14 games with Los Angeles, hitting .108 with a home run and 3 RBI.

In 1961, Fairly played in 111 games with the Dodgers, as he hit .322 with 10 home runs and 48 RBI, while spending time between the three outfield positions and first base.

Fairly became the Dodgers&#x27; everyday first baseman during the 1962 season, as in 147 games, he hit .278 with 14 home runs and 71 RBI.

Fairly helped the Dodgers clinch the National League pennant in 1963, as he played in 152 games, hitting .271 with 12 home runs and 77 RBI. In the 1963 World Series against the New York Yankees, Fairly played in all four games, however, he was credited with only one official at-bat, as he failed to register a hit, but walked three times as Los Angeles won the series.

Fairly had another solid season with the Dodgers in 1964, batting .256 with 10 home runs and 74 RBI in 150 games.

In 1965, Fairly appeared in a career high 158 games with Los Angeles, hitting .274 with 9 home runs and 70 RBI, helping the club to their third National League pennant since Fairly joined the team. In the 1965 World Series against the Minnesota Twins, Fairly played a key role in the Dodgers&#x27; seven game series victory, as he hit .379 with 2 home runs and 6 RBI, as Los Angeles won their third World Series title in seven years.

Fairly missed a month of the season due to injuries in 1966, playing in only 117 games, his lowest total since 1961, however, he hit .288 with 14 home runs and 61 RBI, helping the Dodgers clinch the National League pennant for the second consecutive season. In the 1966 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles, Fairly hit only .143 with no home runs or RBI in three games, as the Dodgers lost to the Orioles.

In 1967, Fairly struggled offensively, as his batting average dipped to .220, while he had 10 home runs and 55 RBI in 153 games.

Fairly continued his struggles throughout the 1968 season, as he hit only .234 with 4 home runs and 43 RBI in 141 with the Dodgers.

He began the 1969 season with Los Angeles, however, Fairly continued to struggle with his bat, hitting .219 with no home runs and 8 RBI in 30 games with the Dodgers. On June 11, Los Angeles traded Fairly and Paul Popovich to the Montreal Expos for Manny Mota and Maury Wills.

===Montreal Expos===
After struggling offensively with the Los Angeles Dodgers for the previous two seasons, Fairly immediately improved with his move to the expansion Montreal Expos in 1969, with whom he hit .289 with 12 home runs and 39 RBI in 70 games.

Fairly had a solid season in 1970, playing in 119 games with the Expos, hitting .288 with 15 home runs and 61 RBI, as well as stealing a career high 10 bases.

Fairly saw his batting average fall to .257 in the 1971 season, however, his power numbers remained steady, as he hit 13 home runs and 71 RBI in 146 games with Montreal.

He continued his solid play with the Expos in 1972, as Fairly hit .278 with 17 home runs and 68 RBI in 140 games.

Fairly appeared late in the 1973 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, his first All-Star game, as a defensive replacement. Overall with the Expos, Fairly hit .276 with 86 home runs and 331 RBI in 718 games.

During the 1974 season, Fairly lost some playing time, as he appeared in only 101 games with Montreal, hitting .243 with 12 home runs and 43 RBI.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
Fairly was dealt from the Expos to the St. Louis Cardinals for a pair of minor leaguers, first baseman Ed Kurpiel and infielder Rudy Kinard, at the Winter Meetings on December 6, 1974. He spent the 1975 season as a utility player for the Cardinals where in 107 games, he hit .307 with 7 home runs and 37 RBI, as he saw his playing time split between first base and as an outfielder.

He started the 1976 season with St. Louis, appearing in 73 games, hitting .264 with no home runs and 21 RBI. On September 14, his contract was purchased by the Oakland Athletics.

===Oakland Athletics===
Fairly finished the 1976 season with the Oakland Athletics. In 15 games with Oakland, Fairly hit .239 with 3 home runs and 10 RBI, as the Athletics finished in second place in the American League West, ending their division title streak at five. On February 24, 1977, the A&#x27;s traded Fairly to the Toronto Blue Jays for Mike Weathers and cash.

===Toronto Blue Jays===
Fairly split the 1977 season between designated hitter, first base and the outfield, as he played in 132 games with Toronto, hitting .279 with a team leading 19 home runs and 64 RBI. He appeared in the 1977 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, as a pinch hitter, striking out against Tom Seaver. Fairly is the only player to have represented both Canadian MLB teams in the All-Star game. On December 8, the Blue Jays traded Fairly to the California Angels for Butch Alberts and Pat Kelly.

===California Angels===
Fairly finished his career with the California Angels in 1978, playing in 91 games, hitting .217 with 10 home runs and 40 RBI. He announced his retirement at the end of the season.

==Broadcasting career==
After his playing days ended, Fairly began his broadcasting career in 1979 at KTLA in Los Angeles and later joined Bob Starr in the California Angels radio/television booth. During the 1984 season, he also served as the club&#x27;s hitting instructor for manager John McNamara while continuing to hold down his radio duties. Considered &quot;one of the most knowledgeable baseball men in the organization,&quot; he suited up prior to each game to instruct hitters during batting practice before returning to the broadcast booth to do Angels games for KMPC radio. Fairly said of the new assignment, &quot;When you play as long as I did, you&#x27;re constantly talking hitting. But I don&#x27;t see this role in the context of instructing as much as reminding guys what they do well. I get to the park early anyway. And there&#x27;s no conflict really with my radio work.&quot; Angels general manager Buzzie Bavasi told the &quot;Orange County Register&quot; in announcing the decision, &quot;Since we were planning on adding a hitting instructor, the feeling was we had the man right here. Ron is intelligent, articulate and knows the game.&quot;

In 1987, Fairly moved up the coast and joined KNBR as the voice of the San Francisco Giants. In 1993, he went farther north as a broadcaster for the Seattle Mariners, where he stayed through the 2006 season. Fairly served primarily as a color commentator, but occasionally stepped in to do play-by-play as well.

In 1997, Fairly was selected to the USC Athletic Hall of Fame.

On September 21, 2006, the Mariners announced that Fairly was retiring from his post as a team broadcaster after 14 seasons, ending a 27-year career in Major League Baseball broadcasting. Coupled with 21 years as a player, Fairly spent 48 years in and around the Major Leagues.

From June 15 to June 17, 2007, Fairly briefly came out of retirement to work as a television analyst for the Mariners during a three-game interleague series against the Houston Astros, while broadcaster Mike Blowers was on vacation.

From July 15 to July 18, 2010, Fairly broadcast the Mariners&#x27; four-game series against the Los Angeles Angels with Rick Rizzs on KIRO to fill in for Dave Niehaus, who was on vacation. In 2011 and 2012 Fairly returned again to the Mariners&#x27; radio booth, as one of a rotating group of guest announcers filling in on their broadcasts following the death of Niehaus after the 2010 season.

==Later life and death==
Fairly died of pancreatic cancer on October 30, 2019, aged 81.

<text>A microchip implant is an identifying integrated circuit placed under the skin of an animal. The chip, about the size of a large grain of rice, uses passive radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology, and is also known as a PIT (passive integrated transponder) tag. Standard pet microchips are typically 11–13 mm long (approximately inch) and 2 mm in diameter.

Externally attached microchips such as RFID ear tags are commonly used to identify farm and ranch animals, with the exception of horses. Some external microchips can be read with the same scanner used with implanted chips.

Animal shelters, animal control officers and veterinarians routinely look for microchips to return lost pets quickly to their owners, avoiding expenses for housing, food, medical care, outplacing and euthanasia. Many shelters place chips in all outplaced animals.

Microchips are also used by kennels, breeders, brokers, trainers, registries, rescue groups, humane societies, clinics, farms, stables, animal clubs and associations, researchers, and pet stores.

==Usage==
Since their first use in the mid-1980s, microchips have allowed innovative investigations into numerous biological traits of animals. The tiny, coded markers implanted into individual animals allow assessment of growth rates, movement patterns, and survival patterns for many species in a manner more reliable than traditional approaches of externally marking animals for identification. Microchips have also been used to confirm the identity of pets and protected species that have been illegally removed from the wild.
Microchips can be implanted by a veterinarian or at a shelter. After checking that the animal does not already have a chip, the vet or technician injects the chip with a syringe and records the chip&#x27;s unique ID. No anesthetic is required, as it is a simple procedure and causes little discomfort; the pain is minimal and short-lived. In dogs and cats, chips are usually inserted below the skin at the back of the neck between the shoulder blades on the dorsal midline. According to one reference, continental European pets get the implant in the left side of the neck. The chip can often be felt under the skin. Thin layers of connective tissue form around the implant and hold it in place.

Horses are microchipped on the left side of the neck, halfway between the poll and withers and approximately one inch below the midline of the mane, into the nuchal ligament.

Birds are implanted in their breast muscles. Proper restraint is necessary so the operation requires either two people (an avian veterinarian and a veterinary technician) or general anesthesia. Studies on horses show swelling and increased sensitivity take approximately three days to resolve. Humans report swelling and bruising at the time of implant, two to four weeks for scar tissue to form and itching and pinching sensations for up to two years. A test scan ensures correct operation.

Some shelters and vets designate themselves as the primary contact to remain informed about possible problems with the animals they place. The form is sent to a registry, who may be the chip manufacturer, distributor or an independent entity such as a pet recovery service. Some countries have a single official national database. For a fee, the registry typically provides 24-hour, toll-free telephone service for the life of the pet. Some veterinarians leave registration to the owner, usually done online, but a chip without current contact information is essentially useless.
The owner receives a registration certificate with the chip ID and recovery service contact information. The information can also be imprinted on a collar tag worn by the animal. Like an automobile title, the certificate serves as proof of ownership and is transferred with the animal when it is sold or traded; an animal without a certificate could be stolen. There are some privacy concerns regarding the use of microchips.

Authorities and shelters examine strays for chips, providing one of the aforementioned recovery services with the ID number, description and location so that the recovery service may notify the owner, a contact, or veterinarians in the area. If the pet is wearing the collar tag, the finder does not need a chip reader to contact the registry because a rescuer can simply read the ID number and phone number (or website) to provide to the registry. An owner can also report a missing pet to the recovery service, as vets look for chips in new animals and check with the recovery service to see if it has been reported lost or stolen.

Many veterinarians scan an animal&#x27;s chip on every visit to verify correct operation. Some use the chip ID as their database index and print it on receipts, test results, vaccination certifications and other records.

Some veterinary tests and procedures require positive identification of the animal, and a microchip may be acceptable for this purpose as an alternative to a tattoo.

Some pet doors can be programmed to be activated by the microchips of specific animals, allowing only certain animals to use the door.

== Advantages of data collection ==

=== Pets ===
There are multiple reasons for the use of the microchips on pets as a documentation device, which are also advantages of microchips regarding information collection. The three major reasons for microchip implantation are , recording, domestication and showing proof of ownership. For example, with a feline microchip, delocalization shows that a registered cat is one that society is aware of and the cat has a position in the social order of animals. Recording shows that the microchip helps authorized people review and monitor cats in a certain region by referring to the database; thus the registry and the implanted microchips transform cats into social objects.

=== Livestock ===
Due to the advantages of microchips, there are many concrete applications of RFID in the agri-food sector covering the majority of usual foods, such as all kinds of meats as well as various vegetables, fruits. The feature of RFID, namely its traceability, makes it possible for the increased security and confidence of customers. As one of the most popular livestock around the world, the health condition of pigs is vital to farmer&#x27;s income and inevitably influence customers&#x27; health. It is challenging to monitor the pigs&#x27; health condition individually by using traditional approaches. It is common for diseases to spread from a single pig to nearly all the pigs living in the same pigsty. By adopting the technology of microchips to measure the drinking behavior of individual pigs housed in a group, it is possible to identify a pig&#x27;s health and productivity state. This kind of behavior is a good indicator of a pig&#x27;s overall health. Compared to traditional visual observations to determine the pig&#x27;s health state, RFID-based monitoring of pig drinking behavior is a feasible and more efficient option.

=== Wildlife ===

Using microchips in wild animals in biology began with fisheries studies to determine the efficacy of this method for measuring fish movement. Later, studies that use microchips to track wild animals expanded over the years, including researches on mammals, reptiles, birds, and amphibians. Compared with previous marking and tagging techniques used to identify wild animals before the advent of microchips, such as ear tags and color-coded leg bands, microchips are visually less obvious and less likely to be detected by prey and predators. Due to the fact that traditional identifications are on the exterior of the animal, tags can be lost, scars can heal and tattoos can fade.

Other useful and significant information can be collected by microchips. Chipped wild animals that are recaptured can provide information on growth rate and change of location, as well as other valuable data such as age structure, sex ratios, and longevity of individuals in the wild. Other researches on small mammals like rats and mice also adopt this technology to determine body temperature of terminally ill animals. As microchips are internal, permanent, durable under harsh environments, and have little influence on animals, more scholars have employed microchip implantation to collect useful data on wildlife researches.

==Components of a microchip==

A microchip implant is a passive RFID device. Lacking an internal power source, it remains inert until it is powered by the scanner or another power source. While the chip itself only interacts with limited frequencies, the device also has an antenna that is optimized for a specific frequency, but is not selective. It may receive, generate current with, and reradiate stray electromagnetic waves. The radio-waves emitted by the scanner activate the chip, making the chip transmit the identification number to the scanner, and the scanner displays the number on screen. The microchip is enclosed in a biocompatible glass cylinder and includes an identifying integrated circuit placed under the skin of an animal. Relevant standards for the chips are ISO 11784 and ISO 11785.

Most implants contain three elements: a &#x27;chip&#x27; or integrated circuit, a coil inductor, possibly with a ferrite core, and a capacitor. The chip contains unique identification data and electronic circuits to encode that information. The coil acts as the secondary winding of a transformer, receiving power inductively coupled to it from the scanner. The coil and capacitor together form a resonant LC circuit tuned to the frequency of the scanner&#x27;s oscillating magnetic field to produce power for the chip. The chip then transmits its data back through the coil to the scanner. The way the chip communicates with the scanner is a method called backscatter. It becomes part of the electromagnetic field and modulates it in a manner that communicates the ID number to the scanner.
These components are encased in biocompatible soda lime or borosilicate glass and hermetically sealed. Leaded glass should not be used for pet microchips and consumers should only accept microchips from reliable sources. The glass is also sometimes coated with polymers. Parylene C (chlorinated poly-dimethylbenzene) has become a common coating. Plastic pet microchips have been registered in the international registry since 2012 under Datamars manufacturer code 981 and are being implanted in pets. The patent suggests it is a silicone filled polyester sheath, but the manufacturer does not disclose the exact composition.

== Use by country ==
Some countries require microchips in imported animals to match vaccination records. Microchip tagging may also be required for CITES-regulated international trade in certain endangered animals: for example, Asian Arowana are tagged to limit import to captive-bred fish. Birds that are not banded and cross international borders as pets or for trade are microchipped so that each bird is uniquely identifiable.

=== Australia ===

Microchips are legally required in the state of New South Wales, Australia.

Because the ability to trace livestock from property of birth to slaughter is critical to the safety of red meat, the Australian red meat industry has implemented a national system known as National Livestock Identification System to ensure the quality and safety of beef, lamb, sheep meat and goat meat. There are weaknesses in the current microchipping system in Australia. According to several pieces of researches in 2015, reclaim rates were significantly higher for animals with microchips than those without microchips, which is based on the statistical analysis of the raw data of dogs and cats living in Australia as well as microchipped animals. To determine the character and the frequency of inaccurate microchip data used for locating owners of stray pets, the researchers also analyzed admission data for stray dogs and cats entering shelters called RSPCA-Queensland (QLD). The results show that the problem of microchip data may reduce the possibility that a pet&#x27;s owner will be contacted to reclaim the animal. It is necessary that the current microchipping system in Australia be perfect and that microchip owners update their data frequently.

=== France ===

Since 1999, all dogs older than four months must be permanently identified with a microchip (or a tattoo, though the latter is not accepted if the animal is to leave the country).

Cats are not required to be microchipped, though 2019 recorded increased support for mandatory chipping. Instead, since 1 January 2012, all cats older than seven months require mandatory registration in the European Union database.

=== Israel ===

Dogs and cats imported to Israel are required to be microchipped with an ISO 11784/11785 compliant 15 digit pet microchip.

=== Japan ===
Japan requires an ISO 11784 and 11785 compliant microchip implant for dogs and cats handled by breeders and pet shops, as well as for all imported dogs and cats. Additionally, microchipping is mandatory for certain invasive species that threaten Japan’s ecosystems or agriculture, as well as for special animals classified as dangerous to human life, health, or property.

The Act on Welfare and Management of Animals (Act No. 105 of 1973) requires owners and pet sellers to register microchipped dogs and cats with the Ministry of the Environment database and update registration details as needed. When transferring ownership of a registered dog or cat, the Registration Certificate must accompany the animal. The Act prohibits microchip removal unless it poses a risk to the animal&#x27;s health or falls under other exceptional cases.

The ISO 11784 standard defines a 15-digit microchip code, split into a 3-digit country code and a 12-digit National ID Code. The Japan Veterinary Medical Association introduced a system in 1995 that includes Japan’s numeric country code (392), followed by a 2-digit animal code, a 2-digit distributor code, and a unique 8-digit identification number.

=== New Zealand ===

All dogs first registered after 1 July 2006 must be microchipped. Farmers protested that farm dogs should be exempt, drawing a parallel to the Dog Tax War of 1898. Farm dogs were exempted from microchipping in an amendment to the legislation passed in June 2006. A National Animal Identification and Tracing scheme in New Zealand is currently being developed for tracking livestock.

=== United Kingdom ===

In April 2012, Northern Ireland became the first part of the United Kingdom to require microchipping of individually licensed dogs.

As of 6 April 2016, all dogs in England, Scotland and Wales must be microchipped.

All pet cats in England must be microchipped by 10 June 2024. Owners found not to have microchipped their cat will have 21 days to have one implanted, or may face a fine of up to £500. 

=== United States ===

Microchipping of pets and other animals is voluntary except for some legislation mandating microchipping as a means of identifying animals who have been identified as being dangerous. Though, California law requires any animal control agency, shelter or rescue to only release a cat or dog, including to the owner, if they are microchipped or will be within 30 days. In 1994, the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry (LDAF) issued a regulation requiring permanent identification (in the form of a brand, lip tattoo or electronic identification) of all horses tested for equine infectious anemia. According to the LDAF and the state veterinarian, this requirement made contributed to better determining the owners of horses displaced during Hurricane Katrina in fall 2005.

The United States uses the National Animal Identification System for farm and ranch animals, which excludes dogs and cats. In most species, except horses, an external eartag is typically used in lieu of an implant microchip. Eartags with microchips or simply stamped with a visible number can be used. Both use ISO fifteen-digit microchip numbers with the U.S. country code of 840.

== Cross-compatibility and standards issues ==
In most countries, pet ID chips adhere to an international standard to promote compatibility between chips and scanners. In the United States, however, three proprietary types of chips compete along with the international standard. Scanners distributed to United States shelters and veterinarians well into 2006 could each read at most three of the four types. Scanners with quad-read capability are now available and are increasingly considered required equipment. Older scanner models will be in use for some time, so United States pet owners must still choose between a chip with good coverage by existing scanners and one compatible with the international standard. The four types include:

* The ISO conformant full-duplex type has the greatest international acceptance. It is common in many countries including Canada and large parts of Europe (since the late 1990s). It is one of two chip protocol types (along with the &quot;half-duplex&quot; type sometimes used in farm and ranch animals) that conform to International Organization for Standardization standards ISO 11784 and ISO 11785. To support international/multivendor application, the three-digit country code can contain an assigned ISO country code or a manufacturer code from 900 to 998 plus its identifying serial number. In the United States, distribution of this type has been controversial. When 24PetWatch.com began distributing them in 2003 (and more famously Banfield Pet Hospitals in 2004) many shelter scanners couldn&#x27;t read them. At least one Banfield-chipped pet was inadvertently euthanized.
* The Trovan Unique type is another pet chip protocol type in use since 1990 in pets in the United States. Patent problems forced the withdrawal of Trovan&#x27;s implanter device from United States distribution and they became uncommon in pets in the United States, although Trovan&#x27;s original registry database &quot;infopet.biz&quot; remained in operation. In early 2007, the American Kennel Club&#x27;s chip registration service, AKC Companion Animal Recovery Corp, which had been the authorized registry for HomeAgain brand chips made by Destron/Digital Angel, began distributing Trovan chips with a different implanter. These chips are read by the Trovan, HomeAgain (Destron Fearing), Bayer (Black Label), and Avid (MiniTracker 3) readers.
* A third type, sometimes known as FECAVA or Destron, is available under various brand names. These include, in the United States, &quot;Avid Eurochip&quot;, the common current 24PetWatch chips, and the original (and still popular) style of HomeAgain chips. (HomeAgain and 24Petwatch can now supply the true ISO chip instead on request.) Chips of this type have ten-digit hexadecimal chip numbers. This &quot;FECAVA&quot; type is readable on a wide variety of scanners in the United States and has been less controversial, although its level of adherence to the ISO standards is sometimes exaggerated in some descriptions. The ISO standard has an annex (appendix) recommending that three older chip types be supported by scanners, including a 35-bit &quot;FECAVA&quot;/&quot;Destron&quot; type. The common Eurochip/HomeAgain chips don&#x27;t agree perfectly with the annex description, although the differences are sometimes considered minor. But the ISO standard also makes it clear that only its 64-bit &quot;full-duplex&quot; and &quot;half-duplex&quot; types are &quot;conformant&quot;; even chips (e.g., the Trovan Unique) that match one of the Annex descriptions are not. More visibly, FECAVA cannot support the ISO standard&#x27;s required country/manufacturer codes. They may be accepted by authorities in many countries where ISO-standard chips are the norm, but not by those requiring literal ISO conformance.
* Finally, there&#x27;s the AVID brand FriendChip type, which has unique encryption characteristics. Cryptographic features are welcomed by pet rescuers or humane societies that object to outputting an ID number &quot;in the clear&quot; for anyone to read, along with authentication features for detection of counterfeit chips, but the authentication in &quot;FriendChips&quot; has been found lacking and rather easy to spoof to the AVID scanner. Although no authentication encryption is involved, obfuscation requires proprietary information to convert transmitted chip data to its original label ID code. Well into 2006, scanners containing the proprietary decryption were provided to the United States market only by AVID and Destron/Digital Angel; Destron/Digital Angel put the decryption feature in some, but not all, of its scanners, possibly as early as 1996. (For years, its scanners distributed to shelters through HomeAgain usually had full decryption, while many sold to veterinarians would only state that an AVID chip had been found.) Well into 2006, both were resisting calls from consumers and welfare group officials to bring scanners to the United States shelter community combining AVID decryption capability with the ability to read ISO-compliant chips. Some complained that AVID itself had long marketed combination pet scanners compatible with all common pet chips except possibly Trovan outside the United States. By keeping them out of the United States, it could be considered partly culpable in the missed-ISO chips problem others blamed on Banfield. In 2006, the European manufacturer Datamars, a supplier of ISO chips used by Banfield and others, gained access to the decryption secrets and began supplying scanners with them to United States customers. This &quot;Black Label&quot; scanner was the first four-standard full-multi pet scanner in the United States market. Later in 2006, Digital Angel announced that it would supply a full-multi scanner in the United States. In 2008, Avid introduced the MiniTracker Pro to support Avid, FECAVA, and ISO full-duplex microchips. Trovan also acquired the decryption technology in 2006 or earlier, and now provides it in scanners distributed in the United States by AKC-CAR. (Some are quad-read, but others lack full ISO support.)

Many references in print state that the incompatibilities between different chip types are a matter of &quot;frequency&quot;. One may find claims that early ISO adopters in the United States endangered their customers&#x27; pets by giving them ISO chips that work at a &quot;different frequency&quot; from the local shelter&#x27;s scanner, or that the United States government considered forcing an incompatible frequency change. These claims were little challenged by manufacturers and distributors of ISO chips, although later evidence suggests the claims were disinformation. All chips operate at the scanner&#x27;s frequency. Although ISO chips are optimized for 134.2 kHz, in practice they are readable at 125 kHz and the &quot;125 kHz&quot; chips are readable at 134.2 kHz. Confirmation comes from government filings that indicate the supposed &quot;multi-frequency&quot; scanners now commonly available are really single-frequency scanners operating at 125, 134.2 or 128 kHz. In particular, the United States HomeAgain scanner didn&#x27;t change excitation frequency when ISO-read capability was added; it&#x27;s still a single frequency, 125 kHz scanner.

For users requiring shelter-grade certainty, this table is not a substitute for testing the scanner with a set of specimen chips. One study cites problems with certain Trovan chips on the Datamars Black Label scanner. In general, the study found none of the tested scanners to read all four standards without some deficiency, but it predates the most recent scanner models.

==Reported adverse reactions==
Adverse event reporting for animal microchips has been inconsistent. RFID chips are used in animal research, and at least three studies conducted since the 1990s have reported tumors at the site of implantation in laboratory mice and rats. The UK&#x27;s Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) assumed the task of adverse event reporting for animal microchips there in April 2014. Mandatory adverse event reporting went into effect in the UK in February 2015. The first report was issued for the period of April 2014 through December 2015. Mandatory microchip implant of dogs went into effect in April 2016. Data sets for 2016 through 2018 have become available. Adverse reactions to microchip implants may include infection, rejection, mass and tumor formation or death, but the risk of adverse reactions is very low. Sample sizes, in rodents and dogs in particular, have been small, and so conclusive evidence has been limited. 

Noted veterinary associations have responded with continued support for the microchip implant procedures as reasonably safe for cats and dogs, pointing to rates of serious complications on the order of one in a million in the UK, which has a system for tracking such adverse reactions and has chipped over 3.7 million pet dogs. A 2011 study found no safety concerns for microchipped animals with RFID chips undergoing MRI at one Tesla magnetic field strength. In 2011 a microchip-associated fibrosarcoma was reported found in the neck of a 9-year old, neutered-male cat. Histological examination was consistent with postinjection sarcoma, but all prior vaccinations occurred in the hindlegs.

The microchip is implanted in the subcutaneous tissues causing an inflammatory response until scar tissue develops around the microchip. Studies on horses are used as the basis for short inflammatory response claims, while procedures on done on small kittens and puppies. People have reported swelling and bruising at the time of the implant with itching and pinching sensations for up to two years. The broader impacts on inflammatory disorders and cancer have not been determined and most of the health risks that were defined in the FDA Guidance developed for human implants should be considered. Adverse event reporting in the US can be made by the pet owner or a veterinarian to the FDA.
The estimate for the total cat and dog population of the UK is 16 million with 8.5 million dogs subject to mandatory microchip implant. The population of dogs implanted prior to mandatory adverse event reporting February 2015 was between 60% (February 2013) and 86% (April 2016). Approximately 95% are reported to be implanted as of April 2017.

==Privacy==
Unauthorized reading of microchips can present a risk to privacy and can potentially provide information to identify or track packages, consumers, carriers, or even owners of different animals. Several prototype systems are being developed to combat unauthorized reading, including RFID signal interruption, as well as the possibility of legislation. Hundreds of scientific papers have been published on this matter since 2002. Different countries have responded differently to these issues.

As early as in 1997, some scholars believed that microchip implantation was technically possible, but it was suggested that it was the time to consider strategies for preventing potentially grievous intrusion into personal privacy. It is possible that microchips implanted on animals can also lead to privacy issues or information breaches, which can lead to serious social problems.

A common misconception is that the chip can be used for location tracking of the animal, which is false.

===The microchip ownership question===
The widespread adoption of microchip identification may lead to ownership disputes occurring more frequently since sometimes microchip ownership information is irrelevant according to the ownership laws. This can occur when the owner is not the one to whom the microchip ownership information belongs. This is a significant problem because client confidentiality rules generally prohibit veterinarians from divulging information about a pet without the client&#x27;s permission. Furthermore, veterinarians are required to get permission from the person who registered the chip to perform a surgery on a microchipped animal, even if the animal is experiencing a severe medical emergency. The problem can be more complicated if animals with microchips are abandoned or stolen.

===Protecting privacy===
The first method of protecting microchip privacy is by regularly updating information. Stray animals with incorrect microchip details are less likely to be reclaimed and when compared to pets with correct microchip details, the time taken to retrieve the pets is longer, and sometimes reuniting is impossible. Therefore, it is wise to update microchip information regularly, especially when owners move or change their phone numbers. According to research, email reminders may increase the frequency of pet owners updating their microchip information. By increasing the pet owners&#x27; updating frequency of the pets&#x27; data, the reclaim percentages of stray animals will increase and reduce the number of pets euthanized in shelters every year.

Another method of protection is by using cryptography. Rolling codes and challenge–response authentication (CRA) are commonly used to foil monitor-repetition of the messages between the tag and reader; as any messages that have been recorded would prove to be unsuccessful on repeat transmission. It is possible that some novel RFID authentication protocols for microchip ownership transfer can be adapted to protect users&#x27; privacy, which meets three key requirements for secure microchip ownership transfer. The three requirements include: new owner privacy (only the new owner should be able to identify and control the microchip), old owner privacy (past interactions between the microchip and its previous owner should not be traceable by the new owner) as well as authorization recovery (the new owner should be able to transfer its authorization rights to the previous owner in some special cases). These features can protect owners&#x27; privacy to some extent.

<doc id="1212891" wikidata="Q833503" url="?curid=1212891" title="Chinook salmon">
<text>The Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) is the largest and most valuable species of Pacific salmon. Its common name is derived from the Chinookan peoples. Other vernacular names for the species include king salmon, Quinnat salmon, Tsumen, spring salmon, chrome hog, Blackmouth, and Tyee salmon. The scientific species name is based on the Russian common name &quot;chavycha&quot; (чавыча).

Chinook are anadromous fish native to the North Pacific Ocean and the river systems of western North America, ranging from California to Alaska, as well as Asian rivers ranging from northern Japan to the Palyavaam River in Arctic northeast Siberia. They have been introduced to other parts of the world, including New Zealand and Patagonia. Introduced Chinook salmon are thriving in Lake Michigan and Michigan&#x27;s western rivers. A large Chinook is a prized and sought-after catch for a sporting angler. The flesh of the salmon is also highly valued for its dietary nutritional content, which includes high levels of important omega-3 fatty acids. Some populations are endangered; however, many are healthy. The Chinook salmon has not been assessed for the IUCN Red List. According to NOAA, the Chinook salmon population along the California coast is declining from factors such as overfishing, loss of freshwater and estuarine habitat, hydropower development, poor ocean conditions, and hatchery practices.

==Distribution==
===Natural range===
Historically, the native distribution of Chinook salmon in North America ranged from the Ventura River in California in the south to Kotzebue Sound in Alaska in the north. Recent studies have shown that Chinook salmon are historically native to the Guadalupe River watershed in California, the southernmost major metropolitan area hosting salmon runs in the United States. Populations have disappeared from large areas where they once flourished, however, or shrunk by as much as 40 percent. In some regions, their inland range has been cut off, mainly by dams and habitat alterations: in Southern California, in some areas east of the Coast Ranges of California and Oregon, and in large areas in the Snake River and upper Columbia River drainage basins. In certain areas such as California&#x27;s Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, it was revealed that extremely low numbers of juvenile Chinook salmon (less than 1%) were surviving.

In the western Pacific, the distribution ranges from northern Japan (Hokkaido) in the south to the Arctic Ocean as far as the East Siberian Sea and Palyavaam River in the north. Nevertheless, they are consistently present and the distribution is well known only in Kamchatka. Elsewhere, information is scarce, but they have a patchy presence in the Anadyr River basin and parts of the Chukchi Peninsula. Also, in parts of the northern Magadan Oblast near the Shelikhov Gulf and Penzhina Bay, stocks might persist but remain poorly studied.

===Introduced populations===
In 1967, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources introduced Chinook into Lake Michigan and Lake Huron to control the alewife, an invasive species of nuisance fish from the Atlantic Ocean. In the 1960s, alewives constituted 90% of the biota in these lakes. Coho salmon had been introduced the year before, and the program was successful. Chinook and Coho salmon thrived on the alewives and spawned in the lakes&#x27; tributaries. After this success, Chinook were introduced into the other Great Lakes, where sport fishermen prize them for their aggressive behaviour on the hook.

The species has also established itself in Patagonian waters in South America, where both introduced and escaped hatchery fish have colonized rivers and established stable spawning runs. Chinook salmon have been found spawning in headwater reaches of the Rio Santa Cruz, apparently having migrated over from the ocean. The population is thought to be derived from a single stocking of juveniles in the lower river around 1930.

Sporadic efforts to introduce the fish to New Zealand waters in the late 19th century were largely failures and led to no evident establishments. Initially ova were imported from the Baird hatchery of the McCloud River in California. Further efforts in the early 20th century were more successful and subsequently led to the establishment of spawning runs in the rivers of Canterbury and North Otago: Rangitata River, the Ōpihi River, the Ashburton River, the Rakaia River, the Waimakariri River, the Hurunui River, and the Waiau Uwha River. The success of the latter introductions is thought to be partly attributable to the use of ova from autumn-run populations as opposed to ova from spring-run populations used in the first attempts. Whilst other salmon have also been introduced into New Zealand, only Chinook salmon (or king salmon as it is known locally in New Zealand) have established sizeable pelagic runs.

==Description==

The Chinook is blue-green, red, or purple on the back and on the top of the head, with silvery sides and white ventral surfaces. It has black spots on its tail and the upper half of its body. Although spots are seen on the tail in pink salmon and silver on the tail in coho and chum salmon, Chinook are unique among the Pacific salmon in combining black spots and silver on the tail. Another distinctive feature is a black gum line that is present in both salt and fresh water. Adult fish typically range in size from , but may be up to in length; they average , but may reach . The meat can be either pink or white, depending on what the salmon have been feeding on.

Chinook salmon are the largest of the Pacific salmon. In the Kenai River of Alaska, mature Chinook averaged . The current sport-caught world record, , was caught on May 17, 1985, in the Kenai River. The commercial catch world record is caught near Rivers Inlet, British Columbia, in the late 1970s.

==Life cycle==

Chinook, like many other species of salmon, are considered euryhaline, and thus live in both saltwater and freshwater environments throughout their life. Once hatching, salmon spend one to eight years in the ocean (averaging from three to four years) before returning to their home rivers to spawn. The salmon undergo radical morphological changes as they prepare for the spawning event ahead. Salmon lose the silvery blue they had as ocean fish, and their color darkens, sometimes with a radical change in hue. Salmon are sexually dimorphic, and the male salmon develop canine-like teeth, and their jaws develop a pronounced curve or hook called a &quot;kype&quot;. Studies have shown that larger and more dominant male salmon have a reproductive advantage as female Chinook are often more aggressive toward smaller males.

Chinook spawn in larger and deeper waters than other salmon species and can be found on the spawning redds (nests) from September to December. The female salmon may lay her eggs in four to five nesting pockets within a redd. After laying eggs, females guard the redd from four to 25 days before dying, while males seek additional mates. Chinook eggs hatch 90 to 150 days after deposition, depending upon water temperature. Egg deposits are timed to ensure the young salmon fry emerge during an appropriate season for survival and growth. Fry and parr (young fish) usually stay in fresh water for 12 to 18 months before traveling downstream to estuaries, where they remain as smolts for several months. Some Chinook return to fresh water one or two years earlier than their counterparts and are referred to as &quot;jack&quot; salmon. &quot;Jack&quot; salmon are typically less than long but are sexually mature.

The Yukon River has the longest freshwater migration route of any salmon, over from its mouth in the Bering Sea to spawning grounds upstream of Whitehorse, Yukon. Since Chinook rely on fat reserves for energy upon re-entering fresh water, commercial fish caught here are highly prized for their unusually high levels of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. However, the high costs of harvest and transport from this rural area limits its affordability. The highest elevation Chinook spawn is in the Middle Fork and Upper Salmon River in Idaho. These fish travel over in elevation, and over , in their migration through eight dams and reservoirs on the Columbia and Lower Snake Rivers.

Chinook eat amphipods and other crustaceans and insects while young, and primarily other fish when older. Young salmon feed in streambeds for a short period until they are strong enough to journey out to the ocean and acquire more food. Chinook juveniles divide into two types: ocean-type and stream-type. Ocean-type Chinook migrate to salt water in their first year. Stream-type salmon spend one full year in fresh water before migrating to the ocean. After a few years in the ocean, adult salmon, then large enough to escape most predators, return to their natal streambeds to mate. Chinook can have extended lifespans, in which some fish spend one to five years in the ocean, reaching age eight. More northerly populations tend to have longer lives.
Salmon need suitable spawning habitat. Clean, cool, oxygenated, sediment-free fresh water is essential for egg development. Chinook use larger sediment (gravel) sizes for spawning than other Pacific salmon. Riparian vegetation and woody debris help juvenile salmon by providing cover and maintaining low water temperatures.

Chinook also need healthy ocean habitats. Juvenile salmon grow in clean, productive estuarine environments and gain the energy for migration. Later, they change physiologically to live in salt water. They rely on eelgrass and seaweeds for camouflage (protection from predators), shelter, and foraging habitat as they make their way to the open ocean. Adult fish need a rich, open ocean habitat to acquire the strength needed to travel back upstream, escape predators, and reproduce before dying. In his book &quot;King of Fish&quot;, David Montgomery writes, &quot;The reserves of fish at sea are important to restocking rivers disturbed by natural catastrophes.&quot; Thus, it is vitally important for the fish to reach the oceans to grow into healthy adult fish to sustain the species without being impeded by man-made structures such as dams.

The bodies of water for salmon habitat must be clean and oxygenated. One sign of high productivity and growth rate in the oceans is the level of algae. Increased algal levels lead to higher levels of carbon dioxide in the water, which transfers into living organisms, fostering underwater plants and small organisms, which salmon eat. Algae can filter high levels of toxins and pollutants. Thus, it is essential for algae and other water-filtering agents not to be destroyed in the oceans because they contribute to the well-being of the food chain.
With some populations endangered, precautions are necessary to prevent overfishing and habitat destruction, including appropriate management of hydroelectric and irrigation projects. If too few fish remain because of fishing and land management practices, salmon have more difficulty reproducing. When one of these factors is compromised, affected stock can decline. One &quot;Seattle Times&quot; article states, &quot;Pacific salmon have disappeared from 40 percent of their historic range outside Alaska,&quot; and concludes it is imperative for people to realize the needs of salmon and try not to contribute to destructive practices that harm salmon runs.

In the Pacific Northwest, the summer runs of especially large Chinook once common (before dams and overfishing led to declines) were known as June hogs.

A Chinook&#x27;s birthplace and later evolution can be tracked by looking at its otolith (ear) bone. The bone can record the chemical composition of the water the fish had lived in, just as a tree&#x27;s growth rings provide hints about dry and wet years. The bone is built with the chemical signature of the environment that hosted the fish. Researchers were able to tell where different individuals of Chinook were born and lived in the first year of their lives. Testing was done by measuring the strontium in the bones. Strontium can accurately show researchers the exact location and time of a fish swimming in a river.

==Fishing industry==
===Wild capture===
The total North Pacific fisheries harvest of the Chinook salmon in 2010 was some 1.4 million fish, corresponding to 7,000 tonnes; 1.1 million of the fish were captured in the United States, and others were divided between Canada and Russia. The share of Chinook salmon from the total commercial Pacific salmon harvest was less than 1% by weight and only about 0.3% of the number of fish. The trend has been down in the captures compared to the period before 1990, when the total harvest had been around 25,000 tonnes. Global production has, however, remained at a stable level because of increased aquaculture.

===Aquaculture===


The world&#x27;s largest producer and market supplier of Chinook salmon is New Zealand. In 2009, New Zealand exported of Chinook salmon, marketed as king salmon, equating to a value of NZ$61 million in export earnings. For the year ended March 2011, this amount had increased to NZ$85 million. New Zealand accounts for about half of the global production of Chinook salmon, and about half of New Zealand&#x27;s production is exported. Japan is New Zealand&#x27;s largest export market, with stock also being supplied to other countries of the Pacific Rim, including Australia.

Farming of the species in New Zealand began in the 1970s when hatcheries were initially set up to enhance and support wild fish stocks, with the first commercial operations starting in 1976. After some opposition against their establishment by societal groups, including anglers, the first sea cage farm was established in 1983 at Big Glory Bay in Stewart Island by British Petroleum NZ Ltd.
Today, the salmon are hatched in land-based hatcheries (several of which exist) and transferred to sea cages or freshwater farms, where they are grown out to the harvestable size of . The broodstock for the farms is usually selected from existing farm stock or sometimes sourced from wild populations. Eggs and milt are stripped manually from sexually mature salmon and incubated under conditions replicating the streams and rivers where the salmon would spawn naturally (at around ). After hatching, the baby salmon are typically grown to the smolt stage (around six months of age) before they are transferred to the sea cages or ponds. Most sea cage farming occurs in the Marlborough Sounds, Stewart Island, and Akaroa Harbour, while freshwater operations in Canterbury, Otago, and Tasman use ponds, raceways, and hydro canals for grow-out operations.
Low stocking densities, ranging between less than 1 kg/m3 and around 25 kg/m3 (depending on the life stage of the salmon), and the absence of disease in the fish mean New Zealand farmers do not need to use antibiotics or vaccines to maintain the health of their salmon stocks. The salmon are fed food pellets of fish meal specially formulated for Chinook salmon (typical proportions of the feed are: 45% protein, 22% fat, and 14% carbohydrate plus ash and water) that contain no steroids or other growth enhancers.
Regulations and monitoring programmes ensure salmon are farmed in a sustainable manner. The planning and approval process for new salmon farms in New Zealand considers the farm&#x27;s potential environmental effects, its effects on fishing activities (if it is a marine farm), and any possible cultural and social effects. In the interest of fish welfare, a number of New Zealand salmon farming operations anaesthetise salmon before slaughter using Aqui-S™, an organically based anaesthetic developed in New Zealand that is safe for use in food and that has been favourably reported on by the British Humane Slaughter Association. In recognition of the sustainable, environmentally conscious practices, the New Zealand salmon farming industry has been acknowledged as the world&#x27;s greenest by the Global Aquaculture Performance Index.

Chile is the only country other than New Zealand currently producing significant quantities of farmed Chinook salmon. The United States has not produced farmed Chinook in commercial quantities since 1994. In Canada, most commercial Chinook salmon farming ceased by 2009.

===Management===
==== Pacific coast ====

Fisheries in the U.S. and Canada are limited by impacts to weak and endangered salmon runs. Nine populations of Chinook salmon are listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) as either threatened or endangered. In the Snake River, Spring/Summer Chinook and Fall Chinook are ESA listed as Threatened. The fall and late-fall runs in the Central Valley population in California is a U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) species of concern.

The Center for Biological Diversity and Pacific Rivers, a conservation advocacy group, are currently petitioning for an ESA listing on Chinook in several river basins in Washington state, including the Chehalis, Quinault, Queets, Hoh and Quillayute. The petition, filed in 2023, focuses on spring-run Chinook, the region&#x27;s most vulnerable salmon population.

In April 2008, commercial fisheries in both Oregon and California were closed in response to the low count of Chinook salmon present because of the collapse of the Sacramento River run, one of the biggest south of the Columbia. In April 2009, California again canceled the season. The Pacific Fishery Management Council&#x27;s goal for the Sacramento River run is an escapement total (fish that return to freshwater spawn areas and hatcheries) of 122,000–180,000 fish. The 2007 escapement was estimated at 88,000, and the 2008 estimate was 66,000 fish. Scientists from universities and federal, state, and tribal agencies concluded the 2004 and 2005 broods were harmed by poor ocean conditions in 2005 and 2006, in addition to &quot;a long-term, steady degradation of the freshwater and estuarine environment.&quot; Such conditions included weak upwelling, warm sea surface temperatures, and low densities of food.

In Oregon, the 2010 spring Chinook run was forecast to increase by up to 150% over 2009 populations, growing from 200,000 to over 500,000, making this the largest run in recorded history. Lower temperatures in 2008 North Pacific waters brought in fatter plankton, which, along with greater outflows of Columbia River water, fed the resurgent populations. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife estimated 80% were hatchery-born. Chinook runs in other habitats have not recovered proportionately.

In April 2016, Coleman National Fish Hatchery outside of Red Bluff, California, released 12 million juvenile Chinook salmon, with many salmon being tagged for monitoring. The release was done in hopes of helping restore the salmon population of Battle Creek.

In June 2021, the California State Water Resources Control Board approved a plan by the United States Bureau of Reclamation to release water from Lake Shasta for irrigation use, which &quot;significantly&quot; increased the risk of extinction of winter-run Chinook in the Sacramento River.

In an effort to restore the fish habitat of the Klamath River, four dams on the Klamath (Iron Gate Dam, Copco No 2 Dam, Copco No 1 Dam, and John C. Boyle Dam) will be removed by the end of 2024. Klamath River Renewal Corporation (KRRC), who is in charge of the operation, cited the adverse effects of the dams on fish survivability and the blockage of fish habitat as major reasons for removal. In June 2023, Copco 2 Dam was torn down. In addition to dam removal, KRRC is also conducting efforts to revegetate certain areas in the watershed with trees and native grasses. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife(ODFW), in cooperation with members of the Klamath and Yurok tribes, also finalized a two-phase plan to re-establish wild Chinook and other anadromous fishes in the Upper Klamath Basin. As of December 2022, the plan is in its monitoring phase, in which ODFW are studying 10,000 hatchery-born spring-run Chinook released in certain tributaries of Upper Klamath Lake.

==== Lake Michigan ====
Introduced Chinook salmon in Lake Michigan are sought after by tourists enjoying chartered fishing trips. A 2016 survey of Wisconsin anglers found they would, on average, pay $140 for a trip to catch Chinook salmon, $90 for lake trout, and $180 for walleye. Should the Chinook salmon fishery collapse and be replaced with a native lake trout fishery, the economic value would decrease by 80%.

== Recent data ==
Since the later 1970s, the size and age range of Chinook salmon have been declining according to studies along the northwest Pacific coast from Alaska to California for the years of 1977 to 2015 which examined about 1.5 million Chinook salmon. Ocean-5 Chinook (which means the fish has spent five years in the ocean) have declined from being up to 3–5% of the population to being almost none. Ocean-4 chinook are also seeing a rapid decline in their population. This means that Chinook are not living as long as they used to. This trend has mostly been seen in Alaska, but also Oregon and Washington.

New trends have also been seen regarding the size of Ocean-1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 from 1975 to 2015. The size of Chinook who have spent one and two years in the ocean has been rising, while the size of Chinook of three to five years has been declining. The size increase was seen mainly in hatchery fish, not wild, and hatchery fish were often larger than wild, but the decrease was seen in both types of populations. Factors have been discovered that have influenced the size of the Chinook. They include, but are not limited to, the years they spent in fresh water before migrating to the ocean, the time of year they were caught, which season run they participated in, and where they were caught. However, what is causing these negative trends is still not fully known or researched. Some possibilities can be climate change, pollution, and fishing practices.

In California specifically, Chinook populations in the rivers have been declining. Chinook that are migratory are already more vulnerable, and the California drought made them even more vulnerable. A study was done specifically on the California Delta over three years, and it was discovered that the Chinook salmon had a low survival rate for different reasons, and as a result, the Chinook salmon population here has been on a decline. Some of the factors affecting the populations include the route used during migration, drought conditions, the amount of snowmelt, and infrastructure that affects the flow of water (such as dams and levees). Each of these factors has significantly impacted Chinook survival rates, as most have made it more challenging for Chinook to travel from their spawning grounds to the ocean and back. The fluctuation of water depth as well as temperature have made this more challenging, and as a result, Chinook populations are declining. Which rivers or streams the Chinook are in highly impacts their survival rates, as some, like the Chinook in the Fraser River, only have a 30% survival rate. More studies and actions are needed for there to be an impact on the survival rates of the Chinook. Due to many of these reasons, the National Wildlife Federation has listed Chinook populations as endangered or threatened.

==Cultural aspects==
The Chinook salmon is spiritually and culturally prized among certain First Nations peoples. For tribes on the Northwest coast, salmon were an important part of their culture for spiritual reasons and food. Many celebrate the first spring Chinook caught each year with &quot;first-salmon ceremonies&quot;. While salmon fishing in general remains important economically for many tribal communities, it is especially the Chinook harvest that is typically the most valuable. The relation to salmon for the tribes in this area is similar to how other tribes relied more on buffalo for food, and have many legends and spiritual ties to them.

Chinook salmon were described and enthusiastically eaten by the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Lewis wrote that, when fresh, they tasted better than any other fish he had ever eaten. They did not particularly like dried or &quot;pounded&quot; salmon. Lewis and Clark knew about Pacific salmon but had never seen one. The Western world had known about Pacific salmon since the late 18th century. Maritime fur traders and explorers, such as George Vancouver, frequently acquired salmon by trade with the indigenous people of the Northwest coast. Lewis and Clark first encountered Chinook salmon as a gift from Chief Cameahwait, on August 13, 1805, near Lemhi Pass. Tasting it convinced Lewis they had crossed the continental divide.

In Oregon, many Native American tribes, including the Klamath tribes and the Yurok Tribe, have lived along the Klamath river, and the Chinook salmon have been an important part of their lives, spiritually and physically. An Indian legend of a tribe on the Klamath river describes how the construction of the dam has hurt the fish population and that the impact on them has gone unnoticed, and the destruction of the dam is what has brought back their food supply and made them happy again. The Klamath tribe had a similar legend that has illustrated the importance of not messing up the Chinook salmon migration. The legend described three Skookums which can be related to the three dams on the Klamath river in California. It has been known that the creation of dams has negatively impacted the lives of many Native American Indians by disrupting their food supply and the flow of water. The impact on the salmon migration has been seen by not only tribal members but others as well, and as a result, progress is slowly being made to help restore the salmon habitats along the river. Many tribes, including the Hoopa Valley Tribe, Karuk Tribe, Yurok Tribe, and the Shasta Indian Nation, voiced support for the removal of dams on the Klamath River. Representatives of the Shasta Indian Nation claimed that the construction of Copco No 1 Dam caused the submerging of sites significant to them, including burial grounds. Un-Dam the Klamath, supported by the Karuk and Yurok Tribes, is one of the major campaigns advocating for the Klamath dam removals, which started deconstruction in 2023.

Other tribes, including the Nuxalk, Kwakiutl, and Kyuquot, relied primarily on Chinook to eat. Known as the &quot;king salmon&quot; in Alaska for its large size and flavorful flesh, the Chinook is the state fish of this state, and of Oregon.

<text>Villaba ( ), officially the Municipality of Villaba (; ; ), is a municipality in the province of Leyte, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 42,859 people.

Villaba is a coastal municipality in the province of Leyte. The municipality covers a land area of 150.31 square kilometers (58.04 square miles), accounting for 2.37% of Leyte&#x27;s total area. According to the 2020 Census, its population was 42,859, representing 2.41% of Leyte&#x27;s total population and 0.94% of the entire Eastern Visayas region. This results in a population density of 285 inhabitants per square kilometer (738 inhabitants per square mile).

==History==

=== Pre-Spanish history ===
The existence of the place now known as Villaba was discovered in about the last quarter of the sixteenth century by Boholano traders. These traders landed on the western coast and found fertile plains along the river and forest. The sea coast also proved to be good fishing ground. The settlers built their houses along the banks of the river and banded into groups to protect themselves from the &quot;moro&quot; pirates and wild animals. Along the banks of the river were &quot;Hindang&quot; trees which grew in abundance so they called the new settlement &quot;Hamindangon&quot; (full of &quot;hindang&quot; trees).

As the years passed, more settlers migrated from Bohol and Cebu. These new inhabitants likewise settled on the plains along the &quot;Hamindangon&quot; River.

=== Spanish period ===
During the expedition of the entire Eastern Visayas by Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot; in 1593, a group of Spaniards, led by the General-Governor&#x27;s son, Luis Pérez Dasmariñas landed on the shores of &quot;Hamindangon&quot; and the named the place &quot;Nueva Galicia&quot; in honor of his father, the Governor-General of the Philippines, Gomez Perez Dasmariñas who is from Galicia, Spain.

The governor set sail from Cavite for Pintado province in October 1593, to join the part of the fleet under Luis Pérez who is already at the Visayas. Before he proceeded to Moluccas, Luis Pérez introduced the &quot;barrio&quot; of &quot;Nueva Galicia&quot; to the whole fleet. But the Governor-General renamed the place to Vilalba (from the Spanish town in Galicia region) in order not to confused with other Nueva Galicia town that is located in Mexico.

Over the years, the natives of the &quot;barrio&quot; had problem of Spanish accented digraphs, mispronouncing Vilalba ( ) with Villaba (: ), and perhaps, it is easier to pronounce the later name and thus retained it when the town was officially established in June 1910.

=== American period ===
The Spanish was defeated by the Americans who started their occupation of the Philippines on August 13, 1898. The following year, there was a popular revolt in the Visayas particularly in Samar and Leyte called the &quot;Pulahanes&quot; movement. One consequence of that revolution against the Americans was that the town of Villaba was reduced to a barrio and became part of the municipality of San Isidro, Leyte.

During that period, Villaba was then ran by local executives known as &quot;cabeza de barangay&quot;. For want of official records however, to provide a complete list and their specific terms of office, the following have served in the said capacity:

# Andres Gervacio
# Antonio Dejillo
# Fortunato Cabilar
# Hermogenes Tumamak
# Casimiro Tumamak
# Tomas Tumamak
# Luciano Domael

=== The Villaba Town ===
In June 1910, the Provincial Board of Leyte passed and approved a resolution creating the Municipality of Villaba. Since then, there was a continuous change of Chief Executives in the municipality up to the present.
===Barangays===

Villaba is politically subdivided into 35 barangays.

<doc id="1212895" wikidata="Q411664" url="?curid=1212895" title="Exonuclease">
<text>Exonucleases are enzymes that work by cleaving nucleotides one at a time from the end (exo) of a polynucleotide chain. A hydrolyzing reaction that breaks phosphodiester bonds at either the 3′ or the 5′ end occurs. Its close relative is the endonuclease, which cleaves phosphodiester bonds in the middle (endo) of a polynucleotide chain. Eukaryotes and prokaryotes have three types of exonucleases involved in the normal turnover of mRNA: 5′ to 3′ exonuclease (Xrn1), which is a dependent decapping protein; 3′ to 5′ exonuclease, an independent protein; and poly(A)-specific 3′ to 5′ exonuclease.

In both archaea and eukaryotes, one of the main routes of RNA degradation is performed by the multi-protein exosome complex, which consists largely of 3′ to 5′ exoribonucleases.

==Significance to polymerase==

RNA polymerase II is known to be in effect during transcriptional termination; it works with a 5&#x27; exonuclease (human gene Xrn2) to degrade the newly formed transcript downstream, leaving the polyadenylation site and simultaneously shooting the polymerase. This process involves the exonuclease&#x27;s catching up to the pol II and terminating the transcription.

Pol I then synthesizes DNA nucleotides in place of the RNA primer it had just removed. DNA polymerase I also has 3&#x27; to 5&#x27; and 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; exonuclease activity, which is used in editing and proofreading DNA for errors. The 3&#x27; to 5&#x27; can only remove one mononucleotide at a time, and the 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; activity can remove mononucleotides or up to 10 nucleotides at a time.

==&quot;E. coli&quot; types==
In 1971, Lehman IR discovered exonuclease I in &quot;E. coli&quot;. Since that time, there have been numerous discoveries including: exonuclease, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, and VIII. Each type of exonuclease has a specific type of function or requirement.

&quot;Exonuclease I&quot; breaks apart single-stranded DNA in a 3&#x27; → 5&#x27; direction, releasing deoxyribonucleoside 5&#x27;-monophosphates one after another. It does not cleave DNA strands without terminal 3&#x27;-OH groups because they are blocked by phosphoryl or acetyl groups.
&quot;Exonuclease II&quot; is associated with DNA polymerase I, which contains a 5&#x27; exonuclease that clips off the RNA primer contained immediately upstream from the site of DNA synthesis in a 5&#x27; → 3&#x27; manner.

Exonuclease III has four catalytic activities:
* 3&#x27; to 5&#x27; exodeoxyribonuclease activity, which is specific for double-stranded DNA
* RNase activity
* 3&#x27; phosphatase activity
* AP endonuclease activity (later found to be called endonuclease II).

Exonuclease IV adds a water molecule, so it can break the bond of an oligonucleotide to nucleoside 5&#x27; monophosphate. This exonuclease requires Mg 2+ in order to function and works at higher temperatures than exonuclease I.

Exonuclease V is a 3&#x27; to 5&#x27; hydrolyzing enzyme that catalyzes linear double-stranded DNA and single-stranded DNA, which requires Ca2+. This enzyme is extremely important in the process of homologous recombination.

Exonuclease VIII is 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; dimeric protein that does not require ATP or any gaps or nicks in the strand, but requires a free 5&#x27; OH group to carry out its function .

==dnaQ==

In &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; the &quot;dnaQ&quot; gene encodes the ε subunit of DNA polymerase III . The ε subunit is one of three core proteins of the DNA polymerase complex. It acts as a 3’→5’ DNA directed proofreading exonuclease that removes incorrectly incorporated bases during replication. Similarly, in &quot;Salmonella typhimurium&quot; bacteria, the 3’ to 5’ editing function employed during DNA replication is also encoded by a gene, &quot;dnaQ&quot;, which specifies a 3’ to 5’ exonuclease subunit, one of the three separately encoded core proteins of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. 

In contrast to &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;S. typhimurium&quot;, where the polymerase and editing functions are encoded by separate genes, in the bacterial species &quot;Buchnera aphidicola&quot; the DNA polymerase encoded by the DNA III (polC) gene contains both DNA polymerase and 3’ to 5’ exonuclease domains. An evolutionary divergence (about 0.25 to 1.2 billion years ago), appears to have been associated with the separation of the DNA polymerase gene function from the 3’ to 5’ exonuclease editing gene function in the lineage that led to &quot;E. coli&quot; and &quot;S. typhimurium&quot;.

==Discoveries in humans==

The 3&#x27; to 5&#x27; human type endonuclease is known to be essential for the proper processing of histone pre-mRNA, in which U7 snRNP directs the single cleavage process. Following the removal of the downstream cleavage product (DCP) Xrn1 continues to further breakdown the product until it is completely degraded. This allows the nucleotides to be recycled. Xrn1 is linked to a co-transcriptional cleavage (CoTC) activity that acts as a precursor to develop a free 5&#x27; unprotected end, so the exonuclease can remove and degrade the downstream cleavage product (DCP). This initiates transcriptional termination because one does not want DNA or RNA strands building up in their bodies.

==Discoveries in yeast==

CCR4-Not is a general transcription regulatory complex in budding yeast that is found to be associated with mRNA metabolism, transcription initiation, and mRNA degradation. CCR4 has been found to contain RNA and single-stranded DNA 3&#x27; to 5&#x27; exonuclease activities. Another component associated with the CCR4-Not is CAF1 protein, which has been found to contain 3&#x27; to 5&#x27; or 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; exonuclease domains in the mouse and &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;. This protein has not been found in yeast, which suggests that it is likely to have an abnormal exonuclease domain like the one seen in a metazoan. Yeast contains Rat1 and Xrn1 exonuclease. The Rat1 works just like the human type (Xrn2) and Xrn1 function in the cytoplasm is in the 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; direction to degrade RNAs (pre-5.8s and 25s rRNAs) in the absence of Rat1.

==Discoveries in Coronaviruses==

In beta Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, a proof reading exonuclease, nsp14-ExoN, that is part of the viral genome is responsible for recombination that is implicated in novel strain emergence.

<doc id="1212903" wikidata="Q934087" url="?curid=1212903" title="William Castle">
<text>William Castle (born William Schloss Jr.; April 24, 1914 – May 31, 1977) was an American film director, producer, screenwriter, and actor.

Orphaned at 11, Castle dropped out of high school at 15 to work in the theater. He came to the attention of Columbia Pictures for his talent for promotion and was hired. He learned the trade of filmmaking and became a director, acquiring a reputation for being able to churn out competent B-movies quickly and on budget. He eventually struck out on his own, producing and directing thrillers, which, despite their low budgets, he effectively promoted using gimmicks, a trademark for which he is best known. He was also the producer for &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;.

==Personal life==
Castle was born in New York City, the son of Saidie (Snellenberg) and William Schloss. His family was Jewish. His mother died when he was nine. When his father followed a year later, he was left an orphan at the age of 11. He then lived with his older sister.

&quot;Schloss&quot; is German for &quot;castle&quot;, and Castle later translated his surname into English as his professional name.

Castle married Ellen Falck, with whom he had two children.

==Career==

===Getting started===
At 13, Castle saw the play &quot;Dracula&quot;, starring Bela Lugosi, and was entranced. He watched performance after performance, eventually managing to meet Lugosi himself. He wrote in his autobiography &quot;Step Right Up! I&#x27;m Gonna Scare the Pants off America:&quot; &quot;I knew then what I wanted to do with my life—I wanted to scare the pants off audiences.&quot; Lugosi recommended him for the position of assistant stage manager for the road company tour of the play. The 15-year-old dropped out of high school to take the job. He spent his teenage years working on Broadway in jobs ranging from set-building to acting, which proved good training for the future filmmaker.

He obtained Orson Welles&#x27; telephone number and persuaded Welles to lease him the Stony Creek Theatre in Connecticut. (Welles was leaving to begin filming &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.) He hired German actress Ellen Schwanneke; upon learning that, under then-current theater guild regulations, German-born actors could appear only in plays originally performed in Germany, Castle claimed he had hired her for the nonexistent play &quot;Das ist nicht für Kinder&quot; (&quot;Not for Children&quot;), then spent the following weekend writing the play and having it translated into German. When Nazi Germany sent Schwanneke an invitation to a Munich performance, Castle seized the opportunity for an outrageous publicity stunt. He released to the newspapers what he claimed was a telegram he had sent turning down the request, portraying his star as &quot;the girl who said no to Hitler.&quot; To add to the sensationalism, he secretly vandalized the theatre and painted swastikas on the exterior. It worked—the resulting publicity ensured the play&#x27;s success.

===Columbia Pictures and other studios===

He left for Hollywood at 23 to work for Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures. Beginning as a dialogue director for &quot;Music in My Heart&quot; (1940), he and several others, such as Fred Sears, Mel Ferrer, Henry Levin and Robert Gordon, were selected as feature film directors.

In the 2007 documentary &quot;Spine Tingler! The William Castle Story&quot;, Castle&#x27;s daughter states he had a dynamic, outgoing personality that attracted others. He was one of the few people Cohn liked. He learned the film business and graduated to directing inexpensive B-movies, the first being &quot;The Chance of a Lifetime&quot;, released in 1943. He directed four movies in &quot;The Whistler&quot; series, and gained a reputation for making films quickly and under budget. He also worked as an associate producer on Orson Welles&#x27; film noir &quot;The Lady from Shanghai&quot; (1947), doing much second unit location work.

===On his own: the gimmicks===
Ambitions unsatisfied, Castle began making films independently. The inspiration of the 1955 French psychological thriller &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; set the genre he would choose. He financed his first movie, &quot;Macabre&quot; (1958), by mortgaging his house. He came up with the idea to give every customer a certificate for a $1,000 life insurance policy from Lloyd&#x27;s of London in case they should die of fright during the film. He stationed nurses in the lobbies with hearses parked outside the theaters. &quot;Macabre&quot; was a hit.

Other films (and gimmicks) followed:
* &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; (1959), filmed in &quot;Emergo&quot;. A skeleton with red lighted eye sockets attached to wire floated over the audience in the final moments of some showings of the film to parallel the action on screen when a skeleton rises from a vat of acid and pursues the villainous wife of Vincent Price&#x27;s character. Once word spread about the skeleton, kids enjoyed trying to knock it down with candy boxes, soda cups, or any other objects at hand.

* &quot;The Tingler&quot; (1959), filmed in &quot;Percepto&quot;. The title character is a creature that attaches itself to the human spinal cord. It is activated by fright and can be destroyed only by screaming. Castle purchased military surplus airplane wing de-icers (consisting of vibrating motors) and had a crew travel from theatre to theatre, attaching them to the undersides of some of the seats (in that era, a movie did not necessarily open on the same night nationwide). In the finale, one of the creatures is said to have gotten loose in the movie theater itself. The buzzers were activated as the film&#x27;s star, Vincent Price, warned the audience to &quot;scream—scream for your lives!&quot; Some sources incorrectly state the seats were wired to give electrical jolts. Filmmaker and Castle fan John Waters recounted in &quot;Spine Tingler!&quot; how, as a youngster, he searched for a seat that had been wired to enjoy the full effect.
* &quot;13 Ghosts&quot; (1960), filmed in &quot;Illusion-O.&quot; Each patron received a handheld ghost viewer/remover. During certain segments of the film, a person could see the ghosts by looking through the red cellophane or hide them by looking through the blue. Without the viewer, the ghosts were somewhat visible. The DVD release included red/blue glasses (not 3D glasses, as sometimes reported) to replicate the effect.
* &quot;Homicidal&quot; (1961). There was a &quot;fright break&quot; with a timer overlaid on the film&#x27;s climax, as the heroine approaches a house harboring a sadistic killer. The audience had 45 seconds to leave and get a full refund if they were too frightened to see the remainder of the film. In an early showing, wily patrons simply sat through the movie a second time and left at the break to get their money back; to prevent this in future, Castle had different color tickets printed for each showing. About 1% of patrons still demanded refunds. John Waters described Castle&#x27;s response:

William Castle simply went nuts. He came up with &quot;Coward&#x27;s Corner,&quot; a yellow cardboard booth, manned by a bewildered theater employee in the lobby. When the Fright Break was announced, and you found that you couldn&#x27;t take it anymore, you had to leave your seat and, in front of the entire audience, follow yellow footsteps up the aisle, bathed in a yellow light. Before you reached Coward&#x27;s Corner, you crossed yellow lines with the stenciled message: &quot;Cowards Keep Walking.&quot; You passed a nurse (in a yellow uniform?...I wonder), who would offer a blood-pressure test. All the while a recording was blaring, &quot;Watch the chicken! Watch him shiver in Coward&#x27;s Corner!&quot; As the audience howled, you had to go through one final indignity – at Coward&#x27;s Corner you were forced to sign a yellow card stating, &quot;I am a bona fide coward.&quot;

:In a trailer for the film, Castle explained the use of the Coward&#x27;s Certificate and admonished the viewer not to reveal the ending to friends &quot;or they will kill you. If they don&#x27;t, I will.&quot;
* &quot;Mr. Sardonicus&quot; (1961). The audience could vote on the villain&#x27;s fate in a &quot;punishment poll&quot; during the climax—Castle appeared on screen to explain two options. Each member of the audience was given a card with a glow-in-the-dark thumb they could hold up or down to decide if Mr. Sardonicus should be cured or die. Supposedly no audience ever chose mercy, so the alternate ending was never screened. Though Castle claimed in his autobiography that the merciful version was shot and shown occasionally, many suspect otherwise. In the drive-in version, drivers were asked to flash their car headlights to choose.
* &quot;Zotz!&quot; (1962). Each patron was given a &quot;magic&quot; (gold colored, plastic, glow-in-the-dark) coin.
* &quot;13 Frightened Girls&quot; (1963). Castle launched a publicized worldwide casting hunt for the prettiest girls from different countries (not 13 as in the title, but 15). He filmed slightly different versions, highlighting each girl for the release in her country.
* &quot;Strait-Jacket&quot; (1964). Advised by his financial backers to eliminate gimmicks, Castle hired Joan Crawford to star and sent her on a promotional tour to select theatres. At the last minute, Castle had cardboard axes printed that were handed out to patrons.
* &quot;I Saw What You Did&quot; (1965). Another Joan Crawford vehicle, this film was initially promoted using giant plastic telephones, but after a rash of prank phone calls and complaints, the Bell Telephone Company monopoly refused Castle permission to use them or mention telephones. So he turned the back rows of theatres into &quot;Shock Sections.&quot; Seat belts were installed to keep patrons from being jolted from their chairs in fright.
* &quot;Bug&quot; (1975). Castle advertised a million-dollar life insurance policy for the film&#x27;s star, &quot;Hercules&quot; the cockroach.

At the height of his popularity, Castle had a fan club with 250,000 members.

===&quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;===
According to &quot;Spine Tingler! The William Castle Story&quot;, he mortgaged his home (again) and obtained the movie rights to the Ira Levin novel before it was published, hoping to finally direct a prestigious A-movie himself. He made a deal with Paramount Pictures, then under Robert Evans, who insisted on hiring director Roman Polanski. Castle had to settle for producing the film. He had a cameo, playing the grey-haired man standing outside the phone booth where Rosemary, played by Mia Farrow, is attempting to get in touch with the obstetrician.

Castle was unable to build on the film&#x27;s success. He suffered kidney failure soon after its release. By the time he recovered, all momentum had been lost, and he went back to making B-movies. His most significant acting role was also his last—as the director of the doomed &quot;Waterloo&quot; epic in &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; in 1975.

==Death==
Castle died on May 31, 1977, in Los Angeles, California, of a heart attack. He is interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

==Legacy==
Alfred Hitchcock decided to make &quot;Psycho&quot; after noting the financial success of 1950s B-movies by Castle and Roger Corman.

Among his admirers is filmmaker John Waters, who wrote, &quot;William Castle was my idol. His films made me want to make films... William Castle was God.&quot; Waters portrayed Castle in the episode &quot;Hagsploitation&quot; in the first season of the FX television anthology series &quot;Feud&quot;, depicting the notorious rivalry between Bette Davis and Joan Crawford through the production and aftermath of &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; Waters (playing Castle) appeared onstage at an Oklahoma theater in 1964, exuberantly introducing a screening of &quot;Strait-Jacket&quot; while Jessica Lange (as Crawford) proceeded down the aisle, wincing and wielding an axe past hooting teenagers before pursuing Castle behind a backlit scrim to &quot;decapitate&quot; him in silhouette.

He is Robert Zemeckis&#x27;s &quot;favorite filmmaker.&quot; Zemeckis co-founded Dark Castle Entertainment, which was intended to remake Castle&#x27;s films. They remade two of Castle&#x27;s movies, &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot; in 1999 and &quot;Thirteen Ghosts&quot; in 2001 together with his daughter Terry Ann Castle as co-producer. Dark Castle Entertainment went on to produce original material and remakes of non-Castle films.

A documentary focusing on Castle&#x27;s life, &quot;Spine Tingler! The William Castle Story&quot;, directed by Jeffrey Schwarz, premiered at AFI Fest 2007 in Los Angeles on November 8, 2007. It won the Audience Award for Best Documentary.

The protagonist in the 1993 film &quot;Matinee&quot;, played by John Goodman, is based on Castle.

<text>The U.S. Virgin Islands national soccer team, nicknamed &quot;The Dashing Eagles&quot;, is the national soccer team of the U.S. Virgin Islands and is controlled by the U.S. Virgin Islands Soccer Federation.

==History==
Though FIFA did not officially recognize the USVI team as affiliated until 1992, the Virgin Islands federation was founded in the 1970s by Trinidad native Robert T. Wills who helped build the base of the USVI Soccer Federation as it is known today. The team played its first official international match on March 21, 1998, in a victory against the British Virgin Islands. In May 2011, the USVI soccer federation chief, Frederick Hillaren, began ambitious changes in the team and appointed Keith Griffith, former coach and captain of the Barbados national team and former coach of Trinidad and Tobago powerhouse club team Joe Public F.C., as technical director. Within two months of Griffith&#x27;s appointment, the team shot up 51 places in the FIFA World Rankings. Soccer is the third most popular sport on the islands.

== Stadium ==
Previously the team did not have a national stadium and were forced to play their home matches at Lionel Roberts Park, a baseball stadium in Charlotte Amalie. For their 2014 World Cup qualification matches, the team needed to bring in a new grass surface and make other special arrangements. In the past, the team has played at Paul E. Joseph Stadium in St. Croix. However, in February 2012, it was announced that the stadium was condemned and will be demolished to make way for a new sports complex that will cost at least $50 million. The complex will contain venues for tennis, volleyball, baseball, and aquatics. However, the plans did not include a new soccer stadium.

For the 2018 World Cup qualification, the team played at the Addelita Cancryn Junior High School Ground where they suffered a 4–0 loss to the Barbados national team.

In August 2019, the USVI Soccer Association officially opened the 1,200-seat Bethlehem Soccer Stadium in Christiansted after an almost four-year construction process of the new complex.

<doc id="1212908" wikidata="Q5471608" url="?curid=1212908" title="Fort McAllister">
<text>Fort McAllister was a Confederate earthen-work fort used to defend Savannah, Georgia during the American Civil War. It was the southernmost of the forts defending Savannah and was involved in the most battles. It was located on the Ogeechee River in Bryan County. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (#70000197). Fort McAllister was one of three forts protecting Savannah, the others being Fort Pulaski and Fort James Jackson standing in Confederate defiance of the Union naval blockade. The southeast coast of the United States was the place where both combatants tested the latest in naval artillery and coastal defenses. Fort McAllister was the key to unlocking the defenses around Savannah, one of the most important Confederate ports on the Atlantic Ocean.

==History==
The fort was designed by Capt. John McCrady. In 1861 Gen. Robert E. Lee inspected the fort and recommended making it stronger. McCrady made the changes recommended by Lee and the earthen walls were better able to withstand bombardment from artillery fire. The fort had seven cannon emplacements. The bombproof area in the center housed a hospital, supply area, barracks, officer&#x27;s quarters, gun power, and additional guns. A 10-inch mortar was kept outside the fort to keep it from shaking the dirt off the walls when it was fired.

The fort was attacked seven times by ships over the next two years. The fort withstood all of these attacks with only minimal damage and few casualties. There were four naval attacks in 1862. Union ironclad monitors began to attack the fort on January 27, 1863, starting with the &quot;Montauk&quot; and later with the &quot;Passaic&quot;, &quot;Nahant&quot;, and &quot;Patapsco&quot;. The &quot;Montauk&quot; had an 11-inch and a 15-inch cannon, the largest size used in the war. The ironclad bombarded the fort for 5 hours but caused no casualties and little damage because the earth absorbed the artillery shells and the damage was easily repaired. Similarly, the fort&#x27;s cannons hit the ironclad 15 times but caused no significant damage. The &quot;Montauk&quot; made another unsuccessful attack on February 1, except that fort commander Maj. John B. Gallie was killed. A 7-hour bombardment on March 3 also failed to damage the fort.

The fort was the site of the sinking of the CSS Nashville on February 28, 1863.

On December 13, 1864, Gen. William T. Sherman reached the fort on his March to the Sea. Gen. William B. Hazen&#x27;s infantry division attacked the fort, defended by Maj. George Wayne Anderson and some 230 troops. The Union force overpowered the fort&#x27;s defenders in about 15 minutes of battle. Fort McAllister was the last fort defending Savannah. After it fell, Gen. William J. Hardee withdrew his 10,000 troops that were defending Savannah and Sherman captured the city without resistance. Sherman&#x27;s army abandoned the fort and burned its bunkers.

During the evening that the fort fell, Anderson was being held at the McAllister family home, the new headquarters of General William Babcock Hazen. General Hazen and Lt. Col. Strong invited General Sherman to dinner, to celebrate their victory. In a kind gesture of respect, General Hazen also invited Major Anderson to attend the meal, after clearing the request with Sherman. The discussion was surely lively - during the meal Anderson engaged in a heated exchange with General Sherman about the tactics employed to defend the fort and the bravery of all who fought there. Cigars were exchanged and smoked, and tributes were made to the fallen. However, Sherman remained greatly upset at Anderson&#x27;s use of land mines in the defense of the fort, and ordered the Major to personally join his fellow captured Confederates on mine-clearing detail.

==After the war==
In the late 1930s, Henry Ford bought the property and began restoring it. The International Paper Company purchased the property from Ford&#x27;s estate and gave it to the State of Georgia in 1958. The Georgia Historical Commission continued to restore the fort to its 1863-64 appearance. The museum displays many artifacts. The fort was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. The fort site was combined with the adjacent Richmond Hill State Park to create the Fort McAllister State Historic Park.

<doc id="1212916" wikidata="Q5587922" url="?curid=1212916" title="Gotland Regiment">
<text>The Gotland Regiment (, P 18) is a Swedish Army armoured regiment which has been active in various forms between 1963–1994 and 2000–2005, when it was disbanded. The regiment was re-established on 1 January 2018. The regiment is based in Visby as part of the Gotland Garrison.

==History==
In the Defence Act of 1958, the decided that eight armoured brigades with new combat vehicles would be organized in the army. The decision was changed for economic reasons in August 1960 to include only seven armoured brigades. Four infantry regiments, the North Scanian Infantry Regiment (I 6), South Scanian Infantry Regiment (I 7), Södermanland Regiment (I 10) and Gotland Infantry Regiment (I 18), were transferred from the infantry to the armoured forces. There was a detachment of the Göta Armoured Life Guards (P 1) on Gotland since 1944, the Göta Armoured Life Guards&#x27; Company in Gotland (P 1 G). The detachment was amalgamated on 1 April 1963 with the new Gotland Regiment, forming the backbone of the new armoured regiment. The Gotland Regiment was also given the new designation P 18 instead of its previous designation I 18 as an infantry regiment.

After I 18 was amalgamated with P 1 G to P 18 in 1963, the armored brigade thus became reorganized into five large battalions with KP-bil (instead of bicycles) with each two companies of either tank destroyers or Stridsvagn 74. During the 1970s, the brigade was re-armored with Stridsvagn 102, which, like the KP-bil, underwent a renovation in the 1980s.

As part of the so-called OLLI reform, which was carried out by the Swedish Armed Forces in 1973 and in 1975, A units and B units were created. The A units were regiments responsible for a defence district and the B units were training regiments. In Gotland&#x27;s case, the VII Military District was reorganized into Gotland Military Command (MKG) in 1966. The military command was a special command and control organization within the Eastern Military District, but did not have the overall responsibility for the administration of the island. The Gotland Regiment, which was included in the Gotland Military Command (MKG), was a B unit (training regiment) from 1 July 1974.

Prior to the Defence Act of 1977, the Swedish Armed Forces Peace Organization Investigation (, FFU) proposed to the that the Gotland Regiment (P 18), Gotland Artillery Regiment (A 7) and Gotland Anti-Aircraft Battalion (Lv 2) would be merged into one army regiment. However, the Committee on Defence and the Minister for Defence felt that no decision would be taken before the issue of further land acquisition in connection to Visborgs slätt had been resolved. In the autumn of 1980, the issue was considered sufficiently resolved when the decided on 16 October 1980 to merge the army units into an army regiment. From 1 July 1982 the regiment was subordinate to the commanding officer of the Gotland Military Command (MKG). After the Defence Act of 1992, the Gotland Military Command received a new role. The command came only to lead all operations on Gotland, which on the mainland were settled by the defence district staffs, division staffs and naval command staffs. The army units, which since 1982 had been subordinate to the command, came to form independent units. However, the Gotland Regiment was merged with the war unit Gotland Brigade and formed the Gotland Regiment and Gotland Brigade (MekB 18). Prior to the Defence Act of 2000, the government proposed to the that only six units for training of army brigade commands and mechanized battalions would be the starting point for the future of the Swedish Armed Forces. When it came to Gotland, the government considered that operational requirements made it necessary to have a military presence on the island. Primarily because of cost and maintenance reasons, the government considered that no tank training would be carried out on Gotland. The Swedish Armed Forces&#x27; new peacetime organization did not come to reflect the war organization in the same way as before, which meant that Gotland Regiment and Gotland Brigade was decommissioned on 30 June 2000, and in its place the Gotland Regiment (P 18) was re-formed on 1 July 2000.

In the Defence Act of 2004, the decided on disbanding the Gotland Regiment (P 18). Prior to the Defence Act, the regiment was put up against the Jämtland Ranger Regiment (I 5), South Scanian Regiment (P 7) and Södermanland Regiment (P 10), where the government was keen to create rational production conditions, and a sustainable organizational structure. The new organization would respond to the requirements of the new structure of operational units and the development and training resources. Each regiment trained mechanized units, and had good production conditions and good engineering resources. The government wanted the Swedish Armed Forces to be developed into an operational defense, with a greater emphasis on internationalization, which came to mean that the government proposed disbanding the Gotland Regiment. Of the other three regiments, only the South Scanian Regiment remained, the other two also being disbanded. The government considered the South Scanian Regiment had the best geographic location, with proximity to the training area, which was central to the Swedish Armed Forces. The government also regarded it as important to have military units with emphasis on ground warfare in southern Sweden, with short distances to both the Øresund Bridge and Barsebäck Nuclear Power Plant. The Gotland Regiment was disbanded on 31 December 2004. From 1 January 2005, the regiment changed name to the Decommissioning Organization P 18 (), which would account for the disbandment of the regiment, which would be completed on 31 August 2006. On 28 May 2005 the official disbandment of the regiment took place. In September 2017, the Minister for Defense presented the proposal that the regiment would be re-formed on 1 January 2018. The confirmed the decision on 13 December 2017. On 22 May 2018, the regiment was officially consecrated by King Carl XVI Gustaf, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven and General Micael Bydén. The regiment is expected to be staffed by 30 men and women by the end of 2018 and will reach its full strength of 350 by 2020.

==Units==

===Gotland Brigade===
The Gotland Infantry Regiment came through the Defence Act of 1942 to organize a field regiment that was reorganized into an infantry brigade through the Defence Act of 1948. Together with Värmland Regiment (I 2) and Norrbotten Regiment (I 19), the regiment was one of the three infantry regiments that did not raise a so-called &quot;dubbleringsregemente&quot;, or field regiment. Through the Defence Act of 1948 brigades were introduced throughout the army, which resulted in the army being streamlined into two brigade types, infantry brigades and armored brigades, where Gotland Infantry Regiment was responsible for the Gotland Brigade (IB 18). The Gotland Brigade (IB 18) was raised in 1949 when the field regiment Gotland Infantry Regiment (I 18) was reorganized into a brigade and became the regiment&#x27;s only brigade. In connection with the formation of Gotland Regiment in 1963 through the amalgamation of Gotland Infantry Regiment (I 18) and Göta Armoured Life Guards&#x27; Company in Gotland (P 1 G), the brigade was reorganized into an armored brigade and its designation was changed to PB 18. In 1994, Gotland Regiment was amalgamated into the Gotland Brigade (PB 18). In connection with this, the brigade was reorganized into a mechanized brigade, and made a name and designation change to Gotland Regiment and Gotland Brigade (MekB 18). With this reorganization, the brigade became a cadre-organized war unit within the Central Military District (Milo M). In connection with the Defence Act of 2000, the brigade was disbanded on 30 June 2000 and the regiment was re-established on 1 July 2000 under its former name, Gotland Regiment (P 18).

===Companies===
==Locations and training areas==

===Barracks===
On 30 August 1905, the regiment moved into a newly built barracks establishment at Visborgs slätt, which the regiment had as its military camp since 1887. The barracks establishment was built as part of the 1901 Army Order&#x27;s building program according to the type drawings for infantry establishments. In total, just over a hundred buildings were built in the area. The area has a number of times been expanded with garage and storage buildings and barracks. The Gotland Anti-Aircraft Corps and the Gotland Artillery Regiment were co-located with the Gotland Regiment, in 1978 and 1986 respectively. The staff of the Gotland Military Command and Gotland Military District have also been based in the barracks. After the regiment was disbanded, the Swedish Fortifications Agency sold the entire barracks area for about 40 million Swedish krona.

===Training areas===
The regiment&#x27;s primary training areas were in Visby, Stånga malm, Blekväten, Vallstena, Hällarna and Tofta firing range.

==Heraldry and traditions==

===Colours, standards and guidons===
When the regiment was reorganized into an armoured regiment in 1963, the regiment carried colours presented to the regiment on 13 June 1954 by the Chief of the Army Carl August Ehrensvärd. The regiment also for some time carried the colours of the Göta Armoured Life Guards&#x27; Company in Gotland (P 1 G) alongside their own colours. A new colour was presented to regiment at the Oscar Memorial Stone () in Visby by His Majesty the King Carl XVI Gustaf on 12 October 2002. The colour was drawn by Kristina Åkerberg and embroidered by machine and hand in insertion technique by Maj-Britt Salander. Blazon: &quot;On blue cloth the provincial badge of Gotland; a white ram passant, arms and crosstaff yellow and a red banner with edging and five flaps in yellow.&quot;

<text>Káťa Kabanová (also known in various spellings including &quot;Katia&quot;, &quot;Katja&quot;, &quot;Katya&quot;, and &quot;Kabanowa&quot;) is an opera in three acts, with music by Leoš Janáček to a libretto by the composer based on &quot;The Storm&quot;, a play by Alexander Ostrovsky, translated by . The opera was also largely inspired by Janáček&#x27;s love for Kamila Stösslová. Although he was 67 when it was premiered, &quot;Káťa Kabanová&quot; is a clear response to Janáček&#x27;s feelings for Kamila, and the work is dedicated to her. The first performance was at the National Theatre Brno on 23 November 1921.

The opera has had a complex publication history. František Neumann, the conductor of the opera&#x27;s first performance, made changes that were incorporated into the first publication of the score in 1922 by Universal Edition. Conductor Václav Talich later produced a &quot;re-orchestrated&quot; version of the score. In 1992, Sir Charles Mackerras published a critical edition of the opera.

==Roles==
&quot;Note&quot;: The name of the opera and the main character is usually transliterated in English as &quot;Káta&quot;, &quot;Kata&quot; or &quot;Katya&quot; because of the Czech diacritics.
==Synopsis==
:Place: The Russian town of Kalinov on the shores of the Volga River
:Time: The 1860s

===Act 1===
Váňa Kudrjáš admires the view of the Volga River, which amuses the more literal-minded housekeeper of the adjoining Kabanov estate. Two men approach, Dikoj and his nephew, Boris Grigorjevič, where Dikoj is berating Boris. Dikoj learns that Kabanicha, the Kabanov family matriarch, is not at home. Dikoj leaves, and Boris explains to Váňa Kudrjáš why he tolerates the abuse: his parents are dead, and to be able to collect his inheritance, he must respect his uncle no matter what his uncle says to him. Boris also tells Váňa Kudrjáš that he is secretly in love with Káťa, the young wife of Tichon. Káťa appears and Kabanicha reproaches her son Tichon – Kaťa&#x27;s husband – for his inattentiveness. Tichon and Káťa try to calm her down, but Kabanicha will have none of it, telling Tichon that he spoils Káťa. Tichon complains to Varvara, the family&#x27;s foster daughter, who rebukes him for retreating into drinking more than defending Káťa.

In the house, Káťa tells Varvara of her happy childhood, and dreams of having a man who truly loves her. Tichon enters to say good-bye, as he is journeying to Kazan on business, for Kabanicha. Káťa asks to accompany him or for him not to go, but he insists. Káťa then asks him to make her swear an oath to speak to no strangers during his absence, which puzzles Tichon. Kabanicha announces that Tichon must go, but not before instructing Káťa how to behave in his absence. Tichon dutifully says that Káťa must treat Kabanicha like her own mother and always act properly. He bows to Kabanicha and kisses her and Kát&#x27;a before he departs.

===Act 2===
The women are working on embroidery. Kabanicha criticizes Káťa for not appearing more sorrowful at Tichon&#x27;s absence. After Kabanicha leaves, Varvara shows Káťa the key to the far part of the garden. Varvara intends to meet Váňa, her lover, there. She hints at the same suggestion for Káťa, and puts the key in her hand. Káťa is hesitant, but then surrenders to fate and will meet Boris. She steps outside as evening comes on. Kabanicha reappears with Dikoj, who is drunk and complaining that people take advantage of his softhearted nature. However, Kabanicha chastises him.

Váňa Kudrjás is waiting for Varvara in the garden. Boris then unexpectedly appears, after receiving a message to go there. Varvara arrives, and she and Váňa go for a walk by the river. Káťa then appears, and Boris declares his love for her. She is at first worried about social ruin, but finally she reciprocates, confessing her secret feelings for him. They embrace and they too leave for a walk. Váňa and Varvara return, as she explains her precautions should Kabanicha suddenly appear. Káťa and Boris are heard in wordless, ecstatic duet as Váňa and Varvara say that it is time to return home.

===Act 3===
:Ten days later
Váňa Kudrjáš and Kuligin are strolling near the river when an approaching storm causes them to take shelter in a ruined building. Other people join them, including Dikoj. Váňa tries to calm Dikoj with scientific explanations about a new invention, the lightning rod. However, this only angers Dikoj, who insists that lightning is not caused by electricity but is the punishment from God. The rain dies down, and people start to leave the shelter. Vána meets Boris and Varvara. Varvara says that Tichon has returned, and Káťa is very agitated. Kabanicha arrives with Tichon and Káťa. The storm returns, and people assume initially that this is what upsets Káťa. However, she confesses to Tichon in front of everyone her assignation with Boris during her husband&#x27;s absence. Then she runs out into the storm.

Evening approaches after the storm has ended. Tichon and a search party are looking for Káťa. At first among the party, Varvara and Váňa then decide to leave the village for Moscow and start a new life. They leave, and as the searchers continue, Káťa appears. She knows that her confession has dishonoured her and humiliated Boris. She feels tormented and wants to meet Boris one more time. Boris appears and sees her, and the two embrace. Boris says that his uncle is sending him away to another town, but asks her what will become of her. As her sanity deteriorates, she first begs him to be allowed to accompany him, then insists that she could not and bids him farewell; he leaves in sorrow. After thinking of how nature will continue to flourish over her grave, Káťa throws herself into the river. Kuligin sees this from the far bank and calls for help. Tichon appears, followed by Kabanicha. Tichon tries to help Káťa but is restrained by Kabanicha; he blames her for Káťa&#x27;s suicide. Dikoj appears with Káťa&#x27;s body and lays her on the ground. Tichon cries over the body as, without any emotion, Kabanicha thanks the bystanders—or, as often done, the audience—for their help.

<text>Bill Dare is an English author and creator/producer of radio and television comedy programmes.

==Biography==
Born in 1959 or 1960, Dare attended Manchester University. Dare is an author and producer/devisor of various (mainly comedy) programmes mainly for BBC Radio and television, including &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience&quot;, &quot;Dead Ringers&quot;, &quot;The Now Show&quot;, &quot;The Late Edition&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Seen Star Wars&quot; and &quot;The Secret World&quot;, and &quot;Brian Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. He was also the producer of eight series of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Spitting Image&quot;. A feature of the radio version of &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; was Jon Culshaw, in the style of Tom Baker saying Dare&#x27;s name in an exaggerated fashion at the end of the credits.

He wrote and appeared in his own Radio 4 sketch show, &quot;Life, Death and Sex with Mike and Sue&quot; which ran for five series. More recently he has emerged as a more serious writer. Dare&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Natural Selection&quot; is published in the UK and US, and his first stage play, &quot;Touch&quot;, was performed at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2007. His second play, &quot;Misconception&quot; was also performed at Edinburgh.

His radio series, &quot;Brian Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; is now a novel, published by Pilrig Press 2013. His third novel, &quot;The Billion Pound Lie&quot;, is about a man who is mistaken for a lottery winner and was described as &#x27;a funny, touching novel about friendship, love and lottery tickets&#x27; by Erin Kelly.

Dare&#x27;s shows have won several awards including three Radio Academy Gold awards for best comedy.

Dare wrote his first song at the age of 58 and released his first single aged 61.

<text>David Stephen Mitchell (born 12 January 1969) is an English novelist, television writer, and screenwriter.

He has written nine novels, two of which, &quot;number9dream&quot; (2001) and &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; (2004), were shortlisted for the Booker Prize. He has also written articles for several newspapers, most notably for &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He has translated books about autism from Japanese to English.

==Early life==
Mitchell was born in Southport in Lancashire (now Merseyside), England, and raised in Malvern, Worcestershire. He was educated at Hanley Castle High School. At the University of Kent, he earned a degree in English and American Literature, followed by an M.A. in Comparative Literature.

Mitchell lived in Sicily for a year. He moved to Hiroshima, Japan, where he taught English to technical students for eight years, before returning to England. There he could live on his earnings as a writer and support his pregnant wife.

==Work==
Mitchell&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Ghostwritten&quot; (1999), takes place in locations ranging from Okinawa to Mongolia to pre-millennial New York City, as nine narrators tell stories that interlock and intersect. It won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize (for best work of British literature written by an author under 35) and was shortlisted for the Guardian First Book Award. His two subsequent novels, &quot;number9dream&quot; (2001) and &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; (2004), were both favourably received and shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize. 

In 2003, he was selected as one of Granta&#x27;s Best of Young British Novelists. In 2007, Mitchell was listed among &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Most Influential People in The World.

In 2012, his metafictional novel &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; (again, with multiple narrators), was adapted as a feature film of the same name. 

One segment of &quot;number9dream&quot; was adapted as a short film titled &quot;The Voorman Problem&quot; and starring Martin Freeman. It was nominated for a BAFTA in 2013. 

In addition to novels, Mitchell has written opera libretti in recent years. &quot;Wake&quot;, with music by Klaas de Vries, was based on the 2000 Enschede fireworks disaster. It was performed by the Dutch Nationale Reisopera in 2010. He created the opera, &quot;Sunken Garden&quot;, with Dutch composer Michel van der Aa; it was premiered in 2013 by the English National Opera.

Several of Mitchell&#x27;s book covers were created by design duo Kai and Sunny. Mitchell has also collaborated with the duo, by contributing two short stories to their art exhibits in 2011 and 2014.

Mitchell&#x27;s sixth novel, &quot;The Bone Clocks&quot;, was published in 2014. In an interview in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Mitchell said that the novel has &quot;dollops of the fantastic in it&quot;, and is about &quot;stuff between life and death&quot;. &quot;The Bone Clocks&quot; was longlisted for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.

Mitchell was the second author to contribute to the Future Library project. He delivered his book &quot;From Me Flows What You Call Time&quot; on 28 May 2016.

&quot;Utopia Avenue&quot;, Mitchell&#x27;s ninth novel, was published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in 2020, during the first year of the Covid 19 pandemic. &quot;Utopia Avenue&quot; tells the &quot;unexpurgated story&quot; of a British band of the same name, who emerged from London&#x27;s psychedelic scene in 1967 and was &quot;fronted by folk singer Elf Holloway, guitar demigod Jasper de Zoet and blues bassist Dean Moss&quot;.

Mitchell&#x27;s entire body of fictional works feature multiple recurring characters and themes that together form an interconnected fictional world, which Mitchell refers to as his &#x27;macronovel&#x27;.

==Other works==
Following the release of the 2012 film adaptation of &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot;, Mitchell began work as a screenwriter with Lana Wachowski (one of &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot;″ three directors). 
In 2015, Mitchell contributed plotting and scripted scenes for the second season of the Netflix series &quot;Sense8&quot; by the Wachowskis. They had adapted the novel for a TV series, and together with Aleksandar Hemon, they wrote the series finale. Mitchell had signed a contract to write season three of the series, but Netflix cancelled the show.

In August 2019, it was announced that Mitchell would continue his collaboration with Lana Wachowski and Hemon to write the screenplay for &quot;The Matrix Resurrections&quot;.

==Personal life==
After another stint in Japan, Mitchell and his wife, Keiko Yoshida, live in Ardfield, County Cork, Ireland, . They have two children. In an essay for Random House, Mitchell wrote: 
Mitchell has a stammer. He believes that the film &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; (2010) is one of the most accurate portrayals of that experience for an individual. He said, &quot;I&#x27;d probably still be avoiding the subject today had I not outed myself by writing a semi-autobiographical novel, &quot;Black Swan Green&quot;, narrated by a stammering 13-year-old.&quot; Mitchell is a patron of the British Stammering Association.

Mitchell&#x27;s son is autistic. In 2013, Mitchell and his wife Yoshida translated a book into English that was written by Naoki Higashida, a 13-year-old Japanese autistic boy, titled &quot;The Reason I Jump: One Boy&#x27;s Voice from the Silence of Autism&quot;. Higashida is said to have learned to communicate using the discredited pseudoscientific techniques of facilitated communication and rapid prompting method.

In 2017, Mitchell and his wife translated a second book attributed to Higashida, &quot;Fall Down 7 Times Get Up 8: A Young Man&#x27;s Voice from the Silence of Autism&quot;.

<doc id="1212925" wikidata="Q777975" url="?curid=1212925" title="J. Lindsay Almond">
<text>James Lindsay Almond Jr. (June 15, 1898 – April 14, 1986) was an American lawyer, state and federal judge and Democratic party politician. His political offices included as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Virginia&#x27;s 6th congressional district (1946–1948), 26th Attorney General of Virginia (1948–1957) and the 58th Governor of Virginia (1958–1962). As a member of the Byrd Organization, Almond initially supported massive resistance to the integration of public schools following the United States Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education, but when Virginia and federal courts ruled segregation unconstitutional, Almond worked with the legislature to end massive resistance.

Almond then became an associate judge of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (1962–1973), and after retiring, continued to serve as Senior Judge of the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals (1973–1982) and then Senior Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit from 1982, until his death in 1986.

==Early life==

Almond was born in Charlottesville, Virginia and raised in Orange County, Virginia. Almond attended Virginia Tech and served as a private in the Students Army Training Corps in 1917 and 1918 in World War I. Afterwards he taught school in Locust Grove, in his native Orange County, then became a high school principal, while also studying and earned a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1923.

==Lawyer and state judge==

Almond prosecuted criminals as assistant commonwealth attorney of Roanoke, Virginia from 1930 to 1933.

During the Great Depression, Virginia legislators elected him as a state court judge, and he served in the Hustings Court of Roanoke from 1933 to 1945. The Hustings Court handled family law matters as well as some misdemeanor offenses. In possibly his most famous case, discussed at length in the book Truevine, Judge Almond appointed what would today be called a guardian or conservator for two albino African-American men who had been abducted as children from their family&#x27;s farm near Roanoke, and who toured as a sideshow attraction with the Ringling Brothers Circus for several years while only an unrelated White man received wages for them. Their mother recognized them in a photograph taken in Lincoln, Nebraska in 1936 and with the help of a local Virginia lawyer, secured both their release from the circus and damages, which unfortunately were mostly spent by their mother&#x27;s second husband (who was shot during an adulterous affair). Later, they wished to return to the circus rather than stay unemployed at home, so at their and their lawyer&#x27;s request, Judge Almond arranged for part of their salaries to be saved to support their retirement (four years before adoption of the Social Security Act), as well as to support their again-widowed mother, and enforced a similar arrangement when their manager took them touring with other circuses.

==Political career==
As World War II ended, Almond ran for Congress from Virginia&#x27;s 6th congressional district. Elected to the United States House of Representatives, he served in the 79th and 80th Congresses.

Almond resigned his Congressional seat in 1948, when he was elected Attorney General of Virginia. He argued the state&#x27;s case for segregation of public schools before the United States Supreme Court in the case of &quot;Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County&quot;, which was consolidated with &quot;Brown v. Board of Education.&quot; Virginia lost both in 1954 and 1955.

Although not a favorite of United States Senator Harry F. Byrd, Almond had demonstrated loyalty to the Byrd Organization as well as the national ticket and racial segregation. Byrd had been offended by Almond&#x27;s endorsement of Martin Hutchinson for the Federal Trade Commission and had refused to endorse Almond for governor in 1953 so Thomas B. Stanley was nominated and ultimately elected. By 1956, Byrd had announced the organization&#x27;s policy of massive resistance, and as attorney-general, Almond had defended what became known as the Stanley Plan despite doubts about its constitutionality. In 1957, Almond resigned as attorney general (and Stanley appointed Kenneth Cartwright Patty to fill the rest of the term) and announced early for the Democratic nomination for governor. Almond refused Byrd&#x27;s offer of a position on the Virginia Supreme Court conditioned upon his endorsing Byrd&#x27;s preferred nominee, Garland Gray, firmly segregationist in allegiance.

Gray then withdrew from the Democratic primary, and Almond easily won the Democratic nomination for Governor of Virginia. His Republican opponent, Theodore Roosevelt Dalton, would have allowed racial integration of the public schools pursuant to court orders. Almond offered segregationist rhetoric in most locations and won election as Virginia&#x27;s governor a month after President Dwight Eisenhower sent troops to enforce a desegregation order in Little Rock, Arkansas, over the opposition of its governor, Orval Faubus.

Almond took office in January 1958 for a volatile term that ended in 1962. On January 19, 1959, the Virginia Supreme Court and a three judge federal panel both found the Stanley Plan unconstitutional. Almond initially protested denouncing the federal court rulings in a fiery speech blasting &quot;those whose purpose and design is to blend and amalgamate of the white and negro races&quot; and citing &quot;the livid stench of sadism, sex immorality, and juvenile pregnancy infesting the mixed schools of the District of Columbia and elsewhere,&quot; but he soon called a special legislative session and announced (to the fury of Byrd, James J. Kilpatrick, and others) that he would not resist the federal court orders.

He allowed public schools in Arlington and Norfolk to desegregate peacefully by to court orders on February 5, 1959. Heeding the advice of several moderates within his own party, including Senator Mosby Perrow Jr., Almond realized that opposition to desegregation was ultimately futile, as the state continued to lose in the courts. In April 1959, Almond and his lieutenant governor, Allie Edward Stakes Stephens, helped Perrow and Stuart B. Carter of Fincastle, Virginia narrowly secure passage of bills which allowed localities to determine whether to desegregate their schools.

Schools in Albemarle and Warren Counties opened and followed desegregation orders, but the schools in Prince Edward County remained closed until 1963, and the tuition assistance program that supported segregation academies remained in effect until 1968 when the United States Supreme Court decided &quot;Green v. County School Board of New Kent County&quot;. Thus, except for Prince Edward County, massive resistance had been transformed into passive resistance against school desegregation.

However, Harry F. Byrd Jr. and longtime Byrd lieutenant E. Blackburn Moore defeated Almond&#x27;s request for a sales tax in 1960, which some saw as retaliation for allowing school desegregation. Stephens resigned just before the end of the year to run for governor (following Almond&#x27;s early declaration example). However, the Byrd Organization slated Albertis Harrison (the attorney general who had supported segregation and litigation against the NAACP) as their candidate. Stephens lost badly in the 1961 Democratic primary (which ended his elected career), and Byrd loyalist Mills Godwin defeated moderate Armistead Boothe for lieutenant governor, but the machine&#x27;s vote totals were lower than previously. Both Harrison and Godwin won election in November, with Robert Young Button being elected attorney general.

==Federal judicial service==
After campaigning for President John F. Kennedy in 1960, President Kennedy nominated Almond to the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals on April 16, 1962. However Senator Byrd blocked a Senate floor vote and the nomination expired without action. Almond received a recess appointment from President Kennedy on October 23, 1962, to an Associate Judge seat on the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals vacated by Associate Judge Ambrose O&#x27;Connell. He was nominated to the same position by President Kennedy on January 15, 1963. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 28, 1963, 164 days after his nomination (more than a year after the first nomination, which Byrd had said he would not block) when Senator Byrd, who was still blocking his nomination, missed a floor session. Byrd&#x27;s vindictiveness toward Almond eventually undermined the Byrd Organization. Almond received his commission on July 3, 1963. He assumed senior status on March 1, 1973. He was reassigned by operation of law to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on October 1, 1982, pursuant to 96 Stat. 25. His service terminated on April 14, 1986, due to his death.

===Elections===
*1946; Almond was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in a special election unopposed. He was re-elected in the general election with 64.78% of the vote, defeating Republican Frank R. Angell and Socialist Ruby Mae Wilkes.
*1957; Almond was elected Governor of Virginia with 63.15% of the vote, defeating Republican Theodore R. Dalton and Independent C. Gilmer Brooks.

==Personal life==
Almond married Josephine Katherine Minter in 1925. He was a Lutheran and taught a men&#x27;s bible class. He was a 32nd degree Mason, a Shriner, and a member of Alpha Kappa Psi and Omicron Delta Kappa.

==Death==

Almond died on April 14, 1986, in Richmond, Virginia. He and his wife Josephine Minter Almond are buried in Evergreen Burial Park in Roanoke, Virginia, in her family&#x27;s plot. The couple had no children, but had raised one of her nephews as their son.

<text>The New Mexico campaign was a military operation of the trans-Mississippi theater of the American Civil War from February to April 1862 in which Confederate Brigadier General Henry Hopkins Sibley invaded the northern New Mexico Territory in an attempt to gain control of the Southwest, including the gold fields of Colorado and the ports of California. Historians regard this campaign as the most ambitious Confederate attempt to establish control of the American West and to open an additional theater in the war. It was an important campaign in the war&#x27;s Trans-Mississippi Theater, and one of the major events in the history of the New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War.

The Confederates advanced north along the Rio Grande from Fort Bliss in Texas. They won the Battle of Valverde but failed to capture Fort Craig or force the surrender of the main Union Army in the territory. They continued north across the border towards Santa Fe and Fort Union, leaving that Union force in their rear. At Glorieta Pass, the Confederates defeated another Union force from Fort Union, but were forced to retreat following the destruction of the wagon train containing most of their supplies.

Confederate success in this failed campaign would have denied the Union a major source of the gold and silver necessary to finance its war effort, and the Union navy would have had the additional difficulty of attempting to blockade several hundred miles of coastline in the Pacific. A Confederate victory would have also diverted Union troops which, following the invasion, were used to fight Native American tribes on the plains and in the Rockies.

==Opposing forces==

===Union===
Union forces in the Department of New Mexico were led by Colonel Edward Canby, who headquartered at Fort Craig. Under his immediate command at the fort were five regiments of New Mexico volunteer infantry, a company of the 2nd Colorado Infantry, two provisional artillery units, eleven companies of the 5th, 7th, and 10th U.S. Infantry, six companies of the 2nd and 3rd U.S. Cavalry, and two regiments New Mexico militia. At Fort Union, under the command of Colonel Gabriel Paul, were the 1st Colorado Infantry, a company of the 2nd Colorado Infantry, a battalion of the 5th U.S. Infantry Regiment, a detachment from the 1st and 3rd U.S. Cavalry, a company of the 4th New Mexico Infantry, and two provisional artillery batteries.

===Confederate===
The Confederate Army of New Mexico was led by Brigadier General Henry Hopkins Sibley. His units included the 4th Texas Mounted Rifles and 5th Texas Mounted Rifles (both of which had batteries of mountain howitzers), five companies of the 7th Texas Mounted Rifles, six companies of the 2nd Texas Mounted Rifles with an attached artillery battery, and several companies of Arizona Confederate mounted volunteers. Following his arrival in New Mexico in January, Sibley organized his artillery into a battalion under the command of Captain Trevanion Teel, whom he promoted to major. Five additional companies of the 7th Texas arrived near the end of February and served as the garrison of Fort Thorn at Mesilla.

==Confederate strategy==
For years, residents in the southern part of the New Mexico Territory had been complaining that the territorial government in Santa Fe was too far away to properly address their concerns. The withdrawal of the Regular army at the beginning of the war confirmed to the residents that they were being abandoned. Secession conventions in Mesilla and Tucson voted to join the territory to the Confederacy in March 1861, and formed militia companies to defend themselves. In July 1861, Lieutenant Colonel John Baylor led a battalion of Texas mounted rifles into the southern portion of the New Mexico Territory, entering Mesilla and repulsing the attack of the Union garrison of Fort Fillmore at the First Battle of Mesilla. The victorious Baylor established the Confederate Territory of Arizona south of the 34th parallel.

The 1862 campaign was a continuation of this strategy formulated by Sibley in a plan presented to Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Sibley&#x27;s strategy called for an invasion along the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, seizing the Colorado Territory (then at the height of the Colorado Gold Rush) and Fort Laramie (the most important United States Army garrison along the Oregon Trail), before turning westward to attack the mineral-rich Nevada and California. He planned to take minimal supplies along with him, intending to live off the land and to capture the stockpiles of supplies at Union forts and depots along the Santa Fe Trail. Once these territories had been secured, Sibley intended to take the northern Mexican states of Chihuahua, Sonora, and Lower California, either through purchase or by invasion.

==March toward Santa Fe==

===Sibley&#x27;s advance===
On December 20, 1861, General Sibley, in command of the Army of New Mexico, issued a proclamation taking possession of New Mexico in the name of the Confederate States. He called on the citizens to abandon their allegiance to the Union and to join the Confederacy, warning that those &quot;who co-operate with the enemy will be treated accordingly, and must be prepared to share their fate.&quot; In February 1862, Sibley advanced northward from Fort Thorn up the valley of the Rio Grande, toward the territorial capital of Santa Fe and the Union storehouses at Fort Union. Along the way, Sibley detached 54 men to occupy Tucson. The Confederate advance followed the west bank of the river via Fort Craig, which was garrisoned by a 3,800-man Union force under Canby. Knowing he could not leave such a large Union force behind him as he advanced, Sibley attempted to lure the Union forces out into battle on favorable terms.

On February 19, Sibley camped at the sandhills east of the fort with the intention of cutting the Union lines of communications with Santa Fe. On February 20, the Union forces advanced from the fort but were hit with heavy Confederate artillery and were forced to retreat. The next day the Confederates marched to Valverde Ford, north of the fort, in an attempt to outflank the Union forces. Canby attacked, but the Union forces were driven back by the Confederates under Colonel Thomas Green, who took command after Sibley was indisposed (and possibly drunk). Canby&#x27;s forces retreated to Fort Craig but refused to surrender.

Since he had only enough rations for three days, Sibley could not attempt a siege nor retreat back to Mesilla. Instead, he chose to disengage from the fort and continued slowly northward towards Santa Fe, on the other side of the border in New Mexico Territory, hoping to reach the supplies located there and also to cut Fort Craig&#x27;s lines of supplies and communications. Due to the loss of horses at Valverde, the 4th Texas had to be dismounted, with the remaining horses, already in a weakened state, distributed among the other units. They also had lost much of their transportation in the battle at Valverde, causing them to carry the wounded. All this caused the column to travel slower than it could have. Canby meanwhile attempted to trap Sibley&#x27;s army between his own force and Fort Union. He disbanded his militia and most of the volunteer units, and sent most of his mounted units northward to act as partisans and to &quot;obstruct [Sibley&#x27;s] movements if he should advance, and cut off his supplies, by removing from his route the cattle, grain, and other supplies in private hands that would aid him in sustaining his force.&quot;

Starting on February 23, the Confederate forces reached Albuquerque on March 2 and Santa Fe on March 13, but due to their slow advance they failed to capture most of the Union supplies located at these cities. The slow advance also allowed reinforcements from Colorado under the command of Colonel John Slough to reach Fort Union, until this time under Paul&#x27;s command. Since he had been commissioned colonel before Paul was commissioned the same rank, Slough claimed seniority and took command of the fort. Canby had already ordered Paul to &quot;not move from Fort Union to meet me until I advise you of the route and point of junction.&quot; After learning of the change in command, Canby told Slough to &quot;advise me of your plans and movements, that I may cooperate.&quot; He also instructed Slough to &quot;harass the enemy by partisan operations. Obstruct his movements and cut off his supplies.&quot; Slough interpreted this as an authorization to advance, which he did with men from the fort&#x27;s garrison.

The Union and Confederate forces met at the Battle of Glorieta Pass on March 28. The Confederates were able to push the Union force through the pass, but had to retreat following the destruction of their wagon train, which contained nearly all of their supplies and ammunition. Sibley pulled his army back to Albuquerque to await reinforcements from Texas. Slough, receiving orders from Canby to return immediately to Fort Union, also retreated, fearing a court martial if he disobeyed this order. Once he arrived at the fort, he resigned his commission and returned to Colorado, leaving Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Tappan in command of the regiment and Paul once again in command of the fort.

===Sibley&#x27;s retreat===
Canby initially ordered the Union force to retreat back to Fort Union, but after discovering the weakness of the Confederates he ordered a concentration of Union forces; small garrisons were left at Forts Craig and Union, and the main forces were to rendezvous near Albuquerque. With limited supplies and ammunition and outnumbered, Sibley chose to retreat to Texas, leaving Albuquerque on April 12 after a small fight a few days earlier. On April 14, Canby encountered the Confederates at Peralta, where the armies skirmished until 2:00 p.m. when a sandstorm permitted the Confederates to withdraw to the west bank.

Cut off from retreat down the east bank by Union forces, Sibley&#x27;s army was forced to retreat down the west bank or through the mountains to the west in search of food and water, during which hundreds of Confederates straggled and fell behind. During the retreat, looting, destruction and confiscation of food, and forage by the desperate Confederate soldiers drove New Mexican citizens to resistance along the line of march down the west bank of the Rio Grande. After reaching Mesilla the retreat continued to Franklin (El Paso) and then to San Antonio. At Socorro, New Mexico a small confederate unit of four men under a Lt. Simmons was captured by Union Scout Captain &quot;Paddy&quot; Grayson and one man. (OF the five men 1 confederate was killed trying to escape).

A rearguard of four companies of the 7th Texas Mounted Rifles and several companies of Arizona Confederates (consolidated under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Philemon Herbert as the 1st Arizona Mounted Rifles Battalion) was left at Fort Thorn, commanded by Colonel William Steele.

With the advance of the California Column closing in from the west, and General Edward Canby&#x27;s Army approaching from the north, guerillas from the Mesilla area rose against the confiscations of the 7th Texas Mounted Rifles and 1st Arizona Mounted Rifles left to garrison the Mesilla Valley. The Second Battle of Mesilla was a skirmish fought in the desert near Mesilla on July 1, 1862, between Confederate Arizona rebels and pro Union New Mexican militia. The engagement ended with a Union victory and with the threat of the more numerous Union forces closing in, prompted the rebels to withdraw from Mesilla, retreating into Texas in early July.

==Aftermath==
Following the Confederate retreat, units from the Union California Column under the command of Colonel James Carleton occupied several forts in western Texas. Canby was promoted to brigadier general and reassigned to the eastern theater. He was succeeded as commander of the department by Carleton, who was also promoted to brigadier general. The best men from the New Mexico volunteers were formed into the 1st New Mexico Cavalry with Kit Carson in command; the regiment spent the rest of the war fighting Indian tribes in the territory.

Although the Confederates continued to consider Arizona part of the Confederacy and made several plans for another invasion, they were never able to put these plans into execution. Sibley&#x27;s brigade would be called by many the &quot;Arizona Brigade&quot; and continued to serve in various areas in Texas and Louisiana during the remainder of the war. Sibley would eventually be demoted to directing supply trains in 1863.

==Battlefields today==
Approximately of the Glorieta Pass Battlefield is today protected within the Pecos National Historical Park, and the National Park Service allows access on the park&#x27;s Civil War sites only to permit-holders and guided tours. There are numerous interpretive signs and exhibits around the park and along nearby roads including Interstate 25, which parallels the Santa Fe National Historic Trail through Glorieta Pass.

The Valverde battlefield was commemorated by a historical marker along a nearby highway in the corridor known as the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, now a National Historic Trail.

The Battle of Peralta (loosely depicted in &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;) was commemorated by a state historical marker at the north end of the village, now surrounded by suburban development from metropolitan Albuquerque.

The Battle of Albuquerque was memorialized on the city&#x27;s Old Town Plaza including plaques and cannons.

The First and Second Battle of Mesilla have an interpretive sign on the Plaza in historic Mesilla, which was the capital of the Confederate Arizona territory during the Civil War, but is now part of metropolitan Las Cruces in far southern New Mexico.

==Campaign legacy==
* The name of the town of Albuquerque, Texas, was inspired by campaign members&#x27; return home to the area following the war.

<text>William Henry Lytton Earle Bulwer, 1st Baron Dalling and Bulwer, (13 February 180123 May 1872) was a British Liberal politician, diplomat and writer.

==Background and education==
Bulwer was the second son of General William Bulwer and his wife, Elizabeth Barbara, daughter of Richard Warburton-Lytton. He was an elder brother of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton, uncle of Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton, Viceroy of India, 1876–1880, and the uncle of Sir Henry Ernest Gascoyne Bulwer. He was educated at Harrow School, Trinity College and then the recently founded Downing College, both at Cambridge. After graduating and touring the continent, he joined the Life Guards in 1824 and exchanged to the 58th Regiment of Foot two years later.

==Diplomatic and political career==
After having unsuccessfully contested Hertford in 1826, Bulwer joined the Diplomatic Service in 1827 and was sent to Berlin in August that year, to Vienna in April 1829 and then to The Hague in April 1830. In July 1830, he entered the House of Commons as MP for the rotten borough of Wilton and was sent to Brussels the following month to report on the Belgian Revolution. A year later, he was returned for Coventry, again in 1833, then for Marylebone in 1835.

At a meeting in Sydney on 29 May 1835, Australian statesman William Wentworth discussed a proposal of Bulwer&#x27;s for a colonial committee to be formed which would act through a Parliamentary Advocate, for which Bulwer nominated himself, to represent New South Wales. The meeting resolved to raise £2,000 to fund the position by establishing the Australian Patriotic Association, Australia&#x27;s first political party.

That year, Bulwer planned to join General Evans, who was raising a legion to help Isabella II of Spain in the First Carlist War, but was instead sent back to the newly independent Belgium as secretary of legation. When a general election was called two years later on the death of William IV, Bulwer decided not to contest his current seat for Marylebone and after having commuted between Parliament and his diplomatics posts for seven years, decided to become a full-time diplomat and was sent to Constantinople.

A year later, Bulwer was due to go to St Petersburg after accepting a new post there, but caught a fever just before leaving Constantinople and instead went back to London. Upon his arrival, the government was embroiled in the Bedchamber Crisis and because of the delays involved, Bulwer did not take up his post in Russia and was instead sent to Paris in June 1839. After having dealt with the poor Anglo-French relations prior to the London Straits Convention, Bulwer was sent to Madrid in November 1843 and served there until Narváez instructed him to leave in 1848, after being accused of implicating liberal risings against the former&#x27;s conservative government. By now a diplomatic embarrassment in Europe, the British government formally showed its support of Bulwer by making him a KCB that year, but sent him far from Europe, to Washington a year later.

Bulwer enjoyed his three years in America, having been promoted to GCB during his office, but wished to return to Europe and so was posted to Florence, Tuscany, in 1852. His two years in Italy were largely uneventful and ill health forced him back to London in 1854. He was granted a pension a year later and it was at this time that he and his wife separated. When his health improved, Bulwer was in Eastern Europe from 1856 to 1858. In 1858, he succeeded Lord Stratford de Redcliffe as Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire and his wife joined him. He significantly contributed to the indebtedness of the Ottoman regime. This was his final diplomatic post before his semi-retirement in 1865.

On his return to England, Bulwer went back to politics and successfully contested Tamworth in 1868. He returned to literature after his retirement and was also raised to the peerage as Baron Dalling and Bulwer, of Dalling in the County of Norfolk, in 1871.

==Personal life==
Lord Dalling and Bulwer married the Honourable Georgiana, youngest daughter of Henry Wellesley, 1st Baron Cowley and a niece of the Duke of Wellington, at Hatfield House in December 1848. They had no children. On his return from a trip to Egypt in 1872, Bulwer died suddenly in Naples, aged 71, when the barony became extinct. His will was valued at less than £5,000. His estranged widow died in August 1878, aged 61.

A Freemason, he became the first district grand master for Turkey under the United Grand Lodge of England in 1862.

<doc id="1212951" wikidata="Q156146" url="?curid=1212951" title="Saxifraga">
<text>Saxifraga is the largest genus in the family Saxifragaceae, containing about 473 species of holarctic perennial plants, known as saxifrages or rockfoils. The Latin word &quot;saxifraga&quot; means literally &quot;stone-breaker&quot;, from Latin &#x27; (&quot;rock&quot; or &quot;stone&quot;) +&#x27; (&quot;to break&quot;). It is usually thought to indicate a medicinal use for treatment of urinary calculi (known as kidney or bladder stones), rather than breaking rocks apart.

==Description==

Most saxifrages are small perennial, biennial (e.g. &quot;S. adscendens&quot;) or annual (e.g. &quot;S. tridactylites&quot;) herbaceous plants whose basal or cauline leaves grow close to the ground, often in a rosette. The leaves typically have a more or less incised margin; they may be succulent, needle-like and/or hairy, reducing evaporation.

The inflorescence or single flower clusters rise above the main plant body on naked stalks. The small actinomorphic hermaphrodite flowers have five petals and sepals and are usually white, but red to yellow in some species. Stamens, usually 10, rarely 8, insert at the junction of the floral tube and ovary wall, with filaments subulate or clavate. As in other primitive eudicots, some of the 5 or 10 stamens may appear petal-like. and it lives in tundral ecosystems.

== Taxonomy ==

A genus of about 473 species. The former monotypic genus &quot;Saxifragella&quot; has been submersed within Saxifraga, the largest genus in Saxifragaceae, as &quot;Saxifraga bicuspidata&quot;. Also the genus &quot;Saxifragopsis&quot; (strawberry saxifrage) was previously included in &quot;Saxifraga&quot;.

=== Subdivision ===

Based on morphological criteria, up to 15 sections were recognised. Subsequent molecular phylogenetic studies reduced this to 13 sections with 9 subsections. The former sections &quot;Micranthes&quot; and &quot;Merkianae&quot; are more closely related to the &quot;Boykinia&quot; and &quot;Heuchera&quot; clades. Modern floras separate these groups as the genus &quot;Micranthes&quot;.

The thirteen sections (with subsections) are:
*&quot;Irregulares&quot;
*&quot;Saxifragella&quot;
*&quot;Pseudocymbalaria&quot;
*&quot;Bronchiales&quot;
*&quot;Ciliatae&quot;

===Other &quot;saxifragous&quot; plants===

Several plant genera have names referring to saxifrages, although they might not be close relatives of &quot;Saxifraga&quot;. They include:
*Golden-saxifrages, &quot;Chrysosplenium&quot;
*Burnet-saxifrages, &quot;Pimpinella&quot;
*Pepper-saxifrage, &quot;Silaum silaus&quot;. The name &quot;silaum&quot; comes from the Latin word sil, which means yellow ochre. This refers to the sulphurous yellow colour of the flowers.

Some plants refer to &quot;Saxifraga&quot; in their generic names or specific epithets, either because they are also &quot;rock-breaking&quot; or because they resemble members of the saxifrage genus:
*&quot;Campanula saxifraga&quot;
*&quot;Celmisia saxifraga&quot; 
*&quot;Cineraria saxifraga&quot; 
*&quot;Dryopteris saxifraga&quot;
*&quot;Petrorhagia saxifraga&quot; – Tunicflower
*&quot;Pimpinella saxifraga&quot; – Burnet saxifrage
*&quot;Ptychotis saxifraga&quot;
*&quot;Saxifragella&quot;
*&quot;Saxifragodes&quot;
*&quot;Saxifragopsis&quot; 

==Ecology==
Saxifrages are typical inhabitants of Arctic–alpine ecosystems, and are hardly ever found outside the temperate parts of the Northern Hemisphere; most members of this genus are found in subarctic climates. A good number of species grow in glacial habitats, such as &quot;S. biflora&quot; which can be found some above sea level in the Alps, or the East Greenland saxifrage (&quot;S. nathorstii&quot;). The genus is also abundant in the Eastern and Western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows. Though the archetypal saxifrage is a small plant huddling between rocks high up on a mountain, many species do not occur in such a habitat and are larger (though still rather delicate) plants found on wet meadows.

Various &quot;Saxifraga&quot; species are used as food plants by the caterpillars of some butterflies and moths, such as the Phoebus Apollo (&quot;Parnassius phoebus&quot;).

Charles Darwin – erroneously believing &quot;Saxifraga&quot; to be allied to the sundew family (Droseraceae) – suspected the sticky-leaved round-leaved saxifrage (&quot;S. rotundifolia&quot;), rue-leaved saxifrage (&quot;S. tridactylites&quot;) and Pyrenean saxifrage (&quot;S. umbrosa&quot;) to be protocarnivorous plants, and conducted some experiments whose results supported his observations, but the matter has apparently not been studied since his time.

==Cultivation==

Numerous species and cultivars of saxifrage are cultivated as ornamental garden plants, valued particularly as groundcover or as cushion plants in rock gardens and alpine gardens. Many require alkaline or neutral soil to thrive.

&quot;S. &quot;×&quot; urbium&quot; (London pride), a hybrid between Pyrenean saxifrage (&quot;S. umbrosa&quot;) and St. Patrick&#x27;s cabbage (&quot;S. spathularis&quot;), is commonly grown as an ornamental plant. Another horticultural hybrid is Robertsoniana saxifrage (&quot;S. × geum&quot;), derived from kidney saxifrage (&quot;S. hirsuta&quot;) and Pyrenean saxifrage. Some wild species are also used in gardening. Cambridge University Botanic Garden hosts the United Kingdom&#x27;s national collection of saxifrages.

==Uses==

The leaves of some saxifrage species, such as creeping saxifrage (&quot;S. stolonifera&quot;) and &quot;S. pensylvanica&quot;, are edible. The former is a food in Korea and Japan. The flowers of purple saxifrage (&quot;S. oppositifolia&quot;) are eaten in Nunavut, Canada and the leaves and stems brewed as a tea.

Species are also used in traditional medicine, such as creeping saxifrage in East Asia and round-leaved saxifrage (&quot;S. rotundifolia&quot;) in Europe.

Two species—purple saxifrage and creeping saxifrage—are popular floral emblems. They are official flowers for:

*Nunavut, Canada - purple saxifrage
*County Londonderry, Northern Ireland - purple saxifrage
*Tsukuba, Japan - creeping saxifrage, &quot;hoshizaki&quot; form (&quot;S. stolonifera&quot; Curtis f. &quot;aptera&quot;)

<text>Port Burwell Wind Farm (formerly known as the Erie Shores Wind Farm) is a large wind farm near Port Burwell, Ontario, Canada. The facility stretches approximately to the west of the town, and to the southeast.

In 2004, Port Burwell was awarded a generation contract by the Government of Ontario as part of its renewable energy plan. This wind farm was officially opened on April 13, 2006.

The project comprises 66 GE 1.5 MW Wind Turbines (model 1.5 SLE). Each turbine has a blade diameter of , and is mounted on an 80-metre (260 ft) tubular tower.

An important measure of renewable energy generation is the capacity factor (actual output per year divided by the nameplate output). In 2009 the output was and in 2010 the output was , so the capacity factor was 26.8% and 26.2% respectively. Published reports show that the developers were expecting the capacity factor to be higher – 28.6% to 32%.

<doc id="1212965" wikidata="Q5282072" url="?curid=1212965" title="Discretionary spending">
<text>In American public finance, discretionary spending is government spending implemented through an appropriations bill. This spending is an optional part of fiscal policy, in contrast to social programs for which funding is mandatory and determined by the number of eligible recipients. Some examples of areas funded by discretionary spending are national defense, foreign aid, education and transportation.

== United States discretionary spending ==
In the United States, discretionary spending refers to optional spending set by appropriation levels each year, at the discretion of Congress. During the budget process, Congress issues a budget resolution which includes levels of discretionary spending, deficit projections, and instructions for changing entitlement programs and tax policy. After setting discretionary spending levels, both the House Appropriations Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee divide the agreed-upon amount of discretionary spending into twelve suballocations for each of their twelve subcommittees. These subcommittees produce twelve annual appropriation bills for the next fiscal year. While these bills are subject to revision as they move through hearings, markups, Floor consideration, and conference, the level of discretionary spending remains constrained by the budget resolution. Eventually, these twelve bills must be approved by the full Appropriations Committee, followed by both Houses of Congress. Once passed, the president either signs them, vetoes them, or allows them to become law by not signing them within ten days.

In 2016, the U.S. federal government spent $1.2 trillion on U.S. discretionary spending. Of this $1.2 trillion, nearly half ($584 billion) was spent on national defense. The rest of U.S. discretionary spending was allocated for education, training, employment, and social services ($92 billion), as well as transportation ($91 billion), veterans&#x27; benefits and services ($68 billion), income security ($66 billion), health ($57 billion), administration of justice ($53 billion), international affairs ($52 billion), and other areas related to natural resources, the environment, science, space, and technology ($122 billion).

== United States mandatory vs. discretionary spending ==
In 1962, U.S. discretionary spending made up 47.2% of total U.S. spending, remaining the largest component of federal spending until the mid-1970s. From this time forward, however, discretionary spending levels as a share of total federal spending has decreased significantly. This is largely due to the rapid growth of entitlement spending, also known as mandatory spending. As more participants become eligible for entitlement programs, mandatory spending automatically increases. This trend is projected to continue in the future. In fact, according to the Congressional Research Service, over the next decade, mandatory spending is projected to reach 14% of GDP, while discretionary spending is projected to continue getting smaller, eventually reaching 5% of GDP. The Congressional Research Service projected that by 2022, discretionary spending&#x27;s share of the economy would be &quot;equal to or less than spending in each of the two largest categories of mandatory programs, Social Security and Major Health Programs.&quot;

<doc id="1212974" wikidata="Q1017477" url="?curid=1212974" title="Courtenay, British Columbia">
<text>Courtenay ( ) is a city of about 26,000 on the east coast of Vancouver Island, in the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is the largest community and only city in the area commonly known as the Comox Valley, and the seat of the Comox Valley Regional District, which replaced the Comox-Strathcona Regional District. Courtenay is west of the town of Comox, northeast of the village of Cumberland, northwest of the unincorporated settlement of Royston, and northwest of Nanaimo. Along with Nanaimo and Victoria, it is home to The Canadian Scottish Regiment (Princess Mary&#x27;s), a Primary Reserve infantry regiment of the Canadian Armed Forces.

It was named after the nearby river, Courtenay River which in turn had been named for Rear-Admiral Courtenay.

Courtenay and nearby Comox are served by the coast-spanning Island Highway, the Island Rail Corridor, and a local airport in Comox.

==History==
===Early history===
Archaeological evidence suggests there was an active Coast Salish fishing settlement on the shores of the Courtenay River Estuary for at least 4,000 years. Due to its gentle climate, fertile soil and abundant sea life, the Coast Salish residents called the area &quot;kw&#x27;umuxws&quot; (Li&#x27;kwala for &quot;plentiful&quot;), which was eventually anglicized to &quot;Komoux&quot; and then to &quot;Comox&quot;.

At the time of first contact with Europeans, the Pentlatch Nation, who spoke the Island Comox dialect of the Comox Coast Salish language, occupied the shores of present-day Comox Bay. (The last speaker of the Island Comox dialect died in 1995.) Another Island Comox speaking Nation, the K&#x27;ómoks, occupied settlements further north along the east coast of Vancouver Island, in the area of present-day Campbell River, including Quadra Island and several other Gulf islands.
Along the tidal flats of the estuary, the Pentlatch set out elaborate fishing weirs—nets tied to wooden stakes that would be covered at high tide but uncovered at low tide, allowing trapped fish to be removed. These wooden stakes can still be seen at low tide — local archaeologist Nancy Greene has estimated that up to 200,000 wooden stakes remain in the mud flats. Several of these wooden stakes were carbon dated, revealing the oldest to be made from a hemlock tree c.750 CE, while the youngest dated from around 1830. Some scientists estimate that the weirs could have supported a population of several thousand people. The Pentlatch also harvested the abundant shellfish in Comox Bay.

By the 19th century, the K&#x27;ómoks had been driven out of their lands near Campbell River by the Lekwiltok, a particularly fierce group of Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw. The K&#x27;ómoks migrated south to the shores of the Courtenay River estuary, where they allied with the resident Pentlatch against their common enemy. In 1862, a major smallpox epidemic swept across Vancouver Island, killing an estimated 30% of First Nations people. A census of First Nations in the Comox Valley taken in 1876 revealed that the local First Nations population had dwindled to only 88 K&#x27;ómoks and 21 Pentlatch.

European settlers began to arrive in the area in 1872, and by 1876, the K&#x27;ómoks and Pentledge had been moved onto two reservations: Comox Indian Reserve No. 1 adjacent to the village of Comox, and Pentledge Indian Reserve No. 2 at the confluence of the Puntledge and Tsolum rivers adjacent to the village of Courtenay.

===Early European explorers===
In 1579, Francis Drake, on his circumnavigation of the globe in the Golden Hind, found a good port somewhere along the northwest coast of North America and stayed for several months while restocking supplies and trading with the inhabitants of the area. He named the region &quot;Nova Albion&quot;, Latin for &quot;New Britain&quot;. Drake&#x27;s detailed logs — and the exact location of Nova Albion — were later lost in a 17th-century fire, but some historians believe Drake made a landing in the Courtenay River estuary.

In 1791, a Spanish expedition led by Dionisio Alcalá Galiano and Cayetano Valdés y Flores produced a crude chart of the Strait of Georgia and possibly visited Comox Bay. Captain George Vancouver arrived the following year, tasked by the British government with charting the northwest coast of North America. Vancouver, in concert with the Spanish expedition, entered the Courtenay River estuary between the present-day locations of Courtenay and Comox and charted the shoreline of the estuary.

===Early settlers===

By the middle of the 19th century, European and American settlements had sprung up in the Vancouver area and on southern Vancouver Island. In 1837, the Hudson Bay Company steamship &quot;Beaver&quot; began to search the south and east coasts of Vancouver Island for suitable locations for new trading posts, and subsequently set up a post overlooking the Courtenay River estuary, calling it &quot;Komoux&quot;.

, commanded by Captain Courtenay, was a frequent visitor to the area. In 1848, the river flowing through the Koumax valley was informally named the Courtenay River by the sailors of HMS &quot;Constance&quot; after their captain. In 1857, Captain George Richards of was tasked with undertaking a complete survey of the coastline of Vancouver Island, and was given authority to name local landmarks. When he arrived in the area, he confirmed the name of the river as the Courtenay.

In 1853 Sir James Douglas, governor of Vancouver Island, took a journey up the coast of Vancouver Island aboard SS &quot;Beaver&quot;, and recognized the area&#x27;s agricultural potential. In 1861, Lieutenant Richard Mayne of the Royal Navy visited the area and wrote of the rich agricultural prospects of the area, saying it had taken him a day and a half to walk over the land &quot;through which a plough might be driven from end to end&quot;. That same year Governor Douglas issued a land and settlement proclamation for the Koumox Valley, intending to divert new settlers away from the Victoria area as well as from the newly discovered Cariboo gold fields. He offered land in the valley for $1 per acre and free transportation to the area.
Although some unofficial settlers had arrived in previous years, the first government-approved settlers arrived in 1862 aboard . The majority of the settlers staked out farm lots on the flat and fertile &quot;prairies&quot; on the east side of the river, and a small village sprung up on the east bank of the river to supply their needs. The Courtenay Hotel, also known as Courtenay House, became the focal point of a village that included a general store, a small bank, a barber, and livery barns. However, it was not an ideal location, since the river regularly burst its banks due to king tides or spring run-off, flooding the entire village.
In 1864, Robert Brown, leading the Vancouver Island Exploring Expedition, discovered coal deposits in the Comox Valley, but these went unexploited for two decades. 
In 1874, a new settler to the area, Joseph McPhee, won the contract to build a bridge that connected the regularly flooded flats on the east side of the river to higher ground on the west side of the river. When the bridge was finished, McPhee and business partner Reginald Pidcock bought up of land on the western side of the river immediately adjacent to the new bridge. McPhee built a store beside the bridge, while Pidcock built the Courtenay River&#x27;s first commercial enterprise, a saw mill. 
In 1888 Robert Dunsmuir established a mine in nearby Union, later renamed Cumberland, which brought an influx of settlers, and Chinese and Japanese immigrants. McPhee and Pidcock recognized the economic potential of a townsite on the western bank of the river, which would be closer to the mines. They hired a surveyor, George Drabble, to survey and subdivide their land into town lots, which they quickly sold to businessmen and homeowners. The townsite on the much drier west side of the river, called for a time &quot;New Courtenay&quot;, quickly developed. Many of the stores and businesses centred on what was originally called Union Street (now 5th Street), which ascended from McPhee&#x27;s bridge.

===Early 20th century===

The Comox Co-operative Creamery opened in 1901, encouraging the development of dairy farms in the fertile valley. Courtenay had no connecting roads to the rest of the Island; news and mail were provided by packet steamers. But in 1905, Joseph McPhee brought telephone service to his store, providing the isolated community with immediate contact to the outside world. A connecting road to Nanaimo and Victoria was finally built in 1910, and the E&amp;N Railway arrived in 1914, bringing an end to the packet steamer era.
Electricity arrived in the area in 1914, provided by Courtenay Electric Light Heat and Power However, some citizens, led by Joseph McPhee, believed that electricity should be provided by a publicly owned company, and Courtenay was incorporated as a town on 1 January 1915 to facilitate this. In order to make a publicly owned company a reality, McPhee ran for the office of mayor, but lost by a mere five votes to rival Dan McPatrick, who favoured a private electrical company. However, a majority of the alderman elected to council were allies of McPhee, and in December 1916, the new town purchased Courtenay Electric Light Heat and Power, making it a public utility.

On 12 July 1915, a large fire ripped through 5th Street destroying much of the south side of the downtown. After much of the street was rebuilt, another fire hit the south side of 5th Street, again destroying many of the stores. In both cases, due to the lack of a water system, the citizens were only able to fight the fires with a bucket brigade. Joseph McPhee led the call for a water system, which was installed by October 1921.

In 1921, a new chapter of the Native Sons of Canada was formed in Courtenay, with Joseph McPhee as president. They decided to build a hall, and a large log structure was completed in 1928, the largest freespan log building in Canada.

In 1923, a steel bridge at the 5th Street river crossing replaced McPhee&#x27;s fifty-year-old wooden structure. The town&#x27;s population experienced steady growth in the years between the First and Second World Wars, increasing from 600 people in 1914 to 1700 in 1941. By 1951, the population had grown to 2500, and Courtenay was designated a city in 1953. In 1960, the 5th Street bridge built in 1923 was replaced with the current steel structure. Concrete sidewalks and a sewer system were installed in 1962.

In 1975, the construction of Driftwood Mall and the opening of a second river crossing, the 17th Street lift bridge, refocused the business district from 5th Street to Cliffe Avenue.

===Earthquake of 1946===

On 14 June 1946, a 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck just west of Courtenay, with the epicentre located at Forbidden Plateau. The earthquake was felt as far north as Prince Rupert and as far south as Portland, Oregon. Many of the town&#x27;s chimneys were destroyed, and there was significant damage to the post office and what is now Courtenay Elementary School. This was the largest earthquake to hit Vancouver Island, and the largest onshore earthquake in Canada on record. There were only two reported deaths: one Seattle man died of a heart attack and another drowned when his boat capsized due to a resulting wave.

==Geography==
According to Statistics Canada, the city has a total land area of . The city is located on the British Columbia Coast and sits on the Strait of Georgia.

===Climate===
The climate in Courtenay is very similar to that of the rest of eastern Vancouver Island, classified as an Oceanic climate (Cfb). In the spring and fall seasons, Courtenay tends to be quite cool and wet. It has one of the mildest winters in Canada along with several other locations on the island such as Victoria. The high precipitation levels can be attributed to both the oceanic climate and also its proximity to the Insular Mountain range which results in the rain shadow effect. Courtenay has quite mild winters, maintaining the cool and damp characteristics, but temperatures can drop below freezing levels and snow may happen throughout the season due to Arctic air movements.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Courtenay had a population of 28,420 living in 12,992 of its 13,414 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 25,639. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

Over the years as this natural resource extraction decreased, Courtenay has focused its economic growth on supplying services to the large retiree community and the military families at CFB Comox, which is the largest employer in the Comox Valley, supplying approximately 1,400 jobs. Tourism has also been steadily increasing and has now become a vital part of the Comox Valley economy. St. Joseph&#x27;s General Hospital, Mount Washington home of the Critically Endangered Vancouver Island marmot, Crown Isle Golf Course, Kingfisher Resort and Spa and the Best Western Westerly Hotel, and the Air Force base at Comox are in the top 15 employers in the Comox Valley, providing 1,200 jobs.

==Attractions==
===Paleontology===
Courtenay has established itself as a hot spot for paleontology discoveries. Professional and amateur paleontologists have been discovering fossils of pre-historic sea life in Courtenay, and the Comox Valley is considered to be the first stop on the Great Canadian Fossil Trail. Millions of years ago Vancouver Island was submerged under a warm salt-water sea. This habitat provided an excellent home to pre-historic marine life. After the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, that caused the extinction of dinosaurs, Vancouver Island began to be shaped by volcanic activity, tectonic plate movement, and glacial ice movements. This activity and glacial erosion along the Puntledge and Trent rivers have revealed some of that 80-million-year-old sea floor. This access to the ancient sea bed has provided the opportunity for many great marine dinosaur discoveries, like the Elasmosaur and the Mosasaur.

The first major paleontological discovery in Courtenay occurred in 1988 when resident Mike Trask and his daughter discovered the first fossil of an 80-million-year-old Elasmosaur on the banks of the Puntledge River. Over the next few months, the excavation, led by Dr. Roif Ludvigson, revealed a near complete skeleton. The skull and other key bones for identifying the species were in poor condition, and it is still unknown as to what species or genus this Elasmosaur belonged. The original bones and a replica model are on display at the Courtenay &amp; District Museum and Paleontology Center.

In 1991, during a field trip, Dr. Joe Zanbilowicz discovered a fossilized bone along the Puntledge River and a few more vertebrae were excavated that day. During the summers of 1997 and 1998, excavation led by Dr. Dirk Meckert revealed a near complete Mosasaur skeleton. After analysis of the skeleton began, paleontologists Dr. Meckter and Dr. Betsy Nicholls, realized this 80-million year old skeleton was a new kind of Mosasaur that had not yet been discovered. They named this new species of Mosasaur, Kourisodon Puntledgensis, for its unique two extra rows of razor-like teeth and its discovery location.

After these two large discoveries, there are still many species of animals being discovered, such as desmatochelys (sea turtles), Nanaimoteuthis jeletzkyi (vampire squids), and multiple species of octopods.

<text>Dandelion Records was a British record label started on 18 July 1969 by the British DJ John Peel.

==History==
The label was started as a way to get the music Peel liked onto record. Peel was responsible for &quot;artistic direction&quot; and the commercial side was handled by Clive Selwood of Elektra Records and his wife Shirley. Peel wrote: 

Dandelion and the sister publishing company Biscuit were named after Peel&#x27;s hamsters at the suggestion of his then flatmate Marc Bolan.

Around twenty eight albums were released by the label. One album was by Gene Vincent, with a cast of musicians including members of The Byrds and Steppenwolf. Others were by younger or non-commercial artists, including Beau, Bridget St John, Medicine Head, Clifford T. Ward, David Bedford, Lol Coxhill, Stack Waddy, Tractor, Kevin Coyne/Siren, and Denmark&#x27;s Burnin&#x27; Red Ivanhoe.

The only record ever to make the UK Singles Chart was &quot;(And The) Pictures in the Sky&quot; by Medicine Head, which reached #22 in 1971. Beau&#x27;s &quot;1917 Revolution&quot; made #1 in the Lebanon in 1969.

Dandelion Records were distributed by, successively, CBS Records, Warner Bros. Records and Polydor. The label ran until late 1972 when it started to try to place its artists with other labels as its distribution via Polydor had ceased. It had issued about a dozen singles and two dozen albums. Several releases attracted a cult audience but never quite crossed into the mainstream, although one of the last singles, Clifford T. Ward&#x27;s &#x27;Coathanger&#x27;, from his debut album &#x27;Singer Songwriter&#x27;, attracted a certain amount of airplay on Radio 1. Both Tractor and Medicine Head appeared fairly high in various album charts- Medicine Head would go on to appear on Top of the Pops and Tractor would get heavily involved in the hippy festival circuit which they still make rare appearances on to this day. As Peel himself told &quot;Record Collector&quot; in 1994, &#x27;when you can&#x27;t afford full-page ads in the music press, artists become very resentful...there&#x27;s no faster way of losing friends.&#x27;

One of the most curious albums issued by the label was a sampler, &quot;There is Some Fun Going Forward&quot;.

Most Dandelion recordings have been reissued on vinyl and/or CD. A batch of half a dozen came out on CD on Repertoire Records in the early 1990s, followed by the whole catalogue as two-on-one CDs by See For Miles Records in the mid-1990s.

Individual albums have been licensed around the world, with major catalogue releases since 2005 on Cherry Red Records in the UK and Airmail Archive Recordings in Japan. Cherry Red acquired the entire catalogue of original Dandelion Records recordings (excluding Tractor / The Way We Live) in September 2009. The UK trade mark Dandelion Records and its Dandelion flower logo are the intellectual property of Ozit Morpheus Records who have released new recordings under the Dandelion Records brand.

The Dandelion Records by Tractor and The Way We Live were reissued in the 2000s by Ozit Morpheus Records, as was a six-hour DVD about John Peel and some of the artists on Dandelion Records. This was released as a tribute to John in November 2008. It includes a contribution from his wife Sheila Ravenscroft.

<doc id="1212980" wikidata="Q6255634" url="?curid=1212980" title="John Roseboro">
<text>John Junior Roseboro (May 13, 1933 – August 16, 2002) was an American professional baseball player and coach. He played as a catcher in Major League Baseball from 1957 until 1970, most prominently as a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers. A four-time All-Star player, Roseboro is considered one of the best defensive catchers of the 1960s, winning two Gold Glove Awards. He was the Dodgers&#x27; starting catcher in four World Series with the Dodgers winning three of those.

Roseboro is known for his role in one of the most violent incidents in baseball history, when San Francisco Giants pitcher Juan Marichal struck him in the head with a bat during a game between the rival Dodgers and the Giants on August 22, 1965.

==Early life==
Roseboro was born in Ashland, Ohio to Cecil Geraldine (née Lowery) and John Roseboro Sr. on May 13, 1933. He had a younger brother named Jim who played football as a halfback at Ohio State University.

He attended Ashland High School where he played both baseball and football. He was the catcher on the baseball team but, preferred playing halfback for the football team and won a football scholarship to attend Central State University.

During this time, Roseboro was spotted by Dodgers scout Hugh Alexander working out with the baseball team (due to poor grades, Roseboro was ineligible to play for the baseball team). Alexander liked what he saw and invited him to try out for the Brooklyn Dodgers when they came to play in Cincinnati.

==Baseball career==
===Minor league years===
Roseboro was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers as an amateur free agent before the 1952 season and, began his professional baseball career with the Class-D Sheboygan Indians of the Wisconsin State League. He posted a .365 batting average with Sheboygan in 1952 to finish second in the league batting championship.

After Roseboro was promoted to the Class-C Great Falls Electrics of the Pioneer League in 1953, he was drafted into the United States Army which forced him to miss the remainder of the 1953 season and the whole of the 1954 season. Upon completing his military service in 1955, he played in the Class-B Cedar Rapids Raiders of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League and the Class-A Pueblo Dodgers of the Western League.

Before the 1956 season, he was promoted to the Triple-A Montreal Royals of the International League. In June 1957, after five years in the minor leagues and shortly after his 24th birthday, he was promoted to the major leagues.

===Major League career===
====Campanella&#x27;s heir apparent====
During his first season in the major leagues, Roseboro served as backup catcher for the Dodgers&#x27; perennial All-Star catcher Roy Campanella and was being groomed to be Campanella&#x27;s replacement. However, in January 1958, he was promoted to the starting catcher&#x27;s position ahead of schedule when Campanella was badly injured in an automobile accident that left him paralyzed from the shoulders down and ended his athletic career.

In his first full season, with the team having moved to Los Angeles, Roseboro hit for a .271 batting average, along with 14 home runs and 43 runs batted in. He was also named as a reserve player for the National League in the 1958 All-Star Game. In 1959, Roseboro led the league&#x27;s catchers in putouts and in baserunners caught stealing, helping the Dodgers win the National League pennant. The Dodgers went on to win the 1959 World Series, defeating the Chicago White Sox in six games.

After having a below par season in 1960, Roseboro rebounded in 1961 posting career highs with 18 home runs and 59 runs batted in. He also led the National League catchers in putouts and double plays and finished second in fielding percentage and in assists to earn his first Gold Glove Award when the Dodgers finished the season in second place behind the Cincinnati Reds. He also earned his second All-Star team berth as a reserve player in the 1961 All-Star Game.

During spring training 1962, Roseboro was amongst the group of black Dodger players, along with Tommy Davis, Maury Wills, Jim Gilliam, and Willie Davis, who approached Peter O&#x27;Malley, son of the Dodgers&#x27; owner, and demanded that segregation come to an end at Dodgertown. Unlike the spring training facilities for players, the facilities for spectators, including the seating in Holman Stadium, were still racially segregated. Their demands were met and all signs in the stadium marked &quot;Colored&quot; were removed. Roseboro and Davis both later encouraged black spectators sitting the formerly segregated seats to sit wherever they wanted to.

Roseboro earned his third All-Star berth, as a reserve in the 1962 All-Star Game. The Dodgers battled the San Francisco Giants in a tight pennant race during the 1962 season, with the two teams ending the season tied for first place and meeting in the 1962 National League tie-breaker series. The Giants won the three-game series to clinch the National League championship.

In 1963, Roseboro helped guide the Dodgers&#x27; pitching staff to a league leading 2.85 earned run average as, the team clinched the National League pennant by six games over the St. Louis Cardinals. Roseboro made his presence felt in the 1963 World Series against the New York Yankees when he hit a three-run home run off Whitey Ford to win the first game of the series. The Dodgers went on to win the series by defeating the Yankees in four straight games. The Dodgers dropped to seventh place in the 1964 season, however Roseboro hit for a career high .287 batting average and led the league&#x27;s catchers with a 60.4% caught stealing percentage, the ninth highest season percentage in major league history.

====Roseboro-Marichal incident====
Roseboro was involved in a major altercation with Juan Marichal during a game between the Dodgers and San Francisco Giants at Candlestick Park on August 22, 1965. The Giants and the Dodgers had nurtured a heated rivalry with each other dating back to their days together in New York City. As the 1965 season neared its climax, the Dodgers were involved in a tight pennant race, entering the game leading the Milwaukee Braves by half a game and the Giants by one and a half games. The incident occurred in the aftermath of the Watts riots near Roseboro&#x27;s Los Angeles home and while the Dominican Civil War raged in Marichal&#x27;s home country so emotions were raw.

Maury Wills led off the game with a bunt single off Marichal, and eventually scored a run when Ron Fairly hit a double. Marichal, a fierce competitor, viewed the bunt as a cheap way to get on base and took umbrage with Wills. When Wills came up to bat in the second inning, Marichal threw a pitch directly at Wills, sending him sprawling to the ground. Willie Mays then led off the bottom of the second inning for the Giants and Dodgers&#x27; pitcher Sandy Koufax threw a pitch over Mays&#x27; head as a token form of retaliation. In the top of the third inning with two outs, Marichal threw a fastball that came close to hitting Fairly, prompting him to dive to the ground. Marichal&#x27;s act angered the Dodgers sitting in the dugout and home plate umpire Shag Crawford then warned both teams that any further retaliations would not be tolerated.

Marichal came up to bat in the third inning expecting Koufax to take further retaliation against him. Instead, he was startled when Roseboro&#x27;s return throw to Koufax after the second pitch either brushed his ear or came close enough for him to feel the breeze off the ball. When Marichal confronted Roseboro about the proximity of his throw, Roseboro came out of his crouch with his fists clenched. Marichal afterwards stated that he thought Roseboro was about to attack him and raised his bat, striking Roseboro at least twice over the head with it, opening a two-inch gash that sent blood flowing down the catcher&#x27;s face and required 14 stitches. Koufax raced in from the mound attempting to separate them and was joined by the umpires, players and coaches from both teams.

A 14-minute brawl ensued on the field before Koufax, Mays and other peacemakers restored order. Marichal was ejected from the game. Afterwards, National League president Warren Giles suspended him for eight games (two starts), fined him a then-NL record $1,750 (equivalent to $ in ), and forbade him from traveling to Dodger Stadium for the final, key two-game series of the season. Roseboro filed a $110,000 damage suit against Marichal one week after the incident but eventually settled out of court for $7,500.

Years later, in his memoirs, Roseboro stated that he was retaliating for Marichal&#x27;s having thrown at Wills. He took matters into his own hands as he did not want to risk Koufax being ejected and possibly being suspended for retaliating while the Dodgers were in the middle of a close pennant race. He stated that his throwing close to Marichal&#x27;s ear was &quot;standard operating procedure&quot;, as a form of retribution.

Marichal didn&#x27;t face the Dodgers again until spring training on April 3, 1966. In his first at bat against Marichal after the incident, Roseboro hit a three-run home run. Later on, Giants General Manager Chub Feeney approached Dodgers General Manager Buzzie Bavasi to attempt to arrange a handshake between Marichal and Roseboro but Roseboro declined the offer.

Dodger fans remained angry with Marichal for several years after the altercation and reacted unfavorably when he was signed by the Dodgers in 1975. By then, however, Roseboro had forgiven Marichal and personally appealed to fans to do the same.

====Later career====
The Dodgers went on to win the 1965 National League Pennant by two games over the Giants. Even though the Giants won the two games against the Dodgers during which Marichal had been suspended, the outcome of the season may have been different without the Giants&#x27; pitcher&#x27;s suspension, as he finished the season with a 22-13 win-loss record.

Roseboro once again guided the Dodgers&#x27; pitching staff to a league-leading 2.81 earned run average. He caught for two twenty-game winners in 1965 with Koufax winning 26 games, while Don Drysdale won 23 games. In the 1965 World Series against the Minnesota Twins, Roseboro contributed 6 hits including a two-run single to win Game 3 of the series as the Dodgers went on to win the world championship in seven games.

The Dodgers&#x27; pitching staff continued to lead the league in earned-run averages in 1966 as they battled with the San Francisco Giants and the Pittsburgh Pirates in a tight pennant race. The Dodgers eventually prevailed to win the National League pennant for a second consecutive year. Roseboro led the league with a career-high 903 putouts and finished second to Joe Torre in fielding percentage to win his second Gold Glove Award. The Dodgers would eventually lose the 1966 World Series, getting swept in four games by the Baltimore Orioles.

The following season, after the Dodgers fell to 8th place, Roseboro, Ron Perranoski and Bob Miller were acquired by the Minnesota Twins, which needed a veteran catcher and left-handed reliever, in exchange for Mudcat Grant and Zoilo Versalles on November 28, 1967. While with the Twins, he would be named to his fourth and final All-Star team when he was named as a reserve for the American League in the 1969 All-Star Game.

After the season, Roseboro was released by the Twins. He signed as a free agent with the Washington Senators on December 31, 1969, but appeared in only 46 games for the last place Senators. He played in his final major league game on August 11, 1970 at the age of 37.

===Career overall===
In a 14-year major league career, Roseboro played in 1,585 games, accumulating 1,206 hits in 4,847 at bats for a .249 career batting average and an on-base percentage of .326, along with 104 home runs and 548 runs batted in. He had a .989 career fielding percentage as a catcher.

Roseboro caught 112 shutouts during his career, 19th all-time amongst major league catchers. He was the catcher for two of Sandy Koufax&#x27;s four career no-hitters and caught more than 100 games in 11 of his 14 major league seasons. Baseball historian and sabermetrician Bill James ranked Roseboro 27th all-time among major league catchers.

==Television appearances==
Like many Dodgers in the 1960s, Roseboro did some film and television work. He appeared as a plainclothes officer in the 1966 made-for-television film &quot;Dragnet&quot;. He also appeared as himself in the 1962 film &quot;Experiment in Terror&quot;, along with teammates Don Drysdale and Wally Moon, and in the 1963 episode of the show &quot;Mister Ed&quot; called &quot;Leo Durocher Meets Mister Ed.&quot;

In the mid-1960s, Chevrolet was one of the sponsors of the Dodgers&#x27; radio coverage. When the Los Angeles Dodgers broadcast games on television, Chevrolet commercials were aired in which Roseboro and Drysdale sang the song &quot;See The U.S.A. In Your Chevrolet&quot;, made famous by Dinah Shore in the 1950s. Upon seeing the commercials, Dodgers&#x27; announcer Jerry Doggett joked that Roseboro&#x27;s and Drysdale&#x27;s singing career &quot;was destined to go absolutely nowhere.&quot;

==Post-baseball career==
After completing his playing career with Washington, Roseboro coached for the Senators (1971) and California Angels (1972–74). Later, he served as a minor league batting instructor (1977) and catching instructor (1987) for the Dodgers. Roseboro and his second wife, Barbara Fouch-Roseboro, also owned a Beverly Hills public relations firm.

In 1978, Roseboro wrote his memoir with writer Bill Libby, titled &quot;Glory Days with the Dodgers, and Other Days with Others&quot;. In it, he was very direct with his criticism of the baseball establishment and his own shortcomings, as well as those of his teammates, including his one-time roommate and close friend Maury Wills. The book also caused tensions between him and Dodgers owner Walter O&#x27;Malley who was reportedly upset by the book; as a result, the Dodgers did not renew Roseboro&#x27;s contract the following year.

=== Relationship with Marichal ===
After several years of bitterness over their famous altercation, Roseboro and Marichal became friends in the 1980s. Roseboro personally appealed to the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America not to hold the incident against Marichal after he was passed over for election to the Hall of Fame in his first two years of eligibility. Marichal was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1983, and thanked Roseboro during his induction speech. Roseboro later stated: &quot;There were no hard feelings on my part and I thought if that was made public, people would believe that this was really over with. So I saw him at a Dodger old-timers&#x27; game, and we posed for pictures together, and I actually visited him in the Dominican. The next year, he was in the Hall of Fame. Hey, over the years, you learn to forget things.&quot;

When Roseboro died, Marichal served as an honorary pallbearer at his funeral. &quot;Johnny&#x27;s forgiving me was one of the best things that happened in my life,&quot; he said, at the service. &quot;I wish I could have had John Roseboro as my catcher.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1956, Roseboro married Geraldine &quot;Jeri&quot; Fraime. She was a student at Ohio State University and they were introduced to each other by Roseboro&#x27;s brother Jim. The couple had two daughters, Shelley and Stacy, and adopted a son named Jaime.

After his marriage with Jeri broke down, Roseboro went through financial hardships and contemplated suicide as a result. During this time, he began a relationship with Barbara Walker Fouch whom he credited with saving his life. Roseboro and Fouch married soon afterwards. He also became a father figure to Barbara&#x27;s daughter from her first marriage, Nikki.

Later in life, Roseboro&#x27;s health began to fail and he suffered from several strokes, heart ailments, and a bout of prostate cancer. He succumbed to heart disease on August 16, 2002, in Los Angeles, California at age 69.

<doc id="1212984" wikidata="Q7493390" url="?curid=1212984" title="Shelby GLH-S">
<text>The Shelby GLH-S is a limited production series of sport compact automobiles from the mid-1980s based on the Dodge Omni and modified by Shelby American. Later the name would also be applied to a Shelby modified version of the Dodge Shelby Charger. The GLH-S models all used intercooled turbocharged 4-cylinder engines.

== 1986 ==

The 1986 Shelby Omni GLH-S was a modified Dodge Omni GLH, with changes made at the Shelby factory. They were retitled as Shelby Automobiles cars sold at select Dodge dealerships. GLH stood for &quot;Goes Like Hell&quot; and GLH-S stood for &quot;Goes Like Hell S&#x27;more.&quot;

Just 500 were made. Dash plaques using a three-digit serial numbering system were installed.
The Turbo I engine was modified with pre-production pieces from what would become the Turbo II inline-four engine. These changes included an intercooler, plus other changes to produce at 5300 rpm and a flat 175 ft·lbf (237 N·m) torque curve. Not included were any of the durability changes to the short block (forged crank, full floating pin, stouter connecting rods, etc.) of the 1987 Chrysler Turbo II engine. Luckily, the Shelby engines have proved to be reliable even without the durability enhancements of the production Turbo II. The GLH-S had a 0–60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration time of 6.5 seconds and a 14.8 second quarter mile (402 m) time. Top speed was 135 mph (217 km/h).

==1987==

The 1987 Charger GLH-S was based on the 1987 Shelby Charger. Shelby Automobiles purchased the last 1,000 Chargers built and they were shipped to the Whittier factory for modification. Shelby modified the Charger using the same pieces as the 1986 GLH-S, with some changes. The differences include a non-EGR turbo, Shelby valve cover, wider &quot;Shelby&quot; windshield decal (no CS logos), different and more extensive tape graphics package, no reference to Dodge on the outer body, black/white speedo overlay, a four-digit serial numbering system on the dash plaque, wider Mobil 1 plaque installed on the radiator support, and Shelby Centurion II wheels.

<doc id="1212990" wikidata="Q2907471" url="?curid=1212990" title="Seven Seas Lagoon">
<text>The Seven Seas Lagoon is an artificial lake at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida, near Orlando. Located south of the Magic Kingdom theme park, the Seven Seas Lagoon serves as a natural buffer between the Magic Kingdom and its parking lot and connects with the adjacent Bay Lake. The lake reaches a depth of . The lagoon is used mainly for recreational boating, as well as by the resort&#x27;s three Disney Transport ferryboats that transport guests between the Magic Kingdom and the Transportation and Ticket Center.

== Uses ==

The Seven Seas Lagoon is used for boating activities at the resort. Fishing was not allowed in the lagoon until the mid-1990s, some 25 years after Walt Disney World&#x27;s opening. However, the plan had existed from the start and fish were set free in the lagoon in 1973. Swimming was originally allowed, but has since been prohibited for safety reasons due to the operation of the rental boats and the existence of a single-cell amoeba &quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot; identified in the water that has been credited with several illnesses and at least one death. The lagoon is also the site of the Electrical Water Pageant. The lagoon, despite being man-made, is home to native Florida species such as alligators, lizards, snakes, and turtles.

==Islands of the Lagoon==
There are three islands on Seven Seas Lagoon: Blackbeard Island, Castaway Cay, and Beachcomber Island.

===Blackbeard Island===
Blackbeard Island is located near the water bridge that connects Seven Seas Lagoon and Bay Lake.

===Castaway Cay===
The island of Castaway Cay is currently used as the launching point for perimeter fireworks within special events and holidays at Magic Kingdom Park. It also shares the name of the Island accessed by Disney Cruise Line in the Bahamas.

===Beachcomber Island===
Previously the site of an artificial wave machine for surfing in the early 1970s. It was later discontinued due to issues such as beach erosion, temperamental technology, cost, and navigational issues for watercraft within the lagoon. The artificial wave machine was more than a decade of being out of service when it was refurbished in 1985. The attempt in 1985 led to more beach erosion and later a permanent shutdown. Remnants of machine are still under the surface of the lagoon, as the cost of removal would have been massive.

==History==

The original c.1966-67 master plan for Walt Disney World never included plans for the Seven Seas Lagoon, Walt Disney had only envisioned an expanded Bay Lake as a large open body of water. What would become the lagoon was originally conceived as home to various themed resorts which were relatively landlocked which would be separated from the Magic Kingdom by golf courses, an ice rink and a rollerskating dome. Original plans showed the monorail terminating in front of the Magic Kingdom entrance on a linear route with three WEDway People Movers lines connecting guests to the various resorts. This would all change after Walt&#x27;s death where major changes were made with the design of WDW. Most likely due to the swampy nature of the land, Bay Lake was expanded and the lagoon created from excess water displaced by the theme park, resorts, parking lots, golf courses. The revised plans would see the monorail circle the lagoon with parking and a transportation center built on the South shore connecting the various resorts.

Seven Seas Lagoon was a project the first phase of Resort Developments for the creation of Walt Disney World Resort. Earth exceeding seven million cubic yards was relocated for the creation of the man-made lagoon. The earth that was moved was used to cover the utilidors of the Magic Kingdom Park.

===The Walt Disney World Water Ski Show===
The Walt Disney World Ski Show was an event held at Seven Seas Lagoon and Bay Lake at Walt Disney World Resort in the 1970s. Shows were held five times daily. The show included eight-person, three-tiered pyramid, an exposition of flex-wing kite flying at 300 feet over the water and a series of jumps over a five and one-half foot ramp. Various characters, such as Dumbo, Goofy, and Pinocchio were in the show.

===2016 alligator attack===

At around 9:15 p.m. on June 14, 2016, a two-year-old boy wading in the Seven Seas Lagoon at the Grand Floridian Resort &amp; Spa was grabbed and mauled to death by an alligator. His parents tried to intervene, but they were unsuccessful. The boy&#x27;s intact body was discovered at the bottom of the lagoon at approximately 1:45 p.m. the following afternoon; he was found near where he went missing 12 to 15 yards (11 to 14 m) from the shore in about 6 feet (1.8 m) of water. The medical examiner ruled that the child died of &quot;drowning and traumatic injuries.&quot; Reuters reported that the resort would put up signs warning guests about alligators and five of them were earlier killed in the search, to examine their stomachs. Shortly after the incident, Disney temporarily removed several references to alligators from various attractions throughout Disney World.

===Terrain adjustments===
After the 2016 alligator attack, the beaches and walkways of the Seven Seas Lagoon received an updated shoreline, which now features sharp, giant rocks and roped-off gates dividing guests from the shoreline of the lagoon. Signs warning guests about the wildlife of the lake were added as well.

==Watercraft==
Disney Transport ferries operating include &quot;Admiral Joe Fowler&quot; (formerly &quot;Magic Kingdom I&quot;), &quot;Richard F. Irvine&quot; (formerly &quot;Magic Kingdom II&quot;) and, since 1976, &quot;General Joe Potter&quot; (formerly &quot;Kingdom Queen&quot;).
Other smaller watercraft also operate. Two steam-powered sidewheelers formerly operated, &quot;Southern Seas&quot; until 1975 and &quot;Ports O&#x27; Call&quot; until 1982. &quot;Southern Seas&quot; was replaced in 1977 by &quot;Southern Seas II&quot;, a slightly larger sidewheeler that was diesel-powered instead of steam-powered, that operated until 1996. All three boats that travel the Seven Seas Lagoon were named after people who were instrumental in the creation of Disneyworld.

== Bordering resorts ==
Three resorts border the Seven Seas Lagoon, all of which have beaches. These hotels are the only hotels on Walt Disney World property that are directly serviced by the Walt Disney World Monorail System, allowing full monorail access from these hotels to the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, and the Transportation and Ticket Center.

<doc id="1212995" wikidata="Q1684076" url="?curid=1212995" title="Jeux d'eau (Ravel)">
<text>Jeux d&#x27;eau () is a piece for solo piano by Maurice Ravel, composed in 1901 and given its first public performance the following year. The title is variously translated as &quot;Fountains&quot;, &quot;Playing Water&quot; or literally &quot;Water Games&quot;. At the time of writing &quot;Jeux d&#x27;eau&quot;, Ravel was a student of Gabriel Fauré, to whom this piece is dedicated. The work is in a single movement, typically lasting between four and half and six minutes in performance. 

&quot;Jeux d&#x27;eau&quot; has a claim to being the first example of impressionism in piano music. The piece is known for its virtuosic, fluid, and highly evocative nature, and is considered one of Ravel&#x27;s most important works for piano. The piece is characterized by its fast, shimmering, and cascading piano figurations, which are meant to evoke the sound of flowing water. The overall atmosphere of &quot;Jeux d&#x27;eau&quot; is one of lightness, playfulness, and sensuousness, and the piece is often described as a musical depiction of the joy and beauty of nature. &quot;Jeux d&#x27;eau&quot; is considered a masterful example of Ravel&#x27;s distinctive style, which is characterized by its clarity, precision, and sensitivity to color and texture.

==Background and first performances==
In 1901 Maurice Ravel was aged 26 and had yet to make an impression on the French musical scene. He had failed to win any prizes as a student at the Paris Conservatoire and was expelled on that account. As a former student he was permitted to attend the classes of his teacher Gabriel Fauré, who thought highly of him and encouraged him. Ravel dedicated &quot;Jeux d&#x27;eau&quot; and his String Quartet &quot;à mon cher maître Gabriel Fauré&quot;.

&quot;Jeux d&#x27;eau&quot; represented what Ravel&#x27;s biographer Gerald Larner calls &quot;a sudden surge in Ravel&#x27;s imagination&quot; after the mostly unremarkable compositions that preceded it. The piece was partly inspired by Franz Liszt&#x27;s &quot;Les jeux d&#x27;eau à la Villa d&#x27;Este&quot; (from his &quot;Années de pèlerinage&quot;). Another inspiration may have been the poem &quot;Fête d&#x27;eaux&quot; by Ravel&#x27;s friend Henri de Régnier. It contains the line &quot;Dieu fluvial riant de l&#x27;eau qui le chatouille&quot; (&quot;river god laughing at the water that tickles him&quot;), which at the composer&#x27;s request the poet inscribed on Ravel&#x27;s manuscript, and is the heading in the printed score.

Ravel gave the first performance of the work at a gathering of the avant-garde artistic group Les Apaches of which he was a member. The pianist Vlado Perlemuter quoted one of those present as saying, &quot;There was a strange fire, a whole panoply of subtleties and vibrations which none of us could previously have imagined&quot;. Perlemuter commented that the piece &quot;opens up new horizons in piano technique, especially if one remembers that Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Jardins sous la pluie&quot; was not written until two years later, in 1903&quot;. The work was published by Eugène Demets in 1901. It was quickly denounced by musical conservatives, including Camille Saint-Saëns − who dismissed it as &quot;total cacophony&quot; − and most of the faculty of the Conservatoire.

The first public performance was given by the pianist Ricardo Viñes in a concert presented by the Société nationale de musique on 5 April 1902, at which Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Pavane pour une infante défunte&quot; was also premiered. Pierre Lalo, the music critic of &quot;Le Temps&quot; (who later became persistently hostile to Ravel) was favourably impressed. After commending Viñes&#x27;s &quot;singular virtuosity and delicacy&quot; he praised the two Ravel works as &quot;orderly, composed with great clarity and measure, while keeping the same refinement in harmony&quot;. He continued:

Ravel&#x27;s biographer Arbie Orenstein comments that among the other critics and the public the &quot;Pavane&quot; was found elegant and charming, but &quot;Jeux d&#x27;eau&quot; was thought to be cacophonic and excessively complicated. &quot;It now appears that the &quot;Pavane&quot; is a minor work, as the composer himself acknowledged, while &quot;Jeux d&#x27;eau&quot; is firmly established as an important landmark in the literature of the piano&quot;.

==Music==

The piece, in E major, is in a single movement. It opens &quot;tres doux&quot; (&quot;very soft&quot;), with a metronome marking of  = 144. The duration of the piece varies considerably in performance, from minutes to more than 6..
Orenstein summarises the structure: &quot;the opening and closing sonorities of &quot;Jeux d&#x27;eau&quot; are the chord of the major seventh, which enjoys a privileged position throughout&quot;. In Orenstein&#x27;s analysis the work is based on two themes, the second of which is pentatonic, &quot;treated quite freely&quot;. After an extensive development section, the two themes return and the work ends in &quot;a sweeping cascade&quot; of hemidemisemiquavers. Ravel makes pronounced use of the higher and lower registers of the keyboard.

<text>Alvin &quot;Al&quot; Mackling (born December 31, 1927) is a longtime Canadian Democratic Socialist and a retired lawyer. He was an alderman in the former city of St. James from 1961 to 1969 and was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1969 to 1973 and from 1981 to 1988. He was a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party governments of Edward Schreyer and Howard Pawley.

==Biography==

===Early life===
The son of John Mackling, he was born in 1927 and educated in St. James. In 1944 he left high school and was employed with Saskatchewan Pool Elevators for five years. In the early 1940s he was smitten by the social gospel of J. S. Woodsworth and Stanley Knowles. He became an active member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Young People&#x27;s Movement, becoming its President. In 1949 he went back to school graduating from United College (now the University of Winnipeg) in 1953. He worked for the Canadian Pacific Railway as a yardman for a year, then entered the Manitoba Law School in 1954, graduating in 1958. During his university years he was actively involved in University Mock Parliament as a member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF).

His first campaign as a candidate for political office was as a CCF candidate in the 1953 provincial election. He ran in the constituency of Assiniboia and was only narrowly defeated by the incumbent MLA, Reg Wightman.

He ran unsuccessfully in several subsequent Provincial elections and once as a Federal CCF candidate in 1957.

In the 1950s Mackling and Howard Pawley were regarded as rebels against the CCF establishment in Manitoba. Both opposed the party&#x27;s decision to dissolve itself into the New Democratic Party. They opposed the new party structure that gave labour unions a separate voting status within the new party.

===Political career===
Mackling was finally elected to the Manitoba Legislative Assembly in the 1969 election. He was named Attorney General of Manitoba on July 16, 1969, and held the position for the Schreyer government&#x27;s first term in office. He also served as Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs from December 18, 1969, to August 1970.

As Attorney General, Mackling sought to develop better police-public cooperation introducing a system of cautions for highway traffic first offences and established a Manitoba Police Commission. He established the first Human Rights Commission, the first Ombudsman&#x27;s Office, the first Law Reform Commission, the first publicly funded Legal Aid system, and the first Criminal Injuries Compensation Program. Under his guidance, numerous old regulatory systems were revised, including the &quot;Expropriation Act&quot; and the &quot;Landlord and Tenant Act&quot;. In revising the &quot;Landlord and Tenant Act&quot;, the old &quot;right of restraint&quot;—whereby landlords could seize a tenant&#x27;s furniture—was abolished and replaced by security deposits and a Rentalsman&#x27;s Office was created to adjudicate tenancy disputes.

There was one issue in Mackling&#x27;s tenure as Attorney General that was quite controversial. He was regarded as unnecessarily dogmatic by some members of the NDP Caucus and by some civil libertarians for shutting down a theatre which was screening the film Last Tango in Paris without consulting other government ministers. His position was that as Attorney General he could not and would not allow possible political repercussions to influence law enforcement. The &quot;Criminal Code&quot; defined a combination of violence with a sexual act as obscene and since a violent sexual act was depicted in the movie, it was obscene.

He was defeated in the 1973 provincial election. His St. James constituents were angry that he had supported legislation passed by his government that eliminated the City of St. James and merged it with the City of Winnipeg. St. James had been a very prosperous and successful city and his constituents vented their displeasure on him.

After his defeat in 1973 he returned to legal practice but was persuaded in 1974 to take on chairmanship of the Manitoba Transport Board and the Manitoba Highways Board. During his highly successful tenure as Chairman of the Transport Board he became Chairman of a Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrators (CCMTA) committee where he worked to harmonize motor transport regulations.

In 1981 his friend and former colleague, Howard Pawley, persuaded him to run in the upcoming election. He won and defeated George Minaker, a Progressive Conservative government minister who had defeated him in 1973.

In 1982 he was appointed Minister of Natural Resources. During his tenure he successfully led the establishment of provincial park planning including the designation of part of the Whiteshell Provincial Park as a wilderness area, the establishment of Atikaki as a wilderness park, the establishment of the first forestry practices guidelines, the restoration of freshwater fish migration through fish ladders and the removal of unnecessary dams and culverts.

In 1985 following the death of then Labour Minister Mary Beth Dolin, Mackling was appointed Minister of Labour with responsibility for the Manitoba Telephone System Act, the &quot;Civil Service Act&quot;, the &quot;Civil Service Superannuation Act&quot;, the &quot;Civil Service Supplementary Severance Benefit Act&quot;, and the &quot;Public Servants&#x27; Insurance Act&quot;. He was reelected in the 1986 election against a challenge from a popular Progressive Conservative, Eldon Ross.

On April 17, 1986, he continued as Minister of Labour and as Minister Responsible for the Manitoba Telephone System and also took on the Ministry of Consumer and Corporate Affairs.

The NDP government was unexpectedly defeated in the Legislature in early 1988 as a result of the defection of Jim Walding, a disgruntled caucus member. Mackling decided not to contest the 1988 election and has not returned to provincial political life since that time.

Mackling was the NDP candidate in the federal riding of Provencher during the 2011 federal election. He came second behind Conservative candidate Vic Toews, capturing about 18% of the popular vote.

===Personal===

He and his wife Patricia Taeko Ono were married in 1956. Patricia&#x27;s mother, Lucille Ono, was a devoted supporter of the CCF and NDP. In her honour the Manitoba New Democratic Party presents an annual award to a member of the Party in recognition of his or her dedicated support.

<text>Culpeper Regional Airport is a county-owned public-use airport located seven nautical miles (13 km) northeast of Culpeper, a town in Culpeper County, Virginia, United States. Located in Brandy Station, Virginia, the airport opened in 1968. The runway originally measured 3200 ft. by 75 ft. In 1983, the runway was lengthened to 4000 ft. In 2004, the runway was expanded to 5000 ft. by 100 ft. It can handle corporate-size jets and large twin-engine aircraft. The airport has an airfest every October since 1998, with performances such as aerobatics.

== Brandy Station Battlefield ==

The airport is located within the core battlefield of Brandy Station, as defined by the American Battlefield Protection Program. It was the site of the largest cavalry battle in the western hemisphere. In the first phase of the Battle of Brandy Station, Confederate artillery was set up in a line, the east end of which was on the current site of the airport. Union cavalry charged on their position, but was repulsed, and the fighting went on further to the north.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Culpeper Regional Airport covers an area of at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one asphalt-paved runway designated 4/22 which measures 5,000 by 100 feet (1,524 × 30 m).

For the 12-month period ending August 31, 2012, the airport had 66,067 aircraft operations, an average of 181 per day: 94% general aviation, 5% military and 1% air taxi. At that time there were 114 aircraft based at this airport: 90% single-engine, 4% multi-engine, 3% helicopter and 3% ultralight.

<doc id="1213025" wikidata="Q1821843" url="?curid=1213025" title="Battle of Fort Pillow">
<text>The Battle of Fort Pillow, also known as the Fort Pillow Massacre, was fought on April 12, 1864, at Fort Pillow on the Mississippi River in Henning, Tennessee, during the American Civil War. The battle ended with Confederate soldiers commanded by Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest massacring Union soldiers (many of them U.S. Colored Troops) attempting to surrender. Military historian David J. Eicher concluded: &quot;Fort Pillow marked one of the bleakest, saddest events of American military history.&quot;

==Background==
The United States&#x27;s deployment of the United States Colored Troops combined with Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation profoundly angered the Confederacy, who called it &quot;uncivilized&quot;. In response, the Confederacy in May 1863 passed a law stating that black U.S. soldiers captured while fighting against the Confederacy would be turned over to the state, where the captured would be tried, according to state laws.

Fort Pillow was built in early 1862 by Gideon Johnson Pillow, a Confederate Brigadier General, on the Mississippi River north of Memphis and was used by both sides during the war. With the fall of New Madrid and Island No. 10 to U.S. Army forces, Confederate troops evacuated Fort Pillow on June 4 to avoid being cut off from the rest of the Confederate army. U.S. Army forces occupied Fort Pillow on June 6 and used it to protect the river approach to Memphis.

The fort stood on a high bluff and was protected by three lines of entrenchments arranged in a semicircle, with a protective parapet thick and high surrounded by a ditch. (During the battle, this design was a disadvantage to the defenders because they could not fire upon approaching troops without mounting the top of the parapet, which subjected them to enemy fire. Because of the width of the parapet, operators of the six artillery pieces of the fort found it difficult to depress their barrels enough to fire on the attackers once they got close.) A U.S. Navy gunboat, the USS &quot;New Era&quot;, commanded by Captain James Marshall, was also available for the defense.

On March 16, 1864, Confederate Major General Nathan Bedford Forrest launched a month-long cavalry raid with 7,000 troopers into West Tennessee and Kentucky. Their objectives were to capture U.S. prisoners and supplies and to demolish posts and fortifications from Paducah, Kentucky, south to Memphis. Forrest&#x27;s Cavalry Corps, which he called &quot;the Cavalry Department of West Tennessee and North Mississippi&quot;, consisted of the divisions led by Brig. Gens. James R. Chalmers (brigades of Brig. Gen. Robert V. Richardson and Colonel Robert M. McCulloch) and General Abe Buford (brigades of Cols. Tyree H. Bell and A. P. Thompson).

The first of the two significant engagements in the expedition was the Battle of Paducah on March 25, where Forrest&#x27;s men did considerable damage to the town and its military supplies. Forrest had tried to bluff U.S. Col. Stephen G. Hicks into surrender, warning, &quot;If I have to storm your works, you may expect no quarter&quot;. Hicks rejected the demand, as he knew that the fort could not be easily taken.

Numerous skirmishes occurred throughout the region in late March and early April. Needing supplies, Forrest planned to move on Fort Pillow with about 1,500 to 2,500 men. (He had detached part of his command under Buford to strike Paducah again.) He wrote on April 4, &quot;There is a Federal force of 500 or 600 at Fort Pillow, which I shall attend to in a day or two, as they have horses and supplies which we need.&quot;

The U.S. Army garrison at Fort Pillow consisted of about 600 men, divided almost evenly between black and white troops. The black soldiers belonged to the 6th U.S. Regiment Colored Heavy Artillery and a section of the 2nd Colored Light Artillery (previously known as the Memphis Battery Light Artillery (African Descent)), under the overall command of Major Lionel F. Booth, who had been in the fort for only two weeks. Booth had been ordered to move his regiment from Memphis to Fort Pillow on March 28 to augment the cavalry, who had occupied the fort several weeks earlier. Many of the regiment were formerly enslaved people who understood the personal cost of a loss to the Confederates—at best, an immediate return to slavery rather than being treated as a prisoner of war. They had heard that some Confederates threatened to kill any black U.S. Army troops they encountered. The white soldiers were predominantly recruits from Bradford&#x27;s Battalion, a U.S. Army unit from west Tennessee commanded by Maj. William F. Bradford.

==Battle==
Forrest arrived at Fort Pillow at 10:00 on April 12. By this time, Chalmers had already surrounded the fort. A stray bullet struck Forrest&#x27;s horse, felling the general and bruising him. This was the first of three horses he lost that day. He deployed sharpshooters around the higher ground that overlooked the fort, bringing many occupants into their direct line of fire. A sharpshooter&#x27;s bullet to the chest killed Major Booth, and Bradford assumed command. By 11:00, the Confederates had captured two rows of barracks about from the southern end of the fort. The U.S. Army soldiers had failed to destroy these buildings before the Confederates occupied them, and they subjected the garrison to a murderous fire.

Rifle and artillery fire continued until 3:30 when Forrest sent a note demanding surrender: &quot;The conduct of the officers and men garrisoning Fort Pillow has been such as to entitle them to being treated as prisoners of war. I demand the unconditional surrender of the entire garrison, promising that you shall be treated as prisoners of war. My men have just received a fresh supply of ammunition, and from their present position can easily assault and capture the fort. Should my demand be refused, I cannot be responsible for the fate of your command.&quot; Bradford replied, concealing his identity as he did not wish the Confederates to realize that Booth had been killed, requesting an hour for consideration. Forrest, who believed that reinforcing troops would soon arrive by a river, replied that he would only allow 20 minutes, and that &quot;If at the expiration of that time the fort is not surrendered, I shall assault it.&quot; Bradford refused this opportunity with a final reply: &quot;I will not surrender.&quot; Forrest then ordered his bugler to sound the charge.

The Confederate assault was furious. While the sharpshooters maintained their fire into the fort, the first wave entered the ditch and stood while the second wave used their backs as stepping stones. These men then reached down and helped the first wave scramble up a ledge on the embankment. This proceeded flawlessly and with very little firing, except for the sharpshooters and around the flanks. Their fire against the &quot;New Era&quot; caused the sailors to button up their gun ports and hold their fire. As the sharpshooters were signaled to hold their fire, the men on the ledge went up and over the embankment, firing now for the first time into the massed defenders. The garrison fought briefly but then broke and ran to the landing at the foot of the bluff, where they had been told that the U.S. Navy gunboat would cover their withdrawal by firing grapeshot and canister rounds. Because its gun ports remained sealed, the gunboat did not fire a single shot. The fleeing soldiers were subjected to fire from the rear and flank. Many were shot down. Others reached the river only to drown or be picked off in the water by sharpshooters on the bluff.

==Massacre==
Although Confederate sources say that Forrest&#x27;s forces kept firing in self-defense, official U.S. reports emphasize that a deliberate massacre occurred. U.S. Army survivors said that even though all their troops surrendered, Forrest&#x27;s men massacred some in cold blood. Surviving members of the garrison said that most of their men surrendered and threw down their arms, only to be shot or bayoneted by the attackers, who repeatedly shouted, &quot;No quarter! No quarter!&quot;

It was reported that women and children were killed, but this was disputed by Dr. C. Fitch, who was a surgeon of the Fort Pillow garrison: &quot;Early in the morning all of the women and all of the noncombatants were ordered on to some barges, and were towed by a gunboat up the river to an island before any one was hurt.&quot; The testimony of Captain Marshall supports this. He stated that all the women, children, and sick soldiers were removed to an island before the battle started. The strongest evidence that the Confederates did not kill the women and children is that no one reported seeing the bodies of women and children among the slain.

The Joint Committee On the Conduct of the War immediately investigated the incident, which was widely publicized in the U.S. press. Stories appeared April 16 in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;New York Herald&quot;, &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;Cincinnati Gazette&quot;, and &quot;St. Louis Missouri Democrat&quot;, based on telegraph reports from Cairo, Illinois, where the steamer &quot;Platte Valley&quot;, carrying survivors, had called so that they could be taken to a hospital at nearby Mound City, Illinois, and those that had expired on the ship could be buried. In their report, from which the previous quotes were taken, they concluded that the Confederates shot most of the garrison after it had surrendered.

A letter from one of Forrest&#x27;s sergeants, Achilles V. Clark, writing to his sisters on April 14, reads in part:

A 2002 study by Albert Castel concluded that Forrest&#x27;s troops had killed a large number of the garrison &quot;after they had either ceased resisting or were incapable of resistance&quot;. Historian Andrew Ward in 2005 concluded that an atrocity in the modern sense occurred at Fort Pillow, but that the event was not premeditated nor officially sanctioned by Confederate commanders.

Recent histories concur that a massacre occurred. Historian Richard Fuchs, the author of &quot;An Unerring Fire&quot;, concludes, &quot;The affair at Fort Pillow was simply an orgy of death, a mass lynching to satisfy the basest of conduct—intentional murder—for the vilest of reasons—racism and personal enmity.&quot; Ward states, &quot;Whether the massacre was premeditated or spontaneous does not address the more fundamental question of whether a massacre took place ... it certainly did, in every dictionary sense of the word.&quot; John Cimprich states, &quot;The new paradigm in social attitudes and the fuller use of available evidence has favored a massacre interpretation. ... Debate over the memory of this incident formed a part of sectional and racial conflicts for many years after the war, but the reinterpretation of the event during the last thirty years offers some hope that society can move beyond past intolerance.&quot;

Lieutenant Daniel Van Horn of the 6th U.S. Heavy Artillery (Colored) stated in his official report, &quot;There never was a surrender of the fort, both officers and men declaring they never would surrender or ask for quarter.&quot; Another unit officer, however, and the only surviving officers of Bradford&#x27;s Battalion, attested to the characterization that unarmed soldiers were killed in the act of surrendering.

Forrest&#x27;s men insisted that the U.S. soldiers, although fleeing, kept their weapons and frequently turned to shoot, forcing the Confederates to keep firing in self-defense. Their claim is consistent with the discovery of numerous U.S. Army rifles on the bluffs near the river. The U.S. flag was still flying over the fort, which indicated that the force had not formally surrendered. A contemporary newspaper account from Jackson, Tennessee, states that &quot;General Forrest begged them to surrender&quot;, but &quot;not the first sign of surrender was ever given&quot;. Similar accounts were reported in both Southern and Northern newspapers at the time.

Historian Allan Nevins wrote that although the interpretation of the facts had &quot;provoked some disputation&quot;:

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on April 24:

Forrest&#x27;s dispatch stated: 

General Ulysses S. Grant quoted Forrest&#x27;s dispatch in his &quot;Personal Memoirs&quot; and commented: &quot;Subsequently, Forrest made a report in which he left out the part which shocks humanity to read.&quot;

John Fisher, in his book &quot;They Rode with Forrest and Wheeler&quot;, wrote, &quot;Grant refers here to two reports from Forrest to his superior officer, Leonidas Polk: (1) a hasty, exuberant report dated April 15, 1864, dashed off three days after the attack on Fort Pillow, describing the success of Forrest&#x27;s recent operations in West Tennessee, and (2) a well-defined, detailed, and comprehensive report of the action at Fort Pillow &quot;only&quot; dated April 26.&quot;

At the time of the massacre, General Grant was no longer in Tennessee, having transferred to the east to command all U.S. Army troops. Major General William Tecumseh Sherman, Commander of the Military Division of the Mississippi, which included Tennessee, wrote:

==Military aftermath==

Casualty figures vary according to the source. In 1908, Dyer gave the following statistics of U.S. Army casualties: 350 killed and mortally wounded, 60 wounded, 164 captured and missing—574 in the aggregate.

Confederate casualties were comparatively low (14 killed and 86 wounded), and U.S. casualties were high. Of the 585 to 605 U.S. men present, 277 to 297 were reported as dead. Jordan, in the mid-20th century, suggested that U.S. deaths were exaggerated. Historians agree that defenders&#x27; casualties varied considerably according to race. Only 58 (around 20%) black soldiers were taken prisoner, whereas 168 (about 60%) white soldiers were taken prisoner. Not all of the prisoners who were shot were black; Major Bradford was apparently among those shot after surrendering.

The Confederates evacuated Fort Pillow that evening and gained little from the battle except causing a temporary disruption to U.S. Army operations. U.S. forces used the &quot;Fort Pillow massacre&quot; as a rallying cry in the following months. For many, it strengthened their resolve to see the war to its conclusion.

On April 17, 1864, in the aftermath of Fort Pillow, General Grant ordered General Benjamin F. Butler, who was negotiating prisoner exchanges with the Confederacy, to demand that black soldiers be treated identically to whites in the exchange and treatment of prisoners. He directed that a failure to do so would &quot;be regarded as a refusal on their part to agree to the further exchange of prisoners, and [would] be so treated by us.&quot;

This demand was refused; Confederate Secretary of War James Seddon in June 1864 wrote:

The United States already had established a policy to discourage killing and enslaving prisoners of war. On July 30, 1863, before the massacre, President Abraham Lincoln wrote his Order of Retaliation:

This policy did not lead to any action, but the threat of action led the Confederate army tacitly to treat black U.S. Army soldiers as legitimate soldiers, rather than formerly enslaved people, for the remainder of the war. Nevertheless, the same merciless behavior was exhibited by Southern troops after the Battle of the Crater in July 1864, where surrendering black U.S. soldiers were shot rather than taken prisoner.

==Political aftermath==

On May 3, 1864, Lincoln asked his cabinet for opinions on how the United States should respond to the massacre. Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase recommended for Lincoln to enforce his Order of Retaliation of July 30, 1863. Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles wanted to wait for the congressional committee to obtain more information. Welles expressed concerns in his diary: &quot;There must be something in these terrible reports, but I distrust Congressional committees. They exaggerate.&quot; Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and Attorney General Edward Bates wanted to retaliate. Secretary of the Interior John P. Usher wrote that it was &quot;inexpedient to take any extreme action&quot; and wanted the officers of Forrest&#x27;s command to be held responsible. Postmaster General Montgomery Blair wanted the &quot;actual offenders&quot; given the &quot;most summary punishment when captured&quot;. Blair cited page 445 of the book &quot;International Law; or, Rules Regulating the Intercourse of States in Peace and War&quot;, written by Henry W. Halleck (the U.S. Chief of Staff), as justification for retaliation. Secretary of State William H. Seward wanted the commanding general of the U.S. Army to confront the commanding general of the Confederate army about the allegations.

Welles wrote of the cabinet meeting on May 6:

Lincoln began to respond to Stanton but took no subsequent action because he was &quot;distracted&quot; by other issues. Ultimately, Lincoln chose no action on the issue, as he sadly noted to Frederick Douglass: &quot;if once begun, there was no telling where [retaliation] would end.&quot; Lincoln further stated that only victory would genuinely bring justice, as the perpetrators &quot;can only be effectually reached by a successful prosecution of the war&quot;.

==Legacy==
Fort Pillow, preserved as the Fort Pillow State Historic Park, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1974.

The remains of the killed were moved to Memphis National Cemetery in 1867. One hundred nine of the graves have been identified. As the signage at the Fort Pillow site makes little reference to the black soldiers killed, a wreath-laying ceremony, with color guard and a 21-gun salute, was held on April 12, 2017, at the cemetery to commemorate them.

James Lockett compared the Confederacy&#x27;s policy toward colored U.S. Army troops—&quot;no quarter&quot;—with the lynching and other violence against blacks after the war. In Southern minds, according to this writer, just as formerly enslaved people could not be voters or office-holders, they could not be soldiers either, and thus were not treated, at Fort Pillow and elsewhere, as surrendering soldiers.

==In popular culture==
Numerous novelists have included the Fort Pillow story, including Frank Yerby&#x27;s &quot;The Foxes of Harrow,&quot; James Sherburne&#x27;s &quot;The Way to Fort Pillow&quot;; Allen Ballard, &quot;Where I&#x27;m Bound&quot;; Jesse Hill Ford, &quot;The Raider&quot;; and Charles Gordon Yeager, &quot;Fightin&#x27; with Forest.&quot;
* At the start of chapter 29 of his &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; (1883), Mark Twain mentions passing by &quot;... what was once the formidable Fort Pillow, memorable because of the massacre perpetrated there during the war ... we must bunch Anglo-Saxon history together to find the fellow to the Fort Pillow tragedy.&quot;
* African-American novelist Frank Yerby provided a brief narration of the massacre in his 1946 novel, &quot;The Foxes of Harrow&quot; (chapter XXXVI).
* Perry Lentz&#x27;s novel &quot;The Falling Hills&quot; (1967, paperback 1994) centers on the Fort Pillow Massacre as its main plot element, with the book&#x27;s two protagonists as members of the opposing sides in the battle.
* The film &quot;Last Stand at Saber River&quot; (1997), based on the Elmore Leonard novel of the same name, featured a character (played by Tom Selleck) who was a Confederate soldier at the Fort Pillow massacre. The character returns to his home in the U.S. Southwest, where he describes the events as murder.
* In 1999, Stan Armstrong produced the documentary &quot;The Forgotten Battle of Fort Pillow&quot;. It explores the details of the battle and Confederate General Bedford G. Forrest, who planned and led the attack.
* In the 2004 mockumentary film &quot;C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America&quot;, an analogous alternate history massacre takes place somewhere in the North, following the Confederacy winning the Civil War.
* Harry Turtledove published &quot;Fort Pillow&quot; (2006), a historical novel about the battle and the massacre. His earlier novel, the alternate history &quot;The Guns of the South&quot; (1992), also makes a brief reference to the Fort Pillow massacre, while his fantasy trilogy &quot;War Between the Provinces&quot; (1999–2001) references &quot;Fort Cushion&quot; as the analog.
* In part 4 of the 2016 television miniseries &quot;Roots&quot;, the character Chicken George fights at the Battle of Fort Pillow but manages to escape.
* In &quot;&quot; by Colombian doctor, anthropologist, and writer Manuel Zapata Olivella, the battle of Fort Pillow is described in the first person by one of its combatants.

<text>Thomas Holloway (22 September 180026 December 1883) was an English businessman and philanthropist.

==Early life==
Holloway was born in Devonport, Plymouth, Devon, the eldest son of Thomas and Mary Holloway (née Chellew), who at the time of their son&#x27;s birth had a bakery business. They later moved to Penzance, Cornwall, where they ran The Turk&#x27;s Head Inn. In the late 1820s, Holloway went to live in Roubaix, France, for a few years. He returned to England in 1831 and worked in London as a secretary and interpreter for a firm of importers and exporters. In 1836, he set himself up as a foreign and commercial agent in London.

==Business career==
Holloway had business connections with an Italian, Felix Albinolo, who manufactured and sold a general purpose ointment. This gave Holloway the idea to set up a similar business himself in 1837. He began by using his mother&#x27;s pots and pans to manufacture his ointment in the family kitchen. Seeing the potential in patent medicines, Holloway soon added pills to his range of products. Holloway&#x27;s business was extremely successful. A key factor in his enormous success in business was advertising, in which Holloway had great faith. Holloway&#x27;s first newspaper announcements appeared in 1837, and by 1842 his yearly expenses for publicity had reached over £5,000 (GBP). By the time of his death, he was spending over £50,000 a year on advertising his products. The sales of his products made Holloway a multi-millionaire, and one of the richest men in Britain at the time. Holloway&#x27;s products were said to be able to cure a whole host of ailments, though scientific evaluation of them after his death showed that few of them contained any ingredients which would be considered to be of significant medicinal value. Holloway&#x27;s medicine business slowly declined and was bought by rival Beecham&#x27;s Pills in 1930.

==Philanthropy==
Holloway is remembered for the two large institutions which he built in England: Holloway Sanatorium in Virginia Water, Surrey, and Royal Holloway College, a college of the University of London in Englefield Green, Surrey. Both were designed by the architect William Henry Crossland, and were inspired by the Cloth Hall in Ypres, Belgium, and the Château de Chambord in the Loire Valley, France. They were founded by Holloway as &quot;Gifts to the nation&quot;.

Holloway claimed that it was his wife, Jane Holloway, who inspired him to found the college, which was a women-only college and did not accept male undergraduates until 1965, although postgraduates were accepted in 1945. Holloway also paid over £80,000 to acquire 77 Victorian era paintings which he donated to the college at the time of its founding. Most of these pieces of art still belong to the college, and remain on display today in the college&#x27;s Picture Gallery. Three of the paintings, by Turner, Constable and Gainsborough were sold in the 1990s.

==Tittenhurst Park==
Holloway had become extremely wealthy by the late 1860s and bought a Georgian House at Sunninghill, near Ascot, Berkshire called Tittenhurst Park. Holloway lived there with his wife, Jane. Her sister, Sarah Anne Driver, also lived there with her husband George Martin, as did Holloway&#x27;s sister Matilda, an invalid who died soon after. Jane died in 1875, aged 61; Holloway died there on 26 December 1883, aged 83.

A century later, from 1969 to 1971, the building became the home of John Lennon with his then new wife Yoko Ono, having been married on 20 March 1969 in Gibraltar. Another member of the Beatles, Ringo Starr, lived there after Lennon until the late-1980s. In 1988, the property was sold to Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates and ruler of Abu Dhabi. Since then major renovation of the manor has been carried out, and the interior no longer resembles the house lived in by Lennon and Starr.

==Death==

A philanthropic and somewhat eccentric donor (he had an unconcealed prejudice against doctors, lawyers and parsons), Holloway died of congestion of the lungs at Sunninghill in 1883, eighteen months before the opening of the Holloway Sanatorium. He is buried with his wife Jane in a family grave at Sunninghill churchyard. A display about his life was unveiled at the church in October 2014 by Royal Holloway&#x27;s Principal, Professor Paul Layzell.

<doc id="1213038" wikidata="Q3395345" url="?curid=1213038" title="John Wojtowicz">
<text>John Stanley Joseph Wojtowicz (, ; March 9, 1945January 2, 2006) was an American bank robber whose story inspired the film &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;.

==Early life==
Wojtowicz was the son of a Polish father and an Italian-American mother, Terry Basso.

==Personal life==
Wojtowicz married Carmen Bifulco in 1967. They had two children and separated in 1969.

In 1971, Wojtowicz met transgender woman Elizabeth Eden at the Feast of San Gennaro in New York City. The two had a public wedding ceremony that year.

Wojtowicz was at some point a member of the Gay Activists Alliance. He used at that time the alias &quot;Littlejohn Basso&quot;, Basso being his mother&#x27;s maiden name.

==Bank robbery==
On August 22, 1972, Wojtowicz, along with Salvatore Naturile and Robert Westenberg, attempted to rob a branch of the Chase Manhattan Bank at 450 Avenue P in Gravesend, Brooklyn. Westenberg fled the scene before the robbery got underway after he saw a police car on the street. Rather than quickly obtaining the money and fleeing as planned, Wojtowicz and Naturile ended up holding seven Chase Manhattan bank employees hostage for fourteen hours. Wojtowicz, a former bank teller, had some knowledge of bank operations.

Naturile was killed by an agent of the FBI during the final moments of the incident. Wojtowicz was arrested.

An article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that the heist was meant to pay for Eden&#x27;s sex-change (male-to-female). However, reporter Arthur Bell, a veteran &quot;The Village Voice&quot; columnist who knew Wojtowicz, and was tangentially involved in the hostage negotiations, reported that paying for Eden&#x27;s surgery was only peripheral to the real motive. The attempted heist was, Bell stated, a Mafia operation that went horribly wrong.

==Aftermath==
According to Wojtowicz, he was offered a deal for pleading guilty, which the court did not honor. On April 23, 1973, he was sentenced to 20 years in Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary, of which he served five.

Wojtowicz was released from prison on April 10, 1978. He was arrested again and served two more prison sentences for parole violations in 1984 and from 1986–87. He was released in April 1987. Eden visited Wojtowicz in New York about once a month.

Eden, who married and divorced during the time Wojtowicz was imprisoned, died of AIDS-related pneumonia at Genesee Hospital, in Rochester, New York, on September 29, 1987. Wojtowicz attended her funeral and delivered a eulogy.

===&quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;===

Wojtowicz&#x27;s story was used as the basis for the film &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;, released in 1975, starring Al Pacino as Wojtowicz (called &quot;Sonny Wortzik&quot; in the film) and John Cazale, one of Pacino&#x27;s co-stars in &quot;The Godfather&quot;, as Naturile. Elizabeth Eden, known as &quot;Leon&quot; in the film, was portrayed by actor Chris Sarandon.

In 1975, Wojtowicz wrote a letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot; out of concern that people would believe the movie version of the events, which he said was only 30% accurate. Wojtowicz&#x27;s main objection was the inaccurate portrayal of his wife Carmen Bifulco as a plain, overweight woman whose behavior led to his relationship with Eden when, in fact, he had left Bifulco two years before he met Eden.

Other concerns he had that were fictionalized in the movie were that he never spoke to his mother and that the police refused to let him speak to his wife Carmen. In addition, the movie insinuated that Wojtowicz had &quot;sold out&quot; Naturile to the police, and although Wojtowicz claimed this was untrue, several attempts were made on his life following an inmate screening of the movie.

Wojtowicz praised Pacino&#x27;s and Sarandon&#x27;s characterizations of himself and Elizabeth Eden as accurate. In a 2006 interview, the movie&#x27;s screenwriter, Frank Pierson, said that he tried to visit Wojtowicz in prison many times to get more details about his story when he wrote the screenplay, but Wojtowicz refused to see him because he felt he was not paid enough money for the rights to his story. Either way, the film was very successful, receiving good reviews and won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay at the 1975 ceremony.

==Later years and death==
In 2001, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Wojtowicz was living on welfare in Brooklyn. He died of cancer on January 2, 2006, at his mother&#x27;s home, aged 60.

==Documentaries==
Wojtowicz was the subject of multiple documentaries:

*&quot;The Third Memory&quot; (1999), directed by artist Pierre Huyghe and first exhibited in a museum context at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and The Renaissance Society in Chicago, in the format of a two-channel video, took &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; as its starting point. It depicts Wojtowicz recreating the events of the bank robbery with actor look-a-likes and props on a reconstruction of the set of Lumet&#x27;s film. Juxtaposed with footage from &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;, it demonstrates that Wojtowicz&#x27;s memory appears to have been irrevocably altered by the film about his life. For example, he speculated that President Richard Nixon personally ordered the FBI killing of Salvatore, because live news media coverage following the bank robbery that evening was cutting into the network television broadcast of Nixon&#x27;s re-election acceptance speech at the 1972 Republican National Convention, at The Convention Center in Miami Beach.
*&quot;Based on a True Story&quot; (2004)
*&quot;The Dog&quot; (also known as &quot;Storyville: The Great Sex Addict Heist&quot;), by directors Allison Berg and Frank Keraudren, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2013.

<doc id="1213039" wikidata="Q5671733" url="?curid=1213039" title="Harry Primrose, 6th Earl of Rosebery">
<text>Albert Edward Harry Meyer Archibald Primrose, 6th Earl of Rosebery, 2nd Earl of Midlothian, (8 January 1882 – 31 May 1974), styled Lord Dalmeny until 1929, was a British liberal politician who briefly served as Secretary of State for Scotland in 1945. He was the Member of Parliament for Midlothian from 1906 to 1910. He became the Earl of Rosebery and Midlothian in 1929 and was thus a member of the House of Lords until his death.

==Early life==
He was born at Dalmeny House west of Edinburgh on 8 January 1882. His parents were Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, Liberal Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (from 1894 to 1895) and Hannah Primrose, Countess of Rosebery, a member of the Rothschild family. He was the brother of Neil Primrose and the writer Lady Sybil Grant.

He was educated at Eton then undertook military training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

==Career==
Lord Dalmeny was commissioned into the Grenadier Guards as a Second lieutenant 12 February 1902.

During the First World War, he served in France from 1914 to 1917 as Camp Commandant and ADC to General Allenby and subsequently in Palestine as Allenby&#x27;s Military Secretary.

===Cricket career===

As Lord Dalmeny he was a prominent cricketer. He played two first-class matches for Middlesex in 1902. He served as captain of Surrey from 1905 to 1907. He played in 102 first-class matches in all, scoring 3551 runs at an average of 22.47, including two centuries. His highest score was 138 against Leicestershire in 1905, when he added 260 for the sixth wicket in 130 minutes with J. N. Crawford. He was a hitter of notable power and though never consistent he could on occasions &quot;knock the best bowling all over the field&quot;, as when he hit 58 against Nottinghamshire on a difficult wicket at The Oval in 1905. Against Essex in 1906 he scored 52 in 37 minutes in the first innings and 58 not out in 45 minutes in the second.

Rosebery was also a notable race-horse owner. He won The Derby with Blue Peter and Ocean Swell, and won most other classic British flat races, with horses bred at his Mentmore and Crafton Studs.

===Political career===

He commenced his political career by being elected Liberal Member of Parliament for the Scottish seat of Edinburghshire. This was a county, better known by its modern name of Midlothian, which was an area where the Roseberys had long been prominent landowners. Dalmeny was one of almost 400 Liberals returned in the great landslide victory of the 1906 election. He retired from the House of Commons in January 1910. At the time of his death he was the last survivor of the 1906 Liberal MPs.

Rosebery entered the House of Lords on the death of his father in 1929. The same year he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Midlothian, a post he held until 1964.

In 1938 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Hugh Macmillan, Baron Macmillan, Sir Thomas Henry Holland, James Pickering Kendall and James Watt.

In February 1941, during the Second World War, he was appointed Regional Commissioner for Civil Defence in Scotland. When the wartime coalition government broke up in 1945, Winston Churchill formed a caretaker administration to hold office until the 1945 general election. The new government was composed of members of the Conservative Party and the small groups which had allied with it in the National governments in office 1931–1940. Amongst these allies was the National Liberal Party to which Rosebery belonged.

One of the most unexpected appointments Churchill made was to install Rosebery as a member of the Privy Council and Secretary of State for Scotland. Both men had served together in the Liberal Parliamentary Party in the 1906–1910 Parliament. The caretaker Ministry was in office May to July 1945. So brief was his tenure at the Scottish Office that during the Royal Commission on Scottish Affairs (1952-4) he declined to give evidence on the grounds that he did not know what to say. Reputedly, his last words prior to his departing from the Scottish Office were &quot;Well. I didn&#x27;t make a bad job of this, did I? Didn&#x27;t have the time&quot;.

===Later life===
He was created a Knight of the Order of the Thistle (KT) in 1947 by King George VI. Rosebery was President of the National Liberal Party 1945–1957. From 1951 to 1974 he was the president of the influential Scottish conservation organisation the Cockburn Association. He was also appointed Chairman of the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland in 1952.

==Personal life==
In 1909, Harry Primrose married Dorothy Alice Margaret Augusta Grosvenor, daughter of Lord Henry George Grosvenor (a son of the 1st Duke of Westminster) and Dora Mina Erskine-Wemyss. Before their divorce in 1919, they had a son and a daughter:

* Archibald Ronald Primrose, Lord Dalmeny (1910–1931), a 2nd Lieutenant in the General List.
* Lady Helen Dorothy Primrose (1913–1998), who married Major Hon. Hugh Adeane Vivian Smith, son of Vivian Smith, 1st Baron Bicester and Lady Sybil Mary McDonnell (a daughter of the 6th Earl of Antrim), in 1933.

In 1924 Primrose remarried to Dame Eva Isabel Marian Strutt, a daughter of Henry Bruce, 2nd Baron Aberdare. They were the parents of two children, only one of whom survived:

* Neil Archibald Primrose, 7th Earl of Rosebery (1929–2024), who married Alison Mary Deirdre Reid, daughter of Ronald William Reid, in 1955. 
* Lady Mary Primrose (1935–1935), who died at birth.

Lord Rosebery died at Mentmore Towers in Buckinghamshire on 30 May 1974 and was succeeded in his titles by his younger son, Neil.

<doc id="1213051" wikidata="Q418917" url="?curid=1213051" title="Inositol trisphosphate receptor">
<text>Inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) is a membrane glycoprotein complex acting as a Ca2+ channel activated by inositol trisphosphate (InsP3). InsP3R is very diverse among organisms, and is necessary for the control of cellular and physiological processes including cell division, cell proliferation, apoptosis, fertilization, development, behavior, learning and memory. Inositol triphosphate receptor represents a dominant second messenger leading to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular store sites. There is strong evidence suggesting that the InsP3R plays an important role in the conversion of external stimuli to intracellular Ca2+ signals characterized by complex patterns relative to both space and time, such as Ca2+ waves and oscillations.

==Discovery==

The InsP3 receptor was first purified from rat cerebellum by neuroscientists Surachai Supattapone and Solomon Snyder at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

The cDNA of the InsP3 receptor was first cloned in the laboratory of Katsuhiko Mikoshiba. The initial sequencing was reported as an unknown protein enriched in the cerebellum called P400. The large size of this open reading frame indicated a molecular weight similar to the protein purified biochemically, and soon thereafter it was confirmed that the protein p400 was in fact the inositol trisphosphate receptor.

==Distribution==
The receptor has a broad tissue distribution but is especially abundant in the cerebellum. Most of the InsP3Rs are found integrated into the endoplasmic reticulum.

== Structure ==
Several X-ray crystallographic and electron cryomicroscopic (cryo-EM) structures of IP3Rs from mouse, rat, and human have defined the overall architecture of the channel. The 1.2 MDa C4-symmetric assembly consists of an ER-embedded transmembrane domain (TMD) in a domain-swapped 6 transmembrane (6TM) cation channel fold that is capped by a large cytosolic domain (CD). In this manner, IP3Rs share significant homology with the much larger and distantly-related RyRs. The CD contains all known ligand binding sites, including the IP3 binding site, two Ca2+ binding sites, an adenine nucleotide binding site, and a C2H2 Zn2+ finger fold. A comprehensive Ca2+-dependent conformational landscape has been defined by cryo-EM.

<doc id="1213066" wikidata="Q645710" url="?curid=1213066" title="WUSA (TV)">
<text>WUSA (channel 9) is a television station in Washington, D.C., affiliated with CBS. It is the flagship property of Tegna Inc., which is based in suburban McLean, Virginia. WUSA&#x27;s studios and transmitter are at Broadcast House on Wisconsin Avenue in northwest Washington&#x27;s Tenleytown neighborhood. Among CBS affiliates not owned and operated by the network, WUSA is the third-largest by market size (after Gray Television&#x27;s WANF in Atlanta and Tegna&#x27;s KHOU in Houston).

The station&#x27;s signal is relayed on a low-power digital translator station, W27EI-D, in Moorefield, West Virginia (which is owned by Valley TV Cooperative). It has a channel-sharing agreement with Silver Spring, Maryland–licensed WJAL (channel 68, owned by Entravision Communications).

==History==
===Early years (1949–1978)===
The station first went on the air on January 11, 1949, as WOIC. It began full-time operations on January 16. The fourth-oldest station in the nation&#x27;s capital, channel 9 was originally owned by the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, a subsidiary of R. H. Macy and Company. Bamberger also owned WOR-AM-FM in New York City, and was working to put WOR-TV (channel 9, now WWOR-TV in Secaucus, New Jersey) on the air at the same time. Nine days later, WOIC broadcast the first televised American presidential inaugural address, given by President Harry S. Truman. WOIC picked up the CBS affiliation upon signing on, replacing WMAL-TV (channel 7, now WJLA-TV) as the network&#x27;s Washington outlet. WOIC/WTOP/WUSA has been a CBS affiliate since its inception, and is currently the network&#x27;s longest-tenured affiliate. However, WOR was a shareholder in the Mutual Radio Network, which had plans to enter television. Plans for the proposed Mutual-branded network advanced far enough that, at the annual meeting of Mutual stockholders in April 1950, network president Frank White made an official announcement of the planned creation of a limited five-station Mutual network (Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., Chicago, &amp; Los Angeles). At that same time Mutual radio station KQV in Pittsburgh, which was engaged in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to get a television license, was reportedly hoping for their station to be a Mutual television affiliate. &quot;Mutual Television Network&quot; ended up being the decided-on branding for the Mutual-branded network. However, the 5-station Mutual network failed in short time. Also, at the start of 1950, Bamberger Broadcasting changed its name to General Teleradio.

In June 1950, a joint venture of CBS and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; purchased WOIC from Bamberger/Macy&#x27;s for $1.4 million. The new owners, WTOP Incorporated (the &quot;Post&quot; owned 55%, with CBS holding the remaining 45% stake), changed the station&#x27;s call sign to WTOP-TV, after its new sister station WTOP radio (then at 1500 AM). In July 1950, WTOP-TV became the first television station in Washington authorized to broadcast color television in the 405-line field sequential color standard, which was incompatible with the black-and-white 525-line NTSC standard. Color broadcasts continued for nearly 30 months, when regulatory and commercial pressures forced the FCC to rescind its original color standard and begin the process of adopting the 525-line NTSC-3 standard, developed by RCA to be backwards compatible with the existing black-and-white televisions.

In 1954, the WTOP stations moved into a new facility, known as &quot;Broadcast House&quot;, at 40th and Brandywine Streets NW in Washington. The building was the first in the country designed as a unified radio and television facility. Its name was in honor of Broadcasting House, home of the BBC in London. The building was well known to WTOP&#x27;s president, since he had spent much of World War II assigned to the BBC. Previous to the move to Broadcast House, the radio stations operated out of the Earle Building (now the Warner Building, home of the Warner Theatre), and WTOP-TV had operated out of the small WOIC studios at the same location. When Broadcast House was completed and the new television studios were inaugurated, the old studio became the garage for Broadcast House and the old master control room became both the master control and transmitter room for channel 9, since Broadcast House had been built around the station&#x27;s original, four-sided tower. The building with the tower remains in the middle at the same location, although it is now an office building and retail store front.

The WTOP-TV tower was known in Washington for two things. First, at Christmas time, the tower was strung with Christmas lights and glowed brightly on top of Mount Reno, the tallest point in the District of Columbia. Second, the tower tended to sway much more than three-sided towers. In a strong wind, the tower could be seen swaying back-and-forth, and during the winter ice from the tower fell quite often on the streets below.

In October 1954, CBS sold its share of WTOP Inc. to the &quot;Washington Post&quot; to comply with the FCC&#x27;s new seven-station-per-group ownership rule. CBS&#x27;s partial ownership of WTOP radio, KQV radio in Pittsburgh and WCCO radio in Minneapolis exceeded the FCC&#x27;s limit for AM radio stations. CBS opted to sell its share of WTOP, which it had purchased in whole in 1932 before selling controlling interest to the &quot;Post&quot; in 1949.

After the sale closed, the &quot;Post&quot; merged the WTOP stations with its other broadcast property, WMBR-AM-TV in Jacksonville, Florida, and changed the name of the licensee from &quot;WTOP Inc.&quot; to &quot;Post Stations, Inc.&quot; WMBR radio was sold off in 1958, and WMBR-TV became WJXT. The &quot;Post&quot; renamed its broadcasting group &quot;Post-Newsweek Stations&quot; in 1961 after the &quot;Post&quot; bought &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine. Post-Newsweek acquired its third television station, WLBW-TV (now WPLG) in Miami in 1970 and in 1974 added WTIC-TV (now WFSB) in Hartford, Connecticut, to the group. In 1972, WTOP-TV joined with the Evening Star Broadcasting Company (owned by the &quot;Post&#x27;s&quot; rival, the now-defunct &quot;Washington Star&quot; and licensee of WMAL-TV) to build the Joint Tower, a , three-sided tower across the alley from Broadcast House at 4010 Chesapeake Street NW. Transmission lines were extended from Broadcast House&#x27;s transmitter area to the new tower for both WTOP-TV and WHUR-FM (the former WTOP-FM, which had been donated by Post-Newsweek to Howard University in 1971). The old tower continued to serve as the backup antenna for channel 9 until the station sold Broadcast House in 1996.

In 1974, WTOP and the other Post-Newsweek stations adopted the slogan &quot;The One and Only&quot;. The moniker was part of a trend toward group identification of stations, with each station being &quot;The One and Only Channel (channel number)&quot;. Staff members from the &quot;One and Only&quot; period usually refer to themselves as &quot;the one and onlies&quot; as a source of pride. The slogan was dropped from active use in the late 1990s and has not been used as part of an image campaign since 1996. The slogan no longer appears on-air, but was revived in a sense when channel 9 adopted its slogan in the mid-2000s, &quot;First and Only with Local News in HDTV.&quot;

===Later years (1978–present)===
On June 26, 1978, Post-Newsweek exchanged WTOP-TV with the Evening News Association&#x27;s WWJ-TV (now WDIV-TV) in Detroit. Post-Newsweek parent the Washington Post Company, and the Evening News Association, which published the &quot;Detroit News&quot;, decided to swap their stations for fear that the FCC would force them to sell the stations at unfavorable terms or revoke their very valuable licenses because the FCC at the time was considering forbidding ownership of newspapers and broadcast stations in the same market. As Post-Newsweek retained WTOP radio and FCC rules in effect at the time disallowed two separately-owned stations from sharing the same base call letters, the station changed to WDVM-TV, representing the initials of the areas which it serves: the District of Columbia, Virginia and Maryland.
In 1985, the Gannett Company purchased the Evening News Association. The WUSA callsign had been in use by Gannett&#x27;s station in Minneapolis (previously WTCN-TV) for a year, and Gannett offered it to WDVM&#x27;s management upon taking control of the station. &quot;Post&quot; television columnist John Carmody noted that the &quot;rather clumsy&quot; WDVM callsign was not often used in promotions. Both stations agreed to the swap; the Minneapolis station became KARE on June 11, 1986, while WDVM became WUSA on Independence Day. The WDVM-TV callsign is now in use on an unrelated station in Hagerstown, Maryland.

Carrying over a practice started by the Minneapolis station, the callsign was depicted in print and on logos as &quot;W★USA&quot; during this time. However, the asterisk or star between the &quot;W&quot; and &quot;U&quot; is not part of the call sign. The star was replaced on-air with the CBS Eye Device, which is also not part of the call sign, by 1998 as CBS began to considerably relax their formerly strict branding guidelines for their affiliates, which had not allowed blending the logo into call letters.

WUSA moved to a new Broadcast House at 4100 Wisconsin Avenue NW in January 1992. WTOP-FM had left the old Broadcast House in 1971, but kept its transmitter there. WTOP radio departed in 1978; the &quot;Post&quot; had sold it a year earlier to the Outlet Company. The move to the more modern building was tinged with sadness due to the death from a brain tumor of popular sportscaster Glenn Brenner just days beforehand. In 1998, WUSA launched its website, wusatv9.com, but later removed the &quot;TV&quot; reference in the domain name to become wusa9.com.

In 2001, WUSA made the decision to preempt CBS&#x27; national coverage of the September 11 attacks with its own local coverage. At 9:41 a.m., just four minutes after the impact, WUSA broke into the CBS national coverage anchored by Dan Rather and showed smoke billowing from the Pentagon. National coverage remained available on multiple Viacom-owned cable networks, including MTV and VH1. Their local coverage, like that of other Washington-area affiliates, included reporters on the phone and on camera, eyewitness accounts, and analysis. WUSA continuously stayed on the air, covering the exodus of the District, school closures, and traffic issues until 12:42 p.m. Throughout the rest of the afternoon, WUSA provided local news updates and press conferences, alternating between their local coverage and the national feed. &quot;Washington Post&quot; television critic Tom Shales took issue with this decision, writing that &quot;the city was subjected to a CBS blackout by the local affiliate, Gannett-owned Channel 9. The station chose to view this, incredibly enough, as a local story and reported it initially as if it were a winter snow day and school closings were of the utmost importance.&quot;

Around the first week of October 2012, Gannett entered a dispute against Dish Network regarding compensation fees and Dish&#x27;s AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper digital video recorders. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is having a negative effect on advertising revenues for WUSA. Gannett threatened to pull all of its stations (such as WUSA) should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement. The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.

On June 29, 2015, the Gannett Company split in two, with one side specializing in print media and the other side specializing in broadcast and digital media. WUSA was retained by the latter company, named Tegna.

==Websites==
In July 2007, WUSA launched a second website at DVMmoms.com . The site focused on topics relating to young mothers in the Washington, D.C. area. Gannett also rolled out similar sites targeted at moms in other select markets where it owns a television and/or newspaper properties. In February 2008, WUSA launched a third website at DVMOurTime.com. The site is fronted by noon anchor J. C. Hayward and provides local restaurant and business discounts as well as news and events targeted towards baby boomers.

In 2008, Gannett and the Tribune Company partnered to expand the Metromix brand that has been successful for many years in Chicago at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. WUSA&#x27;s local Metromix.com site launched in July 2008. There are 35 other Gannett and/or Tribune properties that have a Metromix site. In August 2008, Gannett revamped its moms sites, and DVMmoms.com was renamed MomsLikeMe.com. Like the previous versions, the site features topics related to young moms and includes technology from Ripple 6, which was recently acquired by Gannett. There were MomsLikeMe.com sites in 85 other markets throughout the country. MomsLikeMe was phased out in 2012.

In September 2008, WUSA&#x27;s fifth website was launched, called HighSchoolSports.net. The site features, among other things, high school sports rankings, schedules, and scores for high school football, soccer, basketball and baseball games around the United States. The site is also a Gannett-owned property that was launched in many markets throughout the country.

In June 2010, Gannett Broadcasting and DataSphere Technologies announced a partnership to create community-focused websites in 10 of their television station markets. WUSA was one of the first to launch these sites in August 2010. The sites are integrated within the existing website and feature hyperlocal news and user-generated content about area happenings and events. In addition to powering the community websites, DataSphere provides enhanced functionality, including market-leading site search, coupons, a business directory and ad targeting. WUSA created 53 different neighborhood sites in the Metro D.C. area.

==Programming==
WTOP was one of the few CBS stations that declined to carry the popular game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; during the early years of the program&#x27;s run (although Washington, D.C. ABC station WMAL-TV/WJLA-TV (channel 7) did carry &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and some other CBS daytime game shows uncleared by WTOP during the mid-1970s).

From May 2008 until the end of its original run in 2016, WUSA served as the production studio for the program &quot;The McLaughlin Group&quot; which was also broadcast on some select CBS stations (including its New York City owned-and-operated station WCBS-TV) beginning in May 2007 and on some PBS member stations (locally via WETA-TV and WHUT-TV); the show was distributed by WTTW out of Chicago, with the production facilities moved over from NBC owned-and-operated station WRC-TV, where the show had been based since its premiere in 1982.

===Sports programming===
Then-WTOP-TV was the first television partner of the Washington Capitals, signing a three-year contract to broadcast 15 road games per year at the team&#x27;s debut in the 1974–75 NHL season. Warner Wolf commentated for the first season before being replaced by a simulcast of Ron Weber&#x27;s call for WTOP radio. WTOP-TV treated the games as an afterthought and often relegated them to joins-in-progress or tape-delays to late night. Although &quot;Washington Post&quot; beat reporter Robert Fachet called the team&#x27;s state of television affairs &quot;revolting&quot; by the contract&#x27;s end, station management openly stated they received far more complaints about the preempted CBS shows than from Capitals fans. The Capitals moved to WDCA (channel 20) for 1977. The then-Washington Bullets also signed their first television deal with WTOP-TV when they moved to the city in 1973, concurrent with the start of national broadcasts of the league on CBS. The Bullets moved their local games to WDCA as well in 1977. Additionally, the station aired select weekend Washington Nationals games produced by MASN from 2013 until 2017. In 2024, WUSA and the Washington Commanders announced a partnership, with the network holding exclusive rights to broadcast the team&#x27;s non-national preseason games.

===News operation===

WUSA presently broadcasts 40 hours, 35 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 7 hours, 5 minutes each weekday; 2 hours, 5 minutes on Saturday; and 3 hours, 5 minutes on Sunday); in addition, the station produces a sports highlight program called &quot;Game On!&quot;, which airs Sunday evenings after the 11 p.m. newscast. WUSA was the launchpad for several well-known news anchors. Sam Donaldson and Warner Wolf are among WUSA&#x27;s most successful alumni. Max Robinson was co-anchor of &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; with Gordon Peterson from 1969 to 1978 before he became the first black anchorman on network television and one of the original anchors of &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot;. James Brown of CBS Sports was a sports anchor at the station in the 1980s.

In 1989, WUSA debuted an hour-long newscast at 4 p.m. (replacing &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, which the station chose not to continue carrying due to the program&#x27;s licensing fees, it then moved to WJLA-TV), which created a three-hour local news block from 4 to 7 p.m., resulting in a half-hour delay of the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; to 7 p.m. The 4 p.m. newscast was dropped in 2000, with WUSA also cutting a half-hour off the end of its 4–7 p.m. news block, moving the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; to 6:30 p.m., the recommended timeslot for the network newscast for CBS stations located in the Eastern Time Zone. WUSA was the only major station in the Washington market that did not carry a 4 p.m. newscast until the station revived it in September 2023. As of that date, all four major stations—including WUSA—now air a 4 p.m. newscast.

On May 2, 2005, WUSA became the first television station in the Washington market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition.

In February 2012, WUSA launched its investigative unit with Chief Investigative Reporter Russ Ptacek. Ptacek&#x27;s investigations led to reform after uncovering millions in unreported government bonuses, a utility allowed to charge customers during disconnections caused by storms, taxis refusing passengers based upon race, and potentially deadly restaurant food safety risks. Ptacek and WUSA9 parted ways in 2016 when the station announced changes to its investigative direction.

Anchor and consumer correspondent Lesli Foster reported on a petition filed by the Center For Auto Safety asking government safety regulators to recall millions of older model Jeep Grand Cherokees. The consumer group believes the placement of the plastic gas tanks in those vehicles can lead to fires and deaths when they are struck from behind. The gas tank is located behind the rear axle—literally in the crush zone of the vehicle. Chrysler says the vehicles are safe and not defective. The automaker points out that in the 26 fatal accidents cited by NHTSA where they can calculate kinetic energy, the deaths in all those vehicles involved speeds that exceed today&#x27;s crash test requirements. But the company agreed to recall over 1 million of the remaining 1993–1998 models, along with 2002–2007 Jeep Liberty&#x27;s back in June of last year. Lesli Foster was acknowledged for her hard hitting investigative report in 2013 with a NCCB-NATAS Emmy Award.

Beginning with the noon newscast on January 17, 2013, WUSA unveiled a new graphics package for the station&#x27;s newscasts designed for Gannett&#x27;s news-producing stations by design firm The Mill; the new graphics are designed to reduce on-screen clutter, which viewers complained about prior to the change to the new standardized graphics. With the change, WUSA began using the AFD #10 broadcast flag to present their newscasts in letterboxed widescreen for viewers watching on cable television through 4:3 television sets. Additionally, the station unveiled its new logo, which was stylized as &quot;wusa⋆9&quot;, in lower-case lettering.

Beginning with &quot;Wake Up Washington&quot; on April 26, 2018, WUSA unveiled a new set to replace the previous one used since the May 2, 2005, HD launch, along with a new station logo which ended the use of any stars and/or asterisks in WUSA&#x27;s branding. It also rolled out a new standardized graphics and music package for the station&#x27;s newscasts designed for Tegna&#x27;s news-producing stations.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
&lt;section begin=subs /&gt;

&lt;section end=subs /&gt;
On November 1, 2011, WUSA signed an affiliation agreement to add Bounce TV, which launched on WUSA digital subchannel 9.2, on December 16, 2011.

In August 2017, WUSA temporarily stopped carrying its subchannels due to technical considerations involving their channel sharing arrangement with WJAL (virtual channel 68), which moved its signal to WUSA&#x27;s transmitter on October 1, 2017, and moved its city of license from Hagerstown, Maryland, to Silver Spring. In the interim, Bounce arranged a new affiliation agreement with Univision to be carried on WFDC-DT, and moved its Capital Region affiliation to WFDC-DT4. Justice Network (now True Crime Network) returned later in the month on WUSA-DT2 once the move was completed.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WUSA stopped transmitting on its analog signal, over VHF channel 9, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 34 to VHF channel 9 for post-transition operations.

<text>The Maserati MC12 (&quot;Tipo M144S&quot;) is a limited production two-seater sports car produced by Italian car maker Maserati from 2004 to 2005, to allow a racing variant to compete in the FIA GT Championship. The car entered production in 2004, with 25 cars produced. A further 25 were produced in 2005 after the FIA changed the rules and reduced the maximum length allowed. The second batch of 25 are 150mm shorter than the originals, making a total of 50 cars available for customers. With the addition of 12 cars produced for racing, a total of just 62 were ever produced.

Maserati designed and built the car on the chassis of the Ferrari Enzo, but the final car is much larger and has a lower drag coefficient, along with being longer, wider and taller and has a sharper nose and smoother curves than the Enzo. The Enzo had quicker acceleration, shorter braking distance, and a higher top speed at , more than the MC12.

The MC12 was developed to signal Maserati&#x27;s return to racing after 37 years. The road version was produced to homologate the race version. One requirement for participation in the FIA GT is the production of at least 25 road cars. Three GT1 race cars were entered into the FIA GT with great success. Maserati began racing the MC12 in the FIA GT toward the end of the 2004 season, winning the race held at the Zhuhai International Circuit. The racing MC12s were entered into the American Le Mans Series races in 2005 but exceeded the size restrictions and consequently paid weight penalties due to excess range.

==Development==
Under the direction of Giorgio Ascanelli, Maserati began development of an FIA GT-eligible race car. This car, which would eventually be named the MC12, was initially called the &quot;MCC&quot; (&quot;Maserati Corse Competizione&quot;) and was to be developed simultaneously with a road-going version, called the &quot;MCS&quot; (&quot;Maserati Corse Stradale&quot;). Frank Stephenson, Director of Ferrari-Maserati Concept Design and Development at the time, did the majority of the body styling, but the initial shape was developed during wind tunnel testing from an idea presented by Giorgetto Giugiaro. The MCC has a very similar body shape to the MC12, but there are several key differences, most notably the rear spoiler. Andrea Bertolini served as the chief test driver throughout development, although some testing was done by Michael Schumacher, who frequently tested the MCC at the Fiorano Circuit. During the development process, the MCC name was set aside after Maserati established the car&#x27;s official name, MC12.

The car is based heavily on the Enzo Ferrari, using a slightly modified version of the Ferrari F140 V12 engine, the same gearbox (but given the unique name of &quot;Maserati Cambiocorsa&quot;) and the same chassis and track (length of axle between the wheels). The windshield is the only externally visible component shared with the Enzo; the MC12 has a unique body which is wider, longer and slightly taller. The increased size creates greater downforce across the MC12&#x27;s body in addition to the downforce created by the two-metre spoiler.
==Design==
The MC12 is a two-door coupé with a targa top roof, although the detached roof cannot be stored in the car. The mid-rear layout (engine between the axles but behind the cabin) keeps the centre of gravity in the middle of the car, which increases stability and improves the car&#x27;s cornering ability. The standing weight distribution is 41% front and 59% rear. At speed, however, the downforce provided by the rear spoiler affects this to the extent that at the downforce is 34% front and 66% rear.

===Interior===
Even though the car is designed as a homologation vehicle and is a modification of a racing car, the interior is intended to be luxurious. The interior is a mix of gel-coated carbon fibre, blue leather and silver &quot;Brightex&quot;, a synthetic material which was found to be &quot;too expensive for the fashion industry&quot;. The centre console features the characteristic Maserati oval analogue clock and a blue ignition button, but it has been criticised for lacking a radio, car stereo or a place to install an aftermarket sound system.

===Exterior===
The body of the car, made entirely of carbon fibre, underwent extensive wind tunnel testing to achieve maximum downforce across all surfaces. As a result, the rear spoiler is wide but only thick, the underside of the car is smooth, and the rear bumper has diffusers to take advantage of ground effect. Air is sucked into the engine compartment through the air scoop; its positioning on top of the cabin makes the car taller than the Enzo. The exterior is available only in the white-and-blue colour scheme, a tribute to the America Camoradi racing team that drove the Maserati Tipo Birdcages in the early 1960s. Bespoke colour schemes are available by paying an extra amount. The car is noted for the awkwardness that results from its size; very long and wider than a Hummer H2. This, combined with the lack of a rear window, can make parking the MC12 challenging.
===Engine===
The MC12 sports a , Enzo Ferrari-derived longitudinally-mounted 65° V12 engine. Each cylinder has 4 valves, lubricated via a dry sump system, with a compression ratio of 11.2:1. These combine to provide a maximum torque of at 5,500 rpm and a maximum power of at 7,500 rpm. The redline rpm is indicated at 7,500—despite being safe up to 7,700—whereas the Enzo has its redline at 8,000 rpm.

The Maserati MC12 can accelerate from 0 to in 3.8 seconds (though &quot;Motor Trend Magazine&quot; managed 3.7 seconds) and on to in 9.9 seconds. It can complete a standing (from stationary)  in 11.3 seconds with a terminal speed of or a standing kilometre in 20.1 seconds. The maximum speed of the Maserati MC12 is . Another change on the engine compared with the Enzo was the use of gears to drive the camshafts instead of chains. 

Power is fed to the wheels through a rear-mounted, six-speed automated manual. The gearbox is the same as the Enzo&#x27;s transmission (tuned to different gear ratios) but renamed &quot;Maserati Cambiocorsa&quot;. It provides a shift time of just 150 milliseconds and is mechanical with a twin-plate dry clutch.

===Chassis===
The MC12&#x27;s chassis is a monocoque made of carbon and nomex, with an aluminium sub-chassis at the front and rear. It has a roll bar to provide additional strength, comfort and safety. Double wishbone suspension with push-rod-operated coil springs provide stability and dampers smooth the ride for the passengers. The front of the car can be raised for speed bumps and hills by pressing a button that extends the front suspension. There are two modes for the chassis&#x27; tuning which can also be changed with a button in the cabin: &quot;sport&quot;, the standard setting, and &quot;race&quot;, which features less of the &quot;Bosch ASR&quot; (anti-slip regulation) traction control, faster shifts and stiffer suspension.

===Wheels===
The MC12 has wheels with a width of at the front and at the rear. The tyres are &quot;Pirelli P Zero Corsa&quot; with codes of 245/35 ZR 19 for the front tyres and 345/35 ZR 19 for the rear. The brakes are Brembo disc brakes with a Bosch anti-lock braking system (ABS). The front brakes have a diameter of with six-piston calipers and the rear brakes have a diameter of with four-piston calipers. The centre-lock wheel nuts that hold the wheels to the chassis are colour-coded; red on the left of the car, blue on the right.

==Reception==
The car has generally received mixed reviews, with critics saying it is hard to drive, overpriced and too large. Other criticisms include the lack of a trunk, rear window, spare tire and radio, and the way the car&#x27;s engine was limited or &quot;drugged&quot;. Former driver for Vitaphone Racing Team, Andrea Bertolini, the chief test driver throughout the development, said the car, &quot;reacts well and is very reliable in its reactions.&quot;

The &quot;Top Gear&quot; television series acquired an MC12, and test driver The Stig achieved a lap time of 1:18.9 around the &quot;Top Gear&quot; track—0.1 seconds faster than his lap in the Enzo Ferrari. Host Jeremy Clarkson also drove it, comparing it to the Maserati Biturbo, a car he disliked. Clarkson criticised the car greatly, pointing out that, unlike the Enzo, it lacks a rear window. Despite his criticisms, he complimented the smooth ride.
&quot;Motor Trend Magazine&quot; reviewer Frank Markus had a more positive opinion. Despite initial skepticism he said, &quot;It turns out that the Enzo makes a more comfortable and attractive road car when made over as a butch Maserati racer in street couture&quot;. Markus complimented the stability of braking and the handling ability of the MC12, especially the drifting allowed by the traction control when cornering, commenting that &quot;There&#x27;s none of the knife-edged limit handling we criticised in the more extreme Enzo. It&#x27;s even more forgiving at the limit than an Acura NSX.&quot;

When &quot;Automobile Magazine&quot; tested an MC12, reviewer Preston Lerner called it &quot;user-friendly&quot;, praising the responsiveness and simplicity of driving. Lerner approved of Frank Stephenson&#x27;s work with the styling of both the car&#x27;s exterior and interior, calling the trim &quot;Speed-Racer-ish&quot; but &quot;without looking as though it belongs in a Nitrous-ized Civic&quot;. He also complimented the ASR&#x27;s level of intervention, commenting that it &quot;lets the fun factor get reasonably high before kicking in&quot;.

==MC12 GT1==
===FIA GT===
In 2004 Maserati completed three MC12 GT1 race cars intended for the FIA GT GT1 class. The AF Corse factory-backed squad debuted the race at Imola, yet the FIA did not allow the MC12 to score points due to its debated homologation. Even with this setback, the team managed to take second and third places. At the next round at Oschersleben, the MC12 of Andrea Bertolini and Mika Salo won for the first time. At the final round of the year at Zhuhai, the FIA finally agreed to homologate the MC12s and allow them to score points towards the championship. With this, the MC12 again took victory, allowing it to score enough points to finish 7th in the teams championship.

In 2005 Maserati won the FIA GT Manufacturers Cup with 239 points: almost double the score of next competitor (Ferrari with 125 points). The two teams that entered MC12s into the FIA GT, Vitaphone Racing and JMB Racing, finished first and second respectively in the Team Cup, with Vitaphone winning by a considerable margin. Four of the MC12 drivers were in the running to win the FIA GT Drivers&#x27; Title at the Bahrain International Circuit at the start of the final race of 2005: Karl Wendlinger and Andrea Bertolini each on 71 points and Timo Scheider and Michael Bartels on 70. Gabriele Gardel of Ferrari was also on 70 points, however, and in the crucial race he placed ahead of all of the Maseratis, driving an older Ferrari 550 Maranello. Gardel took the title, leaving all of the Maserati drivers within four points of first place (Scheider and Wendlinger receiving four points for the race).

In 2006 the only team representing Maserati was Vitaphone Racing. On September 30, 2006, Vitaphone secured the Teams&#x27; Championship for the 2006 season despite their drivers placing 5th and 7th in the Budapest 500 km race with weight penalties of 85 kilograms and 105 kilograms respectively. Bertolini and Bartels also shared first place in the Drivers&#x27; Championship on 71 points but the manufacturers cup went to Aston Martin.

Vitaphone Racing again won the GT1 Teams&#x27; Championship in the 2007 season on 115 points, followed by fellow MC12 team Scuderia Playteam on 63 points. JMB Racing also entered two MC12s, but they were used by amateur drivers competing in the Citation Cup, which was won by JMB&#x27;s driver Ben Aucott. Maserati also won the Manufacturers&#x27; Cup by a significant margin while Thomas Biagi won the Drivers&#x27; Championship. Fellow Vitaphone drivers Miguel Ramos and Christian Montanari tied for sixth, while Playteam&#x27;s Andrea Bertolini and Andrea Piccini were just behind.

For 2008, Vitaphone Racing returned with a pair of MC12s for drivers Andrea Bertolini, Michael Bartels, and Miguel Ramos, as well as newcomer Alexandre Negrão. The season ended with another Teams&#x27; Championship for Vitaphone Racing (122.5 points) and Drivers&#x27; Championship for Bertolini and Bartels. In the ninth round, the team fielded a third car under the name of Team Vitasystem, driven by Pedro Lamy and Matteo Bobbi which scored one point. JMB Racing retained a single MC12 for 2007 Citation Cup winner Ben Aucott and drivers Peter Kutemann and Alain Ferté, competing in the first five events of the championship.

In the 2009 season the Vitaphone Racing won the fifth consecutive Team Championship, while Bertolini and Bartels gained their third Drivers&#x27; Championship. The other two drivers were Miguel Ramos and Alex Müller, who ended in sixth position. Starting from the fourth round, the team entered a third car under the name of Vitaphone Racing Team DHL, driven by Matteo Bobbi and Alessandro Pier Guidi, achieving good results: despite being only a one-car team, with a partial season involvement, they ended the Teams&#x27; Championship in fourth position (32 points), scoring a victory in the last round.

===FIA GT1 World Championship===
With the inauguration of the FIA GT1 World Championship in 2010, Maserati continued their commitment to the series with two teams entering. Vitaphone Racing Team, the defending FIA GT Champions, won five races en route to the Drivers&#x27; and Teams&#x27; World Championships. The second team representing Maserati was Alfrid Heger&#x27;s Triple H Team Hegersport.

===Italian GT===
MC12s have had great success racing in Italy, and have replaced the GT3 &quot;Maserati Trofeo Light&quot; as Maserati&#x27;s representative in the Italian GT Championship. In 2005 Maserati introduced two MC12s to the GT1 division under Scuderia Playteam and Racing Box, with the teams placing first and third overall respectively. The cars were re-entered in 2006, with Scuderia Playteam again securing overall victory and Racing Box coming second. From 2007, GT1 cars are not permitted in the championship, and Scuderia Playteam moved to the FIA GT Championship.

Racing Box also participated in the non-championship 6 Hours of Vallelunga twice, winning in 2005 with Michele Rugolo, Leonardo Maddelena, and Davide Mastracci, then again in 2006 with Pedro Lamy, Marco Cioci, and Piergiuseppe Perazzini.

===Super GT===
In 2006, the Le Mans winning outfit Team Goh was intending to race a Maserati MC12 in the Super GT series in Japan. However, the team was forced to withdraw because of driver problems (Jan Magnussen falling ill suddenly and returning to Denmark) and disappointing lap times at the Suzuka Circuit during testing. While the car was faster than its Super GT prototype rivals down the straights, it was losing more than a second per lap in the corners due to its poorer aerodynamics.

===American Le Mans Series===
In 2004 the Maserati MC12s were unable to compete in series backed by the ACO, such as the Le Mans Endurance Series (LMES) in Europe and the American Le Mans Series (ALMS) because they exceeded both the length and width restrictions for their class. The car&#x27;s nose was shortened by to attempt to comply with regulations, but was still too wide. In 2005 the governing body of the ALMS, the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA), allowed the MC12s to compete as a guest with the agreement that they were not allowed to score championship points and were forced to run a weight penalty. Some ALMS teams initially objected to the participation of the MC12 due to the possibility that an accident could eliminate their chances at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, but the MC12 was finally allowed to race. The ACO stood by their ruling on the car by forbidding it from entering other Le Mans series.

The lone MC12 would be campaigned under the Maserati Corse banner, but run by the American Risi Competizione team. The 2005 American Le Mans Series season was not as successful for the team, with the team scoring no wins. In the final race at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca, the MC12 was clipped by a competitor, causing damage that resulted in a lengthy pit stop. After resuming the race, a loss of traction caused by cold tires made the car hit a curb, which broke the radiator and took the MC12 out of the race.

In August 2007, Fredy Lienhard and Didier Theys announced their preparation of a former FIA GT MC12 for use in the American Le Mans Series. The car made its debut at Road America, finishing 3rd in the GT1 class after qualifying competitively. The only other race entered was Round 11 at Road Atlanta for the Petit Le Mans where the team failed to finish following an accident, but were still classified second in class. Doran&#x27;s Maserati however had qualified on the class pole. The team selected Michelin tires instead of the Pirellis originally used by Maserati Corse in 2005, and was also allowed to race with a full-width rear wing instead of the smaller wing used by Maserati Corse and teams in FIA GT, although the wing was not as tall. IMSA also allowed Doran to score points in the American Le Mans Series championships.

==MC12 Versione Corse==

The MC12 Versione Corse is a variant of the MC12 intended for racetrack use. In contrast to the race version of the MC12, of which street-legal versions were produced for homologation purposes, the MC12 Corse is intended for private use, albeit restricted to the track, as the Corse&#x27;s modifications make it illegal to drive on the road.

The Versione Corse was developed directly from the MC12 GT1, which won the 2005 FIA GT Manufacturers Cup. The car was released in mid-2006, &quot;in response to the customer demand to own the MC12 racing car and fueled by the growth in track days, where owners can drive their cars at high speeds in the safety of a race track&quot;, as stated by Edward Butler, General Manager for Maserati in Australia and New Zealand. In similar fashion to the Ferrari FXX, although the owners are private individuals, Maserati is responsible for the storage, upkeep, and maintenance of the cars, and they are only driven on specially organized track days. Unlike the FXX, Versione Corses are not used for research and development, and are used only for entertainment. Three Maserati MC12 Versione Corses were converted to road legal use by German tuning firm Edo Competition and feature a slight power increase, a butterfly intake exhaust system and adjustable road suspension system.

Only twelve MC12 Versione Corses were sold to selected customers, each of whom paid €1 million (US$1.47 million) for the privilege. Another three vehicles were produced for testing and publicity purposes. The Versione Corse shares its engine with the MC12 GT1; the powerplant produces at 8,000 rpm, more than the road going MC12. The MC12 Versione Corse shares the GT1&#x27;s shortened nose, which was a requirement for entry into the American Le Mans Series. The car was available in a single standard colour, named &quot;Blue Victory&quot;, though the car&#x27;s paint could be customized upon request. The MC12 Versione Corse possesses steel/carbon racing brakes, but is not fitted with an anti-lock braking system.

==Birdcage 75th==

The Maserati Birdcage 75th is a concept car developed by automobile manufacturer Maserati and designed by Pininfarina. It was first introduced at the 2005 Geneva Auto Show and was based on the MC12&#x27;s chassis. It draws inspiration from the Maserati Tipo 61 Birdcage of the 1960s and was made as a celebration of Pininfarina&#x27;s 75th anniversary.

<text>The Smetana Quartet () was a Czech string quartet that was in existence from 1943 to 1989, although it was known as the Smetana Quartet only from 1945 onwards.

== Personnel ==
1st violin
* Václav Neumann (1920-1995), from 1943 to 1945
* Jaroslav Rybenský, from 1945 to 1947
* Jiří Novák (1924-2010), since 1947

2nd violin
* Lubomír Kostecký (1922-2003)

Viola
* Jiří Neumann, from 1943 to 1945
* Václav Neumann, from 1945 to 1947
* Jaroslav Rybenský, from 1947 to 1956
* Milan Škampa (1928-2018), since 1956

Cello
* Antonín Kohout (1919-2013)

== Origins and activities ==
The Smetana Quartet arose from the Quartet of the Czech Conservatory, which was founded in 1943 (during the Nazi occupation) in Prague by Antonín Kohout, the cellist. With Jaroslav Rybenský and Lubomír Kostecký as first and second violins, and Václav Neumann as violist, the group gave its first performance as the Smetana Quartet on 6 November 1945, at the Municipal Library in Prague. Neumann left to pursue conducting in 1947, at which point Rybenský went to the viola desk and Jiří Novák (who shared first violin desk with Josef Vlach, founder of the Vlach Quartet, under Vaclav Talich in the Czech Chamber Orchestra) came in as first violin.

By 1949 the group had official connections with the Czech Philharmonic. The first foreign tour was in 1949, to Poland, and the first recording was of the second quartet by Bedřich Smetana in 1950. Rybenský was obliged to retire after ill health in 1952, and was replaced by Milan Škampa. The performers were appointed professors at the Academy of Musical Arts in 1967. Of their many recordings, those made at that time for German Electrola are considered particularly fine.

For many years this group, which has been called the finest Czech quartet of its time, played the Czech repertoire from memory, giving these works a special intensity and intimacy.

The Smetana Quartet made the third commercial digital recording ever made, Mozart&#x27;s K.421 and K.458, in Tokyo April 24–26, 1972. They re-recorded the same repertoire ten years later in Prague.

Antonín Kohout trained the Kocian Quartet (founded 1972) and the Martinů Quartet (1976), though the latter&#x27;s members had been pupils of Professor Viktor Moučka, cellist of the Vlach Quartet.

<doc id="1213108" wikidata="Q835156" url="?curid=1213108" title="The Legend of Mir 2">
<text>The Legend of Mir 2 () is a sprite-based isometric 3-D massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Korean-based WeMade Entertainment. There are currently two versions available: Korean and Chinese. The European version (published by Game Network) came to a close on 31 March 2009, after running for 8 years, and the North American version (published by Gamepot) came to a close on 14 May 2012.

Whilst being moderately successful in Europe, it has been well received in Asia and was the most popular MMORPG in China in 2002 and 2003, with over 250,000 simultaneous users being reported. The game has also claimed to have 120 million players worldwide.

The sequel, &quot;The Legend of Mir 3&quot;, has a similar gameplay but has updated graphics, as well as providing larger maps. It has not quite reached the popularity levels of its predecessor and has so far been released in the same countries as &quot;Mir 2&quot;, as well as in North America.

== Gameplay ==
=== Characters ===
Players have the option of playing one of four professions, with no more than three characters per server. Professions range from Taoist, healers who use magical and melee attacks. This is the support class of mir and not suited to solo game play. Taoists can summon pets to assist in battle, poison targets and heal. Warriors, who are the &quot;tanks&quot; of Mir use melee attacks and have the highest defense and attack attributes of all classes. Wizards depend on magic and can kill multiple monsters with ease using AoE spells. Wizards have low health and defense against physical damage and are especially weak against higher level warrior magic attacks. Assassins have taken over as the primary melee damage dealing class but have much weaker defense attributes than warriors. Conversely this instead of undermining the warrior class, has strengthened its position and clarified its role as the &#x27;tank&#x27;.

=== PK/PVP ===
Players are allowed to attack and kill other players ingame for any given reason, though it is generally frowned upon. Once a player has killed another player they are labeled with either yellow or later, red, that informs other players that they have killed somebody recently. Red players are not allowed in most cities and are generally ignored by NPC&#x27;s. Red players are also fair game to other players, a punishment for their PK status.

Another punishment is the chance of having one&#x27;s weapon cursed by killing another player. Curses cause weapons to deal less of a melee blow. Increased number of curses will render a weapon useless.

While attacking another player, the attacker will be labeled with a Brown player name. Any other player can attack and kill the offending player without accumulating PK points.

===Point System===
Players are labeled with a PK status after successfully killing another player. Each kill is considered 100 PK points. One point is removed every minute. The point system consists of:
* 0-99 points - the player continues to have a white character name, even though the character still has PK points.
* 100-199 points - the player&#x27;s name will turn yellow, a symbol that the player has killed somebody recently.
* 200 and above - the player&#x27;s name will be red, showing that the player has killed at least Two people. While red the player can be killed without any ill effect to the attacking player. Red players will lose almost all of their bag when dying. Some players joined guilds specific to player killing, resulting in characters that could spend months if not years waiting for their PK points to expire.

Any towns that are guarded by a Guard, Archer Guard or a Town Archer will attack any red named player on sight. This stops any red named players from entering towns, or if they&#x27;re already in the town it decreases their safe areas dramatically. The damage caused by a guard or archer is considerably high, requiring only a few strikes to take down even the highest level character.

== History ==
=== European Mir ===
The Italian games company Game Network (originally owned by Digital Bros) was responsible for the operation of the European version of the game. Game Network originally had their own satellite television channel (which also has a dedicated show to it, &quot;Me in Mir&quot;), but was later closed in 2005 (in Italy) and 2006 (in UK) due to lack of funding.

In January 2006, gwyl, who played on the Phoenix server, became the first player to reach the level 50 milestone and has a statue of his character erected in the game.

In the 2007 yearly review and the September quarterly review, Digital Bros made it clear that they not only intended to replace &quot;The Legend of Mir 2&quot; but also another MMORPG service they provided, the &quot;Myth of Soma&quot;. Digital Bros cited declining subscription revenues (from €178,000 the previous year, to just €32,000) as the reason.

&quot;The Legend of Mir 2&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Mir 3&quot;, and the &quot;Myth of Soma&quot; were all closed in Europe in March 2009.

<doc id="1213109" wikidata="Q3641035" url="?curid=1213109" title="Blood Guts &amp; Pussy">
<text>Blood Guts &amp; Pussy is a 1990 album by the Dwarves. It was their first album for Sub Pop, and the album&#x27;s sleeve was the subject of controversy, receiving protests from feminists. Dwarves frontman Blag The Ripper asserts that the &quot;Blood Guts &amp; Pussy&quot; classic &quot;Drug Store&quot; is one of his favourite songs to play live, and that it is frequently requested during live sets.

==Track listing==
* The vinyl format includes the bonus track &quot;Gash Wagon&quot;, but does not include &quot;Astro Boy&quot; or &quot;Motherfucker&quot;. Some CD issues include the bonus tracks &quot;Fuckhead&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s a Bitch&quot;.

==Critical reception==

AllMusic&#x27;s Matt Carlson, who commented on the album&#x27;s &quot;explicit exploitation and genuinely disgusting humor&quot;, and described it as &quot;thirteen songs full of general punk sloppiness and distortion performed in 14 minutes&quot;. David Sprague of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; described the album as &quot;tight and musicianly&quot;. It was voted &quot;most offensive album ever made&quot; in &quot;SPIN&quot;. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; reviewer described the album as &quot;the birth, death and resurrection (of punk rock) in just about 13 minutes.&quot;

Both commented on the album&#x27;s sleeve, which was described as &quot;equally disgusting&quot; as the album title, featuring a photograph by Michael Lavine of three nude models covered in animal blood, which Sprague saw as designed for &quot;calculated offence&quot;. The sleeve art was referenced on the 2000 album &quot;Come Clean&quot;, which was similar, but with the blood replaced with soap. Jason Heller of The A.V. Club later called it &quot;one of the most unforgettable album covers of the decade...It was an acidic, idiotic reminder that punk could still shock and offend (and flat-out fucking rock).&quot;

The album was described as &quot;a bona-fide punk classic&quot; by the &quot;OC Weekly&quot;. Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork said it was the band&#x27;s &quot;Platonic ideal of phallic stupidity&quot;.

<doc id="1213120" wikidata="Q179804" url="?curid=1213120" title="Melos Quartet">
<text>The Melos Quartet was a much-recorded, Stuttgart-based string quartet active from 1965 until 2005, when its first violinist died. It also went by the name Melos Quartett Stuttgart, partly to distinguish itself from the equally prominent chamber group the Melos Ensemble of London.

== Origins and activities ==
Melos Quartett Stuttgart was founded in October 1965 by four young members of well-known German chamber orchestras. The name Melos, an ancient Greek word for singing, and the root of the word &quot;melody&quot;, was suggested by the combination of the names Melcher and Voss, to indicate their purpose as distinct individuals seeking musical harmony together. Leader Melcher of Hamburg studied with Erich Röhn and with both Pina Carmirelli and Arrigo Pelliccia of the Boccherini Quintet in Rome. He won the International Chamber Music Competition in Venice in 1962 and became concertmaster of the Hamburg Symphony Orchestra the next year. The Voss brothers are Rhinelanders. They studied with Sandor Végh, and Hermann continued as a pupil of Ulrich Koch, becoming solo violist of the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra. Cellist Buck is a Swabian who studied in Düsseldorf and Freiburg and with Ludwig Hoelscher in Stuttgart. Gerhard Voss and Buck were members of the Württemberg Chamber Orchestra.

In 1966 the group gave its first recital, won a prize in the Villa-Lobos-Quartet competition in Rio de Janeiro, represented West Germany at the World Congress of &quot;Jeuness Musicale&quot; in Paris, and, most influentially for their future success, won the &quot;Prix américain&quot; as the best quartet at the Geneva International Congress of Musical Performance. 

Then, giving up their orchestral positions to concentrate solely on the Quartet, they began touring in 1967 and in 1968 performed in seven European countries. In 1969 they gave 105 concerts throughout the world, and had their first television appearance.

==Contract with Deutsche Grammophon==
In 1969 the group signed a five-year contract with the D.G.G. record company, and spent 25 days that year making recordings for radio and commercial release. They obtained the first prize of the &quot;String Quartet Foundation&quot; sponsored by German industry in 1970, and in 1972 they entered into a further contract with D.G.G. for complete recordings of the Schubert and Cherubini string quartets.

After this they undertook tours around the world, in North and South America, Africa, all European countries, the Near East and Far East, getting as far as Novosibirsk in Russia. They became the first West German musicians to play in Volgograd (Stalingrad), in 1973, in concerts commemorating the events of 1943. By 1975, when the Schubert integral recordings were completed and issued, the Quartet also held a teaching post at the Stuttgart School of Music.

By 1975 the group had built up a repertoire of 120 works, including the complete Beethoven, Schubert, Cherubini, Mendelssohn, Schumann, Brahms, Janáček quartets, and works by Haydn, Mozart, Hugo Wolf, Pfitzner, Verdi, Donizetti, Debussy, Smetana, Kodály, Hindemith, Bartók, Alban Berg, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Witold Lutosławski, Milko Kelemen, Robert Wittinger and Josef Maria Horváth. They made a conscious decision to have a wide-ranging repertoire in order to avoid getting stuck to any particular period.

For most of the Schubert recordings the instruments were a cello by Francesco Ruggieri (1682), a viola by Carlo Ferdinando Landolfi (18th century), first violin by Domenico Montagnana (1731) and second violin by Carlo Annibale Tononi (18th century).

They were planning a farewell tour in 2005, when Wilhelm Melcher, the first violinist died unexpectedly just before his 65th birthday.

Among others, the Quartet collaborated with Arthur Rubinstein, Mstislav Rostropovich, Georg Solti, Narciso Yepes, Piero Farulli and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.

==Personnel==
The membership was unusually stable:

* Wilhelm Melcher (*1940 – †2005), violin I
* Gerhard Voss (*1939), from 1965 to 1993 violin II
* Ida Bieler (*1950), from 1993 to 2005 violin II
* Hermann Voss (*1934), viola
* Peter Buck (*1937), cello

==Documentaries==
* Das Melos-Quartett - Vier leben für die kammermusik (Four Lives for Chamber Music) &quot;The members of the Melos Quartet talk about their lives and experiences around music. As a common theme, they perform Franz Schubert&#x27;s Quartet No.15 - Film by Klaus Kirschner (1988)&quot;
* Melos String Quartet | Japanese TV Interview &quot;Interview with the Melos Quartet on Japanese TV prior to their concert with pieces by Schubert, Mozart and Beethoven. (Live in Japan 26/3/1990)&quot;

==Recordings==
For Deutsche Grammophon label, in 1977, they taped Schubert&#x27;s &quot;String Quintet&quot; with Mstislav Rostropovich as second cellist; Mozart&#x27;s &quot;10 Great String Quartets&quot;, and the complete cycles of Mendelssohn, Schumann, Brahms, Cherubini and Schubert. They recorded the complete Beethoven cycle twice (1970 for Intercord and 1983/85 for DGG), and later the two Janáček Quartets. For DGG, with violists Franz Beyer and Piero Farulli, they recorded the complete String Quintets by Mozart.
They recorded also many unusual repertoire for SWR Radio, which has been since released digitally.

<doc id="1213122" wikidata="Q435435" url="?curid=1213122" title="Heather Donahue">
<text>Rei Hance (born Heather Donahue; December 22, 1974) is an American retired actress, credited under her birth name during her acting career. She is known for starring in the horror film &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; (1999) and the miniseries &quot;Taken&quot; (2002). After retiring from acting, she became a medical marijuana grower. She legally changed her name to Rei Hance in 2020.

==Early life==
Heather Donahue was born on December 22, 1974, in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Joan, an office manager, and James Donahue, a printer. She graduated from Philadelphia&#x27;s University of the Arts in 1995 with a BFA in theater, and also performed in productions at the Battersea Arts Centre in London, England, where she apprenticed in conjunction with the University of the Arts London. After completing her studies, she worked as an administrative office temp worker while appearing in New York stage productions.

==Career==

=== 1995–2008: &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; and acting ===
Donahue&#x27;s first screen appearance, and best known role, is in the 1999 found-footage horror film &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;. Her role in the film originated in 1997, when she read about an audition that was being advertised in &quot;Backstage&quot; magazine for actors with strong improvisational abilities, which were needed for an independent horror film. She auditioned at the Musical Theater Works in New York City and was cast in one of the three principal roles. She and the two other main cast members Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard were cast as characters that would share their given names. She would come to regret this later in life, changing her name to Rei Hance years after retiring from acting. 

For the role, Donahue had to learn how to operate a camera, spending two days in a crash course. She said she modeled her character after a director that she once worked with, citing the character&#x27;s self-assuredness when everything went as planned, and confusion during crisis. After filming, Donahue and the two other leads were asked not to appear on any television shows or in any films, as the filmmakers made great advertising efforts to portray the events in the film as factual, including the distribution of flyers at festivals such as the Sundance Film Festival, asking viewers to come forward with any information about the &quot;missing&quot; students. The IMDb page for the film also listed the actors as &quot;missing, presumed dead&quot; in the first year of the film&#x27;s availability. The promotion for the film was so convincing that Donahue&#x27;s mother received sympathy cards from people who believed that her daughter was actually dead or missing.

Once released, the film received unexpected acclaim from critics and became a resounding box office success–grossing over US$248 million worldwide, making it one of the most successful independent movies of all time. While being nominated for a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Actress – Newcomer, and an Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Actress, Donahue was also nominated for worst actress at the Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, and won in the same category at the Golden Raspberry Awards. Donahue later admitted there was a considerable amount of backlash against her because of her association with the film, which led to her having threatening encounters with people, and difficulty finding other employment.

A year after the release of &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, she appeared in the independent film &quot;Home Field Advantage&quot;, and alongside Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Jason Biggs in the romantic comedy &quot;Boys and Girls&quot;. In 2001, she appeared in the independent film &quot;Seven and a Match&quot; and in the short film &quot;The Velvet Tigress&quot;. In 2002, she had a co-starring role in the science fiction miniseries &quot;Taken&quot;, for which she was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress on Television. The same year, she appeared in an array of short films and televised films, such as &quot;The Walking Hack of Asbury Park&quot;, &quot;New Suit&quot; and &quot;The Big Time&quot;. In 2005, she guest-starred in an episode of the comedy series &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;. Her last acting role was in the 2008 direct-to-DVD horror film &quot;The Morgue&quot;.

=== 2008–present: Business and writing ventures ===
Donahue left acting in 2008 to become a medical marijuana grower. In 2011, she signed a publishing deal for her debut book &quot;Growgirl&quot;, about her time as a marijuana grower, which was released on January 5, 2012 by Gotham Books. As of 2013, she was residing in Nevada City, California. At the time, she was also reported to be developing a line of herbal skin-care products. In a 2016 interview in &quot;GQ&quot;, she discussed the ongoing challenges associated with having used her birth name in &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;a name she was still using at the time of the interview. The same interview revealed that she was writing for, and intended to produce, a sitcom tentatively called &quot;The High Country&quot;, based on her experiences in marijuana farming. 

During the development of the 2016 sequel to &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, she was contacted by the film&#x27;s producers for permission to use her name and likeness in the film, which she later stated was a difficult decision: &quot;My name and face are forever going to be someone else&#x27;s intellectual property. My snot-flooded portrait was back. It&#x27;s all anyone wanted to talk to me about...  Then Lionsgate called. The company that originally bought &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; was purchased by Lionsgate and they&#x27;re the ones behind this new sequel. They asked what they could do to show me how much they appreciated my work in the original. They made sure my last name wasn&#x27;t used anywhere. In their press materials, their protagonist goes in search of his &#x27;sister&#x27; but they don&#x27;t use my name. For all the talk of Hollywood being populated with jerks and sharks, these guys were actually being considerate and were genuinely concerned that this would not be any more disruptive to my life than was inevitable&quot;.

In 2020, she formally changed her name to Rei Hance. Hance stated in a 2021 interview that she was paid a sum of money for the use of her likeness in the sequel, but that it had followed eight years of &quot;constant failure&quot; in her life, and so she &quot;took that money and just drove around North America, getting shitfaced for about two years, and hoping I would die. Like I did not want to be alive anymore.&quot; She subsequently relocated to Maine and became sober. She is a practicing Buddhist.

<text>XMODS were 1:28 scale electric radio-controlled cars. Originally invented by Nobuaki Ogihara in Japan, XMODS were released with several body styles over multiple generations. Due to the popularity of tuner culture in the early to mid 2000&#x27;s, the cars&#x27; primary marketing focus was on customization. This was reflected by the various first party body kits and upgrades released with XMODS. The cars were distributed by RadioShack in the United States, by Hobby Products International (HPI Racing) in Japan, Mirage RC in the U.K. (Distributor of HPI Products in the U.K.), and by Carson Modellsport (Subdivision of Tamiya Germany) in Europe.

==Models==

===XMODS Generation 1===
The original, first-generation XMODS were released in the Fall of 2003, featuring semi-proportional steering and modular construction enabling parts to be swapped. Eleven body styles were released with several colors and a body exclusive to Europe and Asia.

For XMODS released through RadioShack and HPI, each car came with a mini-magazine (Super Street for the Japanese models and Hot Rod for the American models), featuring write-ups on selected models and upgrade accessories.

===XMODS Evolution===

The XMODS Evolution models were released in the Autumn of 2005 with substantial construction differences when compared to the previous XMODS Generation 1 generation:
* The electronics were vastly improved, with one main board compared versus two for the Generation 1 chassis.
* The motor was mounted transversely in contrast to Generation 1&#x27;s longitudinal layout.
* The battery housing was moved to the bottom for better weight distribution.
* Suspension design was revamped.
* The servo housing was integrated into the chassis.
* New body clip system that no longer required a locking mechanism on the chassis.
* A new truck chassis was released that provided more ground clearance and an articulating chassis. 

Despite these differences, it was still possible to swap bodies wheels between the Evolution and Generation 1 cars. Some models sold outside the U.S. by Carson and HPI featured repainted Generation 1 bodies. Like the previous generation models, each XMODS Evolution car came with a Super Street (Japanese models) or Hot Rod (American models) mini-magazine. Truck models had a Truckin&#x27; mini-magazine. The XMODS Evolution generation was eventually discontinued in mid-2007.

===XMODS Evolution Transformers===

In June 2007, RadioShack released two XMODS Evolution models to coincide with the release of the film &quot;Transformers&quot;. Unlike other XMODS, which came in reusable plastic cases, these models came in cardboard boxes. Special body and light kits were available for these models. 

Bumblebee (2009 Chevrolet Camaro Concept) 
* Yellow with Black Stripes
* Optional accessory kit included a light kit, hood-mounted cannon, and door-mounted missile launchers.
Barricade (2007 Saleen S281 Police Car)
* Black with White Doors
* Optional accessory kit included flashing lights for the light bar, headlight claws, and a hood-mounted missile launcher.

===XMODS Evolution Street===

The XMODS Evolution Street generation was confirmed in mid-2008 via RadioShack employee memos and were released on October of that year. Compared to the previous XMODS Evolution generation, the Evolution Street had several differences:
* The RX/TX crystals were no longer removable and were soldered onto the electronics board and inside the controller.
* Foam inserts in the XMODS carrying box were replaced with thermoformed plastic.
* Mini-magazines were no longer included. Flame and XMODS decals were still included. 
* Rubber was used to protect parts of the motor.
* Thicker plastic wheel bearings, reducing wheel wobble, a concern with older XMODS Evolution models.
* Rear A-Arms and motor cradle were reinforced.
* There were no body kit options for any of the cars. The bumpers and spoiler were molded onto the body of all of the cars.

In late 2010, the Evolution Street generation was discontinued.

===XMODS Micro RC===
Along with the release of the XMODS Evolution Street models, RadioShack relaunched the ZipZaps Micro RC line under the XMODS Micro banner. Aside from the new labels that bear the XMODS Micro RC logo, the packaging was similar to the ZipZaps line. All parts (e.g. motors, wheel covers, bodies, etc.) on the XMODS Micro line were compatible between ZipZaps and vice versa, with the exception of the 2009 models, which have one-piece wheels that do not allow the swapping of wheel covers. The cars use the traditional box-type controller, as opposed to the gun-type controller used in the ZipZaps SE line.

===XMODS Generation 3===

In Fall 2013, RadioShack released a new XMODS with two brand-new chassis designs, touring and buggy. The new models were 1:24 in scale as opposed to the previous generations&#x27; 1:28. This generation of XMODS did not have licensing from any automotive maker. In lieu of this, generic bodies were used along with bodies modeled after the Kamata SYNCi, Lucky &amp; Wild Evolver, and Kamata RC410 from the Ridge Racer video game series. New features include a 2.4 GHz radio, a lithium-ion battery upgrade, and staggered tires. Two other bodies are also available separately, one in a set with lights, and the other in a set with a &quot;nitrous boost&quot; ultracapacitor that allows a 3- to 5-second speed boost when a button on the controller is pressed. Other upgrades that were available were extra tires, a high speed rear end, rear end with a faster motor, and an all wheel drive upgrade. In 2015, the Generation 3 XMODS were discontinued.

==Modifications==

XMODS can be extensively modified using parts supplied by RadioShack and other aftermarket vendors. The starter kits advertise the ability to change the motor, wheels, tires, trim kit, springs/shocks, and bearings (From nylon bushings to steel bearings), add lighting kits, and, in some generations, swap the crystal to allow the cars to operate on multiple frequencies.

Tutorials for modifications are also available on various XMODS forum sites. In Japan, HPI distributes XMODS, in Europe distributed by CARSON Modellsport, with the cars having the same colors as those offered in the U.S. by RadioShack, but also some exclusive body colors and body tops not available to the US market.

Even though each model has a different body, all models in a particular line share the same or similar chassis. The most notable difference in the chassis is its length relative to its body top. You can also add motor upgrades onto them for faster speeds.

While using non-RadioShack upgrades, it is possible to achieve up to and over 40 MPH.

Some people have used servo motors in their XMODS trucks to achieve higher torque, resulting in easier crawling, but with a very limited top speed.

People have replaced the stock electronics with hobby grade electronics to improve smoothness of the servo, improving the top speed, and range.

<doc id="1213126" wikidata="Q6787206" url="?curid=1213126" title="Mathieu Gascongne">
<text>Mathieu Gascongne (first name also Matthieu or Matthias; last name also Gascogne, Gascongus, Gascone, Gasconia, and Guascogna; fl. early 16th century) was a French composer of the Renaissance. Contemporaries, such as Adrian Willaert (as quoted by the renowned Venetian theorist Zarlino) grouped him with Josquin, Ockeghem, and Jean Mouton as among the finest composers of the time. Compared with those others, however, little of his output has survived.

==Life==

Little is known for certain about his life, and there are two principal theories regarding where he lived and worked. The first is that he was associated with the French royal court, for he wrote several motets for official occasions (such as the coronation of King Francis I in 1515); this would have put him there at the same time as Jean Mouton and just after Antoine de Févin. In addition, one document describes him as a priest of the Meaux diocese, and also associates him with the cathedral in Tours; it also names him as a singer in the royal chapel in 1517–1518. A second theory is that he was associated with a group of composers active at Cambrai, since his music appears in manuscripts there. Possibly both theories are correct, and he was active in Paris in the first decades of the 16th century, and at Cambrai later.

==Music and influence==

Gascongne wrote masses, motets and chansons. Nine masses have been attributed to him, but not all survive complete. Of his motets, two are settings of the Magnificat. The chansons were famous, and Gascongne has been called the inventor, along with Antoine de Févin, of the Parisian &quot;chanson rustique&quot; . Adrian Willaert, the founder of the Venetian school, also held Gascongne in high regard, stating that he was on the level of Josquin, Ockeghem, and his own teacher Jean Mouton.

Most of his sacred music is for four a cappella voices; he uses as source material chansons by Pierre de la Rue, Jean Mouton and Josquin des Prez. His chansons are mostly for three voices, but there are numerous works which are attributed to him in one source but to another composer in other sources (Mouton is a common competitor for attribution). Stylistically his music is typical of French music of the early 16th century, with smooth, balanced polyphony and pervasive imitation.

<doc id="1213130" wikidata="Q679110" url="?curid=1213130" title="Joshua Leonard">
<text>Joshua Granville Leonard (born June 17, 1975) is an American actor, producer, writer, and director, known for his role in &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot; (1999). He has since starred in films such as &quot;Madhouse&quot; (2004), &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; (2006), &quot;Higher Ground&quot; (2011), &quot;The Motel Life&quot; (2012), &quot;Snake and Mongoose&quot; (2013), &quot;If I Stay&quot; (2014), &quot;The Town That Dreaded Sundown&quot; (2014), &quot;6 Years&quot; (2015), and &quot;Unsane&quot; (2018).

==Early life==
Leonard was born in Houston, Texas, the son of Joann, an author, and Robert Leonard, a theater professor at Pennsylvania State University. He was raised in State College, Pennsylvania. Leonard obtained his GED and at age 16 travelled to Chiapas, Mexico, where he taught at an elementary school and volunteered at an anthropological institute. Leonard then spent time in Seattle and London, where he developed an interest in photography, before settling in New York City at age 19.

==Career==
In 1997, Leonard auditioned for and landed one of the three principal roles in the found footage horror film &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;. Although he reportedly only earned an initial salary of $500, the experience proved rewarding in other ways as the film combined acting and photography. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Leonard has since appeared in numerous films and television shows as an actor, including HBO&#x27;s television film &quot;Live from Baghdad&quot;, the drama film &quot;Things Behind the Sun&quot; directed by Allison Anders, the comedy film &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; with Tim Allen, the drama film &quot;Men of Honor&quot; with Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding, Jr., and the psychological thriller film &quot;Bitter Feast&quot; with Larry Fessenden.

In 2009, he starred in the Independent Spirit Award-winning film &quot;Humpday&quot;, for which he won Best Actor at the Gijón International Film Festival. Leonard has also appeared on the acclaimed HBO series &quot;Hung&quot; and the Showtime series &quot;United States of Tara&quot;. Leonard directed the short film &quot;The Youth in Us&quot;, which was shown at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. Art documentary &quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; followed, winning the Grand Jury Prize at CineVegas in 2008. He has also directed music videos for many popular acts, such as Morcheeba, Harper Simon, and Fitz and the Tantrums, as well as teaching directing and acting at The New York Film Academy, UC Irvine, and Academia Internacional De Cinema in São Paulo, Brazil. In 2011, Leonard starred in Vera Farmiga&#x27;s directorial debut drama film &quot;Higher Ground&quot;, playing a religious man at odds with his wife (Farmiga). He also co-wrote, directed and starred in &quot;The Lie&quot;, a devilish morality tale adapted from the story by acclaimed author T. C. Boyle. The project co-starred Mark Webber, Jess Weixler, and Jane Adams, and was well received by audiences and critics.

Leonard next appeared alongside Dakota Fanning in &quot;The Motel Life&quot; (2012). The following year, he starred alongside Carol Kane and Natasha Lyonne in the dark comedy film &quot;Clutter&quot;, and co-starred in the sports film &quot;Snake and Mongoose&quot;. In 2014, Leonard co-starred in the drama film &quot;If I Stay&quot;, directed by R. J. Cutler and based on the novel of the same name by Gayle Forman. Leonard was then cast in the third season of A&amp;E&#x27;s drama-thriller series &quot;Bates Motel&quot; as James Finnigan, a psychology professor and a love interest for Norma Louise Bates. In 2015, he had a co-starring role in the romantic drama film &quot;6 Years&quot;, directed by Hannah Fidell, which premiered at South by Southwest.

<doc id="1213134" wikidata="Q4348667" url="?curid=1213134" title="The Railway Series">
<text>The Railway Series is a series of British books about a railway known as the North Western Railway, located on the fictional Island of Sodor. There are 42 books in the series, the first published in May 1945 by the Rev. Wilbert Awdry. Awdry wrote 26 books; the final one being written in October 1972. His son, Christopher, wrote 16 more between September 1983 and July 2011. The series features many anthropomorphic vehicles, including Thomas the Tank Engine. Thomas became the most popular and famous character in the series and the titular character of the television series &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; from 1984 to 2021. The children&#x27;s television series originated as adaptations of these stories.

Nearly all of &quot;The Railway Series&quot; stories were based on real-life events. As a lifelong railway enthusiast, Awdry was keen that his stories should be as realistic as possible. The engine characters were mostly based upon real classes of locomotives, and some of the railways themselves were based upon real lines in the British Isles.

Audio adaptations of &quot;The Railway Series&quot; have been recorded at various times under the title &quot;The Railway Stories&quot;.

==Origins==
The stories began in 1942, when Christopher, at the age of two, had measles and was confined to a darkened room. His father told him stories and rhymes to cheer him up. One of Christopher&#x27;s favourite rhymes was:
&lt;poem&gt;Early in the morning,
Down at the station,
All the little engines
Standing in a row.

Along comes the driver,
Pulls the little lever
Puff, puff! Chuff, chuff!
Off we go!&lt;/poem&gt;
The origins of this rhyme are unknown, but research by Brian Sibley suggests that it originated at some point prior to the First World War. The words, with some slight alterations, were later set to music by Lee Ricks and Slim Gaillard in 1948 and released by Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra as a single entitled &quot;Down by the Station&quot;. Wilbert&#x27;s answers to Christopher&#x27;s questions about the rhyme led to the creation of a short story, &quot;Edward&#x27;s Day Out&quot;, featuring Edward the Blue Engine, an old engine who is allowed out of the shed for a day. Another story about Edward followed, this time featuring Gordon the Big Engine, named after a child living on the same road who Christopher considered rather bossy.

A third story had its origins in a limerick of which Christopher was fond, and which Awdry used to introduce &quot;The Sad Story of Henry&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;Once, an engine attached to a train
Was afraid of a few drops of rain
It went into a tunnel,
And squeaked through its funnel
And never came out again.&lt;/poem&gt;
As with the previous rhyme, the origins of this are uncertain, but Awdry received a letter telling him that a similar poem had appeared in a book of children&#x27;s rhymes, published in 1902:
&lt;poem&gt;Once an engine when fixed to a train
Was alarmed at a few drops of rain,
So went &quot;puff&quot; from its funnel
Then fled to a tunnel,
And would not come out again.&lt;/poem&gt;

This story introduced popular characters Henry the Green Engine and the Fat Director. Encouraged by his wife Margaret, Awdry submitted the three stories to publishing firm Edmund Ward in Leicester in 1943. The head of the children&#x27;s books division requested a fourth story to bring the three engines together and redeem Henry, who had been bricked up in a tunnel in the previous story. Although Wilbert had not intended that the three engines live on the same railway, he complied with the request in the story &quot;Edward, Gordon and Henry&quot;. The four stories were published by Edmund Ward in 1945 as a single volume, &quot;The Three Railway Engines&quot;, illustrated by William Middleton.

Christmas 1942 saw the genesis of the character that grew to become the most famous fictional locomotive in the world. Awdry constructed a toy tank engine for Christopher, which gained the name Thomas. Stories about Thomas were requested by Christopher, and 1946 saw the publication of &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot;. This was illustrated by Reginald Payne, whom Wilbert felt to be a great improvement over Middleton. Like its predecessor, this book was a success, and Awdry was asked to write stories about James, a character who first appeared in &quot;Thomas and the Breakdown Train&quot;, the final story in &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot;. The book &quot;James the Red Engine&quot; appeared in 1948, the year in which the railways in Britain were nationalised, and from this point onwards, the Fat Director was known by his familiar title of the Fat Controller.

&quot;James the Red Engine&quot; was notable as the first book to be illustrated by C. Reginald Dalby, perhaps the most famous of the &quot;Railway Series&quot; artists, and certainly the most controversial due to the criticism later aimed at him by Awdry. Dalby illustrated every volume up to &quot;Percy the Small Engine&quot; (1956) and also produced new illustrations for &quot;The Three Railway Engines&quot; and made changes to those of &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot;.

In making the stories as real as possible, Awdry took a lot of inspiration from a number of sources in his extensive library and found the &quot;Railway Gazette&quot;″s &quot;Scrapheap&quot; column particularly useful as a source of unusual railway incidents that were recreated for &quot;The Railway Series&quot; characters.

Awdry continued working on &quot;The Railway Series&quot; until 1972, when &quot;Tramway Engines&quot; (book 26 in the series) was published. However, he had been finding it increasingly difficult to come up with ideas for new stories. After this, he felt that &quot;the well had run dry&quot; and so decided that the time had come to retire. He wrote no further &quot;Railway Series&quot; volumes but later wrote a spin-off story (&quot;Thomas&#x27; Christmas Party&quot;) for the television series, and expanded versions of some of his earlier stories, as well as writing &quot;The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways&quot;. In addition, he wrote a number of short stories and articles for the annuals.

=== Cultural context ===
Anthropomorphisation of locomotives has a literary tradition extending back at least as far as the writings of Rudyard Kipling in his 1897 story &quot;.007&quot;.

==Continuing series under Christopher Awdry==

Christopher Awdry was a keen railway enthusiast like his father. On a visit to the Nene Valley Railway he was inspired to write his first story &quot;Triple Header&quot; based on a railway man&#x27;s account of a locomotive running out of steam short of its destination. In the story, Thomas, Percy and Duck take on the Wild Nor&#x27; Wester but find it more than they can handle. Christopher wrote three further stories, &quot;Stop Thief!&quot;, &quot;Mind That Bike&quot; and &quot;Fish&quot; and showed them to his father, who encouraged Christopher to submit them for publication. At the time, work on the television adaptation was underway, and Kaye and Ward were keen to revive &quot;The Railway Series&quot;. The book &quot;Really Useful Engines&quot; was published in 1983. Wilbert had considered this title for his own 27th volume before abandoning the project.

Christopher wrote another 13 books, including the 50th anniversary volume &quot;Thomas and the Fat Controller&#x27;s Engines&quot;. He also wrote stories for the television series, notably &quot;More About Thomas the Tank Engine&quot;, &quot;The Railway Series&quot; 30th volume.

The success of the television series led to tensions between Christopher and the publishers. Thomas was the central character of the television series and the publishers wanted stories focused on Thomas. Christopher produced &quot;Thomas and the Fat Controller&#x27;s Engines&quot; that had one story about Thomas, while &quot;Thomas Comes Home&quot; did not feature Thomas until the last page.

The series&#x27; 40th volume, &quot;New Little Engine&quot;, was published in 1996. Egmont Publishing who had taken over from Kay and Ward, did not publish further &quot;Railway Series&quot; books and allowed the existing back catalogue to go out of print. There was a selected print run in 2004 of the original 26 books, but in 2005, the sixtieth anniversary of Wilbert&#x27;s first book, the Awdry family were disappointed that not all of the stories were available in their original format.

In 2005, Christopher published &quot;Sodor: Reading Between the Lines&quot; under his own imprint Sodor Enterprises. This book expanded the fictional world of Sodor. He published several more books, mostly set on real railways in Britain. In 2006, Egmont started to re-publish Wilbert&#x27;s books in their original format. The fourteen books written by Christopher were re-released in August 2007. On 3 September, Christopher published the 41st book in the series, &quot;Thomas and Victoria&quot;, illustrated by Clive Spong. The book addresses issues relating to the railway preservation movement.

In July 2011, Egmont released the 42nd book in the series: &quot;Thomas and his Friends&quot;. The final story ended with the words &quot;The end&quot;.

Christopher Awdry said that he had other material, which he hoped would be published. He narrated new stories about the narrow-gauge engines on &quot;Duncan Days&quot; at the Talyllyn Railway in Wales.

==Illustrators==
&quot;The Railway Series&quot; is perhaps as highly regarded for its illustrations as for its writing, which in the immediate post-Second World War era were seen as uniquely vivid and colourful. Indeed, some critics (notably Miles Kington) have claimed that the quality of the illustrations outshines that of the writing.

The first edition of &quot;The Three Railway Engines&quot; was illustrated by the artist William Middleton, with whom Awdry was deeply dissatisfied. The second artist to work on the series was Reginald Payne, who illustrated &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine&quot; in a far more realistic style. Despite an early disagreement as to how Thomas should look, Awdry was ultimately pleased with the pictures produced.

Payne later suffered a nervous breakdown and proved impossible to contact to illustrate &quot;James the Red Engine&quot;, so C. Reginald Dalby was hired. Dalby also illustrated the next eight books in the series. &quot;The Three Railway Engines&quot; was reprinted with Dalby&#x27;s artwork replacing William Middleton&#x27;s and Dalby also touched up Payne&#x27;s artwork in the second book. Dalby&#x27;s work on the series proved popular with readers, but not with the author, who repeatedly clashed with him over issues of accuracy and consistency. Dalby resigned from the series in 1956, following an argument over the portrayal of Percy the Small Engine in the book of the same name. Awdry had built a model of Percy as a reference for the artist, but Dalby did not make use of it. Despite the tempestuous relationship with Awdry, Dalby is probably the best remembered of the series&#x27; artists.

With &quot;The Eight Famous Engines&quot; (1957), John T. Kenney took over the illustration of the series. His style was less colourful but more realistic than Dalby&#x27;s. Kenney made use of Awdry&#x27;s model engines as a reference. As a result of his commitment to realism and technical accuracy, he enjoyed a far more comfortable working relationship with Awdry, which lasted until &quot;Gallant Old Engine&quot; (1962), when Kenney&#x27;s eyesight began to deteriorate.

The artist initially chosen to replace him was the Swedish artist Gunvor Edwards. She began illustrating &quot;Stepney the &quot;Bluebell&quot; Engine&quot;, but felt unsuited to the work. She was assisted for that volume by her husband Peter, who effectively took over from then on. Both artists retained credit for the work, and the &quot;Edwards era&quot; lasted until Wilbert Awdry&#x27;s last volume, &quot;Tramway Engines&quot;. The style used in these volumes was still essentially realistic but had something of an impressionistic feel.

When Christopher took over as author of the series in 1983, the publisher was keen to find an illustrator who would provide work that had the gem-like appeal of Dalby&#x27;s pictures, but also had the realism of Kenney and Edwards&#x27; artwork. The artist chosen was Clive Spong. He illustrated all of Christopher Awdry&#x27;s books, a greater number than any other artist working on &quot;The Railway Series&quot;. He also produced illustrations for a number of spin-off stories written by the Awdrys, and his artwork was used in &quot;The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways&quot;.

==Sodor==

The Rev. W. Awdry received numerous letters from young fans asking questions about the engines and their railway, as well as letters concerning inconsistencies within the stories. In an effort to answer these, he began to develop a specific setting for the books. On a visit to the Isle of Man, he discovered that the bishop there is known as the Bishop of Sodor and Man. The &quot;Sodor&quot; part of the title comes from the Sudreys, but Awdry decided that a fictional island between the Isle of Man and England by that name would be an ideal setting for his stories.

In partnership with his brother George (the librarian of the National Liberal Club), he gradually devised Sodor&#x27;s history, geography, language, industries and even geology. The results were published in the book &quot;The Island of Sodor: Its People, History and Railways&quot; in 1987.

==Cameo appearances==
The Awdrys both wrote about Sodor as if it were a real place that they visited, and that the stories were obtained first-hand. This was often &quot;documented&quot; in the foreword to each book. In some of W. Awdry&#x27;s later books he appeared as the Thin Clergyman and was described as a writer, though his name and connections to the series were never made explicit. He was invariably accompanied by the Fat Clergyman, based on the Rev. Teddy Boston, who was a fellow railway enthusiast and close friend. The two Clergymen were portrayed as railway enthusiasts, and were responsible for annoying the Small Engines and discovering Duke the Lost Engine. They were often figures of fun, liable to be splashed with water or to fall through a roof.

Awdry also appeared in a number of illustrations, usually as a joke on the part of the illustrator. In one illustration by John T. Kenney in &quot;Duck and the Diesel Engine&quot; he appears with a figure who bears a strong resemblance to C. Reginald Dalby, which Brian Sibley has suggested might be a dig at Dalby&#x27;s inaccurate rendition of the character of Duck. A vicar appears in &quot;Edward the Blue Engine&quot; and other volumes as the owner of Trevor the Traction Engine. This may be a reference to Teddy Boston, who had himself saved a traction engine from scrap..

Dalby illustrated the entire Awdry family – Wilbert, Margaret, Christopher, Veronica and Hilary – watching Percy pass through a station (&quot;Percy runs away&quot; in &quot;Troublesome Engines&quot; (p53)). This was Christopher Awdry&#x27;s only appearance in an illustration, but he often described meetings with the engines in the book forewords, usually with some degree of humour.

Other people associated with &quot;The Railway Series&quot; were also referenced. In Dalby&#x27;s books, he made allusions to himself twice on store signs (Seen in &quot;Off the Rails&quot; and &quot;Saved from Scrap&quot;) and a reference to E.T.L. Marriott, who edited &quot;The Railway Series&quot;, in &quot;Percy Takes the Plunge&quot; on a &quot;Ship Chandlers&quot; company sign. Peter Edwards also notes that he based Gordon&#x27;s face on Eric Marriot&#x27;s.

The Fat Controller (originally The Fat Director in the earliest books which pre-dated the nationalisation of Britain&#x27;s railways in 1948) was a fictional character, although Christopher Awdry has conceded that his doctor at the time may have provided an &#x27;unconscious contribution&#x27; for his father. The Thin Controller, in charge of the narrow-gauge engines in the books was based on Mr Edward Thomas, the manager of the Talyllyn Railway in its last years before enthusiasts took it over in 1951.

A number of the stories are based on articles which appeared in railway enthusiast publications of the period. The monthly &quot;Railway Magazine&quot; was a long-running enthusiasts&#x27; companion and the origins of several stories can be recognised. The railway books written by C. Hamilton Ellis, were another source.

==Preservation movement==
Awdry used the books to promote steam railways in the United Kingdom. The Skarloey Railway was based on the Talyllyn Railway in Wales, where he volunteered. The Skarloey books often included a promotion for the Talyllyn Railway, either in the stories themselves, or in a footnote or the foreword. Some of the illustrations in the books depict recognisable locations on the Talyllyn Railway.

From the 1980s onwards, the Talyllyn Railway occasionally repainted one of their locomotives to resemble its Skarloey Railway &quot;twin&quot;. As well as paint schemes and names taken from the books&#x27; artwork, these locomotives are fitted with fibreglass &quot;faces&quot;. These characters&#x27; appearances have been written into &quot;The Railway Series&quot; by Christopher Awdry in the form of visits by the fictional engines to the Talyllyn Railway.

Two other railways on Sodor are based on real railways: The Culdee Fell Railway is based on the Snowdon Mountain Railway and the Arlesdale Railway is based on the Ravenglass and Eskdale Railway in Cumbria.

From &quot;Duck and the Diesel Engine&quot; onwards, a number of real engines and railways were explicitly featured. Flying Scotsman, City of Truro, Stepney and Wilbert were all real locomotives that appeared in &quot;The Railway Series&quot;, the latter two having books dedicated to them: &quot;Stepney the &quot;Bluebell&quot; Engine&quot; and Christopher Awdry&#x27;s &quot;Wilbert the Forest Engine&quot;. Wilbert&#x27;s appearance was of particular significance as the locomotive was named in tribute to Wilbert Awdry who was the president of the Dean Forest Railway at the time.

In &quot;Thomas and the Great Railway Show&quot;, Thomas visited the National Railway Museum in York, and several of the museum&#x27;s locomotives are featured including Mallard, Duchess of Hamilton, Stephenson&#x27;s Rocket, Iron Duke and Green Arrow. At the end of this book, Thomas is made an honorary member of the National Collection.

==Books==
The following table lists the titles of all 42 books in &quot;The Railway Series&quot;.


==References in popular culture==
Satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; produced a book called &quot;Thomas the Privatised Tank Engine&quot;, written in the style of &quot;The Railway Series&quot;. The stories were strongly critical of private railway companies and the Government of John Major, and covered subjects such as the Channel Tunnel, London Underground, transport of radioactive waste and the perceived dangerous state of the railways.

Andrew Lloyd Webber wanted to produce a musical television series based on &quot;The Railway Series&quot;, but Awdry refused to give him the control he wanted. Lloyd Webber would go on to compose the 1984 musical &quot;Starlight Express&quot;, and create The Really Useful Group, a name inspired by the catchphrase &quot;Really Useful Engines&quot;.

There have been three adaptations of the series produced. The first was an unsuccessful pilot in 1953, which was filmed live and had a number of technical errors. Around three decades later came the &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends&quot; series, which premiered in 1984 and concluded in 2021. This was followed by &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends: All Engines Go!&quot;, a spin-off of the previous series which uses 2D animation and a more cartoonish style.

<doc id="1213135" wikidata="Q1820450" url="?curid=1213135" title="Les Apaches">
<text>Les Apaches (or Société des Apaches) was a group of musicians, writers and artists which formed in Paris, France, in 1903. The core was formed by the French composer Maurice Ravel, the Spanish pianist Ricardo Viñes and the writer and critic Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi. The group was private but never formal, and the wider membership was fluid; over 20 unofficial members would attend meetings of Les Apaches until it came to an end during World War I. During their active years, &quot;Les Apaches&quot; met weekly. The meetings were a chance for the members to perform and show new works or ideas to a small group, discuss contemporary artistic interests and collaborate.

== Origins ==
In the early 20th century the term &quot;Les Apaches&quot; was used to describe European street gangs who were of intense interest to the French media at the time. Supposedly, the term was adopted by the diverse circle of artists after a newspaper seller mockingly called &quot;attention! Les Apaches&quot; as members of the group were returning from the premiere of Claude Debussy&#x27;s opera &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, a work they praised and rallied around. It is possible that this was an ironic insult or a reference to their modernist artistic output. They found the name amusing, especially as they saw art as being at odds with conservative tastes.

The precise beginnings of the group are unclear. Many of the regular members were approximate contemporaries, most had met previously and some had been friends for over a decade; four members had been taught by the French composer Gabriel Fauré and it is likely that some of the other artists had met at the
École des beaux-arts or in Salon exhibitions. Throughout 1901, Émile Vuillermoz hosted regular musical events at his home, and members had gathered at events such as the premiere of Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Jeux d&#x27;eau&quot; - by the time the group was calling itself &quot;Les Apaches&quot; there was already a circle of artists who met regularly.

== Active years ==

From around 1903, the group met each Saturday. For several years, the meetings usually took place in the city studio of the painter Paul Sordes (dubbed &#x27;Ravel with a palette&#x27;), a neighbor of the composer Claude Debussy. They later moved to a property that the French composer Maurice Delage rented. Ravel suggested that they adopt the first melody of Borodin&#x27;s 2nd Symphony as their theme, an idea with which they all agreed. To enter Sordes&#x27; apartment or attract the attention of other Apaches after concerts, the member would have to whistle the first few bars of the music; Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Scheherazade&quot; was the initial choice, although it was deemed too difficult to whistle.

Many in the group were amateurs and enthusiasts of the arts from which they did not make a living, and so the members were not limited to one artistic faction within &quot;Les Apaches&quot;. The meetings were lively, and would often last until the early hours of the morning; they would discuss art, argue about contemporary issues, perform music for each other (Viñes being the favoured pianist), play duets together, read poetry, drink coffee and smoke. Symbolism, Javanese music, Russian composers, Edgar Allan Poe, Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Cézanne were all topics that fascinated &quot;Les Apaches&quot;. The music of Debussy was a particular passion. Ideas and fragments of larger unfinished works would often be performed or shown at the meetings; this mingling of ideas would influence several &quot;Apaches&quot; and lead to various artistic collaborations. The meetings of the group were vibrant occasions, and when other neighbors complained about the noise so late at night, the group began meeting in a more isolated hut rented by Delage, which they called their &#x27;wigwam&#x27;. Outside of the meetings, the members would support each other; Viñes premiered works by the composers, the critics would encourage new music, and the poets would collaborate with the musicians to set words to music. 
The wider membership of the group was always shifting. The group (or as they called themselves, &#x27;the band&#x27;) attracted many members during its existence, some who would meet with the group occasionally, and others whose association with &quot;Les Apaches&quot; was brief. Despite this somewhat fluid nature of &quot;Les Apaches&quot;, the group was highly exclusive in other ways; women were strictly forbidden. Due to the nature of the group, many of the members became close. Ravel, who dedicated each movement of &quot;Miroirs&quot; to a member of &quot;Les Apaches&quot;, used the French familiar form &quot;tu&quot; with only three friends outside his close family - all of them were part of &quot;Les Apaches&quot;. There is speculation that the one romantic relationship in Ravel&#x27;s life was with the poet and fellow &quot;apache&quot; Léon-Paul Fargue.

In 1910, the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky became a member of &quot;Les Apaches&quot;. According to Stravinsky&#x27;s letters, he frequently visited Paris, staying at the home of his closest friend in the city, Maurice Delage, who helped him deliver manuscripts and set up interviews with the press. In a letter to the &quot;apache&quot; composer Florent Schmitt, Stravinsky noted that for a time he only listened to the music of Ravel, Schmitt, and Debussy.

Although some of the members remained friends, the meetings petered out during World War I and eventually stopped altogether.

=== Debussy and Les Apaches ===

Contrary to popular belief, Claude Debussy was never part of &quot;Les Apaches&quot;. However, the music of Debussy was of particular importance within &quot;Les Apaches&quot;, who all greatly admired his compositions, supporting them when they received unfavourable reviews. &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; was a work they openly admired despite the mixed critical reception. Ravel was a particular fan, attending every one of the opera&#x27;s performances in its first run - a total of fourteen.

Debussy&#x27;s music also featured in the meetings held by &quot;Les Apaches&quot;. Ravel had made transcriptions of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Nocturnes&quot; and his &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; for two pianos and piano duet respectively, compositions praised by fellow &quot;Apaches&quot;. Although Debussy was not close with any one of the &quot;Apaches&quot;, he was acquainted with several members. The most notable relationship Debussy had with an Apache was Viñes, with whom Debussy had a professional relationship for several years. Viñes (a pianist Debussy admired) regularly premiered Debussy works and, during his regular meetings with Debussy, Viñes would perform works by Ravel for him. Through Viñes, &quot;Les Apaches&quot; were indirectly linked with Debussy.

Ravel was often compared with Debussy, and the followers of the composers began to form rough factions; those who supported the younger Ravel, and those who defended Debussy. Similarities in the music of the two composers, as well as the association through Viñes, lead to accusations of plagiarism by Ravel. &quot;Les Apaches&quot; had always been avid supporters of Debussy, although made a point of defending Ravel when it was claimed that he had imitated Debussy.

<text>Nascent Iodine sometimes known by the generic term atomic iodine or generic trademark name Atomidine or by the detoxified iodine, is a liquid orally administered supplemental form of iodine, claimed to be in the monatomic state, originating from a 1931 Edgar Cayce formula. There is no evidence that &quot;Nascent Iodine&quot; is in any way distinct or superior to tincture of iodine. The promotion of &quot;Nascent Iodine&quot; is a form of quackery.

==Criticism==
In 1929 the FDA Bureau of Chemistry stated on &quot;Atomidine&quot; advertised health claims &quot;As far as our records go, all of these claims are without a scintilla of printed scientific evidence to substantiate the claim that Atomidine is superior or even the equal to tincture of iodine...&quot;.

The concept of nascent state is obsolete. Thus, the name nascent iodine is a misrepresentation.

<text>Anxiety Always is an album released by the Detroit, Michigan electronic duo ADULT. in September 2003. Although the band had released the album &quot;Resuscitation&quot; in 2001, this release is considered to be their true full-length debut album, as &quot;Resuscitation&quot; was essentially a compilation of past single releases.

ADULT. consists of instrumentalist Adam Lee Miller and vocalist Nicola Kuperus. Kuperus is also a visual artist and provided the album&#x27;s cover art photography. Upon its release &quot;Anxiety Always&quot; received positive reviews from critics, who praised the duo&#x27;s expansion of their mostly-synthesizer-based sound, as the album contains prominent guitar and bass guitar elements.

&quot;Anxiety Always&quot; was released independently by Miller and Kurperus on their Ersatz Audio record label.

<text>The Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, Virginia, was the biggest ironworks in the Confederacy during the American Civil War, and a significant factor in the decision to make Richmond the Confederate capital.

Tredegar supplied about half the artillery used by the Confederate States Army, as well as the iron plating for CSS &quot;Virginia&quot;, the first Confederate ironclad warship, which fought in the historic Battle of Hampton Roads in March 1862. The works avoided destruction by troops during the evacuation of the city, and continued production through the mid-20th century. Now classified as a National Historic Landmark District, the site serves as the main building of the American Civil War Museum.

The name Tredegar derives from the Welsh industrial town that supplied much of the company&#x27;s early workforce.

==History==
===Founding (1836–1841)===

In 1836, a group of Richmond businessmen and industrialists led by Francis B. Deane, Jr. set about to capitalize on the growing railroad boom in the United States. The group hired Rhys Davies, then a young engineer, to construct a new facility, brought a number of his fellow iron workers from Tredegar, Wales, to construct the furnaces and rolling mills. The foundry was named in honor of the town of Tredegar, where iron works of the same name were constructed in the early 19th century. The new works opened in 1837, yet the Panic of 1837 and accompanying downturn resulted in hardship for the new company. Davies died in Richmond in September 1838 from stab wounds sustained in a fight with a workman and was buried on Belle Isle in the James River.

===Management under Joseph Reid Anderson (1841 – Civil War)===

In 1841, the owners turned management over to a 28-year-old civil engineer named Joseph Reid Anderson who proved to be an able manager. Anderson acquired ownership of the foundry in 1848, after two years of leasing the works, and was soon doing work for the United States government. Anderson began introducing slave labor to cut production costs. By the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, half of the 900 workers were slaves, including many in skilled positions. By 1860, Anderson&#x27;s father-in-law Dr. Robert Archer had joined the business and Tredegar became a leading iron producer in the country.

The commissioning of 900 miles of railroad track in Virginia, largely financed by the Virginia Board of Public Works between 1846 and 1853, offered a further market in steam locomotives and rail stock. One of those attributed with starting the Tredegar Locomotive Works with John Souther was Zerah Colburn, the well-known locomotive engineer and journalist. The company produced about 70 steam locomotives between 1850 and 1860. From 1852 to 1854, John Souther also managed the locomotive shop at Tredegar. Its locomotive production work is sometimes listed with combinations of the names Anderson, Souther, Delaney, and Pickering. Tredegar also produced the steam propulsion plants for the USS &quot;Roanoke&quot; (1855) and the USS &quot;Colorado&quot; (1856).

Prior to the Civil War, industry expanded at the Tredegar site under Anderson&#x27;s direction to include a new flour mill on land leased to Lewis D. Crenshaw and a stove works on land leased to A.J. Bowers and Asa Snyder. By 1860, Crenshaw and Co. had established the Crenshaw Woolen Mill on adjoining land they owned. This enterprise employed more than 50 people. The Crenshaw Woolen Mill became &quot;the principal source of supply for the [Confederate] Army&#x27;s requirements of uniform material&quot; during the first half of the Civil War. A May 16, 1863 fire on the Tredegar/Crenshaw site damaged the mill, which was not rebuilt, and Tredegar purchased the land from Crenshaw and Co. by 1863.

===American Civil War===

By 1860, the Tredegar Iron Works was the largest of its kind in the South, a fact that played a significant role in the decision to relocate the capital of the Confederacy from Montgomery, Alabama, to Richmond in May 1861. Tredegar supplied high-quality munitions to the Confederacy throughout the war, until the capture of Richmond in 1865.

Its wartime production included the iron plating for the first Confederate ironclad warship, the CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; which fought in the historic Battle of Hampton Roads in ; credit for approximately 1,100 artillery pieces during the war, about half of the South&#x27;s total domestic production of artillery during the war years of 1861–1865, including the development and production of Brooke rifles; large rifled cannons intended for the nascent CSA Navy and an answer to the rifled, armor piercing, Dahlgren Guns favored by the Union. One Brook Rifle was even used as a rail-mounted siege cannon. The company also manufactured railroad steam locomotives in the same period.

As a result of his difficulties competing with Northern industries due to his higher labor and raw material costs, Anderson was a strong supporter of southern secession and became a Brigadier General in the Confederate Army as the war broke out. He was wounded at Glendale during the Seven Days Battles of the Peninsula Campaign in 1862 and served in the Ordnance Department for the duration of the Civil War.

As the war continued with more and more men conscripted into the Confederate armies, Tredegar experienced a lack of skilled laborers. Scarce supplies of metal also hurt the company&#x27;s manufacturing abilities during the war, and as the conflict progressed it was noticed that Tredegar&#x27;s products were beginning to lose quality as well as quantity. Even in the summer of 1861, soon after the beginning of the Civil War, metal was so scarce that the iron works failed to produce a single piece of artillery for an entire month.

By 1864, Tredegar was producing nine different types of projectiles for the Confederacy, compounded by the many types of foreign built and captured weapons. Then in June 1864, Hunter&#x27;s cavalry destroyed the company&#x27;s best gun iron furnaces, drastically reducing ordnance production by July and August when existing stockpiles ran out. Thus it cast 128 weapons during the first six months of 1864, but only 85 pieces during the last half of the year, and most of those guns were of questionable quality. Worse yet, Anderson noted that because of the depreciated Confederate currency and the government&#x27;s failure to pay invoices (the Niter and Mining Bureau alone owed the firm $300,000, plus the Ordnance Department had not paid its account since October 4 and the navy and Railroad Bureau were also deeply in arrears). Thus, in December Tredegar on many occasions requested the government take over its blast furnace (and the problem of acquiring and provisioning slaves), but even after extensive negotiations (and a 2 week shutdown for repairs in early January, the company&#x27;s financial distress only grew, with over $1 million in outstanding bills by February 1, 1865, and Anderson had to borrow $100,000 to meet its first payroll for the month.
During the evacuation of Richmond by the Confederates on the night of April 2–3, 1865, the retreating troops were under orders to burn munitions dumps and industrial warehouses that would have been valuable to the North. The Tredegar battalion defended the works despite widespread looting in the nearby warehouse district. However, despite Gorgas&#x27; order not to destroy ordnance facilities, the mob set fire to the arsenal, causing an explosion that shattered nearly every window. Nonetheless, facing resistance at the plant itself, the mob retreated to the town center. As a result, the Tredegar Iron Works is one of few Civil War-era buildings that survived the burning of Richmond. 

===After the Civil War===
At the outset of hostilities, Anderson had wisely secured Tredegar assets overseas for the duration of the Civil War and, therefore, was able to restore his business when the Confederate currency collapsed. He petitioned U.S. President Andrew Johnson for a pardon for himself and Tredegar and was back in business before the end of 1865, regaining full ownership in 1867. That same year, Tredegar incorporated with a stock of $1,000,000.

Francis Thomas Glasgow, the father of Virginia writer and suffragist Ellen Glasgow, was a manager at Tredegar Iron Works, and Joseph Reid Anderson was her maternal uncle.

By 1873, Tredegar Iron Works was employing 1,200 workers and was a profitable business. However, the Panic of 1873 hit the company hard, and as a result of financing difficulties it did not transition to steel, and so faded from national prominence.

The neighborhood of Oregon Hill cropped up as a company town-like development. When Joseph Anderson died on a vacation in New Hampshire in 1892, he was succeeded by his son Colonel Archer Anderson. The Tredegar company remained in business throughout the first half of the 20th century, and supplied requirements of the armed forces of the United States during World War I and World War II. In 1957, Anderson&#x27;s descendants sold the land to Ethyl Corporation, which began restoration of some of the surviving structures.

==Preservation as a Civil War museum site and tourist attraction==

In the 21st century, the buildings at the Tredegar site have been preserved through development of the site to commemorate the Civil War. The site is also used for various festivals and public events such as the Richmond Folk Festival.

The Pattern Building is used as the main visitors&#x27; center for Richmond National Battlefield Park. The American Civil War Museum at Historic Tredegar is a separate museum at the former Tredegar Ironworks.

===Valentine Riverside===
In the 1990s, the Court End-based Valentine Museum opened a second museum site at the Tredegar Ironworks. The focus of the museum experience was industrial history. Interpretive tours to and from the site covered industrial history, African American history, and Civil War history. The venture, however, was short-lived. The &quot;Valentine on the James&quot; opened on Memorial Day 1994 and closed to the public on Labor Day 1995.

===Civil War Visitor Center at Tredegar Iron Works ===
The main visitor center for Richmond National Battlefield Park opened at the Tredegar Iron Works site in . The Civil War Visitor Center at Tredegar Iron Works is located in the restored pattern building and offers three floors of exhibits, an interactive map table, a film about the Civil War battles around Richmond, a bookstore, and interpretive NPS rangers on site daily to provide programs and to aid visitors.

===Lincoln statue ===

In 2000, the former Tredegar Iron Works facility overlooking the James River near downtown Richmond became the site of the main Visitor&#x27;s Center of the Richmond National Battlefield Park. Sculptor David Frech of Newburgh, New York, was commissioned by The United States Historical Society of Richmond to commemorate the historic arrival of Abraham Lincoln and his son Tad Lincoln and their tour of the burnt-out Union-captured Richmond, Virginia, April 4, 1865, 10 days before his assassination.

Funds were raised by the Historical society through donations and the selling of miniature versions of the statue as well as bronzed resin copies. The statue, much like the Arthur Ashe Monument, received a wide array of criticism for its placement. Traditionally reserved for statues of key figures of the Confederacy protests were held at the unveiling April 5, 2003, namely by the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Robert H. Kline, chairman of the historical society, the Richmond-based nonprofit company that commissioned the statue stated that the statue was for the purpose of reconciliation &quot;He came on a mission of peace and reconciliation and I think the statue will serve that purpose for a very long time.&quot;

Dignitaries at the installation ceremony included former governors Douglas Wilder and Gerald L. Baliles, former mayor of Richmond, then-Lt. Governor, and future Governor Tim Kaine, and then-Mayor of Richmond Rudy McCollum. The dedication ceremony was buzzed by a plane trailing a banner proclaiming &quot;Sic semper tyrannis&quot;, which is not only Virginia&#x27;s motto (meaning &quot;Thus always to tyrants&quot;), but also what John Wilkes Booth, according to his diary, called out while assassinating Lincoln.

The statue is made of a bronze cast depicting Lincoln and his son Tad on a bench with Lincoln&#x27;s arm around his son. The bench was deliberately made long enough so that viewers may sit next to either statue on the bench to take photographs. The words &quot;To Bind Up The Nation&#x27;s Wounds&quot; from Lincoln&#x27;s Second Inaugural Address are carved into granite behind them.

===American Civil War Center at Historic Tredegar===
The idea of another museum on the site was realized in 2006 when the American Civil War Center at Historic Tredegar opened to the public. James M. McPherson described the museum as &quot;a truly comprehensive exhibit and education center weaving together Union, Confederate, and African-American threads ... much needed for future generations to understand how the Civil War shaped the nation.&quot; The Center contains interactive theaters, plasma-screen maps, and artifacts. The museum&#x27;s exhibits were put together by a team of historians that included James M. McPherson of Princeton, Bill Cooper of Louisiana State University, John Fleming of the Cincinnati Museum Center, Charles Dew of Williams College, David W. Blight of Yale and Emory Thomas at the University of Georgia. In November 2013 the Civil War Center was merged with the Museum of the Confederacy and became the American Civil War Museum in January 2014.

<text>KMD (&quot;K.M.D.&quot;, &quot;Kausing Much Damage&quot;, or &quot;A Positive Kause in a Much Damaged Society&quot;) was an American hip hop trio active from 1988 to 1994, during the golden age. The core of the group was composed of brothers Daniel &quot;Zev Love X&quot; Dumile and Dingilizwe &quot;DJ Subroc&quot; Dumile. The group&#x27;s original third member, Jade 1 (believed to later be known as Rodan), left before the group signed with Elektra Records, being replaced with Onyx the Birthstone Kid. The group dissolved in 1994 following the sudden death of DJ Subroc in 1993, the departure of Onyx and conflicts with Elektra that resulted in them being dropped from the label.

KMD released two studio albums, &quot;Mr. Hood&quot; (1991) and &quot;Black Bastards&quot;; the latter of which was recorded in 1993 and not officially released until 2000. Zev Love X subsequently changed his moniker to MF DOOM and achieved success as a solo artist. MF DOOM attempted to revive the KMD name in the 2010s, releasing two new songs, &quot;Sorcerers&quot; and &quot;True Lightyears&quot;, and announcing a comeback album in 2017, but no further updates or recordings surfaced before his death in October 2020.

== History ==
Zev Love X, DJ Subroc, and Jade 1 formed KMD in Long Beach, New York, in 1988. The three were Black Muslims active in the Nuwaubian Nation. KMD began as a graffiti crew; they also practiced breakdance.

Onyx the Birthstone Kid soon replaced Jade 1, who left the group in order to finish high school. MC Serch, a native of nearby Far Rockaway, met the group at community functions and recruited them for a guest spot on &quot;The Gas Face,&quot; a single off 3rd Bass&#x27; &quot;The Cactus Album&quot;. The guest appearance caught the attention of A&amp;R executive Dante Ross, who signed KMD to Elektra Records.

KMD released their debut album &quot;Mr. Hood&quot; in 1991. Its songs focus on racism and black empowerment in a comical manner. Subroc heavily sampled old children&#x27;s television shows and recordings, including drops of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; character Bert on the singles &quot;Who Me?&quot; and &quot;Humrush.&quot; Skits featuring KMD interacting with &quot;Mr. Hood&quot; (a series of samples from a language instruction tape) tie the album together. Stimulated Dummies co-produced &quot;Mr. Hood&quot;; the album also featured fellow Five Percenters, Brand Nubian appearing on &quot;Nitty Gritty.&quot; Around the same time &quot;Mr. Hood&quot; was released, Zev Love X and Onyx testified before the United States Congress in support of the National Voter Registration Act, on behalf of Rock the Vote.

The group recorded their follow up, &quot;Black Bastards&quot;, in 1993. The album was a departure from their lighthearted previous release with songs celebrating sex (&quot;Plumskinnz&quot;), drugs (&quot;Smokin&#x27; That S*#%&quot;, &quot;Contact Blitz&quot;, &quot;Suspended Animation&quot;), and drinking (&quot;Sweet Premium Wine&quot;). Onyx left the group during the recording sessions. His verse was removed from &quot;Plumskinzz&quot; (the B-side to the &quot;Nitty Gritty&quot; single off &quot;Mr. Hood&quot;), which was included on &quot;Black Bastards&quot; as two separate tracks, &quot;Plumskinzz.(Loose Hoe, God&amp;Cupid)&quot; (Zev Love X&#x27;s verse) and &quot;Plumskinzz.(Oh No I Don&#x27;t Believe It!)&quot; (Subroc&#x27;s verse). Zev Love X created the cover art, a Sambo caricature being hanged in a game of hangman.

Shortly before finishing &quot;Black Bastards&quot;, Subroc was killed while attempting to cross the 878 Nassau Expressway on April 23, 1993. Zev Love X completed the album alone over the course of the next months and advance copies were finally sent out in early 1994. &quot;What a Nigga Know?&quot; was released as the first single in March that same year and &quot;Black Bastards&quot; was announced to be released on May 3, 1994. Soon afterwards Elektra Records unexpectedly cancelled the album and dropped KMD. The album&#x27;s title and cover art proved too controversial for Elektra&#x27;s management, who instructed Dante Ross to give Zev Love X the &quot;Black Bastards&quot; master tapes and $20,000 as incentive to leave the label. The album was heavily bootlegged until it was officially released on ReadyRock Records in 2000. Zev Love X dropped out of the New York hip hop scene until 1997, when he reemerged as MF DOOM.

On August 16, 2017, MF DOOM premiered the first new KMD track in eight years, &quot;True Lightyears&quot;, on NPR Music. It was the first single from KMD&#x27;s still-unreleased comeback album &quot;Crack In Time&quot; and featured Jay Electronica and MF DOOM. The track was also released as part of MF DOOM&#x27;s 2017 compilation album &quot;The Missing Notebook Rhymes&quot;.

MF DOOM died on October 31, 2020, with the cause of death originally not being revealed. In July 2023 it has been reported that DOOM died of angioedema.

<text>Anandamath ( &quot;Anondomôţh&quot;) ( The Abbey of Bliss) is a Bengali historical novel, written by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay and published in 1882. It is inspired by and set in the background of the Sannyasi Rebellion in the late 18th century, it is considered one of the most important novels in the history of Bengali and Indian literature.

&quot;Vande Mataram&quot;, &quot;Hail to the Motherland &quot;, first song to represent India – as the Motherland was published in this novel.

==Plot summary==
The book is set in the years during the famine in Bengal in 1770 CE. It starts with introduction to a couple, Mahendra and Kalyani, who are stuck in their village &quot;Padachinha&quot; without food and water in a time of famine. They decide to leave their village and move to the next closest city where there is a better chance of survival. While doing so, the couple become separated and Kalyani has to run through the forest with her infant to avoid getting caught by robbers. After a long chase, she loses consciousness at the bank of a river. A Hindu &quot;Santana&quot; (who were not true sanyasis but common people who took the symbol of sanyasis and left their household so as to rebel against the British East India Company) named Jiban takes the infant to his home, handing her to his sister, while he moves Kalyani to his ashram.

The husband, Mahendra, at this point is more inclined towards joining the brotherhood of the monks and serving the Mother Nation. Kalyani wants to help him attain his dreams by trying to kill herself, thereby relieving him of worldly duties. At this point, Mahatma Satya joins her but before he can help her, he is arrested by the East India Company soldiers, because other monks were fuelling the revolt against Company rule. While being dragged away he spots another monk who is not wearing his distinctive robes and sings,
The other monk deciphers the song, rescues Kalyani and the baby, and takes them to a rebel monk hideout. Concurrently, Mahendra is also given shelter by the monks; thus Mahendra and Kalyani are reunited. The leader of the rebels shows Mahendra the three faces of &quot;Bharat Mata&quot; (Mother India) as three goddess idols being worshipped in three consecutive rooms:
# What Mother was – an idol of goddess Jagaddhatri, referring to the past glory of Bengal/India
# What Mother has become – an idol of goddess Kali, a reference to the economic exploitation of the land &amp; the famine
# What Mother will be – an idol of goddess Durga, referring to their vision for a future India.

Gradually, the rebel influence grows and their ranks swell. Emboldened, they shift their headquarters to a small brick fort. The East India Company troops attack the fort with a large force. The rebels blockade the bridge over the nearby river, but they lack any artillery or military training. In the fighting, the troops make a tactical retreat over the bridge. The &quot;Sanyasis&quot;&#x27; undisciplined army, lacking military experience, chases the troops into the trap. Once the bridge is full of rebels, the East India Company artillery opens fire, inflicting severe casualties.

However, some rebels manage to capture some of the cannons, and turn the fire back on to the East India Company lines. The East India Company troops are forced to fall back, the rebels winning their first battle. The story ends with Mahendra and Kalyani building a home again, with Mahendra continuing to support the rebels.

The song Vande Mataram is sung in this novel. Vande Mataram means &quot;I bow to thee, Mother&quot;. It inspired freedom fighters in the 20th century and its first two stanzas became the national song of India after independence.

== Characters ==
* Mahendra: A zamindar from Padachihna, who later joins the freedom struggle. A wealthy Zamindar (landed gentry), living in Padachihna with his wife (Kalyani) and daughter (Sukumari). They are forced to leave the village to find a new mode of living. Mahendra is initiated to the Anandamath by Mahatma Satya. The Guru orders Mahendra to use his wealth to manufacture ammunition for the Anandamath.
*Mahatma Satya: An ascetic who leads a band of rebels. The founder and main Guru of Anandamath, a rebel group to oppose Company rule in India. His disciples are required to renounce their attachments until India is freed. Mahatma Satya was acting upon the orders of his Guru, a mysterious saint, who explains his true motives. The Guru explains Mahatma Satya that Indians need objective knowledge from the East India Company to once more understand the subtle truths of the ancient scriptures. Mahatma Satya goes with his Guru to the Himalayas for penances.
*Bhavan: A brave commander of Anandamath who dies during the battle against the East India Company.
*Jiban: A member of the band of rebels and a brave warrior. The most accomplished and loyal disciple of Mahatma Satya . He rescues Mahendra&#x27;s family and reunites them. His wife and lover, Shanti, later becomes the first and only woman to join the Anandamath and fights alongside Jiban . In the end Jiban is grievously injured in battle but is revived by Shanti. The young married couple decide to go on a pilgrimage and live as ascetics.
* Nabin a.k.a. Shanti: She is the tomboyish daughter of a Brahmin and is well educated. Shanti was orphaned at a young age and became physically fit and strong. Shanti met Jiban who married her out of pity as Shanti had no one to take care of her. Jiban left Shanti as a part of renouncing his attachments and to fight for Anandamath. Shanti is left in the care of Jiban&#x27;s married sister, Nimmi . However, Shanti is deeply in love with her husband and cannot bear to live away from him. She disguises herself as a man and joins Anandamath as a freedom fighter. Mahatma Satya tries to forbid her from entering, but he is shocked at Shanti&#x27;s physical strength when she strings a mighty bow which only he, Jiban, Bhavan and Jnan were the only Sannyasis to be able to do so. Mahatma Satya also allows Shanti to stay and gives her the name Nabin . Shanti rescues Kalyani from dacoits. She gathers intelligence from the East India Company and fights in battles alongside her husband. At the end of the battle, at nightfall, Shanti discovers Jiban&#x27;s seemingly lifeless body and grieves for him. Mahatma Satya gives Shanti a herb, with which she revives Jiban. Shanti suggests Jiban that they go on a pilgrimage and live together in a forest as ascetics, to which her husband reluctantly agrees.

==Commentary==
The story&#x27;s setting was based on the time period around the devastating Bengal famine of 1770 during the period of Company rule in India and unsuccessful Sannyasi rebellion. In the book, Chatterjee imagines an alternative history where untrained Sannyasi soldiers defeat the experienced East India Company forces. 
==In adaptation==
===Film===
The novel was later adapted into a film, &quot;Anand Math&quot; in 1952, directed by Hemen Gupta, starring Prithviraj Kapoor, Bharat Bhushan, Pradeep Kumar, Ajit and Geeta Bali. The music was composed by Hemant Kumar, who gave a version of the Vande Mataram sung by Lata Mangeshkar, which became a cult success.

=== Other === 
It was adapted as a comic in the 655th and 10028th issue and also in a Special Issue Great Indian Classic of the Indian comic book series, Amar Chitra Katha.

<text>Playland Amusement Park is an amusement park in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The amusement park is located at Hastings Park and is operated by the Pacific National Exhibition (PNE), an organization that hosts an annual summer fair and exhibition adjacent to Playland. Playland opened at its current location in 1958, although its predecessor, Happyland, operated at Hastings Park from 1929 to 1957. Playland was formally made a division of the PNE in 1993.

Playland operates seasonally, opening from May to September every year. The park also reopens in October for its annual &quot;Fright Nights&quot; Halloween themed events. As of 2024, the park operated 40 attractions, including 4 roller coasters. Additional rides are brought in from West Coast Amusements during the PNE&#x27;s annual summer fair from mid-August to Labour Day; nearly doubling the number of rides at the park.

==History==
===Predecessor===
The Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) has hosted a number of amusement rides since it opened in 1910; with an early roller coaster installed in 1915. However, a permanent amusement complex was not built until the 1920s. Built at Hastings Park, several rides were opened by 1926, including a Shoot the Chute ride and a new roller coaster, the &quot;Giant Dipper&quot;, to replace the one built in 1915.

Although the first rides were opened by 1926, Playland&#x27;s predecessor, &quot;Happyland&quot;, did not fully open for its first regular season until 1929. Happyland was operated by several companies while it was open, including the British Columbia Amusement Company; and the Pacific Amusement Company. The park continued to operate until 1957, when amusement park operations were moved to its present location. The original site was demolished after the amusement park&#x27;s relocation; with the site later being used for Pacific Coliseum.

===Playland===

Construction for the modern amusement park occurred from December 1957 to 1958, with the park opening in time for that year&#x27;s PNE exhibition. Reopened as &quot;Playland&quot;, the park featured several new attractions including the Wooden Roller Coaster, the country&#x27;s largest at the time of its opening.

Although it was located adjacent to the PNE&#x27;s fairgrounds, the amusement park did not formally become a division of the Pacific National Exhibition until January 1993.

In 2001, the park begain operating Halloween-themed events or &quot;Fright Nights&quot; during the month of October. During this time, haunted houses are set up inside the amusement park and employed monsters are roaming the park scaring patrons. Most of the parks regular amusement rides are in operation. The haunted houses have been owned and managed by ScreamWorks Inc., a Calgary-based company. Fright Nights event and its including the haunted houses were managed by the PNE and Playland beginning in 2009.

In 2009, the Wooden Roller Coaster was designated with &quot;classic&quot; and &quot;landmark&quot; status by the American Coaster Enthusiasts.

==Attractions==

As of 2018, Playland is home to 39 attractions. Interactive attractions at Playland including a climbing wall, face painting, the Glass House funhouse, and mini golf. Playland also has a haunted house attraction and shooting gallery, although these attractions are not included in the park&#x27;s admission fee and require an additional fee for entry.

The amusement park also has an arcade and a number of carnival games; including a balloon popping darts game, ring toss, Skee-Ball, and Whac-A-Mole.

In addition to interactive attractions, the park also holds a number of amusement rides, including three roller coasters. In November 2022, the PNE announced it acquired a launched roller coaster from Zamperla for $9-million, with plans to open the new roller coaster in 2024.


===Past attractions===

Past attractions at Playland included the &quot;Nintendo Power Zone&quot;, an area where guests could play the latest games for Nintendo and PlayStation video game consoles; and a maze built out of covered chain link fencing. Corkscrew was the last roller coaster removed from the amusement park, closing in 2018.

===Temporary rides===
In addition to the permanent rides installed at the amusement park, West Coast Amusements (WCA) also brings in temporary rides to Hastings Park for the PNE&#x27;s annual fair from mid-late August to early September. WCA operates a travelling carnival circuit whose inventory includes over 100 amusement rides such as Ferris Wheels, Hurricane, Music Express, and Scrambler. However, the lineup of rides that the WCA brings to the PNE varies from year-to-year.

==Film setting==
The amusement park has been used for the filming of several films. The 1999 Canadian teen-drama film &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;, was shot at the park. The opening scenes of the horror film &quot;Final Destination 3&quot; were also shot at the park, utilizing the now-retired Corkscrew roller coaster, seen in the film as &quot;Devil&#x27;s Flight&quot;, and the Hellevator tower as &quot;High Dive&quot;. &quot;Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days&quot; was filmed at Playland for the boardwalk scene, where the Corkscrew and The Revelation (&quot;Cranium Shaker&quot; in the movie) rotating arm ride were shown along with many smaller rides. The Nickelodeon original movie &quot;Splitting Adam&quot; was also filmed at Playland, highlighting the now-retired Wave Swinger ride. The 1996 film, &quot;Fear&quot; was shot there in the summer of 1995. In 2016, &quot;The Edge of Seventeen&quot; starring Hailee Steinfeld filmed a scene with co-star Hayden Szeto featuring the Westcoast Wheel and mini-golf course along with the background scenery in screen.

<text>Electronic Music Studios (EMS) is a synthesizer company formed in Putney, London in 1969 by Peter Zinovieff, Tristram Cary and David Cockerell. It is now based in Ladock, Cornwall.

==Founders==
The founding partners had wide experience in both electronics and music. Cockerell, who was EMS&#x27; main equipment designer in its early years, was an electronics engineer and computer programmer. In the mid-1960s Zinovieff had formed the electronic music group Unit Delta Plus with Delia Derbyshire and Brian Hodgson of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Cary was a noted composer and a pioneer in electronic music—he was one of the first people in the UK to work in the musique concrete field and built one of the country&#x27;s first electronic music studios; he also worked widely in film and TV, composing scores for numerous Ealing Studios and Hammer Films productions, and he is well known for his work on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, notably on the classic serial &quot;The Daleks&quot;.

==VCS 3==
The company&#x27;s first commercial synthesiser, the VCS 3, designed by David Cockerell, was introduced in 1969. It was developed in the basement of Zinovieff&#x27;s house and was nicknamed &quot;The Putney&quot; after the London suburb where he was living at the time.

EMS&#x27; original aim was to create a versatile monophonic synthesiser that would retail for just £100. While this proved unattainable in practice, the company nevertheless succeeded in manufacturing and selling the VCS3 for just £330, less than its nearest American competitor the Minimoog (which originally retailed for US$1495 when released in 1970) and far cheaper than Moog&#x27;s modular systems, which cost thousands of dollars. EMS also released the DK1, a velocity sensitive dynamic monophonic keyboard controller for use with VCS3; this included an extra VCO and VCA and retailed for £145. The DK1 was nicknamed &quot;The Cricklewood&quot; after the London suburb where Cockerell lived. EMS used to have a R&amp;D department based over a DIY shop in Cricklewood Lane, Cricklewood, London, so that could have influenced the name of the mechanical keyboard. It is not widely known that EMS electronic equipment was mostly made by another company &quot;Hilton Electronics&quot; based in Wareham, Dorset.

The VCS3 consisted of 3 voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), a noise generator, two input amplifiers, ring modulator, voltage-controlled low-pass filter, trapezoid envelope generator, voltage-controlled reverberation, level meter, two output amplifiers thus providing a stereo output, and a joystick providing &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; modulation control.

A distinctive design feature of the VCS3 (and later EMS systems) was that, rather than using patch cords to route audio and control signals between modules, Cockerell employed a small matrix plugboard (patchboard) into which the user stuck special conductive pins that connected an input (listed on the X-axis of the matrix) to an output (on the Y-axis). This matrix plugboard gave the VCS3 a high degree of inter-connectivity, comparable to that of much larger modular systems, and far greater than similar small synthesisers like the Minimoog. It was also much easier to examine than the tangle of patch cords used to interconnect other modular systems of the day, such as the Moog modular synthesizer and was many times smaller than the cumbersome Moog patch bays, which used patch cord leads capped with 1/4-inch &#x27;phone&#x27; jacks.

A live performance version, the VCS4, was built later the same year but was never put into production. It comprised two VCS3s side-by-side with a keyboard, mixer and signal processing in front, all in a single wooden cabinet. Although EMS lost track of the instrument in 1983, it survived and in the United States, until 2019 when musician Simon Desorgher sold it to the Goldsmiths College, University of London Electronic Music Studios.

The company&#x27;s next project, the Synthi KB1 (1970), designed by Cockerell, also never went into production. It featured the same synthesis modules as the VCS3, but housed in a horizontal box casing, with a 29-note mini-keyboard controller and two small built in speakers. Only one prototype unit was built and this was subsequently sold to the progressive rock group Yes. 

==Synthi 100==


EMS moved into direct competition with Moog in 1971 with the development of its first large-scale modular synthesiser, the &quot;Synthi 100&quot;, which originally retailed for £6,500. This unit was first known as the &quot;Digitana&quot; another was later dubbed &quot;The Delaware&quot;, after Delaware Rd, Maida Vale, the location of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. Mounted in a free-standing console cabinet, the Synthi 100 was the third development level of the original VCS3, being in essence 28 VCS3 units by circuit board count. It was driven by twelve VCOs and eight VCF oscillators. Featured a built-in oscilloscope, two 60 x 60 patchbays, two joystick controllers, dual five-octave velocity-sensitive keyboard controllers and a 10,000 clock event with 6x6bit D/A outputs.
e.g. 256 duophonic events (512 CV events) digital sequencer. About 30 units were built by EMS, and these enjoyed wide use in the 1970s and beyond; one model was sold to the BBC Radiophonic Workshop and was used extensively on BBC productions including &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; and the original radio version of &quot;The Hitchhikers&#x27; Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. The sequencer module of the Synthi 100 was also made available as a separate unit, the Synthi Sequencer 256, which originally sold for £1,100.

==Synthi A / Synthi AK / Synthi AKS==


In 1971 EMS released a portable version of the VCS3, the EMS Synthi A, originally called the &quot;Portabella&quot;, a pun on London&#x27;s Portobello Road. Built into a compact Spartanite attaché case, this unit was even cheaper than the original VCS3 and retailed for just £198. The following year EMS released an expanded version, the Synthi AKS, which retailed for £420 and featured a sequencer and a small keyboard built into the lid. The first 30 AK units featured a black and silver touch pad, a Spin-and-touch random note selector and a resistive touch-sensitive keyboard; these original keyboards proved difficult to use, so they were subsequently replaced with blue capacitive touch-sensitive keyboard with integrated sequencer, and became known as the KS version.

The Synthi AKS proved very popular and AKS units owned by Eno, Pink Floyd and Jean-Michel Jarre featured prominently in music by these artists in the early 1970s; one of the best-known appearances of an AKS on record is the track &quot;On the Run&quot; from Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973), and it can be seen being used by Roger Waters and David Gilmour during the recording of the album in footage included in the 1st Director&#x27;s Cut of &quot;Live at Pompeii&quot; and in the DSOTM episode of the BBC documentary series &quot;Classic Albums&quot;, respectively (Gilmour used his to demonstrate the sequence used in the song).

==In music and the media==

EMS synthesisers and their London studios were used by many prominent rock and electronic artists including Pink Floyd (&quot;Meddle, Obscured by Clouds, The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall&quot;), The Who (&quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;), BBC Radiophonic Workshop, Brian Eno and Roxy Music, Tangerine Dream (all early albums), Hawkwind, Tim Blake, Jean Michel Jarre and Kraftwerk and David Vorhaus (&quot;White Noise 2&quot;). As noted above, the Synthi 100 &quot;Delaware&quot; owned by the Radiophonic Workshop was used extensively for BBC radio and television productions in the 1970s.


The EMS Synthi Hi-Fli analog multi effect processor was used extensively by Tony TS Mcphee of The Groundhogs and was used on the album &quot;SOLID&quot; in 1974. Footage exists of them live at the Marquee Club in London and it is clearly visible on its stand on stage. This footage was broadcast on The Old Grey Whistle Test in 1974.

In late 2010 Zinovieff put his original Synthi A synthesiser (serial number 4016) up for sale. This instrument, which he believes was the one featured in the &quot;Every Picnic Needs a Synthi&quot; press advertisement, was fully restored by Robin Wood at EMS.

EMS equipment can be seen in the 1978 British horror film &quot;The Shout&quot; starring Alan Bates, John Hurt and Susannah York, the equipment featured includes a Synthi Sequencer 256, a Vocoder 2000 and a VCS3, the film is available on DVD (Network 79527630), the equipment was loaned to &quot;The Rank Organisation&quot; by Dartington College in Devon, and the featured Synthi Sequencer 256 was recently sold on the &quot;Vintage Electronic Musical Instrument Auction&quot; VEMIA website in April 2011.

<text>Kasshabog Lake is a small lake in Havelock-Belmont-Methuen, Peterborough County, in central Ontario, Canada. It is in the Great Lakes Basin, and is home to a cottage community, including game fishing, a marina and lodges.

==Geography==
Kasshabog Lake is located north of the community of Havelock. The lake receives flow from several smaller tributary lakes. The major inflow at the north and outflow at the south is the North River, which flows to Belmont Lake, and then via the Crowe River and Trent River to Lake Ontario. Although the lake has many islands and bays, only MacDonald (Bill&#x27;s) Bay appeared to be hydrologically separated from the main lake, but it is not.

, the lake had 16 permanent residences, 504 cottages, and four cottage rental units. MacDonald Bay has 81 cottages along its shoreline. The unincorporated area and dispersed rural community of Kasshabog Lake is on the west shore.

==Hydrology==

The volume of water in MacDonald Bay flushes itself about twice during the year, while the rest of the lake flushes only about once a year.

Kasshabog Lake has soft, slightly acidic water with a moderately low amount of apparent colour. The hardness, alkalinity, and conductivity levels indicate the lake is well mixed. Thermal stratification (temperature layers) were found in almost all the bays and monitoring stations. Water clarity was moderately good throughout the lake, and the secchi disk results indicate the lake is mesotrophic, or moderately enriched.

Dissolved oxygen distribution throughout the lake showed a gradual decline with increasing depth, probably due to the decomposition of organic matter in the bottom waters. No significant accumulations of nutrients in the bottom waters was found at any of the monitoring stations.

The density and composition of the phytoplankton (microscopic water plants) indicated an &quot;unenriched&quot; lake condition. The density and composition of the zookplankton (microscopic animals) indicated &quot;moderately enriched&quot; lake conditions.

==Sportfish==
The most popular sportfish of Kasshabog lake are Largemouth Bass, Muskellunge, and Smallmouth Bass. The lake also contains Rock Bass, Perch, and Walleye (Pickerel). Kasshabog lake is in Fisheries Management Zone 15.

==Tornado==
There was a tornado in the summer of 2002. There was tree damage and a few houses damaged.

== Fanwort (&quot;Cabomba caroliniana)&quot; ==
Fanwort is an aquatic perennial herbaceous plant and is considered invasive. The first verified report of an established population of fanwort in Ontario was made in the summer of 1991 in the North River, immediately downstream of Kasshabog Lake. It is the only reported established population of this plant in Canada. Fanwort is a popular aquarium plant and was likely introduced to the lake by dumping aquarium remains into the lake.

==Pollution from Unimin Ltd. on Kasshabog Lake==
In August 2012, the Medical Officer of Health of Peterborough County issued a health advisory to the residents of Kasshabog Lake and Bottle Lake. For details see www.pcchu.ca.

In February 2013 the Ministry of the Environment released an exhaustive study on the air quality Impacts of Unimin Ltd. on Kasshabog Lake. The report concludes that:
&quot;Unimin is the source of contaminants that are being released to the atmosphere in an amount and manner that is causing the following adverse effects, contrary to the general provisions of the Environmental Protection Act, RSO 1990 (EPA), Section 14:
a)impairment of the quality of the natural environment for any use that can be made of it,
b) damage to property,
c)harm or material discomfort to any person,
d)loss of enjoyment of normal use of property.
The Facility operations are the source of contaminants whose observed deposition results in violations of the limits contained in schedule 2 of Ontario Regulation 419?05 (Local Air Quality) for Dustfall.
Unimin is the source of contaminants that are being released to the atmosphere in an amount and manner that is in violation of Part III, section 45 of Ontario REgulation 419/05 (Local Air Quality).&quot;.

Residents of the lake have also issued formal complaints to the mine, Ministry of the Environment and the Environmental Commissioner regarding sound emissions from the mine. Their complaints and observations contradict the findings by Pinchin Environmental for Unimin. That report concluded that &quot;the noise impacts from both plants at the monitoring locations were below the applicable MOE guideline limites for Class 3 (Rural) areas&quot;.

Following orders from the Ministry of the Environment early in the year, Unimin mine has embarked on a plan to cover tailings areas with vegetations. As shown in aerial photographs at the Annual Meeting of the Lake Association, significant progress has been made on the Blue Mountain site. At the Nephton tailings site the areas covered by vegetation are, as yet, limited.

On Friday, July 22, 2013 there was a discharge of dust from the Nepthon tailings area documented through a number of eyewitness accounts, videos and photographs.
&quot;In response to these observations the Ministry issued a Provincial Officer’s Order to Unimin requiring them to update their dust control action plan and to implement additional controls before the end of this week to prevent dust from leaving the Nephton tailings area. While in the past, Unimin has given the impression to the Ministry that they had full control of their dust problems; Friday’s observations certainly show that they do not. I would like to reassure you that the Ministry remains committed to solving this problem. Additional inspections are planned to ensure that Unimin implements the necessary dust control measures to prevent dust from impacting the Kasshabog Lake area.&quot; (Chris Johnson, MOE, Provincial Officer, Badge 782)

<text>Radianthus magnifica, also known by as magnificent sea anemone or Ritteri anemone, is a species of sea anemone in the family Stichodactylidae that is native to the Hawaii, USA, Indo-Pacific.

==Description==
The magnificent sea anemone is characterized by a flared oral disc, which reaches between 20 and 50 cm in diameter, but in some specimens, this can reach 1 m. The oral disc, the base of the tentacles, and the oral orifice have the same color, going from light beige to white.

The numerous tentacles exceed 8 cm long. The sea anemone, being a member of the Hexacorallia, usually carries tentacles in multiples of six that are positioned in concentric circles. Their tips are fingered and often lighter in coloration than the tentacle body and are sometimes vividly colored.

Its specific scientific name, &quot;magnifica&quot;, and its vernacular name come from the bright color of the column, which is the visible outer structure when the animal retracts, and these range from electric blue to green, red, pink, purple, or brown.

==Distribution and habitat==
The magnificent sea anemone is widespread throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific area, from the eastern coasts of Africa, the Red Sea included, to Polynesia and from southern Japan to Australia and New-Caledonia

This anemone likes hard substrates well exposed to light and current from the surface to 20 m deep. It has been observed down to 40 m deep.

==Biology==
The magnificent sea anemone has two feeding methods. The first one is through the photosynthesis of its symbiotic zooxanthellae, living in its tissues. The second method is through using its tentacles to stun, immobilize, and consume prey (small invertebrates, fry, or juvenile fish).

The reproduction of the anemone can be sexual by simultaneous transmission of male and female gametes in the water or asexual by scissiparity, which means that the anemone divides itself into two individuals, separating from the foot or the mouth. The magnificent sea anemone is found as solitary specimens throughout its range with aggregations only being found in the rim areas of its distribution. Genetic analyses does not suggest a difference between solitary specimens in the central distribution and clustering specimens at the rim. Asexual reproduction is found only in the rim areas and is probably the origin of the large aggregations.

The relationship between anemonefish and their host sea anemones is highly nested in structure. With 12 species of hosted anemonefish, the magnificent sea anemone is highly generalist. The anemonefish it hosts are also mostly generalist, the exceptions being &quot;Amphiprion pacificus&quot;, only hosted by &quot;H. magnifica&quot;, and &quot;A. akallopisos&quot;, which is also hosted by &quot;Stichodactyla mertensii&quot;. The species of anemonefish hosted by the magnificent sea anemone are: 
*&quot;Amphiprion akallopisos&quot; (skunk anemone fish)
*&quot;A. akindynos&quot; (Barrier Reef anemonefish)
*&quot;A. bicinctus&quot; (two-band anemonefish)
*&quot;A. chrysogaster&quot; (Mauritian anemonefish)
*&quot;A. chrysopterus&quot; (orange-fin anemonefish)
*&quot;A. clarkii &quot; (Clark&#x27;s anemonefish)
*&quot;A. leucokranos&quot; (white-bonnet anemonefish)
*&quot;A. melanopus&quot; (red and black anemonefish)
*&quot;A. nigripes&quot; (Maldive anemonefish)
*&quot;A. ocellaris&quot; (false clown anemonefish)
*&quot;A. pacificus&quot; (Pacific anemonefish) 
*&quot;A. percula&quot; (clown anemonefish)
*&quot;A. perideraion&quot; (pink skunk anemonefish)

&quot;H. magnifica&quot; also hosts &quot;Dascyllus trimaculatus&quot;, the threespot dascyllus, and various commensal shrimps.

<text>Scott Bower (June 27, 1978) is an American former soccer player.

==Youth==
Bower grew up in Florida where he played for the Florida State U-17 soccer champion with the Tampa Bay Kickers. In 1996, he graduated from Gaither High School where he was an All State soccer player. Bower began his collegiate career with Stetson University from 1996 to 1997. In August 1997, he also played for the Clearwater Chargers who won the U-19 US Youth Soccer National Championships. He then transferred to Clemson University where he played his junior season in 1998. Clemson was ranked number one in the Country for most of the season, only losing one game. In the Atlantic Coast Conference final, Bower scored the game-winning goal over the Duke Blue Devils.

==Professional==
In February 1999, Bower left college and signed a Project-40 contract with Major League Soccer. The league assigned Bower to San Jose Earthquakes. In July 2002, he played four games on loan to Portland Timbers of the A-League. Bower was waived by the Earthquakes at the end of the 2002 season and went on trial with LA Galaxy during the 2003 preseason, but couldn&#x27;t secure a contract and retired shortly after.

<text>The Central Lapland Greenstone Belt (CLGB) is a greenstone belt located in the northern part of the Fennoscandian Shield. The region belongs to Lapland, northern Finland. The CLGB is part of a much larger belt of Paleoproterozoic greenstones, a cover of metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks that cover the Archean basement, the latter which is representative of the Archaean Karelian craton. Deposition of the cover sequence occurred between about 2.5 Ga and 1.8 Ga, thus it preserves information about Earth&#x27;s history from a period that encompass about 700 Ma. 

Thus, the CLGB records a prolonged and episodic history of rifting, sedimentation and magmatism before the collision and rift closure at about 1.9 Ga. The collision was related to the amalgamation of the supercontinent Columbia. The CLGB is considered to have significant potential for gold deposits.

<text>Ronald Dayne (born March 14, 1978) is an American former football running back who played college football for the Wisconsin Badgers, winning the Heisman Trophy in 1999. He also played professional football for eight seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He was selected by the New York Giants in the first round of the 2000 NFL draft. He also played for the Denver Broncos and Houston Texans.

Dayne is one of only two players in college football history to rush for 2,000-plus yards in a single season twice in his career, the other being Troy Davis of Iowa State.

Dayne would be the all-time rushing yards leader in NCAA Division I FBS history, with 7,125 yards with the bowl game statistics included, though the statistics accumulated in bowl games prior to 2002 are not accounted for by the NCAA. Thus, Dayne is officially recognized as the second-leading rusher behind Donnel Pumphrey.

==Early life==
When Dayne was a child, his parents divorced, and he was sent to live with relatives. Due to a lack of reliable adult relatives, Dayne was forced to take on a parental role to his younger sister when he was just ten years old. Raised in Berlin Township, New Jersey, his athleticism and speed made him a star running back at Overbrook High School in Pine Hill, where he was heavily recruited by many colleges. He also excelled at track and field. In 1995, he won the New Jersey Meet of Champions, setting a new meet record in the discus throw. In 1996, he won state titles in both the shot put and discus, breaking both meet records. He won the Meet of Champions in both events and breaking his own meet record in the discus. He has the fifth-best distance ever thrown in the discus by a U.S. high school athlete at .

His football role was expected to change when he reached college. At out of high school, many felt that he was too big to be a tailback and believed he would be best suited as a fullback. Eventually, coach Barry Alvarez promised Dayne a tailback position and persuaded him to come to play for Wisconsin.

==College career==
Dayne attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he played for the Wisconsin Badgers football team from 1996 to 1999. Known as the &quot;Great Dayne&quot; and &quot;The Dayne Train&quot; throughout college, Dayne was the starting running back all four years at Wisconsin and had 1,220 carries during his career.

Over his four seasons, Dayne set the NCAA Division I-A rushing record for total yards in a career. He gained 1,863 yards as a freshman, 1,421 as a sophomore, 1,325 as a junior, and 1,834 as a senior. He broke the record in the final game of the 1999 season against Iowa. Dayne ended his career with 6,397 rushing yards (which does &quot;not&quot; include yardage from the four bowl games he played in), eclipsing the record set the previous year by Ricky Williams of Texas. The record has since been eclipsed by San Diego State back Donnel Pumphrey.

Dayne excelled in three bowl games for Wisconsin. He rushed for 246 to lead the Badgers to a 38–10 victory in the 1996 Copper Bowl against Utah, garnering MVP honors. Dayne only gained 36 yards in the 1998 Outback Bowl loss against Georgia the next season, but bounced back the next two seasons with 246 yards and 200 yards, respectively, in the Badgers&#x27; 1999 and 2000 Rose Bowl wins. Dayne won MVP honors in both games, becoming only the third player in the history of the Rose Bowl to repeat as MVP — and the first and still only Big Ten player to do so. Bob Schloredt (Washington/AAWU), Charles White (USC/Pac-10) were the first two, and Vince Young (Texas/Big 12) has subsequently accomplished this feat.

Dayne won the Heisman Trophy in 1999 as well as other awards throughout college, including Big Ten Player of the Year for 1999 and All-American placement in 1996, 1998 and 1999. His name and number is one of six displayed on the Camp Randall Stadium façade. Dayne&#x27;s #33 was officially retired during the November 10, 2007, game against Michigan.

Dayne was inducted into the University of Wisconsin-Madison&#x27;s Athletic Hall Of Fame as part of the 2009 class alongside fellow NFL player Joe Panos and MLB pitcher Thornton Kipper. For his contribution to the Rose Bowl game, he was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame on December 31, 2011. In 2013, Dayne was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
Dayne was selected in the first round with the 11th overall pick of the 2000 NFL draft by the New York Giants. In Dayne&#x27;s first season he teamed up with Tiki Barber in the backfield to create the tandem known as &quot;Thunder and Lightning,&quot; a combination of Dayne&#x27;s power and Barber&#x27;s speed. The Giants went on to play in Super Bowl XXXV. Over the next few years, Dayne&#x27;s carries slowly diminished, with head coach Jim Fassel, with whom Dayne already had a contentious relationship, growing increasingly disappointed with Dayne&#x27;s supposed lack of commitment to lose weight. Fassel reportedly also did not like Dayne&#x27;s halfback running style, and tried to make him a goal line back. Dayne missed every game during the 2003 regular season due to injury, and the Giants refused to trade him. After Fassel was fired, Dayne shed 40 pounds and received a second chance under new head coach Tom Coughlin. Dayne saw minimal playing time during the 2004 regular season. The Giants did not attempt to re-sign Dayne, and he later signed a one-year deal with the Denver Broncos for the 2005 season. He was re-signed in the 2006 offseason and named the starter, but fell on the depth chart as the pre-season went along and was cut on September 2, 2006. The Houston Texans claimed Dayne off waivers the following day.

As a member of the Houston Texans, Dayne rushed for 429 yards and five touchdowns in December 2006. In 2007, he filled in for the injured Ahman Green. Dayne did not play in the NFL after the 2007 season.

<doc id="1213188" wikidata="Q5445034" url="?curid=1213188" title="Fernbank Science Center">
<text>The Fernbank Science Center is a museum, classroom, and woodland complex located in Atlanta. It is owned and operated by the DeKalb County School District, which announced in May 2012 it was considering closing the facility to cut its annual budget, then quickly shelved the plan after public outcry. The nearby Fernbank Museum of Natural History is a private non-profit organization that is separate from the Science Center.

== Overview ==

The Fernbank Science Center opened in December 1967, and is an educational facility and an integral part of the DeKalb County School District. It provides programs for the science education of local students, pre-K-12. Both its planetarium and observatory are open for public shows on specific occasions.

The mission of the Science Center is to provide and promote an understanding of science and technology and to communicate to its visitors the harmony and order of the natural world. Fernbank contains many materials for instruction, including dinosaur skeletons, rocks and minerals, a collection of tektites, an Aeronautics Education Laboratory and an electron microscope lab. The center also has an authentic Apollo spacecraft from the unmanned Apollo 6 Saturn V test flight, and is home to a planetarium with a -diameter projection dome.

== Jim Cherry Memorial Planetarium ==
The Jim Cherry Memorial Planetarium is a 500-seat celestial theater in the round, equipped with a , a Mark V Zeiss star projector, and over 100 special effects projectors. The planetarium, which was built in the 1960s is the largest planetarium within the state of Georgia and one of the largest in the U.S. It was also the first planetarium to be owned and operated by a public school system in the United States of America.

In 2012 Fernbank Science Center was the recipient of a grant from Lockheed Martin which was used to refurbish the Jim Cherry Memorial Planetarium, and give the theater a technological upgrade bringing it into the 21st century and the digital age. A major component of technological upgrade is the fulldome/immersive projection system, produced by e-Planetarium of Houston. The fulldome system is intended to complement the planetarium&#x27;s iconic Zeiss star projector not replace it.

Prior to the 2012 upgrade, Fernbank staff had been using standard projectors for the video portions of the shows, which put an image on only a small segment of the dome. Since the upgrade, a digital immersive projection system throws extraordinarily bright light onto a spherical mirror tuned to the exact shape of the planetarium dome so video and other images cover the entire dome. Before the upgrade, science center staff had the capability to project images like a slide show. Since the 2012 upgrade, animated images can move across the entire surface.

==Robotics Team==
Fernbank LINKS (Linking Ideas and Networking Kids with Science) was established in 2002. Since then, the robotics team has participated in two robotics competitions, while winning many awards. All of their members graduate high school and pursue a college degree.

In the fall, Fernbank LINKS competes in and hosts the free Georgia BEST Robotics Competition. During their original tenure from 2004-2014, LINKS had been one of the more successful BEST Teams in Georgia, consistently qualifying for the South&#x27;s BEST Regional Championship at Auburn University. However, in 2015, they forfeited their chance to compete in order to host the Georgia BEST hub. Under their leadership, 12 BEST teams competed, with 2 qualifying for the South&#x27;s BEST Regional Championship. In 2016, LINKS plans to expand the Georgia BEST hub to 24 teams, thus allowing more teams to experience the fun of STEM.

In the spring, Fernbank LINKS competes in the FIRST Robotics Competition. Like the BEST Robotics Competition, teams are challenged to build a robot in 6 weeks. Following the main build season, teams prepare for and compete in competitions to advance to the FIRST Championship. In 2016, Fernbank LINKS became the first team in Georgia to win a district qualifier. They also became the first team from DeKalb County to win the Engineering Inspiration Award at the Peachtree District State Championship, qualifying them for the FIRST Championship in St. Louis as part of the Tesla Division. At the FIRST Championship, they were ranked #16 out of 75 teams, but were eliminated in quarterfinal play.

During the Fall and Winter, LINKS has been heavily involved with FIRST Lego League. Every Fall, LINKS hosts 6 free trainings for FLL teams in DeKalb County. In addition, they host the DeKalb FLL Regional Tournament and the Atlanta Super Regional tournament.

<text>The Toronto Northern Lights (TNL) is a Toronto, Ontario-based men&#x27;s chorus of about 75 singers drawn from the Ontario District of the Barbershop Harmony Society. They won the title of Barbershop Harmony Society International Chorus Champions in July 2013 by a margin of two points over the two-time champion Westminster Chorus. The chorus had also earned the silver medal at five consecutive International Chorus Competitions (2001 to 2005), as well as bronze medals in 2000, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2011.

With 34 men on stage in Kansas City in 2000, they were recognized as the smallest chorus to ever receive a medal at the International competition and have been considered instrumental in shifting the perception that a smaller chorus could not compete at the highest levels within the singing society.

TNL&#x27;s expansive repertoire ranges from Barbershop to Broadway, Vocal Jazz to Doo-Wop, and from Gershwin to the Beatles.

TNL has been guest performers in Dortmund, Germany in March 2006 at the BinG! (Barbershop in Germany) convention and at the BABS (British Association of Barbershop Singers) convention in Cheltenham, England in May 2008. In August 2010, they participated in the Vocal International Music Festival in Venray, Holland hosted by the Venray Mannenkorps as part of their 100th anniversary. In September 2012 the group traveled to Beijing, China and performed in the Forbidden City Concert Hall and on the Great Wall of China. In the Spring of 2015 the chorus traveled to Derby, England, Landau, Germany, and finally Stockholm and Nykoping, Sweden, as guests on various shows and the special guest at the Society of Nordic Barbershop Singers convention in Sweden.

Although Toronto is their home base, the chorus draws members from a large area, up to 200 miles, for rehearsals. Members hail from as far as Buffalo, to Ottawa, to Detroit.

The chorus attracts members from a wide range of ages, backgrounds and employment; from twenty-year-old university students, to business professionals, to men in retirement.

The chorus had released five CDs as of 2012.

The Toronto Northern Lights CD titled &quot;The Sky&#x27;s The Limit&quot; was recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario.

<text>Rogaland College was a privately owned college situated about south of Stavanger in Norway. In January 2006 the college moved to Sandnes 10 km south of Stavanger. Later the same year it merged with Diakonhjemmet University College in Oslo and became Diakonhjemmet University College Campus Rogaland, now it is part of the VID Specialized University.

Originally the College was closely connected to the central institution of Nærlandsheimen, an institution for mentally retarded people, owned by the same private owner, Det Norske Diakonforbund (The Norwegian Association of Deacons). The land involved has now been sold to Nærlandparken A/S.

To the two main bachelor programmes the College takes 90 new students every year. In addition, decentralized bachelor programme is offered in Haugesund, and the college offers some courses of continuing education. A total of nearly 400 students are being educated at any given time.

==Main programmes==
The two main programs at the college were:

* The programme for the Authorized Social Educator (earlier known as the Welfare Nurse) which gives a degree compatible to a Bachelor of Science. The Authorized Social Educator primarily works with mentally retarded or mentally disturbed people. It is a three-year course.
* The programme for the occupational therapist gives a degree compatible to a Bachelor of Science. Occupational Therapists help individuals; children, adolescents, adults as well as the elderly, to function in their everyday life when they are unable to perform everyday tasks due to illnesses, injuries, or other disabilities. It is also a three-year course.

Rogaland College (now Diakonhjemmet Høgskole Rogaland) was founded in 1969 by deacons who cared for mentally retarded people.

<doc id="1213199" wikidata="Q7985229" url="?curid=1213199" title="West Gilgo Beach, New York">
<text>West Gilgo Beach is a small private gated community located in the town of Babylon, in Suffolk County, New York, United States. It is part of the Gilgo census-designated place.

== History ==
West Gilgo Beach was founded on Sept 18, 1939, by residents of High Hill Beach, who were displaced by the creation of Jones Beach State Park. About 60 of the original houses were moved by barge or the newly constructed road, from the Zachs Bay section of Jones Beach to the new community. Since then, the West Gilgo Beach Association has grown to approximately 80 houses.

== Description ==
Originally almost entirely a summer community, over half of the houses are now winterized, and there is a mix of full-time and second home residents. The community hosts a small non-denominational church, a self-service library, an unmanned post office, and small firehouses that have hoses on carts. Residents depend on central well water and individual septic tanks.

It also provides the only land access to the Unqua Corinthian Yacht Club.

The land is not owned by the residents, but is on long-term lease from the town of Babylon. In the early 1990s, there was litigation by New York State not to extend the lease. After much negotiation, the lease was renewed, with a ramp-up in costs.

== Noteworthy projects ==
In July 2011, West Gilgo Beach residents united to beautify the community via a large-scale mural painting in the beach-access tunnel.

== Geography ==
West Gilgo Beach is located on Jones Beach Island, a barrier island situated between the Atlantic Ocean and the Great South Bay of Long Island. West Gilgo Beach is an L-shaped community with two roads: Ocean Walk, which begins at the border of Nassau County and Suffolk County and extends east along Ocean Parkway, and Bay Walk, which begins at the gate and heads north towards the South Oyster Bay. West Gilgo Beach is a Right-in/right-out exit from Ocean Parkway, between Tobay Beach and Gilgo Beach.

<text>Rudolf II ( – 10 May 1290), a member of the House of Habsburg, was Duke of Austria and Styria from 1282 to 1283, jointly with his elder brother Albert I, who succeeded him.

== Biography ==
Rudolf II was born in Rheinfelden, Swabia, the youngest son of Count Rudolf of Habsburg and his first wife Gertrude of Hohenberg to survive infancy. In 1273 his father was elected king of Germany, the first of the Habsburg dynasty, whereafter he seized the &quot;princeless&quot; duchies of Austria, Styria and Carinthia from the Bohemian king Ottokar II. After King Ottokar was defeated and killed in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld, King Rudolf in December 1282 vested his sons Albert and Rudolf II with the Austrian and Styrian duchies. However, in the Treaty of Rheinfelden on 1 June 1283 Rudolf II had to relinquish his share in favour of his elder brother Albert. 

In compensation Rudolf II was designated as future king and his father appointed him a &quot;duke of Swabia&quot; - more or less an honorific title, as the former stem duchy had been in long-term disarray after the last Hohenstaufen duke, the underage Conradin, was killed in 1268. In Swabia the former counts of Habsburg only held various smaller home territories, later summed up as Further Austria, of which Rudolf II never got hold.

In the course of the reconciliation process with the Bohemian Přemyslid dynasty, Rudolf II in 1289 married Agnes (1269-1296), daughter of the late King Ottokar II. Rudolf II died suddenly at the age of 20 in Prague, where he stayed at the court of his brother-in-law King Wenceslaus II. In the same year his son, John Parricida, was born. His brother&#x27;s failure to ensure that Rudolf II would be adequately compensated for relinquishing his claim on the throne caused strife in the Habsburg dynasty, leading to the assassination of Albert I by Rudolph&#x27;s son, John, in 1308.
